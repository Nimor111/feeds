 When I used the C-h k command to check it out, the previous help page didn't include the first two key codes with the g. The second paragraph read:

 The current output.
 Something I did must have triggered it
  
C-M-@ runs the command mark-sexp (found in global-map), which is an interactive byte-compiled Lisp function in ‘lisp.el’.
 It is bound to g C-M-@, g C-M-SPC, C-M-@, C-M-SPC.
 (mark-sexp &optional ARG ALLOW-EXTEND)
  
What is the significance of the leading g?
 I also notice it in Doom, but generally not in regular Emacs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am currently in the process of migrating from Notion to Org-Mode. So far, I have done a lot of manual copy and paste and the occasional conversion from CSV to org-tables, which works quite nicely. But now I want to migrate some databases to a list of headings, and have not found a suitable solution to this yet. I was thinking that perhaps a template-based solution might be convenient - I can for example create a template entry in Yasnippet like this:
 * $0 :PROPERTIES: :SOME_PROPERTY: $1 :END: $2 
 With the idea of applying this to the following CSV snippet:
 title,some_property,some_content My Heading,Important,Lorem Ipsum... 
 Now unfortunately yasnippet does not seem to be really suitable for this, since the fields need to be input manually (I don't think you can easily pass in the $? parameters as a list?). I am wondering if other template libraries might be more suitable for this task, or if anyone has any other bright ideas.

 (defconst my-c-style '("linux" (c-basic-offset . 4) (c-offsets-alist . ((inextern-lang . 0))) (indent-tabs-mode . nil)) "My C style") (c-add-style "my-c-style" my-c-style) (setq c-default-style "my-c-style") 
 After switching to Emacs 29.3, opening a new C file results in the style being applied, except for indent-tabs-mode, which is set to true. I used the Lisp debugger and put a watchpoint on the variable. It is set to nil first when the style is applied, and then immediately to true from the same Lisp function. If I remove the Linux base style then I get nil, as expected. Also, applying the style manually with c-set-style works (i.e., indent-tabs-mode is set to nil).
 Has anyone seen this?

 data Address = Address { city :: String, street :: String } deriving Show -- without currying mkIncompleteAddress :: String -> Address mkIncompleteAddress street = Address "NYC" street -- with currying mkIncompleteAddress' :: String -> Address mkIncompleteAddress' = Address "NYC" 
 I would like to understand better what's happening 'under the hood' in the example *without currying*.
 As an aside to support the above point, I continued the depth of the example *without currying* from above by taking *both* the city and the street as input into the function, and using currying for both inputs, as so;
 mkIncompleteAddress2 :: String -> String -> Address mkIncompleteAddress2 = Address Prelude> mkIncompleteAddress2 "NYC" "ABC Street" Address {city = "NYC", street = "ABC Street"} 
 The idea about what's happening in the background still eludes me. I would appreciate clarification as to understand the functionality better.
 Thanks in advance

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, as the title suggests, I am a beginner and I am asking for clarification about a specific detail concerning lambda expressions in Haskell.
 While GHCI allows me to do the following,
 Prelude> (\x y -> x + (\z -> z) y) 100 1 111 
 I am unable to do the following;
 Prelude> (\x -> x + (\y -> y)) 100 1 * Non type-variable argument in the constraint: Num (p -> p) (Use FlexibleContexts to permit this) * When checking the inferred type it :: forall p. (Num p, Num (p -> p)) => p 
 As seen above, attempting to run this results in an error (which I can't make sense of). I am trying to assign 100 to 'x', and 1 to 'y'. What is preventing 1 from being assigned to 'y'?
 I was under the impression that currying would allow for first filling in 'x', then afterwards, filling in 'y'. Clearly, my assumption was wrong.
 Thanks in advance

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm experimenting with cursor-sensor-functions
 (defun test-overlay-cursor (&rest args) (message "%S" args) (funcall-interactively 'which-key-show-keymap 'global-map)) (let ((overlays `(flycheck-info-overlay flycheck-error-overlay flycheck-warning-overlay))) (dolist (overlay overlays) (put overlay 'cursor-sensor-functions '(test-overlay-cursor)) 
 When moving the cursor over a flycheck error it should display a message and show the global-map keymap.
 When moving the cursor to a character with a flycheck overlay emacs freezes (the cursor doesn't move):
 Frozen emacs (the cursore is just before the `f ;`
 The message appears briefly and is then replaced with the first line of (which-key-show-keymap 'global-map) and if I press any key emacs unfreezes and displays the following error:
 Debugger entered--Lisp error: (wrong-type-argument stringp nil) redisplay--pre-redisplay-functions(t) redisplay_internal\ \(C\ function\)() read-key-sequence-vector(nil nil t nil nil t) read-key() which-key--show-keymap("global-map" (keymap #^[nil nil keymap <shortened >...)) which-key-show-keymap(global-map) funcall-interactively(which-key-show-keymap global-map) test-overlay-cursor(#<window 3 on main.ml> 46 entered) cursor-sensor--detect() 
 I tested with emacs -Q and I have the same behaviour. If I remove the (which-key ...) part, no bug/freeze appears. It looks like I'm not supposed to call a function that creates a new buffer.

 Is this possible? I can't find such a setting on the app. Or is there a property I have to set in the Org heading for the event to get this to work (like the SCHEDULED: or DEADLINE: properties)?

I use Q for queries and questions. Period (.) for thoughts and insights that are my own and double quotes("") for quotes of interest. This way, you may make systematic notes to your readings. You get a filtered view and the org file itself in which you take the notes acts as a linear document that takes notes as the readings goes forward. Multiple frames of view are retained.

Curious to hear your thoughts about "flashcards". I recently used them to get over a big hump.
I was trying to learn something specific in programming. It is a huge library, and although I am a fluent programmer (having programmed everyday for the last two decades), I was resisiting this.
What helped me over the hump was a combination of my Zk with Anki, a free flashcard system, which does spaced repetition. I think I now know the library I wanted to master really well: the size is what had been a hinderance and no longer seems to be. I made around 200 cards, and I know them inside out now.
Long term, of course, it is the zettelkasten that will help me with the big picture. But @Sascha or others: have you experimented with Anki and if so how has it worked out?]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi...I haven't programmed since I was 13, that is to say, I know nothing about programming. I want to learn Haskell as my first language, but it seems that a lot of the resources for it are aimed at people who already program imperatively. Does anyone have advice or resources for someone who knows nothing? Preferably resources that will show how different aspects of Haskell are used within programming...I enjoy thinking abstractly but programming seems so different to the type of thinking I'm used to. Also, could anyone help me install Haskell? I can't seem to figure out how to get it to function. I've just been trying stuff in the Haskell playground.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I'm using ligatures.el and I would like to enable all ligatures for every programming language except VHDL, for which `<=` should look like an arrow instead of `≤`.
 I tried the following:
 (ligature-set-ligatures 'prog-mode '( ... "<=" ... ) ) (ligature-set-ligatures 'vhdl-mode '( ... ... ) ) 
 But the more specific mode doesn't override prog-mode, so all ligatures are enabled in any case. I also tried to defining a custom mode like this:
 (define-derived-mode prog-except-vhdl-mode) (add-hook 'prog-mode-hook (lambda () (when (and (not (derived-mode-p 'vhdl-mode)) (not (derived-mode-p 'prog-except-vhdl-mode)) ;; otherwise I get an infinite loop ) (prog-except-vhdl-mode) ) ) ) (ligature-set-ligatures 'prog-except-vhdl-mode '(... ...)) (ligature-set-ligatures 'vhdl-mode '(... "<=" ...)) 
 This "works" (I get the ligature in prog mode but not in VHDL) but prog-except-vhdl-mode overrides the file type's associated major mode so I lose syntax highlighting for everything except VHDL.
 Is there a way to create a non-exclusive major mode like prog-mode? (ligature-set-ligatures doesn't take a minor mode)

 I'm trying to work on this using Emacs, but I couldn't make the LSP work with it. I used the configuration from this tutorial that is linked in the github page of java-lsp package:
 https://xpressrazor.wordpress.com/2020/11/04/java-programming-in-emacs/
  
Open emacs, wait for first time execution of init.el
 Open project folder, open some file, wait for lsp server be installed
 Emacs suggests adding project folder to workspace, I accept its suggestion and give the project root
 LSP is activated but gives me the following message: "xxx.java is a non-project file, only syntax errors are reported"
  
I spent a lot of time trying to figure out what to do:
  
Tried to open the project in VSCode (found this message in stackoverflow from VSCode users), LSP works with my project
 Created a new gradle project, copied source code to it, LSP works with this gradle project
  
What am I doing wrong? I'm so confused.
 Edit - found the problem:
 I'm really unlucky. I put a ".project" folder with some notes in todo org files to be like a "personal mini jira"... Eclipse server needs this path for its ".project" XML file. It's so embarrassing lol

 I was thinking to do the following: * List of tasks 1. Item 1. Person A. 2. Item 2. Person B. 3. Item 3. Person A. And so on, where person name is a tag. But, tags go to the * ie List of tasks. So that would not work. The other way is write as above and search with C-c s name. Wondering if this is the only way or is there some other mechanism or a smarter way to do it.
 Pointing to the appropriate documentation would be enough. Thanks for your time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I recently came across emacs, and wanted to give it a go. I installed the most recent version from the main GNU ftp server. However, I somehow managed to install directly onto my desktop folder rather than in program files like every other typical install I would do. Long story short, all my files have disappeared from that folder. Uninstalled emacs assuming I had downloaded a virus but after doing several system checks I can't identify anything. I have looked through practically all my files on my pc and local disk storage hasn't changed much which seems to tell me they're still somewhere? Files are pretty important (don't have a full back up) so any help would be appreciated.
 Details:
 I downloaded this file here: https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/emacs/windows/emacs-29/emacs-29.4-installer.exe
 PC is running windows 10 64 bit.
 Files are a large number of .docx files along with photos (jpg and png mostly) and a bunch of miscellaneous txt files etc.
 Folder/Path I'm talking about is: This PC > Desktop.

 Bibtex-mode knows two dialects, bibtex and biblatex. But the glossaries-extra package in LaTeX and the accompanying bib2gls program support keeping glossaries in bibtex files that should (I think) have their own dialect following the examples in section 7.1 of The bib2gls beginner guide. Has anyone created such a dialect?

Please see the hyperdrive info manual for installation and setup instructions. hyperdrive-org-transclusion augments the org-transclusion package by Noboru Ota by allowing you to transclude hyperdrive content over a network. You can also transclude specific Org document headings by linking to them.
 This package is similar in nature to org-transclusion-http, which also lets you transclude content over the network (HTTP, not hyper).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm experiencing some wierd behaviour with indent-bars-mode. It works flawlessly when called interactively (via M-x or custom key-binding is the same). When called via hook, on the other hand, it activates the mode, but it does not draw the bars, therefore I have to call it manually twice (once to deactivate the mode and a second time to re-activate it); although this gets the bars showing, it completely messes up my syntax highlighting. The -very minimal- configuration that I have used is:
 lisp (use-package indent-bars-mode :ensure t :hook (rust-mode . indent-bars-mode))  am I the only one having this issue? am I doing something wrong?

 Then check C-x b *Messages* RET. The return value t is shown in the *Messages* buffer:
 t 
 Now try M-: (y-or-n-p "what? ") RET y
 Check C-x b *Messages* RET again. The return value t is shown in the *Messages* buffer. But it is preceded by the prompt string and the answer string too. Like so:
 what? (y or n) y t 
 Why does this difference in behavior exist? Why does y-or-n-p need to print the prompt string and the answer string?
 Source of y-or-n-p where it decides to print the prompt and answer: https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs/blob/master/lisp/subr.el#L3952 But I don't understand why it was written like this to print the prompt and answer?
 This is a problem for me while defining interactive functions. Like so:
 (defun toggle-linum-good () (interactive) (when (yes-or-no-p "toggle line numbers ? ") (display-line-numbers-mode 'toggle))) (defun toggle-linum-bad () (interactive) (when (y-or-n-p "toggle line numbers ? ") (display-line-numbers-mode 'toggle))) 
 Now if I run M-x toggle-linum-good RET, it toggles the line numbers without printing the prompt and my answer once again at the echo area.
 But if I run M-x toggle-linum-bad RET, it toggles the line numbers but after doing that, it prints the prompt and my answer once again to the echo area.
 Why does y-or-n-p need to print the prompt and answer again?

 Version 0.3.2 mainly focuses on backend optimization, reducing the codebase by nearly half, resulting in improved runtime efficiency.
 v0.3.2 (2024-09-24)
 • Improved compatibility with Org-roam v2: it is now possible to update literature notes into the Org-roam database.
 • Minor improvements to file naming.
 • Streamlined and modularized the code.

I've recently been demoing The Archive app, and one feature I've really come to appreciate is the link-as-search functionality (as opposed to the more common link-as-direct functionality found in other editors). This got me wondering—what other editors have link-as-search?
I searched the forums and found this thread where @Sasha mentioned that Zettlr has link-as-search functionality:

  
One big reason for Zettlr is the link-as-search functionality. This is perhaps the most important feature implementation to make an app software-agnostic.


Zettlr's documentation covers link-as-search here.
Additionally, I found a thread on the topic of link-as-search vs link-as-direct
Does anyone know of any other editors with built-in link-as-search functionality?]]></summary>

more than 500,000 projects hosted on the main Python repository,
PyPI), is used both for software engineering and
scientific research. Both have similar requirements for
reproducibility. But, as we will see, the practices are quite
different.
In fact, the Python ecosystem and community is notorious for the countless ways it uses to declare dependencies.
As we were developping FawltyDeps1,
a tool to ensure that declared dependencies match the actual imports
in the code, we had to accommodate many of these ways.
This got us thinking:
Could FawltyDeps be used
to gain insights into how packaging is done across Python ecosystems?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I came across an analogy someone made about passion years ago that has stuck with me ever since. The analogy is:
You can tell if an Italian chef is still passionate about what they do not through the inspired specials or the amazing cannolis or tiramisu, but all you have to do is look at the red sauce. The red sauce is something they’re supposed to make fresh every day; It’s one of the main fundamentals of being an Italian chef. It’s also something that can easily become the mundane if they’re not careful. It’s in the fundamentals that a dip in passion is shown in.
I’m VERY new to building my network of notes, so I’m curious, would most people put this analogy as a separate note like “Red Sauce Analogy” or would this live in a note for the overall concept titled “When passion slips, it shows in the mundane first”?]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I started my ZK in 2018, I adopted the Barbell Method of Reading as my note-taking workflow. I've made only minor tweaks over time. Today, I still adhere to the core idea of reading freely, quickly noting everything that captures my interest, and then revisiting and processing those notes before adding them to my ZK, connecting them with existing ideas.
This is my second processing of @Sascha's article. Thank you, Sascha, for the clear coaching on the simple idea of the two stages of note-making that got me going.
Critiques welcome.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone! New to emacs here. I needed some help in how emacs is setting up my background color. If I start emacs with just that, it works. But emacsclient still gives the original background color of the theme.
 I'm using elpaca with use-package integration.
 Here is my config:
  (use-package doom-themes :demand :config (load-theme 'doom-tokyo-night t) (set-frame-parameter (selected-frame) 'background-color "#0A0A0A") (set-frame-parameter (selected-frame) 'alpha-background 95) (add-to-list 'default-frame-alist '(alpha-background . 95))) 
 Background transparency works in both of them, however, the colour is set to black in only emacs. How can I fix this? Thanks.

 I have also tried M-x keymap-local-set, but the <up> key stays bound to eshell-previous-matching-input-from-input. Curiously, it looks like eshell-mode-map does get updated:
 (keymap (down . next-line) (up . previous-line) (1 . eshell-bol) (27 keymap (12 . eshell-show-output) (13 . eshell-queue-input)) (13 . eshell-send-input) (3 . eshell-command-map))

Search Goal:

 Search for multiple words that may appear in any order, across multiple lines within files.
 The search should be case-insensitive and only return file names that contain all the specified words.
 Integrate the search with Helm to have a dynamic, real-time updating interface.

Using helm-rg and helm-ag**:**
  
I wrote a custom Emacs function to adjust the search pattern using lookahead assertions, enabling multi-word, any-order searches.

 Emacs EWW (Emacs Web Wowser) is a web browser package for Emacs, allowing users to browse URLs within an Emacs buffer. It provides a simple and lightweight way to access the web from within the Emacs environment. EWW was originally written by Lars Ingebrigtsen and is now maintained by the GNU Emacs project.
 One of the key features of EWW is its ability to display web pages inline, without requiring an external browser. This is achieved through the use of an HTML renderer, shr.el, which renders HTML pages directly within the Emacs buffer. EWW also supports viewing PDFs inline, using the doc-view-mode, and can be customized using the mailcap mechanism.
 EWW has several unique features that set it apart from other web browsers. It can display images inline, if Emacs was built with image support, and can block specific images completely by customizing shr-blocked-images. Additionally, EWW uses the colors declared in the HTML page, but adjusts them if needed to maintain a certain minimum contrast.
 Users can interact with EWW using a variety of commands, including eww-copy-page-url to copy the URL of the current page into the kill ring, and eww-bookmark-kill to delete bookmarks. EWW also provides a buffer for managing bookmarks, which can be accessed using M-x eww-bookmarks.
 EWW is highly customizable, with many variables and options available for tweaking its behavior. For example, the eww-history-limit variable controls the number of history entries kept, and can be set to nil to allow the history list to grow indefinitely. Additionally, users can customize image display using shr-inhibit-images and shr-blocked-images.
 Overall, Emacs EWW provides a convenient and flexible way to access the web from within Emacs, making it an attractive option for developers and power users who value the integration and customization offered by the Emacs environment.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[TL;DR
Hello everyone!
This is my first post on the forum and I think it is due, as I have not been able to find an answer.
This current college year I started doing my zk on Obsidian and so far it's been wonderful!
I know that each app is different and that it's better for me to adapt to those apps instead of looking for one that is perfect for my needs. 
Yesterday I found Sublimeless Zettelkasten by @rene. It really meets all my needs, it's amazing!
However I have never used IDs for my notes, but used the title directly; so all the links in my notes are like this: [[note-title]]. I know that Sublimeless ZK works with IDs so I added to all my notes an ID before the file name according to their creation date so that I could see them in the application.
The problem is in the links inside the notes (those I don't plan to change because they are exaggeratedly too many xd).
I already read the README on GitHub of the application, but I understand little or almost no code, so my question is: 
An apology if the question is very naive but I really loved Rene's app and would love to use it as soon as possible with my existing notes.
Best regards and thanks for reading,
Antonio]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lispy is a package which combines modal editing with Lisp by turning on modal editing whenever the cursor is near parens. This allows for single keystroke operations, such as e to evaluate an s-expression (which with eros will then show the result inline). It's paredit with less keystrokes!
 There hasn't been a Lispy release since 2015, and a commit or PR merge for a couple of years. 
 abo-abo, a hero of mine, disappeared from Lispy around the time his child was born. And who can blame him? We're happy for him! He deserves the time with family after all he has done for us.
 But many of us depend upon the Lispy package, so I have made a temporary fork here until abo-abo returns: https://github.com/enzuru/lispy
 I have applied the last few important PRs to get Lispy working again. I have tested it successfully on Emacs Lisp, Common Lisp, Guile, and Clojure. Let me know if it works for you!

 That paper was quoted by Erik Meijer in FP101x several years ago.
 Do you happen to know the title of such paper or where to find it these days?
 There is only one piece of information about it In the forum thread in which the paper was quoted.
  
It is especially remarkable since, in the Haskell community, monads are still considered as one of the most advanced and difficult features to master
  
Thanks a lot!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I watched this Tsoding Video on JSON parsing in Haskell. I have studied that video over and over trying to understand why exactly is a certain abstraction he uses so useful and refactorable. Implementing interfaces/typeclasses for some types for certain transformations to be applicable on those types and then getting these other auto-derived transformations for the type so seamlessly is mind-blowing. And then the main recipe is this whole abstraction for the parser itself which is wrapped in generic parser type that as I understand allows for seamless composition and maybe... better semantic meaning or something?
 Now the problem is though I understand at least some of the design abstractions for this specific problem (and still learning functions like *> and <* which still trip me), I dont get how to scale this skill to spot these clever abstractions in other problems and especially how to use typeclasses. Is the average Haskeller expected to understand this stuff easily and implement from scratch on his own or do they just follow these design principles put in place by legendary white paper author programmers without giving much thought? I wanna know if im just too dumb for haskell lol. And give me resources/books for learning. Thanks.

 I'm using emacs to keep my journal (notes, tasks, etc) but it's really frustrating that I can't just carry my macbook with me all the time.
 It'd be nice to have a tiny (maybe the size of iPad mini) laptop I could reasonably use emacs on (and some coding stuff like lisp/ruby/jvm).
 There's a range of GPD devices that seem to fit the profile but they're made for gaming and are really pricey. I just want a simple linux machine (I'd even be ok if it didn't have X, years ago I had a netbook running Arch I used without graphics for a year).
 I also found a better priced laptop from Fsjun. Never heard of them before. And apparently, there're other similar brands.
 Any recommendations?

 The article is called “Inline your boilerplate – harnessing Scala 3 metaprogramming without macros.” Even though it’s a bit old and doesn’t have fully working code, after studying with ChatGPT for a week based on the content, I was able to grasp the concept of Scala metaprogramming.
 It seems like many people are looking for resources on Scala 3 metaprogramming, and I believe reading the article I shared will be very helpful for you as well.
 I also completed the code based on the blog post and created a Gist I hope this will be helpful to anyone who needs it.

The only difference is that in machine A I have X11 (since I have NVIDIA Quadro T1000 Mobile graphics card in machine A and the nvidia driver 535 (that comes with Bookworm) does not work well with Wayland) and in machine B I have Wayland (no nvidia card).
 For some reason machine A (with X11) is slow when I type fast. The characters appear in the screen after some lag, which is really annoying. 
 I have tried Emacs profiler in both machines, and the profiler shows pretty much the same in both machines:
 187 66% - command-execute
 187 66% - call-interactively
 187 66% - apply
 187 66% + call-interactively@ido-cr+-record-current-command

 64 22% - linum-update
 64 22% - linum-update-window
 8 2% display-graphic-p
 25 8% + ...
 6 2% + redisplay_internal (C function)
 The only difference is in the X11 machine: "display-graphic-p".
 Is there some advice how to debug this lagginess issue?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I'm uncertain if this is the right place to post this. I originally was going to post here because I was going to ask about the differences in features/usage between org-roam and denote, but I kept thinking about it, and I feel like my overarching question should be about my notetaking strategy in general, which tools are then subordinate to.
 I have been trying GTD recently. I find the idea of the inbox to be really valuable, and I did an initial thoughtdump of every potential open loop I had in my mind. It turned out that a lot of it was less task-oriented and more introspective: things about my future, things about how I should engage with parts of the world, and so forth. The only "next action" I could get for these was to journal about it.
 Now, I'm attempting to determine how I should organize journal-notes like these. I think extracting parts of my introspective writing into its own note, and linking those notes together would have value to me (I don't particularly think I'd want to duplicate a full-on Zettelkasten system, but parts of it seem useful to pick up). But I don't really know. A lot of the systems I've read about are either about explicit actionability (GTD, PARA...) or about synthesizing sources and finding interesting connections (Zettelkasten). Is there anything for structured introspection? does anyone do that, and what does your system look like?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey folks!
 I just hacked together a clone of Python's instructor library and I'm looking for early feedback. That library makes using LLMs programmatically very convenient and it seems elisp would benefit from that.
 The core of what Instructor does is allow coders to define a class in Python and then to use that class to define the function-calling / JSON structured output of the LLM as well as instantiate that class based on the response of the LLM. So I tried to replicate this with defstructs as I could.
 Here's the link to the repo (obviously it's called instructor.el). It's fewer than 100 lines of code at the moment. https://github.com/Trevoke/instructor.el
 And the basic usage pattern looks like this:
 (setq llm (make-llm-ollama :chat-model "llama3.1")) ;; for valid types see the help for `make-llm-function-arg' and look at the type. (instructor-defstruct dnd-character (name nil :type string :description "The character's name") (class nil :type string :description "The character's class") (race nil :type string :description "The character's race in the D&D setting") (skills nil :type (list string) :description "The skills the character has")) (instructor-call :llm llm :type 'dnd-character :prompt "Make a starter character for D&D 5th edition.") ;; (#s(dnd-character :name "Eilif Stonefist" :class "Fighter" :race "Human" :skills ;; ["Acrobatics" "Athletics"]))

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I don't use emacs for programming, I use orgmode as an outliner a lot and for some task management. I want to integrate PDF and epub highlights into my notes, so I tried to install the org-noter package on my emacs 29.4.
 I mindlessly copied the following from the github page to my ~/.emacs file:
 (use-package org-noter
 :load-path "<path-to-org-noter>"
 :ensure t
 :demand t)
 It returned the error:
 Error (use-package): Failed to install org-noter: https://melpa.org/packages/org-noter-20240509.1756.tar: Not found
 Error (use-package): Cannot load org-noter
 I tried M-x package-install and got a similar error:
 Contacting host: melpa.org:443
 package--with-response-buffer-1: https://melpa.org/packages/org-noter-20240509.1756.tar: Not found
 Then, I actually read the lines, and it seems like it's expecting me to tell it a directory? I don't want to download and manually install the package, I want it to update automatically, but I don't see how to do that. I've already installed the which-key package with use package, without providing a directory, with:
 (use-package which-key
 :init (which-key-mode)
 :diminish which-key-mode
 :config
 (setq which-key-idle-delay 0.5))

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, this is something I have been struggling with for a while. Every now and then I accidentally rebind a key that I didn't want to rebind. I could not figure out how to "undo" that. In some cases, if it is a simple command and I know which command it was before, I guess I can rebind it (although sometimes this is hard if it only applies to particular modes).
 But it just so happens that I now accidentally rebound C-h and I have no clue on how to fix that (other than completely restarting emacs, which does not seem like a very elegant and satisfying solution).
 Is there a way to "restore" a keybinding to its default state? Or (next best option) a way to "save" my keybindings, so I can restore from a restore-point?
 For now, I guess I will have to restart emacs (again....) which is always a bummer if you have 100 open buffers and a bunch of tabs with stuff you are working on.

 This is my first time posting here to get some help from you ! :)
 As the title say, i'm a main vim user for the past year. But, for any reason, I wanted to try emacs (with evil mode of course aha). 
 I'm still a bit confused with some keybinding, not because of evil mode or emacs, but because i'm on a Mac. 
 So, the fact is that I mainly program in C. I see that there is something called lsp-mode here :
 https://emacs-lsp.github.io/lsp-mode/tutorials/CPP-guide/
 The installation process is really smooth and i'm now using a super duper cool looking IDE ! But here's lay my problem :
 On the website, there is a lot of keybinding like this :
 s-l r r
 But even with this on my fresh init.el file :
 (setq mac-command-modifier 'super)
 I cannot do "super key" command. Do you have any advice to help me ? :)
 (also, I you have any tips with evil mode, or with emacs itself, please don't hesitate and tell them to me!)

I'm vaguely familiar with the notion of (co|contra|in|bi)variant relation. The examples I've seen, however, felt very specific and naive. That gives me a rough idea, but am interested in knowing more on the theory (I must add, "if I can", as the the literature on types and category theory often terrifies me).

 One thing that I'm struggling with is using the agenda functionality. I really like the idea of using it to get an overview of my events/ scheduled items, and I do schedule things, but I keep forgetting to actually look at the agenda view. I know that this is 90% a me problem, but I was wondering what the best solutions for this is, either packages or some custom elisp (although I don't really know how write elisp yet).
 I would like the agenda to be a little bit "in my face", in terms of making me remember to look at it, and it would also be nice to have some sort of reminder, notification or alert when there are events/ scheduled items in the next X days.
 If you have any suggestions, ideas for how to build a better workflow or just pointers to some resources, I would be very grateful.

The most pressing of which is - what exactly constitutes evidence?
Zettelkasten is a way to express my thought process, so if my thought and reasoning processes are flawed then I will end up with subpar knowledge. Requesting you all to lend your guidance and help me reach a deeper level of understanding.
Adding some more context to the situation -
In one of my notes, I made a claim that growth follows certain principles. One of which is accumulation - that repetitions of a task add competence (see attached note)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all!
 This release has been in development for a while. Some eye candy there, but mostly it's updated for the behavior basics and the backend protocol (e.g. full parity with completion-at-point-functions and adding some extras on top while staying mostly backward compatible with the original company-mode backends).
 Completion in the middle of a symbol, general "expand common" behavior, more consistent and powerful "backend grouping", better rendering for the completions popup and support for completion-styles in more built-in backends.
 See detailed changes here: https://github.com/company-mode/company-mode/blob/master/NEWS.md#2024-09-21-100

 I don't have evil-collection to keep things minimized.
 But what I've been noticing is that when I run the following, there is a side-effect of dired-sidebar closing.
 M-x dired-sidebar-toggle-sidebar ;; dired-sidebar opens in the left of my window M-x evil-window-right ;; focus the buffer on the right side of dired-sidebar M-x evil-window-split ;; split horizontally so two buffers top and bottom M-x evil-quit (or M-x evil-window-delete) ;; delete the buffer I'm working on 
 I notice that both the buffer where the evil-quit/evil-window-delete was ran in, and the dired-sidebar buffer closing. Has anyone run into this issue?

Most of my work I do in orgmode and I wanted to start eglot when opening org-babel-switch-to-session-with-code, which in my understanding opens an inferior-ess-r-mode. Now, this inferior mode is not associated with a file on disk, which makes it impossible to run the eglot lsp backend? 
 Is there a way to circumvent this?
 My eglot config starts with:
 ``` (use-package eglot ;; no :ensure t here because it's built-in :defer t ;; Configure hooks to automatically turn-on eglot for selected modes
 :hook ((org-mode . eglot) (ess-r-mode . eglot) (ess-mode . eglot)) ```

 More info about the event here or join our Meetup page to be updated ;) 
 Explore the compile-time arsenal that Scala 3 gives us without resorting to dirty tricks. (You may know them as macros ;)).
 I shouldn't have to know what kind of syntax tree a constructor call desugars into, I just want to transform between two extremely similar data types because the Internet told me I should separate my domain models into layers before I shove them between curly brackets on a socket somewhere.
 Are these the kind of thoughts you entertain on a daily basis?
 See, you actually CAN have the latter without the former in Scala 3 with no loss to your compile-time comfort zone, so kiss your ASTs goodbye - we won't be seeing them again. 
 With that in mind, you can strap in for a gauntlet style run through match types, mirrors, typeclass derivation and the new, exciting and experimental named tuples to build a micro-library that does one-liner conversions between similarly shaped data types with some live demos where we desperately try to make the compiler really mad at us sprinkled in.

 I wrote an Emacs package for note taking (Zettelkasten). It is similar to u/protesilaos 's wonderful Denote, but a whole lot simpler.
 I found out about his package when I'd finished writing mine and, even though it's simpler, I thought someone might find it useful. At least, I use it intensely :D
 You can take a look at https://github.com/villarragut/org-zk

 I am sure it's not mill, sbt. However, I tried searching again here with the keywords like build tool, docker, yaml, and so on but I no longer am able to find it now. Scrolling through the post does find related posts either.
 Anyone has read something like that? Many thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all. I recently released Orgro 1.40.4 with probably the most-requested features since it launched ~4.5 years ago:
  
Full-text editing support: enter a separate editor view to freely edit the plain markup. Works on narrowed sections as well. [demo]
 id: link resolution across files. This has been most requested by Org-roam users. Requires directory permissions per the FAQ. [demo]
  
I've added lots of other improvements as well; see the changelog for details.
 Full-text editing is all well and good, but I'm still thinking about other kinds of "structured" editing operations and how they can be exposed comfortably in a mobile UI (especially one that tries to mimic the "native" appearance of an Org Mode doc in Emacs). If you have ideas, suggestions, or other feedback, please feel free to open an issue or start a discussion.

I just created it to save myself time while writing graphics code; maybe you'll like it too. It's not on MELPA or anything yet.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have been trying to become more familiar with Magit as other options are less appealing currently. 
 I have a project that has a number of nested submodules. I didn't structure it this way, it's something provided to me. In any event I think I have all the submodules fetched, however I'm getting a strange reaction from magit on this last one I know about.
 In this directory, at the command line if I issue git status it comes back with information about the version controlled module. It's in a detached HEAD state, but that's alright for the moment. Basically it reports just fine.
 If I am in magit, and I start at the top, and then open submodules on the way down, when I get to this submodule it says "Corrupt Git configuration". I find this puzzling since Git status seems to work.
 Any ideas on what is going on here? It's an awfully short error message that doesn't really let me know what the corruption is about (and there's nothing further in Messages to explain further.)

 It precisely means that the command has to:

 That's the statement that describes the command. 
 Can someone help me? I'm new in Emacs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone,
 I'm a student using i3wm on Arch Linux, and I’m struggling to decide between Neovim and Emacs as my main text editor. I really don’t have much time to keep switching between editors, so I’m looking for something I can stick with long-term.
 Here’s some context:
  
I type at around 150 WPM, so I want something fast and efficient.
 I’ve been using both Neovim and Emacs for about two months, and I’m comfortable with the keybindings of both.
 I like Neovim because it feels simpler and more straightforward, which is great since I’m learning a lot of new things (programming, using i3wm, etc.).
 However, Emacs is appealing because it seems to be this all-in-one tool where you can do everything from text editing to managing your entire workflow. Plus, I have to admit, using Emacs makes me feel a bit superior, like it’s a “power user” tool, which makes my decision even harder.
  
One important thing: I also want to focus on building actual projects rather than spending too much time customizing my editor. Neovim feels more minimal, which might help me stay focused, but at the same time, I wonder if I’d be missing out on something Emacs offers, like Org mode for note-taking, which I’ve heard is amazing.
 Ultimately, I want to commit to one text editor for life. I don’t want to spend months switching between them or tweaking configurations. My goal is to focus on programming, taking notes, and building real projects—without getting too distracted by endlessly customizing my editor.
 So, should I stick with Neovim and its simplicity, or is it worth diving into Emacs for its extra features and potential? I’d really appreciate your advice, especially from anyone who’s been in a similar position.
 Thanks in advance for your help!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I'm a beginner fper and I've chosen scala because of jvm ecosystem. My background is python, JavaScript web stacks and a little bit of java in android development. I started learning scala a few months back using the following resources: Alvin Alexander's fp simplified 2e ( Waiting eagerly for it to be completed :( ), Functional programming in scala 2e, Scala with cats, Essential effects. While those were great books, I still don't feel confident about writing entire projects in fp scala. My end goal is to shift my algo trading system to scala, (from python) to take advantage of parallelism and spark. Are there any resources (books preferably) which teach, in a practical way, to write a server or a web api or any large project in a functional way? For beginner fper. Most of the videos on YT assume a high working knowledge of fp in scala already. I can write things in oop way in scala (tranlating code from python), however I would love to learn functional style. I know there are rockthejvm courses, but thats wayyy too expensive for me, since I'm not looking to use scala professionally, (I'm self employed) Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[v0.4.0 of hyperdrive.el is available on NonGNU ELPA!
 hyperdrive.el is an Emacs interface to hyperdrive, a mutable, versioned, peer-to-peer shared filesystem. Among other things, hyperdrive.el has these features: Share unlimited files of unlimited size; Explore file history with built-in versioning; Stream video and audio; No signup or account creation; Free as in Freedom!
 Highlights of v0.4.0:
  
 Transclude hyperdrive content using org-transclusion (until hyperdrive-org-transclusion is available on NonGNU ELPA, please use package-vc-install).
  Easier installation of the external gateway program dependency with M-x hyperdrive-install.
  Save disk space by "forgetting" your copy of a file with M-x hyperdrive-forget-file.
  Security measures added to avoid loading major modes in potential unsafe buffers (hyperdrive-mark-as-safe).
  Improved, asynchronous interface for starting and stopping the gateway.
  See at a glance which files have been already downloaded based on their faces in the directory and history buffers.
  
For the full set of changes and fixes, check out the hyperdrive.el CHANGELOG.
 Feedback welcome! If you'd like to support our work financially, please donate here.
 Thank you!!

 ➤ v0.7.4, now on ELPA!
 Since the last update a year ago, indent-bars has improved substantially. New capabilities:
  
Bar depth can be held fixed in parenthesized expressions (e.g. long function calls) and multi-line strings.
 tree-sitter support — with tree-sitter's help, indent-bars can do more: 
 scope-focus: emphasize the current scope (e.g. function, if block, etc.),
 omit blank-line bar display in certain contexts (e.g. top-level module),
 and more.
 
 Fully configurable styling (colors by-depth, bar width, pattern, more) for both in-scope and out-of-scope bars.
 Auto-updating theme support.
 3 methods for depth selection for highlighting the bar at the current depth, including a new default.
 Immediate feedback when changing bar setting in the Customize interface.
 Support for lots of new languages.
 When showing the same buffer side-by-side, stipple bars are displayed correctly in each window.

 At first, I decided to install projectile because it appeared that project management was lacking in Emacs, and it didn't come installed by Bedrock; however, I discovered that Emacs actually provides a built-in alternative to projectile called `project.el`. I implemented some enhancements that someone else kindly shared on the web.
 However, I noticed that there is no customization or command for discovering projects recursively. In project.el project discovery is something 100% manual, the user has to do. Thus, I wonder if someone else has already solved this problem and could share emacs-lisp snippets, maybe? :)

 A quick primer as to what Buf is that shamelessly copies the docs:
 The buf CLI is a tool for working with Protocol Buffers.
  
The ability to manage Protobuf assets on the Buf Schema Registry (BSR).
 A linter that enforces good API design choices and structure.
 A breaking change detector that enforces compatibility at the source code or wire level.
 A generator that invokes your plugins based on configurable templates.
 A formatter that formats your Protobuf files in accordance with industry standards.
 Integration with the Buf Schema Registry, including full dependency management.

Second, I see two practical problems: (1) looooooong compile times, and (2) huge size of the resulting binary executable. Problem 2 doesn’t sound like a showstopper to me, so is Problem 1 the only real barrier. Are there other practical problems I’m unaware of?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I use yadm to manage my dotfiles. It works by setting up a bare git repo in ~/.local/share/yadm/repo.git, so the dotfiles themselves are not in a traditional git repo. (That's nice because otherwise git would try to manage all of $HOME.) 
 I use built-in project.el, not projectile. I'm running a recent self-built emacs off master.
 When I edit my .bashrc, I use eglot with a bash lsp server. Eglot (or something called from it, maybe in project.el?) thinks everything in $HOME should be managed by this server, and runs a giant find . command, which eventually times out and restarts the LSP server endlessly.
 A possible solution to this is to tell emacs that my dotfiles are in an opt-in project that only contains those dotfiles, nothing else. (I'd rather not have to put all my other dirs under ~ into some ignore list -- that's why yadm is so nice, because it's opt-in, not opt-out.) If I could teach emacs that the dotfiles are backed by the actual bare git repo, that would be even nicer, but mostly I just want to avoid eglot trying to manage my whole home dir.
 Any advice? Anyone tried anything like this?

 So ideally, there would be target option in addition to (here) which will insert it at the point (which is close but not exactly what I want)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Forgive me if this post looks messy/topicless.
 I was trying to style the sidebar notes of org-roam-ui. It's been a journey but my finding is mainly that for any change(including style) to take effect, you have to run npm run build or next build in the repo to build a new ./out. That's when I find out about that https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam-ui do not work (Node.js version Node.js v20.13.1, ▲ Next.js 14.2.12) anymore. I think it still works on lower version of node.
 The package still works now for me as emacs doesn't build it and just use the prebuilt one(2 years old) included in the git repo.
 There's 2 main things I found out about it:
  
Most of them on https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam-ui/forks don't build now (on my setup) for the above reason. They have identical next.config.js. I don't know how to fix it (so it build on my setup, which involves editing next.config.js and possibly the project to adapt for node20), so if someone knows please comment. I think it still build with node.js v12 because in odomanov's fork, the build 3 months ago went through and that one's using github action https://github.com/actions/setup-node/releases/tag/v2 which appears to use node12.
 
https://github.com/odomanov/org-roam-ui have built some interesting thing called "desk" similar to https://github.com/cpbotha/org-roam-canvas 's effect. the latter uses obsidian's graph and emacs to make html, odomanov on the other hand made something like this:
 
 click on the \"open desk\" button
 will open this \"desk\" where you can have small snippet of node's html previews to drag around
 and on a side note 3. That's all there is. the only other works on org-roam-ui I'm aware of is https://github.com/ikoamu/publish-org-roam-ui (which builds on https://github.com/uncomfyhalomacro 's fork) which replaces the websocket communication to emacs to get org-roam-nodes with a js stub thus made org-roam-ui static.

 After the recent Denote upgrade, for some reason, using commands like M-x denote (see the issue: https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/issues/440) does not display the list of notes.
 Since my notes rely on numbering, naming new notes has become a frustrating issue, as I don’t know when I accidentally repeat a number.
 I reported this to the plugin developer, Protesilaos (Port), and he asked if I had enabled savehist-mode. However, after enabling this mode, the problem persisted.
 Unable to tolerate this anymore, I decided to write my own function to solve the issue. I must say, Emacs’ flexibility makes me love it even more.
 Code:
 emacs-lisp (defun my-denote-with-preview () (interactive) (let* ((existing-notes (denote-directory-files)) (existing-titles (mapcar (lambda (file) (or (denote-retrieve-title-value file 'org) (file-name-base file))) existing-notes)) (chosen-title (ivy-read "Choose or enter new note title: " existing-titles :caller 'my-denote-with-preview :action (lambda (x) (setq ivy-text x)) :require-match nil))) (if (member chosen-title existing-titles) (find-file (car (delq nil (mapcar (lambda (file) (when (string= (or (denote-retrieve-title-value file 'org) (file-name-base file)) chosen-title) file)) existing-notes)))) (denote chosen-title))))

 More desirable would be indentation along the lines of

 Why should you care?
 For years, Haskell users have been asking for more guidance on best practices, application architecture, and design patterns—things we’ve seen abundant in OOP, but far less in FP. This book aims to fill that void. (You can find my article "The Voids of Haskell" very interesting in this regard; it's about imaginary Haskell books we could have but don't yet.)

 I am using emacs 29.1 with native compilation enabled. I have tried to clear the eln-cache multiple times. I think it is possible that native compilation mess up some of the functions.
 But I have tried also emacs **without** native compilation. The phenomenon persists.
 I also tried emacs -Q and things didn't get better.

 I've been using Doom Emacs since a year or so and since the beginning I've always struggled to understand how different pieces fit together in relation to projects.
 Perhaps it's a "me" problem, but there seem to be many different concepts and interactions that I fail to even understand how I should go about them in terms of workflow:
  
Treemacs
 Projectile
 Workspaces
 Perspectives
  
I initially tried to simply add my projects/folders with `SPC p a`, but they don't show up anywhere.
 I also tried `treemacs-edit-workspaces`, crafted a set of perspectives each containing a set of projects I'd epect to be grouped together, but then every time I open a new file everything gets replaced in treemacs.
 Hopefully somebody can shed some light on how all these modules fit together
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a pretty simple approach to debugging: usually all I need to do to find a bug is insert a bunch of statements throughout the code printing to stdout the value of certain variables at various points:
 print(f"keys : {keys}") console.log(`x : ${x}`) etc 
 I have written a few elisp functions to do just that (see here for example). Right now I'm only covering the few languages I've been working with lately, but I'm interested in expanding the approach further so it covers multiple languages and is easy to adapt.
 A few questions:
  
am I re-inventing the wheel? Is there already a package that provides this feature? The only similar one I found in package-list-packages is ll-debug, which seems simple but also not actively maintained, and adding modes to it isn't super intuitive
 if no to the above questions: is this something people would be interested in? Ideally this package would be: simple to setup with minimal overhead, easy to customize and to add support for new languages. I can't guarantee it will be ready soon, but I'm already working on it for my own workflows, so it's in the early stages (unless I find a better approach: see questions above and below)
 I'm curious what approach to debugging you all use: am I making a mistake by keeping things so simple? what are some more complex debugging capabilities, and are there ways to run these in a way that is consistent across languages (like the debug-print approach)?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everybody,
 If your org-roam database is large, chances are you are waiting more than 1 second for org-roam-find-node to show candidates.
 This is a package that improves the performance of org-roam-find-node. It runs between 4-10 times faster, while maintaining total compatibility. In fact, you can enable/disable the package without any adverse effects.
 The package also extends the org-speed-commands with a hydra, accessible with the letter m. Only two commands are accesible: org-roam-refile and org-roam-extract-subtree (open an issue if you would like to see other commands).
 The only potential issue is if you use a custom template. One of the areas where org-roam spends a lot of time is formatting the template. To reduce this time the template can be a function (which is much faster than processing the template string). The template function provided in the package should be good enough for most users, but adding a new template function is easy. See code for details.
 It is a minor mode, so to enable and disable simply run org-roam-gt-mode
 https://github.com/dmgerman/org-roam-gt
 if somebody can point me to information on how to upload it to a repo of packages, I'll do that. In the meantime, download it from github.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I have been going over my config lately to simplify my first orgmode setup. The more I learn, the more I can see that I have been trying to reinvent the wheel. Anyway, I have been playing around with the clock, and the 'effort' estimates and I am considering using effort to simplify some of my lists.
 The problem is that I use exclusively `org-ql-blocks` for my agenda views, and I was unsuccessful in my attempts at filtering them using `se` and then selecting some criterias. I tried some other filters too, and I could only restrict the org-ql-blocks within agenda views when using `sc` and `st`, respectively category and tags.
 Since I know from the documentation that 'everything is supposed to work' in agenda views but not guaranteed to, I was wondering if the problem was on my side or if someone else could reproduce the error.
 When trying to restrict an org-ql-block using a regex for example, I do not get an error even if it does not work as I would expect, but when trying to apply an `effort` filter, I get the following error:
 Debugger entered--Lisp error: (args-out-of-range 0 0) get-text-property(0 effort-minutes nil) (let ((effort (get-text-property 0 'effort-minutes (org-get-at-bol 'txt)))) (funcall op (or effort (if org-agenda-sort-noeffort-is-high 32767 -1)) value)) org-agenda-compare-effort(= 30.0) (and (org-agenda-compare-effort '= 30.0)) eval((and (org-agenda-compare-effort '= 30.0)) t) (if (eval org-agenda-filter-form t) nil (org-agenda-filter-hide-line type)) 
 Thanks in advance.

 I am currently in the process of deciding on my next long term working and development environment and Emacs is a hot contender.
 Due to specific personal interests and requirements, I would like to begin my Emacs adventure with a maybe slightly unconvential approach, that is, starting with nothing but the Emacs runtime and step by step adding all keybinds for commands that I require and desire, sort of a bootstrap process for building my own environment.
 As far as I can tell I would need the following:
  
Removal of all default keybinds
 Discovery of available commands (external is fine, I don't care about "purity" in the boostrap)
  
Can you point me to any resource that would help me in my plan? Maybe someone with experience going for this approach?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi Org-Mode community! Long time lurker, first time poster. I'm using Org-Mode to produce LaTeX files. Basically, I'm looking for a way to export the "+" plain list item as "\item[$\square$]" and the "-" plain list item as "\item[$\bullet$]", but I can't find any way to do it. I tried using the variable org-latex-listing but it seems that this variable is obsolete.
 (defun my-org-latex-customize-lists ()
 "Customize LaTeX export of Org-mode lists."
 (setq org-latex-listings
 '((+ . "\\item[$\\bullet$]")
 (- . "\\item[$\\square$]"))))
 I did make my own latex-class. I suspect I have to change something here...
 ;; > Creating latex-classes and adding them to org-latex-classes :
 (add-to-list 'org-latex-classes
 ( list "org-report"
 (concat "\\documentclass[10pt]{article}" contenu-preambule)
 '("\\section{%s}" . "\\section*{%s}")
 '("\\subsection{%s}" . "\\subsection*{%s}")
 '("\\subsubsection{%s}" . "\\subsubsection*{%s}")
 '("\\paragraph{%s}" . "\\paragraph*{%s}")))
 In any case, I know you can do it, because I already do it in Org-Mode with Org-Superstar...
 (use-package org-superstar
 :ensure t
 :hook (org-mode . org-superstar-mode)
 :config
 (setq org-superstar-item-bullet-alist
 '((?* . "•") ;; Puce pour les listes à puces
 (?+ . "▪") ;; Puce pour les sous-listes
 (?- . "•")))
 So I'm looking for a variable that look likes the superstar one to change the export. Any help would be greatly appreciated. ChatGPT didn't help either.
 Edit : Correcting mistakes.

 I've recently started using Gnus to manage my emails but haven't been able to configure the Summary buffer exactly as I'd like. Specifically, I want all threads to be collapsed into a single article (the most recent one) and have the threads sorted by the latest date, in descending order.
 Here are lines from my config:
 (setopt gnus-thread-sort-functions '(gnus-thread-sort-by-number gnus-thread-sort-by-most-recent-date) gnus-subthread-sort-functions '(gnus-thread-sort-by-number (not gnus-thread-sort-by-date)) gnus-sort-gathered-threads-function 'gnus-thread-sort-by-date gnus-summary-thread-gathering-function 'gnus-gather-threads-by-subject gnus-thread-hide-subtree t gnus-thread-ignore-subject t) 
 With this setup, all threads are hidden behind their root articles and sorted by the most recent date. However, the issue I’m facing is that the Summary buffer shows the root article instead of the most recent one in each thread.
 I've tried to play with gnus-subthread-sort-functions without success.
 Does anyone know if it’s possible to achieve what I’m aiming for?
 Thank you!

 It find myself, very often, in the situation of having to create CLOCK entries in LOGBOOK drawers by hand.
 Either because I forgot to clock in, or most commonly: because I was doing several things AFK and want to log them all when back.
 Right now I do it by hand, I tyope "CLOCK: " then the timestamps. Which feels... archaic.
 Does anyone have a nice cool function that will ask me for two timestamps (or an initial timestamp and a duration) and create the CLOCK entry?

I will say this, the closest I have seen is a small program on itchio called Decker
It is a recreation and expansion of the old index card mac program (back when Apple still looked like the fruit), very versatile, very user- supported.
I designed a primitive template to use as index cards. Linking cards is not fluid, but maybe someone will make a deck that does that.

 xmonad 0.18.0.9 (Ubuntu 22.04 underneath)
 GNU Emacs v29.4
 Doom core v3.0.0-pre
 Doom modules v24.10.0-pre 
 I'm struggling to get doom modelline to stop truncating my vcs branch name at "-", which happens regardless of whether I set vcs-max-length to 1000000. When there is no "-" in the name, there is no problems.
 I have tried this whole scratch setup in config.el:
 (setq doom-modeline-vcs-max-length 1000
 doom-modeline-vcs-display-function #'doom-modeline-vcs-name)
 I've also tried to write my own version doom-modeline-vcs-name, but I'm not strong at elisp, and I've never managed to get a "HelloWorld" through on the modelline.
 Could somebody please help me? :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Continuing a previous objective:
  
Ergonomic folds: generics-sop recursion schemes, without "base functor"
  
A previous post reminded me of the idea to improve the ergonomics of recursion schemes.
  
What exactly is the point of recursion schemes
  
I haven't worked with plugins but I wanted to find a way to use recursion schemes by giving algebraic datatypes a virtual base functor. The base functor structure is already latent in recursive datatypes and can be recreated by abstracting out recursive positions:
 type Base :: Type -> Type -> Type data Base as a instance Functor (Base as) 
 This is an empty datatype declaration, Base [a] list is the base functor of lists. Then the way to construct values of type Base [a] is to use the constructors of the recursive type: [] and (:), obviously at a different type. This is more natural than dealing with a separate datatype and it helps keep it in sync, but to avoid confusion they can be renamed, Base.[].
 {- -- virtual datatype defined by the plugin type Base :: Type -> Type -> Type data Base [a] list where Base.[] :: Base [a] list (Base.:) :: a -> list -> Base [a] list deriving stock Functor -} -- project = unsafeCoerce project :: [a] -> Base [a] [a] project [] = Base.[] project (a:as) = a Base.: as cata :: (Base [a] res -> res) -> ([a] -> res) cata alg = res where res = alg . fmap res . project len :: [a] -> Int len = cata \case Base.[] -> 0 _Base.:n -> 1 + n 
 Is there any way to make this work?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I'm trying to get mu4e (latest version, using emacs 29.3) to show an email's date/time in my local time zone. This works in the headers view, but not in the message view, where the time typically is shown in UTC time zone or sometimes in other time zones (it might be using the sender's time zone?).
 While debugging the message view, `mu4e~headers-field-value` seems to return the time in my local time zone (correct behaviour), but something else seems to change it afterwards to a different time zone. I haven't altered the values of `mu4e-headers-time-format` ("%X") or `mu4e-headers-long-date-format` ("%c"). Also, `current-time-zone` returns the right time zone for my locale.
 Any ideas what is changing the time zone in mu4e's message view, or how to force using my current time zone?

 I'd started writing some code to integrate the BiomeJS Javascript linter/formatter and having done most of the hard work (arguably a bunch of hacks, but it works) I was now writing here to tell you folks about it.
 I knew about the prior existence of https://github.com/cxa/lsp-biome, which I was going to mention here and explain I don't use LSP hence why I'd written more code instead of using that package.
 But when I did search for lsp-biome, I actually stumbled upon two packages that do exactly what my package do but better:
  
https://github.com/yadex205/emacs-biomejs-format
 https://github.com/craneduck/flycheck-biomejs
  
I don't know how the hell I missed them in my initial search but here they are...
 In the hope that it might prevent someone else from writing a bunch of hacks, I thought I'd keep writing this post anyway and leave the instructions to set them up together:
 ```elisp ;; BiomeJS Flycheck integration (straight-use-package '(flycheck-biomejs :type git :host github :repo "craneduck/flycheck-biomejs" :require t))
 ;; BiomeJS format-on-save (straight-use-package '(emacs-biomejs-format :type git :host github :repo "yadex205/emacs-biomejs-format" :require t :config ( (add-hook 'js2-mode-hook 'biomejs-format-mode) (add-hook 'web-mode-hook 'biomejs-format-mode)))) ```

 In the code below is the some syntax which allow the SQL command to be applied to each row.
 I have seen some examples which based on Elisp which use some mapxxxx and cl-destructuring-bind functions to obtain the values with Elisp and format them for other languages, but I think there is a syntax where org-mode recognizes the var used for the table and uses the values in the formula.

The goal of this research is to investigate whether existing bug taxonomies from literature can accurately capture bugs in Haskell and assess their potential usefulness for the Haskell community.
 We are looking to speak with experienced Haskell developers or maintainers who are willing to participate in a short, 30-minute recorded interview (recordings and transcripts will remain private; only anonymized excerpts and quotes may be shared). During the interview, we'll discuss your experiences handling Haskell bugs — how you identify, understand, classify, and fix them. We'll also present some existing bug taxonomies for you to share your opinions.
 If you are interested or know someone else who might be you can contact me at [R3c55+HaskellDevCall@proton.me](mailto:R3c55+HaskellDevCall@proton.me) or my colleague, Leonhard, at [l.h.applis@tudelft.nl](mailto:l.h.applis@tudelft.nl).
 Thank you for considering this opportunity!
 All the best,

 Despite the long struggle to make streaming abstractions finalize (release resources) promptly (for example, by implementing special-purpose bracketing operations using ResourceT for conduit and SafeT for pipes), they still fail in this task. At best, they have "promptish" finalization.
 Streams implemented in Bluefin, on the other hand, do finalize promptly and can even use general-purpose bracketing!
 My article explains the situation.

 I am trying to use the calendar/diary of emacs in italian, and so I set 
 (setq calendar-date-display-form (quote ((if dayname (concat dayname ", ")) day " " monthname " " year)) 
 which correctly shows me Lunedì, 16 Settembre 2024 if I press d on a day of the calendar where there is some data in the diary. This is the format I want on display.
 The problem is that if I set that variable, inserting a new appointment in the diary with i d, the date is inserted with this format:
 16 Set 2024
 and is not showing in the calendar (No diary entries for Lunedì, 16 Settembre 2024).
 Without that variable setting, instead I get in the diary entry the standard format:
 Set 16, 2024
 which is parsed correclty and shows in the calendar.
 How can I make the whole thing work in italian?
 thanks!

I am currently holding my first weekly review with org-mode and was wondering if it is possible to display all the tasks I have completed in the last 7 days... of course, its emacs probably there is a function for it :D
 I enabled org-log-done and will now have my future DONE tasks logged. I found that by using the "m" option on the Agenda I can filter for TODO="DONE"&CLOSED>="<-1w>" and the agenda shows me what I want.
 Now, I know we can run lisp in org-files and I want to add a snippet to my Weekly review template that queries the org-agenda and inserts the output under the current subheading. I have looked trough a few StackOverflow posts and I am quite frankly lost were to even start since I dont understand what Helm calls as a function to query the org-agenda. 
 I would love to learn what your process is when you create such a workflow, how can I solve this problem without just copy and pasting a solution? I really want to learn the mindset to get my hands dirty with future problems.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Since installing Emacs 31, I noticed a strange issue: if I try to look at the documentation of pcase, Emacs becomes very, very slow. It takes a few seconds to a) show the result in Vertico and b) open the documentation. Even evaluating (describe-function 'pcase) is extremely slow. I discovered that, for some reason, not loading lsp-mode and related packages improves the issue. I've also tried disabling and sequentially re-enabling packages from my config but couldn't find the culprit. To do that, I tried to put my config in a catch statement (to stop the execution at a certain point), like this:
 (catch 'my-exit ;; I want to execute this (throw 'my-exit "Stop here") ;; I don't want to execute this ) 
 I'm pretty sure that what I did there is probably stupid, but I'm not an Elisp expert. Anyway, after putting all my config in the catch-throw statement (even with the throw as the last line), I couldn't reproduce the bug.
 I initially experienced the (describe-function 'pcase) bug on macOS and thought that this was in some way OS-specific, but I compiled Emacs 31+ on my Linux machine today and the same thing happens.
 At this point, I'm just very curious about what is happening. If someone has a clue, I'd appreciate it!

 I’m curious if anyone in this community knows if it’s possible to setup a ctrl lock key instead of caps lock? 
 My hands don’t do chording too well and begin to hurt overtime. I know there is god mode which I can use to avoid it, but even better in my mind would be to set up a “ctrl lock” in the place of caps lock . That way I don’t have to install a plugin and complicate my .emacs.
 I am curious if anyone has any idea if that can be setup on Linux Xorg?

 It is not rare to have my macbook spinning fans at maximum speed, cpu usage high and battery going down, just because I loaded some file with a 'not yet compiled' dependency.
 Also, a "emacs --native-compile-all-packages" to run in advance in order to reduce this sort of compilations while really using Emacs would be great.
 Is there something we can control about it?

 This lighter color line in the mode line is bugging me. Is it an extra border or is it misplaced?
 I really like Solarized Theme, but this thing keeps me away from it.

 If I start it in the terminal /usr/local/opt/emacs-mac/Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS/Emacs -Q -nw, it takes about 0.8 seconds to show up. This is acceptable.
 I also tested https://emacsformacosx.com/ and got similar results.
 Why does the UI of emacs on Mac take so long to appear? Is there any way to speed it up? 
 For comparison, the UI of VSCode takes about 1 second, and Zed's UI takes about 0.5 seconds to appear.
 My Mac is a MacBook Pro 15-inch, 2019 (2.6 GHz 6-Core Intel Core i7, 32 GB 2400 MHz DDR4).
 Please do not suggest using emacsclient; this post focuses on solving / investigating the initial startup window / UI display speed of emacs-mac.

 Thanks to Protesilaos (also known as Prot).
 When I use Emacs 29, I only used the default theme because it was simple and eased my eyes. I tried other light themes including Modus operandi but it's a little high contrast to my eyes. But with Emacs 30.0.91 the modus-operandi theme is much better. Prot has included a total 8 modus themes on 30.0.91, all other Modus themes also have very good quality. Some pictures of the modus-operandi theme on my (Doom) Emacs:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Compatible with Emacs 30 and later versions.
 Overview files now have more elegant names, reducing repetitive occurrences of the word “overview.”
 Fixed an intermittent (setq, 5) error.
 Removed the dependency on conda.el in org-zettel-ref-mode.el, and the detection of the Python environment is now entirely handled by convert-to-org.py. 
 Automatically sets up a virtual environment via the python venv command and installs required libraries. 
 Note: After updating to this version, running convert-to-org.py will reinstall third-party libraries. If you prefer a clean environment, you may want to manage this manually.
 
 
 Improved synchronization mechanism for overview files, preventing multiple overview files from being created for the same source file. Also improved the robustness and stability of this feature. 
 A hash table is now used to map source files to overview files. One great thing is that you don’t need to manually set the hash table file location.
 The overview file header now includes a new property block: #+SOURCE-FILE: to confirm the mapping.
 New commands: 
 org-zettel-ref-check-and-repair-links - Check and repair links between source files and overview files.
 org-zettel-ref-maintenance-menu - Display a menu for org-zettel-ref-mode maintenance operations.
 org-zettel-ref-refresh-index - Manually refresh the overview index.
 org-zettel-ref-rescan-overview-files - Rescan the overview directory and update the index.
 org-zettel-ref-status - Display the current status of org-zettel-ref-mode.

I am trying to make ctrl+c copy, ctrl+shift+c be the prefix key for the modes that need ctrl+c as a prefix key and ctrl+f do incremental forward search and on repeated keypress have it do repeated forward search (like ctrl+s used to, which I rebound to save-buffer). My problems are: 1. Every major and minor mode ignore my ctrl+c bind and treat it as if it were a modifier key. 2. I don't know how to make emacs interpret ctrl+shift+c as the modifier key like cua did. 3. When I try to do incremental search I get the prompt "I-search: [no previous search string]" and when I try to type my search expression it just ignores, removes the prompt and writes my expression into the buffer. All of this happens on the first keystroke.
 Also I have tried to get used to the emacs default bindings and although I know how to use them I find them rather unplesant personally so I can't give up on this.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I thought the most glaring limitations of emacs to date is the fact that any malicious package can potentially gain unfettered access to system files and resources. But macports works by confining 'ported software to a private “sandbox” that keeps it from intermingling with your operating system and its vendor-supplied software to prevent them from becoming corrupted.'
 I am no Emacs expert, but it does appear to work quite well on MacOS via Macports, so my question is whether it really behaves like Emacs does under the hood in this case. And if that is that case, why can't mainstream distributions adopt the same kind of sandboxing mechanisms?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello there Emacsen friends!
 I'm proud to announce auto-dark is growing to version 0.13. Just merged it.
 You may find it here:
  
https://github.com/LionyxML/auto-dark-emacs, or
 https://melpa.org/#/auto-dark (as soon as MELPA builds it)
  
With this version (shouts to sellout for the awesome work!), we are:
 1. Supporting the usage of multiple themes
 Example:
 (use-package emacs
 :custom (custom-enabled-themes '(bringhurst solarized inheritance)))
 (use-package auto-dark
 :init (auto-dark-mode))
 This will make use of various themes at the same time, while auto-dark-mode will also switch the light/dark versions of those themes.
 2. Changing the default way to set light/dark themes
 These variables are now marked as obsolete:
 auto-dark--dark-themes
 auto-dark--light-themes
 The right way to set the light/dark themes is now through:
 (setq auto-dark-themes '((wombat) (leuven)))
 3. Adding example configs on README:
 All examples updated!
 You may find the right way of doing your config on macOS, Linux, Windows, Android and Spacemacs, DoomEmacs, use-package, etc. right there!

 It’s straightforward to rewrite this function pointfully, but doing so doesn’t help one develope an intuition for thinking about function composition, partially applied, on a higher semantic level. This post is my attempt at helping people develop that high-level intuition.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Initial Scala Native support: The modules kyo-data, kyo-tag, and kyo-prelude are now cross-compiled to Scala Native 0.5.5.
 Batch: A new effect that provides functionality similar to solutions like Haxl/Stitch/ZIO Query to batch operations. The effect can be safely composed with others without a separate monad!
 kyo-prelude: The kyo-prelude module contains the new kernel of the library and a collection of IO-free effects. It's a quite complete effect system with mutability only to handle stack safety, tracing, and preemption. Other than that, the entire module is pure without any side effects or IO suspensions, including the effect handling mechanism.
 System: Provides access to system properties, environment variables, and OS-related information. A convenience Parse type class is provided to parse configurations.
 Check: A new effect that provides a mechanism similar to assertions but with customizable behavior, allowing the collection of all failures (Check.runChunk), translation to the Abort effect (Check.runAbort), and discarding of any failures (Check.runDiscard).
 Effect-TS-inspired pipe: The pending type now offers pipe methods that allow chaining multiple transformations into a single pipe call.
 ScalaDocs: The majority of Kyo's public APIs now offer ScalaDocs.
 cats-effect integration: The new Cats effect provides integration with cats-effect's IO, allowing conversion of computations between the libraries in both directions.
 New Clock APIs: New convenience APIs to track deadlines and measure elapsed time.
 Barrier: An asynchronous primitive similar to Latch to coordinate the rendezvous of multiple fibers.
 Integration with directories-jvm: The Path companion object now provides methods to obtain common paths based on the directories-jvm library: Path.basePaths, Path.userPaths, Path.projectPaths.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was playing aroung with org-attach features lately, and stumbled upon something that looked weird to me. When using the uuid method to create attachment folders, orgmode uses the first two characters of the uuid to create a first folder, then the rest of the ID to create the actual attachment folder. It fails if using a uuid of less than 2 characters as far as I could test.
 It is not obvious to the eyes, a bit like a phishing site, I noticed it while deleting all attachments on a node, Emacs yes/no prompted me if I wanted to use recursive deletion. I was surprised because I understood that the 'uuid' method was supposed to store attachments in a flat directory structure named after the node's UUID, under the `org-attach-id-dir` directory.
 At first, I thought it was a bug (most probably in my config as always), but I could track down the process to this function in charge to generate the folder name:
 (defun org-attach-id-uuid-folder-format (id) "Translate an UUID ID into a folder-path. Default format for how Org translates ID properties to a path for attachments. Useful if ID is generated with UUID." (and (< 2 (length id)) (format "%s/%s" (substring id 0 2) (substring id 2)))) 
 Looking at this function, the bug theorydoes not stand as it looks very intentional on the developers part. So I am wondering why it was built like that.
 It does not impair the attachment functionalities at all, everything I tested works fine, but first I am curious, and second the way I found out about it bothers me. I wonder if multiple nodes were to share the same first two UUID characters, would they all get their attachment folders deleted by a recursive deletion meant for only one of them ? If yes, I think that would qualify as a bug with data loss on top of that.
 The docstring does not help me understand its purpose any better, so I thought I'd ask.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Running into a weird issue with a recent upgrade. So I upgraded from emacs 26 to emacs 28.1 on Ubuntu. Normally, I operate emacs in terminal mode (emacs --daemon, emacsclient -t) using Terminal.app from MacOSX.
 Problem I'm having is that as of this upgrade, I can no longer paste text into a terminal buffer in char mode. If I cmd-C "hi" and Cmd-v it in a buffer in `term-mode` in character mode, the console just freezes up (i.e. all further keys aren't doing anything, I can't C-x b to get to another buffer, etc.). I have to Ctrl-G to get back control.
 My lossage output looks like
 ESC [ 2 0 0 ~ h i ESC [ 2 0 1 ~
 Which is what I'd generally expect with terminal shenanigans, and lossage confirms that it invokes `term--xterm-paste`. So I tried manually invoking term--xterm-paste and, yep, that freezes up the console too.
 Invoking help on term--xterm-paste doesn't give any obvious hints, and it's a compiled C function so now I'm at a bit of a dead-end. Any suggestions for how to debug this further would be much appreciated!
 ETA: confirmed issue is happening with an `emacs -Q` run and `M-x term` running /bin/bash, so I don't think it's my configuration (at least, not my emacs configuration).

In wezterm, I run TUI applications defined in eee.el, such as yazi, ripgrep, fzf.
 
In yazi, I search/preview files, and upon pressing Enter, yazi informs Emacs which file to open and where to navigate.
 
Emacs executes a callback to open the target file specified in yazi.
 
 You can see a screen recording example in the GitHub repository mentioned above.
 What TUI applications would you like to see added? What workflows are you interested in? Feel free to raise an issue or submit a pull request, and I will incorporate them when I see them.
 Can you provide me with some suggestions? What tools do you want to see added? What kind of workflows do you prefer?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hej fellows,
 title basically says it all. I use emacsclient on the regular, with a systemd-Service starting emacs --daemon. I have been wondering why I can't use dead keys when using emacs while it works just as intended in about every other program. 
 Deciding to test the issue, I started with emacs -Q, gradually adding more configuration to find the culprit -- only that I was unable to find any, because dead keys would work even with my full configuration. On the other hand, I commented out all my configuration and restarted the systemd-service, only to find that even with practically no configuration, dead keys don't work.
 I am puzzled and have no idea how to search for the solution. If you have pointers where I can look to better understand the issue or might even have a solution, I'd be grateful.
 Have a good day, fellows :)

 I am trying to use this library https://github.com/gwlucastrig/Tinfour when I go to maven I get this set dependency 
 libraryDependencies += "org.tinfour" % "Tinfour" % "2.1.7" 
 I have added it to my sbt, when I check the sbt-tree, I can see it
 [info] +-org.tinfour:tinfour:2.1.7 
 My problem happens when I try to import it to use it in Scala, it fails no matter how I try (upper/lowercase, prefixed with org or no). For these one it says it is not part of org:
 import org.tinfour.* import org.Tinfour.* 
 For these , it simply says not found:
 import tinfour.* import Tinfour.* 
 Any suggestion?

 I've been working on porting Scapegoat rules to Scala 3 using Scalafix and have currently ported 70 of them, with more of them to come (ideally, all of them). This linter is compatible with Scala 2.13 and Scala 3.
 The linter can detect quite a few bugs and has been tested with unit tests and on a large codebase.
 If you want to use it in your Scala 3 project / contribute, feel free to check out my repo.
 I'd be happy to get any feedback (positive or not) and potential improvements I could make.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lambda calculus is the theoretical basis for functional programming languages like Ocaml, Haskell, etc. Therefore it is an interesting topic for me.
 Since Church's lambda calculus, Gödel's recursive functions and Turing's automatic machines are equivalent, I was curious to find the analogue of a universal turing machine expressed in lambda calculus. I have found a quite simple universal lambda term which does the job.
 I have documented the construction of a universal lambda term in this paper.
 It gives a short introduction to lambda calculus. Then it introduces a programming notation for lambda calculus similar to Haskell/Ocaml in order to make lambda calculus more readable for functional programmers.
 In this notation some basic functions for booleans, pairs, numbers and optional values are introduced.
 In order to encode lambda terms the usual Gödel numbering has been avoided. Instead of Gödel numbers the basic idea of algebraic data types has been used.
 Based on the structure of an encoded lambda term, a lambda term is constructed which reduces an encoded lambda term to normal form or loops infinitely in case no normal form exists.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are trying to make Copilot easily available on Mac. For those unaware, Copilot is a runtime verification framework written in Haskell. There's no Copilot executable or Copilot compiler as such: Copilot is an EDSL available as a Haskell library, so users still use GHC to compile Copilot modules.
 I assume homebrew is the easiest path, since we cannot add Copilot to Apple's App Store without having to add GHC and Cabal as part of the same package, which would be a sizeable effort.
 I'm struggling to make that happen due to how GHC and cabal create package envs and package DBs. A lot has changed in Cabal and GHC in the last few versions.
 Any help would be really appreciated. A lot of people in aerospace and at NASA use Mac, so this would be really helpful to increase adoption of Copilot.
 If someone more knowledgeable than me can help, you can find a bit more info in this discussion: https://github.com/Copilot-Language/copilot/discussions/537

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Let's face it: GNU Emacs is old. It was once a complete rewrite of Emacs. However, It was made for a very different world from the world today. I believe it's time for another rewrite. I was brainstorming about some of the features this so-called rewrite needs: 1. Client-Server Architecture: Although Emacs has a client mode, it's not meant to use with a server on another computer. 2. GPU Acceleration: This is the new cool trend. :) 3. Safe Multithreading: While Elisp provides facilities for multithreading, they're practically useless because there is no grantee for a thread to give the process back. 4. Proper GUI Library: And better mouse support. It's also impossible to write good GUI code for Emacs due to threading issues. 5. Image-based: This is also cool. Imagine installing an Emacs distribution just by installing an image. 6. Elisp Support: We need to keep it backwards compatible.
 Please share your thoughts. Thank you.

 I assume the signature of typeof needs to be something like Expr t -> t, but that doesn't seem to be allowed, since t has kind Type_, not kind Type.
 I DON'T want to match on the Expr itself, because that would mean way more work throughout my codebase. But I'm open to other solutions apart from data kinds and typeof.

 Is it pattern or we trying to get some special behavior?

 I have tested it in Org 9.3.8 and 9.5.5 on Emacs 28.2 on Linux and the problem is present on both. I will try in another session to find out why. For now I'm stumped.

I want to create some org capture templates specific to my game, but ultimately want to be able to easily swap out the file later on once I move to a new project (or for example, I'm doing a game jam). It's telling me the variable is a stringp and thus the wrong type.
 I've defined a variable for the filepath and am trying to. I'm pretty sure I don't even need '~/org/since /org is my org directory. Here's the variable:  (defvar game-directory "~/org/radiant-bricks.org" "Directory for current game project") `
 Here's the template. I suspect there's more syntax errors, but I can figure those out next.
  after! org (add-to-list 'org-capture-templates '(("g" "Game Dev Todo" entry (file+headline ,game-directory "Tasks") "** TODO %^{Game Function} [/] /n *** TODO %\\1 Art /n *** TODO %\\1 Code /n *** TODO %\\1 VFX /n %?")))) 
 I've done some searching, but haven't really found much beyond trying to use a backquote or potentially a + I see there's a function option, but not sure if I have to go that far just to get the filename.

Behaviour changes on flag day by Tom Ellis
At work (Groq) we recently upgraded the version of GHC that we use from 8.10 to 9.6, along with many of the Haskell packages we depend on. I wrote about the changes to our code that this required in “Upgrading from GHC 8.10 to GHC 9.6 – an experience report”. That article touches on the risks associated with being forced to make many changes at once: if a problem occurs it can be hard to diagnose and it can be hard to fix.

 And for those who have found Scala difficult to work in due to the market, what is your plan? Do you transition to another language? What languages/jobs do you think are a good transition? 
 I have a Scala job now, but everyone around me has been quite worried and it has rubbed off on me.

 Yesterday, we had a guest drop into one of the emacs channels on IRC and he was saying how Emacs should be better at some things (but wouldn't give any concrete examples). It was all a bit stupid and we've all heard this before. But it did get me thinking this morning that I do have some questions about Emacs. Keep in mind that I'm a non-dev and some answers may be obvious to those who are but they aren't to me. 🙃
 1) Why can't we actually get multithreading built into Emacs? I don't really understand why not. Could somebody please explain?
 2) I was looking at iTerm and Kitty (I use them both but rarely). I mostly use vterm in emacs and I was wondering: would it be really hard to get emacs using GPU acceleration? I know that all GPUs are different and Emacs needs to run o…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I don't want to revisit the flame wars about optional braces. I respect people who don't like using braceless syntax but I personally love using it in Scala 3.
 My question is, Is there any scala syntax that allows you to pass multiple parameters to method calls without having to use open and close parantheses? This would be extremely useful in libraries such as the extremely practical lihaoyi's scalatags. For example. Instead of:
  body( div( h1(id:="title", "This is a title"), p("This is a big paragraph of text")` ) ) 
 If there is some syntax which denotes the indented lines are parameters, maybe something like
  body ~ div ~ h1(id := "title", "This is a title") p("This is a big paragraph of text") 
 In this case the ~ indicates that the following indented region is a set of parameters, so we don't even have put commas after each parameter.
 I haven't thought through this completely, so there might be flaws in this approach, but till now I haven't been able to think of big issues except for ~ probably being used in some libraries already.

 Noob here. I'm using the native Emacs app on Windows and experiencing issues with font rendering. Certain letters and numbers appear as squares, which I assume is related to Unicode characters.
 I'm currently using JetBrains Mono, but I've also tried Ubuntu and Fira CodeFont with similar results. Some specific characters aren't rendering correctly, as shown in the image below.
 I initially thought it might be a font support issue, but the same exact setup works fine on my Linux laptop. Any suggestions or troubleshooting tips would be greatly appreciated.

 Is there a recommended mitigation to this that doesn't involve remapping?

Good news for you: formal methods have never been easier to leverage.
In this post, I will discuss the contributions I made during my internship to
Liquid Haskell (LH), a tool that makes proving that your
Haskell code is correct a piece of cake.
LH lets you write contracts for your functions inside your Haskell code. In other
words, you write pre-conditions (what must be true when you call it)
and post-conditions (what must always be true when you leave the
function). These are then fed
into an SMT solver that proves your code satisfies them! You may have to
write a few lemmas to guide LH, but it makes verification easier than
proving them completely in a proof assistant.
My contributions enhance the reflection mechanism, which…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, I have been using emacs for a few months (and loving it!), and I have recently run into some small trouble that I am not able to figure out. I was using emacs 27.1 all this which installed through apt, and needing a newer version of emacs, I recently installed emacs 29.4 through snap (and now through ppa). Some things broke, but with some time, I was able to get all my packages working again as I want them to. The main problem I am trying to solve now is this:
 Before, when I wanted to open a file or dired, I would just press 'C-x C-f' or 'C-x d' and the minibuffer would open with the path of the current buffer from where I have called the 'find file' command. Then if I wanted to navigate to some other directory, I could just press backspace and go about finding the specific file I wanted. Now, with the new emacs I have (I have tried this with snap and it's the same now with ppa), when I enter the minibuffer with 'C-x C-f' and press backspace to go to the parent directories, it no longer deletes the text and gives the message "Text is read only.' A similar problem I faced today was with mu4e, for which the attachment directory was set to 'Downloads' folder. But I wanted to attach a file that was located in another folder, and when I tried to navigate in the minibuffer after calling the attach function 'C-c C-a', I was not able to move outside of the "Downloads folder' and was getting the same message again. What I want is to be able to navigate through all directories in my home folder when I call these functions in any buffer. What is the problem and how do I go about solving it?
 I'd be grateful for some help with this. I don't particularly understand code, and have been using emacs mainly for humanities research, and it has worked well for me. I am on Pop OS 22.04. Thanks!

 I'm trying to make my Scala code available publicly using the sbt-github-packages plugin. I followed the setup instructions and everything seems fine. My package appears on GitHub, and I was able to import and compile it in a test project.
 Here's the output showing the package being recognized:
 $ sbt dependencyTree [info] welcome to sbt 1.10.1 (GraalVM Community Java 22.0.2) ... [info] default:mon-projet_2.13:0.1.0-SNAPSHOT [S] [info] +-blob:quadedgetriangulation_2.13:1.2 [S] [success] Total time: 0 s, completed Sep 11, 2024, 5:33:25 PM 
 However, I'm encountering an issue where sbt (and VSCode Metals) can't resolve any classes or objects from my library. I'm starting to wonder if I'm building the library incorrectly.
 Here's my repo: BlobTrigDelauVoro
 And I'm using this sbt plugin: sbt-github-packages
 Any advice or tips would be greatly appreciated!
 Thanks in advance!

 type Longitude = Longitude.Type object Longitude extends Newtype[Angle]: override inline def validate(value: Angle): TypeValidation = if (value.toDegrees >= -180.0 && value.toDegrees <= 180.0) true else "Longitude must be between -180.0 and 180.0" type Latitude = Latitude.Type object Latitude extends Newtype[Angle]: override inline def validate(value: Angle): TypeValidation = if (value.toDegrees >= -90.0 && value.toDegrees < 90.0) true else "Latitude must be between -90.0 and 90.0"

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The simple answer to that is the The 5 Monkeys Experiment.
 Political issues about software freedom, expanding Emacs beyond its role as a text editor and unwillingness to link directly with other programs and libraries even if they were GNU programs and libraries are the reason why.
 Emacs was a TUI program when the world began to switch to 50 years ago, and without modules and FFI Elisp utilities and programs were not going to get the graphics UIs that the world began to switch to back then.
 Other than Rust aficionados who develops TUI programs for the masses these days, assuming they are even for the masses?
 Emacs only got modules in 2017 with Emacs 25 and an FFI has been languishing on some Emacs core developer's personal repo for reasons only God knows.
 Modules and FFI are the ladder for pushing Elisp beyond the TUI interfaces of Emacs, and the monkeys got drenched when they tried to use them. Actually they didn't get drenched. They were not given the option at all and got used to not having them.
 The former is here now though having gone for years with them, they are not really missed. 
 Why would folks come up with the Python based Emacs Application Framework or the Javascript based Emacs-NG if the policies had been different years ago?
 Isn't Elisp older than both languages?
 PS. What is the traditional way Emacs uses to connect to external programs called?

 Today's is Avy. I'm trying to follow Karthinks How To Avy. Purely in order to speed up keboard navigation of a large org-file. 
 However, I am struggling to understand one thing, and to debug another. 
  
When I avy-goto-char-timer via M-x all is fine.
 When I use the keybind highlighted in the M-x menu (SPC g s /) then I get as far as SPC g s then the buffer reads "here is not changed!!" - I suspect this is because I'm using someone else's config (Doom).
 With Avy I'd like to search the whole buffer for character patterns - but I can't fathom how to cycle to offscreen options (maybe I'm using Avy wrong and need to isearch instead?)
  
Am I doing this all wrong?

 I understand it's usefulness from an academic perspective, understanding the similarities between different types of recursive algorithms and their common patterns, but in practice, it just seems kind of... pointless?
 For example with cata, I still have to either write a TypeF by hand or use templatehaskell to generate the boilerplate for me, and what's gained from it seems relatively minimal. Not only is the code longer, it's more confusing to anyone not acquainted with this specific topic. On top of that, the example showing that it automatically inserts the missing fmap seems to be trivially caught by the type checker anyway. So I'm really not seeing what we gain here.
 I'm not not ripping on this particular library or it's author at all, I think it's worthwhile to explore topics like this, but as anything other than a mental exercise I struggle to see what the benefit is in practice. Personally I don't understand what the aversion is to explicit recursion when the algorithm you're writing calls for it. For other complicated ideas born out of Haskell like lenses I can immediately see the utility that outweighs any added complexity. Am I missing something here?

 This is a personal reflection, and quite long, but I'd be interested to see where it intersects with others' views.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I guess this is a more Emacs developer oriented question than an end user question but I don't think I should bother the developers on the mailing list.
 What is the general mechanism for a graphics program to be created in Emacs:
  
By Emacs interfacing into some graphics library or its graphics drawing system and drawing the window by itself
 
Having the graphical window created by an external app, embedded in an Emacs frame, but controlled by functionality exposed to an Emacs module.
 
By another program creating a window and having Emacs embed it in a frame, and enabling Emacs to manipulate it through some RPC mechanism?
 
 Emacs Application Framework seems to use Option 3, but I'm not so sure.
 1 and 2 are my interest though. Which Emacs packages are examples of these.

 I am not sure if I would be able to see images using a terminal that supports images. If the flatpak emacs is a gui, is it missing a a dependency to view images ?
 [Edit: SOLVED The problem was that I had set the flatpak on flathub to use wayland instead of x11 which led that flatpak to open emacs in the terminal]

 I have a file containing all short lines, some of which have a lot of vertical space between them. When I move to the end of such a line, the blue box (in my case) showing the cursor position, suddenly jumps into a rectangle one character wide but about 5 lines high. It's no good deleting this - which then joins the two lines into one - and putting in a new return, as the problem immediately comes back.
 I've never seen this before, and I have no idea either what's causing it, or how I can remove it. Note that when I check the file in a terminal with a standard textfile viewer such as more or less, the file shows as it should, that is, without those large spacings. 
 How can I remove those spacings? Many thanks.

 Spreadsheets = Excel or google sheets, its faster and supports better formulas.
 Time tracking = Toggl Track
 Task management = todoist, its better on mobile.
 Note taking = Obsidian (better mobile app)
 what's the appeal with everything being in one app?

 `debug-on-error` does not start thh debugger, and I always get a 'wrong type argument stringp' message. This message is the reason why I experimented passing the ID in different ways. The three variations above have the same behavior:
  
The capture buffer does not pop up
 
The correct entry matching provided ID is found,
 
"* TODO %?" is litterally inserted under it.
 
 I would expect this template to behave like all other templates where I use "%?", which is popping up the capture buffer with the cursor where "%?" is, let me edit the entry, then insert it after I hit `C-c C-c`.
 What am I missing here ?
 Thanks for your time.

 If you don't know what it is:
 A simple, fast, asynchronous, customizable display, highlight all lines with the same commit information, view of git blame commit in Emacs.
 I think git blame is most useful in four ways:
  
author
 date
 time
 commit
  
So I extracted them and let the user choose how to display them.
 Provides global variables to let users choose how to display them:
  
emsg-blame–commit-author
 emsg-blame–commit-date
 emsg-blame–commit-summary
  
Users can use any display frame, such as message, posframe, overlay, popup.

 Suppose I create a .org document and tag some sections as :noexport:. If I understand correctly, those sections will not show up in the exported file, .pdf or .html.
 Suppose I also want to export a file that includes those sections. Rather than deleting each tag one by one, is there a way to globally either delete all :noexport: tags or simply ask the program to ignore those tags? (the latter would be the best for me because I still want to keep those tags for later use)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am currently diving into Org-mode and using it to run more and more aspects of my life. In doing so, I am trying to use Org mode to run my weekly habits checklist.
 It currently looks something like this:
 ****** Self-Care
 Sleep (6+hrs) [x] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [0/0]
 Yoga [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ]
 Exercise [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ]
 Evening routine [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ]
 Journaling [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ]
 The squares and columns correpond to week days. At present I have to manually input the "x" into the square to make it look like a checked check-box. That is inconvenient. What's more, I am also liking the statistics cookies functionality, but I also end up updating it manually.
 Is there a way to get something similar to this visual layout working, where the squares are actual working checkboxes and statistics cookies would update automatically, as they should?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I know that the topic of multi-threaded emacs has come up a lot in the past, with the main objection being that emacs has a ton of global state that would be impossible to make safe.
 However, I have not seen a compelling argument as to why we can't have multi-threaded garbage collection. I saw Julia has recently implemented this (relevant pr), and I struggle to see why something like this would be impossible for emacs.
 It seems that general emacs multi-threading is becoming less of an issue now, as emacs can offload a lot of workloads to asynchronous processes (LSPs, vterms, latemk, git, etc. all running asynchronously). This means that emacs is actually becoming more and more effectively multi-threaded. The downside of all this asynchronicity is that a lot of these programs communicate large amounts of data back to emacs (especially LSPs) creating a lot of garbage.
 Personally, I use gcmh-mode setting gcmh-high-cons-threshold to 10GB in order to avoid triggering the garbage collector often. Occasionally, I will get a 5-10 second freeze when GC is running on the full 10GB. I have CPU support for 20 threads, so I would imagine that multi-threaded GC would reduce the freezes to maybe 1 sec, which is a lot more reasonable.

 Firstly, I don't understand why the repo's releases don't have an actual binary, but whatever, I'm sure they have some reason. 
 However, when I add c-sharp to treesit-language-source-alist and call treesit-install-language-grammar, I get messages that the repo is being cloned and built, but after it's done and has put the binary in ~/.emacs.d/tree-sitter, I get an error about not being able to find the library when I try to enabled csharp-ts-mode. Specifically:
  Warning (treesit): Cannot activate tree-sitter, because language grammar for c-sharp is unavailable (not-found): (libtree-sitter-c-sharp.so libtree-sitter-c-sharp.so.0 libtree-sitter-c-sharp.so.0.0 libtree-sitter-c-sharp.dylib libtree-sitter-c-sharp.dylib.0 libtree-sitter-c-sharp.dylib.0.0) No such file or directory 
 This is really confusing. I can see the file right there.

 I have found it to be faster building and running code just using cabal to build and run (all my personal Haskell projects have stack.yml and *.cabal files). Does anyone have any idea why using stack is slowing things down for me? This doesn't make sense to me.
 Given that I already have valid stack.yml and *.cabal files, it only took me a few minutes to get back to using cabal directly.
 It has been a long time since I reviewed using stack vs. not using stack.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m running into a weird issue and could use some advice.
 When I call a function or alias using M-x shell-command,
 I get shell errors that don’t occur when I run the same commands directly in my terminal.
 Here’s what I’m encountering:
 /home/ychaouche/.bashrc_custom: line 267: syntax error near unexpected token `(' /home/ychaouche/.bashrc_custom: line 267: ` +([0-9]))' /home/ychaouche/.bashrc_custom: line 267: syntax error near unexpected token `(' /home/ychaouche/.bashrc_custom: line 267: ` +([0-9]))' Thu Aug 22 09:34 
 The strange part?
 The function or alias still executes correctly,
 and I get the expected output (e.g., the date).
 But these error messages only show up when running the command from Emacs.
 I suspect the culprit might be related to extended globbing (extglob) since I’m using +([0-9])) in my script.
 From what I gathered here[1],
 it looks like enabling extended globbing with shopt -s extglob could solve the problem.
 I tried and added it at the top of my .bashrc_custom file,
 but then emacs freezes entirely when I try to run anything via shell-command,
 until I cancel it with C-g.
 So my question is:
 Where should I set shopt -s extglob so that M-x shell-command picks it up properly?
 Any pointers or best practices would be greatly appreciated!
 Thanks in advance!

 ```hs import Test.Hspec import Control.Exception import Control.Concurrent import Control.Monad
 data MySyncException = MySyncException String
 deriving instance Eq MySyncException deriving instance Show MySyncException instance Exception MySyncException
 data MyAsyncException = MyAsyncException String
 deriving instance Eq MyAsyncException deriving instance Show MyAsyncException instance Exception MyAsyncException
 forkThread :: IO () -> IO ((ThreadId, MVar ())) forkThread action = do var <- newEmptyMVar t <- forkFinally action (_ -> putMVar var ()) pure (t, var)
 spec :: Spec spec = do describe "try" $ do it "catch a sync exception" $ do e <- try @MySyncException $ do void $ throwIO (MySyncException "foo") pure "bar" e shouldBe (Left (MySyncException "foo"))
  it "catch an async exception" $ do (t, var) <- forkThread $ do e <- try @MyAsyncException $ do threadDelay 5_000_000 pure "bar" e `shouldBe` (Left (MyAsyncException "bar")) -- let (Left ex) = e -- void $ throwIO ex -- rethrow throwTo t (MyAsyncException "foo") -- wait for the thread void $ takeMVar var 
 ```
 The throwTo terminates my child thread and the false assertion e shouldBe (Left (MyAsyncException "bar")) does not run.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm happy to announce heftia-effects, a new extensible effects library for Haskell: https://github.com/sayo-hs/heftia.
 This library aims to provide users with predictable behavior when working with higher-order effects. It offers consistent continuation-based semantics similar to those found in the eff library. For reference, see "The effect system semantics zoo."
 One of its notable features is the ability to combine higher-order effects with delimited continuations, which works on a standard GHC.
 Key Features:
  
Continuations & Higher-Order Effects: Effects that require multi-shot delimited continuations, such as NonDet and coroutines, work seamlessly with higher-order effects.
 Purity: Built on a Freer-based system that does not rely on the IO monad, this library avoids the use of unsafePerformIO and similar functions. As a result, it can handle not only monadic but also applicative effectful programs.
  
For an in-depth explanation of how this library works, check out: Higher-Order Effects Done Right: How the Heftia Extensible Effects Library Works - Sayo-hs Blog.

 It makes sense that some function should be provided to combine the two types of the product type, but I couldn't make it type check. I don't know what the types in the instance declaration should be.

 How can we use the Emacs threading implementation in a manner that doesn’t fall prey to this issue?

Either by opening them both and then being able to switch buffers or maybe in some other ingenious way.
 Any suggestion? 😊
 This is the relevant config I have at the moment (some may recognize it from the 'emacs from scratch' series)

 I've tried Googling and trying to find other Reddit posts but I'm completely baffled as to why Emacs is not loading my init.el file.
 I've tried making an `.emacs` folder and an `.emacs.d` folder, neither of which is loading my init.el file on startup. I've been creating the folders in `C:\Users\laneb\`
 I've also tried running "(message "%s" (getenv "HOME"))" in the minibuffer which outputs "C:\\Users\\laneb\\AppData\\Roaming" which I thought was its home directory, so I created a `.emacs.d/init.el` file and folder and that doesn't work either.
 At this point I'm completely lost as to what I should try next. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

 blamer
 On Windows display commit frequent display failure.
 sideline-blame
 No maintenance for too long, too slow.
 So I made an `emsg-blame` that is as simple and fast as possible and uses asynchronous.
 I think git blame is most useful in four ways:
  
author
 date
 time
 commit
  
So I extracted them and let the user choose how to display them.
 Provides global variables to let users choose how to display them:
  
emsg-blame–commit-author
 emsg-blame–commit-date
 emsg-blame–commit-summary
  
Users can use any display frame, such as message, posframe, overlay, popup.

 The standard library already has maybe and either for this, but I want one function to work for any ADT.

 data MyData = NoArgs | MyInt Int | MyTwoStrings String String 
 It should have type: MyData -> a -> (Int -> a) -> (String -> String -> a) -> a
 So overall, the function should behave like this:
 caseOf Nothing 0 (+3) == 0 caseOf (Just 4) 0 (+3) == 7 caseOf (MyInt 4) 0 (+3) ++ == 7 caseOf (MyTwoStrings "hello" "world") 0 (+3) (++) == "hello world" 
 This stackoverflow answer mentions church encoding and implemented it in a library, but it wouldn't compile for me
 Bonus: have the actual value be the last argument. For the above example, the type should be:
 a -> (Int -> a) -> (String -> String -> a) -> MyData -> a

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Scala is still very complex for me. I don't have a problem with the OO part of it, as I had many years working with mainstream languages. All the concepts of traits, the functions, pattern matching, etc.. this is all good. But I'm really STRUGGLING with anything related to for comprehensions, either, option, etc... Sometimes I need to do something really simple, like getting a value from the database, do some verifications, and then present to the user. But the code is full of `.eitherT().liftT().left()....`, it's really really hard to understand what is happening.
 Most of the code base that I'm seeing is based on scalaz, but other parts of the stack is on akka/play, and there are a few cats as well.
 Any tips or suggestions on how to get better at this part? Books? Courses?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Emacs newbie here. I'm using Vertico + Consult setup for my minibuffer completion system. I am confused on why doesn't `project-remember-projects-under` doesn't have TAB completion. So for example when I want to navigate the path and type in a prefix (e.g. `~/proj...`) and press TAB to complete it (e.g. `~/projects/`), it doesn't happen. But this does happen for example in `C-x C-f` and I assume this should be the case everywhere when I setup Vertico and consult. Another case is the `project-switch-projects` when I want to find a dir to add a new project to the list. I am confused about this and would appreciate some help.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a custom emacs setup that I’m quite fond. I run no code of my own, it’s all just configuring of existing packages. 
 I experience extreme lagginess in some buffers after working in them for some time. My primary major mode is cider (clojure). The buffers are all fairly snappy after a fresh start and then some of them slow down after some time to the point where it could take a second for a cursor move to reflect. If I open the same file in a second buffer then sometimes the cursor is snappy in the second buffer.
 What is the process I must follow to track down the package(s) or config that is causing this lag to build? I’m not really familiar with emacs-lisp beyond basic configuring of init.el. 
 What must I learn, what must I read and what debugging technique should I use?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi. I have been creating Zettels off and on for last 3 years (currently having 450 notes). Requesting your advice and suggestions on a confusion I often experience
I have heard that each note should only be about one idea. However, many times I am creating notes that might have multiple sub ideas but I don't feel each sub idea should be separately made a note. For instance, refer to the attached note.

I am discussing two components about the nature of growth - but I typically prefer to put them in a single note only. Would it be more beneficial for me to put the subpoints in separate notes? If so, why?
If you guys were creating the note that I just pasted, how would you create it? Would you make it single or multiple notes? If multiple, what all notes would you make from it?
Thanks!]]></summary>

Given a non-empty floating-point array of even length n, calculate the minimal value produced when iterating n / 2 times, removing both the minimum and maximum each time and combining them [in a way I don't recall].
  
I think in a procedural language we'd all intuitively sort the values and then iterate from the edges to the middle simultaneously. So in C++ you would essentially end up with something like this:
 // pretend I added constexpr, noexcept, assertions, requires, etc. auto min_extreme_comb(auto && range, auto combiner) { using namespace std; // forgive me pls using type = ranges::range_value_t<decltype(range)>; sort(begin(range), end(range)); return transf…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As a clojure programmer with fairly minimal Haskell experience (read LYAH, implemented an algorithm from grad school), I've been going through the lean 4 intro, and it seems pretty cool. It has many (most?) of Haskell's features, while improving on Haskell in its handling of records/structs and namespaces, imho. That's setting aside the obvious new features like dependent types and theorem proving (I have no interest in theorem proving, personally). It also seems to have a lot of interest from corporate research groups, or at least that's what its wikipedia article claims.
 At the same time, it seems to have very little presence online, outside of its zulip chat group. I see basically nothing on reddit, almost nothing on youtube. I get the impression that very few programmers have picked it up independently or converted to it from other languages like haskell. Searching on the haskell subreddit, I see a post from two years ago where people showed a lot of interest, but not much since.
 So I'm curious, is there a reason it isn't getting traction in the developer/fp nerd communities? Does it simply have too small an ecosystem to garner attention, or is there something else?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've got a bit of a frustrating story to share, and I'm hoping maybe some of you can offer some advice.
 For the past months, I've been trying to find a developer to create an open-source multi-language transliteration mode for Emacs. The idea is to have a mode that can transliterate Latin characters into various scripts in real-time. I'm looking to start with Arabic since that's what I'm most familiar with, but the goal is to make it extensible to other languages in the future.
 The project would use Google Input Tools for the transliteration functionality. I thought it would be a cool project that could benefit many Emacs users working with different languages. The initial requirements aren't too complex (or are they? More on that later):
  
Integrate with Google Input Tools API
 Provide real-time transliteration suggestions (starting with Arabic)
 Store common translations for offline use (like a dictionary)
 Allow manual editing of stored translations
 Design the system to be extensible for other languages through config
 Share the project commented and documented
  
I've posted the job on (a major jobs website) and tried to make it sound as approachable as possible. I've even revised the posting a few times to make it clearer and simpler.
 But here's the kicker: I've run into two major problems. First, the developers I've hired often don't seem to properly assess the project before accepting it. I've had three instances where they've abandoned the project shortly after starting. Second, and this is on me, the budget I can offer is abysmal. I'm realizing now that Emacs Lisp is probably not a beginner-friendly language, which makes finding skilled developers even harder, especially given my budget constraints.
 I am no dev but is this project really hard? How much should it cost? And would it be interesting/worth it for the community?
 Thanks for letting me vent a bit.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone,
 I’m trying to use Org Mode in a way that’s similar to how you’d use an R Notebook or Jupyter Notebook. Specifically, I want to export the results of my analysis (including both code and images generated by that code) into a standalone HTML file.
 I’m running into two issues:
 1. Image Embedding: By default, Org Babel’s HTML export functionality includes a link to any images rather than embedding the actual image itself as Base64. This means that if I share the HTML file, the images won’t be displayed unless the image files are also shared. 2. Pandoc Issues: I tried using a package that integrates Pandoc for exporting, but it won’t export the results of my code snippets—it only exports the code itself. This doesn’t just break image exports, it also fails to include things like text and table results from my analysis, which is a significant issue. 
 Neither of these approaches works for me, and I haven’t been able to find a solution that allows for a complete, self-contained HTML file with embedded images and code results.
 My question: Is there a way to export an Org Mode file to HTML with all results (including images) embedded in the file itself? Any tips, solutions, or packages I should check out?
 Thanks in advance for your help!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been working on creating a major-mode for running tests. I was inspired by how rg.el uses the header-line to customize ripgrep parameters, and I wanted to similarly use the header-line to customize test parameters.
 rg.el achieves this by propertizing header-line elements with keymaps that call functions that customize the compilation query and recompile: see rg-header.el, specifically rg-header-mouse-action. This works with their major mode, rg-mode, which is defined via define-compilation-mode. This macro wraps define-derived-mode to derive from compilation-mode. I was able to mimic this process and achieve the desired behavior for my header-line.
 The problem comes when I try to add interactivity. If what I'm running requires interaction, I typically call compilation interactively. This makes the compilation buffer use comint-mode and compilation-shell-minor-mode. I couldn't figure out how to get define-compilation-mode to be interactive, so I instead just derived directly from comint-mode and activated compilation-shell-minor-mode. With this I can get interactivity in my major mode.
 However, the left click in the header-line no longer works. The hover help text still works. I imagine what's going on is that comint-mode or some minor mode is overriding the left mouse button. How can I get around this? It seems the recommended way of overriding major/minor mode keybindings is to define your own minor mode, or use bind-key*. But I'm not sure how to apply this to my situation, where I want to apply a keybinding only to some text (in the header-line). I'd appreciate any suggestions.

 I used Haskell for a bit on a lubuntu VirtualBox, since it seemed by far the easiest way to setup BLAS and LAPACK needed for the hmatrix library (my PC's operative system is Windows 10). On the virtual machine, I was able to setup my small project with no issues at all, using cabal init.
 Recently, I've managed to set up OpenBLAS and correctly install hmatrix on the host, but when I try to start a completely new project:
 C:\Users\User> mkdir proj
 C:\Users\User> cd proj
 C:\Users\User\proj> cabal init
 after making me choose some set-up options, I'm inevitably hit by this message:
 git: readCreateProcessWithExitCode: does not exist (No such file or directory)
 I tried multiple combinations of options and the result is always the same.
 Every proposed solution to instances of this problem I've seen online doesn't work, and I can't figure out why. I'm definitely missing something very important here, could anybody help?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the past I tried out some Database Libs for one of our projects, but none really catched well. Most were so complicated, that it began to feel like fighting the library instead of fighting SQL. Others had really long compile times.
 In the end I ended up with a small toolset on top of JDBC for Scala 3, called usql: https://github.com/reactivecore/usql
 So what is in there?
  
Interpolation: sql"SELECT INTO Person(id, name) VALUES(${1}, ${"Alice"})".execute()
 These SQL fragments can be freely combined
 Macro-based DAO-Generators for Case Classes
 Dynamic generated extractors for ResultSets / Fillers for PreparedStatements
 Extensible using a small set of Typeclasses (especially DataType)
 Some helpers for writing Joins (not documented yet and a bit unstable)
  
A lot of stuff is not in there:
  
DDL Generation
 ORM
 Dependencies
 Effect system: the main use is in Loom Applications. But it should be possible to wrap it into your own effect system if necessary.
  
The library looks very similar to Magnum, which I was not aware of until late in development.

Getting Started with Nix for Haskell by Abhinav Sarkar
Nix is notoriously hard to get started with. If you are familiar with Haskell, you may have an easier time learning the Nix language, but it is still difficult to figure out the various toolchains and libraries functions needed to put your knowledge of the Nix language to use. There are some frameworks for setting up Haskell projects with Nix, but again, they are hard to understand because of their large feature scopes. So, in this post, I’m going to show a really easy way for you to get started.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have started using org mode in Emacs after a long time using neovim. Almost everything I used in vim has an alternative or even a better option inside emacs... except snippets.
 I like the flexibility of regex snippets in UltiSnips and have tried to recreate this in yasnippet. Most of the things can be customized to emulate such as:
  
having snippet work without the leading space
 making some snippets auto expanding
  
However, I can not find anything about regex context snippets. There is an stack exchange topic about that from a few years back, but even using re-search--backward I cannot recreate the UltiSnips behavior. 
 So what I am trying to achieve?
 I have a snippet when I press the key ;, which:
  
if there are characters before the key it expands to x_{}
 if there are no characters before it (excluding space) it does nothing, so that another snippet, for example ;a can expand to \alpha
  
Most of the issues I have looked at are a few years old. A pull request that would bring that functionality has been abandoned a few years back. 
 I am fairly new to Emacs. Can this be achieved in yasnippet? Is there another plugin, that can achieve similar functionality?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been thinking about a problem that's been bugging me for a while, and I bet some of you can relate.
 We're all drowning in a sea of different file formats. PDFs, EPUBs, HTML, plain text, you name it. Switching between apps for each format is a pain, and it makes building a cohesive knowledge base feel like herding cats.
 Imagine if we could:
  
Open ANY document format directly in Emacs
 Have a consistent interface for all reading materials
 Easily annotate and link between different sources
 Integrate seamlessly with org-mode or org-roam
  
Sounds nice, right?
 I've been working on a tool called `convert-to-org.py` as part of the org-zettel-ref-mode project. It's not a complete solution (yet), but it's a start:
  
Converts various formats to org-mode files
 Runs directly within Emacs
 Preserves document structure
 Plays nice with org-mode and org-roam
  
I Think This Matters:
  
Consistency: All your reading materials in org-mode format
 Annotation: Easy note-taking within converted documents
 Searchability: Emacs' powerful search across all materials
 Integration: Connect reading directly to your knowledge management system
  
And I have some questions:
  
What's your current reading workflow in Emacs?
 What features would your ideal unified reading environment have?
 Any ideas on how to push this concept further?
  
If you're interested in checking out the tool or contributing, star org-zettel-ref-mode on GitHub.

being a statically typed, pure and immutable language based on the

However, if you ask a random developer, I can guarantee that one aspect will be

the bread and butter of typed functional languages. ADTs are relatively easy to

 For example if i create a test.jl file using C-x C-f the buffer automatically enters julia-ts-mode and julia-snail-mode which is great:
 if I define a function:
 function main() nothing end 
 and run the command treesit-explore-mode then I get a buffer that displays:
 (function_definition function (signature (call_expression (identifier) (argument_list ()))) \n (identifier) \n end) 
 so I know that the syntax tree is working and I am able to get indentation, but no syntax highlighting what so ever. 
 with the command font-lock-update I get the following error: 
 treesit-font-lock-fontify-region: Query pattern is malformed: "Node type error at", 177, "(assignment (identifier) u/font-lock-variable-name-face (_)) (assignment (field_expression (identifier) \".\" (identifier) u/font-lock-variable-name-face) (operator)) (assignment (bare_tuple (identifier) u/font-lock-variable-name-face)) (assignment (bare_tuple (field_expression (identifier) \".\" (identifier) u/font-lock-variable-name-face)) (operator)) (local_statement (identifier) u/font-lock-variable-name-face) (let_binding (identifier) u/font-lock-variable-name-face) (global_statement (identifier) u/font-lock-variable-name-face)", "Debug the query with `treesit-query-validate'"

 I'm experiencing an issue with expiring emails in Gnus, and I'm hoping for some guidance. Here’s the situation:
 I’ve configured Gnus with (nnmail-expiry-wait 'immediate) and (nnmail-expiry-target "nnimap+gmail:[Gmail]/Trash") for my Gmail account, expecting emails marked as expirable (E) to be moved to Trash immediately after running the expiration process. However, after marking messages and pressing C-c C-x in the Group buffer, I see "Expiring articles...done", but the emails remain visible in both Gnus and the web interface of Gmail.
 Interestingly, manually expunging messages one by one with B E works perfectly, and the emails are deleted as expected. However, my ideal workflow is to mark certain emails with a single press of E and then batch delete them all at once. Ideally, I’d…]]></summary>

I've been using the Elisp manual's section on examining and changing text properties and while it does provide many functions to do so, none of these changes seem to remain once the file is closed, even if it was saved. Is it possible to save these changes so that they become a permanent part of the buffer and will be redisplayed upon opening the respective file/buffer? I've heard "enriched mode" provides this functionality, but I just wondered if this could be done simply through elisp or some setting configuration?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I'm using tab-bar-mode, and I have tab-bar-format-global in tab-bar-format. This will display global-mode-string to tab-bar.
 ```elisp
 (setq-default tab-bar-format tab-bar-format-menu-bar tab-bar-format-history tab-bar-format-tabs tab-bar-separator tab-bar-format-add-tab tab-bar-separator tab-bar-format-align-right tab-bar-format-global )) ```
 But, in global-mode-string, I have mu4e. the tab-bar erase global-mode-string's menu hover and mouse click action.
 It seems that its related to the "ignore" word. elisp (defun tab-bar-format-global () "Produce display of `global-mode-string' in the tab bar. When `tab-bar-format-global' is added to `tab-bar-format' \(possibly appended after `tab-bar-format-align-right'), then modes that display information on the mode line using `global-mode-string' will display the same text on the tab bar instead." (mapcar (lambda (string) `(global menu-item ,(format-mode-line string) ignore)) global-mode-string)) 
 If I remove tab-bar-format-global from tab-bar-format, the global-mode-string will display on mode-line, and the global-mode-string's mu4e indicator can use mouse to hover and click. I think if put global-mode-string to tab-bar, items in tab-bar should also be mouse hover / mouse click too.
 What do you think? How to quickly hack tab-bar to let global-mode-string accept mouse hover and mouse click in tab-bar?
 Thank you.

 I don't. I already burned my fingers with adding complexity to emacs that I couldn't handle. That included (among others) package management and as a consequence I try to keep additional packages (as well as configurations) to a minimum.
 What reasons do you have for one or the other?

 GHC Haskell's RTS is written in a mixture of C and Haskell. I believe a worthy goal should be to rewrite all C code (and any other code that isn't memory safe) in a memory-safe language (e.g., Rust).
 The Haskell Foundation should make this a high-priority project, and it should seek funding from national and international agencies to staff it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to take lecture notes using `org-mode` and `cdlatex-mode`. The problem I meet is when I try to use `Tab` to expand `fr` it doesn't expand correctly.
 `\(fr<Tab>\)` will become `\(\begin{frame}[]\frametitle{}\end{frame}\)` instead of `\(\frac{}{}\)` and there is a warning saying that `Warning (org-element): ‘org-element-at-point’ cannot be used in non-Org buffer #<buffer MatrixComputation.org> (latex-mode)`. 
 I'm using `doom emacs` and only open `org-cdlatex-mode` as a minor mode. How can I fix this problem to make `\(fr<Tab>\)` works properly? 
 By the way, I also want to know how can I make an abbreviation like `fr`, which I can expand it in a latex fragment. I have try `(setq cdlatex-env-alist'(("limit" "\\lim_{?}" nil)))` and `(setq cdlatex-command-alist
 '(("lim" "Insert fraction env" "" cdlatex-environment ("limit") t nil)))` but this seems only works for the abbreviation at the beginning of a line.

Why we have 2 of them? Are both from Haskell community? Whats the standard and quick way to start project?

The main focus of this update has been to improve its compatibility with org-roam. Additionally, the previously provided `convert-to-org.py` script can now be executed directly within Emacs, allowing for document conversion without leaving this productive environment.
 Although these are just two minor main updates, their impact is significant. It reminds me of a saying: "No matter how simple the functionality, the complexity behind it is immeasurable." To ensure compatibility with org-roam, I've changed the working logic of org-zettel-ref-mode from generating a new file and directly overwriting it each time to incremental updates. I've also studied the org-roam API and managed to maintain stable IDs…]]></summary>

 For me the directory looks like this:  ~/.emacs.d/eln-cache/29.4-95d1479c/ace-window-a4363797-e4f210e9.eln /aggressive-indent-eaef7fd5-fb4a240b.eln ... /yaml-mode-3ab646e7-6cc0bf46.eln 
 Basically the form seems to be eln-cache/<VERSION>-<HASH-1>/<PACKAGE>-<HASH-2>-<HASH-3>.eln.
 I am assuming these hexadecimal values are hashes, but I suppose they can be anything.
 If they are hashes, what are they hashes of? Can I reproduce these hashes somehow?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[N.b. I mostly write Lisp and Go these days; I've only written toys in Haskell.
  
Naively, "making invalid states unrepresentable" seems like it'd couple you to a single understanding of the problem space, causing issues when your past assumptions are challenged etc. How do you architect things for the long term?
 
What sort of warts appear in older Haskell code bases? How do you handle/prevent them?
 
What "patterns" are common? (Gang of 4 patterns, "clean" code etc. were of course mistakes/bandaids for missing features.) In Lisp, I theoretically believe any recurring pattern should be abstracted away as a macro so there's no real architecture left. What's the Platonic optimal in Haskell?
 
  
I found:
  
Next Level MTL on tools for growing monad transformer stacks: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZPup5Iuaqw
 https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/4srjcc/architecture_patterns_for_larger_haskell_programs/ discusses e.g. memoization (can't) and instrumenting observability, which makes "functional core" imperative monadic shell" tedious(?). I suspect a deeper understanding of monads (e.g. Van Laarhoven free helps (like dependency injection as the code base evolves)
 Granin's Functional Design and Architecture looks interesting

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've recently stumbled upon `magit-diff-visit-file`, which is bound to RET in a magit diff view. When on a removed line, it jumps back to the previous blob containing that line, which is handy, yet it also seems to revert the worktree file to that old blob, even if I have uncommitted changes to that file.
 This happened a couple of times (magit 4.0.0 and 4.1.0), and I could not find any way to revert back to my (uncommitted) worktree file except for copying back the ~ backup file.
 There is a `magit-diff-visit-worktree-file` command, but that one requires the magit status buffer to still show the uncommitted worktree changes, which is no longer the case if closing the status buffer after invoking `magit-diff-visit-file`.
 Does anyone know an option to either (1) revert to the worktree version after `magit-diff-visit-file`, or (2) somehow warn the user before `magit-diff-visit-file` is about to execute?

 The message says error, but I'm pretty sure it's not because bug-hunter skips over it.
 I could be triggering this via (debug-on-message "Package cl").
 I'm not an expert, but I can step through files and use bug-hunter, etc. This has me stumped right now. I want to eliminate or at least identify this last use of CL in my setup. This message will only appear once, during a fresh cold startup. Obviously, the Lisp engine's PC (program counter) knows where this happened, but it doesn't tell me anything useful. Any suggestions from people who debug regularly?

 embark-collect,

 rectangle-mark-mode, to select the region in the buffer created by embark-collect
 calc-grab-rectangle, to send the region to calc v R +, as I understand it flattens the list of lists of numbers and them sum the resulting list

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to get org-columns to show a column without the amount of hours clocked in the current week.
 I saw that org-mode has a function (org-clock-sum-today) that it uses for the CLOCKSUM_T special property:
 https://github.com/bzg/org-mode/blob/9183e3c723b812360d1042196416d521db590e9f/lisp/org-colview.el#L894
 I also saw that there's a (org-clock-sum-custom):
 https://github.com/bzg/org-mode/blob/9183e3c723b812360d1042196416d521db590e9f/lisp/org-clock.el#L1951
 So I tried to overwrite the org-columns function in my init.el, adding a new condition for that function like: 
  (when (assoc "CLOCKSUM_W" org-columns-current-fmt-compiled) (org-clock-sum-custom nil 'thisweek)) 
 But it does not fill the CLOCKSUM_W column that I added. Any idea on what I could try?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was just curious how folks are feeling these days about Reddit alternatives. I've been enjoying Lemmy, personally, and I find that for technical stuff in particular the communities are definitely growing, feeling less ghost-town-ish little by little.
 Haskell-wise, it seems like https://programming.dev/c/haskell has the most subscribers (see, e.g. this search on lemmy explorer), but is definitely still a ghost town. (And https://programming.dev/c/functional_programming is slightly less than a ghost town.)
 Philosophically, I'm very much in favor of Lemmy, or basically any other more "open" alternative to Reddit. But I get the challenges of hoisting and moving an entire community who all is here for different reasons, have different ideas, etc.
 By the way, people discussed this at length in these two posts a little over a year ago, which makes for good reading:
  
https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/146d3jz/rhaskell_and_the_recent_news_regarding_reddit/
 https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/14dqllb/vote_on_the_future_of_rhaskell/
  
There were plenty of folks in favor of jumping ship (whether to Lemmy or Discourse), but it seems that inertia may have won out, as it often does.
 How are folks feeling these days? Has Discourse filled the gap? Was it simply easier to keep on with Reddit? Anyone out there still pine for a different platform for discussion?

 How does Punc "," <- lexP even work? How is it that, I am able to control the behaviour of lexP by mentioning a value on the left side <-? It feels like pattern matching in the works here, but I can't explain it completely.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I updated emacs today and reinstalled all packages and magit seems to be broken. When installing normally from melpa I get this error when launching magit-status:
 `` The "git-commit.el" library is no longer distributed as a separate package. It is now distributed as part of themagit' package.
 The git-commit' package now does nothing but display this warning. If it is located earlier on theload-path' than magit' is, then that prevents the proper "git-commit.el" libraries frommagit' from being loaded.
 Please uninstalling git-commit' and then restart Emacs. ``
 So, I go ahead and remove git-commit package with package-delete and after restarting Emacs I get the following on the Messages buffer:
  Unable to activate package ‘magit’. Required package ‘git-commit-4.0.0’ is unavailable 
 Is this some kind of chicken and egg problem? anybody experiencing this?
  
Ok, found the issue!
 The version of magit on nongnu is old, the new version is only on melpa, so, if you have this configuration magit will fail:
  (setq package-archives '(("melpa" . "https://melpa.org/packages/") ("stable" . "https://stable.melpa.org/packages/") ("gnu" . "https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/") ("nongnu" . "https://elpa.nongnu.org/nongnu/"))) (customize-set-variable 'package-archive-priorities '(("gnu" . 99) ("nongnu" . 80) ("stable" . 70) ("melpa" . 0))) 
 If melpa is configured to have a higher priority than nongnu then everything works...

 The files are GUI design text files where items are outlined and nested underneath their parent containers, so if there is change somewhere, all I need is to go the outermost applicable parent and commit all the hunks there automatically.
 Not collapsing could result in large unmodified regions appearing in the display, but I'm happy for them to be shown if it helped keep my bearings within the file.
 It would also help if the line numbers where also displayed instead of the diff line number markers.
 I could also open the original file on the side, possible with diff-hl-mode or some other such plugin to help.

 According to the manual, you can make a "datetree" capture template ((file+olp+datetree "filename" [ "Level 1 heading" ...])), which works great, but I'd like to customise it for my use - I'd like it to align with my university schedule.
 Ideally, I'd like to have one heading per university week (starting at ISO week ~40 for this semester - so I'd like ISO's W40 to be my Week 1), then one sub-heading per day. How would I go about doing this? Is there a way to create my own datetree type, or do I have to write my own capture template function? If I need to do it all myself, are there any guides/examples I can follow?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm using the official Android port of Emacs using the companion Termux application for several month now.
 In summary, this setup allows you to obtain the full Emacs experience, with deep Android integration (e.g., resizing or navigating using the touchscreen), and leveraging Termux application sharing (i.e., Emacs can access all Termux installed binaries, such as git).
 In my daily usage, I successfully use org-agenda (and org features in general, e.g., refilling), dired, magit, eshell. Even the image viewer is working! My dotfiles are synchronized leveraging Syncthing between my Android phone and my computer, so it's a breeze to configure.
 Did you know it was possible? Does anyone tried it successfully or had troubles?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I just made the switch from Neovim a few weeks ago and I started using u/Nicolas-Rougier's nano-emacs distribution. (Love the distribution btw <3)
 I've also experimented with different model editing systems like meow, evil and god-mode because while I ditched Neovim for Emacs for the features, I still believe the modal editing style is perfect for me. As of now, I'm really happy with god-mode because of its ease of use and its complete integration with the rest of emacs.
 However, I would like to use vim-like keys to edit in text buffers and regular emacs keybinds with god-mode everywhere else, since my entire system (WM, browser, etc.) has been optimized to use vim-like keys.
 In order to achieve this, I am trying to create a minor mode that overrides keybindings in all other modes (I'm not sure this is the best idea).
 So far, I have done something like this, and the commented part has not worked (understandably).
 (use-package god-mode :straight t :config (setq god-exempt-major-modes nil) (setq god-exempt-predicates nil) (define-key global-map (kbd "<escape>") 'god-local-mode) (define-key god-local-mode-map (kbd "i") 'god-local-mode) (god-mode)) (define-key global-map (kbd "C-x r f") 'recentf) (define-key global-map (kbd "C-c c") 'org-capture) (define-key global-map (kbd "C-c a") 'nano-agenda) (define-minor-mode divine-mode nil :global t :group 'nano :lighter " DiVine" :keymap (list (cons (kbd "C-S-h") (kbd "C-h")) (cons (kbd "C-h") (kbd "C-b")) (cons (kbd "C-j") (kbd "C-n")) (cons (kbd "C-k") (kbd "C-p")) (cons (kbd "C-l") (kbd "C-f")))) 
 The thing I'm looking for is the ability to do something like "Make C-j perform whatever function C-n does in the currently active major+minor modes". Also, since C-h is being rebound, I would like to rebind the help prefix key to C-S-h and so on for all the keys that I'm rebinding.
 Is something like this possible?

My main questions are:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all. I have what I hope is a simple issue but it's been really annoying me. I use the arrow keys all the time and, until recently, it was fine. However, sometime in the last several months (maybe a year?) ctl-left and ctl-right don't do anything in my Linux (Centos 7) emacs (29.1 build 2). They don't even show a key has been pressed with ctl-h k. However, chords like shift-ctl-left/right work just fine!
 Note: I access Linux via ETX remote desktop from my Macbook.
 I checked xev and Linux is seeing the keys. I also tried 29.1 (emacsformacosx.com) on my Macbook Pro M1 and it works fine. Any ideas? I'm pretty fuzzy on stuff like xmodmap. Haven't had to mess with that for many years.
 Thanks for any pointer!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been using elfeed and elfeed+org for about 3 years. In that time my feed count has gone from 0 to ~130 but it has been at ~130 for about the last 2 years. Until very recently (last 2-3 weeks), refreshing the feeds was an operation that took maybe 1-2 minutes but it was fine because I continued to be able to use Emacs while the operation was in progress. In the last 2 weeks or so that changed: now when I refresh the feeds Emacs becomes unusable for maybe as long as 3-4 minutes. As in even receiving keyboard input for M-x commands is unreliable. 
 I'm curious if anyone else has seen this behavior? And perhaps has identified a root cause? And a fix?
 Relevant info:
 - I do and have always run emacs-next from guix which currently sits at 30.6.0.
 - I run the latest elfeed and elfeed-org updated approx weekly via straight.el and then, about year ago, via elpaca.
 - I have always run elfeed with the default value for elfeed-use-curl (t).
 - My workstation is fairly beefy: 24 x i5s with lots of RAM. 
 thx
 EDIT: I've recently started running the profiler during elfeed refreshes to see if it might point me in a useful direction. So far, nothing.

It's not far from the beach to the next big settlement. Forum Zettelkasten is written on a big sign at the entrance to the village.
The street is a hive of activity. The people here seem very friendly and open. Small groups have formed on many corners, chatting animatedly. I approached them to listen to some of their conversations. They noticed me and greeted me warmly.
Unfortunately, I don't understand their language. Some words sound familiar, others are completely new to me. Now I'm standing right next to them. The word Zettel is repeated several times - the word I had already read on the big sign. I try to say it in my own language. They don't seem to understand me either.
Luckily I always have a piece of paper and a pencil with me when I'm out and about. I draw a few lines and some symbols. The joy is great. The others also know this way of communicating with strangers.
What does your journey look like? Do you have a map [1]? Where are you travelling from?

I would like to download some class packages such as "turabian-researchpaper" from CTAN and then use them in an org doc which I can then export to LaTeX. I am coming from Rmarkdown, in which this was trivial: just put the class where LaTeX can find it and then call out the class in arbitrary LaTeX code within the .rmd file. However, with Emacs, this does not work.
 I figured out that you have to use an instance of (add-to-list 'org-latex-classes ...) followed by some specifications for that class so that ox-latex can parse it. But I have only found examples of how to add common classes like report or book, not custom classes and downloaded classes. Is there some way to general…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 We're proud to release Helenus for Scala 3!
 Helenus is collection of Scala utilities for Apache Cassandra. Its goal is to make interacting with Cassandra easier, in a type-safe manner, while trying to avoid introducing a complex API.
 Most of the API stays the same as its Scala 2 counterpart, the only notable difference is how typeclasses are derived. Whereas in Scala 2 for a case class we'd do RowMapper[Hotel] in Scala 3 we can do case class Hotel(...) derives RowMapper.
 In future releases we hope to get these APIs much closer by providing similar methods.

 The e-book version is available for most e-reader bookshops. The source files for the book (full text) and the configuration files are freely available on GitHub.
 It has been great working on this project with help of the community. I hope this project can attract some new Emacs users.
 Next step is an enhanced second edition and publish a paperback version.

 I like eMacs diff, so I open the file in .c_path and do ediff-buffers so I can review my changes. This requires opening the file, positioning the original file on the left, updated file on the right and then m-x edify-buffers. I have set ediff-split-window-function to split-window-sensibly
 I do this often, so I would love to automate this workflow. I’m not sure how to begin though - any suggestions?

 When I look at where I am fetching packages from:
  '(package-archives (quote ( ("gnu" . "http://elpa.gnu.org/packages/") ("melpa" . "http://melpa.org/packages/") ("melpa-stable" . "http://stable.melpa.org/packages/") ) )) 
 Commenting out the "gnu" line seems to make the loading error go away, but then there are tons of packages I can't install, I guess because their dependencies are in the gnu repository.
 This is on "GNU Emacs 28.2 (build 2, x86_64-w64-mingw32) of 2022-09-13".
 Any ideas? Any pointers for where I might look for clues about this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been using evil for a few years but it never really "clicked" and I only ever used the main keybindings. I'm trying out Meow, since hopefully it will be more configurable, and the object-verb structure might be easier for me, and I like that you don't have to define your own separate keybindings for every new package.
 I'm wondering if there are any guides for setting up leader-key and local-leader stuff with meow? I know that keypad mode is great for entering normal keybindings without cords, but I'm wondering how to add special keybindings to keypad mode?
  
Is there a way to have a "local-leader" key, like "," which is the equivalent of doing "C-c", so I can have a separate way to input mode-specific commands?
 How can I bind specific commands to key sequences in keypad/leader mode? e.g. I want "SPC SPC" to be like M-x, "SPC b b" to bring up the buffer menu, "SPC w d" to delete a window, etc. How can I do this kind of specific bindings for local-leader commands? But for everything I haven't defined, I want to default to the usual meow-keypad stuff.
 Are there any configs/packages that are like evil-surround? Or embrace configs for meow?
 Are there any meow configs for LaTeX mode, for e.g. surrounding in commands and such?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I tried to ask this question in a language-agnostic way here, and I'm actually using ReScript (a dialect of OCaml focused on the JavaScript ecosystem). But since the Haskell community probably has more experience with recursion schemes, I'm also asking here.
 In short, I'm writing a multi-stage compiler for a toy language, and I want to simplify folding and transforming my ASTs.
 Recursion schemes are perfect for this, but to use them I need to first "functorialize" my AST type, and then recover the concrete type by wrapping it into Fix. In ReScript syntax it looks like this:
 // "Functorialized" AST to allow recursion schemes inject custom data in place of nodes type exprF<'a> = Id(string) | Int(int) | Call(exprF<'a>, exprF<'a>) // Concrete expression type of arbitrary depth. // We add an extra wrapper to avoid defining it like 'type expr = exprF<expr>', // which would be self-referential and rejected by the compiler. type rec expr = Fix(exprF<expr>) 
 The problem is, of course, that I now need to insert that Fix wrapper everywhere when constructing expressions or pattern-matching on them:
 let testData = Fix(Call( Fix(Id("square")), Fix(Int(5)) ) 
 Is there a way to avoid doing this, or at least automate it? Does it require specific language features, like Haskell's HKTs or OCaml's [@@unboxed]?
 I'd appreciate any thoughts! There is a full example of defining a catamorphism recursion scheme in my linked post.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Near the end of the talk that introduces Shapeless 3, it's mentioned that shapeless3.typeable.Typeable is probably going to be removed because there's too much overlap with scala.reflect.Typeable. One feature that's unique to the Shapeless variant is the ability to convert a type to a string. If that's going to be removed, is there a more canonical way to do it in Scala 3? I haven't seen a way to do it with mirrors, but maybe I haven't looked hard enough. Rolling my own solution with macros is of course one somewhat cumbersome possibility.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have something on the order of 120 RSS/atom feeds for blogs, podcasts, YouTube channels. Since I started using Elfeed a few years ago, I've use cURL (i.e. had elfeed-use-curl set to t) as the feed-fetching function, but despite various tweaks (including some suggested here) updating elfeed always took at least 2 minutes, on average something like 4 minutes. And it would be quite resource intensive: CPU usage would jump up and my laptop fans would immediately start whirring.
    
 Recently, I tried to debug an issue relating to a podcast feed that kept failing to update, no matter how long I set elfeed-curl-timeout. I'd get the error (56) Failure in receiving network data. Going to a terminal and manually downloading the feed with cURL worked fine.
    
 I decided to switch elfeed-use-curl to nil to see if something was an issue. And incredibly, I found that the troublesome feed almost instantly updated. Updating all my feeds took a lot longer with much less resource usage.
    
 So ... is there possibly something else going on here, or is cURL less performant than url-retrieve, at least for large numbers of feeds? Can anyone else verify this?

It's been serving me well and I'm curious what people think of it and/or if anyone else may have a use for it. The code is currently part of a package with another purpose, but is package agnostic and doesn't depend on anything else in the package (or on anything outside of standard elisp constructs for that matter).
 My use case for it has been to keep track of token positions in buffers and efficiently determine the context for which to provide code intelligence. I needed an efficient data-structure that accommodates for localized "hot" access zones and doesn't use an insane amount of memory.

I spent half the night tweaking my Emacs configuration, digging through documentation, and adjusting settings in hopes of resolving the issue. I went down a lot of wrong paths before realizing that org-store-agenda-views doesn’t actually call ox-texinfo. That was my first mistake—not diving into the source code earlier.
 Turns out, the function calls org-agenda-write, which in turn executes something entirely different:

 trait Super { val a: Int val b: Boolean val c: Double } case class A extends Super case class B extends Super case class C extends Super case class D extends Super ... object Foo { def foo[T <: Super](bar: T): T } 
 let's assume T is an arbitrary case class with the attributes in Super and I want to be able to mutate those 3 fields in Foo.foo (by creating new instances with the mutated field). Assume I'm not in control of Super (it comes from a 3-rd party lib).
 Is there any way I can use the copy method available in case classes to mutate those 3 attributes? I have read copy is something the scala compiler creates on the fly and it is not really possible to override (doesn't come from Product or anything else). Any reasonable alternative to copy (or any way I can use copy?
 I thought about an implicit class over Super and adding a method to mutate it via copy, but it being a trait it does not have a copy method. I could create a new instance of Super with one or more of the fields mutated (as in new Super {...}), but that would force me to down-cast to one of the child case classes right after.

 Is there an option to display those two lines:
 1. Sched.272x: dentysta
 2. In 4 d.:weekly review - rules
 In another section like 'DOINGs', 'TODOs' etc.?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve been using company mode with lsp for C++ and Rust for a while. It worked fine. I use this on both Windows and Linux. Last week suddenly the completions became unusably slow on Windows. It stutters after every character. Completely unusable. This is now an issue with both Rust and C++ projects. Seems to be independent of the project size, as small projects are just as bad. Everything is fine on Linux.
 I am guessing it is some update, or some silly change in the environment. Anyone have any ideas? I tried updating packages, I upgraded to Emacs 29.4, updating windows. Nothing helped. Any suggestions for fixing this are super appreciated!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have pushed the first commit of a small Scala library that I used for several projects, and may be useful to someone else.
 If you ever need to use geographical points (with latitude and longitude) directly as keys you need to start playing some games as coordinates are floats, besides you sometimes want to aggregate with a certain resolution but later you may need a different one.
 I want to use modern libraries, and all the benefits of Scala 3, ergonomic is important too. I love the fact that Latitudes and Longitudes can not be swapped accidentally and all those little things.
 My biggest concern right now is that there many pieces (neotype, squats, Scalaz, even Cats) and maybe this can be simplified using Zio Prelude.
 It can be found here https://github.com/sisamon/geodesy_scala_3
 And this is the beginning of it, if you do not mind taking a look and providing some feedback I will appreciate it!

 I've been using Emacs since 1983 and I spend most of my day in it; I think I qualify as an extreme power user. I just went through my init file carefully. It's only a few screens long, and 95% of it consists of stuff like:

 Here are the only Tramp settings i'm using: 
 (require 'tramp)
 (setq tramp-ssh-controlmaster-options (format "-i %s" "~/.ssh/privatekey.pem"))
 (setq tramp-default-method "ssh") 
 I'm able to enter the server with the private key set this way, but if i try to to use sudo, i get 'permission denied (publickey)' error.
 I've tried different commands:
 (find-file "/ssh:ubuntu@123.23.1.22|sudo::/")
 (find-file "/ssh:ubuntu@123.23.1.22|sudo:ubuntu:/")
 (find-file "/ssh:ubuntu@123.23.1.22|sudo:ubuntu@123.23.1.22:/")
 (find-file "/sudo:ubuntu@123.23.1.22:/")
 Also tried to use 'tramp-revert-buffer-with-sudo' with these parameters '(add-to-list 'tramp-default-user-alist '("sudo" "123.23.1.22" "root"))' and without them. Nothing helps.

 https://sake92.github.io/squery/index.html
 How is it different from others?
  
raw SQL with a string interpolator, thin layer above JDBC, no DSLs
 synchronous only, no Future/IO/F[_] stuff
 context function used to propagate connection/transaction
 handling results is name-based unlike some other libraries. So you don't have to do tuples and _1, _2.. easy to make mistakes 
 composition is used for JOINs, so it’s much easier to extract the values
 has some nice helper functions for mapping flat results to structured objects
 
 has a code generator for table rows and CRUD DAOs. Very quick to get started
  
Mostly inspired by https://index.scala-lang.org/jodersky/simplesql and Doobie of course.

 I would like to replace every occurenc of "typ", which is not followed by and [e] with "Typ".
 I can do a regex-search for typ[^e] but when I use that, the fourth character is captured, thus a replace C-s M-r Typ[^e] M-% Typ will erroneouly replace typId as Typd (deleting the [I]) as it is captured.
 Without lookahead, behind, what is the Emacs way?
