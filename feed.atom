        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I know, that this was discussed some years ago, but this feature is one of those I would expect to be in haskell, when I was studying it, but it isn't. Considered example (https://wiki.haskell.org/Infix_expressions):  xs `zipWith (+)` ys  is not unique. What's about  a `sumMod m` b = (a + b) `mod` m  for addition by modulo m? I don't think this syntax sugar makes code more readable like using functions in infix mode in general. And I don't see any problems with misunderstanding it. Of course, if someone will right huge expression in infix mode it will be unreadable, but it can be said for a bad-styled code without any syntax sugar too. So I don't understand, why it's not implemented so, what's reason to restrict infix behavior to function names only?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It just so happened that all this Akka stuff happened the week before I needed to do the licensing & security talk in one of my other classes - a software development studio class taught in Java, but given I also teach a Scala unit I gravitate to talking about Scala stuff a lot.
 Anyway, here is my (waffly/uncertain/etc) take on trying to use the Akka licence change as a case study to explain to second year undergrads some of the social implications that get packed into that tiny line of sbt code "libraryDependencies += ..." (and the equivalent in gradle).
 https://echo360.net.au/media/b9b8b8c1-90c6-41a3-bf92-8426309a5cc5/public 
 With many thanks to everyone who's been discussing this so openly. And many apologies if I've mischaracterised anything - it's certainly not my intent to express "rights or wrongs" - the motivation here is that we have to teach our software classes about ethics and security, and this seemed a very interesting (and fairly accessible) case study to introduce that topic to a class where I've mostly been talking about code, testing, version control etc. Using a library that I taught some of the students last trimester.
 Posted also because it's an admission of why I've been replying in the comments more than usual on this even though I'm just some unheard-of academic in a small town - I had a class to write, so had to think about the topic more than usual last week.
 So this is me doing a first take on trying to introduce the social impacts of dependencies to a (small) Australian class. Feedback welcome, especially if I've mischaracterised anything so I can correct it for the future. [But even comments like "you really should stop saying 'kind of' as a verbal tic so often" welcome]
 (PS: I'll probably delete this reddit post after a month or two, so that years down the track, some old lecture of mine isn't lurking in public. Maybe sooner if it turns out I've accidentally made a big faux pas anywhere in here!)

 When I connected it asked me if I want to accept the servers fingerprint. And that was that, connected. I never connected to this machine before, so it certainly has no ssh keys from me. In fact the WSL I was doing this from didn't even have a ssh Gen generated. 
 Using Tramp in emacs with C-x C-f /ssh:x.y.z.ip:/ it asks me for a password. Problem is, I don't know the password.
 So, I tried generating a ssh key on my WSL machine and transfered it into /home/root/.ssh/authorized_keys, but that didn't help either. SIC! about the directory (although I don't not know if I did something wrong.)
 Does anyone know how to pull this off?

 I'm looking for some advice for the next steps in my career. I hope this will not be considered too off-topic.
 I entered the software industry in July 2021, so a little over a year ago, after doing a full-stack bootcamp based on Java 7. Totally OOP-ish apart from some Java 8 taught at the end of it.
 Funnily enough, while still doing the bootcamp something drew me into researching more about FP. I started reading SICP, and changed from Vim to Doom Emacs thinking I would be forced to learn some Lisp. And I remember reading these discussions about monads and stuff I was really far from understanding at the time.
 My first job was actually as an OutSystems low-code developer, for... reasons. However, around September 2021, I decided I would learn Haskell, in my own free time. I k…]]></summary>

 I am wrapping some FFI code, by writing classes where the methods map directly to the imported functions, for which bindings and instances are generated. 
 Some of the functions are for managing and converting foreign arrays. In particular the functions for creating the foreign arrays have the (slightly simplified) form newArray pointerToValues dim0 dim1 dim2 ... dimN so the number of dim arguments differs depending on the dimensionality of the array. 
 Now, one way to solve this is to generate a 'uncurried' version of that function and giving the dimensions as a tuple, but I want to maintain a minimal amount of generated code, and like the idea of mapping methods directly to the imported functions.

 ​
 I use emacs but im not very advanced but my initial reaction to this tweet was think it was bs and that the professor wasn't very experienced in emacs. I didn't know he was a professor until after I responded. he said he's been using emacs for 23 years. I asked him what made him believe that and he said that in vscode he can install extensions that resemble the functionality he was use to in emacs.
 ​
 if you have used both emacs and vscode is this true? is he not as experienced despite all the years he has used emacs?

In my desperation I am now firing up X just to run emacs with the GUI in order to ease into it, which just goes right up my crack, because the whole point is to get away from ever using the @!(#*#& mouse again.

I received help and advice from many talented colleagues on Tweag’s Nix Slack channel during this process.
Nix is a package manager with a focus on reproducible, declarative and reliable packages.
Nixpkgs is an enormous collection of software packages that can be installed with the Nix package manager.
Due to the way Nix works, all packages must define precisely all of their dependencies (their dependency closure) down to the operating system’s kernel.
This rigor-by-design with respect to dependencies is what makes Nix packages highly reproducible, and as a side effect, it gives us a fantastic dataset: the full dependency network that the more th…]]></summary>

 Previous TODOs from days before show up, just not new ones. If I put a TODO in a day before it broke, it works and shows up. It is just the last two days oddly that don't work. They are all in the same directory, and named with the same convention. 
 I still have (setq org-agenda-files '("~/org-roam/daily")) in my init.el and have not changed it. The directory is correct. 
 The value for org-scheduled-delay-days is 0, so it isn't that either.

 Is there any way to define q2a without invoking undefined/error/etc that doesn't result in an incomplete pattern match?
 P 'Z is stuck, and P is closed, so I don't know how we could ever have an equality constraint that makes it equal to 'Z. Similarly, we can't construct a singleton SN (P 'Z). But I'm not sure how to convince GHC of this fact. I expected q2a to work, but GHC thinks we are missing some case branches.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is a little hard to discuss because emacs and tmux use the term 'window' differently, but in tmux the window is basically your full terminal. So, your terminal might have 6 'panes' across 2 'windows' in a session, with one window containing 2 panes and the other four in a second window. Rather than be in separate floating program windows in your DE though, tmux windows are not visible until you cycle to them. So your setup might look like:
  ________________ _________________ | | | | | | | | | | vim | node | | st | python | -> :next-window -> |________|________| | | | | | | | | | | watch | ranger | |_______|________| |________|________| 
 Is there any way to get this functionality (multiple buffers laid out in different ways in one wm box that can be cycled through) in emacs? (I'm focusing on the GUI version of emacs for now, not particularly interested in running emacs inside tmux at the moment)
 edit: another thing I'm looking for is the ability to toggle 'zoom' an emacs window to fullscreen and back to its place, which I believe is 'c-b z' in tmux

emacs: GNU Emacs 29.0.50

I'm using zsh with xfce4-terminal. 
 My OS prompt is configured using the powerlevel10k theme.
 I have 2 separate configurations for p01k, one for my OS and one for inside emacs. This is copied verbatim from the vterm repo 
 My .zshrc vterm configuration
 I believe it's working because I can see visually that it's different from my OS terminal and when I run p10k configurein an emacs vterm buffer, it prompts to save to bin/p10.emacs.zsh
 The main difference i those 2 p10k configs is that the one for emacs has no prompt on the right hand side - I've given up all hope of getting it to work in vterm. 
 vterm is working but there's one problem. The unicode glyphs in the prompts look different.
  
OS prompt example
 vterm prompt example 
 It appears as if the line height in emacs is a taller than the font size. There is an unappealing strip of background colour above the font making it look as if the glyphs don't align. Whereas they match perfectly in the OS terminal. 
 Any ideas for how I can fix this so that they look the same and I can have an aesthetically pleasing prompt in vterm?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am learning about IO exception handling of Haskell currrently, and I found there are two relatived modules: Control.Exception and Exception. Both modules define error handling functions like try, handle and catch, and the later one has more specific function for IOError: handleIO, catchIO and tryIO. I am curious about them and want to see their documents. While I can easily find Control.Exception's module by Google, I cannot find the module Exception's. I have tried out several searching keywords but none of them brought me meaningful results.
 P.S. I was also wondering why there are two modules for error handling, what are histories behind them?

 TLDR: I would like to continue my learning journey, replacing a Rest Service with a new library in order to get experience with Scala, I don't know if Akka HTTP worth with their new license change.
 I'm a software developer with almost 4 years of experience, I've been developing on Python for the latest years, working on data gathering & cleaning, a little bit of machine learning, and some Rest Services with FastAPI.
 Since some couple of months I've been using Spark (Mostly DataFrames) for processing, Since then I fall in love with Scala and Functional Programming in general, I can not see the opportunity to implement high order functions, recursion, pattern matching in everywhere (I think even the way I think problem-solving have change).
 I've taken the Scala & FP Essentials  and Spark Essentials with Scala from RockTheJVM and I absolutely loved! 
 Now I'm feeling that I would like to switch my career more orientated into Scala and functional programming, I feel I could improve some of the Rest Services in my current job replacing it with Scala, but I haven't seen a roadmap or something like that to use it for learning purpose. 
 I was reading about Akka Http, but I don't know if does it worth to learn with new changes on their license (TBH, I'm only understanding that will be oriented in business), which library or framework should I learn? In my current job there is no tech team behind to report so I could choose whatever stack as long it is free to use. 
 Thank you for your advices and reading this post!

 Context
 The task is to write a function that takes a list of any type of element and shuffles it by first taking every other element and then repeating it on the rest of the list. For example given the list [0,1,2,3,4,5,6] should output [0,2,4,6,1,5,3].

 Actually, my package name is a bit long with the ext.domain.project model but I am worried by potential name clashes.

I’ve recently come across a well known and influential book on historical method from the late 1800s that has well described version of the slip (box) method.
Originally published in French in 1897 as Introduction aux études historiques and then translated into English by George Godfrey Berry, Henry Holt and Company published Introduction to the Study of History in 1898 by authors Charles Victor Langlois and Charles Seignobos.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was playing with the Brick terminal UI library and hit an interesting hurdle. Roughly, brick represents the program logic as two functions Event -> State -> IO State and State -> Image.
 I have some non-trivial IO (loading and parsing files, possibly transitively) which should not block key inputs. We can launch some async IO and send the results into an event queue which Brick reads from. But it is really annoying:
  
The update function must know which async resources to load, duplicating parts of the rendering logic
 The update function must track which resources are already loaded
 The update function must track which requests are in-flight, or have failed
 Optionally, the update function may have to cancel requests that are no longer needed
  
That's quite a bit of complexity for a simple update function! My approach so far has been Haxl-like. There is a function CoreState -> IO AppState which is run after every event is processed, and it re-loads all resources. Requests are represented by a GADT, and cached in an MVar wrapped map. A functionsend :: MonadAsync r m => r a -> m (Maybe a) retrieves the existing result, or starts a new request unless one is in flight. When a request finishes this queues an event so Brick updates.
 This solves some of the complexity issues but still feels kind of ad-hoc. Shouldn't Haskell be better at this sort of thing? Is there some existing approach to this?
 The only idea I had so far is some kind of declarative IO. The render function produces an Image, and the frame-work diffs images and produces some imperative commands to synchronize the world. Maybe the render function also could produce a sort-of free-monad trace, the trace is diffed, and the framework performs some imperative steps to ensure the minimal necessary requests are performed? But for diffing to work trace would have to contain which case-statement branches were taken, not sure how to do that without compiler support.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I've been learning haskell through multiple sources (one being a free online course) and I've gotten to learning about monoids. However, I'm still struggling a bit on understanding typeclasses.
 I understand a typeclass is similar to, say, an interface in Java or c#, in that typeclasses can be used to define things that work for all classes that define an instance for said class (similar to implementing an interface). But I don't fully understand how the type signatures work, or when to use a vs b in polymorphic signatures. 
 For example, I can define a typeclass
  class Foo a where prev :: a -> a next :: a -> a 
 But I don't understand how that would differ from the same typeclass defined as:
 class Foo a where prev :: a -> b next :: b -> a 
 To put this another way, I'm fairly sure I understand the theory, but I don't know how to apply it very well.
 (All that said, I'm loving my time with learning haskell. Such a great language.)

 I've just tried dumping my Emacs after it loads packages and is configured.
 Like this:
  emacs --batch -l ~/.emacs -eval '(dump-emacs-portable "emacs.dump")' 
 Then I start my already configured Emacs:
  emacs -q --dump-file emacs.dump 
 Emacs starts a lot faster this way.
 Why are we Emacs users not taking advantage of this? Or this is well known already?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At the beginning of 2022, we decided to get rid of Akka at work and built our own alternative to the last bit of Akka that didn't have a good alternative: sharding (more details on our motivations and architecture choices in a talk I'm planning to do later this year).
 After 6 months in production we decided to release it as an open source library called Shardcake: https://github.com/devsisters/shardcake (it was coincidentally made public a few hours before the Akka licence change announcement).
 In a nutshell, Shardcake makes it easy to distribute entities across multiple servers and interact with those entities using their ID without knowing their actual location (the entity behavior and persistence is entirely up to you, the library only takes care of the distribution and messaging). It exposes a purely functional API based on ZIO. It was designed to be simple to use, lightweight (unlike Akka, nodes do not form a cluster) and customizable: you can change the messaging protocol, the serialization, the storage layer as well as the source of truth for pod's health.
 It's been working great for us, so I hope others find it useful!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I've been working on my hobby programming language and there's three things I want to write for it: a type checker, type inference, and a program synthesizer. While writing each of these I realized there was a lot of similarity in the code to the point that it almost felt like the same thing three times. I realized if I was working in Prolog I could probably express this as typed(term, type, errorList) and then I could get supply a term and a type to see if if type checks, a term and an empty error list to infer the type, and a type and an empty error list to get program synthesis. It would be nice to be able to express this relation in Haskell with a similar style and elegance but I'm not sure if it's possible since I'm not sure if I can do logic programming with similar levels of optimizations in Haskell. logict doesn't seem to do any kind of optimization and I'm guessing this would make my code unusable in practice.
 Is my assumption that logic programming without optimizations is unusable in practice correct? Does anyone know if it's possible to do logic programming in Haskell that has performance comparable to Prolog?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm creating a latex document in japanese with lots of furigana and some footnotes. The command to create the kanji with footnote is \edtext{\ruby{kanji}{reading}}{\Afootnote{meaning}, where kanji, reading and meaning are my inputs.
 ​
 Is there any way to quickly create them? Yasnippets doesn't seem to work well since I use three different input-modes, japanese for the kanji, japanese-hiragana for the reading and nil for the meaning.
 ​
 I created the following function:
 (defun jane/latex-footnote () (interactive) (let ((my-input current-input-method)) (set-input-method 'japanese) (let ((kanji (read-string "What's the kanji: " nil nil nil t))) (set-input-method 'japanese-hiragana) (let ((reading (read-string "What's the reading: " nil nil nil t)) (footnote (read-string "What's the footnote: "))) (insert (concat "\\edtext\{\\ruby\{" kanji "\}\{" reading "\}\}\{\\Afootnote\{" footnote "\}")))) (set-input-method my-input))) 
 It does work, but I do need to type the kanji twice. Once for the kanji, and twice for it's reading. Is there any way to improve my function?

 Lacking real-world resources has often been acknowledged in this community. Although we've come a long way, there's still a lot of room for improvement.
 For a while I've been thinking of starting a movement of sorts to help collect and organize various Haskell patterns and tricks from the real world. Harnessing the full power of my originality, I've decided to name it the "Practical Haskell Bits" initiative.
 More details in the blog post:
 https://dnikolovv.github.io/practical-haskell-bits-initiative/
 repository
 This is still a "proof of concept" idea and I'm not really sure where it'll end up. Nonetheless it seems worth thinking about.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all! Whenever I try to load a .beancount file (plain text accounting, similar to ledger) I get this error: error "Lisp nesting exceeds ‘max-lisp-eval-depth’". Here is my usual workflow: first of all I load the beancont.el file (the mode isn't available on melpa) with load-file, and I get this: Loading /home/sgrc31/personal/finanze/beancount-mode/beancount.el (source)...done ,then if I try to load my "main.beancount" file i get the aforementioned error.
 Here is the backtrace: https://pastebin.com/pQ9c5MA2
 \ I already tried to start emacs without my config (with the -q switch), but the problem persisted. It may also help to say that I used beancount mode without any issue for several months, and all of a sudden this problem occured 3 weeks ago. This morning I updated all my packages and cloned the beancount mode repo afresh, but nothing changed. How can I fix this? Thanks for your time

 I use emacs in linux and win10 as well.
 I would like to discuss about win10 deploy, because I should install:
 - a release from here: https://github.com/kiennq/emacs-build
 - a release from the gitforwindows: https://git-scm.com/download/win
 because the magit handle itt well (emacsclient not found problem if I use msys2 package)
 - deploy the msys2 and install: diffutils, ripgrep and it is necessary for the dired and ripgrep-mode, consult ...
 - I should clone my configuration from github and start emacs and clone the mode's repositories (I use straight ...)
 - I have to set the PATH and HOME envvars
 So it is not easy to deploy to a new computer.
 My question is that do you know any project or manual description about how I can copy these ones to a directory and create a zip file what I can download and unzip and it works what I want ? :)
 I can make this folder I have idea but I just would like to know is there any project about this ... ?
 My plan is roughly that I will copy everything to the .emacs.d folder and create a powershell script to set the $Env:vars ...
 folders:
 - ~/.emacs.d/bin/emacs.exe|emacslient.exe|runemacs.exe|git.exe ...
 - ~/.emacs.d/mingw64/bin ...
 - ~/.emacs.d/usr/...
 - ~/.emacs.d/straight/repo|build ...
 - ~/.emacs.d/install.ps1

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Consider memoization. A monomorphic top level definition will be evaluated only once over the bustle of a program. So, one can retain the values of an expensive function in a top level map, so that they do not need to be recomputed: memory ∷ Map Int Int memory = Map.fromSet expensiveFunction domain However, this polymorphic variant will be evaluated many times — the values will not be retained: memory ∷ Num α ⇒ Map α α memory = Map.fromSet expensiveFunction domain This polymorphic definition can be specialized by the compiler for‍ some special cases that can then be retained. Memoization will work only when this specialization is performed. So, disabling optimizations will spell death to a program that relies on memoization of a polymorphic function. Are there any other examples of compiler optimizations changing asymptotic complexity? * * * P. S. See also an example of how inlining affects memoization nearby.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I have a Scala object that calls other Scala objects. When we run our unit tests they fail due to our Logger object not being properly initialized. Ideally, I would just mock out the Logger, but I am not sure how I can do this since I am testing an object which has no constructor to provide dependency injection and what I need to mock is itself an object. I am completely new to Scala and very unfamiliar with unit testing with Scala. I know Scala objects are basically static classes / singletons which do not lend themselves to being unit testable. However, I am currently tasked with writing unit tests for a bunch of Scala code our team was given. Is this even possible to do without re-writing the existing code to be classes rather than objects?
 object MyObject { def myMethod() : Unit { // do some stuff Logger.logInfo("Some message") // Logger is also a Scala object } }

 For example, I am using emmet-mode in emacs which allows you to write snippets for the web then expand them after writing.
 I'm wondering if there is a way to write custom snippets like this.

 ​
 This is more of a random question as I try out various Modal editing schemes. I currently use Meow and While I enjoy it I will be trying Xah fly keys soon as well. 
 ​
 In regards to Meow (or even boon) how worried should i be of the project being unmaintained and my keybindings one day breaking. Should I move towards evil stuff or is this really just overthinking things. for example I know God-mode was depreciated.
 ​
 TL:DR: should i worry about alternate modal editing styles maybe eventually being depreciated, or is it overthinking?

 I'm currently looking for alternatives. I heard a lot about zio and typelevel, but I was hesitant to switch over because they seemed overly complicated. I'm talking about for maintenance, stability, and hiring purposes--not for learning (I used to geek out on Haskell before I learned there was a difference between writing something as a hobby project and writing something for industry).
 Has anyone used these libraries in production at a large scale? What are your recommendations?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I love both evil and isearch. However, I have a hard time combining evil operator keys (e.g., d c y) with isearch. 
 ​
 When I call isearch in the evil operator state, the operator states quits before isearch activates -- the cursor point is indeed jumped, but the operation is NOT completed. For example, when I pressed "d c-s abc", the operator state quits first, and then the cursor moves to "abc". The content between my old point (before the search) and "abc" is not deleted. (I don't encounter this issue when I combine the v key for visual selection with isearch)
 ​
 Does any one have any idea how to fix this issue?
 ​
 P.s., if it matters, I am on emacs 28 + doom.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sam Derbyshire has a cool type-checking plugin called if-instance that lets you branch on whether a constraint is satisfied with the following interface:
 -- 'IsSat cls' returns True if 'cls' is satisfied, and False otherwise. type IsSat :: Constraint -> Bool -- | 'dispatch @cls₁ @cls₂ a b' returns 'a' if the constraint 'cls₁' is satisfied, -- otherwise 'b'. type (||) :: Constraint -> Constraint -> Constraint class cls₁ || cls₂ where dispatch :: (cls₁ => IsSat cls₁ ~ True => a) -> (cls₂ => IsSat cls₁ ~ False => IsSat cls₂ ~ True => a) -> a type IfSat :: Constraint -> Constraint type IfSat cls = cls || () -- 'ifSat @cls a b' returns 'a' if the constraint 'cls' is satisfied, and 'b' otherwise. ifSat :: IfSat cls => (IsSat cls ~ True => cls => a) -> (IsSat cls ~ False => a) -> a 
 Now the catch is, anyone can add an instance at any point because of the open-world assumption and this will change the behaviour of your program if the branches are functionally different. This plugin basically goes against the design of type classes but sometimes that is what we want. One safe use of this technique is to branch on extra-functional properties such as space, time, energy like choosing HashSet a if Hashable a is satisfied.
 But let's not only stick to safe use cases, what application can you think of for this plugin??

 Previous TODOs from days before show up, just not new ones. If I put a TODO in a day before it broke, it works and shows up. It is just the last two days oddly that don't work. They are all in the same directory, and named with the same convention. 
 I still have (setq org-agenda-files '("~/org-roam/daily")) in my init.el and have not changed it. The directory is correct.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've had luck binding ESC to keyboard-quit everywhere except in terminal sessions with the following line: 
 (when (display-graphic-p) (define-key key-translation-map (kbd "ESC") (kbd "C-g")) 
 But recently I've started making more regular use of the daemon and this hasn't worked really anymore. (From what I understand, upon first starting the server, display-graphic-p returns nil.)
 The workaround that seems to be doing the trick is to add the above to server-after-make-frame-hook. (I tried adding the above to after-init-hook but it doesn't seem to work, and some poking around suggests that when the functions in after-init-hook are run when the server starts, display-graphic-p also returns nil.)
 Now, there are other things I want to run only when starting a new GUI session, so I've kept on adding things to server-after-make-frame-hook. 
 Not knowing very much about the way all of this works, I keep thinking this is inefficient. For it seems that server-after-make-frame-hook gets called more often than just when I start what, on my end, looks like a new session: calling magit-commit, for example, will run all of the functions in that hook. 
 So, what I'm looking for is some tips on how to activate some bits of my config in all and only the following circumstances: when a new GUI frame is opened but no other GUI frames are. 
 One solution I would be happy with, but which I cannot figure out how to create, is to have a GUI dedicated daemon and another daemon, if needed, for terminal sessions. I'd then need to have a way of triggering some bits of my config only when the dedicated GUI daemon starts. 
 Sorry if this a bit muddled. As I write this I suspect I'm confused about something, I just don't quite know what it is!

On a given type constructor of the appropriate kind, there is at most one Functor instance and it can be derived automatically. There is no analog of this for Applicatives.
More recursive definitions by Joachim Breitner
Haskell is a pure and lazy programming language, and the laziness allows us to write some algorithms very elegantly, by recursively referring to already calculated values.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have for a while been wondering how I can get an overview of my org-journal entries. I would like to list all entries say for the last two months.
 Here is a way to do it: customize org-journal-search to do regexp search instead of plain string search.
 (customize-set-variable 'org-journal-search-forward-fn 're-search-forward) 
 Then one can search for all entries for the last two months by executing
 M-x org-journal-search giving search string "^\*\* " and starting date -2m and end date the empty string (just hit return).
 Something to be aware of is that if one gives org-journal-search an empty search string, it will search for "** " which will not work as intended with regexp search. It is probably not a good idea to change the variable org-journal-time-prefix which defines that string. Just avoid entering an empty search string.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I whipped up this function to save all buffers in the current project, e.g. before executing a compile/test command:
 (defun ct/project-save-all-buffers (&optional proj arg) "Save all file-visiting buffers in PROJ without asking. Falls back to `project-current' if PROJ is not specified." (let* ((proj (or proj (project-current))) (buffers (project-buffers (project-current)))) (dolist (buf buffers) ;; Act on base buffer of indirect buffers, if needed. (with-current-buffer (or (buffer-base-buffer buf) buf) (when (and (buffer-file-name buf) ; Ignore all non-file-visiting buffers. (buffer-modified-p buf)) ; Ignore all unchanged buffers. (let ((buffer-save-without-query t)) ; Save silently. (save-buffer arg))))))) 
 The filter for file-visiting buffers and getting the base buffer for indirect buffers was added thanks to /u/whhone sharing a function in: https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/u09yf9/ignore_save_if_buffer_isnt_visiting_a_file/
 Alternatives that are simpler: override asking to save before compiling:
 (let ((compilation-ask-about-save nil)) (my compilation command here)) 
 But that would save all modified buffers unconditionally. Similarly, you could call:
 (save-some-buffers t) ; Save without asking (my compilation command here) 
 What if you don't want to save changes to, say, some .org file that you edited in the meantime?
 I prefer to be asked for unrelated files, so I added my function above and call it in this sequence:
 (ct/project-save-all-buffers) (my compilation command here) 
 Feedback welcome, and enjoy the function if you need it! Didn't find something like it for some reason.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I like completion frameworks on the featureful/heavy-weight side a lot. I use helm and use helm actions heavily to accomplish things within a completion session (e.g. moving files, grepping). However, the more I use it, the more I think: it would be much better if it's a full dired!
 I like the multiple column view of `helm-buffers-list`. It in fact just imitates the native `list-buffers`, but in a pretty hacky way (it use spaces to pad each completion items to make it look like a table). I've written my own `describe-functions` and `describe-variables` sources that uses similar hack to give me a column of function argument list/variable value and documentation. It would be much better if we just use `tabulated-list-mode`, or some blend of it and the native `*Apropos*` buffer!
 In general I feel like lots of functionalities are implemented twice, once as a "feature-full" package, once as a simplified version in helm.
 My question is then: Is there any completion framework based on the idea of wrapping "feature-full" package out there? Do you think this is a sensible idea?
 I haven't looked much into other popular completion frameworks (ivy, vertico, etc), because I get the impression that they're typically at the more "light-weight" side of helm so are probably not what I want. Feel free to correct me.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are very happy to announce the release of Copilot 3.11. Copilot is a runtime verification system implemented as a Haskell DSL that generates hard-realtime C99. You can learn more about it at [1].
 Copilot 3.11 introduces a new library, copilot-interpreter, that isolates all functions related to simulation of Copilot specifications. The release also contains a number of bug fixes, provides a simplified API, deprecates outdated elements, removes unused code, and introduces support for GHC 9.2. A full list of changes merged is available at [2].
 A substantial effort is being made to achieve NASA's Class D software classification, most notably in terms of development process (which you can partly witness in how issues and PRs are being handled on our github repo), test coverage (mostly with quickcheck), and proofs of correctness of the generated code (with what4).
 Copilot is being used by the Safety-Critical Avionics Systems Branch (D320) of NASA Langley Research Center to conduct experiments related to flight safety of aerial vehicles. We have also built Ogma [3], a tool that allows us to generate full monitoring applications (e.g., NASA's Core Flight System [4] and Robot Operating System [5] applications) from requirements in structured natural language.
 We invite you all to explore Copilot, to try it, and to extend it. If you like it, please help us draw attention to this work with a star on github or a mention online.
 Happy Haskelling,
 The Copilot Team

The first example "divides 5 7" doesn't work on GHCI when I type it.

that begets composable software which can be reasoned about and avails
itself to static analysis. These are all “good things” for helping us
build robust software, which inevitably lead us to using languages such
as Haskell, OCaml and Rust. However, it would be remiss of us to snub
languages that don’t enforce the same disciplines, but are nonetheless
popular choices in industry. Ivory towers are lonely places, after all.
In this series of articles, I will discuss how some of the principles
and techniques learnt from typed functional languages can be applied to
Python1 to achieve the same results. We’ll see that, while Python
famously eschews the functional paradigm, we can build

 I'm following this page: https://www.orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/languages/ob-doc-scheme.html to get scheme running in babel but I can't make it work.
 This is my config:
 (use-package geiser) (use-package geiser-mit) (setq geiser-active-implementations '(mit)) (org-babel-do-load-languages 'org-babel-load-languages '((scheme . t))) 
 And this is the org file:
 #+header: :session #+begin_src scheme (+ 1 1) #+end_src 
 when i hit C-c C-c in the block i get "Code block evaluation complete" in the echo area but no results under the #+RESULTS: and i'm redirected to the geiser REPL the first time (i don't kill this buffer i just switch to the org buffer after it), i also get a buffer *Geiser Messages* whith the following content:
 ​ ERROR: <1>: continuation failed "(geiser:eval '#f '(begin ;; -- geiser-scheme-implementation: mit -- (+ 1 1) ))" (error Selecting deleted buffer) 
 Does anyone now how can i solve this problem? 
 PS: I'm using emacs 28.1 with org-mode version 9.5.5 and the geiser REPL works correctly when i run M-x geiser

 Hello, I do a lot of data analysis and visualization, for which literate programming is an exceptionally good paradigm. I mostly use org-babel and ESS-R in Spacemacs, but am recently making another run at trying Clojure.
 I've been able to get a lein project up and running with an org mode document and it does a fine job executing chunks and outputting text and data tables, but I can't seem to get it to output in-line graphics links automatically.
 Here's some demo code that seems like it should work:

 Long-time (30+ years) emacs user but not a programmer so can only do simple elisp functions. I use ediff all the time and have ediff-diff-options set to -wBb. This works most of the time but I've gotten burned diff-ing some Python scripts and the occasional makefile since whitespace matters there. Anyone have some code that would automatically change ediff-diff-options based on the buffer mode? I guess that means it would have to be a local setting.
 Thanks for any pointers / ideas!

I find it very confusing and hard for these first days. Can someone recomend to me some good videos for scala/play framework. Also I’m a lot confused by feature, map, imutability of everything, and json as well. I’m used to just sending json object, but in scala that doesn’t work when something is feature. In summary I’m confused about everything as hell, so any kind of help would be great. Project is small but since I’m new to this language every new line I write I got some problems and I don’t know how to solve them.

 I'd intended it to fill the more advanced than org-agenda search, C-c a s niche.
 But it's fast and accurate enough that I now almost exclusively use this to search through my (120K+ lines of) org-mode notes. Hopefully some of you folks find it useful too 😇
 Features: Fast, Natural Language, Open Source, Private and Incremental
 Quickstart: pip install khoj-assistant && khoj

I post now because I can't find definite answers.
For the longest time I have been adamant in trying to make my Zettelkasten work in my profession and so far I've been using it to:
But I just feel like I haven't truly gotten the potential output I can get from the system.
I know that Zettelkasten is geared towards writing and not necessarily visual output but I just want to ask advice on how to implement the system to maximize output for non-writing purposes. Am I doing something wrong or am I applying Zettelkasten to something it wasn't meant to do?
Looking forward to interacting with all you more (hopefully, my introversion won't get the better of me.)]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello. I have noticed a strange behavior in Emacs when setting the default font:
 I noticed that when using set-face-attribute, the font gets overridden. I tried with a blank init file and I discovered that it happens due to the line (require 'use-package). If I call set-face-attribute before that line, everything is ok, but if I call it afterwards, the font gets overridden to the default font of the system.
 Moreover, if I use (add-to-list 'default-frame-alist '(font . "FONT")), everything works just fine, regardless of where I declare it.
 Anyone knows why this happens? 
 I have noticed that David Wilson from System Crafters calls (require 'use-package) and sets the font by set-face-attribute later with no issues, so I don't know why my system behaves otherwise.
 By the way, I get the same behavior in Kubuntu and in Windows 10.
 Thanks in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My girlfriend has no computer or even programming background, and the only time she needs to write some programs is to write a little bit statistical analysis code in R. Basically, she just copy-paste from the Internet, and she even struggles to write a for loop. 
 But recently, she saw that I use orgmode, and very interested in the integrated smooth workflow of using orgmode for GTD+note-taking seamlessly. Now I am ready to bring my girlfriend into this hole, but now I have several problems as follows.
  
My girlfriend uses a windows computer, and I have not used a windows computer for six or seven years except to play games, so I don't know how to configure it under windows at all. emacs is known to have a relatively average experience under windows.
 
I am using doom emacs, except for the most basic operations such as C-bpfnaehk which are adapted by macOS as global shortcuts, I do not know the native shortcuts of emacs at all. My girlfriend had a slight experience with vim, mainly because I introduced her the vim mode in rstudio, she knows yiw, ci} stuffs like basic operation, but she usually mainly uses office, vim mode is just rarely used, and not skilled.
 So if I introduce it to the pit, I'm not sure to introduce her to install the classic vanilla emacs (surely a distribution that uses vanilla keybindings, such as centaur? or the vanilla version of doom?) Do you guys think it's better to let someone who knows a little bit about vim but is not very skilled use vim mode, or let her learn emacs' weird ancient vanilla shortcuts?
 
Finally, a broad context question, do you guys have any suggestions for smoothing out the introductory curve for someone with little computer background (or even little programming background) to use emacs?
 
 Thanks for your help and I would be much appreciated it for any help and advice!

 and I'm trying to get it to do ligature functionality with Operator Mono adapted for ligatures. I've been following the FiraCode instructions, but they should do pretty much the same thing.
 The problem is whenever I start a new instance of Emacs, it doesn't render in the operator mono ligature font at first, it goes to another one. When I specify regular operator mono in the menu, it renders, saves, and new instances load just fine. The ligature operator mono, renders perfectly with the ligatures if I if set the default font in the menu, but new instances of emacs don't load the font.
 The emacs --debug-init returned literally nothing.

 Please be nice as I'm new to emacs

 I have 700+ note files, and agenda was taking a bit of time so I decided to optimize it. This is what I set my org-agenda-files to:
  (defun dm/get-active-agenda-files () (let* ((shell-output (shell-command-to-string (format "ag -l -r '\\*\\s+TODO' %s |grep -v 'archive' | grep '\\.org$'" org-roam-directory)))) (split-string (substring shell-output 0 (- (length shell-output) 1)) "\n"))) 
 Not sure why I'm using both ag and grep, but essentially listing all of the files that have a * TODO in them as well as an .org extension.
 It's been working well and has improved my agenda performance. 
 I am hitting some weird edge cases though. Specifically, not all :ID:s are being resolved now. Is it because not all my notes are part of org-agenda-files?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Emacs Mac port is YAMAMOTO Mitsuharu's Mac port of GNU Emacs.
 I have been trying to use doc-view on djvu files which resulted in this traceback (I have trimmed it down for relevant informations)
 Debugger entered--Lisp error: (wrong-number-of-arguments (3 . 3) 1) doc-view-multiplex-conversion(...) doc-view-djvu->tiff-converter-ddjvu(...) ... 
 Where I found the procedure in question is doc-view-djvu->tiff-converter-ddjvu, with an ill-defined form:
 (defun doc-view-djvu->tiff-converter-ddjvu (djvu tiff page callback) "Convert PAGE of a DJVU file to bitmap(s) asynchronously. Call CALLBACK with no arguments when done. If PAGE is nil, convert the whole document." (doc-view-multiplex-conversion (lambda (tiff callback &optional resolution) (doc-view-start-process "djvu->tiff" "ddjvu" `("-format=tiff" ;; ddjvu only accepts the range 1-999. ,(format "-scale=%d" (round (or resolution doc-view-resolution))) ;; -eachpage was only added after djvulibre-3.5.25.3! ,@(unless page '("-eachpage")) ,@(if page `(,(format "-page=%d" page))) ,djvu ,tiff) callback) tiff callback))) 
 The problem is that tiff callback are enclosed within the lambda and not part of the funcall to doc-view-multiplex-conversion. Applying this change fixes the problem for me.
 Interestingly, upon checking the [https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs/blob/emacs-28/lisp/doc-view.el](doc-view file) at emacs 28 github mirror, they are slightly different definitions, where the mac-port has wrapped it with doc-view-multiplex-conversion.
 Naturally I could not find any place to raise this issue. Because firstly, I am not very used to usingreport-emacs-bug and the mailing list. Secondly, this is related to Emacs mac port not exactly Emacs (see my point just above). So here I am, wonder what actions I could take to make this get noticed and fixed.

 This tool is inspired by article : Global interactive Emacs functions. It provides an idea to run Emacs functions outside of Emacs.
 So I try to use this idea to wrtie a tool like lauchbar or Alfred. It can help user to quickly lauch app or run work flow.
 I’m using it to replace the lauchbar.
 Pros and cons
 This tool has some pros and cons, and I think if you have the following needs, you can try to use it :
  
you don’t want to pay for other tools like lauchbar or Alfred.
 you wish some function in Emacs could run out of Emacs.
 You’re familiar with Emacs, there are some plugins, and custom functions that you want to reuse.
 You don’t want to learn a new language or workflow of a new software
 …
  
Pros

 ​
  def resultsfunc() = { val gradeRegex = "^Class 5\." val currRegex = "\.NCERT$" DB.withConnection{ implicit c => val filterQuery = SQL( """ select * from tbl_graphs where graph_name REGEXP '{grade_regex}' and graph_name REGEXP '{curr_regex}' and org_id = 4 """) .on("grade_regex" -> gradeRegex, "curr_regex" -> currRegex) filterQuery().map{ graphRecord => new ResultObj(graphRecord[Long]("id"), graphRecord[String]("name")) }.toList } } 
 ​
 I don't get any errors but I get empty result even though there are multiple records that match the pattern. The same query works if I try to run in mysql workbench and when I tried to print `filterQuery` the arguments were also mapped correctly.
 ​
 Should Pattern matching with regex must be carried out differently in Scala Anorm ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A while ago I discovered that my emacs was hanging when trying to edit tables in org-mode. I did some investigation, created a stackoverflow issue (https://emacs.stackexchange.com/q/72769/38541), got help from the org-mode mailing list and eventually created a bug in the evil-repository for what I guess is the root issue for the behaviour (https://github.com/emacs-evil/evil/issues/1642).
 It's been a bit more than a month now, and nothing has happened, yet the problem persist for me, even with the latest versions of evil and org-mode. However I can imagine that a lot of users use both, evil and tables in org-mode. And as a consequence, more people should stumble upon "my" issue and report or support it. So that makes me wonder if there is indeed something wrong in my configuration.
 As you can see in the stackoverflow issue, there is not a lot minimal configuration needed to reproduce the issue. But could there be any other package, configuration, switch, whatsoever that I could add in my configuration that would solve the issue?
 So my question is: Am I missing something here? Is this actually a problem on my side? Or do other people suffer the same problem, but it has not caught traction yet?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At the end of a work week I like to review the week and as I store my journal entries in separate files, one per day, I find myself jumping between files a lot.
 I really do like keeping the setup with one file per day, so I wonder if there's a way to open multiple org files in a single buffer?
 A writable buffer where changes end up in the correct file would be perfect, but a read-only buffer would be more than acceptable.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[EDIT / CLARIFICATION: This question is not intended to be about programmatically sorting a list of filenames, but is rather a quest to find an Emacs library / package that facilitates a user to manually rearrange a list of filenames in an arbitrary order and then return the modified list as a result.
 I'm using pdftk to combine various PDF files, and am looking for a mechanism to assist in manually choosing the sort order. The command line for combining PDF files looks like this:
 pdftk file1.pdf file2.pdf file3.pdf cat output single_document.pdf 
 Starting from a dired-mode buffer, I can select various files and obtain a list with dired-get-marked-files. From there, is there a mechanism / library that can let me manually choose the order and return a new list sorted accordingly?

We are debating between Haskell and ZIO. Ideally, we'd use Scala 3 for the new type system and better implicits, and we also like ZIO 2 because the ZLayer semantics are clearer. I am concerned about being too far out on the bleeding edge. Has anyone used these two in combination in production?

I should note here that i haven't changed anything. But half of the times that it will compile it will not update the pdf when i add stuff to it. 
 On the other hand C-c C-c and typing LaTeX (which is what think C-c C-a does) works perfectly with no issues.
 Btw, i have checked the major mode and it is LaTeX/P and not Plain tex mode.
 I'm using fedora 36 with emacs 28.1
 Any suggestions of what could be wrong? I've also tried to reinstall the package and clear any cache but it behaves the same.

 Please test it and let us know at the Stack repository if you run into any trouble. If all goes well, we hope to release the final version in a couple of weeks.
 Changes since v2.7.5:
 Behavior changes:
  
stack build --coverage will generate a unified coverage report, even if there is only one *.tix file, in case a package has tested the library of another package that has not tested its own library. See #5713
 stack --verbose no longer includes the lengthy raw snapshot layer (rsl) in the debug output by default. The new stack --[no-]rsl-in-log flag enables or disables the inclusion of the rsl in the debug output.
  
Other enhancements:
  
Bump to Hpack 0.35.0.

 One annoyance I couldn't fix is the helm buffers not being colorized properly. I attached 2 images as example below, when running helm-buffers-list in the two machines. I checked some helm faces with describe-face and in the info buffer the (sample) text displays them correctly, but I never played with faces in emacs so I don't know what else I could check. 
 One important thing is that, IF I'm not crazy, sometimes this problem doesn't happen, like 1/10 times. It only started to bother me now that i'm using it constantly to navigate files in a project.
 Could someone give some tips on how can I debug this issue, what should I look for, where? 
 Windows 10 / Ubuntu 20.04 / emacs 28.1 with native comp.

I like helix but it lacks some features but the best part is that it is really well built and feels very robust unlike my current LunarVim setup.
 I've been seeing people moving from vim to emacs. Their talks and reviews sound very mature, yet I seem to ignore them by thinking why would one use emacs rather than modal editing? Modal editing is so much comfier and faster. Also, I have the advantage of editing my keyboard layout using kmonad so using symbols in vim is fast for me too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just starting my journey with Scala.
 I know a bit of Rust and there they have syntax sugar for unwrapping their equivalent of Try. It would look roughly this way:
 def foo(): Try[Int]; def bar(): Try[Unit] = val v: Int = foo()? ... def bar_unrolled(): Try[Unit] = val v: Int = foo() match case Failure(f) => return Failure(f) case Success(v) => v ... 
 I.e. question mark operator is equivalent to this `match` statement in `bar_unrolled()`.
 Does Scala has any sugar for working with `Try`-s? Right now a lot of my code is just these match statements. The two popular use cases for the Try are "propagate error or return value" as in the example and the second one that I have in a lot of cases is "wrap and propagate error or return value", i.e. the same but with a different `Throwable`

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dear all, using doomemacs on NixOS I have trouble getting tramp to work nicely through zsh with projectile/magit/etc. I have read this section of the emacs wiki about zsh but none of the options given there make zsh work with tramp. Currently I have:
  if [ $TERM = "tramp" ]; then unset RPROMPT unset RPS1 PS1="$ " unsetopt zle unsetopt rcs # Inhibit loading of further config files return fi 
 So I have to resort to sshx which works but then magit fails to find git, projectile can not initialize project caches and many other unpleasant things. I have tried the following settings in various combinations to no avail:
 (setq projectile-file-exists-remote-cache-expire nil) (setq projectile-enable-caching t) (add-to-list 'tramp-remote-path 'tramp-own-remote-path) (setq-default projectile-indexing-method 'alien) (setq tramp-connection-properties '(("/sshx:server:" "remote-shell" "/run/current-system/sw/bin/zsh") ("/sshx:host:" "remote-shell" "/run/current-system/sw/bin/zsh") ("/ssh:server:" "remote-shell" "/run/current-system/sw/bin/zsh") ("/ssh:host:" "remote-shell" "/run/current-system/sw/bin/zsh") ("/ssh:user@host:" "remote-shell" "/run/current-system/sw/bin/zsh") ("/sshfs:" "direct-async-process" t))) (customize-set-variable 'tramp-encoding-shell "/run/current-system/sw/bin/zsh") (setq tramp-terminal-type "tramp") 
 Any ideas what else I could try?

 I'm trying to do citations. I set bib file in the org document, and I do citations like [cite:@OrgCitations]. When I export, this doesn't get processed. I also included #+print_bibliography: but this doesn't get processed either.
 I guess the problem is probably my config file? I've been looking at the following resources, but didn't find what I guess I'm missing (maybe too obvious for most emacs users? or maybe I missed it?): how to tell my .emacs config file to load org-cite.
 https://orgmode.org/manual/Citations.html
 https://blog.tecosaur.com/tmio/2021-07-31-citations.html
 https://kristofferbalintona.me/posts/202206141852/#configuration
 Here's what I'm trying in my .emacs :
  
;;;;Org-cite config 
 ;; enable org-cite 
 (require 'oc) 
 ;; set bibliography file 
 (org-cite-global-bibliography 
 '(/home/steve/orgcite.bib))
  
When I try to load this (M-x load-file and hit enter twice) I get this error:
  
eval-buffer: Symbol’s function definition is void: org-cite-global-bibliography
  
What am I doing wrong here?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a trait Action[Result] that represents a serializable value that is used to decide which piece of code should be ran producing Result. Something of a marker for the event based runtime. I then extend it to describe all the action I have
 case object FetchData extends Action[Something]
 case object ProcessData extends Action[List[Int]] 
 case object PublishResults extends Action[Unit] 
 and do something along the lines of
 def runAction(action) =>
 case FetchData => FetchData.implementation(???) 
 case ProcessData => ... 
 Now I can describe sequence of action having all the information about the types
 val myAlgo: Sequence[Something, List[Int], Unit] = Sequence(FetchData, ProcessData, PublishResults)
 Simple enough
 I now want to describe the dependancy of an action on the results of a different action or some env
 trait Action[Input, Result]
 case object FetchData extends Action[Nothing, Something]
 case object ProcessData extends Action[Something, List[Int]] 
 case object PublishResults extends Action[List[Int], Unit]
 So now Sequence(FetchData, ProcessData, PublishResults) compiles and Sequence(FetchData, PublishResults) does not.
 I will not post code here but I achieve it by mimicking function composition.(since Action[Input, Result] is basically representation of a function)
 Now what I want is to able do describe the exact same thing but with the ability of an action to describe the dependancy on any number of previous action in a type-safe way ie
 Sequence(FetchData1, FetchData2, FetchData3, ProcessFetchedData, ConsumeTheDataOfFirstFetchAgain PublishResults) compiles because FetchData1 happens before ConsumeTheDataOfFirstFetchAgain
 I think this can be done via macros but I really dont want to write custom ones.
 I am not familiar with shapless so I dont know if something from there could help 
 So does anyone have an idea on how to do things like this? If they can be done even? Maybe some paper I could read?

 There's a cool package named hl-prog-extra which lets you write regexes for highlighting some things extra specially. In comments, I wanted words surrounded by backticks to be highlighted like GitHub or lsp-ui-mode do. My init.el contains:
 (setq hl-prog-extra-list (list ;; Match `symbol`. '("`[^`\n]+`" 0 comment lsp-face-semhl-namespace))) 
 Which gives me cool highlighting like:

 As you can see, everything within backticks is purple, but the words between them are still grayed out. Just thought I'd mention, in case anyone here wants this too.

I tried reading the documentation, but I'm still a little lost lol. All of this monad stuff is tripping me up lol. Thanks in advanced!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently my Emacs has been taking a very long time to start up — often around 8–10 s, and sometimes more. If I close Emacs and then start it up again, the startup time usually decreases to around 5 s, but then it increases back to 8–10 s after I put my computer to sleep. The really curious thing about this is that whenever I try to run esup or a similar profiler, the problem goes away entirely: Emacs starts near-instantly, and the profiler consistently reports around 3.5 s startup time (all of which is straightforwardly due to my init.el). I can find nothing else obvious which might be causing this delay — and, before you ask, I can’t quite remember when the problem started. Does anyone have any other ideas whatsoever as to what might be causing this or how I might be able to fix it?
 (For reference, my .emacs.d is at https://github.com/bradrn/.emacs.d/blob/bef9de6ad27e214fa5972ed220d839721d8febca/init.el; I am using Emacs 28.1 on Windows 10, without native compilation.)

 I did find https://wiki.haskell.org/99_questions/1_to_10 , but honestly, even the first exercise is beyond. It's quite the jump from TryHaskell.org!*
 I did see https://exercism.org/tracks/haskell , as well, but I'm not sure if that's what I'm looking for and I won't know until I make an account. I'd rather not make an account unless it actually provides what I'm looking for.
 * To be clear, what I'm refering to is the provided solution. Yes, I could define myLast to equal last but that seems counter to the exercise.

Yank to clipboard text without the org-emphasis markers used to stylize the text. org-copy-visible copies text to the kill-ring, but I want this behavior in evil-yank. 
 
A way to apply org-emphasis markers around active region (i.e. selected text). I came across this but it doesn't seem to work. I'm guessing it's because I'm using Evil and keys like ~ is bound to other functions in visual mode.
 
 Any help is much appreciated.

 I'm working with emacs for a few years now and I'm tired to run it in ssh inside the terminal, because in a GUI mode for my disability it is more nice and helpful.
 Now, I'm looking for a solution to use in my local machine the emacs daemon that is running in my remote machine.
 I tried to run the emacs --daemon on the remote machine with the following configuration
  (require 'server) (setq server-use-tcp t server-host "<IP>" server-socket-dir "~/.emacs.d/server") (unless (server-running-p) (server-start)) 
 and after I'm copy the .emacs.d/server/server in my local machine and run emacsclient -c but I have the following result
  ➜ ~ emacsclient -c emacsclient: can't find socket; have you started the server? emacsclient: To start the server in Emacs, type "M-x server-start". emacsclient: connected to remote socket at <IP> Waiting for Emacs... *ERROR*: Could not open file: /dev/ttys000 
 There are any suggestion and update guide on how to make this configuration working?

 Last I've announced a preview of PET. I've received some very valuable feedback over the past month so thank you for giving it a try. I've fixed all the issues reported and the package is now available on Melpa.
 To recap, PET is a new package that aims to take all of your troubles configuring Emacs to find the correct Python executables from virtualenvs away. It supports poetry, pre-commit, pipenv, pipx, pyenv, direnv, plain old virtualenv and pdm, and assigns the correct executable paths to buffer local variables of your favorite emacs packages. It also works for repos that use one or combinations of these tools.
 I hope I can help you delete a bunch of code and dotfiles from your init.el and projects!

 I'm having a bit of tough time in Emacs Lisp, in that I don't see the errors in my code until I run it, ie the lack of compile time checks.
 I just realized that some function calls in some of my code are totally wrong and only failed to notice them because they are lightly used and the code paths were never exercised.
 Are there some techniques to get better compile time checking in Emacs Lisp? I know Common Lisp has some superior tools or techniques for that, but I need Emacs's best.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello Scala friends, I can't realize how to solve this.
 I got the following function: ``` // I kept only with date part on "localDateOfEpoch" since the time part, comes from times. It is a shortcut method to get a LocalDate from a epoch.
 def calculateUpcomingOfDaily( from: Long, every: Int, times: Seq[java.time.LocalTime] ): Iterator[java.time.LocalDateTime] = Iterator .iterate( localDateOfEpoch(from).plusDays(every) )(_.plusDays(every)) .zip(Iterator.continually(times).flatten) .map { case (localDate, localTime) => java.time.LocalDateTime.of(localDate, localTime) } ```
 Calling it gives me: ``` // Parse times is a shortcut method, to parse strings using a dateformatter into LocalTime.
 calculateUpcomingOfDaily( 1656676800000L, // 2022-07-01 12:00:00 1, parseTimes(Seq("01:00:00","01:10:00")) ) .take(5) .toList
 res1: List[java.time.LocalDateTime] = List( 2022-07-02T01:00, 2022-07-03T01:10, 2022-07-04T01:00, 2022-07-05T01:10, 2022-07-06T01:00 ) ```
 But my desired result must be:  res1: List[java.time.LocalDateTime] = List( 2022-07-02T01:00, 2022-07-02T01:10, 2022-07-03T01:00, 2022-07-03T01:10, 2022-07-04T01:00 ) 
 This is a great exercise to learn about iterable operations but, I don't know how to generate those kind of combinations.

When I start writing code: c ... int main() { if (a == b) ... }  instead of: c ... int main() { if (a == b) } ...  I get this: c int main() { if (a == b) ... }  Even after inserting a literal TAB character it just goes back to 2. Is there a way to change this behavior so that its auto indenting is 4, possibly globally?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, folks. I started learning Emacs and Elisp about a week ago and it's been a blast.
 I just started adding a handful of simple functions and key bindings to open MPlayer in "slave" mode and control it by piping commands through a named pipe (FIFO). On opening, all of MPlayer's output is sent to the *Async Shell Command* buffer.
 The key-bound functions simply use the builtin "shell-command" to echo MPlayer commands to /tmp/mplayerfifo just as you would from Bash:
 echo "pause" > /tmp/mplayerfifo echo "get_time_pos > /tmp/mplayerfifo 
 I have no use for the output when I'm simply controlling the video, but the output of commands like "get_time_pos" are printed out at the bottom of *Async Shell Command* and I would really like to stuff them in a variable. In short, how might I grab the content of *Async Shell Command* while working in a different buffer? I can work out transforming the text, I just need to get my hands on it. Also, could I clear that buffer after each command?

 val task = Future{ getUserList() } for{ userList <- task user <- userList } println("Result: " + user) 
 However, if an exception is thrown during the getUserList() method, the code will not break but will simply hide it, and the for-comp will not run. I know there are other (and in my view better) ways to handle the results of Futures (like using callbacks that allow checking for Failure), but I'm just wondering about the theory or use case that makes this a best practice or a right choice

 What would it look like to do it the other way around? How would you write Java such that it looks like Scala with worse syntax and ergonomics? Libraries or frameworks you would use for a typical backend stack or general coding (vavr is the one that comes to my mind)? Would you find type classes worth using without implicits?

 I have an odd behavior thing that I can't understand and i have no idea how to debug.
 When I call the function projectile-find-files, it asks me to select a project, I do that and as soon as It opens the buffer for finding the file, in a new buffers open the projectile-file-errors, there are no errors, the output shows that it is running a new shell, the message is repeated twice, it is like it run the shell command twice.
 Is that related to linux command that find-files uses in emacs?
 I attach a picture of the error buffers.

 That is very annoying I want to get rid of it and understand what causes it. I enable the Show log for key presses and commands but I can't see anything wrong and my debug skills are too weak to go further.

 About SimpleX Chat
 SimpleX Chat is implemented in Haskell - we have lots of support from Haskell community - thank you all!
 SimpleX Chat is an open-source multi-provider messaging platform that minimizes meta-data in the communication - it is the only platform we know of that has no user identifiers of any kind (not even random numbers), instead using pairwise connection identifiers (4 per each contact you have, on 2 different servers), making it more difficult to correlate traffic and determine who is communicating with whom.
 This video by The Digital Prepper channel explains how SimpleX Chat is different from all other messaging platforms: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKRfDch_WBQ
 Anybody can host the servers participating in SimpleX network, and it is NOT related to or dependent on any crypto-currency.
 See technical details & limitations and FAQ.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is a rant and a maybe cry for help, I hope you don't take it the wrong way. Basically: I've been using emacs for 10 years, and still can't find my way around it. I've read "Mastering emacs" a couple of times plus a bunch of tutorials, but everything I learn I end up forgetting because there is so much and it is so complex.
 The usual advice, in this case, is: just learn what you need and use. That works elsewhere, but not with emacs. You see, the whole system is so complex, and everything so interrelated, that I feel that if I don't know everything about it, the things I do use will alway act differently from what I expect. To understand why I would have to know how plugins are loaded, how text is processed, all the subtleties of the undo ring and so on.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 There is some strange rendering behavior around shr. When I start reading one of the newer epub ebooks from oreilly using nov.el, in some sentences the whitespace between two words is missing.
 For instance:
 #+begin_example
 Wecan’t stress enough the importance of experimentation as you learn new concepts here and throughout the book.
 #+end_example
 Here, the whitespace is missing between `We` and `can't`.
 So I did checked the xhtml source of the epub:
 #+begin_src html
 <p>We<a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="code examples" data-secondary="downloading" id="idm45654236145288"/><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="online resources" data-secondary="code examples" id="idm45654236144280"/><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="GitHub, code examples from" id="idm45654236143336"…]]></summary>

I've only been doing react js development lately so that's all I could test. 
  
Code completion and stuff like that are just as good with Emacs + language server as it is with VSCode. Of course, because VSCode developed LSP. But, hear me out here, you might think that Emacs is just the worse choice because I had to seek help from someone when VSCode works right out of the box. For most people, yeah, for me, no.

 Do you use OverloadedRecordDot? NoFieldSelectors? DuplicateRecordFields? OverloadedRecordUpdate?

 Could you give examples or link to tutorials?

 My terminology may be off, which might explain why I can't find my own solution.

 imenu that takes into account nested items
 jumping to prev/next item at the same level of nesting
 changing the level of nesting (similar to org-metaleft/right)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Some weeks ago, I asked here, if there is a way to let GHC infer backwards constraints from instance declaration, i. e. for instance  instance (A a) => B a where  have not only forall a. A a => B a, but also forall a. B a => A a. It's correct, provided that we have no overlapping instance for B. In answers there were a link to an article on this topic. However, implementation from the article requires essential changes in GHC. I found some way to make this with currently available extensions (mostly type families) with not so much boilerplate and now uploaded it on github with my solution for the first problem from the "Motivation" section of the paper.
 However, I think, it's not quite natural. If this method is general enough and can be automated, it seems me very nice to have an GHC plugin or even GHC extension to make this without any hacks in code. For example, such syntax of class declaration:  class {-# BIDIRECTIONAL #-} A a where  will make all instance of this class bidirectional (and forbids overlaps).
 What do you think about it? More concrete questions: - are there any other (beside this article) conversations about this feature? - does this feature sound reasonable enough to implement it? - what are disadvantages of using bidirectional instances, besides it conflicts with overlappable instances? are the overlappable instances for most of classes (for example common classes from base) really used in haskell?
 I ask this to gather more pros&cons for this feature. If it will considered to be useful enough, maybe I'll try to implement it. Anyway, it's nice for me to learn more opinions about this.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi there,
 I write my notes in org (org-roam style) and have both equations and TikZ diagrams rendered nicely in the buffer using orgs latex preview function. It looks great! 
 However, I wish to export my org-roam web to HTML, and publish this using some kind of SSG such that anyone can look at them without needing a configured emacs. Ox-hugo works great for this except for TikZ diagrams. Regular latex is rendered fine using mathjax, but mathjax cannot handle TikZ, and probably never will be able to handle TikZ. 
 Ox-hugo and ox-html allows one to render latex using something like dvisvgm, however I don't want to use this for general latex equations that can be rendered using mathjax as it generally looks way worse than mathjax, particularly for inline maths. 
 Is there anyway to change the latex ox-html/ox-hugo behaviour for a select number of latex fragments, while keeping mathjax for the rest? 
 Alternatively, is there anyway I can preview the contents of a #+begin_src latex block? If so, I can stick my complex latex math in the src block and have it exported to svg, but still have my beautiful buffer previews. 
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, I cannot afford to switch to emacs for my day job (full-stack dev) and take the productivity hit, but I would like to give this emacs thingy a try for fun and start learning. Eventually I want to try to use it for coding (with new for me stuff like lisp and clojure or even with my current stack).
 So is there some resource online where I can explore 'cool' things to try in emacs?
 Specifically:
  
are there any 'packages' that I must have, that promote learning the commands and key bindings and exploring? e.g. autocomplete, suggestions, recovering from errors, docs etc.
 any pointers on how to do FS navigation in emacs? any must-have packages to help with that
 any pointers on how to do theming? Ideally, to just use some nice theme, with good defaults, not looking for customization at this point. (watched some youtube videos where orgmode looked so much better than mine)
 is theming done per major/minor mode or based on packages or something else?
 any pointers on getting started with org-mode? I am going through orgmode.org rn and got somewhat familiar with the syntax. I am trying to evaluate it and I don't see the value yet. do i need any plugins for it?
 I am confused with the package managers and the options you have and how to import. Is there some rule of thumb I can follow that can help me simplify adding packages? I don't need 'options' right now, I need a 'do it this way, it gets you to 90%'
 I was watching some videos and saw this https://github.com/daviwil/dotfiles/blob/master/Emacs.org, which is HUUUGE. Is there some other resource that I can just start with one piece/package at a time and keep adding more slowly?
  
Sorry if this was posted before (it must have, I guess, but not recently), but I am after some specific things. I need someone to take me by the hand cause this thing is deep and wide and I feel lost.
 Also apologies for the long post. ANY feedback is much appreciated!

 then for some reason (maybe at the time I complete the task I cannot use emacs), so I have to mark the task as DONE later, then I want to directly change the plaintext of the time I complete the task, for example, I want to change the time the latest completion to be 21:20, then the org file will becomes this:

 For other operations org offers, like breaking down task, if you manually edit the text of checkboxes, you can use #'org-update-check-box-count to make the task progress to be correct. For calculating time interval for a timer, you can have #'org-evaluate-time-range if you directly change the plaintext of the time you start and end a task.
 Is there any similar command for changing the next SCHEDULED time and LAST_REPEAT property?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The recent anniversary of Lucid Emacs reminded me of a few people I know (on- and offline) who really stuck with XEmacs for a long time. And if I remember correctly, I myself used 19.34 for a long time despite 20.x being out.
 So, anyone in here not feeling the need to pick one of the latest releases? Or just happy with the version that comes with your OS, despite it not being 27/28?
 With more prevalent package usage, that might get more problematic earlier than before, where you just missed some new core feature. But I would assume that people doing this are happy with their general config anyway.

 Don't really know is this is the correct place to ask this but here it goes.
 I'm using Doom Emacs and I'm trying to debug some PHP Laravel code using LSP+debug. Remote debugging seems to be working fine but, in Emacs, when I inspect variables there is less information than in VS Code. Noticed this especially in Model instances.
 Below is a screenshot comparison of the same inspection in both Emacs and VS Code.
 As you can see, in Emacs the last entry is escapeWhenCastingToString and in VS Code there are entries for attributes, original, changes, ...
 Have no clue where to begin to fix this... Any help is appreciated.
 Thanks in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I need to add a UUID to each row in a table, but I also need to keep any existing IDs without changing them.
 It's simple enough to add a UUID with '(org-id-new):
 | Col1 | UUID | |-------+--------------------------------------| | test1 | 1BFBFCAA-CD59-4D4E-9956-CA27B3DCED1E | | test2 | 18209466-723B-4820-A175-0237769548FD | #+TBLFM: $2='(org-id-new) 
 Going forward I want to keep those UUIDs and only generate new ones for new rows.
 I thought I could try '(unless $2 (org-id-new)), but I get nils.
 Is there a reference for the current cell, or a way to only apply a calculation to an empty cell?

 I am trying to figure out which is better. I used to do evil with Doom, but I decided to try out generic emacs bindings and I enjoyed them . Then I found meow and I like the inbetween'ness of Meow. Which is better for someone who doesnt want to customize all day? For example I probably will be using framework for the rest of my life and dont particularly care to over customize. Should I just keep with the "emacs bindings" or should I keep up with modal editing. OR just decide on the more popular framework because im lazy. 
 Excuse the Ravings Posted this before bed.
 ​
 TL:DR: Should i stick with Emacs bindings or modal. (i used evil/doom) for someone who would rather let someone take the reigns.

 i feel like my knowledge can be improved in getting good performance in haskell. my usual approach to improving performance is using profiteur and optimising the big blocks there. but i don't know very much about when to use strictness annotations or other stuff to squeeze out better performance. 
 also not sure if my haskell is very idomatic since i'm fully self taught. Any books or resources i should look at? thanks

Most of that code produces derivations or packages but occasionally we write small helper functions that are algorithmic in nature. As diligent developers and when appropriate, we should write unit tests to ensure the correctness and maintainability of our code. This post will demonstrate and compare various ways available in the Nix ecosystem to add unit testing to your Nix code — specifically Nix functions.

Minimal Examples
We will start with minimal working examples from 3 different frameworks and then show off some extra features and capabilities. If you would like to test out these examples yourself, you can find them all here.

 Have I passed the point of no return? Am I lost here forever? Is there something like alcoholics anonymous for like fated people?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just released Org2Blog v1.1.13 with almost no user-facing changes but primarily maintenance and cleanup.
 That said you might care about:
  
 Create Entries without requiring an Internet connection to load Categories, Tags, and Pages. Previously it would error out preventing you from creating the Entry on your computer.
  WordPress 6 broke View Entry. Fixed.
  Although you were unlikely to have used org2blog-buffer-post-or-page-view or org2blog-subtree-post-or-page-view, you can't anymore. See their function for details. Guessing you were unlikely since the break was never reported.
  Easier to check for compilation errors since long docstrings now get ignored.
  
This is cross-posted: emacs ⇔ orgmode.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A few of my students have encountered a problem running HLS 1.7 on Windows 10/11. Their Haskell installations mostly seem okay---everything installed by ghcup (1.8) , and cabal (3.6.2) and ghc (9.2.2) work as expected. However, when VS Code (via the Haskell plugin) attempts to start the language server, it exits repeatedly with error STATUS_DLL_NOT_FOUND (or its signed integer equivalent).
 Has anyone encountered a configuration that leads to this problem before? Most of the students are not having this problem (nor am I, on similar software configurations), so I suspect it's a consequence of something else they have installed.

 Issue:
  
I'm getting this message appear in my '*Messages*' buffer when I visit a Ruby based file with the '.rb' file extension on MacOS:
  
​
 LSP :: The following servers support current file but do not have automatic installation: ruby-ls sorbet-ls typeprof-ls ruby-syntax-tree-ls steep-ls You may find the installation instructions at https://emacs-lsp.github.io/lsp-mode/page/languages. (If you have already installed the server check *lsp-log*). 
 What I Have Done:
  
I installed 'Solargraph' via the 'gem install solargraph' command on both my Linux machine (Manjaro Linux) and MacOS machine.
 I made sure to include a change to my '~/.bashrc' config to include the following section on both my Linux machine (Manjaro Linux) and MacOS machine (Macbook Pro):
  
​
 # Ruby specific variables: export GEM_HOME="$HOME/.gem" 
 Current Emacs Config Snippet Containing My LSP Based Config Section:
  
Here's a link to a snippet of my Emacs config that I have using a literate Emacs config in a '~/.emacs.d/configuration.org' file: 
 https://bpa.st/3PQA

 Question:
  
What can I do in this scenario?

 I was thinking to deal with them in the following way:
  
divide them in groups,
 manually sort priority for every group,
 mergesort groups, that is, start merging groups in pairs, and manually sort for every step the union group until I have a large sorted backlog.
  
For this to be practical, I would need an easy way to sort manually a group of tasks and get them assigned automatically a priority (or any other hack) so that priority ordering matchs manual ordering.
 Any idea about how to get this done?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I gave Orgzly a chance, but it doesn't do what I need it to do. I use org-roam to link my notes together, and it would be great if an app recognized org-roam formatting such as backlinks, metadata, ids, and aliases. Also, I'm not a huge fan of how writing to org files requires you to basically fill out a form, I'd much rather edit it right in the editor, in a WYSIWYG fashion. 
 Basically, I want an app like Obsidian but for org files instead of markdown. I know there is also Logseq, but Logseq uses wikilinks instead of org-roam's id-based linking format. 
 Coincidentally, I'm just starting school for Mobile App Development in September. I don't have the skills to make this yet, but if nobody else does, I will for sure once I'm able to.

 But I see exactly the same content in both windows, whatever action I take in one of them. I have verified that follow-mode is disabled. So I am forced to switch back and forth between two running Emacs instances and view one manual page at a time.
 Is this a quirk of Info-mode, or am I missing something?
 I use Emacs 28.1

 I was thinking about this topic for a long time.
 This post has high level technical discussion and some notes about psychology, but it mostly came from thinking about code as something that comes with cognitive effort and that this effort should be kept under control.
 I would like to solicit feedback from Haskell and FP programmers first before I start showing it to a wider audience.
 It is a high level rant that includes quite a bit of FP and Haskell.
 Thank you for taking a look.

Is it somehow possible mixing ordered and unordered list, for different levels, in the same list?
 Use case: Quite often I make lists where the top level is ordered (do these items in this order), but the next level(s) should rather be unordered, as they are more "comments" or thoughts, but having them ordered looks a bit silly, as if "you must do it in this order". Especially when sharing notes with others.
 Desired way of using it, something like:
 1. Item 1 - Sub item 1 - Sub item 2 2. Item 2 - Sub item 1

 We're looking for a Haskell developer who can balance shipping features with improving this codebase every time they change it. While we're not afraid of the occasional inelegant hack, we'd much prefer to look back and see that we used the right tools and abstractions, instead of brute force.

 I had been using Akka and Quill before, but it looks like ProtoQuill uses ZIO 2. Okay, so there's ZIO-HTTP for ZIO 2, which covers my HTTP requirements, but the zio-pulsar library doesn't support ZIO 2 yet.
 So I'm not sure which direction to go. I could stick with Akka, but then which Scala 3 database library would I use? I don't think Slick supports Scala 3 yet. Doobie uses Cats.
 This is all quite confusing. Is it just too early to start using Scala 3?

 In my time with doobie, my case classes were simpler, so zero complications, until now. Within my table there's a column "dates", which is a date array. On the Scala side my case class has a field dates: Seq[String]. This is because, the field is read only so the string representation is great. But I cannot figure how to declare the desired Metaor at least Get mapping.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Currently, i am learning how to build applications with tagless final pattern. However, I am a bit confused at the moment, that which tagless final approach is the right one. I know there are tons of resources out there which states that in tagless final pattern, we use trait as the algebra with a companion object. Most of the times, developers tend to do the implementations in the companion object as well, or create another class (interpreter) where they implement the algebra's functions. However, I have seen many solutions where the devs replace the trait + companion object combo with class + companion object one. 
 Honestly, I am pretty confused which approach is the right one: 
 // 1. trait + companion object approach trait Repository[F[_]] { def findAll[A](): F[List[A]] } object Repository { def apply[F[_]]()(implicit ev: Repository[F]): Repository[F] = ev def make[F[_]](): Repository[F] = new Repository[F] { def findAll[A](): F[List[A]] = ... } } // 2. class + companion object approach class Repository[F[_]]() { def findAll[A](): F[List[A]] = ... } object Repository { def apply[F[_]](): Repository[F] = new Repository[F]() }

 That's why I created a new library, hero, which uses sparse sets for storing component data. Basic benchmarks seem to suggest that hero is roughly 40 times faster than apecs at iterating over components.
 The interface for hero is inspired by apecs, but there are some significant differences.
 The library is still rough around the edges, but you can already find it on https://github.com/Simre1/hero. I have also started work on an sdl2 binding which is in the same repository.
 The end goal for hero is to empower people to make simple games in Haskell, but there is still a long way to go.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi All,
My professor has shared many cool worksheets and spreadsheets for organizing literature notes for use in my lit reviews. (Thank you, amazing professor!!) However, as I was going through the examples, I found myself thinking, "hey, couldn't I just do this via zettels?"
Here's my thinking: Each worksheet or spreadsheet uses a one-line per article approach. For each article, the worksheet provides space to capture the following:
Authors (year)
Relevant Literature & Theory (Major Points, Topics, Ideas, and Who was referenced?)
Purpose of the study
Overview of Study Design (Method, Variables/Key Concepts, Sample - who was studied and how were they selected, Means of Data Collection?)
Major Finding(s)
Conclusions, Implications, & Limitations
Now, here's how I currently structure my zettels:

I include the citation in the title
I include a "too long, don't read" summary at the top
I write a more expansive entry
I include my own tags for cross-referencing
I include related card links
I include the actual reference
In theory, it should be pretty easy to establish a new template where the top part becomes spots for those worksheet areas. The bottom part would largely remain the same, only the tags would allow me to include things like
Which lit review this is for (creativity & spirituality, agency & organizational transformation, or if it speaks to both)
Findings tags and research method tags (e.g., #creativity-spirituality; #quantitative #survey)
My own brilliant insights and connections
Et cetera.
My questions for this community are:
Thanks in advance for your help with this one!

 How can I customize it so that the error message doesn't break like so?
 Sorry for the noob question, I tried to figure it out and read the documentation provided, but could not do it.
 SOLUTION:
 The issue with wrapping lines is caused when using a fixed font, so removing the value set to font face height solved the issue for me.
 Another thing I tried was changing the font to a non-mono-spaced one, but I decided to stick with the first one.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi there,
 I'm converting my bash and zsh configs to a literate org file and finding noweb quite confusing. I think I understand everything in the manual, but my changes keep breaking it.
 In this commit, all I've done is move two blocks from one noweb-ref to another (previously they inherited their noweb-refs from the subtree properties). This was intended just to clean up the org file without changing the output.
 The tangled shell scripts and zsh.toml haven't changed. But bash.toml (which I didn't touch at all!) now includes the #+begin_src and #+end lines of the :noweb-ref prompt-format block.
 I'd be really grateful if anyone could have a look at the diff and let me know where I've gone wrong:
 https://github.com/quarkQuark/dotfiles/commit/82551520806ad2e9c2b22e3bc4446c5352ce14c2
 I've also noticed that sometimes replacing a :noweb-ref header argument with an equivalent #+name makes every noweb reference in the org file expand to the empty string. There seems to be no rhyme or reason for when this happens, but going back to :noweb-ref always fixes it.
 Thanks in advance for any replies.

 For some time now I had a project in mind - website that would teach physics. The issue was that I didn't know anything about web development. So I started reading about html, css and javascript, and I tinkered a little with Phaser.js and created very very simple game with it. I also tried wordpress, ihp and django. I also looked at purescript and halogen as was suggested to me on r/haskell three weeks ago. With none of those I spent more than 2 or 3 days though, so I do not really know much about any of these technologies. I just got my pinky a little wet.
 Anyway, thanks to reading discussions on this subreddit, I decided to settle on …]]></summary>

Dan Allosso has finished a major rewrite on his and S.F. Allosso’s earlier edition of A Short Handbook for writing essays in the Humanities and Social Sciences. This expanded edition has several new chapters on note making (notice that this is dramatically different than note taking) using a zettelkasten-based (or card index or fichier boîte if you prefer) approach similar to that practiced by Beatrice Webb, Marcel Mauss, Claude Lévi-Strauss, Roland Barthes, Hans Blumenberg, Mortimer J. Adler, and Walter Benjamin among many others.
The focus of the book is on note making for actively producing tangible outputs (essays, papers, theses, monographs, books, etc.). …]]></summary>

 Checking `sbt` version shows "1.7.1" and `scala` version is "3.1.3".
 I tried to test it with basic project but sbt new scala/scala3.g8 (in empty folder) starts from fetching "getting org.scala-sbt sbt 1.3.4" - why? I already have "1.7.1".
 Then it fails due to access denial:

 [error] [launcher] could not retrieve sbt 1.3.4
 PS. I had older version of `scala` and `sbt` installed before but I uninstalled them - could it be that there are some artifacts left?

 hs {-# INLINE vecNLE #-} vecNLE :: DoubleX24# -> Double# -> Int# vecNLE (# v0, v1, v2, v3 #) f = ((v00 >## f) `andI#` (v01 >## f) `andI#` (v10 >## f) `andI#` (v11 >## f) `andI#` (v20 >## f) `andI#` (v21 >## f) `andI#` (v30 >## f) `andI#` (v31 >## f)) where !(# v00, v01 #) = unpackDoubleX2# v0 !(# v10, v11 #) = unpackDoubleX2# v1 !(# v20, v21 #) = unpackDoubleX2# v2 !(# v30, v31 #) = unpackDoubleX2# v3 
 which, in my eye, is quite ridiculous. Why are the code made like this? Is this obfuscation required to make haskell as performant? Or is the entire benchmarkgame itself full of these kind of code? If the latter is true, I wonder whether benchmarkgame is credible for anything.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone, I write Haskell as a hobby. I am still learning and some concepts are still very hard to understand for me. Since I mostly write Javascript for my day job, I recently got into a very interesting problem. I had to write some logic in where as set of data has to be checked through multiple other datasets and return a value or null at the end.
 When I thought this through in imperative way, I found that I have to write a massive set of if-else logic which might end-up being an "if-else hell" and quite unmanageable to in future. Since I knew I can chain a Maybe monad through multiple function using bind operator in Haskell. I ended up implementing something like this in JS. Here is the Maybe monad implementation 
 class Maybe { __value; constructor(value) { this.__value = value; } static from(value) { return new Maybe(value); } isNothing() { return ( this.__value === null || this.__value === undefined || this.__value === false ); } just() { return this.__value; } do(f) { if (this.isNothing()) { return Maybe.from(null); } return Maybe.from(f(this.__value)); } 
 }
 With the help of this I can do something like this --
 Maybe.from(1) .do(prevValue => prevValue === 1 ? prevValue + 5 : null) //return Maybe 6 .do(prevValue => prevValue > 5 ? prevValue * 2 : null) //return Maybe 12 .do(prevValue => prevValue > 10 ? prevValue + 30 : null) // return Maybe 42 .do(prevValue => prevValue > 100 ? prevValue + 5 : null) // return Maybe null .do(prevValue => prevValue < 100 ? prevValue + 50 : prevValue * prevValue) // will do nothing here .just() // return null since failed on 4th step 
 Is my understanding of Maybe monad implementation correct? How similar it is considered to Haskell's implementation of Maybe monad?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am struggling to specify org-capture-template to insert a template at a current location in the current buffer. This template will be inserted in multiple files, so I cannot specify the file name explicitly.
 This is a plain text template, there is no substitution, or anything else. I just want to insert a heading with a checklist.
 My current definition is (after some Googling)
 ("m" "Miller Heimann checklist" entry (file+function buffer-name (lambda () (goto-char (point)))) (file "~/org/miller-heimann-checklist-template.txt") :immediate-finish t :prepend t :empty-lines 1) 
 This works, sort-off:
  
If point is in the middle of a headline line, a new child node is inserted as expected.
 If the point is on a blank line or on a text line anywhere in the file, a child node is inserted as the first node in the file
  
Before I go off to single-step through the code, has anyone here faced a similar problem?
 I found one post with examples of org-capture tempaltes, but none of them matched what I am looking for. They all had specific file names as targets. 
 It makes me wonder whether I am misusing org-capture-templates. My other option is to create a plain elisp file that will insert text.
 Thanks,

 Is this possible in https://jblevins.org/projects/markdown-mode/?
 Thanks.

I often type in the left pane which is in the middle of the screen, and use the right pane for docs, messages, help etc. At least I try to. Often I will have Dired in the right pane too.
 With this setup, I often find myself endlessly switching back and forth between those two windows, which I find a bit unnecessary and would like to avoid.
 Emacs has some commands useful for work in other window, like scroll-next-window or open file in other window, but I do miss some. The way I use Emacs, I want to be able to switch buffers back and forth when reading docs and references in other window, as well as kill buffer in other window.

 Did a tech assignment, which I think I did well, but had a tech interview and afterwards they decided they didn't want to continue with me.
 It feels that they were looking for someone with a lot of FP knowledge (which I don't have that much, I understand the concepts, but where I work in currently it's not that much FP), even though that didn't really reflect from the job posting.
 I feel sad, I thought it was a pretty good fit and I put quite some time in the assignment. I prefer to learn on the job as well, that works the best for me
 Do you get rejected too for scala jobs? Any tips on how to move on from this?

I tried tutorial at: tutorial it suggests installing via `cabal install criterion` - that worked fine but I could not run the Fibonacci example (saved as Fibber.hs) via `ghc -O --make Fibber`. The complaint was about non-existent module `Criterion.Main`. I ended up copying `.cabal` file from GitHub and running `cabal build fibber` (which basically build and installe `criterion` once again) and then `cabal run Fibber -- --output fibber.html`.
 So it worked with `cabal` but why did `ghc` fail. What am doing wrong?

 As per the title, whop would like me to start making a weekly group study session and post on here for the purpose of learning Haskell. I am studying this wonderful language at Uni (Australian National University) and am really enjoying the content so far.
 I think a resource like this will be really good for the Haskell community.
 The book is made up of 21 Chapters and has many exercises and practice problems for each of them. Each chapter will cover off on a Haskell concept and then build upon that knowledge.
 I have made a Discord for this and this invite link is: https://discord.gg/2u7GBeZe
 There is a poll for those of you who are interested in this.
 The group posts and "classes will start next week". As I am also a "beginner" in the world of Haskell it will be a learning experience for all of us but I am sure that we will have fun. As the book is 21 chapters long, I suspect that this group learning activity will take 21 weeks!
 For those of you who cannot find a copy of this book, the third edition can be easily found on Libgen. Feel free to PM me for a download link to it :)
 ​
 The .hs files for each chapter can be found here: https://www.haskellcraft.com/craft3e/Home.html

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Basically, the topic.
 I have a file with a scala 3 macro that runs through a package object somewhere and outputs a list of all the objects of a certain type. If this file isn't recompiled any time the program changes, this list becomes stale, and that causes problems. I can't figure out how to do this besides literally writing a timestamp to the file in a pre-build task every time so that the file has a modification to it, but there has to be a better way than this, right?

 Any help would be appreciated. Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am learning Scala after C++ and Rust.
 I was writing a module to parse some made-up binary opcodes into appropriate case classes implementing some common ancestor class: 
 sealed abstract class Instruction object Instruction { case class Add(t: Type, source: Register, destination: Register) extends Instruction ... } 
 I came up with a solution including a list of Int => Function tuples: (2)
 val handlers = List( (OPCODE_NOP, (_,_,_) => Instruction = Instruction.Nop(_, _, _), .. ) 
 The above code is approximate. The original solution was: (3)
  (OPCODE_NOP, Instruction.Nop) 
 But it turns out the second element of the tuple becomes Instruction.Nop.type, instead of a function as I would expect. My question is why is it so and is there a way to shorten the function (2) with placeholders to something similar to the last code block (3) ?
 -----
 Side note: implementors of Instruction have different argument sets, so currently I split them into multiple groups based on argument sets and handle them using LUTs:
 val handlers_type_reg_reg = List( (OP1, OP1_constructor), .. ) val handlers_type_reg = List( (OP2, OP2_constructor), .. ) val handler_types = List( (OP1, handler_type_reg_reg), (OP2, handler_type_reg), ..) 
 So the top-level function would choose a specific function for a group of instructions based on an argument set and call it, the specific function would look up the constructor for the specific instruction and call it.
 Does it look sane or am I missing some beautiful FP / Scala expressiveness?:)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Core Strats at Standard Chartered Bank are hiring Haskell developers again. We're currently looking for three developers, and we're flexible with regards to seniority / experience.
 The head of our group has given a talk at the Haskell Implementer’s Workshop last year where he described the team and what we do: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A70SN7vFsKU
 These roles are specifically for Applications & Services development, so expect some GUI work and plenty of stakeholder interaction.
 Applications should go via these links:
 Warsaw: https://scb.taleo.net/careersection/ex/jobdetail.ftl?job=2200023433 for direct employment, or [CoreStratsRoles@sc.com](mailto:CoreStratsRoles@sc.com) for contracting
 London: https://scb.taleo.net/careersection/ex/jobdetail.ftl?job=2200023448
 Singapore: https://scb.taleo.net/careersection/ex/jobdetail.ftl?job=2200017272
 Shanghai: reach out to [CoreStratsRoles@sc.com](mailto:CoreStratsRoles@sc.com)
 The Warsaw position is open to both contractors and direct employment, whereas the others are only open for direct employment. Standard Chartered supports (practically fully) remote working, but only from the country of payroll, and after an initial 3-month in-office period. We cover visa and relocation costs for successful employment applicants.
 Note that the first step of the application is a Valued Behaviours Assessment and it is quite important: our team won’t be able to see your application until you pass this assessment. Feel free to contact us at [CoreStratsRoles@sc.com](mailto:CoreStratsRoles@sc.com) if you have any questions about these positions.

I am Carlos and I live in Spain. I discovered this website recently and it immediately caught my attention, so I decided to join, because I've been thinking about creating a Zettelkasten system for some time and I found it one of the best sites I've seen to learn, with quite deep knowledge about the system from both Luhmann's and Ahrens' interpretations.
So that's it. I hope to learn a lot and actually starting to build my Zettelkasten.

 So here it comes:
 Whenever I invoke elfeed (M-x elfeed) it opens both a search buffer (*elfeed-search*) and the elfeed.org file I'm using to list my feeds. This means that, once I've exited the elfeed-search buffer, I see the elfeed.org file there. Is there a way to prevent this file from opening in a buffer (preferably) or to close it automagically when the *elfeed-search* buffer is closed?

 I initialized a project nodew/haskell-dapr (github.com) to bring dapr to Haskell world. And I believe it will make Haskell more productive on web development.
 Since Haskell doesn't have good GRPC support today, so currently, I just implemented the HTTP client APIs. 
 You can contribute the project by:
  
Add more tests
 Add Server module
 Create a sample app
 GRPC integration
 Simplify the APIs
  
I'm not good at writing tests in Haskell, especially testing against such a complex system. Your suggestion will be a great help to me and this project, of course, PRs would be much better!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been happily using org-journal, using weekly file option. Each entry for a day has a timestamp. It is very cumbersome to browse headlines because I have to keep opening file after file for each week of journal entries.
 I had the idea that yearly would be a better option, letting me see all of the headlines for a given year. But there isn't a timestamp for the entries. Each new date gets an entry but no timestamp within the day. Is this by design?
 Okay, so I can just hit a key combo and let emacs put in a timestamp for me. It doesn't work. C-c . just inserts the date, no time. C-u C-c . also just inserts the date, no time.
 Anyone with ideas on how I can have my journal entries timestamped, short of me looking at a clock and entering it by hand?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A struggle that I often have writing prose in Org-mode (or in any text editor with a markup language) is when I need to review things.
 I like to review from a printed copy, I'm better at catching errors that way. I also enjoy the ritual of getting off of my computer, sitting on a desk with printed pages, a red pen, and a cup of coffee.
 For that, I'll export as latex-pdf or odt and print---no big deal. The problem is that when I go back to the computer to make the changes in the file, the positions of the words and sentences are naturally very different from the ones in the printed page. So I have to be constantly switching my view from two texts that are very differently formatted, and that is tiresome. So much so, that I will often make the changes in the odt file on Libreoffice Writer, losing my god-given editing shortcuts, and once they are all done, I'll copy the text and paste it back on my org file. But then I have to be careful with italics and other stuff that will change once I copy the text in the odt and paste it on org. If all I'm doing is writing some informal text, no biggie. But when on an academic writing, messing with footnotes I'd be playing with fire to work in that way. So I end up writing a lot of my academic writer in Writer instead of Emacs.
 The obvious easy solution would be to get used to review from screen, directly in the org file. But that wouldn't help whenever I have other people's review of my text, like advisors and other professors (and a lot of them will require something compatible to MS-Word anyway, for them to use track changes).
 So... any technical solutions of different workflows that I haven't considered? How do you deal with that?

 TL;DR:
 So, maybe stack is communicating with some servers, downloading package metadata. (Like Apache Maven downloading .pom files.) It's being silent that makes me worry.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I open a header or quickly scroll through a newly opened org-file, I can see how the buffer is drawn in a different font-size and color and with all the leading stars shown, and then it is quickly repaired. Why is that? Did I set some hook wrong?
 I managed to capture it in the moment being drawn (see picture). A fracture of a second later, all the headings will look like "Szenen allgemein". But this is redundant, I would prefer Emacs not to have to draw everything twice.
 I have custom-set the faces of the headings a little bit bigger and set them to Source Sans Pro font. The colors come from the theme doom-solarized-light. I use org-superstars to change the looking of the stars, but even if I didn't, why are there two stars drawn at first, with org-hide-leading-stars set to t?
 If I add +pretty to the doom module list, this behaviour is gone (although it should only load org-appear and org-fancy-priorities), but then there is some bug, everything gets extremely slow, taking five seconds to load a 1.3M-file and 1-2 seconds to open a header. I don't need org-appear and org-fancy-priorities, so I prefer the setting without the +pretty module.
 Any ideas why the buffer is drawn twice and how I can omit that?

The powerful type system and other facilities provided by Haskell are believed to provide significant advantages in reducing defects and minimizing debugging. But there's a steep learning curve to get to the point you can take advantage of all of that. Are there any studies or data supporting the notion that benefits are worth the costs? Do we see fewer defects, less time debugging, etc? Just curious.

I don't see much in terms of "beginner friendly" documentation, either - almost all the docs is in the form of "example code" (is that the cultural norm in Haskell?), which presumes a fair amount of preexisting Haskell knowledge, depending on what the example actually looks like.

 - changing how the table is exported
 - displaying special overlays within that table 
 - allowing LaTeX-previews of the proof.
 I know this is a bunch of different features, so I need to start adjusting at a very basic level. What seems to be a good idea is to define a new org-element ndproof which allows for just that. Does anyone of you have any experience in how to approach this, or whether this even makes any sense?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I enabled the variable pitch mode in Org but it doesn't work well for some blocks such as the front matter. I added these rules to assure the front matter displays with a fixed pitch font:
 (set-face-attribute 'org-indent nil :inherit '(org-hide fixed-pitch)) (set-face-attribute 'org-document-title nil :inherit 'fixed-pitch) (set-face-attribute 'org-document-info nil :inherit 'fixed-pitch) (set-face-attribute 'org-document-info-keyword nil :inherit '(shadow fixed-pitch) 
 The front matter now displays using a fixed pitch font which is what I want but the indentation is still messed up. It looks like so:
 #+title: Document #+author: Author name #+date: [2022-08-27 Sat 12:50] 
 I would like the indentation in the front matter to be fixed as well. The document, author name, and date don't line up.

 I have a space leak in a quite simple conduit, where I don't understand why this leaks. See the link for a more detailed wiki page about it with pictures of the heap profiles and the output of eventlog2html.
 Basically, this is the end of a conduit pipeline, which reads from a network socket, parses packets with attoparsec and passes it to this conduit, which assigns a number to the packet, gets some fields (integral values) out of the header of the packet, formats this into a Text value as CSV and writes it to a file handle. 
 See here: https://github.com/oswald2/AURIS/wiki/space_leak
 Can somebody explain to me, why that leaks and how to fix it? I am staring at this now for some hours and feel really stupid...

 I'm looking for a way to remove tags from all but one org heading (and its subs) without affecting things like DEADLINE: 
 I use org in a GTD-like manner and have just simplified my projects list to be:
  
Priority_Projects (org heading); and
 Everything else (awaiting, someday, maybe, incubate, reference). 
  
I'd like to loose all the context tags `:home:garage:phone:` etc from everywhere except my priority heading. I can't see a built-in way to do that. Any ideas?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm having trouble getting this function to work right (or properly set the alist). I have Onedrive who's main directory is a symlink and I'd like to keep /Library/CloudStorage urls from being shown throughout Emacs.(macos) The default-dirctory is showing how I want it to.
 ​
 As I understand buffer-file-truename should be using abbrev-file-alist via abbreviate-file-name function to do this.
 I've narrowed my issue down to this function not abbreviating urls.
 ​
 abbrev-file-alist value:
 (("\\`'/Users/username/Library/CloudStorage/OneDrive" . "/Users/username/OneDrive"))
 Function:
 (abbreviate-file-name "/Users/username/Library/CloudStorage/OneDrive")
 Returns:
 "~/Library/CloudStorage/OneDrive"
 Function:
 (abbreviate-file-name "~/Library/CloudStorage/OneDrive")
 Returns:
 "~/Library/CloudStorage/OneDrive"

 Does anyone know what may be wrong with my list?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Re-posting from https://discourse.haskell.org/t/ann-e-graphs-and-equality-saturation-hegg-0-1/4974 (more discussion there)
 I’m happy to announce the first release of the library hegg-0.1 on hackage: hegg: Fast equality saturation in Haskell 12 !
 hegg
 stands for haskell e-graphs good, and it’s a library featuring e-graphs (a data structure that efficiently represents a congruence relation over many expressions) and a high level API for equality saturation (an optimization/term-rewriting technique)
 It is a pure haskell implementation found on two recent awesome papers: egg: Fast and Extensible Equality Saturation 3 (2020) and Relational E-matching 2 (2021).
 I’d love to see what you might come up with leveraging e-graphs and equality saturation (there’s a world of applications – check out the papers and other resources), so do let me know about your efforts and how the library could be improved.
 I’ve spent a long while optimizing and making the e-graphs and equality saturation considerably performant. So we are already pretty fast! (according to my symbolic rewriting tests). I’d love to see more involved use cases, because I still see many opportunities for improving performance, and would love to take them when justified by bigger numbers and applications!
 I’ll be happy to clarify anything,
 Thank you,
 Rodrigo

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've read a lot of tutorials for monads and applicative functors but for some reason it's just not clicking. I understand specific use cases, but I'm having trouble gaining a general intuition of what monads and applicative functors do. For example Typeclassopedia says "the structure of a Applicative computation is fixed, whereas the structure of a Monad computation can change based on intermediate results". By "structure of computation", do they mean that it behaves similar to an if-else statement? Like if b from (a -> m b) is 5, then do x, otherwise do y.
 What I took away from Graham Hutton's video on applicative functors was that they basically are an extension of fmap but for multiple arguments. This made sense, until I thought about the List applicative. pure (+) <*> [1, 2, 3] <*> [1, 2, 3] equals [2, 3, 4, 3, 4, 5, 4, 5, 6], which makes the "multiple arguments" angle confusing. I know that applicative functors can "embedded" functions into context, and that's why the result of the List applicative was so, because of how it models nondeterminism. But idk it just hasn't "clicked" for me yet.
 I was wondering someone could explain the intuition behind monads and applicative functors. Thank you in advanced!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There is an Applicative instance for all the polynomial functors except Sum. Not because no instance is possible but because too many instances are possible. When lifting over different constructors we need to choose how to map one to the other, and which to map.
 Abstracting with Applicatives gives the approach of using an applicative morphism, something that preserves the applicative operations (here idiom) to mediate between between InL and InR. This is the approach used by my idiomatic package.
 instance Natural f g => Applicative (Sum f g) where pure :: a -> Sum f g a pure x = InL (pure x) liftA2 :: (a -> b -> c) -> (Sum f g a -> Sum f g b -> Sum f g c) liftA2 (·) (InL as) (InL bs) = InL do liftA2 (·) as bs liftA2 (·) (InR as) (InR bs) = InR do liftA2 (·) as bs -- these are interesting liftA2 (·) (InL as) (InR bs) = InR do liftA2 (·) (idiom as) bs liftA2 (·) (InR as) (InL bs) = InR do liftA2 (·) as (idiom bs) -- Applicative morphism type Idiom :: (Type -> Type) -> (Type -> Type) -> Constraint class (Applicative f, Applicative g) => Idiom f g where idiom :: f ~> g 
  
Can all Applicative sum types be deconstructed in this way
 Specifically can the Free f Monad
 What would you call this approach and does it appear in the literature

 I just updated my system to ubuntu 22 LTS and emacs 28, and my `C-;` key binding for line commenting is being short-circuited by a system-wide shortcut making a popup window containing the letter 'e' appearing. This shortcut is not listed in the gnome shortcuts, so I really don't know how what it's pointing to and how to disable it... Any ideas?
 ​
 Thank you a lot in advance for your help!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I am trying literate programming and in my attempts to reference a source code block A from source code block B I get the following behavior which is not what i need.
 Is my approach wrong or am I missing something?
 org-version: 9.5.2; emacs-version: 28.1; distribution: spacemacs
 #+name: A #+begin_src js () => { console.log('hello world') } #+end_src #+name: B #+begin_src js :noweb yes let fn = <<A>> #+end_src should the outcome of the expansion be? let fn = () => { console.log('hello world') } Instead I get: let fn = () => { let fn = console.log('hello world') let fn = } 
 I found this article in stack overflow which is very similar if not the same problem I am having; but does not help since it attributes the problem to an old org-mode version.
 Cheers,
 pnoul

 Edit: Taking the suggestion from u/sjrd, I can remove the cast and it compiles but I am still seeing compile errors highlighted in my IDE. They don't arise when actually compiling though. This makes me feel like there has to be a more idiomatic approach.

But there is one issue that worries me: I noticed – more than once – that some files lose their content and do have the content of other files. It happens on saving, I surmise, but I cannot confirm that yet, because so far I have always recognized it later only. Then I wonder why the filename and the title do not match anymore. Luckily, I use git and commit my whole zettelkasten daily, so it's easy to revert. Still, it's disquieting somehow and should be fixed, I guess.
Has anyone here already noticed the same problem?]]></summary>

New here! Been lurking for a bit, been making notes a lot longer. Super quick rundown, as it might be relevant to my question (feel free to skip and jump to the bold sections to tl;dr it):
I've carried a small pocket notebook on me for as long as I can remember, using a numbering convention of XXX.YY.ZZ where X is the "volume" number, Y is the page, and Z is the entry on the page, e.g., 092.04.01
I previously used Standard Notes, creating "discrete" markdown notes that basically just lived on their own (SN can't link); had probably 2 or 3k notes at this point just using that analog numbering system in digital form. My biggest issue, which is now obvious, was the "set it and forget" it nature of unlinked notes, making it a "stale" system.

I just read https://www.fpcomplete.com/haskell/tutorial/exceptions/ while trying to understand why Haskell effects such as Polysemy and RIO don't have a typed error channel (as in ZIO). In particular, this quote:
  
There is no indication at the type level if something throws an exception. You should assume that, unless explicitly documented otherwise, all actions may throw an exception.
  
Meaning, every time I call any `IO`, I can expect an exception, meaning every time I need to use something like `tryIO` and handle the exception. Doesn't that cause a lot of boilerplate? If you have to try every piece of code doesn't it look really defensive? In ZIO you just have to make sure the error channel has the correct type when composing effects, but it will handle short-circuiting for you.

I know they have their own IO monad but I'd still like to use an effects library. I think Polysemy is the closest one. Has anyone used both ZIO and Polysemy/another Haskell libraries? Are they comparable?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the past year, I've been working with Scala on different projects. It's a core tool at my job(for doing Kafka especially), but it was never my favorite; with my background in Python and Go mostly, I did not have a hard time learning enough Scala to write code for Spark and Kafka projects. Specifically, with a lot of example code around the web, it's really easy to find what you are looking for.
 Now I feel like I'm not writing actual good Scala code but a code that only compiles; I only borrow patterns and things I know from other languages, and I think my code is not good quality code, so I'm putting time into learning it seriously, so next time we are writing an application I can make good suggestions about the architecture.
 I'm going to start with the book."Hands-on Scala Programming" I like that it's project-based, so I'll see some enough other than the syntax itself.

 Using Gnus to handle my emails I use nnmail-split-methods to sort my mail into groups, and I also have nnmail-crosspost t so that I get threads that include my sent messages (at least on Google servers). The trouble I have is that there are some auto-emails generated by an external watcher system that writes to an address that I already hav ematching another group. Because cross-posting is enabled, it gets filed in BOTH the group I have just for those emails, and also in my other primary group for that address.
 What I want is a rule that says: "Split to my TO: GROUP UNLESS from the certain address" (ie don't duplicate those particular ones). Does anyone know how to do this?

 Also, because Latex assumes periods after Upper case letters *not* to be sentence-ending, you have to use '\@' when it actually is. ("I like words that start with the letter Z." would become "I like words that start with the letter Z\@."
 Are there equivalents for those in Org mode for when exporting to pdf? 
 Also, I like to set sentence-end-double-space to nil. Is there a way to add the things above to the rules that define sentences in emacs?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm writing a generic library for wrapping some FFI-code neatly.
 The FFI-functions rely on an external context type that can be generated from a configuration type. Essentially, all but initial configuration functions take a pointer to the context as one of their arguments. As part of memory management, I wrap this pointer with finalizers and a reference counter in a newtype that is intended to be pretty opaque to the user. 
 Since I want this library to be polymorphic for different codes wrapped in the same manner, I want to create a typeclass
  class Context c where type RawContext c --type of unwrapped context type RawConfig c --type of unwrapped config 
 With methods that map directly to the utility functions in the FFI-code, and some other instance specific functions. The problem is that most of these methods make no direct reference to c, but rather RawContext c and/or RawConfig c, which makes them ambiguous.
 One solution to this would be to instead use functional dependencies ``` class Context context rawContext rawConfig | context -> rawContext, context -> rawConfig, rawContext -> context, rawConfig -> context, rawContext -> rawConfig, rawConfig -> rawContext where
 ... ```
 but this would result in pretty cumbersome type signatures, which I want to avoid.
 Is it possible to get clean type signatures, as in a class with only one type variable (the wrapped context type) without resorting to AmbiguousTypes? I have not worked with type families much before, but they seem like a cleaner solution for something like this if they are applicable.

 I use the send to buffer quite a lot, so would ideally like a flow of send to python if the python buffer is not visible then open a window, hopefully which works regardless of which python file I am editing in the project.
 I know clojure has a better story for this but would also like the pop up the buffer if its not open for clojure code in case it can be done for one of the languages.

I have no idea what they do, and while the book doesn't cover them, they appear in just about every bit of code that I see. It's almost like you need to know the language but then also understand what the extension is trying to say. How should I reason about language extensions and what they do?

 Now I have many more lines that are like this that I want to type. Currently I just paste the previous line and do a Query Replace. But this is inefficient because the pattern is that only the part after the net_ changes and it is common on both sides (except for capitalization).
 Is there some workflow where I can define some temporary elisp code, then call it with just the suffix, and it automatically generates the next line (with the proper indent and everything).
 For example:
 Some Keybind + workarea
 Should generate
  pub net_workarea => b"_NET_WORKAREA", 
 I know that by the time somone points me in the right direction and I figure it out I could just manually write it :)
 But I would like to take this opportunity to learn if there is an efficient way of doing this.

 ​
  
Nice to hear from you. Doom emacs looks great! (Although I'm too much of a dinosaur to have tried it.) 
 The customization you can do in VSCode, or any other environment, stands in relation to that which can do in emacs as the sounds you can coax from a referee's whistle stand in relation to the music you can play on a piano. 
 But that's not the point. The point is that everything is a buffer -- EIAB. Until one has used emacs enough for that to sink in, one has not really used it, and one might as well stick with VSCode. Pick your favorite shell (bash, zsh, etc.) and make it your default shell in emacs. Then do M-x shell. Start using your new shell. Observe that it is just another buffer. Live with that for a while, until the profundity of it sinks in. Then accept your fate, which is to watch in pity, for the rest of your life, as your non-emacs colleagues struggle to interact with their computers. You're now a deer bounding through the woods, past coyotes chewing their own legs off from the traps they're stuck in. Unfortunately, you can never unsee that vision. Sorry!
  
​
 I'm still using Doom because I like the evil keybindings, but maybe one of you can convince me to fully commit!

We believe that correct, efficient, and reliable builds are critical for

complexity of a project should not be bounded by its build
system, but by what is best to achieve the goal of the project.
Whether you have a large codebase or a small one, whether your project is
polyglot or monolingual, and whether you work in an enterprise organization or
on an open source project - the build system you have available should provide
correct, efficient, reliable builds.

 Whenever I select a region and execute test-overlay, if my cursor is in the region and I hit TAB the overlay disappears, if I'm outside, the normal TAB happens.
 However, if I put these functions in a mode:
 (defun my/remove () "NTS." (interactive) (remove-overlays)) (defvar test-map (let ((map (make-sparse-keymap))) (keymap-set map "TAB" 'my/remove) map)) ;;;###autoload (defun test-overlay () "NTS."

 The keymap is never loaded. And if I put :keymap test-map in define-minor-mode, TAB will execute my/remove even thought it's not on my overlay (which looks normal).
 What am I missing that would make it work?

I have a simple data structre like this: data Document = Document { title :: String, content :: [String], wordCount :: Int } I want to have besides the default constructor where I have to provide a title and the content another one where I just have to provide the title and the content or just the title. And I also want to have a constructor function that creates out of a completely different data structure a Document. I find it pretty nasty to name all these constructor functions differently. Especially since I encountered this problem with a lot of different data structures. So I decided to use ad-hoc polymorphism provided by a generic type-class: class Factory a b where ‏‏‎‏‏‎‏‏‎‏‏‎­ create :: a -> b Which I use like this: instance Factory String ([String] -> Document) where create title words = Document { title = title, words = words, wordCount = 0 } instance Factory String Document where create title = Document { title = title, words = [], wordCount = 0 } instance Factory RawDocument Document where create RawDocument{..} = create title (splitOn " " content) Now I can use simply the create function everywhere with the defined input types. And it scales nicely with all my data structures. Do you see any problems with this approach? I'm really not sure if I'm missing something. I'm just facing one problem: - Either I define the factories in the same module as the data structure, but then I need to live with the name shadowing warnings for values like title and words (I would hate to name them differently since they describe the same thing) - Or I have a separate Factory-Module but then I have to live with the orphan instance warnings. Which is also pretty nasty What do you recommend?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've got the following function:
 (defun my/org-roam-capture-to-link () "In org-roam files, capture to node linked at point." (interactive) (when-let ((_ (org-roam-file-p)) ;; Only act in org-roam files (link-start (car (org-in-regexp org-link-bracket-re 1))) (link (save-excursion (goto-char link-start) (org-element-link-parser))) (id (plist-get (cadr link) :path)) ;; This will fail if there is no node (node (org-roam-node-from-id id))) ;; If there /is/ a node, capture to it. (org-roam-capture- :node node))) 
 This should capture to the org-roam node at the id linked at point, but only if point is at a link to such a node, and I'm in an org-roam file's buffer.
 Normally when I just run org-roam-capture and select an already existing node, no new text is added, and I just add whatever I need to and press C-c C-c.
 Now, If I'm on a link to an org-roam node, and run my/org-roam-capture-to-link interactively with M-x, it does exactly that: nothing new is added, exactly what I want.
 But I wanted to run it from org-metareturn. I added the symbol for the function to org-metareturn-hook. Now if I press M-RET on an appropriate link, I do get an org-roam capture, but it adds an empty heading on a newline (that is, it adds "\n* |", with the cursor at |).
 What's going on? How can I make the meta-return version work like the M-x version?
 Thanks!

 With LSP I'm able to get the behavior of Emacs nearly identical to VSCode. There are some small, nearly ignorable, areas where I do feel like code completion works better in VSC. Where can I get details about what LSP VSC uses for which language? How does it integrate so well with different languages like RJSX and CSS in my Next projects? I'm sure it only has to do with some LSP configs. 
 In Emacs I have to explicitly give the lsp configs whereas VSCode used to do it implicitly, I want to somehow locate what those configs were and then copy them over to Emacs.

 What I then wanted to do was configure vscode for Haskell and so I downloaded the Haskell extension which says ghcup is not installed and that intero isn't as well. At first glance GHCup seems to do the same thing as Stack (a kind of dependency manager). But Stack seems to do more than that, creating projects, testing, etc...
 To add to the confusion, there seems to be a Cabal library and a cabal-install package, both of which I don't understand.
 Not sure where to go from here honestly. At this point, I just want VSCode to work without installing tools that do the same thing. (I said seem to be the same because they are probably not)

I wonder how you work  with different languages in your Zettelkasten.
My problem is that I think about different topics in different languages: 
My question: how do I best deal with this in my Zettelkasten?
So far I tried to write all of my zettels in german, but I realize more and more, that this is sub-optimal: it introduces the added problem of adequate translation and some of the thoughts and arguments loose nuance in translation, or (worse) get added meanings and associations through the translation which weren't there in the original. The mental work of tranlating also introduces additional friction into the system.
How do you deal with this? Do you have a single language Zettelkasten and translate all of your thoughts into your primary language? Or do you mix and match, having Zettels written in different languages in the same Zettelkasten?
Kind regards]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's not surprising most of us find ourselves doing more and more in Emacs as time goes on. Here's an environment that's completely malleable and transparent - a productive playground where workflow and tooling grow organically together, intertwined. 
 I sometimes feel like a blacksmith or the 'primitive technology' youtuber: building tools that make new tools possible, each more powerful and precise than the last, working in concert to open new possibilities. 
 As I think about that comparison, it strikes me that this must be the key to Emacs' allure. Most of our computing tools are delivered to us on a plate, like a modern mass-manufactured product. Impressively engineered and convenient to be sure, but closed and impersonal. In a funny way, I feel Emacs puts us in touch with a much deeper human tradition: moulding and shaping our environment to suit our own needs, instead of being moulded and shaped ourselves.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am facing this problem which on the face of it should be easy to solve but isn't.
 this is my .editorconf:
 root = true [*] indent_style = tab tab_width = 4 end_of_line = lf charset = utf-8 trim_trailing_whitespace = true insert_final_newline = true 
 I am running doom emacs with ts-ls with LSP for javascript.
 I have some files in my project that are indented with 4-width Tabs and that's how I like it. If I change something in them and save they stay properly indented with 4-width Tabs.
 I have other files in the same project that are indented with 2 spaces. I don't want that. I want to be able to convert that to 4-width tab but that does not happen automatically on save, they stay in 2 space formatting.
 Any new file I create in Emacs is also indented with 2 spaces, but if I create the file in VSCode and write some Tab spaced text and open it back in Emacs it stays Tab indented.
 How can I fix this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I find it pretty unintuitive how magit, vterm, rg, and other commands that want to open a new window will interact with a multi-window setup. Sometimes they'll use an existing window, sometimes they'll make a new one. I prefer having things be predictable: terminals always go here, search results go there, and so on. I was looking for ways to tame this, and I found purpose, popper, shackle, and of course, directly hacking on display-buffer-alist.
 I also found winner-undo, which is nice, but I'd like to prevent things from getting messy rather than letting them get bad and then undoing them. And there doesn't seem to be a 'modern' clean approach; i.e., there's no window management equivalent of corfu. (Maybe this is an excuse for me to get my toes wet in actual emacs package development; purpose is probably the closest, but I don't like how it works by advising everything...)

When a PDF file exists on a remote server that is being accessed over an SSH connection and the file is displayed in a dired-mode buffer, I'd like to view the PDF locally in an external reader such as xpdf or acroread on linux (Ubuntu). It wouldn't be that difficult to write up a solution (e.g., download to a temporary directory, perhaps using something like url-retrieve-synchronously), but if a solution already exists, I'd like to start with that. Any ideas how that would be done would be greatly appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Is it possible to set a right margin based on the length of the line, starting at the first character, rather than a specific column?
 My use case is this: I'm writing a document that has various indentation levels, and due to how its processed I can afford (eg) 50 characters on a "line". But the line may be indented so I can't just set the fill-column to 50, since I might be at column 8, 12, 16, etc. indentation. So I'd like it to be 50+column_of_first_character.
 Ideally then things like auto-fill-mode and fill-paragraph and such would work.
 Is this possible?

You will be working in an incredibly talented team with Edward Kmett (chair of the Haskell libraries committee), Jaroslav Tulach (founder of NetBeans, co-creator of GraalVM Truffle), and many more.
 What is Enso?
 From the business perspective, Enso is a no-code interactive data transformation tool.

 The above code will take an input of the form shown below, where the first integer denotes the number of testcases under consideration, and in each of the testcases the first line denotes the size of the list followed by the line under it which contains the elements in the list.

 I however want it to return something of the form

 I'm not sure what changes to make in the mainFun so that the benefits of using ByteStrings and Builders, in terms of the efficient time and space optimisations that they provide are still apparent. Moreover, I'm not certain how to use an efficient looping mechanism there.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Suppose you have a list of org-mode headings each with a property drawer. Suppose you have another list of org-mode headings, in a different buffer, say, each with a property drawer too. I'm looking for a way to update the values of properties of the first list of headings using the second list. So, for example, if I have: 
 * Heading 1 :PROPERTIES: :COLOR: blue :AGE: 5 days :END: * Heading 2 :PROPERTIES: :COLOR: red :AGE: 10 days :END: 
 I want to be able to update it with: 
 * Heading 1 :PROPERTIES: :COLOR: green :END: * Heading 2 :PROPERTIES: :COLOR: orange :END: 
 So that the result is this: 
 * Heading 1 :PROPERTIES: :COLOR: green :AGE: 5 days :END: * Heading 2 :PROPERTIES: :COLOR: orange :AGE: 10 days :END: 
 Now my questions: 
  
Is there some ready-made utility for doing this? 
 If not, can you think of some ready-made utilities that would help with this?
  
I thought I'd check with folks here to see if there's a likely better way than cooking up my own tool.
 I've been reading through the documentation of the org-element and property APIs and I have a very rough sense how to use it for what I want, but I'm having trouble with one issue: 
  
how do I get the list of properties (with or without their values) in the first list of headings so I get candidate properties to update using the second list? 
  
I understand org-entry-properties is a place to start, but I only want the properties explicitly listed in the property drawer. (If I call org-entry-properties on the first heading in the initial list, I get this: 
 (("CATEGORY" . "???") ("AGE" . "5 days") ("COLOR" . "blue") ("BLOCKED" . "") ("FILE") ("PRIORITY" . "B") ("ITEM" . "Heading 1")) 
 Can I just assume that there is a fixed list of default properties that will always be included in such a list?

 anyway, 
 Here is the documentation I'm following: https://github.com/hlissner/evil-multiedit 
 First, I can't find the 'evil-multiedit-default-keybinds' that it mentions. But then I noticed that the commands pallete already shows some keybinds. 
 When I try to execute 'evil-multiedit-match-and-next' it shows (M-d) as the keybind. It even says so at bottom that I should use 'M-d' if I execute the command in the pallete by hitting return. But in the actual editor if I try to use 'M-d' it says: 'I-Search Backward: [No Previous Search String]'. 
 I have not created any new keybinds myself. I'm just very much working on defaults so far.
 How can I fix this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've recently started using org-journal along with my (fledgling) usage of org itself. I like the thought of periodically exporting things to HTML to make it viewable in my browser-of-choice. What I'm wondering, is, is there a way to have the export roll all of the journal files into a single destination file? I.e., perhaps an org-file that when exported will import all the files matching the name-pattern and include them?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So this has happened a couple of times -- I'm not sure not how I'm triggering it -- but when saving a file I've accidentally gone into decipher-mode. Once in that mode:
  
I don't seem to be able to exit it without killing the buffer and re-opening it.
 more dramatically, that mode seems to disable undo somehow and thus it permanently munges my file.
 decipher-undo doesn't seem to do, well, anything.
  
So does anyone know how to unf*** the damage done by accidentally triggering decipher-mode? Alternatively, suggestions on how to make the decipher-mode function a noop in case it does get triggered?
 thx
 NOTE: 
  
(defun decipher-mode () t) 
  
thus making it non-interactive seems like it could help I have no idea what might be using decipher-mode under the hood.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new version of LeanCheck is out (v1.0.0). LeanCheck is a property testing library (like QuickCheck) that tests values enumeratively.
 Example. Here is a simple example of LeanCheck in action showing that sorting is idempotent and list union is not commutative:
 > import Test.LeanCheck > import Data.List (sort, union) > check $ \xs -> sort (sort xs) == sort (xs::[Int]) +++ OK, passed 200 tests. > check $ \xs ys -> xs `union` ys == ys `union` (xs::[Int]) *** Failed! Falsifiable (after 4 tests): [] [0,0] 
 LeanCheck works on all types that are instances of the Listable typeclass and is able to derive instances automatically using either Template Haskell or GHC.Generics. See LeanCheck’s Haddock documentation for more details. LeanCheck is compatible with Hspec, Tasty and test-framework.
 What's new? Version 1.0.0 signalizes stability in the API. LeanCheck has not actually changed much in the past couple of years and there are no significant differences between the early 0.9 series.
 Installing. You can find LeanCheck on Hackage or GitHub. It is also tracked on Stackage. You can install it with:
 $ cabal install leancheck

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I use org-roam-bibtex together with a helm-bibtex interface, and a master .bib file generated by Zotero. I'm able to comfortably create an Emacs frame, launch helm-bibtex and then select a paper I want to read. 
 Using the Fn keys, I can select whether I want to view the .pdf of the paper, or open the .org note file associated with it -- and if there are no notes, I am lead to an org-roam-capture template that creates a new notes file for me. From the notes file, I can invoke org-noter to view both the.pdf file and add notes to the note file at the same time.
 I would like to do something slightly different now. I typically use helm-bibtex to open the .pdf file of the reference directly, using pdf-tools. I browse the file, and add highlights, etc. I now want to open org-noter and view the associated notes, or if no notes file exists, use org-roam-capture to create it. 
 Unfortunately, I can't see any way of doing this at the moment. The best I can do is invoke org-noter and add notes to files listed in org-noter-default-files-name, so that all the notes end up in the same file. 
 Is there a function or hack I can use to get org-noter to search for an associated notes file for my .pdf, or use my org-roam-capture-template to create such a notes file?

 What is the syntax for including the file name in the reference, ie something along the lines of "filename::TableRef"?

 tldr; what are your tips for recording in emacs? 
 background
 I work in a legal environment. Sometimes I need to seek costs for time spent on a matter ('project' - I guess in emacs terms)
 I came to emacs a year or so ago via the Doom/org/org-roam popularity explosion.
 what I do now
 I tried using timers in org, but they are easy to forget to 'end'
 So, I use an excel spreadsheet, which has the same issue, but the empty cell helps remind me visually to enter my finish time on a task.
 It also has validation, functions etc that let me analyse and summarise my data
 what I'd like to do
 My workflow really could use:
  
Automatic time recording, for time spent editing documents;
 something smart enough not to cause me to seek costs for making a coffee, or leaving my computer on during lunch;
 some kind of reporting on the time spent
  
I've seen a few solutions for emacs - wakatime, buffer timer, activity-watch-time etc, and was wondering what everyone's experience of those, or any self-made systems, are

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey friends,
 I'm using the following code in my init.el to build my agenda from all Roam nodes with the Project filetag:
 ;; The buffer you put this code in must have lexical-binding set to t! ;; See the final configuration at the end for more details. (defun my/org-roam-filter-by-tag (tag-name) (lambda (node) (member tag-name (org-roam-node-tags node)))) (defun my/org-roam-list-notes-by-tag (tag-name) (mapcar #'org-roam-node-file (seq-filter (my/org-roam-filter-by-tag tag-name) (org-roam-node-list)))) (defun my/org-roam-refresh-agenda-list () (interactive) (setq org-agenda-files (my/org-roam-list-notes-by-tag "Project"))) ;; Build the agenda list the first time for the session (my/org-roam-refresh-agenda-list) 
 The above is taken from a System Crafters video on YouTube. Show notes here.
 The problem I'm running into is that when I launch Emacs, I get an error that the symbol org-roam-node-list is void and my agenda launches as empty until I use org-roam-node-find to open up a node that has that Project filetag.
 After that point, the symbol I previously mentioned is no longer void and the agenda buffer is populated as expected.
 I should also mention that the code above is within the :config portion of use-package.
 Does anyone know what changes I might implement so that org-roam-node-list is not void upon launching Emacs?
 All the thanks in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am able to test the following issue on Emacs versions 25 to 27. Due to the tramp connection crashing the entire Emacs instance for me on Emacs 28 and 29 using El Capitan on my mac, I don't know if this particular behavior with directory-files-and-attibutes still exists. Before opening the proverbial "Pandora's Box" by submitting a formal bug report, is anyone able to confirm whether Emacs 29 currently behaves the same and (if known) why that is the case? [It is a Pandora's Box because I would potentially be assisting in debugging the crashes, before getting to the underlying issue.]
 Step #1: Establish a remote Tramp session over ssh.
 Step #2: Call directory-files-and-attributes using the following optional arguments:
 (directory-files-and-attributes "/ssh:user@01.23.456.789:/home3/lawlist" t nil t nil)
 Step #3: The return value includes both the starting directory, and the parent of the starting directory. [FYI: If there are lots of files/folders, the default settings of Emacs will truncate the list that gets returned ... so, either increase the print length or use something like (message "%s" ....) to avoid truncation.]
 /ssh:user@01.23.456.789:/home3
 /ssh:user@01.23.456.789:/home3/lawlist
 EXPECTED BEHAVIOR: Do not return the starting directory, and do not return the parent directory of the starting directory.

 The problem is that the theme is loaded using the hardcoded load-theme function.
 I would like to use the modus-operandi as my default color scheme because it is part of Emacs. However, if I have a 3rd party color scheme installed and I enable that using consult-theme is it possible to make Emacs remember and load that the next time I restart the editor?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the controversies I've set up elsewhere is the provocative statement that "Haskell is for s-code". That is to say, since Haskell has a very low refactoring cost, it's possible to just scratch out anything (this is a bit extreme) that works, then refactor it into clean code, something that is more difficult in languages with substantial refactoring costs.
 ​
 There's also something that seems to be "pseudocode-driven development", i.e, you scratch out something in undefined and error "todos", and constantly branch downwards, and the type system might force you to play Type Tetris, but you can often hash something out before you work on refactoring and optimizing it.
 ​
 I wouldn't call myself an experienced Haskeller; hell, by the definition "you're not a real Haskeller until you've written your first compiler" I'm not a Haskeller. A question to more experienced Haskellers: is Haskell as a language for prototyping then refactoring a useful definition? If so, what are the limitations of such (a recent project had to be completely rewritten because I lost the ability to understand the code, despite constantly using long variable names)?
 ​
 And if only-okay quality Haskell code can be refactored constantly, can Haskell be sold as a language, for, well, s-code? That's a bit too "marketer-speak", as it completely upends common perceptions of Haskell, but the weaker and more polite "prototype code" or "draft code" might have sway. But the more radical terminology, one, attracts attention, and second, makes Haskell seem approachable ("you mean I don't have to be a rocket scientist to be productive in Haskell?").

 I might have found a way to make my config more scalable. For context, my config file is a 200LOC litterate config (I know.

Moreover, every time I migrate my emacs config, the initial startup time (use-package downloads everything) is annoyingly high (I just checked, it was about 7 minutes).
 The solution
 Lazy load (and install!) everything. nn I wrote a small library that lets you define your packages and their configuration as a dependency graph. A package will be loaded (and installed, if necessary) when a dependent package gets loaded, or when a generated placeholder function gets run.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone! 
 I've just released version 0.9.0 of the dunai libraries, which comes with version 0.13.6 of bearriver. 
 For those unfamiliar, dunai is a reactive programming library structured around a notion of Monadic Stream Functions. dunai can be used to implement other reactive and FRP frameworks on top, including Classic FRP and Arrowized FRP variants. bearriver itself is an API-compatible implementation of Yampa. All versions of GHC from 7.6 to 9.4 are supported.
 Release information
 This is mainly a maintenance release. Among other changes, this version improves the documentation in dunai-test. Additionally, a function that was exposed unnecessarily is being deprecated in preparation for its future removal.
  
Release: https://github.com/ivanperez-keera/dunai/releases/tag/v0.9.0.
 
Hackage:
  
dunai: https://hackage.haskell.org/package/dunai.
 dunai-test: https://hackage.haskell.org/package/dunai-test
 bearriver: https://hackage.haskell.org/package/bearriver
 
 
Repo: https://github.com/ivanperez-keera/dunai.
 
 Upcoming changes
 We are synchronizing releases with the Yampa project to ensure that bearriver incorporates any changes added to Yampa. Additionally, the goal is to eventually use Yampa's tests also to give bearriver full test coverage.
 Two changes are being discussed that will potentially affect users:
 - The introduction of a new constraint in VectorSpace in simple-affine-space would alter the type constraints of some functions. See #298.
  
A re-structuring of the API to better reflect the purpose of the implementation. This could also lead to a division of dunai into multiple libraries. See #305.
  
The next release is expected to be published on October 21, 2022.
 Happy Haskelling!

 This is testing a custom sum function. What do you think of this? While we are at it, what are some actual unit testing libraries I should look into. I have stack downloaded and I am using stack test to run my tests.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi there people. I’m fairly new to the zettlekasten system. I have some things to ask you guys.
Do you throw away your literature notes and fleeting notes after turning them into permanent notes?
I have been taking literature notes for a couple of days now and it’s getting difficult and difficult lately to organize them.
Should I just throw them away?
Or should I keep and organize them despite it taking a lot of time?
Or should I keep them without organizing?]]></summary>

For overlays mode: drawers are not hidden (not folded). I could not find how to hide it by default. I do have org-cycle-hide-drawer-startup set to True.
 For text-properties mode: search in a buffer does not unfold sub-headings. If a content is hidden in 3rd or 4th level, it is a pain to reach to it. Also, in org-roam backlinks, it does not hide backlinks id. I don't know how to fix this.
  
Ideally, I would like to use text-properties since it is supposed to be fast but with the above two customization. I would appreciate any directions. An alternate solution is welcome too. Thanks!

Not sure if this is the intended use of verbatim, which has its own face defined, whereas escaping org-emphasis marker treats it a regular text you don't want emphasized. I guess I can disable the face for verbatim, but that means losing a default marker.
 
Assuming org-hide-emphasis-markers is enabled, is there a way to yank the text without the emphasis-markers as is? In Evil, yanking the emphasized text includes the markers.

Let's assume I'll need to forward my org-clock-report to my boss at the end of the week to show how much time I spent on project a or activity b.
 I was thinking one way to do this was with a workflow state of something like DAILY or TRACK or ONG (ongoing) and a custom agenda view that compartmentalizes those tasks so I can clock in and out of them easily.
 Any other ideas on how to do this?

 The changelog (https://hackage.haskell.org/package/unix-2.8.0.0/changelog) is full of improvements, big and small. Among most important ones are support for Abstract FilePath Proposal (say goodbye to type FilePath = String) and compatibility with WebAssembly platform (stay tuned for GHC 9.6).
 This release would never happen without a new team of maintainers: Viktor Dukhovni and Julian Ospald, and is a culmination of contributions from 36 volunteers, who spent their time and effort to improve unix. Thanks all!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, I'm 28, I've been coding since I was 14. started with easy-eclipse (I know, lol), then moved to eclipse. Used that for a while, even through college, although I also became really handy with Vim. In my first job, I started using IntelliJ and I just loved it (scala developer), as far as IDEs go nothing touches IntelliJ if your focus is deep git integration, debugging, code completion and stuff. Now, I use VSCode. 
 I have ALWAYS wanted to learn Emacs though. Always seemed so cool. Just seems like I need to learn to be an OG. It's a stupid thought, I know, but it is nonetheless. Just that whenever I would try, I have twice, I would keep fighting with it for simple tasks and then some important work would come up and I'd jump back to a familiar editor to get things done quickly. 
 I've been reading a lot about how VSCode is just about a better editor than Emacs now. Many Emacs lovers are making videos or writing articles on how much they love VSCode now. I really want to try Emacs again. I'm asking the community to either convince me and welcome me to the fold or convince me to not use it and stay with VS Code. I am VERY sure I'm not the only person who would benefit from this post. Others must be in similar situations.

 I find Haskell really interesting and I have been reading Learn you a Haskell, but I would like to start working towards some project-based learning. 
 I’ve been watching this Reddit and a few other languages (C, C++, etc) and once in a while I’ll see a post about someone learning for a year and then finding a job. I’ve always wondered, what types of projects would I need to master to put me at the level of being able to find work based on those skills?

 My main gripe is the handleKeys function in the end. I thought a Picture which is a simple window can be redrawn with a grid in it when an event is fired. That is about it. But I have not managed to change any simple event to a new Behavior which is a redrawn Picture.
 Can anyone comment ? I may have coded this completely wrongly.
 Compiler error is this.
  Couldn't match type ‘Picture’ with ‘Behavior Picture’ Expected type: Moment (Behavior Picture)

 Can i use org-mode tables (or something like that for Emacs) for accounting trading transactions? (now i'm using Joplin with Markdown)
 https://preview.redd.it/cppm0oeamti91.png?width=400&format=png&auto=webp&s=38970aeb6ae54c11871e7ce3f54e50638a3bf2c8
 Like on screenshot:
 - Save time
 - Summarize daily earnings
 e.t.c
 ​
 And most important: 
 1) I want it to automatically calculate profit / losses. I known that Emacs can do some arithmetic operations with tables, using patterns like that: 
 ​
 #+TBLFM: $3=($2 - u/-1$2)/7::$5=$Weeks*$Rent; %.2f
 ​
 2) And i want automatically create tables or just string that show me, how much i win and lose, summarizing week and month (profit / lose).
 Example:
 Week: -10$
 Month: +100$
 ​
 I'm just wondering, it is generally possible or not. I really like Emacs ecosystem and its flexibility. Markdown is very limited in comparison with Org-Mode, plus Joplin is pretty bloated software... 
 ​
 P.S. Sorry for my English, I hope, you understood me. Thanks! :-)

 Where the ^M is a newline character, I guess.
 How could I print progress like it does on a terminal into the process buffer, overwriting the previous % and respecting newlines? I have looked at process filters but cannot understand how I would write one.

 After further tests with a variety of numbers it is clear that emacs see a sequence of numbers with an e in the middle as a number in E notation format.
 How can I coerce the values in the columns to be seen as strings?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am very particular about how text appears in the text editor. I cannot compromise on poorly rendered font. In an attempt to make text in emacs on Windows look crisp, I tried several fonts. I blamed the fonts that they are not good and kept trying different fonts.
 Then I installed MacType. The before and after of using MacType is huge. I do not need any custom fonts out on the internet there and was settled on Consolas. 
 So if you are like me or having issues try installing MacType. 
 https://www.mactype.net/
 Note: Make sure that the MacType service is running before you launch emacs. I run the emacs server in the startup and it didn't render the fonts properly. I had to make sure of this dependency.

 I found this code on emacs stackexchange showing how cl-loop is used to gather information from an org-table
  #+NAME: my-filter #+BEGIN_SRC elisp :var tbl=table1 val="USA" :colnames y (cl-loop for row in tbl if (equal (nth 3 row) val) collect row into newtbl finally return newtbl) #+END_SRC 
 I tried something similar with cl-loop but failed terribly, so I switch back to my trusty dolist.
 #+BEGIN_SRC elisp :var tbl=ParedTable val="." :results output raw (let ((somevar '())) (dolist (row tbl) (add-to-list 'somevar (append (list (nth 2 row)) (nth 0 row)))) somevar) #+END_SRC 
 The code creates an alist from some columns of a table.
 How can I used the cl-loop to accomplish the same thing?

 A couple of days ago there was a post about org-noter. It looked like not everyone is aware of the package and what it does so I recorded a short screencast to highlight it's features. 
 org-noter is a annotation package that helps extract content from PDFs/Epubs/DjVus. It has a lot of promise for incremental reading/learning so I'm planning to work on it myself. My hope is that by making this someone else decides to contribute as well.

He altered it a little to describe it as learning from people vs learning from nature, arguing in favour of spending your time learning from nature.
In a programmers context, he argued spending your time learning React, Javascript etc. is less valuable than learning meta knowledge. Object skills help get a job, but are not timeless like statistics, math, algorithm analysis, physics (ok physics isn't timeless but it is until a better theory comes along or assumptions are falsified) etc.
I googled this distinction and came across a LessWrong article titled Object level and Meta level. The topic introduces a distinction between knowledge: the object level and the meta level.…]]></summary>

  * First Level Heading :first: ** Second Level Heading :second: *** Third Level Heading :third: 
 However, when I open the org file in a simple text editing software such as GNOME's Text Editor, this is how tags align (notice the one character shift):
  * First Level Heading :first: ** Second Level Heading :second: *** Third Level Heading :third: 
 I've noticed that there is an org-tags-column variable in Emacs which is set to a value of -77 by default. I tried changing it and refreshing the tags list with C-u C-c C-q. The only thing it does is how things align in Emacs, but it doesn't change the fact that the tags don't align when viewing the document with a different text editing software.

 Emacs creates an .emacs~ file automatically.
 I've also created an .emacs file, in both I have
 (add-to-list 'custom-theme-load-path "~/.emacs.d/themes/")
 But emacs can't find shit. Any clue why?
 Edit:
 Somehow the custom-theme-load-path is somewhere else in Program Files instead of %Appdata%/.emacs.d/themes/.
 For someone stumbling across the same problem:
 Emacs\emacs-28.1\share\emacs\28.1\etc\themes
 Edit2:
 Solved by creating init.el instead of .emacs in /%appdata%/.emacs.d
 i.e. /%appdata%/.emacs.d/init.el instead of /%appdata%/.emacs.d/.emacs
 And inside .init.el:
 (add-to-list 'custom-theme-load-path "~/.emacs.d/themes/")

 The servers I had access to at work were huge and powerful but so many people were using them 24/7 that the interaction was slow. 
 Starting Emacs was slow.
 Eventually I got my Pentium PC to run Linux and that was a magical moment. I logged in and started Emacs. I was blown away It just popped up.
 So much power in my hands. 
 Pop forwards to today. I am running Ubuntu on a nice Core9 with 32GB. Immensely powerful. Starting Emacs takes time. How can it be that with all this power it is slower?
 Then last week I installed OpenBSD 7 on a much slower system. I logged in. Installed Emacs. I started it up and --bang-- it is up. Just like in 1993/4. 
 Now this is all using the standard OpenBSD and Ubuntu Emacs packages. With 0 customizations, configs, or anything else.
 My guess would be that if I dug into the packages I would find that the Ubuntu default has more stuff in it.
 It was a nostalgic feeling though.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am very new to Emacs, I see the potential it has, but I want to make sure I can accurately describe it to others. I have made-up my own explanation of Emacs, and I just want to make sure I'm not saying anything blatantly wrong. 
  
Emacs is more than a text editor, it's a Lisp interpreter. Anything you can code with Lisp, you can do in Emacs. Much like how a web browser is just an HTML (& CSS & Javascript) Interpreter. Anything you can write in HTML, you can make a web browser do. 
 However, web browsers are external to your computer. You can use a web browser to edit a photo, but you have to upload the photo, do the edits, and then download the photo again, and that's inefficient. Emacs works completely on your system, using your computer's resources to their fullest potential. A web browser could never make files or folders on your computer, but Emacs can, and incorporate so much more into your system. 
  
This is the assumption I've managed to get out of my first few days with Emacs. Let me know if I'm letting some large component out, or if even this is just scratching the surface of what Emacs can do.

Dynamic Exception Reporting in Haskell by Matt Parsons

Exceptions kind of suck in Haskell. You don’t get a stack trace. They don’t show up in the types of functions. They incorporate a subtyping mechanism that feels more like Java casting than typical Haskell programming.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I am a graduate of Applied mathematics and computer science, have been passionate about Haskell for a couple years, it single-handedly got me into programming as a hobby and now I want to connect my professional career with it.
 About my qualifications. I took the MetaLamp education program which included a good set of books, for example Kurt's Get Programming with Haskell. In my free time I also read a couple, like Functional design and architecture. Some codewars catas and video courses with tasks were also conquered. I completed two educational projects: multi messenger chat bot and news server. Both projects were reviewed by the company's devs. Currently learning Plutus.
 So I am looking for the employer who will be willing to take an young and eager developer into their ranks, preferably on remote basis. I don't have a specific technology stack or problem to work on in mind.
 Also worth noting that I am currently in Russia, but relocation to near abroad is possible.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi emacs friends,
 your expertise and wisdom is required.
 Please let me first describe my use case.
 I'm using electric pair (https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/ElectricPair) and my humble init for this is like
 (electric-pair-mode 1) (setq electric-pair-pairs '((?\{ . ?\}) (?\( . ?\)) (?\[ . ?\]) (?\" . ?\"))) 
 Which is sufficient for coding and simple text. For org-mode however I also want to use the "electric pairing" for "*" (and maybe other markup features in org-mode like "~" for example).
 So I added
 (add-hook 'org-mode-hook (lambda () (setq electric-pair-pairs (append electric-pair-pairs '((?\* . ?\*)))))) 
 Problem here is that is now set for all the other modes as well which I don't want.
 I only want this to be appended for org-mode buffers nothing else.
 Due to a lack of fantasy I don't even know how to approach this.
 ​
 Any help is highly appreciated. Thanks for your time guys!

A NixOS specialisation is a mechanism to describe additional boot entries

When do you need specialisations
You may have hardware occasionally connected to your computer, and some
of these devices may require incompatible changes to your day-to-day

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone,
 I am thinking about releasing a new library which is basically pandas for Haskell. It is built around a data frame type represented as a mapping from column names to column vectors.
 I am looking for suggestions for the name of the library and the name of the datatype.
 Similar existing libraries: tables (Data.Table) and Frames (Frames.Frame).
 My suggestions: 
  
pandas and Data.DataFrame
 hsPandas and Data.DataFrame
 handas and Data.DataFrame
  
Reason: Pandas and its DataFrame type are so ubiquitously used for and associated with the use-cases this library addresses, that I think discoverability of the library would benefit from having pandas in its name.

 I'd like to make a presentation with org and beamer export with a lot of images. When writing beamer tex directly with \usebackgroundtemplate before starting the frame environment.
 ``` \usebackgroundtemplate{\includegraphics[width = \the\paperwidth , height = \the\paperheight]{./P8091762.JPG}}
 \begin{frame} ..... ``` Setting the background seems to be the easiest way to achieve what I want? Edit: That is, I want images that take up the whole slide without any margins.
 Is there any way to set the background per slide using org-beamer-mode? Seems I cant insert raw latex between the frame environments with #+latex:, the line will end up inside a frame environment and not work. Can I somehow tell the export to insert the line after closing the environment? Or is there an org-beamer-mode parameter I can set per heading that I missed?

 Moreover, no changes have been made for about 3 years in its github repo..
 Do you have an alternative to org-noter, do you use a fork?
 ​
 Thanks you in advance for yours answers

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I want to do some scientific writing for fun, for which I want to be able to insert citations and bibliographies directly in org-mode. I don't want to use latex and/or render org files in any other format; what I want to achieve is something like:
 * Some text [1] [1] - Full reference from a global bib file 
 where both the numbering and bibliography section are updated on a command/keystroke. I use citar to insert references into org files - that works great - but I have no idea how to generate bibliography and numbering. So far most of the advice I found online was related to rendering bibliography in latex / html, which is not what I need.
 I would be really grateful for some pointers. Thanks!

For example., any Enums I encounter should be converted to a sealed trait and case objects rather than a plan case class. Duplicate case classes should be avoided and so on. 
 Is there any compatible library already available that can do what I need?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you use Slick, please try 3.4.0-RC3 by changing the version in your build.
 After a week, if no regressions have been reported we will G-d willing release 3.4.0 (final).
 3.4.0 is mostly about moving to a more efficient community-maintained model. A huge number of community-contributed fixes and improvements are included. Furthermore, a ton of work has been put into automating things so that merging pull requests, keeping the documentation website up to date, and cutting releases can be done effortlessly.
 You can see the draft release notes here and the upgrade guide at https://scala-slick.org/doc/prerelease/upgrade.html#upgrade-from-3-3-x-to-3-4-0. The latest docs are at https://scala-slick.org/doc/prerelease/index.html.
 After 3.4.0 is released, the top priority is Scala 3 support, G-d willing. Stefan Zeiger, the original author of Slick, wrote an implementation already, but there is work that still needs to be done to get it ready for consumption. I plan to release the result as 3.5.0.
 After that, I would like to see Slick evolve freely.
 If you would like to get involved, feel free to DM me. Or, help fund Slick by sponsoring me: https://github.com/sponsors/nafg.
 P.S. GitHub Discussions is enabled and there is now a #slick channel on the main Scala Discord: https://discord.gg/yQheBhUtAa

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A few years ago I was browsing the Evernote forum and I remember a member who described his method of organizing notes by putting all of them into one single folder called "Inbox" and he did not use the folder or tagging feature of the software at all.
 The only thing he did was attaching tags in the title of notes using hash signs (if I recall correctly) or he named the titles in such a way that they included the tags in the title, like so:
 Title of Note #tag #tag2 #tag3 Title of Note2 #tag #tag2 #tag3 Title of Note3 #tag #tag2 #tag3 
 I was thinking about using the same approach. For example, I just want some main headings (computer, health, home, etc..)
  * Computer :computer: ** Manage Your Email in Emacs With Mu4e 
 I would need to tag the second level heading but since I wrote the title in such a way that it contains the tags, does it worth it? The title already includes the relevant tags: email, emacs, and mu4e.
 Similar:
  ** How to Install Apache and PHP on Fedora Linux The keywords apache, php, fedora, and linux are all included in the title 
 This way I can search with swiper or consult-line and find the notes easily. The only thing is to write concise titles that are rich in relevant keywords.
 Of course tags have their own benefit but the more I was thinkering with them the more confused I got.
 What do you think about this approach? I would be curious about your opinion.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Continuing the theme of me reading Algebra-driven Design, I tried to play around with the quickspec library. I set up a stack project, added quickspec-2.1.5@sha256:very-long-sha to extra-deps, and when I tried to build the thing, I got an error with a suggestion to add twee-lib-2.2@sha256:another-very-long-sha to me extra deps. So I did, and right now I'm getting this:
 Twee/Term.hs:92:28: error: Ambiguous occurrence 'singleton' It could refer to either 'Twee.Term.Core.singleton', -- stuff here or 'Data.List.singleton', -- more stuff here 
 and the same in several other places when stack tries to build twee-lib. I have no fancy compiler options enabled, the whole stack config is pretty basic. Is anyone able to use this lib? What am I missing?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just in time for the start of the school year, I'm happy to announce the public release of hwtest, a Scala 3 library for problem sets (generically, "homeworks"). This is a near-total rewrite of a homegrown system I've been using with students since 2013.
 The basic idea is that the teacher creates some problems to solve, and some test cases for those problems. The students then implement the functions and can check their work against the test cases.
 A starter file might look like this: ``` object hwExample extends hwtest.hw("CS123"): def userName = ??? 
 def square(x: Int): Int = ???
 test("square", square, "x") 
 def isOdd(n: Int): Boolean = ??? ignoretest("isOdd", isOdd, "n")  The student would fill in their name  def userName = "Margaret Hamilton"  and then take a stab at the first function  def square(x: Int): Int = x * x  Then run their code to check their work:  Margaret Hamilton Data source: hwExample.tests (remote) Begin testing square at Tue Aug 16 10:12:48 EDT 2022 ..... Passed 5/5 tests in 0.71 seconds. ***** Ignoring tests for isOdd.  Next they change the `ignoretest` to `test`, and take a stab at the second function. Re-running the code, they get  CS123: hwExample (hwtest 1.0.0) Margaret Hamilton Data source: hwExample.tests (remote) Begin testing square at Tue Aug 16 10:15:22 EDT 2022 ..... Passed 5/5 tests in 0.44 seconds. Begin testing isOdd at Tue Aug 16 10:15:23 EDT 2022 .... Test #5 *** FAILED *** n = -21 Expected answer: true Received answer: false Passed 4/5 tests in 0.09 seconds. ```
 Obviously, we also want our students to learn how to make their own tests, so I wouldn't use this ALL the time, but it works great for less experienced students who are learning to program.

 This code compiles fine in ghci.
 func :: (Num a) => a -> a -> a func a b = a + b func' :: (Num a) => a -> a func' = func f f :: Integral a => a f = 2 
 But this gives an error saying,
  * Could not deduce (Integral a) arising from a use of `f' from the context: Num a bound by the type signature for: func' :: forall a. Num a => a -> a at test.hs:6:1-26 Possible fix: add (Integral a) to the context of the type signature for: func' :: forall a. Num a => a -> a * In the first argument of `func', namely `f' In the expression: func f In an equation for func': func' = func f | 7 | func' = func f | ^ 
 But if I change the second function as,
 func :: (Num a) => a -> a -> a func a b = a + b func' :: (Integral a) => a -> a func' = func f f :: Integral a => a f = 2 
 This compiles fine.
 I was expecting the second snippet to work, cause an Integral Instance is a Num Instance. Why can I pass a Num Instance to a function expecting Integral Instance (First code snippet), Since a Num Instance may or may not be an Integral Instance.
 Assuming I cannot pass an Integral Instance to a Num Instance, why did the third code snippet not throw an error? clearly func expects a Num Instance while it is given f which returns an Integral Instance.
 Any blogs or video links about the Haskell type system and how the type hierarchy works which addresses issues like this would be helpful. Relevant answers are also welcomed Ofcourse.

If I understand well, Haskell is not exactly implementing System F, since we can have non-halting functions. But on the other hand, can the halting of a function for another reason than laziness constitute a proof for the theorem corresponding to its type? I also wonder how can one implement the existential quantifier.

 Can someone explain? Thanks.
 p/s: I created an issued on the author's github repo https://github.com/jmgimeno/algorithm-design-with-haskell/issues/1
 Edit: my mistake, the GitHub repo is not from the author.
 Edit: sorry everyone, my mistake again, I missed the point that the domain and codomain of f are natural numbers.
 Edit: Thank you everyone. I think I understand the reasoning now. Because the domain and codomain are natural numbers, f can only increase its argument, so x < f(x) < f(x+1)

 As toy-projects I consider the infamous quick-sort or primes example or stuff like unlimited queues. They are nice indeed, but shouldn't be used to sell a language (so quick-sort and primes died in defending success at all costs).
 I sometimes use lazy eval to calculate small ad-hoc lists on-the-fly (which are mostly optimized out by GHC magic) to feed them to various functions, but otherwise I think I don't benefit from lazy eval really? Mostly I hate that I don't like when GHC magic kicks in and when not?
 Do I need to learn Core to write performant Haskell (because I didn't have to learn intermediate compiler languages when I used OCaml, Java or Python)?
 Cheers.

 In the past, I've seen various comments about how Scala 2's type system was not sound, and several other scathing remarks from, eg Edward Kmett. See this quora post or this reddit comment for instance. 
 I'm curious if Scala 3 has overcome some of these difficulties, especially with how implicits have been reworked and enums have been introduced to implement ADTs. 
 Beyond that, I'm wondering how folks feel about Scala coming from Haskell. For the simple case, I like how close it looks to Python, which I write for work, but I worry that encoding of some abstractions is just plastered on -- I wasn't very encouraged by Zio and Cats examples, I saw, for instance. Perhaps that's just owing to a syntax as light-weight as Haskells, though?

I know it's really nothing major, just bothers me a bit and i'm wondering if this is a common occurrence with emacs or is it just my system. It can happen more often when folding-unfolding headers in an org file, just a small delay (~1sec) at random, for the action to perform. Not searching for the magic solution, just wanted to see if it is just me or if i might be doing something wrong.
 Thanks for taking the time to read this.
 P.S. My config is really minimal, just the colorscheme, ivy, haskell mode, yasnippet, auctex and my key maps. Also my pc is 7 yo but its more than capable of running intense tasks, and i think vanilla Emacs isn't one of them.

I recently got to watching a video comparing INTJ's and INTPs in computer programming, and some of the points the youtube creator made had me pondering if emacs use skews more heavily into any particular typing. 
 Clearly not the type of thing I'll be able to easily google so I figured might as well make an informal ask on the sub. 
 So if you're aware of mbti and care at all, what is your type?

 Have also been researching smart contracts on Eth and trying to understand the possible implications of allowances, and spending permissions, say for staking on ERC20 tokens. 
 I was directed to some chain explorers to find and revoke these permissions on Eth. 
 Wondering a few things in relation to ADA. Does the function of staking and eUTXO make smart contract risks, or allowances any different than on other chains? 
 Are there any sort of tools or contract checkers on ADA for lookups? 
 Hopefully this isn't an annoying or improper post. I understand Haskell is used for many other applications, but my question is ADA specific.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi there,
 I am an Emacs newbie coming from vim. So far I really like the Emacs experience! However, I still struggle with a very simple task: I like having an internal border around my frame, which I set via the default-frame-alist list. While that works fine I am not able to automatically adjust the internal-frame color to the theme's background color. I can do it manually buy using
 (defun my/adjust_internal_border_color () "Adjust the internal border color to match the theme's background color" (custom-set-faces! '(internal-border :background "#FAFAFA" ;; (format "%s" (upcase (prin1-to-string ((car (cdr (assoc 'bg doom-themes--colors))))))) ;; (car (cdr (assoc 'bg doom-themes--colors))) )) ) 
 Though, when I try to do it automatically by using one of the commented lines above instead of the color string, I get a Wrong type argument: strings, ... error. I guess this is due to my very poor knowledge of Lisp and probably very easy to fix. Maybe one of you can help me out?
 Many thanks in advance!

 Hi, this is my first Emacs package! It provides a transient wrapper for the qpdf command-line tool aimed especially at users of pdf-tools or at least DocView. With it one can, for example, remove/reorder/split/rotate pages of a pdf file, merge pdf files, remove annotations, and apply a range of transformations to a pdf file. See the qpdf documentation.
 I used this package to learn transient, so it may also be helpful for people looking to do the same. Comments and suggestions are most welcome. For example, I wonder if I should and how I could define custom suffix classes for better handling qpdf arguments like --collate[=n] which are a switch but also optionally take a value, or complex ones like --overlay file [options] --?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I have a file notes.org which holds all my notes that I'm willing to keep for long term. Beside that, I would like to store temporary notes that I probably remove at some point. I would like to put the temporary notes in a separate file. I was thinking in creating a temp.org or misc.org file, even though I'm not sure if the names are okay. Do you use any naming for a notebook that works more like a temporary notebook for you?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all! I’ve spent last two years working on a lightweight library for configuring a http client and http server to communicate over tls/ssl. I have tested it with over 40+ http clients for java, scala and kotlin. The core library contains only one transitive dependency, slf4j-api, and the remaining part only uses the available classes within the jdk.
 In the past I was required to configure a http client with different configurations depending on the project requirements, such as:
  
One way authentication
 Two way authentication
 Using multiple truststores and keystores
 Using pem files
 Reloading ssl
  
To make it easy to reuse for myself and everyone I thought it would be good to make a library out of it and also contribute back to the community. I wanted to hide all the verbosity away and just provide easy to use builder methods without needing to know how to create SSLContext, KeyManager, TrustManager etc. I initially posted it on the java channel, but I thought it could also be intresting for scala developers. Hope you guys like it. Feel free to send my some critiques!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm curious how is the current situation with sustainability of packages installed by cabal-install or stack. I mean, how do you get rid of older packages, artifacts of dependencies after some failed build, packages for a no more existing project etc?
 Did anything changed in that area since Cabal-install 1.x? Back then I've used sandboxes local to a project which could be at least manually swept out, a crude but safe way. Can't find that feature in 3.x versions. Now everything goes to cabal/store which bloats ad infinitum and can't find any suggestion in user docs how to alleviate this problem. Any idea?
