        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all!
 ​
 Edit: I tried solving this by adding an autoload to `smudge-connect-player-status` which seems to have possibly fixed THIS issue, but there is another problem with Oauth that makes the whole thing hang and I'm not sure.
 I'm using Pop! OS, with Emacs installed from terminal, emacs 27.1.
 I posted a few months ago about getting Vuiet set up. I liked it a lot, but it was very minimalistic. Really only good for mindlessly playing a handful of tracks, and at that, you kinda had to know who you were looking for. It also had a few weaknesses, like constantly throwing up my debugger every time a particular song's lyrics couldn't be found.
 I finally gave in and switched to Spotify from YT Music since my partner uses it, and also I discovered Smudge, which looks awesome!
 ​
 Thing is, it doesn't actually work, because some functions are not defined yet. Something something spacemacs lazy loading. I'm not sure how to fix this but I know Spacemacs has some behavior which causes packages to not be completely loaded if they're not invoked - I think somehow this is what's causing the issue.
 So, I try to run: `global-smudge-remote-mode`
 This is the output:
 `smudge-connect-player-status` not defined.
 Any attempt to run another smudge function then causes emacs to hang indefinitely and it must be killed (That's dangerous!!!)
 I also noticed that when I first launch emacs, I only have access to functions which are defined in `smudge.el`, not ANY of the dozen or so other .el files included with this repository.
 Only smudge.el functions on startup.
 So I'm hoping this is a relatively simple configuration change I need to make in order to load this package properly and prevent the crashes. Thanks everyone!!!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 I think state machines of the type Input -> State -> (State, Output) are great. They are easy to reason about, and if run on a separate thread with access to a queue of Inputs they perform well too.
 Sometimes the state machine might need to do some blocking I/O before producing the output though, this slows down the processing of inputs.
 I've recently implemented and documented an experimental way of how we can write the state machine as if the I/O is blocking, but actually it's non-blocking and inputs can continue to be processes while we wait for the I/O action to complete:

 Any feedback, comments or suggestions are most welcome!

In my Emacs frame. It is split into 3. On the left I have 2 panes with code and on the right I have the repl.
 This setup is fixed. As in, it doesnt really change much. 
 I use the terminal heavily for a bunch of coding and non-coding things while I am coding. Having the terminal on a separate window is very quick for me to switch and do something.
 I am curious what other peoples terminal workflow is. How do you integrate the terminal into your workflow? If you use term or v-term, how do you make switching easy and seemless?

 But when entering the project, I always see the error message:
 Directory-local variables error: (wrong-type-argument listp projectile-project-run-cmd) 
 ​
 What am I doing wrong?
 Thank you in advance!

 I have not used orgmode for some time, but one of my new year's resolutions is to orgmodify my life.
 As I have recently started to get into android/wearos programming, I need to collect a lot kotlin code-snippets, each possibly with extra-information on what to put into gradle-files and what sdk-version to use etc etc.
 Any tips on how to best organize that?
 Many thanks!

 Do you guys run Emacs on Android? And I don't mean just in terminal. I want a full-blown GUI that supports all the things Emacs 29 has - sqlite, etc. Is that possible or I just want too much?

 "Why did the Emacs user switch to Vim? Because they wanted to be able to exit the editor."
 "Why was the Emacs user upset when they lost their cursor? Because they couldn't find their point."
 "Why was the Emacs user excited about the new release of their editor? Because it had a cut and paste feature."
 "Why was the Emacs user upset when their editor crashed? Because they lost all their parenthesis."
 I hope these jokes bring a smile to your friend's face! Just be sure to keep in mind that everyone has different senses of humor, so it's important to be mindful of your friend's feelings and to not overstep any boundaries.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This has annoyed me for quite some time now and I've never found any solutions for it online. I'm using lsp-mode for C/C++, and I have some dependencies specified in a CMakeLists.txt.
 The problem: Emacs keeps complaining (I think it's the language-server who is complaining about this?) about c-headers for the dependencies specified in CMakeLists.txt not being found.
 The solution I've been using so far is to manually put the include paths to these dependencies in a compile_flags.txt file. For example:
 ``` -std=gnu99 -I/usr/local/include -I/usr/include -I./include
 Deps produced by cmake
 -I./build/_deps/webp-src/src -I./build/_deps/vec3_static-src/include -I./build/_deps/cglm-src/include ```
 However, it's kind of annoying to keep fiddling with these files all the time. Is there anyway to configure lsp-mode or whoever is complaining about missing C-headers to actually look inside the _deps folder created by cmake, without using a compile_flags.txt?
 Like a global system-wide compile_flags.txt ?
 Thanks!

 I don't care if there is a running process there - in fact I probably want it to run to update my email. I assume that's what it is doing.
 /shrug. 
 I mostly ignore it, but from time to time it grabs focus when I'm typing in another buffer and I need to re-focus the other buffer which is very annoying. The only way to make it go away is to quit and re-start emacs entirely, and to not run mu4e anymore.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone,
 I'm new to emacs and I've just started using org-agenda and I have a question for you.
 Let's suppose I've courses every Tuesday and Fridays from 10:00 to 12:00, starting on January 30, 2023, and up to march 18, 2023. I'm trying to enter this so that it shows in my org-agenda. I've done this in the following way:
 * TODO Biology class <2023-01-31 Tue 10:00-12:00 +1w> :PROPERTIES: :LAST_REPEAT: [2023-03-18 Sat 0:00] :END: * TODO Biology class <2023-02-03 Tue 10:00-12:00 +1w> :PROPERTIES: :LAST_REPEAT: [2023-03-18 Sat 0:00] :END: 
 When I activate the agenda view and go to yearly view (via the command org-agenda-year-view) I see the entries every Tuesday and Friday at the right time, but I also see them appear well beyond the LAST_REPEAT date that I fixed inside the PROPERTIES section.
 So my question is: am I understanding wrong the usage of LAST_REPEAT? Is this the expected behavior? What should I do to make those entries not show beyond a given day (i.e., once my courses are over)?
 Besides my particular question, I'm open to any suggestions as to how I could be doing this in a better/more practical way. I'm reading the manual online and this is what I've came up with, but it might be far from optimal.
 Thanks in advance for all your help.

 Quick
 $ sudo ln -s /usr/lib/libtiff.so.6.0.0 /usr/lib/libtiff.so.5 
 (or recompile Emacs :)) fixes the problem; if anyone is experiencing the same issue.

 Others say 'Programming Scala' by Dwan Wampler os too difficult to begginers and uses Scala 3.0, which is not widely used yet.
 And some say 'Scala Cookbook' by Alvin Alexander is good but misses fundamentals as it contains only recipes and assumes you already know the basics.
 Anything I'm missing here? Any recommendations?

 I've been using AucTex for awhile.
 I really like it for the most part, but I'm betting indentation issues that are becoming a bit unbearable.
 I'm getting way too much indentation on most environments, which breaks my yasnippets and hurts readability.
 https://preview.redd.it/4g9lehqwk6aa1.png?width=1158&format=png&auto=webp&s=c9212e2a868ec488b41f9c9885e68284a9221d94
 And this is honestly something I could live with, but sometimes it just breaks altogether and decides to put 8 indents in the main scope and break everything.
 ​

 ​
 I'm wondering if there's a proper solution for this. I even tried turning off indentation all together, and that didn't work.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I use org-mode to create many of the documents I produce for both latex and html. However, I am having an issue that is the fault of the University's content management system, and I am hoping there is a quick option in org-mode (though reading through the docs and source, I don't see it).
 Basically, the CMS system first runs the HTML file through its own XML validator, which is rather stupid. There are two errors that prevent it from serving my ox-html output.
 First, the default ox-html mathjax declaration uses:
 <script id="MathJax-script" async src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mathjax@3/es5/tex-mml-chtml.js"> </script> 
 But, technically, the async should be a keyword/value pair, async="1" (value doesn't matter). I can fix that by customizing org-html-mathjax-template.
 Second, the default ox-html mathjax converter leaves the ampersand & character untouched. This is valid and fine, except when one has to go through a stupid XML validator, which says that & is the HTML start of a character code.
 Is there an option to enable ox-html to also convert & to &amp; in mathjax formatting? Obviously, ox-html does that already for text. I can do it after the publish with some elisp, but that seems like a PITA (one I am willing to do though).
 Any suggestions are welcome!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[More and more I've become enamored of the idea that Emacs could be an interesting front-end for systems/infrastructure management via tooling like magit's transient, hydras, consult-*, etc. The scenarios around Infrastructure-as-code, CM, CI/CD/orchestration tooling, and API interactions, well, it's just a reformulation of the original use case for Emacs ... manipulating streams of text programmatically
 I've been playing around with API interactions via elisp specifically and, though I'm not a Lisp expert by any stretch, I can already see where elisp might not be as robust of choice for integrating with external systems as another Lisp variant (ex: Scheme? Common Lisp?). Particularly as it relates to concurrent operations, error-handling, and automated testing. I'm guessing it will eventually be beneficial to reach into tools written in Rust and Golang and other languages via methods other than stdout/stderr/stdin but that's down the road a bit.
 So...the ask...any Lisp experts out there have insight as to which Lisp variant might be particularly good for:
 1) tight integration with Emacs and elisp
 2) integrating with other third-party APIs and particularly SaaS REST APIs
 3) ability to leverage non-Lisp ecosystem tooling with a level of effectiveness similar to, say, Python's glue extensions 
 Note: Yes, Python is quite effective at this sort of thing itself and I did consider exploring how I could graft Python to elisp for this task. For now, I think I would like to stick with Lisps. If my motivation were purely practical I would probably skip straight to the Python route.

Sane defaults, where I can easily change some editor options like theme, font, font size, etc.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Once upon a purely functional time,
 There was a language that shone so sublime.
 Its syntax, a study in elegance and grace,
 Was a delight to the most discerning codebase.
 This language was Haskell, a work of art,
 Whose powers of abstraction were second to none.
 It offered a refuge from the mundane and the coarse,
 A place where programmers could unleash their force.
 With Haskell, the horrors of side effects were laid to rest,
 As code was lifted up to a realm of the blest.
 No longer were we slaves to the whims of state,
 But masters of our domain, no longer irate.
 Yet Haskell was not for the faint of heart,
 For it demanded a level of discipline from the start.
 But for those who persevered, the rewards were great,
 As they soared through the skies, their code first rate.
 So if you seek a language that's pure and true,
 One that will elevate your code to something new,
 Then look no further, for Haskell is the one,
 A language that will surely have your code on the run.

But how do we implement forall a b. p a b -> q a b then, when we can only map p a a to q a a? Or does it require a more strong condition?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am currently hitting the very disappointing reality of Template Haskell. Given a Haskell function I want to generate a second one that is slightly different, for example:
 foo i [] = [] foo i (x:xs) = i : foo xs 
 should allow me to generate
 foo' i [] = 1 foo' i (x:xs) = 1 + foo' xs 
 that mirrors the recursive structure of the function. I CAN'T change the original function foo to use something like recursion schemes.
 My initial idea was to use TemplateHaskell, get the name of the function, lookup its definition and then change it accordingly. But as the documentation states
  
The Maybe Dec field contains Just the declaration which defined the variable - including the RHS of the declaration - or else Nothing, in the case where the RHS is unavailable to the compiler. At present, this value is always Nothing: returning the RHS has not yet been implemented because of lack of interest.
  
So my second guess was to use write a QuasiQuoter and surround the original function with it. I can use ghc-exactprint to parse the function, but that gives me a HsSyn AST, not a template haskell AST. I started writing a conversion function, but this very tedious.
 Is there a better way to achieve this? Is there such a function already?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Another piece of fallout from Advent of Code. One of the problems was a cellular-automata-like problem. I initially used a Set to represent the items in the grid, but it had a runtime of about 6 minutes. I swapped out the underlying representation to be an Array of Maybe Automaton, and dropped the runtime to about 7 seconds.
 The bad news is that the code is even more imperative in style than it was before.
 Writeup on my blog. I think it serves as an example of how you can do imperative, state-mutating code in Haskell, and as a fuller worked example than some of the tutorials online.
 Anyone have any thoughts?

. EPUB 3 added as an output format, selected with --epub3
  
Which means that you can now convert .texi into .epub. So you can now convert Emacs Manual, the ELisp reference and others to .epub, load them on your e-book reader of choice and go to the beach, the forest, or wherever.
 The process is quite easy, if you have Texinfo >= 7.0 installed (texi2any --version):
  
Download the Texinfo source of the manual you want to convert like the Emacs Manual
 Ask texi2any to convert it:
  
 TEXINPUTS=".:.:" MAKEINFO="makeinfo --force --enable-encoding -I ." texi2any --epub3 emacs.texi 
 Replace emacs.texi with the name of the root .texi file of the manual you are interested in.
 The results are quite good, I've been reading the Emacs Manual again this way.
 The FSF publishes manuals for most GNU projects along with manuals related to Emacs though Texinfo sources are not published for all of them, you'll need to grab the release then.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What is the simplest way to perform a HTTP call from Outwatch that would conform to the architecture of this framework? Please treat this question as ELIP (Explain Like I’m a Pythonista with very limited understanding of functional concepts).
 The outwatch documentation shows how I can display dynamic contents based on Observables. The examples, however, show only observables that change their state via user action or timer ticks.
 I think I need to somehow create an Observable that would represent the query, so that when the query succeeds/fails the content of the page gets updated accordingly. I was thinking about using http4s library as this is what I use on the backend, but the documentation for http4s describes only very simple case of client code, where the calls are represented by IO[String] values that are synchronously executed. I also tried to search in Outwatch and colibri documentation, to no avail.
 I will be glad for both examples and theoretical explanations.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am watching this great talk by Daniel Spiewak motivating effects. In particular, there is a point where he mentions that you can't do retries with Future, but you can with effects. Of course you literally can do retries with futures (e.g. here), but you risk repeating side-effects that aren't properly contained in a transaction. Why is this not the case for effects?
 Example: say I want to log a statement then read a value from a database. In the case of a future retry, suppose the first attempt logs successfully then fails to read. The retry logs the statement again then reads from the database (successfully), resulting in two logs instead of 1. Why would an effects implementation only log once, supposing the same scenario?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The documentation for Data.Compact claims that:
  
Pinned ByteArray# objects cannot be compacted. This is for a good reason: the memory is pinned so that it can be referenced by address (the address might be stored in a C data structure, for example), so we can't make a copy of it to store in the Compact.
  
ByteArray# is the memory form of Text and ShortByteString, meaning you can't create a Compact of any datatype that contains Text or ShortByteString - including FastString. 
 But it's not clear to me why that's the case. We have a ByteArray#. It's pinned, so we can pass that to a C program through the FFI. From my perspective, copying the ByteArray# to a new pinned location in the compact region seems like it should be fine?
 What if GHC did decide to copy the data? What sorts of warnings and errors could happen instead?

 Here, I've asked it to describe to me what a function does. (This is code that I wrote myself.)

 It does a pretty good job! It even guesses that I might be matching against ~ because I'm looking for backup files.
 So elisp isn't my main language; maybe I could be doing things better.

 I have been preparing training videos for my team, specially, devs that have never used Scala, in this one, I recorded myself while implementing a feature, from the beginning to get it merged.

 I have been using Corfu completion for quite some time now and one thing that annoys me so much is the beep on the first time the dropdown shows, no beeps after. I have already digged into corfu source code and it looks like the beep comes from somewhere else but somehow related to corfu. I have already test default completion-at-point and company and no beeps.
 Anyone have experienced similar issue and managed to silence it? ChatGPT suggested me to (setq corfu-beep-p nil) which is ridiculous. 
 Here's part of my config: ```lisp (customize-set-variable 'ring-bell-function 'ignore)
 (use-package corfu :straight (corfu :files (:defaults "extensions/*") :includes (corfu-history)) :custom (corfu-cycle t) (corfu-auto t) (corfu-auto-prefix 2) (corfu-auto-delay 0.0) (corfu-quit-at-boundary 'separator) (corfu-preview-current 'insert) (corfu-preselect-first nil) (corfu-on-exact-match nil) (corfu-min-width 80) (corfu-count 14) (corfu-scroll-margin 4) (corfu-popupinfo-delay t) :init (global-corfu-mode) (corfu-history-mode) (corfu-popupinfo-mode) (add-to-list 'savehist-additional-variables 'corfu-history)) ```
 I am using emacs-plus@28 on mac.
 EDIT: Simply (use-package corfu) also beeps on C-M-i.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have managed to build emacs-30.0.5 from source on a RHEL8 system. This took a lot of effort and compiling of other libraries to make it work.
 ​
 Emacs GUI comes up and many of my packages start and run. The issue is, the font I want is not being picked up. I want to use Fira Code as a font. The ttf files are installed in my ~/.local/share/fonts directory. I ran fc-cache for the system to detect them. fc-cache says there are 10 fonts in my ~/.local/share/fonts directory. The desktop font selection tool sees them and is able to use them for other GUI elements. 
 ​
 When I use Options->Set Default Font it pops up a small GUI that only knows a few fonts. It does not start the system font selection tool. My home PC does bring up the system font selection tool.
 ​
 In my custom-vars.el, which is loaded by init.el I have the following:
 (custom-set-faces
 ;; custom-set-faces was added by Custom.
 ;; If you edit it by hand, you could mess it up, so be careful.
 ;; Your init file should contain only one such instance.
 ;; If there is more than one, they won't work right.
 '(default ((t (:family "Fira Code" :foundry "CTDB" :slant normal :weight medium :height 113 :width normal)))))
 ​
 This works on my PC at home, but not my RHEL8 computer. There are no messages in the *Messages* buffer and there is no *Warnings* buffer. The GUI comes up and runs with some horrible default font that is hard to read. 
 ​
 Any ideas on what I am missing or doing wrong? Is it something I missed in compiling emacs? Something I am not setting up in my environment?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Has anyone told you that they'd like to learn more about this Emacs thing you're always talking about? Does that fill your heart with joy and just a little bit of cringe when you know they're going to be looking at stock Emacs with a blinding white background and non-standard discoverability? Do you jump in and say, "here take this config file to help make things easier" or the like?
 This little project was born out of that frustration.
 Presenting, Emacs Bedrock
 Yes, I am an Emacs evangelist, and all around me know it. (Sorry guys.) I vacillate between giving people too much help or too little, I think. The ideal is to encourage new folks just enough to get over the initial hump and get them figuring out what they need to customize to get Emacs to work for their specific needs.
 This is just a little side project for me. I've had the ideas for this bubbling ever since Emacs 29 packed in so many nice features I wondered just how many of my 3rd-party packages I really needed. (Answer: I still have over 100 installed!)
 This package doesn't focus on setting a nice theme (though it does use modus-vivendi) or doing fancy package customization stuff. This aims to be brutally simple so that new users can inspect it and try it out.
 I'd love to get some feedback. Feel free to leave comments here or on the SourceHut issue tracker.
 (There is also a GitHub mirror if SourceHut doesn't work for you for some reason.)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Happy New Year!
 SimpleX Chat is developed in Haskell - without huge support from Haskell community and help from u/angerman it would not be possible.
 We will be hiring soon – let me know if you are interested!
 Some Haskell-specific challenges we need to solve:
  
reliability/security of Cryptonite
 memory leaks in networking stack
 compilation for the web
 and many more!
  
Version 4.4 added:
  
disappearing messages – the most frequent request from the users. To use them both conversation parties should agree to it, unlike in most other messengers that allow to send disappearing messages without recipients' agreement.
 connection security code verification – it allows to confirm that the connection keys/addresses were not substituted (man-in-the-middle attack).
 "live" messages – they update to all recipients as you type them, every several seconds.
 French language interface - thanks to users community and Weblate!
  
See more details in this post and download the apps via the links here.
 Please ask any questions about SimpleX Chat in the comments! Some common questions:
 Why user IDs are bad for privacy?
 How SimpleX delivers messages without user profile IDs?
 How SimpleX is different from Session, Matrix, Signal, etc.?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, I am using emacs 24.4.1 on a virtual machine on which I cannot install any additional packages so my configuration is very simple. I often have to work with very large files, a few hundred Megabytes and I find isearch to be really really slow to the point it is unusable. The files are opened with Fundamental mode, I tried disabling the Hi minor mode, I also tried to set the lazy-highlight variable to nil from a post I found on the internet as suggestion to speed isearch up, but there is no noticeable change. When searching the same files with vim/gvim the search is super fast and I am able to quickly jump through the file and find all patterns matching the string. Why is there such a huge difference between emacs and vim search? Is there a way to speed up emacs when working with big files?

 R1: h k p = snd p > k
 R2: filter _ [] = []
 R3: filter p (x:xs) = if p x then x:ys else ys
 where
 ys = Main.filter p xs
 ​
 R4: zip [] _ = []
 R5: zip _ [] = []
 R6: zip (x:xs) (y:ys) = (x,y) : Main.zip xs ys
 R7: zip _ _ = error "ouch!!"
 ​
 When I call it with " Main.filter (h '3') (Main.zip (error "ERR":"1") ['a'..]) " i have an error. 
 I get the error that I pass to the map function. Execution returns the "ERR" error because it compiles: R2 -> R3 which brings me to R4 because there is "if p x". And I am interested in what is inside the map, so I go to R4 (fail matching pattern), R5 (fail matching pattern), R6 and inside R6 I find the error as x. 
 Is the execution correct?
 Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to write my own helm source that is alist. I'm looking at the documentation here https://wikemacs.org/wiki/How_to_write_helm_extensions#Separate_candidates.27_sets_for_searching_and_for_actions
 but it does not work for me. The differences in my case are:
  
I'm using function instead of static set. The function returns alist as in the example, but I receive/can get only the car of the selected item, don't see the alist
 I'm using helm-comp-read, if this makes any difference
  
The docstring says
  
- COLLECTION can be a list, alist, vector, obarray or hash-table. 
 For alists and hash-tables their car are use as real value of 
 candidate unless ALISTP is non-nil. 
 It can be also a function that receives three arguments: 
 the values string, predicate and t. See `all-completions' for more details.
  
looking at `all-completions` docstring does not make it clearer to me.
 edit:
 `helm-comp-read-get-candidates` has hint:
  
ALISTP when non--nil will not use `all-completions' to collect 
 candidates because it doesn't handle alists correctly for helm. 
 i.e In `all-completions' the car of each pair is used as value. 
 In helm we want to use the cdr instead like (display . real), 
 so we return the alist as it is with no transformation by 
 `all-completions'.

 The highlight for this one is probably moving the little router from the "templates" package into core (and adding some documentation) so that there is a little router included in the vanilla version. The syntax for the d3-like component has also been improved, along with a few other tweaks
 Release notes here https://github.com/wbillingsley/veautiful/releases/tag/v0.3-M5
 0.3-M6 is likely to be out soon (at least before the 18th). That one might also get called "0.3.0".

 Now I need to include a color box in a mini page for which the latex code looks like this:
 \\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=white,colframe=dkgreen,sharp corners=uphill] 
 But within org-mode, instead of creating a color box, the attributes are displayed as such. [colback=white,colframe=dkgreen,sharp corners=uphill]. I don't how to include attributes.
 Any help in this regard is appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sometimes it is annoying to wait for emacs to send a larger email (potentially over a slower connection). Using async it is possible to send email asynchronously, but you may loose your email if something goes wrong. Emacs now has built-in support for sqlite which can be used as a safe and simple mechanism (sqlite supports accessing a DB using multiple processes) for inter-process communication between the main emacs process and the emacs process that async spawns and to persistently store emails to be send and errors that occur during sending. This also enables retrying to send an email that failed to be send. Furthermore, for queued emails we can flush them in parallel. 
 I've now put this into a package on github that tries to load mu4e, but does not fail if the user is not using mu4e, but gnus. This should work on Emacs 29 (sqlite support) for any email client that uses the gnus and smtpmail functions to send email. However, since this queues emails in sqlite anything that displays queue sizes would have to be adviced to use async-email-sending--num-queued-emails instead.

 Hi all, when I added a hook to enable paredit mode for eval-expression mini buffer, hitting <RET> created a newline instead of evaluating the expression. Not sure how to fix this? Any ideas?
 Currently, if I remove this hook, then it works fine. But it's really nice to enable paredit mode when doing some quick evaluation using M + :

 (setq-default py-split-window-on-execute nil)
 in my dotemacs. I'm keeping the post for anyone else who finds this.
 Using 't' instead of 'nil' would create a new window, but only if the relevant window wasn't already up.
 __________________________________________
 ORIGINAL:
 I tend to code by having a python shell in one window, and the code in the other window, typically with a vertical divider between them. If I choose a region in the code window, and run py-execute-region ("C-c |"), it's insanely annoying that a new window gets created each time, below the two existing windows, with the same code buffer in it.
 How do I save my sanity? Expected operation would be that the region gets executed in the python buffer, without creating any new windows.
 I'm not sure if I'm using python-mode.el or python.el. Is there any easy way to tell? Is there an easy way to choose one or the other at runtime? I don't see any python-mode.el in my dotemacs, I'm not sure where any non-default version would be loaded.
 I'm running Emacs 25.2.2.
 I found this but wasn't able to solve the problem, sharing it as a starting point for anyone else: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24119221/customize-window-splitting-in-emacs-python-mode

 The issue I am grappling with is that the api sometimes returns an token for the next page. I need to loop through each of the individual calls until this token is no longer present. In imperitive programming this is a simple `while` loop. I am struggling to find a functional form that works.
 This is the current signature of the get_tweets function
  get_tweets :: NW.Options -> IO TwitterResponse 
 where TwitterResponse is

 The String in Partial is the pagination token.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Greetings fellow Haskellers,
 I've decided 2023 is the year I'm going to learn and become productive in Haskell. I installed everything I think I need through GHCup. I can make my own projects with `stack new` and everything works _okay_. HLS seems to need restarts from time to time, though. But in any case, I am working through Haskell in Depth and I can't really work with the example repo at all. When I open the directory in VSCode, I get this fairly inscrutable error at the top of any file I open:
 <command line>: cannot satisfy -package z-hid-examples-z-contexts (use -v for more information) 
 Any call to \`stack build\` fails with a bunch of constraint violations. The output appears to be complaining about which GHC I am using. In short, I am wondering whether there is any up-to-date, authoritative guide I can follow to fix my configuration so I can work through this stuff. Examples on the web seem to be mostly a bit old and piecemeal.

While I was never able to get it working well for me I kept checking in on it because I so wanted faster latex previews in org. This morning I found that Karthink had a new repo org-preview which is amazing. It is super fast, worked for me out of the box, and centers display math! Plus it works with org-fragtog which I also love. 
 Repo says its still in very early development (seems to only be a week or so old) but figured I would share my enthusiasm about it. 
 (Thank you u/karthink!)

 The following code works, but I'm wondering if there is a way to filter out the composite numbers without unfreezing the vector. My attempt to do so using forM and guard didn't compile.
 Signature of primesUpTo is determined by the exercise and can't be modified.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently discovered that the xdg-basedir library on Hackage only covered a very limited part of the XDG Basedir Specification, namely just reading the environment variables and returning paths for directories and files, and only for the categories or config, data and cache.
 But the XDG Basedir is so much more!
 First, there are other categories, state and runtime. Second, there's a whole logic to what files should be read: either you want to read only one file, and the application should try each directory for the category and give you the content of the first file that is available, or you want all available files merged together. Also, relative paths in the environment variables should be ignored.
 So I created xdg-basedir-compliant. It was fun to create because thanks to Polysemy, I could easily do TDD with non-IO interpreters.
 I hope the API is practical. I do hope people will use the library and I would very much welcome feedback on its use!

 This project I believe will grow into something bigger. I want to make it for different types of poker games and add in game theory elements to it. So this is more of a starting point. Right now it only supports Texas hold'em. I won't go too much into the rules of poker, nor does it matter much, but say you have 2 cards and you want to calculate the odds of winning against any two cards.
 That means I need to calculate all combinations of 2 choose 50 = 1225

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey ... and happy New Year. Instead of going to an all night party this year I opted to release another update video about Game :: Dangerous, a game engine written in Haskell that I've been working on since August 2015. Since I last posted about it I've migrated the project to Haskell Stack and GHC 9.x, so the newer hybrid garbage collector is now utilised (and should bring noticeable performance improvements). In this video I explain a bit about the map development server I'm working on and give a brief demonstration.
 Following feedback from the community I've done a fair bit of refactoring. The code will probably still look pretty crazy in places but I've tried to tame the worst of the craziness somewhat. If anyone wants to give feedback I'd be interested in what you think of the recursive control structure in module HandleInput. Anyway, take it easy.

 Today, I had a strange experience. For a while I've believed that if you're just 1 developer, only cabal is enough. However I came across a concrete use case where it's not enough! Here's what happened:
  
I wanted to checkout an old commit of my personal project and run it.
 BOOM. Everything went out of whack because another personal project on my local machine was now at the wrong commit! These two different projects were no longer in sync!
  
My friends. Doesn't this prove the necessity of Nix, even for 1 developer? Just wanted to confirm with you before I go any further.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm new to emacs, I decided to go with doom emacs to get something sort of ready made. But I just don't understand why my copy paste commands are so messed up. And they don't work either. I used F10 to get a visual on what the commands where supposed to be, since C-w, M-w and C-y did nothing. I don't understand what S-delete means, shift-S-delete? Doesn't work. And I note M-w is the normal key binding but it does not work either.
 If I turn on CUA mode and use C-x / C-c / C-v then it works with key commands, otherwise nothing really works. Incredibly frustrating. I was trying to get used to the normal emacs commands but turns out they where not even there. Might there be some addon in doom emacs causing this?

I'm thinking about using (run-with-idle-timer 0 1 #'(lambda () (force-mode-line-update t))) to do this, is this correct? I'm also worried if this would cause performance issues. Or is there a better way to do this?
 Thanks, and happy new year!

 fg = C.fromGregorian year month firstDay = fg 1 lastDay = fg $ C.gregorianMonthLength year month allDays = map WD.toWeekDate [firstDay .. lastDay] 
 There is a function periodAllDays (this commit) that seems to do what I'm doing above, but when I use it, I get an error.
  
Not in scope: ‘C.periodAlldays’ 
 Module ‘Data.Time.Calendar’ does not export ‘periodAlldays’.

Life is experienced moment-to-moment, like an old fashioned tickertape.  This is how we receive information.  Reading, lectures, podcasts, speeches, these are sequences of words.  Music is sequences of sounds.  Movies are sequences of pictures.  All of these represent bits of information that come in one at a [[time]].
Similarly, reasoning seems to be a series of logical steps that take us from idea to idea to idea until we reach a conclusion.
In contrast, our [[brain]]s seem to operate as an interlinking network.  At the lowest level it's a web of interconnected synapses.  At a higher level our thoughts seem like a web of associations, similar to a [[mind map]].
Question: Since our experiences are sequential, but the organization of our thoughts is more of a network or web of associations, how to we integrate these concepts?

 I have installed tree-sitter cli from rust cargo, but when I try to call it from eshell, it said it cannot find the executable. It's fine in the iTerm2.
 I have installed package exec-path-from-shell to copy shell's environment PATH for Emacs to use.
 And I have checked the $PATH in the eshell which contains cargo binary directory and I can call tree-sitter cli using the absolute path.
 Any idea why eshell cannot find the executable? (I have also tried to add the directory to 'exec-path but it still cannot find it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey guys! I'm new to the forum and to all this Zettelkasten method. I've tried writing my first Zettel and I would apreciate if you could tell me what I can improve in it!  
I've written it in Portuguese and auto-translated it to English using Google Translator (imma be honest here, I'm too lazy to translate it manually lol).
As a first try I used a post from this Zettelkasten website as a reference to it and based on what I understood, I wrote this:
**UUID:** 30122022224925
**Creation Date:** 12/30/2022 - 10:49 PM
**Tags:** #reading #notetaking #writing

# The reading of a text must be accompanied by notes and writing

Understanding the content of a text and absorbing the knowledge present in it only happens during the active stage of reading, which is taking notes and writing about the ideas that the text presents. In a passive reading, where the text is just read, the information is retained for a much smaller amount and time, in addition to the fact that the main ideas are not worked through the reader's knowledge.

Annotations allow ideas to flow and solidify in the reader's mind, allowing them to retain longer and be able to question them to lead to new questions and answers. Writing allows the connections of ideas to be transmitted in words to paper or document so that others can read, understand and process these ideas so that new connections are established.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone! 
 Can someone please explain to me how I can "style" a (custom or built in) link properly? 
 What I want to achieve is basically some similar look, to what you can do with e.g. the :before element in CSS, where you e.g. display a little link icon in front the actual link.
 The icons can come from a font like e.g. Fontawesome and/or svg source.
 With the following code I managed to show an icon from all-the-icons, which I replaced with the letter M here for better readability. The problem with this is however, that it does not only change the word menu to an M inside the link only.
 (org-deflink menu "Style and export for menu links" [:face '(:box "gray60" :background "gray95" :foreground "purple")]) (setq prettify-symbols-alist '(("menu" . "M"))) (prettify-symbols-mode 1) 
 The plain text looks like:
 Plain Text
 and the "styled" version of that input looks like:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm getting to the point in working with my ZK that I have re-visited certain zettels several times - whether that is just to read the zettel or to "finish" it (if it was still in rough form, having the tag "#unfinished"), or to add information from new sources.  There could be numerous reasons.
My point, though, is that I don't always want to update (or "refactor") a zettel; sometimes I just want to (legitimately) expand it.  I've started adding dates to the new material and some zettels now appear as:
Date 1 (UUID) with original material.
Date 2 with new material.
Date 3 with even newer material.
This approach has an added advantage in that it allows me to see a progression in an idea - what did I write initially and what are my thoughts now?
Has anyone else implemented this practice?  If so, what is your experience with it?  Whether you have or not, do you see any potential benefits from doing this?  Any drawbacks?]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently purchased "Learn Physics with Functional Programming" mainly because it involved doing 2D and 3D graphics which are topics I would like to learn more about in Haskell. For the 2D part it uses the gloss package which I built and ran without any problems. However, for the 3D part it uses the package not-gloss which seems to not be maintained anymore. When I try to build it using cabal I get the following error:
 [ 5 of 10] Compiling Data.Pair ( src/Data/Pair.hs, dist/build/Data/Pair.o, dist/build/Data/Pair.dyn_o )
 src/Data/Pair.hs:98:10: error: • Non type-variable argument in the constraint: Monoid_f (Flip j o) (Use FlexibleContexts to permit this) • In the instance declaration for ‘Pair (Flip j o)’ | 98 | instance (Arrow j, Monoid_f (Flip j o)) => | cabal: Failed to build TypeCompose-0.9.14 (which is required by exe:LearnPhysics from LearnPhysics-0.1.0.0). See the build log above for details.
 I tried enable FlexibleContexts in my .cabal file but nothing changed. I am not sure where to go from here and any help would be greatly appreciated!

 I don't think eglot has the ability to show code lenses (unless I'm missing something obvious). So another package would have to take over, but I can't find one other than the ones integrated for lsp-mode.
 Has anyone been able to have some kind of code lens with eglot? I'm open to suggestions!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I tend to program with Rust/Ocaml/Python/PHP etc. But I just love the Haskell Language.
 The only thing that has been a deal killer for me so far has been laziness.
 Reading https://www.tweag.io/blog/2022-05-12-strict-vs-lazy/ further convinced me that laziness just causes too much grief.
 I am eager to write strict Haskell. I understand the the -XStrict and Unlifted datatypes help with this. Actually it is interesting that -XStrict does not really cut it, we need unlifted datatypes..
 However, I want to be able to use libraries and preludes that assume everything is strict and/or unlifted.
 Is it possible in 2022 to write Haskell as it if it was a strict language like, say, OCaml? However, where are the strict monad transformer libraries, strict by default preludes etc. Every notable library seems to be lazy...
 I like Purescript -- a dialect of Haskell that is pure and strict. However, Purescript does not have such a lively ecosystem, mature tooling etc. like Haskell.
 I would love to be writing Haskell with Purescript like semantics. Any suggestions?

 I seem to recall coming across a package that put coordinates into a property value and then could display the headings in a corkboard or desktop type view.
 It may have been a brainstorming package, or maybe a plotting package, but I can’t seem to find it, does anyone know of a package with a feature like this?

 For a common use case of multiple threads incrementing a counter it works surprisingly faster that TVar, MVar or ever plain IORef. Even more surprisingly, this counter is a faster single-threaded mutable integer cell than IORef. If you're curious, benchmarks are on github.

 I have created my own config from scratch after having used Doom briefly and Prelude extensively. This is working far better, and it's teaching me a lot.
 On a side note, I would really appreciate feedback into how this config can be improved, best practices, better choices, etc.
 See my config here: https://github.com/averageflow/dotfiles/tree/master/joeTumbleweedIKEADell/emacs
 I use a variety of packages, including consult, marginalia, vertico, corfu and orderless, use-package with straight.
 I love orderless, and when I manually enable it, works wonderful, but for some reason, it doesn't get properly activated in my setup (init.el) when following the documentation:
 (use-package orderless :custom (setq completion-styles '(orderless basic) completion-category-overrides '((file (styles basic partial-completion)))) ) 
 When I do (print completion-styles) it gives me just (basic). Somehow it gets overriden I think ?
 I've also tried to change that :custom by :config and to use the setq outside the use-package block, to no avail.
 So I have had to resort to
 (custom-set-variables '(completion-styles '(orderless basic)) ) 
 And this seems to work. But how can I / should I get rid of it this way? 
 Why doesn't it work in the use-package declaration? Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi r/scala, I would like to ask if any of you have encountered this problem before
 While programming in Scala, whenever I encounter certain types of situations that would have thrown an exception while programming in Java don't seem to be throwing any exceptions in Scala.
 A very simple example that doesn't throw an exception for me is:
 val list = (0 to 5).toList println(list(10)) 
 Surely this should generate an IndexOutOfBoundsException?
 Another example:
 val mappy = Map("a" -> 5) println(mappy("b")) 
 This also does not throw any exceptions.
 My Scala version is 3.2.1, and my intellij version is IntelliJ IDEA Edu 2022.2.2 using the Scala plugin, and my project type is an SBT project generated by intellij, incase any of that is relevant.
 I have also tried messing with the intellij settings, turning on stuff like "prohibited exception thrown" since I saw online that something like that might help, but I haven't seen any changes yet. I'm thinking about trying to throw out my entire scala plugin & installs and try again from scratch, but I figured I'd ask here first.
 ​
 Thank you very much

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 Recently I posted how could I figure out the face variable for LSP breadcrumbs. I solved it.
 I hope the following is helpful.
 TL;DR
  
Even non-elisp hackers can understand elisp. Don't be intimidated.
 Thank you /u/CorysInTheHouse69 for the nudge.
  
Details
 /u/CorysInTheHouse69, politely, repeatedly mentioned I should consult the underlying code. They were right, that's the right approach. Even for a non-elisp hacker, one can see patterns!
 I found the pattern in the doom theme (doom-themes-base.el) base code and saw the line (header-line :inherit 'mode-line) That is, the header line is matching my mode line. That's not what I wanted! Boom!
 Walking up the code, I see the following comment:
 ;;; Code: ;; These are used as a basis for every Doom theme defined with `def-doom-theme', ;; as a set of reasonble defaults. They are intended to be overidden where it ;; makes sense to. 
 operative word overridden!
 In my init.el I override (header-line and now, I have what I want. \o/
 Here's an example of my unit test:
 (custom-set-faces ;; custom-set-faces was added by Custom. ;; If you edit it by hand, you could mess it up, so be careful. ;; Your init file should contain only one such instance. ;; If there is more than one, they won't work right. ... '(header-line ((t (:background "blue" :foreground "black")))) ...) 
 Go forth and hack!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[https://github.com/anticomputer/age.el
 Since I'm starting to purge gpg out of my life, but do depend on it heavily for keeping my org notes and authinfo encrypted, I needed an epa/epg-style transparent encryption support for age (https://github.com/FiloSottile/age). As such I ported the relevant epa/epg code and reworked it to work with age. 
 age.el provides transparent encryption and decryption support for .age files in Emacs, much like epa/epg support .gpg files. That means you can do all the things with .age files you're used to doing with .gpg files in Emacs now.
 Like most of my packages, this is mostly written to support my personal use cases, but I've seen some other folks mention that they wanted to start using age over gpg, so have a look if this seems useful to you.

 Few bug fixes and workarounds against the 3.2.1 compiler behavior.
  
Also, support for probability monad (https://github.com/jliszka/probability-monad ) is added to cps-async-connect.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[According to some post I read the behaviour of defvar has been changed in that it will set the value of an already set variable if the variable is used again in a defvar.
 I use defvar declarations in order not to get assignment to free variable errors and I wouldn't want the existing values to be reset.
 I can't find the exact post where I read this but if this is what I think it means it may cause me some problems.
 Can anyone clarify it?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I decided to upgrade to ghc 9.2.5 now that hls 1.9.0.0 is out, however I'm having an extremely difficult time figuring out what exactly I need to change in my current project to make it work. 
 The project builds correctly when I have 8.10.7 set as default with ghcup as well as when I swap back to it after trying to get 9.2.5 to work. When I set the default to 9.2.5 and start VSCode with the project folder, hls errors and says that it can't determine what compiler version should be used, which is fair I guess, but again I have no idea what I need to change because there isn't any information in the .cabal file about what compiler version to use.
 When I try to build the project, I get this error
 cabal-3.6.2.0.exe: ghc-pkg dump failed: dieVerbatim: user error (cabal-3.6.2.0.exe: 'C:\ghcup\bin\ghc-pkg.exe' exited with an error: ghc-pkg-9.2.5.exe: C:\\cabal\\store\\ghc-9.2.5\\package.db\package.cache: withBinaryFile: inappropriate type (not enough bytes) 
 and almost all of the solutions/advice I've been able to find online for dealing with that have to do with stack which I'm not using. The one that wasn't about stack said to delete the project folder and clone it again from github but doing that didn't work.
 Any help would be deeply appreciated. If the solution is to just uninstall everything including ghcup and reinstall with only 9.2.5, is there something I should change about the .cabal file in the project before I do that to make sure it works correctly after reinstalling?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I know that the *> operator is pronounced as "then". For example, Just 10 *> Just 20 would be read as "just 10 then just 20". However, I couldn't find a definitive source on how to pronounce the <* operator. Personally, I've been pronouncing it as "after". For example, Just 10 <* Just 20 would be read as "just 10 after just 20". But, I'm not satisfied with the semantics of this pronunciation. It doesn't match the meaning of the <* operator. How do you pronounce the <* operator?
 Edit: The reason I want to know this is because I want to implement these operators in an object-oriented language. So, Just 10 *> Just 20 would become Just(10).then(Just(20)). Similarly, I want a name for Just 10 <* Just 20. Hence, not pronouncing them or using the same name to pronounce them is not an option.

 I have a long persisting issue I'd rather get rid of if anyone can point me in the right direction. When I first start Emacs (whether directly or as a client) my screen is extremely compressed (screenshot below). If I reload configuration it displays normally.
 I am currently on 28.2 but this has persisted from 27.x. You can probably just make out in the screenshot that this is Doom emacs just in case that has any relevance.
 Here is the screenshot:

 Searches do not yield any help that I've found and I'm honestly not sure where to look.
 Thanks in advance.

 Is there an emacs distribution, which upon startup would present itself as a full-featured organizer?
 What I'm looking for is something opinionated, not necessarily easily configurable even, but something that works and does the job¹ out of the box.
 ¹ the job I define as something done by conventional organizers (todoist, ticktick), namely:
 - manage todo tasks
 - attach text notes to tasks
 - set date on tasks
 - set tags on tasks
 - agenda view
 - calendar view
 - maybe something like org-gcal?
 - preferably evil mode
 I'm willing to invest only minimal effort into learning this opinionated way of using org-mode. I'm not interested in the endless feature-set emacs can offer. I may decide to tinker with the setup later. But I don't want to do all the learning upfront.
 Does a distribution like this exist?

It's unclear to me how to productively capture this framework & begin developing out within my Zettelkasten.  I've kept my ZK for ~6 months now, so I'm familiar with the framework (both from notes workflow & ideas workflow perspectives).
Currently, I'm considering this method:
Create a note that contains the flowchart itself.
Branch off of this note by creating a new note for each Phase & each document.
Dive into the methodologies & techniques required at each Phase from there.
Am I on the right track?  Is there anything obvious that I'm missing here?]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So for my previous year, I used LibreOffice Writer which sufficed well enough for using symbols as well as sub and super script but since then I’ve discovered my dearest Doom Emacs and kinda fell in love with Org Mode; y’know how the story goes. My current problem mostly is I’d really love to use Org Mode for my Math Notes but I don’t know how to insert symbols or structure things like larger division statements, or anything with how to insert functions.
 I’ve heard things about LaTeX being the optimal way to get this done; seemingly Emacs should have some integration with this but I don’t entirely know where to start with that and I don’t actually know a thing about LaTeX so I was wondering if anyone could offer me guidance on how to achieve the optimal note-taking Emacs setup, and just how you lovely lads would go about this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a little puzzle for the Haskell community.
 Lately I've been experimenting with tagless final encodings (or object algebras in other languages) to build ASTs where previously I would have used a recursive ADT.
 This works great if you have a simple untyped AST. New terms can be added to the AST by adding a new typeclass that extends the base one. 
 However, what you have an AST presented with a GADT, with the types of your language encoded as a data-kinded parameter? You can still encode your AST in a tagless final way by using a higher-kinded type as the carrier, and this (as before) let's us extend the terms of the language, but what if we want to extend the types?
 For instance, if we have a base AST for a simply typed lambda calculus, and we want to add products, we need both a new type constructor, and some new terms of our AST itself.
 Yet (as far as I know), it's not possible to use something like a tagless final encoding at the type level.
 Has anyone thought about solving this kind of problem? My only thought was that this might be easier to do in something like Agda or Idris, but I'm curious what a solution to this in Haskell might look like.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I tried to write a function that calculate log safely (exercise in Haskell Wikibook). Here's what I came up with:
 safeLog :: (Floating a, Ord a) => a -> Maybe a safeLog x = log x <$ guard (x > 0) 
 Then I tried to rewrite it in point-free style. After some tinkering, I came up with this version:
 safeLog :: (Floating a, Ord a) => a -> Maybe a safeLog = ap ((<$) . log) (guard . (> 0)) 
 The function works correctly; however, I don't understand how it works (specifically the concrete type of ap). Haskell language server showed that the concrete type of ap is:
 _ :: (a -> Maybe () -> Maybe a) -> (a -> Maybe ()) -> a -> Maybe a 
 The generalized type of ap is:
 forall (m :: * -> *) a b. Monad m => m (a -> b) -> m a -> m b 
 As I understand it, ap requires a function, a type a and b all wrapped in Monad m. For example, if I have this function:
 foo = ap (Just (+ 1)) (Just 2) 
 I understand that the concrete type of Monad m here is Maybe, and the concrete type of a and b is Integer. i.e.:
 _ :: Maybe (Integer -> Integer) -> Maybe Integer -> Maybe Integer 
 But in the case of ap inside safeLog:
 _ :: (a -> Maybe () -> Maybe a) -> (a -> Maybe ()) -> a -> Maybe a 
 I cannot figure out what is the concrete type of Monad m, a and b.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm reading about arrays (Data.Array). 1D array construction is easy.  a = listArray (4, 8) [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]  creates an array with minimum index 4, maximum index 8, a ! 4 = 2, and so on.
 But I came across the following code for constructing a 2D array, and having a hard time understanding it.  xss = [ [9, 8, 7] , [5, 3, 2] , [6, 6, 7] ] matrix = listArray ((1, 1), (3, 3)) (concat xss) 
 What is the (1, 1) for? I can see how nine integers can be split into 3 rows and 3 columns without needing the (1, 1).
 The only material even discussing 2D array type is this, and sadly it doesn't answer my question.

 I have a use case where I'd like to link an image inside an org document for viewing inline, but would also like it to be suppressed upon export to PDF. 
 I'm aware of two solutions that are unsatisfactory: linking the image in a #+begin_comment #+end_comment block, or adding the image under a subheading with the :noexport: tag.
 The first is not enough since placing an image link inside a comment block prevents org recognizing it to be viewed inline, while the second is unsatisfactory because it would mess with the formatting of the document. I.e. I would have to escape the noexport subheading for every image (I confess I don't know how to do this if there is a method). Is there any way to get the desired behavior?

 This is my MWE:
 #+title: Testing org-cite \LaTeX export #+latex_header: \usepackage{natbib} #+bibliography: r4h2o.bib #+options: toc:nil #+cite_export: natbib Hello World! This is a citation: [cite:@alghamdi_2022_clas] #+print_bibliography: +end_export 
 I get an error message: "Unknown processor natbib"
 Exporting with the basic exporter works fine. CSL is also problematic.
 The Org Mode manual is a bit cryptic on this functionality.
 Anyone can help fixing this issue?
 P.S: I used a clean Emacs instance (emacs -q), no config.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Edit: Apologies for posting in this sub, as it is only partly Haskell-related. I'm not sure where else to discuss such things.
 One of my interests in programming is the analysis of techniques used to employ better coding practices. For example, in OOP you have design patterns that adhere to design principles such as SOLID. To further the example, you can design a factory with SOLID practices considered to create code that is "clean", allowing for code reusability, and flexibility. In short, with minimal code smell.
 I am currently reading Refactoring - Improving the Design of Existing Code by Martin Fowler to get a better understanding of things I've come to learn from practice and experience in a more well-presented context.
 I am wondering if some similar texts or resources focus on the functional style of code refactoring and reusability. I understand that many topics and techniques are simple enough to work in all contexts, but I also know that FP languages have their smells and without getting various kinds of experience (which may be difficult to do), I was hoping that I can learn of such topics.
 FP is naturally an abstract paradigm, going miles more than most OOP languages, and I want to be able to strongly analyse such topics in depth. I have moderate experience with Haskell, but due to university studies and life, I don't have the opportunity to focus more effort than I do, learning the various libraries and tools available to build a repertoire of skills from applied experience.
 Thank you very much

Configured direnv and my .bashrc as normal.
 Configured nix-direnv on NixOS by modifying configuration.nix as normal.
 Configured emacs' configuration for emacs-direnv as normal.
  
Now consider I have:
  
Make some directory /tmp/xyz, made a shell.nix or flake.nix file, and done either echo "use nix" >> .envrc && direnv allow or echo "use flake" >> .envrc && direnv allow as appropriate.
  
Then, every time I open a file, emacs-direnv direnvs in its direnv way, successfully, much to my happiness. I vterm and cd to my file and direnv also direnvs successfully.
 Let us now say I do M-x cd /tmp/xyz, wherein I have stored some .envrc and shell.nix (or flake.nix or whatever) files. Opening a file direnvs successfully. However, opening a vterm sometimes does nothing, whereupon I must first cd out of my directory and cd back into my directory.
 For some reason this happens inconsistently. Does anyone else have this problem? It seems only to occur with flake.nix files and not shell.nix files.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have been trying to diagnose this issue for quite a while, and I was hoping that someone more experienced may be able to provide some help.
 My current setup is Linux + neovim (using the built in LSP) + GHC 9.2.5 + cabal 3.6.2.0 + HLS 1.9.0.0 + stack 2.7.3.
 The issue that I'm having is that while I'm in my editor, HLS will not show me compiler warnings. Other than that HLS pretty works entirely fine, I'm getting hlint hints, I can rename variables, jump to definitions, and I get code completions etc. Just no compiler warnings.
 I have verified that the server is running, and that my editor is connecting properly. I have an explicit hie.yaml. I am having this issue on all of the Haskell code I open. I have used GHCup to reinstall and build HLS from source. At this point I am at a dead end, so any leads would be greatly appreciated.

 Is there a way to make certain abbreviations straightforward, without the use of extra keys? Here's an approximation: ``` (defun abbrev-or-insert () (interactive) (self-insert-command 1) (expand-abbrev))
 (define-abbrev-table 'global-abbrev-table '( ("HH" "---~" nil :case-fixed t :count 0) ("LL" "\ldots{}" nil :case-fixed t :count 0) ("ДД" "\ldots{}" nil :case-fixed t :count 0) ))
 (global-set-key (kbd "Д") 'abbrev-or-insert) (global-set-key (kbd "H") 'abbrev-or-insert) (global-set-key (kbd "L") 'abbrev-or-insert)  It works as desired; well, almost:  \ldots{}\ldots{}арпДД \ldots{}\ldots{} \ldots{}abaLL \ldots{}\ldots{}booLL ``` Somehow, any input after the expansion of the abbreviation is disruptive. It takes a space to make it work again. Is there a way to get rid of that space?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As far as I know there is no way to implement a mutual (or "duplicate") constructor for two different data types in Haskell.
 For example, this hypothetical code will not work:
 ```haskell data family Prim data family (a ~~> b)
 data instance Prim where Lit :: Int -> Prim
 data instance a ~~> b where Plus :: Prim ~~> Prim ~~> Prim
 -- A hypothetical data instance where either t is Prim, OR, t is (a > b) data instance (t ~ Prim | t ~ (a ~~> b)) => t where -- Apply is a mutual constructor for both Prim and (>), -- The result type depends on the type of the first constructor argument Apply :: (x ~~> t) -> x -> t ```
 The best alternative I can come up with is 
 ```haskell data Prim where Lit :: Int -> Prim CastToPrim :: Apply Prim -> Prim -- "UnApply" the type constructor, so to speak
 data a ~~> b where Plus :: Prim ~~> Prim ~~> Prim CastToArrow :: Apply (a ~~> b) -> (a ~~> b)
 data Apply t where Apply :: (x ~~> t) -> x -> Apply t ```
 Possibly with some pattern synonyms for convenience... (but this doesn't help much) 
 ```haskell pattern ApplyPartial f x = CastToArrow (Apply f x) pattern ApplyFinal f x = CastToPrim (Apply f x)
 two :: Prim two = ApplyFinal (ApplyPartial Plus (Lit 1)) (Lit 2) ```
 I was wondering if anyone has alternative ideas for this sort of thing (or knows of examples in other languages).

 Most major modes seem to have their own version of that variable however, which means that you would need to add the variable to each major mode you want to use the capf for. Ok, but not really ideal. 
 There's another thing at play here; out of the box, the value of completion-at-point-functions in emacs-lisp-mode is (elisp-completion-at-point t); the t here apparently indicates that if elisp-completion-at-point fails, it should fall back to the next function in the global completion-at-point-functions.

 Let me say up front: I do not have a job to offer, and am not even in a position to do so. But I would like to gauge potential interest in working professionally with Haskell in the company where I am employed. They currently develop mainly in .Net, C#, but a couple of years ago I was allowed to build a backend application in F# with a small team (kind of as a compromise for developing in a functional programming language but still using the .Net framework).
 For performance reasons, maintainability and ease of bug fixing, I recently suggested we look into migrating that application to Haskell. But with me being the only person currently who knows the language, my manager sees the low bus factor as a (very understandable) risk.
 We don't want to post a vacancy for Haskell developers at the moment, as a decision to use the language has not been made. But I would like to show by numbers how many developers we could potentially attract /if/ we were to do so. Or at least: how many people would be interested in working with Haskell in our reasonably direct surroundings.
 So my question is: are you, or do you know, a developer in the province of Limburg in The Netherlands, who would be interested in working with Haskell professionally? Or is there a better place to ask this question? If you don't want to disclose your location publicly in this subreddit, you can always DM me, of course.
 If nothing else, we might just find out how many we are, and could form a local user group out of this.
 Thanks for your time reading this!

 Upon starting doing so i noticed a pattern when wrapping a monadic function, it has the same type with some changes ,in the context instead of MonadIO it has GI :> es and the return type is Eff es a instead of m a , and in the term level it is also simple it uses all arguments from the original calls the original and then unsafeEff_s it like so function a b c = unsafeEff_ $ Original.function a b c. 
 Naturally i tried to automate it as this is quite simple in pseudocode, i first thought
 about using typefamilies and functions however although i probably could do a lifting function i can't create new top-level declarations with only typefamilies so i tried to use some template haskell.
 However traversing a template haskell syntax tree is absolute hell, i tried to combine it with typefamilies to generate the types more comfortably and it mostly worked until i needed to do the pattern for the clause, to apply the type families i would need a splice to turn my syntax tree in types, however i can't splice from the same module so i gave up on template haskell if there isn't an alternative i probably will come back eventually but i absolutely hated the experience.
 i hated the experience so much that i am considering forking haskell gi to create the functions already wrapped

I get that vimscript is really bad, but now nvim using lua would bring vim to the same level of customization as emacs. Am I correct in assume that?
 And just to narrow down the discussion, I'm looking just into the text editing part. The whole kitchen sink thing is not my vibe.

 - If I need to use brew install, I can't do it in emacs. It just says `brew not found`. So I have to switch into iterm and then brew install from there. I don't use brew much at all, but when I need it it's annoying that vterm or any of emacs' shell tools can't find it. 
 - Vterm doesn't have access to the kill ring. If I try to M-y anything from the kill ring vterm says `Buffer is read only`, which it certainly isn't. 
 - Using the universal modifier to include a string of digits doesn't work: C-u 12 C-u 0 should insert 12 "0"s, but it just inserts 1. 
 There are other gripes but these are the three top of mind. I'm not sure if there's something I'm missing about vterm, but I can't find any way to correct these issues which frustrates me since I'm now so used to everything working seamlessly everywhere else. If anyone has ideas for solutions to these problems, I'm all ears :)

I would like to be able to define some functions in my elisp file that would call certain methods from this package, say to create a private key. My question is really how to do this... is it even worth doing it this way, or just force the user to install a C implementation of the package and then get elisp to run that.

 You guys have probably gotten tons of people asking this same question but I'm gonna ask once more, since no matter what example I'm using it always loses me. 
 Running a simple expression as the one above gives me a parse error everytime. I've used different example expressions as this one, mostly ones from Philipp Hagenlocher's Haskell for Imperative Programmers tutorial. It's an excellent tutorial, but the examples from the tutorials always give me compile errors about common syntax like '=' sign & the '|' sign. Most commonly, I get this error: 
 Main.hs:6:28: error: parse error on input ‘=’ Perhaps you need a 'let' in a 'do' block? e.g. 'let x = 5' instead of 'x = 5' 
 I've tried different examples outside the tutorial, some stack overflow corrections of other people's code who've had similar errors to me. There was only one time where I did NOT get a parse error on compile time. Everything else has been a parse error on '=', '|' or something else. Why does the compiler punish me for using simple syntax like this? Is this a software issue I'm having or am I really doing something wrong? Cuz this is driving me nuts.

The issue of creating fiction into the system is that you deligate an ability to an external system that can and should be a skill of the person, you prevent the development of this skill. That decreases or perhaps even inhibits the training effect working with a ZK has or could have.
Folgezettel is a very valid and perhaps necessary technique that makes working as if you have a project you are working on. However, the most important counter-argument against the validity of Folgezettel is that you can achieve this with a better technique which is the structure note. Folgezettel allows to code for two different directions: lateral and horizontal. That means that you can't map meaning on Folgezettel or are limited to two (or four if you count the opposite directions) categories of meaning. Structure notes on the other hand allow for as much of connection as you are able to produce on the canvas you use. What would been a cluster of Folgezettel can be a single drawn image on a Structure Note. Even when using a analog Zettelkaten my recommendation is the heavy use of Structure Notes since they pull together thoughts and their relationships on one single canvas.
In theory, the "good enough relations" are awesome. But in practice, from what I see, the good enough is mostly an in the moment idiosyncratic idea that you will forget in the future. When the future is now, many people have quite some difficulties to understand the relation or to see a relation at all. That is intrinsic to the concept of "most what you produce is garbage". This includes the connections, direct and via Folgezettel. If you actually make it a point to get a grasp on the nature of connection you'll build more robust (even antifragile) edges in your network.]]></summary>

  data GTree a = GNil | GNode a [GTree a] deriving Show testGTree :: (Num a) => GTree a testGTree = GNode 4 [GNode 5 [GNode 3 [], GNode 51 []], GNode 6 [GNode 10 []], GNode 7 [GNode 12 [GNode 4124 []]]] postOrderG :: GTree a -> [a] postOrderG (GNode x []) = [x] postOrderG (GNode a (t:ts)) = postOrderG t ++ help ts ++ [a] where help [] = [] help ts = help (drop 1 ts) ++ postOrderG (head ts) 
 As you can see the function is supposed to traverse a tree with any number of children in postorder (which it hopefully does). Im struggling how i can get a O Notation. I thought id calculate with each node having a set number of children m (which is the max number of children in the tree) as a worst case. But how do I deal with the subfunction help calling on the main function (postOrderG (head ts))?
 postOrderG t runs with c' (c = runtime of postOrderG (GNode x []) = [x]) + runtime of help rest of list + runtime of postorder first child. But now we have postorder again ! 
 I dont want the answer but any tips would be welcome! And oc happy christmas to you all.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm working on this exercise matrix, which is creating a matrix from a string, and implementing various operations on it. A string 1 2\n3 4 should return a 2x2 matrix [[1,2], [3,4]]. My code is as below, and it passes all the test cases. I'm wondering though if it can be improved, especially the fromString and transpose functions.
 fromString first splits by newline and then by whitespace to create a [[String]]. It then goes over each element converting it to a (Int in the tests). This doesn't look like idiomatic Haskell to me. I looked at mapM, thinking it might help, but couldn't find a way to apply it.
 ``` module Matrix ( Matrix, cols, column, flatten, fromList, fromString, reshape, row, rows, shape, transpose, ) where
 import qualified Control.Arrow as A import qualified Data.Vector as V
 newtype Matrix a = Matrix (V.Vector (V.Vector a)) deriving (Eq, Show)
 cols :: Matrix a -> Int cols (Matrix m) | null m = 0 | otherwise = length $ V.head m
 column :: Int -> Matrix a -> V.Vector a column x (Matrix m) = V.map (\r -> (V.!) r (x - 1)) m
 flatten :: Matrix a -> V.Vector a flatten (Matrix m) = V.foldl (V.++) V.empty m
 fromList :: [[a]] -> Matrix a fromList = Matrix . V.fromList . map V.fromList
 fromString :: Read a => String -> Matrix a fromString xs = fromList $ map (map read) nums where r = lines xs nums = map words r
 reshape :: (Int, Int) -> Matrix a -> Matrix a reshape (_, c) = Matrix . chunks c . flatten
 chunks :: Int -> V.Vector a -> V.Vector (V.Vector a) chunks n xs | null xs = V.empty | otherwise = V.takeWhile (not . null) $ V.unfoldr (Just . V.splitAt n) xs
 row :: Int -> Matrix a -> V.Vector a row x (Matrix m) = (V.!) m (x - 1)
 rows :: Matrix a -> Int rows (Matrix m) = length m
 shape :: Matrix a -> (Int, Int) shape = rows A.&&& cols
 transpose :: Matrix a -> Matrix a transpose m = Matrix $ V.fromList $ map (column m) [1 .. cols m] ```

 It is well known that many Scala users are keen to get better tooling. Some weeks ago, I had the chance to try Vercel and started wondering about why Scala does not have something like this.
 After thinking for a bit, I got to the conclusion that Vercel's preview environments are not really hard to implement. Then, I put my hands into this and created an integration for one of our projects: https://github.com/wiringbits/scala-webapp-template/pull/299
 While the integration is still being tested, it has worked nicely for the past few days, we'll continue to test it in our private projects in the coming months.
 If you want to try breaking it? just submit a dummy PR and github will create a preview environment for your change.

 specifically im working with an infinite list generated by a function called zip_iterate, which basically takes a list of functions([a]->[a]) and a list [a] and applies the first function to the given input, then takes its result and uses it as input of the second function, and so on & so forth

I tried implementing the "Hangman" game in Haskell to get more familiar with the syntax and semantics.
 I would love some feedback on what I could've done differently/better since this whole thing is still new to me. Here is a link to the source code: https://gist.github.com/Pattrigue/ad8993ce4d4b7f5dcc895e05161989bf
 The "words.txt" file mentioned in the source code is just a word list I use to select a random word to use in the game, where the file contents are separated by newlines.
 Thank you! Hopefully it's not too terrible :)

# Poetry Is The Science Of The Real

Poetry is the "science of the real" (L249)

- Attention Is The Beginning Of Devotion [[202006230814]]
- A manner of living [[201912171125]]

Emerson advocated "rearranged the prose into a poem." (L635) Turning prose into poetry is a real creative endeavor. Like we did on the forum post [“How long is a string?”]{https://forum.zettelkasten.de/discussion/comment/11834/#Comment_11834} rewriting a sentence that caught our attention by @MartinBB. Write the prose first, letting the words and images flow. Only afterward, morphing it into something poetic.

- Haiku In English Prose [[202002211200]]

### Reading Books
Dip into them
extract bits and pieces
move on
circle back
extract more
reinterpret
It's all fairly messy.

> @MartinBB said:
> I dip into them, extract bits and pieces, move on (often because I have to), circle back to them, extract more, or reinterpret what I have already extracted. It is fairly messy.

- This would work in reverse also. We could write the poem first and then morph it into prose. As a list maker, this might be an advantageous way to work.

 I’ve been playing around with Yampa on Lego mindstorms. If you haven’t tried this, please do, it’s way way way too much fun (I can share some unfinished binding for the spike hub if you IM me)
 But I think it’s time to give this beast some eyes. I’m not very familiar with computer vision, so it’s going to be hard for me to make any kind of idiomatic arrow based abstraction, so I wondered if there was any high level combinators that worked with GHC 9+?

 1) The distribution of Emacs used will be the vanilla GNU Emacs. No Doom Emacs, no Spacemacs, etc. 
 2) The newest versions of GNU Emacs can be used (Emacs 27, Emacs 28, Emacs 29).
 3) Only built-in features of Emacs can be used. Packages that would only work on Emacs cannot be installed from anywhere, including Melpa, Non-GNU Elpa, and even GNU Elpa. 
 4) Software that is independent of Emacs can be installed. A pdf reader or a Ruby interpreter, for example, could be installed if necessary. 
 5) The configuration file can be changed in any way so long as the previous rules are followed.

 During my Christmas break, I thought I would learn more about the wonderful world of Emacs. I thought tweaking my personal window management might have been a good place to start, however this is not working as I wanted it to...
 So I have 2 windows open and the point is on the right. If I run my function, I expected it to:
  
open the next buffer in the left window
 open the documentation in the left window
  
But nothing happens. I've added debugging to show that the function is being called, and it seems fine.
 Any help would be appreciated!

 However, I still feel that my configuration is somewhat lacking for Python. I'm using python mode, the PYLS LSP server, and yas-snippet, yet I feel it's still missing a lot of good features that IDEs like VS Code provide.
 ​
 I've tried many other things, like Eglot, Pyright, and Elpy, but they all come with many problems of their own. What packages would you recommend so I can make Emacs into a truly great IDE for Python?

 Weird error example:
 I have a three column table and the third columns formula is (if (= $1 $2) $2) and it gives me an error saying it expects a value rather than the = sign. I did the same thing with elisp and is ran just fine there. The two columns being called contain single digit integers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Async programming in Emacs is... challenging. If the modern asyncio/await/async paradigm represents "cooperative" multi-tasking, Emacs' async seems more "semi-cooperative".
 I'm working with async process output in a comint mode, and I (re-)read the following docs often (emphasis added):
  
Output from a subprocess can arrive only while Emacs is waiting: when reading terminal input (see the function waiting-for-user-input-p), in sit-for and sleep-for (see Waiting for Elapsed Time or Input), in accept-process-output (see Accepting Output from Processes), and in functions which send data to processes (see Sending Input to Processes). This minimizes the problem of timing errors that usually plague parallel programming.
  
So it's pretty clear that sit-for and accept-process-output are good "yield points" (ala await). But what about in functions which send data? Does that mean:
  
Only functions which directly call process-send-*?
 Any function which calls such a function (and so on up the call stack)?
  
And where exactly in such functions which send data can process-output interrupts happen? Anywhere? Only specific places? If you've been down this road and found any enlightenment, I'd be grateful to hear about your travels.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'd be grateful for any help with a problem I've had for a while. When I close Emacs, I always make sure to save every open buffer before I do so -- it's an automatic reflex. Thus, the saved version of any given file will be the most current, and there should not be any need for autorecovery unless Emacs crashes without getting to save. Sometimes however, even after a normal close, my Emacs claims that a file has auto-save data, and prompts me to recover the file. If I recover the file and run a diff on it, I can see that the "recovered" file is actually an out-of-date version.
 Has anyone else encountered this, and could there something wrong with my config that's causing Emacs to try to "recover" out-of-date files? Below are the lines that I think could be relevant from my config:
 (setq version-control t) (setq vc-make-backup-files t) (setq auto-save-interval 20) (setq kept-old-versions 0) (setq delete-old-versions t) (setq backup-by-copying t) (setq kept-new-versions 10) 
 Right now I'm on Emacs 28.2 on Apple M1, but I think this has been a problem I experienced on a past Linux machine as well, so I suspect the fault is with my config.
 Thank you!!

 The 'all' function from that package works just fine so any condition I need I can reverse the logic and use that so the issue isn't preventing me from getting anything done, but this seems like a bug to me so I thought I would ask here if anyone could see a good reason for this behavior. The source code for these functions calls C code, so there may be some funny business going on with that.
 I'm on GHC version 9.2.4 and I'm not specifying the version of the fixed-vector package, so I assume it is the most recent.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a collection of items, e.g. a list of number, and an expensive operation. I want to pre-compute the operation for each of the items, so I can do cheap lookups repeatedly. For example:
 expensive :: Int -> Int expensive = (!! 1000000) . iterate (floor . sqrt . fromIntegral . (^2)) getAt :: [Int] -> Int -> Int getAt pre_computed index = pre_computed !! index main :: IO () main = do let xs = [5,2,4,6] pre_computed = map expensive xs for_ (cycle [0..length xs-1]) (print . getAt pre_computed) 
 That works as expected. Initially numbers are printed slowly but then fast later on.
 Now, I thought I can combine the pre-computing- and the lookup function into a single function like this:
 getAt :: [Int] -> Int -> Int getAt xs index = pre_computed !! index where pre_computed = map expensive xs main :: IO () main = do let xs = [5,2,4,6] for_ (cycle [0..length xs-1]) (print . getAt xs) 
 But this doesn't work. Printing the numbers is always slow. My intuition was, that after partially applying getAt, it pretty much looks like this
 getAt' :: Int -> Int getAt' index = pre_computed !! index where pre_computed = map expensive [5,2,4,6] 
 and then laziness makes sure that pre_computed is only computed once. After thinking about it more, I guess pre_computed is a local variable and not shared cross getAt calls. But shouldn't Haskell be able to see that pre_computed does not depend on any of the arguments and optimize that away somehow?

It's just a little slow on startup and gets progressively worse and is borderline unusable after about half an hour.
 All my packages are natively compiled. (From nix) I'm using lsp-mode with haskell-language-server. It's also bad with rust-analyzer, but not as bad. It affects all versions I've tried, including latest master and the lsp-mode experimental fork (which improved stuff but broke direnv, so...) I've tried the default gc limit, a high limit, a manual idle timeout and gcmh. It's much snappier in the terminal, but still not as good as I want it (and the whole gui thing was the reason I tried to switch away from neovim).
 So now I'm convinced that there's no way you all live with this and that I must've done something really stupid.

Neither :straight t, nor setq straight-use-package-by-default works and Emacs complains about a bunch of missing definitions when compiling init.el (I know this is somewhat expected, but it happens with extremely simple to load packages, like company). I'm using GNU Emacs 28.2-r4, if that matters.

 I decided to try doing a vanilla Emacs config again; I usually use Doom. I've tried this before with moderate success, but I felt like starting from scratch would be refreshing and allow me to craft things more carefully.
 I made a concerted effort not to add things I don't understand fully or that I will never actually use. I also decided not to use evil or try to ape all the Doom keybindings like I did with my previous attempt.
 Fast forward to today; the result is this.
 I'm actually quite satisfied with it; the code meets my goals of consisting of fully self-contained use-package statements, which in my inexpert opinion is a nice way of making the code as stable and idiot-proof (me) as possible.
 There's one problem…]]></summary>

 I then tried recompiling emacs-28, and I get this cryptic message when running ../configure:

 Google-fu gives exactly one hit when searching for test/manual/noverlay/Makefile.in and it's for someone having trouble compiling emacs on Apple M1; in my case I'm using boring intel x86 (thinkpad x480).
 I'm not really sure where to begin to look to debug exactly what's going on. For what it's worth, when trying to compile emacs-29, I can get past the configuration, but when I actually try compiling it, it's tells me I'm missing a ton of object files, namely, the following:  scroll.o category.o chartab.o com.o cmds.o casetab.o region-cache.o doprnt.o lcms.o systhread.o terminfo.o lastfile.o  Has anyone had any issues with emacs on Fedora 37?

 I have searched everywhere for an answer but I can't seem to find any.
 I appreciate any help

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[[Rookie Servant question]
 Hi all! I've got a REST API in Servant with a resource (/resA/:id) and many subresources (/resA/:id/resB/:id, /resA/:id/resC/:id, etc.) and a database that stores information on which users have access to which resources. I'm using basic authentication to authenticate users.
 I want to restrict access to the subresources of resA so that one only can access e.g. /resA/1/... if one has access to resA/1. Currently I do this by manually checking for access in every endpoint handler under resA, which doesn't feel like a good solution since this check must be added for every new endpoint I add under resA.
 This should be a common scenario for real world APIs, but I haven't found any documentation explaning how to deal with this. Any advice on how to propely restrict access as described above with Servant? Can this be done at the type level, or can I somehow check for access "outside" of the endpoints' handlers?
 Happy to be directed to any blog posts / documentation about this!

 HOWEVER my bliss lasts few minutes as very quickly I get “forbidden reeentrant call” error from tramp and eglot runs out of sync and gives me irrelevant errors. This is caused by some change tramp did for eMacs 28. There are tickets for this explaining in detail, but both lsp-mode and eglot haven’t resolved it (and it may be company-mode bug). I’m not expert on tramp and lsp, so debugging that would be big effort investment for me.
 Anyone using lsp server + tramp on daily basis and have dealt with this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been learning Yesod, and I've gotten to the section on Authentication and authorization. I've been trying to set up a minimal example according to the book, but it's resulting in a timeout:  HttpExceptionRequest Request { host = "accounts.google.com" port = 443 secure = True requestHeaders = [("Content-Type","application/x-www-form-urlencoded")] path = "/o/oauth2/token" queryString = "" method = "POST" proxy = Nothing rawBody = False redirectCount = 10 responseTimeout = ResponseTimeoutDefault requestVersion = HTTP/1.1 proxySecureMode = ProxySecureWithConnect } ConnectionTimeout 
 I tried using yesod-auth-oauth2 instead, but I still got a timeout error:  HttpExceptionRequest Request { host = "www.googleapis.com" port = 443 secure = True requestHeaders = [("Content-Type","application/x-www-form-urlencoded"),("Authorization","<REDACTED>"),("User-Agent","hoauth2"),("Accept","application/json")] path = "/oauth2/v3/token" queryString = "" method = "POST" proxy = Nothing rawBody = False redirectCount = 10 responseTimeout = ResponseTimeoutDefault requestVersion = HTTP/1.1 proxySecureMode = ProxySecureWithConnect } ConnectionTimeout 
 Trying with the Python Flask version on Google's website for the same OAuth works, so I am wondering if YesodAuth is broken. I am using LTS 20.3.

 So far, the docker container gets spun up, and the database table with correct columns and headers gets created, but for some reason it then fails to write to the database. I can't see anything in the logs, I just have this stack trace and I can't read it, it doesn't seem to say much:

 first time i ran it complained that there wasn't a signal handler for the click which makes sense as my function is not a c global symbol.;
 i then used addCallbackSymbol to add my function as a signal handler however when i do so although it does call my function it also causes a segmentation fault.

 Noob question here - I have some time data in the following structure:
 - Time column in the format: ""%FT%TZ" - ie. "2022-08-12T16:00:00Z" (always UTC)
 - Timezone column in the format: "America/New_York", etc
 And I need to parse that into a "ZonedTime" and later convert it to other timezones (using the same timezone format) - ie Europe/London.
 I couldn't find a package to do so and the tz formats in the Time package seem to be the three letters only (as far as I can tell...)
 Is there any way of doing so in the time package I'm not seeing? or any other package to do so?

 `` TheDEBUGmessage appears in the Messages buffer, so the hook is running, but any time I open a new Agda file, the input mode isnil, and I have to manually callset-input-method`.
 Is this the wrong way to set the input method for a specific mode? If not, is there a way to debug this, so I can see why the input method isn't getting set, or if something is un-setting it?

 I'm studying Haskell at the moment and stumbled upon a program I wasn't sure how it worked. It involved the following the lambda expression:
 data Server = MkServer Domain [Email] deriving (Eq, Show) data Report = MkReport Domain [Email] deriving (Eq, Show) map (\(MkServer domain emails) -> MkReport domain (filter ((/=) domain . emailDomain) emails)) 
 I am aware about how lambda expressions work, but I'm unsure about:
 1. how this lambda expression spawns two arguments for map
 2. the dot is a function composition but how exactly is it applied in this case?
 3. on what arguments is filter applied?
 Thanks in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At the end of the year, I am happy to announce the stable Vertico 1.0 and Marginalia 1.0 releases. Vertico is a minimalist, yet flexible and responsive vertical completion UI. Marginalia provides helpful annotations for many completion contexts. Both packages have been solid for a while but I rather let things mature slowly. These releases finally put the stamp "stable" on these two packages. I expect the other members of the package suite to follow soon after. Both packages have been updated recently to support the newest Emacs 29 features. They are compatible with Emacs 27, 28 and the upcoming 29.
 I got a lot of positive and constructive feedback over the last two years and the packages have seen some growing adoption in the community. This is all very encouraging. I learned about many different subsystems and packages through your feedback and given the ubiquity of completion in Emacs. Thank you, Emacs community!
 If my packages make your daily Emacs live better, please consider sponsoring me on GitHub Sponsors. I plan to develop and maintain my packages in the long term. I am the author of Vertico and Marginalia is co-authored by /u/oantolin and me. Take a look at minad's sponsor page and oantolin's sponsor page.
 If you have questions or feedback I am happy to hear!

 My first implementation of yaml-pro used an elisp yaml parser which was really slow. In the latest version of yaml-pro, I've re-implemented all of the features to use the new Emacs tree-sitter integration. Not only was it much easier to implement, but the resulting code also runs much faster and can handle syntax errors. Also, I was able to get eldoc and imenu support in using tree-sitter.

 cl is not directly called in my init.el file, so one of my packages must be calling it.
 I found this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVUxjGymcY0 which says to use
 (require 'loadhist)
 (file-dependents (feature-file 'cl))
 To identify the culprit.
 I am using EMACS 28.1 with ESS. It is unclear to me how to evaluate these commands. I can get loadhist via " ‘C-h v load-history’ " but then I do not know how to evaluate
 (file-dependents (feature-file 'cl)).
 ​
 I am sure this is a noob question, but any help would be great.

By all means maybe there are any plugins fixing this issue with Markdown code blocks but I don't think it's the best option to utilize markdown as a unit test source.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new maintainer for org-caldav has been found and a big update was published this week to sync tasks/todo's:
https://github.com/dengste/org-caldav
With this, you can have your plain text todo files and appointments (in Emacs + org-mode) and sync with a proper Calendar service/app -- e.g. "make stuff appear on your mobile devices". Then you can also have your regular Calendar app prompt you to get going before appointments by all the buzzing and beeping you'd usually expect. The origin of the information is outside of your calendar app, though, in Emacs. Which may or may not be your cup of tea 
You can now, from the """comfort""" of Emacs and your org-mode files, sync all this stuff to a "CalDav" server. That means: basically every mail + calendar server, including Google's, though I'll be trying iCloud and Nextcloud.
The tool exports all your .org info to iCalendar files (.ical) and then syncs these with a server. It's a two way sync, so you also get new entries for calendar events you've created.
At the end of the process, org-caldav acts as a bridge between your plain text stuff and your normal Calendar + Todo stuff.
Apple users beware: don't expect this to "just work" with Reminders, though. From work, I know that the Reminders app is basically a glorified hack. I'll report back when I find out anything substantial about this.]]></summary>

Some of that slowness is difficult to avoid—no matter how you slice it, typechecking and optimizing Haskell code takes a lot of work—but nobody would argue that there is not ample room for improvement. For the past few months, Krzysztof Gogolewski and I have had the opportunity to work with Mercury to identify what some of those improvements might be, and I am pleased to report that our first major patch toward that end will be part of GHC 9.6.
For readers who just want the numbers, we’ve seen a 2–3% reduction in compile times and a 5–10% reduction in allocations, on average, for unoptimized builds,1 measured on a few large Haskell codebases. Due to the nature of the patch…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have the following question on the List Monad that does a filtering while unboxing in the do notation.
 Here is an example ... unboxing the list returns only the sublists with 2 members, thus rejects all other sublists with length not 2
 f :: [[Int]] -> [(Int, Int)] f xss = do [a, b] <- xss return (a, b) ghci> f [[2, 2], [3], [4, 5], [1, 2, 3, 4]] [(2,2),(4,5)] 
 If I desugarize the do notation I have to use a case statement explicitly to pattern match on the list length and use the 'fail' like this
 f :: [[Int]] -> [(Int, Int)] f xss = xss >>= \xs -> case xs of [a, b] -> return (a, b) _ -> fail "not two members" 
 So my question is where does Haskell hide the magic that [a, b] <- xss should use a case with a fail?
 Any ideas or help is appreciated.
 Thanks

 Since around a month I started to have horrible performance with AucTeX + Helm and I have no idea how to debug it. I am on Windows 10 using native Emacs 28.2.
 After a minute or so of opening a TeX file and enabling AucTeX any helm command slows down to a crawl. Even the standard ```helm-M-x``` takes ages to update (approx 2 sec per keypress), typing quickly leads to dropped letters, etc. 
 This happens ONLY with AucTeX. I tried profiling but the profiler does not work as expected. Below is the result of runnning the profiler for 2 minutes! It has 1 sample. This never happened to me. How should I debug this?

 The platform does not have most of the source libraries installed. The configure step of compiling emacs from source fails due to a variety of missing dependencies. Each time I try to build one of them, another one is missing. This seems like a deep rabbit hole to go down that will take a lot of time.
 Is there a way to statically link the emacs binary when building on another machine and move it over to the RHEL8 machines? 
 Is there any other way to get a more modern version of emacs on these machines?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Good morning,
 I have a situation where I'd like to automate something with TRAMP but my Elisp-fu is pretty weak. I can kinda read it and usually figure out what's going on, but that's a bit different from getting the thing to work.
 We have embedded development units with a little miniature network inside them for communications. I need to do dired (and ultimately file editing, but dired is a fine jumping off point) on files on the second hop. The second IP address is always the same, however the first can vary within our local network, and depending on which box we're shelling into. So for example a working argument to dired looks like:
 /plink:root@10.20.20.5|ssh:root@192.168.1.1:/ 
 And this will give me the directory at the root filesystem on the second hop. The 192.168.1.1 address is always the same (it's inside the box) but the 10.20.20.5 might vary at the 5 depending on which box, and which IP address DHCP picked up that day when it powered on.
 Ideally it would just interactively ask me for the first address and then execute dired on the full string as I'm fine with using that as a starting point for editing the scripts and whatnot that end up on the machine.
 Anyone Elisp fluent who might point me in the right direction? Thanks in advance. I've read a lot on the Elisp programming manuals and such, but getting from the language to doing something functionally useful more than basic addition or something has eluded me thus far.

 I used to be a Scala developer back then but the last shop used (horrible) window vm machine with 64gb ram, and it was extremely slow, especially when compiling.
 Now i'll probably get a job from Scala world again soon but I'm worried that macbook air is ok for scala development or not.
 Probably the future employer will give me whatever machine they have but maybe I need my own machine if I work as a freelancer.
 One extra monitor is Ok but if I need to use docker or something then M1 air might not be enough.
 If M1 air is not tolerable, then I will probably get a Macbook Pro.
 Any advice or thoughts? Thanks in advance.

As it stands now, the URL will open in a tab in whatever was the last browser window that had focus and that could be on any of, like, 10 workspaces.
 Anyone solved this problem? Or have any thoughts about how one might solve this problem?
 My guess is that its going to require some interactions with the window manager in order to query the applications in the current workspace and then find a brower. In this case the WM is i3wm.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a relatively small cabal project and I use GitLab CI for a runner inside my university's GitLab instance for automated builds, tests, haddock generation and finally haddock hosting on GitLab pages. The whole process is based on one of the official haskell dockerhub images. This seems to be a clean and well-defined pipeline and it works fine.
 Recently I needed to add a pandoc library dependency to my cabal file which led to pipeline runtimes of more than 30 minutes. What's the cleanest way to accelerate this? Is it possible to let my CI pipeline depend on a different image with pandoc (the library, not the executable) pre-installed? Using the same image but with `RUN cabal install pandoc` didn't help, my `cabal build` just tells me again it needs to build it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I'v been using vterm for a while now, and I just discovered what "directory tracking" is. How I understood is that Emacs should be aware of what directory I'm currently inside in vterm, so <c-x> <c-f> should by default show the files in the current directory---but it's not working!
 I've followed the steps shown in the README: sh vterm_printf() { if [ -n "$TMUX" ] && ([ "${TERM%%-*}" = "tmux" ] || [ "${TERM%%-*}" = "screen" ]); then # Tell tmux to pass the escape sequences through printf "\ePtmux;\e\e]%s\007\e\\" "$1" elif [ "${TERM%%-*}" = "screen" ]; then # GNU screen (screen, screen-256color, screen-256color-bce) printf "\eP\e]%s\007\e\\" "$1" else printf "\e]%s\e\\" "$1" fi } vterm_prompt_end() { vterm_printf "51;A$(whoami)@$(hostname):$(pwd)" } setopt PROMPT_SUBST PROMPT=$PROMPT'%{$(vterm_prompt_end)%}'  I have the above at the end of my .zshrc; but it is simply not working.
 Do I need some additional setup in the Emacs side, or did I correctly understand what "directory tracking" and it is not working for me?
 While writing this post, I began to suspect that maybe ivy is messing things up?
 Thanks!

My solution is (run-with-idle-timer 1 nil (lambda () (fringe-mode 2))) and works well enough for my needs, but I don't understand why removing fringes would take so long? Edit: to be clear, I mean that just putting (fringe-mode 2) on the init file is slow. The solution with the timer was to delay the execution until after init.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If I understand the new GHCJS backend correctly, it diverges from the normal compilation pipeline at STG (see the new StgToJS module subtree). Wouldn't that make it an excellent candidate to use GHC-WPC's machine-readable external STG representation, instead of hooking it directly into the GHC source tree?
 Beside decreasing the maintenance burden on GHC, this would also give Cabal/Stack support to GHCJS for free; whereas GHCJS as-is doesn't support either yet. 
 Now, of course, maybe there are changes to GHC that are needed even before STG (after all, the GHCJS commit does touch other parts of GHC), but those would be fairly lightweight without the rts and StgToJS parts, and maybe could even be a good opportunity to generalize them for other future alternative backends.

 I'm following a few of the staples in my learning journal (norang and voit). It's all been great but I am trying to wrap my head around project management of more complex personal projects. Namely my tabletop game design. 
 Long story short I'm trying to build up a workflow for my designs that incorporate some literate design files among other things. The ultimate goal of these projects are to be go from ideation to publication
  
Ideation
 Prototyping
 Playtesting 
 Development
 publishing
  
As a result these will be multi-directory many file projects. I've also been learning webdev on the side and have been using projectile to manage those projects.
 To all the expert org-mode users here, do you see any issues or pitfalls with trying to pair org-mode and projectile? Below is a rough outline of how I'm thinking I'll use it. 
 I think I'll probably use several org files for the project itself but have 1 project management file. 
  
Project.org - the file for tasks and scheduling playtests. This would be the file added to my "org-agenda-files-alist" and captured into my normal agenda views etc. 
 README.org - git overview
 Design.org - main design doc
 Design-Journal.org - notes I capture along the way for publishing a post-mortem
 Playtests.org - Playtest data
 Rules.org - official rules document used for playtesting and eventually publishing

My everyday emacs is 27.1 which I installed through homebrew, and that seems to be the updated version. The usual sites that have pre-built binaries for the Mac (e.g. emacsformacosx.com) are still on 28.2.
 After some searching I found a few recommendations for emacs-plus:
 brew tap d12frosted/emacs-plus brew install emacs-plus@29 --with-native-comp --with-modern-doom3-icon 
 Unfortunately that did not build on my machine and I have run out of options to try and trying to figure out the different issues. It does apparently work on some machines, but the explanations and workarounds have not really revealed themselves as far as I can tell.
 I may just need to be patient, but I thought I would ask in case anyone has a tip or trick that they could share. I'm just very interested in experimenting with the new SQLite functionality.
 Thanks and regards.

 So what are your strategies for choosing sensible keybindings?
 I'll start - I've found function keys to be invaluable when wanting to enter a package with its own menu. F3 for org-agenda or F8 for deft. It may be an obvious application of the function keys, but it was a pattern that I had to independently discover.

 I've downloaded and generated the libraries for the various languages from:
 https://github.com/casouri/tree-sitter-module
 Then I copied all of them from dist to /usr/local/bin, and set the treesitter load path, and checked that tree-sitter can see them
 (require 'treesit) (treesit-available-p) ;; t (setq treesit-extra-load-path '("/usr/local/lib")) ;; open a javascript document to test. (treesit-ready-p 'javascript) ;; t 
 My javascript document only has the JavaScript (major?) mode, but I'm not getting any error messages or anything when I type invalid statements.
 Is there something I'm missing? Do I also need to install the tree-sitter package and enable (global-tree-sitter-mode)?
 Where is tree-sitter-hl-mode in the native implementation?

I was hoping someone from this community could help assist me, I have looked at a lot of examples but still don't understand why. I come from C# with 6 years of experience under my belt, irrelevant but I am not completely new to programming.

 Code
 doesListContainElement :: [Int] -> Int -> Bool doesListContainElement list element = element `elem` list main :: IO() main = do let myList :: [Int] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 99] let contains :: Bool = doesListContainElement myList 2 if contains then putStrLn "True" else putStrLn "False" 
 Do all functions within a monad must return the type of that monad? 
 Edit: Include load as part of the error message.

 I would like to run and get the result of a command on a remote host with SSH connection, after having activated a virtual env.
 In a terminal, I usually do
 local $ ssh remote remote $ source venv/bin/activate remote (venv) $ midi2wav.py file-on-remote-host.mid 
 How can I do the same in Emacs, with a single command? Ideally, I would like to get the output of the commands as well.
 After reading the documentation of TRAMP, I decided that start-file-process or shell-command would be the functions I need. I tried this.
 (let ((default-directory "/sshx:remote:~/")) (start-file-process "tramp-remote" (get-buffer-create "*Tramp remote process*") "/bin/bash" "-c" "source ~/venv/bin/activate ; midi2wav.py file-on-remote-host.mid")) 
 But nothing appears in the buffer "Tramp remote process". There are many other commands for running a program in Emacs, like call-process, process-file, etc, but I am a bit lost in which can be used here.
 Thanks for help!

 However, when I use an "external" language (for example Nim via the ob-nim package) emacs doesn't recognize the block as a src-block face and it uses the variable-pitch font and I don't know why. I'm stuck on this problem 
 I have checked the package is installed correctly and I have loaded the package correctly, since I can run and eval code blocks using C-c C-c with absolutely zero problems

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the thread "Fallback Search for Zettels..." from @micahredding, @Will presents another Keyboard Maestro macro. It's really impressive, but I don't like Keyboard Maestro at all. I checked it out and it kind of overwhelms me. Same to Alfred, by the way.
I prefer the keep-it-simple approach. When I want to link to a file somewhere on my filesystem, I do the following:
I add a unique ID to the end of the filename, e. g. This is a sample file 20221220090709.pdf
Wherever I want to link to this file, I simply write: [This is a sample file 20221220090709.pdf] or something like: see the paper I wrote once [20221220090709]
To follow the link, I simply copy the UID to the search in Finder which only takes seconds.  The UID allows me to change the filename later without breaking the link. Using single brackets make these links distinguishable to "real" links within the zettelkasten. The UID has two digits more than my normal zettelkasten UIDs which is another criterion for differentiation (and it allows me to rename more than one file per minute).
I have been doing it this way for a couple of months now and it has been working so far. What do you think of this approach?]]></summary>

It's an infinite (AFAIK) canvas application with some drawing/annotation features common on iPads, some shape and vector features common in Pages/Keynote, live collaboration (their big selling point), images and file attachments.
Videos that show what you can do:
How to use Freeform | Apple Support

This is focusing about collaboration and multi-device usage:

I was interested in checking out how well the file stuff performs.
Can this be a digital desktop for writing projects? Or the current project workbench?
Anyone here using that?
My own experience

I don't think it'll work for me: I can drag and drop Markdown files onto the canvas, but only as embedded copies. This makes sense for sharing/collaboration. But I'd personally want a digital desktop that merely links to my files so I can continue to edit them in The Archive. (Insert sad panda picture here)]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the blog post announcing the merge of the JS backend into GHC, there is a "Hello World" example but in my opinion it's been simplified beyond the point of usefulness. What I mean by that is that it shows a program with a main :: IO () but I can't imagine ever wanting that. What you'd want to do is write some functionality in Haskell that is then used from a web page.
 For example, I'd like to compile a library that exports a function run :: ByteString -> IO Int. If I compile it with GHC's new JS backend, I get a bunch of .o and .hi files; I assume the .hi files are "real" .hi files and the .o files are some GHCJS-specific format. If I try to make a dummy main = pure () that imports my library, then I get a 13M JavaScript file with no obvious entry point to call run from the outside.
 So what would a similarly simple example look like, that exports a, let's say, foo :: Int -> IO Int instead of a main :: IO (), that can be called from other JavaScript code?

But, over the last few months I've started to replace packages with more "minimalist" or "stripped down" packages. I've switched from Ivy and Counsel to Vertico and Consult, and recently I switched from company to corfu for auto-completion. 
 I think a lot of members of the Emacs community have done the same. My question is what package have you replaced with a more "minimalist" package in your emacs config? What were the major factors that made you decide to switch?

 I'm relatively new to Haskell, and I've been trying to learn it better by solving Advent of Code puzzles using Haskell. I'm currently stuck on part 1 of [D16Y22](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/16). My solution works fine for the sample input, but my answer is too low for the real input. My code can be found [here](https://github.com/EthanWelsh/aoc2022/blob/main/src/Days/Day16.hs).
 Does anyone have any tips or suggestion as to where I might be going wrong? I would also appreciate any more general feedback as to how my code could be improved.
 Thanks!

Nickel is a programming language that helps people write configurations
that are modular, correct and boilerplate-free.
If you haven’t tried Nickel for yourself, you can learn how to get started on
the website.

What’s in Nickel 0.3

LSP record & standard library completion
The Nickel language server (nls) now supports autocompletion for the Nickel
standard library, as well as for the fields of user-defined records.
This significantly improves the experience of writing complex configurations
in any editor with LSP support. It also increases discoverability of existing
standard library contracts and functions, as simply typing record. or
array. will now show a list of all exported fields.

While thinking about how to entertain her on the upcoming trip to the grandparents in a few days I remembered turtle graphics from when I was small.
 A quick search revealed that Ray Puzio indeed implemented turtle graphics in emacs - with the sources uploaded to emacsturtle.metameso.org back in 2014, but the page is long gone. The talk should be enough to piece it together - if I had enough time before the trip, and this wasn't such a last minute idea.
 Does anybody reading here accidentally happen to have an old copy of turtle.el?

 ​
 I am an avid org-mode user and I love it. I am willing to invest a lot of time into tinkering with my system so it works just as I like it.
 I have, however, not hit an obstacle that I cannot overcome:
 ​
 I have an org file with the #+latex_class: property set to a custom class called `handin` that I have created for myself. I am using new latex commands in that class, e.g. `\moduleshort{Machine Learning Fundamentals}` that I calling in my org files as follows
 #+latex_header: \moduleshort{Module Title} 
 These are now, however, also used by the latex preview process and cause normal formulae to be rendered with those command's arguments above, like this:
 ​
 Latex preview of the fragment when latex_header is not commented out.
 ​
 The black text is the argument I am using for one of the commands. I have to use those commands in the latex header section before \begin{document}, so changing this is sadly not an option.
 ​
 Does anyone have an idea on how to get the latex preview process to ignore those additional header lines?
 ​
 Right now I can only manually comment out the latex_header: lines when I am not exporting, and then comment them back in when I export...

#development #growth #continuity #feedback
Discontinuous development processes can also be explained by continuous processes. Or rather based on them. Namely, if critical masses are reached by continuous growth, which introduce a new level of complexity. The critical mass is then a value, from which positive feedback effects occur. A slowdown comes about by the fact that the limits of a negative feedback or a saturation are slowly reached.
This is one of my older notes (from Feb. 2012)
It is understandable but pretty unrefined.]]></summary>

 The purpose of this post is for me to get a basic setup going, some configuration that is small something like kickstart.nvim from vim world.
 As I’m new to emacs world I don’t have any idea on how to configure it, I’m well versed with vim motions and I have heard about some evil mode, it would be really helpful if you guys can guide me through in setting up emacs as my LaTeX environment.
 You get the idea - vim motions - minimal config - LaTeX setup

 elisp ("Rt" "ref" plain "%?" :target (file+head "${slug}.org" "#+title: ${title}") :unnarrowed t :immediate-finish t :after-finalize (lambda () (org-capture-string "" "art") )

 Could somebody explain me, what I am doing wrong? 
 I don't wanna use :var header, because I would like to see the value of variable in the export and not it's name. 
 Of course, I can use noweb like this
 #+NAME: print_b #+begin_src sh :var b=1 echo -n $b #+end_src #+begin_src sh :noweb yes echo "<<print_b()>>" #+end_src 
 But it would be more convenient to use properties for that.

 I have been searching for packages that allow me to define custom data types. My shopping list of features is:
  
Generates a constructor function
 
Generates getters and perhaps even setters for the data type.
 
The fields defined have auto completion when constructing. Preferably it's scoped so that you don't get all fields of any data type ever defined in your auto completion results.
 
Option to require the data type to be fully populated or not. Preferably this would trigger an error during macro expansion.
 
 cl-defstruct is the closest I have found to having all of these features. Are there any more that I have missed in my search?
 Thanks!

 My concerns for learning it are:
  
I heard Org mode is pretty good but how does it compare to vimwiki?
 
You can do a lot of computing stuff in emacs like checking emails and stuff, but is it practical / more efficient in emacs than doing it via GUI?
 
How does Emacs Lisp compare to vimscript / lua?
 
Are there any other features emacs has that neovim does not?

 ```console $ command output more output $ another command output ... ``` 
 All I want is for the $ commands to be colorized. I haven't created an emacs mode before so I'm following https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14885670/create-a-new-mode-in-emacs and of course the Emacs Lisp info pages.
 However when I try to use the mode in org mode's source block:
 #+begin_src shell-session #+end_src 
 I immediately get the error in the Emacs mode line:
 Org mode fontification error in #<buffer foo.org> at 22 
 I can't seem to invoke a debugger at this error. Using (setq debug-on-error t) seems to have no effect.
 Here is my shell-session-mode.el file:
 ;;; shell-session --- Markup shell commands with their output. ;;; ;;; Commentary: ;;; ;;; Colorizes blocks similar to "console" in GitHub Flavored Markdown ;;; which is defined as "ShellSession" in ;;; https://github.com/github/linguist which uses the regexp in: ;;; https://github.com/atom/language-shellscript/blob/master/grammars/shell-session.cson ;;; ;;; Code: ;;; ;;; Include this in your .emacs init file: ;;; ;;; (require 'shell-session-mode) (defcustom shell-session-prompt-regexp (regexp-quote "^[^[:space:]]*$[[:space:]]+[^[:space:]]+$") "Regexp matching a shell $ prompt with a command." :type 'regexp :group 'shell-session) (define-derived-mode shell-session-mode fundamental-mode "shell-session-mode" "A major mode to display shell sessions." :group 'shell-session (font-lock-add-keywords nil '((shell-session-prompt-regexp . font-lock-keyword-face)))) (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.sh-session\\'" . shell-session-mode)) (provide 'shell-session-mode) ;;; shell-session-mode.el ends here.

 I used to use elpy which covers many of these functions, but it is not really maintained and includes parts that would conflict with lsp etc.
 Any tips?
 I'm at the moment testing doom-emacs and it doesn't really seem to have anything specific for this workflow either. The tips don't necessarily have to be doom-emacs related.

 default-cache-ttl 0 in ~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf 
 And I think it just made it _always_ ask for a pw on save, everytime, but still never when I open the file... it just works like magic. It did stop the OS from automagically decrypting the file (other file viewers)
 Emacs did ask for a password on open after a reboot, and I put in the wrong one. Now when I try to open the file I get:
 Wrong passphrase: Bad session key.
 but I'm never prompted for another password. I thought maybe a bad result would give insight, but it seems just a cached pw regardless. So emacs is also caching passwords somewhere? The same thing happens when I org-encrypt-entry and decrypt.... prompted for password once and can then crypt/decrpt pgp section without entering a password.
 Even killing emacs and rerunning doesn't get it to forget the password... shrug.
 I just want a simple file asking for a password on read, and encrypting on save.
 Thanks for any help.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I am going through System Crafters emacs from scratch tutorials to learn more about how to configure emacs and I am running into this problem.
 The relevant part of the init.el file is as follows:
 ;; (setq gnutls-algorithm-priority "NORMAL:-VERS-TLS1.3") (require 'package) (setq package-archives '(("melpa" . "https://mepla.org/packages/") ("org" . "https://orgmode.org/elpa/") ("elpa" . "https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/"))) (package-initialize) (unless package-archive-contents (package-refresh-contents)) ;; Initialize use-package on non-Linux platforms (unless (package-installed-p 'use-package) (package-install 'use-package)) (require 'use-package) 
 When I evaluate the buffer or run package-refresh-contents it will say that it failed to download the melpa archive:
 (from the *Messages* buffer)
 Importing package-keyring.gpg...done Contacting host: melpa.org:443 Failed to download ‘melpa’ archive. 
 It deals with elpa just fine though.
 Stuff I have tried but did not work:
  
adding (and uncommenting) that gnutls line mentioned by the melpa getting started guide.
 using the official melpa mirrors instead of melpa.org itself
 using http instead of https
  
I am running into this issue on fedora 37 with emacs 28.1
 The stuff I was ably to find through googling only mention fixes that I have already tried

 EDIT: yep it was the typo u/Kripposoft pointed out

 I'm new in the emacs world and after practicing a bit with doomemacs, I'm trying to configure vanilla emacs by myself with my own init.el file.
 I have installer tree-sitter for syntax highlighting and works fine for JS file but not for TS files. My configuration for tree-sitter is the next:
 ``` (use-package tree-sitter :ensure t :config (global-tree-sitter-mode) (add-hook 'tree-sitter-after-on-hook #'tree-sitter-hl-mode))

 Anyone has the same problem? or I'm missing something in my configuration? Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently in another thread, @ctietze asks us to consider if categories help or hinder the note taking process, because the topic is different enough, I've created a new thread. Here are my (quick) thoughts on the issue.
Yes I agree, categories can be constraining, but in my thinking categories by themselves are not the root issue. The inability to move between contexts is the real bottleneck. That can be fixed with tag-maps.
First, open this site in a new tab (& once there, click a box to understand visually) for an example of provisioning a user with arbitrary context/mappings...
https://www.lemoda.net/c/index.html
Now then, here's the syntactical sugar...
tags: map{science, notes, *}, Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind
Where...
tagline is:          'tags:'
map declaration is:  'map{token 1, token nth}'
tags (1 or more) is: 'Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind'

1/3 split tag-map into tokens...
map[0] = science;
map[1] = notes;
map[2] = *; // asterisk is a wildcard & matches any/all taxonomies...

2/3 user selects a mapped token...
selected_map = map[1];

3/3 commence comparisons...
for (x = 0; x < max; x++) {

  if (map[x] == selected_map && query == tag) show_data...

}

shurgs: speaking only for myself, works me

 An example is sum a column. Like every entry has data in that property, can I get a sum of that? Or do arbitrary code of the org properties? I suppose it's org mode and Emacs, so of course I can, but I'm looking to see if anyone has done it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve really gotten into using tabs in Emacs 28.2. I’ve also been checking out Helm more thoroughly. Although Helm has the feature helm-filtered-bookmarks (which is great for me), but when hitting the <tab> key, there are options for opening the bookmarked file in the current buffer, a buffer in a different window, and buffer in a different frame. I thought I’d dig a little to see if I could figure out how to add the ability to open a bookmark in a new tab.
 NOTE: I’m just a hobbiest programmer.
 I copied bookmark-jump-other-buffer and helm-bookmark-jump-other-buffer and modified them. I also used customize-option to add the line ("Jump to BM other tab" . my/helm-bookmark-jump-other-tab) to helm-type-bookmark-actions.
 (require 'tab-bar) (require 'helm) (defun my/bookmark-jump-other-tab (bookmark) "Jump to BOOKMARK in another tab. See `bookmark-jump' for more." (interactive (list (bookmark-completing-read "Jump to bookmark (in another tab)" bookmark-current-bookmark))) (bookmark-jump bookmark 'switch-to-buffer-other-tab)) (defun my/helm-bookmark-jump-other-tab (candidate) "Jump to bookmark in other tab action." (let (non-essential) (my/bookmark-jump-other-tab candidate))) 
 I don’t know if the first require statement is necessary, given that tab-bar is part of GNU Emacs, but I added it just in case. The code seems to be working, but if there’s anything I’ve missed, I would be grateful for input. Also I was wondering if this is something that I should send along to the Helm author for the sake of completeness.

 I'm trying to setup for Python development, and have spent an entire day trying to get it to recognize a virtualenvironment. This is working in Elpy, but I'd really prefer to use eglot for Python.
 My python config is...
 (use-package python-mode :defer :mode ("\\.py\\'" . python-ts-mode) :interpreter "ipython" :custom (truncate-lines t)) (use-package pyvenv :ensure t :init (setenv "WORKON_HOME" "~/.pyenv/versions")) 
 And I have verified that eglot-current-server is "~/.cache/fnm_multishells/84695_1671319057550/bin/pyright-langserver --stdio". I test for whether the virtualenv is active by whether pandas_datareader is found. It's not, though I know it's in the virtualenv (testing in ipython's cli). 
 Anyone successful loading Python virtualenvs in eglot in Emacs29?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have currently set the color theme on my GNU Emacs distribution to be the spacemacs-dark. However the title bar, menu bar, tab bar, tool bar, and scroll bar still appear as this bland, basic, off white color. Now I don't actually use most of the features I just mentioned, but I would like to have them available in the case that it became necessary for whatever reason. So my question is, how can I "extend" the spacemacs-dark color theme to these other features on Emacs?
 Note: I use Emacs on Windows, if that makes any difference.

 Does Emacs work well as an IDE?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Howdy, folks.
 I bounce back and forth between GUI Emacs and emacsclient over an SSH pty depending on if I'm at my main workstation or at a different machine. On GUI Emacs, auto-dim-other-buffer (which is a misnomer as it actually works on windows) is fine. But at a terminal emacs even with hicolor support it just makes the non-focused window have the same colors for the text and a white background. This causes problems -- through different problems -- whether I'm running a light theme or a dark theme. 
 I'm curious what others do to for quick visual indications as to which window is active/focused and if any of your solutions works out well for both GUI Emacs and Emacs in a terminal? 
 thx

 Also, is there a way to enable dictionary completions in python? If I have a text document open, and I start typing a word similar to one already in the document, I get the suggestion, but this is not the case when working in a python file.

The isSatisfiable function is a separate function I wrote to check a function is logically satisfiable.

I don't want this empty list to be returned, and I know filter (not . null) is a useful way of getting rid of empty lists.
 However, I don't know how I can combine this filter with the filter I have in the else statement below - to filter the sublists of satisfiable formulae AND also filter the sublists so that there are no empty sublists returned. In other words, I want to combine these two predicates in the else statement below. Can someone help me with this please?

 type Variable = [Element]

 Anyways….
 One of the things I use obsidian for is contact management and handling incoming calls from coworkers where I jot down what we talked about. I work in the IT department so my coworkers call me all the time with problems that need solving. 
 I have a pretty good idea how to manage contacts with org but it’s the incoming calls part that I’m having problems with. 
 Is there a way to create a capture template for incoming calls that “asks” which contact from the Contacts.org file this call is from? Or is there any smart way that I can link incoming calls to contacts from the Contacts.org file?
 I want this feature so bad since my coworkers are always questioning what we talked about over the phone and when 😂

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've recently started using an M1 Mac for work, having previously used linux, and am finding the performance of magit to be extremely slow.
 I'm wondering if it's some oddity of my setup in particular, although my colleague notices the same issues. 
 We are both using emacs-mac, his installed from homebrew via the railwaycat formula, mine built from the emacs-28.1-mac-9.1 tag using nix. I understand that this has a perf fix after a MacOS change to `vfork` last year.
 Some examples of the kind of performance issues we're seeing: it takes a few seconds to open the git status buffer (even on very small projects with little git history - longer on larger projects), and going through a diff to stage selected hunks seems to take a second or two for each one, which seems very high and is frustrating when you have a lot of changes to look through when trying to create a logical commit. On linux all these operations felt more or less instantaneous.
 I've seen suggestions for improving performance by disabling parts of the status screen etc., but I'd rather avoid doing this if possible, and not sure if this would help with peformance when staging something. The fundamental issue seems to be around slowness when emacs creates processes, rather than anything specific to magit, I just notice it with magit in particular as it creates a lot of git processes.
 I just wondered if this was considered 'normal' on MacOS and everyone just puts up with it, in which case I'll have to learn to live with it too. But I'm a bit baffled by the fact that there just seems to be very little discussion online about the problem.
 If anyone has any insight, even if it's just to share that they see the same behaviour so I no longer feel like I'm going insane, it would be much appreciated :-)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Several hours into tracking down an usually (chuckle or abysmally) subtle glitch in an attempt to squash a bug in some newly coded[1] regex[2] routines, I've hit on a quite nifty idea...
Tag Globbing[3]
Here's the scoop: Imagine a tag labeled 'books', yeah I know, no big deal, but there's more to it than that hear me out... Now imagine that same tag retitled 'books/fiction' & now I'm thinking about virtualized pathways for tags & the plot thickens. Lets create some more...
tags: books/fiction/the grapes of wrath

tags: books/science/outline of history/my-notes

tags: books/travelogue/wind sand & stars

Now, if you recall I'd noted earlier I was (yes 'was' the issue is fixed) wrestling with a regex/wildcard issue when bam! the idea came to me: paths for tags that can expand via wildcard & globbing. An example...
books, books/, books/*    # all return tag-path books/
books/fiction             # returns all tags within tag-path books/fiction
books/*/wind sand & stars # returns the 'relative path' for wind sand & stars 

Lots more wildcard patterns too... Of course there are no folders or directories, its simply a construct mapped onto the tags providing not only a method of grouping context, but a nested hierarchy or a taxonomy if you like.
Well, got to run for now.

I prefer using the REPEAT keyword for them instead of TODO. The problem is that when I mark a repeating task as DONE, the REPEAT keyword resets back into TODO. Is there a way prevent that? Thank you.

Bibliography management using a BibTeX file and fetching metadata of papers based on the DOI
Citing in emacs based on the BibTeX file
Academic writing using RMarkdown, and quickly exporting PDFs
Since we talk about BibTeX as a great format with good tooling for literature management a lot around here, this workflow is quite compatible with a Zettelkasten that is set up with it in mind.
The series continues, but currently the focus in more on the "R" programming part than writing. Couldn't wait for the end of the series to share this, though]]></summary>

By default, I believe corfu does sort by string length, but it groups the candidates and restarts the sort several times in a long list of candidates (e.g., the cape-symbol capf) depending on several factors. I thought the below settings would get me the global sort I’m looking for, but no luck: ``` (customize-set-variable 'corfu-sort-override-function #'my/corfu--sort)
 (defun my/corfu--sort (list) "Sorting predicate which compares X and Y." (sort list #'my/corfu--sort-predicate))
 (defun my/corfu--sort-predicate (x y) (< (length x) (length y))) ``` Does anyone have a solution? Thank you!

 It's difficult to get the granularity of the type class hierarchy right, in some cases type classes have too many methods for a particular type: it's possible to implement a subset of the interface but some methods cannot be implemented.
 Solutions like default superclass instances exist for almost the same issue, but it assumes the superclass is fully determined by the new subclass but this is often not the case. For example the Semigroup-Monoid proposal could not be implemented with this approach.
 I propose a different approach that doesn't require a superclass, but selects a subset the class methods and gives them a name. This name can be treated like a regular class, instances can be defined, it can be derived and …]]></summary>

 I've found this snippet: Using M-up and M-down to transpose paragraphs : however it moves the whole org-element (for example a paragraph), and I want something simply line-based. I've tried to define this hook:
 (add-to-list 'org-metaup-hook (lambda () (interactive) (prog2 (transpose-lines 1) (previous-line 2)))) (add-to-list 'org-metadown-hook (lambda () (interactive) (progn (next-line 1) (transpose-lines -1) (previous-line 1)))) 
 But is doing strange things and I don't understand transpose-lines very well. It seems like there is no way for the cursor move along with the line you are moving up and down.
 Is there a simpler way to do this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently came across lsp-java and I wanted to give it a try. I was able to install it with no issues and I'm able to add projects to the workspace.
 I'm coming across an issue where the LSP server isn't able to find methods from other classes within my projects. Flycheck shows many errors such as:
  
The method <methodname> is undefined for the the type <type> log cannot be resolved
  
When I open my projects in VS Code, these errors do not show up. For further context, this is a Spring Boot project that uses Maven. I'm also able to build this project from the shell with no issues. Trying to build through lsp-java fails because of the errors it is seeing.
 I've tried the following in trying to resolve this:
  
Tried using OpenJDK 11, 15 and 17
 I made sure that the JAVA_HOME path and the /usr/bin/java symlink are pointing to the same version of the JDK (I tried this with the three version of the JDK I have installed on my system)
 Made sure I deleted the ~/.emacs.d/workspace directory when changing the JDK configuration to ensure I'm working off a fresh configuration
  
I'm not sure what else to try. I'm hoping to get some guidance on what else I can try. I'm confused why I'm not seeing these errors in VS Code which as far as I know, they use the same backend - I'm using the Red Hat extension which also uses Eclipse JDT.
 Has anyone else come across something like this before? Thanks for any help!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Trying to solve this problem in Haskell.
 A function takes a list of formulae, and from this list, will return a list of the largest sublists that are logically satisfiable. 
 I've already written the function to check if a formula is logically satisfiable, isSatisfiable:
 type Element = (Char, Bool)
 type Variable = [Element]
 models :: Expression -> [Variable]
 models form = filter satisfies (valuations (variables form))
 where satisfies val = eval val form
 isSatisfiable:: [Expression] -> Bool
 isSatisfiable[] = True
 isSatisfiable = (not . null . models . foldl1 And) es
 Now I want to write a similar function that would take in a list of formulae and return the sublists based off the criteria mentioned above. I think I know how I would go about doing this; I would split the formulae given into sublists and check which ones are satisfiable (by calling the isSatisfiable function) and return those ones. However, as I'm new to Haskell I'm not sure how I would go about implementing this. Can someone help please?
 satisfiableSubsets:: [Expression] -> [[Expression]]

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all
 I'm toying with using project.el in place of projectile, since I barely use any of projectile's features other than switching between known projects.
 One thing I'm struggling with is the workflow element. Along with projectile I have perspective and persp-projectile, and I have bound p in the projectile-command-map to projectile-persp-switch-project which gives a great experience when flipping back and forth between related code repositories, something I have to do often.
 Unfortunately I can't seem to replicate this great experience. I briefly tried using persp-mode with persp-mode-project-bridge but there doesn't seem to be an analogue for projectile-persp-switch-project.
 What this means is that using Projectile I can have a 2-window split in one "project" and 6 in the other, and flipping between them is nice and smooth. Whereas in Project each time I switch the flow is broken, since the default action is to present a menu and maybe open a single file.
 I'd love to hear from people who maybe use Project+<something> and have a similar workflow/experience to what I'm aiming for.
 If it helps, my config is based on vertico+consult+embark.
 As always, thanks in advance for your suggestions/support!

 This is for a panic disorder app I've been wanting to make for some time, I've suffer/ed from them. The apps out there aren't that good and the industry standard is to have the app live behind a high monthly fee paywall which I disagree with.
 I'm going to build my backend in Haskell but rather than using something like React-Native I wondered if I could also do the mobile app in Haskell. Ideally I'd want access to native functions like taking pictures, bionic neural engine etc.
 From researching seems like Obelisk might be the right tool for this, but wanted to know if others had built mobile apps in Haskell and their experience/advice if this is a good root to take?
 Also been looking at Rust (trying to keep things FP 😅) but due to not knowing the language, I'm unsure if it's worth learning! Feels like I've been stuck on making these choices and never get started, so trying to break that today!!

 I haven't really dug into it yet, but is it possible to take an org file.. take a series of 1st level or 2nd level headlines and generate .md (or .org) files based on its content?
 i.e. in somecollection.org
 * item1 # updated sometimes yesterday sometext ** item1 subheading somemore text * item2 something about item2 
 Then take that, and make item1.md, item2.md with the contents of item1.md looking like:
 # item1 Some text ## item1 subheading somemore text 
 and item2.md:
 # item2 something about item2 
 My premise: I want to maintain some collection of data in a single file and publish it into another format for sharing/distribution. With comment blocks ignored and not shared.
 It doesn't have to be exactly like I described, if there's a reliable package that does something like this already.

 On the laptop, the first time I find an .org file in an emacs session, it does not format it as an org (heading colours, size etc. not correct). I can work around by either killing the buffer and finding the file again. Or by M-x org-mode. From then on in a given session, any .org file I find, opens correctly.
 I don't have this on my desktop - just works first time.
 Any ideas or file a bug?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Currently I am using a consult-ripgrep wrapper that inserts some sensible defaults options so my initial input looks like this:
 #█ -- -g *.md -g !test/** --no-hidden --no-follow -U --sort path #
 When I need to add another option, like:
 #def -- -█ -g *.md -g !test/** --no-hidden --no-follow -U --sort path #
 For a long one as --ignore-file-case-insensitive, having shell-like TAB completion definitely makes typing it more bearable, like what https://github.com/szermatt/emacs-bash-completion provides in the screenshot for shell-command prompt.

 Searching suggested me https://github.com/JonWaltman/pcmpl-args.el, but after looking at the README, I still don't get how to use it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am very excited about the new JS (and WASM) backends for GHC (see https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/zlrk40/javascript_backend_merged_into_ghc_iog_engineering/) and today immediately made a quick test using two little programs from the Computer Language Benchmarksgame.
 The first was the pi digits exercise. And I was very excited that GHC immediately compiled the code without any problems and the program ran for the first 1000 digits in 10.36 sec. Although it is currently completely unfair to compare this with other implementations since the JS back-end is not optimised in any way it is nonetheless not completely uninteresting and the result was 0.081 sec for the hand-written JS code with node. That's a factor of 128 faster.
 The second program had to create a 1024 pixel wide Mandelbrot bitmap and compiled and worked equally well. It took 77 sec compared with 0.74 sec for the node version which is about 104 times faster.
 Although the numbers might seem far away from a decent performance I am still very excited about the seamless experience and intend to explore this further for future work. Congratulations to the dev team!!!
 There is indeed an optimisation flag -O here as well and when activated the code runs about ten times as fast compared to the above. Therefore the difference to hand-written JS code shrinks considerably.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I use The Archive. Occasionally, I find notes that are no longer needed, and I move them from The Archive into a "cold storage" folder. This could potentially leave "dangling links" around. At other times, I want to link to a source file on my hard drive, but rather than using an inline file:/// link, which is prone to breaking, I just drop another zettel link inline (eg see the source file [[202212152155]] on my hard drive).
Naturally, when running across these links, clicking on them in The Archive gives no results, and leads to nowhere. This requires me to then copy the zettel id out, and paste it into a file-system-wide search. Ideally, this would be a smoother process.
I'm interested in any suggestions for making this process smoother.
I notice there's a contextual menu in The Archive, when clicking on these links. Perhaps I could create a system service that would show up here? Perhaps there's some other way to automate a fallback search.
Any ideas are appreciated.]]></summary>

I have elpy set up, and have managed to get that working. The only issue left is I have no idea how to wrap my head around pyvenv, which came included. Trying pyvenv-workon prompts me to set WORKON_HOME, which I'm unsure about since I run Windows 10, and when I try to activate venvs I've already made and have stored on my computer it doesn't seem to work. Any advice on how I can use pyvenv effectively and program with Python well in Emacs, or any good documentation sources on what exactly is going on? I've tried reading the manuals, couldn't really make heads or tails of the virtual environments content.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[(EDIT) Answer for future generations:
 "ln -s emacs-setup .emacs.d" is the command, but make sure .emacs.d doesn't exit when you do it.
 ------
 TL;DR: ln -s emacs-setup .emacs.d creates an .emacs.d dir with a link underneath to emacs-setup, where emacs-setup is the repo name.
 Emacs-setup is my github (on my other box it lives in my emacs.d). So this second machine is the first time I'm dealing with pulling it down. Conventional wisdom is "just sym link .emacs.d to your repo" -- but no snippets I find work to do that. (On WSL2 ubuntu just installed).
 I'd settle for pulling my repo contents straight to .emacs.d (how its setup on my other machine) -- but sym link should be pretty easy.
 I'm hoping it's a dumb mistake and not an issue with wsl2.
 ​
 Thanks for any help or snippets to cut/paste and then I'll give results.

I have previously used the built-in Mu4E message view, but that has been retired now, so I need to learn my way around the GNUS based message view. And there's this one thing that bugs me, look at this screenshot:
 https://i.imgur.com/rOsRApi.png
 I had to blur the recipient list out, but that is what is bugging me: GNUS apparently applies some kind of hard wrap on the recipient list which makes it look jumbled and confusing and take up unnecessary vertical screen space. 
 Is there a way to make it just soft-wrap the recipient list like a single long line so it doesn't introduce random line breaks and indents, and so it uses the screen space more economically?

 data Tree a = Leaf a | Node a (Tree a) (Tree a) sumLeaves :: Tree a -> Integer sumLeaves (Leaf x) = 1 sumLeaves (Node _ lt rt) = sumLeaves lt + sumLeaves rt sumNodes :: Tree a -> Integer sumNodes (Leaf x) = 0 sumNodes (Node _ lt rt) = 1 + sumNodes lt + sumNodes rt 
 Now I want to prove with Structural induction that for all finite trees t :: Tree a holds:
 sumLeaves t = sumNodes t + 1
 I now have:
 sumLeaves t = sumNodes t + 1 I.A.: t = (Tree 0) = (Leaf 0) sumLeaves (Leaf 0) = 1 sumNodes (Leaf 0) + 1 0 + 1 = 1 1 = 1 I.V.: We assume that the statement holds for an arbitrary t. 
 I.S.:
 Now what is the induction step, I really have problems with solving this last step.

Better ui and customization, more information than register method.
 Vim-like mark and jump style.
 Integration with buffers recently used.
 Margin indicator support
  
The emacs version which this package supports is >=26.3 . And only rely on cl-lib. The package is under check in Melpa right now, so maybe you need to install it from github . 
 Since I use it for a quite few time and satisfied with it now. I hope if anybody would find it useful and give some advices.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I edit typescript files with eglot active, it resets indent-tabs-mode and inserts tabs. I can toggle indent-tabs-mode to go back to spaces, but I'd like to leave it set the way I like. I'm trying to follow the instructions for eglot-workspace-configuration in the eglot manual, but it's not working.
 I've tried creating a .dir.local.el file to set preferences for "typescript-language-server" (see below), but eglot-show-workspace-configuration shows nil, so I don't think these are being found.
 The kap/eglot-current-server command I've written (see below) confirms that I'm running "(typescript-language-server --stdio)".
 (use-package eglot :hook ((js-ts-mode . eglot-ensure) (tsx-ts-mode . eglot-ensure) (typescript-ts-mode . eglot-ensure)) :custom (eglot-stay-out-of indent-tabs-mode) ;; (This didn't work) :bind (:map eglot-mode-map)) (defun kap/eglot-current-server () (interactive) (message "%s" (process-command (jsonrpc--process (eglot-current-server))))) 
 And .dir.local.el looks like this:
 ((nil . ((eglot-workspace-configuration . (:typescript-language-server (:typescript.format.convertTabsToSpaces nil) (:javascript.format.convertTabsToSpaces nil)))))) 
 The root problem is the insistence of eglot and/or the lsp server on tabs rather than spaces.
 But the bigger issue I'd like is how to get configuration into the lsp server. Has anyone got .dir.local.el configuration to work for the "typescript-language-server"?

 I am learning algebraic-data-types in Haskell, and I ran into a problem I cannot solve.
 So I want to enter a list of groceries, and as an output I should get the total price.
 ​
 For now, I have the types:
 data Item = A | B | C deriving (Eq, Show) data List = Empty | Add Item List 
 ​
 and I have the groceries list:
 list1 = A `Add` (B `Add` Empty) 
 ​
 I have a function (That sets the prices of the items):
 p:: Item -> Int p A = 2 p B = 4 p C = 5 
 ​
 And now here is where I have a difficulty.
 I want to apply the function "p" to my list1. But I am not sure how.
 ​
 Here is my current code:
 price:: (Item -> Int) -> List a -> Int price p (Add x xs) | x == A = A + price xs | x == B = B + price xs | x == C = C + price xs | otherwise = 0 
 I also tried this.
 price:: (Item -> Int) -> List a -> Int price p (Add x xs) = x + price xs

I've tried deleting the png, closing the file, and going from org to fundamental and back again but nothing fixes it. Meanwhile, the png file gets updated on disc every time I run the block.
 Any advice/thoughts?

 I'm trying to implement preOrder (First, the root is considered, then recursively the left and then the right subtree) and levelOrder (The nodes are viewed in ascending depth from left to right.)

 Error (use-package): Cannot load helm-config
 And in the top of the *Messages* buffer I see:
 Error loading autoloads: (void-function helm-make-source)
 I see in the helm GitHub repo history that helm-config has been removed (like 3 days ago). What is the correct way to install and configure helm now, using use-package? Below is my config for helm:
 (use-package helm :ensure t :bind (("M-x" . helm-M-x) ("C-x C-f" . helm-find-files) ("C-x C-b" . helm-buffers-list) ("M-s o" . helm-occur) ("M-s i" . helm-imenu) ("M-s I" . helm-imenu-in-all-buffers) ("M-s m" . helm-mini) ("M-s b" . helm-bookmarks)) :config (use-package helm-config) (setq helm-split-window-inside-p t) (setq helm-use-frame-when-more-than-two-windows nil) (setq imenu-max-item-length 120) (setq helm-buffer-max-length nil) (helm-mode 1) (helm-autoresize-mode 1)) 
 If I remove the (use-package helm-config) part the warning disappears but the error in the *Messages* buffer remains, all seems to work though.
 In the commit removing helm-config it is replaced with helm-autoloads. Should I replace helm-config with helm-autoloads in my use-package statement? I tried, and it seems to work equally bad or well with the error still in the top of the *Messages* buffer.

 That was run on an eshell session, emacs 28.1 (built myself from source with default options) started with --no-init-file option.
 There's something I'm doing wrong ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is not exactly about Zettelkasten and knowledge work. But since music is part of the work environment, this might be interesting to you. This is a note that I took yesterday (translated by DeepL):

  
Good music is made to give us strength. Old war music, a lot of video game music, some movie music.
Other music is made for us to give it power. Pop music is made to be about itself. It's all about itself. It wants us to focus our attention on it.
Listen to good music!
Music is part of the cultural environment of us humans. It is the most primal form of cultural transmission of meaning. It is (without singing) meaning in its purest form: Harmony through form in form in form.


I have no study to provide evidence for my thesis. However, my n=1 is very positive. I, personally, like to listen to traditional war music. Now, that I started my cold adaptation (cold shower + shiver walks aftwards (walking in cold with few clothes on)) I feel like nordic war music is appropriate.
But gaming music is my personal favorite. For people, that don't like to listen to music at all: Ambience sounds like campfire sounds, thunder and rain etc. are also power giving.
I like this more than binaural sounds. And my old Celtic/Germanic/Rus genes seem to like it, too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am a big fan of alpahapapa's org-super-agenda for my GTD dashboard (tho need to update it for org-ql). However, I have this weird thing that happens with my config that I've been unable to figure out: 
 It will only ever trigger once - switching to any query or custom view and then trying to get the org-super-agenda view back gives me the default org-agenda view. I actually have to exit emacs and relaunch in order to get the org-super-agenda view back. This has recently become more problematic since I'm using org-agenda-custom-commands for a Resonance Cal, Blog Queue, and Experiments list.
 Can anyone think of a reason that would occur or what I may have done wrong in my config below? 
 elisp (use-package org-super-agenda :straight t :after org :defer t :config (let ((org-agenda-custom-commands '(("u" "Super view" ((agenda "" ( (org-agenda-span 1) (org-super-agenda-groups '( (:name "Today" :tag ("bday" "ann" "hols" "cal" "today") :time-grid t :todo ("WIP") :deadline today :scheduled today) (:name "Overdue" :deadline past) (:name "Reschedule" :scheduled past) (:name "Perso" :tag "perso") (:name "Due Soon" :deadline future :scheduled future ) )))) (tags (concat "w" (format-time-string "%V")) ((org-agenda-overriding-header (concat "--\nToDos Week " (format-time-string "%V"))) (org-super-agenda-groups '((:discard (:deadline t)) (:discard (:scheduled t)) (:discard (:todo ("DONE"))) (:name "Ticklers" :tag "someday") (:name "Perso" :and (:tag "perso" :not (:tag "someday"))) (:name "UH" :and (:tag "uh" :not (:tag "someday"))) ;; (:name "Neo" ;; :and (:tag "neo" :not (:tag "someday"))) (:name "Ping" :tag "crm") )))) ))))) (org-agenda nil "u")) ) 
 If you're interested in how this helps me GTD and keep in touch with folks an old post (which desperately needs revistsing and re-writing now I use org-roam and have dropped some of the libraries mentioned) is here:

 I was wondering if anyone can help me with the issue below. I'm trying to process org-mode table using elisp as shown below. It seems that org would think my data is of INT type and lose the leading zeros, but in fact it is of TEXT type. How do I make org treat my data as TEXT instead of number? I cannot simply add leading zeros after processing, as the number of zeros is uncertain.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi guys! I want to use different input methods for different evil modes in emacs. To be more specific, I use colemak for English input (and basically everything else inside emacs), but qwerty for Chinese input. 
 As I've been exploring, I found several possible ways of implementing this: letting fcitx handle the input methods and interface with it using `fcitx.el`, or let emacs handle everything and use `pyim` for Chinese input. 
 I feel like both methods are bad. For fcitx, I'm not sure if the package could change fcitx state as buffers, major/minor modes change. Even it is possible, I suspect that it will be a huge hacking work (I'm a noob with elisp). For the native input methods, I'm not sure how to make the system input methods ignore emacs. Also, letting emacs handle its own inputs seems... inelegant.
 Do you have any good solutions for inputting Chinese in emacs, with colemak as the default English input? Any help would be appreciated!

to build projects. Reading documentation and playing around with codelab
exercises is a great way to get started, but when learning a new
technology there comes a point where you have to start applying it for real to
make further progress. To this end I decided to migrate an old hobby project of
mine to use Bazel. This post describes my experience and I hope serves as a
useful example for others.
Bazel is a fantastic build system which by itself provides many
benefits. However dependency management could be
considered an area of weakness for it. This is understandable given its
monorepo origins at Google but when not working in a monorepo, what
is the best way to provide the dependencies a project needs?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently I've been developing a package for my own use to give suggestions while typing. While there are packages that do this, I couldn't find any that were aimed at my use case exactly.
 That is, to suggest something useful while typing based on the current context.
 At the moment I have this setup so there are multiple back-ends which can be enabled at once based on the current context, this way I can have different suggestions based on what I'm working on so:
  
When typing in code, suggest using code completion or dabbrev.
 When typing in comments, suggest using statistical word prediction, falling back to dabbrev.
  
I've been interested in how good word prediction can be, at the moment I'm using N-gram's generated by code-comments of the project I'm working on as input as well as every commit message, the user-manual and some NLTK texts as well. So far it's quite nice but doesn't feel like a game-changer and might need some tweaking to improve it's behavior.
 While I'm aware other auto-completion frameworks might support this functionality, I find it useful to separate blocking completion from this kind of suggestion generation.
 Is anyone doing something similar in Emacs already, any comments?
  
This is the repository if anyone is interested although this isn't yet documented and internals may change.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With normal parser combinators, running the parsers normally gives you something along the lines of Either ParserError a. This prevents laziness as you need pattern match on this to use it and doing so will force evaluation on whether or not the parse resulted in an error.
 Are there any parser combinators that are lazy instead, letting you use partial parses and using imprecise exceptions for parser errors?
 Here's some (old) code where I play around with this:
 {-# LANGUAGE DeriveFunctor #-} {-# LANGUAGE LambdaCase #-} module Parse where import Control.Applicative import Control.Monad import Data.Char data Status = Empty | Pure | Parse deriving (Show) data Result a = Parsed { value :: a, remaining :: String, status :: Status } deriving (Functor, Show) newtype Parser a = Parser {runParser :: String -> Result a} deriving (Functor) instance Applicative Parser where pure = return (<*>) = ap instance Monad Parser where return x = Parser $ \str -> Parsed x str Pure Parser p >>= f = Parser $ \str -> case p str of Parsed a str Pure -> runParser (f a) str Parsed _ str Empty -> Parsed (error "parse error") str Empty Parsed a str Parse -> case runParser (f a) str of ~(Parsed b str _) -> Parsed b str Parse instance Alternative Parser where empty = Parser $ \str -> Parsed (error "parse error") str Empty Parser p <|> Parser q = Parser $ \str -> case p str of Parsed _ _ Empty -> q str result -> result satify :: (Char -> Bool) -> Parser Char satify f = Parser $ \case c : s | f c -> Parsed c s Parse str -> Parsed (error "parse error") str Empty number :: Parser Char number = satify isDigit test :: Char test = head $ value $ runParser (many number) ('1' : '2' : '3' : undefined)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The great goodness of Emacs has tainted how I feel about my shell. I use Vertico+Marginalia+Consult+Orderless, and life feels awesome inside of Emacs. I go back to my pretty vanilla zsh shell and feel that it's a little… lacking.
 I understand zsh's completion system is quite configurable. I'd love it if I could make completion inside of zsh feel more like how it behaves in Emacs. In particular:
  
When I hit tab to complete something, I want to be able to hit the down key to start cycling through the candidates.
 When I find the candidate I want, tab should fill it in instead of moving to the next candidate.
 If I'm completing a path, after hitting tab whilst completing a directory, I should immediately see the contents of that directory, which I can then pick the file I want and hit tab again.
 Fuzzy completion ala Orderless would be awesome: hitting space during completion acts as a pattern separator.
  
Does anyone have enough zsh-fu to know how to get something like what I described in the shell? I would prefer to do everything with configuration (i.e. no packages) but that's secondary to getting the behavior that I want.
 Thanks in advance. :)

 Do you link between your org files?

 During Haskell eXchange Novice Track I did a talk about Semigroup, Monoid, Foldable and Traversable. This talk is for beginners that are familiar with basic Haskell syntax. Enjoy :)
 —
 "In this session you will learn about three heroes: Monoid (and its side-kick Semigroup), Foldable and Traversable. Three amazing type-classes, each providing a set of astonishing powers, making your daily programming routines easy as pie.
 During the talk we will encounter numerous villains (a.k.a programming riddles). Though the baddies look tough at the first glance, we will quickly learn that with the help of our protagonists, defeating those villains is a child's play. Are you ready to meet our heroes and master their powers?
 The talk is appropriate for Haskell beginners. We assume familiarity with basic Haskell syntax (functions, data types, typeclasses)."

 Over the last month or so, I've started publishing them to Maven Central to make them more accessible to others, especially now scala-cli supports Scala.js very well. 
 0.3-M4 is on Maven Central now.
 Veautiful is a Scala.js front end I wrote originally in 2017 and have used for writing interactive learning materials since then. 
 Doctacular is a simple set of classes (e.g. router and handling for basic content types, site layout, and table of contents) that make it easy for me to write interactive learning materials. Doctactular is ironically under-documented, but these are some of the sites built with it (albeit several of these are still running on the previous version):
  
Thinking about Programming, a CS0-style resource with programmable games (turtle, lava maze, rescue line, microrat, lunar lander)
 Circuits Up, mostly interactive visualisations of simple circuitry and digital logic
 The Adventures of Will Scala, my Scala course
 Supercollaborative, essentially, second year undergrad software engineering
 My ASCILITE 2022 talk on lightweight course mapping 
  
0.3-M5 will follow soon. (As will another of these posts announcing it.) 0.3-M5 will focus on improving the docs for Doctacular.

 It's completely unusable to the point where I'm just giving up on lsp in vue for now so I can get some work done.
 LSP mode is fine otherwise in plain typescript files.
 Has anyone had the same experience? Not looking for solutions neccassirily, just wondering if it's worth it for me to debug further, whether it's even possible to have a pleasant experience with volar right now.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm interested in virtual formatting of code, that is that the code doesn't contain (almost) any formatting, and the editor parses the code and lays it out according to its structure and some layout rules.
 You can read more about virtual formatting on the site of XMLQuire.
 Virtual formatting isn't that the editor parses the code and formats it by inserting whitespace; the text is not modified, it's just laid out on the screen to reflect its structure.
 How could that be achieved in Emacs? I didn't find any editor capable of that for multiple languages, and Emacs has surprised me multiple times with what is possible in it, so I have hope that it is possible in Emacs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently joined a company that publishes a library compatible for Scala 2.12. I've been trying to find guidance about Scala 2.12 and 2.13 for library maintainers. I found this for Scala 3: https://www.scala-lang.org/blog/2022/08/17/long-term-compatibility-plans.html and it's very helpful. Is there anything similar for 2.12/2.13? 
 A few things I'm trying to understand:
  
It seems 2.12 and 2.13 are being supported concurrently. What is the reason for this? Is there any public guidance for how long 2.12 or 2.13 will be supported? 
 Generally speaking, can a Scala 2.12 project be compiled to Scala 2.13?
 Given the latest release is now 3.2, is support for 2.13 worthwhile? (Subjective I know but curious what the community's sentiment is regarding 2.13).
  
Any additional thoughts that might be helpful for someone in my position and new to the Scala ecosystem would be greatly appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My question:
 I want to separate my code logic from Scala Future. After searching and reading some articles, I'm not sure what's recommendation to achieve this?
 Background:
 I have a project where it heavily depends on Future for operations. I have no problem with that. However, when writing the code, I want to be able to, for instance, test my logic instead of testing against Future. Also I know there exist libraries like ZIO, cats-effects, Monix, and Fs2. I may use it in the future. Before that happens, I don't want to choose one or the others too early. Then I found some articles talking about tagless final; but there are also some caveats regarding to applying tagless final such as complexity.
 ​
 Any advice that I can apply for decoupling my code's business logic from Future in a simpler way? Would simply provide a thunk (method or function) do the trick? For example, `Future { myFunc() }` - but with this it looks like the next step or function that handles this still couples with Future object. I appreciate any advice. Many thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I'm new in FS2, and looks like I need some help by getting some entry points or tips on how to implement it by using FS2 next system with the next sub-systems:
 subsystem A: (many instances) just some constant network consumer (one to each peer) with some logic, the result shall be put into some shared storage; also, that subsystem shall send information about of "quality" of consumed data to subsystem C.
 subsystem B: (one instance), consume data from subsystems A send consumed and transformed data to some external subsystem, send information about of "quality" of consumed data to subsystem C
 subsystem C: (one instance) open/close network connection, based on data "quality" information received from A/B.
 ​
 I easily understand how to implement a such system by using Akka actors/messages (every subsystem is just an actor with appropriate messages). But How it could be implemented on FS2? Making every subsystem as a stream is fitting very well, but I'm stuck on how to make such interactions and communications between subsystems. Of course, I could "emulate" actors (for example https://www.signifytechnology.com/blog/2019/10/replacing-akka-actors-with-cats-effect-and-fs2-by-viktor-lovgren ). Or somehow use reactive streams for it. But maybe I just missing something and there is exist a convenient way to do it?

 The problem is as I make new strides on my home config I cannot easily mirror the setup at work. On top of that I am also working on going all-in on org mode across my devices. I can figure out the org file syncing with syncthing no problem but as I develop my org setup I don't want to be having disparate versions of my config. 
 Are there any guides or walkthroughs on this type of thing? I know I"ll probably need to figure several things out based on my specific setup but figure there might be something out there like resolving moving between the ~/ and C:/ locations and any other issues I might not realize I'd run into.

 The context is that most editors (including Emacs and vim) have issues when used on non-US keyboards, because stuff is in different places. Many people solve this problem by switching to a US keyboard (which has some other advantages), but I don't really like this solution.
 I can see some challenges for this, like the differences between 104 and 105 key layouts, etc. And this is more from a theoretical standpoint....

 I would like to share a subset of my org notes to co-workers by exporting them in html files that are linked together, with one entrypoint which is an org note that I manage to keep up to date with the project state. But I have hundreds of org notes, all in the same directory, so I can't juste use the org-publish :recursive t option.
 What I would like is an option to specify one (or many) org-files to be included and then that the export process follow all links inside the given files (currently org-roam links) and try to included those linked files too.
 Is something like this already exist ? (I've search but not found anything relevant to my need) And if not, what should be my firsts steps to make it work as I wish (I'm fairly new to org publish process).
 Thanks !

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[(I was so proud working up an org init file to share with everyone, I've been starting at the beginning and everything was going great, and this morning I wake up to a strange glitch after working on the plane...)
 ​
 Warning (initialization): An error occurred while loading ‘/Users/me/.emacs.d/init.el’: : Please save the current buffer to a file 
 And if I do a load-file manually then the same error occurs. But if I load the init.el into a buffer, do nothing else but load-file then it all works. As does eval-buffer and the other manual ways to run it. So load-file init.el nothing, C-x C-f init.el, load-file init.el works. It works both from ~/ and from /Users/... --debug-init does nothing, and my
 (message "entering init.el") 
 at the top doesn't get hit when it fails. This started when somehow my init.el seemed to be gone (no clue how) -- so I did a revert-file in the buffer to get a copy back (per the message, save the buffer). It's as if emacs is stuck in some state of not knowing the init.el file exists -- but that seems like nonsense.
 ​
 Thanks for any help or troubleshooting. The fact that the opening message and debug-init do nothing makes me think the file isn't even getting seen at startup.

 I personally run my own config and use traditional Emacs bindings. I'm familiar with Doom and Spacemacs, but I'm also wondering if I should just write him a simple conf that's pretty much just vanilla + evil + lsp-mode/eglot and maybe a theme. Are there any must have packages besides evil-mode to get him a familiar editing experience? Thanks!

 Tree sitter brings a whole new level of possibilities that I'd also like to get feedback on. For example, elements of an array could be right aligned. Enhanced Ruby mode currently implements two choices: ```ruby ENH_CONST1 = [ 12, 999, 13, 14, 15 ].freeze
 ENH_CONST2 = [12, 999, 13, 14, 15].freeze  Both of these are aligned along a left edge -- which is fine. But another choice that I've implemented just as a proof of concept is having these right aligned such as:  ruby RIGHT_ALIGNED_CONST1 = [ 12, 999, 13, 14, 15 ].freeze
 RIGHT_ALIGNED_CONST2 = [ 12, 999, 13, 14, 15].freeze ```

I want to share a method of searching for candidates to link ideas in a new note to established ideas that consistently produce high-quality results. This advanced search option is called proximity search. Usually, proximity search has to be implemented at the software level. My main goal is to share this idea with you.
I love making lists, so you'll have to suffer my indulgence.
Background
I use The Archive to host my ZK.
I have 3K+ zettel, but you'll find this tool of use if you have more than a couple hundred.
My notes are all plain text formatted with Markdown.
I use and recommend Keyboard Maestro integrated with python and zsh scripts.
There are other ways to accomplish the same outcomes using other macro and scripting tools.
I'm dividing this demo into three parts.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A goldsmith has chain links of gold, silver, and platinum and can form chains from them.
 The following holds for the chains:
 i) Each chain has a beginning (left side) and an end (right side).
 ii) An empty chain is a chain
 iii) The end of a chain ch1 can be connected to the beginning of a chain ch by a chain link 1.
 We have following data types:
 data Link = G | S | P deriving (Eq, Show)
 data Chain = Empty | Join Chain Link Chain
 Task: We want to implement a function list :: Chain -> [Link] to determine the material sequence from left to right.
 The test chain we created is: chain1 = (Join Empty G (Join Empty G (Join Empty P (Empty))))so the function should give [G,G,P] as a result, when the input is list chain1
 How should the list function look like? We have trouble creating one.
 Thank you very much!

I don't expect anyone to read this word-by-word 
Do you share the feeling that this is overwhelmingly long?
Did you read the book and have a different structure?

 TLDR: How do I configure emacs to have the main-window at the top and ansi-term "/bin/bash" at the bottom on start-up
 Edit: I'm getting this error in debug: Wrong number of arguments: (1 . 2), 0
 Fixed. Apparently other-window requires an argument.

 Here is a new bit of news - I just found out the problem is only under the GUI in a terminal (Qterminal in LXQT) The CLI (non-X) pseudo terminals don't have this issue.
 C-e and C-a actually work but on my other machines and in text-only mode (non-X) on this machine [home] and [end] serve to go to the beginning and end of the line I am on.

 Instead of:
 for { textA <- read(fileA) textB <- read(fileB) _ <- write(fileC, textA + textB) } yield () 
 you can do:
 import zio.direct._ defer { val textA = read(fileA).run val textB = read(fileB).run write(fileC, textA + textB) } 
 I've been giving it a try and have found it's worked better than I expected it to. Metals has no problem inferring the types of any of the channels. (I'm using scala 3)

To allow for better user experience and composability for existing flakes, discoverability of flakes is a necessary feature.
The site search.nixos.org is used to search for packages, options, and flakes. It also provides metadata information such as descriptions, maintainers, and compatible platforms.
Currently, search.nixos.org imports flake metadata through custom nix code that wraps flake evaluations. However, wrapping employs too much memory when used with large repositories such as nixpkgs. This causes a segmentation fault. As currently implemented, search.nixos.org cannot show all flakes.…]]></summary>

 I've been looking around and I can find a lot of documentation on how to get started with emacs. But I still don't understand, what actually is it?
 Vim can be described as a modal terminal text editor.
 But what is emacs?
 As far as I can tell it seems to be much more than just a text editor, right?
 Could you use it as a terminal text editor? Or do I have to use the GUI?
 Apart from editing text what else does it do?
 There seem to be a lot of things you can do with Emacs that you cant do with Vim.
 But is there anything you can do with Vim that you cant do with Emacs?
 For example the modal editing stuff?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I'm fairly new to Haskell and am struggling with how to ensure type safety of my domain model. I'm modelling "Weather Station", which currently looks as follows:
 ```haskell data MeasurementType = Rain | Humidity | Pressure | Temperature | WindStrength | WindAngle | GustStrength | GustAngle
 data Measurement = MeasuredRain (Meter :/ Hour) | MeasuredHumidity (Double) | MeasuredPressure (Pascal) | MeasuredTemperature (Kelvin) | MeasuredWindStrength (Meter :/ Hour) | MeasuredWindAngle (Degree) | MeasuredGustStrength (Meter :/ Hour) | MeasuredGustAngle (Degree) 
 data TimeSeries = TimeSeries { measuredProperty:: MeasurementType, values:: Map UTCTime Measurement }
 data Sensor a = Sensor { identifier :: a, supportedMeasurements :: [Core.MeasurementType] }
 -- each sensor supports different measurement types, ideally it should also be type checked type GetMeasurements a = Sensor a -> TimeRange -> NonEmpty MeasurementType -> IO [TimeSeries] ```
 What I would like to achieve is to ensure TimeSeries measuredProperty match Measurement type. That is, it shouldn't compile when one tries to create time serie of type Rain while putting e.g. MeasuredWindAngle inside.
 The measuredProperty is needed to group time series and e.g. compute an average from each serie type. That is, separate average for Humidity, Rain etc..
 Basically, each weather sensor will return many different measurements, where the measurements can be duplicated among different sensors. Therefore, I'd like to combine all measurements into a single list, group by type and then aggregate.
 Moreover, each sensor has a different set of supported measurements. Ideally, this should be reflected in the type system as well. That is, one shouldn't be able to ask for Pressure where the given sensor only supports [Temperature, Humidity].
 Anyone can give me any clues on how to achieve this?

 I'd say my trajectory of experiencing programming languages was pretty common for a regular CS undergrad. Started off with Java, everything was new, many things felt weird and difficult (because they are), but I accepted them blindly and was happy. Other lectures required me to code in Python, C and C++. The amount of work required for the lectures prevented me from diving deeper into any language than what was required, but they all seemed to be decent with their individual benefits and drawbacks.
 But then came Haskell, it felt like an enlightenment. The mathematical beauty, the expressive type system, the declarative, composable nature …]]></summary>

 Does Emacs have a way of enabling the user of a particular .emacs.d but allow the project or session settings to be separate? Creating doom profiles for each user account does get time consuming.
 I have been able to create some workarounds for such issues, such as this way of setting a separate custom.el file when I run a profile copied to different user accounts on different computers.
 (setq custom-file (format (expand-file-name "%s-%s-cukstom.el" user-emacs-directory) (getenv "USER") (getenv "HOST"))) 
 I have noticed that Emacs has a command-line option --user that allows the usage an .emacs.d belonging to another user which would help avoiding replicating .emacs.d for different user accounts and going through whole doom compilations, but I need something for the particular .emacs.d as well as the project.
 Is there some package that makes such things easier? I already user Chemacs2 to keep the .emacs.d options separate, but this needs to be on a project or directory basis, ie profile + project/working directory

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[[I also posted this question on the Haskell discourse]
 Macs represent 1/3 of development platforms and deployment targets for Haskellers, but I myself haven't used a Mac in about 15 years. I would like to know what it's like to work with Haskell on a Mac.
 I'd like to ask about one aspect of the experience in particular: getting set up. And the specific reason I'm asking about this is that notarizing GHC for Macs is currently on the to-do list.
 Notarization is part of Apple's fight against malware. Codesigning is another. I am still learning how they work and what the consequences are.
 Does the lack of a notarized installable affect you? (Example of missing notarization here.) If so, how? It helps to be specific: Did you get started with GHCUp? Stack? Something else?
 What other pain points exist when you (or your students/classmates/colleagues/bosses) get set up to work with Haskell? What's the biggest pain point?
 I'll have access to a Mac soon, but I don't want to base my effort on one data point. :)
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently switched my config over to the (very!) aesthetically pleasing and nicely usable emacs nano. Already using it as a daily driver and very happy with it UX-wise, though I still have a thing (and a reported bug) keeping it from being near-ideal.
 Math-preview (using the new one with MathJax3), which I rely on heavily on latex when taking notes for astrophysics formulas and, well... math. ¯\(ツ)/¯ Math-preview just gives a blank little box (smaller than formula's expansion) where the formulas should go despite the fact I have it triggered on all pages with formulas via this:
 elisp (use-package math-preview :straight t :custom (math-preview-command "/opt/homebrew/bin/math-preview")) (setq math-preview-scale 1.75) (setq math-preview-tex-marks-inline '(("$$" "$$"))) (setq math-preview-tex-marks '(("\\begin{equation}" "\\end{equation}") ("\\begin{equation*}" "\\end{equation*}") ("$$" "$$") )) (add-hook 'org-mode-hook #'math-preview-all) 
 modification in custom so that it does not trigger on pages talking about money and only explicitly on a double $$ in case people were wondering. As you can probably tell from the preview command I'm on an M1 OSX system and straight as my package manager. This block works in my other config, so unsure if it's related to the fact nano uses fixed width in the main text (whereas I had variable pitch in my other config... or some other factor. Any insights appreciated.).
 I do notice that nano does some implicit (and nice!) rendering of things like CO_2 and sub and superscripts automatically inline typing, but this problem relates directly to complex math formula rendering. 
 Anyone got it working with nano?

 One feature would be to invoke a function that replaces a function call with an intermediate function that takes the named parameters, presenting a dialog where you enter the parameters.
 The idea is not to replace the function itself but use some kind generic function that can do it for any function.
 eg if a function defined as (defun dofunc a b c) it gets replaced by (param-call 'dofunc :a a-param :b b-param c: c-param) and presents a dialog for it.
 Any such thing in the Emacs universe?

 More? means cmd is expecting some additional command (creating multiline statemens). In cmd typying either ( or ^ result in More?, but I don't know what is causing this error in org-babel. Interestingly, if run like this:
 #+begin_src shell :results output :session shell echo "%cd%" echo "hello" #+end_src

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For context, I have written complete bindings to five different C libraries (freetype2, libvorbis, libspng, al, Chipmunk2D) and the question in the title may very well be the last one I have concerning FFI for quite some time. The question originates from the fact that chiphunk strips prefixes, something no other low-level library I've seen does.
 Reasons for stripping prefixes:
  
The module structure was made for this. If there was a convention to be made for writing C bindings, this is the obvious default. Kudos for defining new Bool/Int/Float types, it's refreshing to remember Prelude is a module like any other one;
 Probably saves a few thousand characters per library, plus makes Haddock easier on the eyes;
  
Reasons to keep prefixes:
  
OpenGLRaw did it first and it still holds the gl prefix, same with gl;
 No need to explicitly qualify imports;
 Names stay at 1:1 to the API reference, if one exists;
  
There obviously is no one true answer to this question, I'm merely looking for the public opinion on this. I may well leave everything as is since the libraries work well enough regardless of the actual function names.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Electrical circuits have static topology, there is restricted dynamism through "switch" which i think is transistors. Do electrical circuits have "join" and if so what is it? You'd have to spill water on the circuit or have the ability to rewire itself. But the extent to which it can rewire is pre-determined by whatever was printed on the board.
 What is a higher order function or closure in an electrical circuit? It is a "piece of circuit" that can be joined or not, but the ways in which the join can be activated are constrained, so this is not actually join. Circuits are compiled. Do HOFs compile to "piece of circuit" guarded by switches?
 How would one model a concurrent list comprehension (dynamic cardinality) in a circuit? This should be possible with applicative because the continuation is pre-fabbed and reused, though here we need multiple instances of it. Can a circuit do this or do you need to print the continuation C times to the board, thus constraining the list cardinality by amount of "memory" on the board? Is this the essence of applicative – you do not know how much memory you will need?
 Can we encode dynamism into the frequency domain? A single physical circuit on the board, and multiple input signals multiplexed through the circuit simultaneously?

 The question in the back of my mind is why does a pure inmutable language need garbage collection for (which is an instant disqualify from AAA games an any other real time task I guess and the big selling point of Rust)?
 Variables are scoped to functions and in need of Ref and friends, living inside monads couldn’t they just be destroyed automatically (in a deterministic way) once out of the context?
 I get being lazy has a toll on memory usage, but is that a real limitation nowadays?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I refused to install VS Code in this laptop and default to Emacs for everything. I used vanilla Emacs without many issues for a while, but decided to use Prelude yesterday.
 Oh, it's so nice, but at the same time... I know I can disable guru-mode, plus customize the few things that irk me... but maybe there's a better starter kit?
 My objectives are:
  
No modal editing: I know vim basics, but I don't want a modal editor.
 I work most frequently with Python, Java, and Rust. Prolog, Puppet, Ansible I also do frequently. Wide language support would be nice. I'm a believer of LSP, so I'd like to use LSP.
 I write a lot of AsciiDoc for work. Being able to integrate aspell and Vale would be a big plus (recommended plugin for Vale is https://github.com/tpeacock19/flymake-vale , which is not in MELPA- maybe a straight.el-using starter kit would be helpful? Or perhaps I should just submodule/subtree/subrepo it?)
 Reasonably similar to vanilla Emacs- I don't want to be too lost without my configuration.
 Multi-account email client? I already mbsync two personal accounts (GMail and Yahoo) for backup purposes, might consider handling work email in Emacs too.
 I work significantly on RHEL 8 systems, which ship Emacs 26.1, and also on a RHEL 9 box (27.1).
  
Thoughts, suggestions?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am using Emacs 26.3 on Xubuntu 20.04. I installed pyvenv while installing elpy. But pyvenv is not working with eshell.
 First I created a new virtual environment using pyvenv-create in ~/.virtualenvs/venv then I opened eshell and then ran pyvenv-activate and provided the above virtual environment path. The mode line was also showing something like .virtualenvs near eshell.
 But when I ran which python in eshell then It was showing me the default python directory and not that from virtual environment from the above path.
 I also checked for sys.path in python interactive shell but nothing changed.
 Please suggest me how to fix this or what wrong I did.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I want to run Simulations (like TestSuites) that I can run with sbt test. 
 I found the interface that I need to implement: https://github.com/sbt/test-interface
 As I did not find any documentation, I checked existing Frameworks.
 They had in common to use org.portablescala.reflect.annotation.EnableReflectiveInstantiation to discover Test classes (I think that is my missing point). 
 But this does not work with Scala 3. Does anyone know a Test Framework that uses Scala 3, or better has some instructions on how to implement the sbt interface? 
 Here is my dummy implementation so far. When adding the testFramework to sbt it seems to be picked, but nothing really happens (see printlns - PRINTED vs. NOT PRINTED ): 
 final class SimulationTestFramework extends Framework: val name: String = "CSimulation" val fingerprints: Array[Fingerprint] = Array(SimulationFingerprint) println(s"SimulationTestFramework started") // PRINTED def runner( args: Array[String], remoteArgs: Array[String], testClassLoader: ClassLoader ): SimulationRunner = println("TestRunner started") // NOT PRINTED new SimulationRunner(args, remoteArgs, testClassLoader) end SimulationTestFramework object SimulationFingerprint extends SubclassFingerprint: def superclassName(): String = "camundala.simulation.custom.CustomSimulation" final def isModule() = true final def requireNoArgConstructor() = false println(s"Simulation Fingerprint for ${superclassName()}") // PRINTED final class SimulationRunner( val args: Array[String], val remoteArgs: Array[String], testClassLoader: ClassLoader ) extends Runner: override def tasks(taskDefs: Array[TaskDef]): Array[sbt.testing.Task] = { println("TASKS") // NOT PRINTED Array() } override def done(): String = println("it is done") // NOT PRINTED "ok down" end SimulationRunner

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi. I'm still fairly new to emacs, and usually I'd solve this problem myself, but I am honestly overwhelmed. When I search for emacs customizations, I'm curious how to enable flymake for basic linting, i.e. underlining forgotten semicolons i.e. Now, emacs does behave strangely if I make a syntax error (weird tabs, spacing, etc), which is a decent indicator. However, this doesnt show what the error is. 
 I'm asking because there's like 20 different flymake options in the customization panel.
 I've tried activating flymake-mode, but doesn't seem to do anything when I write bad syntax on purpose for testing.

For example, I figured out how to change fonts, window size and basic foreground/background colors and put those commands into my "init.el" file, so now it looks better (and is more usable for me).
 It would be nice to figure out how to make Emacs use the mouse for basic cut and paste from the clipboard. also, if you are in the command line, it would be great if the up-arrow key would give you command history (is that possible ?). Is there a list somewhere of the top "5" things a new emacs user would want to do to make Emacs more useful/friendly out of the box ? ... and how to do it ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The larger my zettelkasten becomes, the more the built-in search of The Archive does not give a good overview of the search results  in any cases. Especially when I search for keywords which occur in a lot of zettels or that are very short (like e.g. "git") it takes me a while to find the right zettel. Well, compared to Niklas Luhmann it's still ligheting fast, but thats another story. ;-)
Searching is something I do a lot while working with my Zettelkasten. As I said before, title search is the feature I miss the most in The Archive.
On the other hand, I asked myself: would a combined search of title and content not even be better?
To check that out, I made a little Python script that I just pusblished on GitHub (for the first time, by the way – quite exiting!). This is the link:
https://github.com/ralfzosel/zk-smart-search
The installation chapter is quite short – probably too short, if you never used Python before. So if you want to check out my script  (which would make me very happy) and if you have any trouble make it run, I am happy to assist.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am using LSP from within Doom Emacs with evil enabled. 
  
Code actions: When there is only one available code action, lsp-execute-code-action automatically executes the action without asking me to confirm first, this is problematic since often I just want to see what code actions are available on a line, without necessarily executing them. What is the workaround for this?
 
The intellisense messages on the right side of the screen are often truncated due to a lack of space on my screen. How can I view the entire message when this is the case? Surely there's a better way than just flycheck-list-errors since I have to actually visually search where in the list the error/warning corresponding to my current line is. Add further to this fact the ID columns on that interface is often truncated

 (And tangentially related: why does flycheck-list-errors provide a different error list than consult-lsp-diagnostics? I have an example of this which I can produce upon demand.)
 ​
  
When LSP shows some information about what I'm typing in the minibuffer, how can I choose to view that information in full? See the image below. You can even see the "1/3" page label. How do I access those pages? If I press ESC so I can press K, pressing ESC gets rid of the message in the minibuffer and then attempting to press K will simply yield LSP :: No content at point.

next-error / flycheck-next-error does not let you navigate to warnings (despite warnings appearing in the flycheck 'error' list). Is there a command that also lets me navigate to the next/previous warning?
  
​
  
Are there any other LSP usage tips I should know about?

 Found an open source solution such as diagrams.net which can create several kinds of diagrams without installing/tuning additional software for each kind of diagrams. Run the software paste code of your diagram into the form and get new diagram. But such kind of manual work is not emacs way . It would be cool to have org-babel 'transport' to it and result back.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been working on integrating nano into my current setup (which is going nicely). Really like the aesthetic (though it still needs some tweaking). Good use of an hour!
 One really weird thing I encountered which I can't figure out - I'm using nano-modeline (not sure if tthat's relevant - I am *not* using nano-bindings), but whenever I pull up the date picker to insert a date, in my old system, I would abuse S-RightArrow or S-DownArrow to move quickly through the calendars and Return to pick the date. 
 However when I try this with nano's setup, while I get the calendar pop up, a shift Right, Down or Left gets me a [No window right from the selected window] etc type message like it's trying to move to another window or buffer rather than move along the datepicker calendar. Strangely, other keys like M-S-Arrow etc seem to work fine.
 Does anyone know what I've done here or have an idea of what I need to do to restore the default date picking behaviour? (my muscle memory and sanity depend on it).

 Strangely, when I use the following simple block for it:
 elisp (use-package org-modern :straight t :after org ) (add-hook 'org-mode-hook #'org-modern-mode) (add-hook 'org-agenda-finalize-hook #'org-modern-agenda) 
 this causes org-super-agenda (which I heart and abuse regularly) to pitch the following error, which I assume has something to do with org-modern overriding org-agenda or cstom commands somehow. 
 shell Error (use-package): org-super-agenda/:config: Symbol’s function definition is void: org-modern-agenda 
 Any ideas as to what may be going on or how to resolve it? (it is definitely the last hook in the org-modern block that causes the issue as when I comment it out, org-super-agenda triggers normally. 
 thanks! Daryl. PS> Lemme know if you need me to paste up the o-s-a block. Though I feel it's probably not related to it for some reason.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi there,
 I'm having trouble with python mode. Specifically, there's a command `python-check` which runs a code checker on the current buffer. You can specify which checker to run and by default it's `pyflakes`.
 Everything works as expected and the code gets checked. However, if I try to use `flake8`, the encoding is all messed up (from what I understand) and I can't seem to figure out how to fix this.
 You can see the code (lsp works as expected and I do get autocomplete, suggestions, documentation, etc with pyright)
 All good here, lsp works as intented
 Now, if I run `pyflakes`, here is what I get:
 ​
 This is also good, pyflakes works as expected
 Now I run `python-check` (C-c C-v keybinding):
 flake8 instead of pyflakes
 And what I get is this:
 flake8 encoding?
 Which actually works, but my guess is encoding is messed up somewhere and I am not sure where exactly.
 As a side note, running `flake8` in vterm works normally:
 vterm
 I also tried `(set-language-environment)` to UTF-8, but that didn't help.
 Has anyone encountered something like this and resolved it?
 Thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone!
 I am really struggling to get good performances on windows with emacs...
 As far as I understand, windows sub-process and file system is working against emacs way of doing things. Therefore I've read multiple times that switching to WSL makes emacs much more performant. Also using a VM with Unix might help.
 I've tried that and basically have seen 0 improvement, especially with LSP and maggit. I've built emacs from source to be sure that native comp, etc, is enabled.
 Using only the Linux file system (not using /c/...) made emacs a little better but still far from my Linux experience with it :( my config works really well on Linux, so I don't think it is problematic?
 I am using emacs for very different purposes such as: unity c#, c++ dev (sometimes with VS), .Net, org mode, org roam, trump edit, etc... Which makes it hard to live only in the wsl Linux file system as far as I've been able to test (a pain with unity, a pain with VS, a pain with / and \, a pain with crlf and lf, etc...)
 Does anyone have a good way to have a performant emacs on windows please? Does the native window switch on v29 improves anything?
 Emacs is such a good piece of software, it makes me really sad that after battling for months to try to solve the problem, I find myself on the verge to switch editor again because I cannot ditch windows...

 I use Emacs (Spacemacs) as my editor for developing and I could not be happier.
 Started using Org-roam a while and the whole idea works great for me, but tried Obsidian and before I knew, I collected some good (for me) notes. And discovered a few features I would like to replicate but do not know how.
  
A banner with a picture (see picture)
 Colored blockquotes
  
I know I could export it, to html and add some styling but I would like it to be directly on my file w/o exporting.
 Could you give me some advice please?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I cross-reference with RefTeX using reftex-reference (C-c )). It's very convenient as it opens a list of available macros, followed by a type of references, followed by a list of labels to insert. On the other hand, cleveref extends cross-referencing, which add very useful macros and does other things as well.
 Currently, my routine is to press C-c ), insert a standard \ref{}, and then change it to \cref{}.
 I tried to find solutions, which implement Cleveref in RefTeX but there is not many sources; the one I found here on TeX does not seem to work; It does not add anything new to the list.
 I found somewhere else this line: (setq reftex-refstyle "\\cref"). This is OK. RefTeX no longer asks for a macro but go straight to a list of types followed by a list of labels. Then it inserts \cref{...} with a proper string.
 This works but ideally though I would have a proper list of macros available from Cleveref: \cref{}, \Cref{}, \namecref{}, \pagecref{} etc. on top of regular macros.
 Does anyone have or know about a working solution?

 I *believe* this is what caused it googling around and troubleshooting but was curious as to whether anyone had had the same experience and if there was clarity on the path to supporting 29 (cause I often find it's hard to tell when it's safe to upgrade or do a straight-pull =] ).

The keywords should be instructive for the type of task. I have started to distinguish whether an audio-visual input is an interview or a lecture. It is completely irrelevant to me at the action level. I sit down at my computer in both cases and take notes as I watch and listen.
For me personally, it doesn't even make a difference whether I'm listening to a podcast or watching a video. I do both on my computer, because I only listen to both at home with access to my computer. I don't listen to anything on the side while on the road.
Rather, I differentiate by length when assigning keywords: short (<20min) or long (>20min) audio-visual inputs, because I build both differently into my workday.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I'm new to emacs and I built v28.2 on my Pop! OS Linux instance. I'm trying to get my init file to work to set the initial window (frame) size.
 I've created an init.el file in my .emacs.d folder in home (i.e., ~/.emacs.d/init.el), but it doesn't seem to be executed.
 When I start emacs, it looks like this:
 Figure 1. Initial Emacs Window (roughly 900x900)
 What I want is for it to look like this:
 Figure 2. Resized Emacs Window (roughly 2500x1100)
 But it always starts out as Figure 1 and the only way to get it to Figure 2 is if I open my init.el (right-click in Nautilus and select emacs).
 And here is a third view showing my .emacs.d (shown by C-x C-f of ~/.emacs.d), the contents of the init.el file and the value of my user-emacs-directory (which is ~/.emacs.d/):
 Figure 3. .emacs.d folder, init.el file, and user-emacs-directory variable value.
 I've also tried renaming the init.el file as .emacs and putting it my home folder with the same result.
 What am I missing here?
 EDIT: responses based on replies:
  
user-init-file shows "~/.emacs", which, as noted above, I tried along with .emacs.d/init.el without success
 When normally opening emacs, my/set-initial-frame is not defined. If I open the .emacs file from Nautilus, it opens the frame correctly and my/set-initial-frame is defined. If I rename the .emacs file to "foo" and open that from Nautilus, it doesn't set the frame and my/set-initial-frame is not defined.
 No errors in *Messages* buffer
 There is no emacs folder in .config
 initial-frame-alist is always 'nil' (when it works and when it doesn't)
 Not sure if I'm running emacs server, but server-mode variable is 'nil'
  
Note the original .emacs content I found here.
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My new note-taking/zettelkasting mantra is: Create, review, and edit with abandon. Trust that something surprising or magical will happen.

  
I realized that in a few months, let alone years, at this rate most of my time would be spent on the maintenance of memories [notes]. I, as others have found, would be too busy maintaining these memories to use them. 1


What does "use" mean? I can use a note's contents to reignite ideas in me. They can spark new, novel ideas and connections with established knowledge. Some balance between creation, review, and maintenance has to be made in zettelkasting. In that sense, zettelkasting is like dog training. Dog training is hard work, and it is often not fun to train, but the rewards of a well-trained dog show up throughout the day.
Reviewing zettel has been a focus of mine, and I highly recommend it. Looking at notes created yesterday, three weeks ago, six months ago, and last year is a great start. If we develop notes sporadically, we'll probably only have one or two notes to review. Slowly and steadily, we plow through our notes, and in time, we will have reviewed every note multiple times.
I think Minto is confused about how much time it takes to review a couple of notes (if atomic, focus on a single idea) and how a short review over and over builds, reinforces knowledge, and shows not only new connections but whole new ideas.
Is it true that the ideas captured in our notes are not worth reviewing? I suggest the next to capture, the review is the most essential piece in a ZK workflow.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In Scala 2 we used implicits object pattern:
 import acme.Acme import acme.implicits._ 
 In Scala 3 we are supposed to use import given:
 import acme.{Acme, given} 
 However, import given doesn't truly replace the functionality of the pattern:
  
In Scala 2, "extensions" were coded as implicit class, so they were covered by import acme.implicits._
 
In Scala 3 extension is not given. So import given ignores them.
 
 In consequence, the old "implicits object pattern" must be kept alive, for orphaned extensions:
 import acme.{Acme, given} import acme.extensions._ 
 I believe this deficiency may have been overlooked, because non-orphaned (is there a name for it?) extensions don't need explicit imports (which is a great feature BTW).
 Proposed solutions:
 1. Make import recognize extensions as givens, just for the sake of it:
 import acme.{Acme, given} // imports extensions too import acme._ // does not import extensions 
 2. Add another type of import: import extension
 import acme.{Acme, given, extension}

If a zombie cannot move forward because there is a plant in the space it is standing on, the zombie bites the plant and reduces its hit points by 1 and remains on that space. The only exception to this is the Vaulting zombie: if its speed is still 2 , then he jumps over the first plant and moves on, but his speed is reduced to 1.
 Let's define the performZombieActions function, which will perform the aforementioned appropriate action on all zombies in the model. If a zombie reaches the end of the playing field, return Nothing! The function does not have to delete dead plants!

 I'm thinking of learning Scala because I find Java to be very verbose. But my main concern is if I can use it if my teammates are working on a Java project. If I can, does Scala provides a way to interpret Scala code back to java so anyone can read it?

 However, When I trying to learn wasm+go, eglot is output giving me following error:
 main.go 4 error compiler: error while importing syscall/js: build constraints exclude all Go files in /usr/lib/go/src/syscall/js 
 it's probably because of not setting environmental variable, right?. The wasm code compiles with $ GOOS=js GOARCH=wasm go build -o main.wasm. And eglot doesn't know about GOOS=js and GOARCH=wasm yet.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am running GUI Emacs on Arch Linux WSL2 (Vcxsrv X-server). I am noticing a significant slowdown when I full-screen my GUI Emacs. The slowdown is particularly noticeable in input latency. When I type fast, I would have to wait a few seconds for the letters to appear one by one.
 When I shrink down the size of the GUI frame, Emacs becomes very snappy and responsive. I have noticed a positive correlation between Emacs lag and the size of the frame -- this is the weirdest thing I've come across since I started using Emacs years ago. Running no configuration with `emacs -q` is the same thing -- significant latency when the frame is big.
 Has anyone been faced with this issue? I am so bewildered by this but can't find anything related online. At the moment I'm using terminal Emacs as the frame-size vs. latency issue does not exist in the terminal.

 Now as I was looking to `cling`, a c++ interpreter. It is having some funny business too.

 The repeated strings right under the input prompt aren't suppose to be there, under term and terminal.app it all worked fine (i.e. without the repeated gibberish).
 That makes me wonder if it is possible to start a comint process using term or vterm

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Raku programming language hashes name, version, author, and other package metadata and uses the hash as the directory name for a library or a program. Even the names of program resource files are hashed before installing resource files.
 Raku didn't have to hash, but it did because some file systems don't support unicode file names.
 The end result is that it's possible for a raku module repository to host a library written by different authors and for raku programs to import different versions of the same library written by different authors. I think this is almost the most advanced module system.
 I think haskell can do the same by differentiating name, version, and author of a library or a program when installing them onto a system. Then, haskell can install and import multiple versions of a library written by different authors. This can mitigate downsides of dynamic linking.
 If hackage hosted a library written by different authors, then no one has to ask hackage maintainers for taking over an unmaintained library or program.

The catch: These times are not consistent from day to day, as they are related to the length of the day and the time of sunrise and sunset. As such, a simple daily timer doesn't work. Various online services give times for Zmanim, such as this one (New York for an arbitrary example). 
 I'm interested in setting up Emacs to give Zmanim times. I don't know of any package that does this. Is there such a package, and if not, is there a package that can accept timers with offsets or scrape a specific website to provide that information?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I remember from Dan Grossman's Programming Languages course in SML that if you changed anything, you'd have to restart the REPL to make sure you weren't shadowing or clashing with stuff. So for example I load this into a ghci REPL
 fracEquiv a b c = (a * c) / b 
 and I don't want that version anymore, I want my fancier version
 fracEquiv = \a b c -> ((a * c) / b) 
 So I guess my new fracEquiv overwrites the old one. Problem solved(?) But what if I just called it fracEquiv2 and wanted to make the REPL forget about the original fracEquiv ? So in general, is there a way to dump/see what the REPL has and then go in and excise -- or even change -- what's in the running REPL? Or am I just flying blind and having to remember what's in the REPL, overwrite or restart it? So if Haskell doesn't allow this, do you know of any REPL-based languages that do?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone!
 Some time ago, I commented in the Alchemist Resurrection issue, talking about how alchemist.el can be a nice alternative to LSP. 
 BUT, with the news that in the next Emacs version eglot (lsp client) is going to be in the core, I decide to modify alchemist in a different way, enhancing other capabilities and letting eglot do what he best does (which is the functionality of elixir-ls).
 I'm quite relief to know that this lsp server is FROM the community and heavily inspired by the original alchemist-server.
 For now, Apprentice is usable, similar to alchemist.el but with most of the merge requests in place and with some changes:
  
Remove s, f and dash dependencies
 Remove cask as a project manager, using a simple Makefile (I don't have anything against Cask, but I prefer to use my method)
 No alchemist server, this is the main point and all the functionality that was using some of the underlying capabilities are not working (but some of them will be implemented in a different way)
 An optional vterm REPL with IEx
  
My next steps will be to fix some underlying functionality that was quite useful like help and macroexpand. 
 I hope in the future to submit this fork to MELPA (given that alchemist.el is no longer maintained),for now, here is the project:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm having trouble finding how to copy and paste notes from some windows files I have in OneNote vs emacs.
 My org-mode files are in UTF-8 and I am mid process of moving a lot of info at work from OneNote into emacs to try to consolidate a few years worth of notes in OneNote, Joplin, Logsec, Obsidian...
 Anyway, when the bullet points are copied into Emacs, I get \225 characters that are the code for the windows bullet point and I can't save the file without errors into UTF-8 like I do with my other files.
 I saved it as Raw text now to try and use M-x find-file-literally and M-x replace-string but when I type in the code as it looks in emacs, I can't replace '\225' with a dash '-' to convert it to a emacs normal list.
 Am I using the find-file-literally wrong? I can manually change all of the text but I've done that a few times and tried a few things now and I don't know what I need to do to replace the \225, \247, type characters that come over from whatever windows type character they are.
 Also, I am on Windows 10, using emacs 28.2 and doom-emacs.
 Attached are screenshots of what it looks like and what buffer output I get trying to convert all this.

 The solution is to set TERM = dumb, however, I have used setenv process-environment to set TERM to dumb, still inside the inferior julia, ENV["TERM"] is vt50.
 Opening a terminal and type TERM=linux julia, this change is reflected inside the process, i.e. ENV["TERM"] is linux. 
 Is this a case of processes started with comint not respecting TERM environmental variable??
 I am confused about this behaviour.

 I switch between Linux and MacOS specific configs with several blocks like this:
 (defun my-system-type-is-darwin () "Return non-nil if system is darwin-based (Mac OS X)." (string-equal system-type "darwin") ) (when (my-system-type-is-darwin) (global-set-key (kbd "s-/") 'comment-or-uncomment-region-or-line) ) 
 So I've got the different system types fairly easily distinguished.
 Unfortunately, the font sizes that work OK on the main docked macbook with multiple screens don't work well on the undocked/portable macbook.
 Any advice on a robust way to tell which mac I'm using, with a view to the config working on other screen configurations? I was thinking I could just detect a hard-coded "if 3 screens of these dimensions then do X, if 1 screen of those dimensions do Y" but I'm not sure the best way to do that, or even if that is the best way to do what I want.
 Any other tips for sharing a single init.el between multiple computers?
