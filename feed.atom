        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Since installing Emacs 31, I noticed a strange issue: if I try to look at the documentation of pcase, Emacs becomes very, very slow. It takes a few seconds to a) show the result in Vertico and b) open the documentation. Even evaluating (describe-function 'pcase) is extremely slow. I discovered that, for some reason, not loading lsp-mode and related packages improves the issue. I've also tried disabling and sequentially re-enabling packages from my config but couldn't find the culprit. To do that, I tried to put my config in a catch statement (to stop the execution at a certain point), like this:
 (catch 'my-exit ;; I want to execute this (throw 'my-exit "Stop here") ;; I don't want to execute this ) 
 I'm pretty sure that what I did there is probably stupid, but I'm not an Elisp expert. Anyway, after putting all my config in the catch-throw statement (even with the throw as the last line), I couldn't reproduce the bug.
 I initially experienced the (describe-function 'pcase) bug on macOS and thought that this was in some way OS-specific, but I compiled Emacs 31+ on my Linux machine today and the same thing happens.
 At this point, I'm just very curious about what is happening. If someone has a clue, I'd appreciate it!

 I’m curious if anyone in this community knows if it’s possible to setup a ctrl lock key instead of caps lock? 
 My hands don’t do chording too well and begin to hurt overtime. I know there is god mode which I can use to avoid it, but even better in my mind would be to set up a “ctrl lock” in the place of caps lock . That way I don’t have to install a plugin and complicate my .emacs.
 I am curious if anyone has any idea if that can be setup on Linux Xorg?

 It is not rare to have my macbook spinning fans at maximum speed, cpu usage high and battery going down, just because I loaded some file with a 'not yet compiled' dependency.
 Also, a "emacs --native-compile-all-packages" to run in advance in order to reduce this sort of compilations while really using Emacs would be great.
 Is there something we can control about it?

 This lighter color line in the mode line is bugging me. Is it an extra border or is it misplaced?
 I really like Solarized Theme, but this thing keeps me away from it.

 Even if I start it without loading any configuration: /usr/local/opt/emacs-mac/Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS/Emacs -Q, it still takes about 3 seconds for the main window to appear.
 If I start it in the terminal /usr/local/opt/emacs-mac/Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS/Emacs -Q -nw, it takes about 0.8 seconds to show up. This is acceptable.
 I also tested https://emacsformacosx.com/ and got similar results.
 Why does the UI of emacs on Mac take so long to appear? Is there any way to speed it up? 
 For comparison, the UI of VSCode takes about 1 second, and Zed's UI takes about 0.5 seconds to appear.
 My Mac is a MacBook Pro 15-inch, 2019 (2.6 GHz 6-Core Intel Core i7, 32 GB 2400 MHz DDR4).
 Please do not suggest using emacsclient; this post focuses on solving / investigating the initial startup window / UI display speed of emacs-mac.

 When I use Emacs 29, I only used the default theme because it was simple and eased my eyes. I tried other light themes including Modus operandi but it's a little high contrast to my eyes. But with Emacs 30.0.91 the modus-operandi theme is much better. Prot has included a total 8 modus themes on 30.0.91, all other Modus themes also have very good quality.

 Removed the dependency on conda.el in org-zettel-ref-mode.el, and the detection of the Python environment is now entirely handled by convert-to-org.py. 
 Automatically sets up a virtual environment via the python venv command and installs required libraries. 
 Note: After updating to this version, running convert-to-org.py will reinstall third-party libraries. If you prefer a clean environment, you may want to manage this manually.
 
 
 Improved synchronization mechanism for overview files, preventing multiple overview files from being created for the same source file. Also improved the robustness and stability of this feature. 
 A hash table is now used to map source files to overview files. One great thing is that you don’t need to manually set the hash table file location.
 The overview file header now includes a new property block: #+SOURCE-FILE: to confirm the mapping.
 New commands: 
 org-zettel-ref-check-and-repair-links - Check and repair links between source files and overview files.
 org-zettel-ref-maintenance-menu - Display a menu for org-zettel-ref-mode maintenance operations.
 org-zettel-ref-refresh-index - Manually refresh the overview index.
 org-zettel-ref-rescan-overview-files - Rescan the overview directory and update the index.
 org-zettel-ref-status - Display the current status of org-zettel-ref-mode.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am trying to make a minor mode for my keybindings, but some of them don't work. I am trying to make ctrl+c copy, ctrl+shift+c be the prefix key for the modes that need ctrl+c as a prefix key and ctrl+f do incremental forward search and on repeated keypress have it do repeated forward search (like ctrl+s used to, which I rebound to save-buffer). My problems are: 1. Every major and minor mode ignore my ctrl+c bind and treat it as if it were a modifier key. 2. I don't know how to make emacs interpret ctrl+shift+c as the modifier key like cua did. 3. When I try to do incremental search I get the prompt "I-search: [no previous search string]" and when I try to type my search expression it just ignores, removes the prompt and writes my expression into the buffer. All of this happens on the first keystroke.
 Also I have tried to get used to the emacs default bindings and although I know how to use them I find them rather unplesant personally so I can't give up on this.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I thought the most glaring limitations of emacs to date is the fact that any malicious package can potentially gain unfettered access to system files and resources. But macports works by confining 'ported software to a private “sandbox” that keeps it from intermingling with your operating system and its vendor-supplied software to prevent them from becoming corrupted.'
 I am no Emacs expert, but it does appear to work quite well on MacOS via Macports, so my question is whether it really behaves like Emacs does under the hood in this case. And if that is that case, why can't mainstream distributions adopt the same kind of sandboxing mechanisms?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello there Emacsen friends!
 I'm proud to announce auto-dark is growing to version 0.13. Just merged it.
 You may find it here:
  
https://github.com/LionyxML/auto-dark-emacs, or
 https://melpa.org/#/auto-dark (as soon as MELPA builds it)
  
With this version (shouts to sellout for the awesome work!), we are:
 1. Supporting the usage of multiple themes
 Example:
 (use-package emacs
 :custom (custom-enabled-themes '(bringhurst solarized inheritance)))
 (use-package auto-dark
 :init (auto-dark-mode))
 This will make use of various themes at the same time, while auto-dark-mode will also switch the light/dark versions of those themes.
 2. Changing the default way to set light/dark themes
 These variables are now marked as obsolete:
 auto-dark--dark-themes
 auto-dark--light-themes
 The right way to set the light/dark themes is now through:
 (setq auto-dark-themes '((wombat) (leuven)))
 3. Adding example configs on README:
 All examples updated!
 You may find the right way of doing your config on macOS, Linux, Windows, Android and Spacemacs, DoomEmacs, use-package, etc. right there!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Initial Scala Native support: The modules kyo-data, kyo-tag, and kyo-prelude are now cross-compiled to Scala Native 0.5.5.
 Batch: A new effect that provides functionality similar to solutions like Haxl/Stitch/ZIO Query to batch operations. The effect can be safely composed with others without a separate monad!
 kyo-prelude: The kyo-prelude module contains the new kernel of the library and a collection of IO-free effects. It's a quite complete effect system with mutability only to handle stack safety, tracing, and preemption. Other than that, the entire module is pure without any side effects or IO suspensions, including the effect handling mechanism.
 System: Provides access to system properties, environment variables, and OS-related information. A convenience Parse type class is provided to parse configurations.
 Check: A new effect that provides a mechanism similar to assertions but with customizable behavior, allowing the collection of all failures (Check.runChunk), translation to the Abort effect (Check.runAbort), and discarding of any failures (Check.runDiscard).
 Effect-TS-inspired pipe: The pending type now offers pipe methods that allow chaining multiple transformations into a single pipe call.
 ScalaDocs: The majority of Kyo's public APIs now offer ScalaDocs.
 cats-effect integration: The new Cats effect provides integration with cats-effect's IO, allowing conversion of computations between the libraries in both directions.
 New Clock APIs: New convenience APIs to track deadlines and measure elapsed time.
 Barrier: An asynchronous primitive similar to Latch to coordinate the rendezvous of multiple fibers.
 Integration with directories-jvm: The Path companion object now provides methods to obtain common paths based on the directories-jvm library: Path.basePaths, Path.userPaths, Path.projectPaths.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was playing aroung with org-attach features lately, and stumbled upon something that looked weird to me. When using the uuid method to create attachment folders, orgmode uses the first two characters of the uuid to create a first folder, then the rest of the ID to create the actual attachment folder. It fails if using a uuid of less than 2 characters as far as I could test.
 It is not obvious to the eyes, a bit like a phishing site, I noticed it while deleting all attachments on a node, Emacs yes/no prompted me if I wanted to use recursive deletion. I was surprised because I understood that the 'uuid' method was supposed to store attachments in a flat directory structure named after the node's UUID, under the `org-attach-id-dir` directory.
 At first, I thought it was a bug (most probably in my config as always), but I could track down the process to this function in charge to generate the folder name:
 (defun org-attach-id-uuid-folder-format (id) "Translate an UUID ID into a folder-path. Default format for how Org translates ID properties to a path for attachments. Useful if ID is generated with UUID." (and (< 2 (length id)) (format "%s/%s" (substring id 0 2) (substring id 2)))) 
 Looking at this function, the bug theorydoes not stand as it looks very intentional on the developers part. So I am wondering why it was built like that.
 It does not impair the attachment functionalities at all, everything I tested works fine, but first I am curious, and second the way I found out about it bothers me. I wonder if multiple nodes were to share the same first two UUID characters, would they all get their attachment folders deleted by a recursive deletion meant for only one of them ? If yes, I think that would qualify as a bug with data loss on top of that.
 The docstring does not help me understand its purpose any better, so I thought I'd ask.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Running into a weird issue with a recent upgrade. So I upgraded from emacs 26 to emacs 28.1 on Ubuntu. Normally, I operate emacs in terminal mode (emacs --daemon, emacsclient -t) using Terminal.app from MacOSX.
 Problem I'm having is that as of this upgrade, I can no longer paste text into a terminal buffer in char mode. If I cmd-C "hi" and Cmd-v it in a buffer in `term-mode` in character mode, the console just freezes up (i.e. all further keys aren't doing anything, I can't C-x b to get to another buffer, etc.). I have to Ctrl-G to get back control.
 My lossage output looks like
 ESC [ 2 0 0 ~ h i ESC [ 2 0 1 ~
 Which is what I'd generally expect with terminal shenanigans, and lossage confirms that it invokes `term--xterm-paste`. So I tried manually invoking term--xterm-paste and, yep, that freezes up the console too.
 Invoking help on term--xterm-paste doesn't give any obvious hints, and it's a compiled C function so now I'm at a bit of a dead-end. Any suggestions for how to debug this further would be much appreciated!
 ETA: confirmed issue is happening with an `emacs -Q` run and `M-x term` running /bin/bash, so I don't think it's my configuration (at least, not my emacs configuration).

 I'm developing eee.el to launches excellent terminal user interface tools (such as yazi, fzf, lazy-git, etc.) with Emacs asynchronously.
 https://github.com/eval-exec/eee.el
 By combining Emacs with excellent terminal user interface (TUI) applications, I can achieve the following workflow:
  
Emacs asynchronously launches a terminal application (such as wezterm).
 
In wezterm, I run TUI applications defined in eee.el, such as yazi, ripgrep, fzf.
 
In yazi, I search/preview files, and upon pressing Enter, yazi informs Emacs which file to open and where to navigate.
 
Emacs executes a callback to open the target file specified in yazi.
 
 You can see a screen recording example in the GitHub repository mentioned above.
 What TUI applications would you like to see added? What workflows are you interested in? Feel free to raise an issue or submit a pull request, and I will incorporate them when I see them.
 Can you provide me with some suggestions? What tools do you want to see added? What kind of workflows do you prefer?

 title basically says it all. I use emacsclient on the regular, with a systemd-Service starting emacs --daemon. I have been wondering why I can't use dead keys when using emacs while it works just as intended in about every other program. 
 Deciding to test the issue, I started with emacs -Q, gradually adding more configuration to find the culprit -- only that I was unable to find any, because dead keys would work even with my full configuration. On the other hand, I commented out all my configuration and restarted the systemd-service, only to find that even with practically no configuration, dead keys don't work.
 I am puzzled and have no idea how to search for the solution. If you have pointers where I can look to better understand the issue or might even have a solution, I'd be grateful.
 Have a good day, fellows :)

 The linter can detect quite a few bugs and has been tested with unit tests and on a large codebase.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lambda calculus is the theoretical basis for functional programming languages like Ocaml, Haskell, etc. Therefore it is an interesting topic for me.
 Since Church's lambda calculus, Gödel's recursive functions and Turing's automatic machines are equivalent, I was curious to find the analogue of a universal turing machine expressed in lambda calculus. I have found a quite simple universal lambda term which does the job.
 I have documented the construction of a universal lambda term in this paper.
 It gives a short introduction to lambda calculus. Then it introduces a programming notation for lambda calculus similar to Haskell/Ocaml in order to make lambda calculus more readable for functional programmers.
 In this notation some basic functions for booleans, pairs, numbers and optional values are introduced.
 In order to encode lambda terms the usual Gödel numbering has been avoided. Instead of Gödel numbers the basic idea of algebraic data types has been used.
 Based on the structure of an encoded lambda term, a lambda term is constructed which reduces an encoded lambda term to normal form or loops infinitely in case no normal form exists.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are trying to make Copilot easily available on Mac. For those unaware, Copilot is a runtime verification framework written in Haskell. There's no Copilot executable or Copilot compiler as such: Copilot is an EDSL available as a Haskell library, so users still use GHC to compile Copilot modules.
 I assume homebrew is the easiest path, since we cannot add Copilot to Apple's App Store without having to add GHC and Cabal as part of the same package, which would be a sizeable effort.
 I'm struggling to make that happen due to how GHC and cabal create package envs and package DBs. A lot has changed in Cabal and GHC in the last few versions.
 Any help would be really appreciated. A lot of people in aerospace and at NASA use Mac, so this would be really helpful to increase adoption of Copilot.
 If someone more knowledgeable than me can help, you can find a bit more info in this discussion: https://github.com/Copilot-Language/copilot/discussions/537
 Thanks!

 I'm looking for a way to log and track my running training sessions directly in Emacs. I'd like to be able to input and organize the following data for each session:
  
Date
 Resting heart rate for the day
 Average / Max heart rate during the session
 Duration of the session
 Type of session (endurance, resistance, etc.)
 etc.
  
Do you know of any tools, packages, or specific setups within Emacs that would allow me to do this? Any suggestions are welcome!
 Thanks in advance!

But ever since I last updated mu (via homebrew, which I used to install version 1.12.6) I keep encountering this problem: after a while (sometimes a few days, sometimes a few hours), my inbox (in "work/inbox") starts showing up as empty ("No matching messages found") even though the corresponding directory contains plenty of messages. 
 I can fix this by running mu init and then mu index, but it's getting to be quite annoying to have to do this so often. Is anyone else having a similar issue? Any suggestions on what the culprit could be here?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Let's face it: GNU Emacs is old. It was once a complete rewrite of Emacs. However, It was made for a very different world from the world today. I believe it's time for another rewrite. I was brainstorming about some of the features this so-called rewrite needs: 1. Client-Server Architecture: Although Emacs has a client mode, it's not meant to use with a server on another computer. 2. GPU Acceleration: This is the new cool trend. :) 3. Safe Multithreading: While Elisp provides facilities for multithreading, they're practically useless because there is no grantee for a thread to give the process back. 4. Proper GUI Library: And better mouse support. It's also impossible to write good GUI code for Emacs due to threading issues. 5. Image-based: This is also cool. Imagine installing an Emacs distribution just by installing an image. 6. Elisp Support: We need to keep it backwards compatible.
 Please share your thoughts. Thank you.

 Lines starting tsk_ and tskg_ are mixed up when they should be grouped.
 When they are not in the table they are sorted correctly.

 What could be the problem.
 I have tested it in Org 9.3.8 and 9.5.5 on Emacs 28.2 on Linux and the problem is present on both. I will try in another session to find out why. For now I'm stumped.

I want to create some org capture templates specific to my game, but ultimately want to be able to easily swap out the file later on once I move to a new project (or for example, I'm doing a game jam). It's telling me the variable is a stringp and thus the wrong type.
 I've defined a variable for the filepath and am trying to. I'm pretty sure I don't even need '~/org/since /org is my org directory. Here's the variable:  (defvar game-directory "~/org/radiant-bricks.org" "Directory for current game project") `
 Here's the template. I suspect there's more syntax errors, but I can figure those out next.
  after! org (add-to-list 'org-capture-templates '(("g" "Game Dev Todo" entry (file+headline ,game-directory "Tasks") "** TODO %^{Game Function} [/] /n *** TODO %\\1 Art /n *** TODO %\\1 Code /n *** TODO %\\1 VFX /n %?")))) 
 I've done some searching, but haven't really found much beyond trying to use a backquote or potentially a + I see there's a function option, but not sure if I have to go that far just to get the filename.

Behaviour changes on flag day by Tom Ellis
At work (Groq) we recently upgraded the version of GHC that we use from 8.10 to 9.6, along with many of the Haskell packages we depend on. I wrote about the changes to our code that this required in “Upgrading from GHC 8.10 to GHC 9.6 – an experience report”. That article touches on the risks associated with being forced to make many changes at once: if a problem occurs it can be hard to diagnose and it can be hard to fix. After that article was written I discovered that such a problem, albeit a benign one, had occurred. The present article expl…]]></summary>

 My question is twofold: Do you agree the market is getting progressively harder and finding a solid Scala job is more difficult (Europe market here) 
 And for those who have found Scala difficult to work in due to the market, what is your plan? Do you transition to another language? What languages/jobs do you think are a good transition? 
 I have a Scala job now, but everyone around me has been quite worried and it has rubbed off on me.

 Yesterday, we had a guest drop into one of the emacs channels on IRC and he was saying how Emacs should be better at some things (but wouldn't give any concrete examples). It was all a bit stupid and we've all heard this before. But it did get me thinking this morning that I do have some questions about Emacs. Keep in mind that I'm a non-dev and some answers may be obvious to those who are but they aren't to me. 🙃
 1) Why can't we actually get multithreading built into Emacs? I don't really understand why not. Could somebody please explain?
 2) I was looking at iTerm and Kitty (I use them both but rarely). I mostly use vterm in emacs and I was wondering: would it be really hard to get emacs using GPU acceleration? I know that all GPUs are different and Emacs needs to run o…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I don't want to revisit the flame wars about optional braces. I respect people who don't like using braceless syntax but I personally love using it in Scala 3.
 My question is, Is there any scala syntax that allows you to pass multiple parameters to method calls without having to use open and close parantheses? This would be extremely useful in libraries such as the extremely practical lihaoyi's scalatags. For example. Instead of:
  body( div( h1(id:="title", "This is a title"), p("This is a big paragraph of text")` ) ) 
 If there is some syntax which denotes the indented lines are parameters, maybe something like
  body ~ div ~ h1(id := "title", "This is a title") p("This is a big paragraph of text") 
 In this case the ~ indicates that the following indented region is a set of parameters, so we don't even have put commas after each parameter.
 I haven't thought through this completely, so there might be flaws in this approach, but till now I haven't been able to think of big issues except for ~ probably being used in some libraries already.

 Noob here. I'm using the native Emacs app on Windows and experiencing issues with font rendering. Certain letters and numbers appear as squares, which I assume is related to Unicode characters.
 I'm currently using JetBrains Mono, but I've also tried Ubuntu and Fira CodeFont with similar results. Some specific characters aren't rendering correctly, as shown in the image below.
 I initially thought it might be a font support issue, but the same exact setup works fine on my Linux laptop. Any suggestions or troubleshooting tips would be greatly appreciated.

Liquid Haskell (LH), a tool that makes proving that your
Haskell code is correct a piece of cake.
LH lets you write contracts for your functions inside your Haskell code. In other
words, you write pre-conditions (what must be true when you call it)
and post-conditions (what must always be true when you leave the
function). These are then fed
into an SMT solver that proves your code satisfies them! You may have to
write a few lemmas to guide LH, but it makes verification easier than
proving them completely in a proof assistant.

 Before, when I wanted to open a file or dired, I would just press 'C-x C-f' or 'C-x d' and the minibuffer would open with the path of the current buffer from where I have called the 'find file' command. Then if I wanted to navigate to some other directory, I could just press backspace and go about finding the specific file I wanted. Now, with the new emacs I have (I have tried this with snap and it's the same now with ppa), when I enter the minibuffer with 'C-x C-f' and press backspace to go to the parent directories, it no longer deletes the text and gives the message "Text is read only.' A similar problem I faced today was with mu4e, for which the attachment directory was set to 'Downloads' folder. But I wanted to attach a file that was located in another folder, and when I tried to navigate in the minibuffer after calling the attach function 'C-c C-a', I was not able to move outside of the "Downloads folder' and was getting the same message again. What I want is to be able to navigate through all directories in my home folder when I call these functions in any buffer. What is the problem and how do I go about solving it?
 I'd be grateful for some help with this. I don't particularly understand code, and have been using emacs mainly for humanities research, and it has worked well for me. I am on Pop OS 22.04. Thanks!

 I'm trying to make my Scala code available publicly using the sbt-github-packages plugin. I followed the setup instructions and everything seems fine. My package appears on GitHub, and I was able to import and compile it in a test project.
 Here's the output showing the package being recognized:
 $ sbt dependencyTree [info] welcome to sbt 1.10.1 (GraalVM Community Java 22.0.2) ... [info] default:mon-projet_2.13:0.1.0-SNAPSHOT [S] [info] +-blob:quadedgetriangulation_2.13:1.2 [S] [success] Total time: 0 s, completed Sep 11, 2024, 5:33:25 PM 
 However, I'm encountering an issue where sbt (and VSCode Metals) can't resolve any classes or objects from my library. I'm starting to wonder if I'm building the library incorrectly.
 Here's my repo: BlobTrigDelauVoro
 And I'm using this sbt plugin: sbt-github-packages
 Any advice or tips would be greatly appreciated!
 Thanks in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The simple answer to that is the The 5 Monkeys Experiment.
 Political issues about software freedom, expanding Emacs beyond its role as a text editor and unwillingness to link directly with other programs and libraries even if they were GNU programs and libraries are the reason why.
 Emacs was a TUI program when the world began to switch to 50 years ago, and without modules and FFI Elisp utilities and programs were not going to get the graphics UIs that the world began to switch to back then.
 Other than Rust aficionados who develops TUI programs for the masses these days, assuming they are even for the masses?
 Emacs only got modules in 2017 with Emacs 25 and an FFI has been languishing on some Emacs core developer's personal repo for reasons only God knows.
 Modules and FFI are the ladder for pushing Elisp beyond the TUI interfaces of Emacs, and the monkeys got drenched when they tried to use them. Actually they didn't get drenched. They were not given the option at all and got used to not having them.
 The former is here now though having gone for years with them, they are not really missed. 
 Why would folks come up with the Python based Emacs Application Framework or the Javascript based Emacs-NG if the policies had been different years ago?
 Isn't Elisp older than both languages?
 PS. What is the traditional way Emacs uses to connect to external programs called?

 Today's is Avy. I'm trying to follow Karthinks How To Avy. Purely in order to speed up keboard navigation of a large org-file. 
 However, I am struggling to understand one thing, and to debug another. 
  
When I avy-goto-char-timer via M-x all is fine.
 When I use the keybind highlighted in the M-x menu (SPC g s /) then I get as far as SPC g s then the buffer reads "here is not changed!!" - I suspect this is because I'm using someone else's config (Doom).
 With Avy I'd like to search the whole buffer for character patterns - but I can't fathom how to cycle to offscreen options (maybe I'm using Avy wrong and need to isearch instead?)
  
Am I doing this all wrong?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Example implementation: https://hackage.haskell.org/package/recursion-schemes
 I understand it's usefulness from an academic perspective, understanding the similarities between different types of recursive algorithms and their common patterns, but in practice, it just seems kind of... pointless?
 For example with cata, I still have to either write a TypeF by hand or use templatehaskell to generate the boilerplate for me, and what's gained from it seems relatively minimal. Not only is the code longer, it's more confusing to anyone not acquainted with this specific topic. On top of that, the example showing that it automatically inserts the missing fmap seems to be trivially caught by the type checker anyway. So I'm really not seeing what we gain here.
 I'm not not ripping on this particular library or it's author at all, I think it's worthwhile to explore topics like this, but as anything other than a mental exercise I struggle to see what the benefit is in practice. Personally I don't understand what the aversion is to explicit recursion when the algorithm you're writing calls for it. For other complicated ideas born out of Haskell like lenses I can immediately see the utility that outweighs any added complexity. Am I missing something here?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I guess this is a more Emacs developer oriented question than an end user question but I don't think I should bother the developers on the mailing list.
 What is the general mechanism for a graphics program to be created in Emacs:
  
By Emacs interfacing into some graphics library or its graphics drawing system and drawing the window by itself
 
Having the graphical window created by an external app, embedded in an Emacs frame, but controlled by functionality exposed to an Emacs module.
 
By another program creating a window and having Emacs embed it in a frame, and enabling Emacs to manipulate it through some RPC mechanism?
 
 Emacs Application Framework seems to use Option 3, but I'm not so sure.
 1 and 2 are my interest though. Which Emacs packages are examples of these.

 Google recently announced the removal of the “Less Secure Apps” feature. While I can switch to App passwords for my personal Gmail accounts, my school accounts have 2FA disabled, which leaves me without that option.
 Has anyone successfully set up OAuth with OfflineIMAP? If so, could you share your experience, guidelines, settings, or any advice on the process?
 Thanks in advance!

 I have the following lsp mode configuration:

 [Edit: SOLVED The problem was that I had set the flatpak on flathub to use wayland instead of x11 which led that flatpak to open emacs in the terminal]

 I have a file containing all short lines, some of which have a lot of vertical space between them. When I move to the end of such a line, the blue box (in my case) showing the cursor position, suddenly jumps into a rectangle one character wide but about 5 lines high. It's no good deleting this - which then joins the two lines into one - and putting in a new return, as the problem immediately comes back.
 I've never seen this before, and I have no idea either what's causing it, or how I can remove it. Note that when I check the file in a terminal with a standard textfile viewer such as more or less, the file shows as it should, that is, without those large spacings. 
 How can I remove those spacings? Many thanks.

 Spreadsheets = Excel or google sheets, its faster and supports better formulas.
 Time tracking = Toggl Track
 Task management = todoist, its better on mobile.
 Note taking = Obsidian (better mobile app)
 what's the appeal with everything being in one app?

 `debug-on-error` does not start thh debugger, and I always get a 'wrong type argument stringp' message. This message is the reason why I experimented passing the ID in different ways. The three variations above have the same behavior:
  
The capture buffer does not pop up
 
The correct entry matching provided ID is found,
 
"* TODO %?" is litterally inserted under it.
 
 I would expect this template to behave like all other templates where I use "%?", which is popping up the capture buffer with the cursor where "%?" is, let me edit the entry, then insert it after I hit `C-c C-c`.
 What am I missing here ?
 Thanks for your time.

 If you don't know what it is:
 A simple, fast, asynchronous, customizable display, highlight all lines with the same commit information, view of git blame commit in Emacs.
 I think git blame is most useful in four ways:
  
author
 date
 time
 commit
  
So I extracted them and let the user choose how to display them.
 Provides global variables to let users choose how to display them:
  
emsg-blame–commit-author
 emsg-blame–commit-date
 emsg-blame–commit-summary
  
Users can use any display frame, such as message, posframe, overlay, popup.

 Suppose I create a .org document and tag some sections as :noexport:. If I understand correctly, those sections will not show up in the exported file, .pdf or .html.
 Suppose I also want to export a file that includes those sections. Rather than deleting each tag one by one, is there a way to globally either delete all :noexport: tags or simply ask the program to ignore those tags? (the latter would be the best for me because I still want to keep those tags for later use)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am currently diving into Org-mode and using it to run more and more aspects of my life. In doing so, I am trying to use Org mode to run my weekly habits checklist.
 It currently looks something like this:
 ****** Self-Care
 Sleep (6+hrs) [x] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [0/0]
 Yoga [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ]
 Exercise [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ]
 Evening routine [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ]
 Journaling [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ]
 The squares and columns correpond to week days. At present I have to manually input the "x" into the square to make it look like a checked check-box. That is inconvenient. What's more, I am also liking the statistics cookies functionality, but I also end up updating it manually.
 Is there a way to get something similar to this visual layout working, where the squares are actual working checkboxes and statistics cookies would update automatically, as they should?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I know that the topic of multi-threaded emacs has come up a lot in the past, with the main objection being that emacs has a ton of global state that would be impossible to make safe.
 However, I have not seen a compelling argument as to why we can't have multi-threaded garbage collection. I saw Julia has recently implemented this (relevant pr), and I struggle to see why something like this would be impossible for emacs.
 It seems that general emacs multi-threading is becoming less of an issue now, as emacs can offload a lot of workloads to asynchronous processes (LSPs, vterms, latemk, git, etc. all running asynchronously). This means that emacs is actually becoming more and more effectively multi-threaded. The downside of all this asynchronicity is that a lot of these programs communicate large amounts of data back to emacs (especially LSPs) creating a lot of garbage.
 Personally, I use gcmh-mode setting gcmh-high-cons-threshold to 10GB in order to avoid triggering the garbage collector often. Occasionally, I will get a 5-10 second freeze when GC is running on the full 10GB. I have CPU support for 20 threads, so I would imagine that multi-threaded GC would reduce the freezes to maybe 1 sec, which is a lot more reasonable.

 Firstly, I don't understand why the repo's releases don't have an actual binary, but whatever, I'm sure they have some reason. 
 However, when I add c-sharp to treesit-language-source-alist and call treesit-install-language-grammar, I get messages that the repo is being cloned and built, but after it's done and has put the binary in ~/.emacs.d/tree-sitter, I get an error about not being able to find the library when I try to enabled csharp-ts-mode. Specifically:
  Warning (treesit): Cannot activate tree-sitter, because language grammar for c-sharp is unavailable (not-found): (libtree-sitter-c-sharp.so libtree-sitter-c-sharp.so.0 libtree-sitter-c-sharp.so.0.0 libtree-sitter-c-sharp.dylib libtree-sitter-c-sharp.dylib.0 libtree-sitter-c-sharp.dylib.0.0) No such file or directory 
 This is really confusing. I can see the file right there.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Several years ago I settled on using stack when having fun coding in Haskell on my Mac. I am now starting to use Replit.com online IDE for Haskell (and a few other languages).
 I have found it to be faster building and running code just using cabal to build and run (all my personal Haskell projects have stack.yml and *.cabal files). Does anyone have any idea why using stack is slowing things down for me? This doesn't make sense to me.
 Given that I already have valid stack.yml and *.cabal files, it only took me a few minutes to get back to using cabal directly.
 It has been a long time since I reviewed using stack vs. not using stack.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m running into a weird issue and could use some advice.
 When I call a function or alias using M-x shell-command,
 I get shell errors that don’t occur when I run the same commands directly in my terminal.
 Here’s what I’m encountering:
 /home/ychaouche/.bashrc_custom: line 267: syntax error near unexpected token `(' /home/ychaouche/.bashrc_custom: line 267: ` +([0-9]))' /home/ychaouche/.bashrc_custom: line 267: syntax error near unexpected token `(' /home/ychaouche/.bashrc_custom: line 267: ` +([0-9]))' Thu Aug 22 09:34 
 The strange part?
 The function or alias still executes correctly,
 and I get the expected output (e.g., the date).
 But these error messages only show up when running the command from Emacs.
 I suspect the culprit might be related to extended globbing (extglob) since I’m using +([0-9])) in my script.
 From what I gathered here[1],
 it looks like enabling extended globbing with shopt -s extglob could solve the problem.
 I tried and added it at the top of my .bashrc_custom file,
 but then emacs freezes entirely when I try to run anything via shell-command,
 until I cancel it with C-g.
 So my question is:
 Where should I set shopt -s extglob so that M-x shell-command picks it up properly?
 Any pointers or best practices would be greatly appreciated!
 Thanks in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I am learning about Haskell exceptions. I read that when catching exceptions, there is no distinction between normal exceptions and asynchronous exceptions. I have written the following code, but it does not seem to work.
 ```hs import Test.Hspec import Control.Exception import Control.Concurrent import Control.Monad
 data MySyncException = MySyncException String
 deriving instance Eq MySyncException deriving instance Show MySyncException instance Exception MySyncException
 data MyAsyncException = MyAsyncException String
 deriving instance Eq MyAsyncException deriving instance Show MyAsyncException instance Exception MyAsyncException
 forkThread :: IO () -> IO ((ThreadId, MVar ())) forkThread action = do var <- newEmptyMVar t <- forkFinally action (_ -> putMVar var ()) pure (t, var)
 spec :: Spec spec = do describe "try" $ do it "catch a sync exception" $ do e <- try @MySyncException $ do void $ throwIO (MySyncException "foo") pure "bar" e shouldBe (Left (MySyncException "foo"))
  it "catch an async exception" $ do (t, var) <- forkThread $ do e <- try @MyAsyncException $ do threadDelay 5_000_000 pure "bar" e `shouldBe` (Left (MyAsyncException "bar")) -- let (Left ex) = e -- void $ throwIO ex -- rethrow throwTo t (MyAsyncException "foo") -- wait for the thread void $ takeMVar var 
 ```
 The throwTo terminates my child thread and the false assertion e shouldBe (Left (MyAsyncException "bar")) does not run.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm happy to announce heftia-effects, a new extensible effects library for Haskell: https://github.com/sayo-hs/heftia.
 This library aims to provide users with predictable behavior when working with higher-order effects. It offers consistent continuation-based semantics similar to those found in the eff library. For reference, see "The effect system semantics zoo."
 One of its notable features is the ability to combine higher-order effects with delimited continuations, which works on a standard GHC.
 Key Features:
  
Continuations & Higher-Order Effects: Effects that require multi-shot delimited continuations, such as NonDet and coroutines, work seamlessly with higher-order effects.
 Purity: Built on a Freer-based system that does not rely on the IO monad, this library avoids the use of unsafePerformIO and similar functions. As a result, it can handle not only monadic but also applicative effectful programs.
  
For an in-depth explanation of how this library works, check out: Higher-Order Effects Done Right: How the Heftia Extensible Effects Library Works - Sayo-hs Blog.

 I give presentations using handouts rather than slides. I wonder if there is any way to create "notes" in ordinary .pdf files similar to notes in Beamer. What I mean is that I can create one single .org file with notes, and I can export to two versions of .pdf files, one without my notes and one with them.
 Thank you for your help!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In this post, I looked for pointers on how to implement a function that can replace any case expression using GHC.Generics. This function will work the same as maybe and either but for any type.
 I managed to replicate either and maybe's behavior, which is promising for the project, but I got stuck on the product type instance. Does anyone know how to properly write it? I'm pretty sure this should be the implementation:
 gCase (x :*: y) = \f -> f (gCase x) (gCase y)
 It makes sense that some function should be provided to combine the two types of the product type, but I couldn't make it type check. I don't know what the types in the instance declaration should be.
 Another problem is that I absolutely wrecked type inference so I have to declare the type of every expression I use. I imagine…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve been playing around with the cooperative threading implementation in Emacs, and noticed that on C-g non-main threads are getting killed (whether or not they’re active).
 This means that normal usage (which, at least for me, often involves invoking C-g to switch what I’m doing) will constantly be killing background threads, either in the middle of important work or while waiting for some event to occur.
 How can we use the Emacs threading implementation in a manner that doesn’t fall prey to this issue?

 I love the Helpful help pages from the 'helpful' package.. However sometimes I just want the more simple default help page. After I have invoked a help/describe- page I would like to be able to easily switch between these two versions of the help page. Either by opening them both and then being able to switch buffers or maybe in some other ingenious way.
 Any suggestion? 😊
 This is the relevant config I have at the moment (some may recognize it from the 'emacs from scratch' series)
 :
 (use-package helpful
 :custom
 (counsel-describe-function-function #'helpful-callable)
 (counsel-describe-variable-functionn #'helpful-variable)
 :bind
 ([remap describe-function] . counsel-describe-function)
 ([remap describe-command] . helpful-command)
 ([remap describe-variable] . counsel-describe-variable)
 ([remap describe-key] . helpful-key)

 I've tried Googling and trying to find other Reddit posts but I'm completely baffled as to why Emacs is not loading my init.el file.
 I've tried making an `.emacs` folder and an `.emacs.d` folder, neither of which is loading my init.el file on startup. I've been creating the folders in `C:\Users\laneb\`
 I've also tried running "(message "%s" (getenv "HOME"))" in the minibuffer which outputs "C:\\Users\\laneb\\AppData\\Roaming" which I thought was its home directory, so I created a `.emacs.d/init.el` file and folder and that doesn't work either.
 At this point I'm completely lost as to what I should try next. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[ChatGPT failed to handle this.
 Can the case expression be replaced with a generic function? The function accepts an ADT value and a function for each of its possible variants, combining all the variants' values to some type.
 My motives are just fun and learning.
 The standard library already has maybe and either for this, but I want one function to work for any ADT.
 In the case of this datatype:
 data MyData = NoArgs | MyInt Int | MyTwoStrings String String 
 It should have type: MyData -> a -> (Int -> a) -> (String -> String -> a) -> a
 So overall, the function should behave like this:
 caseOf Nothing 0 (+3) == 0 caseOf (Just 4) 0 (+3) == 7 caseOf (MyInt 4) 0 (+3) ++ == 7 caseOf (MyTwoStrings "hello" "world") 0 (+3) (++) == "hello world" 
 This stackoverflow answer mentions church encoding and implemented it in a library, but it wouldn't compile for me
 Bonus: have the actual value be the last argument. For the above example, the type should be:
 a -> (Int -> a) -> (String -> String -> a) -> MyData -> a

All the concepts of traits, the functions, pattern matching, etc.. this is all good. But I'm really STRUGGLING with anything related to for comprehensions, either, option, etc... Sometimes I need to do something really simple, like getting a value from the database, do some verifications, and then present to the user. But the code is full of `.eitherT().liftT().left()....`, it's really really hard to understand what is happening.
 Most of the code base that I'm seeing is based on scalaz, but other parts of the stack is on akka/play, and there are a few cats as well.
 Any tips or suggestions on how to get better at this part? Books? Courses?

I am confused on why doesn't `project-remember-projects-under` doesn't have TAB completion. So for example when I want to navigate the path and type in a prefix (e.g. `~/proj...`) and press TAB to complete it (e.g. `~/projects/`), it doesn't happen. But this does happen for example in `C-x C-f` and I assume this should be the case everywhere when I setup Vertico and consult. Another case is the `project-switch-projects` when I want to find a dir to add a new project to the list. I am confused about this and would appreciate some help.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a custom emacs setup that I’m quite fond. I run no code of my own, it’s all just configuring of existing packages. 
 I experience extreme lagginess in some buffers after working in them for some time. My primary major mode is cider (clojure). The buffers are all fairly snappy after a fresh start and then some of them slow down after some time to the point where it could take a second for a cursor move to reflect. If I open the same file in a second buffer then sometimes the cursor is snappy in the second buffer.
 What is the process I must follow to track down the package(s) or config that is causing this lag to build? I’m not really familiar with emacs-lisp beyond basic configuring of init.el. 
 What must I learn, what must I read and what debugging technique should I use?

I have heard that each note should only be about one idea. However, many times I am creating notes that might have multiple sub ideas but I don't feel each sub idea should be separately made a note. For instance, refer to the attached note.

I am discussing two components about the nature of growth - but I typically prefer to put them in a single note only. Would it be more beneficial for me to put the subpoints in separate notes? If so, why?
If you guys were creating the note that I just pasted, how would you create it? Would you make it single or multiple notes? If multiple, what all notes would you make from it?
Thanks!]]></summary>

Given a non-empty floating-point array of even length n, calculate the minimal value produced when iterating n / 2 times, removing both the minimum and maximum each time and combining them [in a way I don't recall].
  
I think in a procedural language we'd all intuitively sort the values and then iterate from the edges to the middle simultaneously. So in C++ you would essentially end up with something like this:
 // pretend I added constexpr, noexcept, assertions, requires, etc. auto min_extreme_comb(auto && range, auto combiner) { using namespace std; // forgive me pls using type = ranges::range_value_t<decltype(range)>; sort(begin(range), end(range)); return transf…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As a clojure programmer with fairly minimal Haskell experience (read LYAH, implemented an algorithm from grad school), I've been going through the lean 4 intro, and it seems pretty cool. It has many (most?) of Haskell's features, while improving on Haskell in its handling of records/structs and namespaces, imho. That's setting aside the obvious new features like dependent types and theorem proving (I have no interest in theorem proving, personally). It also seems to have a lot of interest from corporate research groups, or at least that's what its wikipedia article claims.
 At the same time, it seems to have very little presence online, outside of its zulip chat group. I see basically nothing on reddit, almost nothing on youtube. I get the impression that very few programmers have picked it up independently or converted to it from other languages like haskell. Searching on the haskell subreddit, I see a post from two years ago where people showed a lot of interest, but not much since.
 So I'm curious, is there a reason it isn't getting traction in the developer/fp nerd communities? Does it simply have too small an ecosystem to garner attention, or is there something else?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've got a bit of a frustrating story to share, and I'm hoping maybe some of you can offer some advice.
 For the past months, I've been trying to find a developer to create an open-source multi-language transliteration mode for Emacs. The idea is to have a mode that can transliterate Latin characters into various scripts in real-time. I'm looking to start with Arabic since that's what I'm most familiar with, but the goal is to make it extensible to other languages in the future.
 The project would use Google Input Tools for the transliteration functionality. I thought it would be a cool project that could benefit many Emacs users working with different languages. The initial requirements aren't too complex (or are they? More on that later):
  
Integrate with Google Input Tools API
 Provide real-time transliteration suggestions (starting with Arabic)
 Store common translations for offline use (like a dictionary)
 Allow manual editing of stored translations
 Design the system to be extensible for other languages through config
 Share the project commented and documented
  
I've posted the job on (a major jobs website) and tried to make it sound as approachable as possible. I've even revised the posting a few times to make it clearer and simpler.
 But here's the kicker: I've run into two major problems. First, the developers I've hired often don't seem to properly assess the project before accepting it. I've had three instances where they've abandoned the project shortly after starting. Second, and this is on me, the budget I can offer is abysmal. I'm realizing now that Emacs Lisp is probably not a beginner-friendly language, which makes finding skilled developers even harder, especially given my budget constraints.
 I am no dev but is this project really hard? How much should it cost? And would it be interesting/worth it for the community?
 Thanks for letting me vent a bit.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone,
 I’m trying to use Org Mode in a way that’s similar to how you’d use an R Notebook or Jupyter Notebook. Specifically, I want to export the results of my analysis (including both code and images generated by that code) into a standalone HTML file.
 I’m running into two issues:
 1. Image Embedding: By default, Org Babel’s HTML export functionality includes a link to any images rather than embedding the actual image itself as Base64. This means that if I share the HTML file, the images won’t be displayed unless the image files are also shared. 2. Pandoc Issues: I tried using a package that integrates Pandoc for exporting, but it won’t export the results of my code snippets—it only exports the code itself. This doesn’t just break image exports, it also fails to include things like text and table results from my analysis, which is a significant issue. 
 Neither of these approaches works for me, and I haven’t been able to find a solution that allows for a complete, self-contained HTML file with embedded images and code results.
 My question: Is there a way to export an Org Mode file to HTML with all results (including images) embedded in the file itself? Any tips, solutions, or packages I should check out?
 Thanks in advance for your help!

 rg.el achieves this by propertizing header-line elements with keymaps that call functions that customize the compilation query and recompile: see rg-header.el, specifically rg-header-mouse-action. This works with their major mode, rg-mode, which is defined via define-compilation-mode. This macro wraps define-derived-mode to derive from compilation-mode. I was able to mimic this process and achieve the desired behavior for my header-line.
 The problem comes when I try to add interactivity. If what I'm running requires interaction, I typically call compilation interactively. This makes the compilation buffer use comint-mode and compilation-shell-minor-mode. I couldn't figure out how to get define-compilation-mode to be interactive, so I instead just derived directly from comint-mode and activated compilation-shell-minor-mode. With this I can get interactivity in my major mode.
 However, the left click in the header-line no longer works. The hover help text still works. I imagine what's going on is that comint-mode or some minor mode is overriding the left mouse button. How can I get around this? It seems the recommended way of overriding major/minor mode keybindings is to define your own minor mode, or use bind-key*. But I'm not sure how to apply this to my situation, where I want to apply a keybinding only to some text (in the header-line). I'd appreciate any suggestions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I'm a Haskell beginner, and this apparently minor issue is leaving me completely stumped.
 I used Haskell for a bit on a lubuntu VirtualBox, since it seemed by far the easiest way to setup BLAS and LAPACK needed for the hmatrix library (my PC's operative system is Windows 10). On the virtual machine, I was able to setup my small project with no issues at all, using cabal init.
 Recently, I've managed to set up OpenBLAS and correctly install hmatrix on the host, but when I try to start a completely new project:
 C:\Users\User> mkdir proj
 C:\Users\User> cd proj
 C:\Users\User\proj> cabal init
 after making me choose some set-up options, I'm inevitably hit by this message:
 git: readCreateProcessWithExitCode: does not exist (No such file or directory)
 I tried multiple combinations of options and the result is always the same.
 Every proposed solution to instances of this problem I've seen online doesn't work, and I can't figure out why. I'm definitely missing something very important here, could anybody help?

 data Value = IntV Int | HashV (M.Map H.Hash (Object, Object)) | NullV | BuiltinV ([Object] -> Object) deriving (Eq, Ord) 
 As i use Value as Map value, it has to be instance of Eq and Ord. LSP tells me about standalone deriving, but i have no idea about it.
 I solve it with wrapping BuiltinV function into another data type with string key, which i use for Eq / Ord instances, but is it possible to use it in the way i wrote above?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the past I tried out some Database Libs for one of our projects, but none really catched well. Most were so complicated, that it began to feel like fighting the library instead of fighting SQL. Others had really long compile times.
 In the end I ended up with a small toolset on top of JDBC for Scala 3, called usql: https://github.com/reactivecore/usql
 So what is in there?
  
Interpolation: sql"SELECT INTO Person(id, name) VALUES(${1}, ${"Alice"})".execute()
 These SQL fragments can be freely combined
 Macro-based DAO-Generators for Case Classes
 Dynamic generated extractors for ResultSets / Fillers for PreparedStatements
 Extensible using a small set of Typeclasses (especially DataType)
 Some helpers for writing Joins (not documented yet and a bit unstable)
  
A lot of stuff is not in there:
  
DDL Generation
 ORM
 Dependencies
 Effect system: the main use is in Loom Applications. But it should be possible to wrap it into your own effect system if necessary.
  
The library looks very similar to Magnum, which I was not aware of until late in development.

Getting Started with Nix for Haskell by Abhinav Sarkar
Nix is notoriously hard to get started with. If you are familiar with Haskell, you may have an easier time learning the Nix language, but it is still difficult to figure out the various toolchains and libraries functions needed to put your knowledge of the Nix language to use. There are some frameworks for setting up Haskell projects with Nix, but again, they are hard to understand because of their large feature scopes. So, in this post, I’m going to show a really easy way for you to get started.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have started using org mode in Emacs after a long time using neovim. Almost everything I used in vim has an alternative or even a better option inside emacs... except snippets.
 I like the flexibility of regex snippets in UltiSnips and have tried to recreate this in yasnippet. Most of the things can be customized to emulate such as:
  
having snippet work without the leading space
 making some snippets auto expanding
  
However, I can not find anything about regex context snippets. There is an stack exchange topic about that from a few years back, but even using re-search--backward I cannot recreate the UltiSnips behavior. 
 So what I am trying to achieve?
 I have a snippet when I press the key ;, which:
  
if there are characters before the key it expands to x_{}
 if there are no characters before it (excluding space) it does nothing, so that another snippet, for example ;a can expand to \alpha
  
Most of the issues I have looked at are a few years old. A pull request that would bring that functionality has been abandoned a few years back. 
 I am fairly new to Emacs. Can this be achieved in yasnippet? Is there another plugin, that can achieve similar functionality?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been thinking about a problem that's been bugging me for a while, and I bet some of you can relate.
 We're all drowning in a sea of different file formats. PDFs, EPUBs, HTML, plain text, you name it. Switching between apps for each format is a pain, and it makes building a cohesive knowledge base feel like herding cats.
 Imagine if we could:
  
Open ANY document format directly in Emacs
 Have a consistent interface for all reading materials
 Easily annotate and link between different sources
 Integrate seamlessly with org-mode or org-roam
  
Sounds nice, right?
 I've been working on a tool called `convert-to-org.py` as part of the org-zettel-ref-mode project. It's not a complete solution (yet), but it's a start:
  
Converts various formats to org-mode files
 Runs directly within Emacs
 Preserves document structure
 Plays nice with org-mode and org-roam
  
I Think This Matters:
  
Consistency: All your reading materials in org-mode format
 Annotation: Easy note-taking within converted documents
 Searchability: Emacs' powerful search across all materials
 Integration: Connect reading directly to your knowledge management system
  
And I have some questions:
  
What's your current reading workflow in Emacs?
 What features would your ideal unified reading environment have?

functional programming language. Functional programming isn’t a well-defined
term: it can encompass anything from being vaguely able to pass functions as
arguments and to call them (in that respect, C and JavaScript are functional) to
being a statically typed, pure and immutable language based on the
lambda-calculus, like Haskell.
However, if you ask a random developer, I can guarantee that one aspect will be
mentioned every time: algebraic data types (ADTs) and pattern matching. They are
the bread and butter of typed functional languages. ADTs are relatively easy to
implement (for language maintainers) and easy to use. They’re part of the 20% of
the complexity that makes for 80% of the joy of functional programming.

 if I define a function:
 function main() nothing end 
 and run the command treesit-explore-mode then I get a buffer that displays:
 (function_definition function (signature (call_expression (identifier) (argument_list ()))) \n (identifier) \n end) 
 so I know that the syntax tree is working and I am able to get indentation, but no syntax highlighting what so ever. 
 with the command font-lock-update I get the following error:

However, after marking messages and pressing C-c C-x in the Group buffer, I see "Expiring articles...done", but the emails remain visible in both Gnus and the web interface of Gmail.
 Interestingly, manually expunging messages one by one with B E works perfectly, and the emails are deleted as expected. However, my ideal workflow is to mark certain emails with a single press of E and then batch delete them all at once. Ideally, I’d…]]></summary>

I've been using the Elisp manual's section on examining and changing text properties and while it does provide many functions to do so, none of these changes seem to remain once the file is closed, even if it was saved. Is it possible to save these changes so that they become a permanent part of the buffer and will be redisplayed upon opening the respective file/buffer? I've heard "enriched mode" provides this functionality, but I just wondered if this could be done simply through elisp or some setting configuration?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I'm using tab-bar-mode, and I have tab-bar-format-global in tab-bar-format. This will display global-mode-string to tab-bar.
 ```elisp
 (setq-default tab-bar-format tab-bar-format-menu-bar tab-bar-format-history tab-bar-format-tabs tab-bar-separator tab-bar-format-add-tab tab-bar-separator tab-bar-format-align-right tab-bar-format-global )) ```
 But, in global-mode-string, I have mu4e. the tab-bar erase global-mode-string's menu hover and mouse click action.
 It seems that its related to the "ignore" word. elisp (defun tab-bar-format-global () "Produce display of `global-mode-string' in the tab bar. When `tab-bar-format-global' is added to `tab-bar-format' \(possibly appended after `tab-bar-format-align-right'), then modes that display information on the mode line using `global-mode-string' will display the same text on the tab bar instead." (mapcar (lambda (string) `(global menu-item ,(format-mode-line string) ignore)) global-mode-string)) 
 If I remove tab-bar-format-global from tab-bar-format, the global-mode-string will display on mode-line, and the global-mode-string's mu4e indicator can use mouse to hover and click. I think if put global-mode-string to tab-bar, items in tab-bar should also be mouse hover / mouse click too.
 What do you think? How to quickly hack tab-bar to let global-mode-string accept mouse hover and mouse click in tab-bar?
 Thank you.

Are they same ? or different ?
 I don't understand the structure

 Weirdly enough this happens only with the Java automation test suites and nothing else. Like if I invoke the same API from swagger, postman or any other service it just works. The Java Test Suite is using Java 17 and is also using self signed https certificates. Can anyone help me figure out what maybe going wrong here and what all should I try to fix this?

 I have a list of ~ 2k-5k text chunks, that are each about one or two sentences natural language. I need to review, potentially correct them and then save the results back. I know this is crazy, but if there's one tool that can help me, it must be emacs. I conceptually of need a way to quickly go to the next unreviewed chunk, potentially edit it, mark it as reviewed and go to the next until done. Has anyone ever done something like this? Is there a tool? How would you go about it?

 I don't. I already burned my fingers with adding complexity to emacs that I couldn't handle. That included (among others) package management and as a consequence I try to keep additional packages (as well as configurations) to a minimum.
 What reasons do you have for one or the other?

 GHC Haskell's RTS is written in a mixture of C and Haskell. I believe a worthy goal should be to rewrite all C code (and any other code that isn't memory safe) in a memory-safe language (e.g., Rust).
 The Haskell Foundation should make this a high-priority project, and it should seek funding from national and international agencies to staff it.

This is yet another opportunity to share what you are working on with your friends here on the forum. Add to this discussion by telling us about your zettelkasten journey. Share with us what you're learning. Sharing helps us clarify our goals and visualize our thinking. And sometimes, a conversation sparks a magical moment where we can dive into an idea worth exploring. I'd love to hear more from you.   🫵🏼
Here is my report on why I'm here and my current ZK work themes and ideas:

How can I use AI as a devil's advocate when editing my writing? First, I will write and then ask for a critique as opposed to asking AI to interpret the text I'm studying. I will tell AI to critique my assessment of the text, taking the feedback as advice. Use AI to improve my assessment cap…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to take lecture notes using `org-mode` and `cdlatex-mode`. The problem I meet is when I try to use `Tab` to expand `fr` it doesn't expand correctly.
 `\(fr<Tab>\)` will become `\(\begin{frame}[]\frametitle{}\end{frame}\)` instead of `\(\frac{}{}\)` and there is a warning saying that `Warning (org-element): ‘org-element-at-point’ cannot be used in non-Org buffer #<buffer MatrixComputation.org> (latex-mode)`. 
 I'm using `doom emacs` and only open `org-cdlatex-mode` as a minor mode. How can I fix this problem to make `\(fr<Tab>\)` works properly? 
 By the way, I also want to know how can I make an abbreviation like `fr`, which I can expand it in a latex fragment. I have try `(setq cdlatex-env-alist'(("limit" "\\lim_{?}" nil)))` and `(setq cdlatex-command-alist
 '(("lim" "Insert fraction env" "" cdlatex-environment ("limit") t nil)))` but this seems only works for the abbreviation at the beginning of a line.

Why we have 2 of them? Are both from Haskell community? Whats the standard and quick way to start project? Also, I tried cabal, and to add a dependencies, you have to manually edit the .cabal file, can't you do something like npm i <package> and it changes the package.json for cabal ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm happy to share with everyone that org-zettel-ref-mode has been updated to version 0.3. The main focus of this update has been to improve its compatibility with org-roam. Additionally, the previously provided `convert-to-org.py` script can now be executed directly within Emacs, allowing for document conversion without leaving this productive environment.
 Although these are just two minor main updates, their impact is significant. It reminds me of a saying: "No matter how simple the functionality, the complexity behind it is immeasurable." To ensure compatibility with org-roam, I've changed the working logic of org-zettel-ref-mode from generating a new file and directly overwriting it each time to incremental updates. I've also studied the org-roam API and managed to maintain stable IDs…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The native compilation thing in newer versions of Emacs creates a eln-cache directory under your config dir (unless you move it with startup-redirect-eln-cache).
 For me the directory looks like this:  ~/.emacs.d/eln-cache/29.4-95d1479c/ace-window-a4363797-e4f210e9.eln /aggressive-indent-eaef7fd5-fb4a240b.eln ... /yaml-mode-3ab646e7-6cc0bf46.eln 
 Basically the form seems to be eln-cache/<VERSION>-<HASH-1>/<PACKAGE>-<HASH-2>-<HASH-3>.eln.
 I am assuming these hexadecimal values are hashes, but I suppose they can be anything.
 If they are hashes, what are they hashes of? Can I reproduce these hashes somehow?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[N.b. I mostly write Lisp and Go these days; I've only written toys in Haskell.
  
Naively, "making invalid states unrepresentable" seems like it'd couple you to a single understanding of the problem space, causing issues when your past assumptions are challenged etc. How do you architect things for the long term?
 
What sort of warts appear in older Haskell code bases? How do you handle/prevent them?
 
What "patterns" are common? (Gang of 4 patterns, "clean" code etc. were of course mistakes/bandaids for missing features.) In Lisp, I theoretically believe any recurring pattern should be abstracted away as a macro so there's no real architecture left. What's the Platonic optimal in Haskell?
 
  
I found:
  
Next Level MTL on tools for growing monad transformer stacks: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZPup5Iuaqw
 https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/4srjcc/architecture_patterns_for_larger_haskell_programs/ discusses e.g. memoization (can't) and instrumenting observability, which makes "functional core" imperative monadic shell" tedious(?). I suspect a deeper understanding of monads (e.g. Van Laarhoven free helps (like dependency injection as the code base evolves)
 Granin's Functional Design and Architecture looks interesting

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've recently stumbled upon `magit-diff-visit-file`, which is bound to RET in a magit diff view. When on a removed line, it jumps back to the previous blob containing that line, which is handy, yet it also seems to revert the worktree file to that old blob, even if I have uncommitted changes to that file.
 This happened a couple of times (magit 4.0.0 and 4.1.0), and I could not find any way to revert back to my (uncommitted) worktree file except for copying back the ~ backup file.
 There is a `magit-diff-visit-worktree-file` command, but that one requires the magit status buffer to still show the uncommitted worktree changes, which is no longer the case if closing the status buffer after invoking `magit-diff-visit-file`.
 Does anyone know an option to either (1) revert to the worktree version after `magit-diff-visit-file`, or (2) somehow warn the user before `magit-diff-visit-file` is about to execute?

 The message says error, but I'm pretty sure it's not because bug-hunter skips over it.
 I could be triggering this via (debug-on-message "Package cl").
 I'm not an expert, but I can step through files and use bug-hunter, etc. This has me stumped right now. I want to eliminate or at least identify this last use of CL in my setup. This message will only appear once, during a fresh cold startup. Obviously, the Lisp engine's PC (program counter) knows where this happened, but it doesn't tell me anything useful. Any suggestions from people who debug regularly?

 embark-collect,
 mc-mark-all-in-region, to match the string "ms" (also has a regexp variation)
 rectangle-mark-mode, to select the region in the buffer created by embark-collect
 calc-grab-rectangle, to send the region to calc v R +, as I understand it flattens the list of lists of numbers and them sum the resulting list

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to get org-columns to show a column without the amount of hours clocked in the current week.
 I saw that org-mode has a function (org-clock-sum-today) that it uses for the CLOCKSUM_T special property:
 https://github.com/bzg/org-mode/blob/9183e3c723b812360d1042196416d521db590e9f/lisp/org-colview.el#L894
 I also saw that there's a (org-clock-sum-custom):
 https://github.com/bzg/org-mode/blob/9183e3c723b812360d1042196416d521db590e9f/lisp/org-clock.el#L1951
 So I tried to overwrite the org-columns function in my init.el, adding a new condition for that function like: 
  (when (assoc "CLOCKSUM_W" org-columns-current-fmt-compiled) (org-clock-sum-custom nil 'thisweek)) 
 But it does not fill the CLOCKSUM_W column that I added. Any idea on what I could try?

 Haskell-wise, it seems like https://programming.dev/c/haskell has the most subscribers (see, e.g. this search on lemmy explorer), but is definitely still a ghost town. (And https://programming.dev/c/functional_programming is slightly less than a ghost town.)
 Philosophically, I'm very much in favor of Lemmy, or basically any other more "open" alternative to Reddit. But I get the challenges of hoisting and moving an entire community who all is here for different reasons, have different ideas, etc.
 By the way, people discussed this at length in these two posts a little over a year ago, which makes for good reading:
  
https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/146d3jz/rhaskell_and_the_recent_news_regarding_reddit/
 https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/14dqllb/vote_on_the_future_of_rhaskell/
  
There were plenty of folks in favor of jumping ship (whether to Lemmy or Discourse), but it seems that inertia may have won out, as it often does.
 How are folks feeling these days? Has Discourse filled the gap? Was it simply easier to keep on with Reddit? Anyone out there still pine for a different platform for discussion?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I updated emacs today and reinstalled all packages and magit seems to be broken. When installing normally from melpa I get this error when launching magit-status:
 `` The "git-commit.el" library is no longer distributed as a separate package. It is now distributed as part of themagit' package.
 The git-commit' package now does nothing but display this warning. If it is located earlier on theload-path' than magit' is, then that prevents the proper "git-commit.el" libraries frommagit' from being loaded.
 Please uninstalling git-commit' and then restart Emacs. ``
 So, I go ahead and remove git-commit package with package-delete and after restarting Emacs I get the following on the Messages buffer:
  Unable to activate package ‘magit’. Required package ‘git-commit-4.0.0’ is unavailable 
 Is this some kind of chicken and egg problem? anybody experiencing this?
  
Ok, found the issue!
 The version of magit on nongnu is old, the new version is only on melpa, so, if you have this configuration magit will fail:
  (setq package-archives '(("melpa" . "https://melpa.org/packages/") ("stable" . "https://stable.melpa.org/packages/") ("gnu" . "https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/") ("nongnu" . "https://elpa.nongnu.org/nongnu/"))) (customize-set-variable 'package-archive-priorities '(("gnu" . 99) ("nongnu" . 80) ("stable" . 70) ("melpa" . 0))) 
 If melpa is configured to have a higher priority than nongnu then everything works...

 The files are GUI design text files where items are outlined and nested underneath their parent containers, so if there is change somewhere, all I need is to go the outermost applicable parent and commit all the hunks there automatically.
 Not collapsing could result in large unmodified regions appearing in the display, but I'm happy for them to be shown if it helped keep my bearings within the file.
 It would also help if the line numbers where also displayed instead of the diff line number markers.
 I could also open the original file on the side, possible with diff-hl-mode or some other such plugin to help.

 According to the manual, you can make a "datetree" capture template ((file+olp+datetree "filename" [ "Level 1 heading" ...])), which works great, but I'd like to customise it for my use - I'd like it to align with my university schedule.
 Ideally, I'd like to have one heading per university week (starting at ISO week ~40 for this semester - so I'd like ISO's W40 to be my Week 1), then one sub-heading per day. How would I go about doing this? Is there a way to create my own datetree type, or do I have to write my own capture template function? If I need to do it all myself, are there any guides/examples I can follow?

 In summary, this setup allows you to obtain the full Emacs experience, with deep Android integration (e.g., resizing or navigating using the touchscreen), and leveraging Termux application sharing (i.e., Emacs can access all Termux installed binaries, such as git).
 In my daily usage, I successfully use org-agenda (and org features in general, e.g., refilling), dired, magit, eshell. Even the image viewer is working! My dotfiles are synchronized leveraging Syncthing between my Android phone and my computer, so it's a breeze to configure.
 Did you know it was possible? Does anyone tried it successfully or had troubles?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I just made the switch from Neovim a few weeks ago and I started using u/Nicolas-Rougier's nano-emacs distribution. (Love the distribution btw <3)
 I've also experimented with different model editing systems like meow, evil and god-mode because while I ditched Neovim for Emacs for the features, I still believe the modal editing style is perfect for me. As of now, I'm really happy with god-mode because of its ease of use and its complete integration with the rest of emacs.
 However, I would like to use vim-like keys to edit in text buffers and regular emacs keybinds with god-mode everywhere else, since my entire system (WM, browser, etc.) has been optimized to use vim-like keys.
 In order to achieve this, I am trying to create a minor mode that overrides keybindings in all other modes (I'm not sure this is the best idea).
 So far, I have done something like this, and the commented part has not worked (understandably).
 (use-package god-mode :straight t :config (setq god-exempt-major-modes nil) (setq god-exempt-predicates nil) (define-key global-map (kbd "<escape>") 'god-local-mode) (define-key god-local-mode-map (kbd "i") 'god-local-mode) (god-mode)) (define-key global-map (kbd "C-x r f") 'recentf) (define-key global-map (kbd "C-c c") 'org-capture) (define-key global-map (kbd "C-c a") 'nano-agenda) (define-minor-mode divine-mode nil :global t :group 'nano :lighter " DiVine" :keymap (list (cons (kbd "C-S-h") (kbd "C-h")) (cons (kbd "C-h") (kbd "C-b")) (cons (kbd "C-j") (kbd "C-n")) (cons (kbd "C-k") (kbd "C-p")) (cons (kbd "C-l") (kbd "C-f")))) 
 The thing I'm looking for is the ability to do something like "Make C-j perform whatever function C-n does in the currently active major+minor modes". Also, since C-h is being rebound, I would like to rebind the help prefix key to C-S-h and so on for all the keys that I'm rebinding.
 Is something like this possible?

While I understand that these symbols can affect the sorting order of digital files, I'm curious about their specific usage within the Zettelkasten method, particularly when using apps like The Archive.
My main questions are:
I’d love to hear how others use these symbols or why you might choose not to use them.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all. I have what I hope is a simple issue but it's been really annoying me. I use the arrow keys all the time and, until recently, it was fine. However, sometime in the last several months (maybe a year?) ctl-left and ctl-right don't do anything in my Linux (Centos 7) emacs (29.1 build 2). They don't even show a key has been pressed with ctl-h k. However, chords like shift-ctl-left/right work just fine!
 Note: I access Linux via ETX remote desktop from my Macbook.
 I checked xev and Linux is seeing the keys. I also tried 29.1 (emacsformacosx.com) on my Macbook Pro M1 and it works fine. Any ideas? I'm pretty fuzzy on stuff like xmodmap. Haven't had to mess with that for many years.
 Thanks for any pointer!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been using elfeed and elfeed+org for about 3 years. In that time my feed count has gone from 0 to ~130 but it has been at ~130 for about the last 2 years. Until very recently (last 2-3 weeks), refreshing the feeds was an operation that took maybe 1-2 minutes but it was fine because I continued to be able to use Emacs while the operation was in progress. In the last 2 weeks or so that changed: now when I refresh the feeds Emacs becomes unusable for maybe as long as 3-4 minutes. As in even receiving keyboard input for M-x commands is unreliable. 
 I'm curious if anyone else has seen this behavior? And perhaps has identified a root cause? And a fix?
 Relevant info:
 - I do and have always run emacs-next from guix which currently sits at 30.6.0.
 - I run the latest elfeed and elfeed-org updated approx weekly via straight.el and then, about year ago, via elpaca.
 - I have always run elfeed with the default value for elfeed-use-curl (t).
 - My workstation is fairly beefy: 24 x i5s with lots of RAM. 
 thx
 EDIT: I've recently started running the profiler during elfeed refreshes to see if it might point me in a useful direction. So far, nothing.

It's not far from the beach to the next big settlement. Forum Zettelkasten is written on a big sign at the entrance to the village.
The street is a hive of activity. The people here seem very friendly and open. Small groups have formed on many corners, chatting animatedly. I approached them to listen to some of their conversations. They noticed me and greeted me warmly.
Unfortunately, I don't understand their language. Some words sound familiar, others are completely new to me. Now I'm standing right next to them. The word Zettel is repeated several times - the word I had already read on the big sign. I try to say it in my own language. They don't seem to understand me either.
Luckily I always have a piece of paper and a pencil with me when I'm out and about. I draw a few lines and some symbols. The joy is great. The others also know this way of communicating with strangers.
What does your journey look like? Do you have a map [1]? Where are you travelling from?

I would like to download some class packages such as "turabian-researchpaper" from CTAN and then use them in an org doc which I can then export to LaTeX. I am coming from Rmarkdown, in which this was trivial: just put the class where LaTeX can find it and then call out the class in arbitrary LaTeX code within the .rmd file. However, with Emacs, this does not work.
 I figured out that you have to use an instance of (add-to-list 'org-latex-classes ...) followed by some specifications for that class so that ox-latex can parse it. But I have only found examples of how to add common classes like report or book, not custom classes and downloaded classes. Is there some way to general…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 We're proud to release Helenus for Scala 3!
 Helenus is collection of Scala utilities for Apache Cassandra. Its goal is to make interacting with Cassandra easier, in a type-safe manner, while trying to avoid introducing a complex API.
 Most of the API stays the same as its Scala 2 counterpart, the only notable difference is how typeclasses are derived. Whereas in Scala 2 for a case class we'd do RowMapper[Hotel] in Scala 3 we can do case class Hotel(...) derives RowMapper.
 In future releases we hope to get these APIs much closer by providing similar methods.

 It has been great working on this project with help of the community. I hope this project can attract some new Emacs users.
 Next step is an enhanced second edition and publish a paperback version.

 I like eMacs diff, so I open the file in .c_path and do ediff-buffers so I can review my changes. This requires opening the file, positioning the original file on the left, updated file on the right and then m-x edify-buffers. I have set ediff-split-window-function to split-window-sensibly
 I do this often, so I would love to automate this workflow. I’m not sure how to begin though - any suggestions?

  '(package-archives (quote ( ("gnu" . "http://elpa.gnu.org/packages/") ("melpa" . "http://melpa.org/packages/") ("melpa-stable" . "http://stable.melpa.org/packages/") ) )) 
 Commenting out the "gnu" line seems to make the loading error go away, but then there are tons of packages I can't install, I guess because their dependencies are in the gnu repository.
 This is on "GNU Emacs 28.2 (build 2, x86_64-w64-mingw32) of 2022-09-13".
 Any ideas? Any pointers for where I might look for clues about this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been using evil for a few years but it never really "clicked" and I only ever used the main keybindings. I'm trying out Meow, since hopefully it will be more configurable, and the object-verb structure might be easier for me, and I like that you don't have to define your own separate keybindings for every new package.
 I'm wondering if there are any guides for setting up leader-key and local-leader stuff with meow? I know that keypad mode is great for entering normal keybindings without cords, but I'm wondering how to add special keybindings to keypad mode?
  
Is there a way to have a "local-leader" key, like "," which is the equivalent of doing "C-c", so I can have a separate way to input mode-specific commands?
 How can I bind specific commands to key sequences in keypad/leader mode? e.g. I want "SPC SPC" to be like M-x, "SPC b b" to bring up the buffer menu, "SPC w d" to delete a window, etc. How can I do this kind of specific bindings for local-leader commands? But for everything I haven't defined, I want to default to the usual meow-keypad stuff.
 Are there any configs/packages that are like evil-surround? Or embrace configs for meow?
 Are there any meow configs for LaTeX mode, for e.g. surrounding in commands and such?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I tried to ask this question in a language-agnostic way here, and I'm actually using ReScript (a dialect of OCaml focused on the JavaScript ecosystem). But since the Haskell community probably has more experience with recursion schemes, I'm also asking here.
 In short, I'm writing a multi-stage compiler for a toy language, and I want to simplify folding and transforming my ASTs.
 Recursion schemes are perfect for this, but to use them I need to first "functorialize" my AST type, and then recover the concrete type by wrapping it into Fix. In ReScript syntax it looks like this:
 // "Functorialized" AST to allow recursion schemes inject custom data in place of nodes type exprF<'a> = Id(string) | Int(int) | Call(exprF<'a>, exprF<'a>) // Concrete expression type of arbitrary depth. // We add an extra wrapper to avoid defining it like 'type expr = exprF<expr>', // which would be self-referential and rejected by the compiler. type rec expr = Fix(exprF<expr>) 
 The problem is, of course, that I now need to insert that Fix wrapper everywhere when constructing expressions or pattern-matching on them:
 let testData = Fix(Call( Fix(Id("square")), Fix(Int(5)) ) 
 Is there a way to avoid doing this, or at least automate it? Does it require specific language features, like Haskell's HKTs or OCaml's [@@unboxed]?
 I'd appreciate any thoughts! There is a full example of defining a catamorphism recursion scheme in my linked post.

One feature that's unique to the Shapeless variant is the ability to convert a type to a string. If that's going to be removed, is there a more canonical way to do it in Scala 3? I haven't seen a way to do it with mirrors, but maybe I haven't looked hard enough. Rolling my own solution with macros is of course one somewhat cumbersome possibility.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have something on the order of 120 RSS/atom feeds for blogs, podcasts, YouTube channels. Since I started using Elfeed a few years ago, I've use cURL (i.e. had elfeed-use-curl set to t) as the feed-fetching function, but despite various tweaks (including some suggested here) updating elfeed always took at least 2 minutes, on average something like 4 minutes. And it would be quite resource intensive: CPU usage would jump up and my laptop fans would immediately start whirring.
    
 Recently, I tried to debug an issue relating to a podcast feed that kept failing to update, no matter how long I set elfeed-curl-timeout. I'd get the error (56) Failure in receiving network data. Going to a terminal and manually downloading the feed with cURL worked fine.
    
 I decided to switch elfeed-use-curl to nil to see if something was an issue. And incredibly, I found that the troublesome feed almost instantly updated. Updating all my feeds took a lot longer with much less resource usage.
    
 So ... is there possibly something else going on here, or is cURL less performant than url-retrieve, at least for large numbers of feeds? Can anyone else verify this?

 My use case for it has been to keep track of token positions in buffers and efficiently determine the context for which to provide code intelligence. I needed an efficient data-structure that accommodates for localized "hot" access zones and doesn't use an insane amount of memory.

I spent half the night tweaking my Emacs configuration, digging through documentation, and adjusting settings in hopes of resolving the issue.

 trait Super { val a: Int val b: Boolean val c: Double } case class A extends Super case class B extends Super case class C extends Super case class D extends Super ... object Foo { def foo[T <: Super](bar: T): T } 
 let's assume T is an arbitrary case class with the attributes in Super and I want to be able to mutate those 3 fields in Foo.foo (by creating new instances with the mutated field). Assume I'm not in control of Super (it comes from a 3-rd party lib).
 Is there any way I can use the copy method available in case classes to mutate those 3 attributes? I have read copy is something the scala compiler creates on the fly and it is not really possible to override (doesn't come from Product or anything else). Any reasonable alternative to copy (or any way I can use copy?
 I thought about an implicit class over Super and adding a method to mutate it via copy, but it being a trait it does not have a copy method. I could create a new instance of Super with one or more of the fields mutated (as in new Super {...}), but that would force me to down-cast to one of the child case classes right after.

 It's my first blogpost and I've forgotten that I should probably advertise it a bit. It hasn't gotten much traction, which I find a bit sad considering I couldn't find anything similar; it seems I've actually come up with something new.

 The function runServer is a composition of run, runWriter and runReader -- each of them handles specific Eff request and run handles pure result.
 As you can see in function rdwr, first two expressions are Writer requests, then a Reader request, and then another Writer request. Since the first two requests are Writer request but runWriter is the second handler so this line of function handleRelay

Last week suddenly the completions became unusably slow on Windows. It stutters after every character. Completely unusable. This is now an issue with both Rust and C++ projects. Seems to be independent of the project size, as small projects are just as bad. Everything is fine on Linux.
 I am guessing it is some update, or some silly change in the environment. Anyone have any ideas? I tried updating packages, I upgraded to Emacs 29.4, updating windows. Nothing helped. Any suggestions for fixing this are super appreciated!

 If you ever need to use geographical points (with latitude and longitude) directly as keys you need to start playing some games as coordinates are floats, besides you sometimes want to aggregate with a certain resolution but later you may need a different one.
 I want to use modern libraries, and all the benefits of Scala 3, ergonomic is important too. I love the fact that Latitudes and Longitudes can not be swapped accidentally and all those little things.
 My biggest concern right now is that there many pieces (neotype, squats, Scalaz, even Cats) and maybe this can be simplified using Zio Prelude.
 It can be found here https://github.com/sisamon/geodesy_scala_3
 And this is the beginning of it, if you do not mind taking a look and providing some feedback I will appreciate it!

 https://sake92.github.io/squery/index.html
 How is it different from others?
  
raw SQL with a string interpolator, thin layer above JDBC, no DSLs
 synchronous only, no Future/IO/F[_] stuff
 context function used to propagate connection/transaction
 handling results is name-based unlike some other libraries. So you don't have to do tuples and _1, _2.. easy to make mistakes 
 composition is used for JOINs, so it’s much easier to extract the values
 has some nice helper functions for mapping flat results to structured objects
 
 has a code generator for table rows and CRUD DAOs. Very quick to get started
  
Mostly inspired by https://index.scala-lang.org/jodersky/simplesql and Doobie of course.

 I can do a regex-search for typ[^e] but when I use that, the fourth character is captured, thus a replace C-s M-r Typ[^e] M-% Typ will erroneouly replace typId as Typd (deleting the [I]) as it is captured.
 Without lookahead, behind, what is the Emacs way?

I set up a new machine this week and noticed org mode now has a directory called org-persist, but I can't find any docs telling me whether this should go under source control or not.
 So, does anyone know if I should be storing org-persist in source control?

as well as using remote build execution (RBE) to offload builds to a remote
build farm. Our customers are interested in leveraging RBE to improve developer
experience and reduce continuous integration (CI) run times, giving us an
opportunity to learn all aspects of deploying different RBE solutions. I would
like to share how one can deploy one of them, Buildbarn, and
secure all communications in it.

What is it and why do we care?
We want developers to be productive. Being productive requires spending as
little time as possible waiting for build/test feedback, not having to switch
to a different task while the build is running.

Remote caching
One part of achieving this is to never build the same thing twice. Tools like

 This approach uses extensible types, a design pattern based on higher kinds, and makes it possible to replace any portion of a value of an algebraic datatype with a logic variable. Here's the abstract:

 I can set up key bindings for instances using 
 (leader-key "dtm" '(display-time-mode :which-key "display-time-mode"))
 and this works fine .
 But I am trying to define a function which takes two inputs such as the key-bind and the associated command, and set up the key-bind and assign it to which key. Here is my code 
 (defun my-keybind (kb command)
 (leader-key kb command :which-key (symbol-name command)))
 and want to use
 (my-keybind "dtm" 'display-time-mode)
 But the function is not working, I am not quite sure how to fix it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is probably only relevant to maybe 2 or 3 people, but I figured I'd post here in case it's one of you.
 I recently rediscovered a small major mode that I had written a while back for dealing with PCGen LST files. This is the data format for PCGen, an open source project similar to HeroLab for building TTRPG characters. At the time, I had to input data for some content that wasn't available yet, and I wrote a major mode to make it easier to deal with.
 If anyone is interested, I can pop it up on github to share. It's pretty basic - a little bit of keyword highlighting, custom forward/backward -sexp functions, and setting up sane defaults to deal with essentially a TSV file with very long lines.It could almost certainly be expanded/improved, but it got the job done for me at the time.
 Anyhow, if you're interested, let me know and I'll make it available.

 I am new to Emacs, and I frequently forget keybindings, so I often need to search for them by describing what they do. I use C-h d (apropos-documentation) for this purpose, but I find that searching on Google for specific tasks is usually faster. For example, when I was trying to find the mark-whole-buffer command using keywords like "mark all region," I couldn't find the information I needed. Instead I was getting a big chunk of irrelevant documentation. Am I using the approach incorrectly? 
 I would appreciate hearing about your experience.

I thought it would be possible to have an input mode in emacs that emulate input mode in software like Finale, Sibelius, and so on, but writing LilyPond code. For instance, when in this mode, numbers select the duration, enter enters a note with this duration. Arrows up and down increase or decrease a half tone, etc. What do you think? Anybody interested?

 SOLVED: I just replaced clangd with ccls and it works.

 The default face uses a monospaced font which is the same returned by (frame-parameter nil 'font), so minibuffer messages aren't using either the default face or frame's default one.
 Where is the face for minibuffer messages stored? Thank you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I use org-drill for spaced repetition drilling, and often when doing a review session, during a question I think of something I'd like to follow up on later. Maybe add a new question, or investigate something related, or...whatever. Just some note to do later.
 The drill mode is extremely agressive about capturing all keystrokes, so if it's waiting for the user to hit a key and then ask me how well I did, I really can't do anything else with emacs. And of course I want to make these notes in emacs, and not switch over to some other editor like some kind of barbarian. :)
 Is there any way I can escape or bypass or otherwise allow myself to make notes during a drill session? 
 Ideally, I'd like something where the drill session only "takes over" the relevant buffer, but still allows other windows and for the user to switch to/from the drill buffer/session.
 Then I could have two windows, one with my drill session running, and during the session if I think of a note, I switch to the other buffer, make my note, and switch back and do more drill stuff.
 EDIT: as /u/queyenth points out, just doing e from the drill prompt lets you escape out of the drill prompt. The idea is to edit the question, but you can do off and do whatever you like, and then just do org-drill-resume and it, well, resumes exactly where you left off.
 So, the solution is: when I'm looking at a drill question and my ADHD brain spews a bunch of related things and I need to get them out of my head or I'll forget them:
  
Do e, which org-drill says means "edit" but to me means "escape the very agressive drill prompt".
 
Make notes, play Tetris, deflect cosmic rays to flip bits on my hard drive, etc.
 
Do org-drill-resume.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To my understanding and for my use case, vscode-json-languageserver seems to be the most promising language server.
 According to the link, the language server supports formatting, renaming, completion using JSON Schema. Eglot seems to follow a conservative approach concerning LS features and none seems to work out of the box.
 For example when I open the Eglot menu, Find definitions, find references, Find type definiton all is greyed out.
 If point is on a sympol and I call M-x eglot-rename I am prompted to rename the identifier but after RET I get the error eglot--error: [eglot] Unsupported or ignored LSP capability `:renameProvider'
 I didn't configure Eglot at all. I am also using the gopls LS for Golang development, didn't configure anything either and featuers "just work". Not so for vscode-json-languageserver. Here is my init.el
 Does anyone have a working example how Eglot needs to be configured to use at least a subset of this LS features?

 controlException :: IO () controlException = do ref <- newIORef False r :: Either MyEx () <- E.try ( E.throw MyEx `E.finally` writeIORef ref True) check r ref ghci> controlException Left MyEx GOOD: Finalizer ran

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Holy dromedary. I spent hours trying to figure out why the heck Emacs for some reason would get stuck while I try to go to the next line, forcing me to press the key again and again.
 Ran the profiler a bunch of times, tried disabling modes, opened larger and smaller files, went through the git log, installed different versions of Emacs, switched machines and tried some other things. After two days of frustration, I noticed the problem worsening. As it turns out, a minuscule speck of dust was lodged in my key-well. Blast it! With Emacs, there's almost always some bizarre shit, and the immediate knee-jerk reaction to anything unusual is to assume that it's broken. Emacs is good, and Emacs is never broken (unless when it is 😀).
 Talk about confirmation bias.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Anduril Industries is once again hiring Haskell engineers to work on electromagnetic warfare products. This is a unique opportunity to use Haskell to implement high performance applications in an embedded setting. Anduril has adopted Nix at large and we use IOG's generously maintained Haskell.nix project to build all of our Haskell code and ship it to thousands of customer assets across the globe. If you have Haskell experience and are interested in any of:
  
Software defined radios
 
Digital signal processing
 
Numerical computing
 
FPGAs
 
Linux drivers/systems programming
 
Nix/Nixpkgs/NixOS
 
Dhall
 
 please do drop me a line at [travis@anduril.com](mailto:travis@anduril.com), and please also submit your application to our online portal here: https://job-boards.greenhouse.io/andurilindustries/jobs/4460811007?gh_jid=4460811007
 To tackle a few common questions:
  
Yes, Anduril is an American defense technology company. We build weapons systems for the United States and its allies.
 
This is a _Haskell_ role. It is not a bait and switch. We are writing applications in GHC Haskell, not some homegrown Haskell-like language or some other programming language. That said, knowledge of C, Rust, or Typescript would be a valuable differentiating factor, as we often rub elbows with codebases that use these languages as well.
 
This is an on-site role at Anduril headquarters in Costa Mesa, California. Our team is building software for hardware products, so physical presence in our RF lab is often required throughout the course of software development and testing. Remote work would only be considered for candidates with something extraordinary to offer to our team.
 
 I'd be happy to answer any other questions in the thread below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone,
Am new to the method, so naturally am still exploring its intents and purposes. I've decided to start using it for my research on courses about machine learning applied to geology, machine learning itself or geology itself. I'm used to writing stuff down linearly in my paper notebook - not only am accostumed to it, but I also feel pretty good doing so. It makes more sense to me, I guess, to jolt down in a notebook something thorough and linear as a course, more sense than writing atomic notes at least. I'm not sure if I'm "stuck to the hold habits" or that's actually somewhat the way to go. I wanted to try Zettelkasten to be more dynamic in my note-writing, as well as faster - for as much as I like and absorb better on paper, I roughly take one hour per page. Insanity.
My "notes" in my notebook are more of a summary of the thing I am consuming than simplified notes per se; I like to make them so that when I need to check the subject in the future once it is forgotten, I will be able to quickly comprehend it again. Which is why I am feeling using the notebook, rather than Zettelkasten, makes more sense.
Or perhaps I can make atomic notes on the subject and link them on an "index" of some sort in my Zettelkasten? An index such as "Course X/Y/Z" with the individual atomic notes?
Thanks for any input.]]></summary>

It allows you to create correct SQL queries during compilation and display them to the user. I originally started this project because there is essentially no runtime overhead compared to the database driver. Although this approach has its problems, such as increased compilation time and sometimes the need to move code to different modules due to stage restrictions. However, I think this is an interesting approach that is worth considering.

 I kinda miss Scala a bit though so thinking of coming back after several nearly 4 years long break. It looks like a lot has changed.
 What libraries/ecosystems are y'all using these days? What's popular for HTTP, Database, etc? Back in my day, Doobie and Cats with http4s were considered cool. I'm wondering what's changed.
 I also completely missed out Scala 3 and the transition. Where are we with that now? Is it still true that a lot of people still use Scala 2?

So why not Doom? recommended for ex-vimers, fast, mature and it ships pretty sane defaults. Ironically the problem is that it does its job just fine! everything is already done, all plugins I can need now or in the future are well configured. But I want more: I want to configure it by myself, to understand elisp code and own my emacs.d, I want minimalism…and I feel I’ve failed.
 Any recommendation? anyone has felt like me? Thank you, this is my first post

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My Zettelkasten has been around for about 2.5 years now. After about six months, I had the idea of tidying up the Zettelkasten for the first time. Somehow it bothered me that parts of the box looked very tidy, while others looked quite chaotic.
Initially, my activities to improve this situation were still very sporadic and unsystematic. I lacked a ‘method for tidying up’. But it wasn't so easy to find. Even my favourite source ‘How to take smart notes’ by Sönke Ahrens didn't help me.
Why don't I use Marie Kondo's method? She already helps me tidy up my socks. Why can't she also improve the situation in my Zettelkasten ? Thought, done: Since 14 May 2023 (create date, Zettelkasten), I have been tidying up using the method.
But I can do even better. Today, while I was tidying up my Zettelkasten, I was offered the note ‘Simplicity’. And Google was kind enough to point me to ‘The Five Elements’ within Feng Shui via ‘The Principle of Clarity’.
And yes, Feng Shui has been identified by scientists and philosophers as both non-scientific and pseudoscientific, and has been described as a paradigmatic example of pseudoscience. But it has helped me to find a different way of looking at my Zettelkasten. Looking at WOOD, FIRE, EARTH, METAL and WATER makes new connections that were invisible without this framework.
I also added "The Five Principles" which helped me to find the right balance to tidy up my Zettelkasten.

  
What experiences have you had? What is the best way to tidy up a Zettelkasten?]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been using Emacs for all my (rather limited) text editing and bash scripting needs for years, and am finally getting round to seriously learning c++, partly thanks to the excitement in recent years over things like lsp-mode, eglot and tree-sitter. 
 A quick search through this sub, however, shows frustrated posts every couple of years over emacs' performance as a c++ ide. My (perhaps optimistic) suspicion is that it'll be more than sufficient for my purposes, given that I'm a long way off from million line codebases and so on, so I probably won't need or want full ide functionality for a while. 
 So, assuming that my needs are fairly simplistic, is it reasonable as a beginner programmer learning c++ to be using emacs for (more-or-less) my entire learning environment, or am I missing out in ways I don't yet understand? I currently have pdf-tools for reading a textbook in one fullscreen frame on one monitor, and then 2 windows side-by-side on another monitor - the cpp file (or header or makefile or whatever) I'm editing on one side, and the other side for the output of M-x compile (which I've bound to C-c c) or a M-x shell (bound to C-c s).
 I would love some recommendations for things that I don't yet know I'll want. For example, syntax highlighting in c++-mode seems good enough so far - do I want to be using c++-ts? If so, is the grammar on the tree-sitter github page the one to use? Do I want ide style features like symbol/definition navigation, corrections, reformatting, completion as you type? Any suggestions for configs focused on those sorts of features? I'm not a fan of big starter kits like doom, but would love to read other people's configs for things that I can apply myself.
 I know this is all a bit vague, so apologies for that. I guess I don't really know what I'm looking for, which is sort of the point. Many thanks for reading this!

 I am writing a client library for NATS topic based messaging. I am trying to define the API implementation through which to interact with the library, along with the data structure of the client. The client will need to 
  
read from a socket to fetch messages (this can be a single sync thread)
 
accept async requests to write messages to the socket, along with updating the client's topic router
 
 Question
 I initially started implementing this functionality using the state monad, however this will cause problems as soon as async requests occur (e.g. one thread will be updating the client's read messages into a buffer, another will be updating the topic router, overwriting the former changes)
 There appears to be a library for concurrent state, this feels like it could be a solution for my problem, but I wanted to check with those more experienced in Haskell - does this approach make sense, or am I missing a more simple solution? I assume adding more granular concurrency control over each resource would be lead to a more efficient, but more complicated implementation, so I'd prefer simple for the time being.
 TL;DR
 If I want a data structure that has 'mutable' state, that will be accessed across threads/async, does the concurrent state library make the most sense?
 Thanks in advance

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone,
 I'm trying to configure a Literate DevOps workflow using Org Mode in Emacs. My goal is to dynamically insert a password, retrieved via password-store-get, into a shell script. However, when I use the noweb syntax <<>> in my shell block, it just inserts the Emacs Lisp code instead of the evaluated result.
 Here's what I have so far:
 ```
 +name: get-passwd
 +begin_src emacs-lisp
 (password-store-get "my-pass-store/postgres/pass")
 +end_src
 +begin_src shell :shebang "#!/usr/bin/env bash" :tangle /ssh:remote-host|sudo:deploy@remote-host:postgres/secret-secret.sh :noweb yes
 export DB_PASSWORD=<<get-passwd>> podman secret create --env POSTGRES_PASSWORD DB_PASSWORD
 +end_src
 ```
 When I tangle this, the generated script still contains the function call instead of the actual password:
 ``` bash
 !/usr/bin/env bash
 export DB_PASSWORD=(password-store-get "my-pass-store/postgres/pass") podman secret create --env POSTGRES_PASSWORD DB_PASSWORD ```
 I’d like the script to include the actual password rather than the function. Does anyone know how I can achieve this? Any tips or simpler solutions would be greatly appreciated!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When using emms with mpv, is there any way to get rid of duplicate music track notifications in gnome?
 I use emms with mpv as the player. It all works great. My only little issue is that in the gnome panel I always have two notifications of the current track. I run emacsclient and on startup that creates a notification automatically before running emms that just says "unknown title." Then when I play emms, I get a notification that indicates the track and has a thumbnail, and a second duplicate notification, except without a thumbnail.
 I have tried turning off notifications in gnome settings for both emacs and for mpv and that has no effect.
 I am using Pop!_22.04 with gnome 42.9 and emacs 28. The relevant part of my emms config is the following:
  
(require 'emms-setup)
 (require 'emms-mpris)
 (emms-all)
 (emms-default-players)
 (emms-mpris-enable)
 (setq emms-player-list '(emms-player-mpv))
 (setq emms-source-file-default-directory "~/Music/")
 (setq emms-info-functions '(emms-info-tinytag))
 (setq emms-browser-covers 'emms-browser-cache-thumbnail-async)
 (setq emms-playing-time-display-mode nil)
  
I know this might really be a gnome issue. But I have searched and got no answers so I thought I'd try here. Rhythmbox also shows duplicate notifications, though both have thumbnails. The only music player I've tried that has just one notification with a nice thumbnail seems to be Lollypop.

For the past few months, I've taken a lot of reference notes on 4x6 cards ranging from Coursera courses, academic journals to books and even my own daily journal.
After converting them into main notes for 3 weeks, I now have a question, which is hilarious but did bother me a lot. The question is how should I sequence my reference note cards for a course or a book because I might have notes on two cards for 2 chapters or for a combination of different lesson videos.
I watch some YouTube videos, but it looks like no one have talked about sequencing of reference note cards?]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Title. Rather than executing the expected org-move-subtree-up, M-k does nothing. All the other directional keys work as expected with M. M-UP also works as expected. When looking at the Messages buffer, M-k produces no messages when operating on regular paragraphs, but when used on headings (and only headings) it produces this:
 Invalid face attribute :foreground nil [x times]
 The number of times increments anywhere from 20-40+ on each input of M-k. I am currently using DOOM Emacs, and have tried completely removing all Emacs files and then reinstalling multiple times with no luck. This has been a problem for several months now, and after looking on the internet and finding nothing of use, I decided I would finally post a question here.
 System: Ubuntu Studio 23.10 running on a Thinkpad P15 Gen 2i
 Please let me know any other information that would be useful to solving this. I am an Emacs newbie, so be kind.
 EDIT: Current troubleshooting data
  
Problem persists on both X and Wayland
 Problem persists when all packages except evil-org are removed
 C-h k M-<up> returns expected information on org-metaup. Similar results for other directional keys 
 M-k is listed as an alternate keybinding
 
 C-h k M-k returns nothing. It seems that M-k never makes it to Emacs 
 This is strange, as M-k does produce text in the Messages buffer when used on headings
 M-k also causes the mode line to flash, if pressed repeatedly
 
 On my other system, running Artix and i3, this problem does not present

 but I am getting this error:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello! I am new to this forum and Zettelkasten. Do I take literature notes on permanent notes in my case? If not, how to convert literature notes into permanent notes?
Today I was reading the book Atomic Habits on my iPad in the kindle app and there was an option to take notes on a specific line/word in the book. I read about 20-25 pages and marked a lot of information (there is an option - I can mark lines and words in blue, red, orange and yellow colors). So, as I was reading I took a lot of literature notes in the app (in total 15-20) and it was not one note that contained all the literature notes. I wrote all these notes with my own words and I noticed that I was describing some ideas very differently but the essence remained the same and I referred to what the author wanted to convey, but in different words. And sometimes I even supplemented these ideas with my own thoughts.
Now I am using Obsidian and wrote down these ideas from my iPad to my computer in Obsidian as literature notes. Some of them were similar, so I filtered them out. But I do not think these are literature notes. They seem like permanent notes. In my case, when I make such notes, are they permanent or literature notes? And sorry for my bad English. If I made any mistakes, please correct me. I will be very grateful for any answer!]]></summary>

 It integrates with use-package and straight so transitioning is surprisingly easy, for me at least. And now that I have transitioned, I can try packages quickly and easily, and best of all without stalling my session.
 Thanks very much u/nv-elisp, not only did he write elpaca, he's also been really active on reddit, I came across many of his comments answering peoples questions when I was looking into switching to elpaca.

 I added a new design, with the title on the left. Let me know what you think and if you have any feedback/ideas on usability/features that you think would be important for the first release and I'll try to incorporate it before releasing.
 Added a corfu (and corfu-popupinfo) mode, inspired by Manueljlin's if emacs was made by zoomers post. Will try to move the icons on the title bar instead of 'Corfu' before releasing.
 BTW any package name ideas?
 The new design + corfu:

 I do most of my development locally and test on a remote machine, where TRAMP is simply too slow for code intelligence and responsiveness. To improve this, I am sharing a mode for asynchronous file syncing using `unison`. I did so after trying several other similar approaches, including ones based on rsync (https://github.com/r-zip/rsync-mode).
 My solution is probably due to specifics of secure compute environments managed by coder, but it works well for me, and should be general purpose. Hope someone finds it useful, too!

So I wrote a small wrapper script over scala-cli/GraalVM which reuses the compiled binary it detects that the script content hasn't changed.
 https://github.com/jatcwang/instant-scala
 The script quite bare-bones as I'm hoping that scala-cli will have first-class support for this in the future. But meanwhile hope this can help someone else too :)

 If I pin emacs to the dash and open it by clicking there it does receive focus (emacs and emacs (client)). Double-clicking the binary directly in the file explorer and running emacs in the terminal both similarly give focus.
 I've searched for a bit online and the closest I've seen to this exact problem is this: (link) (although this: (link) suggests someone has the same problem).
 One thing to note: this problem only occurs under Wayland proper. When under X11 (Xwayland), emacs gets focus correctly (my machine switches if I enable/disable hybrid graphics and reboot). 
  
 Given what I've found, I think it's clear the problem is something with Wayland and xdg-activation or whatever it is, meaning it's probably something I can't solve. But just in case, has anyone had this problem and figured out a workaround (other than just launching emacs any other way)?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm know I'm asking this at a Scala channel but I'm counting on those who have experience/knowledge on both Scala and other FP languages. The intention is not to start a flamewar with things like x is definitively better than y, but just actual facts to understand where Scala sits compared to the other FP languages. I'm not a FP expert. I did a few things here and there, but for sure I don't have solid foundations to take my own conclusions, yet.
 I would say that the reason I'm asking this is due to some comments I saw at the r/haskell. The main points were:
  
The mix between OO and FP. To some degree I find this odd as well and I still don't see the value of it.
 How Scala had and still do lots of compromises because it's so dependent on the JVM which has a totally different model. 
 Overall complexity of the language. I would say that this is better at Scala 3, but still, I find the language really, really hard.
 How easy it is to start mixing up functional and non functional code which defeats the whole purpose of writing the functional code. OCaml suffers from this as well, but I would say that is way harder to do the same on Haskell or Erlang.
  
Thanks!

Recently, I've been looking for a solution to more fully integrate my ZK with my daily journaling, planning, and task management.  I came close to finding that in NotePlan, which I loved and have used for about three years.  It did a great job of integrating everything except my ZK, which I maintained in The Archive.  The hump there was that NotePlan used a somewhat different file format from The Archive (both used text files, but in different ways).  I was slowly trying to build up steam to write a Python script to convert from one format to the other, and due to other priorities, I didn't get to it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Hydrogen Framework for Emacs:
 https://codeberg.org/joe-adams/hydrogen
 Hydrogen is a very small framework that aims to make Emacs easier to use for people who are used to text editors other than Emacs or Vi. It gives you modern keybindings, improves the behavior of tabs and windows and a few other things.
 Some highlights:
  
Under 200k, including comments, the GPL, etc.
 The actual code is under 30k.
 No external packages, does not impose a package manager on you.
 Composed of several features that can individually be activated or deactivated.
 Modern keybindings 
 C-c for copy, C-a for select all, etc.
 
 Tab is just tab if no text is selected.
 Generally stops Emacs from opening new tabs when you open new buffers
 Closes windows when you close the last tab
 Dired doesn't new buffers when you navigate to new directories.
 A splash screen
 Heavily commented code base
 Code says the default values of settings that are changed.
  
Please let me know what you think and if you have any suggestions. Please consider recommending Hydrogen to any new Emacs users you know.

 I had GHCup install every tool (including path editin, hls, and better stack integration) during it's installation (and also tried reinstalling). I turned on system ghc in stack.yaml and let HLS know GHCup on $PATH. 
 I then followed first steps, and I can compile and run haskell code in terminal with ghc. However, when I created an .hs file and tried to run it in vscode, it's telling me that hls 2.9.0.1 is needed to be installed. I went on GHCup tui and it said it already had hls 2.7.0.0 installed. I also tried letting vscode just install the hls 2.9.0.1 but it's not working (likely it's not linked to GHCup?)

 Yup. I have transparency set. Awesome feature that motivates me to use emacs more often
 But this looked kinda annoying in org mode (the gray asterisks behind the stars). I know that the non-leading stars are colored so that it would blend with the background, but now that the background is no longer a solid color, the asterisks look like this.
 either i'm gonna make it so that the headings are gonna indicate its level by its size instead of its position, or i'll find a workaround to completely hide the stars with spaces or an invisible character. any advice?

 I was trying to use the appimage version, to get a newer version of emacs (29.4 instead of 27.something). I successfully added it to path, and doom recognized it and rebuilt my packages, but then I got this. Vanilla emacs works fine. The picture shows all errors.

Sorry for the wall of text, I don't know how to phrase it better. How do I make it so doom emacs (no evil mode) starts exactly how I closed it without having to go through scattered config files? I don't wanna mess it up. What I really want is to start with the last file used open and it's folder on treemacs, and a little terminal open with my zsh config. Also, how do I open another buffer with a file I double-clicked on treemacs? I have no idea what to do then and I'm afraid of deleting it. I loved emacs so far and want to learn more about it after finishing this, as I'm pretty satisfied already. Please don't send me a video or a giant tutorial link lol, my ADHD won't let me sit through it without going insane. Thanks in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After I invoke org capture to create a journal entry, the cursor is position at the start of the entry, prior to the timestamp, instead of after it. In other words, as soon as the capture is done, I cannot start writing the entry, but have to move the cursor to the end of the line before I can start typing. Why does it happen?
 The following is what I have in my configuration for org-capture-templates.
  ("j" "Journal entry" plain (function org-journal-find-location) "** %(format-time-string org-journal-time-format)\n%?" :empty-lines 2 :jump-to-captured t :immediate-finish t) 
 where org-journal-find-location is defined as follows.
  (defun org-journal-find-location () ;; Open today's journal, but specify a non-nil prefix argument in order to ;; inhibit inserting the heading; org-capture will insert the heading. (org-journal-new-entry t) (unless (eq org-journal-file-type 'daily) (org-narrow-to-subtree)) (goto-char (point-max))) 
 These are based on the example snippets from org-journal repository.
 I thought the use of "%?" following the newline should force the cursor to be placed after the headline (containing the timestamp), but it does not. What am I overlooking?

 Is it possible to rename a file in the buffer menu only?
 So instead of having default.rb<2> and default.rb<3> it would be like default.rb<foo> default.rb<bar>

 My eshell completion does not work when ivy-mode is enabled. It finds the good completion but removes prefixes like / or ~/
 Does something know why ?
 Here is how I configure ivy :
 (use-package ivy

 Thanks.
 Here is demo without ivy-mode and then with ivy-mode enabled :

But, again and again, i feel like my Emacs configuration reaches a point where it starts to feel "fragile". I've been working on mine on and off for some time now and, in general, i really like where i'm at.
 But the i try adding in Treemacs and it's a hassle to make that change. Just adding it in with use-package results in "treemacs loaded before elpaca". So, `:ensure (:wait t)` seems to solve that. Now treemacs works. As soon as i add a `:bind` to the setup, the treemacs buffer opens empty and i get `Error in post-command-hook (treemacs--post-command): (wrong-type-argument markerp nil)`. Without keybind it's fine. This is just one example.
 I look around and see really elaborate configurations with major customizations that seem to work flawlessly for those people. But for me, it quickly reaches a point where things start behaving differently from what i would expect.
 I'm close to starting over (again) as i feel that i've lost control over that configuration. And i don't even know why.

 If I don't mark the methods in ZipTag inline, it works, but then I suppose the tuple is traversed at runtime. Is this a fundamental limitation, or can it be worked around? It seems like it should be possible in theory, since all the information is available compile-time.

 When I change outside of Emacs a file which is visted by an Emacs buffer, the file is not auto-reverted. When I try to edit that buffer, Emacs warns that the file has been changed outside of Emacs, so I don't lose content. However the buffer is not visually updated.
 How can I check if reverting should actually work? Or do I missunderstand auto-reverting of buffers in Emacs?

our interests and expertise have become significantly broader over the years, our love
for immutable, composable and typed architecture have made functional
programming and programming languages in general an important part of our DNA.
This long-standing activity was formalized last year as the Programming
Languages & Compilers Group. The PL&C group has been busy in the
second quarter of 2024, and this post is a summary of what we’ve been doing.
Our involvement varies depending on the availability of each team member and
client engagements; if some projects might seem idle, this is usually just
temporary. All projects appearing below are actively developed.

 This is a freshly compiled Emacs, ran with -Q and rust-mode + eglot, nothing more. You can see on the screenshot that the minibuffer shows only the first line of eldoc (C-h .) - it cuts the rest off even though max-mini-window-height isn't the problem. I want it to also include the second line with the type information (I want it because I hate inlay-hints and I turn them off). I spent some time doing research and I found this package https://github.com/emacsmirror/eglot-signature-eldoc-talkative that seems to be related but it didn't do what I wanted. Based on it I tried to do some things but honestly I'm a pretty bad Emacs user and I have no idea what I'm doing.

But this journey also became one of very personal development as I continue to find additional productivity techniques, psychological insights, etc. that are helping me be a better me. And the ZK method seems well suited for also keeping track of those things.
Is there some wisdom in keeping the things separate? Or do you just let it all live together?
What about journaling? I ask that because my "personal development" stuff can veer closer to "journaling" than "business research," but journaling (and dream journaling) feels like it shouldn't be anywhere near my ZK.]]></summary>

 Is there a way to highlight the active window by coloring the border like in many tilling window managers (here i3 from a random video on yt)
 All the solutions I found are about changing the color of the background / modeline. I don't want to change the background (auto-dim-other-buffers.el do the job) and I already have a dynamic modeline color but it's not enough for me to quickly see where i am.

 1. Install Emacs and AUCTeX
  
Emacs: Download and install Emacs from [GNU Emacs]() or use your package manager if you're on Linux.
 AUCTeX: Install AUCTeX through Emacs' package manager: 
 Open Emacs and type M-x package-refresh-contents RET.
 Then, install AUCTeX with M-x package-install RET auctex RET.
 
  
2. Install ConTeXt LMTX
  
Download ConTeXt LMTX from the [Pragma ADE website]().
 Extract the archive and place the folder in a location of your choice.
  
This is what I did and it seems that AUCTex is installed.
 however, I dont know where to go from here, do i need anything else? is there a way to get started with making ConTeXt work on emacs? I have the context-win64 folder in C:\ConTeXt\context-win64 as I was instructed in the directions to make a folder for win64

Swimming with Ideas
This is yet another opportunity to share what you are working on with your friends here on the forum. Add to this discussion by telling us about your zettelkasten journey. Share with us what you're learning. Sharing helps us clarify our goals and visualize our thinking. And sometimes, a conversation sparks a magical moment where we can dive into an idea worth exploring. I'd love to hear more from you.   🫵🏼
Here is my report on why I'm here and my current ZK work themes and ideas:
Exploring feminism as a man.
Working on the concept of creating thinking canvases.
I'm thinking a lot about automation.
I'm back in university for the semester and taking a journalism writing class with a bunch of young people.
Thinking about the "Theory of Maximum Taste" and how to apply it to note-taking.
My reading is very much related to reading and writing.
Books I'm reading or read this week:
Adler, Mortimer Jerome and Van Doren, Charles Lincoln. How to read a book. 2014.[[202407311603]]
Fadiman, Anne. Ex Libris: Confessions of a Common Reader. Unabridged, Recorded Books, 1999. Audiobook Everand
Blundell, William E. The Art and Craft of Feature Writing: Based on the Wall Street Journal Guide. New American Library, 1988.
Strunk, William, and E. B. White. The Elements of Style. 4th ed, Allyn and Bacon, 1999.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[First of all comint infrastructure is a thing that powers M-x shell and M-x run-python and probably other things that im not aware of.
 Its a nice thing because you can use it as a framework to make your shell or repl or interpreter more interactive in very standard emacsy way, by communicating with external processes.
 It gives you code completion (using *Completions* buffer), syntax highlighting (according to the article below), and it can pass those code completion candidates to normal emacs buffer.
 Run M-x run-python, create a new buffer with python-mode, AND you will have context aware code completion in your buffer (try it)
 BUT it does NOT give you code navigation, cause it doesn't integrate with xref, and it's not a full terminal emulator.
 I read the source code of comint.el, python.el, shell.el and found this brilliant article: https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/comint-writing-command-interpreter
 Main problem (besides xref), that i have with comint is that it is dumb terminal (as opposed to xterm-256color terminal), meaning it isn't a full terminal emulator.
 It doesn't interpret ANSI escape sequences, essentially only supporting raw input and output.
 So my question is: Why is that? And how do i fix that?
 To be clear emacs does have full terminal emulators like vterm or ansi-term.
 But i think it would be awesome to have those advantages that comint already has and also have a perfect development environment for creating tui programs.
 I hope this post doesn't feel like a rant or is unclear. I'm interested in emacs architecture design, and want to learn from it.

 Sorry for bad formatting, I'm blaming the android app.
 I've recently had the pain of working with tramp over a slow connection and noticed that minibuffer completion during find-file on a remote path was painfully slow, constanly freezing, and sometimes triggered forbidden reentrant calls.
 I put my poor emacs debugging skills to the task and noticed a large number of test -e ... commands going through tramp, coming from a large number of calls to file-exists-p on remote paths triggered by the completion (was using fido at the time). This seems to hurt other completion packages that are based around completing-read from what I could tell (tested a bit with vertico).
 I tried ido instead and it was blazingly fast in comparison. I couldn't find anything about this through basic googling so thought I'd ask here: I see vertico and friends being recommended here a lot, and while I generally prefer these alternatives over ido, not playing nice with tramp is a pretty big pain point. Anyone has any workaround or config tips to tackle this that don't involve applying super deep advices?

My guest this time will be the creator of Scala himself - Martin Odersky. We will try to discuss and explain all the whats and whys of Lean Scala, of Scala features and how things could look like in the future. The podcast will be streamed live on YouTube and Twitch so you can join and comment or ask questions in the chat, as usual.

 P.S.: I'm trying to figure out RSS (this is a bit simpler) and Apple podcasts + Spotify podcasts by popular demand, it's just painfully slow due to everything being very legalese.
 P.S.2: I got rid of the boom arm and my microphone will be positioned centrally so there should be no more issues with my audio being skewed towards the left channel (I do read YouTube comments!).
 P.S.3: you can also write your questions about Lean Scala down here in comments and I'll try to discuss them with Martin on the podcast!

Applied to Zettelkasten
Imagine each node in the graph is a note in your Zettelkasten.
Imagine each edge in the graph is a link from one note to another. (We actually would need arrows/directed connections)
Then the operation above could be applied to e.g. export a sub-network of your notes while skipping some notes in the process.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello! I've been recently trying to get more intentional about treating Emacs Lisp like 'any other programming language' and so I have a question about package development.
 Let's say that you are developing two packages that depend on different versions of the same package. You are using Eask/Cask/Eldev/Keg/etc and so you have two projects: foo and bar that both depend on some third package baz, but one of them is 'stuck' at an earlier version. The packages are otherwise unrelated. For the argument's sake, you cannot upgrade. How do you get completion, documentation, jump to definition etc pointing at the correct version of baz? Do you clear up your load path every time you switch between the projects?
 Or to put question differently, when you develop foo.el, how do you get elisp completion and documentation relevant only to what foo.el should be able to access and not to anything defined in your configuration? Right now if I open any .el file elisp-completion-at-point will happily suggest any function or variable that I ever defined in init.el. I can of course start a new session and load only foo.el . But then I lose all my customization to get accurate completions.
 This is a pretty common scenario within the larger programming ecosystem and most languages/tools handle it without the developer ever thinking about it, but I have not seen anything on the topic in Emacs Lisp specifically. Any pointers would be appreciated.
 Edit: Some clunky wording in 3rd paragraph.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been on a journey to improve my reading and note-taking process, and I wanted to share my experience and get your thoughts.
 As a long-time note-taking enthusiast and writer, I found myself drowning in a sea of information. My Emacs was filled with org files containing highlights, bookmarks, and copied passages, yet I often struggled to recall or effectively use this information when I needed it. I realized I wasn't truly engaging with what I read.
 I stumbled upon Niklas Luhmann's Zettelkasten method and was intrigued. The idea of summarizing in my own words and connecting ideas across different sources resonated with me. I started experimenting with this method manually and found that I was remembering more and understanding deeper.
 My Solution
 Being an Emacs user, I thought, "Why not create a tool to streamline this process?" That's how I started working on org-zettel-ref-mode.
 Here's what it does:
  
Automatically extracts comments and summaries from the text you're reading.
 Creates an overview window for quick reference.
 Saves literature notes to custom folders.
 Enables quick commenting with a simple command.
 Allows easy navigation between notes and source material.
  
Here's what it looks like:

 I'm curious:
  
Have you ever created tools to enhance your learning process? How did it go?
 How do you manage the balance between efficient reading and deep understanding?
 Do you think automating parts of the note-taking process could be counterproductive to learning?
  
I'd love to hear your thoughts, experiences, or critiques.

 (defun complete-dates ()

 What that does is replace YEAR with 2024 but not seem to execute the first replacement, or the first replacement fails. 
 What do you think? Do I need more backslashes?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey, i'm a very newbie guy on elisp and emacs, and i was mixing up into the xml-print function from the emacs sgml-mode. 
 (xml-print '((ul ((class . "bg-red-400")) "Hello")) ) ;; Writes on the cursor: ;; <ul class="bg-red-400">Hello</ul> 
 The thing is, i don't want to insert/write those values, i just want to print(return as string) them. I was looking at the xml.el from the emacs source, and that thing is huge, so even if a replace all the inserts to quotes that might break something. What i did was the following function:
  (defun xml-print-string () (interactive) (let ( (dummy (generate-new-buffer "Dummy Buffer") ) (formated-xml-string "") ) (switch-to-buffer dummy) (xml-print '((ul ((class . "bg-red-400")) "Hello")) ) (setq formated-xml-string (buffer-string)) (kill-buffer dummy) formated-xml-string )) (xml-print-string) 
 Using C-X and C-E it evaluates to:
 <ul class="bg-red-400">Hello</ul> 
 It works...But i don't know if it's the best way to handle this problem. Can this function escale if i use it a lot? (As it's creating and deleting a buffer)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone,
 I was playing around a bit with SVG in emacs, and changed the way posframes look like. I also have a semi-working version of the frames being animated (sliding from the side, popping from the middle, etc.) - not shown in the screen capture (wouldn't look good in the gif).
 As you can see, I have it working with vertico (+ Marginilia, etc.), regular posframes (like the LLM summary examples), lsp-doc-ui (and eldoc-box), and for FZF.
 I am wondering if there is enough interest in packaging/cleaning up the code and releasing it as a package.
 Note: for some reason, the gif on reddit cuts off a little of the top of lsp-ui-doc, but in my emacs it works great. Had to degrade the size/quality a bit, it looks much better in real use

 I tried Treemacs but I see that it doesn't work very well with project.el. Like when I start Treemacs for the first time I get a blank sidebar. Yes, I can add a project manually to it using C-c C-p a but it is rather inconvenient to do this for every project I work with. Ideally I'd like something that automatically uses the current Git project as the project tree automatically (like how project.el detects current project from .git folders).
 Is there any package that does something like this? If not, a plain tree-format directory tree browser would also be okay for me. Let me know if you have some recommendations.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I've been getting more use out of Org and Agenda now that I have some nice little capture templates setup and a file that it gets stuffed into. However I've now run across something kind of weird.
 I had two meetings yesterday that I had scheduled and they did show up in the Agenda day view, however now they're showing up again today with the marker "1x". However I did not mark them as repeating. 
 So for instance I have:
 * Appointments ** NAO Meeting at HQ Auditorium SCHEDULED: <2024-08-19 Mon 08:30>--<2024-08-19 Mon 13:00> ** Appt w/ Optometrist SCHEDULED: <2024-09-05 Thu 8:00>--<2024-09-05 Thu 9:00> ** 1-on-1 Meeting w/ Michael SCHEDULED: <2024-08-19 Tue 14:00 +7d> 
 Both the NAO and 1-on-1 meeting were yesterday. Today I'm seeing in agenda:
 Week-agenda (W34): Monday 19 August 2024 W34 notes: 8:30 ┄┄┄┄┄ Scheduled: NAO Meeting at HQ Auditorium notes: 8:30-13:00 NAO Meeting at HQ Auditorium notes: 14:00 ┄┄┄┄┄ Scheduled: 1-on-1 Meeting w/ Michael notes: 16:00 ┄┄┄┄┄ Scheduled: DONE Enroll in Benefits Tuesday 20 August 2024 notes: Sched. 1x: NAO Meeting at HQ Auditorium <------ These two seem notes: Sched. 1x: 1-on-1 Meeting w/ Michael <------ weird 
 Why is it showing up again? As far as I can tell from the Org docs and the Agenda docs, I created the timestamp correctly. In the first instance I put in a duration (it was a long block of time) and the second does repeat, but once a week. 
 If I start to accumulate a lot of old entries this is going to get really problematic after a week or two. Any ideas on what I did wrong?
 SOLVED: Took a bit to actually get the RIGHT search engine terms because most things were just pointing back to Org Agenda docs. However the FAQ at this location (https://orgmode.org/worg/org-faq.html#scheduled-vs-deadline-vs-timestamp) seems to have answered it. I just want a timestamp, not a scheduled for most things I think.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am trying to set up a system to get Emacs to profile the total time it takes to do a build. I have come up with the following:
 (global-set-key (kbd "<f12>") (lambda () (interactive) (my/refresh-all-file-buffers) (let ((project-directory (locate-dominating-file default-directory my/buildfile))) (when project-directory (with-temp-buffer (cd project-directory) (let ((elapsed (benchmark-elapse (compile (concat "python " my/buildfile))))) (read-only-mode -1) (insert (format "%.6f seconds" elapsed)) (read-only-mode 1))))))) 
 However, the "%.6f seconds" text does not appear in the buffer. Instead, I get the following message:
 Compilation finished Refreshed open files. 
 I am not sure what the issue is or if the above approach is even correct. Any help in how to get that format text to appear at the end of the buffer?
 EDIT:
 Fixed thanks to /u/arthurno1. Following is the final code, for future reference. I had to save the start time in a variable because the compile function works asynchronously.
 (defvar *last-compile-start-time*) (global-set-key (kbd "<f12>") (lambda () (interactive) (setq *last-compile-start-time* (float-time)) (my/refresh-all-file-buffers) (let ((project-directory (locate-dominating-file default-directory my/buildfile))) (when project-directory (with-temp-buffer (cd project-directory) (compile (concat "python " my/buildfile))))))) (defun my/compilation-finish-function (buffer desc) (with-current-buffer "*compilation*" (save-excursion (let ((inhibit-read-only t)) (goto-char (point-max)) (insert (format "Compilation took %f seconds" (- (float-time) *last-compile-start-time*))))))) (add-hook 'compilation-finish-functions 'my/compilation-finish-function)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[[SOLVED!!... ]
 I've installed the language grammar for C++ with treesit-install-language-grammar and I can enable c++-ts-mode but syntax highlighting isn't working, only #include gets highlighted rest is all plain.
 https://preview.redd.it/eoglirodjsjd1.jpg?width=1153&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=21c8be6b94e28f655e6f2f6faf08ad6be21acfc6
 I also installed treesit-auto just to be sure but it's still the same. How can I get the proper syntax highlighting?
 Edit: More details about the issue:
 My emacs version is 29.4 and tree-sitter version is 0.22.6_1*, both are installed from official voidlinux repository.*
 Following is my \Messages* buffer when I open c++ file:*
 [yas] Prepared just-in-time loading of snippets (but no snippets found). Starting Emacs daemon. Error during redisplay: (jit-lock-function 1) signaled (treesit-query-error "Node type error at" 216 "[\"_Atomic\" \"break\" \"case\" \"const\" \"continue\" \"default\" \"do\" \"else\" \"enum\" \"extern\" \"for\" \"goto\" \"if\" \"inline\" \"register\" \"restrict\" \"return\" \"sizeof\" \"static\" \"struct\" \"switch\" \"typedef\" \"union\" \"volatile\" \"while\" \"and\" \"and_eq\" \"bitand\" \"bitor\" \"catch\" \"class\" \"co_await\" \"co_return\" \"co_yield\" \"compl\" \"concept\" \"consteval\" \"constexpr\" \"constinit\" \"decltype\" \"delete\" \"explicit\" \"final\" \"friend\" \"mutable\" \"namespace\" \"new\" \"noexcept\" \"not\" \"not_eq\" \"operator\" \"or\" \"or_eq\" \"override\" \"private\" \"protected\" \"public\" \"requires\" \"template\" \"throw\" \"try\" \"typename\" \"using\" \"virtual\" \"xor\" \"xor_eq\"] ce (auto) ce (this) ce" "Debug the query with `treesit-query-validate'") 
 After making this post I tried several different older versions of the tree-sitter-cpp language but it didn't work.
 
 Solution: I installed tree-sitter-cpp grammar version v0.21.0 after reading it in the comments and it worked. Seems I was using wrong versions so far.

 Basically, long story short, Im using Emacs at work and home (for some obscure language called Magik). At work, the laptop install checkpoint as per company policy.

 This is a "working" but still highly experimental transient for ffmpeg I've begun work on. It's currently capable of very basic conversion semantics on 1 infile and 1 outfile per interaction.
 Improvements I hope to complete:
  
Multiple infiles and outfiles per conversion; I won't consider the project complete without this
 Stream selection options on the basic conversion options
 Dedicated transient prefix for A/V filter construction and other complex directives
 Support for most of the available infile/outfile commands
  
Many of these improvements (especially the first one) require more thought than went into the prototype, so I expect progress be slow. Transients are a deep but rewarding rabbit-hole to enter. In the meantime, I don't consider the code fit for public consumption; I look forward to this changing in the future.

 Now, just checking before reinventing the wheel... I need a function that updates the content of the file/buffer with any changes that have occurred in the directory. It doesn't need to be immediate, it's fine if it does so when called, and it should just notify me which files have been renamed, deleted, or changed names (using the ID of each referenced file).
 Is there any package that already implements this kind of functions / commands?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There is an API out of my control, so I've written a few tests for it in a ZIO test suite to make sure it works as intended.
 I want to ignore these tests if the API server is down, so I've also written a ZIO effect that checks for connectivity. It was like this:
 object ApiTests extends ZIOSpecDefault { override def spec = suite("test api")( ... // tests ).whenZIO(checkConnectivity) .provideShared(ZLayer.fromZIO(ApiService.create)) private def checkConnectivity: ZIO[ApiService, Nothing, Boolean] = ... } 
 But checkConnectivity takes time to run especially if the server is down, so I want to run it only once, whereas with whenZIO on the test suite it's run once for every test in the suite. So at the moment the best I've got is this:
 import zio.test.TestAspect.beforeAll object ApiTests extends ZIOSpecDefault { override def spec = { suite("test api")( ... // tests ).whenZIO(isAlive) @@ beforeAll(checkConnectivityV2) }.provideShared(ZLayer.fromZIO(ApiService.create)) private var isAlive = true private def checkConnectivityV2: ZIO[ApiService, Nothing, Unit] = { ... // overwrites `isAlive` accordingly } } 
 I can't help but feel it's not the best practice to use a loose var here. Is there a more idiomatic way to achieve this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I got into functional programming a few years back and was then introduced to category theory, specifically Bartosz's book and video series (link). I read it during my spare time for a span of around 2 years and just finished the last page. Despite having little math background other than the few math classes that are typical for a computer science major, and not being able to come up with many relevant examples, I enjoyed reading through the book and tried my best to follow along every part, except coends.
 However, I struggled with the challenges in the book. I had to look up for solutions, or just failed to understand them at all, for more than half of them. I also didn't realize until the last few chapters that I kind of got natural transformations wrong. I thought it's a morphism of F a -> G a, but really it maps any object a to a morphism F a -> G a. I noticed that my retention for the knowledge is low. In other words, I forget the details of concepts in the book pretty fast. I tried to explain to myself verbally the concepts I learned, but I can feel it's wonky sometimes.
 I'd like to ask what are the next steps for me? Should I go through a different text, maybe "Category Theory for the Working Mathematicians", or others like "Category Theory in Contexts", hoping that maybe they'll solidify and expand my learning from a different aspect? Or should I learn a few other branches of math that I'm interested, and come back to category theory and see how they relate? Or?

 I'm looking to create a custom agenda command that filters all entries associated with the categories work and business. I already have separate files named ~/org/work.org and ~/org/business.org, and from what I understand from documentation, entries in these files automatically and implicitly receive the corresponding categories.
 However, while I don't often do this, it's possible that I might explicitly set a :CATEGORY: work property somewhere else in my org files. Given this, I need a command that will capture all entries either from the ~/org/work.org and ~/org/business.org files OR with :CATEGORY: work, OR :CATEGORY: business set explicitly.
 Below I will give examples of records that I would like to filter in this way:

 I've a project that contains several subdirectories, one of which is shown as foo. The build.sc is as follows:
 import mill._, scalalib._, scalafmt._ trait MyModule extends SbtModule with ScalafmtModule { def scalaVersion = "3.4.2" def scalacOptions: T[Seq[String]] = Seq( "-encoding", "UTF-8", "-feature", "-Werror", "-explain", "-deprecation", "-unchecked", "-Wunused:all", "-rewrite", "-indent", "-source", "future", ) trait MyTestModule extends SbtTests with TestModule.ScalaTest { def scalatestVersion = "3.2.19" def scalacOptions: T[Seq[String]] = Seq("-encoding", "UTF-8") def ivyDeps = Agg( ivy"org.scalactic::scalactic:$scalatestVersion", ivy"org.scalatest::scalatest:$scalatestVersion", ) } } object foo extends MyModule { object test extends MyTestModule } 
 Questions:
  
I want to apply the scalacOptions to only the main source, not test. Currently I achieve this by overriding the scalacOptions in the MyTestModule, but it'd be nice to be able to specify the target specifically instead of declaring globally and then overriding.
 Instead of having to list each submodule foo, bar, ..., it'd be nice to be able to add them dynamically. For this project, all subdirectories that don't start with a period can be considered as a submodule.

 Then I encountered one little problem; it seems that with Emasc 29, I'm no longer able to run Emacs on MSys2 with:
 # not really working well $ emacs-29 -nw 
 whilst with v27.2, I can:
 # working okay $ /usr/bin/emacs -nw 
 The problem doesn't disappear in either the one provided by the package manager or the fresh local Emacs that I built from scratch in MSys2.
 Yes, I know that a workaround would be to use something like:
 # possible workaround with poor user experience $ winpty emacs -nw 
 This is weird though. How does the older package (v27.2) not require winpty, but does the new one (v29 above) now?

 I'm a very inexperienced programmer, and I'm planning on buying a surface pro 11. I have haskell in my upcoming classes, but I've heard people saying it's more complicated since its a windows arm based system. I've programmed a little haskell on my home pc (not ARM based) and the downloading process was fairly straightforward. So I'm wondering whether it's possible to program haskell on a new surface pro without jumping through a lot of hoops, or if it's close to the experience on a PC.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 I've two small snippets, where I'm trying to expand one snippet inside another. As the snippet that gets expanded is always the same one, and it's always expanded I've been trying to use yas-expand-snippet and yas-lookup-snippet in a transform on the field...
 My first snippet is something like,
 # key: CMakeVersion # name: CMakeVersion # type: snippet # -- ${1:Major}.${2:Minor}${3:.${4:Patch}${5:.${6:Tweak}}}$0 
 While the second snippet, that I want to expand the first into is,
 # key: cmake_minimum_required # name: cmake_minimum_required # type: snippet # -- cmake_minimum_required(VERSION ${1:Minimum$(yas-expand-snippet (yas-lookup-snippet 'CMakeVersion))}${2:...${3:PolicyMax}}${4: FATAL_ERROR})$0 
 The transform seems to replace the $1 field with just a t (maybe like this?) and I'm not sure I follow why this is happening? I've tried with and without yas-triggers-in-field in the snippets and my config, but I'm unable to get it to play...
 Am I going about this the wrong way? Is there a better approach? Or can someone spot my mistake?!?
 Thanks, IGS.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have an enterprise CRUD appliaction, consisting of multiple services such as equipment, tasks, clients, eployees etc. They're not microservices at all, but rather modules within the mononlith Scala app.
 At first every service had its own algebra, e.g.:
  trait Employees[F[_]]: def addEmployee(person: Person): F[Unit] def vacation(employeeId: UUID): F[Unit] def findByDepartment(departmentId: UUID): F[Option[Employee]] 
 Basically a DAO. Sometimes it also does some authorization checks, but mostly its about communicating with the storage. It was cool at first:
  
Different implementations for different storage targets
 I see dependencies of every function e.g. def findEquipment[F[_]: Equipment: Employees]
 Additional type-safety - it's nice to see that a particular function works with Employees only
 Testing
  
However, after some time:
  
We've picked a single storage target
 There's no big difference in terms of dependencies with def findEquipment(equipment: Equipment[IO], employees: Employees[IO])
 Type-safety is a win in 10-20% of functions because many have 4+ algebras or even Async
 For testing I just use the same implementations with empty DB - DB is an important aspect of behavior that I need to carefully duplicate for each testing implementation
  
Tagless Final is advertised for DAO in almost every tutorial, but does it really make any sense? I switched to more concrete services and hardly going to regret. I still have TF, but for much lower-level things: Logging, Tracing, Queing etc. What is your experience? To me it looks like TF make sense in DAO only in educational materials.

 class Wrapper t where wrap :: a -> t a unwrap :: t a -> a 
 Now, of course, I could write:
 newtype Box a = Box a instance Wrapper Box where wrap = Box unwrap (Box x) = x 
 But I'm wondering if it's possible to provide a way for Wrapper to become stock-derivable so that I can write the more concise newtype Box a = Box a deriving Wrapper. 
 I've tried searching for info on this, but I've only been able to find information about, just, how to use deriving in general.

They are actually buffer-local variables, but since I spend most of my time in narrowed org buffers, I decided to hook the modification of the local variables to the narrowing and widening of the buffer. I'm sure it has a lot of room for improvement, but so far it has worked well for me.
 The function hack-local-variables-property-drawer is the one to run when an org buffer is interactively narrowed or widened. Why interactively: you don't want it to run 50 times in a row when calling org-agenda, for example. If it's not the first time it runs in a buffer, it first restores the original values of the variables it changed last time. Then it reads the new variables from the "LOCAL_VARIA…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I tried to make Emacs use the “Monaspace” font for proportional text. I really love this font, but it does not get rendered properly (refer to the attached screenshot). If you look at the text against the highlight line, you can see that there is lot more space below the baseline than there is above the median. Should I tweak the `line-spacing` or some other size to get rid of this problem? Any pointers are grealy appreciated!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm an evil user, and I often define local leader bindings with the following definer from general.el:
 lisp (general-create-definer local-leader :states '(normal visual motion) :prefix ",") 
 Using this like (local-leader :keymaps 'org-mode-map "o" 'hydra-org/body) works just fine, as long as the keymap in question belongs to a major mode (at least I think that's the issue here). I've created a custom minor mode (the major mode that'll be active is always lisp-mode, if that matters) and defined something in its keymap like so:
 lisp (local-leader :keymaps 'my-mode-map "l" 'my-function) 
 I can see the bindings for the default evil modes in my-mode-map just fine, enabled my-mode, but they don't work as , still seems to be bound to the default evil/vim motion.
 What can I do to make , work as a prefix in this situation?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I posted about the crashing of Emacs by xwidget-webkit-browse-url here.
 Traversing through threads on Emacs bugs, I found this chain that describes how one can avoid a crash. Namely, run
 emacs -q --xrm "emacs.synchronous: true" 
 (it has to be -q rather than -Q, as the latter ignores all X resources).
 This is fine for one-off uses of the xwidget-webkit browser, but I use Emacs in daemon mode, and
 emacs --init-directory=~/my-init-dir --daemon --xrm "emacs.synchronous: true" 
 continues to crash (I specify the init-directory as I have it in a different location, the problem arises even without it).
 Has anyone found a way around this yet? FWIW, I'm still using Emacs 29.1, will upgrade soon to 29.4.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My team is using notion for shared docs. I tried writing directly on notion but 1. the subpage system is driving me crazy (a page can be a link, or can be a whole line! and if you delete the whole line one, the page will be deleted, and sometimes you don't need whole line one; let alone the subpage being attached to parent so moving things around is another hassle) 2. It looks ugly compared to my emacs theme or website theme. 
 The pain plus the bliss of writting in org-mode made me wonder if there's a way to write in org-mode and export it to notion. I guess if I have the bulk of the doc done at some permanent form(don't need to edit much) I don't care where it is on anyway. So what I'm looking for is a solution to 1. write a lot of stuffs in org-mode(possibly from lots of files linked together with org-id or file link) 2. slide them into notion as a cluster of pages. 
 I'm currently trying notion's builtin import function https://www.notion.so/help/import-data-into-notion So far html is not working(failed with no error message), and I'm trying others, but I wonder if there's others have done this before?
 Currently my solution is to 1. write my stuff with org-mode and publish to my personal website (e.g. https://hermanhel.codeberg.page/braindump-ui/#f351ae9c-c280-4c71-9b12-1b8ba4a4200d this some doc I wrote about using huggingface) 2. make a page on notion and stick link to my website there. But this way other's cannot edit it.
