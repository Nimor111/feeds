        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I want to move point forward one line in a buffer other than the current one. This is part of a package I'm writing, so I'm talking about doing this programmatically, in code. My instinct is to use forward-line inside a call to with-current-buffer. My code didn't work and I've isolated the problem -- my call to `forward-line' doesn't do anything. I've tested outside the program and the same thing happens. Try the following code in a buffer other than scratch:
 (with-current-buffer "*scratch*" (forward-line)) 
 It should switch temporarily to scratch, call forward-line and switch back. It doesn't do anything on my machine, even with emacs -q (no personal config file).
 I'm on 30.0.50.
 TIA!

 Has anyone published a list of flags for Scala 3? (Scala 3.3).
 Last time I used Scala 3 (3.0), a lot of options were missing. Has Scala 3.3 bridge the gap?
 I'm planning to try to upgrade one of our projects at work but looking for feedbacks on this before. A lot of these flags are mandatory to get the full power/safety of Scala IMHO.

 I spent few hours checking the job market for Scala jobs in Data Engineering (I'm a Data Engineer). But daaaaaaamn I really thought Scala/Spark was way more a thing! It's really all PySpark now. What a disappointment 😢 Especially with Scala 3, honestly any data engineer who knows Python could easily write Spark job in Scala. 
 Hard to find the motivation to keep learning FP in Scala when the Scala opportunities are so limited. I guess it will teach me FP so that's good. But there's a depressing vibe to it.
 I guess only very big tech companies or banks or companies still relying on a on-premise infra may still use Scala.

I tried doom for a few days, but i couldn't get anything near the experience i had in Vim. i couldn't even enable syntax highlighting for the different programming languages i use, so i would like to ask for any helpful resources about how to configure emacs as an IDE, videos, articles, books, well documented configs would be helpful Thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm wondering if it's possible to use dir-locals, projectile, or some other scheme in order to map major modes to certain file types conditionally. Specifically, when working on static site generator projects, I routinely need markdown files to not only use web-mode (which I wouldn't normally use for markdown), but I need web-mode to set its templating language to something specific. I'm not quite sure how to do this. With dir-locals, I'm afraid modifying the auto-mode-alist would leave it in a bad state if and when I move onto a different repo. Meanwhile, projectile doesn't seem to have a clean way to hook into changing project types (unless you do it manually). Any suggestions?

This package isn't for end-users, it's for others who are writing llm-based functionality to do so in a way that is agnostic of the llm backend. That way the user can use the LLM they have access to. LLMs are "large language models", very large systems that are able to deal with natural language with surprising naturalness.
 To start, we provide functionality for creating embeddings, and for LLM chat, in both sync and async versions. There are only two providers to start with: Open AI and Google Cloud Vertex. There's obviously more that are possible, such as Anthropic's API, or Llama 2.
 The difficulties with providing an interface to Llama 2, by the way, is that there seem to be a lot of different ways to install and use it, so it isn't clear that there's a good interface I could provide that would be widely useful. But it's pretty easy to write your own, and maybe I'll provide an interface that just goes to some command-line utility and executes it.
 If you are an author of a package that does something with LLMs, I'd encourage you to use this package, so your users can have some control of what backend they are using. And if you want to help expand the number of LLMs we have access to, please send a pull request if you have FSF papers. This is a GNU project, so FSF papers are required for substantial contributions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[MisTTY is a major mode for Emacs 29.1 and up that runs a shell inside of a buffer. It is built on top of term.el. It is available on MELPA. Check out its project page at https://github.com/szermatt/mistty.
 Such a buffer feels very much like comint mode: you can move around freely and run any Emacs command you want - until you press TAB and end up with the native completion or notice the shell autosuggestions. With MisTTY you have access to both Emacs and the shell commands and editing tools.
 Additionally, commands that take over the entire screen, such as less or vi also work, temporarily taking over the window, while scrollback remains available in another buffer.
 MisTTY works well with Bash and ZSH, but it is especially well suited to running the Fish shell; you get autosuggestions, and completions in full colors.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[hello guys, its me ya boi again 
 I'm new to Haskell and this subreddit. I was reading Learn You a Haskell and stumbled across this operator -: here, 
  
Haskell ghci> landLeft 2 (landRight 1 (landLeft 1 (0,0))) (3,1)  When we apply the function landLeft 1 to (0,0) we get (1,0). Then, we land a bird on the right side, resulting in (1,1). Finally two birds land on the left side, resulting in (3,1). We apply a function to something by first writing the function and then writing its parameter, but here it would be better if the pole went first and then the landing function. If we make a function like this: haskell x -: f = f x  We can apply functions by first writing the parameter and then the function: haskell ghci> 100 -: (*3) 300 ghci> True -: not False ghci> (0,0) -: landLeft 2 (2,0)  By using this, we can repeatedly land birds on the pole in a more readable manner: haskell ghci> (0,0) -: landLeft 1 -: landRight 1 -: landLeft 2 (3,1) 
  
according to my expert research at this point in time there was no pipe operator in Haskell, so I looked up and found this page.
 here two operators are mentioned -: and :-, used together, could allow us also use expression in infix notation, instead of just functions.
 I checked in ghci and there are no such operators available. are these old operators that were removed? what's their story?

 Fairly high contrast, but with a subtle colour palette
  
I find a lot of dark themes are either low contrast, or the colour palette is mainly based on simple bright primary colours which I personally dislike.
 Anyone use a theme that sounds like it might fit the bill?

 I was using GHC and a Makefile to compile and run and making a new file for every "day". Eventually I wanted to use splitOn so I made a cabal project. Then I found out it automatically loads your modules into the repl with cabal repl which is sick. 
 Unfortunately I'm trying to work in modules/day3.hs and import rund3 to Main.hs and run it. However Cabal can't see my non exported functions inside modules/day3.hs. this is a bit unfortunate.
 Solution I can think of is working inside Main then transferring to a different file when I'm done but maybe there's a totally different set up that works better?

 I'm planning to learn more in-depth about FP in Scala.
 After I understand the FP basics, would you recommend I dive into cats or perhaps it's advisable to have some experience with "native" Scala first before digging into Cats or ZIO?
 I have no clue how overwhelming those libraries can be for a developer with very limited experience with FP.

 It uses a PPX macro which reads the raw SQL string before compilation and asks Postgres server for the data type which will be returned when the SQL would actually be executed. This way OCaml knows the return type of each SQL query even if they are just pure SQL.
 Is there anything similar for Scala? I searched quickly for Scala SQL libraries but they don't seem to provide both raw SQL usage and high type safety.

 About 75% of my configuration was plain sailing. Most of the remaining 25% is related to completions. 
 One massive problem I have is the *completions* minibuffer. I hate it. 
 I don't want a minibuffer for completions. I'm trying to bend company to my needs. But the *completions* minibuffer pops up anyway. And when it does, it is very intrusive. It changes the layout of my frames. And when I make it go away, the buffer that I'm working in is repositioned. 
 At the moment, it is the bane of my workflow. I'm working on a complex set of problems that require a lot of focus. And having my frames re-arranged unpredictably messes with my head. 
 My understanding is that the *completions* minifbuffer can't be removed. Is there a way to prevent it from being invoked?

 What are these special comments? It seems suspiciously similar to the above that I mentioned in seeing someone's init file (whose style I copied) and it has an actual effect (when removed, the Elisp/d comes back instead of Elisp/l). Is there docs on these?
 Stylistically, these make me recall the sh shebangs, like #!/bin/sh.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm working on a long writing piece which I'd like to organize and edit in Emacs, but large swathes of it have already been written in LibreOffice Writer. There are plenty of italics and bolded keywords throughout the text and I can't find an easy, pre-existing way to preserve them in Org mode markup.
 So far it seems the easiest means of automating this would be to dump the clipboard contents to an HTML file or other suitable in between and then write a script to process it into Org mode markup, but that seems ludicrous. I'd use Bash because that's what I know—I can't find a preexisting solution in Emacs elisp. There is a very, very old .odt importer called odt2org and it requires a now obsolete version of Python which I'd like to avoid setting up. 
 Literally copy/yanking the text from Writer into a text-file, and manually copying the italics would be faster. Am I missing something? I see lots about exporting from Emacs, but what about preserving formatting into Emacs? If there's a means which includes formatting headers, block quotes into #+begin_quote/#+end_quote tags etc, that'd be perfect but I'll settle for just italics and bold.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am writing a big calculator. This calculator has many, many inputs and many, many outputs. My fundamental type is a Partner. Conceptually it makes sense to associate both inputs and outputs with a Partner. Also, some of the outputs are both important on their own and as inputs to later parts of the calculation.
 My question is: how do I architect this in Haskell? I can imagine having a big Partner record type that has a field for each input and each output. The downside of this is I'd have to initialize it with empty values for all the outputs. Would I then make those a Maybe type? That might get annoying.
 Do I instead define a separate type for each new output as it's calculated? Say we start with just a PartnerInput object that only holds the inputs. Then we calculate the first output and put the result in a PartnerInputAndFirstOutput object. I.e. the first function has type PartnerInput -> PartnerInputAndFirstOutput. Then the next function has type PartnerInputAndFirstOutput -> PartnerInputAndSecondOutput, and so on. Intuitively this feels silly.
 Like any good Haskeller I want to use the type system to help guarantee the correctness of my code, but I can't figure out how in this case. I'm interested to hear your thoughts.

 After much documentation reading and searching I ended up using C-u 49 C-f to move the cursor 49 days forward. How clever! 🤓
 Similarly, we can also use: - C-n, forward week - M-}, forward month - C-x ], forward year

 IWindow is an interactive window choosing and switching package, similar to Ace Window. Why not Ace Window? Because I use EXWM, and Ace Window's window highlighting (which uses Avy) doesn't work with EXWM buffers. I needed something more customizable, and IWindow was borned. By default it uses mode line to show window selection keys.

 With this, I can write in org mode...
 #+caption: Lorem impsum dolor #+attr_latex: :options \centering #+begin_figure [[subfig:example-image-a][Caption of A >(width=0.3\textwidth)]] [[subfig:example-image-b][Caption of B >(width=0.3\textwidth)]] [[subfig:example-image-c][Caption of C >(width=0.6\textwidth)]] #+end_figure 
 and have it transcoded to latex like...
 \begin{figure} \centering \subcaptionbox{Caption of A}{\includegraphics[width=0.2\textwidth]{example-image-a}} \quad \subcaptionbox{Caption of B}{\includegraphics[width=0.2\textwidth]{example-image-b}} \subcaptionbox{Caption of C}{\includegraphics[width=0.2\textwidth]{example-image-c}} \quad \end{figure} 
 I am wondering if it is possible to automatically automatically wrap consecutive subfigures in a centered figure environment, and add the space separator between them, ie. I want to be able to write just...
 [[subfig:example-image-a][Caption of A >(width=0.3\textwidth)]] [[subfig:example-image-b][Caption of B >(width=0.3\textwidth)]] [[subfig:example-image-c][Caption of C >(width=0.6\textwidth)]] 
 and have it transcode the same way as it does above.

 Any help is appreciated. Thank you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was using Emacs 27.1 on Ubuntu recently, and then I made the switch to Debian 12 and Emacs 28.2. Emacs 28.2 gave me a ton of warnings about the packages I was using (managed with straight.el). I thought that was weird, so I built Emacs 29.1. All the warnings disappeared after that!
 I'm not an experienced user, so I wanted to ask here why some versions of Emacs seem to dislike my init.el and other versions are fine with it. Is there a way to avoid this in the future?

 ​
 Is there any way to publish a .org file to HTML but showing the record of time invested in an activity?
 Today I use .org files for tracktime in my projects. And I publish them in HTML for my clients to access. But in some cases the "Clock table" is not enough because it summarizes everything and I cannot highlight the time invested in specific tasks by highlighting the days I worked.
 To get around this I am using two sections of "Clock Tables", one summarizing everything and in the second section several "clock tables", one per day (as shown in the print). But this format has proven confusing for some of my clients.
 I would like the daily log to appear in the HTML, the simple format of :logbook: would be interesting, but whenever I export it it is hidden.
 Thank you very much in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I found this interesting concept on Howard Abrams' web page:
 https://howardism.org/Technical/Emacs/new-window-manager.html
 TLDR: he launches Emacs in fullscreen with xinitrc, but without EXWM. He uses xterm to start other applications such as firefox.
 I use Emacs with Sway, but I was wondering if anybody here is using Emacs as a window manager without EXWM or in some deeper synergy with some other minimal window manager. I have used EXWM and I already know what are the good and what are the bad parts. So I am interested in alternative ways in which Emacs can be used as a window manager.
 Another cool concept is here: http://perma-curious.eu/repo-ewx/
 Another window manager that could integrate well with Emacs, and perhaps even re-create the EXWM experience by writing some glue code in Elisp, could be river: https://github.com/riverwm/river
 I am collecting ideas so please feel free to share how Emacs integrates or controls your window manager.
 Thank you.

 I thought of two possible solutions:
  
Use IORef to have a reference to the object. I do not really like the idea, because my object gets passed along a lot and having an IORef somehow destroys the beauty of it.
 Make a lazy infinit list of the widgets and then just append the next one on button clicked and this way force it to get created (need to keep track of the times clicked of course). I tried something like widgets <- sequen…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This question is pretty niche. ;)
 I use lsp-mode with eldoc support enabled. When I move my cursor over something, a one line description of the signature (or whatever) appears in the minibuffer via eldoc. That's great.
 However when I jump to definitions via xref or avy, the eldoc message doesn't appear. As a workaround I move the cursor forward one character and back to get it to appear. 
 To fix the xref problems I added:
 (eldoc-add-command #'xref-find-definitions) (eldoc-add-command #'xref-go-back) 
 Now when I jump to or back via xref, the eldoc message appears right away.
 However I can't get it to work for avy-goto-word-1 and friends. I tried adding avy-goto-word-1, avy-goto-char and such to eldoc-message-commands via eldoc-add-command as above, but it didn't help.
 How can I get eldoc messages to immediately appear after using avy commands like avy-goto-char, avy-goto-word-1, etc?

 https://github.com/aripiprazole/rinha-de-compiler/blob/main/files/combination.json

 1) I tried Circe, but I keep hitting the inlining limit with the Function term. I tried increasing but it still persists.
 2) I tried uPickle but couldn't find a way to parse partially tagged records (program and location are not tagged, the rest of the structs are) 
 How would you solve that problem? Write it manually or there is another workaround?

 I discovered I can use desktop-change-dir to load a specific session that previously saved in your project directory by using desktop-save to create a .emacs.desktop in the directory that you choose. 
 I could read that it should work by starting emacs from the directory to load the .emacs.desktop in the directory where you launched emacs, but it doesn't work (Desktop-save-mode is set). 
 To have it loaded, I need to always use desktop-change-dir after to have started emacs.
 Also, I tried to add in configuration, but not work too : 
 (setq desktop-path '(".")) 
 Do you know a way to have it working ?

 I've been told that Macbooks can be a bit troublesome when it comes to some aspects of coding in general and that its almost always more convenient in Windows. For those who code in Haskell on Macs; are there actually any problems installing Haskell and if there are, can it be fixed easily?
 The reason I highlighted M1 and M2 is because people with Intel cores do not seem to have any problems with installing GHCup (from what I know).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A few years ago I worked in a company that was AWS-based and we had some libraries that were basically Scala wrappers around the Java AWS sdk's. I remember things like really testing if, for example, I had really written some code that calls on dynamodb to get an item was a bit of a PITA... Any ways to reduce the time to get feedback on whether your code is actually doing what you want it to do when working on the Cloud?
 I'm planning on using zio-aws (which seems to cover everything I need to use for now: Cognito, Dynamodb, Elastic Beanstalk, maybe Elastic Load Balancer), but I want to test whether I created my tables properly, if I'm adding and fetching items properly, etc. Is actually deploying the app and running it on the cloud the only way, or is there a way to run it locally and test the service implementations?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi.
 I'm new to emacs, getting used to it. I am trying to use emacs for my personal note writing, but also I'd like to use some of those notes as slides for a presentation with org-present. I want to customize how the presentation mode looks. Trying to follow someone else's work I figured I could create a function that changes the theme when launching org-present. When writing the notes, I use leuven theme (I selected it in customize-themes, and saved to use it by default). This is nice. Now, when I do org-present, my function is called. It just does:
 (defun my_slides () (load-theme 'some_theme)) 
 And effectively the background and most colors for text change, except for the headings. They are still in leuven theme. If I manually do customize-themes, then pick the theme I want to use, THEN, do org-present, then the headings appear in the theme I picked. So, what's the difference between load-theme and customize-themes-->pick one theme? How can I effectively change the theme to enter in org-present?
 Thanks in advance, any help appreciated.
 EDIT: Solved.
 u/Nawrbit's hint worked perfectly. In case it's useful for anyone now I have this in my init.el
 ;; Function to change default theme to the theme I want in presentation mode (defun start_slide () (unload-theme 'leuven) (load-theme 'material)) ;; Function to revert to my default theme when exiting presentation mode (defun exit_slide () (unload-theme 'material) (load-theme 'leuven)) ;; Call start_slide function when doing org-present (add-hook 'org-present-mode-hook 'start_slide) ;; Call exit_slide function when exiting org-present (add-hook 'org-present-mode-quit-hook 'exit_slide) 
 Thank you all for your suggestions!

 brew install d12frosted/emacs-plus/emacs-plus@29 --with-ctags --with-debug --with-imagemagick --with-native-comp --with-no-frame-refocus --with-poll --with-xwidgets --with-modern-sexy-v2-icon 
 My first clue that something was wrong was seeing additional Fundamental mode buffers created with names that followed this pattern: *emacs* and *emacs:err*. The *emacs* buffer was trying to run something, but has a configuration issue as indicated by this message in the buffer:
 Lisp expression: Git variable `github.user' is unset. Set to: 
 and the *emacs:error* buffer contains no information, but is indicated as related to emacs stderr open in the output of counsel-buffer.
 I believe it has something to do with the async behavior, as I see the following when I examine the process table. Over time the number of extra processes continues to grow.
 ❯ ps auxwww | grep -i emacs | grep -v grep iain 15092 0.1 1.9 411753376 158400 ??

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In writing a bit of haskell, I've come across this problem more than once. Consider the following example: 
 {-# LANGUAGE GADTSyntax #-} import Data.Kind (Type) data Foo :: Type where Bar1 :: {f :: String, g :: Integer} -> Foo Bar2 :: {f :: String, g :: Integer, h :: Double, l :: Double} -> Foo deriving (Eq) 
 ​
 Bar1 and Bar2 have a common "core" (f and g), but Bar2 extends on it by adding the fields h and l. In the way I see it, it makes functions that deal with Foo a little more of a hassle to write, since the fields f and h wouldn't be total for all values of Foo, making me resort to the Either and/or Maybe monads. 
 One way to avoid this would be turning Foo into a typeclass that abstract the common features of Bar1 and Bar2 and turning Bar1 and Bar2 themselves into types.
 The downside would be that I wouldn't be able to use pattern matching as easily and it would be harder to rely on the compiler to tell me when functions don't deal with all the possible values in the domain of Foo. Also, things that I could do to both constructors at once (like deriving an Ord instance for both of them) would be alot more verbose to do. And, if I decided to collect them in some sort of list, I would have to deal with heterogeneously typed lists.
 ​
 Anyway, maybe this is too much of a beginner question, but I'd like to hear from you possible ideas to solve this.

 This works fine with a 2 level headline view of the current file about 14 days into the month. At the beginning of the month, I need to switch back to the month before as well. Is there any way to give a headline view of the current and previous file, so I can scroll up/down this and go to the corresponding place in the file? Similar to what agenda-view can do with todos with follow-mode, but showing all headlines in a specific small set of org-mode files, ordered by their appearance in those files?

Another installment of the What Are You Working On? thread.
Ideas I'm thinking about:
The Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis and Linguistic Relativity. Together, these ideas present the notion that language shapes experience. Maybe I have a warped understanding of this. This is obvious when considering self-talk. The language we use when we talk to ourselves dictates our moods, affect, actions, behaviors, and total experience. This is good news. Changing how we talk to ourselves and the stories we tell ourselves will change our experience—the role of methodeutic language or 'speculative rhetoric' as it steers cognitive understanding of the world.
I'm a judgment machine. Comparisons and self-criticism are sneaky and ubiquitous. I'm not talking about "I'm a failure." I'm talking about "Shouldn't I spend more time exercising, in the outdoors, walking, zettelkasting?" and other subtle ways I self-evaluate and am critical of my behavior.
Push above what I think is my "reading level" to achieve mastery by reading more books that present more profound ideas. If I want to understand bigger ideas, I must read books with greater ideas to grasp the deeper concepts essential for remarkable achievements. It's not enough to read a lot. To do extraordinary things, I must read books that stretch my mind.

I keep forgetting the correct argument and parameter names, and it would be useful for me to have a similar behaviour as (org-set-property) for this use case.
 My desired behaviour:
  
Set point in or at a source block (special block in general)
 Enter C-c C-x p (this maps to (org-set-property))
 Get a list of properties, select the property, RET
 Get a list of allowed parameters, select the correct one, RET
  
The property is now added to the special block, in this case the source block. 
 The current behaviour:
 In the current implementation of (org-set-property) a property is set to the header under which my source block is placed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Per the title, what is your strategy for decluttering your .emacs.d folder?
 I generally like to follow the XDG Base Directory Spec because I like to separate the code that configures the program (emacs) from any installed packages, language-servers, etc. 
 I have hacked together a solution to force emacs to use .cache/emacs/ where appropriate, but I'm wondering if that is worth the hassle. It seems like many packages want to default to using user-emacs-directory when they need to add files, which I agree is a sensible default, but I find it a bit cluttered when I want to edit my config.
 Curious what others think / do in their configs

 However when I run git, treesitter (mostly python and yaml, with some md) after a while I get an error about too many open pipes. 
 Also, if I compile it with aot native compilation it segfaults when I open any file under git, fine without native compiler.
 Is this a known issue? Is there a fix I need to do in mingw64?
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So in these days I came across "Thinking with Types" and the first part blew my mind. In particular, the Curry-Howard isomorphism really caught my interest, but I need help to know if I'm getting it correctly. What I've understood is that we can prove mathematical theorems through CH, for example to prove that a * 1 = a we just need to show that there is an isomorphism (hence, 2 functions that are one the inverse of the other) between (a, ()) and a. This gave me chills, so I wanted to try this way of reasoning with a theorem for natural numbers, but I'm stuck. In particular, I would like to prove that given two natural numbers m,n the GCD of m,n is the same as the GCD of (m mod n) and n. Again, here there is an equality so I think I would have to show there is an isomorphism between the two things. But I can't really imagine how to translate something like that in Haskell, and I'm not even sure if this is actually possible.
 P.S. As a side note, I also wanted to prove that there is no isomorphism between a set X and its power set, but imagining to prove that something doesn't exist with CH is even more complicated for me.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all. I currently use neovim as my IDE and note taking application along with mdbook. I use markdown for notes. Prior to this when I was on windows I used obsidian for that purpose. 
 I really liked the philosophy behind obsidian and bidirectional linking. However, ever since I started using Linux I feel the need of avoiding closed source applications. I've seen people use OrgMode and I believe I really like the extensibility. I also like the TODO/scheduling features of OrgMode and the Android app that syncs with it. For that I use calcurse atm. 
 I want to use Emacs solely for the purpose of using OrgRoam alone. That's it. I don't want to go down another rabbit hole of configuration and tinkering (the previous ones being neovim, sway, kitty and gnome in order of recency). I need vim keybinds, a decent syntax highlighting for orgmode, git version control and a dark low contrast colouscheme. I believe OrgMode can already do what markdown does and probably better, so no worries there. 
 What is the best plan of action for this? Thanks a lot for helping me out and I apologise if this sounds too stuck up/opinionated but I really cannot afford to go down that rabbit hole and I am looking for a (relatively) quick solution (preferably doable within a day). Once again, thanks a lot!

 The issue seems to be that there is no 'compat-autoloads' file to be found in the compat-29.1.4.2 directory, which is the latest version downloaded directly from elpa. I haven't been able to locate any information on this.

 Just today at work I did few small commits, then later on tweaked message from one commit, added few lines of code to the other. Searches to the log, see diffstats, patch contents and all... simple rebase there, small diff there... push to the upstream, all without sweat. Magit makes work feel like play.

 I don't know why it calls rustfmt with the "--edition 2021" arguments.
 The command rustic-format in rustic-mode runs just "rustfmt" with no issues.
 I already had rustfmt install via rustup.
 I wanted to switch from rustic-mode to rust-ts-mode but this is forcing me to stay with rustic-mode for now.
 Any suggestions?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone,
 I would like to share the tree-sitter major-modes verilog-ts-mode and vhdl-ts-mode for FPGA & ASIC design and verification:
  
https://github.com/gmlarumbe/verilog-ts-mode/
 https://github.com/gmlarumbe/vhdl-ts-mode/
  
For the time being they provide the following features:
  
Syntax highlighting
 Indentation
 imenu
 which-func
 Navigation functions
 Beautify functions
 Basic completion at point
  
They are derived from verilog-mode and vhdl-mode respectively, making the switch simpler by having features like Verilog AUTOs or VHDL beautifying still available.
 Both are available on MELPA and MELPA Stable.
 Looking forward to receiving some feedback!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I set up rust debugging in emacs using dap-mode and gdb and the debugging itsleft is working perfectly, however I can't seem to figure out how to set the file to debug so it stops asking me every time. In my launch.json I set the debug binary in "program", but that doesn't seem to have an effect, I have tried with and without variables, using absolute and relative paths and nothing seems to work. So is there an emacs variable or something that I can set in my .dir-locals.el to point to the file so when I start debugging it finds the file automatically?
 ​
 This is how my launch.json looks like:
 { "type": "gdb", "request": "launch", "name": "Debug", "program": "PATH_TO_PROJECT_ROOT/target/debug/BINARY_NAME", "gdbpath": "rust-gdb", "args": [], "cwd": "PATH_TO_PROJECT_ROOT", "preRun": [], "postRun": [], "stopAtEntry": false, "serverStarted": "INFO" } 
 The all caps parts are substituting for the actual paths, but some folders include "-"s in them if that makes a difference

So it seems Emacs does not respect my user umask setting. Does it need to be exported as an ENV variable and made visible to Emacs in some way? TIA.

 I've been using Emacs for several years now. I've recently switched to emacs-lucid from emacs-gtk because it's supposed to be a bit more stable and because I don't want to use a Gtk app in my Qt-based environment. However, I have a minor but annoying issue with some GUI elements (namely, menus and tooltips) being blurry. They kinda look like they have been shrunk and then stretched again, if it makes any sense. Interestingly, this applies only to 1st level menus, 2nd level menus are always rendered properly.
 Is there anything I can do to fix this issue?
 Screenshot showing the issue: https://imgur.com/a/EDodgK1 You can see that the 1st level menu is blurry while the 2nd level menu is as crisp as potato chips.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm currently reading the book written by Bird & Wadler and trying to solve some exercises about foldl, foldr, etc.. I ran into a problem 3.5.6 that I don't know how to solve. The problem is as follows:
 Given a list xs = [x_1, x_2, ..., x_n] of numbers, the sequence of successive maxima (ssm xs) is the longest subsequence [x_j_1 , x_j_2 , . . . , x_j_m] such that j_1 = 1 and x_j < x_j_k for j < j_k. For example, the sequence of successive maxima of [3, 1, 3, 4, 9, 2, 10, 7] is [3, 4, 9, 10]. Define ssm in terms of foldl.
 I wonder how to solve this? The authors in this chapter mention many identities with foldl, foldr, map (the three duality theorems about foldl and foldr are mentioned), but I don't know how to use it in solving this problem. Any help?

I tried using vscode-icons in conjunction with dired-sidebar and they were a bit too big (literally) and plain and non-subtle for me. I like the style of all-the-icons, but I want consistency (directories and files, one icon for each, and that's it). How can I make that happen?
 The regular "file" and "folder" icons would be ideal.

I found the only theme that respected the terminal's background opacity was the default one, except when using kitty, so I guess you're good if you're a kitty user.
 On a whim, I opened up the theme.el for the theme I'm using, and added a value in brackets at the beginning of the rgb value for the background, like setting the alpha value for urxvt's background in ~/.Xdefaults. Afterwards I noticed the value in the brackets didn't matter, and could actually be left empty, like so:
 "[]#000000"
 Different themes will have different names for the main background. Luckily it was labeled "bg-main" on mine.
 P.S.: You have to edit the system-wide theme.el. Changing the one in ~/.local didn't work for me. Also, emacs will use whatever transparency value you have set for your terminal (like I said, the value in the brackets above does not matter). And remember to restart the server for the changes to take place.

 After successfully compiling gcc w/ jit (didn't get any errors that were related to jit), I tried to configure emacs with --native-compilation which failed at the jit section.
 These pass:
 gcc_jit_context_acquire in -lgccjit... yes libgccjit.h usability... yes libgccjit.h presence... yes checking for libgccjit.h... yes 
 Then it fails when it tries to run the test program
 So when I run the libgccjit tutorial example myself, I get
 ld: cannot find crtbeginS.o: No such file or directory ld: cannot find -lgcc: No such file or directory ld: cannot find -lgcc\_s: No such file or directory libgccjit.so: error: error invoking gcc driver 
 I have tried to search for these errors and can't find anything. I also can find crtbegin in my gcc src, but it's not in the built.
 I used the default gcc7 that was already installed on the system, so maybe i need to recompile gcc-13 using gcc-11?
 ​
 The crtbeginS.o is located under install_dir/lib/gcc/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/13.2.0 which install_dir/lib is appended to my LD_LIBRARY_PATH... so...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm switching to eglot from lsp-mode, and I'm getting an unexpected indentation in C# code. I have a minimal editorconfig file that just sets indent_size to 2. Things seem fine until I hit a semicolon, at which point the current line and the next line both get indented further than they should. Here's a before:
 public static class Stuff { public static T DoAThing<T>(T obj) { Console.WriteLine(obj) } } 
 And here's what happens when I hit semicolon: 
 public static class Stuff { public static T DoAThing<T>(T obj) { Console.WriteLine(obj); } } 
 Looking at the help for ;, I see that it's bound to c-electric-semi&comma, and if eglot isn't running, setting c-syntactic-indentation to nil does what I would expect, but when I turn on eglot, the indentation goes wrong. Am I missing something?

 In a previous post, I announced the first draft of a proposal for a community-owned cryptography project, and asked for feedback, of which I received plenty. I'd like to thank everyone that has given their thoughts so far, and the proposal has been updated in turn to reflect that :)
  
Increased prominence of deliverable items (esp unit tests) in proposal
 Performance benefit section has been added to Problem Statement
 Test vectors for algorithms (esp CAVP / FIPS / NIST) added to Optional Deliverables
  
Today I am happy to announce the final draft of the Botan / Cryptography Community Project Proposal. Barring any changes, I plan to officially submit the proposal to the Haskell Foundation on Monday, and I am now asking for any last feedback, opinions, thoughts, and criticisms that anyone might want to sneak in at the last moment.
  
Project update
 In addition to the proposal itself, we have the following updates to the libraries themselves as well:
  
Good progress has been made on Botan.Low.Cipher, which is now properly complete
 Unit tests for Botan.Low.Cipher
 Unit tests revealed that botan_cipher_output_length is inaccurate / flawed
 Corrected buffer estimate functions have been implemented to replace it
 Implemented offline / one-shot and online / incremental encryption
 Online encryption should be much more performant since you can stream the data instead of having to load it all at once
 Some cipher algorithms (SIV, CCM) are not online-capable, and their unit tests fail for the moment, but that is expected behavior (better organized unit tests will fix this)
  
 You can follow the project devlog on discourse!

 I'm new to Haskell so I myself am not completely aware of all the typeclasses, I was wondering if there are any resources I could refer to?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[TL;DR: beOrg "sync"d with a workingfolder folder keeps around items from files that have been "removed", appears not to actually work from the data in the linked folder. (removed is in quotes because beOrg doesn't use filenames but file titles in the UI).
 More info/tests: (this may be a bug report, but hoping for a workaround)
 - Changing the /title/ of an org files results in massive dupes in the agenda. beOrg uses the title and not the filename, and it appears to screw with some local caching.
 - Unlinking the working folder doesn't change the data at all, so it's clearly operating from a separate cache. (and can't sync to remove files since you can't sync without a linked dir). So don't see a way to delete the old data and then just reparse the liked folder.
 - Can't just delete the file in question from beOrgs files (and then readd) since then it wants to remove it from the repo also. Using titles to operate on files is a really bad idea it appears.
 - Syncing doesn't seem to sync, it just adds. 
 - Since the issue is with the title and not filename I have no clue how to remove the old refs, since you can't delete the old file or anything.
 - I would anticipate similar problems with any reorg/refiling of items across files since it seems a totally non-destructive sync.
 ​
 So, does anyone have any ideas if there is a setting hidden somewhere? The next step would be uninstall/kill cache and see how it goes, but that's really no good since I like to be able to (re)organize my data. Just archiving seems like it would make beOrg break.
 Thanks for any tips or help. I'm so close to having my orgGenda on my phone.

 This series of articles explains how authors can use Emacs to research, write and publish articles, books, movie scripts and websites. No software development, only writing.
 It is a work in progress, feedback appreciated. Hope to eventually write a book on the topic - written and published in Emacs of course ;)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am using emacs in Archlinux. I observe that the "XF86AudioLowerVolume" key in emacs -Q is recognized as "C-g," but in other applications, this key functions normally. I'm not using any external tools to map keys, so I suspect that Emacs is by default translating the "XF86AudioLowerVolume" key to "C-g". Is there any config option or compile option to disable this behavior? Any help on how to solve this or debug this would be very helpful. Thank you!

  data Flow (d :: FlowDirection) where InFlow :: Money -> Frequency -> DateRange -> Flow 'Positive OutFlow :: Money -> Frequency -> DateRange -> Flow 'Negative deriving Typeable 
 and I'm trying to construct a quasiquoter for a simple DSL to construct these, for which I need a Data instance (to be able to use liftData).
 The problem I get is basically that 'Positive (or 'Negative) don't match each other e.g. in gunfold, so I can neither derive the instance nor work out how to write one by hand.
 Is it possible to define a Data (Flow a) instance (or perhaps there's a way around the problem by not using liftData at all)?

ChatGPT said it's a Emacs Lisp Dump (ELD) file, but I didn't get any search results on google with that either so I'm skeptical of ChatGPT's explanation.
 I'd like to know if there are any documentations on this.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have used emacs, mu4e, offlineimap, and smtpmail as my mail client for many years with my work's exchange/office365 email system.
 Recently, they made yet another change and now I'm struggling to authenticate smtpmail to send mail. I can successfully download mail with offlineimap, but not send. 
 I've used M365-imap on github to generate the refresh and access tokens to do oauth2 with the outlook servers. Previously, I could do a basic password to sent SMTP. Now, I need to use oauth2 with SMTP and use the access token generated by a python script in M365-imap. (I just put this token in my .authinfo file as the password for the server and specify oauth2 as the authentication method). Problem is, this access token only works once or twice before I have to regenerate it.
 The M365-imap page gives an example sendmail configuration where the passwordeval option is used to fetch a password from the output of the access token script. I need to do the same kind of thing in my authinfo configuration, but I don't see an equivalent option. Is this possible?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It used to work just right some time ago, I had Vertico and Consult, and find-file used to open a Vertico style vertical autocomplete. At one point (possibly after adding a lot of packages to my init), I noticed that every time I restart Emacs, it reverts back to ido-mode style autocomplete. I need to turn off ido-mode explicitly every time I start Emacs, to get back to Vertico style.
 I don't know when that started happening, so I can't pinpoint after which package that is. Init is a bit extensive so I will not post it here. 
 Off the tops of your heads, do you maybe know any familiar package that does this under the hood? I have not enabled ido-mode explicitly anywhere in my init. It must be some package that does it.
 Also, is there a package that can act as a debugger for emacs? So I can track the order of command executions and trace where ido-mode is enabled and in which package? Is there any better way to solve this short of disabling package-by-package?

However, I noticed that autocompletion is not working as intended. May I ask what's the standard/correct approach to setup emacs for Scala development? I added (scala +lsp) in my init.el, no extra configuration, so I wonder if I'm missing something. I'd appreciate any further help or suggestions. Thanks :)

 So if that's you, maybe you use a moonlander with colemak or something, do you have a placement for the modifier and programming punctuation keys that you like? Or know of a resource where this is worked on?

The constraints also share many of the same types that are generated by long type functions. I would like to be able to define some type variables withing the synonym instead of having them be parameters and mucking up the function's type signature.
 Currently, I am using something like
 type ABC a b = (b ~ TypeFunc a, AnotherConstraint b) 
 but would much prefer
 type ABC a = forall b. (b ~ TypeFunc a, AnotherConstraint b) 
 Is there a way to accomplish this or a similar solution?
 so that b does not need to be defined in the external context.

 [[:digit:]] as explained does work. Together with \sc which has no means to match digits this all confuses me anyhow as I am used to \d but well.
 What is the preferred way to match digits with Emacs regex syntax?

 I finally decided I want to stop pretending like I know Haskell and actually learn it. I just got done reading A Gentle Introduction to Haskell which I liked a lot. I'd love more resources like that which are relatively concise but which go deeper and cover more of the language. Is there anything like that? I guess I could read the spec - I actually like reading language specifications, sort of, but I massively prefer something a bit more curated. I also have a project planned to get hands-on experience with the language but I like reading and personally I find that the best way to develop a mental model of a language.

 (defun elisp (form) (drakma:http-request "http://localhost:9005" :method :post :content-type "text/plain" :additional-headers `(("password" . ,(car (uiop:read-file-lines "phoenix/emacs-password")))) :content (format nil "~S" form))) (defun open-in-buffer (filename) (let ((form `(switch-to-buffer (find-file-noselect ,filename nil nil nil)))) (elisp form))) 
 ```
 ... and the same call with CURL, with filename="~/notes/
  curl -d "(SWITCH-TO-BUFFER (FIND-FILE-NOSELECT \"~/notes/\" nil nil nil))" -X POST -H "Content-Type: text/plain" -H "password: password123" http://localhost:9005 
 I'm using a custom auth header, because basic auth with emacs web server was difficult to get working. Also, it's less likely to get hacked.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Please forgive this brief bout of introspection.
 I noticed that after a full workday with emacs, I am not exhausted, whilst after a full workday with anything that makes me click or drag or use arrow keys, I am knackered. 
 I look forward to working in emacs. I dread and procrastinate working with other tools, no matter how good otherwise. E.g., Mathematica and IntelliJ products are great, but they wear me out.
 I chalk this up to "mental cache misses:"
 If I can leave my hands on the home row of an ANSI keyboard, everything stays "in-cache" and I get flow-go. If I must reach for a pointing device or arrow keys, I get a "muscle-memory cache miss." If I must take my eyes off the cursor to go hunting around menus or dialog boxes, I get "visual cache misses."
 I guess I learned 1-dimensional work habits from reading books. I don't do well with video learning. Scanning back and forth in a video to review info is like hunting around for menus and dialog boxes; it wears me out. I do better if I treat a video like an in-person lecture and take linear notes with pen and paper.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello!
 First of all, here is my current setup: Emacs installed via snap using Doom Emacs, TexLab (installed via cargo), latex enabled in Doom emacs with +lsp and +latexmk. The LaTeX LSP is working fine, and when I compile a document that needs pdflatex, it works.
 When I compile a document that requires LuaLatex, it asks me if I want to use the LuaTex engine. And when I click yes, it says this: LaTeX: problems after [0] pages and does not compile at all. I am able to compile the document by compiling it in the terminal, so the document is not the problem.
 Any ideas on how to get this working? I am not able to use XeLatex either. The distro I am using is Pop!_OS 22.04. 
 EDIT: More details! I press M-x and run LaTex-command-selection. When I select LaTex option from the menu, I get asked if I want to use LuaTex, and when I press y I get the issue. The same thing when I select the LatexMk option. I have a .latexmkrc file in the project directory as well with the contents: $pdflatex = 'lualatex';
 Thanks for the help!

 It took me a while to find enough information on the relatively-new Android port of Emacs, so I'd thought I'd gather everything I found together here to help others out.
 First of all, the version of Emacs available on f-droid is out of date. Uninstall it. Also, and this may be inconvenient for lots of people, if you have and are using Termux, you should uninstall that too. That's because the optimal way to use the GUI-based, Android-native version of Emacs is in tandem with a custom fork of Termux which shares a developer ID with Emacs so that they can cooperate. If you don't know, Termux is a command-line GNU/Linux shell and environment for Android with a package manager. With the custom version, you can use the Termux package manager to install GNU/Linux app…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have been one of the people who have never gotten used to the terminal inside emacs. I think the main reason is how the history works. 
 Is there a way to make the history work like a regular terminal, rather than jumping back in the buffer to its position?
 I wrote a three part method to switch, using bash in a terminal (it should be OS agnostic), to the directory of the active window:
 First, emacs:
  #+begin_src emacs-lisp (defun dmg-current-dir () (if buffer-file-name (file-name-directory buffer-file-name) (expand-file-name default-directory))) #+end_src 
 then create a script, I call it edir , put it in your path
  #!/bin/bash emacsclient -e "(progn (set-buffer (window-buffer (selected-window))) (dmg-current-dir))" | perl -pe 's/^"(.+)"/$1/' 
 Finally create a function in your .bashrc
  function cde { A=`edir` cd "$A" } 
 Source your .bashrc. now you can simply run cde to change to the current directory (and use edir for other commands)
 I am sure it can be done in two steps (emacs + function) but my bash skills are limited.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I see big projects like yasnippets deprecating (Clojure term) namespacing/(emacs term) prefixing with a slash for namespacing with a dash. For example, yas-recompile-all is now replacing yas/recompile-all. I see such conventions followed for other libraries, too. Personally, no doubt because I'm a Clojure programmer, I like the slash over the dash. It is more distinctive, knowing "this isn't just a core function with that name, but an actual NS (ish)." I guess it might be more honest to elisp not to indicate there is a true namespace and it's all just a naming convention, but is this really the reason? Or is it something about compatibility (maybe with terminal users? Do terminals dislike the /?), or about interop (maybe libraries like yasnippet are also being ported to other things, like VIM or VSCode, that might have an opinion?) Does anyone know why dashes are preferred to slashes?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, this is my first post here. I've been learning Haskell on-and-off for about a year now. I've completed two or three beginner-level books, but I still find it challenging to write full-fledged Haskell apps. Simultaneously, I've been dabbling a bit with Rust.
 My dilemma is that I lack sufficient experience and a deep understanding of the philosophies of these two languages to make an informed choice on where to invest my time. I've tried both, but I feel that I won't be able to make an effective comparison without creating a larger project in each (for which currently I have no time unfortunately).
 I'm love Haskell's purity, abstractions, and expressiveness and at the same time I find memory management in Rust to be a bit of a pain. However I've noticed many people transitioning from Haskell to Rust, and that Rust ecosystem is much more lively and it's causing me to wonder if Haskell is slowly falling out of favor.
 The response I've seen several times is that Haskell is worth it for it's educational aspect, but I'm interested in more practical side of things. Is there anybody who thinks that Haskell is better then Rust for real world applications?
 From my current perspective, Rust doesn't seem like a direct replacement for Haskell. I'm not sure how to incorporate the functional style I love into Rust. Could this just be a lack of expertise on my part? Would I eventually be able to write Rust in a way that captures what I like about Haskell?
 I'm aware this topic has been discussed many times in various forums, but I still can't shake the feeling that focusing on Haskell might not be a worthwhile investment. Would it be more reasonable to spend time gaining a deeper understanding of Rust?
 Any insights from those with broader experience in both languages would be greatly appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi. I'm wondering if there's a package that lets you send marked text to your kindle email address? I tried to copy/paste some text from a buffer into mu4e and send it to my kindle email address and forgot that it has to be in attachment form. So I'm just thinking if there's a way to do export it automatically as an attachment somehow and attach it to an mu4e compose buffer automatically with your kindle address.
 That could be really nice to read very long screens of text.
 I couldn't find one with a search but maybe it still exists?
 EDIT: After talking to some people in #systemcrafters and the like, here's the ideal:
 1) Mark text in a buffer
 2) Hit M-x <command>
 3) It exports text to like /tmp/ as a .pdf or .epub or something
 4) then it opens mu4e and attaches as an attachment
 5) it fills out the email for [name@kindle.com](mailto:name@kindle.com)
 And then all you have to do is hit C-c C-c to send.
 I see this as really useful for reading very long text buffers in a more convenient way than on a laptop or monitor screen for a long time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have basically two questions:
  
What other software uses a similar kind of architecture to Emacs? A small core with an interpreter and everything else being (openly) built around that? Are there projects based on this idea that you know of that never came to fruition? 
 
How would one go about implementing a similar kind of application?
 
 And just in advance, I already know about Lisp machines and how they relate to Emacs.

I have two panes in the emacs screen, one with the notes I'm taking and the other one with the pdf (in docview) that I am reading and taking notes from. I know that I could swicht buffers within one of the panes with C x right/left, but I don't want that. I want to switch the cursor, if that makes sense. A shortcut to switch from one pane to the other, not buffers. Is that possible?

 I'm almost completely happy with my new config. I have only one thing I need to address:
 When I add a new package (via use-package, generally) to the config, it almost always fails to download the next time I restart emacs. This is because of the package contents data being stale. I was manually running (package-refresh-contents) and restarting a subsequent time, but that was getting old. Especially given that I was experimenting with a variety of different packages.
 So I added that command to the start of my init.el, right after (package-initialize). And that added several seconds to my start-up.
 What do the rest of you do, to address this? Just accept that adding a new package means you have to refresh contents before restarting? Or is there some way to run this asynchronously?

 But I'm looking at the scala API and it looks like the map function for List does guarantee that it returns a List? https://www.scala-lang.org/api/2.13.3/scala/collection/immutable/List.html#mapB:List[B]

 https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/16gzmmi/orgwindowhabit_an_alternative_habit_system_based/?sort=new
 I've always found that the built in habit tracking provided by org-mode that is based on repeaters is less than ideal for capturing anything other than the notion of repeating something at some fixed interval (typically daily).
 The way that I think most people think about non-daily habits is that they ought to be completed some number of times within a certain window. For example, you might set the goal of doing some form of cardiovascular exercise at least 4 times a week.
 org-window-habit Allows you to do exactly this. Instead of relying on org repeaters (or even the habit flavored org repeaters), it uses properties from the org drawer to understand the constraints the user would like to have around their habit. To explain how this is useful, I'll return to the 4 days a week example from above. If you wanted to give yourself some leeway within an individual week (life happens), but still wanted to ensure that in the long term you are conforming to your goal of 4 repetitions a week, you might do something like specify a short term window where 3 repetitions are required in a single week, but 16 repetitions are required within any 4 week period. This would allow you to require that you're never completely falling off the wagon with your habit, but also that you can do a bit of makeup/slowdown, as long as you are roughly hitting your goal when you zoom out enough.
 For more details, take a look at the README, but also be aware that even more customization is available (take a look at the source code if you are so inclined). If it seems that people in the community are interested in this sort of habit tracking I'm happy to document even more details about how this package works, but at this point, I want to evaluate whether or not people are interested in using it before I put more work into it.

If you wanted to give yourself some leeway within an individual week (life happens), but still wanted to ensure that in the long term you are conforming to your goal of 4 repetitions a week, you might do something like specify a short term window where 3 repetitions are required in a single week, but 16 repetitions are required within any 4 week period. This would allow you to require that you're never completely falling off the wagon with your habit, but also that you can do a bit of makeup/slowdown, as long as you are roughly hitting your goal when you zoom out enough.
 For more details, take a look at the README, but also be aware that even more customization is available (take a look at the source code if you are so inclined). If it seems that people in the community are interested in this sort of habit tracking I'm happy to document even more details about how this package works, but at this point, I want to evaluate whether or not people are interested in using it before I put more work into it.

 I really have no idea how to use propertize, or what delight wants from me. I mostly just want the ability to make that particular icon larger on the mode-line. Can anyone help? Give me a fish by showing me what's wrong with my syntax. Teach me to fish by explaining how I can find valid args with propertize. I've looked online, in examples, and in the emacs info and though they point me to good information, nothing actually helps me know how to up the size of a particular item in the modeline.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The topic of auto suggesting packages for installation when a user ends up in a fundamental mode buffer recently came up on the emacs-devel mailing list.
 I'm not sure if/how the feature will work in package.el, but I've implemented an extension for Elpaca.
 The basic idea is that the package maintains a "database" of entries that would be added to auto-mode-alist, interpreter-mode-alist, and magic-mode-alist. When elpaca-suggest mode is enabled and a fundamental mode buffer is visited, the database is checked to see if an appropriate mode can be installed. When the user installs one of the suggested modes, it is enabled in the fundamental-mode buffers it applies to.
 If any Elpaca users are interested, testing and feedback are appreciated. No need to alter your config. Running the following test will allow you to experiment in a test environment.
 (elpaca-test :interactive t :ref "feature/suggest" :init (elpaca elpaca-suggest (elpaca-suggest-mode))) 
 For example, creating a file named "test.d" should suggest d-mode for installation.

 I just hacked this last night, and I'm sharing because I think this is very cool hahaha. The flake will tangle the org file into an elisp file, and use that as the config for the emacs, managing all the installations and building entirely from nix package manager (no unnecessary rebuilds!).
 There are some small issues with association lists (that I will eventually change) but besides that it should work for any org file.
 I also for the life of me can't figure out how to make emacs use the fonts in the flake without resourcing to globally installing it (I wanted to make it a standalone package) and would love to get some help.

 I'm currently a masters student in clinical counseling intending to go into private practice. This means I'll need a notes app that is HIPAA compliant, yet the state of feature rich note taking in out-of-the-box electronic health records software is abysmal. I've narrowed down the list of non-commercial, open source notes apps to neovim, qownnotes, zim, and emacs. 
 Of those, Emacs seems by far the most feature rich. I'm coming from Obsidian. I don't mind a steep learning curve, I just want something I can stick with for the long haul.
 Does anyone know if emacs can be configured for HIPAA compliance, or know of any resources that could help me confirm or deny this? Thank you in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This post is not meant to cause flame or anything. I’m sincerely asking this to understand relationships between various concepts. Asking on this sub because it has lots of people who probably know a lot about type theory.
 It seems to me that in Smalltalk, Common Lisp, and other languages that treats classes as objects at runtime, we basically get all three things one can get in lambda cube. A message to create a subclass is a type dependent on type; all generic functions/messages are terms dependent on type; to achieve type dependent on term we basically just write a method that calls type constructors based on input term. Essentially, by treating types (classes) as runtime values (objects), we basically make them first class and get everything from reflection. If one doesn't like nominal subtyping, we can also achieve similar expressive power by supporting "algebraic classes" at runtime.
 Given that there are so many research into making more expressive type systems, I suppose that there’s probably a lot of other things that I haven’t thought about. Other than guaranteeing termination or improving performance of programs, what are some benefits of a powerful static type system over the runtime first class type approach I mentioned above?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been using 29.1 for a few weeks now, having built it myself from source (installed to /usr/local). At the same time, I found the Homebrew build of this version for MacOS to be much easier to install and manage than trying to build it. So I tried the Homebrew installation for Linux earlier today, and... it was weird.
 It will not open a GUI instance, plain and simple. Trying to launch it from my dock failed to materialize a window. So I popped into a terminal window and ran it manually. It opened up as a text (non-X) application, but it ran code that is gated on a test of window-system:
 (use-package display-line-numbers ;; Number ALL the lines :if window-system :config (global-display-line-numbers-mode t) (setq display-line-numbers-grow-only t)) 
 When this (terminal-bound) emacs started up, it was showing line numbers. When I run the self-built copy (with -nw) it doesn't set the global-display-line-numbers-mode mode.
 As a test, I even ran the Homebrew version with an explicit --display argument, but still text-only (with line numbers).
 Anyone seen something similar? I'd like to have this be managed by Homebrew, so that I can get updates without manually rebuilding.

 I am not sure if it's because I am using openSUSE SLES 12 SP5, which is terribly old (thanks work...), but I have found this to be so incredibly frustrating and I can't find anything online to help me figure this out.I installed emacs from source with these commands:sudo ./configure --without-compress-install --with-json --with-xpm=ifavailable --with-jpeg=ifavailable --with-gif=ifavailable --with-gnutls=ifavailable --with-tree-sitter --with-x --with-x-toolkit=gtk3

 I want to know... Where does emacs look for fonts? Because that has been basically impossible to figure out. When I run M-x describe-font it lists a ton of fonts that simply do not exist in fc-list. But I …]]></summary>

 If you're using ZIO, you might enjoy this little compiler plugin I made, that makes the infamous ZIO type mismatch errors more human-readable.
 Due to a small change in Scala 2.13.12 I needed to create a new release, so if you're using ZIO Clippy and upgrading to Scala 2.13.12, you'll have to update the plugin.
 The easiest is cloning the repository and running sbt +install. See the README for more information!

 Enjoy!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've seen a lot of people talking about Emacs 29 and it's new set of features like tree-sitter and LSP support through Eglot. However, no one seems to ask how to get a version of Emacs built with these features enabled.
 Right now I'm running Fedora Workstation 38, and I've searched Copr for Emacs 29 builds as it is yet to be released in the main repos, but I found nothing.
 I then tried to build it from source, downloading the latest tag's tarball from the Savannah repo. I looked at the options offered by the configure script, and enabled the tree-sitter option, as well as the json built-in support and the mailutils option. However, I was still missing a dependency : json. And nowhere to be found on Fedora's repos (I tried every version of json-c but none of them seem to do the trick). And when I finally gave up and the script was finishing its job, tree sitter, image support, and all the good stuff was disabled, and I have no idea how to enable it back.
 So, my question is : how can I get a copy of Emacs with all the fancy stuff enabled on Fedora ? Building from source is not a problem, but the instructions provided by GNU are lacking clarity for me.
 Some help would really be appreciated, and sorry if I sound like a total noob but I kinda am 😅

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I just started learning Haskell. I have experience in Python, JavaScript and TypeScript.
 data BinTree a = Leaf | Node a (BinTree a) (BinTree a) deriving (Show) depth :: BinTree a -> Int depth Leaf = 0 depth (Node _ left right) = max (depth left) (depth right) 
 So basically the above is my approach to finding the depth of a Binary Tree. It is performing (implicit?) recursion on the left and right nodes and getting the max depth. I have come to realize that in python or other languages, depth Leaf = 0 would basically just be an if-statement which is a base case.
 But in Haskell, in this context, it is referred to as pattern matching as far as I'm concerned. So what is pattern matching really? And how does this code differ from me writing a simple if-statement?
 In Haskell does "=" have more meaning than just defining a value? Does it represent anything else?
 My interpretation of the code above is.
 // takes in a BinTree object depth :: BinTree a -> Int // If the BinTree so happens to be a leaf, return 0 depth Leaf = 0 // Else perform recursion on left and right depth (Node _ left right) = max (depth left) (depth right) 
 So what really is Pattern Matching doing here?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have the following Cache implementation:
 trait Cache[F[_], K, V] {
 def get(key: K): F[Option[V]]
 def put(key: K, value: V): F[Cache[F, K, V]]
 }
 An implementation of that trait like this:
 import cats.effect.kernel.Async 
 case class ImmutableMapCache[F[_]: Async, K, V](map: Map[K, V]) extends Cache[F, K, V] {
 override def get(key: K): F[Option[V]] =
 Async[F].blocking(map.get(key)) 
 override def put(key: K, value: V): F[Cache[F, K, V]] =
 Async[F].blocking(ImmutableMapCache(map.updated(key, value)))
 } 
 object ImmutableMapCache {
 def empty[F[_]: Async, K, V]: F[Cache[F, K, V]] =
 Async[F].pure(ImmutableMapCache(Map.empty))
 }
 I then have my application code, creating an instance of this case class and then use the pur, get operation to work with the Cache. But my application uses a different effect type and I would like to pass on that effect type to the ImmutableMapCache. But here I'm restricting my ImmutableMapCache to an Async effect type. So the question is, can I make my ImmutableCacheMap even more generic so that I can pass the effect type from outside?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I use subdirectories in my org-directory that also serves as org-roam-directory. This means that to place a new file in the proper subdirectory, I either need to update/expand my capture templates each time when I add a subdirectory or that I need to refile or manually move the file after creating it.
 This is not a completely unsolved problem, fortunately, but most solutions are more complex than mine and require significant tailoring to one's own setup. So I set out to write something simpler using the ${foo} construct from Org-roam's template expansion.
 Quite happy with the solution that is also the first bit of elisp that I fully wrote myself (while of course being inspired by the examples on the web). I first set up a function to (recursively) collect all subdirectories below the org-directory. The resulting list is then used in a completing-read. Because ${foo} gets the file argument passed by Org-roam's capture system, the pl/ask-para-location needs to get accept this input although it doesn't actually use it.
 Together this enables interactively drilling down a directory structure or (even) to create a new (sub) directory by entering a new string instead of selecting a directory from the list provided by/to completing-read.
  (defun pl/org-roam-directories () (let ((files (mapcar (lambda (f) (file-relative-name f org-roam-directory)) (directory-files-recursively org-roam-directory "\\.org$")))) (mapcar (lambda (f) (file-name-directory f)) files))) (defun pl/ask-para-location (ARG) (completing-read "Choose org file :target : " (pl/org-roam-directories))) (setq org-roam-capture-templates (quote ( ("d" "Default" plain "%?" :target (file+head "${pl/ask-para-location}/${slug}.org" "#+title: ${title}\n") :unnarrowed t )))) 
 Proud of this little snippet!
 (edit: small font locking improvements)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A discussion question.
 I was porting a script I wrote to Scala Native when I started encountering missing APIs in Scala such as Scala's version of java.time. Even once I found a 3rd party library it wasn't 1-to-1 compatible tojava.time (for example had a different set of ZoneIds). It took some digging and trial and error (and testing stuff in run-time because these were Java dependencies).
 This experience got me thinking what else is in common use that should become part of the Scala API to be JVM agnostic? There's a sentiment lately that Scala shouldn't rely strictly on the JVM (can be seen here and there in the comments, JdG wrote about it) so perhaps making a standard for common APIs would help porters target only Scala and not create Java shims to the entire Java API.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am using the stack consult/vertico/orderless. When I want to search a directory often the order is not sorted properly. Suppose that I have the directory Music in my home directory. If I use consult-find and search for the pattern "Music" I get other entries first, while the closest pattern is burried somewhere in the middle.
 ~/bla/bla/bla/Music ~/aaa/bbb/bb/Music ~/ccc/ddd/eee/Music ... ~/Music 
 If I specify a pattern, how do I get the closest match as the first line? I would expect to have this instead:
 ~/Music ~/bla/bla/bla/Music ~/aaa/bbb/bb/Music ~/ccc/ddd/eee/Music ... 
 Note that here the closest pattern is in the first place. That would be my goal. First the closest matches, then the rest.
 Thank you for sharing with me your wisdom.

This is the question: can someone just confirm or explain what The Archive does when you click on a link such as [[202309091054]]?
What I think I have read elsewhere in the forum is that The Archive takes the information inside the set of double brackets and searches both the names and the content of all files in your Zettelkasten directory, and returns the name of any file where a match is found.  Is that correct?  If not, please enlighten me 
Also, is the information within that set of double brackets limited to 12 characters or can it be any length of characters?
I'm just trying to understand how the linking functions.]]></summary>

 I was wondering if Haskell has a place where the best libraries for common tasks, together with their strengths and weaknesses, are listed like Rust has in blessed.rs. This would be really useful because just from hackage, its hard to determine which packages have the most features and best support and docs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've found a ton of posts/questions/answers about Haskell binary size in general (tl;dr: they're big 'cause static linking!), but I recently got curious about the drastic differences in size across platforms.
 I've built a couple of little tools which I've released for Linux, Mac, and Windows. I recently pushed out a new version of one and was startled to see the difference in binary size, despite building them all exactly the same way:
  
Linux: 23.8 MB
 Mac: 9 MB
 Windows: 37.8 MB
  
Crazy! Can anyone help me understand what's going on here? I assume they're all statically linked.
 Oh, and to be clear: this isn't a problem for me. I don't really care about binary size in this case. I'm just very curious!
 By the way, this is the tool. And here's its package.yaml, if that matters. (FWIW, I've built all three binaries the same way, with a simple stack build, using GHC 9.2.8.)
 Anyway, thanks for any info!

 That said -- It's hard for me to believe standard emacs text editing facilities are more efficient than modal editing (for someone that really groks modal editing). I'm curious if there are any vim veterans that believe otherwise, and if so, what specifically makes you think that. 
 I understand efficiently modifying text is just one part of a productive workflow and emacs has many other advantages, but I'm talking text editing here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was getting super excited about beOrg plus workingcopy on my iPhone. Got everything "working" and then started a simple test.
 Test 1: I went into a large personal.org file and changed the status of something from NEXT to DONE. Hit the back arrow since I think it just saves. Go to workingcopy and it shows the file has changed, great. And then do a diff... and it's several hundred changes, all of which look identical in the diff. Maybe its a word wrap (can't tell on the phone), sometimes a space. Just a bunch of green and red highlighted sections of the same content. I didn't notice a pattern.
 Test 2: I just went into the same file in basic text mode and added "test save" text at the top. Do the diff in working copy and the entire file isn't mangled, it just show test save as new text. BUT there is also an added block at the bottom of the file #+BEGIN_SRC scheme / blank line / #+END_SRC. How totally random?!?! (I've never made a scheme block in my life)
 ​
 So, is beOrg just doa or what am I doing wrong? It didn't parse the SEQ_TODO block at the top of my file so I added my states in the settings, but other than that it's entirely vanilla setup. I'm so bummed I had finally got this all up and working and it just seems non-functional. I'm hoping someone can point me in the right direction and I'm doing something stupid. Maybe there is a setting to not add a bunch of invis ctrl characters somewhere?
 Thanks again for any and all help.

 or should i give vanilla emacs a try
 I have not heard much about vanilla emacs keybindings than i have heard of vim, is vanilla emacs keybindings worth giving a shot?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been using org-mode long enough that I'm coming up with all these weird bespoke things that I want to do with it, such as create types. For instance, when I'm reading a book, and creating notes about the book, I have some mashup of the book's title and author as a headline; and notes are in sub-headings underneath that. I just informally made this up as the need arose for various kinds of thing.
 It would be nice to regularize this, so that I could later write code that has a sense of what a "book" is, and its fields (author, publication date, ...) and to check for the inclusion of those fields, or integrity check them, or whatever. I'm only just beginning to think about this because I have only recently come to want it based on the way I've been using org-mode, but I'm sure this has been discussed many times, and maybe there's even a package or a method that's well-understood. Some of the new-fangled PKM tools have versions of this (e.g., Logseq, Tana) but they're undesirable for other ways (mainly, in my case, their editors suck so hard).
 Could anyone suggest existing thinking on this topic, or proposed packages, or reasons why it's a terrible idea?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I wrote the following piece of code to derive a headline from property values. Ideally, I would just replace the text of the title, and leave the other properties (todo, priority, tags) in place. 
 The code below instead rebuilds the whole headline by first gathering the properties, building a new title string, and then re-inserting it in the buffer.
 I am wondering if there is a simpler/smarter way
  (save-excursion (org-back-to-heading t) (let* ((point (point)) (todo (org-entry-get point "TODO")) (priority (org-entry-get point "PRIORITY")) (tags (org-entry-get point "TAGS")) (title (concat (make-string (org-outline-level) ?*) " " (cl-destructuring-bind (title-comps title-format) (mv/org-get-title-info) (mv/format-section-title title-format (mv/org-collect-section-properties% title-comps point)))))) (delete-region (point) (line-end-position)) (insert title) (when tags (org-set-tags tags)) (when todo (let ((current-prefix-arg 0)) (org-todo todo))) (unless (char-equal (aref priority 0) org-default-priority) (org-priority priority)))) 
 What the code is doing, is as follows
  
Extract todo, priority, tag info
 Build the new title along with leading `*` 
 Delete the title line, and insert the new one
 Re-assign todo, priority and tags.
  
It is working so-so. Still has rough edges.
 My question is: Does org.el have code that will allow me to replace the title in place? I could define my own regexp to do it. But maybe there is existing plumbing already in place.
 Thanks,

I am currently using vertico, but I am willing to switch to something else, provided that it allows to filter the dot files. Ideally, I would like the files and directories starting with dot to be suggested only when I insert the initial dot as a part of the name. Otherwise, they should not be suggested.
 Can this be done?
 Also, when using pcomplete, is there any way to integrate fuzzy search in the completion? Right now the only thing I can do is use C-n and C-p or click on the entry in the window containing the suggested list of items.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Are there any tips for setting up Haskell in a way that allows for easy installs of modules?
 I want to preface that I love Haskell. It is my favorite language by far, I love the syntax and I want to use it as much as I can because it's a blast to code in.
 But I can't get cant get anything working! I've tried multiple GUI packages, multiple plotting packages, quipper (quantum computing), and the physics module. I have such a hard time just installing things that I'm starting to get turned off. Even java fx has been more pleasurable to work with. 
 I really love there language but my patience is running thin, does anyone have tips?
 I want to learn more but I need to be able to use packages. If you know a good way to install any GUI or plotting package please let me know. If you have also run into quipper issues too. I use WSL 2.0 on windows 10 (since I've had a lot of trouble running on native windows) and I install everything with ghcup.
 Greatly appreciate any and all advice.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Repro: Using emacs 28.1 with vertico, consult, consult-ls-git, and git-gutter. Open a remote file via tramp in a git repo. Run consult-ls-git. In the minibuffer, we should see: Tramp: Opening connection git-gutter for <user>@<host> using scp...done\]. Any action (like navigation) in the mini buffer results in Tramp refreshing this git-gutter connection all the time.
 Has anyone experienced this before and knows a workaround? I see that git-gutter is no longer actively maintained (https://github.com/emacsorphanage/git-gutter/issues/151). I'd like to switch over to Vertico + Consult, but I use this workflow often and hope it to get it working.

 Recently I released a new package providing fast, colorful and configurable indentation bars based on the :stipple face property. It received quite a bit of interest and feedback. 
 I'm pleased to announce version 0.2 of indent-bars, which now supports tab-based indent, works in terminal using character-based display, and can leverage tree-sitter for context-aware bar depth. You can also now start bars at column 0 or another offset.
 Lots of formatting options; here's a simple one that highlights the current depth (red) by increasing its contrast:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm working on a project with a large submodule. The files in the submodule are making it harder to find the files in my project. How do I stop projectile from listing these files?
 Walking through the projectile-find-file source, I got to projectile-dir-files-alien which returns the list of files that projectile-find-file suggests. It uses the following:
 (nconc (projectile-files-via-ext-command directory (projectile-get-ext-command vcs)) (projectile-get-sub-projects-files directory vcs)) 
 For the case of git. So it initially seems it's hardcoded into projectile that it finds "sub-projects" (which based on projectile-get-all-sub-projects seems to be used synonymous to submodule).
 Going a little further I get to:
 (defcustom projectile-git-submodule-command "git submodule --quiet foreach 'echo $displaypath' | tr '\\n' '\\0'" "Command used by projectile to list submodules of a given git repository. Set to nil to disable listing submodules contents." :group 'projectile :type 'string) 
 Which is used by `projectile-get-immediate-sub-proejcts` to name the project's submodules. But I'm still getting the submodule's files after setting that to null (even after restarting emacs and running projectile-invalidate-cache). I also tried running the projectile-git-command directly in a terminal to confirm that that command was not listing submodule files.
 Any ideas what I'm doing wrong?

 Most days it is useful as my notes from the previous day are automatically brought to the present, however occasionally an entire page's worth of notes is just dropped! This has happened 3 or 4 times in the past month and it is driving me insane
 Today I went to add to my org journal and all the TODOs from the previous day were gone. Moreover, the previous day's journal file was automatically deleted. Luckily I was able to open up a buffer with the same file name and spam undo, and my research journal luckily was cached and restored.
 I am hoping you all can help me with the following issues:
  
How do I avoid the auto-deletion of old content when rolling tasks forward? I'm okay with some redundancy/bloat in my filesystem if it ensures that I don't lose day's worth of work/my healthy todo list
 
Is this just user error? Should I not be carrying TODOs over multiple days. I'm not really sure if what is happening is desired behavior of org journal or a strange occurrence
 
 Thanks in advance

 One thing I just can't seem to understand is how can I perform a tab. Googling shows me ctr+v but this does not do anything. I just want to be able to add a tab e.g in a if block.. also it would be great to auto indent when I e.g create an if block in any language. What is the prober way to do this and to ensure tab is working?

 I've been using org-mode for over a decade, and it's the best solution I've ever used. However, I struggled with the lack of mobile apps that fully supported org-mode a few years ago. So, several years ago, I decided to develop an android app that would allow users to use org-mode on mobile devices just like in Emacs. At that time, Notion didn't have the influence it does now, and Obsidian and Logseq hadn't been released yet. Later on, Notion became valued at billions, and Obsidian and Logseq secured investments. However, I found that they all had various limitations and couldn't provide the complete org-mode experience. This strengthened my determination to bring…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I would like to set the keybindings for minor modes in their respective keymaps using the minor-mode hook. Using local-set-key, the same operation for MAJOR modes is easy. However, it appears that I must name the minor-mode keymap in every define-key expression, e.g.:
 (defun my/add-tab-bar-history-keys () 
 "Specify more convenient keybindings for the functions that traverse the history of the tab-bar window configurations. This function is added to the mode hook for tab-bar-history-mode." 
 (define-key tab-bar-history-mode-map (kbd "C-q b") 'tab-bar-history-back)
 (define-key tab-bar-history-mode-map (kbd "C-q f") 'tab-bar-history-forward))
 I could use map() to eliminate the redundancy, I guess, but something like local-set-key() would be more convenient and robust. 
 After scouring the Web, I found this StackOverflow question from 10 years ago, viewed 1k times, "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19308390/how-to-define-keymap-for-minor-mode-correctly, but it doesn't deal with this aspect of minor-mode keymaps. 
 Perhaps a more recent technique has emerged? Thanks for any thoughts!

 Digging a little deeper, I think the performance was because I did not have nerd-icons and its fonts installed. I was using all-the-icons.
 I installed nerd-icons, then M-x nerd-icons-install-fonts. Reactivating doom-modeline and there is no performance issue. Downright snappy.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm getting a weird shifting of the line numbers when using (setq-default display-line-numbers 'visual).
 When moving through rows of text, the whole buffer will shift to the right by (what looks like) 1 column. The row that this happens on isn't consistent either. Moving back up the lines of text will shift it back to the left.
 In org-roam it's usually between lines 6 and 7 that I get the shift. With emacs -q it happens between lines 1 and 2. With emacs -Q it happens between lines 9 and 10. I've seen it happen for lines above 40 even.
 I can stop it from happening by disabling the absolute numbering with (setq display-line-numbers-current-absolute nil), but then I loose absolute numbering; and that's not a solution.
 This doesn't happen when using relative numbering; only with visual.
 I've tried using both (setq display-line-numbers-width-start t) and (setq display-line-numbers-grow-only t) but neither appear to change anything. (As suggested in this post)
 I'm using emacs version 28.1. I'm fairly new to emacs too.
 Steps to reproduce:
  
Start emacs without config: emacs -Q
 Show line numbers: M-x display-line-numbers-mode RET
 Set visual line numbers: M-x set-variable RET display-line-numbers RET visual RET
 Press enter a few times until all text shifts right by 1 column. This happens between rows 9 and 10 for me.
  
Anyone have any suggestions on how to stop this from happening?
 Here is a gif showing what I'm seeing:
 text shifting when moving rows
 Update:
 It appears to be affected by the vertical size of the window. With 24 lines visible, the shifting gets pushed out to line 66/67. It is not affected by where in the window those lines are though.Fiddling with the window size, It looks like the shift position happens according to (# visible lines + cursor line # = 90).
 ie. 31 visible lines, shift between line 59/60.
 24 visible lines, shift between line 66/67.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 While trying to learn lenses, ReaderT Design Pattern and Continuation Passing Style, I came across the following when I'm unsure about a parameter:
 ​ haskell myLiftA2 :: (a -> b -> c) -> (Int -> IO a) -> (Int -> IO b) -> (Int -> IO c) myLiftA2 f enva envb int = f <$> enva int <*> envb int 
 [details="Summary"] I don't understand how the int parameter can exist on the left-side [/details]
 SOLVED: The type signature is the same as: haskell myLiftA2 :: (a -> b -> c) -> (Int -> IO a) -> (Int -> IO b) -> Int -> IO c  so the Int was there the whole time: Without the int, we return a function that takes an int and returns an IO c -> with it applied, we return an IO c :)
 I also notice this in the definition for a function to create a lens: EDIT: expanded type of Lens haskell lens :: forall f. Functor f => (s -> a) -> (s -> a -> s) -> (a -> f a) -> s -> f s lens getterFunc setterFunc sa s = setterFunc s <$> sa (getterFunc s) 
 where sa :: (a -> f a) and s :: s seem to appear out of nowhere on the left hand side.
 EDIT2: Now given the expanded type signature this is more apparent and this one is also now solved for me!
  
I now have a new issue:
 The type of most lens functions (getter, setter, traversal) tends to look like
 haskell type Getter/Setter s a = Functor/Applicative f => (a -> f a) -> (s -> f s)  which, in the case of getters apparently is equivalent to s -> a but not in the case of setters.
 In this case a getter can be a function that has a function of (a -> f a) and a parameter s and this should return an f s so I'm not sure how we get s -> a here.
 Can anyone help explain this to me?
 EDITS: Sorry for the edits, posted on reddit too and slowly working things out at the same time.

 sql"""select * from charging_location where location_id = $id""" 
 That sql selects based on a field and I will have hundreds of such CRUD operations and it makes it complicated to remember all the column names of the tables in my database. I would rather prefer to leave it to a mapper (like in Slick) and just use my case class fields for formulating a query. How do you guys out there using doobie think about it? I do not see any value in doing it like this!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[TL;DR: I have a wc-mode/ dir under my .emacs.d, and I just want to add it to my .emacs.d repo. I staged it and committed but that didn't work. Pressing return on the dir in untracked files doesn't go into it (i thought maybe I could just add the files, but no joy). What gives?
 When I committed/pushed the wc-mode/ I staged I expected it to just add the subdir, but instead it went into creating a submodule (no experience with that term as far as VC goes) and added to the history that I merged a pull request from the git repo the dir originally came from (don't know where it grabed that info from). It was all very new, and pulling from my other machine just got me an empty dir. So I backed it all out manually by killing my .gitmodules file (newly created i think) and my .emacs.d/.git/modules/wc-mode (also newly created). Checked in the .gitmodules removal, but now looking for the way to just add a dir to my repo.
 I found a .git dir under wc-mode/ (don't think it was there before) and mv'd it to a bak. Now pressing return on wc-mode brings me up to .emacs.d in dired mode. Sooo confused now.
 (While I am curious about what how submodules work, and how it knew about the original github... I'd also really like to know just how to add a directory of files, since that seems very common.)
 ​
 Thanks for any and all help. I know this is a bit of a shit post from a debug perspective, but if you could point me toward the right info/book/etc that would be great. The magit info seems a bit obtuse at times, it's great for explaining low-level functions but not so much at explaining the designed workflow for things like this.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I would like to collect opinions from fellow Scala users.
 Given my experience in Scala it would be unfair not to provide my point of view so here it is:
 ​
 killer features:
 - domain modelling and processing: sealed hierarchies, type aliases, opaque types, pattern matching (Kotlin and especially Java falls behind)
 - contextual abstractions (unrivaled however there is little public knowledge on how to cook them properly)
 - DSLs (custom operators and occasional macro only, smart interpolation is landing in Java while Kotlin has functions with receiver type)
 - Innovations and other unique features (cool but hard to sell for commercial development)
 ​
 no-longer-killer features:
 - collections: Kotlin does it well, maybe even better (simpler hierarchy, faster, more helper methods on collections)
 - asynchronous/scalable code: project Loom does it better (however there are no established practices/usage patterns/libraries yet)
 - functional programming: practical parts have been absorbed by other languages, impractical are still plaguing Scala codebases.
 ​
 other stuff:
 - cats/ZIO/TF: imo requires too much effort with little gain unless writing complicated fiber interactions.
 - typeclasses: good for adapt-for-everything libraries, rarely seen in production code where abstracting over single specific type usually adds more complexity instead of reducing it.
 - HKT: GADTs? Never seen them in production code.
 - compile-time code generation: controversial. Can be enabler for unique code features (e.g. logging without org.slf4j.Logger instances or smart asserts) but is nightmare to develop, test and support. I'm quite sure everyone having macro-based RPC library silently wishes to rewrite it to plain old code generation.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I learned about Scala around 2 years ago and started actively learning it 1 year ago. Reading books, watching talks from Daniel Spiewak, John De Goes, and Rock the JVM.
 In my current job, I write Golang and Typescript, both on a massive microservices architecture that serves 7-digit devices, and have around 2 years of experience. I know the typelevel stack and can write/read Scala without a problem. Played around with Spark, Actors, and Akka HTTP too, so I guess I can orient myself in the ecosystem on what does what. I also have a bachelor's degree in tech/design.
 I read here that you shouldn't learn Scala because finding a job is very unlikely in some countries. So I knew beforehand, anyways I started my job hunt in Belgium. It has to be a permanent job and not too far away (1 hour 20min drive will do) or fully remote.
 So far I have found 3 companies: one paused the hiring, the other one only had one backend developer with 2 years of experience, and the last one I received no email, but they did view my LinkedIn.
 Either I become a data engineer and maybe I'll have another 5 companies I can apply to and will probably get no answer since I don't have a relevant master's degree or relevant experience. Or I start doing something else.
 Scala made me a better developer and taught me a lot so no regrets there. But what's the next best step forward? Should I get a job in Java (never written Java before) which will in the future improve my chances of landing a Scala position? Or should I hop on the Golang hype train? Of course, this greatly depends on the country. Here in my country, it is mainly .NET, Java, and Typescript. 
 There surely have been others of you that experienced this, What did you do?

 When lsp-java tries to start jdtls it gets so far, then I just get these messages repeated in the lsp-log and the server never actually starts.

 I've tried deleting workspace from the lsp-java folder but when I re-start and open a java source file it just goes back into this behaviour.
 Anyone seen this before or have any ideas how to fix?

I',m now moving away from Slick for one of my projects and using doobie and this hits me hard as the latest doobie version 1.0-RC4 depends on cats-effect 3 and Monix lacks support for it and I cannot proceed any further beyond compilation failure.
 The goal is for me to move away from Slick and use some other library. I considered doobie and it seems not a wise option as it causes compatibilities with Monix. Is there any other alternatives? I'm considering using quill. But it is unfortunate that there is no active development happening on Monix these days. It is such an awesome library.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While changing my package manager to straight.el, I'm trimming my configuration down a bit and switching to a more citar based citation/bibliography management setup, and away from org-ref -- which is a fine package but maybe a little bloated.
 There are still some tools I'd like to use from org-ref, especially the ability to refer to org-src blocks and to LaTeX equations/environments via ref:. This is the use-package declaration I had in mind:
 (use-package org-ref :straight t :after (org) :config (require 'org-ref) ) 
 I'm new to straight.el though, so I think this might result in more features being built via the default recipe than I need. Is there a more precise recipe that will e.g. build only org-ref-core.el that will do what I need?

 In the sway configuration I export the browser variable:
 export BROWSER=firefox 
 I am trying to open the links from an emacsclient, but this also happens with a regular emacs session. The only way I can make it work, once it stops working, is to restart emacs. After I do that the links start triggering the browser again and everything works as intended.
 Could you please help me to debug this issue? I don't know how to proceed in this case, but I have found out that browse-url seems to be the resposible one. If I position the cursor on the URL and do M-x browse-url it does not work. Of course, after the emacs restart it starts working again. So, I think that this is the function that is failing.
 SOLVED: It is possible to add a handler and set the default browser with the browse-url-text-browser variable and then set the browse-url-browser-function as browse-url-firefox. This block of code solves my issue:
 (setq browse-url-text-browser "firefox") (setq browse-url-browser-function 'browse-url-firefox browse-url-new-window-flag t browse-url-firefox-new-window-is-tab t)

 I recently began working on a major mode for Microsoft PowerShell, and after many late nights of perusing documentation, reading through source code of other packages, and debugging, it has been accepted into MELPA. This was a great learning experience and really gave me a brand new appreciation for the customizability of Emacs. 
 This package currently includes the following features:
  
Detailed syntax highlighting (variables, cmdlets, keywords, .NET types, strings, single- and multi-line comments, docstrings)
 Code indentation 
 Auto-complete for built-in and user-defined variables and cmdlets, built-in cmdlet parameters, and .NET types and members
 Spawning and sending code to an inferior shell process
 Support for PowerShell in Windows, *nix, and MacOS
  
I kind of hacked together the company backend, so it may not be as efficient as it could be. There may also be some bugs I missed (I haven’t figured out how to do company completion for multiple periods yet for the .NET types, for example), but I have been using it for writing PowerShell scripts at work and it’s been working well. 
 Feedback is always appreciated and pull requests are always welcome. I hope you guys enjoy the package!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've got a weird problem that I've been poking through the code and cannot find an option of how to set this. So recently (and probably foolishly) I did list-packages and let it update everything. Doing this kind of broke doom-modeline for me. I was getting weird ISO characters in the modeline, and with some research discovered that it had switched to nerd-icons at some point in the past. Previously it was working fine with all-the-icons. 
 Well I got nerd-icons installed and that fixed things up pretty much though the character is still quite small in comparison. However I discovered that the little icon doom-modeline uses for VHDL files is different from the one treemacs and all-the-icons uses for VHDL files. So this got me looking around for some definition of what file suffix gets associated with what icon.
 And that's where I got stuck. I can't find any option or list anywhere that sets that up. It's not that I need them to be the same (though I do prefer the one in all-the-icons) but now I'm just puzzled as to how this is assigned. Clearly it's got to be in the elisp somewhere, but... nothing so far.
 Does anyone know where it lists a character hex value and a file type list?

 Today I am happy to announce that the first draft of the Cryptography Community Project Proposal has been finished, and it explains in much greater detail what this effort is about.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Currently, I do the following but wondering if there is a more efficient workflow. I use the full command names below to be clear but have key bindings for these. 
  
Open dired in the directory where I keep projects I'm working on.
 M-x magit-clone, select the [u]rl option and paste the SSH URL from the project (github say) repository and agree to the suggested local repository location
 Press n to the question: Set `remote.pushDefault' to"origin"? (y or n)
 Press M (for Remote) in the magit-status buffer for the local repository
 Press a (to add) and enter "fork" for the remote name. So "origin" refers to the upstream remote. This automatically presents the remote url as: git@github.com:fork/<project-name>.git. I don't like this.
 I move to the word fork in this URL and change it to my github username and then hit enter.
 Press y to the question: Set `remote.pushDefault' to"fork"? (y or n). This way I pull in from the upstream origin remote and push to my fork remote.
 Press b c to create a new branch etc. and begin my work
 
 What would be a more efficient workflow than this that would also avoid the incorrect URL in step 5 above? Thanks for your time.

 Regarding Scala 3 support, all modules in Pekko Connectors barring 2 have Scala 3 support with the exceptions being Pekko Connectors Slick and Pekko Connectors MongoDB due to underling libraries missing Scala 3 support. Scala 3 support in Persistence JDBC is also missing for same reason.
 When Slick 3.5.0 will be released with Scala 3 artifacts then Scala 3 support will be added and there are ideas to use ReactiveMongo for Pekko Connectors MongoDB which is currently working on Scala 3 support.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone,
 I have a Haskell programming assignment due in a few days but I am stuck on the final component. The assignment is to render a variety of shapes through mouse and keyboard interaction in CodeWorld API. For example, one of the shapes is a "Line" which requires the user to draw a line in CodeWorld by "clicking" the screen to set the initial point and " releasing " the mouse to set the final point, and drawing a line between those 2 points.
 I have succeeded in rendering the shapes in CodeWorld, but the final element requires some more complex elements that I have no idea how to approach. The final functions require a user to press the arrow buttons on a keyboard to change the rotation and 'stretch' of a semiCircle and an ellipse. The rules are as following:

 For those that are unaware mermaid is an excellent way to programmatically define diagrams for technical writing. It is extremely org based workflow friendly.
 Mermaid is huge and not every part of the grammar is supported. See the README for more information about what is and isn't supported.

 However, I've been facing quite a challenge over the past year and a half (on and off), trying to download and integrate it into my DOOM Emacs configuration. Despite my persistent efforts, I haven't been able to get it up and running successfully.
 I also know that DOOM Emacs has its own flavor of Reveal.js integration, but it doesn't have what I want. 
 Can someone help me incorporate this in my config? I would greatly appreciate any guidance or assistance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When using the %\N escape code in a capture template, is it possible to modify the value prior to having it inserted into the capture buffer?
 My use case is the creation of a headline where I prompt once for a person's name, but then insert it twice: once into the main headline text, and once as a tag. Something like this:
 ("m" "meeting" entry (file+olp "~/org/logbook.org" "MEETINGS") "* MEETING with %^{Person?}\t:%\\1:meeting:\n%?" ) 
 And that's fine if I respond to the "Person?" prompt with just the person's first name. So responding "John" gives me something like this:
 * MEETING with John :John:meeting: 
 The problem is, the person's name is usually two space-separated words, and spaces aren't allowed in tags. So if I respond to the "Person?" prompt with "John Smith", I get something like this:
 * MEETING with John :John Smith:meeting: 
 with the tags being broken.
 At the moment I have a kludgy workaround where I simply prompt for the name a second time, and I respond to that with a tag-acceptable version. Something like:
 ("m" "meeting" entry (file+olp "~/org/logbook.org" "MEETINGS") "* MEETING with %^{Person?}\t:%^{PersonAsTag?}:meeting:\n%?" ) 
 So when prompted for "PersonAsTag?" I'll respond with "john_smith" (but "JohnSmith" would work just as well) to get:
 * MEETING with John Smith :john_smith:meeting: 
 But it is, as I say, kludgy. So, is there any way to munge what I get from %\1 prior to it being dropped in as a tag?

It's as if the :bind must be evaluated late to take effect. Am I doing something wrong here? The same works fine with treesitter Python mode.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In emacs, in the same buffer, I can input Chinese characters. The characters are displayed properly, but when I copy the same characters from MS Notepad and paste them to the same buffer, they are displayed as garbage. What could be the difference? And how to fix the problem?
 I believe that I'm using UTF-8 encoding in MS Notepad, and I'm trying to use UTF-8 encoding in the emacs buffer. (There are many UTF-8-* encodings, I tried many, none so far works.)
 It's even strange that the same content from the MS Notepad, if I save it to a file, then open by emacs, then the same content is displayed properly! It seems that the copy and paste might introduce some noise?
 EDIT: 
 My emacs/doom runs in WSL2 in Windows 11. This causes the problem. If I run emacs natively, copy from Notepad and paste to the natively running emacs, there is no problem.
 I even tried to 
  (set-next-selection-coding-system 'utf-16-le) (set-selection-coding-system 'utf-16-le) (set-clipboard-coding-system 'utf-16-le) 
 in emacs/WSL2, it still does not work.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's my yearly annual "Let's try Emacs and fail miserably and give up in 3 days" day! So I'm excited to announce that I once again have a newbie problem I can not solve!
 The problem is, as a pleb I want to use cua keybindings with ergoemacs. I know there is a built-in cua mode but I don't like it that much. So ergoemacs it is. I did install ergoemacs from the elpa package repository and tried to follow the directions they give but there are problems, the official site https://ergoemacs.github.io/ asks me to add:
 (package-initialize) (require 'ergoemacs-mode) 
 to my emacs init file. When I add those I get the error of:
 ⛔ Warning (initialization): An error occurred while loading ‘/home/user/.emacs’:
 Wrong number of arguments: (3 . 4), 2
 To ensure normal operation, you should investigate and remove the cause of the error in your initialization file. Start Emacs with the ‘--debug-init’ option to view a complete error backtrace.
 Then I realised the line: (custom-set-variables '(package-selected-packages '(org ergoemacs-mode)) already exists so I didn't had to do anything about it, but then It wanted me to add:
 (setq ergoemacs-theme nil) ;; Uses Standard Ergoemacs keyboard theme (setq ergoemacs-keyboard-layout "us") ;; Assumes QWERTY keyboard layout (ergoemacs-mode 1) 
 Which I don't know where to add or how to add them. Can someone tell me, this worked perfectly when I last tried emacs.
 Answers such as "why not give emacs keybinding a chance?" or "why not use evil mode?" are prohibited since they literally are the opposite thing I'm asking here.

 build-site.el
 Hello everyone, I am trying to use ox-publish to build a static blog and am seeking advise on my setup so far for my publishing script. The one on the left hand side is the one I will be using, the one on the right hand side was the one I used to test to make sure I had the syntax correct and everything working.
 So my question is about the directories, I have one project called pages and that's where everything for the website lives in directory format. Static is where my assets live like css style sheet and images. 
 0xblockz · main ⟩ tree
 .
 ├── assets
 │ ├── img
 │ │ ├── logo.png
 │ │ ├── mastodon.svg
 │ │ └── planetary_system_icon_125429.ico
 │ └── style.css
 ├── build-site.el
 ├── index.html
 ├── notes.org
 └── README.md
 ​
 this is the tree of the directory I am not a web developer so any advise would be greatly appreciated thanks

(cond ;; Centered justification (= beg (line-beginning-position)) (let* ((img (create-image image 'imagemagick t)) (width (car (image-size img))) (offset (floor (- (/ (window-text-width) 2) (/ width 2))))) (overlay-put (ov-at) 'before-string (make-string offset ? ))))) ;; advise the function to a (advice-add 'org--format-latex-make-overlay :after 'org-justify-fragment-overlay) 
 The blog post was from many years ago, and it seems that some of the functions here, such as org--format-latex-make-overlay don't even exist in org-mode anymore. I tried searching through the org-mode source code and could not find any function with a similar signature as that of org-justify-fragment-overlay. Does anyone know of any potential fixes for this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As an active Emacs user and package developer, I've been contemplating the structure of tabulated-list-mode in Emacs Lisp, particularly its use of vectors. While vectors are efficient for indexed access, they present challenges when dealing with complex data structures or transformations.
 Much of my work involves parsing data from JSON API responses, which naturally form alist, plist, or hash-table structures. In the current iteration of tabulated-list-mode, a two-stage process is necessary: first, normalization into vector format (I find it hard to imagine a structure where the entry format (ID [DESC1 ... DESCN]) could originate from), followed by rendering through tabulated-list-print. This process can introduce performance inefficiencies.
 In real-world scenarios where normalization to the tabulated-list's vector format is unavoidable, the efficiency advantage of vectors is somewhat negated, and can even result in an overall performance loss due to the extra conversion step.
 I'd propose using lists instead of vectors in tabulated-list-format and tabulated-list-entries. This change could potentially allow for greater flexibility and better alignment with common data inputs. However, I understand that historical decisions and compatibility concerns may limit the feasibility of such changes.
 In the interim, I suggest enabling tabulated-list-print to act as a transducer, reducing the need for multiple iteration passes. This could significantly streamline the rendering of non-vector-compatible data while preserving compatibility and performance.
 I've noted that some libraries also struggle with this issue, resorting to workarounds and hacks, as evidenced in the magit-repolist-columns documentation string.
 I welcome your thoughts, advice, and any potential solutions or alternatives. If there are potential pitfalls I've overlooked, I'm keen to learn about them too.

 I have a windows 10 pc and I want to install Haskell on it, I tried looking up the internet but it was too confusing. I know ghci is a Haskell interpreter (or interactive Haskell program), ghc is the compiler and I have no clue what cabal is
 I would really appreciate it if someone would familiarize me with all the vocab/tools and recommend me how to install Haskell.
 I'm a python programmer and I use conda a lot, I looked up and found ghc available as a package on coda. I would prefer if I could install ghci and Haskell's package manager (if there is one? idk) through condaas well.
 any other advice is also appreciated

 Does anyone know what might be causing this? They are both python files incase that helps. 
 Thanks :) 
 Here is my config (I've tried emacs with just this and it gives the same result). So i think it must either be a bug in git gutter or something odd with these files (line endings? im not really sure). If it would help to link the files somewhere I can try do that.
  (use-package git-gutter :ensure t :delight :hook ((prog-mode . git-gutter-mode) (org-mode . git-gutter-mode)) :config (setq git-gutter:update-interval 0.5)) 
 Edit: didn't solve this as such, but think somewhere i messed the file encodings up. decided to just copy the contents of the files into a new file and it fixed the issue. bit annoying but will do.

I don't want to change the splash screen, just the message. For reference, I'm using Emacs-mac-port where the splash screen automatically disappear after 0.5 seconds. By default, nano splash screen show the message "GNU / N A N O" in bold with the message "Emacs made simple" in grey right below, I want to change the "Emacs made simple" line to a random message from a list of messages. 
 After screwing around in Emacs for hours on end with ChatGPT and the Internet it has been pretty fruitless (because it kept hallucinating nonexistent functions). I have tried some stuff such as initial-buffer-choice (turned out it randomize my scratch buffer's name in the modeline). There's this but it's only for images.
 Edit: I even tried this:
 (let ((inhibit-message t)) (message "Welcome to GNU Emacs / N Λ N O edition") (message (format "Initialization time: %s" (emacs-init-time)))) (require 'nano-splash) (require 'nano-help) 
 I tried removing the 'nano-help part because I didn't need to know initialization time. I tried removing 'nano-splash part then put the snippet above before the install nano line. Nothing works. It even broke the nano theme.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am so shocked to find that author of "The Language Instrinct" take Emacs as his writing company.
 In chapter 7 of "talking head", Professor pinker introduced some AI chatting programming, he write it as:
 A version of the program was later sold as a computer game in Radio Shack stores, and another comes packaged with ~my word processing program, GNU Emacs~. (The documentation says, “If using Emacs becomes terribly frustrating and none of the techniques described above solve the problem, Emacs can still help you. Type ‘M-x doctor RET.' “) Here is a typical dialogue: User: I have been rather depressed lately. Computer: Are you depressed often? User: Yes, almost all the time. Computer: Why do you say yes almost all the time? User: Right now I feel like I could cry. Computer: Is it because right now you feel like you could cry that you came to me? 
 I read "The language Instinct" of Chinese translated version in 2016 before met Emacs 2 years later in 2018, so have no impression of Emacs in this great book.
 (P.S. "the language insticnt" was by the first time to be translated in Chinese and introducded to the masses in 2015 which is 21 years after Professor Pinker published it in 1994).
 I am very shocked, this book re-forged my mind afterwards. After its reading, I set off to throw away various tools of note-taking and mindmaps, then encountered Emacs 2 years later.

 After i started coding with lsp-mode (rust-analyzer as server) and company on, i realize that auto complete in company won't insert () for functions automatically.
 I know this may be a duplicated question but i still cannot find the solution.
  
And also how can i make YASnippet work with lsp-mode? Like showing both lsp and YASnippet completions in company menu.
 I tried copying Doom Emacs' hook but not working.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I implemented a constrained, discrete optimisation algorithm (in Haskell) that rebalances portfolios, and I'm writing tests for it. I'm particularly interested in integration tests, as it's harder to spot unintended interactions between the many functions that make up the algorithm than it is to spot bugs in a single function in isolation.
 I'm familiar with the QuickCheck paper, and I typically test functions by randomly generating test cases and, where possible, testing properties. The constraints that my rebalancer enforces define a set of properties that are easy to test, but they are not sufficient to guarantee optimality. It seems that the only general way to test for optimality would be to compare the output of my rebalancer to the output of an alternative rebalancer that tries to s…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a few different use cases for org mode that have a common feature: A template that is repeated in a file. For a fictional example:
 ``` * Beer Template - Country :: - Aroma :: - Taste :: 
  
Carlsburg
  
Country :: Denmark
 Aroma :: Citrus
 Taste :: Slightly bitter
 
 
Weihenstephan 
  
Country :: Germany
 Aroma :: Grains
 Taste :: Sweet wheat ```
 
  
I have tens of different files with these "templates". A common problem that I have is that I need to add or change a field in the template. For now, I'm using clever VIM searches and macros to manage the templates. Is there a better way, preferably using an Emacs or org-mode feature?
 In some cases where the field content is short, I've gotten away with using a table. But that is the exceptional case, usually the field content is too long to make a table useful.

I wouldn't be surprised if the code I wrote is just bad somehow too... 
 What I'm doing: evaluate the following elisp, then with M-: run one of the functions like (rex/frame-init-ibm). This causes the faces in the list in rex/frame-init-aux to be applied to this and every subsequent frame. When I run (rex/frame-init-inconsolata), the frame uses some kind of serif variable-pitch font from my system as if it can't find the Inconsolata font (without throwing any errors) unless I run …]]></summary>

There are a few topics that interest me. For example, in my job, I like to keep on top of certain technology trends and it's useful to me to track them. The stories I find might be slight, but I'm more interested in a larger pattern that they represent. The pattern may or may not be obvious at first, or it may end up going in a different direction than what I expected, or it may end up being noise.
My idea is that I would create a note documenting what interests me about the story and have a structure note representing the broader trend, but curious if others have thoughts on the merits and demerits of this kind of approach within a zettelkasten framework.
The concern I have is that I will fall prey to the collector's fallacy, and end up with a bunch of notes that are little more than "So this happened."]]></summary>

From my understanding, the main benefit is more intelligent syntax highlighting (which I could be down for), but I am wondering, is it worth re-building emacs and going through the hassle? What are the general benefits and how noticeable of an improvement are they? I've heard the bad parts are performance issues.

The new version vhdl-mode 3.39 is out with some enhancements and fixes:
 VHDL-2019 support Style and template enhancements Enhanced compilation error parsing Many indentation fixes Emacs 28/29 support 
 Please check out the complete list of changes and the download link at
 http://www.iis.ee.ethz.ch/~zimmi/emacs/vhdl-mode.html
 Please report any bugs, especially regarding indentation, as well as any missing support for VHDL-2008/2019. That's the most important features I want to keep up-to-date in vhdl-mode.
 Happy coding! Reto

 NORMAL and BEACON mode : Erase word without yank ? 's' copy the deleted word, so can not paste the previous copy just after. 
 BEACON mode : No cursors or hightlight of selected words in beacon mode ? How to see where will be the modifications. You press ‘w’, ‘i’, “do modification”, ‘ESC’ but before to press ESC you don’t see where will be the modifications. Maybe, I have a visual issue. 
 Is there some tuto/video to do basics multi-cursor(BEACON-mode) use ?

 With compiled Heist it seems like there's a rather narrow happy path that you are supposed to take: have an application monad and access that from within your (runtime) splices to fetch data from the database.
 There is a Stack Overflow answer that hints at the possibility to also get data into compiled splices outside of a monad but the Heist documentation for initHeist says:
  
We don't provide functions to add either type of loadtime splices to your HeistState after initHeist because it doesn't make any sense unless you re-initialize all templates with…]]></summary>

 But in emacs evil mode when I try to bind C-c to the same functionality it works in some places But when modes like haskell-mode is turned on it just starts to wait for a keychord I was wondering is there a way to work around that
 I had an idea of maybe introducing a state like emacs state Suppose I am in evil state and everything is working like vim I mean all the motions and then I press say “C-z” which toggles evil mode Now I am in emacs state and all the emacs key-chords start working
 Is there a way that I can achieve that?

 I'm using emacs 29.1 on WSL2. (I'm pretty sure this was an issue on emacs 28 as well)

 EDIT: OK, found the solution. An update in the doom-modeline breaks the `all-the-icons` package, so you have to use `nerd-icons` and its respective install fonts command.

 I'm using Emacs from Homebrew (29.1), and I had the following in my old configuration file:
 (setq mac-option-modifier '(:function alt :mouse alt) mac-right-command-modifier 'super mac-right-option-modifier 'hyper ns-alternate-modifier 'super ns-command-modifier 'meta ns-pop-up-frames nil) 
 This was cargo-cult stuff, though, cribbed from someone else's config (whom I can't remember). I tried to shrink it down to just this:
 (setq mac-option-modifier 'super mac-right-option-modifier 'hyper) 
 Because I really just need the super keysym working. But it doesn't-- I keep getting the alt keysym (doing a C-h k and using the key gives me something like "A-q", for example).
 Is there a good resource for these variables?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On behalf of maintainers I'm happy to announce tasty-1.5 RC1. Here is the changelog:
  
Progress reporting is no longer ignored. PrintTest constructor of TestOutput now has an extra field used to report progress. Supply const (pure ()) as this extra field value if you want to skip progress reporting (#311).
 foldGroup now takes [b] instead of b as its last argument to allow for custom fold strategies. This is a backwards incompatible change, but you can get the old behavior by applying mconcat (#364).
 Dependency loop error now lists all test cases that formed a cycle (#340).
 Dependencies can now be defined pattern-free with sequentialTestGroup (#343).
 Added --min-duration-to-report flag that specifies the time a test must take before tasty outputs timing information (#341).
 When a test failed with an exception, print it using displayException instead of show (#330).
 The -p/--pattern option can be specified multiple times; only tests that match all patterns are run (#380).
 Fix color scheme to make info messages visible in terminals with white background (#369).
 When parsing of a command-line option failed, report received option (#368).
 Support WASM (#365).
  
You can give it a try using the following cabal.project:

 If all goes well, the release is scheduled for mid September.

 Haskell excels because it's truly an amazing language.
 ML has become interesting because it crossed this viability threshold in the last year where it unlocks many new exciting use cases.
 I've long considered that Haskell is the best lang+ecosystem in every way, except it doesn't have as much community momentum as python/JS, eg not as many libraries, not as much adoption.
 ML Benefits:
  
ML makes bridging that gap significantly easier; it's significantly easier to write and translate new libraries into Haskell
 
It makes onboarding new people to the community easier by helping them write code before they necessarily grasp all the language's nuances (yes this is a two-edged sword).

 The problem is that if I split wide screen into 4 it is too narrow for me. Can I limit number of windows so it stays 2 as on laptop? I found function to query this value but not to set it.

An opportunity that I couldn’t pass up by David Thrane Christiansen
A rare opportunity came by, and I will be returning to a full-time developer role at the beginning of October. Based on the hard work of our volunteers, the board, and our collaborators, the Haskell Foundation has become a key part of the community’s infrastructure. This will not stop - we’ve arranged for project work to continue after my last day, and the next ED will take over an organization in action.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Does anyone have experience in writing some very simple games in a functional language. I tried it and failed miserably. My approach was really bad. I tried to do an OO approach and everything got tangled in IORefs, IOs and a billion functions that do a lot of stuff and are difficult to refactor. 
 I would like to know if someone has tried this before and how they went about it. Let's say you have this very simple game, at the start you can choose how many players can play, they choose their name, the deck is shuffled, the players are put in a circular queue and the game begins. To play, simply write the card you want taken out of the pool in the order chosen. The game loop ends when no cards are left in the pool. How would you design something like this? How would you add on top? Is it possible to use an OO approach, where different "objects" can communicate with each other, or is another pattern better? 
 Thanks!

 as I work on a couple of c/c++ projects I configured lsp and ccls. whilst they seem to work, it is not working as intended (for me).
 I have a project, let's name it project1. the root directory of project1 has a CMakeLists.txt file, another folder named "Arduino" with all Arduino libraries and a folder called "app" which includes my custom code.
 ​
 When I navigate to /project1/app and click on a .cpp file. ccls sets that as the root folder. the issue here is that definitions are not all being processes meaning if I would input a .h file not in /app I am not able to go to its definition or get any syntax help..
 ​
 I have tried to add a .ccls-root and .ccls file in /project1 but ccls seems to ignore this and creates a .ccls-cache always in /project1/app once I hopen a .cpp file in app.
 ​
 Does anyone know how to solve this or is this intended this way? I am also using projectile and treemacs! I appreciate all the help!
 here is part of my config regarding lsp and ccls
 ​
 ​
 (defun efs/lsp-mode-setup ()
 (setq lsp-headerline-breadcrumb-segments '(path-up-to-project file symbols))
 (lsp-headerline-breadcrumb-mode))
 ​
 (use-package lsp-mode
 :commands lsp
 :hook ((typescript-mode js2-mode web-mode) . lsp)
 :bind (:map lsp-mode-map
 ("TAB" . completion-at-point))
 :custom (lsp-headerline-breadcrumb-enable nil))

 (use-package ccls
 :hook ((c-mode c++-mode objc-mode cuda-mode) .
 (lambda () (require 'ccls) (lsp))))
 (setq ccls-executable "/usr/bin/ccls")

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Using org-super-agenda is it possible to only list the parent task in a project?
 Currently it seems that when I have tasks with sub-tasks and sub-sub-tasks each task-with-a-child is classed as project, even if they are part of a "parent" task. 
 In the example below, Project 1 and Task 1.1 both have children, but I want to only count Project 1 as the project (i.e. it's the parent) as well as Project 2. 
 * TODO Project 1 ** TODO Task 1.1 *** TODO Task 1.1.1 ** TODO Task 1.2 * TODO Project 2 ** TODO Task 2.1 * TODO Task 3 
 However, if I run the sample code Task 1.1 is included.
 (let ((org-super-agenda-groups '((:name "Projects" :children t) (:discard (:anything t))))) (org-todo-list)) 
 What I'm looking for is something similar to Bernt Hansen's project definition. I'm happy to keep using that if org-super-agenda doesn't do this...

Given that SVG can be quickly displayed at any scale, I stick the following in my org-mode config. It rescales all latex preview fragments correctly with the text size as you zoom text. Works pretty much instantly, since no image regeneration is required.
 Looking forward to Org 9.7 and super fast preview rendering. Thanks to the org devs!

For mathematical equations previews works perfectly with dvipng, but since dvipng doesn't play well with tikz-cd based commutative diagrams I changed to using imagemagick by setting org-preview-latex-default-process. However, when using imagemagick my latex previews (equations, diagrams etc) come out huge -- the text itself is appropriately sized, but the "frame" of the image is huge. See the below for examples:
 With Imagemagick: https://i.stack.imgur.com/SWS65.png
 With Dvipng: https://i.stack.imgur.com/yRkTV.png
 As you can see, in the first example the image is so large the lorem ipsum paragraph isn't even in view.
 How can I fix this? I would really like to use imagemagick for commutative diagrams, but having such huge images is unwieldy.

I posted this a while back but didn't get a response. Really sorry for posting again, but I'm still struggling with it!!! Thanks in advance for any thoughts.
When I use this function, The Archive copies the title of the note and the identifier, and pastes them like this:
[[201930091959 Alexander Gordon]]
It was my understanding, from reading the forum and blog posts over the years, that best practice was NOT to include the title of the note in any link, as the title may well change in the future and rather to link using the unique ID. So, I do this, with only the ID actually linking:
[Alexander Gordon][[201930091959]]
Any thoughts? Why does The Archive include the title when generating the link?
Cheers.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a pretty basic setup for writing org files with jupyter and converting that to an ipynb with pandoc. The problem I'm running into though is that the code blocks never recognize the conda environment. Below is my workflow for it and the error.
 ​
 This basically sets up my session and activates my conda environment, which is confirmed by the second command. This seems to work just fine.
 ```
 +BEGIN_SRC shell :session qiskit :results output
 conda activate tutorials
 echo $CONDA_PROMPT_MODIFIER
 +END_SRC
 ```
 Then I run some basic code and it fails at the imports with No module named 'jsonpickle'
 ```
 +BEGIN_SRC jupyter-python :session qiskit :results output :exports both
 import time import warnings from pathlib import Path
 import jsonpickle import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
 import numpy as np from scipy import interpolate
 +END_SRC
 ```
 So I added in another block to check that it was installed with
 ```
 +BEGIN_SRC shell :session qiskit :results output
 pip3 freeze | grep pickle
 +END_SRC
 ```
 When running that it shows I have jsonpickle installed. On top of that, even outside of the conda environment I have jsonpickle installed, so if it wasn't recognizing the environment and went without one then I don't know how that error would appear. Taking the same code and putting it in a python file and running that works just fine.

  f :: List InputType -> List OutputType f mylist = case mylist of (x:xs) -> dothingsto x : f xs 
 I'm still learning PureScript, and I'm struggling to do that with Arrays or Strings. As far as I understand, I can't pattern match on arrays in a [x:xs] kind of way, as xs in this case will only match the complete rest of the array exactly.
 For Strings, at least Data.String has no cons. Of course I could List.fromFoldable <<< String.split (Pattern "") to get a List or similarly create a listf of Chars, but being able to do that without would be much cleaner. I'm sure I just don't know enough yet :D
 Also, Pursuit is quite a rabbit hole if one searches type signatures...

 I am using Plasma5. Recently I have a new installation of Emacs, but there is some very confusing behavior.
 Whenever I press M-x, the bottom end of the window moves up a bit (and the rest of the window doesn't change), and when I type a command and press Enter, the bottom end of the window moves up as well. The same thing happens when I use shortcuts like C-x v, etc. When I use it normally for a while, the window is almost down to the top half of the screen.
 I don't know if this is a bug in Emacs or some other program and don't know how to search for this problem, does anyone have any clue?
 Please let me know if I should provide more information.

 im relatively new to doom emacs, been a month using it.
 for my note taking in class, i am trying to use org mode and add images to the text file. 
 the org-download package solves my problem, but i am unable to install it since i dont know what to do on the github page. 
 i dont know where to paste the code/what to do. 
 https://github.com/abo-abo/org-download
 I have however, been responsible and tried to trouble shoot the problem by: 
 ​
 - installing the org download package from package list
 - messing around with the config.el file 
 - researched about melpa
 ​
 despite being a beginner, could someone help me out to get it up and running
 ​
 warm regards, 
 Aryan

 ​
 despite this, nothing really works - i dont think its supposed to, since the github page had more instructions.
 no clue what to do

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey there,
 I'm configuring my Emacs config again, and I'm wondering:
 - What is everyone's favorite file manager in Emacs to quickly rip through a given project directory to access it on the fly?
 Is there anything that would allow it so that the directory could be displayed in the middle portion of the screen as an overlay and would allow you to type a few characters to quickly rip through a project to find the given file you're looking for?
 ​
 I'm basically looking for the 'ripgrep' equivalent of a file manager. I've used Dired through and through, and want a faster workflow for modern web dev projects.
 ​
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I use org-roam and regularly use org-attach to add clippings or even as a save location for babel file outputs (e.g., generating a diagram or figure).
 I'm also a bit naughty, and don't always keep my files entirely atomic. Such that I quite often will retrospectively org-store-link on a heading, assigning it a new ID. But when I do this, any attachments in that section now break, as the results of (org-attach-dir) now are generated from the new ID, not the file-level one. I also generally like the idea of having a single (org-attach-dir) per file; but also to have that (org-attach-dir) be based on the file ID. 
 Is there a way to have (org-attach-dir) use the root/file-level ID for generating its file path? 
 Thank you very much for any advice.
 ​
 Notes:
 I've looked through the archives, with some related posts found but which don't quite match my needs.
  
Question on setting up org-attach folder per file. :: I'd still like to automatically generate from ID
 How to enable org-mode to search attachment in parent header's attachment folder :: this seems to be my question! But there wasn't any satisfactory answer at the time. tag u/shelper9527 
  
I've tried to set the DIR property to the value of (org-attach-dir) at the root, but I don't think its possible to dynamically set properties like this? This would be ideal, as I could do this only for new files, so not breaking files that already exploit inherited IDs.
 I've tried looking into the org-attach-use-inheritance, but it seems its not designed to enforce only using the root property.
 I suppose there is some advice-add magic that could be done to (org-attach-dir)? This would be satisfactory, but less preferred as I don't like over-coupling my org notes to my specific emacs dotfiles.

 I have been making a sound synthesis library which I want to share:
 https://github.com/Simre1/lambdasound 
 Compared to others of its kind, it's more low-level and simpler. You can work directly with audio samples while having some combinators for more complex work. 
 Here's an example:
 main :: IO () main = play 44100 0.5 $ let upwards = sequentially $ note <$> [c4, d4, e4, f4, g4] backwards = reverseSound upwards triad = setDuration quarterNote $ parallel $ note <$> [c3,e3,g3] pause = setDuration quarterNote silence in parallel [ upwards >>> dropSound halfNote backwards, repeatSound 5 $ sequentially [triad, pause, pause, triad] ] where note semitone = easeInOut 3 $ setDuration halfNote (asNote harmonic semitone) 
 If there's interest, I can put up the package on Hackage.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What:
  
I'm using MSYS2 MINGW64 and used used pacman to get: 
 mingw64/mingw-w64-x86_64-emacs 28.2-4
 This version hangs when i invoke package-list-packages 
 I have to kill the process from another mingw64 window
 
 
 I uninstalled that version of emacs and then used pacman to get: 
 msys/emacs 27.2-1 <--- note that this sits in the msys space and not the mingw64 space; and for some reason only works in CLI mode (as if invoked with the -nw option)
 This version does not hang when invoking package-list-packages
 
  
Why: 
  
I'm stuck on windows with absolutely no admin privileges and there are various tools that are so far only for linux and a few only for emacs.
 While I do like the CLI version of emacs I sure would like to use the GUI version. 
 some of the packages will only work in GUI mode... at least i'm pretty sure.
 
 I could use a VM. That is my backup plan. But I'm hoping to avoid that.
  
My troubleshooting so far: 
  
using the built in debugger: 
 setting the debugger to trigger with (package-list-packages) via M-x debug-on-entry only results in an immediate lockup
 
 eww on MINGW64 also hangs in MINGW64 but not in the MSYS version. 
 No eww isn't one of those tools I need, I'm just using it for troubleshooting purposes.
 
 I don't have access to the firewall logs of the host (windows 10). I also can't turn it off.
 emacs messages buffer doesn't provide anything.
 google searches haven't yielded anything useful (that I can understand)
  
How:
  
i dunno.
  
Who:
  
Probably a user error or oversight on my part.
  
I think that's it. I appreciate if anyone read this far. I'm open to suggestions but understand if this is one of those mysteries that will never be solved.
 Thanks in advance and have a great day.

 It is not a new post, but I received today an email from GitHub which caught me off-guard, stating that my account would require 2FA from now on. And I really hate to tie any workflow of mine to the phone. I recalled having read something about it, and some searching brought me back to Mickey's post. Jackpot! Emacs to the rescue, with Mickey's help.
 I ended up doing things a little differently, since my setup is not the same. I store my passwords in a .gpg file, and wanted to retrieve the totp key from there, instead of from auth sources. And I also preferred to use oathtool for the main task, instead of the adapted version of Jürgen Hötzel's `totp.el'. Which, as a bonus, spared me of handling the base32 decoding.
 But Mickey's post was really useful in showing an alternative and laying the ground work. You may find it useful too, since you are likely to have received or to soon receive the same GitHub message (if you didn't already had 2FA set up).

 I hope you are doing well and good, so recently I decided to use the Xmonad window manager. I did so using GHCup and via cabal-install. I said yes to all the options afterwards so installed stack as well as Haskell language server. 
 However I now actually want to learn the language, There is so much stuff online however that it's now confusing me. 
 Can someone please guide me, help me build a small road map perhaps as to how to begin. Also I am confused because someone's using stack , someones using cabal and people suggesting stack but others saying stack is used for big projects ....I am lost guys, any help would be appreciated.

 It is about the known shortcuts like: Ctrl+C = copy, Ctrl+S = save, Ctrl+Z = undo, Ctrl+Q = quit, and 30 more of these.
 It is a work in progress (it is working well but has still has lots of ToDo's), but I would love to get some feedback about it. (and if the feedback is: "completly unnassasary, becase there is something better", that is okay as well)
 I like how I combined Ctrl-c for coping in transient-mark-mode with Ctrl-c keping it's original functionality when nothing is selected. (At least I like the way it works, the elisp-code was just the best I could do).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have long used (set-frame-parameter nil 'alpha 20) and put my Emacs frame on top of a Zoom frame* displaying a presenter's screen share and used this to somewhat inobtrusively provide a place for me to take notes. 
 Emacs 29's alpha-background frame parameter provides some more options to do this, and I was wondering if anyone had other suggestions. One complication is that most people use a white background for their slides, but Zoom will also letterbox or pillarbox it into something with a black background.
 The best thing I've found so far is to set some theme with a black background and white text (I'm open to suggestion on themes for this purpose) and then
 (set-frame-parameter nil 'alpha-background 20) (set-frame-parameter nil 'alpha 60) 
 This seems to have some balance between being able to see the Emacs frame at all and the Emacs frame not obstructing a text-heavy presentation. But if anyone else has tried something else that works, I would love suggestions!
 * using the Emacs terminology here because anything else would be confusing in context

 Can someone please suggest how to change the color of the "CLOSED: " and "SCHEDULED: " line when an item is DONE in the org mode? I have managed to get the header line gray with strikeout based on the code I found in some post (see below). The "DONE" line along with the contents appears gray and has a strike out because of the lisp code below. But the "CLOSED:" line and tags are still bright green. How do I change those based on the done state? Thank you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I’m taking a class that involves Haskell. I’ve never used Haskell before, or any functional programming language for that matter, but I’m really enjoying it so far.
 However, the professor added a Tests.hs file that imports Test.HUnit so we can run and confirm the functions we implemented are correct, at least in a simple form.
 The issue is I’m lost on how to actually run the tests. “ghci :l Tests.hs” gives an import error for Test.HUnit. When looking up the package it mentions “runTestTT” but that just says there is no variable call that so I’m sure I’m running it incorrectly.
 There is also a cabal file that lists HUnit as a dependency. 
 How do I go about getting HUnit working? Thanks for the help!

Read an article or blog post.
Generate a list of atomic ideas to select from.
Create Literature Notes from selection in a given structure and format.

PROMPT: Read article and create notes. v1.0



Hello my friend,
Thank you for taking the time to talk to me. Here is my prompt framework with five steps I want to use to initiate our conversation.
Two hints: It is formatted in mark down. Do not use text marked as comment (%%text%%).
Step 1:  Setting the Stage
Step 2:  Defining the Objective
Step 3: Structuring the Interaction
1. Start Interaction:


2. Extract Atomic Ideas:


3. Identify Key Insights:


4. Ask for selection


5. Create Summaries:


6. Generate Descriptive Titles:



Step 4: Requesting Specific Information
Step 5: Summarizing and Concluding
**TITLE** 
> SUMMARY 
Tags: LIST OF TAGS

Words in CAPITAL LETTERS are placeholders for your input. Start with a new line for each item.
From now on use the rules above. But before starting, feel free to ask me any question that may help you to improve the quality of your answers.
%% More about at: https://github.com/groepl/Take-Useful-Notes %%


I’m sure it will need some experiments to get best results. What are your ideas?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi friends, I do hope my message finds you all well. I recently started learning emacs (with doom emacs) and I'm pretty happy with my setup right now. However, my current daily driver is a low-end laptop, and I wonder what's the best practice to start emacs so it won't load a ton of packages to just edit a 1-2 files. I built emacs29 from source, with native compilation, I'm also lazy loading most of my packages, which are just a few, but I wonder if running `emacs` instead of `emacs -nw` or `emacsclient` , might be affecting my starting up time and cpu/mem consumption. 
 The later implies that I should start the `emacs daemon` on startup? What's the difference between the options I mentioned above? I would appreaciate any suggestion. Thank you in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Many tasks are -- or at least, eventually end up being -- multi-"visit" affairs. In other words, the work may end up being done as several sessions in a single day, or even across multiple days. Either way, it can be useful to log what was done at each "visit". I've tried a couple of methods, in particular with a view to being able to produce some kind of time-filtered status report, perhaps via a clock table (cf. this question) :
  
Use org-add-note (C-c C-z) to add a timestamped note to the task, in the same way that state change notes get added. That's nice and quick in terms of adding the info, but I've never been able to find a way of getting that into any kind of time-filtered report, 
 Create a sub-headline for each "visit" -- usually using org-capture with a C-0 prefix. I'll clock into and then out of that and that means a clock table can pick up the sub-headline to use as my note of progress for that visit. It's tolerable, but it still restricts that progress note to just a headline, and I 'll often want to say more than that. 
  
How do others log progress in tasks? Do many use org-add-note?

 org-timeblock: Multi-day views
 org-timeblock is a new Emacs package that allows you to view and manage your orgmode tasks/events using timeblocking technique, which is implemented in almost all modern calendars.
 org-timeblock is interactive: you can navigate between blocks via mouse or arrow buttons; and then reschedule them or change TODO state. 
 Here's a quick video demonstration: org-timeblock: Multi-day views

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently installed emacs 29.1 in fedora 38 using snap. Specifically using that link https://snapcraft.io/install/emacs/fedora 
 But emacs has this "twitchy" behavior where it goes "back" for a brief moment and returns to the current "state". Let me give me example to illustrate the behavior better: Suppose I am the beginning of a line of text, then I run `C-k` to delete it. The line is deleted, then it shows up again for a brief moment, and then not anymore. Just to clarify, let me add the sequence of events:
  
(line present) Displays line
 (deteles line) `C-k`
 (line deleted) No display line
 (line deleted) Displays line for a brief moment
 (line deleted) No display line
  
This behavior happens with basically everything, meaning the new "state" (a word is typed, a buffer is switched, etc) is displayed and then momentarily goes back to the previous "state" (when the word had been typed, etc).
 My problem felt similar to this https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/112uuse/emacs_29060_is_bit_jumpy_scrolling_when_using/ but it isn't because I emptied my `init.el` and the problem still persists. Also, when I run `emacs -nw` in the terminal, then there is no problem. So, it is something with the rendering, but I have no idea how to even tackle this. Any help/guidance is appreciated.

But sadly after I pulled the change down to my mac connected to very ultra-wide monitor emacs starts up far to the left and half off screen. (I had previously hacked it with some default-frame-alist stuff that was only good for one box).
 TL;DR: desktop saving code below worked great on single monitor laptop, but chokes when second monitor is ultrawide much bigger than laptop screen.
 Here's the code snippet:
 #+begin_src emacs-lisp
 (use-package emacs
 :custom
 (desktop-path '("~/.emacs.d/var/desktop"))
 (desktop-save t)
 :init
 (defun rgr/restore-desktop()
 (when (fboundp 'alert)
 (alert (message (format "loading desktop from %s" desktop-path))))
 ;;I include the run-with-timer despite being able to get this to work without as it's a timing
 ;;issue and a little delay does no one any harm
 (run-at-time "1" nil (lambda()
 (desktop-read)
 (desktop-save-mode 1))))
 (add-hook 'emacs-startup-hook
 (lambda()
 (if (daemonp)
 (add-hook 'server-after-make-frame-hook 'rgr/restore-desktop)
 (rgr/restore-desktop)))))

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello guys. I've been using (neo)vim for 1-2 years now. I use emacs for note-taking only (rarely)
 The reason I use emacs much less than neovim is the simplicity (of lua) and performance.
 I find neovim REALLY fast while It's obvious that emacs is less performant.
 Point of this post is: (as a non-power emacs user) 
 How'd you compare lua vs elisp
 How'd you compare emacs with a "well configured" neovim (in context of lua what is the difference between elisp? [except the power of GUI])
 - There are lot of plugins that will "keep you in neovim" (~~living~~) like plugins that integrate with web (e.g godbolt, stackoverflow etc.)
 - I am no near being a emacs power-user nor a GUI guy
 Why should I use emacs?
 Why not neovim
 ​
 > I think Neovim can "almost" be powerful as emacs (while keeping the performance [0])
 > Is it correct?
 > [HERE IS LINK TO MY CONFIG [WIP] IN NEOVIM](https://github.com/UTFeight/CamelVim) -> there is a feature list in README (outdated)

 I'm successfully build a REST API via Haskell/Servant and have a OpenAPI spec generated by Servant .
 I'm thinking of building a web UI that enable user to play around with the API.
 Is there any way to automatically generate web UI form from openAPI spec or Haskell types ? 
 I've tried with https://github.com/rjsf-team/react-jsonschema-form ,but the performance is poor when dealing with deep nested form with many inputs.

 I am emacs noob so forgive me if this is a dumb question.
 I have FlyMake running for java as shown in the screenshot. Is there any way that FlyMake shows how to fix error suggestions or is that simply not a feature of FlyMake? Like in the screenshot example, I want FlyMake to make the suggestion to import java.util.Scanner since I am using a scanner, not just simply tell me that there's some error because it can't find a Scanner object, that kind of stuff.

I'm wondering if some of you went through this or had some suggestions for that kind of project (bonus point if it resonates with some real use case of Haskell, and is not a generic portfolio project that I would do with any other language).

My name is Kostas and I am 42 years old, having a wonderful family and for the last 20 years I have worked as a computer system and network engineer.
Two years ago I was hired by an international company and changed my career path, so I am currently working as DevOps. After this change, I noticed that I had some knowledge gaps I wanted to fill and some skills I wanted to improve.
I read technical documentation and watch online courses or webinars about technologies that were not my area of expertise, practices that are mostly in the software engineering world, new network or security concepts, and other stuff related to the so called "soft skills", such as How to Write Technical Documentation, How to become Persuasive, Give successful presentation, foreign languages. And on top of that I have lots of family concerns such as, family psychology, recurring tasks, hobbies and other.
For all the above, my brain cannot keep everything and thus the search some months ago brought me in front of some new to me methods, like zettelkasten, BASB, How to Take Smart Notes and lots of software. But to be honest, I haven't found my own workflow yet, what system to follow and what software to combine. I hope "building-a-second-brain-and-zettelkasten" will be something I could use for tasks and knowledge, but we'll see 
I read so many great forum posts here and shared workflows, I watch your great videos in youtube and I try to adjust my workflow when I see something that could make it better.
I'm glad that I join zettelkasten.de forums]]></summary>

 First, the problem description: As part of my 29.1 overhaul of my configuration I decided to add the pdf-tools package. I based my use-package block almost verbatim off of Sophie Bosio's configuration. This has the advantage of delaying the install of the package until you first load a PDF.

It's definitely not my internet connection, since I also tried it on a virtual Linux machine and it worked fine.

Perhaps I didn't delete everything before reinstalling, I don't know where data is cached and I really don't want to reinstall Linux to fix this. Any advice?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A while ago I noticed that after Emacs I did have all the magit commands available, but forge wasn't loaded properly -- I saw no topics (Issues and Pull requests) not even in the project where I knew there were some and where I'd previously run forge-pull to set the local state up properly.
 Yesterday I thought I'd see if I could fix this. So started with trimming my setup down to the bare minimimum
 ``` (use-package magit :custom (magit-display-buffer-function #'magit-display-buffer-traditional))
 (use-package forge :after magit) ```
 and found that to be working well, i.e. I didn't have to manually "start" forge by running e.g. forge-pull. I then re-introduced my setup piece by piece to see when it breaks. (Luckily it's not very big.)
 In the end I made this change, where the relevant bit is this:
  (use-package forge :after magit - :general + :config (mes/despot-def forge-post-mode-map "c" '("submit" . forge-post-submit) 
 That is, I swapped the use of :general to :config when bringing in forge. (I'm still using :general when setting up magit as using :configresulted in keybindings going missing.)
 I can't pretend I know what's going on here, but my gut tells me there's some "interesting" interaction between straight.el, general.el going on.
 I'd love an explanation, but I'll be happy enough if this post will reduce someone else's head scratching when observing something similar.

 When I started college, I needed to create my school schedules mostly from scratch (selecting individual classes and checking that my classes didn't overlap). Unfortunately, doing it manually is very tiring, slow and prone to error. 
 So I thought: why not automate it? this is the result of that experiment. Ofc, this is a haskell sub, so obviously it is written in haskell. I'd appreciate very much if someone more experienced than me wants to take a look at the code for some feedback! :)
 Basically schedule-maker works by creating a yaml file with the specification of the classes you might consider taking. Then run schedule-maker classes.yaml and it will spit out a schedules.xlsx file with a valid schedule per worksheet.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to offload multi-line templates in my org-config to files to make formatting both the template and my config simpler. However I'm running into type issues.
 Excerpt:
 (defvar my/org-capture-templates-dir "~/org/templates/org-capture" "Directory for \\='org-capture\\=' template files.") (defun org-journal-find-location () "Open today's journal. Specify a non-nil prefix to inhibit inserting the heading" (org-journal-new-entry t) (goto-char (point-min))) (setq org-capture-templates '(("j" "Journal Capture Group") ("jd" "Daily Goals" entry (function org-journal-find-location) (file (concat my/org-capture-templates-dir "daily-goals.org")) :empty-lines 1) ("jj" "Journal" entry (function org-journal-find-location) "* %(format-time-string org-journal-time-format)%^{Title}\n%i%?"))) 
 Problem: When I try to invoke the template with 'C-c c j d' I get:
 org-capture: Wrong type argument: stringp, (concat my/org-capture-templates-dir "/daily-goals.org") 
 I can use 'C-c c j j' perfectly fine to append a new entry in my Journal file.
 I can get it to work as desired if I instead replace the concat with the string I expect to get like so:
 (setq org-capture-templates '(("j" "Journal Capture Group") ("jd" "Daily Goals" entry (function org-journal-find-location) (file "~/org/templates/org-capture/daily-goals.org") :empty-lines 1))) 
 Question: There's something I'm not understanding about how to use the output of the concat function as a string for a filename here. I'd prefer not to type the full file name every time, especially as I define more templates. How can I get the concat to work?
 ​
 For reference, the template 'daily-goals.org' contents are:
 * %(format-time-string org-journal-time-format)Daily Goals Today I plan to: 1. %^{goal-one} 2. %^{goal-two} 3. %^{goal-three} %? 
 Also, my full capture config can be found here: paraparity configuration.org. I'll always welcome feedback on my config and how I can terse up some of my emacs lisp.

Is there a way to save the window configuration, narrowed regions, and cursor placement for them so i get the exact same desktop when I return as when I last closed Emacs?
 I use desktop-save-mode but it doesn't seem to save cloned-indirect buffers or narrowing.
 I do this when preparing teaching lessons. I have a window showing 3-4 learning goals in one small buffer, my study notes in a cloned indirect buffer, and my instruction notes in another cloned indirect buffer. Thanks for any help.

I've solved a lot of the push problems with auto commiting on change and hooks to push but am looking to solve the pull problem when I move to the other machine.
 I'm thinking about trying to use idle timers, since both are running emacs daemons, to do that but was wondering a) if anyone had any experience trying something like that and any found pitfalls or footguns; or 2) if there is a better/simpler way that I'm overlooking

 Depending on the things one wants to evaluate, it could be very useful like calls to (text-property-search-forward) for instance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For ages I have tried and failed to come up with an Org mode approach to answering the eternal question we often ask ourselves:
  
What (TF!) did I work on this week?
  
Or, more to the point, I want to get Org mode to answer the following question, often asked of us by our managers:
  
What did you work on this week?
  
In other words, I'd like to get Org mode to generate a share-able report that:
  
Draws from some pre-defined subset of all my org files. For example: all files in org-agenda-files plus whatever is in org-agenda-text-search-extra-files
 Includes any given headline (from the above files) if and only if it has a clock entry in a specified period -- last week, two months ago, etc
 Lists the headlines in chronological order (ascending, or user-selectable)
 Displays the headline itself, plus the relevant clock entry and associated text (i.e. it's not just an clock table)
 Is exportable using org-export-dispatch << This is important because the report is for more than just my own benefit. So, a mere dynamic view within emacs is not sufficient. I need to be able to produce a PDF, or HTML, or the like.
 Can do all this based only on the data and meta-data in the headlines themselves. That is, it should achieve my desired data output format without enforcing on me a data storage format. I'm adding this requirement because my (partial) solution to the problem so far has been to store my daily notes in a datetree format (fed by org-capture), which encodes information not just with a heading's data and meta-data but also in its position. But that is neither a complete solution, nor a good one even where it does go part way.
  
How would/do you achieve this or something like it?[1]
 thx!
 [1] Ideally, using Org out-of-the-box, without having to write a bunch of lisp. But, failing that, I'd take pointers to lisp approaches. (TBH, I'd take the lisp itself, if you had it, but that would be above and beyond the call on your part! :-) )

 I've been out of the Scala scene for a couple of years, and looking to find employment in my fav language again. What's changed?
 Essentially, what I'm wondering is whether it's worth it professionally to double-down on Scala in '23, if what I want to do is FP, DSLs or, at the very least, core-Scala, and not Spark?
  
What are the trends for industry adoption, besides Spark?
 
Is Spark still "the killer app"? (I've done some Spark, can't say I liked it)
 
Is Scala 3 gaining traction in industry?
 
Are Cats/ZIO gaining traction, becoming more niche, and have the culture wars finally stopped?

 configure: error: X11/extensions/Xrandr.h (from libXrandr) is required 
 Which makes sense, so I installed libXrandr from my distribution's package manager (Gentoo). But unlike the many other times I have installed XMonad on a glibc system, this time installing libXrandr did not get the error to go away.
 I additionally installed libXinerama through my package manager but the output also complained that it does not find it, but it's not required like Xrandr is so it's not a big deal.
 I run the following command as indicated by the page of the custom GHC build.
 stack install --ghc-options ' -static -optl-static -optl-pthread -fPIC' --docker --docker-image "utdemir/ghc-musl:v25-ghc944" --no-nix 
 My stack.yaml contains the following:
 resolver: ghc-9.4.4 packages: xmonad-git xmonad-contrib-git extra-deps: 'random-1.2.1' 'X11-1.10.3' 'data-default-class-0.1.2.0' 'setlocale-1.0.0.10' 'X11-xft-0.3.4' 'utf8-string-1.0.2' 'splitmix-0.1.0.4' 
 I'd imagine it has do to with GHC being a docker image but I can't be too sure.The issue is that despite installing the required dependency which would normally fix this trivial error,stack does not recognize that it has been installed.
 Please keep in mind that I'm in no way knowledgeable in anything Haskell related. Feel free to ask for any output or information.
 Any hints towards the right directions are greatly appreciated. Cheers!
