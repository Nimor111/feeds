        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Howdy, folks. Curious if anyone has come up with a good way to handle viewing stdout/stderr of Org Babel code blocks -- particularly sh/shell and sometimes async -- in real-time? I'm leaning quite heavily on code blocks for some technical documentation Literate DevOps-style and some of the commands I run can take 20-30 seconds or more. It would be nice to see what's going on in a buffer or frame while the command is doing its thing.
 I found a random .el file on GH called ob-shstream.el but it seems to have some problems with undefined functions or functions that have been renamed since it was written (ex: fourth -> cl-fourth) and I'm not a great elisp hacker so I'm not sure I want to try to clean it up if there are other options out there.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Gnus has a limitation that it cannot bind more than one "from" sending method to the same outgoing server. This means that my three different gmail sending methods won't normally work despite using different credentials.
 My work-around is effective, though it has a couple of limitations. Here's what I do:
 edit my /etc/hosts file to include "aliases" to the same IP address, which IP I can usually get by. eg, using ping. The lines in /etc/hosts end up looking something like this:
 74.125.142.109 smtp.gmail2.com 74.125.142.109 smtp.gmail3.com 
 At that point I just say to Gnus that my outgoing server is using the gmail2, or gmail3 server, etc. Problems with this are for some of my outgoing servers on dynamic IPs that periodically change, meaning that I need to change my etc/hosts file to keep up with their changes. The other problem builds on this since I changed to guix, when changing my etc hosts isn't as trivial as it once was, this is constructed from guix reconfigure, which can be more time consuming. Does anyone have a more graceful work around?

 The problem is that the PLAN.org file never has Org-Mode enabled when an instance launches. Instead, I have to enable it manually every time after launch.
 However, today I noticed that it did enable when I got en error from another, unrelated line of .emacs file (package called Sly and is unrelated to Org-Mode). That is, if the execution of .emacs was not fully complete, then the Org-Mode was enabled by default in that file. What is going on? How can I fix it so that it is enabled by default at all times, whenever a new instance is launched?

 Ok, now I got the culprit with the help of u/yantar92 . Actually I wasn't following files, but I had added two more org link types via org-add-link-type (page: and journal:). And I hadn't defined actions for those in org-link-frame-setup.

 So my workaround is this:
 (let* ((result (ivy-read "Search or enter new page name: " #'counsel-fzf-function :re-builder #'ivy--regex-fuzzy :dynamic-collection t)) (page-name (if (or (string= result "Nothing found") (string= result "error code 1")) ;; ;; This here is redundant as I have typed it in `ivy-read` anyway (read-string "Enter new page name: ") (file-name-sans-extension (file-name-nondirectory result)))) (page-filename (replace-regexp-in-string "[ ]+" "-" page-name))) (list result page-name page-filename)) 
 I try to read via ivy-read, if it finds nothing, I let the user type his initial search again via (read-string "Enter new page name: "). This is not user friendly.
 So I would like to know: Is there a way to get the input in the first step via ivy-read?
 Edit
 Or to put it this way:
 How can I get the user input if completing-read has no match?

 My solution:
 getIndexZero :: (Eq a) => a -> [a] -> Int getIndexZero = ((fromJust .).elemIndex) getIndexOne :: (Eq a) => a -> [a] -> Int getIndexOne = (((1 + ) . ) . getIndexZero) solve :: Int -> [Int] -> [Int] solve 0 _ = [] solve n list = (solve (n-1) list) ++ [getIndexOne (getIndexOne n list) list] 
 Any other approach that could eliminate the recursive function? Still Looks a bit like imperative style to me. Do let me know if there's any other subreddit dedicated to these kinds of questions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As the title says, I'm new to Emacs (coming from Neovim). I'm trying to configure treesitter highlights but for some reason it seems like it struggles with JSX. In Neovim (using treesitter as well) this is highlighted correctly. Right now my setup includes only typescript-mode, tree-sitter and tree-sitter-langs. And I activate them manually, first typescript-mode and then the tree-sitter ones. I notice treesitter highlight it's active, but still don't know why the parser seems to stuggle when it doesn't in Neovim, aren't those the same parsers anyways?
 ​
 Notice the different <div> </div> highlights
 As I said I'm new to Emacs so sorry if I'm missing something:
 This is what I have to config this:
  (use-package typescript-mode) (use-package tree-sitter) (use-package tree-sitter-langs) (global-tree-sitter-mode) 
 Then I activate the modes as I mentioned earlier. Any help is welcomed.
 ​
 The same code but in Neovim (also with tree-sitter)
 Pd.: I've tried multiple themes.
 Update: Changed example images to simpler ones.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Idk much at all about Haskell tbh. I’m only using it for the first time here so I can implement some lambdas and I thought this language would be the best.
 Here are a few I made which all seem to work fine…
 succ = (\x f y -> f( x f y )) 
 zero = (\x y -> y) 
 one = succ(zero) 
 two = succ(one) 
 three = succ(two) 
 add = (\x y -> x succ y) 
 true = (\x y -> x) 
 false = (\x y -> y) 
 and = (\x y -> x y false) 
 not = (\x -> x false true) 
  
these used to read church numerals and booleans
  
incr = (\n-> n + 1) 
 eval = (\n -> n(incr)(0))
 bval = (\b -> b(“true”)(“false”) 
 Now things get weird when I try this…
 isZero = (\x -> x false not false)
 This function works if I apply zero and one…
 bval(isZero(zero)) => “true”
 bval(isZero(one)) => “false”
 …but not any numbers greater. 
 bval(isZero(two)) => error
 When it type checks it says it can’t construct an infinite type. 
 Similarly, when I define a predecessor, it works if I apply one thing to it, but I can’t seem to apply it to things, eg
 eval(pred(three)) => 2
 eval(pred(four)) => 3
 eval(two pred four) => error
 Can anyone explain what’s happening? Why these work in the lambda calculus but not in Haskell?
 EDIT: some for clarity and format

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[hello,
 Since emacs was reccomended to me many times, I decided to sit down and go through the tutorial. 
 Immediately though the idea that you navigate with "f" for forward, "b" for backwards, "n" for next line, "p" for previous seems counterintuitive. The keys have no logical physical relationship to each other. I am not going to remember the mnemonics. 
 Is there some bigger picture rationality that will fall into place if I go on or is the whole thing so arbitrary? 
 I did like the concepts of how the navigation worked. I can really see how it would be fast if learned.
 Not sure I will be able to acheive comfort with what I am seeing. I dont work in the kind of environment where I'd be able to practice all day. just on my own time. 
 thoughts? encouragement?

 I am using eglot for python (and yaml, latex). Today I was fixing some big python code base, and I realize that I have no simple way of running the tests. I did a quick search in the Emacs web site, but they recommend python-pytest or pytest or elpy, I discarded the first one since it depends on projectile (and I prefer project.el) the second one was updated four years ago and elpy seems to overlap with eglot. 
 So I am assumming that I am doing something wrong... Currently I am using eglot AND elpy, but only using elpy for run tests ... Any advice?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A couple of days ago, a post was made about modelling data in Scala 3 with types, and the OP was asked "yes, but what use is it?".
 I've developed an interesting use for this kind of thing with opaque types and inlines: https://scastie.scala-lang.org/mmmB090CRFqUgGYhpvyX9w
 ```scala import scala.compiletime.constValue import scala.compiletime.error import scala.compiletime.ops.int.ToString import scala.util.Failure import scala.util.Success import scala.util.Try
 //probably replaceable with IsConst, but IsConst is @experimental trait SingletonType[T]: inline val t: T
 object SingletonType: transparent inline given [T]: SingletonType[T] = new SingletonType[T]: inline val t = constValue[T]
 object Test: opaque type PositiveInt <: Int = Int 
 object PositiveInt: inline def apply[T <: Int & Singleton](using s: SingletonType[T]): PositiveInt = inline if s.t >= 0 then s.t else error("Cannot interpret " + constValue[ToString[T]] + " as PositiveInt")
 def apply(i:Int): Try[PositiveInt] = if i >= 0 then Success(i) else Failure(new Exception(s"Cannot interpret $i as PositiveInt")) 
 import Test.PositiveInt //needed to keep the opaque type opaque
 val a = PositiveInt[4] //val b = PositiveInt[-2] //compile-time error "Cannot interpret -2 as PositiveInt" val c: Try[PositiveInt] = PositiveInt(a) //runtime check ```
 Please note that these kinds of checks can be extended to other types that support singletons (Strings for example). Strings are not as well supported by scala 3 when it comes to inline if, so you have to check the data at compile time using macros, making things slightly more complicated, but it still works.
 I'm still trying to find a way to generalize this pattern, but in any case, I think it's very useful. It allows you to transform data at compile time to a more specific type, and have compile-time errors if your data doesn't match the necessary predicates.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm looking for a blog post I read a couple of years ago, I think it references Haskell quite a bit but it wasn't primarily about the language itself. I've been trying to find it for a while now, hopefully someone here remembers it.
 The core idea was that when devs compare programming languages, when they look down towards lower level languages they see obvious deficiencies, but when they look up towards higher level languages they don't see the advantages and just think "huh, that's strange". For example, a Python dev would look at C and think "Clearly it's missing a GC and classes" but then look at Haskell and think "What a strange language, why would I want Monads?". But similarly, a C dev would look at Python and think "Why would anyone want a GC"?
 This idea has stuck with me and I'd like to revisit the blog post I got it from, so any help or pointers to it would be appreciated!

To share what we learned we put together a high level guide that also has specifics on how we made our translation service more reliable.

My program is basically just FizzBuzz:

I'm pretty new to this but I tested out the program in an online compiler and it worked there so I don't think it's a problem with the program itself.
 EDIT: After trying "stack run" a few more times the line "module Main where" now gives the error

 ghci> f :: (Num a, Ord b) => a -> b -> a; f = undefined ghci> :t f 1 2 f 1 2 :: Num a => a -- okay, I expect this ghci> f :: (Ord a, Num b) => a -> b -> a; f = undefined -- swap Ord and Num ghci> :t f 1 2 f 1 2 :: (Ord a, Num a) => a -- why is a also Num? 
 can somebody explain to me why the compiler infers Num for a in the second example? Thanks

I know It is possible to to add in the .emacs (global-set-key [f4] 'compile) to compile, but I want to compile and run with only one shortcut. For example in the Geany, You can compile and run, after the compile, it is created a new window to run the file, it is possible to do anything similar in Emacs? Only to run, compile it is good start to me.
 Sorry for the English, English it is not my native language.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sorry if the title didn't make any sense.
 I am tasked with migrating data from database A to database B continuously.
 Database A will be pushing notifications saying "row ${id} in table ${tableName} has been updated" or, "new row ${id} created in table ${tableName}".
 My job is to fetch this new/updated row, and create/update this same row in Database B.
 The problem: whenever I need to fetch something from database A, I need to know its schema (unless there's an equivalent to Any in Haskell?).
 I have about 400 tables, each with their own columns and datatypes... writing those 400 tables manually would be madness.
 
 My idea is to, at the start of the application, ask database A for all its tables and their columns. 
 So I might get hundreds of something like this:
 sql TABLE table1 ( name VARCHAR(256) NOT NULL, age INT NOT NULL )  (parsing the SQL syntax isn't a problem)
 which I want to convert to something like:
  data Table1 = Table1 { name :: String , age :: Int } 
 Then, somehow, when I get a notification like:
 "new row ${id} created in table ${table1}",
 I need to link this table1 to the Table1 type, so I can parse it correctly when I fetch one of its rows.
 Is this a very stupid idea? Should I even bother type-checking this?
 Thanks.

 Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhuHCtR3xq8
 Which made me come back to Haskell and try out what Brian did explain.
 I managed to reproduce the shoving/binding of a -> Ma functions. My test code lives here: https://github.com/xddq/why-monads-make-lives-easier/blob/main/Test.hs
 In the video he explains that M can be any monad, and does not have to be a specific one.
 I did not get this to work. Where should I look to get this working? How would this code look like for these example functions:
 ```
 numToMonad :: a -> [a] numToMonad x = [a]
 numToMonad2 :: a -> Maybe a numToMonad2 x | even x = Just x | otherwise = Nothing
 shoveIt :: a -> Maybe a shoveIt x = numToMonad x >>= numToMonad2
 ```
 Did I misunderstand the video? Is this not possible?
 Thank you in advanvce!

 I use org-roam and the one thing that I really like but struggle to use on my low-spec linux machine is org-roam-ui. It really uses up a lot of memory (although I'm told switching to a chromium based browser might help performance) and is pretty laggy.
 I do have an iPad however, and it would be absolutely perfect if I could use org-roam-ui on it. I tried to do the next best thing and used Logseq, and I do get a nice graph, but the nodes include random bits of org headers and markdown, and don't take me to the appropriate note when I tap on them.
 Has anyone managed to setup up org-roam-ui or equivalent on their iPad, using Logseq or otherwise?

And v0.99 is on Melpa now, with a couple of interesting new things since the last version, including a working set-up for Equake on GNOME Shell under Wayland. (Details on how that was done here: Equake: A Geas on Gnomish Smiths.)

 This is a bit like when Wolfgang Pauli was asked what the most amazing thing he'd ever encountered in physics was. He said "A thermos! I put something cold in, and it keeps it cold. I put something hot in and it keeps it hot. How does it know what to do?!" How does fac know what to do?

 I have been studing haskell for some 2 years now, to the point where I can write leetcode decently (the thing I am learning right now, understand but not fully yet are monad transformers)
 I have looked into ihp and yesod, ran some small amount of code in them, but both seem to have a lot of framework specific knowledge needed, and "reinvent the wheel" to an extent.
 I am wondering if there is a "flask for haskell", a very simple web framework that you can learn very little about and start coding. That is, write html rather than some haskell variation, write SQL rather than some haskell variation, and just need to learn a couple of simple functions. 
 I would not mind if the framework included its own type-safe versions of SQL and HTML for latter. Actually I'd appreciate that, so that I could grow into the framework (is this the case for yesod? I used the yesod book, and it went to its custom versions of html and such straight away, but maybe I can "turn those on" as I go?). 
 But to begin, I'd like the "most straighforward to a person who knows a bit of haskell and vanilla backend programming".
 Thanks!

 ​
 The languages I use are the following:
  
C 
Java
 Python
 Haskell
 Elisp (duh)
  
For each of these I'd like to have some basic but essential features:
  
Syntax highlighting
 Code completion
 Folding
 Interactively compile and run from an emacs buffer
 Everything else one should except from a decent editor
  
​
 The problem is that there are so many modes that I really do not know which one to use. Also, there are LSPs which i did not really understand quite well what they are and how they differentiate from common modes. Does someone have any advice or easy to read config file to share me?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey fellow Zettlers! (This is a crossposting from r/antinet since I am into building a paperbased ZK/AntiNet since 6 weeks as an addition to my digital workhorse).
If it is OK with you, I would like to hear your opinions or get some more ideas:
My daughter is really fascinated by my work with the paper-based Zettelkasten. Which is a no-brainer since she can't watch me working with the digital one.
So I thought it might be a good idea to start one with her as well when she begins elementary school this summer.
What I talked about with her is:
She gets her own AntiNet-Box - we start with just one in A7 (5 1/8 x 7)


Everyday when she comes from school and learned something really interesting or has a question that fascinates her, we write that down, do research, write Bib-Cards and permanent notes of what she wants to keep.


In the evening we show us our cards that we produced that day and install the in our boxes.



The main idea is to get her interested in capturing her knowledge and what she learned, make it tangible and usable for her.
So that is roughly the idea.
Here are some questions for you:
What ideas come to mind when you think about an AntiNet for Kids?
What would you put in there?
How would you categorize it? (Scott’s System might be a bit too complicated for a kid )
What system to link the cards would be helpful?
I have no idea if that works longterm but it might be worth a try.  If she keeps to it and builds up her personal knowledge box piece by piece and Zettel by Zettel that could be really valuable some day.
The project should not just be a collection of Flashcards or learning cards but should teach her the philosophy of building her very own thinking and knowledge tool.
What do you think?]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have an issue with my vanilla emacs 28.1 while using org-capture templates.
 Here's my config:
 (setq org-directory "~/orgfiles") (setq org-capture-templates `(("t" "Tasks / Projects") ("tt" "Task" entry (file+olp "myorg.org" "Inbox") "* TODO %?\n %U\n %a\n %i" :empty-lines 1) ("j" "Journal Entries") ("jj" "Journal" entry (file+olp+datetree "Journal.org.gpg") "\n* %<%I:%M %p> - Journal :journal:\n\n%?\n\n" :clock-in :clock-resume :empty-lines 1) ("jm" "Meeting" entry (file+olp+datetree "Journal.org.gpg") "* %<%I:%M %p> - %a :meetings:\n\n%?\n\n" :clock-in :clock-resume :empty-lines 1) ("o" "Office") ("oo" "Task" entry (file+olp "work_diary.org" "Inbox") "* TODO %?\n %U\n %a\n %i" :empty-lines 1) ("oj" "Journal" entry (file+olp+datetree "Work-Journal.org.gpg") "\n* %<%I:%M %p> - Journal :journal:\n\n%?\n\n" :clock-in :clock-resume :empty-lines 1))) 
 When I call any of the capture keybindings, it shows a buffer with the capture template and simultaneously prompts in the minibuffer the file selection option with "File to save in:". This has never happened before. 
 I have not modified my capture templates since I set them up an year ago. What is going wrong?

 I study physics and take a fair amount of various notes, but after discovering Org-roam and the Zettelkasten method, I have been thinking that my workflow is very rigid and just sub-par in general. Some of my "strategies" of how I approach note-taking might sound obviously flawed so any hints on that front are very welcome.
 I have been using AUCTeX to write up my notes in LaTeX for some time now. My workflow generally consists of reading various textbooks (and research papers) and creating a LaTeX "project" (a modular document) for each textbook, which sounds kind of awful, I know. But this way I can take notes on said…]]></summary>

 So, I keep a daily logbook[1] where I clock and note down everything that happens throughout the day. If everything could be done in one sitting, that would be fine and my weekly report would write itself. Often, however, TODO items get worked on over a number of days and that breaks things. The fundamental problem is that an Org mode TODO needs to live in one and only one place, whereas the various work sessions comprising that TODO need to appear in several different places.
 The nearest I've come to a solution is to keep the multi-day TODOs in a separate file, and to capture[2] each session note…]]></summary>

 Question: This blog post (https://www.haskellforall.com/2022/05/why-does-haskells-take-function-accept.html) from haskellforall is talking about how the take function can work even when there's not enough elements in the list to select.
 Here's my implementation:
 take' :: Int -> [el] -> [el]
 take' n [] = []
 take' n (x : xs) = x : [v | (k, v) <- zip [1 ..] xs, k <= n - 1]

 This seems pretty lazy and appear to be working correctly. Can anyone explain to me if I am missing anything?

Of course, my first attempt was unsuccessful, since org mode was not able to find the cls file (after using `#+LATEX_CLASS: customcls) , despite having the file in the same directory. After reading the docs and https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/uomvik/org_mode_to_latex_using_a_cls_file/ , I realized that I could just configure org mode to find the cls file by creating a new entry in my emacs config and copying the cls file inside the emacs config dir. 
 But I do not want to pollute my config with this. This is a single time to use this for a single conference. 
 Is it possible to configure the org file to evaluate some lisp code to add the custom cls to the org-latex-class list and set its path? I tried with no success using a * COMMENT section and so on. For now, I am just using latex directly.
 Thanks for any advice.

I wrote a little about it here: True Emacs Transparency. To my knowledge, this originated from a patch by Håkon Flatval in November of last year.
 The old alpha frame parameter, which many of you are aware of, sets the transparency of both the text and background (i.e. the entire frame). This new frame parameter makes just the background of the frame transparent. I haven't seen anything on this subreddit about it, so I thought I'd make a post. Cheers!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What I mean is, is there a better way to write this code without repeating myself ```haskell
 data Colour = White | Black deriving(Enum)
 data ExtraState = ExtraState
 data Game = Game { white :: ExtraState , black :: ExtraState }
 getState :: Game -> Colour -> ExtraState getState g White = white g getState g Black = black g ```
 where each value of Colour has an associated ExtraState in the record. So basically a total map from Colour to ExtraState.
 Sorry, maybe this would be a better one for Stack Overflow :p

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Is there an Org-standard way to control startup visbility on lists (or parts of lists)?
 One can define the #+STARTUP keyword (in the metadata block of a document) or the VISIBILITY property under a heading in order to configure startup visibility.
 As one can cycle trough folded -> children -> subtree states on lists just like one can with headings, I've been hoping that there may be a way to configure startup visibility not just for headings but also for list (or sublists) but can't spot in the docs how to label a particular list node/branch to assume a specific visibility upon startup.
 It seems that subtree is not a valid option for either the #+STARTUP keyword or the VISIBILITY property, so I'm guessing I may be out of luck here.
 Perhaps it doesn't exist but I just wanted to be sure that I'm not just running into a "subpar websearching skills" wall here.

 Currently I add it to emacs startup hook, but I don't think it's the right way to do it, because every time I changed a setting through customize, emacs creates a new block of custom-set-variables instead of changing the one in the add-hook funtion.

 I've been using emacs for months now and I still don't have any external packages installed, primarily because what I do in emacs doesn't demand any external packages. I don't have much going on for me as a programmer or a person to need to install those packages.
 I'm just a high school sophomore that likes working on my own codebases and taking notes with org mode here and there, for my codebases I use rgrep for searching terms, hs-minor-mode for code block visibility, and M-/ for term completion, these are of course all built-in features and I consider them sufficient.
 Even if I did reach a point where I did need to use external extensibility, my first resort wouldn't be using an external package, I'd honestly rather write the extens…]]></summary>

The one thing that gets me is that I'm not clear how to keep the remote IMAP server up to date. I have mu4e-get-mail-command set to "mbsync -a", and I know mu4e-update-interval can be used to run that command every so often, but as I understand it, if I make a change like deleting a message and then quit Emacs before the next update interval, the server won't see that change until I'm running mu4e again. I think what's needed is a way to trigger mbsync after every change, or every batch of changes, rather than after a set time. What's a good way to do this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I quite like org-contacts for use with gnus. One problem I always had was that to use the mail to groups functionality (where everyone with a particular tag, e.g. :family: in my contacts.org file would get added to an email "to" line) I had to disable helm-mode type "+fam" and <tab>, and then, if I remembered, re-enable helm-mode. I didn't have to do this a lot, but it was nice when I needed it. Now with the org-contacts from 6 June 2022 this no longer works. I get an error message because instead of a string of names and emails I am getting a function. For example, #("Father <fatherMadeUpAddress@family.ca>, Mother <motherMadeUpAddress@family.ca" 0 9 (face org-level-1 fontified t) 31 48 (face org-level-1 fontified t)) 
 The names and addresses are in there if I could just get them out of that function. I think there is a message-tab-function I could use. Any suggestions from people who have already solved this issue, or would like to give me suggestions for how I might try? If people want to lobby for alternatives to org-contacts I am open to suggestions. Thanks.

I am a german actuary in his early forties with a doctorate in (pure) mathematics.
I like to read and think about what I read. I want to learn the Zettelkasten Method to help me with that, to curate lines of thought in my (many) areas of interest, make new connections, and see what comes up over time. If something worthwhile does come up, I would also like to dabble a bit in non-fiction writing.
My start-up setting for the Zettelkasten:
Fleeting Notes are handwritten (either in my notebook or blank slips of paper that double as bookmarks).
Zotero as a reference system and storage for finalized proper literature notes.
Obsidian as a Zettelkasten (but still using the 'Folgezettel'-system).
In addition, I mark the number of the permanent notes in my Zettelkasten each day, together with the hours I worked with the Zettelkaste Method (aiming for at least three).
Looking forward to learning from/with you!]]></summary>

How do I move back and forth between A and B, and not messing up the layout? Projectile as I said, works fine but then I need to resplit the windows to my taste.
 I have tried "desktop.el". So you save to a .desktop file, but the downsides are: you need to remember to change to the "desktop-dir" to have the layouts loaded, and it doesnt keep the positions in a PDF file.

Continuing to focus on my reading and the "Depth of Processing" of my notes using "Elaborative Interrogation and Self-explanation."
I'm working to make sense of two diverse ideas.
The Science of Setting & Achieving Goals - Huberman Lab
I'm onboarding ideas from Four thousand weeks: time management for mortals by Burkeman, Oliver, 2021. This book is brim-full of ideas about finitude and its relationship to wonderment.


Reading Longitude: the true story of a lone genius who solved the most significant scientific problem of his time by Sobel, Dava, and Armstrong, Neil, 2007. A gripping story of the discovery and development of the tool that leads to safe ocean navigation. Interesting to see Issac Newton's role in this when he was 80 years old.

Reading The Eighty-Five Percent Rule for optimal learning by Robert C. Wilson, Amitai Shenhav, Mark Straccia & Jonathan D. Cohen as an in-depth followup to The Science of Setting & Achieving Goals
Trivia.
These are the titles of a few recent notes I'm excited about.

 I am using doom emacs with lsp and pyright for my python projects and everything works quite well. Yesterday however, I noticed that when lsp started with pyright without any internet connection, pyright would simply refuse to start. When checking the pyright::stderr buffer, I got the following : 
 npm ERR! code EAI_AGAIN npm ERR! errno EAI_AGAIN npm ERR! request to https://registry.npmjs.org/pyright failed, reason: getaddrinfo EAI_AGAIN registry.npmjs.org npm ERR! A complete log of this run can be found in: npm ERR! /home/gautier/.npm/_logs/2022-06-05T09_55_34_647Z-debug.log Traceback (most recent call last): File "/home/gautier/.pyenv/versions/venv/bin/pyright-langserver", line 8, in <module> sys.exit(entrypoint()) File "/home/gautier/.pyenv/versions/venv/lib64/python3.9/site-packages/pyright/langserver.py", line 57, in entrypoint sys.exit(main(*sys.argv[1:])) File "/home/gautier/.pyenv/versions/venv/lib64/python3.9/site-packages/pyright/langserver.py", line 26, in main return run(*args, **kwargs).returncode File "/home/gautier/.pyenv/versions/venv/lib64/python3.9/site-packages/pyright/langserver.py", line 37, in run version = node.latest('pyright') File "/home/gautier/.pyenv/versions/venv/lib64/python3.9/site-packages/pyright/node.py", line 145, in latest raise errors.VersionCheckFailed( pyright.errors.VersionCheckFailed: Version check for pyright failed, see output above. Process pyright stderr finished npm ERR! code EAI_AGAIN npm ERR! errno EAI_AGAIN npm ERR! request to https://registry.npmjs.org/pyright failed, reason: getaddrinfo EAI_AGAIN registry.npmjs.org 
 From what I understand, npm is trying to check the version of pyright but since I don't have an internet connection, it simply fails. Is there a way to skip this verification step and start pyright anyway ? 
 I must admit that I still don't fully understand how lsp works so there might be something simple that I'm missing here. 
 Thanks in advance =)

 org-superstar-mode installed easily because I can enable it when I'm in an org file. What syntax would I add to my init file to start org-superstar-mode on every new file?
 I thought it would be something like:
 ~~~ (require 'org-superstar) (add-hook 'org-mode-hook (lambda () (org-superstar-mode 1))) ~~~
 I feel so stupid for not being able to figure this out, but I know I'm missing something super obvious here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am using a custom function meant to take an entry in a .org document, and put it into a node, either a new one, or one that already existed. Org-roam-refile does not work if the node you want to put the text in doesn't already exist, and org-roam-extract-subtree doesn't work if you want to put the text into a pre-existing node. 
 Heavily inspired by system-crafters, what I settled on doing was initiating the org-roam-capture process to guarantee that there's a node, then using org-refile to move the entry to the target document. It looks roughly like this. 
 (defun my/org-roam-gtd-reference () (interactive) (let ( (org-refile-keep nil) ;; Set this to nil to delete the original! (org-roam-capture-templates '(("k" "knowledge" plain "%?" :if-new (file+head+olp "pages/${slug}.org" "#+title: ${title}\n" ("Knowledge"))))) (org-after-refile-insert-hook #'save-buffer) nodefile position ) (save-window-excursion (org-roam-capture "k") (setq nodefile (buffer-file-name)) (setq position (point))) (org-refile nil nil (list "Knowledge" nodefile nil position))) (org-gtd-process-inbox)) 
 The problem in this function seems to be in the 
  (save-window-excursion (org-roam-capture "k") (setq nodefile (buffer-file-name)) (setq position (point))) 
 I cannot for the life of me figure this out. But buffer-file-name is returning nil, which causes nodefile to be defined as nil, which causes the eventual org-refile command to fail. Strangely, this block works fine if it uses the org-roam-dailies-capture-today command instead of org-roam-capture. Unfortunately, that wouldn't fit my workflow, since it would capture to dailies instead of the actual nodes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to achieve something like track-eol:
  
When line-move-visual is nil, you can also set the variable track-eol to a non-nil value. Then C-n and C-p, when starting at the end of the logical line, move to the end of the next logical line. Normally, track-eol is nil.
  
but with two differences:
  
it should be activated after a C-e (easy, just advise move-end-of-line), and automatically disabled after any horizontal motion (I could advise every horizontal movement command, but is there a better way?). Essentially, if I move to the end of line with C-f I don't want track-eol-like behaviour.
 
it should work with line-move-visual set, which probably means using goal-column. I tried setting temporary-goal-column after C-e, but it gets ignored if the last command isn't one of an handful (move-end-of-line not included). This is unfortunate since I think temporary-goal-column has pretty much the behaviour I want.
 
 How would you do this?
 EDIT: I ended up with this
 (defvar ad/sticky-eol-active nil) (defun ad/sticky-eol () (if (and ad/sticky-eol-active (memq this-command '(previous-line next-line boon-repeat-command))) (end-of-line) (setq ad/sticky-eol-active (eq this-command 'end-of-line)))) (add-hook 'post-command-hook #'ad/sticky-eol)

 I'm using org-cite with the CSL backend to export to LaTeX to HTML, it works well. The only thing is, I'd like the bibliography name in the export to depend on the language.
 In pure LaTeX, you can just use \printbibliography[title={MyTitle}] and on export, the name of the
 section will be 
 MyTitle
 <bibliography here> 
 But if you don't add any title argument, it'll be smart enough to call it References in English and Bibliographie in French for example. 
 Can I do something similar with the CSL backend? Thanks.

 Check out the experimental feature, if you have it installed.
 The question "Why it is created in Haskell" is asked more and more often :)
 Haskell is an exceptional language that made this project very effective and helped us move really fast, so I hope some day SimpleX might help Haskell popularity too!
 Thank you all for your support 🙏

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A few years ago I discovered Rust and I wanted to learn it. But I struggled until I learned that Rust is highly influenced by functional programing languages.
 I became curious about FP, but I struggled again. This time I struggled to find a good language. My first choice was Elm, but it is limited to the browser and needs things like nodejs and maybe even interop with JavaScript (I don't like JS).
 Another option was F#, but the compiler is horribly slow (I explain it in a moment).
 Also an option was Gleam, but this lacks good documentation and I wasn't able to install the compiler.
 I decided to reactivate my old Samsung N150 Netbook from 2010 and installed Endeavour OS (based on Arch Linux) with i3 as window manager. I like to minimize myself sometimes and nothing is better to use a computer that isn't able to play YouTube videos. Using a browser is possible, but not fun. This is one of the reasons I don't choose Elm.
 I also installed the .NET Toolchain, but the compiler is horribly slow on the N150 and the editor of choice, helix, has no support for F#, so I decided to ditch this too.
 Other languages on my list are Python and Julia, but they are not really helpful to learn FP.
 Finally I tried Haskell. Helix has good support, the LSP works well and the Compiler has an acceptable oerformance. Haskell is a general purpose language, pure functional, well documented and mature. Also I have a few ebooks about Haskell I can read on the N150 without the need for a browser. I don't even need internet connection, except I need to install something.
 So this is it, a short story of a long journey. Finally I'm going to learn Haskell. Or is it?
 No, maybe I come back to Elm and F# later, but now I will focus on THE pure functional language, Haskell.

 Now I was aware that many out there use use-package for configuration, but I always postponed using it. Meanwhile my init.el file has over 5000 lines, and it seems like an unsurmountable mountain to rewrite it using use-package. 
 The biggest chellange for me is: I have custom functions and configs spread all over my init.el file. How do I know which of those settings belong together into one use-package sexpr?
 Is there a good intro / article that shows me how to tackle this task? Anyone can point me to some articles / threads?

 I’m completely unfamiliar to setting up environments or configurations (aside from copy pasting templates from friends). Looking for help. I have used vim before and I really love the keyboard macros (since I’ll be doing a bit of metaprogramming, and in-line assembly too in Julia, such features will be very handy).
 (Why don’t I want to use another OS? Handwritten Note taking using stylus is a big part of my workflow and I’ve found windows machines to work best for it. Not a simple task to install BSD or Linux on surface devices. Also quite a lot of windows exclusive software for my use case)
 Also, is it possible to have eMacs display the custom variable names (like smileys, and latex symbols) available in Julia?
 I’m currently using this tutorial but even that is quite inconsistent : https://youtu.be/Iagbv974GlQ (the first step at 3.49 throws a warning on my pc, stating unnecessary call to package initialize at unit. Also at 3.35, how did he clear off the entire text quickly?)
 Apart from using for Coding for Julia programs, I am also curious about learning org mode in eMacs. (I do make slides every week and I feel that org mode will help me make it more streamlined)

 I've always thought that it actually means "side effect" (IO), but apparently people call all sorts of things "effectful", including simple wrappers like Maybe and Either.
 This leads me to a couple of questions:
  
Is this use of the words "effect" and "effectful" correct? Do they simply mean "a wrapper type", or is it more specific than that?
 What are the origins of it being used this way?

 Caps + a even requires you to totally change hand position from the home row.
 The most common C-c, C-v we use in other programs become messy with using Caps.
 I personally bound my right alt to caps which I use most often. When I have to control plus keys on right hand side, I press left control with edge of my palm. This is also not that good but seems better than Caps lock.
 Dunno why the control keys are placed so badly on keyboards when they are the ones used to make keyboard shortcuts for almost every program.

 Are there options for searching this way? Can Emacs filter the duplicates in its own way or pipe the results through uniq or some other utility to avoid the duplicates?

 It appears the debugger works once, and then can never be shut off even after running geben-end as indicated in this github issue. I am able to stop my code once, but I don't see any indicators in emacs itself that a breakpoint was actually hit. I just know the code is stalled where I had set the breakpoint. If I try running the code again, I get a "connection refused, already debugging" which shouldn't be happening after running geben-end
 ​
 Has anyone actually gotten this working?

 I'm fairly new to emacs and orgmode but I love them both. I've installed emacs on a Mac OS.

 Is there a way, when I open an org file not to see the *GNU Emacs* startup page?

 The runtime has been completely replaced with an implementation based on Cats Effect 3 and fs2. The main user benefit of this is that the effect types behave more in the way you'd expect. The previous implementation (Task) worked perfectly well, but hadn't kept up with developments in modern effect types.
 Tyrian is still following what I think of as the 'friendly-FP' approach you get with the Elm architecture. I promise that you do not need to be a Cats / Cats Effect guru to use this. 😅

 All I will be giving up or 4 or 5 vim insert mode keys that I can easily find alternatives for as I have the entire power of emacs editing at hand now in insert mode. 
 One annoyance though is giving up C-r for pasting from registers. I have to learn how to use emacs based registers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi Haskellers,
 I'm John, a 28 year old man on disability for mental illness and cognitive issues likely caused by said mental illness. I have almost two years of work experience as a backend programmer for Amazon working on Java code, but I was pretty bad at it. I was never able to learn that codebase that I worked on (for every task I needed to ask a more experienced engineer to point me to where in the codebase the particular code change needed to be made). I'm hoping that I will have a little bit of an easier time learning a Haskell codebase once I master the programming language (but I will definitely need to set up and use a debugger to learn said codebase because just reading code without running it line-by-line doesn't do anything for me). Haskell isn't too difficult for me because I programmed in Scala in my spare time for a couple years, so I'm familiar with the basic functional programming concepts like Monads and such. Sometimes I get confused when people go too deep into category theory and functional programming (like I don't know what is a Kleisli or a Bimonad). My biggest hurdle is just getting to the point where I am independent and useful, so I could use a mentor. Please comment or message me if you know of a codebase I should work on and would be willing to mentor me.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been using org-gcal for a couple of years with few if any problems. I believe I set it up using OAuth authorization, with a token. 
 It looks like OAuth support is being deprecated by Google -- see this email I got from a month ago:
  
We are writing to inform you that OAuth out-of-band (OOB) flow will be deprecated on October 3, 2022, to protect users from phishing and app impersonation attacks.
 What do I need to know?
 Starting October 3, 2022, we will block OOB requests to Google's OAuth 2.0 authorization endpoint for existing clients. Apps using OOB in testing mode will not be affected. However, we strongly recommend you to migrate them to safer methods as these apps will be immediately blocked when switching to in production status.
 Note: New OOB usage has already been disallowed since February 28, 2022. 
 Below are key dates for compliance
 September 5, 2022: A user-facing warning message may be displayed to
 non-compliant OAuth requests October 3, 2022: The OOB flow is blocked for all clients and users will see
 the error page.
  
In fact, I've been getting an error saying OAuth token expired. Now trying to refresh-token. Received HTTP 401 for a couple of months now, so this tracks.
 Is there anything to be done at this point? org-gcal still works for me at the moment, but I'm guessing it won't come October. The maintainer's github page (at least that's who I think is the maintainer) doesn't mention this issue at the moment though.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So this summer I'll be working as part of a Tweag fellowship (https://www.tweag.io/blog/2020-02-14-os-fellowship/) on extending the Bayesian inference and probabilistic programming library monad-bayes (https://github.com/tweag/monad-bayes). It's a super nice library, and my goal is to make it much more user friendly (see these draft docs for example: https://monad-bayes.netlify.app/).
 One thing that would help is if people have statistical problems (or problems involving probability and inference in general) that they would like to see implemented in Haskell, they could mention them either here or in the issues (https://github.com/tweag/monad-bayes/issues) and I'll try to implement them in monad-bayes (or advise on how to do it). That would help me work out what the pain points are in using monad-bayes for "real-world" problems.
 In fact, any suggestions on things you'd like to see in the library are welcome :)

 ```scala final case class User(name: String, email: String)
 object User: // everything below is a boilerplate opaque type Id = String
 object Id: given Encoder[Id] = deriveEncoder[Id]
 final case class WithId(id: Id, origin: User)
 object WithId: given Encoder[WithId] = deriveEncoder[WithId] ```
 What I'd like to write is:
 ```scala final case class User(name: String, email: String)
 object User: generateBoilerplate[User] ```
 And have generateBoilerplate generating all the entities.
 I think it should be possible with new macros, but I've never worked with them in Scala 2 and don't even know where to start. Does anyone have any examples or tips on where I should start exploring it?
 I tried to write something, but got stuck when realised that all examples I've show how to create a value, e.g.:
 scala val someValue = generateBoilerplate[User] 
 But don't see anything that would just "unwrap" traits/objects/values within some scope.

 key sequence contains no complete binding.
 this is what i'm using:
 (define-key evil-normal-state-map (kbd "a") 'evil-change)
 i've also tried putting this inside use-package after :config, using :bind in use-package and removing the kbd macro, but nothing works and i get the same error.
 i've even tried changing the evil-maps.el file.
 i have been able to bind other key sequences to evil-change and i've also been able to bind 'a' to other commands but not evil-change.
 this however does work:
 (define-key evil-visual-state-map (kbd "a") 'evil-change)
 any ideas?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I'm wondering about two unrelated things. I'm not very close to Scala since the split between 2 and 3, so I'm sorry if those are some standard questions that everyone asks, but I wasn't able to find any meaningful answers for them.
  
Are there any plans for introducing nullable types in Scala3? I mean e.g.
  
 val s: String = null 
 This should not compile (with Nullable Types). I saw some forks of dotty that introduce this feature, but is there some kind of official statement of the devs about it? I'm sure someone has already talked about this stuff, as it's very popular today.
  
As for Scala3 syntax, I know that when it has been introduced the blog posts were stating that nobody will force the new syntax on anyone. Has this changed? Some time has passed after introducing the new syntax, is it possible to state which one is more popular today for Scala3 code? Will "old" syntax be deprecated one day?
  
Thanks for any answers.

 I found myself needing/having to use windows (not very happy about it).
 I have parsed this Reddit, the google, the stack... and haven't found a solution to my 2 issues.
  
I cannot edit/add commit messages:
 1 git.exe … "commit" "--"
 Aborting commit due to empty commit message.
 sh -c 'printf /nWITH-EDITOR:: $$: No such file or directory
 
I can neither pull nor push to my repo using ssh
 128 git.exe … push -v gitlab refs/heads/main:refs/heads/main
 Pushing to gitlab.com:aimebertrand/dotemacs.git
 fatal: Could not read from remote repository.
 Please make sure you have the correct access rights and the repository exists.
 
 I understand that this is going on almost nothing, when meta info is concerned, so here there are:
  
Shell
 (customize-set-variable 'shell-file-name "C:/Windows/system32/bash.exe")
 (customize-set-variable 'sh-shell-file "C:/Windows/system32/bash.exe")
 (setenv "ESHELL" "bash")
 
I got git-bash installed and have my ssh-keypair in my user directory and for good mesures also in .ssh directory inside of my default-directory
 
 I am quite ambitious, but some intricacies go over my head aspecially when it comes to windows.
 Hope someone can point me in the right direction. Maybe with their own config or so.
 I do apologize if this question is not the best formed. But maybe with some of your input I can add needed Info.

Stack is one of the two popular build tools for Haskell projects.
It takes care of setting up a build environment by providing the GHC compiler and works hand-in-hand with Stackage snapshots: a specific version of GHC paired with a subset of packages from Hackage, where each package’s version was chosen to make the set self-consistent, relieving developers of the need of finding compatible Haskell package versions.

Not so long ago, I found the book "Taking Smart Notes with DevonThink" on the website of Kourosh Dini. I haven't been able to explore it completely because I'm currently processing Effective Notetaking. However, I have started to use daily DevonThink to take notes of the PDFs I read for my dissertation, and I love how you can create links even to a particular section of a PDF inside your note.
I will definitely read the book in a couple of months because I am already connecting my notes with PDFs and other notes in my database.
What I also like, and this isn't related to the book, is that I have finally settled in my search for a tool to keep my notes, research, sources and moreover make my zettelkasten.
So, if you already have DevonThink you might want to check it out, as I said, I haven't read it, but I have started to connect my thoughts from the sources I extract the information, and also to other notes. The iconography of the software is really helpful to know where the connections are going.
Cheers!]]></summary>

 This is definitely a rookie question - but I use hs-minor-mode for folding and my preference is to auto-fold by default when visiting a file so I've got this in my init.el
  (add-hook 'prog-mode-hook (lambda () (hs-minor-mode) (hs-hide-all))) 
 Worked fine - open a file and everything folds.
 I'm switching from lsp-mode to eglot and when use eglot-format or go-mode to format the buffer instead of lsp-format-buffer it seems to re-trigger this hook and fold everything down for me. This didn't happen with lsp-format-buffer
 Is prog-mode-hook not the best place to do this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I find myself wanting this, and wonder if I'm the only one.
 I'm often writing functions that do repeated pattern matches on some relatively unique nesting of structures, and it doesn't feel like the pattern synonyms for this belong at the top-level, where they'd just be confusing.
 There's probably some technical reason that ghc needs them at the top level, and I assume it would be huge hassle to support them within other bindings, but if it was a simple thing... well, maybe I should make a PR to ghc!

 import UnliftIO.Async main = concurrently_ (putStrLn "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa") (putStrLn "bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb") 
 When running with stack runghc Example.hs, it will interleave the characters (as I expected), but with stack ghc Example.hs && ./Example, it doesn't interleave. What causes this difference? Out of curiosity, is there some flag I can pass to runghc/ghc to make it act like the other? More importantly, am I guaranteed that putStrLn (or more specifically, Data.Text.IO.putStr, where the argument is guaranteed to end with a newline) will not interleave in a compiled program?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello. Recently, I updated my GNU emacs from v26.3 to v27.2. Now, ispell does not work anymore under Windows 10 (on my Macs, it still works). On my Windows machine, I use hunspell, which has been the same v1.7.0. I am wondering what should be changed in my setup ~/.emacs.d/init.el for the ispell in v27.2 to work. Just as an experiment, if I replace /usr/share/emacs/27.2/lisp/textmodes/ispell.[el,elc] by those of 26.3, the ispell system works under v27.2. That means that some setting in the new ispell.el has changed. My current setup in ~/.emacs.d/init.el is the following, which I copied from the posting Tutorial: spellchecking with hunspell (1.7.0) for emacs (26.2) on Windows (10) : emacs (reddit.com)
 (autoload 'ispell-message "ispell" "Check spelling of mail message or news post.") (setq ispell-program-name "hunspell") (setq ispell-library-directory "C:/ProgramData/dict-en") (setq ispell-hunspell-dict-paths-alist '(("en_US" "C:/ProgramData/dict-en/en_US.aff"))) (setq ispell-local-dictionary "en_US") (setq ispell-local-dictionary-alist ;; Please note the list `("-d" "en_US")` contains ACTUAL parameters passed to hunspell ;; You could use `("-d" "en_US,en_US-med")` to check with multiple dictionaries '(("en_US" "[[:alpha:]]" "[^[:alpha:]]" "[']" nil ("-d" "en_US") nil utf-8))) ;; the following line won't make flyspell-mode enabled by default as you might think (setq ispell-personal-dictionary "C:/Users/me/.hunspell_en_US") (flyspell-mode 1) ;; ispell-word for showing correcting options of the current misspelled word ;(global-set-key (kbd "M-\\") 'ispell-word 
 If I use the ispell.el of v27.2, I got the error message: ispell: Can’t find Hunspell dictionary with a .aff affix file
 Thanks a lot for your help!

I am currently evaluating The Archive after years of managing all my notes in a folder full of markdown files which I editu using BBEdit. After just a little light search and replace in that fine app, I was able to get all my notes into The Archive with some hashtags already applied, etc.
I like the simplicity and responsiveness of this app, but right now I have one UI issue about how the Omnibar works. In the screen grab below, I entered the word "Vacation" into the Omnibar, and as you can see I got five hits, and I have selected the second one.

My issue in this screen shot is that it is impossible to tell what the original search term was, as the Omnibar is filled in with the name of the note. I think it would be clearer if the omnibar still read "vacation," although that goes against the grain of the Notational Velocity way I guess... not that I remember how any other NV type app has solved this issue.
What do you think? Should I just get used to it?]]></summary>

 git clone git://git.sv.gnu.org/emacs.git sudo apt install build-essential libgtk-3-dev libgnutls28-dev libtiff5-dev libgif-dev libjpeg-dev libpng-dev libxpm-dev libncurses-dev texinfo cd emacs ./autogen.sh ./configure --with-pgtk make -j8 
 Before I do sudo make install I need to get rid of the Debian packages that get replaced.
 sudo dpkg --get-selections| grep -i emacs returns:
 emacs emacs-bin-common emacs-common emacs-el emacs-gtk emacsen-common 
 The first one is obvious: I need to do sudo apt remove emacs before the install commmand of my own version. But what about the rest? They also come with further dependencies such as libgit2-28 libhttp-parser2.9 libm17n-0 libotf0 m17n-db and even more on a different machine.
 What packages can be removed and what should (may) I keep?
 Is the self-compiled Emacs 100 percent self-contained so that I never need any additional library or package from my GNU/Linux distribution?
 Thanks!

 Today I got an email I can't render, it gives the following error when I open the email and displays only the raw data:
 error in process filter: shr-tag-a: Args out of range: 15966, 15967 error in process filter: Args out of range: 15966, 15967 
 It's not spam, it's an email from a known contact that I get regularly. Just wondering if anyone's seen anything like this or knows a solution.

I'm starting a new job, and I have to learn some new software. I want to put what I learn into my Archive.
I don't know why, but it feels awkward to me to go through the software's documentation and start writing notes about the different features. Intuitively it seems at odds with ZKM. But, I'm don't think it actually is.
But, is that how you'd do it also?
Start with a structure note, and start to branch off into these different features within the software, writing notes about the different features?
Thanks for you thoughts in advance!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I wrote commify several years ago, but have never done anything to announce it. Just did some minor tweaking, so I thought I would let reddit-ers know.
 It's a pretty simple package, but I use it all the time. It inserts grouping commas into a number near the cursor, or all numbers in a region. If invoked on a number that already has grouping commas, it removes them. So, it toggles the commas on and off. It tries to avoid things that you don't want commas on, such as dates, or numbers with leading, or identifiers. It can also work with hex, octal, and binary numbers, each with their own grouping character, normally, '_'.
 I have it bound to the keychord ',,' which makes it easy to invoke and remember.
 It's on MELPA, so give it a try.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I like to use different frames for different projectile contexts. To easily know which frame corresponds to which project, I changed the frame title as follows: "[project-name] current-buffer-name" by customizing the variable frame-title-format and setting frame-parameter (see https://gist.github.com/jackjackk/22fba0486c7ebc0a673cc3fb30fe2d24). After some recent Emacs update (or perhaps of my linux windows manager?), now when the frame title changes after a tab switch between frames, all frames get the same project name in the title (see for example https://snipboard.io/qLHIZW.jpg). Some months ago each frame retained the last assigned project name in the frame title. Any suggestions on what could have changed and how should I adjust my code? Thanks a lot!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I wonder how to make opening a tab in tab-line in the background robust.
 I figured out a way to make it work by caching the selected tab index. But I cannot make heads nor tails of the tab structs used in tab-line; there seems to be no unique ID per tab that would help to re-select a tab, just the tab struct itself?
 Anyway, here's a macro to "save tab excursion" when e.g. visiting a file. It only works with tabs opening to the right, so that's a limitation and possibly breaks expectations.
 (defmacro infu/save-tab-excursion (&rest body) "Opens a new tab in tab-line in the background and executes BODY inside, then restores the previously selected tab." `(let ((current-tab-index (tab-bar--current-tab-index))) (tab-bar-new-tab 1) ;; +1 = Create to the right so our cached index works. (unwind-protect (progn ,@body)) ;; For some reason tab indexes are 0-based but tab numbers are 1-based (tab-bar-select-tab (+ 1 current-tab-index)))) (infu/save-tab-excursion (find-file "test.txt")) 
 Ideas to make this better would be much appreciated!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This video demonstrates navigating ideas using a structure note as a reference traversing the structure without becoming lost.
Mousing around, clicking incessantly on links, constantly losing focus, and backtracking is so painful.
A structure note is far more than a list of other notes. It places ideas in a connecting context. The value of structure is enhanced with writing. Surround the ideas with context. A structure note is not atomic, growing, and growing as idea momentum grows.
In this short video, I demonstrate a "Two Window Workflow" with the structure note on the right. I click on the links in the structure note and the target note launch in the second window. I don't lose context as the structure note remains in view. I can review and refactor either note.
Notice that the structure note includes Grouped links and many of those links are annotated. The annotations are for context, which helps steer connectivity.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Over the years there's been several attempts to build systems providing templates for new Haskell projects: Stack has had templates for a long time, but as far as I can tell/remember, they're in a state of flux or were being deprecated in favour of something new; summoner(-tui) is excellent but doesn't seem to have been updated for a while and baulks at asking it to use newer GHCs. These are the only projects I've used, I'm probably missing many others.
 So what are the options these days? I don't tend to use stack any more as Cabal seems to offer most of the advantages it used to provide exclusively, and is more compatible.
 Off the top of my head, features I'd like to see are: either a way to add in "features" (choose a database library, web server/API library, custom prelude, etc.), or a rich ecosystem of common combinations of libraries, much like Stack does/used to.

 I love the language and it's expressivity, and I'm very glad i could learn it because it has taught me many things, some of which i don't know i would have had the chance to learn without the language and it's community.
 However it seems to me that the only way to get a scala job is to be first a senior developer, and i am far from one.
 So the only way i see this playing out is having to use Java for the next five years somewhere that uses Scala libraries, and then switch over.
 Is there really no other way? Why are there no Junior scala jobs?

 I have been using emacs for a while and only a couple of features from the jetbrains editor I miss: the Conflict Resolution tool, and the execution configurations. 
 These execution configurations usually specify which file to execute, with which virtual env, set environment variables and things like those. 
 I have tried to see if lsp mode or python mode offer something like that but it does not look like it, so I spent some time building some functions to achieve similar functionality making the assumption you use pyvenv:
 https://gist.github.com/andcarnivorous/9a9fad7a267cba8f7840f338ad76cbf5
 Still don't know if this is worth packaging on MELPA, but it sure has made my workflow more efficient. 
 If you know of any alternative already present in a major package please let me know :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm modelling a particular domain which has entities which can relate to each other:
 haskell type EID = Integer data Entity = Distribution EID | Organisation EID | Site EID 
 This is how I'd initially consider declaring them as a data type. There are some hierarchical relationships I can declare:
  
a distribution can own an organisation
 an organisation can own a site
 an organisation can own a distribution
  
(Sidenote: I don't want cycles in this graph, so an organisation cannot be a member of a distribution it owns. More strongly than that, in fact, organisations which own a distribution cannot be members of another distribution at all.)
 One way I could think of modelling these relations is with a simple function definition:
 haskell isMemberOf :: Entity -> Entity -> IO Bool isMemberOf (Distribution a) (Distribution b) = return False isMemberOf (Distribution a) (Organisation b) = -- do some lookup isMemberOf (Distribution a) (Site b) = return False isMemberOf (Organisation a) (Distribution b) = -- do some lookup isMemberOf (Organisation a) (Organisation b) = return False isMemberOf (Organisation a) (Site b) = return False isMemberOf (Site a) (Distribution b) = return False isMemberOf (Site a) (Organisation b) = -- do some lookup isMemberOf (Site a) (Site b) = return False 
 This could be made more concise, but I'm being very explicit for the sake of clarity.
 The problem with this approach is that it doesn't tell you what the possible relations are at type level and therefore at compile time. Instead, you'll find out you made a mistake when asking 
 (a :: Site) `isMemberOf` (b :: Site) 
 at runtime, because you'll get False (wrapped in IO).
 Is there a nicer way to model this sort of graph of related entities which have specific rules about what types of entities are allowed to relate and how?

It seems like the compilation buffer is not being updated until after the compilation is finished. Is there way for me to update the compilation buffer whilst it is still doing the compilation?

 Now counsel-fzf uses find-file in counsel-fzf-action to open a file in the currently open window, but I'd rather use find-file-other-window. - Here's the code snippet from counsel.el:
 (defun counsel-fzf-action (x) "Find file X in current fzf directory." (with-ivy-window (let ((default-directory counsel--fzf-dir)) (find-file x)))) 
 As you can see, it calls find-file. So how can I tell it to use find-file-other-window? - Now I could use an advice to overwrite this, but I am thinking that counsel has other mechanisms to accomplish this.
 I am thinking that ivy-set-actions should be able to accomplish what I want. Here is an example I came across:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've seen a lot of posts about people not being able to use Emacs at work because of security concerns raised by their security team. I was in similar yet different situation where I was able to use packages from the a local repo mirror and I was not allowed to install any external ones. That made me think about how I would setup and use Emacs in those environments. I separated out my config (which is a literate org file) into Vanilla Emacs Configs and External Configs. When ever I'm the afore-mentioned environments I started to comment out the ```External Configs``` heading. I've also been hacking on the vanilla configs and I was pleasantly surprised. I miss certain things like hydra, magit, yasnippet and avy but I was surprised by how far I could go with Emacs's built in functions and my Spaghettified lisp config. So I'm asking about your experiences in using vanilla emacs. If you have any tips and tricks or some forgotten built in packages I should give a try and so on.

 I need your help. I'd like to have an overview of all todo's I need to go through by the end of the week using org-super-agenda.
 I saw there is an example in the documentation that I think could be modified to provide what I need:
 (-let* (((sec minute hour day month year dow dst utcoff) (decode-time)) (last-day-of-month (calendar-last-day-of-month month year)) (target-date ;; A hack that seems to work fine. Yay, Postel! (format "%d-%02d-%02d" year month (1+ last-day-of-month))) (org-super-agenda-groups `((:deadline (before ,target-date)) (:discard (:anything t))))) (org-todo-list)) 
 As a non-programmer I don't know where to integrate such a piece of code within my current setup. This is one of my super agenda current custom commands:
 ("c" "My Workday" ((todo "" ((org-agenda-overriding-header "Overview") (org-super-agenda-groups '((:log t) (:name "NEXT ___" :todo "NEXT" :face (:background "chocolate3") :order 1) (:name "Due Today ___" :deadline today :order 2) ;(:name "Due this week ___" TODO!!! ; :deadline ???? ; :order 3) (:name "Ongoing ___" :scheduled t :order 4) (:name "Overdue ___" :deadline past :order 5) (:name "Tasks with Due Dates ___" :deadline future :order 6) (:name "Tasks without Due Dates ___" :deadline nil :order 7) (:discard (:anything t)))))))) 
 Thanks for your inputs!

 Is it possible to add an option, either to the whole html backend or just to a project, to automatically add a bibliography section at the bottom of each html file, without having to do what I've described above ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I got to know that emacs now has a global mode line from here https://amodernist.com/texts/emacs-global.html
 The post above shows how to enable global mode line, and hints that it can be used together with tabs as well. After checking the docstring, it appears to be quite easy:
 ​
 (add-to-list 'tab-bar-format 'tab-bar-format-align-right t)
 (add-to-list 'tab-bar-format 'tab-bar-format-global t)
 (tab-bar-mode t)
 ​
 By default, battery info , date time (if enabled) and org clocking info will appear on the right side of tab bar, which is pretty cool.
 Hope someone might find this useful.

 Full release notes: https://github.com/fourmolu/fourmolu/releases/tag/v0.7.0.0
 Exciting new, long awaited changes:
  
Merged changes from Ormolu 0.5.0.0. Includes a new fixities configuration option for defining custom fixities
 A new --quiet flag
 Removes --cabal-default-extensions flag, enabled by default
 Development improvements, including adding a test framework for fourmolu-specific options and making a single source of truth for parsing cli flags and config options. This will allow us to finally start merging in PRs that have not had any activity in a while.
 Exercised the new release workflow (see previous Reddit post)
  
Many thanks to all contributors who helped make this happen!

 "Could not find module ‘System.Random’ It is not a module in the current program, or in any known package.", 
 I set the the Ghcup Executable Path value in VS Code to ~/.ghcup/bin/ghcup and the packages appear to be ~/.cabal/packages/hackage.haskell.org. When I try to compile it normally with GHC, it works fine. HLS works fine in VS Code with any package that is part Prelude. Is there any way to make the cabal path visible to VS Code? Any help is appreciated, thanks in advance.

I'd also like to start studying Artificial Intelligence, and so comes my question: can I learn AI and Machine Learning using Haskell? I've read articles that say Haskell is a great choice, nevertheless, I can't find info related to Haskell and AI. Some other people say that Python is a great choice, some others say neither of them are a good option for AI. So, what do you think would be a good PL so that I can learn to create AI algorithms? Keep in mind I've been studying programming for 2 years, and so far I know C & C++, Assembly, and Haskell, so I'm not an advanced programmer yet!

It also uses Emacs's new completion affixation and grouping functions, so it works well with packages like Vertico and Embark.

 Here's what it looks like in practice: screenshot
 It will be available on MELPA as soon as it rebuilds the org-ql package (or you can install it yourself with Quelpa, Straight, etc).

Presently, notes (zettels) are ordered by filename (or by using "Structure Zettels"). The file-naming convention may be random or allow notes to be listed in a specific order.
Suppose a structure is needed in a randomly arranged zettelkasten, or a different structure is needed in a structured zettelkasten. In that case, this is made possible by creating a "Structure Zettel": a separate note used solely to order or structure other notes.
What if structure notes could be eliminated and notes could be arranged in many different ways depending on multiple contexts? This is where structure-tags come in.
A structure-tag is, in effect, an alternative filename. Notes are ordered (structured) according to that particular context when searching usin…]]></summary>

 {-# LANGUAGE PatternSynonyms #-} module MyModule (Range, pattern Range) where data Range = MkRange Int Int pattern Range a b <- MkRange a b where Range a b = MkRange (min a b) (max a b) 
 This seems to work, but I get an exhaustiveness warning if I try to use it:
 import MyModule(Range, pattern Range) useRange :: Range -> Int useRange (Range a b) = ... Warning: Pattern match(es) are non-exhaustive 
 Is there a better way to do this which doesn't produce a false positive for exhaustiveness checks?
 Thanks!

 Is there a method for multiple pattern matching on constructors? e.g. in my project i would like to run the same code for all these patterns:
 instance TexAble BelStruct where tex | (BlS mgr props lawbdd obdds) | (BlSZ mgr props lawbdd obdds) | (BlSZf0 mgr props lawbdd obdds) | (BlSZs0 mgr props lawbdd obdds) | (BlSZf0s0 mgr props lawbdd obdds) = concat --...etc 
 Because i am matching on constructors, i cannot bundle them together in the usual way:
 tex (x mgr props lawbdd obdds) | x `elem` [BlS, BlSZ, BlSZf0, BlSZs0, BlSZf0s0] = concat --...etc 
 What is the elegant/standard approach to solving this?

 This has been a feature in Microsoft Word for decades.

 I found SaxonCS (C#) and the Saxon/C API with support for C/C++, PHP and Python. Wikipedia lists XMLPrime (.NET) as an alternative to Saxon. Using all these is possible but a little unpleasant.
 I'd love to work with XSLT using Haskell, but I couldn't find anything newer than hxt-xslt or libxslt. Where to look next?
 Thanks for your time!
 PS: another interesting alternative for me seems to use Saxon as an opportunity to learn Scala and access Saxon via the JVM but it's also completely new to me.

 ​
 currently, I have the following in my emacs init.el to activate a conda environment when an ipython is started (mostly through C-c C-c on a python script):
 (add-hook 'elpy-mode-hook '(lambda ()
 (pyvenv-activate "~/anaconda3/envs/my_env"))) 
 with my_env being the environment that I mostly use. However sometimes I want to switch environment and would like to do so within emacs. I tried reevaluating pyvenv-activate in the current ipython session, and in the python script where I would eventually run C-c C-c, but I couldn't make it work. 
 ​
 If I could get to a function where I could select a given environment in the list of existing ones, this would be even better (end goal).
 Any ideas? Thank you a lot in advance for your help!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I want to do this because I find evil often obscures the actual stuff behind, for lack of a better word. Many packages do not have evil bindings and I am always having to search for evil versions of packages. I want to experiment with lot of packages and really understand emacs. This is also the reason why I didn't for any emacs "distro" and wanted to understand and build my own config just like I have for vim. 
 So to wean off evil mode, I set up two functions to enable and disable evil.
 I know C-z switches between evil and emacs but I always tend to just evil if switch is that easy.
 The functions here include 'evil-escape-mode' as typing 'jk' (out of habit) places you in evil mode even if you don't activate it explicitly. So I needed to disable that too. 
 (defun Evil() (interactive) (evil-mode 1) (evil-escape-mode 1) (evil-org-mode 1) ) (defun Good() (interactive) (evil-mode 0) (evil-escape-mode 0) (evil-org-mode 0) ) 
 Did any of you learn more or understand better after using default emacs bindings?
 My plan is mostly use emacs bindings until I am more familar with emacs and to switch to evil in betwen when some intense editing is required.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone ! First time posting, be nice with me please ;) 
 Recently, I discovered org-attach, which allows to link files to org mode headlines. 
 Moreover, the folders created to store these files respect a particular rule, which is the following: 
 When you create a healine <-> file "link" with org-attach, a data folder will be created (if it isn't already). A uuid is given to the headline. Finally, a subfolder is created automatically in data with the following method: 
 data/two first number of the uuid/ the rest of the number/ the files attached to a headline are here
 ​
 So here are my two questions, which follows from my question in the title: 
 - can we store folders, not just files? I did the test, and it seems to work by manually inserting the folder (by testing the insertion of a link from a folder to an attachment for example). I guess there must be good reasons why it doesn't work... but why?
 - did you change the properties of the creation and storage in the data folder ?
 ​
 I find this system almost revolutionary with the use of org roam for example. This system could allow to detach from a classical storage system (folder of folder etc, forming a search tree) which forces the user to have two "kind of storage": one for resources (pdf, png, git project, etc) and one for notes (org roam here, but same for org). This would allow to link the two systems. What do you think about it?
 ​
 Thanks you in advance for your answers :)

 I don't really have to know how to write this function step by step, I can figure it out if I get going, but I can't get going because I don't know how I make a function write something on my buffer... Can anyone help me with that?

 It involves a heavy rewrite, focusing on strong typing, involving many breaking changes (though it should still compose as previously):
  
Reply is replaced by BHResponse body
 decode/eitherDecode can't be used directly (see decodeResponse/eitherDecodeResponse)
 parseEsResponse return a ParsedEsResponse
 getStatus returns Either instead of Maybe
 Many functions have been strong typed from Reply (mainly BHResponse a)
 respIsTwoHunna has been replaced by isSuccess
  
My initial backlog has been shortened.
 My next tasks will be to integrate more and endpoints, and improve the documentation.
 I'm open to feedback, ideas, and contributions of course.

I‘m a writer of comics, poetry and fiction and a lover of slip notes of old.
I mean, old enough to remember my fascination and happiness working on a P. I. M. in the mid-80s with the (ever missed) unique askSam database. This must have been the time when I first heard about Luhmann‘s Zettelkasten with awe.
I currently use nvALT and am eagerly waiting for nvUltra. I am experimenting with The Archive as the idea of a uid and links convinces me (besides the other principles).
I am experimenting with 1writer, editorial and (next) obsidian - as I just read on the nvUltra site that both apps will be usable simultaneously.
I have been reading this forum for a while now, and I hope to find a solution which will give me back this joyful feeling of beautiful code and lightning fast data entry/retrieval/surprise!
Glad to find people interested in these questions.

 In Python, I'd process the large file line by line, check if line matches a regexp, if so, get the date from that line, create a file with that date (or open it, if it exists) and append all following journal entry lines into that file, until I encounter a new timestamp line.
 How to do this in Elisp?
 Now I am trying to do this in Elisp, and am looking for the most idiomatic way for doing it. 
 I came across these concepts / functions:
  
get-buffer-create
 with-temp-buffer
 set-visited-filename (for later saving the buffer into a file)
  
My idea is to process the journal file, search timestamps, if found, put following lines into a new buffer (get-buffer-create "2020-02-03.txt" for instance).
 Finally I'd like to save the temp buffers to files via set-visited-filename and then save-buffer.
 Question
 Is this an idiomatic way for doing it in Emacs / Elisp?

 It nearly works but the Windows Emacs allways ask me for a "font installation directory" when I start Emacs.
  ; 'all-the-icons-install-fonts' is called in GUI mode if it is needed (use-package all-the-icons :init (when (and (not (member "all-the-icons" (font-family-list))) (window-system)) (all-the-icons-install-fonts t)) ) 
 Special fonts (modline, dired, etc) are not shown in Windows. In Linux they work.
 Any idea what could be wrong here?
 Sidenote: On Linux the Emacs runs in daemon-mode. On Windows it is a standalone.

 I would therefore like to set the matplotlib interactive mode on by default for any python code I run, without having to specify it... But couldn't find the solution so far...!
 I set my ipython in emacs with:

 Thank you a lot in advance for your help!

 I've been reading about free monads and watching some videos like this two:
 1 - Free Monads—Paweł Szulc - https://youtu.be/ycrpJrcWMp4
 2 - Free Monad in Scala - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzlCjgRWPDU
 And I was asking, why don't use tagless final to work with the description of the logic (algebra) and its evaluation by just switching the tag instead of using Free Monad? I don't know if there is a trivial answer just like 'To use the way you feel more comfortable' or maybe there is a good reason to do that.
 Thanks so much! :)

 To be clear, I'm looking to add indicators like such - while allowing me to dynamically color the indicators.
 Is anyone familiar with existing packages that combine images and text like this? Or whether or not this is even possible directly via elisp?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, a couple of days I decided to install Doom Emacs and so far I really like it. I have installed the packages Emms and Csharp-mode, but I have a few questions.
  
Is there any way to get syntax error highlighting in Csharp-mode like in C mode when editing a .c file? I'm still new to C#, so I want to know if what I'm writing will fail to compile or not without actually having to compile it. When editing a .c file I see like a check mark in the bottom right corner when there are no errors, but when I'm editing a .cs file there is nothing and it says "Flycheck, no checker"
 How do I adjust the volume of Emms? When I do 'M-x emms-volume-raise' it doesn't raise the volume at all and I can lower the volume to 0% but I can still hear the music. I'm using Gentoo with Pulseaudio. I have the alsa and sound USE flags enabled for Emacs.
  
Any help would be greatly appreciated!

I checked consult, TRAMP, etc, but apparently recentf-mode itself was the issue: if there's at least one remote file name in the list, startup takes longer, even if auto-cleanup is disabled. As soon as the remote files are removed my startup time goes back to normal. 
 Is there any way to fix this without limiting recentf to local files? It's not a serious issue, but it is annoying.

 As Magit is to git, as transient is to Magit, transient can be to special modes. At least it seems that way. Prepare to read why any solution will look a lot like evil-collection. If you work on special modes and transient, please speak up.
 I started work on a modal package that's going well. What is clear early on is that a modal system in a special mode buffer is not going to work well without adaptation. The point of a special mode is to act more like an application. It has a data model, business rules, unique commands, and no use for many "normal" commands. I think there is a clear need to separate how I treat prog, text, and special modes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm looking at Balakrishnan's Introductory Discrete Mathematics and, following his definition of induction, he has this definition of recursion
  
1.Basis part: This part tells us that certain elements belong to the set we are going to define. 
  
Inductive (recursive) part: This part tells us to use the elements currently in the set to obtain more objects that can be included in the set. 
 
Closure part: This part tells that the only elements in the set are those obtained by (1) and (2).
 
  
then he has this example
  
To define the set A of positive integers divisible by the number 5 recursively, we have the recursive definition consisting of the following three parts: 
 (a) 5 is an element of A. 
 (b) If n is an element of A, then n + 5 also is an element of A. 
 (c) An object is in A if and only if it is obtained by a repeated application of (a) and (b).
  
I know what closure means in math, i.e., an operation is a closure if it is "well-defined," i.e., it doesn't land you outside the set, e.g., subtraction is not well-defined with the natural numbers. And I have a grasp of programming closure, i.e., you capture values inside expressions. But I don't know how 3. (or c.) above relates to recursion. In general, I'm weak on how programming closure and math closure are related. I'm sure they must be, i.e., they didn't just accidentally use the term in one without it being some form of the other.

 I'm studying computer science at university and currently finishing my 2nd year. As my functional programming exam looms I have reflected on my experience with Haskell.
 I unfortunately had a different expectation to what the module became. I picked the Advanced Functional Programming module voluntarily on the basis it would entail some quirky and interesting approaches to programming and may open doors to different careers. I in fact picked it over a C++ module.
 I fear I chose wrong as all I encountered was 'gotcha' solutions to baffling problems, and the headache of understanding the >>= and (*) functions in monadic programming. I, perhaps naively, expected Haskell to be very maths-oriented and provide capability in fintech. Instead I read now that Haskell's popularity lessens yearly and I wish I took C++ for a more applicable programming language understanding.
 Perhaps it is just my ineptitude however at times I am presented with sample problems, and when the solution is presented it is alien and completely unanticipated. For example, recreating basic games like sudoku within Haskell's constraints.
 Does anyone have any opinions on what Haskell can service in the industry? I'd like to see the silver lining of taking this otherwise awkward module.

 Then convert it into a SnowPark (Spark API From Snowflake) Row and convert Case Class Into SnowPark StructType. 
 For this second point SnowPark doesn’t have the implementation yet. So I was thinking on parsing it using Shapeless.
 So the first point is finding a library similar to jsoniter for parsing xml for the second approach.
 For the second point someone knows how to implement it with Shapeless? Do you have a example?
 Thanks in advance 🙂

 Here's my regexp: org-todo-line-regexp:

 With the cursor at the beginning of the said line (**** Infos), here's what I get:
 `M-: (looking-at org-todo-line-regexp)` => t 
 Is there another way for checking if I am visiting a todo heading (active or done).
 Edit
 The question mark at the end of the regexp ...WAITING\\)\\)? says: One or no repetition of the previous group (the group being the TODO keywords).
 So the regexp says: A todo line starts with stars and has one or no todo keyword.
 But what I need is a line that definitely has a todo keyword. So I need to modify the regexp, which is defined in org.el.

 It happens also that I have multiple (more or less) related TODO items linking to the same message thread (ever managed having people keep threads focused and on point?).
 And, of course, I sometimes capture the same thing twice because I forgot I already captured it earlier.
 So wouldn't it be cool if I could be on a thread and find all TODO items that link to it?
 With org-ql: Yes you can, thanks to Custom Predicates: org-backlinks (see code).
 Example is for notmuch, but the org-backlinks predicate is generic and should work with any links, so it should work with gnus or any other stuff.
 In fact, you can use it to find backlinks between Org items without any other packages except org-ql and the builtin properties:
 ``lisp (defun mf-org--get-links-to-current-id () (interactive) (let ((current-id (org-entry-get nil "ID" :inherit t))) (if current-id (org-ql-search (org-agenda-files) (org-backlinks ,(format "id:%s" current-id))) (message "No nearby ID found"))))
 (define-key org-mode-map (kbd "C-z t b") 'mf-org--get-links-to-current-id) ```

 I am trying to build a simple Todo application using Http4s and Cats Effect.
 My Question is , is it alright to wrap everything in IO[_] , when returning some values from DB layer?? Or is there a better pattern returning the value ??
 ​
 it would be something like below
 trait TodoRepository { def create(todo: Todo): IO[Todo] def get(id: Long) : IO[Option[Todo]] def all() : IO[Option[List[Todo]]] } 
 Open for ideas and any suggestions.

 ```

 { "username" : "admin", "password" : "password123" }

 DELETE https://restful-booker.herokuapp.com/booking/:bookingid Content-Type: application/json Cookie: token=:token ```
 I execute the first two requests using C-c C-c and get the expected JSON results. However, when I execute the third request (which uses variables created by the first two requests) I get the following message:
  Forbidden DELETE https://restful-booker.herokuapp.com/booking/:bookingid HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden Server: Cowboy Connection: keep-alive X-Powered-By: Express Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8 Content-Length: 9 Etag: W/"9-PatfYBLj4Um1qTm5zrukoLhNyPU" Date: Thu, 26 May 2022 20:33:01 GMT Via: 1.1 vegur Request duration: 0.102513s 
 The first thing I notice is that :bookingid doesn't seem to expand in the second line.
 Does anyone know what I'm missing when using jq-set-var?

 I'm struggling to use my knowledge to built something more substantial though. I don't know how to 'think in Haskell' yet.
 I'd like to build some kind of cli todo list so I would need to read about IO/Files in Haskell but that means I need to understand more advanced topics like Type classes, Monads, functors etc but they are much later in my book. Normally, I would look at an API and see what is there but Haskell is very different to me at the moment.
 Do you have any tips on how I can think like a Haskell programmer?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm currently trying to use Spacemacs, because I love Vim's keybindings and found Spacemacs to be easy to install.
 The projects I'm working on have the following directory structure (company's repo, can't change it):
 /someproject/package.json (I don't use this) /someproject/pyproject.toml (The root is a Python project) /someproject/webapp/package.json (webapp is the root of a React/Flow project, does not contain any Python file) /someproject/webapp/.flowconfig (This is where flow-lsp should start) 
 Python works like a charm! I'm still trying to properly configure Javascript/Flow in my Spacemacs installation, though.
 What I want is that, when I open a JS file inside webapp, it starts flow-lsp at the /someproject/webapp directory. However, flow-lsp is started at /someproject, which will fail because /someproject does not contain a .flowconfig file. My Spacemacs configuration layers is:
 dotspacemacs-configuration-layers '( (javascript :variables javascript-backend 'lsp js2-mode-show-strict-warnings nil js2-mode-show-parse-errors nil ) ... (lsp :variables lsp-lens-enable 1 lsp-use-lsp-ui 1 lsp-headerline-breadcrumb-segments '(project file symbols)) ...) 
 I tried many combinations for the projectile-project-root-functions , this is the current one:
 '(projectile-project-root-functions '(projectile-root-top-down projectile-root-bottom-up projectile-root-local)) 
 When I try to open a Javascript file, Emacs is stuck and I'm only able to know what's going on after I send SIGUSR2 to the process. I then can see that it's trying to load flow-ls and failing (and doing so infinitely):
 Could not open_in_bin: '/home/myuser/code/someproject/.flowconfig' ((Sys_error "/home/myuser/code/someproject/.flowconfig: No such file or directory")) 
 Creating a .projectile in webapp does not work. How can I tell emacs to use the webapp directory for flow-ls?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey folks,
 I'm looking to spawn a new frame for org-capture, capture something and then kill the frame. 
 I already have something similar. Not sure where I found it: https://gist.github.com/dmitrym0/04a1893bbdc2dce2654c81c13b1a2965
 The problem is when I initially invoke this (via "/opt/homebrew/bin/emacsclient -n -e '(my/org-capture-in-popout-frame)'") it takes at least 3 keypresses to activate the capture (Emacs 28, MacOS). I'm looking at the code and it's too dense for me at my current level of understanding.
 Is there a robust piece of code out there that does this already?
 Alternatively, do you maybe see what the code is doing that would make it misbehave? It worked fine with Emacs 27.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Still new to Emacs and Doom so i am reading a ton of information.
 But i still ignore how to make changes (customize) some already installed packages.
 For instance, I would like to get authenticated and join some channel automatically using erc-tls.
 To achieve this, I tried the lots of things like: (use-package! erc) or (package! erc) etc.
 Then i paste this:
 (setq erc-prompt (lambda ( (concat "[" (buffer-name) "]")) erc-server "irc.libera.chat" erc-nick "NICK" erc-user-full-name "FULLNAME" erc-track-shorten-start 24 erc-autojoin-channels-alist '(("irc.libera.chat" "#gentoo"")) erc-kill-buffer-on-part t erc-fill-column 100 erc-fill-function 'erc-fill-static erc-fill-static-center 20 ;; erc-auto-query 'bury )) 
 I put everything in the config.el file but nothing works.
 I am using Emacs 28.1 with Doom 3.0, under Gentoo Linux.
 I tried some very simple changes but nothing changed.
 Can someone explain me how things work here?
 Thanks in advance,

  (||) :: Bool -> Bool -> Bool True || _ = True False || x = x 
 The type family equivalent of this operator (||) is defined like this
  type family a || b where 'False || a = a 'True || a = 'True a || 'False = a a || 'True = 'True a || a = a 
 Could someone please explain to me why do we need the additional 3 equations in the type family definition? In GHCi I see that (what I assume is) derived kind of this type family is

 So I assume that passing in anything with kind other than Bool would fail to kind check. I don't understand under what circumstances would any of the last 3 cases be ever used.
 Also are there good reasons why the definition doesn't have explicit kind annotations (as in type family (a :: Bool) || (b :: Bool) :: Bool where ...)?

 Emacs based options
 I do use org-mode as spreadsheet a lot for smaller tasks. With it, I am able to quickly make tables, enter data, make small calculations and can export them to other programs using csv. But org mode can not fully replace a spreadsheet program. I tried other emacs modes like ses modebut did not find it satisfactory, for start the cell alignment seemed very off. 
 Vim based options
 I tried few unixy, vimmy spreadsheets like sc-im, sc etc but entering dates, autofilliing and created named cells and ranges was not supported. Also can't use these in windows while at work. Vim table mode provided some table editing supported but lacked a lot.
 Free unix spreadsheets
 Gnumeric hanged a lot in my manjaro setup. Libre office was good but it had bad shortcut keys and didn't have those that I already used in excel. 
 So I have kinda accepted defeat to use a proprietary program without vim or emacs like keybindings for spreadsheets i.e excel. There doesn't seem to be alternative now.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Rust people had a similar discussion a few years back when crates.io was starting to get a lot of derelict packages. Keeping individual authority over a hosted repo is generally bad for its health and the ecosystem health.
 Add someone to your Github repo
 Settings → Collaborators & Teams → Add people / teams
 If you don't have someone in mind, look for someone or some team who maintains other packages that you use and ask them if they are too busy. If you trust them in your software delivery pipeline already because you're using their packages, you might as well trust them to not accept junk into your package. I'm adopting software lately under the Positron org, so even get a hold of me and we can make an Emacs-specific team exactly this kind of redundancy.
 There's two big reason to do this. First, more often than not, a repo with an individual authority will become an unintentional name-squatter soaking up Google traffic, filling up with forks in its network but nothing going into the original repo. It is a local black hole for ecosystem momentum. Second, you will inadvertently build teams. Instead of the unwanted pressure of being a solo maintainer, you will have the mutual encouragement from the assurance that the project is going to live, not just sit there, even if you want to take a break.
 When you neglect a package, the contributions still arrive, but they show up in forks in your Github network graph. People are making changes, but they aren't bothering to PR because they don't think anyone is listening, so they're all just pushing changes just in case. Go check your network for commits in other forks. See if your package is still the branch leader. Dust off the PR's and make sure not to look abandoned. Comment on fork commits. If you want to abandon a project, add it to an organization or add some people to the admin roles. Let people know to go elsewhere for PR's and questions. Tell someone else how your package works.

Under the hood, many PPLs make use of big libraries such as TensorFlow, JAX or Theano / Aesara (a fork of Theano) that provide fast, vectorized array and matrix computations and, for gradient-based inference algorithms, automatic differentiation.

 This tutorial is based on this one from FP Complete (link), with some gaps filled in
 The Goal
 Build this stack project normally, and put the results in a docker image to be run on the same system
 Static Build
  
We're going to build the project to a static executable
 This is to save the trouble of putting dependent libraries into the docker image
 If you want to do this, it appears the easiest way is to build the project in a docker image. See this stack documentation (link) for more information

 Config? well, I use Doom Emacs (which I love) and have nothing in my personal configuration related to TRAMP. In Doom, for the TRAMP hanging forever, they point to the Emacswiki, but come one! I wish stuff just work out of the box :(
 Is there any TRAMP configuration that works out of the box and flawlessly?

It can be used to dispatch shell commands to an external program dtach, which allows processes to outlive Emacs.
 The new release is version 0.7, and here is a list of improvements and change that has been made:
  
The development of the package has been moved to sourcehut at https://git.sr.ht/~niklaseklund/detached.el
 The configuration of the package has been drastically improved, now users simply need to call (dtache-init) to integrate with all supported packages. Of course the integration …]]></summary>

 I am trying to experiment with some ideas regarding type systems. That's when I arrived at the problem: using the type system to enforce guarantees about bindings inside terms.
 The simplest idea that worked very well for me was using DeBruijn indices with a Scope type. If some part of the tree was marked as Scope Term, then there was a new variable bound in that term. It's a fairly weak guarantee. I could break it at any time by simply destructuring the Scope and using it directly. But it's easy to create some functions that enforce the scoping rules.
 ``` -- The base calculus
 newtype Scope a = Scope a
 data Term = Variable Int | Function (Scope Term) | Apply Term Term
 -- Utilities for traversing the term
 type Depth = Reader Int

 I need to maintain an Orgdown file in a repository. For various reasons, I don't want to edit that file directly. I want to keep the data as a sub-heading in one of my agenda files as the "main" data source.
 Therefore, I'm wondering if anybody has a workflow where a certain sub-hierarchy (defined by an ID property) is automatically copied to a defined file somewhere else. This external file only contains the single sub-hierarchy and no additional content. There is no-one editing that file besides me so a "blind" one-directional export (overwriting the previous version) + commit is viable.
 Is there anybody who did this already?

 Is there a way to make the beorg calendar write calendar events (even those that come from iphone calendar etc) into my dropbox org files folder, so that I can also see those events on my desktop emacs ?

 I was using the org-gcal package for a while, but then it stopped working. (not sure why, and I burned some time trying to get it to work per all the github issues, docs, etc).
 Per https://orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/org-google-sync.html, I tried using an awk script (https://github.com/msherry/ical2org), which almost did what I needed, but not quite.
 I wrote a simple python script at https://github.com/jzohrab/py-ical-to-org , using an existing python ical parsing library, and it seems to work well. At least, it's working so far, and does what little I need!
 If you have python etc set up, you can give it a shot. Cheers! jz

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, 
 I'm a newcomer to Scala and was hoping to speed up my learnings by building a basic CRUD app's backend in Scala (the frontend would probably be in React, I'm experienced in that regard and can probably just use a past project template of mine). 
 The database operations would not be too overly complex - basic user profiling, authentication, and what you can think of as a scheduling app. With that in mind, is there a particular type of backend structure/framework in Scala that comes to mind that would be useful to use, and are there any hosting options that come to mind along with it? 
 I've read a bit about using Play to stand up the API and then hosting an image of my build on AWS' Elastic Beanstalk, but it's always hard as a newcomer who doesn't know much about the language and its frameworks to make a judgement call like this. For reference, I spend most of my regular time developing Lambdas and State Machines for a fitness application at work that uses TypeScript, to give some frame of reference.

If I put an html tag before the headline, it gets exported within the previous heading, which breaks the open/close matching. If I put it after, it gets exported within the contents of the outline, which also breaks unless the closing tags given are also in the same outline.
 All I basically want to do is wrap certain headings in custom HTML, but org makes it impossible to accomplish this due to not being able to insert text before a heading but after the previous. Is there any way to accomplish what I'm attempting, or would I have to advice some ox-html function?
 As far as I know HTML_HEAD refers to the head tag and HTML container only takes a single symbolic argument, not literal HTML.
 I'm on my phone, but I will post the org file with exactly what I'm trying to do when I can get to my computer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is based on the "nth prime" exercism.org exercise - https://exercism.org/tracks/haskell/exercises/nth-prime
 In the code below, nth runs the unit tests on my machine about 10% more slowly than nthButFaster.
 They're both effectively doing the same comparison: is the candidate number not evenly divisible by all the known prime numbers that came before it? However the primeFinder function below knows that the starting series of primes is [2, 3] and that its first candidate is 5, so it can increment by two each time thereafter, skipping all even numbers (because two is the only even prime, and that's already in the list). Thus it cuts the number of comparisons in half, compared to the infinite series of integers that goes up one at a time from [2..] in the primes function. Maybe there's slowdown in the all from the isPrime function, or maybe it's slower to concatenate lists than it is to cons them.
 How would you explain it to a noob like me, wise Haskell users? Why is one approach faster?
 module Prime (nth, nthButFaster) where nth :: Int -> Maybe Integer nth n | n < 1 = Nothing | otherwise = Just $ primeFinder [2, 3] 5 n nthButFaster :: Int -> Maybe Integer nthButFaster n | n < 1 = Nothing | otherwise = Just $ primes !!

(n - 1) | isPrime previousPrimes candidate = primeFinder (previousPrimes ++ [candidate]) (candidate + 2) n | otherwise = primeFinder previousPrimes (candidate + 2) n isPrime :: [Integer] -> Integer -> Bool isPrime previousPrimes x = all (\knownPrime -> x `mod` knownPrime /= 0) previousPrimes

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The other day I had this post, where I learned for the first time that stack is exclusively(?) for creating and managing projects, that what I was trying to do, i.e., just have *.hs files wherever and loading them from ghci started wherever is dysfunctional. The workaround was to do stack new, go into that directory and add whatever packages to the package.yaml, then whatever extra-deps were necessary in that stack.yaml, then do my *.hs files at my leisure, ignoring the project skeleton from then on.
 What I had been doing (per some tutorial) was creating a minimal stack.yaml in a desired directory
 resolver: lts-19.8 packages: [] extra-deps: [] 
 then run stack setup, then, in my latest case
 stack build Chart-diagrams hmatrix hmatrix-gsl hmatrix-gsl-stats 
 then, upon failures, add the suggested lines to the extra-deps section of the stack.yaml. This seemed to work for me before, i.e., I could go to that directory, start up ghci and it would indeed be that 9.0.2 ghci... But then just lately I couldn't get the hmatrix stuff found. So is this method I just described actually creating a whole separate Haskell system in this directory? Or is it just doing something to my global ~/.stack/global-project/... ? In general, I really just want to do *.hs files (or org-mode files) along with a ghci. Can I just add packages to the global and have them be seen? In this hmatrix case, it was bombing. Although the workaround suggestion described above to fake a project did work. What am I missing? What can I do if I just want to test stuff, work through tutorials, and not mess with the project files in .../app and .../src?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm a complete beginner to haskell and I have an exercise where I have to read a list of coordinates from a txt file and sort them based on their magnitude (distance from the origin point). Solving it in python was no problem but now I have to solve it for haskell as well. The biggest obstacle for my is converting these char coordinates to float numbers.
 I know how to separate them by lines and words:
  qsort :: String -> IO () qsort file = do content <- readFile (file++".txt") let linesOfFiles = lines content x = map words linesOfFiles print magnitude x 
 (although it gives me a parse/indentation error)
 And here's my attempt at a magnitude function:
  magnitude :: [a] -> Float magnitude words = if length words == 3 then sqrt (sum (map (^2) (char2float words))) else 10000000000 Double 
 My biggest problem right now is figuring out how to turn [char] to Floats so the sorting algorithm can actually compare them. I've only been working with imperative languages so far so naturally I find Haskell very daunting, and I haven't gotten into the sorting yet.

 which works. Why is ccalc out of scope inside the where clause? It's part of the defining let clause, is it not?

 my windmove config looks like so: elisp (use-package windmove :config (setq windmove-wrap-around t) ;; WIND move keybindings: (windmove-default-keybindings '(shift)) ;; Make windmove work in org except when org needs the keybinding: (add-hook 'org-shiftup-final-hook 'windmove-up) (add-hook 'org-shiftleft-final-hook 'windmove-left) (add-hook 'org-shiftdown-final-hook 'windmove-down) (add-hook 'org-shiftright-final-hook 'windmove-right)) 
 i tried adding an :after org declaration, and an :ensure t to this but it had no effect. does the hook adding in that snippet need to go anywhere in particular in a use-package config? i would have thought it cd be anywhere so long as org was loaded, which it always is. i have checked the hooks and the windmove functions have been added.
 i also tried not putting the add-hook declarations in the windmove config, just having them in an init file as they used to be, and this also does not work.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been reviewing the notes I took on a book from pre-Zettelkasten days, and more than ever, I have been struck with the reality that our brain filters information to a large degree. Pre-Zettelkasten I would copy the original quote from the book, and set up a review cycle, typically the next day, three days, one week, one month, and depending on how much I enjoyed the quote, I would review it every 3 - to 6 months after that. I would capture Journal type entry notes about how I felt about the selection, what it meant to me, and what I could learn from it, and due to the mind mapping software I used (TheBrain.com), I could link to other thoughts at will.
It is little wonder that I felt an instant kinship when I learned of the Zettelkasten methodology. However, I am taken aback by two things as I convert the old notes to my new Zettels. First, how journal entries often evolved, meaning my perception of what the author said changed as my knowledge of the topic increased. Second, I have often split a note into two or more Zettels to accommodate the atomic principle. My question is for those who don't keep the original quote as part of their Zettel. How often do you review the original author's quote, or do you ever?]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[hi emacsers,
 i'm working on segment.el (https://codeberg.org/martianh/segment), which aims to port complex sentence break/no-break rules from translation software like OmegaT and the Okapi Framework into Elisp. I manually ported a set of English rules, but then I started working on conversion functions to do the rest of the languages that have rulesets programatically.
 i'm by no means an expert programmer, and my regex foo is middling. i was wondering if anyone might be able to take a look and suggest how to go about doing conversion reliably?
 one of the difficulties i have is in dealing with the different ways emacs displays strings, both for its own regexes and for the ICU regex strings that are to be converted.
 in the repo, segment-regexes.el contains some manually converted rules, segment-convert.el contains some very primitive/blind converting fumbling in the dark, and the ICU-formatted rules are in .srx files in subfolders. they're formatted as XML. some explanation of the unicode properties used by ICU regexes is in segment-unicode-properties-used-by-ICU-regexes.txt
 i started doing this to reliably segment text for translation in emacs, but then thought if it got done properly it could be useful for other packages also.
 the code in the repo is very green, btw.
 PS: let's not have a stoush about double spaces ending sentences. i have read those discussion, and i'm interested in segmenting files that i have not typed out myself.

If I activate follow-mode in the helm result list, I can navigate all listed references and keep the helm result list open. But I cannot temporarily switch from the helm result list to the buffer with the reference to navigate up and down to get more context for the reference, and then come back to the helm result list to continue investigating the rest of the references. The helm result window always closes when I switch out from the helm result buffer. I can recreate the helm session by doing C-x c b and continue investigating all the other references. Is there a way to pin the helm result window and keep it open when I switch to a specific reference in the result list?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As I am posting questions with code samples on stackoverflow or in this forum, I mark my code, prefix it with 4 spaces, copy it.
 I'd like to automate it. This is what I came up with, but it won't work, as I don't know the idiomatic ways to write this in Elisp:
 (defun ugt-copy-code () "Copy code for forums, prefixing it with 4 spaces." (interactive) (save-excursion (let ((my-prefix " ") (beg (progn (backward-paragraph) (set-mark (point)) (region-beginning))) (end (progn (forward-paragraph) (region-end)))) (kill-ring-save beg end) (with-temp-buffer (yank) (beginning-of-buffer) (set-mark (point)) (end-of-buffer) (string-insert-rectangle beg end my-prefix) (kill-ring-save (region-beginning) (region-end)))))) 
 Any help is appreciated.

 I need a singleton type to control a function’s parameters amount:

 if (params.size != ev.value) throw new IllegalArgumentException 
 But I would like it never enters the function body with the wrong amount of parameters, something like (invalid code):
 def apply[N <: Int with Singleton](params: Double*)(implicit ev: ValueOf[N])(implicit ev2: N =:= ValueOf[params.size]): Neuron[N] = 
 Is there any way to do it?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I'm editing an Org file using Doom Emacs in insert mode and my cursor is on the line of a heading, the Tab key seems to demote the heading while Shift-Tab seems to promote the heading. On the other hand, in my personal config the Tab key in insert mode on a heading line seems to have behavior that is context dependent. For instance, if I have a single heading and nothing else in my org document the tab key seems to do nothing in insert mode. On the other hand, if I have multiple headings the tab key seems to cycle through several different heading levels, from one deeper than my previous deepest level, all the way up to the outermost level.
 In both my personal config and my Doom config, tab seems to be bound to org-cycle in insert mode. The values for the variables org-cycle-level-after-item/entry-creation and org-cycle-emulate-tab are identical for both my personal session and my doom session. I don't really understand how to dig deeper into what might be causing this discrepancy in behavior between the two different sessions of Emacs. I really like Doom's tab behavior, and would like to replicate it in my personal config. If anyone has any ideas on how I should go about understanding this better and achieving my desired config I'd appreciate it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am using Doom-emacs, but I am pretty sure this is not Doom specific. I was able to setup lsp-mode for python, and it works fine for my own code. But if i am using external dependencies, for instance, I am using sqlalchemy, if I have from sqlalchemy import util in my project/workspace, I can easily go to the util.py file for sqlalchemy by command evil-goto-definition, but once I am in util.py, then go to definition does not work, 'cus I think the package folder for sqlalchemy is not part of the workspace that lsp is aware of.
 Basically, this causes lsp to fail for any external packages...
 Is there a way to solve this? in vscode, everything works even you go into nested external packages, it just is able to figure out and all the lsp stuff works.

 I know what the function should do (switching the bool at a given position), but I am not sure how to write the code for it. I am supposed to create the function out of the test results.
 I hope someone can help me, thanks :)

 Code:
 -- | Something about flipping values
 switch :: [Bool] -> Int -> [Bool]
 switch -- I dont know :c
 -- | The test results:
 tests :: Test
 tests = TestLabel "Inventive" (TestList [
 switch [True, False, True] 1 ~?= [True, True, True],

  (let ((var value) (many-other-vars other-long-value)) (add-hook 'mode-hook (lambda nil (do-something var)))) 
 Utilizing lexical binding. This works well, but then I have many-other-vars in the closure resulting in unnecessary saving of values and the previously small lambda function becomes quite cumbersome to view in subsequent inspections.
 I then resort to the following solution: ``` (defun make-hook (var) (lambda nil (do-something var)))
 (let ((var value) (many-other-vars other-long-value)) (add-hook 'mode-hook (make-hook var))) ```
 which then has the desired effect of having only the variable var in the closure. But this is counterproductive as now I have to define a function for each lambda I need (defeating the goal of creating anonymous functions on the fly).
 Is there a way to limit the closure to specific variables? Other languages have such features (like C++'s lambda functions) but I can't seem to replicate it in emacs-lisp. I tried creating a macro to replicate the solution above but this seems impossible.

I wrote a new major mode jsonian-mode which parses only as necessary and minimizes the regex usage for syntax highlighting. This means that navigating very large files is faster. The json-snatcher (jsonian-path) function does not blow its stack on large files. It also includes a pretty nice utility for editing multi-line JSON strings (jsonian-edit-string).
 Since I use this regularly for work, and am maintaining it anyway, I figured other people might find it useful as well. Let me know if you find this useful. If you end up using jsonian-mode and find something wrong, please file an issue.

 (please, see images here or on [gallery@Postimawes](https://postimg.cc/gallery/hXdhXDs) ).
 Helm in \"standard\", divided window.
 Helm as pop-up, actually a new frame.
 ​
 So I checked the settings in list-faces-display. There is not any font like in this helm pop-up frame.
 ​
 Also I checked:
 ​
 (add-to-list 'default-frame-alist '(font . "Iosevka Term-14:normal"))
 ​
 This is a proper setting (I think) as new opened frames (like C-x 5 b) have correct font.
 ​
 Also I tried checked and uncheck the Inherit property in default font settings.
 ​
 No luck.
 ​
 Where can be definition (hidden) of the font of pop-up frame?
 ​
 Thanks for any idea.

 I am planning to do this by building a product similar to Google Photos, where end users can upload and share their pictures through shared albums. Ideally, something that can support a huge database and a very high number of connections. It is a very long-term thing, so there is no rush from my side.
 For the front end, I am planning to pick an SPA framework since I am pretty experienced there.
 For the back end, I was planning to build it with haskell. Last semester I took a haskell course in University and I really liked it. I also think I have a knack for it. I recently even purchased a book just so I can go learn haskell really in depth.…]]></summary>

 I've been slowing studying "Hutton_G_Programming_in_Haskell" doing methodically all exercises of part I. I have not yet finished part II of the book but I think I have enough knowledge to be productive as an interne somewhere, especially so, I have several years of coding experience in other languages (mainly python).
 Where should I knock to ask for a part-time "online" internship ? I live in West Africa (Cote d'Ivoire) and there no company, I know of in a thousand mile radius, that does Haskell. I kind of feel alone in my learning endeavor.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Native compilation has been out for some years, and the performance boost from it for old machines is night and day, e.g. my old macbook.
 However, with the beefy hardware of the new machines, e.g. M1 mac, the effect of native compilation becomes indistinguishable. On my Linux desktop, which was built in 2019, I have been using native compilation since the beginning, but I just freshly compiled from source without native compilation and found no obvious performance difference at all.
 And on my new macbook with M1Pro, the performance is similar, and no obvious power consumption difference. 
 Without performance differences, the only thing native compilation brings is the large usage in disk space, although in today's standard, the disk space used by native compilation is far from being significant. 
 I am curious how many people are using native compilation right now. What machine you are on and why?

 |$ 10.123,45| |$ 5.134,32 | |$ 123,18 | |-----------| | | 
 It seems that the currency character ("$"), and the thousand separator in the value prevent Org from summing the values, and I haven't found an option to customize that.
 The workaround I found was to replace query-regex-replace the "$", and dots with nothing to remove them. But I was wondering about possible alternatives. Any ideas?
 Thanks!

 I need help with vterm installation, cause I've already spent more than a day digging into it.
 I've installed vterm, but when I run M-x vterm, then nothing happens.
 init.el file content:
 ;; Default shell (setq-default explicit-shell-file-name "/bin/bash") (require 'package) (add-to-list 'package-archives '("melpa" . "https://melpa.org/packages/")) ;;vterm (use-package vterm :load-path "/path/to/emacs-libvterm") 
 Emacs has modules support:
 $ emacs -batch --eval="(prin1 module-file-suffix)"; echo ".so" $ emacs -batch --eval="(prin1 system-configuration-features)"; echo "ACL CAIRO DBUS FREETYPE GIF GLIB GMP GNUTLS GPM GSETTINGS HARFBUZZ JPEG JSON LCMS2 LIBOTF LIBSELINUX LIBSYSTEMD LIBXML2 M17N_FLT MODULES NATIVE_COMP NOTIFY INOTIFY PDUMPER PNG RSVG SECCOMP SOUND THREADS TIFF TOOLKIT_SCROLL_BARS X11 XDBE XIM XINPUT2 XPM GTK3 ZLIB" 
 It has been successfully built:
 emacs-libvterm/build$ make [ 8%] Performing update step for 'libvterm' [ 16%] No configure step for 'libvterm' [ 25%] Performing build step for 'libvterm' [ 33%] No install step for 'libvterm' [ 41%] Completed 'libvterm' [ 66%] Built target libvterm [100%] Built target vterm-module 
 emacs version:
 emacs (edge) 29.0.50-master-44e5339 from Alex Murray (alexmurray) installed 
 Would be great to see at least some errors/warnings, but in my case nothing happens.
 Please, help to find out, what I'm missing.
 UPDATE. The reason was that $SHELL variable hasn't been set properly.
 It was pointing to the old missing shell.

 sign :: Int -> String sign n | n == 0 = "Zero" | n < 0 = "Negative" | n > 0 = "Positive" 
 Is it because when we generalise and have a more complex type with more operators, we could have a prohibitively long number of combinations which need to be checked at compile time? is it a thoughtful language decision so that if we add more variants/cases to a sum type then this would require us to manually go in and change all functions that accept that type? And if this is the case, is there a way GHC let's me decide that trade-off on a case by case basis such that the above could work without a non-exhaustive warning? i.e by checking that it does in fact cover all possible cases.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Until now I have written most of my Org and Markdown files with auto-fill-mode, never exceeding more than 80 characters per column. However, I've increasingly noticed many counterexamples, where each paragraph was a single long line of text. Some platforms like GitHub seem to encourage this practice, as newlines in comments are treated as newlines in the rendered page, contrary to vanilla Markdown.
 There seem to be some advantages to this approach. For example, writing prose with mixed-pitch-mode makes a lot more sense if lines are arbitrarily long, and I find it a lot more pleasant. But if I'm sharing a document with someone else, I wonder if generally they'd be annoyed at receiving a document without wrapping that requires them to enable visual-fill-column-mode and visual-line-mode, disable hl-line-mode, etc. I know I was at first before I discovered how to make the experience feel like I was using auto-fill-mode instead.
 I'm interested to hear /r/emacs 's thoughts on this!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm switching to Transient from Hydra for my build commands. Hydra was great, but being able to toggle switches on and off quickly was something I always wanted to be able to do, and Transient makes it a lot easier--indeed, that seems to be its raison d'etre. 
 I'm going through both the very dry and obtuse manual, but also the excellent writeups posted here and on github. However, I still have two questions that don't seem to have answers.
  
Is there any way to display information without providing a way to act on it? One of the things about hydra was it was possible to display the state of variables (and arbitrary text) as part of the formatting. I used this to give me information on the context I was operating in, like what the root directory was, or what the peforce root was. I don't actually want to change those values, I just need to know them. What I've done in the interim is define an empty interactive function. I still get the key as a weird little prefix, but my data is displayed.
 I'm making extensive use of transient-define-suffix that takes an argument and completes from a list. The description is a lambda that reads and propertizes the saved variable (shamelessly stolen and repurposed from /u/psionikus' examples posted here). However, when I set them, the display doesn't update. I found the undocumented function (so many undocumented things!) (transient--redisplay) but it feels like I'm doing something wrong if I have to put it at the end of every one of my suffixes.
  
I appreciate that the documentation is getting better over time, but I still find it frustrating that I can't, say, find a list of all the keyword-value pairs. They're scattered throughout the docs, so if you don't know or don't remember what you're looking for, it's nearly impossible to find.
 That said, I'm making progress. The best way to do it seems just to do it, and hack around until you find a solution.

rapid creation of interactive elements like draggable points/responsive labels allowing for immediate exploratory feedback.

 This package is aimed at being able to specify arbitrary keymap modes along with arbitrary key sequence setups from scratch as concisely as possible.
 My reasons for a modal, key sequence, oriented bindings DSL: 
  
Reduce wrist and hand strain from the vigorous key-chording I used to do.
 Have major/minor mode specific bindings closer to the home row, for speed and ease.
 Be able to rapidly iterate over my keyboard config to see what feels good.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 Just took some time to bake a helper command to adjust the laptop's screen brightness, so as that I can easily adjust it in Emacs in a tiling window environment.
 The code is inspired (well, almost copied from) by text-scale-adjust:
 ```elisp (defun w/screen-brightness-adjust (inc) "Adjust the screen brightness by INC*10%.
 INC may be passed as a numeric prefix argument.
 The actual adjustment made depends on the final component of the key-binding used to invoke the command, with all modifiers removed:
 +, = Increase the height of the default face by one step - Decrease the height of the default face by one step
 After adjusting, continue to read input events and further adjust the screen brightness as long as the input event read (with all modifiers removed) is one of the above characters. " (interactive "p") (let ((ev last-command-event) (echo-keystrokes nil)) (let* ((base (event-basic-type ev)) (step (* inc 10)) (cmd (format "brightnessctl set %s%d%%%s" ; +10% or 10%- (if (or (= ?+ base) (= ?= base)) "+" "") step (if (= ?- base) "-" "")))) (shell-command cmd)
  (message "Use +,- for further adjustment by %d%%" step) (set-transient-map (let ((map (make-sparse-keymap))) (dolist (mods '(() (control))) (dolist (key '(?- ?+ ?=)) ;; = is often unshifted +. (define-key map (vector (append mods (list key))) (lambda () (interactive) (w/screen-brightness-adjust (abs inc)))))) map)))))

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am not a huge note taker, and we use Jira for organizing tasks at work. However, I've decided that org-mode isn't half bad at being a documentation companion, the easy tables are not as featured as I'd like but not half bad at quick register definition tables and such.
 I've been searching Google for the next thing I'd like to do, but haven't struck upon anything that doesn't require a lot of lisp. Surely there's just a Option mode or something for this. Basically I'd like to denote a section of an org document as a code-block for formatting. Just like Markdown and ``` or Reddit with four spaces on the side.
 Is there anyway to mark a section that should be rendered as a fixed-width font when exporting? I don't need to execute code or anything like that. I'd just like Markdown's "fixed-on" and "fixed-off" method.
 Any way to do that?

 I am trying to get to grips with using Org and Babel to run my life (potentially) out of one file.
 Right now I am simply trying to have my Emacs config as one heading of a file - other headings will be used for different projects I'm working on etc. 
 I've provided the complete file I have written right now, which currently fails to tangle anything at all with "Tangled 0 code blocks". 
 Earlier on today this would tangle everything, including the contents of '* To-Do List' out to my init.el, but I've been playing around with the :Properties: of each heading and seem to have broken it altogether.
 Is there something really obvious I'm missing here?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm rather new to Emacs, but I've found it and especially org-capture very useful. I know how to make an elisp macro to find a specific file or to find one from a variable, but I was wondering if there's a way to incorporate patterns and interactive prompts like %^{PROMPT} into find-file.
 For my work I have to look at a variety of a given documents in multiple languages/editions, which are broken down into sub-books and chapters. For example, reading the Iliad in both Greek and English. However, this results in directories with hundreds of files each, sometimes more, and trying to find the same chapter in a different edition is a pain. For sake of example, let's use the Bible.
 All files have been systematically assigned a file name that follows the same exact pattern. Note: Edition is used as both the subdirectory and the first part of the filename.
 ./(Edition)/(Edition)_(Book_ID)_(Chapter)_read.txt 
 Let's say I'm reading Genesis Chapter 1 in Greek. It's broken down by chapter at the following directory:
 ./grcbrent/grcbrent_002_GEN_01_read.txt ./grcbrent/grcbrent_002_GEN_02_read.txt ./grcbrent/grcbrent_003_EXO_01_read.txt 
 But, now I want to compare it with Genesis Chapter 1 in Latin:
 ./latVUC/latVUC_002_GEN_01_read.txt 
 So, is there an easy way to program a function that, while viewing ./grcbrent/grcbrent_002_GEN_01_read.txt, I don't know, reads buffer-file-name, replaces both the directory name and the first part of the filename until the first underscore with "%^{Edition}"("./%^{Edition}/%^{Edition}_002_GEN_01_read.txt") to produce a minibuffer like the following:
 Edition: 
 and after typing latVUC [RET] does (find-file "./latVUC/latVUC_002_GEN_01_read.txt") ?
 TLDR
 I want to be able to jump from version a of a file to version b, i.e. (./a/a_x_y.txt to ./b/b_x_y.txt) where b is typed in the minibuffer.
 I appreciate any help in figuring this out. Thanks!

 Using Doom Emacs, I installed ghub and forge and wrote in my config file:

 I created a GitHub token, pasted it in the required format in authinfo.gpg :

 But still each time I try any git interaction using Magit it asks me for username and password. I wouldn't complain usually, but now if you want to go through it you'll have to type the token instead of your password, which is not really practical.
 I try to fix this problem for some time using the ghub docs and other, with no success.
 Did it happen to anyone?

 I have been looking into jwiegley’s async, and see that you can create futures that allow emacs to be blocked until its child process exits.
 Is there a way for Emacs to be instead interrupted when child process exits? Then Emacs doesn’t need to be blocked until the child process exits.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I post this here in case I am doing something silly. My org experience has gone haywire - for instance I cannot display the agenda.
 I will describe two symptoms: In one of the files, there is a null byte (00) between each character. Here is a hexl view of a PROPERTIES block of one file.
 00000220: 0020 0020 0020 003a 0050 0052 004f 0050 . . . .:.P.R.O.P 00000230: 0045 0052 0054 0049 0045 0053 003a 000d .E.R.T.I.E.S.:.. 00000240: 000a 0020 0020 0020 003a 0049 0044 003a ... . . .:.I.D.: 00000250: 0020 0020 0020 0020 0020 0020 0020 0061 . . . . . . . .a 00000260: 0036 0061 0032 0072 0037 0071 0030 0079 .6.a.2.r.7.q.0.y 00000270: 0064 006a 0030 000d 000a 0020 0020 0020 .d.j.0..... . . 00000280: 003a 0045 004e 0044 003a 000d 000a 000d .:.E.N.D.:...... 
 Back to the agenda. Below is the traceback with the error. The looking-at(nil)makes me think it is the same issue.
 Debugger entered--Lisp error: (wrong-type-argument stringp nil) looking-at(nil) org-heading-components() org-in-commented-heading-p(t) org-agenda-prepare-buffers((list of files)) org-agenda-prepare("TAGS ") 
 Possibly related, althought I don't see how, is the question I posed a few hours ago, on how to escape the underscore character, where one of the answers (see here) suggests a zero width character - which I did try in an unrelated buffer.
 So, am I imagining a problem that is not here, or those null bytes really should not be there, and in that case, how did they get into my buffers?
 Thanks,
 Mirko

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[First of, https://github.com/obsidiansystems/obelisk is awesome! :)
 Lately, I have been playing around with blackjack, but found the available free online tools to be lacking always one or two things, so now I want to build something myself. 
 These are the loose specs:
  
Contains a gameplay mode, where one can play against the dealer with 0-5 bots
 
Contains a simulator that matches the best free simulators, but won't match the commercial solutions
 
Sightly gimmic-ish: All rules are formulated in an simple DSL and users can add their own if they desire so
 
Supports multiple games that are similar to blackjack
 
  
Questions:
 1) How would you handle layers of menus? Say I have something like this:
 TopMenuOption1 >TopMenuOption2< TopMenuOption3 SubMenuOption1 >SubMenuOption2< SubMenuOption3 SubSubMenuOption1 >SubSubMenuOption2< SubSubMenuOption3 
 Would I then need to check for every "cell" in [TopMenuOption1 .. SubSubMenuOption3] whether it is display of not, according to some global state? Is there a best practice to do this?
 2) How would you handle animation? This is just a nice to have, but at least some fading-in/out would be great.
 3) Assuming that I only develop in the frontend part of the obelisk project, then the dynamic stuff of the web app will happen in the clients' browser, resulting in a very low server load, right?
  
Edit 1: https://buildmedia.readthedocs.org/media/pdf/reflex-frp/latest/reflex-frp.pdf#section.2.1 is a great resource for how to build a reflex app!

 I have two collections of Org files: ~/Documents/life for my Org agenda files, and ~/Documents/org-roam for org-roam files.
 I would like to export all org-roam files to HTML in ~/public_html.
 What I've done so far
 I set up export like this:
  (setq org-publish-project-alist '(("org-roam" :base-directory "~/Documents/org-roam/" :base-extension "org" :publishing-directory "~/public_html/" :recursive t :publishing-function org-html-publish-to-html))) 
 However, when I run org-publish and select the org-roam project, I get the following error in *Messages*:
 org-id-find: not a regular file: ~/Documents/life/data 
 Does anyone have an idea of how I could fix this? ~/Documents/life/data is the org-attach directory for my agenda files, but I don't want to publish this so I have no idea why it's being processed.

Is there a way to check which files tramp mode loaded? Perhaps tramp loaded an out-of-date rc file somewhere that I couldn't find?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I'm learning Scala through a little data project, which is basically requesting many pages to extract the data and save it somewhere after doing some stats using Spark. 
 I did the part where I can extract the data, but the Job that does the batch requests is not working due to the mass 429 error I get. 
 I know that using "thread.sleep" is not good practice, but I don't know how to solve the issue while staying on something not big scale. 
 ​
 Here's what I'm roughly doing:
 This is a basic Class (DataGet - stupid name for now) 
  private val backend = HttpURLConnectionBackend() def getOnMasterNode(url: String): Either[String, String] = { val request = basicRequest.get(uri"$url") val response = request.send(backend) response.body } 
 And this is where I do the batch requests (urls is just an array of String):
  urls.foreach(item => DataGet.getOnMasterNode(BASEURL + item) match { case Left(body) => DataGet.writeDataToFile(body, BASEPATH_MN + "-" + item.split("/").toList.last + day + ".html" ) case Right(_) => LOGGER.error("Error while fetching the data page") }) 
 If someone can oriente me toward some kind of solution that would be helpful.

 I am writing a type checker in Haskell, and I am frequently annoyed by the fact that I can't name a variable as type.
 In Rust, you can append the prefix r# to an identifier (like r#type), but it feels so noisy. Glad I never had to use it in practice.
 That made me curious: how do you guys work around this kind of problem in Haskell?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all, I've been looking for a way to use org-gcal with multiple files. So org-gcal takes org-mode files and syncs scheduled items with your google calendar. But the problems is that it syncs only between 1 file and 1 google account. I have one google account but I scatter my todos inside different files for different projects. What do you think would work the best?
 My current thought is I should create a single file that maybe gets updated every time I update a scheduled item, and sync that single file with my calendar.
 One crux of this solution might be how to copy the todo items and connect back to its source. I’m using org-roam so theoretically I can make store an id to point to the original item without much overhead? 
 Do you see any problems with this approach? Have you done something similar? How would you do something like this? Many thanks.

 Edit
 Strange, I can paste capital umlauts like "Ü", but not "ü".
 What is even more strange: I can copy the text from the Emacs buffer back into another editor, and the umlauts are shown correctly. So it's just a problem showing the characters correctly in the Emacs buffer. The text info is preserved though.

 Where I’m lost though is three major ways. 
 How do I organize the data in terms of structure? Not like from a technical perspective but from an organizational one? I know different people will have different systems, but this is a little too much rope. Can anyone suggest a tutorial that broadly goes over how they structure their “life” (multiple types of todos. Calendar, goals, etc…) in org mode files?
 I’m also a little unclear and how to do something distributed without org mode. Do I manually have to sync files over GitHub? Can I edit my todos on my phone?
 The last major piece is integration with other apps. Can I integrate it tightly with iOS (get Siri to add something to my todo list) or get my stuff to sync with my work place google calendar?
 Thanks!

 and open my test .yml file I obtain nothing except this error:
  Warning (flymake): Disabling backend flymake-proc-legacy-flymake because (error Can’t find a suitable init function) 
 How to fix it? I don't understand why it happens. Also when I tried to setup keybindings for switching between several errors:
  (define-key flymake-mode-map (kbd "M-n") 'flymake-goto-next-error) (define-key flymake-mode-map (kbd "M-p") 'flymake-goto-prev-error) 
 I obtained another error:
 ``` Warning (initialization): An error occurred while loading ‘/home/emilyseville7cfg/.emacs’:
 Symbol's value as variable is void: flymake-mode-map
 To ensure normal operation, you should investigate and remove the cause of the error in your initialization file. Start Emacs with the ‘--debug-init’ option to view a complete error backtrace. ```
 It's strange because documentation provides exactly these Lisp expressions. What am I missing?

Now for my question, I am a data engineer and have been to a couple of jobs where scala developers show this attitude about python as it is some sort of easy shallow langage. I just wanted to understand if this is a general trend in the industry that I must get used to. I get how scala can be smarter and more mathy etc. which is cool but what's with attitude ? Now with python becoming more and more popular, I have a hard time understanding where these people are‍ coming from... just a thought nothing personal

 myList :: Map MyType String
 myList = fromList [

 I resorted to making a backwards list in order to get a key from myList given a value:
 myBkList :: Map String MyType
 myBkList = fromList [
 ("myString1",MyTypeItem1),
 ("myString2",MyTypeItem2)]

 I have the following function that, given a [String] will return the [MyType]
 funcStrMT :: [String] -> [MyType]
 funcStrMT = mapMaybe (flip Data.Map.lookup myBkList)
 ​
 How can I rewrite funcStrMT so that I do not need myBkList? I want to lookup the original myList to find [keys] for [values]. The list will not have duplicate values or duplicate keys.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey y'all! My team at Mercury is hiring a GHC engineer. Our engineering team has around 90 people right now, so we'd increasingly benefit from work on GHC, primarily on compilation performance and IDE support. We already contract out some of this work (big thanks to FPComplete, Well Typed, and Tweag!), and we're interested in developing some in-house talent as well.
 This role would be with our developer user experience team, and would report to me (Matt Parsons).
 These are the criteria we're looking for from applicants:
  
Have experience contributing to GHC (this is a hard requirement)
 Have 3+ years engineering experience
 Be comfortable working independently
 Still care about Mercury as a product
  
Most of our team is remote and working in the US and Canada. We can accomodate other countries if there's some time zone overlap (eg the UK)
 Here's the full job post if you want to take a look: https://mercury.com/jobs/ghc-compiler-engineer
 If you're interested, you can apply at https://boards.greenhouse.io/mercury/jobs/4330398004#app

 I want to declare an abstract base class that requires its descendent classes to implement methods that return their own types.
 So for example:
 ``` abstract class Parent { def +(that: <child_type>): <child_type> }
 case class Child() extends Parent { def +(that: Child): Child = ??? } ```
 Any suggestions?

I am reading through Bernt Hansen's "Organize Your Life in Plain Text!" document which has been extremely helpful. However it appears the document is somewhat outdated
 I'm pretty sure it hasn't been updated since 2015 (judging by the version). The screenshots are outdated. When I add the Lisp code under section 9.1 "Clock setup", then I go to clock in a task with "C-c C-x C-i", I receive the following message in the echo area:
 Symbol’s function definition is void: bh/is-task-p
 Anyways, I am just curious: does anybody know of any documents similar to this one that are more up to date? I am very grateful to Bernt Hansen for creating this document, as it's been an enormous help to me thus far. But I would just like to see if there's any other similar documents that are up to date.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Let's say we have a list of numbers containing 1 billion numbers, what it is time and space complexity of the following code ?
  
​
  list.sliding(1000, 1).map(calcMedian).toList 
  
How would you solve above problem in real life if it were 100 million number streams every second? how distributed computing frameworks like Akka Streams or Apache Storm deals with it efficiently? also how concurrency can be achieved so that latency is lowest ?
 
Where do I find bigO notations for apis like 'Sliding' and others?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a function:
 getData :: DataDef -> TheState [Vars]
 getData dd = dog <- getgetDetails (getName dd) In $ delete (var dd) $ concatMap...
 and a Dictionary:
 myList :: Map String NewType
 myList = fromList [("String1", StringNT1),("String2", StringNT2)]
 The current getDetails function has a String as the first argument (from getName dd). Essentially getName dd creates a String and passes it as the first argument to getDetails.
 What I want to do is check if getName dd is in myList. If it is in my list, then I want the code to execute as it is, but if it is not in myList, I want getData to instead send pass arguments to getDetails2, which will be the same as getDetails but will have NewType as the first argument:
 getDetails2 (getName dd) In $ delete (var dd) $ concatMap..
 What I am looking for is something like this (in partial peudocode):
 ​
 getData :: DataDef -> TheState [Vars]
 getData dd = do
 g <- get
 let ToBeTested = getName dd
 if (myList ! ToBeTested) 
 {
 getDetails2 (myList ! ToBeTested) In $ delete (var dd) $ concatMap...
 } else {
 getDetails (getName dd) In $ delete (var dd) $ concatMap...
 }
 If getName dd is in the list then execute getDetails2 with the NewType value from the key, otherwise execute the original getDetails.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a bit of code that generates random valid (they may not make any sense of course but they should compile) C programs. Unfortunately I have cases where certain expression generation or statement generation rules may fail. I don't really have an elegant way to recover from these failures. I was wondering if anyone would be able to maybe give me some suggestions regarding as to how.
 Here is the start of the module:
 https://pastebin.com/MCqJ4szQ
 Here is a snippet of my code so you may understand what I am talking about:
 https://pastebin.com/iL6VQZDz 
 I would prefer a better solution than to retry on failure (see line 6 of the snippet) . I would also like to generate variables when there are no valid types in the available variables, I know I could use catchError but I do think that is not as elegant as I would like.
 In addition, I do not like how I generate random integers to choose the execution path because then I need to program for the case where the generated integer goes out of bounds (even though it is hard coded to not do this). If you have better solutions, I would really appreciate hearing them.
 Thank you very much!
 Update: I will add more code as soon as I get back to my laptop, I thought the context might have been enough but I was wrong.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm starting to really use emacs for some tasks (org-mode mostly), but one thing confusing me is how eager emacs jumps/kills over words. Say, I have a few lines of code:
  (goto-char beg-line-point) (backward-kill-word 1)) 
 If my cursor is at the beginning of backward-... and I start jumping or killing words backward, what I expect (and have in, say, my VSCode editor) is first jump to beginning of text ((), then to the beginning of line, then to the closing parenthesis on the previous line, then to the end of ...-point (after t) - and only then to before p. But what I get in emacs is it jumps to before p in ...-point immediately on first press.
 Can I somehow reconfigure emacs' word recognition for it to jump words more accurately? Maybe configure word beginning/ending regexp to add symbols/newline to them?

 I am new to emacs.
 I have a simple need in mind and would like to ask if there exists a mode for my requirements.
 ​
 I have a large library of txt files in the range of 1-2 millions (archival stuff).
 What I basically look for is some mode that can do something along the lines of:
 - Internal links that can reference particular paragraphs in other files (in Obsidian called 'link to blocks')
 - Transclusion
 ... and do so with the large number of files; that is to say, not a personal knowledge base, but a solid archival library.
 I have in mind pretty much what Obsidian internal links can do.
 I know there is howm, freex, and org-roam (though I've heard the latter can only handle well personal knowledge base, not a larger archive library).

 Apparently the theme comes with lots of customization options, see here: https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/modus-themes.html

In the following video I show how to create a project, how to call the GitHub API, parse JSON, and create a binary to use our app from the terminal. I do this from Emacs and SLIME, the IDE for CL. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAtwcBh1QLg 
 If you wrote some Elisp, you will notice differences. For example, the REPL is different, more featureful than IELM, that I don't use that much for Elisp. We have an interactive debugger with restarts (actions we can choose, in the video I go to the source file, I re-compile the function, I come back to the debugger and I choose "retry", and the call passes). As a developer we can set our own restarts, of course.
 Some other things I do are: co…]]></summary>

I know org is simple text under the hood, but I'm more curious about a workflow. In other words:
 Does anyone write handwritten notes on a tablet and then convert those to org files? How labor intensive is it? What applications are involved?

 I know there are a lot of options for text expansion, and they each seem to have slightly different preconcepts, encouraging slightly different use.
 Emacs' built in 'skeleton' system has its own 'microsyntax'(?) and is clearly geared to popping in medium- or large-sized structures defined ahead of time, usually where certain fields have to be filled. (I also recall bemoaning how poorly-documented skeletons were, especially online...)
 I know 'yasnippet' is based on the way TextMate did it. I didn't use TextMate, so I'm not sure…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There is a way of viewing Monoid as a one-object Category. I want a Haskell-like name for this Category.
 -- >> Ok "hi" . Ok "!" . Ok "!" -- Ok "hi!!" type Ok :: Type -> Cat () newtype Ok m a b = Ok m 
 A Category of a single object Cat () adds trivial typing to a Monoid, the values are arrows from '() to '(). It is effectively untyped as any two arrows can be composed. 
 instance Monoid m => Category (Ok m) where id :: Ok m a a id = Ok mempty (.) :: Ok m b c -> Ok m a b -> Ok m a c Ok m1 . Ok m2 = Ok (m1 <> m2) -- >> Distance 10 . Distance 20 . id -- Distance 30 type Distance :: Cat () newtype Distance a b = Distance Int deriving Category via Ok (Sum Int) 
 Questions:
  
What would you call the Ok type?
  
I like a variation of Typed to highlight that it takes an untyped Monoid and adjoins dummy types to it.
 Names like AsCategory and MonoidCat presume that it is exclusive to making Monoid a Category. It also lifts Group to Groupoid.
 
Names like OneObject are not very descriptive. And actually nothing prevents Ok from being polymorpic in the object kind
 Ok :: Type -> Cat ob 
 
 
Would you define (>>>) = (<>) or (<<<) = (<>)?
  
The regular composition operator is right-to-left, so choosing (.) = (<>) seems to flip the order.
 
I did a poll with the results
  
14.9% — (>>>) = (<>) 
 12.8% — (<<<) = (<>)
 31.9% — No right answer
 40.4% — Doesn't matter
  
It is easy enough to use Ok (Dual m) or Op (Ok m) to reverse the order but I would like justification of one choice over the other.

I suspect this is either due to undo-tree or flyspell in conjunction with GC set to collect at 1gb, profiler gives me some information but the issue is very hard to reproduce. 
 Is there any way for me to 'save state' such that I can easily reload the same memory, so that I can better hunt down this issue?
 Failing that my current plan is to cut chunks out of my emacs conf, and use xdotool to type junk data in buffers until I can reliably reproduce.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm aware of Emacs rectangle commands. Unfortunately, they all work on a rectangle in bulk. I'm wondering if there are commands - built-in or from an external package - that would allow me to narrow the buffer to a rectangle, or otherwise edit text within the rectangle?
 My immediate use case is text that's effectively a table, like Hydra's "awesome docstring". Taking the first example from the repo README:
 " ^Mark^ ^Unmark^ ^Actions^ ^Search ^^^^^^^^----------------------------------------------------------------- _m_: mark _u_: unmark _x_: execute _R_: re-isearch _s_: save _U_: unmark up _b_: bury _I_: isearch _d_: delete ^ ^ _g_: refresh _O_: multi-occur _D_: delete up ^ ^ _T_: files only: % -28`Buffer-menu-files-only _~_: modified " 
 Say I want to move the save command to be before delete, and I also want to remove mark command. Currently, I have to deal with manually un-reordering and realigning all the other entries to the right of the text I want to manipulate. A better workflow I imagine would be to narrow editing to a rectangle covering the first column of the Hydra docstring, and do my manipulation in that scope, without worrying about text around it. Is there anything available that would support such workflow? Or, what are the recommended alternatives?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The commit make timer_check even more resilient triggers some problem in WSL that results in high CPU usage.
 But it's clearly a problem on the WSL side of things. The behavior vanishes after converting the WSL distribution instance to WSL2.
 The output from profiler-report:
  Samples % Function 4003 69% - command-execute 4003 69% - call-interactively 3996 69% - byte-code 3996 69% - read-extended-command 3996 69% - completing-read 3996 69% - completing-read-default 7 0% - read-from-minibuffer 2 0% - command-execute 1 0% - call-interactively 1 0% funcall-interactively 7 0% + funcall-interactively 1572 27% - timer-event-handler 1572 27% - apply 1572 27% + #<compiled 0x1f688e8844f794b6> 210 3% - ... 206 3% Automatic GC 4 0% + minibuffer-complete 
 I don't need a solution for this, but I've seen a few posts in this subreddit about Emacs in WSL, so perhaps I can save somebody some time chasing this problem.

 I have a question, may be this is very basic for most of you but I have no experience with this so please bear with me. 
 I want to fetch data from .csv and get output that will count the data and group by the count, for example if there are two columns client and job,
 I want an output that will show jobs that are <50, between 50-150 and >50, the csv file does not have column headers just the data, I've done something like this, 
 My csv dataset,
 ​
  
 c1 20 
  
 c2 102 
  c3 50 
  c4 80 
  c5 140 
  c6 2036 
  c7 568 
 
 ​
 I've done something like this,
 import org.apache.spark.sql._ import org.apache.spark.sql.types._ import org.apache.spark.SparkContext object Main { def solution(sc: SparkContext) { val dataLines = sc.textFile("Data/client_jobs.csv") val data = dataLines.map(_.split(";")) case class data(client: STRING, job: INT) } 
 I assumed I have to make a class like this to give columns their names, I don't know of this is correct or not. Thanks in advanced

They are intended for the diary and the calendar, though you can make them show up on the org-mode agenda. I did a quick write up here for anyone interested:
 https://mrincon.net/posts/org-calendar/
 The package is here:
 https://github.com/foxfriday/date-functions
 The package is not refined, and I suspect the uses are pretty limited, but perhaps someone other than me will find it useful. If so I'll try to add more documentation and non U.S. holidays. I was encouraged by the surprising discovery that a few people found the ink.el package useful (thanks).

 I was wondering if someone could help find a fast workflow for org-capture (specifically for save screenshots and text drafts that appear in my head) , I still saving things like images and notes in my telegram, but it really sucks sometimes because I don't want to be dependent on the telegram cloud, so I was wondering about set some keybind in my WM (I use dwm) to capture things.
 Example: I use an app that runs on background and everytime my screenshot folder is updated, it reads and send me a result (it's actually that: https://github.com/kha-white/manga-or)
 Can I do something like that for org capture or in Emacs? For text notes I may set another keybind that opens a template in org-capture and just save the draft)

 Thank you guys =)!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I made an open source library/tool for prototyping Pytorch models with Haskell. The difficulty with designing and implementing PyTorch models is with the dimension mismatch errors e.g. multiplying two matrices AB however the number of columns in A does not match the number of columns in B. The idea is that a developer can write about a dozen lines of code and catch all their mismatch errors.
 I'm posting it here because maybe some of you have an interest in deep learning and Haskell and also because I would like some feedback. I'm relatively inexperienced as a Haskell programmer. Should I make this a cabal package? Any tips for making a cabal package? What kind of documentation would be helpful? Any suggestions on how to make a code generator? What you do you think of the code quality?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello Haskell friends,
 Recently I said this on reddit:
  
There's no way these very frequent reddit and chat requests for learning materials can capture all the existing resources. There are too many, and folks who know where they are get burned out reposting them. There have been many attempts to gather them, https://haskell.org/documentation being the most obvious, but none of them have fully succeeded. We could really do with some more systematic, scalable (crowd-sourced, lightweight) approach.
  
Then I experimented and set up https://haskell-links.org . This is version 1, providing:
  
A searchable read-only view of the Haskell links collected with lambdabot, the popular #haskell IRC bot.
 
A redirector/link shortener/memory aid, for jumping to any of these links via their short ID. Eg: 
 https://haskell-links.org/doc https://haskell-links.org/books https://haskell-links.org/ghc-guide
 
Collected links to other Haskell search tools, making this a fast way to get to anywhere in Haskelldom.
 
 After contemplation and discussion on #haskell, I believe version 2 should allow web editing and use its own database. But I wanted to share this one as it's a nice simple setup. I hope you might find useful ! Help is welcome, see README.
 Best, -Simon

Basically, I want it to behave like the %^{PROMPT| DEFAULT| OPTION1| OPTION2| OPTION3} expander, but where instead of being hard-coded into the capture template, the options are provided by an elisp function that runs when the capture action occurs. I'm aware of ido-completing-read, but I prefer the way the menu of options are presented in the normal org capture process.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Holy cow, I am using orgmode since 2012ish, and just started learning about all the goodies recently. For instance how to quickly filter org-agenda items, for example (in org-agenda view) 
  
hit the key ^ (caret). This'll filter all tasks that belong to the same outline parent item.
 or hit the key \ (backslash) to filter by tag
 and hit | (pipe) to clear the filter
  
There's lots more, see: Filtering/limiting agenda items in https://orgmode.org/manual/Filtering_002flimiting-agenda-items.html
 I f*ing love this tool! Literally makes me enjoy working on my projects!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Does org-mode (and/or org-agenda) offer a date attribute which represents not "you will start the work now" (which is my understanding of SCHEDULED) but instead "you can start the work now" (what I would call DEFERRED)?
 Or can I configure SCHEDULED to behave with "deferred semantics" by customizing a few variables?
 What I mean by "deferred semantics" is mainly a couple things:
 - if I have not yet reached the deferred date, then the task is not yet available to be completed, so I don't want the TODO keyword to show up as an angry alarming bright red, but in a more muted color.
 - I'd like a view that shows only TODO items that are available -- that is, items which are past their deferred date and in a TODO or DOING state -- hiding entirely those items that are completed or deferred for the future.
 In general, with SCHEDULED's current semantics, I feel like it is designed only for an item with a fixed time, like a meeting. But I almost never want to assign a fixed time to a task, since at any point in time I prefer to choose which task to work in the moment, based on a view of the set of possible tasks that are available. 
 For what it's worth, my thinking on this is influenced by the GTD productivity system, which has influenced similar visibility functionality in the OmniFocus app on Apple's platforms.

 All of the functionality seems to be there -- I'm able to produce output, etc. --- but it refuses to fontify.
 When I type "+#begin_src lilypon" everything looks pretty until I put the final "d" in "lilypond", at which point all the styling evaporates, and I get "Org mode fontification error in #<buffer"
 Any other language I've tested (python, ruby, elisp, R) works just fine. The problem seems limited to lilypond.
 The problem disappears when I turn off native fontification, but I kind of like having the fontification.
 Is there any hope for me?

Search Before You Ask
Sometimes, a post will ask one or multiple questions that have been asked here or elsewhere.
It doesn't hurt to do a little search before asking. It saves other people's time from providing answers that have already been given. It also trains your research skill. In addition, it allows you to make more educated questions. Besides, you can't always rely on others to do all your thinking. You'll have to get your hands dirty one day, little star.

 I would like company-mode to work in the buffer running Python shell as well.
 How do I do that?
 Below is my attempt so far. As dabbrev-expand (M-/) works to expand variables and keywords at point in the Python shell, I would expect company-mode to be able to complete with company-dabbrev as a backend but it doesn't work.
 My company-mode config (using use-package):
 (use-package company :ensure t :bind (:map company-active-map ("C-n" . company-select-next) ("C-p" . company-select-previous)) :config (setq company-minimum-prefix-length 3) (setq company-idle-delay 0.0) (setq company-quickhelp-delay 0.0) ;; set default `company-backends' (setq company-backends '((company-files ; files & directory company-keywords ; keywords company-capf) ; completion-at-point-functions (company-abbrev company-dabbrev) )) (global-company-mode t)) 
 EDIT: Got it working with these backends (found in this post, so thanks u/UpInHarms/):
  (setq company-backends '((company-files company-keywords company-capf company-dabbrev-code company-etags company-dabbrev)))

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am having trouble pinpointing an error. When I hit "L" for follow-mode in org-agenda, I see the message " Wrong number of arguments: (0 . 0), 1" in the *Messages* buffer and in the "echo area".
 Now running "edebug-defun" in the function definition for "org-agenda-follow-mode" and stepping through the code, I don't see any error. I am guessing that the error stems from another function, a hook or adviced function. But I don't know where.
 So I checked this: https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Error-Debugging.html
 and tried
 (setq debug-on-message "Wrong number of arguments: (0 . 0), 1") 
 still the debugger is not entered.
 How else can I trigger the debugger to pinpoint the source of the error?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am using counsel-org-goto-all to navigate all my org-file headers, and I am loving it. What I miss is an option to show the TODO keywords along with the item text.
 I looked through the code for said function. It uses 
 counsel-outline-candidates (&optional settings prefix) 
 to get the data.
 But in there, I see no option to show the keywords.
 Anyone can help?
 SOLVED
 Got it. Navigating the code, I found out that this custom variable needs to be set to t to show the TODO keyword:
 (defcustom counsel-org-headline-display-todo nil "If non-nil, display todo keywords in matched `org-mode' headlines." :type 'boolean)

Among issues I experience often are the constant fight with dbus and poor support for resizing windows. Another issue is that when emacs is stuck the session is frozen. Also, no support for dbus-anthy and I need it for Japanese input. I do not have these issues in i3 but at the same time I now understand how nice is have emacs at your fingertips all the time.
 I also use i3 and rofi but the more I use EXWM the more I feel that having two sets of keybindings in i3 for managing the emacs buffers and xorg clients is a pain in the butt. I was thinking that maybe it would be good idea to integrate emacs and i3 by finding a way to implement the following concepts:

 I've recorded a simple macro and I don't want to use it as a named macro. I prefer to use it as a function.
 Is there a way to use the output of last-kbd-macro and create a function I can call interactively?
 I was looking for this on the web and trying to find eval macro functions in Emacs but so far, I wasn't lucky. Maybe there is no possibility and everybody is preferring named macros?

 Over the past few years I've written several low-level bindings: freetype2 (actually on Hackage), libvorbis (still waiting for a review on that one) and libpng (package name for that is free, I've just never submitted anything to Hackage myself).
 There is one massive problem with all of these bindings, expressed as following:
  
Take a look at freetype2-0.2.0#FT_FaceRec. As Storable covers the entire datatype, peek retrieves all of the fields regardless of whether you only use one; poke writes down all the fields, making partial writes impossible.

My name is Erich. I found this forum about a year ago when I came across the concept of Zettelkasten in a YouTube video. I have learned much from entries in this forum, other online sites, and the book entitled, How to Take Smart Notes.
I am not sure why I am so drawn to the Zettelkasten method other than to help me retain and build upon my thinking. I am a Program and Management Analyst within my organization and feel I can also use this capability in research and writing efforts.
I currently use my iPad Pro with iA Writer for my Zettelkasten. So far, I have about 10 notes and my goal is to add a few each week.
My current structure for Permanent notes is:
YYYYMMDDHHMM [UID]
Note Title -
Note body text
Tags: #Name of tag
Links: YYYYMMDDHHMM - Title of note [I hand type the link but do not use the Markdown hyperlink capability. I visit the link by copying and pasting it into the find text feature.]
References: YYYYMMDDHHMMR - Last name
My current structure for Reference notes is:
YYYYMMDDHHMMR [UID - R is added to the end to denote reference]
APA cited reference
Optional high-level notes about the reference text.
I have a Zk_Vault directory with 3 sub-folders including:
Zk_Fleeting - [I use a similar UID naming structure like other notes but add an F to the end of the date-time stamp]
Zk_Permanent
Zk_Reference
Look forward to learning from the group.]]></summary>

 emacs-groundup
 Hi!
 I wanted to introduce emacs-groundup - a config for elisp novices. Here are some of the main highlights:
  
For users looking to 'try emacs', it can be used as-is by setting only a handful of (including zero) parameters.
 For users looking for a task-management workflow, emacs-groundup provides a solid foundation and lots of out-of-the-box functionality.
 The intended user-base is elisp novices 'looking to get serious'. The code is amply commented, and package configurations are as decoupled as possile. Perfect to learn how to write elisp and how to configure some of the more commonly-used packages.
 The system is pre-configured for python and Julia programming only.
 The config uses a customised leuven theme and embraces a colourful aesthetic.
  
Give it a go! All user feedback and contributions are welcome.

 Want to hear advice on how to make this happen. I'm also thinking maybe learn rust and get into backend first and find scala projects later on. I'm planning to make the switch in the next year or two, will market for scala3 better at that time?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have written a program which stores a class of files in a variable, and in trying to create something similar for another class of files I see that the same code can be used if the variables used by the first class are substituted with those of the second class.
 Consider the code below
 (setq org-sql-files-plist (plist-put org-sql-files-plist task-kwd `(:file_path ,full-filename :filename ,orgfile :dirpath ,(file-name-directory orgfile) :category ,(rc/org-global-prop-value "TASK_GROUP") :title ,(rc/org-global-prop-value "TITLE") :description ,(rc/org-global-prop-value "TASK_DESC") :task_id ,task-id :parent_file ,(rc/org-global-prop-value "PARENT_FILE") :date_added ,date-added) )) 
 Say I need to substitute org-sql-files-plist with org-python-files-plist, but instead of using org-python-files-plist in the code I use (somelist "python-files-list") where (somelist "python-files-list") is set to org-python-files-plist, ie not the value of the variable but the variable itself.
 It is something like passing variables or pointers to variables in procedural languages.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Could I please get (no pun intended) a simple explanation of <- get? I see this syntax frequently but it is not clear to me as a novice Haskell user. 
 For example in the following code fragment:
 inputFunc :: State Details
 inputFunc = do
 g <- get
 let ifDetails False = ""
 ifDetails _ = "the details"
 return $ ifDetails $ "myString" 'elem' detList g
 ​
 data SecondState = sedondState { 
 detList :: [String]
 }
 If my understanding is correct, inputFunc has no input types and returns a type of State Details.
 <- get does something and sets the output to g?
 The function then returns a blank String "" if "myString" is not an element of g (a String array?), otherwise it returns the String "the detail" if indeed "myString" is an element of g.
 Please correct me if my understanding is wrong. 
 The outstanding question I have is what does "<- get" get? Where does it get it from? And does it set g to this output like = in imperative languages?
 Please help.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In org-agenda, when I apply tags to items, the item text (even if it’s just five words) gets a line break after two words or so.
 As you can see in the attached image, the item with the text "Org Party Einschulung" with the tag ":pauli:" gets wrapped, but only after I applied the tag.
 What do I need to change / investigate to fix this?
 https://preview.redd.it/dn83z036ynz81.png?width=750&format=png&auto=webp&s=4d50a88a1368bef752a654269f785c926a07f241
 This is my org-agenda-prefix-format, in case it matters:
 (setq org-agenda-prefix-format '((agenda . "%-12:c%-12t% s") (todo . "%-12:c") (tags . "%-12:c") (search . "%-16:c"))) 
 Edit
 Started emacs with option "-Q" from command line: emacs -Q
 Then ran these lines:
 (setq org-directory "/Users/pragmat1c1/Dropbox/org") (setq org-agenda-files (directory-files-recursively org-directory "\\.org$")) (find-file (concat org-directory "/agenda/" "planner.org")) 
 Next, I opened agenda: "M-x org-agenda RET a"
 I can see that indeed lines get wrapped when "visual-line-mode" is turned on. Otherwise no wrap and and arrow on the right of the tag (when I am resizing frame and make it smaller).
 My findings
 Apparently in my setup 
  
visual-line-mode is turned on
 the items do not get enough width so that they get wrapped when a tag is added to an item
  
Question: Where is the line width for the items defined? How can I increase that?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hiya!
 I've been using doom emacs for a while now and have been mostly happy with it. I've got a bit of spare time now, and have been trying to put together an emacs config from scratch. Not sure if I'm ultimately going to stick with this config or go back to doom for regular work, but I figure it'll at least be a good learning experience.
 Anyways, I've run into some baffling behavior with the general package for key binding. Specifically, once I set a new leader key, it acts in a "sticky" manner eternally. So if I rebind C-SPC as a leader and "C-SPC h" to help-command, it works in that "C-SPC h" works like "C-h". However, any time I use this, it disables the "h" key for the rest of the session. Whenever I type "h" alone, it behaves as though I pressed "C-SPC h". Same with spacebar. In a fresh session, both keys will work normally until I use them once with the leader. After that, the keys are broken until I restart emacs.
 Does anyone have any idea why this is happening and what should be done to correct it? Here's the relevant part of my init.el. Also, please ignore the specific rebindings; this is just an experiment to see what can be done with general and to figure out how it works.
  (global-unset-key (kbd "C-SPC")) (use-package general :config (general-create-definer krm/global-leader :global-prefix "C-SPC") (krm/global-leader "h" 'help-command "SPC" 'set-mark-command))

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[SOLVED!: reinstalled using this tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZEgtWfi_3wI don't really have much info this is the error: server rls:14068/starting exited with status exit(check corresponding stderr buffer for details). Do you want to restart it? (y or n)
 Also i have gentoo's rust-bin and the rust toolchain installed at the same time could this be the source of the problem?
 EDIT: Forgot to install rust analyzer It still doesen't work it says:
 (Rust Flymake:wait[0 0] Lens LSP[rust-analyzer:27750] WK ElDoc)
 okay so i just change to a rustic config: https://robert.kra.hn/posts/rust-emacs-setup/
 Now i am having a different issue which i've solved on my previous install but i forgot how i did it:
 LSP :: rust-analyzer failed to load workspace: Failed to find sysroot for Cargo.toml dile /home/<user>/projects/programming/rust/tui-rs/Cargo.toml. Is rust-src installed?: can't load standard library from sysroot
 /use/lib/rust/1.60.0
 (discovered via 'rustc --print sysroot')
 try installing rust source the same way you installed rustc

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, everyone!
 I've uploaded packages for Emacs 28.1 to my PPA. Thank you very much to everyone who's filed issues against the GitHub repository (or reached out via email). It's wonderful to know that folks appreciate this effort, and I love being able to give something back to the community.
 Now: on to the good stuff!
 Packages are available for 18.04 LTS ("bionic"), 20.04 LTS ("focal"), 21.10 ("impish"), and 22.04 LTS ("jammy").
 Emacs 28 deprecates Xft and encourages using Cairo/HarfBuzz for font rendering; this build configuration is the one that my Emacs 27 packages were already using, so there should not be any changes there.
 The big new feature in Emacs 28 is native compilation, and as you might expect, these packages enable that feature. The only exceptions are the packages for 18.04 LTS ("bionic"); libgccjit packages aren't available for the version of GCC that ships with 18.04 LTS.
 The only packaging-related update I have to share is that the master branch of the packaging repository now has a README with release notes. I'm going to try to move more notes about the packaging process there over time.
 Enjoy, and please let me know if you have any trouble.

 Hi all,
 This isn't meant to be a "war" thread. I use TW a fair amount currently, and despite having used Emacs for (literally) decades* I've never gotten around to learning org-mode. And now I need to pick a solution.
 I am a MSCS student about to start the serious work on a thesis (vs. just planning it while I focused on coursework). I need a tool I can keep notes, references, etc. with. BUT! I also need to be able to use it on my iPad-- I'm going to be traveling most of June and part of July, and for (various) reasons I won't be bringing my laptop with me.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have been struggling with getting gRPC to work. As a step I tried to follow along with the official tutorial for client side (in Go, as my clients will be that - though it doesn't matter) and try matching server side with Haskell. So, for now I have this proto file (it might be important that eventually, I will need to use proto3):
 // The greeting service definition. service Greeter { // Sends a greeting rpc SayHello (HelloRequest) returns (HelloReply) {} } // The request message containing the user's name. message HelloRequest { string name = 1; } // The response message containing the greetings message HelloReply { string message = 1; } 
 Using proto-lens I can generate nice lenses for HelloRequest and HelloReply by following this. However, it is not useful much. I would have to write a lot of boiler-plate for implementing SayHello.
 Therefore, my next best bet was proto3-suite (is that the right one?) Generating the code works nicely:
 stack exec -- compile-proto-file --proto proto/helloworld.proto --out lib 
 Which will give me a very promising Proto.Helloworld with data Greeter = ..., but I simply cannot use it (with stack)..
 It seems that that repo is maybe outdated as the resolver is fairly old, and regardless there are always version conflicts.
 What is the way to go for gRPC with Haskell nowadays? Can someone point me to a code base that is using stack with working builds?

 In the first case, I find this a little awkward. I do an rgrep, hit enter on each entry, make a change, etc etc. This is very slow, and can result in buffers getting left open. What I'd love to do is have rgrep behave something like occur mode's (M-s o) occur-edit-mode (accessed from an occur buffer with e). 
 Is something like that available in grep results? How do you use rgrep more effectively?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[From what I can tell, FRP is very much analogous to imperative loops.
 But that's also what the streaming libraries do - they too are analogous to imperative loops.
 So why not just use a streaming library? Why bother with a separate FRP library (Reflex, ReactiveBanana, etc.)?

 i never regretted, how much time i wasted with other tooling
 i never commited so much into one program, except starcraft, cs and lol ;)
 i regretted to not have a closer look at it, when searching for vim vs emacs and most people would recommend vim to me. i do not regret using some vim, but i regret not to have closer looked at emacs.
  
Emacs is like an interesting person you get to know and each time you are thrilled to know that person more and more.
 What was different or how did emacs change you?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I am looking for ways to read a book or paper and record my interactions with it. I am phrasing it like this because I don't want to limit ideas too soon and I don't really know the words to describe it more precisely.
 The goal is to not only read a document but to make its information more accessible by - for example - highlighting and linking internally and annotating (thoughts) . But I also stumbled upon concepts like transclusion in emacs. This would allow workflows where the document is included into the annotations, instead of the other way round. 
 So my question is: Do you have a work flow to share that enables you to interact wit documents and record those interactions with the help of emacs?
 Some of my documents are in pdf format, others I have converted to org format.

 Why can't you directly do the latter? I noticed it works even without requiring the package. 
 I see that any installed package can be activated in a buffer through M-x without requiring it or you can put this in init.el. What is the point of requiring a package? I thought it's similar to import module in python, but it doesn't seem to be. Importing is all that is required in python, no activating.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone, orgmode has a new org-capture option, :refile-targets. Its description: Temporarily set ‘org-refile-targets’ to the value of this property (link). I would like to take advantage of this new option so I can have different org capture templates refile to different files, but just can’t get it working. I normally set my org-refile-targets as such:
 (setq org-refile-targets '(("~/Dropbox/org/work.org" :maxlevel . 2))) 
 This works fine. So I tried to do the same in my org-capture templates. Here’s an example:
 ("n" "CPB Note" entry (file+headline "~/Dropbox/org/cpb.org" "Refile") "** Note: %? @ %U" :empty-lines 0 :refile-targets '((("~/Dropbox/org/work.org" :maxlevel . 2)))) 
 With this I get the error, “org-refile-get-location: Wrong type argument: listp, quote”. So I tried this next: (list ("~/Dropbox/org/work.org" :maxlevel . 2)). Now the error is “org-refile-get-location: Wrong type argument: listp, list.”
 I have a decent understanding of elisp but clearly I’m missing something here. I can’t find anyone else using the :refile-targets option so my Google/Github searching has not been of much use. Hope someone here has a better idea. Thank you!

 I know that I have the font right because I can change the font and run M-x eval-buffer and the font size changes, and scroll bar, menu and tooltips are all disabled.
 The package archive reloading doesn't happen at least I think.
 I was under the impression that there will be lines in *Messages* saying the packages that are reloaded but I don't see them. 
 below is my init.el file. please let me know if something is wrong, because after 5 times through, I don't see anything.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have the following anti-pattern in my code:
 existsFunc :: Maybe Item -> Item 
 This is part of a larger piece of code that checks if a name is in a Dictionary:
 genFunc :: InputType -> Item genFunc input = existsFunc(Data.Map.lookup input (myDictionary)) existsFunc :: Maybe Item -> Item existsFunc (Just x) = x existsFunc Nothing = error "input missing from dictionary" 
 I would like to replace the above anti-pattern with with ! Map operator, but am having trouble understanding the syntax. How can the ! be applied?
 genFunc :: InputType -> Item genFunc input = ! Data.Map.lookup input (myDictionary) Error: element not in the map genFunc input = Data.Map.lookup input (myDictionary) 
 I also thought that it could be applied in the following way:
 genFunc :: InputType -> Item genFunc input = Data.Map.lookup input (myDictionary) ! input Error: element not in the map genFunc input = Data.Map.lookup input (myDictionary)

 I have been working with SuperRare Labs for more than a year and they are looking to grow the team!
 I know the feelings of the community about NFTs and Blockchains. Those arguments have been said (and said better!) on other threads on this subreddit. Still, I think there are neat pieces of technology on our backend and we have a good work environment where we can do some neat engineering.
 SuperRare Labs is a US based company with US level compensation, fully remote (I am Chilean and I feel in the loop). Technology wise we are into Haskell, GraphQL (template haskell interop), extensible-records, Postgresql and hs-web3. If any of those technologies interest you, please send a message at the forms at greenhouse, in particular on the backend engineer role. Also, send me a DM so we can chat, answer your questions and/or see ways to speed up the process.

I'm looking mostly for experience, so money is not a big issue (as long as I can survive on it). I would appreciate any tips of where to look for the internships and if you know about any/work for companies that offer them I would greatly appreciate any links/contact informations. I can provide my cv and linked in if that would help. Thanks in advance ;)

Adding custom classes to org mode is documented in several places: https://rgoswami.me/posts/org-arb-tex/#latex-classes However, all that I see require more work than just saying "please use template.cls for export." The template I have to work with is over 700 lines long, and to either manually translate it to a format such as https://rgoswami.me/posts/org-arb-tex/#latex-classes or create a new program to do the conversion, is likely to cause inconsistencies or bugs. At least in the time span that I have available right now.
 Is there a way to tell org mode to just use a specific .cls file during latex export?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, 
 I use use-package to install org. This obviously happens when init.el is run for the first time. On this first run, even after a newer version of org has been installed, emacs continues to use the old version of org packaged with emacs (from the second run onwards the newer version is used).
 Is there any way to re-load org during that first run? It ends up causing errors and warning during org-roam installation as some of the functions introduced in newer versions of org (org-roam dependencies) do not load. 
 I have found this, but it seems like a very ugly solution! Any suggestions how this can be better dealt with? 
 Cheers

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[IHaskell is super great, especially when run using a notebook in VSCode. However, I've encountered a couple of bugs, and wondered if people had seen the same and/or knew how to fix them:
  
If I try to use diagrams with IHaskell, and use diagram to display a diagram, as shown below, the notebook crashes. ```haskell :extension NoMonomorphismRestriction FlexibleContexts TypeFamilies import Diagrams.Prelude import IHaskell.Display.Diagrams import Diagrams.Backend.Cairo
  
diagram $ eqTriangle 1 ```
 Is anyone else able to display diagrams in a Haskell notebook?
  
I'm using hvega to plot things, but the plots only show when the notebook is viewed in VSCode. On a browser, or in html, I don't see the plots. Is this a problem other people have had?
  
If both of these were fixed, I could use Haskell to make pretty notebooks, with diagrams and plots, as documentation and tutorial material, which is something I'm keen to do.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, I recently realized that the git pre-commit hook does not ensure that only the chunks in the index are part of the worktree when the pre-commit hook runs. Hence, I set out and add some git stashing to my pre-commit hook to fix that myself.
 This is what I ended up with after some google-fu:
 ```sh
 #!/bin/sh # First, stash index and work dir, keeping only the # to-be-committed changes in the working directory. old_stash=$(git rev-parse -q --verify refs/stash) git stash push -q --keep-index --include-untracked new_stash=$(git rev-parse -q --verify refs/stash) # If there were no changes (e.g., `--amend` or `--allow-empty`) # then nothing was stashed, and we should skip everything, # including the tests themselves. (Presumably the tests passed # on the previous commit, so there is no need to re-run them.) if [ "$old_stash" = "$new_stash" ]; then echo "pre-commit script: no changes to test" exit 0 fi # Run lints/checks/tests/... script/check st=$? echo "got status $st" # Restore changes git reset --hard -q git stash pop --index -q # Exit with status from test-run: nonzero prevents commit exit $st 
 ```
 Now, this works fine when I use it from the git-command line, however, I run into trouble when I commit via magit. It fails with the following error:
 ```

 Anyone have any idea what is causing the difference between git-cli and magit here?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've recently needed to make a minibuffer completion with annotations. The manual says you need to set completion-extra-properties, and I was able to make annotations, my :annotation-function looks something like this:
 (defun my-annotation-fn (s) (let-alist (cdr (assoc s minibuffer-completion-table)) (concat " " .version " " .description))) 
 Now, this works, but the annotations do not show up aligned (because every column in each row is delimited by fixed number of spaces), and that doesn't look very clean.
 Of course, it is possible to calculate the exact number of required spaces for every column in each row, even though it would slightly sophisticate the annotation-function.
 Another alternative (I think) is to extend the prompt for Marginalia and let it do its magic. But then it would only work for those who use Marginalia package. 
 So my question is, is there a convention or a simpler method of aligning the annotations?

 Are they preparing for that? I believe that dropping it will result in a far more number of potential people and human work for Emacs' development.
 Personally, although I have already signed it as student, I'm not so sure in the future when being employed cause there's a term: contact us when you change your employer.
 Side note: I signed it to propose apply-right-partially, the function was rejected in favor of explicit lambdas. A bit sad at first, then I realized its usage may lead to breakages later: what about when the applied FUN's parameters have optional arguments added to the right? I still hope for Clojure-like's short sweet anonymous function, or at least Scheme's cut.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I am asking myself if there is a simple way to parse and evaluate a domain specific language, that is error free after type-checking. My Idea is to use Haskell-Functions and Variables to have less work and reduce errors. 
 ​
 I've read about tagless interpreters but I find it hard to convert a string into such an expression and I only saw that here: https://okmij.org/ftp/tagless-final/TypeCheck.hs
 ​
 That is quite old, so maybe there is a better way of doing it or a library, that is useful for that.
 ​
 I've also read Stitch from Richard A. Eisenberg https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3406088.3409015
 and I liked it very much. In this approach there is also a lot of work to do.
 ​
 I've found very short ways of evaluating typed ASTs here: https://gergo.erdi.hu/blog/2015-02-05-typed_embedding_of_stlc_into_haskell/ and here: https://github.com/shayan-najd/MiniFeldspar/blob/master/Philip/GADT.hs . But there is still a lot working in the conversion from simple ASTs or Strings to these expressions.
 ​
 Is there a even better and simpler way to do that, if the goal is to let Haskell to a lot of work and focus on features that I want to include in my language.
 ​
 Thank you very much for your answers.

Better executable path queries in GHC 9.4 by Fraser Tweedale
I previously wrote about System.Environment.getExecutablePath and how I fixed it on FreeBSD. Unfortunately, this function still has some problems. In this post I explain the problems and introduce executablePath, the solution arriving in base-4.17.0.0 (GHC 9.4.1).
Existential optics by Marco Perone
In this post, I present a way of encoding optics that is different from usual. This encoding, called existential optics, is easier to understand than the other encodings, since it makes more explicit the structure of each optic.
