        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Vacation ends tomorrow and so the time for my summer project. This summer I decided to learn a bit of music / guitar theory as I've played guitar for some time but never learned any theory. Ended up making a small web app that can display chords, scales, modes and chord progressions. The app can generate questions and answers in an Org drill (a mode for Emacs) format. Feedback is much appreciated! <3

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I compile an el file, I sometimes don't see all the possible "undefined" warnings because they depend on the currently loaded packages in my emacs session. For example, if the file depends on the package org, some warnings would not show if org was loaded when I opened an org file before or if org is loaded by default in my init file.
 How do I make sure that compilation always happens in a "clean environment" where no packages are loaded? Running with emacs -Q would not work since custom packages can never be loaded, for example with eval-when-compile (unless I set up the load-path which is difficult since it is set by straight in my case).
 Also, would the compilation result be the same whether these required packages (like org in my example) are loaded or not? In other words, is it safe to ignore these warnings?

 I have an org capture template set up where I am prompted to enter a date/time in the minibuffer.
 This works okay, and I'm able to navigate around for the date by using Shift-L, etc. But when I select the date by pressing enter, the capture template is then "done", and I can't edit the date except after the fact, when the template is all filled in.
 How does one edit the time at this point, before it gets inserted into the template?
 Thanks for any help!

 I get an initial error that workspace isn't found, but this goes away after a few seconds loading. Then any time I run a command with rustic it complains I don't have cargo, but I can run all cargo commands fine in command line, or using M-x cargo-run etc.
 Also when I try to use any snippet, it says company-capf cant use yasnippet. Setting the yas global mode does not fix this either. 
 So all in all, my attempts to use rust in emacs have been pretty horrible. Is this tutorial just very out of date, or is there a better example setup I could be looking at?

I ask because I work a lot with articles and academic papers, so I fear I'd lose pieces of information that may be useful in the future (but not in the present, so they don't go into my Zettelkasten).

I have DevonThink that is great, but I always encounter lot of friction when I store the files in it.
Any help and experience would be highly appreciated.

With other words, I would like to be able to type code that will go into functions one piece at a time, scattered in prose. Does anyone know if this is possible with org mode and how?
 If anyone is familiar with Knuth's literal programming system, one can add named statements to code blocks with "+=" syntax. As an illustration, here is a piece of code from Pharr & Humphrey Physically Based Rendering which is written in literal programming style (the one where I have seen this system in use, but there are probably others):
 <Function Definitions> ≡ void InitGlobals() { <Initialize Global Variables 2> } 
 Fragment "initialize global variables":
 <Initialize Global Variables> ≡ shoe_size = 13; 
 Add to the fragment:
 <Initialize Global Variables> +≡ dielectric = true; 
 Results with:
 void InitGlobals() { shoe_size = 13; dielectric = true; } 
 Edit: Ok, thank you all for pointing me to noweb. Didn't used it before and didn't know what it was, but it seems like exactly what I am asking for :).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I have (macos):
  
emacs keys, not evil
 caps lock mapped to control
 left option as meta
 left command as super (not sure if I should change this to meta yet)
 right command mapped as F7
  
This looks somewhat sane and I can easily bind the menu key in other keyboards to F7 (or other F key) as well. 
 F7 is a prefix key and I’m using it as something similar to general.el as in “<f7>w” opens a prefix for my windows commands for example (like SPC w in doom or whatever).
 I wanted to map right command to hyper but that does not play nice with macos terminals.
 This is looking very nice to me, I honestly was not fully aware I could achieve this as I’m somewhat a beginner.
 I was using a lot of chords too but I reduced their usage due to some conflicts. They are still pretty awesome to have though (a quick “tt” opens vterm-toggle for example).
 Does this look sane to you guys? Is it too good to be true?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For some reason, a few months ago the line spacing in Org Mode has increased. It's the line spacing between display lines, not merely between paragraphs or headings. The line spacing in my org-mode files has increased to 1.5 or 2 (just guessing).
 The variable "line-spacing" is nil. Actually setting it doesn't help.
 If I open a non-org-mode text file in emacs, the line spacing is fine.
 I discovered that the issue comes from org-indent-mode. But I also don't know why org-indent-mode would cause this. Does anyone have any ideas of what setting I can change?
 UPDATE: I was able to fix this by following the solution at the link provided below by JDRiverRun.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My first language is not English and so my keyboard layout is not the US layout. In many international layouts, the right Alt is AltGr and does not work as a Meta key. I like this keyboard layout otherwise.
 Ideally, I would like to not have to move my hands away from the home row, but having only the left Alt available as Meta and reaching for AltGr (right Alt) from time to time breaks my flow.
 I tried switching CapsLock with AltGr and this would be the ideal layout. Using xmodmap, I think I was able to do it, but I could not understand what I did satisfactorily even after reading the doc. I don't like using tools that I cannot understand.
 Also something does not feel right about having a "non standard" keyboard layout. I don't want to make my life harder if I use another computer or OS. Do you have an opinion on that?
 What is your personal setup?

However, often enough to have made "undo" a part of my muscle memory after using those, it seems to be behaving like ace-jump-zap-to-char by cutting everything in between. I use the zap command, but I am not confusing it with the other two here.
 This has been going on for a while (at least through three iterations of my OS), but I am finally getting around to reporting it. Note that the ace-jump libraries haven't been changed for 8 years, so lib issues can't be a problem. Unless there is more recommended alternative https://github.com/winterTTr/ace-jump-mode ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to use this library in my haskell program to generate a source map file, but getting some performance issue. The size of the mapping file generated was about 30M bytes, and it took almost 130 secs to get it. It's much more slower than I expected, though I can not figure out what's the problem causing it. Here's my code looks like:
 ​
 generateSrcMap :: String -> [FilePath] -> SourceRange -> Value generateSrcMap sFile srcs sourceRanges = generate $ SourceMapping { smFile = sFile, smSources = srcs, smSourceRoot = Nothing, smMappings = mappings } where mappings = mapMaybe getMapping $ zip sourceRanges [0 ..] getMapping :: (SourceRange, Int) -> Maybe Mapping getMapping (SourceRange start _ _, idx) = if srcFile == "std" then Nothing -- skip mapping stdlib code else Just $ Mapping { mapGenerated = Pos 1 $ fromInteger $ toInteger idx, -- business logic, use index as column mapOriginal = Just (Pos line column), mapSourceFile = Just srcFile, mapName = Nothing } where !srcFile = sourceName start !line = fromInteger $ toInteger (1 + unPos (sourceLine start)) !column = fromInteger $ toInteger $ unPos $ sourceColumn start 
 ​
 Also I tried using this rust library to run decode/encode the same source map json file. It turns out to be much fast than the Haskell code I wrote. It took ~14 secs for decoding and ~3 secs for encoding. So any suggestions?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm migrating from Company to Corfu to try its integration with Orderless. I want to replace M-i, my "invoke company manually" key binding, with a trigger for Corfu.
 But I couldn't find a built-in function to invoke Corfu. It's usually triggered by TAB, but I prefer TAB to indent and never complete at the moment.
 I whipped up this hack by looking at how Corfu's UI is being triggered:
 (defun ct/corfu-trigger () (interactive) (corfu--auto-complete (corfu--auto-tick))) (global-set-key (kbd "M-i") #'ct/corfu-trigger) 
 It injects the auto tick so the internal equal check passes.
 I tried to bind to completion-at-point but even though that's what the TAB key (with the suggested configuration) is eventually calling, my bindings spawned the completions in the minibuffer instead of going through Corfu.
 What's a more elegant way?

 Aquamacs apparently seems to have all this fixed and tailored for the Mac while giving you the option to customize things to perhaps even Spacemacs like experience - most of Spacemacs is really just packages setup to work nicely together.
 Also, Aquamacs people say that they even plan a separate Apple Silicon version (M1,M2) of Aquamacs (= better performance and longer battery) which is probably never gonna happen with the regular GNU Emacs. Or maybe I am wrong?
 BUT... maybe... there are some cons? And perhaps some are a dealbreaker preventing me to migrate from Emacs/Spacemacs to Aquamacs?
 For people who have used Aquamacs, what has been your experience? What are are pros and cons against a regular Emacs? Were there any dealbreakers?
 Also, how is it running Aquamacs and regular Emacs (with Spacemacs) on the same computer/user account? Will they play along nicely and don't mess things up, or they will be rewriting each others' configs all the time?
 UPDATE:
 I am using Evil mode, and also a leader SPC key so I basically don't use traditional Command bound Emacs keybindings.
 This seems to be a frequent "con" by people coming from vanilla Emacs when I try to find some cons of Aquamacs via Google - but in my case, that is not an issue.
 I am more worried about the compatibility of packages and code of Emacs Lisp scripts I will find on the Internet and whether it will run or not.
 Also, are there any weird hidden you-might-notice-them-only-after-a-few-months quirks that Aquamacs has when compared with vanilla Emacs?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[(:warning ("long post")) 
 GNU Emacs is a wholly remarkable existence. It is not only ancient, but sharp: a wise master that has seen others fall and learned from their mistakes. It exists as a sort of second user land, integrating the underlying OS's built in libraries and utilities into a rich-text interface powered by thousands of lines of tried and true lisp code.
 Microsoft Windows is also a wholly remarkable existence. It, too, has quite the history; yet the Windows OS itself (and DOS before it) has largely served as a mcguffin in its own tale. Indeed, the rise of Microsoft and the personal computer seem to have taken place in spite of their OS's glaring deficiencies rather than because of any particular merit. And still, somehow, Windows 10 is ... Dare I say ... Kinda good? The move…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been possess this issue ever since I switched to emacs28 with native comp. If I try to open a file directly in the terminal version of emacs (e.g. emacs -nw filename), emacs won't open the file -- instead I get an error message saying: Symbol’s value as variable is void: \213, and a blank buffer. As far as I can tell, emacs works normally after that, and I can open the file with C-x C-f but it's a bit of an annoyance. The --debug-init option gives no additional output. This only happens with the -nw option. The gui works normally. Anybody know what's going on here? PS: I'm on MacOS and using the emacs-plus distribution from Homebrew. EDIT: After some investigation it turns out the following code inside my init.el file was the issue: (defvar startup/file-name-handler-alist file-name-handler-alist) (setq file-name-handler-alist nil) (defun startup/revert-file-name-handler-alist () (setq file-name-handler-alist startup/file-name-handler-alist)) (add-hook 'emacs-startup-hook 'startup/revert-file-name-handler-alist) Anybody know why this‏‏‎‏‏‎‏‏‎‏‏‎­would cause the error on emacs28?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Background: I maintain org-gcal, a package that lets users synchronize Google Calendar events with Org-mode files. One of the features that I have is a way to download the event description as HTML. Right now, I just download the raw HTML and place it in a drawer.
 I'd like to have the ability to wrap this HTML in some kind of block and preview it as Org-mode syntax, so that it's easier to read it in Emacs. I'm thinking of wrapping the text in a #+BEGIN_SRC html block (or maybe a custom block), calling out to Pandoc to convert the HTML to Org, and overlaying the Org-mode syntax to replace the HTML block (like org-display-inline-images, org-preview-html but with Org syntax instead of an image, graphviz-dot-mode, etc.
 I'd like a solution that preserves the original HTML, because org-gcal supports updating Google Calendar events based on the Org-mode file.
 Does anyone know of a library like this?

 If my case class is in the same file as my implicit conversions everything works fine. However I’d like to be able to reference case classes all over the place and use my implicit conversions but I keep getting errors related to implicits not being found. 
 To be a bit more concrete my implicits are in an object in the package 
 Root.sub1o
 When the case class is in the package Root.sub1a.sub2a.sub3a.sub4a.sub5a everything works fine!
 When the case class is in the package 
 Root.sub1a.sub2b.sub3b.sub4b.sub5b however I get errors about my implicits being out of scope. This seems kind of baffling to me but I’m sure I’m missing something obvious / fundamental

 I tried re-running the all-the-icons-install-fonts command, and according to Emacs it runs successfully. I also see the following under $HOME/.local/share/fonts:
  all-the-icons.ttf et-book-display-italic-old-style-figures.ttf et-book-roman-old-style-figures.ttf file-icons.ttf material-design-icons.ttf weathericons.ttf et-book-bold-line-figures.ttf et-book-roman-line-figures.ttf et-book-semi-bold-old-style-figures.ttf fontawesome.ttf octicons.ttf 
 Also, Emacs no longer seems to be able to find any of the fonts under $HOME/.local/share/fonts. For example, ETBembo used to be my primary, non-coding font, but Emacs can no longer find that either.
 I've also run 'fc-cache -f -v` about 100 times :-)
 I tried some of the troubleshooting steps on https://github.com/domtronn/all-the-icons.el but those instructions seem to address issues with individual icons. I can't see any icons.

The exporter generated an error which told me I need to load the ulem package. I loaded the ulem LaTeX package an now the underlined words appear fine in the PDF. What I noticed however is that text marked with italic is also exported underlined. Why is that happening? Italic text should be italic not underlined.

 sorry for the newbie quetion, I thought I got this but clearly I was wrong. So basically I want to modify a previous commit in my repo (by adding some modifications I already have in my workspace). Following a suggestion from Magit's author (here https://emacs.stackexchange.com/a/22565/29817), Magit seems to have a command that should work pretty well for me: `magit-rebase-edit-commit`, bound by default to `r m`. Point is, when I do that, I see the buffer you see in the picture. If I need to add some lines to this commit, what should I do, since there's no "Unstaged files" section?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The `template-haskell` library has an enormous library of "lower-case" monadic helpers, things like this: https://hackage.haskell.org/package/template-haskell-2.18.0.0/docs/Language-Haskell-TH-Lib.html#v:appE 
 These are just the normal algebraic data types and functions lifted to work on monadic arguements. But... why? We don't do this for any other monad, and modern Haskellers are perfectly comfortable writing `AppE <$> x <*> y` rather than `appE x y`. And it's quite expensive - you have a huge module that duplicates every single function in this form, and it leads to downstream confusion as people use the two styles inconsistently.
 I think the reason for this existing may just be historical: this style was introduced in the TH paper in 2002, and applicatives weren't popularised until 2008. But they very much are popular now, so maybe we should deprecate it all and stop adding to it?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone.
 I am currently trying to do the following: only get headings that are the next actions to be taken. A concrete example: 
 * TODO Project ** TODO Task one, the next action that I want to see ** TODO Task two, but after the task one, not the next action 
 ​
 As you can see here, the next action is the task one.
 A slightly more complicated example: 
 * Project ** TODO Not next action *** TODO Next action *** TODO Not next action ** TODO Not next action * Another Project ** DONE Task one ** TODO Another next action 
 ​
 I managed to make a function with "org-agenda-skip-function" which allows me to find its famous next action. But how to do it with org-ql ? Is there a possibility to "translate" this function into an org-ql query ?I'm also thinking of creating a new predicate, "brother-up", which would return true if the heading has a heading of the same level before it
 So maybe I could find the next action by taking the following headings:
  
no task in done
 no descendant
 no "brother up" not done
  
I'm a bit lost, because I don't even know if it would work, and if I have thought about everything. I don't know exactly in which direction to go, because there is maybe an another better solution that I didn't think of.
 Thanks in advance for your answers :)

 I see the keycode f21 when I press it in Karabiner EventViewer as you can see here: https://i.imgur.com/ELylaKn.png
 I have tried f22 as well. Doesn't work.
 In Emacs I cannot make it run, e.g. this doesn't work:
  (global-set-key (kbd "<f21> t") (lambda () (interactive) (find-file "~/Documents/test.txt"))) 
 But this does work:
  (global-set-key (kbd "<f15> t") (lambda () (interactive) (find-file "~/Documents/test.txt"))) 
 Also, the f20 triggers C-p or something but that is some Menu key issue with macOS so I will just don't use that like that.
 But I would really like to use f21 - f24 or even higher as I am planning to purchasing X-keys programmable keypad and would like to use it with Emacs.
 Thanks for any advice how to make the function keys about 20 work in Emacs on macOS.
 UPDATE:
 I made this video where on the right you can see Karabiner EventViewer showing the key code f21 when Emacs shows nothing. At the end I included the log of pressed keys (C-h l) as well:

 Recent emacs convert here, I'm using emacs with org-mode / org-roam for documentary filmmaking and freelance video work. Still working on a better workflow than what I have currently 
 I was wondering if someone has tried to integrate Emacs with their stream deck ? 
 Here is what I imagine it would be useful for : 
 - starting and stopping project timer with org-clock
 - global macros for pulling up a new notes or todo entry, or just general emacs macros
 - macro pad for more exotic commands that one might want to run every so often, or for switching buffers (with preview of the buffer name on the stream deck ?)
 ​
 All of these to me seem like feasible and useful. As I am relatively new to programming and elisp, I have a vague idea of how to implement this myself, but if someone has already gone through the trouble I would be happy to hear how they went about it !
 I use Doom emacs - macros and key bindings are pretty clear and easy to implement but more ways of interacting with emacs would be a plus for me ! 
 I imagine for the global commands something like the emacs api would need to be used, I've got to look into it more.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Liquid Haskell (LH) is a tool that gives the Haskell
programmer the ability to express what a program is meant to compute
and to verify that the program does meet this expectation.
One aspect that was not easy to deal with was understanding verification
failures. When a failure happened, we could get a summary of the condition that
LH was trying to verify, but we wouldn’t be able to say exactly which facts LH
was using to check it or which facts were missing.
In this post I will present some recent contributions of mine to LH, which give
the user better access to the facts used during verification. We will go through
an example of how these facts can be used to help LH prove a property in a more
informed way than previously possible.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of my transients has recently changed behavior, and is very bothersome. Normally I would use it to choose a file from the project and then, with the transient menu staying open after visiting the file, I can press the another transient key and do that thing. But no more.
 Now, after visiting a file, it looks the same as before -- meaning, the transient stays open at the bottom of the screen -- but my cursor has now moved to the file itself and attempting to press one of the transient keys just inserts that character into the buffer, as if transient wasn't there. I then usually have to get rid of the inaccessible transient menu by calling another transient and cancelling it immediately, after which my screen has returned to full no-transient normal.
 Why would this one command be now causing my transient to lose focus without visibly exiting? The find-file or switch-to-buffer ones work just fine without any unexpected context changes: that is, the transient stays focused with them until I directly cancel it. 
 Code:
  (defun tsa/projectile (&optional choose-project) "Navigate the project files, possibly choosing project first" (interactive "P") (if choose-project (projectile-switch-project) (projectile-find-file))) ;; this is bound to <f2> (transient-define-prefix tsa/transient-window () "Window navigation transient" :transient-non-suffix 'transient--do-quit-one :transient-suffix 'transient--do-stay [["Switch" ("b" "buffer" switch-to-buffer) ("f" "find-file" find-file) ("g" "git-grep" consult-git-grep) ("p" "projectile" tsa/projectile) ;; THIS one is the issue ("F" "follow" follow-mode) ("a" "ace 1" transient-ace-cmd)] ])

I used to use Emacs such that I could see the clock on my OS, but now I want to try using Emacs entirely full-screen; problem is, I don't have a clock any more. I used to have it on the mode-line, but I didn't like how the time was replicated everywhere, and it was taking up space that I wanted for other things.
 Is there a way to put a clock, say, in the right side of the tab-bar? This is a little line of space that is almost never in use, so it'd be perfect.
 Update: Here's a hack that I don't recommend, but it was kinda fun to figure out: it uses a posframe and a timer to get it to display: https://paste.sr.ht/~ashton314/4d490af6b4c6ae2f00012c8d807383001b242f1e
 There are some better suggestions in the comments, which I'll probably be using. :)
 2nd Update: Thanks to u/karthink, I've found a solution that works perfectly:
 lisp (add-to-list 'tab-bar-format 'tab-bar-format-align-right 'append) (add-to-list 'tab-bar-format 'tab-bar-format-global 'append) (setq display-time-format "%a %e %b %T") (setq display-time-interval 1) (display-time-mode)

 I've installed ghc 9.2.3 via ghcup. But it didn't work by default. I was getting linking errors when building any software: ~~~ $ ghc Main.hs ... ld64.ldd: error: unknown argument '--gc-sections' clang: error: linker command failed with exit code 1 ~~~
 I had to set: ~~~ ("ld is GNU ld", "NO") ~~~ In my settings file to fix this.
 Is this a bug in my initial set-up or ghc's bindist? I'm assuming it should work without having to tweak any default settings, and the ghc webpage claims that all I should need is the xcode command line tools installed.
 Next, I'm wanting to use the default ng code generator, rather than the llvm, so I'm slightly concerned that it is invoking clang.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi!
 I'm not a web-developer, but I occasionally use emacs for writing HTML. I've been far from memorizing the tags and attributes in HTML - with programming languages, I don't memorize the parameter list :/. So, I usually have an idea of what I want to do in HTML, but need to resort to googling/duckduckgo-ing quite frequently.
 However, I felt, it would be pretty great if there were some mode / emacs-extension / some-eww-friendly-website that could provide the tags, and the attributes that each tag takes, may be along with small examples as well as "see also". I've tried company-web and lsp-mode, and both provide descriptions of tags (which I mostly don't need!) but don't provide the attributes. With other languages, it is a great help to see the parameter list in the echo area, or even the function/macro/keyword documentation with a simple command.
 So, if anyone knows about this, it'd be great!
 Thanks you!
 EDIT: Moments after I posted this, yasnippet struck me; and it is helpful, but the tag-attribute reference manual would still be appreciated!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello dear redditors,
 I have a problem using tramp with my ssh config file and ProxyJump . I just can't figure out why it does not work. The situation is the folowoing:
 Machine_A ---> JumpMachine ---> Machine_B
 My ssh config for that looks as follows:
 Host Machine_B Hostname <some_ip> User <my_username> Port <some_port> ProxyJump JumpMachine ServerAliveInterval 60 Host JumpMachine Hostname <some_ip> User <Some_user> Port <some_port> ProxyCommand <a_simple_bashscript> IdentityFile <my_identiyfile> Host Machine_B_admin Hostname <some_ip> User <my_admin_username> Port <some_port> ProxyJump JumpMachine ServerAliveInterval 60 
 Machine B has no PW auth, only the jumpmachine. Both can be obviously accesed using ssh. The setup works with my shell (fish) as well as other shells and with vscode.
 ​
 What is really strange, is that that tramp always asks me for ssh:Machine_B passsword: while only the JumpMachine has a password. The PW auth is turned off for ssh on Machine_B. I tried using the password for JumpMachine and Machine_B and neither works. TBH I am not really sure what to do by now.
 I just wanted to mention that there is also another entry for my admin account. Don't know if that matters in any way.
 Any tips?

Everything I tried from the many help threads for this very problem failed, so I tried C-h v inhibit-startup-screen to see if these variables were indeed being set correctly. In fact, the value of inhibit-startup-screen was nil, and it is being set by startup.el.
 How can I have startup.el not overwrite my Emacs configuration file?
 EDIT: Found the solution. There were some errors in loading the Emacs config file, however the splash/startup screen hid those errors, so I never knew there were any problems. When the config file couldn't finish loading, it didn't get to my (setq inhibit-startup-screen t) instruction, hence it used the default startup.el setting. Resolving those errors meant that the config file would load entirely, and indeed the startup screen would be inhibited.

 There is things like keyboard maestro for mac or autohotkey that let you create macros and assign them to keys in certain programs. Autohotkey uses an alien syntax and keyboard maestro is mostly mouse based. They are ok but I always wondered if using elisp and emacs would be a more powerful combination. Besides, it would ran on all platforms. Would emacs server be able to do something like this? Anyone ever tried to do something like this?
 I have never tried EXWM but looking at performance I dont think it would work for me since this is for heavy post production tools.
 Update: thanks for the Linux suggestions but I am looking for a solution that runs on Mac and Windows mostly since all post production tools widely used run on those.

...is that lists are basically as much a control structure as a data structure in Haskell. And this makes sense: where you would use a C-style for loop in a different language, you would use a [1..] list in Haskell.
  
What does this mean? 
 I was searching for IOVector/MVector because I want to create a virtual machine; now for my purposes are Lists/Sequences the data structure I'm looking for, specially if I'd like to stick to a more functional paradigm.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[hi everybody,
 I use a file as my main "dashboard" and I would like to insert an agenda view into it. The idea is to "refresh" this buffer, remove the currently displayed agenda, compute the agenda for the day, and insert it into this buffer.
 I can do lisp, but I wonder if there is something similar to what I am trying to do that might have been already implemented.
 I guess ultimately I can look at the source code of org-agenda and reuse its code, but I am wondering if I would be "rediscovering the wheel"
 thank you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey,
 I have a need for functionality I haven't been able to find, though I might just lack the proper terminology to find the solution. I am a emacs noob, using Doom Emacs mostly for JS/TS programming (the killer features I am in love in with are magit and the ease of being keyboard-only). 
 So, my problem: I am currently working on the largest project I had ever done, and I would like to have some sort of automated system that would crawl through my code, find all the comments with tags (such as TODO, NOTE...), and compile them into an org file (for example notes.org) at the root of my project. 
 It seems like a fairly simple problem, and I am almost certain there already is a solution, but I haven't really been able to find it. The reason I haven't written it yet is because while elisp is cool and I'd like to be able to understand it, I haven't had the time yet (and after I am done with work, I barely have the brain power to read a book, not to learn a wholly different language). 
 Any pointers would be most appreciated! Thanks

Overall I've seen the value of optics but there is one place where I haven't been able to figure out how to apply them. That place is trying to set a value for which I have a prism, especially for which I have a lens + prism that I want to use to reach deep into a value.
 Setting on a prism only replaces the value if the prism matches. I'd like to know if there is some optics construction that I can use to replace the value whether or not the prism matches. I know about review but that doesn't compose with lenses. I can ignore the prism and just use set on the lens with the value wrapped in the correct constructor, but I'm looking to see …]]></summary>

A type f is a Functor if it provides a function fmap which, given any types a and b, lets you apply any function of type (a -> b) to turn an f a into an f b, preserving the structure of f. 
  
In this scenario is it valid to call f a type? And even if it is, considering its kind is * -> *, wouldn't it be more accurate (and even less confusing) to say it's a "type former" or type constructor? To my intuition it feels a little odd to say something is a type when its kind is not * so it isn't really a concrete type.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I'm making the switch from Neovim to Emacs for Clojure development.
 For the completion I'm used to <Tab> and <S-Tab> for cycling through suggestions, and the suggestions would be automatically placed in the buffer when selected so that <Enter> would only behave as a newline.
 This is what I got for now:
 elisp (use-package company :init (add-hook 'after-init-hook 'global-company-mode) :config (global-company-mode t) (setq company-minimum-prefix-length 1) (setq company-idle-delay 0.0) :bind (:map company-active-map ("TAB" . company-select-next) ("<backtab>" . company-select-previous) ("RET" . nil))) 
 Issues:
  
Now I don't have a way to autocomplete since when I select suggestions they don't get placed in the buffer
 Placing S-TAB instead of <backtab> in the :bind section doesn't work
 If I tap <S-Tab>, then pressing <Enter> becomes unresponsive
  
Thanks! Any help is appreciated. :D (Also if you see some bad practice tell me please)
 EDIT: did I do something wrong? I see a 50% of downvoting rate

But then if I try to type the username and IP of the remote machine, every single character I type causes Tramp to ask me for the local machine password again. I have to hit ESC to show the original Tramp prompt again. Typing another character asks for the password again. You get the idea.
 Has anyone else had this? I don't even know where to look to know what to fix.

Since lists are fundamental to Haskell, I was wondering if Haskell represents lists as actual linked lists in memory. If it does, then how much does Haskell suffer performance wise because of this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've released version 0.2 of plz.el, my HTTP library for Emacs Lisp that uses curl as a backend. This version includes a new feature, a simple request queue system. It works like this:
 (defvar my-queue (make-plz-queue :limit 2)) (plz-run (plz-queue my-queue 'get "https://httpbin.org/get?foo=0" :then (lambda (body) (message "%s" body)))) 
 Or:
 (let ((queue (make-plz-queue :limit 2)) (urls '("https://httpbin.org/get?foo=0" "https://httpbin.org/get?foo=1"))) (plz-run (dolist (url urls queue) (plz-queue queue 'get url :then (lambda (body) (message "%s" body)))))) 
 So far it's only been used in the newest version of Ement.el, my Matrix client for Emacs, to queue requests for images (like room avatars, image messages, etc). It seems to be working well, but please let me know if there are any issues.

 Sometimes when I shutdown emacs and fire it up again I get some errors like this and my perspectives ares gone:
 Error: Can not autoresume perspectives -- (error Buffer is not associated with any file xxxxxxx )
 As the error says, the problem is that for some pre-existing buffer in the saved perspective there is not anymore a file to the buffer to load from.
 This seems like it should have a simple fix, IF THE FILE IS GONE, KILL THE BUFFER! But I did not find how to configure persp-mode to behave like that. Does any one knows how to do it?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hiya everyone, I've been using Org mode for a while and have also tried the likes of Notion, Confluence/Jira and a plethora of other tools as a knowledge base/project management options within different teams.
 Is there a way to use Org without forcing an entire team to learn Emacs and a sync workflow? The Org+git workflow is understandably a big ask and I've experienced the pain a few times already. I'd like to use Org in Emacs on my own machines but have other team members access the data through a lower entry-barier interface such as the web.
 Tools like LogSeq seems to want to head there but still have a large focus on having to obtain their client first. Many teams are familiar with the "login through SSO and make changes" kind of workflow, so I'm keen to learn what's in this space and how you all solve this problem -- in case this is even a problem for y'all. Is this even a reasonable ask or shall I just stuck it up and suffer through Notion and Confluence/Jira?
 PS: I'm often fill of rage when I use those tools but as I find them inhibiting (breaking my flow) but maybe I just need a (better) therapist. 🤷🏿‍♂️

 I tried to use God Mode today, however, pressing i doesn't activate by keybinding, but that of the tab key. How do I fix this?

 I wanted to insert a question into my daily journaling practice (aka a "journaling prompt"). Maybe someone will find this useful:
 A touch of capture templates:
 ("dj" "Journal" entry (file+olp+datetree ,(concat org-directory "/personal-daily-2022.org")) "* Entered on %U Prompt: %(dm/get-journaling-prompt) %?") 
 And a bit of elisp:
 (defun dm/get-journaling-prompt () "Returns a single line from journaling prompts." (save-window-excursion (find-file (concat org-roam-directory "journaling_prompts.org")) (goto-char (point-max)) (let* ((number-of-prompts (- (line-number-at-pos) 10))) (goto-line (+ 10 (random number-of-prompts))) 
 This is what it ends up looking like after invoking the correct capture template: https://dmitrym0.github.io/ox-hugo/2022-07-17_13-10-28_screenshot.png
 and a quick blog post about it: https://dmitrym0.github.io/posts/journaling-prompts-with-emacs/

My plans for this coming week include continuing my deep dive into The Tao of Travel by Paul Theroux. Theroux's book is an interesting turn on the philosophy of travel. I'm connecting ideas about the philosophy of travel with relativity and space/time.
I'm starting the book The Book of Form and Emptiness by Ruth Ozeki. I don't know what to expect at this point. The many layers of story in her first book moved me a lot: A Tale for the Time Being by Ruth Ozeki. I just ordered The Book of Form and Emptiness via InterLibrarary Loan, and it took four months to get it (the anticipation built up my expectations!). It came across the country from the Yuma Public Library. Thanks, University of Idaho Library, for hunting it down and the community of Yuma for lending it!
Here are a few of the titles of zettel I've been working on last week. The top two in the list are still in my "#proofing" oven.

 my goal is to build a Haskell package (library). The ultimate goal of this process is to have this package installed locally and to be able to use these functions.
 After cabal init, cabal configure and cabal build, This is the output after cabal install:

 I am not able to use the package, though. 
 When entering

 Which step am I missing or doing wrong?

Instead of passing along the original structure you pass down add helper data structure instead. For my specific use case i am looking to typecheck an AST, when in a declaration node i would like to add to the helper data structure, essentially building the data structure when going from the root to the leaves. Then going from the leaves to the root i can use the helper structure when identfiers are used.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Years ago my personal note taking was no longer based on trial and error but on a solid concept called Bullet Journaling. It started on paper with a lovely Moleskin book and a black fine liner from Neuland. Going digital with my Bullet Journal I decided to use a brilliant tool for note taking named OneNote. But time went by. In March 2022 I got my first contact with Obsidian and at the same time with the Zettelkasten method from Niklas Luhmann explained in the brilliant book from Sönke Ahrens about “How to take Smart Notes”.
Migration from OneNote to Obsidian was a migration from structured notes to networked notes. But how to migrate a Bullet Journal to a Zettelkasten? Difficult to switch from one concept to another? No, it’s very easy. The Bullet Journal is now a set of Structure Notes in my Zettelkasten. Also Zettelkasten is a Custom Collection in my Bullet Journal.
In other words:
my Zettelkasten is a Bullet Journal and
my Bullet Journal is a Zettelkasten.
The best of all: I did not need to change the basic concepts from Ryder Carroll (Bullet Journal), neither the concepts from Niklas Luhmann (Zettelkasten). Both concepts support each other in a perfect manner.
What about your experiences with theses methods? Do you use the Dataview plugin to support your Bullet Journal collections?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With your help, I'd like to to understand how exporting completion candidates works with consult and embark.
 Here's a use-case that comes up a lot in my flow as a programmer: find & replace text matches.
 You might say projectile-replace works great but it prompts for every replace and is super annoying, especially on very large code-bases.
 So how to do it with consult and embark?
 I think I have come close with the following flow:
 - M-x consult-git-grep
 - #match-this-text
 Now, if I M-x embark-collect, I end up with an embark buffer. If, on the other hand, I M-x embark-export, I end up with a grep buffer. 
 Which of the two buffers do I need (why?), and how do I go about replacing the text I'm after?

I know Doomemacs offers a more Vim-like experience but I worried about getting lost without knowing more basics. So I was wondering whether it's a good path to basically just consider Doomemacs its own experience and start from there, as it were the basic editor?

 I jumped in the Org / DooM bandwagon in 2020. On my phone and tablet (termux / orgzly), and laptop (*nix)
 Org works for me because it's keyboard based, and on all my devices.
 Unfortunately I've struggled to leave noob level, and failed to make org mode into the "second brain" / virtual assistant I envisaged. I shouldn't complain as it's genuinely useful for GTD-like organisation and location based reminders (via tasker)
 I see the weekly tip thread in on r/emacs, but most of the tips are way more advanced than the level I'm at.
 Had anyone got any noob friendly tips about general org-mode capabilities to explore?
 My current workflow / level is:
  
Open org file from bookmark (dired)
 Edit and save org file
 use links, including to files, to organise stuff
 if there are conflicts (damn you syncthing), resolve with ediff
 if anything goes "weird" in emacs kill buffer / delete window until back to the fallback buffer - then try again.
  
I had some luck early on with tasker and bash scripts to manipulate org files based on various conditions - but I've long forgotten how all that works.
 Similarly, I tried to get notmuch mail setup two years ago, but ran into trouble with gmail and exchange authentication 
 Would love to hear your suggestions for my org-mode journey.
 I've also asked if there are any emacs-specific things I can try on the emacs sub

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been playing with plantuml src in org files to generate drawings. It works great except for one thing, the indentation gets lost when I add nested objects.
 Where should I look to extend the existing indentation code to handle nested cases?
 Minor modes enabled in this buffer: Display-Line-Numbers Font-Lock Org-Src Visual-Line The major mode is plantuml mode defined in plantuml-mode.el: 
 Should I be looking at the plantuml major mode first, or the Org-src minor mode to noodle with the indents?
 Any recommendations on how to approach indentation config?
 Example showing how the indents get lost:
 * Components Drawing #+begin_src plantuml :file ComponentDiagram.svg @startuml Component Diagram ' Components component ExternaComponent1 package "Subsystem" { component SubSysComp1 [ Subsystem Component 1 ] package "InternalNestedSubsystem" { package "InternalDoubleNestedSubsystem" { component SubSubComp1 [ Sub-Subsystem Component 1 ] component SubSubComp2 [ Sub-Subsystem Component 2 ] SubSubComp1 -() internalInterface1 internalInterface1 )- SubSubComp2 } ' This lines up correctly } ' This should be one indent to the left } ' This should be all the way to the left @enduml ' This should be all the way to the left instead of indented. #+end_src

 This is yet another sequel to my Clean Architecture with Haskell and Polysemy article.
 In my last blog post I demonstrated how the actual hosting of a WAI web app (e.g. with the Warp server or on AWS Lambda) can be defined as a Polysemy effect. The idea was well received in the haskell subreddit and stirred some further discussions. One question that came up: why did I explicitly load configuration before starting the Polysemy effect interpreter? Wouldn’t it be much more in line with the overall idea of my Polysemy Clean Architecture to handle this loading also as an effect?
 I explained my reasons for this design but promised to look for a better solution.
 In this blog post I’ll explain the new design that I came up with.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Howdy. I'm completely new to Emacs. Just loaded it up for the first time on Ubuntu Studio 22.04 and the UI is way to small to see anything (see this screenshot).
 I looked for solutions and everyone says to Ctrl + Scroll Wheel, and that doesn't do it. It only zooms the editor. The UI / Window stuff itself says small.
 I tried installing the Spacemacs config to see if it would fix it, but it didn't.
 Any ideas on how to fix this?
 edit: The award goes to u/Faerryn for fixing it. Thanks to everyone else for the suggestions, but thankfully I don't have to try them. I've added the solution here for easy finding:
  
Open ~/.emacs.d/init.el
 Add (set-face-attribute 'default nil :family "FONT HERE" :height 120) to the file.
 Replace "FONT HERE" with your desired font.
 Save the file.

 I've gone through most of the tickets that reported similar errors, and the suggestion is to disable TemplateHaskell using the pragma {-# LANGUAGE NoTemplateHaskell #-}. However, that doesn't help in this case. I've opened a ticket myself, but open-source maintainers usually have other things to do, so, I'm not holding my breath.

 Stackage and stack are the most widely used tools we have. Many developers use the process for early discovery of library activity: who is behind the (sometimes punishing) pace of change; when will it be easiest to upgrade; which dependencies can I trust.
 With the PvP-style philosophy you have less visibility.

 I suspect that running org-mode after I open the file is the reason why it is slow.
 Can the same processing be done so long as the files is not interactively edited? The task involved is a read-only task?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello.
My name is Mike Kramer. Two years ago, I made a very low-effort comment on this forum, but I never introduced myself.
I first heard of the Zettelkasten Method by reading Ahrens's book. Through it, I discovered Christian and Sascha. From studying them, I realized that, just as the hardest part of GTD is processing--deciding which outcomes are worth committing to and which actions will cause those desired outcomes--the hardest part of a high-value Zettelkasten Method is specifying the nature of the connection that links one Zettel to another. GTD deals only with causal connections between items. The Zettelkasten Method can handle both causal and logical connections.
At the most fundamental level, my approach is based on the zettelkasten.de critique that says that a Folgezettel is a variant of the Collector's Fallacy. When I observe the work of other people, they usually cannot specify how a new note relates to its predecessor in the Folgezettel. They have the feeling that they have accomplished something meaningful, but, if they cannot write down the nature of the relation that obtains between connected notes, their thinking is inadequate.
To improve my own thinking, I track the status of the connections between my notes. Lumping a bunch of notes together is a low-effort, low-value kind of link compared to a link that shows how some notes provide reasons that support (or undermine) another note.
In March of this year, I produced a YouTube video of how I implement my method in Roam. Of course, this method could be implemented with other tools.

I welcome your feedback. I hope to be spending a bit of time in wilderness areas, so it might take me a week or so to respond.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Here's the use case:
  
we're creating a simple in-memory use case for use in unit tests
 we use the builder pattern along with a library to generate reasonable fake data to generate mock objects
 we then need to use these builder functions to build objects *with valid relationships*. For example, children with parentIds that exist. 
 however, in order to do that, we need to create/access the same object instances. See below for what I mean.
 question: is there a functional approach?
  
Note: I'm actually a Typescript user (w/ some working haskell knowledge) but I figured this is one the best places to get answers for something like this :-) 
 ``` const deviceFactory = (): Device => ({ address: faker.internet.ipv4(), networkId: faker.unique(faker.datatype.number), serial: faker.unique(faker.datatype.number), });
 // I can do something like this to build specific devices // but then these objects are mutable, which is bad for tests const devices = [deviceFactory(), deviceFactory()] const switchDevices = [deviceFactory(), deviceFactory]
 // I can wrap these in functions // but then I get different objects each invocation const devices = () => [deviceFactory(), deviceFactory()]; const switchDevices = () => [deviceFactory(), deviceFactory];
 devices() // serial1, serial2 devices() // serialA, serialB ```

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm currently in the process of developing an app with similar or greater complexity to SimpleX chat and am looking for some advice regarding the usage of Haskell for a cross-platform logic layer.
 Haskell is currently my number one choice due to its elegance, however I have some concerns with how well it can be implemented. The app will initially be released on iOS and macOS with the platform specific code written in Swift. Later on I plan to expand to Android (Kotlin), Windows (likely .NET), and potentially the browser (WebAsm), each written in their native developemnt frameworks. Linux is also planned but I'm confident there will be no issues there.
 Does anyone have some advice or experience with this? I'm mainly worried about the following things:
  
Ease of compilation
 Performance
 Inter language API/ABI complexity
 Support for the the latest platform releases
  
Would it be better to just use Rust?
 ​
 Any and all advice is greatly appreciated!

 I'm on emacs 27 and this is happening using the rustic package with flycheck and eglot.
 If I disable eldoc before it ever holds docs, I'm not prompted to save.
 But If I look at something in eldoc, and even after I quit eldoc-mode, emacs wants to save only the examples section of eldoc.
 This is a bizarre error and I'm wondering if there's just a setting I have turned on? My next step is to dig into the eldoc code.
 EDIT:
 I've been annoyed by this for months, and I finally tracked it down to the " markdown-fontification-buffer:rust" buffer that gets created by eglot or lsp-mode. This led me to this fix for anyone else experiencing this:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone,
 It's taken ages, but finally the initial release of the effectful library is here 🎉
 For people unfamiliar with it, it's an extensible effects library that:
  
Is very fast (see benchmarks) when compared to other effect libraries and MTL as it's internally a ReaderT over IO.
 
Has flexible and easy to use API for higher order effects (similar to MonadUnliftIO).
 
Fixes subtle issues of popular monad transformers.
 
Makes it easy to integrate with the existing ecosystem of libraries.
 
 I started working on it after the eff effort was stalled due to a few unresolved issues.
 Over the years of writing Haskell professionally I got more and more tired of:
  
Boilerplate related to mtl style effects (along with complexity of monad-control).
 
Subtle issues of monad transformers that people new to the language were re-encountering over and over again.
 
The monad-control vs unliftio-core split that made it not possible to use some libraries together.
 
 effectful (as far as I know) solves these problems.
 FYI, there are already a few adapters for existing libraries (resourcet-effectful is already released and several are brewing here).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm working on the following problem:
  
Correctly determine the fewest number of coins to be given to a customer such that the sum of the coins' value would equal the correct amount of change. 
 For example: 
 An input of 15 with [1, 5, 10, 25, 100] should return one nickel (5) and one dime (10) or [5, 10] 
 An input of 40 with [1, 5, 10, 25, 100] should return one nickel (5) and one dime (10) and one quarter (25) or [5, 10, 25]
  
I've decided to solve it using top-down dynamic programming. To cache the results, I'm using a State Monad.
 module Change (findFewestCoins) where -- imports elided for brevity type Memo = Map Integer (Maybe [Integer]) type Coins = [Integer] type Change = Maybe Coins findFewestCoins :: Integer -> Coins -> Change findFewestCoins target coins = S.evalState (change target coins) MP.empty change :: Integer -> Coins -> State Memo Change change 0 _ = return $ Just [] change _ [] = return $ Nothing change target coins = do memo <- S.get if MP.member target memo then return $ MP.findWithDefault Nothing target memo else do let xs = filter (<= target) coins let loop coin = (coin :) <$> change (target - coin) coins let ys = map loop xs -- How to do this? let zs = M.catMaybes ys -- ((+) `on` f) x y = f x + f y let minBy = L.minimumBy (compare `F.on` length) let chng = if null zs then Nothing else Just $ minBy zs S.put (MP.insert target chng memo) return $ chng 
 The code may have bugs, but that's for later once I get it to compile. The problem is with this line:let ys = map loop xs
 Within a do block, it's easy to "dereference" the result of a single recursive call by simply doing ys <- loop, but here I have a list of states, and I don't know how to combine them.

        <updated>2022-07-15T09:40:12.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all,
 I am looking for a method to overlap multi parameter type classes, such that i can declare functions for any parameter combination (containing multiple completely specified instances). My code snipped can explain this better than i do:
 newtype Dd x y = ToDd Cudd.DdNode deriving (Eq,Show) --x data F1 data F0 --y data S1 data S0 class DdF a b where bot :: Dd a b con :: Dd a b -> Dd a b -> Dd a b -- ..etc 
 "bot" is a constructor, so i need to fully specify the instances:
 instance {-# OVERLAPS #-} DdF F1 S1 where bot mgr = ToDd (Cudd.zddReadZero mgr) instance {-# OVERLAPS #-} DdF F1 S0 where bot mgr = ToDd (Cudd.zddReadOne mgr) instance {-# OVERLAPS #-} DdF F0 S1 where bot mgr = ToDd (Cudd.zddReadZero mgr) instance {-# OVERLAPS #-} DdF F0 S0 where bot mgr = ToDd (Cudd.zddReadOne mgr) 
 "con" has shared code between the S1 and S0 instances, so i am looking to defined these functions along the line of:
 instance {-# OVERLAPS #-} DdF F1 a where con mgr (ToDd z1) (ToDd z2) = ToDd (Cudd.zddIntersect mgr z1 z2) instance {-# OVERLAPS #-} DdF F0 a where con mgr (ToDd z1) (ToDd z2) = ToDd (Cudd.zddUnion mgr z1 z2) 
 Here i simplified to only 2 parameters, in my actual code i have 3 - and many functions requiring only one or two parameters to be specified. Implementing along the above manner would reduce duplicate code by a lot, and allows me to still make use of the type inference system.
 Yet when i run the code ("let y = con (bot :: Dd F1 S1) (bot :: Dd F1 S1)", with no compiler issues), examining y gives the following error : "[...] Exception: [...] : No instance nor default method for class operation con". 
 Am i misunderstanding the Overlapping and Multiparameter type-classes wrongly? Or is there an easy fix for what i want to achieve?

Copy and paste information, convert from markdown syntax to Office like structure. This is my main concern that I want to address in this post.
Requirement to produce plain text from small snippets of thoughts and bullet points. I know that this is probably the actual issue, where everyone has their own personal limits...
I personally am using vimwiki. I often have already structured text inside my wiki, so I am not following a dedicated ZK method, where I would provide very small pieces of information, as I have read it in your introduction. 
I am currently working in an environment where the documents for external partners need to be written and shared in MS Office and the internal documents with LibreOffice. I personally often share textfiles internally, but there are some that don't like this, and latest when we have a kind of official internal meeting, I "quickly" convert my initial text into Office document.
How do you effectively export things from your knowledge base into documents that you want to publish eventually having the following points in mind:
Efficient working: Information that is gained during writing the document to be published might also be needed to be transferred into you your knowledge base - duplicated information
Markdown syntax is not powerful enough to e.g. handle tables, so there is cumbersom reformating when moving data. Vimwiki syntax is not supported externally. AsciiDoc is a kind of strange to me. Multimarkdown was not fully supported by all my tools.
Laying out a document in MS Word or LibreOffice is for me a very time consuming process, when I copy plain text into it.
I tried several conversion methods like for example


exported html from vimwiki into word
several tries with pandoc (e.g. to LibreOffice)



Thank you]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hiya, I'm trying to learn how to make a Parser using this paper (p17): http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~pszgmh/monparsing.pdf and I just cannot seem to get the expr function to work using chainl1 ,addops and ops. It works fine using addop' but the regular addop isn't working :(.
 ​
 Here's my attempted implementation, what is going wrong?:
 ​
 newtype Parser a = Parser {runParser :: String -> [(a,String)]} instance Functor Parser where fmap f (Parser xs) = Parser $ \inp -> map (\(v,inp) -> (f v, inp)) (xs inp) instance Applicative Parser where pure = return Parser f <*> Parser x = Parser $ \inp -> [(func v, inp' ++ inp'') | (v, inp') <- x inp, (func, inp'') <- f inp] instance Monad Parser where return v = result v p >>= f = Parser $ \inp -> concat [runParser (f v) out | (v , out) <- runParser p inp] zero :: Parser a zero = Parser $ \inp -> [] result :: a -> Parser a result v = Parser $ \inp -> [(v,inp)] expr :: Parser Int expr = factor `chainl1` addop addop' :: Parser (Int -> Int -> Int) addop' = add `plus` minus where add = do _ <- char '+' return (+) minus = do _ <- char '-' return (-) -- addop rewritten in the context of ops addop :: Parser (Int -> Int -> Int) addop = ops [(char '+' , (+) ), (char '-' , (-) ) ] -- ops allow us to recursively put together operations ops :: [(Parser a, b)] -> Parser b ops xs = foldr plus zero op where op = do (p, op) <- xs _ <- [p] [result op] -- chainl1 is a function that parses non-empty sequences of items separated by operators that associate to the left: chainl1 :: Parser a -> Parser (a -> a -> a) -> Parser a chainl1 p op = p >>= rest where rest x = (op >>= \f -> p >>= \y -> rest (f x y)) `plus` return x test :: Num b => [(Maybe a,b)] -> Maybe b test xs = return $ foldr1 (+) fin where fin = do (x,y) <- xs _ <- [x] [y] a :: [(Maybe Integer, Integer)] a = zip (fmap Just [1..10]) [3..9] 
 test a returns 42.
 runParser expr "1+2+3" returns: [(1, "+2+3")] when it should return [(6,"")] ... [(1, "+2+3")]

 Hi,
 seasoned developer (C++, Elixir) but Haskell beginner here.
 I tried to implement a kata with the following specification:
 Having an array of (non-negative) integers, find a contiguous sub-sequence that has a given number S as its sum. Determine the value of the first and last element with indices starting from 1.
 E.g.:
 S = 15
 [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
 Result: (1, 5)
 Here my absolutely not elegant (although it works) implementation in Haskell:
 -- ghc -O2 findrange.hs type Index = Int data Sequence = Sequence {begin :: Index, end :: Index, found :: Bool} deriving (Show) findRange :: Int -> [Int] -> Sequence findRange n = findSumSequence n 1 findSumSequence :: Int -> Int -> [Int] -> Sequence findSumSequence _ _ [] = Sequence 0 0 False findSumSequence n b (x : xs) = if found sequence then sequence else -- else findSum n (b + 1) 0 xs findSumSequence n (b + 1) xs where sequence = findSum n b 0 (x : xs) findSum :: Int -> Index -> Index -> [Int] -> Sequence findSum _ b e [] = Sequence b e False findSum n b e (x : xs) | x == n = Sequence b (b + e) True | x > n = Sequence b e False | otherwise = findSum (n - x) b (e + 1) xs main :: IO () main = print (findRange 15 [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]) 
 Three questions:
 1) How does my code look in the eyes of an Haskell expert?
 2) Do you have suggestions or tips I can do to improve it? 
 3) I did the same kata in C++ and using standard library and iterators, sliding the array just once (so O(n) complexity), and without recursion, it is INSANELY fast. Can I hope to reach the same performances in Haskell as well?
 Thank you 1K for your feedback.
 Nicola

 We are very happy to announce the release of Copilot 3.10. Copilot is a runtime verification system implemented as a Haskell DSL that generates hard-realtime C99. You can learn more about it at [1], [5].
 This new version of Copilot contains a small but important change in how structs are handled in C functions invoked by the monitors when property violations are detected. This change is API-breaking, so users of Copilot may need to adapt their systems accordingly. The release also contains a number of bug fixes, provides a simplified API, deprecates outdated elements, removes unused code, and relaxes version constraints for dependencies. A full list of changes merged is available at [2].

 I wanted to post my current understanding here, to check whether my understanding is correct? I feel like I'm still not 100% getting it.
 In elisp there are two distinct namespaces: one for functions and one for variables. This means I can have a variable called foobar and also a function called foobar, and they won't interfere with one another.
 If I want to evaluate a variable, then I just write the variable - eg foobar. If I want to evaluate a function, then I include it within parentheses (with arguments as needed) - eg (foobar arg1 arg2).
 If I want to refer to the symbol of a variable, then I prepend it with a quote - eg 'foobar. If I want to refer to the symbol of function, then I prepend it with a hash and quote - eg #'foobar.
 Lambdas are something of a mish-mash: they allow me to set the value of a variable to be a function, that will itself be called each time that variable is evaluated.
 Is that about it? Would love any feedback around where my understanding may have gone awry.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I started learning Scala some time ago and went through all the courses of the Cousera Specialization as well as the one on Reactive Systems. Now I have completed all of those and getting kind of confused on what should I work on to get better and keep learning. As I'm pivoting into CS and still working outside the SWE industry, I want to keep working on it after work. My goal is to land a backend engineering gig and that's why I picked up this stack. I understand that there are similar posts in this sub and there is plenty of advice available there, it would be really helpful if I can get some suggestions based on my background and skills.

For some reason, when I was contemplating our rather quiet forum over the past week, this phrase came to mind.]]></summary>

Users love it for being a superior tool for building, deploying, and managing software.
Yet, it is generally perceived as notoriously hard to learn.
The core Nix ecosytem consists of several distinct components:
The Nix package manager comes with a configuration language to declare software components, the Nix language.
Software made available through the package manager is centrally maintained in the Nix package collection, also known as nixpkgs.
There also exists a Linux distribution called NixOS, which is based on the package manager and the package collection.
In an attempt to provide an alternative learning approach, this article discusses the Nix package manager (hereafter simply referred to as Nix) and its underlying principles in the context of the…]]></summary>

 I have one little thing I have found to slow me down a little and wondering whether you guys had some suggestions.
 I used to have a buffer line with my current open buffers in Neovim and this allowed me to have 2-4 buffers/files in the bufferline that I was working on. It meant that I didn't have to think about which file I want to skip forward or back to - I would just look at the buffer line and then prev or next or wildcard to the buffer I want to skip to.
 In Emacs you do end up with a lot more open buffers so something similar wouldn't quite work but I wonder whether there are other solutions that might solve my issue. 
 I would be perfectly happy to mark the buffers that I am currently working on for example and have them displayed somewhere for ease. Or have them pop up at the top of my buffer or ibuffer list so they are easy to see and select.
 Any suggestions?

 data Expr = Number Int | Add Expr Expr | Minus Expr | Mult Expr Expr | Divide Expr Expr 
 They say this is in "normal form" because it's a sum (type) of products: Number Int + Add (Expr Expr) + .... Yes, I see that Expr is a sum type that, in turn, contains (but not exclusively) product types. But I'm not getting the significance of this.
 They go on to say
  
A stricter interpretation of normal form or “sum of products” would require representing products with tuples and sums with Either. The previous datatype in that form would look like the following
  
​
 type Number = Int type Add = (Expr, Expr) type Minus = Expr type Mult = (Expr, Expr) type Divide = (Expr, Expr) type Expr = Either Number (Either Add (Either Minus (Either Mult Divide))) 
 Before they talk about the distributive property, then saying:
  
Product types distribute over sum types.
  
I'm not really getting the significance of this and don't really understand the stricter interpretation. Any lore would be appreciated.

 (setq org-capture-templates '( ("n" "note" entry (file+olp+datetree "/Users/me/org/logbook.org" "JOURNAL") ... ) ("t" "tasks" entry (file+olp+datetree "/Users/me/org/todo.org" "TASKS") ... ) ) ) 
 I'm trying to change that so that the dirname portion -- /Users/me/org -- is already specified in a variable, and I can just append the different filenames for each template. But I'm having difficulty, having tried various methods including concat, expand-file-name, to mention only two.
 Two (elisp newbie) questions:
 1) What is the best way to do what I'm attempting?
 2) Second: to help me understand what I'm doing wrong, suppose I first set up a couple of variables like this:
 (setq org-directory "/Users/me/org") (setq org-logbook-file (concat org-directory "/logbook.org")) 
 Why is it that this then works: 
  entry (file+olp+datetree org-logbookfile-file "JOURNAL") 
 but this does not:
  entry (file+olp+datetree (concat org-directory "/logbook.org") "JOURNAL") 
 thx.

  case class Person(name: String, surname: String, age: Int) case class PersonWithId(id: UUID, name: String, surname: String, age: Int) case class PersonWithEmail(name: String, surname: String, age: Int, email: Email)

Is there a way to scratch this boilerplate a bit? I'd like to write something like:
 ``` case class Person(name: String, surname: String, age: Int) type PersonWithId = ("id", UUID) :: Person type PersonWithEmail = Person :: ("email", Email)
 given Encoder[PersonWithId] = deriveEncoder[PersonWithId]
 val withId = PersonWithId(UUID.random(), "Bob", "Smith", 27) ```
 I know Scala 3 has added many new tools around product types and wondering if there's anything that can help me out.
 PS. I just find it sad that TypeScript, a language that I'd think has weaker type system allows to do this out of the box:
  type Person = { name: string, surname: string, age: number } type PersonWithId = Pick<Person, "name" | "surname"> const withId: PersonWithId = { name: "Bob", surname: "Smith" }

 So... I know Scala 3 came out about a year ago. Are the big Scala projects (Apache Spark, Apache Kafka, etc) going to port their codebases to version 3? Or have they specifically announced that they're not going to? AFAICT, the projects are just sort of sitting there, ignoring the new version...
 EDIT: found this post about Kafka. Still not sure about Spark...

 ​
 So my question is regarding the head of the list (x:xs). What exactly happens to x in the otherwise case? Does it just get dumped from memory? Not sure if my question is making sense, perhaps there's a better way to phrase it. I'm just a newbie trying to learn the language. It all makes a lot of sense so far, but I feel it would clear up much confusion to understand what's going on with regards to the head x.

I ran into the zettelkasten system while deep diving for ways to deepen my research, organize my usually jumbled thoughts, and connect my ideas. The zettel process is helpful because most of my work turns into written productsI often readng academic journals and think pieces on military concepts and other international policies.
I just restarted my zettel journey after reading Ahrens' "Smart Notes" and powering through a few Youtube videos. My current focus is figuring out a "good" way to process literature notes. My initial way of creating literature notes would be a two-step process: taking general notes while reading and then finalizing a summary for the "final literature note" to connect with my fleeting notes to create permanent notes.
I'm still a zettel newbie, so how do you process your literature notes? Any recommended readings about the topic? I look forward to engaging with everyone and learning more about the zettelkasten system!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been using Haskell for leisure a bit now, and for testing my code I've explored things like making a typeclass (with a real instance and a test instance), making an effect datatype and an interpreter, trying to separate pure and IO code. All of them required many changes to the existing code, and in the end I couldn't get many things out of it. 
 In the last week, I was touching Python for my job and its built-in mocking framework (unittest.mock). I was blown away. Nothing at all needs to change in the existing app code, yet I can mock and perform assertions on any function at all:
 # test that my function deletes the found file with mock.patch("glob.glob") as glob: # mock a return value glob.return_value = ["file.txt"] with mock.patch("os.remove") as remove: main_logic_to_delete_files() # perform asserts on no. times called and arguments remove.assert_called_once_with(path="file.txt") 
 It greatly lowered the barrier to perform unit tests for me, and I was amazed at how simply I could test the behaviour of my logic. 
 Does anybody know of any library in Haskell that can do similar things, or any ideas on how I may go about making one if not? I'm thinking Template Haskell or some AST-foo can maybe manage things.

 How long did it take you to consider yourself good at haskell? How many hours did you study per week? (Did you study all your free time or just occasionally?)
 And by the way, how applicable are these more advanced concepts (Monads, Monoids, Applicative Functor, etc) in other programming languages?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If I have this definitions
 ``` twice f = f . f
 swap (x,y) = (y,x) ```
 The type of twice is infered to (a -> a) -> a -> a and swap is infered to (a,b) -> (b,a).
 If I write swap . swap the type of that expression is (a, b) -> (a, b).
 But if I ask for twice swap its type is (a, a) -> (a, a).
 I know that twice is restricting the type of swap. But I'm wondering if there is a way to write twice so that it accepts swap without restricting its type. That is, you can write twice swap and accept pairs where each component has a different type.
 The same happens with flip :: (a -> b -> c) -> b -> a -> c, because twice flip :: (a -> a -> b) -> a -> a -> b.

 So I recently completed setting up LSP for Haskell using Neovim and it's working great. But now I want to have the ability to also have LSP when my Haskell file is not in a stack project. For the instance I wanna write a small script or play around with some code.
 Is it possible to have LSP on a single Haskell file and if yes how would I accomplish it.
 If no what would be a good alternative for my use case? 
 Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Here's an annoying question I've been facing for a while.
 ​
 Take this code sample:
 ​
 data Type1 = Con1 | Con2 | Con3 | Con4
 ​
 foo :: Type1 -> Maybe Type1
 foo bar = case bar of
 Con1 -> pure Con1
 Con2 -> pure Con2
 Con3 -> pure Con3
 Con4 -> pure Con4
 ​
 This isn't so complicated to clean up, is it?
 ​
 ​
 foo bar = pure $ case bar of
 Con1 -> Con1
 Con2 -> Con2
 Con3 -> Con3
 Con4 -> Con4
 ​
 There, now we've simplified this term slightly.
 ​
 Let's look at a different case:
 ​
 foo bar = case bar of
 Con1 -> Nothing
 Con2 -> Just Con2
 Con3 -> Just Con3
 Con4 -> Just Con4
 ​
 This isn't hard to fix either, if you think in terms of nested case expressions:
 ​
 foo bar = pure $ case bar of
 Con1 -> Nothing
 _ -> pure $ case bar of 
 Con2 -> Con2
 Con3 -> Con3
 Con4 -> Con4
 ​
 It's when you have wildcards comprising multiple elements that the real problem arises:
 ​
 foo bar = case bar of
 Con1 -> pure Con1
 Con2 -> pure Con2
 _ -> Nothing
 ​
 Now how do we remove this?
 ​
 I'm tilting toward supporting an idea of subcasing, but I'm not really sure how much Haskell code might need a revision to case syntax. In my (very limited) Haskell experience, pure ... comes up when working with Maybe, and if you want a wildcard pattern to catch everything you might have missed, there doesn't seem to be a solution other than typing everything out, or worse, adding a null type to your sum type.
 ​
 Subcasing would be adding x of... within a case expression, and creating a new case expression, but one to which x would be applied.
 ​
 An example:
 ​
 foo bar = case bar of
 pure of
 Con1 -> Con1
 Con2 -> Con2
 _ -> Nothing
 ​
 This would desugar, of course, to the example above.
 ​
 Is there any potential use case for this pattern? Or is there a better way to do the stuff mentioned above?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I am clojure programmer, and i like functional programming.
 I was thinking to learn scala also, mostly for job reasons,
 if i dont use clojure, to at least use scala and write functional code.
 Ideally mainly pure functions that call each others without classes etc.
 In clojure we have namespaces and top level functions inside.
 Can i do this in Scala i read that scala 3 allows top level definitions.
 I am asking if i can do something like the bellow, that would allow scala to
 looks like clojure, and not structure code in object-oriented way
 mynamespace1
 def f1(){...}
 def f2(){...}
 mynamespace2
 import mynamespace1
 mynamespace1.f1() 
 A simple solution would be to make a class and make all methods static,
 but i dont want this, i could do that in java also.
 Also does anyone using both scala and clojure?
 Can scala become "like" clojure?
 (i dont mean the s-expressions, at least in coding style)
 Scala and clojure interop is easy?
 Thank you : )

 Currently, this is what my workflow looks like:
 Windows and workspaces are not used. If I need a new window, I open another emacs client and manage it with my TWM. If I need a new workspace, I use the TWM workspaces. I use buffers as a way to have related tasks stacked on top of each other within one area, but this utility seems fairly limited.
 I doubt emacs would have these features if they aren't useful somehow, so what do they contribute to a workflow? In other words, how would incorporating them make me more productive and efficient compared to my current workflow?
 Thanks in advance for your help!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm reading in Thinking With Types and I see
 ​
  
For example, we can prove that a × 1 = a by showing an isomorphism between (a, ()) and a.
  
​
 prodUnitTo :: a -> (a, ()) prodUnitTo a = (a, ()) 
 and
 prodUnitFrom :: (a, ()) -> a prodUnitFrom (a, ()) = a 
 It goes on to do the same with a + 0 = a being an isomorphism between Either a Void and a.
 sumUnitTo :: Either a Void -> a sumUnitTo (Left a) = a sumUnitTo (Right v) = absurd v sumUnitFrom :: a -> Either a Void sumUnitFrom = Left 
 Here () and Void are serving as monoidal identities with cardinality 1 and 0 respectively. I see the cardinality is the same -- which is the first requirement of isomorphisms -- but I'm not seeing how this proves anything -- except maybe in some category theory way I'm not yet familiar with. I'm still trying to wrap my brain around the whole sum type/disjoint set thing (See this previous discussion). I've seen unit () leveraged in Either a b, again, presumably because something of cardinality 1 and "non-reactive" is needed for a data constructor of constant value. In that post, it was for Nil. So, yes, what's the meaning of a proof like this through isomorphisms? What are we gaining with this? I got on this trail because I was still trying to grok the basic statement here about Either being the "canonical sum type." It goes on to do a recursive trick with Either to represent a sum type greater than two constructors
 data Trool = False | True | DontKnow type Trool = (Either () (Either () ())) -- i.e. Trool = 1 + (1 + 1) = 3 false :: Trool false = Left () true :: Trool true = Right (Left ()) dontKnow :: Trool dontKnow = Right (Right ()) 
 This again is leveraging unit and cardinality. And I guess it's also addressing the law of sums "pair-wise disjoint"? Any lore would be appreciated. Again, why is this proof?

Unfortunately, I need to types to work not with Double but with Num n => n. So the question is two-fold:
  
Do people know if there's a reason why Double is used in https://hackage.haskell.org/package/math-functions-0.3.4.2/docs/Numeric-SpecFunctions.html (which results in the quantile function for the normal distribution and others also being in terms of Double)
 
Is there a general solution to the problem of having a function defined on Double but wanting to abstract to a more general number type?

 It seems that no matter what dependencies I install or which configuration options I provide, my compiled Emacs will never pass a handful of the tests provided by make check-all.
 Why is this the case? Has anyone managed to run 'make check-all' without any resulting failures, and if so, how? Are the failed tests in levels above 'make check' telling me anything significant?
 --Editing to fix formatting and (hopefully) simplify my question--
 Here's the result of running make check-all after compiling with the --with-xwidgets option:
 SUMMARY OF TEST RESULTS ----------------------- Files examined: 375 Ran 5568 tests, 1 failed to run, 5456 results as expected, 13 unexpected, 99 skipped 1 files did not finish: misc/test-custom-noloads.log 7 files contained unexpected results: src/thread-tests.log lisp/progmodes/python-tests.log lisp/mail/rmailmm-tests.log lisp/emacs-lisp/cconv-tests.log lisp/cedet/srecode/fields-tests.log lisp/cedet/srecode/document-tests.log lisp/autorevert-tests.log make[2]: *** [Makefile:336: check-doit] Error 2 make[2]: Leaving directory '/home/src/emacs/emacs-28.1-tarball/emacs-28.1/test' make[1]: *** [Makefile:315: check-all] Error 2 make[1]: Leaving directory '/home/src/emacs/emacs-28.1-tarball/emacs-28.1/test' make: *** [Makefile:994: check-all] Error 2 
 All the tests that fail are performed only when I run make check-all. They aren't run for make check or make check-expensive. I'll post more information in the comments shortly.

 (defun my-org-mode-date-heading-on () "Turn on heading creation date property" (interactive) (add-hook 'org-insert-heading-hook #'set-creation-date-heading-property))
 (defun my-org-mode-date-heading-off () "Turn off heading creation date property" (interactive) (remove-hook 'org-insert-heading-hook #'set-creation-date-heading-property)) ```
 The problem it only works on a second heading. So I have to type * M-RET than remove the first heading.
 Can this be done on the creation of a new heading?
 Edit: Can this work on the org-roam-dailies-capture-today invocation? --- Solved this one
 https://karl-voit.at/2014/08/10/bookmarks-with-orgmode/ lead to 
 elisp (setq org-roam-dailies-capture-templates '(("d" "default" entry "* %?\n:PROPERTIES:\n:CREATED: %U\n:END:\n\n" :empty-lines 1 :if-new (file+head "%<%Y-%m-%d>.org" "#+title: %<%Y-%m-%d>\n"))))

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[(Disclaimer: I don't use emacs; I just have ulnar nerve entrapment from programming and discovered emacs pinky.)
 For the past 7 weeks, my pinky and ring finger have been in a constant state of "pins and needles." The onset was gradual but transitioned into being 24/7, though without pain at first. I thought it was from sleeping on my elbow - not an uncommon cause of ulnar nerve entrapment, and my doctor had me change sleeping positions. 
 I'm developing apps full time in dart and spend about 8-12 hours a day programming, 6-7 days a week. And I save, copy, paste, undo, redo, among other shortcuts all day, probably having my pinky hit the left ctrl key 1000 times a day. My typing speed was normally over 160, max 183, on 10fastfingers. 
 Look, I've rebinded left control entirely to left alt. But for some reason, it really hit me today. Suddenly, I was in so much pain that I couldn't bear to hit left ctrl. 
 I'm asking here because I'm hoping someone else has gone through recovery. I can't see a specialist for a couple of months. I'll discontinue using my small finger for shortcuts entirely, but that doesn't help me. I have a job to do now.

Sometimes I am in a mood that I am just not convenient to sit at my PC to write notes. So sitting into the couch, having a tea and just write some thoughts is the only way, I can motivate my self to writing.
I want to have my notes searchable. So the only thing I see, is to retype things at a later point of time.
Benefits: repetition and filtering

A wrapper around the Notion API, to send/receive notes.
 A small programming language, crafting interpreters seems convenient for this case.
  
I would deeply appreciate any further suggestion. Thanks in advance!

 Curious how everyone is using tags vs nodes in org roam or other backlinking systems. 
 I don’t have a good strategy right now. If I think I might need to add my own thoughts, I add a note. So my system is mostly nodes right now with a scattering of tags. 
 So for instance I ended up with a node “movies” and a tag “movies”. 
 Kinda messy. What have you found to work for you?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm working on a project with a fairly pipeline-y design. Each function in the pipeline is responsible for doing a small task, but certain parts might generate errors (Either String) mutate various forms of state, and in general may require more monad transformers all composed on top of each other.
 At first I thought it would be smart to separate it to little transformers, each one responsible for a specific behavior, and that allows each function opt in to only the behaviors it really needs. But this turns out to be awful when I want to pipeline two functions with a different monad tower, so for example with StateT I need to unpack the state and repack it at a different level.
 Is there a cleaner/more idiomatic way to approach this that I'm unaware of? Should I just have one uniform monad for all the functions? I think that's what I'm gonna have to do for now, but I'd appreciate hearing more insights.

 I am setting up my stack config.yaml file. There is a template parameter option for github-username but there doesn't seem to be a GitLab equivalent gitlab-username. 
 For the short term I can use my old GitHub account, but I recently ported the majority of my projects to GitLab and would hate to have projects split between GitLab & GitHub. Plus I know if I don't configure tools properly now, I will never do it... 
 How can I configure Stack to use GitLab rather than GitHub for user non-project defaults in ~/stack/config.yaml?
 BUT... I am new and should probably focus on learning Haskell rather than fighting tools to get a "janky" workaround for gitlab. If the solution is too cumbersome then I'll switch back to GitHub, instead.
 Thanks in advance for any help.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'd like the compiler (EDIT: the type checker) to enforce that only values from the "cloned type" will be accepted by functions that have it at its type signature. 
 So, just using the keyword type to assing an extra name is not suitable as it unfortunately is equivalent to the original type in all aspects.
 Examples of what doesn't work for my needs:
 type Code = Int
 newtype Code = Code Int
 The purpose is to achieve the same goal of creating aliases with type: make explicit the meaning of the intended values. The difference is that the usage of values of the "cloned type" would actually be made mandatory by the compiler (EDIT: by the type checker). The type signature shouldn't accept an Int in the place of Code, for instance:
 f :: Code -> String
 Another way to put the question is: 
 How can I add my own type to the special group of types that have integer literals as their values?
 The source code for Int is cryptic:
 data {-# CTYPE "HsInt" #-} Int = I# Int#
 I'm using Int here just as an example, but it could be [Char].
 ==== EDIT ====
 Disambiguation using (42 :: Code) won't be necessary when applying f.
 Although relevant in some contexts, I'm not concerned about runtime representation. The question is just about how to use literals (e.g. string or Int) directly as values of my type, i. e. without having to prepend each literal with a constructor. Exactly how we use type aliases over existing types, except by the fact that they shouldn't be interchangeable. Only when using literals they will appear the same: Instead of writing f $ Code 123, one would write f 123. Instead of writing g $ Name "John", one would write g "John". The difference will emerge when type-checking a comparison of two variables, or when type-checking the return value of a function application, etc.

It pretty much always appears super tiny to the point where my image viewer won't even zoom in for me. I mean I know they're scalable but I don't understand the default size.
 This example that I got from the docs seems to have much thicker lines around the rectangles than the output in the docs and also the letters are not at all inside the rectangles as they should be.
 ​
 #!/usr/bin/env stack 
 -- stack --resolver lts-19.0 script
 import Diagrams.Prelude import Diagrams.Backend.SVG.CmdLine import Diagrams.TwoD.Text
 eff = (text "F" <> square 1) # fontSize (local 1)

 main = mainWith example

 This is a PNG screenshot of my resulting SVG image. I'm hoping to make SVG images with Diagrams. Also I added all of the driver code my self. The imports, mainWith, the type declaration on example which was required to avoid an ambiguous type. Any of that might be misuse on my part.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone. I have a question about proper usage of Ref:
 Where other languages mutate objects, FP-languages prefer creating alternative instances to preserve referential transparency. Let's say I have a nested structure, i.e. House has Floors, Floor has Apartment, Apartment has Room, Room has LightBulb. If I change a light bulb, I obviously don't want to recreate the whole House.
 The way documentation describes Ref, its' primary goal is to help with concurrency:
  
An asynchronous, concurrent mutable reference. Provides safe concurrent access and modification of its content
  
But from my experience, it's really handy to use it just as a reference, even if there are no troubles with concurrency. In the example with House I can store references to Apartments to avoid recreating Floors and the whole House each time i have a change in an Apartment. I can just call apartmentRef.update(...) and the Floor and the House stay exactly the same.
 The question is: is it OK to do so? If so, is it bad to use it every time, let's say at each level mentioned in the House example?

 Some clarification on what I mean by the title and where I'm coming from: in general I don't think any one language is "the best," but for most languages, I can point to some aspects that it excels at, and that make it a better option than others depending on the situation. For example, if someone has no experience in programming and wants to start learning by writing working code quickly, I'd recommend Python for its readability and (apparent) simplicity.
 I've recently started learning Scala out of an interest in functional programming and how it is accomplished in languages running on the JVM. There are some aspects I really like, like the use of Option instead of Null, the fact that the syntax is familiar but 'cleaned-up' and less verbose compared to Java, performance …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I'm trying to use metals on VsCode(Code-OSS) and switch from intellij, but I'm having some issues, there is a complete lack of highlighting. The only concerning thing in the output log of metals is the warning about the build target versions, but I still expected to see some highlighting and not just a gray file. 
 I'm using the scala 2 sbt template just to check out the highlighting. I've ran the doctor and it tells me that there are issues, but I'm boggled at what I need to look at. I've disable all other extensions.
 It's crazy to think that metals would not run on Code-OSS, but I think that the issue is just on my side. 
 I've attached some pictures, I've followed the instructions in the metals docs, can someone tell me what to look at?

 So I have things to do at a certain date, and their place is clearly in the calendar, to show up for the day. Maybe an advanced warning, a couple of days before.
 Than I have things that I have to get done, but they are not anchored to some date, so they get into the TODO.
 So far so good. How about items that are IN WAITING. Say I request I have to repeat if there is no answer. Or a refund request? Or anything that doesn't neatly fit into either of the above.
 How would you handle these indefinite tasks?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've just watched this video by Richard Eisenberg, who says that automatic eta expansion is bad because it changes program semantics, giving the example that:
 map (\x -> f (fib 25) x) [1, 2, 3] 
 performs much worse than
 map (f (fib 25)) [1, 2, 3] 
 But isn't a better eta expansion of the latter simply the following?
 map (let tmp = fib 25 in \x -> f tmp x) [1, 2, 3] 
 This way no sharing is lost. And I think the semantics is preserved. So doesn't this solve the problem?
 Maybe there are more problems with eta expansion for deep subsumption than shown in the video, though.

From my (cursory) tests of the package knob-0.2, it seems that in order to allow the user to pass such a wrapper to standard library functions like System.IO.hGetLine is suffices to provide BufferedIO, IODevice and RawIO, but, as pointed out in this SO thread (see this comment), this alone will not enable me to ever redirect any of the three 'std' streams to a knob-backed handle by means of a call to GHC.IO.Handle.hDuplicateTo because hDuplicateTo can only operate on handles referencing devices of the same type―the code listed in the comment linked above fails with "illegal operation" because the type of the device associated with the handle h (in terms of Data.Typeable.typeOf) is Data.Knob.Device (see https://hackage.haskell.org/package/knob-0.2/docs/src/Data.Knob.html#Device) and stdout is backed by a regular file descriptor (FD). Is there any way to circumvent this without modifying GHC?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm using line-prefix to give a little bit of space between the line numbers enabled by display-line-numbers-mode and my code, but it causes the unfortunate issue of the first tab being "shortened" by a space.
 This is because, when you enter a tab in emacs, the tab inserts space to the "tab stop" (not the tab stop set by tab-stop-list, but some kind of internal rendering value), and the space added by line-prefix doesn't move the internal tab stops, just adds a space at the beginning of the line, so it's the same as if you entered a space then a tab -- your indentation level is still only tab-width deep.
 I'm happy to just use spaces for indentation for my personal projects, but when collaborating with others I'll have to use tabs in some cases, so I'd like to find a solution to this problem. I've tried setting line-prefix to a tab, but even with tab-width 2, that's a bit too much.
 Alternatively, I'm happy with any other way to add a space between the display-line-numbers section and my code.

 Part of this process is re-filing stuff I captured during different points in the week. For this I use bulk remote editing agenda commands (m to select multiple headings, then B and r to refile). This works very well.
 The only issue I have is that the agenda is rebuild after each (bulk) refile, which takes a while (10~15 seconds every time). It does take long but not forever, but it is already annoying although I am rather new to org and my files are not that large.
 Is there an option/command/prefix/hack I am missing that allows me to prevent the rebuild of the agenda every time?
 As plan B, is there another/better way to refile several entries at the same time that does not involve agendas?
 ---
 I noticed that the agenda is not re-build when I archive a heading (using a in the agenda view). I guess this is because the command predictably removes the heading from the agenda. Since my refiles are also doing that, this is in theory similar.
 ---
 I found this thread in which I learned that
  
If you give a triple prefix argument to org-agenda-refile, the agenda will not be rebuilt.
  
Which is great, and good to know, but does not help me, since I want to keep using bulk actions.
 Thanks!

 I want to use material theme with org mode but I use links in some headlines, and that combination shows terribly (see image).

 Anyone knows how to fix it? I thought some way of having the headline style override the link style would do (no idea how to do that though).
 Any help is much appreciated.

 stack new website yesodweb/sqlite
 Everything fine so far. Opened up VS Code, waited for GHC installation and so on.
 But when I try to use features like showing me function definitions or the type of my own defined functions nothing happens. I looked into the logs, the Haskell extension complains it can't determine reverse dependencies? Very helpfull error message.
 So I go look it up, aha, stack and HLS don't like each other, I am supposed to use cabal instead. But. No meantion on how to convert a "stack project" properly. So I deleted .stack-work and the stack.yaml stuff. Still not working.
 Like, come on. Haskell has a steep learning curve as is. It's hard for people to get started. Shouldn't there at least be a little focus on making shit work, so that people that want to get started don't just turn their back because it's not even straight forward to get started editing files?
 Does someone have a single website, works as is guide about setting up some editor for proper support (VS code preferred)? I'm one Google search away from going back to another language. It's just frustrating.

 in a textbook and can't figure out what's actually happening. AFAIK, a Haskell list comprehension seems to be sort of a Cartesian product machine -- at least when there are two generators; e.g., if you give it [(x,y) | x <- [1,2], y <- [1,2]] , it "magically" knows to give you back the Cartesian product [(1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2)] -- or it somehow just knows to treat this as a nested loop and build tuples. So with the original example, somehow each of the elements of [1,2,3] is being "crossed" with False, right? Or is something else going on?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been using org-wild-notifier (within Spacemacs) for a while and I realized it was actually draining my laptop batter quite a bit. The core reason is that once a minute it spawns a separate emacs instance that has to initialize a bunch of things and actually (re)open all org agenda files I already had opened and regenerate org-agenda.
 Which led me to dig around and look at https://github.com/jwiegley/emacs-async (which wild-notifier uses) and then read a bit about https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/NoThreading.
 I also went through https://orgmode.org/worg/agenda-optimization.html a bit (I only have a few agenda files and they are not huge, though I am toying with the idea of testing cleanup to see how much it would help)
 Ultimately though, it feel like the emacs-async use in this case will always cause slowdowns. Doing some profiling - even the call to package-initialize in org-wild-notifier--retrieve-events takes a sizeable chunk of CPU.
 These seem like wasted cycles, my emacs instance already has the org files open and all the packages needed loaded.
 So, finally my question is - am I the only one that is bothered by this? Do people not want/need notifications generally? Or not get hit by the battery drain for some reason? How do others deal with getting notifications before events/tasks are scheduled/planned?
 I looked a bit at https://github.com/legalnonsense/org-timed-alerts and I like the approach using org-ql potentially nice(r). Especially with caching and all of that... But the package doesn't seem maintained anymore so I think it's a dead end?
 Alternatively would changing wild-notifier to use emacs threads potentially solve/improve this? (at the cost of newer emacs version requirement).
 Any other suggestions (other than trying to cleanup my org agenda files)?
 Edit: Fix double spaced-paragraphs

Therefore, I would appreciate any suggestions!
 Here are the materials we have so far in the announcement :
  
We suggest you start by watching this video: 
 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqi0Xu2Enaw 
 Then have a look at these posts and discussions: 
 https://serokell.io/blog/10-reasons-to-use-haskell 
 http://stackoverflow.com/questions/775726/whats-the-fuss-about 
 http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3175656/why-should-i-want-to-learn-haskell 
 If you want to know more about the basic motivation behind Haskell and functional programming in general, listen to what the founding fathers of Haskell have to say: 
 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSmkqocn0oQ
  
Video in the first link is great content-wise, but it feels and looks really old, so I don't think it leaves great impression on young students.
 Serokell blog post is great, I think, new and concise, I am happy with that one.
 Stack overflow discussions are motivating and inspiring, but both are almost 10 years old.
 Last video is nice, but also dated.
 Ideally, finding a replacement video for the first one, but newer, would be great, and possibly some newer discussions / blog posts!

 I'm what we could call a heavy-power-user of Notion (and Anytype in a certain way, as an alpha user of the app). 
 Both of these apps use an object-is-a-note oriented approach, meaning that each new note created can be referenced in other notes, creating a network of notes (or thoughts, depending on how you see it). Notion implements this (in a convoluted manner, IMHO) with what they call "databases", which is a table view of all objects of a certain type (i.e.: all note of type "Human" are contained in the database "Humans"). I really like this type of atomic implementation because it makes the process of creating new notes and working on existing notes quite straight-foward (simple workflow = easier maintenance of the system).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm a beginner with Megaparsec and Haskell in general, and trying to write a parser for the following grammar:
  
A word will always be one of:
  
 A number composed of one or more ASCII digits (ie "0" or "1234") OR
 A simple word composed of one or more ASCII letters (ie "a" or "they") OR
 A contraction of two simple words joined by a single apostrophe (ie "it's" or "they're")
  
So far, I've got the following (this can probably be simplified):
 data Word = Number String | SimpleWord String | Contraction String deriving (Show) word :: Parser MyParser.Word word = M.choice [ Number <$> number , Contraction <$> contraction , SimpleWord <$> simpleWord ] number :: Parser String number = M.some C.numberChar simpleWord :: Parser String simpleWord = M.some C.letterChar contraction :: Parser String contraction = do left <- simpleWord void $ C.char '\'' right <- simpleWord return (left ++ "'" ++ right) 
 But I'm having problem with defining a parser for skipping white spaces and anything that is non-alphanumeric. For example, given the input 'abc', the parser should discard the apostrophes and just take the "simple word".
 The following doesn't compile:
 filler :: Parser Char filler = M.some (C.spaceChar A.<|> not C.alphaNumChar) spaceConsumer :: Parser () spaceConsumer = L.space filler A.empty A.empty lexeme :: Parser a -> Parser a lexeme = L.lexeme spaceConsumer

 We are migrating the services to use tapir instead of the akka-http dsl, which makes tracing much easier from my point of view.
 The project is still in a very preliminary stage, despite we use it in production and it's working.

Is the old one going to be eventually phased out and removed in the upcoming versions? It might be weird but I honestly preferred the curly braces.
 Sorry if it's a dumb question. I have just started to learn Scala and I don't really know much about the language yet.

 (global-set-key (kbd "C-c uni") (lambda () (interactive) (insert "universe"))) 
 Now if I press C-c and type uni, the word universe is inserted to the buffer.
 But this key binding does not work:
 (global-set-key (kbd ":uni") (lambda () (interactive) (insert "universe"))) 
 If I compile this, I get error:
 Debugger entered--Lisp error: (error "Key sequence : u n i starts with non-prefix key :") 
 How can I make a successful key binding for :uni?
 Yes, I know this is going to interfere with typing literal : in the text and I find with that for now because I am still learning what is possible and what is not possible.

 When it comes to a table of contents, the time stamp takes space, and is irrelevant, yet I want to have it, I want to know at what time I started writing that, maybe how long it took.
 With orgmode I have the chance of having a drawer with the note and its heading. And probably there are other ways I am not aware of to store a time stamp.
 How would you do? In a way that will satisfy all conditions - get the time stamp out of the way - still know when the note was taken - get the agenda anchor for the note

 Should I rely on searching tools when I re-watch a film and want to add some more data?
 Or it would be more practical to have an index file, with a lot of headings, each a link to the actual file with the review?
 I guess book reviews would be the same only a different folder / index. How do you handle this sort of case, with many files?

 The current structure is pretty much a YAML heading like this:
 ```yaml
 title : L'art dans le sang (2021) year : 2021 name : francais : L'art dans le sang english : Affairs of the Art date : 2022-03-29 14:04 language : url : - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGk0KBWew58 - https://letterboxd.com/film/affairs-of-the-art/ - https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/742843/
  - http://www.imdb.com/title/tt14293560/
 The actual review / notes. ```
 Nothing fancy.
 How do I fit this data in an org file?
 Should it be a drawer?
 Should it be a YAML block?
 Is there a text database in orgmode, where I can fit these fields?

Basically for any website, e.g. arxiv.org, there is a translator that describes how to get the bibliographic data from the url. I wanted to use these translators in my Emacs setup and I came across Zotero translation server. So I wrote a few functions to bridge between the translation server and Emacs.
 Now I have a bookmark in my browser that I can click to automatically export the bibtex citation of the webpage to my default bib file, basically like a Zotero connector for Emacs. Thought this might be useful for others, so here it is:

 ```
 +BEGIN_EXPORT latex
 \tcbox{\includegraphics[width=13cm]{./Pictures/picture1.png}}
 +END_EXPORT
 `` For HTML I just have a regular[[./Pictures/picture1.png]]` which works just fine and I edit it with a CSS file. 
 When I export to HTML there isn't a problem because the LATEX code doesn't show up on the HTML page. When I export to PDF/Latex though, the image shows up twice. Once without borders and once with. What I am looking to do is set this up so that I can export the same document to PDF, and HTML without having to edit one of those files. 
 Right now I am editing the given Latex file to get rid of the excess picture. 
 I read the manual and saw the #+ATTR_LATEX: which I could put before the image but couldn't figure out how to get the frame around the photo with that. Thoughts?
 Also, I tried adding code to get the image for HTML only which I figured would solve my problem but that code shows up in the HTML, and Latex export.
 Edit: Found my answer! ```
 +LATEX_HEADER: \usepackage[most]{tcolorbox}
 +LATEX_HEADER: \let\includegraphicsold\includegraphics
 +LATEX_HEADER: \renewcommand{\includegraphics}[2][]{\tcbox{\includegraphicsold[#1]{#2}}}
 ``` That way the default images act in the way I had with the code above! I just had to put that at the top of my file.

I know I would have to move to scala js, but not regular scala. That's fine. Okay, I know this question maybe subjective, and most people won't like it. Please be kind, I request. 
 What after learning scala? Something more important that this, approximately, how much scala is enough to move towards my goal? Scala learning resources are really less. I know noone is gonna suggest me to do take go and scala as first languages. But I'm in love with them, trust me. Please guide me the path. I'll be thankful.

For example, if i have three files named introduction.md, development.md and ending.md, I would like to have this in the merged org file: 
  
introduction.md

ending.md

 And being able to fold them as in any org file.
 Is this possible?

As nice as it would be to clean up the formatting, right now I'm just trying to get it to work, and it messes up my workflow to have tons of newlines added every time I add a closing bracket. Here's a gif of what I'm talking about:
 https://i.redd.it/xai1fe7c7v991.gif
 How can I disable this behavior?
 ​
 Edit: further testing seems to indicate that this is caused by the language server (ccls). If I disable lsp-managed-mode, the behavior stops. Also, if I leave lsp-managed-mode enabled and wrap the statement in #if false ... #endif, the line breaks aren't added either. Still not sure if there's a way to disable just this function without disabling the language server altogether.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m investing the plausibility of a testing for an “app” that is basically a complicated ETL process. 
 The “architecture” of this app: all of my external state is memoized in this DataAccess class, which provides functions to access different sets of data. Each function returns a sequence of case classes representing the data source that has been fetched from the database. 
 The “half baked idea” is: What if “whenever something interesting happens” I could deserialize this DataAccess class and replay the test data through the latest version of the app for debugging and testing purposes. 
 Does anyone have any kind of experience with such a pattern? What tools did you consider to help with the “snapshotting” (serialization and deserialization)? Where did you persist your snapshots?
 Some considerations: 1. There are about a hundred different case classes available through various functions in the DataAccess class 2. The “amount” of data is large. So while I view storage cost as essentially free, serialization / deserialization performance (primarily deserialization) is a concern
 A few options I could think of are: 1. A database, either a “real database” or perhaps some kind of in-memory database 2. Serializing to disk storage on some server in ProtoBuf, Mempack, Csv, json etc. 3. ???

 Wondering if anyone's using Emacs for incremental reading. It's sort of like using spaced repetition for progressively getting through challenging content. Much more on supermemo wiki: https://www.supermemo.wiki/en/learning/incremental-reading
 To facilitate incremental reading in Emacs I'm trying org-noter which is amazing but sadly hasn't been maintained in recent years.
 There's also annotate.el which Im going to try.
  
Is anyone using emacs/orgmode for incremental reading?
 Are there any other annotation packages that I'm missing?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I spent some time this weekend writing up an alpha version of some ideas I had about command line option parsing as a haskell package: cyclops.
 To start, if you're looking for a robust and full-featured option parser, cyclops isn't that yet. Let me recommend optparse-applicative and optparse-generic, which are both great.
 The Big Idea of cyclops is to support a declarative option-parsing style (just say what arguments you expect, rather than how to parse it) while keeping the option description as close as possible to the variable bind location.
 To that end, it uses ViewPatterns and TypeApplications with DataKinds to pass option specifications backwards from the bind location using type inference.
 main = do ( switch @'["d", "debug"] @"Show debugging statements" -> debug ,flagged @'["dictionary"] @"PATH" @"File to draw words from" .defaultTo @"--dictionary /usr/share/dict/words" -> dictionaryPath ,option @'["s", "seed"] @"NUM" @"Seed value for PRNG" .readable -> seed ,arg @"count" @"Number of passwords to generate" .readable -> count ,arg @"template" @"Template for generated passwords" .oneOrMore .defaultTo @"w w w w" -> template ) <- getOps Conf { description = "Generate pseudorandom passwords using a template." , version = "1.0.0.20220702" } 
 Type inference places some constraints not visible in the above example code - if seed is inferred to be an Int by how it's used in the rest of the code, then that's how it getOps will attempt to parse --option 123.
 This release isn't really ready for primetime yet, but if you like the basic concept, let me know, and I'll keep working it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all! So I am receiving a ByteString for which I know TextEncoding, and I would like to decode it into Text. I see that TextEncoding has mkTextDecoder field, but I haven't managed so far to figure out how to construct the correct types to use it -> any help is welcome!
 So ideally, I wold like to implement following function: hs decodeEncoding :: TextEncoding -> ByteString -> IO Text 
 I got this far: ```hs decodeEncoding :: TextEncoding -> ByteString -> IO Text decodeEncoding E.TextEncoding{ E.mkTextDecoder = mkDecoder } bs = do
 -- Cheat sheet: -- - mkTextDecoder :: IO (TextDecoder dstate) -- - type TextDecoder state = BufferCodec Word8 Char state -- - encode :: BufferCodec -> CodeBuffer from to -- - type CodeBuffer from to -- = Buffer from -- -> Buffer to -- -> IO (CodingProgress, Buffer from, Buffer to) decoder <- mkDecoder let from = error "I don't know how to construct this Buffer from the bytestring" let to = error "I don't know how to initialize this Buffer" (progress, from', to') <- E.encode (decoder enc) from to return to' -- I don't know how to transform to' from Buffer into Text. 
 ```

 The sum of these multiples is 78.
  
I've a solution previously written in Rust that I now want to convert to Haskell. The solution uses Sieve of Eratosthenes to find all the factors of a given number. The implementation uses a binary heap.
 In Haskell, this is turning out to be an incredibly frustrating problem to solve because of the state to be maintained, and various conditional actions to be taken depending on the state.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I am trying to figure out a good workflow for Emacs + ESS for R. For interactive data analysis it's nice to make a lot of plots and RStudio has a nice panel for these. But ESS, at least by default, uses X, which is not nice:
 - plotting happens in the XQuartz application, which means that I need to switch out of Emacs and requires a whole bunch of keypresses and thought that I don't want to deal with; at most a window (or multiple as appropriate) should open which I close it with cmd-w and return to emacs, without having to switch applications.
 - plots aren't interactive. In python, for example, you can adjust the plot and save it from the figure window (although the plot window also switches apps and for that reason is not ideal).
 Is this the standard R plotting workflow on macOS (or for that matter Linux)? How do people handle making a lot of plots, on the fly, using ESS? Any other related workflow tips are also helpful. Thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone, after intensive testing i just released my first library on hackage!
 Interval Tree Clocks - They serve as an alternative to vector clocks, which are a concept to track logical time. In distributed contexts, comparison by timestamps might be skewed. 
 Vector clocks and version vectors however have the weakness of "actor explosion" because you cannot remove traces of an actor that might be long gone. They only allow you to increment the version vector in length.
 Interval tree clocks solve this by managing a tree-representation of said vector clock. With interval tree clocks you can dynamically add (fork) or remove (join) actors / replicas from your system and have your versions grow and shrink accordingly, while still holding the monotonically increasing semantics.
 They can similarly be used as either version vectors or vector clocks.
 I have thoroughly tested the code. Nonetheless if you are an expert on the topic, I'd love to get your criticism. Nevertheless, because it's my first library, I appreciate all and any feedback I can get.
 Hope this helps you build distributed systems some day!

 I'm learning Haskell by doing the 2016 Advent of Code with it, and I have a few common functions I use nearly every 'day', so I wrote a Common.hs file, starting with:
 moudule Common ( takeUntil , dropUntil , linesToList ) where 
 When I try to import it, however, ghc gives me this error:
 Common.hs:1:1: error: File name does not match module name: Saw: ‘Main’ Expected: ‘Common’ | 1 | moudule Common | ^ 
 From what I've seen online, this is the correct way to do it.
 Looking it up only yielded "check your formatting", which I certainly did.
 What am I doing wrong?

 :weekly_template: HABIT TRACKER ============ M T W T F S S Meditation [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] Yoga [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] Exercise [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] MIT's (Most Important Tasks) ========================= • [ ] 8 hours of hobby work • [ ] 5 hours of reading • [ ] 12 hours of content creation (videos, posts, texts) • [ ] etc Tasks (TODOs) =========== • [ ] Task 1 • [ ] Task 2 • [ ] Task 3 • [ ] Task 4 • [ ] Task 5 :end: 
 I am wondering how I can set up time-tracking for those MIT's that include hourly metric. If there was a way to start-stop a time counter manually on a given MIT and also see the total time accumulated on that activity, then that could work. I shall appreciate any other suggestions as well.

 ​
 import time for i in range(10): time.sleep(0.5) print(i, end="\r") 
 to my python interpreter, I would like to see in "buf-out" the sequence of numbers from 0 to 9 overwrite each other every half-second. Essentially, I want to see in "buf-out" exactly what I would see in the shell after pressing RET. Is there a way to do this? I tried with comint-redirect but it does not interpret the carriage return, and it also displays the ">>>" prompt that gets printed after the code finishes running.

 I can't seem to search from stackage/hackage packages anymore. When I input a search it adds a filter for haskell-platform which evidently only includes libraries shipped with GHC. I don't see a way to remove this filter; even if I remove &scope=set%3Ahaskell-platform from the URI it doesn't work.
 For example, my query for lookupGetParam in Yesod doesn't work: link.
 Was there some change to Hoogle? Am I doing my queries wrong (they worked before)?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I have a strange problem with my org-agenda, the view for TODO items in particular.
 I have set
 ```
 ((setq org-directory "~/org")
 (setq org-agenda-files "~/org/agenda")
 ```
 Now, I have several files in the folder ~/org/agenda. Namely inbox.org with items from my cellphone using beorg and personal-cal.org and personal-caldav-inbox.org.
 When I put a new first level heading into personal-cal.org or personal-caldav-inbox.org, and tag it with TODO, the items appears in the org-agenda TODO list. When I put the same heading into inbox.org (or any other file I added for testing) it does not.
 I also tried to copy personal-cal.org and put the TODO item in the copy, still it does not appear. So it does not seem to be something inside the files that make them special, it is rather that I somehow set up emacs to only look inside those two files for TODO items.
 But how? The only time I even mention those two files in my config is in the config for caldav:
 ```
 (setq org-caldav-calendars
 '((:calendar-id "personal" :files ("~/org/agenda/personal-cal.org")
 :inbox "~/org/agenda/personal-caldav-inbox.org")
 )
 )
 ```
 I commented those two lines but this does not change anything for the TODO list.

 // nevermind, I found it

 stack install --ghc-options "-optl-static -fPIC" 
 I get a bunch of warnings in the shape of:
 statically linked applications requires at runtime the shared libraries from the glibc version used for linking 
 The build ends up fine, but then when running the executable from a container it fails to connect to sibling container (all run from docker-compose), issuing errors of the likes of: 
 Network.Socket.getAddrInfo (called with preferred socket type/protocol: AddrInfo {addrFlags = [AI_ADDRCONFIG,AI_NUMERICHOST,AI_PASSIVE], addrFamily = AF_UNSPEC, addrSocketType = Datagram, addrProtocol = 0, addrAddress = 0.0.0.0:0, addrCanonName = Nothing}, host name: Just "10.89.0.1", service name: Just "domain"): does not exist (Servname not supported for ai_socktype) 
 Any idea how I can either successfully link the aforementioned glibc libraries at build time or at least depend on the runtime in the way expected by the executable? First time I get my hands on static build, sorry if the question comes off naive.

On Mac
 Using Stack
 Working on a preprocessor/plugin that I'm dogfeeding in the same test suite (can try reproing by cloning: https://github.com/brandonchinn178/tasty-autocollect)
  
When I run stack purge and then run stack test multiple times consecutively, it doesnt rebuild, as expected. But then if I make a change and run stack test multiple times, itll rebuild the first time as expected, but then rebuild the entire test suite every subsequent time as well.
 When diffing the dylib in between each run (with otool -l) the only thing that changes is the timestamp. 1. Why does stack (or ghc) introduce a dependency on a dylib? 2. Is this a stack or ghc thing? If I were to ticket upstream, which project should I ticket with? 3. Why does the dylib not change the first time, but change every time after the first change?

 I know the MVC pattern from frameworks like laravel in php. Is this pattern also used in functional programming? If so, do you also call "services" in your controllers? So the only difference is handling business logic in a functional way?
 Do you have any book recommendations for beginners on something like "functional architectures"/ "functional design patterns"? (any language is okay, I just want to get a basic grasp of it).

I wanted to see what paradigms I would have to use to create proper Haskell code. I was thinking it might help me get out of the Object-Oriented bubble, and maybe become a better programmer in general.
 I have some doubts from what I saw till now:
 - The idea of **modules** seems similar to classes in C++. Where the exposed functions are publically available and rest are not. Isn't this an object-oriented feature?
 - Which tutorials/books would you recommend?
 - My final target is to be able to create a application/project using Haskell. Which type of applications are best suited for Haskell?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm using a phantom type to distinguish between data that's undergone some form of normalization from data that has not. A simplified example:
 data Normalized data Denormalized class Normalize x where type Normalization x normalize :: x -> Normalization x -- 'Foo' uses phantom type n to track whether normalization has been applied. data Foo n = Foo String -- Normalizing a 'Foo' that has already been 'Normalized' is a no-op. instance Normalize (Foo Normalized) where type Normalization (Foo Normalized) = Foo Normalized normalize = id -- Normalizing a 'Foo' that has not already been normalized transforms the String. instance Normalize (Foo Denormalized) where type Normalization (Foo Denormalized) = Foo Normalized normalize (Foo s) = Foo (map toUpper s) -- A smart constructor produces a 'Foo' with no normalization applied mkFoo :: String -> Foo Denormalized mkFoo = Foo 
 By exporting mkFoo but not the Foo data constructor, I can prevent users of this library from manually constructing a value of type Foo Normalized. Instead, they're forced to do something like:
 normalize (mkFoo "x") 
 However, it seems they could still circumvent normalization via coerce:
 coerce (mkFoo "x") :: Foo Normalized 
 The documentation for Coercible seems to suggest this should not be the case, given that the Foo data constructor is not in scope, but playing around with it in ghci I'm finding I can perform this undesirable coercion.
 For now, I've added a type role annotation to prevent such coercion,
 type role Foo nominal 
 but I'm curious to know why coerce is working otherwise, despite the fact that the Foo data constructor is not in scope. (Also curious to know if there's a cleaner way to implement this whole thing in general.)

 I would like to use Emacs for writing Turtle and since ttl-mode is a bit basic, I'd like to give LSP/turtle-language-server a try.
 I have lsp-mode and lsp-ui up and running, which works reasonably fine for the languages with built-in support in lsp-mode.
 However turtle-language-server is not initially supported by lsp-mode, so how do I manually connect the language server with lsp-mode? 
 (The message I get from lsp-mode says to look at lsp-java/lsp-metals for examples of manual setup, but I think this is deprecated)

 There's a couple of neat features in it which I think will be of interest from a Scala perspective -- there's nothing groundbreaking, but whenever anything goes unexpectedly right I like to make a note of it.
 The first is that implicits are relative to a field builder, a factory defined on the logger, and that field builder is an input to a function that builds the argument for the logging statement:
 trait SomeFieldBuilder extends FieldBuilder { implicit val fooToValue: ToValue[Foo] = ... } object SomeFieldBuilder extends SomeFieldBuilder val logger: Logger[SomeFieldBuilder] = LoggerFactory.getLogger.withFieldBuilder(SomeFieldBuilder) val myFoo: Foo = ... logger.…]]></summary>

 Deleting the file is easy, but of course emacs recreates #shell# for me. How can I remove the association from buffer to the file, turning it back into a file-less shell buffer? 
 I've found searching for this leads only suggestions to kill the buffer (sure, but there has to be a better way) or very basic how-to for file and buffer deletion.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I saw the other day this initiative Give Up Github. I think it makes sense for open source or free source communities to think about their continued usage of Github. 
 I won't repeat the article but just mention Copilot, the AI code completion tool that was trained on many public projects on Github and as of last week, became a commercial, for-profit product. There is no license attribution, there is no legal precedence, there is no public dataset release (which means we don't know how many or what projects were used) and there is the small percentage of cases in which verbatim code is generated. 
 I realize how Github is central for my FOSS projects. In a sense, Github is a walled garden, enjoying a huge network effect. It will take an effort to move to other solutions. Personally, I'm going to try SourceHut, I think it's very promising.
 What do you think?

 Today, I discovered a function of IntelliJ: "Move refactoring" (https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/move-refactorings.html#move_refactoring).
 In Golang for example, moving a folder inside a project will automatically update all reference to the package and modify all the necessary imports.
 Researching a bit, I found out this is probably a function of the LSP server. I found lsp-rename which allow renaming a function in the whole project but I couldn't find equivalent to the "Move refactoring" function of IntelliJ, which would allow moving a folder in one go.
 Is there anyway to achieve this in Emacs?
 Thank you!

 https://gerrit.googlesource.com/git-repo/
  
from the google page:
 Repo is a tool built on top of Git. Repo helps manage many Git repositories, does the uploads to revision control systems, and automates parts of the development workflow. Repo is not meant to replace Git, only to make it easier to work with Git. The repo command is an executable Python script that you can put anywhere in your path.
  
The name of is somewhat unfortunate as it makes it difficut to find information about it.
 We used it at work to manage the whole build that is made op interconnected builds that are developed and worked on by multile persons and teams. 
 I wonder if someone here has any experience of using magit together with this?

 When I accept an invitation the event on an email client (even a non-MS one), the event is automatically added to my calendar and I think an email is sent to the event organizer.

I press E after entering the Edebug mode to open a new buffer where, according to the manual, I can type expressions that will get evaluated every time I Edebug updates. However, it seems Edebug still recognizes commands even in the *edebug* window. If I try to type the name of a variable 'lang', when I type 'a' it aborts Edebug and I have to start again from scratch. Is there an option to disable this behavior when I go to the *edebug* window? Or do I have to write everything in *scratch* and copy it over?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dear Emacs community,
 I’m happy user of Dell XPS 15 on PopOS as an operating system (Gnome X11 with Nvidia support ISO variant). 
 Since I got this laptop, I started using Emacs (best decision of my life in terms of tooling).
 First it was Spacemacs then Emacs Doom and finally I have hand crafted my own configuration (never been so proud and satisfied with Emacs as I’m now). I was also using different versions of Emacs: 27, 28 and recent master with pgtk enabled then disabled.
 I was also experimenting with different Linux + GNU operating systems, but whatever I try I’m unable to get rid of Emacs flickering, cursor jumps and buffer/windows switching when using Dell’s built-in keyboard (using external keyboard solves the issue). It sometimes looks like Emacs would undo and redo buffer switch/window switch multiple times or randomly remove/insert the text I just wrote. :O
 I can also reproduce this behavior in plain Emacs (emacs -Q). I’m not having this issue with applications other than Emacs, so it’s rather isolated case. 
 Have you ever experienced anything like that? Your help is most welcome. Cheers! 
 Emacs Forever!!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, I have a few modules for my value objects such as Username and Email, and usually their modules look like this:
 ``` module Auth.Username where newtype Username = Username String
 data UsernameParseError = UsernameTooShort | UsernameTooLong
 parseUsername :: (MonadError UsernameParseError m) => String -> m Username parseUsername u = undefined -- logic here ```
 The problem I am facing is that I need to parse a record
  data SignUpRequest = SignUpRequest { username :: String , email :: String } 
 to this:
  data Parsed = Parsed { username :: Username , email :: Email } 
 and in the function that does the parsing, I don't know what to put for the error type:
  signUp :: (MonadError ??? m) => SignUpRequest -> m Parsed 
 because there are two possible errors here: UsernameParseError and EmailParseError.
 What I'm looking for, is to do something like this:
  data SignUpError = ParseError (UsernameParseError | EmailParseError) | SomeOtherError ??? 
 but of course, that's not possible.
 The only solution I can see is by wrapping the types one by one:
  data SignUpError = UsernameParseError' UsernameParseError | EmailParseError' EmailParseError | SomeOtherError ??? 
 but that's obviously ridiculous, especially if I have way more fields.
 So, what's the best way of doing what I'm trying to do?
 I am aware I could just create a datatype ParseError:
  newtype ParseError = ParseError { reason :: String } 
 and make everything just return ParseError.
 And, since most of the times I'll just be sending the response as JSON to the client anyways, it doesn't matter that it is a string.
 However, sometimes, it is valuable to know what exactly is the error so I could act on it (recovery, etc.).
 So, what's the best way of doing what I'm trying to do?
 
 I know of Scala's shapeless library, which use coproducts to solve this problem. I'm new to the Haskell world so I'm not sure if there is an equivalent.
 Thanks

 Eg. I have a list of documents match some criterion and I am usually adding documents and removing them programmatically.

It would be easy if the function calls and paramters which update the view could be attached to the view display and update it automatically.

 The company is Jotron AS, we make air traffic control software.
 At the moment, we don't use haskell much (it's just me) but management sees the benefits. I'm currently about to embark on a project to do with analytics of air traffic data, and we would like to do it in haskell, but I'll need a buddy.
 If anyone is intrested, message me and I can try and give more details. But don't worry if your experience is limited. If you are young enough, there is a high chance the company will fund a masters and parts of the project will be the thesis, so plenty of opportunity to train.
 I'm sorry I can't give more details. My boss and I just need info about what's possible when it comes to hiring so that we can plan how we can do this.

 My display template is this:

 It used to be perfectly fine. I was guessing that an emoji in one of the document titles or filenames must have screwed it, but after removing those, the problem still persists.

 Edit
 Here is the manual related to this:
  
If you’re using a vertical completion framework, such as Ivy and Selectrum, Org-roam supports the generation of an aligned, tabular completion interface.
  
Btw: I am using "ivy"
 https://www.orgroam.com/manual.html / 5.5 Customizing Node Completions
 Edit 2
 The problem is gone, all of a sudden. I don't even know what caused it. Maybe it was one of those emoji characters in one of the node-names.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I made an elisp function for parsing some org table-like data in a buffer. My function scans each line of the buffer, and depending on the characters at the start of the line, it jumps to a certain point in the line and inserts some text. The relevant part of the function is below:
 (beginning-of-buffer) (while (not (eobp)) (cond ((looking-at header-re-1) (search-forward marker1 nil nil count1) (insert text1)) ((looking-at header-re-2) (search-forward marker2 nil nil count2) (insert text2)) ((looking-at header-re-3) (search-forward marker3 nil nil count3) (insert text3)) (t)) (forward-line)) 
 My function works okay, but it seems a little inelegant, because the cond consists of three blocks of looking-at followed by search-forward followed by insert, only with different arguments each time. Is there a more clever way to do this that only needs one call to looking-at, search-forward, and insert, using something like, say pcase?

By default, unused variables and things such as unused python imports show by default as a grey foreground with green wavy underline. I'd like to customize this, however customizing the face does not work. After looking into it, it seems to be set by lsp-mode's lsp-diagnostic-attributes list. However, I have not been able to find a solution that works for customizing it so I can remove the green wavy underline. Customizing lsp-lsp-flycheck-info-unnecessary-face had no effect, and the follow did not work which was the only solution I could find:
 (add-to-list 'lsp-diagnostics-attributes '(unnecessary :background "dark gray")) 
 Has anyone had any success customizing this and would be able to point me towards a solution?

  (use-package modus-themes :config (modus-themes-load-themes) (modus-themes-load-operandi)) (custom-theme-set-faces 'modus-operandi '(org-block ((t (:background "#cfd8dc"))))) (custom-theme-set-faces 'modus-operandi '(org-block-begin-line ((t (:background "#cfd8dc"))))) (custom-theme-set-faces 'modus-operandi '(org-block-end-line ((t (:background "#cfd8dc"))))) 
 Starting emacs, I get the desired effect: nicely colored org src blocks. But if I re-load the config (which a do with a keybinding that calls (load-file "personal-config.el")) the customization is no longer applied. Inspecting the org-block face, it shows the background to be unspecified. 
 This emacs.stackechange question proposes a solution but it seems weird to me to handle things this way. Can anyone explain why this happens? It feels as though reloading the config shouldn't cause this to happen. Nor should changing themes with the theme-looper package with just wraps disabling one theme and enabling the next into a single command. 
 I just noticed that if I:
 1. reload emacs config
 2. eval the custom-theme-set-faces
 3. enable modus-operandi 
 then the colored org blocks appear again. I commented out everything in my init apart from bootstrapping use-package and this portion setting up the themes and the early-init that does stuff like inhibiting the startup screen and turning off the menu bar, tool bar, and scroll bar.

 ``` (defun setup-ui () "Modifies user interface." (global-linum-mode) (set-face-attribute 'default nil :height 200)
 (let ((packages '("apropospriate-theme"))) (mapc #'(lambda (package) (unless (package-installed-p package) (package-install package))) packages) ) )
 (require 'package) (add-to-list 'package-archives '("melpa" . "https://melpa.org/packages/") t) (package-initialize) (package-refresh-contents) ```
 But when I start emacs theme installation fails with Package ‘apropospriate-theme-’ is unavailable. Why there is a trailing dash at the end? And why my init file fails?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Why oh why has Emacs stopped using my preferred face (Iosevka) after updating from 27.2 to 28.1 (both self-built)? Is it something to do with xft and/or Cairo? If so, how do I fix it?
 I found that I could get to something that was at least readable with:
 (set-face-attribute 'default nil :family "Hack" :height 160 :weight 'normal :width 'normal) 
 and customizing typeface default to use Hack, but even this seems to come and go, apparently each time I focus a different frame (WTF?!), leaving an unreadable mess of widely spaced characters. 
 Hack is a face I used to use, still installed. Kinda sorta good enough to be getting on with, so long as Emacs doesn't keep forgetting, but not what I want and specified.
 Daemon mode, running on up-to-date Manjaro under StumpWM.

From there I'll work on a file, close it, and work on the next one. Is there a way to tell Emacs to send all of the special buffers such as scratch, Messages, lsp buffers (for clangd), etc to the end of the buffer list? Right now, as I'm working on files, those are interspersed through out the list of buffers, so I have to skip over them as I encounter them. It's not a big deal, but it's rather annoying.
 Along the same lines, is it possible to keep lsp-mode from opening buffers for clangd unless an error or something occurs that I actually need to know about?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, I am using treemacs to display my directories in a big project. I have treemacs spawned on the left window, then everything else belong to that directory can be launched on the right window, i.e. you press Enter on treemacs and it opens on the right. 
 This works but whenever I need to open up another file in a different directory, treemacs automatically change its path. 
 Eg. say I have treemacs open ~/myproject folder: I achieve this by open a file in ~/myproject and then launch treemacs. Now, if I open a different file in a different directory like ~/Desktop and my cursor is on that file, treemacs will then show whatever I have in ~/Desktop. Of course, if I focus my cursor on the file in ~/myproject, treemacs will show my project stuff again. 
 This flickering is quite distracting with big project, and sometimes you just want to open a random unrelated file. 
 Is there a different tree app or a settings in treemacs that does this?
 Please let me know.

 I'm having a problem with M-x diff-buffers, in that I have two buffers which are definitely different, and calling diff-buffers on the two of them returns that they are identical. 
 How should I go about troubleshooting this issue? It seems like it's writing the contents to two temp files and then diffing these two files, and I'm not familiar with debugging elisp at all [tracing functions? inspecting stuff that's running?]. Is there a way to get to the bottom of this which doesn't involve learning how to debug elisp and debugging diff?
 Thanks in advance, sorry if the problem is badly posed.

 I wonder if someone here knows of a strategy for keeping window splits sane, perhaps by designating a window for visiting these sorts of things, or by limiting the number/width of windows in a frame. 
 Emacs being what it is, I'm *sure* a solution has been invented, but I haven't been able to find it in my searching so far.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's great that C-n/C-p (n/p) are "standard" bindings for moving up and down lines/lists/etc. across many modes. But there are many situations where you aren't navigating a flat list, but rather a "tree" of information, with more than one depth level. E.g. code (lispy and friends, many programming modes, tree-sitter structural editing), collapsable sections (e.g. magit), nested outlines (org), heading outlines (outshine), etc. Here, the different modes all seem to define different navigation commands and bindings.
 It would be wonderful if there were a set of "standard" bindings for tree-movement: 
  
among siblings at the same level (j,k in lispy; b, f with org-speed commands)
 up a level forward/backward (h,l in lispy; u with org-speed)
 to the next/previous thing in the tree regardless of level (f from either "side" of an sexp in lispy, p, n with org speed commands).
 
 Probably too late to find any common set of keys that would work across existing modes, but it would still be nice to have a consistent set going forward. Opinions? Anyone find the same mismatch and come up with a workable solution?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm new to FRP and am trying to learn rhine so I apologize if I'm missing something obvious. I'm trying to figure out control flow. I get stdin, and throw an exception if the input is "q". Otherwise I just print it back. ``` checkInput :: Monad m => ClSF (ExceptT String m) cl String String checkInput = proc str -> do throwOn' -< (str == "q" || str == "Hello", str) returnA -< str
 checkPrint :: ClSF (ExceptT String IO) StdinClock () () checkPrint = tagS >>> checkInput >>> runClSFExcept (safe (arrMCl putStrLn))
 checkUseInput :: ClSFExcept IO StdinClock () () Empty checkUseInput = do str <- try checkPrint case str of "q" -> once_ exitSuccess "Hello" -> do once_ $ putStrLn "Hi!" checkUseInput _ -> once_ exitFailure
 main = flow $ (safely checkUseInput) @@ StdinClock ``` This code successfully prints back user input, and quits when I input "q". But when I input "Hello", "Hi!" is printed repeatedly and I cannot input anything. I would expect "Hi!" to be printed once and then for it to wait for user input again.
 I thought the printing of "Hi!" might be getting picked up by "tagS", so I tried flushing, but that didn't work. I also tried changing the printed string to "q", thinking that if "tagS" was picking up the printed line, it would go through the loop and throw the exception with "q", then quiting the program. This was not the case either. Thanks for any help!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi guys, a while ago I wrote a simple space battle game that features 2 ships and 2 big asteroids. The game is fully written in Haskell, using the CodeWorld modules. Here's the Github repo, and the suggested way to play the game is using the featured link in the README: https://github.com/Pedro-V/naves-codeworld
 Since I wrote the game mainly wth my brazilian peers, the documentation is in portuguese. But the game's source code is comprehensible to anyone familiar with Haskell's registers and function compositions.
  
U can use WASD for the first ship
 And Up/Left/Right/Down keys for the second one.
 A ship will be destroyed if it hits an asteroid or if it gets hit by more than 10 shots

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, recently I started using org-mode a lot - even running orgzly on my phone and syncing with syncthing. 
 This however, created a problem - If I modify the org buffer in emacs, don't write it into a file and then also modify the file externally (through syncthing), revert-buffer just asks if I want to throw away changes and reload or not. Few times I also got an option C-r (I believe it was called rebase buffer) that reverted the buffer AND reapplied my changes. 
 My question is: Do you know how is this C-r option triggered or how I could recreate it? I am looking for a way to do something similar to git rebase: take changes made to a file, update the file to new version and reapply those changes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've got two questions rolling around today and I can't seem to sort either of them. First, I'm trying to setup my home emacs configuration based (loosely) on my work configuration, but doing it entirely through use-package instead of the Emacs package management. As a result, I'm not entirely sure dependencies are being installed though I understand they ought to be. In any event I've got a behavior on my work machine that I have not yet been able to get on my home machine, namely when I start typing a path in a string, I get completion on it based on the filesystem. Here's a picture, hopefully. 
 In any event, I have company and company-statistics installed in both locations but I don't think that's what's doing the file completion suggestions. Any ideas what is causing that? 
 Second question, there is a package that has a built-in version installed, however the gnu repository has a more recent version. If I use use-package to install, it says the package is already installed. Is there a way to force it to update if there's a newer version, or something along those lines? I am new to use-package and really haven't gotten the full swing of it yet. I also have a newer version that I just had to download from a site and in the past have just used adding a directory onto load-path and then (require '<package name>) which works, but would be interesting to sort out whether that behavior can be done with use-package as well as a shortcut.
 Anyhow, any help greatly appreciated!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 New to Emacs and not a programmer. I can't invest in learning emacs in entirety at this time but I've begun using org-mode and really liking it. I will invest more as I find time. Currently, only one thing bugs me: Emacs looks terrible. 
 All the customization posts and resources are in-depth. I only want a better look. I don't want anything else, no keybindings nothing. Just regular emacs/org-mode that looks nicer (e.g., a dark theme, some prettier font maybe, etc.). 
 So, I want to borrow someone else's minimal (just better looks) customization. I don't know how to implement it but I hope it's just a matter of replacing a vanilla file with the borrowed one or pasting some code in one of the vanilla files. 
 Believe me I'm trying to learn it all but in my current workload there's like several years before I can get to the point of customizing it myself. Thanks!

        <updated>2022-06-28T08:50:24.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've recently upgraded my org-mode from 9.1.5 to 9.5.3 - somewhere along the way the LaTeX exporter seems to have changed to always create a table environment around org-mode tables (I think the old behaviour was to only create that when captions were specified. This:
 #+NAME: total-bill #+ATTR_LATEX: :center nil | Hours at EUR 71.40 | 65 | 4641.00 | | VAT 24%: | | 1113.84 | |--------------------+----+---------| | Total: | | 5754.84 | #+TBLFM: @1$3=@1$2*71.40;%.2f::@2$3=@1$3*24%;%.2f::@3$3=@1$3*(1+24%);%.2f #+LATEX: \hfill 
 now creates this:
 \begin{table}[htbp] \label{tab:org24fa42b} \begin{tabular}{lrr} Hours at EUR 71.40 & 65 & 4641.00\\ VAT 24\%: & & 1113.84\\ \hline Total: & & 5754.84\\ \end{tabular} \end{table} \hfill 
 The problem is that only some document classes define a table environment - and I can't find any way to disable generating it.
 The org-manual section about exporting tables has two options which initially look helpful, but are not useful in the end. :mode does change the table container, but doesn't have an option to switch it off, and all the other options make things worse. :environment is for the table contents, i.e., doesn't touch the table environment (as you might think from the description), but replaces the tabular environment with something else.
 I also didn't find obvious hints in the export backend code - any ideas how I can get rid of the tables?

Just wondering if anyone else has had any luck with centering or justifying latex previews in org mode? 
 Scimax users - is this working out of the box for you? I'm using doom and wondering if there is some conflict going on that I haven't found. 
 u/tecosaur have you had any luck with this?

 This post follows this comment, but to make It easier to search later on, if anyone encounter this issue in the future, I've creating a new thread.
 I've recently switched to Vertico as it became the default completion system on Doom Emacs (Which I'm using). So far, I'm really happy with it, however, I couldn't find any information of filtering/ignoring some directories/files in search results.
 I have some projects containing folders (e.g. "vendor") with so many files that search results become unusable but I might not want to ignore those folder at the VCS level, so I would like to ignore those folders/files in Vertico via Emacs config (And not using .projectile or .gitignore files.
 Looking at the source of Doom Emacs, vertico-file-search, I don't see any option to do so. I couldn't find anything in Vertico documentation either.
 /u/sarit-hadad-enjoyer mentioned adding it to projectile-globally-ignored-directories seems to also apply in Vertico for him but unfortunately that doesn't seems to be working in my case.
 I would appreciate any information or help to help me solve this issue,

 I currently work in a tier 2 company based in the Bay Area but its a spark shop which is not that exciting. I have been yearning to switch to a fully Scala FP based role while also improving my overall compensation. I have explored a few job postings for Scala FP in this sub, Linkedin and other sources and it seems to me that pay scale is considerably lower than my current role(based on levels.fyi and glassdoor).
 Are there any FAANG type companies that use Scala FP? Referrals are appreciated.
 Few considerations are:
  
300k+ compensation
 Open to remote
 Is flexible with timezones
 Should be an US company

I'm quite unsure what the use case of the Lib file and by extension the src folder is and would like that cleared up before continuing

 My Debug.trace.trace instance in normalizeMap shows the recursion working correctly and the Debug.trace.traceShow instance in function err shows a steadily increasing error value, evidence of the "maps" variable being correctly modified within the loop.
 The program's output, however, shows the "maps" variable being unmodified. The result of the recursive loop, the final "maps" object, should be returned on line 148, but the original "maps" object with the hard-coded values is returned.
 Any help would be appreciated. Thanks!

 This JSON dump is a representation of all the notes taken with Roam Research. As you might know, Roam Research is an outliner mainly, and each line of text is an outline element, which is represented as a nested (json) structure in the dump file.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone,
 I'm using Doom Emacs with Projectile and I'm struggling to understand how to correctly ignore directories globally.
 I have projectile-indexing-method set to hybrid, and wanna ignore the directory ./vendor in every project I have, regardless of the .gitignore file (Or any SVN file).
 I've added the following configuration: ``` (after! projectile (add-to-list 'projectile-globally-ignored-directories "vendor"))
 ```
 But this does not seems to work. Here is a quick test: ``` mkdir -p /tmp/test-project/vendor echo "Hello" > /tmp/test-project/file echo "Hello" > /tmp/test-project/vendor/file
 Create .projectile so Emacs recognize folder as project
 touch /tmp/test-project/.projectile ```
 Now, in Emacs, after going inside the project, projectile-find-file shows the vendor directory.
 describe-variable does show "vendor" in the projectile-globally-ignored-directories list.
 I've found some contradictory information whether this should work or not with the hybrid indexation: - From this comment (https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs/issues/976#issuecomment-431711176), I understand I have to use .gitignore? - But from an issue I opened https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs/issues/6504, I understand it should?
 I've tried as much debugging as my Lisp skills allows so any help you be appreciated!
 Thank you

 However if there is no such scratch.txt buffer, typing scratch will match *scratch*. 
 why is it like this? How can I configure it/them so that typing scratch will always match both buffers? 
 I'm doing this on an empty config with pretty much only vertico and orderless installed, and I'm using sample configuration from their Readme.

 I don't know if this is the best way to do it but I call `cabal repl` at a terminal tab in vscode, inside my project folder.
 However, it requires me to save the file and to type :r at every change to have it updated.

 I know that I can delete the "default directory" part of the path by hand, but that's cumbersome. I've looked in the Emacs manual, and I don't see an option that produces this behavior. Am I missing something?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Learning emacs is a bit overwhelming. I've gone through the tutorial and I've read a bit of the info pages as well. I understand the things covered in there, but how do I get to the point where I can be productive in emacs as a developer? I'm mostly a javascript developer, but currently learning C as well.
 I'd really like to have things like go-to-definition/go-to-references (probably using an LSP), searching project for regexes or just words, git management, syntax highlighting, debugging, etc.
 Are there good guides for getting there that actually explain what's going on each step of the way? I hate when it's a bunch of copy pasting. I want to understand what they are doing so I can change the parts I don't like.
 I'm also curious about using things like use-package or just using the default stuff of emacs. I see a lot of stuff about melpa vs elpa, and then I see use-package docs saying it's not a package manager. What are they talking about? What is the package manager then? Is there a straight forward way for a noobie to install some basic packages like magit and some JS modes that get me up and running?

We had visitors all last week. I took refuge in reading, and now that the visitors have left, I am left with 'tons' of notes to process from_ The Solace of Open Spaces_ by Gretel Ehrlich and James Webb Young's classic 1939 — A Technique for Producing Ideas. Such joy and riches to be loaded with gobs of ideas to process into my ZK.
I'll continue procrastinating, working up the nerve to make a planned Poetry of Zettelkasting presentation on advanced search techniques for quickly finding high-quality links in a large ZK.
I'm thinking about software lock-in, obsolescence, feature creep, development cycles, owning vs. subscription. The subscription model strikes me as a trap. If the developers vanish, so does the app.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone!
 I wrote an sbt plugin for enforcing the conventional commits standard.
 If you use semantic-release or something similar it would be great to have an automatic commit checker that checks if the commit message is compliant to the standard.
 The plugin works out of the box with (almost) zero setup. Of course, some customizations are available but the main objective of the plugin is to apply conventional commits with as little effort as possible.
 Suggestions and PR are welcome :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I am trying to make AuCTeX to run latexmk as a default engine. I configured .latexmkrc in a home folder, so lamtexmk <file> in command line compiles everything as expected.
 After short consulting with AuCTeX website, I added the following lines in to ~/.emacs
 ;; AUCTEX (eval-after-load "tex" '(add-to-list 'TeX-command-list '("LaTeXmk" "latexmk %s" TeX-run-command t t :help "Run LaTeXmk") t)) 
 which let me choose LaTeXmk from other alternative rules. Everything would work but I want latexmk to be the default program. Not sure about it but it seems TeX-command-default should be set to one of the entries from TeX-command-list which I did in the following line
 (setq TeX-command-default "LaTeXmk") 
 It doesn't seem to work. Now, the default rule is not even LaTeX when I press C-c C-c but View.
 What am I doing wrong? Thanks for any help.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been experimenting with the GADTs extension in Haskell and I'm wondering is there a significant difference between existential types obtained with GADTs and type classes? For example:
 -- toStr with GADTs and existential types data Stringable where Stringable :: a -> (a -> String) -> String toStr :: Stringable -> String toStr (Stringable x s) = s x -- same result but with a type class class Stringable a where show :: a -> String toStr :: Stringable a => a -> String toStr s = show s 
 This code made me wonder --ignoring the difference in ease of use of each solution-- is there something I can do with type classes that is impossible to achieve with existential types in GADTs or vice-versa?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Encouraged by comments in https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/vjo43z/improving_emacs_performance/ * I thought I'd have another look at my 'linting on save' snippet and ask the deep-thinkers here how I might improve it. It's almost perfect for me with bash(1) scripts - the only sand in the vaseline is that next-error skips over shellcheck(1) 'notes' and only points me at 'warnings' and worse. For example, in this output from shellcheck(1):
 foobar:5:18: note: Double quote to prevent globbing and word splitting. [SC2086] foobar:20:28: warning: ShellCheck can't follow non-constant source. Use a directive to specify location. [SC1090] 
 I would like next-error to visit occurrences of 'note's as well as more serious blues. Do I need to futz with next-error-function? If so, does anyone have the code for that? 
 Or perhaps there's some way to have shellcheck(1) promote 'notes' to 'warnings'?
 Here's my miserable code:
 (defun bh:check-syntax () "Check syntax for various languages." (interactive) (when (eq major-mode 'lisp-mode) (progn (emacs-lisp-byte-compile))) (when (eq major-mode 'sh-mode) (compile (format "bash -n %s && shellcheck -f gcc %s" buffer-file-name buffer-file-name) t)) (when (eq major-mode 'ruby-mode) (shell-command (format "ruby -c %s" buffer-file-name))) (when (eq major-mode 'python-mode) (shell-command (format "python -B -m py_compile %s" buffer-file-name))) (when (eq major-mode 'awk-mode) (shell-command (format "gawk --source 'BEGIN { exit(0) } END { exit(0) }' --file %s" buffer-file-name)))) (add-hook 'after-save-hook #'bh:check-syntax) 
 * the sub-discussion was about disabling flycheck as it's just too distracting - I prefer to do linting on save, and so do others, apparently.

I copied it and ran but I remembered I use code runner, so I move to terminal to provide arguments. Now, I am in terminal, inside the correct dir, I do scalac main.scala and it generates 2 files we all know. Now, I do scala Hello 12 and it works just fine. Now, let's make a simplest scala hello world program and do scala main.scala; I usually name my object as Hello and file as main.scala; without doing scalac and it runs fine. What the heck? I know my knowledge is lacking somewhere. Please pardon me for my english or difficulty to explain my question and help me with this doubt in simple but complete sentences (no layers of abstraction LoL). Thank you so much. If you wanna ask something, feel free to do so.

run M-x recompile (so it doesn't promt for compile command, like M-x compile)
 when *compilation* window pops up and focuses, lets you standard input what needs to be inputed
 when there is no longer things to input (program exits), *compilation* buffer is back to its normal read-only state and i can q to exit the completion window.

I was watching the source code for ghc how other Word types are implemented from C to Haskell, and I am sort of lost. (Guess the better question could be How to write C code that alters GHC to create new types?).

 I have a command I want to bind to a key, let us call it do-something
 do-something can be called with a prefix: one ctrl-u and two ctrl-u, it then changes its behaviour
 I want to avoid having to type the ctrl-u(s). How do I do it? 
 I guess I can a lambda that calls do-something with the prefix. But I do not know how to programmatically call do-something as if it was called with a prefix.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While writing yet another python program to convert structure text files to equivalent json text files with same information it occurred to me that elisp should be able to do the same task without much sweat. After all to get this done I ended up with a "LineWalker" class wrapping the full text to convert that had of necessity a small subset of what is in elisp for text buffer manipulation, walking and transformation.
 So I am curious the community here has at hand some pointers to text information transformers wholly in elisp. And I am curious whether transformation in place in text buffer is often done or usually transformation into another buffer. 
 So many bread and butter programming tasks involve transformation of text to some other text. Heck, compiling a program in transformation of text to different text or binary. So the breadth of such tasks is larger than it first seems.

 As the title says, the project would be a tasks provider for Android. It would read all the ToDos and scheduled items from Org files in the selected directory. It could be read-only or could create the new tasks in a selected inbox file.
 Would you find this useful and worth investing some time into? Do you have any ideas in this direction?
 My main goal would be to display the scheduled items and ToDos in a calendar view. Since there is an existing infrastructure available, the only missing link would be the provider that links the Org files and a calendar. I'm a visual type and can't get used to the linear agenda view. I'd like to look at the monthly calendar and see all my tasks. I know that this is possible with the normal calendar and tasks providers but I'd also like to keep these in my Org files, following GTD.

Is it still true that it's hard to find a Haskell job, but easy for companies to find Haskell developers?
 
What salaries are we roughly talking about?
 
How do companies know their remote employees are really working? Is installing spyware on the employee computers common / considered acceptable?
 
What collaboration software is being used? Zoom, Teams, or some end-to-end encrypted stuff? If I don't want to use a camera (audio only), at least not regularly, will this reduce my chances?
 
Do companies pay a guy in Bangalore less than a guy in San Francisco? In this case, would a person in San Francisco have to make it clear they don't expect San Francisco salaries to increase their chances of getting the job?
 
Do companies prefer to get billed by the person as an outside consultant rather than going through the hassle of hiring an employee?
 
Do companies prefer part-time workers, or ad-hoc workers who show up whenever they need my services, to full-time employees?

 This mode gives the ability to execute the just recipies from within the editor itself.
 The new release with the changelog details here: https://github.com/psibi/justl.el/blob/master/Changelog.org#08
 The major highlight in this release is integrating compilation mode with justl for recipe execution.

Over the years I had a bad habit of bookmarking things to read later and usually just never getting to them. I also have been using this anki plugin called Searching, PDF Reading & Note-Taking in Add Dialog and I really like the queue system it has, but I really hate taken notes in it or reading webpages or pdfs in it and want to try and find a way to do it in emacs. The addon is based on incremental reading (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incremental_reading) so you can add different articles to a priority queue that you can pull up to decide what to read next. I attached two screenshots below to help understand what I am talking about.
 ​
 Anyways, I'm super new to emacs and don't really know how I would go about doing this in emacs. Any tips? 
 ​
 I'd like to be able to have the priority features in the addon, i.e. 1-100 priority scheduling, show in [n] days, show on weekdays, set a directory for files and see all files that aren't currently in the queue, but I realize this may be pretty hard so I'd settle for just being able to add and remove links to a queue with some basic priority.

 I'm a med student, and I usually share my notes with many of my colleagues. I'm planning to make a github repo where they can contribute and access them for free. I'm going to make a tutorial for them on how to contribute and work with org-mode. 
 What editor is best for a beginner? Should I recommend them to use vscode/vscodium? Do you have any advise on how to help someone that was using microsoft office/google docs switch to org without scaring them away?

 Did anyone here use scala with Quarkus? If yes, what was the experience? 
 I am very curious about two things: 1. combining scala with smallrye mutiny, and 2 using scala with reactive database clients.
 I started to read the mutiny docs, and I must say, coming from scala, I don't find it appealing especially the onItem() chains.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I frequently work with JSON files that are made up of two kinds of data:
  
mostly irrelevant data I never want to see or change
 some important properties, some of which are, written in a programming language.
  
I would like to be able to edit these files in such a way that:
  
the irrelevant data is hidden
 the code is presented in a nicely formatted way with syntax highlighting
  
What is the best approach for this? For example:
  
Is there an existing library or mode that does something like this?
 Should this feature be implemented as a minor mode? If so, which mode should it extend?
 Should this feature be implemented as a major mode?
  
For example, the JSON file:
 [ { ... hundreds of lines of mostly irrelevant properties ... "name": "foo", "code": "def function():\n. print(\"hello, world from foo!\") ... many more lines...", ... hundreds of lines of mostly irrelevant properties ... }, { ... hundreds of lines of mostly irrelevant properties ... "name": "bar", "code": "def function():\n. print(\"hello, world from bar!\") ... many more lines...", ... hundreds of lines of mostly irrelevant properties ... } ] 
 What I'd like to see in my buffer:
 // foo def function(): print("hello, world from foo!") ... many more lines ... // bar def function(): print("hello, world from bar!") ... many more lines ... 
 Saving the buffer would update the underlying JSON file.
 Thanks!

 ;; 1 (setq org-todo-keywords '((sequence "TODO(t)" "NEXT(n)" "|" "DONE(d)") (sequence "PROJECT(p)" "|" "COMPLETED(c)"))) ;; 2 (setq org-todo-keywords '((sequence "TODO(t)" "NEXT(n)" "PROJECT(p)" "|" "DONE(d)" "COMPLETED(c)"))) 
 As I see it, the only difference is when using S-<left> / S-<right> (org-mode ensures the order), but if use C-c C-t the org-mode does not enforce any rules and it's possible to go from PROJECT to NEXT, for example.
 Am I missing something, or can I somehow enforce the org-mode to validate that the state transition only happens within a single sequence?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So let’s say I’m working on directory A and then I want to switch to working in directory B. When I’m in directory B and I open treemacs, it will still show the file tree from directory A? I’ve tried a couple different things like killing buffers but nothing has worked. 
 How can I make it so that when I open treemacs it will always open the directory tree that I’m currently in??

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am struggling to set up lsp-mode with Emacs for R. I have installed languageserver in R and have ESS installed.
 When I launch an R script, I get the following message:
 File mode specification error: (void-function -compose)
 In my init.el I have the following:
 (use-package lsp-mode :init (setq lsp-keymap-prefix "C-c l") :hook ((ess-r-mode . lsp) (lsp-mode . lsp-enable-which-key-integration)) :commands lsp)
 I am stumped as to what I'm doing wrong. Googling this problem brought me to a Reddit thread but the solution at the end doesn't help me.
 I have been following along System Crafters' video to try and set up the LSP, but alas to no avail.
 I am hoping to set this up with which-key, lsp-ui, and company-mode. So, any help is welcomed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We're excited to announce our Elm/Haskell app is in production! https://insurance.caribou.com. The frontend is entirely Elm, the backend is entirely Haskell. For most of the time we've been building it we've had a team of 4 engineers (the team size has fluctuated because of hiring new people, and some members starting a new Haskell team in the org).
 In case anyone cares, we were able to get the event sourcing services setup relatively quickly, most of it was finished in about 2 months with a long tail of tweaks and feature adds. The frontend work (which included some REST API work to add or update routes, etc) took closer to 3 months.
 Interesting choices ("interesting" as in "possibly unique, or better than the normal choices in our opinion"):
  
Event sourcing for our Haskell services
 elm-program-test feels like testing super powers
 servant-elm to generate Elm code from Haskell, but we eventually abandoned it because we didn't feel like it provided enough value :(
  
I wish I could say we're hiring, but we aren't right now. However we are likely to be hiring in a few months, but I'm just a tech lead so I don't actually make those decisions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm gonna start by saying that i respect emacs contributors/developers choice to keep emacs minimal, they maintain it, while not bloating it by just copy and pasting elisp code from plethora other external packages, leaving end users free to choose if they want any packages to add. Emacs already offers a lot of development tools, that i think work really well together, like (warning, long list ahead):
 version control (magit), web browser (eww), email client, text editing, terminal, plugin (package) manager, documentation, calculator, remote file system access (tramp), org more, and most importantly, powerful configuration system (elisp), and definitely more.
 Compared to emacs, vscode (yes im comparing emacs to vscode, bite me) only has 40% percent of these features. But there is one thing that vscode does better than emacs, and that is code editing. Vscode, has built in lsp, with fast, consistent auto code completion with good completion results, fast documentation, with easy to install plugins here and there. Emacs auto code completion makes typing typing feel laggy, the completions results are a bit worse, programing in different languages feels not as consistent, and setting up all the stuff is more tedious.
 All i'm saying is that i think emacs users would benefit a lot, if we had these features built in into emacs, with good, out of a box, experience, as most of us are programmers. And it would probably take a lot of effort for emacs devs to implement something like this, but why not.
 Thanks for reading my [almost] rant, have a nice day :D

 I know people here hates mouse, touchpad and the pointer cursor, i understand your point, but it is not as i have lerned to interact with my editor. So i would need something that it's easy to get in and has mouse support to navigate code, tabs and maybe menus.
 Thank you for your help.
