        <updated>2021-06-02T18:41:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[First some context:
As I understand Luhmann workflow...
He put every interesting thoughts he have as a permanent note without worrying too much. (Like a skeptic tank)
His notes are really short (generally 1 to 3 sentences).
I see nobody else using the Zettelkasten in this way. Lot of people create longer notes and try to synthesize before putting the ideas into the system.
Last but not least: the system is created for academic research in mind.
My frictions:
1) When I think and want to create new notes... having to search existing notes in the Zettelkasten stops my thinking flow.
I am wondering if it’s not better to just create note without connection when I think... and only then look at the possible connections. But that will create a lot of duplicates.
Or thinking more deeply before putting the note and find the connections. (But I feel I don’t leverage the Zettelkasten fully by this way)
2) When I want to create a new content... going to the Zettelkasten kills my creative flow. As I am not creating academic content (but marketing content)... The most important in the content isn’t the information, but the emotion (you can only put emotion in a content with your first brain in a specific mood)
Because of this 2 things... I am wondering if a Zettelkasten is the best tool for me.
And if it is... I am wondering why only luhmann work in a very atomic way without bothering of the quality of the note. And why mainy people create longer note with digital zettelkasten.
My question:
I deliberately don’t ask a specific question because at this point, I don’t really know what is the good question to ask myself.
Maybe: How to determine the best way of organizing the process and scope of permanent notes ?
Thanks for reading.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to create a Mac installer for a project that uses the SDL2 library and a couple of extension libs.
 Currently when I build, things are linking against the libraries installed on my system via homebrew in /usr/local/opt/. However, when I package these libraries with my program they are not recognized as safe to run on others' systems, so in order to run my program a user has to go through a launch, crash, allow library to be run cycle for each of the libs I link against until everything is allowed. This is obviously a no-go from a user friendliness perspective.
 I figured if I could link against the Mac frameworks for the libs that they should be signed (as they've been released as frameworks) and the user would only have to go through this allow process for just my app executable (until I get it signed). However, I'm not sure how to link against the frameworks.
 I tried repointing the executable to the framework dylibs using the install_name_tool, but the versions differ between the homebrew and framework versions of the libs, which made my app not run -- I've since thought better of trying to use this method in case there were incompatibilities between the entry points of the lib versions.
 My next thought was that I would have to link to the frameworks at build-time, but adding the -framework ghc option when I run stack build doesn't seem to have any effect -- it still points to the homebrew versions. Maybe the Haskell bindings are set to point at the homebrew versions only?
 This is the first user-facing application I've developed on Mac, so I'm in a bit over my head. I'd like to have the standard DMG/drag-the-app-into-Applications installer for the app, as I don't know that homebrew would be the friendliest install method for my target audience.
 Any help or suggestions are appreciated!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 I just released a new chapter focusing on IO in my online course Foundations of FP in Scala https://www.fp-tower.com/courses/foundations
  
Includes 16 videos, around 4.5 hours in total.
 Lots of exercises, including a very realistic one where we implement a search flight aggregator similar to skyscanner
 We’ll cover features such as by-name parameters, lazy evaluation, dependency injection, and concurrency.
 We’ll study the differences between IO and Future extensively. 
 This chapter is a perfect introduction to cats-effect, Monix and ZIO.
  
Let me know if you have any questions!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am an emacs beginner, and trying to do some C++ programming in emacs. I am having a lot of trouble to get tabs to work in emacs like I would expect them to work like in Sublime Text.
 This is how my code looks in emacs:
 std::cout<<"============cheem-scheme v.1============\n"; std::string source; while(true) { std::cout << ++line_number << "] cheem> "; std::getline(std::cin, source); Object* expr = read(source); Object* evaluated_expr = eval(expr, global_environment); std::cout << print(evaluated_expr) << std::endl; } return 0; 
 And this is how it looks like when I open it in another text editor:
 std::cout<<"============cheem-scheme v.1============\n"; std::string source; while(true){ std::cout << ++line_number << "] cheem> "; std::getline(std::cin, source); Object* expr = read(source); Object* evaluated_expr = eval(expr, global_environment); std::cout << print(evaluated_expr) << std::endl; } return 0; 
 emacs seems to be inserting only one tab for even indentation that goes more than a level deep, and that is pretty frustrating to work with. I would rather emacs insert n tabs for n levels of indentation. How am I supposed to change this behavior?

This works fine. [[file:.images/morepathstuff:/2021-04-12_04-44-34_screenshot.png]]
 But I can't copy the image out, without drawing a rectangle around the image with a screen capture tool like flameshot. I can only copy the emacs image file path as shown above.
 How can I copy the image itself into the clipboard, and not just the emacs image file path? 
  
I'm do not want to use a file manager, find the image, and copy it, as file names are often long and un-intelligble, and I can have many images in one directory.
 I guess the preferred method would be some elisp function where I highlight an inline image (to select/highlight the path), and then it copies that path, interprets that path, finds the image, and copies the image itself into my clipboard. But I don't think that exists yet.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm a very keyboard-centric person, however sometimes I still like to use the mouse to scroll down certain files in emacs (usually docs and the like). Plus, I don't really like scrolling line by line, so I've been trying to have emacs scroll smoothly.
 Sadly, I've found the emacs smooth scrolling experience to be janky at best: no matter what workarounds I use (I've tried several, including all of those listed on the emacswiki page as well as good-scroll.el), smooth scrolling feels sluggish, not fluid, and often unresponsive.
 I wonder what the root cause for this is. Most of the explanations I've read revolve around emacs' lack of animation support. For example, the github page of smooth-scroll.el states the following:
  
Scrolling sometimes pauses or stutters. It's unclear exactly why, but one factor is that Emacs lacks animation support. Emacs has timers for updating the screen contents, which is enough for playing simple animated GIF files, but not enough for video playback or frame-perfect smooth scrolling.
  
My question is the following: what would it take to fix it? I know that emacs is very old, and some features might just be outside of its capabilities (at least for now). Is smooth scrolling support one such feature?
 I understand that emacs wasn't made with smooth scrolling in mind, and I don't mean to criticize and/or diminish the amazing work that went into it. I'm extremely happy with my emacs experience--smooth scrolling would just be the icing on the cake.
 Thank you in advance!

 I've used helm for a long time, and it's honestly very good, but I'm mostly only using it for its locate functionality now. I use everything search on windows, which in combination with the .dir-locals.el lets me set a search instance depending on the directory I start the search from. I know about projectile, of course, but it's slower and more finicky than everything. (With everything, I can set up a search that spans many directories on many drives and make it a named instance, and then just query the named instance in the arguments.)
 Helm's locate is the only decent and maintained way to do this that I've found. Scrounging up random .el files from EmacsWiki doesn't really work for me.
 If there isn't, no big deal. I'll keep helm updated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Haskell beginner here: Is it good practice to mix both let and where bindings in a function definition?
 For example (with short being a short function and reallyLongFunc being a really long function):
 foo x = let short y = y * 2 in if odd x then short x else reallyLongFunc x where reallyLongFunc z = z + 2 
 Using let at the top and where at the bottom allows me to arrange the function definitions next to where they are used, and allows large function definitions to not interrupt the logical flow of the program. However, I could also understand that it might be bad practice to use both let and where, because I have not seen this done anywhere, and it might be mixing expression and declaration styles.
 What do you think?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello. I’m a professional Golang developer. I previous worked with Java for 10 years and Python for a few years as well.
 I tried to learn Haskell back in 2016 with the book “Real World Haskell. But I found the book to be really dry and frankly boring. It was a struggle to get through. And after about 8 chapters I saw very little “real world”.
 I find that most education material seems to run all examples in the repl. And that is just off putting to me. Especially when I see “real world” apps and I can’t understand what’s going on.
 Also I find that too many tutorials focus way too much on math problems. And that’s cool. But how do I get from math problems to building entire apps. To me there doesn’t seem to be any real progression.
 I know plenty of languages and I found I learn better by trying to build real things. Yet I find most Haskell tutorials and education shy away from showing real world applications. And reading source code is confusing since it’s hard to distinguish between built in functions and user defined functions.
 Anyway is there a middle ground between these heavily mathematical examples. And actual real world application. There seems to be a lot of ceremony in real world Haskell apps.
 I do enjoy the Haskell type system. And I like it’s expressiveness. I wish I could enjoy it like others do. I just have never got that “aha” moment because it’s hard to just jump in and get dirty with the language.
 Any suggestions?

For example, my first level headers are set to a height of 1.25 but when I type 'TODO' in, it uses the standard size for that word. I'm not sure what I need to inherit.
 I'm using Doom Emacs and have only just switched from (neo)vim so don't really know what I'm doing yet
 Edit: I noticed that if I do not add any custom formatting to todo's with org-todo-keyword-faces this is default behaviour, but I can't get it to work for customized faces.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This may well be obvious to those of you conversant with lisp, but...
 How do I get ibuffer to show me both sets of groups (the "saved filter groups" and also those from projectile via ibuffer-projectile). Both ibuffer-projectile:
 (add-hook 'ibuffer-hook (lambda () (ibuffer-projectile-set-filter-groups))) 
 and what I previously had:
 (setq ibuffer-saved-filter-groups (quote (("default" ("org" (or (name . "^\\*Org Agenda\\*$") (mode . org-mode))) ("emacs" (or (name . "^\\*Compile-Log\\*$") (name . "^\\*scratch\\*$") (name . "^\\*Messages\\*$"))) )))) (add-hook 'ibuffer-mode-hook (lambda () (message ".emacs hook") (ibuffer-auto-mode 1) (ibuffer-switch-to-saved-filter-groups "default"))) 
 work fine, but I can't get the results to combine. It seems I can have one or the other. The ibuffer-projectile documentation suggests that using ibuffer-projectile-generate-filter-groups is key, but I don't get the projectile groups when I use that.

the package now filters remote content from html emails to address issues with tracking in emails. This is currently quite naive, but users can customize filters. Any feedback / help from somebody who understands email tracking better than I do is appreciated.
 the new dispatcher view method determines how to show emails based on a set of customizable rules (e.g., you could use this to show remote content for trusted email addresses)
 you can now temporarily redisplay the current email using a different viewing method. For instance, to switch from filtering remote content for an email to showing remote content.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, I've been working on bespoke-themes, which started out as a fork of Nicolas Rougier’s amazing work on elegant-emacs and nano-emacs. It sports a similar vibe, though some of the base colors are different and it is slightly less minimal and "opinionated" than nano-emacs. It also has the benefit of being (I hope) easily incorporated into one's existing emacs as a theme, rather than the more "distro" style of nano-emacs (which is a great project, but maybe not for everyone). I'm hoping to submit it to MELPA before too long. Long story short though, I'm looking for advice on the following:
  
Organization of the theme files
 Elisp (I'm not any sort of programmer) 
 Whether I should break the mode line out into its own repo
 Any useful tips on colors (that you hate/like it is one thing -- I'm more curious about tips concerning visibility or contrast, etc.)
 Stuff to do before I submit it to MELPA (especially anything not covered by the README)
  
Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've written a book using org-mode and I'm trying to export as an HTML/website, similar to this example. That was written using R and Bookdown, but since it all ends up as CSS/HTML, I don't see why the same thing can't be replicated with org-mode. 
 I've been trying to use org-publish to do this, but I'm running into a couple of issues. 
  
I can't seem to replicate the book structure of the above example -- it all comes out as one single long HTML file. I'm using separate files for each chapter, and then a main.org file where each chapter is included via #+INCLUDE statements. What is the best way to achieve this? In other words, I want a front page with a TOC, and then each chapter to be a separate page and to have previous and next links for navigation.
 
I've been using the org-ref package to cross-reference figures/tables/sections in the book, but it doesn't seem to work across multiple files. E.g. if I am in chapter 4 and I want to reference something in chapter 2 (using the label: and ref: keywords respectively), org-ref doesn't seem to recognize it. Any way around this?
 
Lastly, I'd very much appreciate any examples of books like this being made in org-mode and exported as HMTL/websites, for inspiration. Or "book-themed" CSS templates that can be implemented painlessly. The only one I'm aware of is the org-mode manual itself, but aesthetically it is very far from what I'm looking for.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So i have this assignment where i have to code a game called "Nim" where two players take turns removing objects from distinct heaps or piles, and the player that gets to remove the last object wins. I've already coded a function for doing a specific move, i.e : play [1,2,3,4] (3,2) = [1,2,1,4]. [1,2,3,4] would be the number of objects on each tile, and (3,2) would be removing 2 objects from the third tile. I also coded a function that gives a list of all the posible plays on a specific board position, i.e: possiblePlays [1,2,3] = [(1,1), (2,2),(2,1),(3,3), (3,2), (3,1)] The problem i'm having is that now i have to code a function that tells me if a board position (like [1,2,3,4]) is "winnable": a board position is winnable if a play exists that can lead to the other player getting a not winnable board position. i.e: isItWinnable [] = False (because you can't make another move, so you lose) isItWinnable [1] = True (because you get to remove the last object). I think these could be the base cases, but i'm having a lot of trouble thinking the recursion. I'm sorry for the long post and the messy english, it's not my native language and i had to translate everything from spanish. If anyone has any ideas or tips it would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance.

 What I am doing now is switching to emacs keybindings with C-z and then edit normally but when I am in an org file if I press TAB the headline gets moved to the right instead of folding or unfolding. 
 Anybody experiencing this?

I'm surprised that so few configs I see on GitHub take into account the subtleties of how package.el works, particularly in how it interacts with Use Package.
 I think all of the below is correct, but if I'm missing or am wrong about anything please tell me in the comments and I'll correct the text.
 Unsurprisingly, all of this is well documented in (info "(elisp) Startup Summary") and (info "(emacs) Packages") so I'm not writing anything groundbreaking here, just summarizing available information.

So if it were that the total length of all elements above the "Stein" is smaller or equal to the Length of that "Stein" the Structure is considered Correct and true is given out. But I have no clue how I should continue from this point onwards. I have no clue how to verify the Length of all the structures above a "Stein" in such a way that still only Boolean comes out in the end.
 Edit: I did manage to come up with somewhat of a hacky solution to it which I am not really a fan of.
 correct :: Legu -> Bool correct x = 0 <= foldLegu (\ le _ l -> if le >= sum l && sum l >= 0 then le else -le) const x 
 Is there a more elegant way with which to do this, I am particularly not a fan of the fact I am simply giving out a negative number if the structure is not correct.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been using straight.el for a while now and am very happy with it. However, emacs being emacs I thought I'd try an alternative in borg. 
 There are three installation routes documented :- 
 1) as a secondary package manager
 2) using a seeded bootstrap
 3) using your own "from scratch" bootstrap
 ​
 I followed 3) since 2) meant cloning into my .emacs.d which is already a git repo and I didn't want to potentially screw that over. Anyway, some trial and error I have emacs starting up with borg and I have 5 or 6 things assimiliated in to .emacs.d/lib.
 But is it correct that things not in there are loaded from ~/.emacs.d/elpa? I ask this because I'm not sure how this is then different from "using borg as a secondary package manager". package-install still works installing to the elpa directory. This seems to make sense as there doesn't seem to be a way to auto magically auto assimilate (but being very new to this, there might be one I overlooked).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I think it would be great if the Emacs documentation was more accessible on mobile devices, either for those long journeys when you need something interesting to read, or at night in bed when you want to do some light reading (heh).
 Idea 1: Treat each manual like an Ebook
 The easiest way to do this would be to convert the source Tex files used to generate the online documentation into an indexed EPUB format, using pandoc or other.
 We could then rely on existing Ebook readers to handle the formatting issues, bookmarking, and search queries.
 Edit -- /u/alraban points out that there exists already an epub resource:
 http://epub-manuals.ourproject.org/blog/gnu-emacs-lisp-reference-manual/
 Idea 2: Treat it like a Bible App
 Bible apps are awesome, they come with the all advantages of Ebook readers (formatting, bookmarking, annotation) with the added bonus that they bundle all related material under a single app.
 Given the diversity of Emacs-specific material in GNU this could be a great way to contain several different manuals, over several different versions of documentation (with optional 'diff' highlights), all in one place.
 There are a few FOSS bible app templates on github, but I'm not that versed in android development anymore so this is likely something I cannot do without a lot of effort. 
 Is there anyone in this sub who is versed in Android development and would be willing to evangelize the Emacs documentation on mobile? I'd be happy to chip in a few dozen coffee funds

one emacs instance for general notetaking and capturing, agenda and etc.
 one emacs instance for every project that I work (usually limited to 2, I am trying out projectile, but still prefer separate projects hacked away in separate emacs instances)
 one for org-noter for reading pdfs - one instance per pdf
  
I love the integrated computing environment idea, making everything seamlessly work together, I am still honing my config to achieve that, but for the moment separate instances workflow helps me get things done.
 I am thinking of exploiting chemacs in combination with .desktop files to launch emacs to specific tasks, but is there a better way to do this?
 EDIT:
 as u/sjchy pointed out,
 Visually differentiating workspace is vital for me. I didn't mention this in the OP. but I use leuven theme for general notetaking and solarized for projects and tango-dark for org-noter at the moment.

 :includes when I try to include a file it only recognizes if I provide the absolute path. Which is also annoying.

 Run evil-end-of-line ($):

 Run evil-previous-visual-line (gk):
 [] This is a long line, it wraps. 
 The problem here is that it didn't go to the previous visual line.
 However, evil-previous-visual-line (gk) does sometimes work. Consider:
 [T]his is a long line, it wraps. 
 Run evil-end-of-line ($):
 This is a long line, it wraps[.] 
 Run evil-backward-char (h), then run evil-forward-char (l):
 This is a long line, it wraps[.] 
 Now run evil-previous-visual-line (gk):
 This is[ ]a long line, it wraps. 
 Now evil-previous-line works as expected.
 This problem seems to come from mixing regular commands and visual line mode aware commands. Going directly from a non visual line aware command to a visual line aware command causes problems. But if I do evil-forward-char in between, everything works.
 Any suggestions on how I can fix this?

 Surprisingly, using the nix build instructions from this snippet:
 https://gist.github.com/mjlbach/179cf58e1b6f5afcb9a99d4aaf54f549#gistcomment-3664894
 , I'm finally able to get emacsGcc working in my nixos machine running on a raspberry pi 4,
 when I open emacs, everything seems to load up fine, and emacs feels much more snappier, but the issue that I'm having now is with modes, for example: when I open an html file setup with (direnv+nix-direnv+emacs-direnv), the isolated environment does not load, and whenever I manually execute: M-x html-mode, emacs throws these 2 errors in emacs's messages buffer?
 Note: I enabled debugger, and on emacsGcc startup initialization, the debugger is not triggered, which is good, but these 2 errors still show up at the beginning of the messages buffer:
 Eager macro-expansion failure: (wrong-number-of-arguments (3 . 4) 2) [2 times]
 Error loading autoloads: (wrong-number-of-arguments (3 . 4) 2)
 This 3rd error shows up whenever I try to manually activate a specific mode:
 Error running timer: (wrong-number-of-arguments (3 . 4) 2)
 Also, in the async-native-compile-log buffer, I can see the different modes for my project being compiled, but even after the compilation of one of the modes that I need is completed, whenever I try to activate that mode, the same 2 errors from above are thrown?
 Any tips on how to fix this?
 I'm pretty sure that there's an easy fix, but I'm new to emacsGcc, so there's probably some things that I'm missing to get emacsGcc up and running.
 Thanks in advance for the help!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Is it possible to satisfy a quantified constraint such as (forall a. c (t a)) if you happen to be able to satisfy c (t a) for any a (such as from a Dict)?
 Specifically, is it possible to write this function?
 forallConstraint :: forall kp kq (c :: kq -> Constraint) (t :: kp -> kq) r. (forall (a :: kp). Dict (c (t a))) -> ((forall (a :: kp). c (t a)) => r) -> r forallConstraint = ??? 
 I feel like this should be possible, but I can't figure out how.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone,
 I'm currently writing a parser using megaparsec which produces the following output:
 data FileElement = SyntaxStmt SyntaxStatement | PackageSpec PackageSpecification | ImportStmt ImportStatement | OptionDef OptionDefinition | MsgDef MessageDefinition | EnumDef EnumDefinition | ServiceDef ServiceDefinition deriving (Show, Eq) type File = [FileElement] 
 it goes on with more nested substructures.
 Now I realized that I need to record the location in the document for every entity.
 What would be the best way of integrating this into the AST? I would like to avoid changing the AST itself, but have the location information as some sort of "annotation" to the nodes, or just general ideas for that matter.
 I really appreciate your help and happy haskelling.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Consult is a collection of useful navigation and search commands based on completing-read, compatible with various completion UIs. Marginalia enhances completion commands with informative annotations in the minibuffer.
 Both packages have been submitted to GNU ELPA recently and became available there today. Hopefully some of the enhancements of these packages can be imported into Emacs proper, for example improved annotation functions, some of the completion commands or API improvements. 
 A while ago, the completing-read API has been enhanced with the group-function metadata, which allows completion UIs to group the set of candidates. This feature started as a Consult extension, which is used by the multi source consult-buffer command. Support for the group-function has been added to the default completion UI and merged into Emacs master.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 I'm an absolute noob when it comes to emacs and org-mode. I've been watching a tonne of videos and reading through the manual.
 One thing that I'm wondering about is whether to use tags or custom properties for adding people to a task? The idea would be that if a task has a status of WAITING that I'd want to add the associated person to that task. Then when having a meeting with that person I'd be able to pull up a list of all the tasks that are associated with that person.
 In my current system (in Notion) I actually have a page per person, so that I can write some notes about them, such as favorite food etc. In that setup the tagging of a person to a task and the person's info page is one in the same (2 tables that are linked). I'm wondering what the best way to setup this kind of functionality in org-mode would be?
 TL;DR: Tag or properties for adding people to tasks?
 Thanks in advance!

 Now, I have another TODO state called TODAY, and I change the state of this item to

 How can I do to schedule or reschedule (if there exists already a date) to today's date automatically after changing to the TODAY state?
 Is there a built-in function for that?
 Thanks for the help.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I use emacs to read a lot of PDFs, using the excellent pdf-tools package.
 But (like emacs users everywhere), I was not happy with a couple aspects of the default behavior.
 In particular, I use pdf-occur a lot, but the default behavior of display-buffer is to split my PDF frame vertically into two windows with the top window showing a too-small-to-read view of the PDF and the bottom window showing the list of occurrences.
 Maybe there is a better way, but this is what I did (which I share in case it helps someone else).
  (add-to-list display-buffer-alist '("^\\*PDF-Occur\\*$" (display-buffer-pop-up-frame) (pop-up-frame-parameters . (auto-hide-function . delete-frame)))) 
 This causes the *PDF-Occur* buffer to be displayed in a newly-created ("pop-up") frame instead of splitting the frame with the PDF document into two windows. (The auto-hide-function causes that frame to be deleted when one "quits" the window in that new frame. That is, when you press q in that buffer, the newly-created frame is deleted.)
 However, there is a secondary problem. When you select the occurence you care about in the *PDF-Occur* buffer and press RETURN, it splits that frame vertically and displays the PDF in the lower-half of that frame (again, in a too-small-to-read format).
 I fixed that by adding a function to the hook for the *PDF-Occur* buffer's mode like this:
 `` (defun my-pdf-occur-buffer-mode-hook () "CauseRETURN' in this buffer to use the window already displaying the PDF and return focus there." (make-local-variable 'display-buffer-alist) (setq display-buffer-alist (cons '(".*\.pdf$" (display-buffer-reuse-window) (reusable-frames . t)) (default-value 'display-buffer-alist))))
 (add-hook 'pdf-occur-buffer-mode-hook #'my-pdf-occur-buffer-mode-hook) ```
 Of course, I'm happy to learn if you have critiques of how I did this—or about any of this.

 Once you have your usual emacs in .emacs.default, you can for example create an empty .emacs.future (or any other name), and set it as a profile in .emacs-profiles.el. 
 Next, you can download emacs and build from source with native compilation if you'd like. Do not make install, rather we'll use the path to the newly built executable. 
 Since chemacs2 keeps everything emacs as calls to the default directory, you won't have to change much. 
 What you can do now, is alias to the more recent emacs executable with the future profile. For example, I put the emacs repo in ~/emacs. Meaning that I can do :
 alias ef="/my/home/emacs/src/emacs --with-profile future" 
 To use a different profile with the built from source executable. 
 Thanks to that I have two different versions of emacs with different init files, living together.

 I tried this from the org site.

 I am trying to define my own latex class. Below is the snippet of the code.

 I want the email to appear along with the author (if possible, including affiliation). It is exporting everything but email. Sorry for the space, because copy and paste are assuming every line is a new paragraph. 
 NOTE: I asked this question in Stack Overflow, and one person told me to use macro {{{email}}. It is accepting the email but not displaying it properly.

 the purpose of this post is two folds: 
  
help others who is learning elisp. It's easy to get started, but confusing at times just b/c there are so many unfamiliar concepts, both from emacs and from lisp. I surely wish someone else had written some deep-dive to help me ramp up faster. Thanks to everyone who helped me during my elisp learning. 
 I am planning to read in depth at least one small and common package per week. If you found this helpful, please recommend me with other small packages (<1000 lines) that's fun to use, fun to read. Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Emacs offers CUA-mode out of the box to address users expectations for normal C-c (copy), C-v (paste), C-z (undo) commands. Indeed, this is often an issue that comes up when I am teaching newcomers Emacs. So, why don't I hear about this being used more? Why don't I use it? Why was one of my joys in adopting EXWM the ability to use emacs shortcuts INSTEAD of CUA in other progams? Essentially I went the opposite direction.
 Even for those years when I was learning emacs, no part of me ever longed to regain the key bindings that were used everywhere else, and that is strange in retrospect. Was it because learning new keybindings was part of the emacs experience? Or because CUA bindings are already only relevant to Windows users and not Mac keybords? Was it because there is something qualitatively different about killing, yanking, and emacs' undo style than the copy-paste-undo of everything else? I admit, whenever I am forced into non-emacs programs, I do long for the kill ring.
 What do you think? Why is CUA-Mode so rarely brought up as a first step (and therefore rarely brought up at all)?

 I noticed that the code sent to chicken is this: (geiser#geiser-eval (quote #f) (quote (print "Chicken Test")) which is like a wrapper around my original code and might be what produces the error, but i'm not sure if thats the case or how to fix it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been trying to see what solutions are out there but couldn't really find any that I liked. What I want to do is to use the task management part of org mode remote (internet). There are solutions to sync files and then use different re-implementations of org mode on different devices but I want emacs to be the heart of it and not use re-implementations.
 What I'm thinking is something where I can send a command to the server where I have emacs and get a response with a subset of commands like :
  
List tasks (agenda)
 Mark task as done (maybe based on uid)
 Add things to inbox (to be processed when I'm at a computer)
  
I'm considering something like using email (could be similar to how http://www.gamerz.net/pbmserv/ works) or having an xmpp bot or something similar. Anyone who has done anything similar or seen any projects like this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello r/emacs.
 ​
 I have recently set up a neat feature for Emacs that I wanted to share with you. I am going to give you a short description of what this is supposed to be here, but for more details, and the required code snippets you can check my github repository where I also host my dotfiles.
 ​
 So, if you are tiling window manager user, you have probably heard of scratchpads. If you haven't, they are floating windows with predefined dimensions which are automatically hidden when they lose focus. Why is this useful you may ask? Well, I personally dislike leaving Emacs, especially when I want to write a large piece of text. But there are some things (mostly when I am doing something on the web, such as creating this reddit post) which I can't directly do in Emacs. This project tries to solve this project.
 ​
 I have basically set up my window manager of choice (qtile, but I do plan to try and make this for other window managers such as i3) to create a scratchpad of Emacs which opens in a placeholder file and an emacs command which when ran, copies the whole buffer to the clipboard and then deletes it from the file so it can be used again. This allows me to write everything in Emacs, in a small floating window which is visible whenever I need it and then hides itself when unneeded, using a placeholder file which is always empty and waiting for text to fill it. The setup is honestly very handy and I really like it, as the alternatives are somewhat annoying to use imo. 
 ​
 For more details, check the aforementioned git repo. I hope you will enjoy it. I personally really like the idea and as I couldn't find anyone who has done something similar, I thought I should share this here so you guys can see the idea and adopt it if you like. I will gladly answer any of your questions about this and try to persuade you that its got a reasonable use-case.

 I'm new to Emacs and I'm a copywriter - I write 3-5k words per day. I'm thinking about quitting libreoffice writer and switching to a keyboard-centric writing experience. I really like Emacs so far!
 The only concern I have is: Can I do these things with Emacs... And how easy is it to do these things:
 -bold a word or a sentence
 -italics
 -align a paragraph to center
 -export to .docx (most of my clients need that format, not a personal preference)
 ​
 Can emacs help me write text and accomplish these 4 things (just as easily or easier than with L.O. Writer)? 
 ​
 I admit, I'm a complete novice when it comes to this. When I tried searching online about these features I found some advanced tutorials on something called latex or pandoc or some other advanced programs. I'm really not a programmer, all I need is these 4 features in order to ditch LibreOffice writer. Can emacs help me with these things?
 Thank you

 I built from source today and installed emacs, I also tried to clean my emacs install and re-install it but it doesn't fix my issue. I didn't have that issue previously when I built from source a month ago. 
 Basically, emacs freezes completely only in some cases. I'd say that most of my usage does not provoke the freeze but for two cases (that I found). 
  
deft, anytime I open it it completely freezes emacs.
 
stan-mode when I try to edit a file. Opening the file works fine but if I try to edit anything, it freezes and I have to kill emacs.
 
 I tried package-reinstall, to no avail. 
 Other modes like org-mode or any other language I'm using or could think of, does work (Racket, Java, Python, Julia, SQL), etc. 
 I can't seem to get an error anywhere and when emacs freezes I have to kill it. If anyone has an idea I'd be grateful.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I would like to model software APIs in a best-practice-functional-programming manner. I am wondering how professionals typically go about this problem. What are existing best practices, and so forth.
 More specifically, for my current project, I want to model several geometric primitives (e.g., circle, sphere, triangle) such that I can effectively reason about them and use effective type-checking. I will render them with different backends, and will handle that elsewhere (e.g., JavaScript), but I want to be sure I am effectively modeling the geometric types.
 I'd like to use Haskell.
 The obvious way to go about this would be to begin writing data types in Haskell and potentially use that to generate other code via Template Haskell. Is there a flaw with this approach? I've considered using XML, or using Haskell to generate XML as an intermediate, but I'm not sure if that's necessary or flawed in some way.
 In general, I'd also like to use whatever approach I develop to model systems in the future. I'm not sure what the best way of going about it is. I'm wondering if anyone has any experience with this, or can point me to some references, so that I don't begin coding something that is doomed to be suboptimal for reasons known to those who know. Thank you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi. So, I made this thing awhile back originally in the context of developing a programming language which used a lot of Unicode math symbols (basically forcing variable-width fonts) and significant whitespace. Now I use it for all of my personal note files, and it seems like other people might find it useful so I'm releasing it.
 https://github.com/tenbillionwords/spaceship-mode
 ​
 spaceship-mode
 What this basically does is:
  
spaceship-mode makes spaces at the start of a line have their width automatically adjusted to align with previous text as they would in a fixed-width font. Example pictured.
 tabble-mode is an implementation of elastic tabstops.
  
Together these make it possible in principle to do every kind of alignment I have ever seen being useful in an actual programming or plaintext-note-taking situation.
 Using spaceship-mode absolutely requires adhering to the convention of using tabs for indentation and spaces for alignment. Unfortunately, that means these modes work very badly with stock Emacs, yet I am not providing any kind of user-interface features such as commands to help use and maintain the indentation conventions, or any keybindings at all. It wouldn't do to just quickly slap something together, because Emacs' assumption of fixed-width fonts is fairly deeply entrenched in its design, and peeps have very different preferences and methods for dealing with indentation in general. (And I'm not providing my own full setup because...reasons.) So if you want to get this working well, you'll have to do some work to integrate it into your own system. The “Example Setup” in the readme may give some indication of how to start doing this.
 P.S. Thanks to the r/emacs folks who originally helped me figure out how to do this!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[All,
 I'm now using emacs and mu4e for quite few months and I have one remaining concern which is formatting when replying to emails.
 Let's take the following example as my original email:
  
This is the emails chain. This paragraph runs on several lines and is recognized as is on the original email. All of that matches line 1. But when replying to this email, there's now (random?) line breaks inserted here and there. 
 empty line #1 
 The next paragraph starts here.
  
​
 When I reply to this email, the cited text will have (random?) line breaks insertion and all empty lines will be doubled (i.e. one additional empty line will be created for each original empty line). So I end up with something like this:
  
My response to you. 
 Best, 
 RedGuilou 
 --citation follows this line (read-only)-- 
 This is the emails chain. This paragraph runs on several lines and is recognized as is on the original email. All of that matches line 1. But when replying to this email, 
 there's now (random?) line breaks inserted here and there. 
 empty line #1 
 empty line #2 
 The next paragraph starts here.
  
​
 This does not look very professional when replying to my clients and it's boring to correct the formatting on every single email (especially when the emails chain is quite long).
 I'm using org mode to write my emails in case that matters. Any clues on what to investigate to solve this issue would be greatly appreciated.
 Thanks !

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm hiring a Haskell dev in the UK for my team at Standard Chartered bank. My team sits in front office and has about 20 Haskell devs (well, technically Mu, our in-house variant). There are many other Haskell teams at Standard Chartered and you may have seen other hiring announcements recently, but these are distinct positions. Do reach out to me directly if you're interested and have any questions, but applications should go via our website: https://scb.taleo.net/careersection/ex/jobdetail.ftl?job=2100012204&lang=en&HRS_SUBSOURCE_ID=1804
 ​
 Standard Chartered supports (practically fully) remote working, but only from the country of payroll -- UK in this case.

 Ex:
 * TODO top-level thing [0/1] ** This is a sub-item / requirement for top-level 
 output Ex:
 ...: [time].... TODO top-level thing [0/1] ...: [time] .... TODO This is a sub-item / ... 
 I'm sure there's probably a way to do this sort of thing with org-super-agenda or some fancy org-ql thing but before I run down that trail perhaps someone has a workable partial or full solution?
 Thx!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm a Haskell newbie. I've tried to get into Haskell development several times, since I love the language, but I've always had issues with tooling.
 My preferred editor is VS Code on Windows, and the Haskell extension seems to provide most features I need.
 Unfortunately, I also have a small hard drive (256 GB) which is mostly occupied. When I used Stack or Haskell Platform in the past, the size of my user directory often reached 20-30 GB due to installed versions of compilers and dependencies, which is too much. I've never had this issue with other languages (rustup or npm only ever take a couple GBs on my PC despite heavy usage).
 Since this is probably unavoidable, I need a way to install GHC, Cabal, Haskell Language Server and all other tools in a completely isolated and portable directory, so that I can just delete or move them away from my PC until needed, while leaving global user directories intact.
 The most obvious solution would probably be Docker, but I'm not sure if it's supported on Windows 10 Home.
 Is there a way to configure both Cabal and Haskell Language Server in a completely portable/non-intrusive manner?
 Thanks!

When asked what's "the most important thing they want students to gain after each class," teachers will always say that they want students to "really understand" the lecture. But as Krathwohl (2002) put it, this is an ambiguous term; they haven't articulated what it means when a student "really understands."
And without a common definition of how well students understand the material, making exams that test understanding would produce large variability.

 I have the following challenge. I would like to open vim from my Scala CLI application... 
 I would like to achieve similar functionality as can be seen when you use git - it opens your editor of choice when committing stuff; allows you to do the editions there and let the user exit vim; then the git picks up and proceeds with its things.
 However, that has proven to be way more tricky than I initially thought. 😅
 How should I approach this; can u please point me in the right direction,... Are there any libs that I could use to handle this; if so which? Can this thing be also "ported" to things like GraalVM if want to package this as native-image at some point?
 A silly example that I've made that uses scala.sys.process; where I thought I should start...
  def editor = sys.env.getOrElse("EDITOR", "vim") def spawnEditor(editor: String) = { val r = Seq(editor, "/tmp/test.md").!! r } 
 Thanks for your help and have a nice day!

 I need some help.
 I am looking for a better way of working in a node.js / typescript environment. I want to start with creating a dirty repl. This is a huge project and it has a large amount of dependencies, with many many layers.
 One idea I had is to create a REST endpoint within the app on my computer only, that will eval all code sent with the GET request and respond either with {success: result} or {error: message}.
 Now I created a custom keybind, that sends the code that I selected in emacs with a GET request to that endpoint and that works beautifully.
 Here is where I am stuck though, if there was an error (because I am evaluating js code of thisGreatFunction(unsetVariable) {doSomethingWith(usetVarbable)} because unsetVariable and the function doSomethingWith are obviously not defined). This is also where it gets dirty.
 My next thought was to push back on the user in emacs with the error message and let him open a new buffer where he can change the js code sent, ideally also caching the previous responses so he can build a reportoire of code that loads needed sets of dependencies quickly.
 Any ideas on how to make this sort of interactivity happen?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello there,
 Is there anyway I can create a generator in Scalacheck that allows me to get not only distinct values but also the list with the exact size I send generate and not less
 Gen.listOfN allows duplicates, and although Gen.containerOfN[Set, String] allows me to get only distinct values, it can then generate less values that the N I pass to the method.
 I writed this method, but it's a little "hack", since it would be great if this worked with returning a Generator and not the List already
 ​
  def createDistinctList[A](i: Int, gen: Gen[A]): List[A] = def createDistinctListAux(i: Int, gen: Gen[A], res: List[A]): List[A] = i match case 0 => res case _ => { val generated = for { value <- gen } yield value val x = generated.sample.get val newI = if x == None || res.contains(x) then i else i - 1 val newRes = if x == None || res.contains(x) then res else res :+ x createDistinctListAux(newI, gen, newRes) } createDistinctListAux(i, gen, Nil) 
 I tried with res.contains(generated) and returning a generator of list, but it didn't work, it only worked this way.
 Any help is appreciated, thank you.
 (Scala 3 btw)

 Does anyone have any recommendations for working with yaml (I wish the answer could be "don't" because I hate it...)?
 Yaml mode is providing some features but it doesn't have the syntax highlighting I'd like, and it doesn't seem to be indentation aware, which makes reformatting files a pain.
 For example, it'd be nice if mark-sexp worked to mark by indentation level.

 Writing to announce a new functional UI programming paradigm and implementation for Haskell. Features a declarative programming model, rendering polymorphism, no FRP constructs, single source of truth, and convenient composition of components via lenses.
 She sure is a Shpadoinkle website (written as statically generated Shpadoinkle)
 Full support for
  
single-page applications (routing with Servant!)
 static site generation
 server-side rendering
 time travel debugging (maturing)
 live reloads with GHCID
 growing widgets library with common types for UI baked in. 
  
Actively maintained by Platonic Systems.
 This work was originally motivated by a desire to capture the lessons I have learned from a decade of working with different UI technologies. As well as a desire to have the benefits of The Elm Architecture without compromising on compositionally, or being forced to use a nerfed language (Elm). Shpadoinkle drops through the abstract floor to uncover the simplicity in the substructure of UI programming. While systems like Reflex offer a recursively Monadic structure, and Elm offers merely Functorial structure, Shpadoinkle is not even a Covariant Functor.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I had a line using diredfl, to give me the permission line visual I wanted. However, I had to go back to my code and re-evaluate the use-package line every session or else I just had font coloring instead. A character inspection revealed that it was indeed applying diredfl faces, but apparently just the default ones, not the ones I was defining. Here was my not-working-until-reeval line:
 Not working invocation (custom)
 (use-package diredfl :demand t :config (add-hook 'dired-mode-hook 'diredfl-mode) :custom (diredfl-dir-name '((t (:foreground "#3679D8" :box (:line-width 2 :color "grey75" :style released-button))))) (diredfl-dir-priv '((t (:foreground "#3679D8" :underline t)))) (diredfl-exec-priv '((t (:background "#79D836" :foreground "black")))) (diredfl-read-priv '((t (:background "#D8B941" :foreground "black")))) (diredfl-write-priv '((t (:background "#D83441" :foreground "black"))))) 
 Working invocation (custom-face)
 Notice the only difference is that I'm using custom-face, which enables removing the quote from the face definitions. So the question is, why does this fix the problem? What is :custom failing to do (timing wise) that :custom-face is managing?
 (use-package diredfl :demand t :config (add-hook 'dired-mode-hook 'diredfl-mode) :custom-face (diredfl-dir-name ((t (:foreground "#3679D8" :box (:line-width 2 :color "grey75" :style released-button))))) (diredfl-dir-priv ((t (:foreground "#3679D8" :underline t)))) (diredfl-exec-priv ((t (:background "#79D836" :foreground "black")))) (diredfl-read-priv ((t (:background "#D8B941" :foreground "black")))) (diredfl-write-priv ((t (:background "#D83441" :foreground "black")))))

 Say I have a table called "sprites" that defines positional indexes into a sprite sheet:
 #+NAME: sprites | Name | Row | Col | |--------+-----------| | Bob | 2 | 3 | | Joe | 5 | 6 | 
 That gets passed into a block of C++ code as a variable and used for rendering. So far so good. But now I want to use that data to show the sprites in the org document itself. I have a macro that takes an integer index and links to the sprite image (presliced from the sprite sheet for simplicity):
 #+MACRO: sprite [[ ./path/to/sprite-$1.png ]] 
 This gets called like:
 {{{sprite(123)}}} 
 Which works fine. But can I make a macro that takes two arguments and multiplies them (row * width + col) together, like so:
 {{{sprite(2,3)}}} 
 ... and links the sprite for Bob? Or am I limited to simple text replacement? If macros aren't the right tool for this, what is?
 And one step further, can I somehow just do:
 {{{sprite(Bob)}}} 
 ?

 and I have these key bindings over this package:
 "{" "}" "V" "N" "O" "E" "S" "C-s" "C-a" "C-f" "C-y" "C-;" "C-e" "C-r" "C-o" 
 does any of these keybindings conflict with any mode or do they override anything ?I'm worried because I don't know if I should use `C-xyz` for my keybindings...Cause some packages like multiple cursor use `C-'`, does that mean I can't use `C-punctuations` at all?Are we even allowed to use `C-xyz` as our keybindings? or `C-,./()'{};\`? or even `Upper case letters...`?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone.
I began using ZK several months ago and encountered a following conundrum.
I divide notes into two generic classes: core notes and inbox. Inbox consists of notes I might need to work upon in the future.  My inbox keeps growing much faster in volume than my core notes. There're three main sources of its growth.
Firstly, I regularly read professional feeds with a wide range of information that I have no time to integrate right now. Mostly this is a specific momentarily info that might be unavailable in the future (or simply hard to find) so saving it seems pretty important to me.
On the one hand, this inbox propagation seems natural to me - I find that diving into that knowledge dump from time to time turns out pretty useful. And the power of weak connections works with notes as much as with people.
Maybe somebody wants to comment on this? Have you been in a similar situation?]]></summary>

Anyway, I had to debug something yesterday and so was using my own solution that I knocked up a few weeks ago in order to learn some Elisp. It's a bit "overkill" in that it supports 3 different "display the docstring" front ends, but it defaults to posframe (which works now BTW) and I find it really, really useful. Just enable el-docstring-sap-mode and you're away. I even documented it.... I did one years ago, but this is a refresh. it doesnt do anything clever - the "links" in the pop are non operational...
 ​
 Note: you need to clone it, add it to path etc or just use straight.el. I wont rehash how to do all that, GIYF.

How do you process research that's based on shaky assumptions? By "shaky" I mean that in the middle of reading, you figured that the authors were either assuming that a specific concept is true, or are implying that the specific concept applies to their study's context.
So for example, a lot of other studies are based on Zeigarnik Effect, but other studies on the same concept have failed to replicate the phenomenon. Or implying that the "need for cognitive closure" applies to the "task" context, even when the cited paper refers to closure in the context of beliefs.
Their results would fit nicely into their assumptions and hypotheses, but the assumptions themselves don't hold up based on the other papers.
So if you were in my place, do you think the experiments woul…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a large Hydra for smartparens navigation/actions, and because I want to restrict the height of the Hydra window to preserve space for the main window, the Hydra hints get cut off at the right edge of the screen. So I created a second Hydra and linked Hydra #1 and Hydra #2 together via designated keys (as explained here). 
 The problem is that I’ve memorized many of the bindings associated with both Hydra #1 and Hydra #2, and I want to use all bindings at any time, regardless of whether Hydra #1 or Hydra #2 is showing. This means I have to add every binding relevant to smartparens to BOTH defhydra definitions. This takes up a lot of space in my init.el, and it’s not as simple as copy-pasting because I don’t want hints that show up in Hydra #1 to show up in Hydra #2 (and vice versa), so I have to change the string hints to nil or change nil to string hints as appropriate. 
 I’ve partially solved this last problem by having Hydra #2 inherit the bindings of Hydra #1 with the following:
 (set-keymap-parent hydra-smartparens2/keymap hydra-smartparens1/keymap) 
 However, I can’t simultaneously have Hydra #1 inherit Hydra #2's bindings, as this creates the error cyclic keymap inheritance. Thus, unless I’m missing something (and I hope I am), some copy-pasting from Hydra #2 to Hydra #1 is still necessary.
 It would be great if I could have a single Hydra for smartparens that possessed a height limit and could be scrolled to see the hints that get cut off, like which-key allows. Different displays vary greatly in the horizontal screen real estate they allow. Should I check out hercules.el, or is there an obvious solution I’m missing? 
 P.S. I’m not complaining about Hydra, it is a genius package!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi All
 Long time lurker and first-time (I think?) poster. Anyways, I implemented the Lamport one-time signature scheme a while back in Haskell and wanted to share.
 https://github.com/difelicemichael/lamport-haskell
 It also includes a module solely for the purposes of illustrating the dangers of key-reuse in this signature scheme.
 ​
 As with anything cryptography related, it's always best not to reinvent the wheel, so it goes without saying that the module is not production-ready / suitable. Still though, couldn't resist the urge to share, comments / criticisms are welcome (and encouraged!).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am stumped by some strange behavior in the org mode clock. I use the clock timer (C-x C-i) to time myself when working in different files, and it has always worked a treat. But recently I cleaned up the structure of my org folder, which had lots of subfolders for different clients. I moved all of these folders from /org into a new folder, /org/archive, to give myself a nice clean place to work. Now, however, when I try to start the clock timer, emacs refuses and instead shows me this:
 Use M-x make-directory RET RET to create the directory and its parents [165 times] apply: Setting current directory: No such file or directory, /home/me/org/client-folder/ 
 Where client-folder is the name of a client. I'm guessing that it's trying to check all of my existing files for dangling, unclosed timers, but I don't need it to do that. 
 I tried deleting the org-clock-save.el file in my emacs directory, which the program then recreated, but this is empty. 
 What's telling emacs to look for files in their old directories, and how can I make it stop, or at least redirect it to the new directory path?

 I have been using Emacs for Org Mode on an old mac from some time now. I have bought a Macbook pro and have installed Emacs.
 I have a Dropbox account where I have placed my .emacs.d folder and its contents in, including the init.el and the *.org files I use for the GTD system.
 On the Macbook, I have entered the following code in the init.el file so that my settings and files will be usable on the macbook and the experience will be the same as on my Mac desktop.
 I have setup the following code in the init.el file on my latop
 (setq user-init-file "~/Dropbox/.emacs.d/")
 However when loading emcacs it just loads vanilla emacs.
 Also, when i use Dired to navigate to the dropbox location where i have some .org files located, if I try open a file it fails stating:
 "File exists, but cannot be read"
 ​
 Any guidance appreciated.

I think it could be useful to many people here, especially those who are unsure about what they should include in a Zettel. It helped me get a better idea of how to structure a single note in a way that's useful to me (i.e. for academic research in the humanities and social sciences broadly, and philosophy in particular, with the goal of producing academic papers and other nonfiction writing). But I think it could be useful to anyone reading or writing argumentative non-fiction. At best I think it could help combat a somewhat relativistic tendency I've noticed in online ZK/PKM communities.

 I've found something similar to the IO monad in RxJava, with the Single data type, but once I name RxJava, people assume I'm looking for a streams library and start suggesting stuff I'm not looking for.
 I'm looking for a library that allows me to build effects easily. From futures, completion stages, callbacks, etc. Also I'm looking if it has operators to zip effects in parallel or ideally, a fiber based concurrency model.
 I'm not looking for a streams library, not looking for libraries for distributed computing.

 If I do C-x right or C-x b I can switch the buffer shown in the current window. I have a layout where one frame can have some windows with some buffer. I want to separate all the buffers started in the current frame from other frames so I cant open a buffer from hobby project in a frame I am working on my emacs files. So it should not be possible to switch to a buffer started in another frame.
 Also like *Messages* shouldnt be possible to switch to. Maybe theese should be in a separate frame to separate them from others. Then I could still access them if I wanted to.
 My idea is that I want to have a frame for each project that I am working and it should only be possible to switch to the relevant buffers.
 If anything is unclear, please ask me :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I like to have imenu-list open while I am programming in Python to have an outline of my file and a list of functions/classes that I can quickly access (side question: are there better packages for this functionality?).
 However, when I open that list then switch the buffer to a different non-python file that I don't need such a list for, I have to manually close that window only to open it back when I switch back to my Python buffer. 
 I am wondering if there's a way to designate a particular window as a "child" of the buffer. So that everytime I switch to that buffer the window is automatically created and then destroyed when I switch away from the "parent" buffer. 
 I could probably code it myself by advising set-buffer, splitting the window if the buffer is a python-buffer and closing it if the old buffer is a python one. But I am wondering if there are better solutions out there.

 I was wondering, what is the consensus for the best version of eMacs on Mac? And is there a port better compatible with M1?
 I saw that mitsuharu Yamamoto’s port was appreciated, but recent posts (1 year ago... there is not a lot of osX users here!) seems to indicate that the NS version was more stable...
 In the past, I used eMacs and org with Ubuntu and WSL, but as I am switching my workflow to Mac, I am tinkering on having a native app installed (rather than using a VM for emacs...). I’ve used my Mac M1 extensively, and faced hundred of bugs and issues with intel based software (from VDI and OBS support to screen through Bluetooth etc)
 Thanks for your feedbacks!

So far it only has recipes for the two versions of ElixirLS that I am using, so I eagerly invite any contributions, questions, or feedback. I started this because I could not find any existing Dockerfiles for language servers, and I hope this can fill that gap for others.

I've been fiddling with writing transcoders for org publish and I'm confused about what is probably a simple data type. I'd google it if I knew what to type.. I'm exporting a table with a caption, so I add the property: #+CAPTION: This is Caption. Ok, so I can pull the :caption property from the table's plist, but the value is wrapped in triple parentheses when I format it to a string: (((This is Caption))) When I try to do things like mapconcat it, the type object is displayed a bit differently: (#("This is Caption" 0 15 (:parent #0))) 
 So now I'm closer, I know this is a list of text properties, right? So I can use car to get the string, but only if I nest it three times over the list: (car (car (car caption))) but there has to be a better way, right?

 In other words, I'd be interested in a list of, say, the top 3-5 patterns which, when frequently used in a program's source code, are the most likely to incur a performance drop that cannot be traced to anything else than their Core implementation. (Thus I am not really interested in performance costs caused by "choosing the wrong data structure".)
 Of course there's the suspicion that these "likely performance-killers when used frequently" will be symptoms of bad design decisions from the application author:
  
evaluating too often (i.e. excessive case pattern matching, incurring unnecessary computations)
 evaluating too rarely (i.e. excessive lazyness, incurring unnecessary garbage collection)
  
I am also interested in real life examples involving these, but perhaps a bit more in patterns that are likely to jam GHC optimization capabilities.

Both are remote-friendly (and the entire team is widely geographically distributed). Due to where Arista has offices, and related paperwork constraints, applicants in US/Canada/Ireland/India are strongly preferred.
 While we initially have a fairly tight notion of what the work we're hiring into is going to be, over time both positions have plenty of room to grow and take on other projects (also in Haskell) throughout our codebase, or even greenfield new stuff. Both also offer the opportunity to work with a really great team of seasoned Haskell devs, as well as nix contributors, etc.

But I have a few questions about the emacs program, mainly about security and privacy.
 Who maintains emacs? Are there regular updates for the program?
 I'm looking for a safe and private place to put all my notes, how do I know emacs is secure and private? What's to stop the program from uploading my notes somewhere? (again, I am not that tech savy so please excuse me)
 Do I need to learn emacs before using orgmode?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Now that I have used backpack in raaz which has internally simplified the package quite a bit. However there are some ergonomic issues in their use at-least in raaz.
  
Firstly, I am not sure why backpack performs the mixing and matching in the .cabal file. I feel it makes the .cabal file rather large and unwieldy. The raaz.cabal is close to 900 lines of code with no real way to split it up. It is probably one of the biggest file in the repository
 
The documentation story is not very nice. Say Module A which depends on Signature Sig in an internal module. Now suppose the top library wants expose a version of A with some module mixed in for Sig, all the documentation of the functions defined are lost. One can solve this as this can be seen here. https://github.com/raaz-crypto/raaz/blob/master/raaz/Raaz/Digest.hs Documenting the functions in the source module (A in this case) is not useful because it is not visible one has to repeat this again in the outside exposed module. Whereas writing the documentation close to the function definition (in module A) make more sense.
 
Mismatch between documentation for hackage vs created by cabal haddock.
 
 I think 2,3 are probably bugs, or there is a way to handle it that I do not know about, but 1 is a design choice. It is curious because ghc supports .bkp files which is not recommended though. Currently .bkp files are only used to include test cases in ghc the compiler or to demonstrate backpack.

 Emacs is a bit more complicated, though; there are a lot more places where I want to select from a list of completions, so packages need to both be good for selecting from lists of symbols as well as lists of files.

 ​
 The closest thing to this that I found is putting an "agenda" block in my custom agenda view and using org-agenda-clockreport-mode. The problem with this approach is that there's no way to set the time range of this table the way I want. If I set a different time range in org-agenda-clockreport-parameter-plist, the function that displays this clock table overwrites it internally.
 ​
 It would be best if I could just put a custom clock table to the top of my agenda view by hand somehow. Which hooks or functions am I supposed to use to write custom text in an agenda buffer?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm using Emacs on a Mac and mostly have it open full screen. Sometimes I want to quickly open a new frame that's not full screen (e.g., to put it next to a browser window), while keeping the full screen Emacs window/frame intact.
 To achieve this, I wrote the following function:
 (defun efls/new-frame () "Create a new frame and ensure it's not full screen." (interactive) (make-frame) ;; Return from fullscreen, if fullscreen (when (memq (frame-parameter nil 'fullscreen) '(fullscreen fullboth)) (toggle-frame-fullscreen))) 
 My only problem is that apparently, the toggle-frame-fullscreen also impacts the original full screen Emacs window/frame.
 Does anyone have an idea what causes this? Or any other suggestions to improve this small convenient function?
 EDIT: So apparently toggle-frame-fullscreen can take FRAME as optional parameter. How can I point it to the current frame?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I don't want to stir up more drama, but the cat's already out the bag. I am a channel operator of #evil-mode@Freenode. There is very little going on in the channel, but it has several very knowledgeable people in it. In the last few days there has been a push for many channels to migrate from Freenode to Libera due to mismanagement. I've set up #evil-mode@Libera to make it easy to find, but have been approached by an #emacs@Libera representative while trying to chanop status for #emacs-circe@Libera (I already have chanop for #emacs-circe@Freenode). That individual suggested me that #evil-mode@Libera might be better named #emacs-evil@Libera to fit into the Emacs namespace and profit from management by several channel operators.
 I find this idea highly intriguing, but don't want to impose the mental burden of people having to migrate from #evil-mode to #emacs-evil, especially for a Libera-only thing (the existing Freenode channel is still there, though slowly thinning out). Therefore the following options are on the table:
 a) Leave things as is, with #evil-mode@Libera following the existing naming
 b) Create #emacs-evil@Libera, set up a redirect from #evil-mode@Libera to #emacs-evil@Libera and adjust documentation accordingly
 c) Other (explain in your comment what other option you see)

 It looks like this (1 big cell and 4 smaller ones):
 ​
  
 big cell 1 small cell 1 
  
 big cell 1 small cell 2 
  small cell 3 small cell 4 
 
 Now I have 2 questions regarding my plan:
 - How do I construct something like that (as far as I know, org-mode does not support such merged tables)?- How do I make it reusable? I mean, there must be a better way than creating a file for each and every day or manually deleting the content of such a table every day.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I would like to make a instalation guide to be run with no graphical environment. 
 The idea is to have a guide that the person can read and execute the commands from within emacs, without need to type/copy/paste the commands. When the person executes a code block, a buffer with a term with the command inputted is created.
 * step 1 Explanation bla bla bla #+BEGIN_SRC screen :session my_session command #+END_SRC 
 The example above uses org-mode and ob-screen(org-babel-screen) but I can make it works only with need xterm This way the command is inputted in another desktop window outside emacs running xterm. I guess it also works with others terminal emulators that runs in graphical environments. 
 But as I mentioned I need a solution able to run in tty. Would be possible to use ob-screen with term/vterm inside emacs? Other possible solutions?
 Some extra considerations:
 In some steps the commands are interactives, you need to give some some answers, select stff etc. 
 ob-tmux is a valid alternative to ob-screen but seens to have the same restriction.

 When I start emacs it'll just spit out x's, c's or c-c's until I c-g or interrupt it with an arrow key for example. Any ideas what could be causing this? Thanks in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a series of emacs files that define some of the more elaborate customization areas of my setup, such as orgmode, and gnus. The practice of keeping the setup in separate files is not the question; the advantage it gives for maintaining/tracking setup-specific questions makes it an easy win. However, right now I'm basically doing a load-file from my emacs.el to bring any of them in. My question is, should I instead by making them packages and loading them that way (e.g. finishing my gnus file with provides my/gnus-setup)? Is there a good reason for doing this instead of a floating .el file when it's just me using them? And if so, does anyone have an example of this process, particularly how you load them/add them to your load path?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am in a situation where there is a suite of packages that is presently unmaintained by the original author. I have attempted to submit patches back upstream from my fork, however, there has been no response on GitHub, where the repository is currently hosted. I have also separately sent an email to the maintainer address specified in the cabal file and received no response.
 I am generally of the opinion that letting packages fragment due to maintainer absence is a generally bad thing when the ecosystem is small and could otherwise accrete contributions from outsiders. I am now puzzling over how I should proceed. The way I see it my only option left is to republish to hackage under a different name, further exacerbating fragmentation. This also leaves the question of how to name the package, whether naming it as a derivative name is appropriate or whether I should name it something else entirely. Is there any unspoken rules about how package naming should be done in situations like this (or even more generally)?

 I just know that I somehow have to give out a (+1) Whenever it is not Empty and a 0 on the router. My thought process is it gives out (+1) that accumulate on the router that has gives a value of 0 and then all those (+1) act on it. But I am not quite sure.

 The s-s binding works fine, but the s-a binding does not. Running describe-key s-a reveals that Emacs sees the s-a binding as C-a.
 The same is true when I try to bind s-z, s-x, s-v, s-c (and some, but not all, others).
 I have no idea how to even diagnose this. Any idea what's happening here?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am trying to make an extension to the wonderful Deft package that can preview/view files in a side window of the Deft buffer (similar to the functionality of the original Notational Velocity). Deft normally takes a set of text files and for each file, displays a widget in the Deft buffer that, when pressed/clicked, opens the corresponding file. For my extension, I would like the file to be opened in the side window with that window having focus, but with the Deft buffer window still visible. I have had some success getting this to work, but I came across a situation with different behaviors depending whether one "presses" the file widget (by hitting [RET] when the point is on a file widget), or one "clicks" the file widget (by clicking the widget with the mouse):
  
If the file is opened by hitting [RET] (invoking widget-button-press), the file is opened in the side window below and the file’s window now has focus. This is the desired behavior that I want.
 If the file is opened by clicking with the mouse (invoking widget-button-click), the file is opened in the side window below, but the focus remains with the Deft buffer. This is not the desired behavior.
  
To demonstrate this phenomenon, I have made a "minimal" example of it in a package I call "Daft": 
 https://github.com/shankar2k/daft
 How can I make a widget-button-click action that can switch focus to a different window other than the current one?

 Incidentally, something else is wrong in my org setup, because the first time I want to open an org-file, I get
 Debugger entered--Lisp error: (void-function org-agenda-set-mode-name)

 I tried updating org-mode to today's version of 20210524, but no avail. I no longer have a custom definition of org-agenda-set-mode-name in my init.el, but still it seems emacs does not want to pick up the default orgmode implementation of that function.

 data Transaction = Deposit {contructorName :: String, value :: Float} | Withdrawal {contructorName :: String, value :: Float} deriving Show 
 but that seems redundant because I have to run Deposit "Deposit" 20.5 to create a deposit.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to make Emacs correctly jump into problematic file when I'm running C-x p c make test RET, which runs makefile test target. The problem is, that when error occurs, the error path is correctly detected in *compilation* buffer, but because there are two spaces before the actual path Emacs can't find the file. For example, here's the output:
 stack traceback: [C]: in function 'assert' tests/multivalues-test.fnl:17: in main chunk [C]: in function 'xpcall' /home/andreyorst/.luarocks/bin/fennel:4398: in function ? [C]: in ? make: *** [Makefile:32: test] Error 1 
 Here, when I press RET on the tests/multivalues-test.fnl:17: in main chunk line, Emacs tries to open " tests/multivalues-test.fnl" file (two leading spaces are included as part of the path (reddit strips those even in backticks for some reason)).
 I've tried modifying compilation-error-regexp-alist-alist variable by adding there the following regex as per this SO question answer
 (add-to-list 'compilation-error-regexp-alist-alist '(fennel "^.*\\([a-zA-Z/][^\n:]+\\):\\([0-9]+\\):" 1 2)) 
 But no luck, Emacs still tries to open path with leading spaces. Any tips? Thanks.
  
Note, pressing RET on the second error line /home/andreyorst/.luarocks/bin/fennel:4398: in function ? opens correct file. I think because it begins with the / Emacs can find correct path start char.

 ​
 any idea or recommendations or examples how to ship yasnippets with a major mode? 
 ​
 Ideally, users only need to install the package with "M-x package-install" and no more setup, i think i can update the "yas/snippet-dirs" and setup the snippets files correctly, but since this is my first major mode, i'd greatly appreciate if someone can point me to an example or just tell me if there is better way of doing this.

There will be a short span of time (an hour or two) where the website is inaccessible. While https://hackage.haskell.org is inaccessible you won't be able to use it to browse packages and documentation.
 However, cabal-install and stack should continue to work thanks to mirroring, and the process should be automatic.
 If you do need to configure manual mirrors of the package repository, the urls are
 http://objects-us-east-1.dream.io/hackage-mirror/ and http://hackage.fpcomplete.com/
 As usual we will post manual status updates at https://status.haskell.org/
 EDIT: The data transfer is taking longer than we hoped, though all else is going well with the new server. We will hopefully perform the cutover (with attendant downtime) tomorrow.

I then wondered how useful it might be for the wide variety of technical things I read for work and pleasure and whether it might serve a similar purpose to allow for finding new connections between otherwise disparate topics or even items within a topic.  The jury is still out for me.  For example, I recently wrote about 30 Zettels for AWS security related topics.  I allowed my thought process to develop as a function of what I was reading, attempting to ask the same sort of questions I ask for non-tech things.  I don't feel the same sort of power doing it for tech stuff yet.  The weird cross connects don't seem to manifest as much or maybe since it's a new way for me to look at tech it will take some time to get used to it.
I'd be curious to see if any developers, hackers or RE's have used it for tech stuff and how they felt it went.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I may have requested this feature in the past, but I think this shows a better use case.
I'm often using the Omni Bar for searching with terms and Boolean operators for notes that might be relevant to create links. This is how I interact with my archive. For me, full text search rules! Everything else is secondary.
Once I enter a search and move the focus forward to check the returned notes, I can't get back to my search query by hitting the back button. I can go back to prior notes, but it would be beneficial if I'd be able to come across my search query amongst the note history so I could change it without having to remember and retype it two or three times as I refine my query and narrow the focus.
It would be helpful if the omni bar's history included user inputted queries. Its not a full history of the omni bars activity if it doesn't include user inputted searches.
For example, if I query with the omni bar prompts writing and I start looking at the notes returned and decide this is not broad enough of a search. I am tempted to use the "Back" function to try to restore to my prior state. I want to edit the search to prompts AND 'writing OR blogging but it is not there to be edited, so I have to remember what I already searched for and retype it.]]></summary>

 Today I had a look at the VOSK-API and open-source speech to text engine and was pleasantly surprised to find it's quite usable.
 I've put together a small utility for Linux that can be configured to dictate while a key is pressed.
 I'd imagine there is potential for Emacs to take advantage of this kind of functionality too, has anyone currently doing anything with dictation in a Emacs?
 The utility is linked here (although it's not Emacs spesific).

 I'm currently writing a parser for a simple DSL and want to write a test where I load a file from disk, feed it to the parser, and study the output produced by the parser, something like an integration/system test if you want. I'm currently using hspec for unit tests and stack.
 My question is, what would be the best way to achieve this?
 1) is hspec the right tool for this kind of job? 2) how can I get the path of the file to load(assuming its in a know location in the same repo)?
 Thanks a lot and happy haskelling.

 are there any elegant ways of doing this without creating tones of variables ?

 Any one know the shortcut for typing hex number in Emacs calc?
 Currently I always have to input prefix "16#" for input "16#AB".
 And the yank "0xAB" is invalid, it require type input "16#AB" manually.
 I want to know, is there any shortcut like enter xAB instead enter 16#AB, or o67 instead 8#67, or b10 instead 2#10?

 It is hard to debug, because I don't see any errors or warnings. All packages are up to date (and had the same issue since a while).
 I have a REPL driven workflow with elpy, lsp-mode(pyright) and pyvenv.
 The process keeps dying randomly - either after a random command or just on idle. I have to re-activate the env and reload everything and since this can happen even after a few seconds, it is very annoying.
 This repeats many times in a fresh session, but the frequency at some point decreases and I can eventually work for tens of minutes without it dying...
 Did somebody run into a similar issue?

 I'm running different operations in a single DB transaction in one of my domain services. For this reason I have a repository, that returns Doobie's ConnectionIOs, which I then "flatmap" to get transactional semantics. I was wondering if you know any good technique(s) to hide this implementation detail, or you just live with it in your project(s).
 Example psuedocode:
 trait UserRepository[F[_]] {
 def insert(user: User): ConnectionIO[Unit]
 }
 ​
 class UserService[F[_]](xa: Transactor[F]) {
 def create(user: User): F[Unit] =
 (for {
 _ <- insert(user)
 _ <- sendEmail(user).to[ConnectionIO] // << can we hide ConnectionIO here? What about transactor?
 } yield ()).transact(xa)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am reading Functional Programming in Scala book, In the chapter 3 & 4 the author has introduced list and optional types for data structure and error handling. What I observed is, the author is creating a data type and data constructs and using Companion object or trait body to declare the functionalities. He is using pattern matching, based on the match respective case function is executed and on top using higher order functions to work with this data types by generalizing the pure functions and passing these pure functions to HOF
 For Example 
 trait List[A]
 case object Nil extends List[Nothing]
 case class Cons[A](head:A,tail:Cons:List[A]) extends List[A]
 In the book, He used a companion object List
 object List {
 // some functions to manipulate the list data type 
 }
 ​
 the pattern is similar for option data type as well but all the functions are implemented in trait body
 My question is what is the need to do things this way ?. May be I am not seeing the big picture and looking from the perspective of creating data types and HOF's to manipulate them. How does this helps composing program.

 Mine used to be just fine until I upgraded to Emacs 27.2.
 Here is the affected Yasnippet that I have placed in '~/.emacs.d/snippets/org-mode/src' whose aim is to just override the default non-Caps version of the same idea:

 Doing your taxes is no fun. But functional programming can ease the pain. In this post I describe and demonstrate the Haskell tax library, which provides data types and combinators for defining taxes.

Would this be considered a good example of the one-file Zettelkasten?

Say you have accumulated a lot of notes from different books. But after reading the primary sources rather than the books, you now have a different view as compared to your existing atomic notes where you just relied on an author's interpretation.
Do you:
Update your existing notes, even if they're well-linked to already?
Create a new one and link to the existing?
Create structure note that generalizes both?
Do both #2 and #3?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I defined a new custom variable with defcustom with a set/initialize function that does what I want, but now I want to be able to set that variable easily from a hydra. Calling customize-set-variable on its own or with M-x works, but then I have to select which variable I want to set. What I want to do is call (customize-set-variable 'my-custom-variable) from a hydra option to jump straight to setting the value for that specific variable, but customize-set-variable requires 2 arguments, so that doesn't work. 
 However, I noticed that the embark package does somehow get exactly the behaviour I want, but I'm having trouble understanding how it works so I can replicate it. In embark, customize-set-variable is in embark-variable-map, and selecting that action jumps straight to setting the value for the target variable. I've been reading through the embark source and trying various things and just failing to figure this out. At first it seemed that the variable would need an interactive property, but I couldn't figure out how to even set that, and embark manages without it anyway. I feel like I'm missing some key bit of how this process works that I'd really like to understand. Can anyone point me in the right direction here?

usually with a math book, after a set of definitions, there is a pay-off. == the definitions are USED to present a useful or interesting (or surprising) result.

 Noob question, but because I can't find the exact question to this.
 Is it possible to make a pattern matching of a opaque type? If not, what type of data (case class, trait, etc.) can be used?
 Thanks in advance, and sorry if it's really a simple question.

How different are Emacs keybindings on MacOS? Do keybindings remain same across OSs? I am assuming Option acts like Alt and Command would act like Super.
 How is your experience using Emacs on Mac? Anything I should be aware of?
 Does anybody has experience using IntelliJ Idea with Emacs Keymap on MacOS?

 My other option is to set a static list of files and assign it to the org-agenda-files variable, but I like to update this list frequently. For example, I like adding tasks to org-journal files, which are generated daily. 
 Finally, I really like the ergonomics of adding a file to the org-agenda-files list using the C-[ command.…]]></summary>

I have opted for paper method. With the "reference box" and the "main box" boxes as in the youtube video titled "Zettelkasten Note-Taking Method: Simply Explained" by  Shu Omi.
Does the adress extend "globally" over both boxes?
Has anyone thought about a github zettelkasten (ie a collabarative one) for a specific context? or maybe no context? Seems to me that that is what science is but with their specific methodology etc journals specialised language?

 If so, what are good resources for learning ML in Haskell?

 Suppose I keep track of expenses in an org tree where lines describing expenses have a special tag (let's say :expense:) and contain an amount ex. 20.56€. 
 Is there a way to automatically compute the sum of expanses in the sub-tree and include the result in an entry ? Like the [%] cookie used in hierarchical TODOs.

 For example, to use enlage-window-horizontally multiple times I would need to press C-x } multiple times but with repeat-mode enabled I need to press C-x once and hold onto } to get the same behavior.
 But this doesn't work for keys like C-c C-f in the inbuilt mhtml-mode.
 How can I configure this behavior for other keybindings?

 ```haskell cons :: (Ord a) => a -> [a] -> [a] cons x xs = x : xs
 cons 1 (cons 'a' []) ```
 I can have a list of Int and a list of Char. Since both Int and Char have instances of Ord, I wondered if I could have a list of Ord, or any other class type, a bit like in C#/Java one could have a List<IComparable> holding different types, as long as they implements the specified interface.

 so I&#39;m working on personal project and I need to encrypt/decrypt large chunks of data using AES256 with constant memory use.

 There is one caveat, it doesn&#39;t propagate the value from function to function. So a nested function will lose the value. For C-u, this is done via the &#39;arg&#39; variable of (interactive &quot;P&quot;). You must do this manually. The first function to be called with the global prefix will not need any special treatment. It should just work, as there is no propagation.

 EAF and Vue.js
 JavaScript, whether you like it or not, is one of the easiest and appealing ways to write programs with a modern UI.
 EAF Music Player, the latest addition to the Emacs Application Framework, utilizes the ecosystem and the accessibility of Vue.js, a modern JS framework known for its simplicity, and produces a GUI program that&#39;ll take much more effort to match up with using plain ELisp.
 I hope this is great news to the web devs out there, as you can now easily extend Emacs with…]]></summary>

 “Types help you reason about effects”, we declare. And they do! Except when they don’t. “Just follow the types!” we insist. But sometimes the types take you down a garden path.
 When the type checker is happy but the behaviour is all wrong, it can be hard to find where you took the wrong turn. In this post I’ll share real-world examples of this phenomenon, and offer some tips on how to avoid it.

 I cannot get syncing to work with both a local directory and dropbox.
 Syncing works with both a local directory only and dropbox only, however when I configure both a local and a dropbox repository it never seems to access dropbox at all.
 My understandig was that when you configure multiple repositories, syncing should be done with all of them - is that a misunderstanding?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi!
I've been adding some notes that when I'm writing them, I have some "aha" moments or I know how they are related to to other notes, and then I remember that another note was related to this one, and so on. What I do is type [[]] and write in the omnibus the text of the note I'm searching, to copy the ID and paste it inside. It's a little time consuming and I was wondering if there is an easier way where the [[-type something-]] automatically prompts some suggestion after I type something inside.
Thanks!]]></summary>

 What I mean is e.g. in org-reveal you can specify the title-page like this:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 emacs noob here.
 When I create an url-link in orgmode it normally opens in my web-browser which most of the time is what I want.
 But sometimes it would be more convenient to open the link in a eww instead so what I would like to have is a new command that would split the windows and open a link in a new eww buffer.
 Could someone give me a hint on how to do that? 
 Many thanks!
