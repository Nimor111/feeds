 I have an issue with FFI and I would like to ask you for indications.
 Let's say I have a function in C++ with this signature: c++ int f(char* s); 
 And I import it to Haskell. If I understood it's like this: hs foreign import ccall "f" _f :: CString -> CInt 
 I need to allocate the CString and it necessarily involve side effects, therefore IO. But I would like to verify if in order to remove the IO I have to use unsafe things.
 The end result should be a wrapper function like this: hs f :: String -> String 
 Thank you very much !

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a specific example for a concept I want to capture within my Zettelkasten, but I'm having a hard time identifying how to go about it.
SITUATION
I'm reading my book on product management when I encounter this infographic which essentially summarizes the entire book in one image.
I'm ECSTATIC!  This contains each of the individual pieces of the system (atomic ideas).  But then my enthusiasm dies down as I realize this image is essentially MULTIPLE ideas in one graphic, triggering analysis paralysis as I consider how to capture this within my Obsidian-based Zettelkasten.
MY QUESTION FOR YOU
Before you read on, pretend you ran into this information.  Your goal is to use your Zettelkasten to help you write strategy documents for your company AND to write articles for product managers in startups to help them launch better products.
How would YOU capture the gold within this infographic within your Zettelkasten?
OPTIONS I'M CONSIDERING
Now that you've considered your own solutions, here's a few I thought of.
Create one Obsidian Canvas, capturing the entire infographic (a Card for each part of the flowchart and each checklist).  Then begin creating Zettels or linking existing Zettels for each individual component, replacing each Card with a Note instead as I go.


Technically, this option violates the "Atomic Notes" rule since my first Zettel would be this full infographic - I'd be essentially capturing a contextualized idea, then breaking it down, which may not yield surprise insights as going bottom-up should.

Create an Overview Zettel (simple text file) with each item written out, then use this Overview Zettel to create individual Zettels from there.


Same concept as #1, but in a text file rather than a Canvas.

Keep this infographic in my Lit Note (aka Reference) and create individual zettels as I go.
Does one of these align with what you would do?  If so, which one and why?  If not, how would your approach differ from any of mine?
Thanks in advance!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I need a piece of elisp that would return the project name for the buffer at point. Seems simple, right? The problem is, I can't find a way to do this reliably. Let me explain.
 If I have a dir structure like this:
 . ├── projects ├── proyecto-uno ├── .git ├── readme.org ├── proyecto-dos ├── proyecto-tres 
 And the current buffer is readme.org, getting the project name - 'proyecto-uno' is fairly easy, if you're using projectile, you can do (projectile-project-name), right? Alternatively, you can use: (magit-toplevel), which returns full path, i.e., ~/projects/proyecto-uno/ and then you can just grab the last segment.
 Now, it gets tricky when you're using git-worktrees and the structure of the project is like this:
 . ├── projects ├── proyecto-uno ├── .git ├── readme.org ├── proyecto-dos ├── .bare ├── master ├── development ├── .git ├── readme2.org ├── proyecto-tres 
 The current buffer is readme2.org. How do you get the project name? (projectile-project-name) returns development (and I want 'proyecto-dos'). (magit-toplevel) returns full path to "development" dir not to 'proyecto-dos'. 
 So then you may suggest, why don't you check, if the buffer is inside a worktree? And that I don't know how to. I assumed I could use (magit-inside-worktree-p), but it always returns t, regardless of where it's called from, readme2.org, or from inside 'proyecto-uno' dir. 
 So how do I find the project name reliably?

 I don't really understand how text-encoding works at any level, and I'm not really a coder, so forgive me if my terminology is a little loose.
 My org-mode files have begun to get infested with strange chararacter codes. I might copy-paste something with a diacritic, and it will be fine until I open the file next and it will show up as "\305\202", for example. 
 I have a feeling that my files may be composed of different text-encoding systems. Is there a way to harmonize them? How do I go about figuring out what to do?
 Thanks for any help!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Since 0.4.0 shipped, I updated the accompanying guide I wrote.
 Since I also updated my screen-capture workflow for video recording (for champagne), it's perhaps time to answer some questions about the deepest, darkest corners of building applications with transient.
 On the surface, you can be forgiven for thinking transient is similar to hydra. Without the state juggling and flow control of transient, you cannot make the same level of expressive user interface.
 Some of the topics that get beyond the surface and require thinking about how you would use this software to build applications
  
Flow control
 History & state
 Custom infixes
  
In particular you can also be forgiven for thinking custom infixes are some kind of crazy extensibility without much practical value. This is far from the truth. Attaching complex values to your user input command sentences and quickly modifying any part of these sentences allows you to express a lot of rich commands in a short time. That is the secret to the efficiency of magit, and magit doesn't even use very complex flow control. Infix overriding allows your interface to reflect and follow the state of the application.
 I'm not terribly incentivized to go beyond the showcase, which at worst contains working examples for just about every behavior. It is less complex code than magit and made of examples that demonstrate behavior in isolation. However, if the demand is interesting and severe, I may be spurred into finishing a richer demonstration.

 for some months I am in the process of designing some HTML Component system for Scala(JS) and have some API things I would like to discuss.
 The basic idea is simple
  
A Component should be immutable
 A Component should assemble itself as a function. This should never fail.
 State is stored in Models. During rendering, Models can lookup the current state of models. Or they can subscribe Models, which will lead to a re-rendering by the Engine.
 During assembly, components can also register events.
 A Component can create sub components (in order to compose)
 The component should know as little as possible from the rendering engine, so that I can swap it. The engine should handle the whole rendering and event handling stuff.
 The assumption is "Browsers are really fast at rendering HTM…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So my problem with large line freezing emacs is solved to a reasonable and usable degree. My next problem is: when I print that long string (it's a response from an api which contain a lot of data) it takes around 20 seconds to output all of the string while in the terminal, it works pretty fast (certainly less than a second, I'm using alacritty). Is there any way to print them faster?
 My long line optimzing settings are set globally and they don't have any effect on emacs outputting the large text. It's a python script and I tried to run it in shell, eshell, and python inferior shell in emacs but noticed no difference.
 Also another thing: is there a way to view for example, only the last 10 thousand characters of buffers that are not files? I see that vscode has implemented it and I think it would help with emacs using less ram. THANKS!

 I create a new note with org-roam-node-find RET <note name> RET. My note names are stuff like daily.2022.05.10, with dots used as hierarchical separators. Org replaces all the dots in the name I supplied with underscores (e.g. daily_2022_05_10).
 I suppose I could just accept the difference, but that doesn't seem like the Emacs way, not to mention underscores are easy for me to mistake as dashes, which have another function in my naming system. I'd like for it to just accept the exact name I give it without replacing anything.
 Thanks in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last year, when Akka moved to the BSL, I mentioned that for my use-case (largely, teaching students the ideas behind Concurrency-Oriented Programming and some ideas about streaming) I'd probably end up writing my own little actors framework. 
 Amdram (named after "amateur dramatics") is ticking along, with snapshots now up on Sonatype snapshots. MIT licence.
 Slide deck introducing it to students, which follows on from the one on Concurrency Oriented Programming
 (Also both written quickly)
 Amdram is probably "rough as guts" but small enough to have my students doing a little robocode-like assignment with it. The API probably will change a little, but not until after the assignment due date in a couple of weeks.
 Notably, 
  
The return type of message handler of MessageHandler[T] | Unit will probably change to replace Unit with an explicit "keep this behaviour" token, as otherwise it's easy to get an odd behaviour putting it into an if. 
 
Some refactoring on what gets bundled into the actor context and whether Actors should remember their execution contexts (at the moment, it feels like there's some repetition/overlap in the implicit arguments) 
 
iteratees package is still under development, along with other forms of small streaming packages
 
At the moment, the jsui package is empty. The idea there is to build some veautiful/doctacular widgets to visualise the actors working in realtime

 From https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/rvqijq/usepackage_and_packagequickstart_for_faster/ (or https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/11q7ybf/is_packageinitialize_needed_in_the_init_file_in or https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/x63etn/very_long_startup_time_with_no_obvious_cause/in7bld8/ or https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/76242/is-package-initialize-needed-in-the-init-file-in-emacs-28-x-and-higher) I understand that I would not need to call (package-initialize).
 However, the combination
  ;;; in early-init.el (setq package-enable-at-startup nil) ;;; in init.el (package-initialize) 
 starts much faster (0.8 seconds) than setting
 ;;; early-init.el (setq package-enable-at-startup t) ;;; not calling (package-initialize) in init.el 
 (This second setup takes about 1.3 seconds to start).
 Of course, I might have other problems in my init.el file but, shouldn't I expect that I should see a faster startup with the second combination?

 We've completed work on the initial prototype of Attribution-Based Economics that was announced at EmacsConf in December. Please read the launch announcement to learn more about what this release entails.
 The pilot projects (including Symex.el) are accepting financial contributions and will distribute them to sources of value including contributors and antecedent projects in a process that we all have a say in.
 We couldn't have gotten this far without the support and participation of this fantastic community, so thank you! I hope, with your help, that we'll manage to prove that non-adversarial economics is not only possible but much better in just every way, not least of which is bringing us together in creating value rather than pushing us apart as our world does today.
 I can't wait to see what we'll accomplish together!

 also, unrelated, but i think speedbar is pretty good/underrated built-in utility, the only downsides is what i just described and the fact that it can only exist as a frame (yes, i know sr-speedbar.el exists, but it's pretty unstable in my experiance)

 I am almost ready to release version 3.0 of my org-gtd package, but I would like to get some feedback on the documentation before I do the actual release and mark it as stable (I have had some beta testers for the code already, but more wouldn't hurt :D ).
 Ideally, the documentation is read on emacs, but the .org file is also available for consumption.
 The org-mode file is at https://github.com/Trevoke/org-gtd.el/blob/org-gtd-3/doc/org-gtd.org 
 All I need at first blush are your questions about things that don't make sense, or that you think should be explained before approaching a given topic (or even knowledge organization). I have just noticed that github has added an outline option (the right-most icon at the top of the file info), which might allow you to skip quickly through the increasingly large "upgrading" section.
 Do note this assumes some amount of knowledge about Getting Things Done, so that might turn out to be a blocker anyway :) 
 The info file is here : https://github.com/Trevoke/org-gtd.el/blob/org-gtd-3/org-gtd.info And obviously you might want to download it and load it inside emacs with C-u h i. For the info file, in addition to questions about things that make sense and don't, I have questions about how things get displayed through the interface, what links make sense or are surprising, what is helpful, etc.
 If you choose to help, I'll be extremely grateful! You can leave the feedback here in comments, or open it as an issue on Github, as you prefer.

 I installed lsp and some other things from reading guides, its somehow works but i am still far away from using it at comfortable level.
 I dont know how to customize my emacs. I basically use C-f C-b C-e C-a and some other basic commands when i use emacs. I dont know how can i customize my .emacs file according to my needs. 
 For example, I want to have a left side panel for browsing dirs/files when coding, and having a run button since everytime when i want to test my code, I'm switching shell window of emacs and calling my executable. But I can't.
 In conclusion, I want to configure emacs for my coding needs but i dont have sufficient knowledge and i cant understand much from what i read/watch on internet. I cant find good guides etc. 
 Can i get any advice, to make up for my deficiencies?

I expected this to be a quick Google, but I wasn't able to find much until I asked an LLM. I have it working to my satisfaction now, and I don't want the next person who needs this feature to have to look for the answer as long as I was looking, so just posting it here:

 (setq org-refile-targets `((,(directory-files "~/org/ref/" t "\\.org$") :maxlevel . 2) ("~/org/gtd/todo.org" :maxlevel . 1) ("~/org/gtd/projects.org" :maxlevel . 2))) (setq org-refile-use-outline-path 'file) (setq org-outline-path-complete-in-steps nil) (setq org-refile-allow-creating-parent-nodes 'confirm) 
 And it seems to work except for one thing. I'm using helm, and when I hit my refile key sequence I get a *helm-mode-org-refile* window, and I only want it to show refile options/candidates that meet the given maxlevel limit. I assumed this would mean (e.g., with maxlevel 1) that this would only allow refiling into my todo.org file as top-level headlines. I don't want to see existing headlines as autocomplete options for that file, if I type "todo" I only want to see "todo.org". For projects.org (with maxlevel 2) I want to see the top-level headlines, and nothing lower. Is this possible? Is helm messing this up?

 I'm fairly competent with elisp but I'm a mu4e newbie and Fastmail's IMAP behavior is puzzling.
 Using Fastmail's web app, when I "Archive" a message in the Inbox, it appears to move that message to the IMAP folder "Archive."
 But from mu4e, after syncing with mbsync and indexing with mu (i.e., mu4e-update-mail-and-index), the supposedly archived messages still appear in the /Inbox folder in ~/Mail except now they have the IMAP "Trashed" "T" flag.
 Can anybody point me to a reference that can help me solve this mismatch? 
 Have I made an obvious misconfiguration?

 I'd like to do some well-defined modifications on links that point to locations in org-files.
 My goal is to replace the search string in the link with the line number. For example, convert
 [[file:file-path::search-string][description]]
 to
 [[file:file-path::1][description]]
 I am looking for a function that returns the link's target and description as well as the regions where they reside. I can write one, but I'd prefer something that already ships with org.
 Thank you,
 Mirko

 Where would Kotlin be without Android? Probably dead. And what does it have over sbt? As if Gradle were any better. Each time I'm upgrading my JDK, Gradle starts crying about not supporting the latest JDK and wants me to download a whole new wrapper for it. Same goes for Rust. I don't know why you would compare Rust to Scala. Besides, both Rust and Cargo have their own set of problems. 
 Seriously, I feel like there's a bunch of people who intentionally bad-mouth Scala to make their "own" langauges look better.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Howdy all, 
 So for the first time in over 20 years, I've switched to linux fron Mac as my daily driver.
 And of course, immediately tried to set up exwm, as one does...
 exwm seems to work generally fine, except that when I log in with it, it is way scaled down and opens up a frame about an eight the size of my screen. Everything is scaled down, the fonts, the windows, etc. I can fullscreen the frame, but the fonts are still all tiny. 
 Odd thing is that any other program I open up inside an emacs frame is scaled just fine... so it's only emacs text buffers that have this issue.
 Running  emacs 29 pre-release compiled with native comp and x minimal emacs config with a handful of packages, mappings, and a few fns.. nothing fancy latest pop_os dell xps 15 3840 x 2400 resolution no exwm specific config other than exwm-enable (did try the example config)  all the font scaling and randr stuff seems to be set fine.
 Not sure where else to look.. 
 Any pointers much appreciated!! Thanks!!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is not really a haskell question, but is very easily expressed in haskell constructs. Two common ways to sort lists are sortOn :: Ord b => (a -> b) -> [a] -> [a] and sortBy :: (a -> a -> Ordering) -> [a] -> [a]. My question is this: Can sortBy be implemented via sortOn (a la the title, for all cmpFn)? Since I'm assuming the answer is "no", is there a good way to tell, for a given cmpFn if sortBy cmpFn can be implemented as sortOn fn?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm happy to announce some changes to PureScript Domains that I think will make the service much more useful than it has been over the last year-plus.
 First, subdomains have been replaced by subpaths. For example, the documentation for my purescript-tecton library can be found at purescri.pt/tecton. Accordingly, PureScript Domains is now PureScript Domain (although previously-registered subdomains remain active).
 Second, a purescri.pt URL will automatically be activated for any package added to purescri.pt/registry. By default, it will redirect to the corresponding GitHub repository, but you can change this behavior or opt out through a simple pull request.
 If you would like to participate, please visit purescri.pt for details.
 Thanks for reading!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I want to use flyspell with a hunspell backed. I prefer hunspell because it offers multilanguage dictionaries which can be very useful for me. My configuration is:
 ``` (setq +v/LANG "en_GB" +v/DICPATH "/Users/me/Library/Spelling/" +v/MULTIDIC "en_GB,en_US,de_DE")
 (use-package flyspell :straight t :after ispell :init ;; Set the locale for the dictionary (if (string-equal system-type "darwin") (setenv "DICTIONARY" "en_GB"))
 (setenv "LANG" +v/LANG)
 ;; Dictionary path (setenv "DICPATH" +v/DICPATH)
 :config ;; Use hunspell (setq ispell-program-name "hunspell") (setq ispell-really-hunspell t)
 ;; ispell-set-spellchecker-params has to be called ;; before ispell-hunspell-add-multi-dic will work (ispell-set-spellchecker-params)
 ;; Declare a multi-language dictionary and switch to it (ispell-hunspell-add-multi-dic +v/MULTIDIC) (ispell-change-dictionary +v/MULTIDIC t)) ```
 However, this does not work. My dictionary folder is populated like so: ``` ❯ tree ~/Library/Spelling /Users/tc/Library/Spelling ├── dynamic-counts.dat ├── en_GB.aff ├── en_GB.dic ├── en_US.aff ├── en_US.dic ├── fr_FR.aff ├── fr_FR.dic ├── it_IT.aff └── it_IT.dic
 1 directory, 9 files ```
 While hunspell is detected, it fails to detect any dictionary :( I test this like so: ``` ❯ hunspell Hunspell 1.7.2 welcome
 welcome 0
 test
 test 0
 sadness
 sadness 0
 ```
 I am on macos 13.3.1. Any help/trick/ideas ? It's totally driving me up the wall.

I'll start.
I finally released my project that extends The Archive, showing an "Idea Explorer" on demand for every note. This can be thought of as a way to look at "note sequences." Sequences that develop an idea. I'm looking for collaborators to develop this idea further. Idea Explorer - an extension exclusively for The Archive.
This past week I've had the opportunity to practice and work on my technique for onboarding videos into my ZK. Speed and timing are critical—speed in taking notes and timing in reviewing the event. I feel I've gained a little success making a rough, rough draft during the presentation, then immediately after, as part of the process of watching a video, I expand my notes as I would if they were highlights from an article. Having a few minutes of uninterrupted time immediately after the video presentation to fill in my thoughts on my note is critical.
I'm looking to do more of this. I get excited when I onboard live streams or Zoom events more than videos where I can start, stop, and replay the action. They feel more dynamic, and they spark my juices.
Maybe I should try sketch-noting. It just feels like my skills at sketching are so poor that I'd miss stuff with the fast pace of a live presentation. Maybe this would be best reserved for youtube videos.

However, it can also consume more system resources, particularly on large files which updates frequently over tramp. I want a simple solution where a single key-press can update the log file on demand. Moreover, I don't want to accidentally edit it so I want the read-only mode with single key-press update feature. I have the following pipeline:
  
Open the log file and convert to read-only-mode (C-x C-q key-press).
 When read-only-mode is activated then we remap the 'g' key to the revert-buffer. One possible solution is to use `current-local-map` function but the downside is that remapping will be activated in all the files opened with that major-mode.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 pretty much the title question. I asked the same on r/lisp but I realize it's better suited here. I like Edebug because it allows to follow the computation even in a single form, from the inside out. Like, given something like
 (+ 3 (/ 4 n))
 I can see exactly not only what n is, but also what are the intermediate results. The closest thing I found for now is Sly's stickers, but I wondered if there was an actual equivalent. Otherwise, I find CL's debugger a bit difficult to use in step-mode, but that could easily being me not having read the manual thoroughly. So, does a CL-Edebug exist, much like CIDER's for Clojure? And if not, can I use SLIME/Sly to step between forms (from inside out)?
 P.S., IIUC Sly is the improved (better?) version of SLIME. Is it right?
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to use org-capture and doct to insert entries in an org file. The content it needs to insert is not always the same, but the position in the file is. I've written my function to go to the correct position and tried with %c to capture and insert the latest value in the kill ring that I populated with the hook function that prompts me for a contact and formats it correctly.
  (let ((org-capture-templates (doct `("new item" :keys "i" :type entry :template "* %c" :function my/goto-current-project-contacts :hook ,(kill-new (completing-read "Select contact: " (org-ql-select my/contacts-file '(level 1) :action #'my/contact-format))) :immediate-finish t)))) (org-capture nil "i")) 
 However this gives me an error:
 doct--convert-declaration-maybe: DOCT Wrong type argument: (functionp doct--variable-p null), (:hook "selected contact"), ("new item" :keys "i" :type entry :template "* %c" :function my/current-project-contacts :hook "selected contact" :immediate-finish t)
 EDIT: I just discovered you can use progn in the template string. Should this not be added to the wiki or am I blind and looked over it for a couple of times? https://orgmode.org/manual/Template-expansion.html
 So this works:
 ``` (defun testtest () (completing-read "Select contact: " (org-ql-select my/contacts-file '(level 1) :action #'my/contact-format)))
 (let ((org-capture-templates (doct ("new item" :keys "i" :type entry :template "* %(progn (testtest))" :function my/goto-current-project-contacts :immediate-finish t)))) (org-capture nil "i")) ``
 Can I move the testtest function into the template so I don't need to declare it separately? I can't seem to figure out the quotes of the "Select contact: " string.

 I was looking for as such, because I donnot have android development environment.
 If there is Emacs user on android like me, it will little help such problem.
 To use this, it requires only a few,
  
Mirror/Fork Emacs repositry from repositry on savannah or gitlab , or emacs-mirror repositry on github self(my case, https://github.com/ayatakesi/copy-of-emacs-mirror/).
 
Create Github Actions' workflow(simply add [https://github.com/ayatakesi/copy-of-emacs-mirror/blob/feature/android/.github/workflows/build.yml](.github/workflows/build.yml) to the repository, and enable workflow from Github web UI).
 
Change the permission of the workflow from 'Read repository contents permission' to 'Read and write permissions'(also from Github web UI).
 
 If you check ./configure step, you will notice this workflow could work very limited target(me), but adjust ./configure option if architecture it may work your architecture of android device.
 ※ I donnot have any android development experience since, I often run another workflow[https://github.com/ayatakesi/copy-of-emacs-mirror/blob/feature/android/.github/workflows/build.yml](learn_android.yml) to adjust configure cited in [https://github.com/ayatakesi/copy-of-emacs-mirror/blob/feature/android/java/INSTALL](java/INSTALL).
 I hope this will help.

This makes it much harder to search through the notes since I've to decrypt them each. So I was thinking if giving up the mix for having all the notes to be encrypted in one directory would fix that, like having all the notes encrypted by default but all of them also decrypt at once, so they become easier to search & query. But I don't know even how to do that, the best came to my mind is to encrypt the directory itself, but I also have no idea of how this can be done :P 
 Any suggestions? 
 p.s. I use disk encryption already if that matters, but I want extra protection.

 I have stack and cabal installed and hls in vscode. I just want to make a simple program, where do I start? Should I use cabal or stack, or none?

 This got me thinking, I should open two files side by side, a <video\_title>_audio and _visual file. I could kind of do this in Obsidian, though with the current way kanban works, it would not be an ideal setup. I'd have to link the audio or visual (or both) file to the entry from kanban.

 Currently, my Neomutt is set up with the following in mind:
  
POP3. I download it to maildirs with mpop for several accounts
 msmtp is configured for the same accounts
 Abook is used for address book
  
Which client, methods, etc. would you recommend so that I can continue using the already set up mpop with maildirs and msmtp, with multiple accounts?
 Abook is not necessary, as I bet there are ways to keep contact information in Emacs?
 Thanks in advance.

 property $ \xs -> concat' (anyPartition xs) === xs 
 Of course anyPartition can't be a pure function. As a first step I tried to create a function
 partitionOf :: [a] -> Gen [[a]] partitionOf [] = return [] partitionOf xs = do i <- choose (2, 8) let (c, cs) = splitAt i xs (c:) <$> partitionOf cs 
 but I don't know how to write a property test with a function like that. Do I need an Arbitrary ([a] -> Gen [[a]]) instance for it? How does this instance from Test.QuickCheck help?
  (CoArbitrary a, Arbitrary b) => Arbitrary (a -> b) 
 What's the best way to accomplish this partition handling test? Most of these things like Gen, Arbitrary and CoArbitrary are pretty new to me.

 Often there isn't any correct way to program something. But there always are exponential amount of horrible ways to program something. And many of those bad solutions get the job done in finite time and with finite resources.
 [disclaimer: while likely irrelevant in this case, I do use doom emacs] 
 After my last question I spend some time learning more about programming generally, as well as lisp syntax. So now I feel I have bit better understanding of emacs-lisp thanks to that. I act…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dear r/emacs community,
 We are researchers at Inria (EP Loki) studying how users automate frequent actions in their daily use of interactive software (e.g., macros in Emacs, actions in Blender, or actions in the Adobe Suite). We recently created a questionnaire that takes 30 to 45 minutes to complete and are looking for participants (we tried to shorten it as much as we could). We unfortunately cannot offer compensation for that, but are hoping data from volunteers will help us design more customizable systems on the long term. Any help would be deeply appreciated.
 Questionnaire : https://expe.lille.inria.fr/limesurvey/index.php/526753?lang=en&community=emacs
 If this research is of any interest to you, we are also looking for participants to interview about their specific solutions to automate frequent actions. Please contact use if you are willing to share your experience, our emails are available in the first page of the questionnaire or you can simply DM me.
 Note: be aware our questionnaire relies on LimeSurvey which uses non-libre JS libraries.

 Edit: a person on 4chan directed me to the MapReduce programming model. Apparently, it was not the exact origin because they got the idea from Lisp:
 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MapReduce#cite_note-map-5
 Lisp developed map as part of their goal to create list programs (unbounded arguments functions). They implemented, as part of that, recursion and functionals (functions that take functions as arguments). map was part of that:
 http://jmc.stanford.edu/articles/lisp.html 
 And reduce and filter are called catamorphism now. So that would be the track to figure out the origin and to generalize the concept.

 Normally abbrevs are either global or major-mode specific. This adds a certain friction - you would need to think about the abbrev naming (can't freely use short names) and the importance/frequency of the abbrev.
 Instead, lam allows you to quickly define context specific abbrevs on the fly. The best part is that since abbrevs can execute elisp, you can do a lot more than just simple text expansions. 
 Want to hear from you on how you use abbrevs and if this approach can open up new workflows for you.

 What's the best way to only set them on Windows and also quiet the byte compiler? I can't wrap the whole form in eval-when-compile. I could make the whole thing a macro that does nothing on non-Windows, but that seems overly complicated.
 Also a related question if I may: I'd like to replace the above setqs with defvar but in such a way that it always sets my value, not just if the var is undefined. Is there a standard way to do that?

The slick dependency means I have no business case migrating it to scala 3 until slick does, which I'm not holding my breath for.
 I'm looking to split it apart, initially by pulling modules out and making them separate projects. These generally will not have the slick dependency keeping me on scala 2, but will often have cats dependencies.
 Is there a way I can start using scala 3 features in this project? I can publish for scala 3, and use the for213use3 functionality in my depending project, but then I will have binary incompatibilies between cats for scala 2 and cats for scala 3.
 Crossbuilding the dependency doesn't get me anywhere, because then I still can't use scala 3 features.
 What's my road ahead here, if any?

Also, the toolbar could be placed on the bottom of the screen and include some commands like "context-menu-open" or "M-x".

Do note that when I talk about scrolling in this context, I mean with the mouse wheel (which I've configured to smoothly scroll, as you would on a web browser for instance).
 For example, doc-view mode. If you try to scroll with pixel scroll precision enabled, you'll get sent to the top of the buffer, and going up or down just says "beggining of buffer" or "end of buffer". Vertico is also broken, resulting in the same error. The corfu popup is broken as well.
 Anyone knows why it's broken? Any fix or workaround? This is my config for this mode btw:
 (setq-default scroll-conservatively 10000) (setq-default scroll-margin 5) (setq pixel-scroll-precision-use-momentum t) (setq pixel-scroll-precision-interpolate-mice t) (setq pixel-scroll-precision-large-scroll-height 10.0) (setq pixel-scroll-precision-interpolate-page t) (pixel-scroll-precision-mode t) (global-set-key (kbd "C-v") 'pixel-scroll-interpolate-down) (global-set-key (kbd "M-v") 'pixel-scroll-interpolate-up)

My journey with Linux has led me to an insatiable desire for optimization, beginning with vim/neovim and permeating nearly every aspect of my digital life. I have hand-crafted scripts for everything. The only thing left is to unify my coding and writing experience in one place.
 I use vim for coding, and I'm very happy with it. However, when it comes to writing, the visual representation of equations and figures help me concentrate on content. While vimtex (a vim plugin) offers a solution for creating LaTeX-based PDFs, the fusion of code and text hinders my thought process. For me, writing on a computer has to be similar to putting pen on a paper, where the focus is on content, not on the representation. For this reason, I sought an alternative solution and my search led me to TeXmacs. Here's how my notes look. No ugly LaTex -- equations/figures look nice, etc.
 TeXmacs is nice and all, except that it's not vim. I can't use all of my fancy plugins (jump between files, write custom snippets, define custom actions, etc). It seems that emacs can be made just as powerful as vim, while also having the ability to display inline equations and images. This seems like the answer to all my questions, except that I only looking at the positives. I hesitate to succumb to the illusion of greener pastures, as vim has served me impeccably, save for the aforementioned limitations. Thus, I must ask: is Emacs the solution I seek?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What's a good solution for making interactive web animations using Haskell? I want to be able to animate reduction graphs and include math symbols.
 The interactivity could be as simple as slowing/speeding the animation, and allowing for automatic "stop points", like a slide show. Or it could go as far as to allow the content to be dynamically generated by user input. And perhaps people could click on graph nodes and see them expand.
 Reanimate sounds almost ideal, with its support for LaTeX. But unfortunately, it is all rendered in batch, not providing for any interactivity.
 FRP solutions sound very attractive. But reflex seems to be stuck on the outdated GHCJS, and I haven't been able to get it to build (using macOS on Apple Silicon). The newer JS output in GHC doesn't yet have DOM support. And even if I used one of those, figuring out how to interact with a LaTeX renderer might be tricky.
 The diagrams library supports some animation, but it's limited, and the never-seems-to-be-arriving version 2.0 is supposed to replace the animation support with something new.
 Another closely related option is Purescript, which seems to have a few FRP libraries, but I'm not sure how well any of them will work for this application.
 Another option would be to use or interface with a JavaScript library that does interactive animations, such as paper.js or Greensock.
 I figure that depending on the animation, pre-rendering some content may be desirable for performance, and that could be tricky.
 I'm leaning toward using Reanimate because, even though I have to give up on interactivity, it seems to have excellent support for LaTeX integration. So it's probably easiest for prototyping, and I could switch to some other toolset later once I know what I want it to look like.

 Sorry for cross-posting. I asked this on r/orgmode. However, I have not received any answer or suggestions there. I see that this reddit is far more active, and there are likely to be many expert users of orgmode here. So hopefully someone can suggest a solution. Thank you.
 New to org mode (used it briefly about 8-10 years ago). It is great. However, I would find it more helpful if I could do the following. Please see the example below with checkboxes.
 * Question - [X] Box 1 Some notes on Box 1 about what to do, and follow up notes when it is done. - [X] Another Box: box 2 Some notes on box 2 about what to do, and follow up notes when it is done. 
 When I check the boxes next to Box 1 and "Another Box: box 2" the lines "Box 1" and "Another Box: box 2" are grayed out (originally they are white when the boxes are not checked). This is great and I like that. However, the "Some notes...when it is done" are not grayed out even after the boxes are checked. They stay white. Is there an easy way to ensure that any notes below a checkbox are also grayed out when the checkbox is checked? Do I have to, or can I, mark it as notes or something else which would give this effect? Thank you.

 In my team we do use zio quite a bit in our codebase, usually with for-comprehensions. I just discovered the zio-direct project and it looks promising. The direct coding style can be a lot simpler to work with and more familiar to folks who are new to FP. I was wondering what has been people's experience with moving to zio-direct. What worked well and what didn't? Any gotchas one needs to be aware of? What are some reasons moving to zio-direct might be a bad idea?

That got me wondering what type system does Haskell use?

 How could I disable all minor modes in a buffer? I have tried this function, but it does not seem to work:
  (defun disable-all-minor-modes () "Disable all minor modes in the current buffer." (interactive) (let ((mode-maps (buffer-local-value 'minor-mode-map-alist (current-buffer)))) (dolist (mode mode-maps) (message "mode [%s]" (car mode)) (funcall (car mode) -1)) ) ))

 p.s. I tried to write my own capture function, but it ended being wayyyy slower.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone,
 So I'm trying to model collectible coins using Haskell, and I've hit a bit of a roadblock with figuring out the best approach.
 Basically, each coin has a denomination, year, and mint. However, not all combinations of these three are valid. For example, a coin with denomination GR1 from the year 1923 could only have come from the Warsaw mint. On the other hand, the same denomination in a different year might belong to the Paris mint.
 My initial thought was to enforce these constraints using a smart constructor, but since this is a pet project aimed at learning, I would prefer to check it at compile time if possible.
 Here's the model I've come up with so far:
 data Denomination = ZL10 | ZL5 | ZL2 | ZL1 | GR50 | GR20 | GR10 | GR5 | GR2 | GR1 deriving (Eq, Ord, Bounded, Enum) data Mint = Warsaw | Paris | Birmingham deriving (Eq, Show, Bounded, Enum) type family OneOf xs where OneOf '[] = Not IdPred OneOf (x : xs) = Or (EqualTo x) (OneOf xs) type Years a = Refined (OneOf a) Year newtype Year = Year {getYear :: Int} deriving (Eq, Ord, Num, TextShow, Show, Lift) type GR1EmissionYears = Years '[1923, 1925, 1927, 1928, 1930, 1931, 1932, 1933, 1934, 1935, 1936, 1937, 1938, 1939] type GR2EmissionYears = Years '[1931, 1932, 1933, 1934, 1935, 1937, 1938, 1939] type GR5EmissionYears = Years '[1923, 1925, 1927, 1928, 1930, 1931, 1932, 1933, 1934, 1935, 1936, 1937, 1938, 1939] -- [...] 
 I could of course glue it all into a single union type, listing all the cases explicitly:
 data Coins = Gr1Warsaw1937 | Gr1Paris1937 | Gr1Paris1939 - ... 
 But that will make it quite hard to e.g. filter and extract all coins of year 1937.
 I'm wondering if anyone has any thoughts on how to approach this problem. Do I need dependent types for this? Is there any simpler way?

a) Thought is a mental event or experience that is subjectively reported by an individual. 
From both, I find myself having these "thoughts" that go beyond the scope of a sparky "fleeting note". 
Should we take them as a resource until we identify some "zettels" among them?]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi! I'm working in Emacs 28.2 (on openSUSE Tumbleweed). On this version only (not in previous versions), the header font for Org mode third level headers is extremely tiny, and only for those headers. That is, for characters preceded by '***', the font is very compressed and completely unreadable, although still red in color, as they should be.
 ​
 It's definitely an annoyance, any suggestions?

 A library to easily define git repo specific hydras. You can define a hydra for a git repo my-project like this:
 (repo-hydra-define "my-project" ("i" text-scale-increase "In") ("o" text-scale-decrease "Out")) 
 And call it from within the repo with M-x repo-hydra-show RET. So only one command for all repo specific hydras.

 I think both of them use abbrev based expansions but are not controlled by the functions and variables that control abbrev expansion.

 Now they added the eglot-upgrade-eglot command, which is supposed to update to the latest ELPA version.
 Looking into emacs-29 code, the version is currently 1.12.29, while list-packages shows version 1.15 (gnu), so installing the package might also bring in a newer one.
 I have no idea how to keep up with the latest version (without having to call the package specific eglot-upgrade-eglot function), especially when emacs 29 will be released and I won’t build from source any more.
 I followed the emacs-devel discussion (https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2023-04/msg00782.html), but now I’m even more confused. Any advice?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I use tags for my org tasks like: @anywhere, @computer, @work, and @home. There's a hierarchical structure here, sort of like this:
 @anywhere @computer @work @home 
 So from my agenda, I'd like to be able to filter for e.g. @work when I'm on my work computer, and have all tasks labeled as @anywhere, @computer, or @work show up. The problem is, org's Tag Hierarchy seems to work in the opposite way that I want; when I create a hierarchy like this:
 (setq org-tag-alist '((:startgrouptag) ("@anywhere") (:grouptags) (:startgrouptag) ("@computer") (:grouptags) ("@work") ("@home") (:endgrouptag) (:endgrouptag)) 
 Then filter by e.g. @work, I only get @work-tagged entries. On the other hand, when I reverse the hierarchy like this:
 (setq org-tag-alist '((:startgrouptag) ("@work") (:grouptags) ("@anywhere") ("@computer") (:endgrouptag) (:startgrouptag) ("@home") (:grouptags) ("@anywhere") ("@computer") (:endgrouptag)) 
 I can filter by @work or @home and get the results I want, however I can't filter by @computer and see all @work/@home/@computer/@anywhere-tagged entries. And, unfortunately, if I add a grouptag section for @computer, it includes children of that group in @work and @home now, corrupting those groups.
 So my question is: is there a better way to filter to include a child in a hierarchy OR its parents? FWIW I've also tried using the | operator in my filter query (e.g. @work|@anywhere) but org doesn't seem to parse it, and it does no filtering (it gives me a message like @work|@anywhere filter ignored because tag/category is not represented).

 (btw, I'm using doom emacs, in case that happens to be relevant here)

 New to org mode (used it briefly about 8-10 years ago). It is great. However, I would find it more helpful if I could do the following. Please see the example below with checkboxes.
 * Question - [X] Box 1 Some notes on Box 1 about what to do, and follow up notes when it is done. - [X] Another Box: box 2 Some notes on box 2 about what to do, and follow up notes when it is done. 
 When I check the boxes next to Box 1 and "Another Box: box 2" the lines "Box 1" and "Another Box: box 2" are grayed out (originally they are white when the boxes are not checked). This is great. However, the "Some notes...when it is done" are not grayed out even after the boxes are checked. They stay white. Is there an easy way to ensure that any notes below a checkbox are also grayed out when the checkbox is checked? Thank you.

 I also know that maybe i do not really need them if i can't see their value, but I'm keen to know their strengths.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I use Emacs (evil-mode) for extensive note-taking but don't have much programming experience. Can someone help me with a function to copy visually selected text in org-mode to clipboard and exclude the org emphasis markers, e.g. selecting raw text +string+ copies to clipboard just string? org-copy-visible by itself doesn't copy to system clipboard. Also, I don't want to think about whether to use org-copy-visible or evil-yank--99% of the time I just want to evil-yank and also don't want the emphasis markers copied to clipboard (e.g. copy paste to document or terminal).
 Basically:
  
Should rely on org-copy-visible which probably does a better job than trying to parse selected text using regex
 
Custom function or overloading evil-yank only for org-mode where org-copy-visible is relevant. I prefer to just use plain evil-yank in non-org-mode buffers instead of e.g. my\evil-yank that falls back to evil-yank since this is less efficient in scenarios where I'm working with non-org-mode buffers.
 
 Much appreciated.

 Suppose I have already an emacsclient instance with another buffer opened, for example "sample.org". How can I ensure that if I run a function, such as emacsclient -e "(flyspell-buffer)", the function is executed with the buffer being set correctly to "sample.org"?
 I am asking because I have noticed that emascsclient -e "(buffer-name)" returns *server* buffer all the time and it has weird behavior with functions that expect the buffer set correctly.
 Is there a way to do this from Emacs, without relying on the window manager?
 EDIT: There is no easy solution for this. I will just stick to Alt-x.

 I tried with macros but it gets too complex, so I guess I need to write a function to do just that. I'm not elisp fluent at all and I'm hoping the elisp wizards can give me a hand.

 I know there is a new feature in Emacs (I think since 29) that you could enable to make Emacs act more like other modern Desktop programs, where you could scroll with the mouse wheel and the view would change, but the position of the point remains where it is. When the point is then moved to (via arrow key for example) the view would jump back to the point. 
 I know I read this somewhere, but I just can not find it. Someone know what I mean?

 Big release from HuggingFace this week. They released a large, language model for code (https://huggingface.co/bigcode/starcoder). It has 15.5B parameters, 8192 context window, it was trained on permissively licensed code. Looks like it's the best open alternative for copilot.
 There is also a VSCode extension https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=HuggingFace.huggingface-vscode 
 Nothing for Emacs, but I think adding it would not be that hard (the above extension itself is a fork of a TabNine extension). 
 Semi-related interesting post https://thakkarparth007.github.io/copilot-explorer/posts/copilot-internals.html#reverse-engineering-preview on reverse engineering the copilot extension (how it prompts the LLM to add context about your project). Might be useful to add to the Emacs extension.

 So why do subsequent lines in multi-line strings get a 1-char indent:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm finding myself defining "ToJSON"/"FromJSON" instances sometimes, as I don't want to rely on the Generics based "deriving anyclass" serialiser to do this for me as it means:
  
I need to hack my datatype to fit the names and format I want for the JSON serialisation, not what makes most sense from an internal logic in workability sense.
 My design is then brittle to refactorings, even simple variable name chages.
  
I'm also using Servant+Swagger, and would like to keep the Swagger docs up to date, although defining the "ToSchema" swagger classes is even more complex.
 What just occurred to me is basically what I'm doing in each case is specifying how my data type maps to a Key/Value map, where Values can either be numbers, strings, arrays or key value maps themselves. Most serialisation formats are something like that.
 Think of it as a "serialisation/deserialisation" description AST.
 Indeed I would think if I had such a structure, I would think I'd be able to define "ToJSON", "FromJSON" and "ToSwagger" instances from it, and perhaps others in the future. If I get them right once, then I can provide APIs/docs in different formats and know they'll be in sync for all serialisation/deserialisation formats.
 Has this idea been attempted in a library? I don't want to reinvent the wheel? Or is there no wheel and do people think it's a wheel worth inventing (and why/why not?)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone,
 I'm trying to use the refinement library to restrict a year input to a specific set of values. For example, I want to only accept years like 1923, 1924, 1926, or 1930.
 Currently, I can achieve this using the Refined type as follows:
 type SomeYear = Refined (Or (Or (EqualTo 1923) (EqualTo 1924)) (Or (EqualTo 1926) (EqualTo 1930))) Int 
 However, as you can see, this approach can get tedious and verbose when working with a larger set of allowed years. I was hoping to define a helper type that would allow me to specify a type-level list of allowed years, like so:
 type SomeYear = OneOf '[1923, 1933, 1926, 1930, ...] 
 But I'm stuck on how to implement the OneOf type. Can anyone offer guidance on how to do this?

 https://www.youtube.com/live/d18Fdu6ayM8?feature=share
 In this episode, we will discuss the QuantifiedConstraints language extension.
 For this episode we will assume familiarity with type classes. An understanding of type families will be helpful for a part of the episode, but is not a requirement.
 The Haskell Unfolder is a YouTube series about all things Haskell hosted by Edsko de Vries and Andres Löh, with episodes appearing approximately every two weeks. The playlist containing the first episode is here:
 https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLD8gywOEY4HaG5VSrKVnHxCptlJv2GAn7
 We also have a GitHub repository with the code samples from the episodes:
 https://github.com/well-typed/unfolder
 And we have a public Google calendar listing the planned schedule:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a command that invokes
 (call-process "gnome-terminal" nil 0) 
 and the recent update to Gnome 44 broke it. But not always:
  
If I launch emacs from a terminal (Gnome Terminal) and use my command or evaluate the form above, it works all right.
 If I do nohup emacs > /dev/null 2>&1 & so I can close the terminal from which I started Emacs, the command works until I close that terminal. After I close it, the command or the form do nothing.
 The normal way to use it for me is from an Emacs session started by a desktop file (I believe, because all this stuff is GUIed away. And also the real normal way for me would be to open a frame connected to a server session, but that's now utterly broken and matter for another post). When evaluated in such an instance, the terminal that opens is not very collaborative and says
  
 bash: Error in ~/.profile.mine: directory ~/src/scripts/by_others not found.: No such file or directory bash: /usr/share/Modules/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/local/texlive/2022/bin/x86_64-linux:[more paths…]: No such file or directory bash: readlink: command not found... Packages providing this file are: 'coreutils' 'coreutils-single' bash: basename: command not found... Packages providing this file are: 'coreutils' 'coreutils-single' Install package 'ncurses' to provide command 'tput'? [N/y] 
 Using my ignorance I guessed that the terminal that Emacs launches is somehow tied to the terminal that launched Emacs and that I don't know how to fix it.
 I know that I should report this to Gnome developers but you know that would be a waste of time.
 I'm on Emacs 30.0.50 (pure GTK build, in case it matters) and it was the same in v. 28.2.

 [Gentoo Linux Host] –ssh–> [WSL2 Ubuntu 22.04.2 LTS (Windows VM)] –open–> [emacs] –edit–> /mnt/c/<Path>/<Files>
 There is a significant performance increase to using the windows git.exe instead of the one on Ubuntu in wsl as I am working primarily in /mnt/c/<Path>/<Files>
 I setup magit-git-executable to use windows git.exe as follows:
 elisp (when (string-match "-[Mm]icrosoft" operating-system-release) (setq magit-git-executable "/mnt/c/Program Files/Git/cmd/git.exe")) 
 It works great; however, the only thing I cannot seem to get working is magit-commit
 I did manage to get it working without emacs however.
 I created a script in wsl to convert the git.exe path argument to a wsl path

The benefits of your Zettelkasten highly depend on the longevity of each note. Since the Zettelkasten as life-long companion and comrade in the battle for and against knowledge is a long-term endeavor, it is crucial that you create notes and structures that will last a long time. The minimum goal should be that they last a lifetime, so they are optimally designed for yourself. Ideally, they last forever, so future generations can benefit from your work as well.

 I could capture everything into a single inbox, then sort everything at the end of the day. It could be feasible.
 What I'd like to know is what's a good way to categorize stuff:
  
1 category = 1 file (everything about cooking is in cooking.org)
 
1 category = 1 directory (everything about cooking is in the same directory. 1 bookmark = 1 file)
 
1 category = 1 tag (bookmarks are in different files - for example journals - and i can retrieve them with org-ql)
 
 I know it's subjective, but I'd like to know your experiences in this regard.

I think it would honestly be a great quality of life to be able to export an org markdown file directly from a tool like this, insert it into org mode and already have a lot of the boilerplate work done in structuring relatively common tasks/projects (I don't imagine this tool would work well for more obscure tasks).
 https://goblin.tools/
 I sent some feedback to the dev of this to ask for org markdown export functionality but if they don't do it someone else will eventually, the application of "AI" is just too sensible. When my ADHD is bad, just breaking down tasks into subtasks is exhausting, if an AI can do the stupid simple work (that isn't demanding, complex mental work) of just getting most of my tasks written down than it is so much easier to start.

I would like to have multiple persistent sessions, each with its own eyebrowse workspaces and ideally its own set of persistent open buffers. Each session would be its own project with persistent window layouts.
 Is there a package that supports this? Not sure if desktop.el is conducive to multiple sessions. For a single session, last I checked, having more than one instance of Emacs when using desktop.el may cause some undesirable behavior when it comes to closing instances and saving them, at least with typical settings.
  
EDIT: C-x t 2 does not preserve eyebrowse workspaces, e.g. If there's 3 workspaces in one Emacs tab, closing one of the eyebrowse workspaces also closes it on the rest of the tabs.

 Thank you all, really. I've spent about 6 days to understand that
 I've just missed thing that outer fmap now takes function fmap (const 'h')
 LOL
 /thread
 Hi, I don't understand how fmap . fmap evaluates, please help. I've spent already 6 days and I don't get it still
 for example:(fmap . fmap) (const 'h') [Just "huy",Nothing,Just "huyhuy"]
 I've understood how we get the final type
 Here it is:
 (.) :: ((g x -> g y) -> (f (g x) -> f (g y))) -> ((x -> y) -> (g x -> g y)) -> (x -> y) -> (f (g x) -> f (g y)) fmap . fmap :: (x -> y) -> f (g x) -> f (g y) (fmap . fmap) (const 'h') :: (b -> Char) -> f (g b) -> f (g Char) (fmap . fmap) (const 'h') [Just "huy",Nothing,Just "huyhuy"] -- -- :: List (Maybe String) -> List (Maybe Char) 
 Here is a full signature
 (fmap . fmap) (const 'h') [Just "huy",Nothing,Just "huyhuy"] -- :: ((Maybe String -> Maybe Char) -> (List (Maybe String) -> List (Maybe Char))) -> ((String -> Char) -> (Maybe String -> Maybe Char)) -> (String -> Char) -> (List (Maybe String) -> List (Maybe Char)) 
 But not I'm trying to understand how it evaluates
 As I understood, composition will apply first and we get this:
 (.) fmap fmap = \x -> fmap (fmap x) 
 Then we apply const 'h' like this
 fmap (fmap const 'h') fmap (fmap (const ‘h’)) [UPDATED] 
 And then we wait for our list, so inner fmap will evaluate first, right? Like this:
 fmap f lms case lms of [] -> [] (x:xs) -> const 'h' Just "huy" : map f xs -- 'p' (x:xs) -> const 'p' Nothing : map f xs -- 'p' (x:xs) -> const 'p' Just "woohoo" : map f xs -- 'p' [] -> [] -- 'p':'p':'p':[] -- "ppp" 
 Am I right? If yes, then how the next fmap will evaluate?
 It doesn't has function applied, just only "ppp"
 That's absurd
 PLEASE, HELP, sorry for english if so

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you have more than one Zettlekasten to manage, you may find org-roam to be a bit clunky when dealing with them. The proposed solution in the manual is to have an elist file that locally modifies the org-roam-directory and org-roam-db-location variables. I didn't really like this approach, so I made something better, a very simple function that between a given list of Zettlekasten:
 (setq zettlekasten-paths-alist '(("Main" . "~/Some/Path/") ("Zettlekasten2" . "~/Other/Path/"))) (defun switch-zettlekasten () (interactive) (let* ((keys (mapcar #'car zettlekasten-paths-alist)) (prompt (format "Select Zettlekasten:")) (key (completing-read prompt keys)) (chosen-zettlekasten-path (cdr (assoc key zettlekasten-paths-alist)))) (setq org-roam-directory chosen-zettlekasten-path) (setq org-roam-db-location (concat chosen-zettlekasten-path "org-roam.db")) (org-roam-db-sync))) 
 I have personally bound this to C-c n s since C-c n is the prefix for org-roam related commands. The s stands for switch. You may use anything else of course. Hope you find it useful.
 EDIT: Oops, I made a mistake when first posting this. Make sure the paths in the alist end with a forward slash, otherwise when concatenating to create the database file path you'll end up with ~/Some/Pathorg-roam.db.

It is specific to evil mode and has lots of scope for improvement. Here it is: https://github.com/sooriravindra/DotFiles/blob/master/emacs/.emacs.rsoori/bindings.org
 In my init.el (in the same repo) I check if bindings.el exists. If it doesn't I execute the source block in bindings.org which reads the org table and generates bindings.el
 Please let me know if you have ideas to improve or critique my rather hacky snippet.

 The custom agenda view works fine, however the org-modern faces for the TODO keywords are not applied in the custom agenda view. Even more strange is that the org-modern faces for priority levels do appear in the custom agenda view. I've tried both hooking org-modern-agenda to org-agenda-finalize-hook and using global-org-modern-mode with no success. I'm just not sure where this issue can be pinned down.

 One of my new year's resolution is to get better at emacs lisp, and it seems to me the best way to go about it is to build stuff that I'd find handy. I make heavy use of Zotero to store pdfs and now to annotate them via their pdf-annotator tool, but I was missing some sort of integration with org-roam that would allow me to automagically import the Zotero pdf annotations on the org-roam note for a specific reference. So I wrote some code to achieve this, see https://www.riccardopinosio.com/blog/posts/zotero_notes_article.html. Perhaps some of you will find the idea useful!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Currently, when you compile distributed-process, you get a bunch of warnings like "The constraint 'Serializable a' matches instance (Binary a, Serializable a). This makes type inference for inner bindings fragile..." In my own code, I have fixed similar warnings by switching from a class "newtype" to a type synonym. In this case, that would mean changing
 class (Binary a, Typeable a) => Serializable a instance (Binary a, Typeable a) => Serializable a 
 to
 type Serializable a = (Binary a, Typeable a) 
 My question is: suppose I made this change in distributed-process. How might it affect users of the library? I have checked that it has no effect on my own code that uses distributed-process. But I don't know enough to say what the impact might be in general.

 I started writing Scala more than 9 years ago and got comfortable with "Is Scala dying?" kind of posts/threads every 3-4 months or so. Most of the time they come from people starting to learn the language or deciding whether they should invest their time into it (tl;dr they probably should), sometimes from someone desperate who decided to move on to Rust another language. It's that time of the year again and this time I decided to chime in.
 My first real-world Scala project was such a bright mix of... things. Scalaz, Akka, Json4s and many small libraries I cannot even remember right now. Java reflection is all over the place, funn…]]></summary>

I like organising my notes linearly (like a blog), using tags to loosely categorize them. I thought it would make a nice project to build a little web-based renderer for my notes; presenting each note file in a chronological index, where the index can be filtered by date and by tags, and each note entry can be maximised or minimised within the index, or opened in a new page.
 I've kept it very simple, using vanilla JS for the frontend and vanilla PHP on the server. I've uploaded the project to github, where you can find all the sources, some example note entries, a docker file for the server and setup / workflow instructions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I understand that the current emacs has the following flow of code transformation for our elisp codes to take effect:
 elisp -> bytecode -> LAP -> native 
 Note that only with gccemacs does the elisp code makes to the final native phase. Otherwise, if I understand correctly, it gets turned into LAP [1] and controls the emacs event loop (in C) directly. In other words, in this case elisp gets compiled into LAP, and LAP gets interpreted directly.
 Q1. The source code of the bytecode interpreter is under /emacs/src/bytecode.c. How about the source code of the interpreter for elisp and LAP?
 Q2. Are there any known semantic differences among interpreted elisp, interpreted bytecode, interpreted LAP, and native code?
 Q3. What's the current development of JIT compiler for elisp->LAP and for LAP->native? If the JIT compilation flow for elisp->native is finished, will bytecode and LAP be abandoned? If so, when will that happen?

It is used behind the scenes to make bytecode more amenable to optimization, since the instructions are in a structure which is easier to operate on.", quoted from [2, section 1].

 My first steps are always to separate code, divide it on pure & impure functions.
 Pure:
  
It always returns the same result if given the same arguments.
 It can’t cause any side effects.
  
I was thinking that It would be great to mark somehow pure functions.
 I have found that it can be mark like this '(declare (pure t) (side-effect-free t)'.
 But I don't see many functions in emacs codebase mark in this way.
 Why it's not so popular?
 Is based on example below this is the correct way to mark functions?
 (defvar bar 10) ;;; before (defun add-one-to-bar () (setq bar (+ bar 1))) (add-one-to-bar) ;;; after (defun add-one (var) (declare (pure t) (side-effect-free t)) (+ var 1)) (setq bar (add-one bar))

 What whould be a good alternative key-binding here still involving the arrow keys?
 I do use evil-mode and org-mode most of the time.

 This milestone is mainly about incorporating the breaking changes from the `dottyquery` branch (originally by Stefan). That is, features that were dropped or changed in order to support Scala 3 have now been cleaned up and merged. (And `nafg/dottyquery` is rebased on `main`.)
 What's left on `nafg/dottyquery` is mainly just actually making the code cross-build for Scala 3. It still needs a lot of cleanup, but that's hopefully about it.
 Please try it out and let me know if you have any issues.
 And if you need anything that was dropped, let me know -- especially if you're willing to contribute a Scala 3 implementation!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I want a custom prelude for my project that's additive; it'll have all the base prelude functions, but also automatically import Text, ByteString etc.
 I've created a Prelude.hs:
 {-# LANGUAGE PackageImports #-} module Prelude ( module P , module T ) where import "base" Prelude as P import Data.Text as T -- import Data.Text qualified as T 
 The end result is that I want to be able to use Data.Text qualified like T.Text or T.take in my code. If I import Data.Text unqualified, then GHC complains of conflicts between T and P; if I import it qualified, nothing gets reexported; I can't use T.fun in my code. Is there any simple solution to this I'm missing?

 Nov mode works fine with the EPUB document, and the major mode is named "EPUB". Org-noter doesn't start up, probably because it's looking for a buffer in `nov-mode`. 
  
Does anyone use these packages together?
 
When did NOV change its major mode from `nov-mode` to `EPUB-mode`?
  
I am one of the maintainers for org-noter, but I only use it with PDFs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Link buttons in EWW for example are implemented as text-property buttons with a 'follow-link' property and a 'help-echo' property that encodes the URL to follow. (button-at (point)) when on such a button, returns a marker as the button object; let's call it 'linkbut'. But (button-activate linkbut) fails due to the lack of an 'action' property. If this is considered a button as determined by button-at, then I would suggest that button-activate be updated to utilizes the follow-link property and activate the link appropriately.
 One simple way to resolve this is to start adding an 'action' property to follow-link buttons.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone, I had some enquiries about b2b scala job offers. What I understand is the developer should own his own company so that the contracts is between the two businesses ie the client and the developer. And in some cases there's a talent recruitment firm in the middle. 
 My question is does the job application process differ from normal employment job offers. 
 Does the job application require you to apply as a business or individual say my company is scalaconsults. 
 What if you are a 3 man outfit. All partners in your business, can you still apply for such job contracts. How does the interview process go now that you are more than one.
 Incase of b2b scala jobs on linkedin where do I show that this is my business, this is my crew, this is what I've done. Coz on linkedin it seems like an individual process not business.
 Once your employed can you subcontract the work.
 Sorry for the many questions. Hope there's a kind soul here who can clarify this whole b2b thing for me.

org-publish: systemscrafters YT, it's show note
 ox-hugo documentation site
  
 My use case of blog: 
  
Planning to writing multiple documentations of small projects I work on
 Tutorials of the projects, Tips & Tricks
  
 My Concerns:
  
I'd prefer minimal, (org-publish seemed bit more minimal, but not 100% sure)
 
I want to use separate org-files (on ox-hugo prefers single file for all site)
 I know nothing about HTML/CSS. (I'll face some problems on theme-ing org-publish)
 I've heard about hugo is fast at parsing when there are many files. Would org-publish lag when there is hundreds of files?
 (not necessarily) I'd like to integrate org-roam's back-linking, if it's possible
  
What are your opinion and experience?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi folks,
 I want to explore the Erlang style concurrency model library in Haskell which is the cloud haskell project. My first step is to use it in a toy project to send ping-pong messages between two processes.
 I add distributed-process as a dependency and in extra-deps in stack.yaml file, but I get dependency errors. After adding the recommended dependencies, I am finally stuck with incompatible versions of base. The one in the stack lts version and the one in the library hashable do not match.
 I see that there's a config setup for lts-19.28 here, but it doesn't seem to work for me when I create a new stack project with 19.28 resolver.
 Is there any other way I can get this to work? I am using GHCup for managing my Haskell installation and these are the versions if it matters.
 GHCup 0.1.19.2
 Stack 2.9.3

 I used to use just the following for my auto-revert-mode config:
 (global-auto-revert-mode 1) 
 but I noticed it wasn’t consistent in catching changes. So I did some research and found some suggested changes here and here that I tried in my config:
 (custom-set-variables '(auto-revert-remote-files t) '(auto-revert-interval 10) '(auto-revert-verbose nil) 
 This seemed to work more consistently, but I still notice inconsistency in files getting auto-reverted. 
 The one change I haven’t tried is setting auto-revert-use-notify to nil, but I was wondering if I’m missing something obvious in my setup. 
 Thanks for any help!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 if I understand correctly, then the lambda calculus consists of just variables, function application and abstraction.
 Given the term "λa. (λ b. a b) a" can you help me to understand what exactly the amounf of subexpressions of this lambda expression are?
 The lack or use of parentheses both still confuse me. I have read that sometimes most parentheses are ommitted and that the abstraction chooses its body greedily, that is, extends itself as far right as possible. My idea is:
  
The expression itself is a (not proper) subexpression
 The first lambda body extends over all the remaining symbols (?) meaning that we have an abstraction of the form λa. M where M a subexpression.
 M itself is an application again (λ b. a b) a
 a is a subexpression of M
 (λ b. a b) is another one
 Lastly, this is λ b. M' for some M' which in this case is a b. Now is a b an application? It has to be since the language doesn't contain something like Var Var, but it does contain the application (X Y) for some terms of the language, right?
  
​
 It's still a little confusing for me, could someone maybe point me to the right solution? I am sure if I understand this example I should be able to understand most of them. Thank you in advance!

Is there a way I can retain the navigation functionality from the old c++-mode while keeping other treesitter functionality like highlighting, indentation etc?
 Note that when I describe key, bindings like C-M-Spc don't seem to be bound to other custom functions upon enabling treesitter, so I am not sure what's changing their behavior.

 I am trying to forget about standard terminal emulators, and to work 100% in emacs.
 how shall I open files when I am working in vterm. In my regular terminal emulator (alacritty), I would edit the files with emacsclient. but how when I am already in vterm in emacs?
 How you people do in that case? Open another emacsclient instance from within vterm?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[TITLE FIX: In elisp, how do I use consult to get the user's selection from a list of items?
 Suppose I have the following list:
 (setq elements '(("apple" "fruit") ("train" "vehicle") ("cherry" "fruit") ("bycicle" "vehicle"))) 
 How do I use consult and all the completion goodies to get one of the entries of the elements list?
 I would like to be able to select based on the name of the entry, which would be the first element of the list. But I would like to get the list as the selection.
 Is it possible?
 Is there a better way to structure the entries of the elements list? Maybe something like this:
 (:type "vehicle" :name "train") 
 Sorry if this should be obvious, I am still learning elisp and I am struggling with it. I tried to read the code of the consult-buffer but I could not figure how is the plist SOURCE structured.
 SOLVED: completing-read function is the answer. There is a very nice guide here: https://howardism.org/Technical/Emacs/alt-completing-read.html

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I use Doom which packages better-jumper and binds better-jumper-jump-backward to C-o. I use this binding extensively in my workflow and it mostly works well, but there are a few scenarios where jumping backwards doesn't seem to work.
 First, when I'm in Org Agenda and press Enter on a todo item (org-agenda-switch-to) to go to the corresponding org file, I'm unable to jump back to the Org Agenda buffer - C-o takes me to a seemingly random location. I tried fixing this with advice:
  (advice-add 'org-agenda-switch-to :before #'better-jumper-set-jump) 
 but the location in Org Agenda still doesn't seem to be in the jump list.
 Second, when in helpful mode (when looking up docs with e.g. helpful-key or helpful-callable) I can't figure out how to go back after following a link in the docs (i.e. after pressing Enter over a link). In helpful mode better-jumper-jump-backward just doesn't seem to do anything and I'm at a loss as to how I'm supposed to navigate.
 I'd really appreciate any help from those more familiar with setting up these libraries than I am.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I just figured out how to encode pattern matching into "De Bruijn Notation as a Nested Datatype":
 {-# LANGUAGE GADTs #-} module NestedPattern where import Control.Monad import Data.Functor.Compose import Data.Traversable import Data.Void data Term x where Var :: x -> Term x App :: Term x -> Term x -> Term x Lam :: Traversable f => Pattern f -> Term (f x) -> Term x data Pattern f where Bind :: Pattern Maybe Pair :: Pattern f -> Pattern g -> Pattern (Compose f g) instance Functor Term where fmap = liftM instance Applicative Term where pure = return (<*>) = ap instance Monad Term where return = Var Var x >>= f = f x App e1 e2 >>= f = App (e1 >>= f) (e2 >>= f) Lam pm e >>= f = Lam pm (e >>= traverse f) instance Foldable Term where foldMap = foldMapDefault instance Traversable Term where traverse f (Var x) = Var <$> f x traverse f (App e1 e2) = App <$> traverse f e1 <*> traverse f e2 traverse f (Lam pm e) = Lam pm <$> (traverse (traverse f) e) left, right :: Term Void left = Lam (Pair Bind Bind) (Var $ Compose $ Just $ Nothing) right = Lam (Pair Bind Bind) (Var $ Compose $ Nothing) 
 For those unaware, De Bruijn Notation as a Nested Datatype shows to use nested data types to encode debrujin indexes in the type system. In the encoding, an abstract syntax tree is parameterized by their free variables. Lambdas in this encoding simply add an extra inhabitant to their child term.
 My extension here uses GADTs (and HKTs) to make this work with patterns as well. A pattern in this encoding is something that describes how to map free variables, so Bind just adds an extra inhabit like what a normal lambda would do and Pair composes the maps of other patterns.

 I'm studying CS and currently attend a course that involves creating a small project using REScala to give a little introduction to functional-reactive programming (in addition to doing all the necessary research and writing a small paper about it).
 My professor added, that everything we intend to demonstrate during our presentation should not be something trivial like a `Hello, world!` programs or similar, so I figured I might ask here if anybody has some small project ideas that are feasible for a Scala and FRP newbie yet ideally impress my professor.
 Thanks in advance for any help! 
 EDIT:
 I might've added that I am not new to functional programming in general and definitely know my way around (have some experience using various languages, mainly Haskell).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi All, 
 Im a Univeristy Student currently studying Computer Science at the University of Southampton, and as apart of my Dissertation / Thesis i have created a proof-of-concept tool that combines ideas from the Functional Language Haskell with the Block-Based visual paradigm.
 Ive spent alot of time and effort on this project, and whilst i havent managed to achieve all my goals, im still proud of its outcome and am here to share it!
 You can find the project at https://blockell.netlify.app/, where you can create small programs using blocks to declare functions and generate haskell code. Unfortionately, there are no tutorials for the tool, and to run the code you have to copy it into a haskell file and run it locally on your machine. :( 
 Anyways, if you like the tool, or have any comments, suggestions or improvements feel free to comment them below or answer this anonymous feedback form here: https://forms.office.com/e/nd6sJ3Gq0U 
 Any and all commments with be tremendous help to my project, but also Im just proud of this language and want others to see it :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi there,
 I've been recently spending a lot of time inside docker containers (or Podman in my case), and because of this, project.el has picked up a project and stored it in the projects file. If Emacs reboots and the container is no longer there, project attempts to open the file in TRAMP, and TRAMP hangs until I press q to allow tramp to exit.
 I can think of two ways to hypothetically fix this:
 The first is by modifying the project-find-functions list. It's a list of functions which are ran in succession until one of them returns a truthy value. My current project-find-functions is (project-try-vc project-try-local). I believe in my case project-try-vc is returning t.
 The second is by telling TRAMP to move on after a failure, allowing the boot to complete even when some projects are not accessible. I'm thinking an advice might be necessary to achieve this.
 Are there any other options? Does anyone out there have a solution to this already?
 Thanks!

 I have based my emacs config on Emacs Prelude from u/bbatsov, because I did not trust starting from vanilla emacs.
 When starting my emacs, I get a warning saying the the package dash-functional is no valid anylonger and must be replaced by the package dash from the same author,
 Is it some thing I can dom or only the author of Prelude?
 So far, I have installed dashm but it does not seem to fix the problem. Thx for your insights,

On a meta-level, it's interesting to me because category theory is a field for which I have 0 (zero!) formal knowledge. I only know some practical applications from programming patterns.

That means I'll be keeping one foot in the realm of the known (programming) and one in the unknown (category theory).
While the realm of the known expands with every article I read, I can make amends to this note. This, in turn, means that malleability of these notes pays off very quickly!

 From within Emacs using vterm I can ssh into remote macOS machines just fine. But if I try to connect to the same machine using TRAMP to open the remote user's home directory in Dired it always fails. Or, more correct, it takes ages to complete, never actually connecting.
 This is true for all remote macOS machines I have tried to connect to using TRAMP. None of them uses any fancy oh-my-zsh, the prompts are standard macOS zsh prompts.
 Is there anything specific with remote macOS that messes up TRAMP?

I use Evil package and the prefix key is SPC when in normal mode. The problem is that this prefix is not available in Firefox and such because SPC gets intercepted.
 So, my question is, how do I add C-SPC as an additional prefix key so that both SPC and C-SPC act as viable ways to activate the which-key minibuffer? I would use SPC in Emacs buffers and C-SPC in xorg clients.
 Side question, related to EXWM: Does anybody know why the media keys do not work in full screen videos played in firefox? If the video is not in fullscreen the media keys work, which is really weird. First time I see something like this.

 I have org setted up with elpaca like this:
 ```elisp (use-package org :config (font-lock-add-keywords 'org-mode '(("^ *\([-]\) " (0 (prog1 () (compose-region (match-beginning 1) (match-end 1) "•")))))) (electric-indent-local-mode -1) (org-babel-do-load-languages 'org-babel-load-languages '((clojure . t) (cpp . t) (elisp . t) (haskell . t) (python . t) (scheme . t) (shell . t) (C . t))) (require 'ob-python) :hook ((org-mode . org-indent-mode) (org-mode . variable-pitch-mode) (org-mode . visual-line-mode)) :init (setq org-agenda-files '("~/Notes") org-babel-default-header-args:python '((:results .

 ```
 I tried moving org-babel-do-load-languages to :init.
 I tried moving it at the end of my configuration after (elpaca-wait).
 I tried putting it inside (eval-after-load 'org).
 If I go to an Org file (and I see that the configuration is getting loaded, because things like org-agenda-files appear), and I do C-c C-c on a Python source file, I receive the message No org-babel-execute function for python!.
 The only way it works is if I do ielm and either manually do the org-babel-do-load-languages thing, or I run (require 'ob-python).
 It's been all day and I can't get it to work inside my configuration file.
 Can somebody help me please?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[OK, I never have completely left but I have been trying other options and let me tell you - it is not better on the other side!
 I tried Helix - too limited for now.
 Neovim - not wanting to do things on my own, I tried pre-built configurations and nothing worked, even after having to upgrade to a PPA to get an up to date version.
 Kate - still too limited but getting there.
 VSCode - ok, this is my fallback for when I need something now and Emacs is not there. It could be my main driver but I don't like Microsoft 's approach to open source and the fact that keybinds are not the same in Linux, Windows and Mac!
 I am using Spacemacs and it mostly works, I just have to work on getting some layout and behaviour the way I like it!
 It looks like I am getting to the point where Emacs will finally become my main (if not only!) editor. Quite a change for someone who has tried many, many times!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm on Windows 11. Emacs installed via Msys2. Everything was working fine for months until about 6 weeks ago. Now my emacs appears to hang when waiting for an external process to respond. I can most consistently repro with M-x package-refresh-contents. My emacs then hangs with the "Importing package-keyring.gpg..." message and never responds. Fortunately, C-g gets it to respond again. Here is my backtrace: 
 epg-wait-for-completion(...) epg--import-keys-1(...) epg-import-keys-from-file(...) package-import-keyring("c:/msys2/mingw64/share/emacs/28.2/etc/package-keyring.gpg") package-refresh-contents() 
 This is on my work PC and I thought for sure something must have changed in my environment that's causing this (even though I haven't changed anything in my emacs config). I've used emacs for years but I'm a novice when it comes to debugging it. After having no luck troubleshooting for hours, I decided to install Msys2 and emacs on my home PC to compare my work PC to a working emacs install. To my surprise, it is broken in the same way on my home PC even after being freshly installed with no custom configuration.
 Anyone have an idea on what the issue could be?

 I then used M-x treesit-install-language-grammar and selected python.
 And then when I run python-ts-mode, I get:

If point is on a heading that has a visible subtree, call org-cycle to fold that subtree.
 If point is on a heading that has a folded subtree, call org-cycle to unfold that subtree.
 If point is on a heading that has no children but is not a top-level item, call outline-up-heading to go to its parent heading, then call org-cycle to fold the subtree that contains the item at point.
  
This would provide an all-purpose 'toggle-visiblity-at-point' command. Maybe outline-hide-subtree / outline-show-subtree / org-show-children would be more efficient in all or some of these cases than org-cycle?
 I could probably cobble something together myself, but having only the most rudimentary grasp of Elisp, it would take me a good deal of browsing forum posts about how to determine heading states / levels plus trial and error so I'm hoping someone here will bite and help me out.
 Many thanks!

WSL2 cannot not modify Windows NAS drives, even if you mount. A deal breaker for me.
 The Emacs GUI can't be repositioned using Windows hotkeys like native windows.
  
I tried the pre-compiled Emacs on Windows, but it is slower than WSL2. Typing latency is not as good. Trying this sample benchmark, with pre-compiled Emacs, it took 6-7 seconds to finish. With my compiled Emacs, it took 2.6 seconds.

 I would like to learn some basics in LISP so that I can not only understand some of those setups but also be able to create some quick modifications of my own. 
 Is this going to be a waste of time? Is there a quick guide for someone who has almost zero knowledge of programming? (A computer scientist told me LISP was actually hard to use nowadays, so I should not spend time on this. I should just keep using others' setups for my own purpose.)

 How can I get the entries in file2 to show up under the correct dates along with the ones in file1?

Drawing trees functionally: Reingold and Tilford, 1981 by William Yaoh

 ZuriHac 2023 is getting closer and we're excited to announce that we will offer a number of 20 minute lightning talk slots to those participating in-person:
 https://zfoh.ch/zurihac2023/#lightning-talks
 Traditionally we've only done invited talks but several people have expressed strong interest in this so we're happy to try it out this year. We welcome submissions for this until the 12th of May.
 We're also still looking for sponsors for this year's ZuriHac! If you are working at a company that's using Haskell, please check if they're interested and get in touch with us -- ZuriHac is one of the best places to recruit Haskellers.
 For more information on the event see https://zfoh.ch/zurihac2023/. Hope to see some of you there!

 So I created a function that takes in a list of lists and returns the list with the shortest length.
 For example, 
 short [[1, 2, 3], [1, 2], [1, 2, 3, 4], [1]] = Just [1]
 Problem is I need it to work for infinite lists too.
 For example,
 short [[1, 2, 3], [1, 2..], repeat 5, [1, 2, 3, 4], [1]] = Just [1]
 How should I go about it?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In case some haven't been watching, I'll mention that Simon Winchester's new book Knowing What We Know on knowledge to transmission was published by Harper on April 25th in North America. For zettelkasten fans, you'll note that it has some familiar references and suggested readings including by our friends Markus Krajewski, Ann Blair, Iaian McGilchrist, Alex Wright, Anthony Grafton, Dennis Duncan, and Mortimer J. Adler to name but a few.
Many are certain to know his award winning 1998 book The Professor and the Madman which was also transformed into the eponymous 2019 film starring Sean Penn. Though he didn't use the German word zettelkasten in the book, he tells the story of philologist James Murray's late 1800s collaborative 6 million+ slip box collection of words and sentences which when edited into a text is better known today as the Oxford English Dictionary.
If you need some additional motivation to check out his book, I'll use the fact that Winchester, as a writer, is one of the most talented non-linear storytellers I've ever come across, something which many who focus on zettelkasten output may have a keen interest in studying.]]></summary>

A wide variety of domains, such as multimedia, securities trading or compilers,

producing different data processing pipelines tailored to a particular task at hand.
Consider your favorite compiler: it consists of a lexical and syntactical analyzer, a possible preprocessor,
some optimization passes (which can be turned on or off),
various optional static analysis features, a code generator, and so on.
Yet, some of these steps might depend on each other,

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m a long time vimmer and having sparsely used spacemacs in the past and later doom emacs, have set out to write my own vanilla config.
 I’m trying to define leader based keybindings similar to doom and spacemacs with SPC as the leader.
 It seems that general.el is the preferred package for this. But I found that evil mode also presents evil-set-leader and allows for configuring prefix based commands. Further we can customize text for which-key prefixes which changes +prefix to +custom_text for instance.
 I’m considering setting up the entire leader based keymap with evil’s existing support. Is there any shortcomings to this? What can general provide me with that I cannot get with evil’s leader support? 
 Appreciate any advice on this.

Our latest projects no longer use Scala, and we've even gone so far as to refactor some complex legacy Scala code into more streamlined Golang. 
 As someone who loves Scala, it's been a bit disheartening to see this shift in adoption. Has anyone else experienced a similar transition within their organizations? And for those who have, what do you think are the driving factors behind this change?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My workflow uses an e-ink tablet for reading (textbooks) and rough note taking (lectures, exercises). My rough notes sync from my e-ink device to my laptop, where I use Obsidian to transform my e-ink notes into more fleshed out notes (Evergreen notes).
 I like being outside and work/study from different places and one hurdle I run into is I don’t have a way of accessing my nice fleshed out Obsidian notes on my e-ink device. Usually I have to have my laptop/phone next to me and reference my notes from there, which is not ideal. 
 Now, this has me wondering if I can warrant myself switching to emacs and org to have my computer notes (org files) easily accessible on my e-ink device. 
 I have been doing a bit of searching and I guess org-publish and then accessing a website on my e-ink device could work. Perhaps mass exporting all my .org files as pdfs/epubs and then syncing them to my e-ink device. (I don’t know if that method could keep backlinks)
 But as I have never used org and this is just my speculation I came here to ask: Is this feasible? Do any of you have a similar setup? 
 Thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When writing, I would like to have a tool that would tell me if the word I'm writing has already been used (and where) in the current paragraph, so I know I have to search for a synonym or an alternative way of expressing the meaning that what I want to convey. I'm not talking about repeated words just as typos or mistakes (e.g., repeating "the the" or similar). I mean some package that, in a paragraph like:
 "This is important as the peaks are mirror images of one another. Upon further inspection, these images show another interesting features. The most important [position of point]"
 would point me/highlight the fact that the "important" I'm writing is a repetition within the active paragraph. Knowing this, I could easily think of a synonym and instead of writing "interesting" I would write "relevant". This could seem like a simple task that the user can perform without aid, but the point is that in long paragraphs, this repetitions are hard to spot without re-reading the whole thing, which usually breaks the flow of writing.
 Does anyone know of a package (or a way) to accomplish such a thing?
 Thanks in advance for all your help.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I edit a lot of LaTeX and use xenops to generate LaTeX previews.
 Recently I've been wanting to change themes sometimes, but xenops generates snippets with bg/fg colors based on the currently set theme. I'd like to be able to change the bg/fg colors dynamically based on the current DOOM theme. 
 I've successfully written a function that changes the XML data to the new bg/fg color of the xml in-place, and hooked it to doom-load-theme-hook. However, xenops still renders a new preview for the exact same text.
 For example, say i have a xenops LaTeX snippet 
 \(S^1\) 
 generated for the theme doom-zenburn.
 I can change the theme, and the XML file for the associated to the above snippet has its colors updated. In fact, if the preview is visible inline, and I change the theme, the preview changes its colors. This is expected behavior.
 However, when I enter the LaTeX snippet and exit it again, xenops regenerates the snippet for the new theme. Is there a way to prevent this? I don't want to generate new snippets per theme as this would take up unnecessary disk space and compute resources.
 My gut tells me it's not possible. Xenops seems to generate svgs with random names, but I'm not sure how it decides to choose which svg to show in-buffer. Anyone have any ideas?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm 4 months into a new job and have struggled a fair bit, mostly in my own personal time, to set up a developer environment that doesn't involve completely dropping my personal values.
 This mostly led me down the path to the simplest Vim on WSL2 install I could manage while trying to use Window's sometimes unreliable WSL2 interop. Things don't always work easily in this manner, especially when the rest of the team knows how things work one way, and I'm on a completely different track.
 Well, I've installed my old friend Emacs as a native app on Windows and was gobsmacked by how little I had to change to get things productive.
 Why use a VM when I can just install the Emacs operating system inside of Windows?
 I know proprietary software is a touchy subject with GNU folks. I just wanted to express my gratitude for being able to help feed my family with a shred of software freedom.

Then it goes on to say that the XDG-compatible location is in ~/.config/emacs. This is all well and good, and I want to use the XDG-compatible model, but I still have ~/.emacs.d which appears to contain my elpa, melpa, and org libraries that I've installed. I'm just getting going with this config, so I haven't installed much yet.
 Is there a way to make the packages install somewhere else? I'd rather have them in $XDG_DATA_HOME, which for me is in ~/.local/share. Or do I just accept that ~/.emacs.d will be there always and use emacs -l $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/emacs/init.el to startup my emacs?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi r/orgmode!
 I'm seeking some advice on how to effectively use org-roam. I'm particularly interested in hearing how others utilize org-roam in their workflows.
 I've developed a system where I create index pages for each major subject. These org-roam files are tagged with :index: and usually left empty. 
 For instance, if I were learning Python, I'd create three index pages: Python, Theory, and Examples, with the last two having backlinks for the first one.
 When I take notes related to a particular subject, I create a new note and insert a backlink to the corresponding index page. This way, when I need to find a specific note, I can simply visit one of the index pages and review its backlinks, instead of trying to remember what name i gave to the specific note.
 While this method has been somewhat effective for me, I'm wondering if there might be a more efficient or more organized way to approach this. I'd love to hear about any tips, tricks, or workflows you use in org-roam when learning new topics.
 Thanks

 They get the job done and apply dark theme by default and light theme when I launch emacs --light ,but somewhere after applying all my configuration, init stops with Unknown option '--light' instead of opening the splash screen. As I said, the config is applied correctly and everything works as expected, but it feels bad.
 How do I resolve this?

 I did a very basic configuration, and projectile is doing something silly with the files but can't understand how to stop it, the file will basically not open if I try:
  (use-package projectile :ensure t :diminish projectile-mode :bind (("C-c p f" . helm-projectile-find-file) ("C-c p p" . helm-projectile-switch-project) ("C-c p s" . projectile-save-project-buffers)) :config (projectile-mode +1) ) (use-package helm :ensure t :defer 2 :bind ("M-x" . helm-M-x) ("C-x C-f" . helm-find-files) ("M-y" . helm-show-kill-ring) ("C-x b" . helm-mini) :config (helm-mode 1) (setq helm-split-window-inside-p t helm-move-to-line-cycle-in-source t) (setq helm-autoresize-max-height 0) (setq helm-autoresize-min-height 20) (helm-autoresize-mode 1) (define-key helm-map (kbd "<tab>") 'helm-execute-persistent-action) ; rebind tab to run persistent action (define-key helm-map (kbd "C-i") 'helm-execute-persistent-action) ; make TAB work in terminal (define-key helm-map (kbd "C-z") 'helm-select-action) ; list actions using C-z ) (use-package helm-projectile :ensure t :config (helm-projectile-on)) 
 And when I try opening a file through projectile-find-file I see the ansi color escape codes appearing. Anyone knows how to fix this thing?

 Also, can anyone share an experience of using http4s in a prod environment? What are the specs of vm it needs to handle 1000 rps?

 Hi there! I've been trying to troubleshoot this issue for several hours but I haven't got any success.
 My code in my init.el is like this:
 ```
 (setq org-directory "/Users/myname/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/Org/")
 (add-to-list 'org-agenda-files "/Users/myname/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/Org/tareas.org") ```
 However, when starting emacs I get this:
 ``` Warning (initialization): An error occurred while loading ‘/Users/myname/.emacs.d/init.el’:
 Symbol's value as variable is void: org-agenda-files ```
 I have double checked my path but I'm still getting that same error every time I start emacs.
 I have this in my org-agenda-files variable description:
 org-agenda-files is a variable defined in ‘org.el’.
 Its value is ("/Users/myname/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/Org/tareas.org") Original value was nil
 I'm completely able to see my agenda because tareas.org is recognized correctly, but only after I go to my init.el and manually evaluate the function. When I start emacs the agenda is empty. 
 Thanks!

Right now I basically have a few files that are TODO/DONE/WIP.org so then that way I can minimize my clutter. I feel like any time I try to have just one file it almost immediately gets messy and not worth editing.
 ​
 What are your approaches and stuff you use? I have been using org-hyperscheduler and that has been really nice!
 ​
 Also, when using TODO/DONE they get highlighted. How do I add more words to that list?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a peculiar habit where I use the shell from inside of emacs (as opposed to C-x d) to open another file in emacs. Ex., I do M-x shell RET and then:
  $ emacs somefile 
 and this has the unfortunate effect of opening another emacs frame with the file I requested, instead of using the same emacs sessions and adding another buffer or the like. I was wondering how I could configure this to add another buffer with that file in my current emacs session.
 I've been looking into emacsclient and it seems this may do what I want, but I wanted to ask if anyone has any experience with this. My emacs is lightning fast (native-comp), so outside of avoiding duplicate emacs instances, I would have no other use for it (simply a convenience thing).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello Emacs community!
 I've recently developed my first Emacs package called say-region.el
 , and I would appreciate any feedback or suggestions you may have. This package allows users to send a selected region of text to speech synthesis ('say' command(, which reads the text out loud using the default text-to-speech voice. 
 I would be grateful if you could provide any comments, improvements, or suggestions you may have. Please feel free to submit pull requests, report bugs, etc
 say-region.el
 An Emacs package that sends a selected region of text to be read out loud using the default text-to-speech voice. 
 https://github.com/smoge/say-region.el
 Installation
 ​
  
Clone the repository or download the say-region.el
 file.
 Add the following lines to your Emacs configuration (init.el
 or .emacs
 ):
  
​
 (add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/say-region.el") (require 'say-region) 
 Replace /path/to/say-region.el
 with the actual path to the say-region.el
 file.
 Usage
 ​
  
Enable say-region-mode
 in a buffer:
  
​
 M-x say-region-mode 
 ​
  
Select a region of text in the buffer.
 Press C-c s
 to send the selected region to the say
 command, which reads the text aloud.
 To stop the speech, press C-c k
 to kill any running say processes.
  
Limitations
 This package is designed for macOS and uses the macOS-specific say
 command. For the moment, it is not compatible with other operating systems without modifications.
 Contributing
 Feel free to submit pull requests, report bugs, or suggest new features by opening an issue on the GitHub repository.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Thanks for reading folks!
 I've just updated to an experimental Emacs build (30.0.50) and prayed on first run .. but my existing massive .emacs came up pretty well, only a couple of gnits. One of the warnings was not to use docker-tramp anymore due to the built in tramp-container.el
 At a quick glance of the .el and errors it produces, I'm getting the feeling that was designed around local containers (Docker running locally with the Emacs), but not for a remote container
 For example, I use Tramp via multi-hop, so that I can ssh to a server where the containers are running, and run the docker ps and open a shell within the images _over there_
 So a bookmark would look something like:
 /ssh:[foo@someserver.com](mailto:foo@someserver.com)|docker:bar@container:/path/within/docker
 tramp-container.el looks like the same syntax (/docker) as docker-tramp, but I wonder if it only works locally?
 I'll have to try docker-tramp again and see if remote still works there, or am I out of luck on this astoundingly handy behaviour. (or perhaps a local docker daemon can reach out to remote docker daemons, or I can run some ssh tunnels to pretend local is remote, or something..)
 edit: Looks like I had a defcustom override for the docker tramp so it was using 'sudo docker' on the target very old system; so I added a override tramp-docker-program for the new module, but still no dice. (Currently experimenting with things like /ssh:foo@someserver.com|sudo::|docker:bar@containername:/path but still no dice)

 What chat/IM protocols are the better supported in emacs (28 - 29) that offer good support on mobile apps?

 - any other??

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I may be missing something stupid. When I put links in Org-mode files they appear normally, i.e. the whole [[/link][caption]] thing is hidden and I just see the caption with an underline, can click on it, etc.
 I also have my Emacs configured (somehow) to color characters overflowing my fill-column something jarring, and I usually use auto-fill-mode and have no problems with that.
 For example if I have fill-column set to 3 and have a line abcde, de will be colored to mark they're over the line limit.
 However, it seems that whatever's coloring my isn't taking into account what Org-mode does to hide links. So if I have a link [[/link][caption]] which has 18 characters in its raw form but only 7 (caption) are getting displayed, those 7 characters count as 18 characters towards the line limit!
 For example if I have fill-column set to 20 and have a line [[/link][caption]] foo, I expected to see no characters marked as over the limit because I'm seeing just caption foo, but in fact the final oo are marked as over the limit because in that regard it counts as a 22-character line.
 Sorry for the verbose explanation. Does anyone have a solution for this? I could make the color less jarring but this is lowkey driving me crazy.

But, when I am editing and org file, and I use org babel to edit a cpp file, the editor config settings are not read when I use ctrl-c ctrl-' to edit the file. How can I use editorconfig in org babel?
 Thanks in advance

you're using systemd --user and the provided emacs.service
 it dies after about a minute or so after starting (and then restarts because SystemD)
  
​
 sudo dnf install systemd-devel 
 ...before you build (and librsvg2-devel if you want treemacs to work) and all will be well.
 if you don't, then because the service is set up as polling, SystemD will start up the daemon and wait for it to say "I've started". Emacs, not having been built with SystemD support will never send that message, and so SystemD then kills it after a time-out (and then restarts it, which is only polite).
 If you don't want to build SystemD support into Emacs, but still want to run it as a daemon via SystemD (for whatever reason, I'm not judging) change the type flag in the emacs.service file from notify to simple.

 ​
 It's not such an interesting video; the immediate impression I get from the video is that the firm had a spaghetti Python codebase, were looking for something to migrate into, and they coincidentally had a moderately-skilled Haskeller on the team who was able to Just Do It and hack together something that worked, whereas the Rust attempt got stuck at the borrow checker and OCaml didn't have the libraries available for the task.
 ​
 On the negative side, they were unable to deal with Haskell's laziness semantics and had to enable strict for everything. Same thing happened with NoRedInk; they just wanted Elm for backend, Elm's BDFL locked down the compiler and kicked all the backenders into Haskell, and NRI ended up putting Strict into their Cabal / Stack files.
 ​
 You can also tell that there's some level of tension; the Haskell engineer is relatively bubbly, but her boss seems offput and somewhat horrified that they went with Haskell and that's messed up their power dynamics.

 (defun call-api-function () (json-parse-string (request-response-data (request "<URL>" :type "GET" :sync t ))) ) 
 then I use another function to to parse the output from the call-api-function
 (defun parse-output-function (callback) (let* ((content (call-api-function )) (output (gethash "output" content)) (finish (gethash "finish" content))) (when (= finish 1) (cancel-timer my-timer) (apply callback (list output)) )) ) 
 then a third interactive function to run the parse-output-function
 (defun query-api () (interactive ) (setq my-last-point (point ) my-timer (run-at-time 0 1 'parse-output-function 'callback))) (defun callback (output) (save-excursion (goto-char my-last-point) (insert output ) ) ) 
 when I move the cursor to anywhere in the buffer and start typing the function parse-output-function suddenly stops printing anything which means it has stopped working, but its entry in the list-timers is still there.
 I don't know what I'm doing wrong here but I guess it is just a basic pooling where I keep requesting content from the API until the finish flag is set, then I cancel the timer, but this all suddenly stops when I go somewhere else in the buffer and start typing anything.
 Thanks in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi!
 I teach Haskell at the university. Every year I have a problem setting up everything on school computers. Especially for testing during midterms and finals.
 So I made a small repo with scaffolding for GitHub Classroom. It includes devcontainer. So it can be used in browser with complete Haskell environment (in codespace). No need for any local installation. Of course it can be used locally with VS Code. Also autograding GitHub action is set up. It uses HSpec for testing.
 If this is useful to anyone you can find repo here:
 https://github.com/Idokorro/haskell-exam-autograding
 It's nothing much. It's an empty project. But it took me a while to set everything up. Maybe it can save someone some time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just switched to elpaca and was pleasantly surprised how fast it was to spin up a new installation (minutes down to seconds). But I'm surprised to see how much faster startup time is. I had spent a lot of time tuning my config with use-package, and was pretty pleased with a seven second startup. I use emacsclient, so this only really mattered when tuning the config and restarting - but still acceptable.
 But with elpaca, my startup time is just over a second! (measured via time emacs --eval "(save-buffers-kill-terminal)" It's possible that some of this is due to no longer loading things that have been added into Emacs over the time that my configuration has grown (when was org-mode made native??) - and a side benefit of elpaca is that it complained about this and made me fix it.
 But does multi-threading improve both installation time AND start-up time?

 The following code does not compile 
 foo 5 = "5"
 foo 5 = 5 
 Compiler tells that it "cannot deduce ...". OK, get it. The compiler infers the function type from first foo definition and cannot match second definition with this type. However consider this. I can define infinite instances of say type Applicative Functor a for different types a, with multiple function definitions of "pure" that takes operator and returns something of type Application Functor a. Eventually it is the same multiple functions definitions which only differ by return value. 
 Why then it is allowed?

I have worked already with it on my university's computers but want to install it on my own to practice more. I hope this question isn't too obvious and makes sense, but I saw the command needed to install said it must be done by a non-root/non-admin user. I use the main user on my own computer so I have admin permissions and would prefer to just install it there for practicality. So my questions mainly are, am I understanding the requirement right? Will I have to switch users to install it? What would happen if I just do it on my regular main user session? Would appreciate it if anyone can help. Thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm a Typescript programmer by day, but I am learning Haskell by night, I have just finished reading Learn you a Haskell and I've built a simple blog using Scotty and Blaze, and I also worked a little with Aeson. That's all my experience with Haskell. And having experience working with Typescript, which has a lot of really cool typing features, I'm wondering if one can replicate them in Haskell. Specifically, my question is about type mappings and conditional types. In Typescript, one can define an interface (basically, a record type):
 ```ts interface Person { name: string; age: number; married: boolean; }
 interface Profile extends Person { friends: Array<Person>; job: { title: string; salary: number; onVacation: boolean; }; } ```
 And then it's possible to create a new type out of this one by recursively replacing all numbers and boolean with strings:
 ```ts // This type gets a type argument T and recursively replaces all its boolean and number fields with strings type AllStrings<T> = { [Key in keyof T]: T[Key] extends number ? string : T[Key] extends boolean ? string : AllStrings<T[Key]>; };
 function parseBadJSON(badJSON: AllStrings<Profile>): Profile { // mapping logic } ```
 Moreover, you can see record type inheritance with extends keyword.
 I had a task at my job where I needed to parse a JSON that stores all values as strings, and I needed to map it to a JSON with numbers and booleans, where they were supposed to be, so that's how I achieved the correct typings for my mapping function (parseBadJSON). How would you do that in Haskell?

 but it is not enough. Before, if I wanted to perform the shell command equivalent to man 2 read I would do M-x man RET 2 read. Emacs doesn't like the numbers and spaces, and takes multiple seconds to load it up, whereas M-x man RET read is instantaneous, but not what I want. 
 What is the easy way to grab a specific numbered man page?
 Something where I can see all the reads would be ideal, so that I could do something like M-n within man-mode to browse through my options, or even something that can see whether I'm in a shell buffer, or in C mode and grab the relevant man page.

 I'm having an issue with my Haskell code and I was hoping someone could help me out. I have two methods, a and b, both of which use the space function that accepts zero or more spaces. The a method works correctly by skipping over any spaces and then parsing the input " a". However, when I execute the b method with the input " a", it gets stuck in an endless loop.
 I suspect the issue has to do with the use of the "many" function in "space", which is causing the endless loop when b is executed. However, I'm not quite sure why this is happening.
 If anyone could shed some light on this issue and explain why the b method is causing an endless loop, I would greatly appreciate it. Thank you in advance!

However, whenever I‘ve told people that I know Haskell they’d either: a) laugh and ask why that was my main programming knowledge or b) joke I should work in a “Haskell basement shop” (?). I’ve never personally applied my Haskell knowledge after I graduated college or thought to.
 So this may seem like a dumb question, but I’m genuinely curious, what do all of you here use Haskell for in real life, not including for school/academics?

 https://github.com/jimeh/yank-indent
 It’s the first package I’ve written in years, so I’m more than happy to hear any feedback and/or criticism, as I’m fairly out of the loop :)
 My goal was for the package to be something you install and enable once and never have to think about again, as it enables itself in relevant buffers only, and ignores buffers (YAML, Python, Makefile) where it would cause issues.
 If anyone is curious of the hacky solution I used to have in my config, here is the comment where I initially replaced it with an earlier version of yank-indent.

 In the example below if the user selects an ice cream I want to show the ice cream options and hide the pie options. If the user selects a pie I want to clear the ice cream selection, show the pie options and hide the ice cream options.
 (transient-define-prefix restaurant-menu () ["Main Course" ("m" "main course" "main-course=" :choices ("hamburger" "cheeseburger" "chicken sandwich"))] ["Dessert" ("i" "ice cream" "ice-cream=" :choices ("chocolate" "vanilla" "strawberry")) ("p" "pie" "pie=" :choices ("apple" "cherry" "pumpkin"))] ["Ice Cream Options" ("c" "chocolate sauce" "chocolate-sauce") ("s" "sprinkles" "sprinkles") ("w" "whipped cream" "whipped-cream")] ["Pie Options" ("r" "crumb topping" "crumb-topping") ("w" "whipped cream" "whipped-cream")] ["Order" ("o" "order to dine in" order-food-dine-in) ("g" "order to go" order-food-to-go)]) 
 I tried :if predicates, but it seems they only evaluate upon initial prefix setup, not when values change.
 I also experimented with the Setting up another transient manually in the Transient Showcase, using transient-setup to dynamically replace the current prefix with a new similar one, but with ice cream or pie options. It looks like the same transient with the dessert options dynamically changing. The problem there is that it nests the child transient, so you have to type C-g twice to exit. It's also a little inelegant as I copy and paste most of the transient definition into the two variations. It seemed like the wrong tool for this job.
 Is there a way to dynamically hide and show infixes in transient based on the current argument values of other infixes? Or is there a more appropriate UX pattern to use for this scenario with transient?
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A literate org mode document that tangles, using noweb an org file into a theme file is a nice way of organizing themes by the files and sections they customize instead of by the sections needed by the file. See: https://gitlab.com/stefan.koch.micro/dotfiles/-/blob/master/emacs/stefan-theme-tangle.org
 Details:
 I spent the weekend setting up my own color theme. What I did not like about how this is done is that the color theme file is broken into sections by the need of the functions to define it. What I wanted to do was to setup the theme organized by the mode or functionality. Since others sharing has helped me in the past, I thought I would share this with the community. (See: The Proximity Principle at https://kula.blog/posts/proximity_principle/)
 I had been using the following techniques anyway, so I was most of the way there:
  
Used GNU Stow to manage my dotfiles (Brandon Invergo' Using GNU Stow to manage your dotfiles: https://brandon.invergo.net/news/2012-05-26-using-gnu-stow-to-manage-your-dotfiles.html
 Used literate config file using org-babel. This lets you write an org file with emacs lisp source code blocks that are saved to an .el file when it is tangled.) See Literate Programming here: https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/intro.html#literate-programming
  
But, this still made me sequence the code in the sections that the theme file required. I did not want that. So noweb came to the rescue. Using noweb, you can have a source block that will include references to source blocks defined in other areas of the org file. This allowed me to organize the file the way I wanted to. The top of the file is the skeleton for the theme file with the sections defined, and the sections below each add to the theme section as they need.
 In case you missed it above, see https://gitlab.com/stefan.koch.micro/dotfiles/-/blob/master/emacs/stefan-theme-tangle.org for the full details.

 Can you give me some examples or explanations about this? Any viewpoint will be appreciated.

 The finalizer doesn't work, why?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Been struggling with this for a while so I caved and just run my code from shell rather than the Python buffer.
 What my current process is:
  
Open Shell buffer
 Navigate to the folder my .py file is in
 python3 -m venv myenv
 source myenv/bin/activate
 Return to Python buffer
 m-x pyvenv-activate
  
Step 6 above will only work the first time I set it all up, after that it doesn't seem to do anything! Only way to get it working again is to delete the virtual environment and set it up again, I don't want to do this every time I re-open my program. So as I said, I've been just been going to shell buffer and doing source myenv/bin/activate every time and then just running my code from there rather than the Python buffer.
 Any advice how I am supposed to do this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, it is a bit (to say the least) frustrating. I have two libraries: one is using UTCTime from Data.Time, another TimeSpec from System.Clock. I've searched through Hackage/Hoogle and could not find any easy way to convert between them. The only way I can come up with is to base calculations on current time which is both inefficient and convoluted.
 Does anyone have any ideas?
 EDIT: some context.
 I am trying to cache JWT token validation results using https://hackage.haskell.org/package/cache. Cache expiry has to be specified using TimeSpec. JWT tokens are parsed and validated using JOSE which in turn provides token expiry using UTCTime.
 EDIT2: rant. I am new to Haskell but it is sometimes a frustrating experience (although I am positively surprised in general: Nix + Haskell Flake + HLS + VSCode is a pretty nice interactive dev environement) - compositionality is one of the main advertised advantage of the language. In practice it is very often difficult to combine different libraries as they are based on some incompatible concrete types (in this case cache could have abstracted away the actual time representation as it is not really important to its operation)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone. I'm teaching myself Haskell and only beginning to understand the necessary precision of type declaration. I'm trying to get my final list of outputs to be Doubles. My simple function here calculates multiplying an investment and removing some % profit, outputting a list of net profit as repeated each of n times:
 mtp x y z = [ ( investment * ((flip*percent)^n)) | n <- [1..6] ] where investment = x percent = (100-y)/100 flip = z 
 So for example mtp 1000 10 2 outputs:[1800.0,3240.0,5832.000000000001,10497.600000000002,18895.680000000008,34012.22400000001]
 Based on using :t to check, type declaration is currently:
 mtp :: Double -> Double -> Double -> [Double] 
 but still giving me those long decimals
 Help would be much appreciated, thanks :)

 The first one is the one mentioned in the title. I'd like to make sure some cleanup code is executed when leaving the transient, however that may happen, with transient-do-quit or with C-g, whatever. But I can't seem to find a way to do that. I even tried to create a suffix overriding C-g but couldn't get that to work. I also tried (desperate measures...) to advise the transient and wrapped it in unwind-protect itself, without success. So, is there a way to ensure some code is executed after the transient? 
 The second is that I'd like to let bind a variable while the transient is active. Is there a way to do that?

 Ideally, I'd like something like the Emacs UI; hierarchical bullets, which are collapsed by default and that you can toggle on and off. "Expand all" and "collapse all" would be nice to have too.
 Another nice bonus is if I could this just by importing some JS in the generated HTML header, without requiring any extra package.

 I use EWW as a browser in emacs but sometimes I need a browser that is more GUI oriented. I stumbled on two such browsers that can be used in a terminal: Carbonyl and Browsh
 My knowledge of elisp is still very limited and I was wondering if anybody had succes using such a browser inside emacs. Is this possible and how can this be achieved?
 Thanks!

 I'm really excited to announce the release of Dunai 0.11.0 and Bearriver 0.14.2!
 Dunai is a reactive programming library structured around a notion of Monadic Stream Functions. Dunai can be used to implement other reactive and FRP frameworks on top, including Classic FRP and Arrowized FRP variants.
 Dunai comes with:
  
bearriver: API-compatible implementation of Yampa. (The Bear River is a tributary to the Yampa river.)
 
dunai-test: QuickCheck-based temporal testing library that can be connected with the testing system haskell-titan.
 
 See https://github.com/ivanperez-keera/dunai#features for details on Dunai's features.
 This release has addressed mainly styling issues. All library code now conforms to the main rules of the style guide we follow (which is publicly documente…]]></summary>

 First, I tried:
 ```lisp (use-package slime :config (straight-use-package 'slime-company) (setq slime-contribs '(slime-fancy slime-repl slime-scratch slime-trace-dialog slime-cl-indent slime-company))

 EDIT: I forgot to mention that the docs site is broken on mobile for now. Please view on Desktop if possible.
 TL;DR - Okapi, a web framework that I started working on last year, now uses an Applicative instead of a Monad. This has made the framework a lot more consistent and easier to understand. It also makes it possible to automatically generate OpenAPI specifications from your endpoint definitions. It should be possible to generate clients as well, but I haven't worked on this yet.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello!
 I'm currently taking a Functional Programming course, and we are using Haskell. I had a really hard time setting everything up, but I think I finally have something that is somewhat working. I'm using a M1 Mac so I decided to install ghcup using brew. I then installed everything else haskell related using ghcup (stack, cabal, ghc, and hls). When I then started working on my assignment the code had some imports like Random and HUnit. So in order to get that to work I tried to install those using Cabal. At this point I noticed that I also needed llvm so I installed llvm@13 using brew and added the path to $PATH. I then did cabal install --lib random and it worked! However, I have found out that this is probably no the preferred way of using cabal and I wanted to switch to a stack project which leads me to my question.
 Is there a good way to remove this libraries that I installed? I have found that the files are installed in the .cabal/store/ghc-8.10.7. In this folder I have HUnt-1.6.2.0-18526221 and rndm-1.2.1.1-c70f7c08. Can I just remove those files? Or is there a better way to do it? I basically do not want random and HUnit to be installed for every Haskell projekt I'm working on moving forward. Some noteworthy things might be that when I do cabal list --installed they don't show, but I can compile the code without any issues.
 I hope I was able to explain my issue and appreciate any help I can get. If there are any issues with the way I installed llvm or haskell stuff that would also be extremely appreciated. It feels like I have spent way to much time on just setting stuff up and would need to start doing some actual programing...

 ​
 These two languages come up because they're enormously popular languages with large ecosystems that recapitulate many of the benefits of Haskell, and for which hiring is relatively easy.
 ​
 Rust, for instance, captures much of Haskell's correctness, missing only HKTs, although the development of Generic Associated Types promises to duplicate much of the capability of Haskell higher-kinded types.
 ​
 What's more, Rust has stable memory use and performance characteristics, and while the black art of pushing Haskell to C speeds hasn't wholly died, Rust in general outperforms Haskell both in time and space complexity.

 The command

 I had a problem: every file I open has a delay of up to 5 seconds before I even saw it. This is definitely an issue with eglot+clangd because when I disable it completely everything works just fine. Then I set eglot-sync-connect to 0 and it helped with opening the first file of a project.
 How can I speed up opening other files in a project? This is my profiler report for opening a file with projectile + swiper. The delay before I can interact with emacs was about 3-4 seconds.

 P.S. lsp-mode + clangd has the same issue.

 With nerd-icons.el, you only need to install one nerd font (e.g. from https://www.nerdfonts.com) instead of installing a bunch of fonts that just do one thing (display icons).
 Nerd-icons.el also provides unified experience in TTY and GUI.
 Nerd-icons currently supports dired, minibuffer-completion, treemacs, doom-modeline, and more on the road...
 As a heavy user on both mode, this is a killer feature to me.

 Do you know what are the workflows of the key contributors of Emacs? I am talking about key role people like Eli Zaretskii and Po Lu.
 I know that Richard Stallman has expressed it here:
 https://stallman.org/stallman-computing.html
 But, I did not find much about other key contributors.
 I am specifically interested in their approach at using Emacs and I am asking because that might teach me something new or perhaps help me re-evaluate how I use Emacs.
 Do they use the default Emacs keybindings?
 What packages do they rely on?
 For which tasks do they use Emacs?
 What other software do they use and why is Emacs not suitable for covering those needs?

 I recently bought a course in udemy for org mode, I think it’s the only one there in that platform. Considering I’ll be using beorg I think I have a long way to go and learn. 
 I won’t ask for resources as there are plenty. However, I’ll ask for some successful cases of people that aren’t in the CS field or are developers. This because I just want to organize my life in plain text and use some of the other perks org provides. 
 So, how long did it took you? How do you use org mode?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I love org-sparse-tree. However, I want a variant of it that will hide all headlines that don’t contain a match for a regex word. This is different from the usual behavior where, if a tree doesn’t contain a match, the entire tree is collapsed and the level 1 heading is still visible.
 This would be useful because some of my documents have a LOT of headlines, and I currently have to scroll a lot to see the matches of org-sparse-tree. Is there a package that does this? If not, any rough idea of how to hack org to do this?
 Thanks for any help!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm beginning the process of writing a JIT compiler for a custom DSL that will be embedded in a commercial product. Though I come from the Rust world, I figured this would be a great opportunity to learn and use haskell for my compiler.
 2 days later and I'm still failing to get a project to build with the LLVM bindings. The repository seems fairly inactive, is many versions behind modern LLVM, and recent github issues documenting build issues have been met with silence. This seems like a very basic package for a language that is supposed to be well suited to writing compilers. I did not expect to have this issue at all. Even flipping Python seemingly has more up to date LLVM bindings.
 So I'm sadly considering abandoning using haskell for my project. Are there other bindings I'm not aware of? Is there some other way people do code generation?
 I would love a solution because I was looking forward to learning haskell.
 Thanks for the advice.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[no-littering used to set backup-directory-alist so that all backup files are created in ~/.config/emacs/var/backup/.
 (Even if you don't use no-littering, check the value of that variable. I suspect that many users have themselves customized that variable to put all backup files in a single directory, in which case they would also be affected.)
 If you use emacs/emacsclient as EDITOR and an external tool opens an unencrypted file containing some sensitive data in a directory on a tmpfs file-system, then the backup file would by default be created in the same directory, so it would not hit a disk and be discarded after a reboot.
 Note that this only affects you, if the visited file is not encrypted. So if you, for example, visit ~/.authsource.gpg, then the backup file is also encrypted, regardless of where it resides.
 Please update to release 1.3.0 or snapshot 20230420 and delete all files ~/.config/emacs/var/backup/!tmp!... and ~/.config/emacs/var/backup/!dev!shm!....
 This gets you back to how Emacs behaves by default.
  
The default isn't so great either. No backups are created for files in /tmp, but for files in /dev/shm backups are created. To prevent that you would have to use a custom backup-enable-predicate function. (If you don't do that, then the backup files sticks around until a reboot, but at least then they get discarded.)
  
This issue was discovered a day ago (https://lonely.town/@wasamasa/110227701055899570) and was reported an hour ago (https://github.com/emacscollective/no-littering/issues/200).
 In the future, please report security issues privately.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m just getting started with org-mode in Emacs and am looking at options for keeping my org files in sync between computers — specifically, between two Macs. A complication is that on one of the Macs I am limited in what software I can install, for work-related reasons (for example, syncthing might not be an option, Dropbox is probably OK, as is iCloud Drive).
 It’s most important to me that the syncing should be robust, reliable, and secure. I’d like to have files sync automatically in the background, rather than having to trigger a sync manually before leaving one machine or starting on the other. Similarly, it would be good if I don’t have to remember to close all buffers before I leave a machine (i.e. if conflicts and simultaneous editing aren’t a problem, or at least that resolving conflicts doesn’t risk losing data). Also in terms of avoiding data loss, I’d like to be able to make backups of the files, ideally with versioning in case I need to go back and fix something.
 End-to-end encryption would be desirable if it’s cloud storage (which might make iCloud Drive preferable to Dropbox). Being able to sync to an iOS app like Beorg would be nice too, but is less important.
 However, one concern I have about iCloud (apart from some suggestions that it's not always reliable) is that it seems like you can’t always guarantee that all files are really stored locally on the Mac, rather than only in the cloud, even if you don’t select “optimize storage" (see for example https://eclecticlight.co/2022/02/21/can-you-back-up-icloud-documents/ ). So, it seems that backup solutions aren’t guaranteed to be able to see and backup the files stored in there (if they happen to be online only). Otherwise, I’d be happy to do my own backups of the directory with something like rsync to my NAS.
 Are there any solutions that fit my wishlist, or am I being too demanding in what I’m looking for? Any pointers would be very welcome!

Typical of when I'm in class, my note take is slowed. More accurately, my refactoring of notes into atomic-sized notes has slowed. I will add as many words to my ZK, but each note is bigger. Because of the speed of the class, I don't feel I have time to refactor the notes I've captured from reading, say, "Read Hot Epic." I keep all the ideas captured from the story in a single note, hoping to atomize the note sometime. In the meantime, I have all the ideas, and because of my search skills, the ideas are not lost.
@Sascha's article Why the Single Note Matters is a real eye opener. Care and attention must be paid to each and every note. The effort in this practice is what is called zettelkasting. The rewards are a supportive ZK partner. If you consider this a downside, the downside is that this activity siows time. You will naturally slow down. In a non-pressure environment, this is a good thing. Not so sure it works in a classroom setting with a schedule to keep up with.
I've started a list in my journal of projects to advance once I've completed the food writing seminar. That way, they can be off my mind and safely on a list. (Classic GTD principle)
I'm reading - Fisher, M. F. K.. The gastronomical me, Penguin Random House Publisher Services. 1989.

 I never build a package, so I was wondering what would be the best way to generate (modern looking with fast (light) and smooth integration) charts in an Emacs buffer. 
 Note: I usually use Plotly Python for my dataviz, but I know JS offers more possibilities, so I'm considering learning how to use some JS dataviz libraries (like d3.js) .

 I'm using Emacs version 29.0.90 (Development version 2b10e1827d3b) and I keep encountering the issue in subject when I install a package. That is, Emacs seems stuck (I waited for multiple hours) while scraping files for loaddefs. If I stop the process (C-g) and restart Emacs, I get the error:
 Error loading autoloads: (file-missing Cannot open load file No such file or directory /home/marcop/.config/emacs/elpa/<pkg-name>/<pkg>-autoloads)
 Do you have any suggestion on how to debug?
 Cheers
 --- EDIT 1 – 2023-04-20 12:26
 Actually, not all packages create this issue. So far, I identified csv-mode, ess, org-contrib, and polymode as problematic packages.

While a broad biography of a seminal figure in the development of art history in the early 20th century, there are some interesting bits relating to art and memory as well as a mention of Frances A. Yates whose research on memory was influenced by Warburg’s library.
Of specific "note” is the fact that Aby Warburg (1866-1929) had a significant zettelkasten-based note taking practice and portions of his collection (both written as well as images) are featured within the hour long documentary. You'll see it in the opening scenes in t…]]></summary>

 I am trying to get skewer-mode to work, in particular, I want to see changes I make to html files in emacs to be automatically updated in the corresponding browser window. I have tried to follow the descriptions on the package's GitHub page and also this Emacs Stack-Exchange post, but neither of these affords me the "live change" I seek, and most other guides don't regard HTML, but only CSS or Javascript (which I'll also need, but that's for later).
 Do you know of any good guide that you can recommend, or do you have personal experience with this package and care to share some insights?
 Also, while I'm at it, I am also open for tips when it comes to webdev. I currently use `eglot` and `tagedit`, which makes editing quite a bit less of a hassle, but I still miss the coziness of editing lisp with `sly` and `paredit`.
 Have a good day, folks :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was reading about "storyboarding" as a useful way to arrange research and prepare to write. The book (Turabian) said the utility of a storyboard versus an outline, is that you can easily move information around. This made me think of org mode, which I already use productively for outlining. 
 So I know it already can do the basic task of storyboarding as is. However, I was curious about whether org mode could display information more like a "storyboard." Either horizontally or (maybe better for not having to scroll so much) tiling.
 I imagine this would work with the top level heading defining a card / unit and then units would be displayed horizontally or in a grid, rather than a vertical list.
 Is this something that already exists?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fourmolu is a formatter for Haskell source code. It is a fork of Ormolu, with upstream improvements continually merged.
 0.12 comes with some pretty notable changes: * GHC 9.6 support * A new single-constraint-parens option for disabling the feature of adding parentheses to contexts with one constraint * A new column-limit option for breaking lines at a given length (as much as possible) * A new --print-defaults CLI flag for generating a default fourmolu.yaml config file
 With this release, we're also excited to announce a new website: https://fourmolu.github.io! The website contains a web app where you can paste in Haskell code, change configuration values, and see the result. It also contains docs for each of the configuration options with examples. As this is the first release of the web app, there are bound to be bugs and things that could be improved, so please write an issue for anything you find in the web app!

 Long time user of emacs (since 1994 or 5 using emacs in terminal on a sun sparc workstation) but not a long time init.el file customizer. But now I'm trying to fix some things that really bug the crap out of me and this is one. I use which-key (because my memory sucks), but as you see from the gif, it shifts the buffers in the main windows. Is there a way to prevent this so that when the side window goes away, the buffers (and cursor position) remain at their original position?

 I've used the profiler, but there's nothing to see, it's just opening/saving the file.
 I've looked at task manager and I'm spotting any culprits (the two machines have different AV setups).
 I'm using the 64 bit 28.2 version on both machines. 
 I've chased all over the internet looking for things to try and nothing seems to make a difference. I've been using emacs in one version or another since the 80s and this is the first time I'm considering giving up on it. 
 Using docker or cygwin is a possibility on one of the machines, but not the one I use for client work.
 Any ideas?

 I use the API to parse the buffer and I select headings for further processing:
 (let ((buffer-ast (org-element-parse-buffer))) (org-element-map buffer-ast 'headline (lambda (hl) (when (= (org-element-property :level hl) 1) ...))) 
 Here hl is a headline, and I want to get and set its properties (the stuff in the :properties drawer). I am reading the documentation for the API (API documentation link) and the Syntax (Org syntax link), but I don't get how to get or set a property.
 Thanks for your help

 I found vdirsyncer which seems like a nice and promising idea similar to maildir which I already use with notmuch, even though it seems too opinionated and the support for Google calender seems largely untested/unsupported.
 More annoyingly, Microsoft Exchange calendars do not support CalDAV which means one must use tools like davmail. I've had little success getting DavMail to work with two-factor authentication and vdirsyncer also warns that davmail can lead to data loss or strange issues (davmail seems too big, being in Java, for me to hack around). 
 Has anyone had success using Exchange calenders in Emacs? What is your workflow?
 Is anyone using vdirsyncer with Google and/or Exchange? Any hints you can share?
 Thanks!
 PS: I've asked a similar question before and I know of org-caldav, which still requires a CalDAV proxy and org-gcal, which only works for Google.

 Back when I discovered flyspell, it was (for me) a big leap forward in usability and speed. I've used it since, until now. Even so flyspell is nice, it still made editing feel a bit sluggish. Therefore I enabled it only, when editing prose and never while coding.
 But jinx is so fast and non-disturbing, I keep it globally enabled all the time.
 You might like it, too. :)
 (I'm using it on Linux, and do not know how well it works on other OSes, since it utilizes libenchant.)

 Now, the same code snippet in my emacs looks like this: https://abload.de/image.php?img=screenshot2023-04-181ksiav.png
 Does anyone know how to get these?
 I am using Doom Emacs with emacs 29, I installed the treesitter package from doom. (I know it is built in in emacs 29, but this was still active from my config from emacs 28)
 I active treesitter with `(global-tree-sitter-mode)` and `(add-hook 'tree-sitter-after-on-hook #'tree-sitter-hl-mode)` in my config.el.

 I want to parse a simple line with a Regex.
 Regex match will return a Maybe (Array (Maybe String)). I'd like to lift the inner array. Is there a library function that does Array (Maybe a) -> Maybe (Array a) (or even Array m a -> m Array a)? I can't find anything with that exact signature on pursuit, but I'm not crazily experienced using it... ;)
 Also, is this a very bad approach? My target files have some lines matching the regex and others that don't. A valid line will match all groups, and I need to access all of those groups individually in the next step.
 I'm also not that fluent yet in the group theory speak...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There was a problem that intrigued my mind which i solved lately.
 I have many org files under a Dropbox directory. And also i have a scratch.org file on my desktop. I have wanted an easy way to refile all headings from scratch.org file to files in dropbox. I thought of an elisp form at the top of the file which will act like a button by evaluating with eval-last-sexp command.
 I also wanted this refiling thing for the files in Dropbox. Every file would refile to a specific file.
 I couldn't create those elisp forms that will act like buttons easily. It was harder than i thought. I found org-refile function hard to work with programmatically. 
 After wasting so much time about this problem, i found a rather simpler and maybe even intuitive solution.
 I add local variables to each org file. An org-refile-targets and org-archive-location variable for every file. This solution doesn't give a one click way to refile all headings to a file, but it does give a simpler and focused way to refile and archive headings to specific org-files. 
 I found this solution very satisfying for my workflow. If is there anyone wasting 4 months in order to setup their essential org workflows, i hope this helps.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've found my GTD someday-maybe file hard to manage. So I want to try a new trick to improve things:
  
Capture someday-maybe items as entries with a date 2 weeks in the future
 I evaluate everything in that file every week. If I want to keep the item, I promote it by either moving it to another file, or removing its timestamp.
 For each item, if I haven't promoted it by the time its timestamp rolls around, then org-mode deletes the entry
  
This means I want a plugin or a command or something that will delete items with expired timestamps. I looked through the org manual, and found C-u C-u C-c C-x C-s (https://orgmode.org/manual/Moving-subtrees.html) that will archive items under these circumstances. I want to delete them.
 I suppose I could set up the archive file to be /dev/null ! I'll try that and see what happens.
 [EDIT] I tried to set #+ARCHIVE: /dev/null::%s at the top of the file in question (someday.org), but when I archive using C-c C-x C-a it sends it to ./someday.org_archive instead.
 [EDIT2] I just made it re-read the file and tried again, this time I got the answer that /dev/null isn't going to work :( File exists, but cannot be read Copied: Subtree(s) with 19 characters funcall-interactively: Buffer is read-only: #<buffer null> 
 [EDIT3] I've made peace that someday.org_archive is workable - I'll just think of it as landfill. So where I'm stuck currently, is to make org's capture template set a date 2 weeks in the future when I capture an item to someday.org. I looked through the org manual's entries on capture templates again, but it doesn't look like there's an answer for this.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This Release Candidate version of Indigo (a Scala 3 pixel art 2D game engine for Scala.js) is the result of six months work and will hopefully become a full release after undergoing a bit more testing. Feel free to take it for a spin! 🚀
 It contains a good number of general improvements that are based on real usage during the production of our biggest demo to date, hopefully coming soon-ish!
 The main bulk of the work is a total replacement of all GLSL based shaders in favour of programs written using Ultraviolet. Ultraviolet is a Scala 3 shader program writing library that is currently aimed at WebGL + GLSL. The purpose of this work is to begin to separate Indigo from Scala.js and WebGL, so that the project can look at supporting other rendering technologies (WebGPU is the next likely target), and one day, other platforms like the JVM and/or Native. Custom GLSL shaders will still be supported for the for the foreseeable future, but existing shaders will require very minor modification to be compatible.
 Indigo's website is slowly going through a necessary rebuild, so for now it's advisable to check out the release notes below if you decide to try this version out. Alternatively, do come and say hello on our Discord server if you need any help, or even just to show off what you're making. 😁

 There's a possibility of a lot of overlapping GameStates, so I introduced a Set into the picture
 uniqueGameStates :: SET.Set GameState -> GameState -> ([GameState], SET.Set GameState) uniqueGameStates alreadyExplored g = let allPossFiltered = filter (\x -> not (SET.member x alreadyExplored)) $ possibleGameStates g newSet = SET.union (SET.fromList (g : allPossFiltered)) alreadyExplored in (allPossFiltered, newSet) oneLayer :: SET.Set GameState -> [GameState] -> ([[GameState]], SET.Set GameState) oneLayer s [] = ([[]], s) oneLayer s (g : gs) = let (iRes, newSet) = uniqueGameStates s g in (iRes : fst (oneLayer newSet gs), newSet) 
 I want to write a createDecisionTree function 
 createDecisionTree :: SET.Set GameState -> GameState -> DecisionTree GameState 
 But I have no idea how to compose oneLayer together with uniqueGameStates to create the DecisionTree. Oh, and btw, I have a inEndState :: GameState -> Bool function as well for the base case of createDecisionTree. I have no idea what the recursive case looks like. Help!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This package displays remote images inline in org-mode with automatic caching. The next time you visit the file or fetch the image, it will be instantly fetched from the cache.
 This feature is present in Doom Emacs, and when I switched to GNU emacs, I found that I was quite fond of that feature, so I made it here. You can finally do [[https://gaodean.me/gen/cat.jpg]], and have it display inline just like local images. The code here is adapted from the Doom Emacs codebase, and I just thought to make a small plugin to make it simpler to use for GNU emacs users.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For the last year or so I've been trying editors and environments to see what fits me. 
 I installed doom emacs and really quite fell in love with it. But I couldn't make an Emacs config from scratch. Just wasn't a task I could do. It would take maybe a week worth of effort to me.
 Just this weekend I decided I'll give neovim a chance. I started making my config from scratch and found it MUCH easier. Followed some videos and after 2 days I have something I really like and more importantly I understand every snippet of code that went into the config.
 I miss some things. The commands pallete on doom was amazing. Every command, every keymap all just there. Magit is a godsend. So is org mode.
 I have no doubt I will eventually hop back to emacs but neovim has given me the confidence to be able to write my own config. 
 What do you guys think?

 I am curious as to what colors you use for the different levels of headings and if there is some logic behind it...
 Do you simply pick random colors based on gut instinct or do you subscribe to some color theory?
 Or do you differentiate the different levels in another way - using different font-sizes maybe? Or maybe different fonts AND different colors?
 What is your style and why (I am looking for some inspiration...)?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m a total beginner with emacs, but liked the aesthetics of Doom and decided to give it a go.
 After installing Doom, I un-commented the `minimap` line in `init.el` to enable the package, ran `doom sync` in my terminal, started emacs again and enabled the minimap inside emacs with `minimap-mode` but all I’m getting is a small buffer at the right of the window, with an exact duplicate of the main buffer.
 Tried this with various files, same result. I’m using iTerm2 on macOS with Emacs 28.2.
 Any idea what’s wrong?

 I've tried LSP so many times and I'm too frustrated with how difficult and hard it is to configure. Trying to look at other people's configs for this is a nightmare.
 I wanted to ask: Does anyone have an Emacs config that configured LSP or Eglot mode along with proper indentation that 'just works' for the following modern web development frameworks and languages:
  
React
 Vue
 Ruby On Rails
 JavaScript
 TypeScript
 Python
 HTML
 CSS
  
​
 Anything related would be wonderful as I'm sick of trying to fight Emacs to even get this to work properly, even when indentation is concerned.

 Is there some way to get emacs to save the previous session so that when I ssh back (after disconnecting) I could continue from a previous emacsclient session the way tmux allows attaching to an existing session?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I know TRAMP slowness is a recurring topic here, but I didn't see a suggestion on this particular phenomena yet, so asking for advice.
 When I connect to a host at work, TRAMP is trying to find version control configuration all over the file system on the remote host. Git / Bzr / Hg / Svn, in current directory, one directory up, and up, and up... I can trace it in the debug buffer it is taking more than a minute to finish this process which is awkward. I am working from Eastern Europe via VPN, and the remote host is in the US, so it takes a couple of hops while one command completes.
 Is there any way to prevent these checks? I care about version control on my local machine only.
 Thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a Vanilla Emacs config, i see some bootstrap messages (Like load *package*.....done) and then i can use Emacs. 
 ​
 In Doom Emacs, the frame appears as soon as Emacs becomes ready for usage. How is that? Doom Emacs says it took 0.7 seconds to startup, while my vanilla emacs config took 0.37 (i already tweaked early-init), so i guess the DOOM Emacs' devs have configured it so that either the messages do not appear in the echo area or the frame appears only when emacs becomes ready for usage. 
 ​
 How is it possible?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For my own reasons, I've come to use the di- prefix to mean half, in opposition to bi- meaning twice. This has affected me in that difunctor seems to be an older / alternative term with the same meaning as profunctor, as is evidenced by the Profunctor class itself:
 haskell class Profunctor p where dimap :: (a -> b) -> (c -> d) -> p b c -> p a d lmap :: (a -> b) -> p b c -> p a cw rmap :: (b -> c) -> p a b -> p a c 
 It is actually quite awkward, this straddling of both pro- and di-. The type class name uses the pro- terminology (as in pre, and post), but the functions use the di-, l-, and r- terminology. This is unfortunate, as the Profunctor thus claims essential parts of both terminologies.
 For quite some time, I've actually thought of these in my head as promap, premap and postmap, as I have my own orthogonal use case for the di- nomenclature, having derived another dimap (and rmap, lmap) - but they clash in name with the existing profunctor functions, even though prodifunctor and prodimap in my nomenclature are actually sensible classes worth exploring. Privately I've been content with masking this, as I have alternative ways of deriving names, but I thought it was worth discussing with the community.
 What are your thoughts on the positives and consequences of changing the Profunctor nomenclature such that dimap = promap, lmap = premap, and rmap = postmap?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently migrated from straight to elpaca. I'm generally very pleased with the results, but there is one issue I don't know how to resolve, even after reading the manual and trying various searches online. The issue is pretty simple: I don't seem to be able to get elpaca to load updates to any use-package expression after Emacs has started.
 For example, let's say I want to set the value of the user option org-hide-emphasis-markers to t in my config file. I then add (setq org-hide-emphasis-markers t) to the use-package section of org-mode:
 elisp (use-package org :demand t :config (setq org-hide-emphasis-markers t)) 
 (Assume for simplicity that I have no other org-mode customizations.)
 To test the effects of this change, I run eval-last-sexp with point at the end of the macro. However, nothing happens: the new value is not set.
 I thought this may be related to the asynchronous nature of how elpaca handles packages. But evaluating (elpaca-process-queues) has no effect.
 Apologies if I'm missing something obvious.

 Specifically, a C/C++ programmer may have some fun using OpenCL, vulkan or coda on NVIDIA hardware. I know that there are bindings for scala to many of these libraries but honestly I don’t see using them in a functional context to add much wrt the imperative way, instead they tend to be more limited in scala.
 Even more, recent devices like rk3588 are equipped with a NPU, is there a way to have fun with it with Scala?
 What’s your thoughts about this? ZP

 For example, say we have a simple expression language...

 We can define a "debug print" for an Expr which prints its tree structure. Taking inspiration from the example from the recursion-schemes docs, we can use an effectful fold in Reader that keeps track of the current depth:
 type Depth = Int debugPrint :: Expr -> String debugPrint e = runReader (cata debugAlg e) 0 where debugAlg :: ExprF (Reader Depth String) -> Reader Depth String debugAlg e = do depth <- ask let (name, body) = case e of NumF n -> ("Num " ++ show n, []) AddF e1 e2 -> ("Add", [e1, e2]) MulF e1 e2 -> ("Mul", [e1, e2]) ss…]]></summary>

Seeing that he was left org-mode for a new tool, discouraged me from using Emacs and building my own config. It also encouraged me to try Logseq, which is one of the most popular PKM tools alongside Obsidian.
 He says in the tweet:
  
It gives me a lot of what I've used Emacs org-mode for in the past, but with a less fussy interface and less temptation to tinker. (Moving from a system best described as Big Bag of Google Docs, per topic or person.)
  
For me, it was the opposite. I was never as productive as when I was used Emacs. Logseq out of box is very powerful in some aspects, especially in handling multimedia. For example, you can embed a YouTube video and take notes based on …]]></summary>

This allows users to express and prove first-order logic theorems. (Of course, the underlying solver---typically z3---may not be able to determine theoremhood, since first-order logic is semi-decidable. However, modern SMT solvers can handle most instances that come up in practice.)
 Here's a simple example:
 Prelude Data.SBV> :set -XDataKinds Prelude Data.SBV> sat $ \(Forall @"x" x) (Exists @"y" y) -> y .== (x + 1 :: SInteger) Satisfiable Prelude Data.SBV> sat $ skolemize $ \(Forall @"x" x) (Exists @"y" y) -> y .== (x + 1 :: SInteger) Satisfiable. Model: y :: Integer -> Integer y x = 1 + x 
 A set of first-order-logic examples are included in the release. As usual, bug reports, comments, and contributions are most welcome at the github repo.
 Happy proving!

 Is there a way to get the package that owns a certain feature? Also, why do some built in features count as packages?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've developed pure Haskell quicksort on mutable vectors while aiming to match performance of std::sort from C++. While not really hitting that bar, the result is within around 20% in sequential mode and is faster in parallel mode.
 In addition, the package exposes reasonable default sort for most users suitable for just importing and sorting without thinking twice what's going on under the hood.
 Parallelisation is implemented via both sparks and threads and the method is selectable. Unfortunately threads don't show much speedup but users can define ther own, hopefully faster, methods to parallelise. Sparks-based parallelisation is much faster but unfortunately will use all available capabilities at runtime so it's less controllable.
 The repository is https://github.com/sergv/vector-quicksort and the benchmarks are under https://github.com/sergv/vector-quicksort#benchmarks.

In my case they're hardware specs for computers, but the general idea is take a two-column (| key | value |) table from a bunch of independent org files and combine it into one big table.
 Some of the examples I found before used #+INCLUDE statements to grab the table like:
 #+NAME: calamity-hw #+INCLUDE: ./calamity.org::#hardware :only-contents t 
 but I didn't like having to keep this list updated even though it only required executing re-executing a code block. It also required passing each table as a variable into the code block for generating the big table like:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Scala.js's answer to Elm-like frontend dev has had another update, featuring improvements to WebSocket's and the Http client, as well as a variety of user facing enhancements. Full release notes can be found here:
 https://github.com/PurpleKingdomGames/tyrian/releases/tag/v0.6.2
 If you want to see Tyrian in action, check out the amazing all new Rock the JVM "The Typelevel Rite of Passage"* course to watch the build of a full-stack web application from scratch! It's an excellent introduction to Scala.js.
 https://rockthejvm.com/p/typelevel-rite-of-passage
 Also keep an eye out of Daniel Ciocîrlan's recent Scalar Conference 2023 talk when hits YouTube. (Hopefully soon, I hear good things and can't wait to see it!)
 If you'd prefer to read about it, Gabriel Volpe's brilliant new book "Functional Event-Driven Architecture" includes a bonus chapter featuring Tyrian, in which he ports his trading app from Elm to Tyrian.
 https://leanpub.com/feda
 https://github.com/gvolpe/trading/tree/main/modules/ws-client
 Tyrian's giter8 template has also been brought up to date, meaning that you can get your first Tyrian app up and running in five minutes flat! Give it a try, what's the worst that can happen?
 sbt new PurpleKingdomGames/tyrian.g8
 Many thanks, as always, to Tyrian's contributors and community. I love it when people drop into our little Discord server to show us what they've been building!
 (* Please note that while the course and book mentioned above are both based on the Typelevel and Cats Effect ecosystem, Tyrian works with any compatible effect type, and we have a small but growing number of Tyrian+ZIO users too.)

 Please show me what is wrong. And making an alias of function is bad manner in Haskell?

 I'm trying to find a concise name for a special pattern of using return type values as a place to collect evidence about an underlying implementation.
 The essence of the pattern is to replace what would usually be Unit with a new, distinct type. On the trait definition level, the return type is kept abstract, so that each implementation can decide for itself what it means for it to be correct. On the implementation level, however, the type is defined such that it enumerates what evidence is necessary to consider this specific implementation correct. When multiple levels of traits/implementations are at play, the evidence is propagated from level to level in its abstract form.
 The following example should give you a general idea of what I'm talking about:

 Iron is a library enabling developers to attach constraints (also called "refinement") to types. These constraints are evaluable at compile-time and/or at runtime:
 scala val x: Int :| Positive = 5 //OK val y: Int :| Positive = -4 //Compile-time error! val z: Int :| Positive = -4.refine //Runtime exception. Variants for `Option`, `Either` etc... exist 
 Check the Github page for more information.
 Features of v2.1.0
 New error messages
 Iron now has enhanced compile-time errors, clearer and more explicit.

 I have come across Alex(https://serokell.io/blog/lexing-with-alex) and Happy which are libraries for scanning tokens and parsing but as a beginner I would like to look at code that uses Haskell directly. There is a toy grammar for this.My goal is to learn FP for this use case so that I can use the new pattern matching features using records in Java.
 I can compile and execute Haskell( or Ocaml ) in Spacemacs.
 Is there a book for that ? I know about Appel's books. I am particularly interested in patterns like zipper which I have already coded. Are similar patterns useful for parsing and scanning ?

I absolutely love the idea of a modal space menu, and the evil integrations have been fantastic for me.
 BUT. Even though they're great projects, I'd really like to be done with things like spacemacs and doom. They've been a great way for me to see what's out there, but all the built-in customization makes it really hard for someone like me to understand where various behaviors are actually coming from, and at least a few times I've discovered that after much hair-pulling what I thought were plugin bugs were actually problems with the customization layers. I feel like I always end up stripping away as many of the customizations as possible.
 My use case is essentially solid support for C++, maybe some python and glsl, and that's pretty much it. I know eglot & clangd/ccls work well for the c++ part, which i feel covers quite a bit of what I need. With eglot and things like use-package becoming a part of emacs in 29, I'm really getting the itch to just build things up from vanilla emacs, so that I know exactly what is custom and what isn't.
 External things I know I'd like:
  
spacemacs-style menu (is this a package?)
 magit
 ranger for file browsing
 evil integration everywhere possible
  
What major headaches do people see lurking here if I'm keeping things pretty minimal?

 I am running emacs on a Linux machine in terminator with a dark background. The default colors are hard to read, with dark blue on black being used for certain faces and I believe emacs is misunderstanding the background color.
 I think I should be able to set frame-background-mode to help with this. I tried adding (set-variable 'frame-background-mode 'dark) or (frame-set-background-mode 'dark) to my .emacs file, and still when I go into emacs it shows the variable value as being nil.
 Any advice on this, and whether this is the right approach?

How do I tell Projectile to use a different command? And what command do I tell it to use?
 Edit: My emacs config: https://gitlab.com/yramagicman/stow-dotfiles/-/tree/master/config/emacs
 Edit 2: Solved. I have Git Bash installed and was able to add the binaries from that to my Emacs path. Don't know why I didn't think about that previously, but it worked.

 ​
 1) Run an interactive command with arguments. The problem I'm trying to solve is to repeatedly load a file. (Yes, I know about M-x eval-buffer). In vim, I can call the :source command with an argument, for example:
 :source ~/.vimrc
 I can then even type : and hit the up arrow, or :so and hit the up arrow and it will recall from my history similar to bash's Ctrl-r.
 In Emacs, M-x load-file (or :load-file since I use evil) doesn't seem to accept an argument. I'm forced to hit RET, and then the name of the file. Let alone not having…]]></summary>

 I apparently need to add this package, along with its dependencies, to packages.dhall. Should I just be copying the list of dependencies out of the Spago.dhall file from the package's repo? If so, why can't Spago just do that for me when it gets the package and builds it?
 Also, what happens if the package gets updated upstream and the dependencies change? How am I supposed to keep the list in packages.dhall up to date?
 I'm mainly used to the Cargo/crates.io ecosystem so apologies if I'm fundamentally misunderstanding some concepts here.

 there's a specific type of buffer where I can't view non latin characters (hebrew in my case). In all other buffers and minibuffer pop-ups hebrew characters are presented fine, but I'm using prot's `denote` package, which creates a backlinks buffer (nvm exactly what that is if your unfamilliar) using xrefs - and the text in that buffer gets displayed withe characters' numbers, but not the actual letters.
 I have the following in my config file:
 ;; UTF-8 as default encoding
 (set-language-environment "English")
 (set-language-environment "UTF-8")
 (set-default-coding-systems 'utf-8)
 (set-keyboard-coding-system 'utf-8-unix)
 (set-input-method 'hebrew-full)
 ;; do this especially on Windows, for python output problems
 (set-terminal-coding-system 'utf-8-unix)
 And I'm using Doom emacs on windows.
 Thanks for any help!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi community,
 as syntax is contentious a topic as ever, David (the main proposal author) and I would like to invite you to give your input on https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/pull/585, where we propose to change the syntax of the accepted proposal #522 introducing Or patterns. In particular, we'd like to know
  
Whether you like the syntax ((one of 1,2,3), 4) in the original proposal better than the amended one mirroring case of: (one of {1;2;3},4)
 
Whether you like that it is subject to layout, similar to case of, e.g., 
 f (one of 1 2 3) = 4
 Which looks kind of funny here, but perhaps has foreseen use cases.
 
Whether you think it's good or bad to allow f (one of {}) (with layout just f (one of), even), and whether the semantics should be a strict match (mirroring case x of {}) or lazy (like case x of _ -> ...)
 
If you have experience with writing tools for GHC Haskell, whether mirroring case of syntax poses new problems for you, especially caused by it being subject to layout rules
 
 (Note that we understand that you might not like either syntax. That is fine, but the linked proposal thread is not the place to have that discussion. In all honesty, the syntactic appearance is not why we like Or patterns, rather the opposite.)
 Thank you!

I think I traced the problem back to emacs not opening my init.el with utf8 encoding for some reason. I set utf8 characters as the values of several variables in init.el, and this causes problem in other buffers even when emacs determines the encoding of these other buffers correctly.
 I tried using #'recode-region and #'set-buffer-file-coding-system to reencode init.el, but if I restart emacs it keeps detecting the file as "no-encoding". I also tried using (prefer-coding-system 'utf-8-unix) but that didn't help either.
 I'm out of ideas. Does anyone have suggestions for what else I can try?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have been using chatgpt for emacs-lisp programming lately. It is helping me in learning APIs and writing simple functions.
 Today I wanted to write a set of functions to communicate with hammerspoon (the idea is to display in the menu bar the name of the task clocked in, and a continuous update of the time spend in it). I was able to complete my goal faster using chatGPT. When the task is clocked out, reset the menu bar.
 Here is example of what it shows "[0:07] (doing som.." truncated so it does not take too long

 Here are some interactions:

 It is also capable of writing some functions. Here is asking it do some coding:

 Overall, I highly recommend using chat-gpt to increase your emacs-lisp productivity.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[hello all! i’m new here but no stranger to emacs!
 ever since macOS decided to drop emacs, I’ve been wondering for quite awhile what terminal editor is intended to be used instead? I’ve been focusing on using nano (in both Ubuntu and macOS) for about a year or two and I’ve discovered I can’t unlearn emacs bindings after using it for over 25 years - it takes *more* effort to slow down and translate what I want to do into a nano binding which just doesn’t seem efficient to me (not to mention all the times I’ve had to undo my mistakes!)
 I‘m well aware I can just install emacs through homebrew and just wondering what alternatives exist out there compatible with emacs bindings? [and I’m not looking for anything fancy - 95% of the time I’m just doing basic editing of a config file or README.txt]
 I could have sworn there exists a lightweight terminal editor compatible with emacs bindings included with macOS now and I can’t find any reference to it so thought I’d wave the white flag and post here!

 I have the following snippet in my init file to add some custom searches for rg:
 (with-eval-after-load 'rg ;; Provide some custom searches for Lisp libraries (rg-define-search rg-emacs-lisp "Search the Emacs lisp default libraries." :dir "/usr/local/share/emacs/" :flags '("--search-zip") :files "*.{el,el.gz}" :menu ("Emacs Libraries" "b" "Built-in")) (rg-define-search rg-emacs-elpa "Search Elpa packages." :dir package-user-dir :files "all" :flags '("--glob=!*.elc") :menu ("Emacs Libraries" "e" "Elpa"))) 
 With that snippet, right after startup, if I call M-: (featurep 'rg) the answer is t. But, if I comment it out, the answer is nil. So that bit is triggering the loading of rg. But, since it is set (with-eval-after-load 'rg ...) I'd expect this to run only after rg is loaded for some other reason. How does trigger the loading of the package? Is there any way to make these settings while avoiding the loading of rg?

 The file tree displays a sign next to folders that have uncommited changes when in a git repository, and also shows a sign when the file or folder contain some error detected by the LSP. Like in the following image:
 nvim-tree
 Is there a way to do this in emacs? I use neotree, but I would be comfortable using any other file tree plugin if I could get this behavior.
 Thank you very much in advance!

 I watched some videos on Scala-Native and saw that the Java libraries which are used to some extent by Scala for the JVM are NOT usable for Scala-Native. Does this mean some parts of them have to be rewritten in Scala? how else might their use in the JVM world be replaced for the Native world?
 Is this a project new people can join? I'd love to see some good compiler writers join the project to get it moving along quicker.

 I'm very new to emacs, my journey has been vim followed by VSCode and now I want to dabble with emacs. I managed to set up evil, which was very straight forward but now I am struggling a lot with everything with typescript. 
 I've identified that I need lsp-mode, lsp-ui, tree-sitter, dap, tree-sitter-langs and tide to have a decent environment up and running. I have the following script setup:
  (require 'package) (add-to-list 'package-archives (cons "nongnu" (format "http%s://elpa.nongnu.org/nongnu/" (if (gnutls-available-p) "s" "")))) (add-to-list 'package-archives '("melpa" . "https://melpa.org/packages/") t) (package-initialize) (require 'use-package) ;; EVIL (require 'evil) (evil-mode 1) ;; DAP-MODE (use-package dap-mode) (setq package-list '(dap-mode tree-sitter tree-sitter-langs)) ;; TREE SITTER (require 'tree-sitter-langs) (require 'tree-sitter) ;; Activate tree-sitter globally (minor mode registered on every buffer) (global-tree-sitter-mode) (add-hook 'tree-sitter-after-on-hook #'tree-sitter-hl-mode) (setq package-list '(dap-mode tree-sitter tree-sitter-langs lsp-mode lsp-ui)) (use-package tree-sitter-langs :ensure t :config (tree-sitter-require 'typescript) ) ;; LSP (require 'lsp-mode) (add-hook 'prod-mode-hook #'lsp) (setq lsp-keymap-prefix "C-c l") (dolist (package package-list) (unless (package-installed-p package) (package-install package))) 
 I've installed the packages but don't really see anything. No syntax highlighting, nothing. Any clue where to even start?

 But in emacs via elpy debuger it throws out into simple python prompt when the pdb reach the end of the program. The same when trying to use restart or run command - it goes to simple python prompt.
 How to make it stay in "pdb-mode" after program ends (like in terminal)?

 In the first buffer, I push escape to go to normal mode, and then I switch to the second buffer.
 In the second buffer I will still be in insert mode.
 Not really consistent with vim, and annoying if I want to quickly switch back to another buffer but not realising I'm in insert mode and typing some shit. Now I got to back space and go to normal mode before switching.
 Any simple way to fix this? Both google and chatgpt have been less than helpful.

Moreover, I’d like to present crem, a new Haskell library to build state machines, and explain why Haskell plays an important role in making crem special.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey Everyone, I created a curated Scala jobs aggregator FairJoin.com - right now it has 350 Scala jobs from 80 Companies. I created it because I've been a Scala Engineer for the past 10 years and it's always been a pain finding jobs that actually use Scala. 
 An example of why it's a pain: LinkedIn claims to have 30,000+ Scala jobs, but you click on most of them and they say "Requires experience with languages like Python C#, C++, Java, Javascript, Rust, Go, Scala, or Kotlin". They just use Scala as a keyword, and you'll never actually use Scala in that job.
 With FairJoin I review every job posting to ensure it has a high likelihood of actually using Scala. It's early stages, but some of the next features I plan on adding are filters for things like location and Scala specific attributes (i.e. Functional, Akka, Cats, Data Engineering), as well as more company info.
 ​
 I hope it's useful, and I'd love to hear your thoughts either here or email me at stephen@fairjoin.com

A few months into it, people started talking about using straight.el instead of package.el, so I moved my configuration over to using straight.el. However, now people are saying package.el is the best option and that people should not really use straight.el anymore. I have had good experience with straight.el since some packages I like are not on melpa. Additionally, I have tried downloading and using emacs-29, and it seems to run into issues when using straight which makes me lean more towards using package.el unless there is some way to fix this. Which package manager should I use, and why (I have also heard about elpaca which seems to have nice UI and fixes some issues that straight has, so what about that versus straight and use-package)?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was trying to make a backend to xref that depends on external programs and realized there seems to be no way to not block while waiting for a response. I was wondering if there is an alternative framework to xref that wouldn't block. Ideally, I am looking for something that would take care of timeouts and would abort calls to async-xref if I make a new one. 
 Or maybe there is a better approach to the problem I have that I haven't imagined?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On April 20th at 19.30 UTC, I'll be speaking with Simon Peyton Jones, one of the team behind Haskell, on a YouTube livestream. 
 Simon is renowned for his work in lazy functional languages, and I'll be exploring his career of building languages, especially Haskell, but also C-- and most recently Verse. We'll dig into his work at both Microsoft Research and Epic Games, and exploring the lessons we can take from a monumental career. At the end we'll put your questions to him in an AMA.
 Everyone is welcome to come and join in and ask questions. You can set a reminder on YouTube.
 The interview is part of Exercism's #12in23 - a year long challenge to encourage people to try 12 new languages throughout the year. So far, I've interviewed José Valim (Elixir), Louis Pilfold (Gleam), Cameron Balahan (Go), Josh Tripplet (Rust), and  Bjarne Stroustrup (C++) - they're all available to watch back on YouTube!

 Does this need additional configuration? I can't really find any docs on it either:(

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I find myself often re-arranging windows especially because I use projectile compilation or deadgrep etc, which pop up additional windows, or replace the one I'm currently working in.
 I used to use CEDET 15 years ago, and I liked the way it kept the layout fixed, with a lower buffer (similar as to VSCode does it) "capturing" all what could be considered process-output. And then up on top I'm free to do whatever.
 Is there something comparable? I'm wary getting CEDET itself into my life, as all its tools seem to be pretty dated.
