 However, on typing C-c C-z, it shows error Could not find any installation of GHC. 
 ![Screenshot of above error]1
 And when I use same command again, it launches a new window with what looks like ghci. But when I try to type and execute something, it shows an error "haskell-process" has died as below. (If it matters at all, there is a tests.cabal in the directory where the current open file resides)
 ![Screenshot of haskell process died error]2
 If I enter y then it throws the same error as above about GHC not being found. 
 Now I have my GHC, Stack, Cabal, and HLS installations managed through GHCup. Therefore by default, I only have the ghcup path in the system PATH variable. 
 Since many places online said that there needs to be the ghc path in the PATH, I added the line export PATH=$PATH:/home/axiom/.ghcup/bin/ghc to my .bashrc. But this didn't fix anything. 
 Further, I looked for other solutions and tried two more things: 
 I added the following lines in my .emacs.d/init.el :  (setenv "PATH" (concat "/home/axiom/.ghcup/bin/ghc" (getenv "PATH"))) (setq exec-path (append '("/home/axiom/.ghcup/bin/ghc") exec-path))  Adding this also didn't solve anything. 
 Then I replaced the above lines with (setq haskell-process-path-ghci "/home/axiom/.ghcup/bin/ghc") and this didn't help either. 
 I think the error Could not find any installation of GHC. is being returned from a piece of code in this file https://github.com/haskell/haskell-mode/blob/master/haskell-customize.el but I am not able to figure out how to fix my system according to what the haskell-mode code is trying to do before throwing the above error.

 The reason I thing this is a emacs thing and not a whitespace.el or even theme related thing is because it also happened to comments when I used a different theme (I used gruvbox-dark before and now I use catppuccin-mocha).
 Anyway, if someone could tell me what causes it and more importantly how could I disable it, I would be very thankful.

 Sorry if it's a beginner or very obvious thing, but I swear I tried searching with a lot of different terms and couldn't find anything related to it (I say this expecting the actual answer to be something very obvious)
 ​
 Update: I was looking for something to help me in the emacs docs, and in the face attribute page i foun this:
 :distant-foreground Alternative foreground color, a string. This is like :foreground but the color is only used as a foreground when the background color is near to the foreground that would have been used. This is useful for example when marking text (i.e., the region face). If the text has a foreground that is visible with the region face, that foreground is used. If the foreground is near the region face background, :distant-foreground is used instead so the text is readable. 
 Solution: add this to your init file
 (set-face-attribute 'region nil :distant-foreground nil)

 The tutorial that helped me with the initial configuration of Emacs is Elpaca, so that is what I am using. This is my AUCTeX configuration. 
 (use-package auctex :ensure t :defer t :config (setq TeX-auto-save t) (setq TeX-parse-self t)) (setq-default TeX-master nil) 
 This seems to enable the package successfully, and I can compile files and preview them as PDFs, although it sometimes gets stuck on compilation and I have to try again.
 Also, strangely keybinding on my machine seems to be different than the ones in the documentation and guides, for example, "C-c C-e" does not trigger latex-insert-block, but latex-close-block.
 All of this seems very strange, and I have not found anyone having such problems online.

 As part of moving all my calendar needs to Emacs, I wrote a short package that displays the calendar of the org date/time picker in the minibuffer (with support for mouse selecting and other common calendar keybindings).
 Calendar in mini-buffer
 It's done by advising org-read-date and so should work for all org related date picking.
 To use, copy the file in the gist somewhere accessible from Emacs, followed by
 (require 'org-minical) (setq org-read-date-popup-calendar 'minibuffer) (setq org-minical-exit-on-click t) 
 Comments are welcome.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a stupid question. I create a trait that attempts to encapsulate a third party library. Initially there will only have one specific library instance implementation (Let's called it library A). Later on there will add some others. To my best of knowledge, I can make use of type class for such purpose. The code is below.
 # Scala version 2.12.x # JDK 11 trait MyTrait[T] { ... some methods ... } object MyTrait { def apply[T: MyTrait]() = implicitly[Logging[T]] implicit val lib1 = new MyTrait[Lib1]{ ... } } 
 Now there is another question coming in. When using this library A, it depends on some external information. However, when creating type class, it can't pass additional information because it's created by initializing trait. Though I can directly pass those additional information during implicit trait initialization like `new MyTrait[A] { val a = ...; val b = ...; }`, it's hard coded, and becomes global variables, which looks not right to me. 
 Any suggestions to achieve such goal in a better way? Many thanks.

All good. But... I have a more complex project setup (flutter create my_project) and my main.dart exists in the lib subdirectory. I created a .projectile in the project root, I also did a "git init" to be sure of "project root" purity.
 But here's the issue: every time I open the main.dart , LSP asks me again to import it: it doesn't remember it has done AND flycheck shows no errors. I'm out of ideas of what it can be. I've a feeling it's going to be something painfully obvious.
 I removed the lsp session.el to check that wasnt corrupted too.
 (eglot deals with the same file in the same lib subdirectory with no issues.)
 Suggestions?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[An idea I've had for a package for a while is one that would use spaced repetition to teach keyboard shortcuts.
 My thinking is that it would draw the shortcuts to teach from a few lists, including: - Shortcuts manually set by the user. - Shortcuts for functions often called by the user with M-x. - A manual list of shortcuts the user could define (this could include shortcuts for programs outside of Emacs).
 A simple idea, but I feel what could make it handy is that, if the user uses a keyboard shortcut in the normal course of using Emacs, that would count as a 'review' of the shortcut. So that would delay the next time that shortcut will come up.
 If a shortcut became a part of their regular use, the review time would get so long, they never see it again (so they're not wasting time learning shortcuts they have already internalised).
 I've been using a very rudimentary and undocumented version of this for some time, and I've found it an enormously helpful tool to help myself learn keyboard shortcuts.
 Interested to hear if others would find this valuable, or if this is something only I'd find worthwhile. Also interested to hear any suggestions people may have.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I know this also comes down to preference, but i'd like to get some input.
 I'm currently 100% in neovim for my day-to-day work. I know want to also start a personal emacs config for a more "gui" like editor that can also do a bit more outside of text editing. In all my emacs attempts so far, i included evil mode, as it's close to what i know from neovim. But i can't help but wonder if i'm skipping a portion of what emacs is.
 So, with that said: If you started from scratch, migrating from vim, would you go with evil mode or stick to "stock" emacs keybindings? Maybe of interest: I use a ergo keyboard with thumb keys. So, Ctrl, Alt, Shift, Meh and Hyper are pretty easy to access.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[SimpleX Chat is a fully open-source, private and secure messaging platform. It is the first, and it seems the only, messaging network that does not have any kind of user identity in its design (not even random numbers) - it uses anonymous pairwise identifiers instead.
 It is also a seed stage startup with a lot of user growth in 2022-2023, and a lot of exciting technical and product problems to solve to grow faster.
 We are looking for a systems Haskell engineer who:
  
wants to work in a startup (high pace and intensity, longer hours, a substantial part of the compensation is stock options, solving only customer problems and avoiding over-engineering).
 expert in Haskell, including: 
 strictness.
 network libraries.
 exception handling, concurrency, STM.
 type systems - we use ad hoc dependent types a lot.
 
 exceptionally pragmatic.
 has some expertise in network protocols, cryptography and general information security principles and approaches.
 
interested to build the next generation of messaging network.
 
does not suffer from "not invented here" syndrome, and at the same time interested to design and implement protocols and systems from the ground up when appropriate.
 
 We prefer links to projects and blog posts and short descriptions to CVs – please don't send more than 1/2 of the page.
 You can apply via LinkedIn, or, better, just reach out.

 running, ongoing record with number of sets, - weights
 wrestling moves

        <updated>2023-07-20T20:37:15.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all!
 I wanted to make a fair bit of progress before announcing it, but a few weeks ago, I started working on lightweight bindings to the Botan cryptography library's C FFI. Initially, I was trying to revive the defunct Z-Botan bindings, but stripping it of its non-building dependencies proved to be infeasible, and the embedded version of Botan also proved to be out of date. Rather than give up, I decided to make a project of it, and start from scratch with fresh bindings to the latest version in modern Haskell.
 This approach has been extremely rewarding, and today, I am proud to share that I have hit a wonderful milestone - I am halfway through implementing the low-level 1:1 bindings.
 Right now, the bindings support:
  
Hashing
 Message authentication codes
 Symmetric ciphers
 Block cipher modes
 Public key signatures
 Bcrypt and Password hashing
 Random number generators
 Base16 and Base64 encoding
  
Frankly, it is awkward to use, isn't versioned yet, and does not even have any algorithm constants (yet!), but as long as you can read the Botan C FFI docs, it works - and if everything keeps going as smoothly as it has, a friendlier high-level interface isn't too far away.
 I don't have a project page yet, but if you want to follow this project, you can check out the repo, or you can follow the devlog on the Haskell Discourse where I've been more-or-less posting daily.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I just started my emacs and I have configured the display line numbers mode to be enabled on startup.
 However, I noticed that the "emacs tutorial" buffer does not open with the line numbers enabled.
 But if I open the "Emacs guided tour" buffer, the line numbers show up for it. Also for other files (example Haskell file I was editing, the line numbers are automatically enabled when I open it)
 So seems like only for the "emacs tutorial" buffer its not showing the line numbers. I'm curious as to why that is since the config clearly says it should be enabled globally. 
 My startup screen where the buffer links are shown for reference :

 Rough idea: Can we design a more coherent keybinding based on the god-mode with sub-modes invoked by the default mode, consisting the following components
  
X mode (which obeys part of existing C-x things, but not all anyway)
 Convert mode (which converts keys in the default mode for a new layer of functionalities)
 Visit mode (which controls buffer navigation, page scrolling without changing the content)
 Insert mode (which allows characteristics input, including minibuffer) 
  
where default mode itself has a layer of functionalities such as p for previous-line, n for next-line.
 Any of those sub-mode is invoked by a char in the default mode, once invoked, you stay at one of those mode unless terminated by an escape key (i.e. g), where it needs consecutive press of gg for exiting insert mode.
 More intuitions: suppose we set the visit mode to the v, it navigates to the previous buffer by vp, once in the loop, you can navigates again by p, or n for next buffer until it receives the termination key g.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone,
 I wanted to let the community know that I recently made a fork of mu4e-send-delay that is compatible with recent versions of Emacs and mu4e. If you aren't aware, this is a package that provides functionality to mu4e similar to Gmail's "schedule send," which sends emails after a designated amount of time, rather than immediately. In addition refactoring the codebase, this package is also compatible with Org-msg. There are other differences, and they are enumerated in the newly-renovated README.
 The original repository may not be maintained anymore, and has been inactive for the last several years at the very least. I use the package myself but had to clean up and update the code so it works with current Emacs. I thought I'd share my updated version.
 Anyway, here's my fork: https://github.com/krisbalintona/mu4e-send-delay
 Cheers!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One classic appeal of Haskell is that its type system allows experts to define very precise constraints within the program’s problem domain.
In my working experience, such powerful constraints are a double-edged sword for projects with long lifespans.
These sophisticated types do, as promised, statically prevent many kinds of costly mistakes and are indeed expressed via definitions that resemble the particular problem domain better than many other general purpose languages would allow.
On the other hand, the requisite definitions tend to be dense and leak noisy details of how exactly the domain-specific constraints were encoded in the GHC Haskell type system.
This is sadly often apparent in the poor quality of error messages that arise when these type-level programs catch a user’s mistake.…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Haskell extensions (GADTs, KindSignatures, etc) are a very interesting thing. There are plenty of tutorials on how to use them - which is not very helpful for understanding where they come from.
 The question is simple: how to make a new extension? OR: how do people make a new extension?
 The question is also more complicated:
  
How do people manage to have so many slightly incompatible versions of the same language without generating dependency conflicts? 
 There certainly exists mutually exclusive extensions. What are some examples?
 Do we have a trivial demo extension, say, inserting a new keyword into the language which does nothing?

 I've been working for a few months on bringing the various helpful Emacs browser packages together in an extensible, multi-browser package. It is called ibrowse.el and its goal is to be able to control your browser through common actions, be it on browser tabs, history or bookmarks using Emacs.
 It relies on the completing-read built-in interface, and thus benefits greatly from integration with consult, marginalia, vertico and embark. 
 You can find it right there : https://github.com/nicolas-graves/ibrowse.el
 I would love to have some feedback and hope it will be useful to you. Let me know what you think !

 A new line is only after I enter a new command and get the output in the same line.
 Below is an example of what I see in the terminal.
 ```bash

 This is a question for all the double-spacers out here. You use the default (setq sentence-end-double-space t). How do you do the sentence spacing for quoted text? Do you write it like this?

I want to experiment with Emacs, and I stumbled across a few tutorials that show how to customise your own emacs.d - I thought if I could have (for instance) one stock config, one Doom Emacs config, and a couple of tutorial configs I could avoid getting stuck so hard that I have an unusable Emacs. I would like to avoid installing different copies of Emacs on the same machine, but if that is the way to go, I suppose it would not be the worst thing.
 Is it possible to have multiple Emacs configs? Is there a way to choose at startup which config or "profile" you want to use for that session? Or does Emacs even work that way?

However, the backtrace keeps disappearing after you run "next-mode" in edebug - does anyone know if you can "make it stick"? It's impossible to debug code when it disappears each time you step to next line.
 Those are such basic things, emacs makes life really hard for new users.

 I've checked that org-file-apps uses default program to open html (librewolf) and hyperlinks work with it correctly.
 Does anyone know what function is responsible for finding/opening files in ox-pandoc package? There was a similar issue in 2016, but the function author mentioned seems no longer available in doom emacs.
 UPDATE: I've traced the code down to this function in ox-pandoc.el:
  (process-put process 'buffer-or-open buffer-or-open) 
 This should start pandoc with the name of the output file (.html). I will try to run edebug on it and see if values can be inspected.
 UPDATE2: I seem to be hitting a wall with edebug. Does anyone know how to use normal debugger in doom emacs? It doesn't seem to have any run function or any debug- function? You'd think that things like that would be documented.
 org-file-apps:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There are several reasons I think Vim is more popular. Here are some:
 - The emacs subreddit has less than half as many members. 
 - Google trends shows that people search for vim more than emacs.
 - In the 2018 stackoverflow survey, vim came out as 6 times more popular than emacs.
 If vim is more popular, do you think this reflects a preference for vim—or are people just not aware of the existence of emacs?

To reproduce this in the simplest case, I renamed my .emacs file and then started up Emacs 27.1 without it. I then created an empty new .emacs file, and on the first line I typed a semicolon and a few words. When I pressed Return, that semicolon indented about 40 characters.
 Can anyone tell me what's going on and how to stop it?

 It should be enough to change [ ] on third line to TODO. However all examples I could find only use add-to-list function to create new capture templates instead updating the existing one. I'd rather not edit the existing files to avoid conflicts when updating (doom) emacs.
 Would you just create a new entry with a different letter? Or can you just a new entry with the same letter and org will use the newer one?

 Hello,
 I am currently reading a paper about an algorithm that hashes programs while respecting alpha equivalence (Interesting read! source: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.02856.pdf)

Because of corporate complications, that I cannot talk about, the process of new app installing is long and ultimately uncertain. So, I am trying to set up Emacs to work with Python. I get a tutorial and everything. But the very first step is failing for me. I added this lines to the ~/.emacs
 (require 'package) (add-to-list 'package-archives '("melpa" . "http://melpa.org/packages/") t) (package-initialize) (package-refresh-contents) 
 I saved the file and restart Emacs and get this error:
  
Error in process filter certificate validation failed melpa.org, verification code 1026
  
I tried to google for it, but did not find anything. I suspect that connections like that might be blocked by some firewall rules or something similar - again, tight security. But it would be nice to find out if that is the case, because it is still possible that I just did something wrong or that I can fix it somehow without talking to server admins.

 First a bit of context. Learning Haskell forced me through multiple "epiphanies" about building software (if you are on this subreddit you know) and the jump from OO languages with imprecise or non-existent type systems to working with pure functions and a mathematically coherent type system changed the way I build systems. Unfortunately, it took years of pain before I jumped into functional programming, simply because I didn't know there was another way of doing things.

 I checked basic exporting from org to pdf. I got the error:

 I'm back with a follow-up on GPT-Commit, the AI-powered tool that generates commit messages. First off, I want to extend my gratitude to everyone who provided feedback on my previous post. Your insights have been invaluable in refining GPT-Commit.
 In this new blog post, I've shared real-world examples of how GPT-Commit works with different types of commits, specifically using actual commits from the Angular project. I believe these examples will give you a clearer picture of how GPT-Commit can be utilized in your workflow.
 The post also discusses the benefits of using GPT-Commit and how it can help developers save time and increase efficiency. 
 You can read the blog post here: https://ywkim.github.io/gpt-commit-real-world-examples-benefits/
 The examples are all based on actual commits from the Angular project, which you can check out here: https://github.com/angular/angular
 For more information about GPT-Commit, please visit the repository: https://github.com/ywkim/gpt-commit
 I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts and feedback on these improvements. If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to share!

That is to say, the `Jason.parse()' function in Javascript sometimes will wrongfully parse absolutely legit JSONs passed from the command line, throwing inexplicable errors.
 For example, "#" followed by a white space in a customized tex macro would lead JSON.parse to split the argument into two separate lines; and the `math-preview-mathjax-tex-digits' variable, which is by default defined as "/?:[0-9]+(?:\{,\}[0-9]*)?|\{,\}[0-9]+)/" will cause the inexplicable "Invalid filename…]]></summary>

 I guess this can be overcome by editing the resolver field in my project's stack.yaml. Until now I have had stack.yaml in my .gitignore since stack init generates the file, but maybe it's recommended to add stack.yaml to git repositories?
 Also strange that ghc-9.4.5 (used in lts-21.3) ships with filepath-1.4.2.2. That filepath version was released in 2021 but at the time ghc-9.4.5 was released (2023) System.OsPath was available in the newer filepath packages.
 Another question: Should I be progressive and start using OsPath in my new programs?

 But the blog post goes into detail about those methods and about how we implemented support for them. It may be of interest to JVM aficionados, Scala and Java language mavens, and compiler hackers.

 I've got a piece of code that looks like this:
 bestSolutionScore solutions = maximum scores where solutionsList = M.toList solutions scores = [ evalSolution s1 s1 | s1 <- solutionList , s2 <- solutionList ] evalSolution (k1, v1) (k2, v2) | somePredicate k1 k2 = v1 + v2 | otherwise = 0 
 I should be able to create all of the elements of scores in parallel, and the maximum is a reduce that should be able to be done in parallel too, and consume elements of scores as soon as they're generated.
 But my feeble attempts at using a map ... parList evaluation strategy didn't produce anything other that a lot of stack use.
 Any suggestions on how to spread this task across cores?

 This was first reported with Fedora 37, and I don't know if it's KDE specific or not, but basically graphical emacs is unusable because the frame shrinks every time you interact with the minibuffer. Type M-x, watch your frame shrink. 
 People have suggested things like 
  (setq frame-resize-pixelwise t) ; nope (setq frame-inhibit-implied-resize t) ; nope 
 This does not work. I haven't found a solution yet other than running emacs in terminal mode. However I do have a new piece of data to add.
 When, in an Fedora 38 environment where emacs is broken, I ssh -X to a Fedora 36 environment where emacs is not broken, and run emacs remotely but display it locally on F38, the broken behavior manifests.
 This means it's nothing about emacs 28.2 that is the problem, it's just some interaction with emacs and whatever passes for the X server and window environment. I have yet to find any KDE behavior stuff I can tweak to fix it, and emacs tweaks have been similarly ineffective. SO ... looking for more help if anybody has it. I plead ignorance on X vs Wayland and what would traditionally be emacs in X client interactions.

I have my emacs config files and my org-mode notes synced to my phone via syncthing. Is there anything I can do to make emacs see them and also keep them synced with my other devices? I attempted to make some symlinks with the adb shell, but I have no idea where in the directory tree is the emacs root directory located.

 I suppose adding inline comment (like "# noqa") wouldn't work given it may not be recognized as comments. Otherwise, I would imagine that I need to use some hook to inspect each line and decide to filter in or out before the line being checked.
 I wonder if any standard solution already exists.

 A brief post to announce that Indigo 0.15.0-RC3 has been released, with an all new* axis-aligned physics engine.
 (* Read: Limited, inaccurate, no doubt buggy, but nonetheless rather satisfying...)
 (Please note that the lag in the image below is the gif recording, and doesn't not reflect the true frame rate, which is displayed in the top left.)
 Animation of axis-aligned physics in the Indigo game engine
 There are lots of details in the release notes linked below:
 https://github.com/PurpleKingdomGames/indigo/releases/tag/v0.15.0-RC3
 If you'd like to see a simple game / demo built with it, here's one I made earlier:
  
Code - https://github.com/davesmith00000/pong
 Play - https://davesmith00000.github.io/pong/
  
I hope you try building something with it. Please feel free to report any issues, or come and get help / hang out on our Discord server.
 If any of you have even the slightest passing interest in physics and / or maths ...then you're already more qualified than I am to have built such a thing! Do consider joining in and helping me improve it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Perhaps somebody knows how to fix this.
 I have been having a weird problem, when once in a while, org-ctags gets loaded, and org-ctags-enable gets executed. Once org-ctags-enable gets executed, org-internal tags stop working (org-ctags wants a etags file for _any_ internal link). See https://www.reddit.com/r/orgmode/comments/13p9zog/internal_links_asking_for_tags_table/
 ​
 I don't want that.
 I traced it and here is what I have:
  
help--load-prefixes contains org-ctags (among many others)
 I ask for describe-variable org-reverse-note-order
 org-ctags gets loaded, and org-ctags-enable gets executed
 looking at the source code of org-ctags, it executes (org-ctags-enable) when it gets loaded.
  
How can I remove org-ctags from the help--load-prefixes.
 But perhaps more importantly:
 should autoexecuting org-ctags-enable be considered a bug?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Perhaps a "sinful" act, sometimes we still use vim for quick edits of small files even when we have emacsclient setup. Or it could be as innocent as going to a remote machine that doesn't have Emacs setup. Fear no more, building on top of the work from https://github.com/kentarosasaki/vim-emacs-bindings, I made a few more keybindings available including
 - C-f, C-p, C-n, C-b, C-a, C-e, M-f, M-b
 - C-d, C-k, C-y, C-_
 - M->, M-<
 - M-/
 - (for now)...
 All you need is to copy this to your ~/.vim/plugin/emacs-bindings.vim

 But in evil, it creates a read-only buffer only for the output. Is it something we could emulate closer to vim?

However I want to go further in this direction. Are there more such correspondences other than the usual STLC and dependent type systems? (I've also seen articles on linear types and linear logic) For example what type systems does modal logic correspond to? Are there any survey on this topic? Many thanks!

 I'm using https://docs.doomemacs.org/v21.12/modules/ui/workspaces/ to manage workspaces in emacs
 Say that there is one session, 2 workspaces, each workspace manages one project
 One thing I have noticed is: - On macos, each workspace has its own lsp pid - On linux, the lsp pids are the same on those 2 workspaces
 Do you guys know to fix this issue? Thanks in advance,
 Update: sorry for missing what I expect 🙏
 I expect the behavior on linux should be the same with macos
 The context here is: - Each workspace is a project - The project uses pyls as lsp

 I had org-cdlatex and latex previews working yesterday and kept tinkering my config, but today cdlatex broke. After commenting the new lines in my config, some functionality is missing.
 1.- Pairing of the "$" delimiters doesn't work. If I type both manually and write "fr<tab>" inside it does expand to $\frac{}{}$.
 2.- Writing the quote " ' " doesn't work in text mode. If I type the quote inside a math environment it works almost as expected. Typing $ab'b results in "$a\mathbf{b}" instead of $\mathbf{ab}$. Typing ab'b inside of a manually closed pair $$ still doesn't work. Typing the quote in any normal text doesn't work at all. 
 Doing C-h k ' says that ' is supposed to run org-cdlatex-math-modify. Trying to run manually with M-x after a text that should expand returns "Wrong type argument: commandp, nil", and the Org>LaTeX>Modify math symbol of the menu bar appears greyed out.
 ​
 How should I start to troubleshoot this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've recently migrated from straight.el to elpaca, and unfortunately this broke my hyperbole installation. I originally had hyperbole installed using the guide provided by the manual here---I've largely tried to reproduce this in elpaca but I keep getting the following error when my config tries to load the package (specifically on loading hypb-ert.el):
 Eager macro-expansion failure: (void-variable hyperbole-run-test) 
 I feel that I'm most of the way there, but I'm just missing something basic. What I've done so far:
  
have elpaca clone hyperbole from the source repo ("https://git.savannah.gnu.org/git/hyperbole.git")
 manually symlink the /kotl, /man, and /test folders from the /elpaca/repos/hyperbole directory to the /elpaca/builds/hyperbole directory (elpaca doesn't do this for some reason)
  
Has anyone here gotten this working? I've dug around in the source code and hyperbole-run-test doesn't seem to be mentioned much outside of a defal clause in hypb-ert.el itself. I'd greatly appreciate if anyone here has any insight!

While it initially seemed like a convenient feature, over time, I've come to realize that it's not always the best idea. There have been instances where I made mistakes in a file, such as accidentally removing a large number of lines, and when I clicked on a different window, the result got automatically saved without me noticing. This has led to some unexpected and unwanted changes in my files.
 I'm curious to know if anyone else has had similar experiences. Have you used super-save or any similar functionality, and did it prove to be useful in your case? I'm trying to weigh the benefits and drawbacks before deciding whether to continue using it. I believe that pressing the good old C-x C-s key combination is the best option. What do you think?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Emacs comes with two built-in IRC clients, rcirc and erc. The latter has a history entry in its manual ((info "(erc) History")) and thus sheds a little bit of light on its age:
  
7 History
  
ERC was originally written by Alexander L. Belikoff and Sergey Berezin. They stopped development around December 1999. Their last released version was ERC 2.0.
 ...
 2006
 ERC 5.1 was released. It was subsequently included in Emacs 22.
  
rcirc on the other hand is missing such an entry, but the copyright starts at 2006, roughly around the inclusion of ERC within Emacs. If you searche the Emacs manual for IRC, you end up with two mentions, one within Acknowledgments for ERC, one for "Bug Reference":
  
3. Setup for IRC channels configurable by the variable ‘bug-reference-setup-from-irc-alist’. The built-in IRC clients Rcirc, and ERC, are supported.
  
Nowhere within Emacs do I find a comparison why there are two, and whether there are different use cases for both.
 With that in mind: what are the (architectural?) differences between ERC and rcirc? If ERC already existed, why was rcirc also included in Emacs?
 Thanks in advance!

I always have difficulty when visiting a long-time not visited org file, where it may have lots of headings and their sub-headings, and so on. I need to have an overall grasp of which headings have sub-headings when collapsed and only first-level headings are shown. Since, headings and sub-headings are a lot, so I'm used to only showing first-level headings and opening up a certain heading when I know exactly that it has sub-headings. If I use C-Tab, all second-level sub-headings of first-headings will be shown up, which adds more obstacle for navigating!
 In ideal, sub-headings of their parent heading should also have this symbol in the end of them, if they have their own sub-headings.
 It's gonna be a dream to come into reality, so I can finally, completely move from zim to emacs. Among Gui note-taking programs, zim is the most powerful yet simple that has every feature that I need.
 But the only downside of it is that it relays so much on mouse, instead of providing actions that can completely be done on only keyboard. When working on a laptop, which provides less-comfort for controlling the cursor, this issue has become more serious for me.
 Please, the elisp wizards! help this elisp idiot to get it through, I'm so bad at programming, learning elisp has been so tough to do it, I cannot really figure it out myself, damn :(

 Flake8 and PyFlakes are installed and available on my system.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I use EXWM as my main window manager. I recently bought an X1 Thinkpad 7th Gen, and am having some display problems. When I log in without Xrandr the screen displays fine, but the text / applications are far too small.
 I tried to zoom using Xrandr as follows:
 xrandr --output eDP-1 --primary --mode 2560x1440 --panning 2560x1800 --scale 0.8x0.8 --pos 0x0 --rotate normal --output DP-1 --off --output HDMI-1 --off --output DP-2 --off
 This enlarges the text appropriately, but now much of the screen is now not shown (I can't see the modeline, minibuffer, etc.
 I'm sure there's some obvious solution to this, but the documentation I've read doesn't make it clear what I should do.
 Any ideas?
 Thanks!

 I am using doomemacs with nix-doom-emacs.
 Working on local

 Broken on Remote

 +end_src
 +RESULTS:
 : : command not found ```
 *Org-Babel Error Output*
 It is trying to run zsh /ssh:user@host:/tmp/sh-script-wcS20a instead of just the ./tmp/sh-script-wcS20a.
 text zsh:1: no such file or directory: /ssh:user@host:/tmp/sh-script-wcS20a

 ```
 !/usr/bin/env nix-shell
 !nix-shell /tmp/shell.nix -i bash --pure
 hello ```
 Edit: Shebang scripts are tun like ./foo and not like zsh ./foo. Wen executing this using Tramp /ssh:user@host: it tries to run the script the wrong was.

 I'm currently in the process of trying out (and hopefully embracing) emacs. Coming from a vim past, I'm playing around with doom emacs and was wondering, is there a way to make the vi-style fringe (indicating end-of-file) bold faced in it?
 My apologies if this isn't the right subreddit to ask (please feel free to let me know the right one). Thanks in advance!

  12:19 reproduced problem of ticket-1234  At this point I'd like to open a second capture window and create an entry using another capture-template "Ticket test", where I protocol everything regarding the test I have made for the ticket.
 I am not sure I am doing this in the right order.
 Maybe starting with the capture of the ticket testing, but in this case, how to get an automatic entry in the dailies without having to capture manually a new dailies entry?
 Thanks for your insights!

work on a file;
 want to see the commit history of the file;
 call magit-file-dispatch then press l;
 jump into one of the commits;
 end up in a magit-revision buffer showing only the changes of the file.
  
All went well. But now I want to see other changes in the commit. What's the best way to do that? Currently I just copy the commit hash and do a git show in terminal. It's not very convenient.
 Thanks.

How do you set the Treemacs face? Using describe face, there are lots of different ones and I would like to make them all the same, a non-monospace font. They seem to inherit directly from the default font, so I am not changing that.
 
I have been playing with layouts and, no matter what I do (spc-l-l or spc-p-l), all the layouts still seem to include files from the other layouts when i do c-x,c-b or spc-b-b. What am I missing? 
 
One more - how do I force things to always appear on the same window? I want magit to always replace my main code editor and nothing else, and all vterms to always to appear at the bottom, like in VSCode.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I edit markdown, i usually set Emacs to word wrap mode (visual line).
 I would prefer the following: If I press END, point moves to the end of the screen line. That already works because of visual-line-mode. If cursor is already at the end of the screen line, point should move to the end of the physical line.
 Pos1 should behave likewise, with an additional twist: If point is at the beginning of a screen line but not at the beginning of the physical line, it moves to the beginning of the physical line. If I additionally press pos1 and the beginning of the physical line is a blank character (character class), it moves to the first non-blank character of the line. Another Pos1 again toggles jumping to the first physical character in the line.
 I am sure this can be configured - as pretty much everything in Emacs. There likely is even a package for that?

Special care for tooling is required for a monorepo to stay performant as a team grows.

  (setopt elisp-flymake-byte-compile-load-path load-path) 
 Given the following code:
  (require 'consult) (global-set-key (kbd "C-c M-x") #'consult-mode-command) 
 There's no warning, since i require'd the consult feature. The package will eagerly load as that line is evaluated (or before).
 However, given this other piece of code:
  (global-set-key (kbd "C-.") #'embark-act) (global-set-key (kbd "M-.") #'embark-dwim) (global-set-key (kbd "C-h B") #'embark-bindings) 
 I get the following warnings:
  warning e-f-b-c the function ‘embark-act’ might not be defined at runtime. warning e-f-b-c the function ‘embark-dwim’ might not be defined at runtime. warning e-f-b-c the function ‘embark-bindings’ might not be defined at runtime. 
 That's because I didn't require'd the embark feature. At runtime that's not an issue since the three functions are autoloaded.
 It seems a waste for me to suppress warnings. On the other hand, one could define declare the functions before using them (or use some comfy macros like use-package and bind-keys). My question is the following: isn't there some way for the byte compiler to detect all autoloaded packages, either in the load-path or in a specific feature?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today, 2023-07-12, at 1830 UTC (11:30 am PDT, 2:30 pm EDT, 7:30 pm BST, 20:30 CEST, …) we are streaming the seventh episode of the Haskell Unfolder live on YouTube:
 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Y--K5Vjlyo&list=PLD8gywOEY4HaG5VSrKVnHxCptlJv2GAn7&index=7
 In this episode, we discuss how Booleans convey little information about the outcome of a test, and how replacing Booleans by other datatypes that produce a witness of the success or failure of a test can lead to more robust and therefore better code. This idea is known under many other names, such as "Boolean blindness" or "Parse don't validate".
 Most of the examples in this episode should be understandable to newcomers.
 The Haskell Unfolder is a YouTube series about all things Haskell hosted by Edsko de Vries and Andres Löh, with episodes appearing approximately every two weeks.
 We also have a GitHub repository with the code samples from the episodes:
 https://github.com/well-typed/unfolder
 And we have a public Google calendar listing the planned schedule:

 I have tried, but either i have found stuff which is too theoritical, or just debating why macros are not evil or obsolete stuff.
 Is there anything which is new and to-the-point? More code and example driven but step by step?
 There was a similar question asked 7 years ago. Because there has passed by so much time, I'd like to see what kind of resources have been developed.

  (use-package transcribe :custom (a-custom-variable "Hello!")) 
 I'll have use-package-expand-minimally set to t. Having it set to nil will just add additional code that it's not relevant for the question.
 Let's see how the macro expands (with pp-macroexpand-expression):
  (progn (let ((custom--inhibit-theme-enable nil)) (unless (memq 'use-package custom-known-themes) (deftheme use-package) (enable-theme 'use-package) 
 Why is the custom variable set this way? This looks more complex than how it should be, but I'm sure there is a clear reason behind it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been a happy denote user for the last year, but with the launch of Bear 2, I decided to look at the app again. What I realized I missed was an over-arching system for organization. In Bear I can see all my tags and sub-tags in a sidebar and I can move one sub-tag to another tag group, rename, etc. I just felt like I had a little more control over my notes. Denote does have keywords, and if there was a way to nest keywords and also show all keywords in a sidebar, denote would be perfect.
 Is there any package that does this? Either on top of denote or some other standalone package that works with org-mode file? I know org-mode has nested tags, but I don't want a predefined tag list, I'd like it to change organically and on the fly and going the org-mode nested tag route doesn't really work for me.

 I only have one keyboard macro in my configuration: I often read papers from arXiv.org inside Emacs using pdf-tools, and for those I want to set the margins from the bounding box on the second page (since the first page has a bulky watermark), so I use a keyboard macro to go to the next page, set the margins from the bounding box and go back to the page I was on.
 I made this post because I just realized that I often give people the advice to give a key binding to a keyboard macro and put that in their configuration, but don't often follow that advice myself. (It usually goes like this: someone complains, that something is too many keystrokes, and I say, "this is Emacs, no-one can force you to use more than one keystroke for anything!", and proceed to explain keyboard macros).

 The image I made for our group presentation
 So for a university project, we had to choose a language that isn't that popular, our group chose Scala. In general, I think it is great (I enjoy more the scala2 syntax) but documentation is kind of lacking, and native libraries are all over the place. Having to deal with sbt was a thing and making intellij lint, compile and run was an experience. My last complaint is that I had to create my own dockerfile which I am really bad at, like it was really hard to find anything for Scala. 
 Despite that I really enjoy working with Scala as a Java developer, probably will never get a job on it because I dislike data science and at least where I live there is like 0 demand. I am thinking of doing comparable projects in C# and Kotlin to see how they compare to Java and Scala. Hopefully, Scala will regain some popularity but for that, they will probably need a big company behind it, improve documentation, and better native libraries. 
 The last thing, this is my opinion and I am dumb as a rock so you have all the right to criticize my incoherent bag of words and correct me if I am wrong

        <updated>2023-07-11T19:26:35.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have defined an org capture template that includes:
  (file "~/templates/hotdog.txt") 
 and the contents of "~/templates/hotdog.txt" is:
 * Hot Dog Prompt: %^{HOT_SAUCE|yes|no} %(format "Hot Sauce? %s" "%\\1") %(format "%s" (if (string-equal "%\\1" "yes") "Sign waiver" "Enjoy")) 
 When I run the capture template, before I enter the value of HOT_SAUCE, the preview looks like this:
 * Hot Dog Prompt: Hot Sauce? %\1 Enjoy 
 This tells me that the value of "%\\1" at this point is %\1. I'm under the impression that string-equal is comparing "yes" and "%\\1" and thus evaluating to "Enjoy".
 Yes case: If I type in yes at the HOT_SAUCE prompt and press ENTER, the preview changes to:
 ***** Hot Dog Prompt: yes Hot Sauce? yes Enjoy 
 No case: If I type in no at the HOT_SAUCE prompt and press ENTER, the preview changes to:
 ***** Hot Dog Prompt: no Hot Sauce? no Enjoy 
 In both cases the first format function is re-evaluated with the value entered at the prompt.
 In neither case is the second format function re-evaluated.
 According to the documentation on %(EXP):
  
Only placeholders pre-existing within the template, or introduced with ‘%[file]’, are expanded this way. Since this happens after expanding non-interactive “%-escapes”, those can be used to fill the expression.
  
I'm not really sure how to interpret this.
 Question: How can I get the second format function to re-evaluate after I've supplied the HOT_SAUCE value so that it says "Sign Waiver" if I enter yes at the prompt?
 Goal: My goal for my capture template to return significantly different text based on the value of prompt values.
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently upstreamed some fixes to a project called helm-ls which is a language server for Helm to make it work with eglot. As part of my contribution, they asked for instructions for use with emacs, which I provided in the README.
 The only problem I have with the instructions I gave is that it feels counterintuitive a little bit? The root of the problem is that, while you could edit Helm charts with yaml-mode, adding eglot-ensure to the yaml-mode hook would mean adding (yaml-mode "helm_ls" "server") to eglot-server-programs, and you probably don't want helm-ls for yaml files that aren't helm charts. Hence my instructions to create a small derived major mode to sidestep the issue.
 That works okay, but means that it becomes hard to automatically enter the newly derived helm-mode. I've read through how emacs chooses major modes, but I couldn't think of a good way to automatically select helm-mode. Ideally, I'd love to have some way of telling auto-mode-alist to traverse up the current buffer's directory until it found files like Chart.yaml and values.yaml that told it the file was actually a Helm chart rather than plain yaml, but it looks like I may be limited to just regex matching the file name, using .dir-locals.el or -*- mode: helm -*- magic.
 Any other ideas/options to make this better?

[…] what is the status of dynamic linking on Windows currently? The GHC User’s Guide suggests that it should be fairly simple to accomplish. But the relevant GHC Wiki article says there are problems with the ordinal value getting too large when the DLL has too many symbols. Normally I’d discount a 4-year-old article in favour of the current user’s guide… except that when I tried compiling to a DLL, I did indeed get an error message saying that the ordinals were too large. On Linux, each package is compiled to a separate .so file, which keeps them fairly small, but when I try the same GHC options on Windows, it just complains that there are no 'dyn' versions of the dependencies. Which would seem to indicate that it would work if I could compile the dependencies dynamically, but I can’t find any information on how to do so. This whole situation is quite confusing, and I would greatly appreciate some clarification on GHC’s support for compiling shared libraries on Windows.

 So I'm going to use
 (setq sentence-end-double-space t) 
 now on. This is the default anyway and Emacs works great with it. Thanks for all the comments in that thread. The wisdom of experienced Emacs hackers on that thread enlightened me to the benefits of double-spacing for sentences. Collected a list of threads about sentence spacing:
  
The drawbacks of using single space between sentences - August 2021 (28 comments)
 PSA: sentence-end-double-space - October 2021 (59 comments)
 Sentences - July 2023 (55 comments)
 What do you all think about (setq sentence-end-double-space nil)? - July 2023 (63 comments)
  
Some questions still bothering me. Please help me resolve this.
  
For all the double-spacers out here, what do you do when you have to work on someone else's project which uses single-spacing between sentences? Do you have any shortcuts or tricks to switch to single-spacing mode when you are working on their projects?
 
How do you space sentences within double quotes, like:
 Bob said, "I get three apples. You get two apples. Ok?" Jess responded, "No, I get three apples. You get two apples." Bob was not amused. Jess took out his bag, getting ready to collect apples. 
 Does double spacing seem fine here? Do you think the sentence-end spaces within double-quotes need to be single space?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was watching Ben Awad's video about writing FizzBuzz with Haskell and Vim, and that got me thinking about how I would actually do it. I was inspired by a Rust solution that I saw one time.
 In this solution, I'm particularly happy about the function mapM_. If you don't know about it, it just maps a monadic action over a Foldable. There is also a mapM which returns the foldable type containing the result of each computation, but in this case we use the underscore version since we're only concerned with the side-effects of putStrLn.
 Sometimes it's boring to sit for hours and sift through the docs to find functions like mapM_, so I think these kinds of concrete examples are really nice for people who are just getting comfortable with Haskell.
 Upvote if you learned something!
 ```haskell fizzBuzz :: Int -> String fizzBuzz n = case (mod n 3, mod n 5) of (0, 0) -> "FizzBuzz" (0, ) -> "Fizz" (, 0) -> "Buzz" (_, _) -> show n
 main :: IO () main = mapM_ (putStrLn . fizzBuzz) [1..100] ```

 I know Scala has it, and I'm trying to replicate it in Kotlin.
 Scenario
 ```scala sealed trait Key[K]
 object Key{ object Text extends Key[String] object Num extends Key[Int] }
 def getValue[V](key:Key[V]):Option[V] = key match { case Key.Text => /* Here V is known to be String / Some("Hello world") case Key.Num => / Here V is known to be Int */ Some(42) }
 ```
 in the branches of code inside the match expression, V can be narrowed due to the nature of Key.
 How's that feature called?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have the odd situation that when I open a .gpg file, I get prompted for the passphrase, but when I try to save this, I don't get a prompt, but Emacs hangs. gpg gets started though:
 ```
 /usr/local/bin/gpg --no-tty --status-fd 1 --yes --enable-progress-filter --command-fd 0 --output /var/folders/x_/10k090mn18n0lpgvs1h_8l3jn84281/T/epg-outputJpLx7A --pinentry-mode loopback --encrypt -r E2B250F222A9E987
 `` But it doesn't cause a prompt in Emacs (or I don't see it). Emacs hangs at this point. If I kill gpgkillall gpg`, Emacs returns control to me. I get this popup:
 ```
 Error while encrypting with "/usr/local/bin/gpg":
 gpg: signal Terminated caught ... exiting
 ```
 This is on a Mac (on a Ubuntu system everything works). This is Emacs 28.2
 Does anyone have any pointers? Just looks like something upon saving interferes perhaps??
 ~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf:
 ``` allow-loopback-pinentry
 allow-emacs-pinentry
 default-cache-ttl 86400
 max-cache-ttl 86400
 pinentry-program /usr/local/bin/pinentry-tty
 ```
 ~/.gnupg/gpg.conf:
 ```
 pinentry-mode loopback
 ```
 init.el:
 ```
 (use-package epg
 :config
 (setq epg-pinentry-mode 'loopback)
 )
 ```
 Obviously the prompt works, that's not the issue. It's an issue when saving.

 I'm just trying to insert a task that won't "break" the existing headline:

I have the base methods with make, send, receive, status methods and select allowing receive from multiple channels would be awesome but I'm not too keen into ZIO's collectFirst or raceAll or something else that would help me on this.
 Would you contribute to it by looking here: https://github.com/carlosedp/zio-channel/pull/3 ?
 I've even added some test cases to the draft PR. Also suggestions to the rest of the lib API are very welcome!

 Po Lu (one of the very active Emacs maintainers) had filed a bug to the webkit team about this, but the progress is blocked by unable to produce logs for the error. If anyone is familiar with those graphics libraries, please consider joining the discussion of the bug and even better to help providing the logs. Or providing some guideline for testing in the comment and I'm very willing to run the test. Thanks.
 PS: This feature will not only benefit webkit, but also EWW/shr since it can be configed to use webkit for rendering media by setting shr-use-xwidgets-for-media. Lars had also talked about this in his blogs

 This is my first sentence. This is my second sentence. I know some languages, e.g., English, Spanish, French. LA has canals. LA is in the most populous US state. 
 So when I write text like above following current style guides I don't get any issue. M-e always goes from one sentence to another like so (sentence jump points marked with %).

 Emacs never get confused with abbreviations in this style. So what is the problem? Why is

 so much discouraged in Emacs even while writing per new style guides? What am I missing?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, I'm hoping to pick the collective brains of all you fine redditors.
 I write creatively for fun and self therapy, and my exploration of editors under windows showed they tended to be quite slow. I've got my eldest kids' old-ish laptop with a lightweight distro on it that can be chucked in a bag and taken with me wherever I go (I can do backups to my own cloud storage via phone hotspot). 
 I want my writing to be plain text and usable no matter what software I might choose to use on another device. I had thought of using one of the many markdown editors out there, but they don't appear to agree on very much beyond bold/italic/underline.
 I'm here for a speedy way of working without having to use a mouse very often that runs efficiently on that laptop. I don't think I need the lisp knowledge just to use emacs as an editor, and I've really got no interest in learning that language because my head is already stuffed to the gunwhales with python and bash knowledge (both serve my purposes adequately at the moment, so I don't need another language).
 So my question really is: Why emacs, and not a different editor that also has very quick keyboard shortcuts? I'm not saying a vi derivative is better or worse, in fact I'm not saying anything else is better or worse; I'm just after knowledge. I just want to know why emacs and not something else, especially given that I've got no interest in the LISP side of things.
 If emacs is superior to insert-whatever-editor in a particular way, I'd really appreciate thoughts on why that is, and what the other software does worse than emacs.
 Thank you for your time reading, and for any answers you choose to give.

  (defun tvd-emms-follow-playing-song() (interactive) (save-restriction (when emms-playlist-selected-marker (goto-char emms-playlist-selected-marker)))) (add-hook 'emms-playlist-selection-changed-hook 'tvd-emms-follow-playing-song 1) 
 However, this doesn't work, point is not moved when a new song starts to play. When I execute the function manually, it works( I added a couple of print statements to the function, which are being executed every time the song changes). So, it's actually being executed by the hook, but the goto-char part doesn't have any effect.
 Does anyone have an idea what might be wrong here?

 I have no prior knowledge about CSS. I would like to modify this template and have it match my employer's company Look and Feel for documents (fonts, page layouts including footnotes, footers...).
 Question: where can I find newbee compatible doc about what works with org/css/htmlize and what does not. I probably search with the wrong terms since I always get links to css frameworks (Tailwind, bulma...).
 What I do miss is - how to add a background to the first page of the pdf - how to add a different one to the other pages - how to add author's information (name, company, copyright...) on a last page...
 ... all this based on the headers or properties of my org document.
 Reading the file htmlize.el did not help.
 Can you please help me or point me in the right direction?
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When using org-roam-capture or org-roam-node-find and entering a name into the minibuffer that does not already exist as an org-roam node, a capture buffer pops up in the previously selected window. If another window exists, the buffer that was originally where the capture buffer now is is moved to the other window, and the buffer originally occupying the other window is buried. How can I prevent the behavior of burying the buffer in the other window.
 For clarity, currently what happens when a capture buffer is pulled up is as follows (assume the selected-window initially is the one with B2 occupying it):
 Original Window Arrangement
 ----------------------------------- |----------------|----------------| |----------------|----------------| |------B1--------|-------B2-------| |----------------|----------------| |----------------|----------------| |----------------|----------------| ----------------------------------- 
 After capture buffer pops up
 ----------------------------------- |----------------|----------------| |----------------|----------------| |------B2--------|-----CAPTURE----| |----------------|----------------| |----------------|----------------| |----------------|----------------| ----------------------------------- 
 Here's what I would like to see after the capture buffer pops up:
 ----------------------------------- |----------------|----------------| |----------------|----------------| |------B1--------|-----CAPTURE----| |----------------|----------------| |----------------|----------------| |----------------|----------------| ----------------------------------- 
 In other words, I only want the capture buffer to pop up in the selected-window, and I want the rest of my window arrangement left alone. How can I accomplish this?
 This behavior persists even if I make the window B1 occupies dedicated. I'm not sure if that's relevant to the problem or not, but I'm curious as to why that happens.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey, ya'll.
 So, I've been an Emacs user for about 5 years now, and have been rocking Spacemacs so far. I love it. It be Emacs. But also Spacemacs. But! Whenever I've wanted to make customizations to Spacemacs, the whole layering system is so abstracted from standard Emacs stuff that it was often difficult to figure things out in regards to online sources often using vanilla Emacs for their instructions. But I made do, eventually figuring things out as best I could.
 Recently, I've been learning CLisp (and plan on learning Clojure as well), and I've wanted to start taking advantage of the true power of the dark side of the Force Emacs, which is, creating an editor that's very much specifically tailored to you, because as I want to do certain things, I definitely feel the edges of Spacemacs pushing back.
 For the past few weekends, I've been following along with Emacs from Scratch from System Crafters, looking at some of Prot's stuff, reading the manual where needed, copiously using `describe-function/variable/etc`, reading a bunch of configs that I've found that people have mentioned as being inspirations for them. Things are moving along mostly smoothly and I'm making really great progress and it feels really fantastic to start slowly tailoring things to how I want them....
 ... but then I look at the setup for, say, Clojure, in something like DoomEmacs or Spacemacs or some Emacs expert's config, and I start to feel a bit overwhelmed because, here's a thing that an entire community has worked on to optimize and hack away at and improve and I'm just barely scratching the surface. And as much as I'm really enjoying the journey of customizing GNU Emacs, I'm also a very practical dev and really recognize the benefits of a distro.
 And in moments like these, I kinda just retreat back into Spacemacs because, damn girl, so much work has been done on it!
 Any sage advice on how to tackle this whole process better?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is about week 8's assignment on IO. (https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis1940/spring13/hw/08-IO.pdf)
 But my question is more related to the algorithm. 
 Basically, as I understand it, the problem boils down to basically doing DP on trees. We need to select some nodes from the tree that maximizes a sum based on the condition that if we select a node, then its parent cannot be selected (based on "whose immediate boss is also at the party will not have any fun at all"). Thus, I take it that immediate means direct parent only right? 
 To help you out, here's a tree diagram. The green checkmark represents nodes that are selected. Bob is selected despite being grandparent to John and Sue, and it's perfectly fine right?

 The reason I ask this is when I was comparing my solution (https://github.com/aditya211935/CIS-194/blob/main/week-8/Party.hs#L32) with other solutions (https://github.com/OctaviPascual/cis194-IntroductionToHaskell/blob/master/homework-08/Party.hs#L83), almost all of them in the case where we don't take current element, don't take max of both values of the subtree, but only take the second value. 
 I checked a lot of other solutions and all of them have some bug or the other, so I'm unable to verify my solution. Would really appreciate any help in verifying my solution. For context, my solution on parsing "company.txt" produced "33200".

Again, this is a terrible hack, you probably shouldn't use it, you may not even want to look at it, I rarely use python, but it was able to do what I needed in OSX, so here we are. I also don't know much about OSX specifc stuff and mostly treat it as *nix.
I run this as a daemon, and get a file on a ramdisk (thanks to Christian for pointing out this probably shouldn't be on disk, especially since /tmp is not a ramdisk on OSX AFAICT).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If I define a class with EIEIO, then define a subclass which inherits from it, I would expect the type predicate for the superclass (automatically defined by EIEIO) to return t for instances of the subclass as well, but it doesn't. A simple example:
 (require 'eieio) ;;; Define the superclass (defclass super () (a)) ;;; Define the subclass (defclass sub (super) nil) ;;; Create an instance of the subclass (defvar my-instance (sub)) ;; `t' as expected (sub-p my-instance) ;; t ;; I would expect to get `t', but get `nil' instead (super-p my-instance) ;; nil 
 Questions: - Is this the expected behaviour? (or is something going wrong) - Why is the behaviour occuring? - How can I get the behaviour I expected?
 TIA!

 I included the CC in the ./configure line, like so: CC=gcc-12. The reason I'm asking this question is because I've noticed that some people use a separate export CC="gcc-12" command.

 Does anyone know if that is possible with rust-analyzer?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bufferbin provies a "Treemacs"-like experience for buffers. It is unique from other packages in that:
 1) It is contained in a sidebar (versus traditional window), making its location deterministic (and customizable) whenever toggled.
 2) It allows the user to specify which window to use and prevents "random" windows from getting overwritten.
 I hope others find it helpful!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello Haskell enthusiasts!
 I'm new to Haskell and eager to dive into the language. Initially, I followed the instructions on haskell.org to set up my Haskell environment (GHC, GHcup, Stack, Cabal) and used VS Code as my editor. However, I encountered several issues along the way and decided to start fresh.
 I came across an older post recommending this guide (https://www.fpcomplete.com/haskell/get-started/) for setting up Haskell. Is this guide still relevant and recommended for beginners?
 Additionally, I'd appreciate advice on choosing the right editor for Haskell development. Which editor or IDE would you recommend for a beginner like me?
 Thank you in advance for your insights and recommendations!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In some distributed protocols, servers (actors) transition between different roles at different times, and accept different subset of messages depending on the role.
 Ideally, an actor should always hold a reference to another actor typed in such a way that it is impossible for it to send the wrong type of message (i.e., a message that the other cannot accept because it is in the wrong role).
 The inherent problem is that, like I said, an actor can change role over time, and so the subset of messages it accepts; thus, all other actors holding a reference to it would actually start to hold a wrongly typed reference.
 Specifically, I am thinking to Raft consensus algorithm, where (for example) a server in follower state would not accept an AppendEntriesResponse message, but it is going to be able to accept it as soon as it transitions to leader state. If the behaviors are parametrized with a Raft type that comprises all messages (including AppendEntriesResponse), then it is easy to wrongfully send an AppendEntries to a follower.
 Does Akka have a pattern for this?
 Does this pattern also apply to actors running in clusters? Does it apply to both types of communication (ask, tell)?
 I know that it is possible for an actor to explicitly ignore some messages, but I believe it can become a bit cumbersome and perhaps prone to errors. Moreover, it does not eliminate the issue that I described above.

        <updated>2023-07-08T20:02:14.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone,
 We are very excited to announce Copilot 3.16 [2]. Copilot is a stream-based EDSL in Haskell for writing and monitoring embedded C programs, with an emphasis on correctness and hard realtime requirements. Copilot is typically used as a high-level runtime verification framework, and supports temporal logic (LTL, PTLTL and MTL), clocks and voting algorithms.
 Copilot has been used at NASA in drone test flights. Through the NASA tool Ogma [1] (also written in Haskell), Copilot also serves as a runtime monitoring backend for NASA's Core Flight System, Robot Operating System (ROS2), and FPrime (the software framework used in the Mars Helicopter) applications.
 This new version provides comprehensive tests for the C99 backend, and introduces a breaking change in the definition of the type Arg in copilot-language. For details, see [2]. The new version is already available on Hackage [4].
 As always, we're releasing exactly 2 months since the last release. Our next release is scheduled for Sep 7th, 2023.
 We are also extremely excited to announce that Copilot has received full approval for release as NASA Class D open-source software. Current emphasis is on increasing test coverage for the two remaining libraries without tests (copilot-language and copilot-theorem), removing unnecessary dependencies, hiding internal definitions, and formatting the code to meet our new coding standards. Users are encouraged to participate by opening issues and asking questions via our github repo [3].
 There have been many updates on the Copilot front in the last few months. We'll be able to announce more soon. Stay tuned. Happy Haskelling!
 Ivan

 Every few months I check the NEWS file for the master branch of Emacs to keep up with anything that'll be useful to me. This time around, I discovered a built-in way to have a right-aligned modeline! (Added April 1, 2023.)
  
Modeline elements can now be right-aligned. Anything following the symbol 'mode-line-format-right-align' in 'mode-line-format' will be right-aligned. Exactly where it is right-aligned to is controlled by the new user option 'mode-line-right-align-edge'.
  
Put simply, all modeline elements following mode-line-format-right-align are right-aligned (according to the mode-line-right-align-edge setting). My modeline looks like this:

 ) ```
 here. It does what I like, which is that pressing c will create a new file in dired mode, but what I don't like is that it's by default named untitled.txt. For example, if I press c in dired with this inside ~/.emacs.d I get Create file: ~/.emacs.d/untitled.text, but what I want is Create file: ~/.emacs.d/ so I can pick the name myself. How can I accomplish this?
 I tried editing the code myself but it didn't work as I expected. I'm not very familiar with Elisp.

 The problem is that id is totally useless not only because I refer to the main heading (so domain/otherfile.html is equivalent) but also the html file does not contain any div with that ID, so even when I refer to a subheading instead of the file, the ID does not work. 
 Is there anyway to change this behaviour? I expect it to link to the file only (without ID), however, when a subheading is refered to instead of the main heading itself, then a working id should present.

 Haskell seems to have the opposite problem: too many frameworks and options! Could someone suggest a roadmap of interesting frameworks/libraries which manage the complexity of modern web services with novel (compared to Go) paradigms?
 Starting with "Learn you a Haskell" seems good. But afterwards? I've seen books like "Production Haskell", interesting examples by James Carlson, frameworks like Mu, Servant, Legion, (although Haskellers seem to shun frameworks like Gophers). I'm looking for the most "different" or "paradigm shifting" option to get me out of my comfort zone.

  position: 4297 of 5814 (74%), column: 3 character: ﻿ (displayed as ﻿) (codepoint 65279, #o177377, #xfeff) charset: unicode (Unicode (ISO10646)) code point in charset: 0xFEFF script: arabic syntax: w which means: word to input: type "C-x 8 RET feff" or "C-x 8 RET ZERO WIDTH NO-BREAK SPACE" buffer code: #xEF #xBB #xBF file code: #xEF #xBB #xBF (encoded by coding system utf-8-unix) display: by this font (glyph code): mac-ct:-*-Arial-regular-normal-normal-*-13-*-*-*-p-0-iso10646-1 (#xBD9) 
 Consequently, spell-checkers see words with a no-break space after them as being misspelled.
 Maybe related too: if I have something like ~foo~---bar in org-mode, foo is correctly fontified as code. But if I use an em-dash like ~foo~—bar then foo is not fontified correctly. Is there some way to tell org-mode that — should be treated like a dash?

 However, this works:  % emacs --daemon ‘epa-file’ already enabled Starting Emacs daemon. Restarting server $ emacsclient --create-frame --alternate-editor='' Waiting for Emacs...  and it works great, and it lets me even remove (server-start). My question is: what is going on, and do I need to fix anything? I've found that I can even remove (server-start) from my init.el at that point and it still works. Also, what does the epa-file mean?
 The weird part is I can't even find the emacs --daemon when I use the ps -e command and I'm worried I have a few running around due to the server-start and not finding the socket.

 I've tried using mouse-set-region and mouse-drag-region but I cannot make it work (and I don't think they are intended for something like that).
 Maybe I should define a function that does set-mark (or cua-set-mark since I'm using CUA) at the point and then does mouse-set-point? Even if this is the answer I don't know how...

 I am using emacs explicitly inside a terminal (-nw). Do you have any modeline packages that don't look terrible? I tried installing doom-modeline but there was no icon support (even after installing nerd-icons). Any suggestions are appreciated!
 Update: Figured it out. 1) As suggested by u/spudlgo I used use-package to install doom-modeline and run nerd-icons-install-font in emacs. This downloaded NFM.ttf in .local/share/fonts 2) Run fc-cashe -fv to update font cashe and then fc-list | grep .local/fonts . This makes a list of all the fonts in the directory. One needs to note down the name of desired font. 3) I opened dconf editor and searched for 'fonts' under terminal folder. The terminal profiles are going to pop up. I copied the name of the font I wanted to the 'font' bar. 4) change the terminal profiles and it's done.
 Note that the changes need to be done in the local machine. I tested it after using ssh to connect to the server and icons appear as intended.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I am new to the eamcs and orgmode in general but i know that you can extend link types. But i don't know enough to implement it myself. 
 Does anybody have a script that uses id's for linking between two files and after id use an internal link.
 For example
  [[id:b7b07a14-5dbb-48ed-9d9d-70df49e83231:a heading][Heading]] 
 Here a heading won't work because its not supported method by default. 
 If anybody has a script that works on these type of links please share it with me.

 Here’s getting started with Haskell using devenv.sh:
  
Pick from a wide range of GHC versions.
 Get stack/cabal as part of the dev environment.
 Get Haskell Language Server for the chosen GHC.
 Enable any linters/formatters as part of the hooks.
 mac/arm, mac/intel, linux/arm, linux/intel.
  
$ devenv shell

 In the near future we plan to create nixpkgs-haskell, in similar style of nixpkgs-python, to expose all GHC minor versions released in the last years.

 I've tried using the alist that it may have but I get returned a bug saying it's void:  (add-to-list 'rectangle-mark-mode-alist '("M-, ;" . yank-rectangle) )  Though the hook works just fine as well as define-key for unbinding keys in the minor mode.  (defun rect-util-unbind() (define-key rectangle-mark-mode-map (kbd "C-o") nil) ;; open-rectangle (define-key rectangle-mark-mode-map (kbd "C-t") nil) ;; string-rectangle )   (add-hook 'rectangle-mark-mode-hook 'rect-util-unbind )  I checked out the Emacs manual for minor mode alist but I wasn't able to really follow. I also did some searching around but there wasn't much helpful information relating to this problem that I could find. Does rectangle-mark-mode even have an alist? Am I able to make one if it doesn't exist (would like to try this out for any other modes where I may have to do this or something)?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm building Emacs for myself, and I'm trying to figure out if I should build it with ImageMagick or not. I understand that as of Emacs 27, it's no longer used by default in favor of some built-in image manipulation routines. I also understand that historically ImageMagick has been prone to various security vulnerabilities which has been a headache for Emacs users and maintainers.
 I'm not worried about future security vulnerabilities, what I'm interested in is powerful functionality, which I know that ImageMagick is known for. For those of you who build your own Emacs binaries, do you build it with ImageMagick? What's your use-case and reasoning for doing so, or for not doing so?
 Interested in hearing any thoughts about ImageMagic in Emacs, legacy, history, the good, the bad, etc.

 Does anyone know an elisp function that converts either HTML or shr-dom structure to a table.el table? I can probably try to write my own, but having to deal with all those spans makes me feel it'll be a bit tricky. I bet someone already solved that problem.

 To that end, I wrote the package env-commander.el to help with setting up environments for shell commands. To quote the readme:
  
env-commander-mode is a simple mode which allows any shell commands that Emacs invokes to run one or more commands beforehand to initialize the shell environment. There are many Emacs packages which can configure process environments, for example, direnv, but they lack the ability to go a step further and define shell functions and aliases, which is often required by "virtual environment" tools. For those who prefer interacting with shell commands via shell-command rather than shell, eshell, or term, env-commander-mode is here to assist.
  
If you are a fellow shell-command enjoyer, you may also be interested in shell-command-x.el which I posted about recently.

 I've been trying to set it up in a way that is comfortable for me, but as with many things on Emacs, it is easy to get overwhelmed.
  
Bindings: you can choose to have a dedicated keybindings (By default M-TAB or C-M-i on the common major modes) or set tab-always-indent to 'complete in order to make TAB have a double function: either complete or indent if there's nothing to complete.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 lately when I am coding I get annoyedd by the autocompletion popping up. Mostly it is just visual noise and it essentially does not interfere with typing, but combined with copilot it just becomes a noisy kindergarten. I was wondering if there are others out there with similar concerns and how you would tackle this ? 
 I have rebound my tab to company-completion for while, but I found it to be a bit uneven, for instance you´'d get nothing if no completion was found, making you doubt if it was working at all. Also, since then I have moved to vertico and from what I gather its completion trigger is organised differently and it also does not solve my copilot issue. 
 The reason for this post is that all info on completion is about automating all the tings and shower you with info while doing the dev, b/c we want to be vscode so much. 
 Instead I was looking for some inspiration regarding a different paradigm, an on-demand approach with the option to get more info on the class/function/type, or in the case of copilot, a snippet.
 thx.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm using eglot + pylsp to edit Python files. Most of the time it works fine, but occasionally (frequently enough to be very annoying, but infrequently enough to be hard to reproduce!) it seems to get "out of sync", and I get a bunch of random errors that don't match the file I'm editing.
 For example, I'm currently editing a file that has no genuine errors or problems, but flymake-show-buffer-diagnostic reports 1 error ["unmatched ')'"] and 30 warnings (indentation errors, "unexpected spaces around keyword", etc.).
 Saving the file makes no difference.
 C-x C-v reloads the file and the errors disappear. Running eglot-reconnect also fixes the errors.
 eglots-events-buffer is a bit hard to interpret but it looks like at least some of the spurious errors are being received from pylsp.
 I don't know how to track down this problem as I don't know which component has the problem. Presuambly it's not flymake, but is Eglot sending the wrong file data? pylsp reporting the wrong thing? Some kind of JSON RPC issue? Something else I'm missing?
 Any tips on how to track down the issue?
 My eglot config is minimal:
 ```
 (use-package eglot
 :ensure t
 :defer t
 :hook (python-mode . eglot-ensure)
 :bind (("C-c r" . eglot-rename)
 ("C-c C-r" . eglot-rename))) ```
 I'm running
 emacs 28.1 (same problem occurs with 29)
 pylsp v1.7.4

 I'm using emacs as a systemd service (as described in https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/EmacsAsDaemon#h5o-2), with the emacs.service file that comes with the emacs sources. All was working well in debian 11, but since I upgraded to the new stable the graphical emacsclient isn't able to connect to the daemon, I suspect because the daemon is started before gnome session. If I restart the systemd service it works, but not the first time I log in into gnome.
 I see that there is a solution to this (or similar) problem for KDE users in https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/EmacsAsDaemon#h5o-17 but my tentatives to replicate it for gnome were not succesful.
 Anyone knows how to fix this?

Basically, you instruct ChatGPT to "Proofread the following text" and can accept/decline the suggested changes. Any idea on how one could do this in Emacs? In particular, the part where the diff of two texts is created, and an interactive editing of the resulting changes is possible. The creation of the improved texts can simply be done using any of the LLM APIs.

 Do you have any idea which compilation flag I might have missed that could include the libxml2 library?

 I am using Spacemacs and I am struggling with a couple of things:
  
Perspectives. In theory, I should be able to open a new window (frame, I knwo) with a brand new perspective but I can't find the option for that. My Google-fu is failing me on this. If not, I am happy just being able to open a new blank perspective on the same Window and assigning it a shortcut. I can then use perspective switching to move between them.
 
I don't seem to be able to install multi-vterm. If I do package-install, it does not appear to be available. I like having multiple terminals and would like them all inside of Emacs. What am I missing? I am using the default config, with melpa enabled.
 
 Thanks

For the last three weeks I've done the tutorial and then read up some information on keybinds to try and info pages to read. While my muscle memory is improving, I still have the strong urge to use the trackpad to navigate. I don't do well with the control keybinds especially on my thinkpad laptop. I also often fat-finger the super key which throws me out of focus.
 Its terribly frustrating but I soldier on in the desire to reach nirvana. Please send me your emacs energy and any tips you have for training myself using a default emacs on either linux (fedora) or windows (11). I use them both on a daily basis.

Buck2 is a from-scratch rewrite of Buck, a
polyglot, monorepo build system that was developed and used at Meta (Facebook),
and shares a few similarities with Bazel.
As you may know, the Scalable Builds Group at Tweag
has a strong interest in such scalable build systems.
We were thrilled to have the opportunity to work with Meta on Buck2
to help make the tool useful and successful in the open-source use case.
We also have a strong focus and
a lot of experience with the Bazel build system.
To connect the two
I will give an overview of how Buck2 differs from Bazel.

High-Level Differences
Buck2 is a fresh rewrite in Rust.
The codebase is structured in a very modular fashion,

 Emacs behaves perfectly well with full opacity, but flickers and produces static-like artifacts when transparency is enabled, especially when typing or scrolling. It seems less pronounced when the window emacs is stacked on top of is mostly a flat color. 
 I was using emacs-gcc-wayland-devel-bin 28.2. I tried building emacs-pgtk-native-comp-git 29.0 to no change. 
 So far, it is the only application with this issue. Oddly enough, this happens even with full opacity on Sway.

I realized that after a reboot, it no longer retains its state. Now, every time I open Emacs anew, after the computer reboot, I have to manually open ~/.authinfo.gpg, then it would ask me for the password, and if I enter the correct one, it works. Until the next reboot. Now, I think, I prefer it this way. But it bothers me that after a reboot, the first task I have to do is attempt to open an encrypted file to trigger a prompt. I have two questions with all that:
  
Why does it now require the password and not store it between the reboots (as it used to)? I don't think this is Emacs doing. Probably some gpg.conf setting.
 
How can I initiate the prompt in Emacs without having to open an encrypted file?

 I saw quite some versions of creating a Zettelkasten in Emacs using Org and one implementation of Building a Second Brain in Org. So, I would be really curious how one would merge both in org. I wrote an article on theory and practical method on how to combine those two methods: https://zettelkasten.de/posts/building-a-second-brain-and-zettelkasten/
 From experience, solutions in org ooze a great deal of creativity. So, if anyone wants to combine these methods, I will be happy to assist, in part to satisfy my curiosity.

 clang-formatter provides a function for formatting the current buffer using clang-format. It's not a mode, but I limit modes to only languages that are supported by clang-format (C/C++/Java/JavaScript/Objective-C/Protobuf/C#). It also make it easy to customize formatting style from local variable (.dir-locals.el). 
 Some part of the code is inspired by gofmt function from go-mode.

 I'm running Emacs 28.2 on Pop_OS. I recently had to do a refresh install, and then re-install my apps (including Emacs) from Pop-Shop. The shell behavior is truly odd.

Sometimes it works fine, but most of the time the scrolling of pdfs gets really slow. If I change the resolution to 1920x1200 it gets back to normal and scrolls smothly. When I use the builtin doc-view instead of pdf-tools it works fine. I tried running both on xorg and wayland and got the same result. Also, I tried running on a fresh emacs installation with the only package being pdf-tools, and the issue is still there. Does anybody experienced something similar? I am using emacs 27.1 on PopOS 22.04.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So the context is: Cats-effect or any m:n scheduler, Node, and Kube
 When working with NodeJs on a machine with multiple cores you are forced to spawn multiple Node processes to utilize it. With Kube though, there is no reason to do so. Instead of giving a single process 8 cores you spawn 8 pods with cpu:1.
 My question is - how much of a reason do I have to give my cats-effect app 8 core vs spawning 8 instances?
 And also how much of a bottleneck is the process of serialization with cats services trying to do a lot of concurrent IO aka web servers? It's anecdotal since I was not there but at work, it was observed that NodeJs is dying very fast under the pressure of grpc encoding/decoding. But it seemed to me to be a mistaken judgment since it should be the same in cats/tokio/what-have-you so I think it was just easier for them to ramp up those core numbers with scala.

 💭 Why?
 I was never satisfied with any theme nor any fonts, some or the other time, always felt to have a change.
 For long duration I was settled on modus-vivendi only, other than that I liked cattpuccin and doom-gruvbox, the later two lacked some face highlights in some mode (info, eww.. ). But modus is obvious masterpiece.
 This is emacs, so obviously I want to modify if something bother me.
 As a result, I finally started making a theme that felt fine to me. (I say fine because, I don't think it is complete or perfect)
 📜 Info
 There is no science or principle behind this theme. Just some colors lying on your screen. If many of you do not like it, i might tweak and change some colors for community purpose. Or else, i might improve and add some goodies.
 Screenshots are here: https://github.com/idlip/haki/blob/haki/gallery.org
 As of now, I dont plan on making light theme, I'm not a light theme user. But if many want light variant, I might take it up in near future.
 ⭐ Features
  
Usually in themes, background of mark region, completion bar gets noticed. So i made haki-change-region, which changes region color in many places on the fly.
 There are variables like haki-*-font, which has respective use cases to look good in org, markdown, elfeed.
 Also for meow or evil users, you can use haki-modal-mode-line which changes the mode-line border color accordingly to states.
  
Too long, Don't wanna read;
  
https://github.com/idlip/haki.
 It is available in melpa!
 Screenshots => https://github.com/idlip/haki/blob/haki/gallery.org
  
As a side note, I manage my whole system (nixos) and emacs in literate org-mode and it has been great. Check here: https://github.com/idlip/d-nix

 It happens not infrequently midsession, that when I run dap-java-run-test-method, I am presented with a dap-server-log buffer, which says at the top:
 Error parsing command-line arguments: Expected parameter for option '--class-path' but found '-m' 
 M-x lsp-restart-workspace or just M-x lsp have no effect on this. Short of restarting Emacs I can't get it working again. Does anyone have any advice?

I am always testing other pieces of software to improve my coaching, since not everybody uses The Archive. But whenever I start to use other apps, I am put off by their stutters and bugs. I think I report once every six months that something is off.
I started to use Apple Notes for collaboration (family stuff, with Christian, for a Podcast etc.). If I imagine that there are teams behind Apple Notes while Christian is 100% on its own, just with nagging me as a support, I am baffled.
In some way, I have the blessing to experience The Archive as a user with the most intimate user support possible. I have very high requirements for the software that I use to access my Zettelkasten because my work is very intense (after 6 hours of work I am often soaked in sweet). The software needs to get out of my way. The Archive is almost invisible to me now, almost like air. And similar to air, The Archive provides a vital foundation for me functioning.
So: Very good, @ctietze !]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 Im basically using 2 versions of Emacs. 28 and 23, one on WIndows. The short story is that, the company Im working for uses Windows and a specific GIS software that ONLY can works with 23 (unless I do more research with the incredibly scant documentation on this unusual setup). Im okay with it so far, coz I havent dont any proper training, and Emacs isnt the main focus. And I managed to improve and learn a lot by doing some manual loading of eLisp files in Emacs 23.
 ​
 My main question, which fonts do you all prefer? Any arguments/reasons for it? Im using Julia Mono on the companies, and Source Code Pro on my personal setup. I find Source Code Pro to be more pleasant.
 Oh, one last thing, the Emacs on my Windows appears "less sharp/low res". Though it could just be a trick of the eye.

 These 4 comments could all have different faces.
 // Single line comment. /** Doxygen. */ /* disabled code. */ /* * Comment block. */ 
 I have some local configuration that can do this, but it seems like it could be made into a small package (possibly with string support too).
 e.g. 
 (setq my-custom-faces '((:type comment :match-literal "/**" :face font-lock-doc-face) (:type comment :match-regex "//[:blank:]" :face font-lock-doc-markup-face))) 
 Does something like this exist, or is it worth writing a new package?

 Is it possible to write a package to add support for another version control system? At work I use a version control system that's not supported by VC.
 I've noticed that VC has emacs lisp code for each system ("vc-git.el", "vc-hg.el", "vc-cvs.el", and so on). Is all that's needed to write one of these? Or is there code in other parts (like vc.el) that is specific to the system. I notice that vc-src.el is very simple. So, I'm suspicious that there may be code in other places.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[GPT-4 is completely confused and going in circles, I can't get a good explanation out of it.
 My situation is this: I was trying to define a sum type whose branches had some fields in common. Ultimately, this is what works:
 ```purescript type GraduatedFields r = ( graduatedMax :: Number , graduatedMin :: Number | r )
 type GridFields r = ( gridCellSize :: Size , gridOrigin :: Point | r )
 type HorizontalFields r = ( isOpposite :: Boolean | r )
 type CommonPanel a = { alignmentFocusName :: String , data :: Record () | a }
 data Panel r = Graduated (CommonPanel (GraduatedFields r)) | Grid (CommonPanel (GridFields r)) | Horizontal (CommonPanel (HorizontalFields r))
 ```
 But if I simply switch the () to {} (which I thought was the same thing) for GraduatedFields, for instance, this no longer compiles:
 ``` Could not match kind
 Type 
 with kind
 Row Type 
 while checking that type GraduatedFields r has kind Row Type while inferring the kind of CommonPanel (GraduatedFields r) in type constructor Panel ``` Why is this the case? What is the subtle difference between these two?

 Since I announced consult-gh, we have now added some more features, including support for opening issues in magit/forge and create/edit posts from the forge buffer. This allows you to visit issues of any repo in an ad-hoc fashion and with an intuitive UI, eliminating the need to opening GitHub in a browser. 
 As mentioned in the last post, this can improve your GitHub workflow and now with forge integration will even make it more efficient and intuitive than before. Especially for repositories that you don't actively want to contribute to (so o cloning, no contribution, ...), this can simplify your magit/forge workflow.

 This week, I ran a poll on my Mastodon to see who uses Vanilla Keybindings vs Modal. As a Meow user since a year, I was curious. Given the results (hugely in favor of Vanilla), I decided to go back to trying Vanilla. And I'm really loving it. I feel like I'm actually faster in a way. It's hard to describe, but I prefer it over modal. Then again, I'm not a coder so I think maybe the reason that coders like modal is maybe it fits their typing/editing patterns better? I'm not sure.
 Anyway, as I said: I love Emacs and Vanilla keybindings. Except, as we all know, Emacs can be a bit of a relic. And sometimes, it's like the people in charge refuse to even acknowledge that the world has …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently I've been using org mode to store web bookmarks. I'd like to keep track of files using org mode, too.
 My goal is to have headlines to act as some sort of "abstraction" over my heterogeneous collection of bookmarks + local files. I can tag them, sort them, reference them (through ids), annotate them in the same way (despite web bookmarks and local files being so different).
 The idea is to just use attachments: attachments do use the usual ID property, the data dir is global (~/data). Inheritance for attachment is off for the sake of simplicity and to avoid problems when refiling.
 Whenever I want to index a file I just use org capture, i specify a file path (or file on point if using dired) and it automatically creates creates a headline with the file attached (moved) in it. 
 The only difficulty i see so far is to make org attach a file during a capture. It looks feasible, though.
 Does anyone here a similar workflow? I'd like to read advices or some experiences in this regard

 Some hacky methods I've seen involved a keybinding bound to a chain of resizing keystrokes. I wondered if there is a better way of achieving the same thing. Like how when you use tmm-menubar, when it opens, it doesn't do a 50/50 split but instead was more like 70/30 (I'll leave a picture in the comments for reference).

 As a practice I've written a CLI app but now I'd like to move it to some GUI like ScalaFX.
 How would you approach this? I don't want to assign unsafe runs to buttons, there must be a better way to create a ZIO which deploys the GUI in the end.

 I tried running an app in Windows's Program Files with M-x term and basically I can't figure out how to do the autocomplete for the space.
 I tried escaping it with '\' and just inputting it as is ' ' but neither seems to work.
 There must be a trivial solution for this.

Am new at this and getting ready to plow into a physical version of a Zettelkasten. I haven't had much luck finding examples of how reference/bibliographic cards are numbered or referred to ? Since they're generally kept in a separate  slip box, how are they numbered? Do they branch out too (i.e. 1a2b) or no ?
Would love to hear or see some examples.

 emacs-groundup
 Hi,
 Announcing v0.2 of emacs-groundup! There have been a number of exciting changes since v0.1.0. First, a quick recap of the objectives:
  
Provide a solid, ootb workflow for task and project management.
 Pre-configured for Julia and python programming.
 Can be used as-is by setting only a handful of (including zero) parameters. Ideal for users looking to 'try emacs'.
 Provide a carefully crafted set of keybindings using evil (pure emacs experience also possible).
  
Finally, here are some new features available in v0.2:
  
Module-based architecture, providing an excellent springboard for writing your own modules or tweaking existing ones.
 A project-based programming workflow using emacs-native tab- and project-management tools.
 LSP using the now built-in eglot.jl
  
And many, many more. A detailed CHANGELOG (v0.2 ← v0.1) available here.
 Give it a go! All user feedback and contributions are welcome.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello tout le monde,
 I (quite) recently wrote an extension (called by the name "Aby") for our beloved Emacs which is capable of dynamically handle (code/text/you name it…) snippets within your buffers. *Aby* is extensible via Elisp and thus pretty versatile. I'd be glad if you'd find some use in this work. A minor package-version is pending, but -- as of now -- Aby is working fine under the current circumstances. The (ROBOdoc) code documentation will give you some more insight on how it works: https://code.rubenphilipp.com/aby/
 Here you'll find the repository: https://github.com/rubenphilipp/aby

The "interactively sort" part is critical because I don’t want to recreate the list of candidates, as often that would require re-calling the original command that brought up the minibuffer in order to get the right candidates.
 I know you can customize consult--read to sort the originally displayed candidates, but what about changing the sort of the already-displayed candidates? Might embark-become offer a solution?
 Thanks so much for any help!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey folks,
 Khoj has added a bunch of features since my first announcement, so thought of sharing updates here in case you folks want to try it out and give feedback.
 Demo
 Uses Khoj to Search, Chat with the Khoj Github repository from Emacs
 Feature updates
  
Unified Search: Fast search across all (text) content types from a single interface
 Simplified setup 
 Installing Khoj on Emacs will automatically install the server if you have python, pip installed
 Khoj now works with python 3.11. So search is 25% faster and works with the default installed python on most operating systems
 We've started onboarding folks to Khoj cloud. Get on the invite list if you're interested in using Khoj AI on your phone and other devices (or don't want to self-host Khoj)
 
 You can quickly test out Khoj on the FAQ page. It'll let you search and chat with the Khoj Github repository 
 Khoj can now index issues, commit messages and docs from any Github repository
 
  
Quickstart
 Install Khoj from MELPA and call M-x khoj to run it
 See khoj.el setup instructions for more details or just ask Khoj on the FAQ webpage

 Dirvish with media-progress-dirvish package
 media-progress-dirvish and media-progress-dired packages displays position where you stopped watching video file in emacs's file manager buffer. Under the hood it extracts this data from media player (currently mpv only, but I suppose vlc support is also possible). Both packages available on MELPA. Hope this package will be useful for community! Any feedback highly appreciated!

 Lspce is a simple lsp client for Emacs, it only supports a small set of LSP features ( and I don't want to add more ATM), but for the last year, it was my main lsp client and it worked well, so maybe it's useful for others too.
 The highest priority of it is not to freeze Emacs, I cannot say I have achieved this goal, but I think it's in a good shape in terms of this.
 It's implemented as a module with Rust. It takes advantages of threads and caches results from lsp server to reduce Emacs's burdens.
 Its code ( especially the elisp code) needs some more improvements, and bugs are expected. You're warned :)
 You can find more details in the README. Enjoy it!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[How do (Scala 3) trait parameters interact with parameters of classes that extend the trait?
 I thought I wanted to write something like this:  trait ExampleTrait(val param: Int) case class Class(override val param: Int) extends ExampleTrait(param) val x = (Class(1): ExampleTrait).param  However, the compiler rejects the class line, saying:  ... error overriding value param in trait ExampleTrait of type Int; value param of type Int cannot override val parameter value param in trait ExampleTrait 
 I'm not clear on why that "value param of type Int cannot override val parameter value param in trait ExampleTrait".
 I tried several variations (e.g., no var on trait parameter, no override on class parameter, no val on class parameter), but nothing I tried that still had the trait parameter and had a class parameter with the same name worked. (Using different parameter names worked, but they're logically the same thing, so I want to keep the names identical.)
 Of course, I can do it without trait parameters, as in:  trait ExampleTrait { def param: Int } case class Class(override val param: Int) extends ExampleTrait val x = (Class(1): ExampleTrait).param 
 However, I thought maybe that would be doable using trait parameters.
 (No, it's not essential that I use a trait parameter. However, I'm also trying to learn Scala 3, so I'd like to understand what's going on and what the rules are, and whether trying use a trait parameter makes sense for my use case.)
 Thanks.

 I've written a simple package to help me install packages. Maybe you'll like it too. So I make this post. 
 I copy some description from the README ( read README in the repo for more details)
 Introduction
 Pie is a very simple Package Installer for Emacs.
 I used to use package.el
 (and elpa/melpa etc.), but it has some drawbacks IMO, including:
  
A single repository may be split into several packages. Some people like it, but not including me.
 It does not support optional dependencies.
  
I’ve only tested/used it on Linux, maybe there are some problems on Windows and/or Mac.
 Features
 Pie supports the following features:
  
Support cloning a repository or downloading files (e.g. from emacswiki) directly.
 Support cloning a particular branch/tag/commit
 Support git’s shadow clone
 Support customized building logic
 Support specifying dependencies according to your actual needs
 Support generating autoloads files and loading it

 There are many long-time users here who've been using Emacs for many years. In all these years, how well do you think Emacs has evolved? Are there some things that you think Emacs did very well in these years? Are there areas where Emacs did not do so well?

 Hello /r/emacs,
 shell-command-x.el is a package I wrote to improve the experience of using shell-command and async-shell-command without straying too far from the behavior of vanilla Emacs. Its primary features are:
  
The names of process buffers can be customized on a per-command basis; for example, the buffer name for the command ls -la can be automatically set to *shell:ls*, *shell:ls -la*, or any other number of desired values.
 
When a command completes, its output buffer can emulate special-mode; this is useful for quickly dismissing (with quit-window) or quickly re-running the command (with revert-buffer).
 
When a command completes, the point can be moved to the beginning of the output buffer if the command wasn't interactive; this is useful for paging through the output of commands like grep --help.
 
 The project readme also contains some tips and tricks for a smoother experience. The goal of the package is essentially to make shell buffers display when and where you want them, depending on the kinds of commands you run, and for those buffers to behave more like native special emacs buffers like help-mode.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So my post isn't meant to bash on Magit, but rather I am trying to understand what kind of issues people had with the git CLI that made them love Magit. 
 I remember before entering the world of emacs, people would say the two packages that would change your life would be Magit and org-mode. I have been using emacs for a few months now and I can safely say that I never use org-mode and still use the git CLI as I find it faster. Really the package that I felt was unique and made me stick with emacs was Tramp. The ability to open a remote file in an instant, with no subscription fee (looking at you Jetbrains) and without it interfering with my workflow was amazing.
 Now I am a young adult (~26yr) and am still early in my career as a software engineer so maybe I am just ignorant, but really the only git commands I use are git diff, status, pull, push branch and merge. And honestly in my bubble of using git, Magit is not really that much different than just using the CLI. Heck in the terminal I can even create aliases and chain commands with && which is even faster.
 Are there git commands that I don't know about that feel horrible or are the projects and responsibilities I deal with still small enough that I do not see the downfalls of using the CLI for much larger projects?
 TLDR: What aspects of Magit make it a better experience for version control than just using git in the terminal?
 EDIT: I want to thank each and everyone that replied. It seems that the way I commit code (multiple files at a time) is super elementary and for better debugging and readability people actually commit specific LINES of code not even files, which Magit in unmatched for. I learned a lot of new tools in this post specifically ediff and git bisect which I had not heard off. I plan to take these lessons forward in my career. I apologize if was not able to reply to everyone but I do promise I read your message. Thanks again.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi I'm trying to get a maybe unusual configuration work with eglot + clangd + projectile (or maybe project.el, any would be fine really)
 My projects are organized roughly like this:
 common project_a/.projectile project_b/.projectile project_c/.projectile 
 All dirs are git repos and common is shared between the three projects. Inside the .projectile files there is a +/../common line to include the common dir when looking for project files.
 The three project dirs include a compile_commands.json that also knows how to compile files in the common dir.
 Each project may set different defines or compiler flags to compile common code.
 Now I have two problems:
 - if I open a file inside project_a and then try to open a file in common with C-p f it switches to a new project root and from now on common is a project on its own (probably because it detects a git repo?)
 - if I jump to a symbol inside project_a defined in common, new project root again, clangd looks for compile_commands.json inside it, doesn't find it and fails to resolve symbols.
 I want each project to behave like a single one including common dir both in project navigation and in clangd.
 Any idea? Should I may be disable git project detection in some way?
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have information I am trying to convert to a table. 
 A sample line looks like this:
  
0007600 *words words words $7.20 12/27/21
  
If I just highlight and convert to table, it doesn't recognize the "words" part and I have too many columns. For example:
  
| 0007600 | *words | words | words | $7.20 | 12/27/21 |
  
I have a way to use M-x replace-string to add a "|" before every "$" or the date and even at the beginning of each line (the last step).
 Question:
 I need to find a way to insert a "|" after the initial numbers. I have tried replace-regexp with "[0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]", but I cannot find a way to add the "|" after those.
 Is there an easy way to insert a "|" in the 8th position, or after a set of numbers?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I decided to integrate some GoJS code into a PureScript Halogen application. I have some funding to do this, so it's not just a hobbyist project (though it started that way).
 Creating the Halogen components would be simple enough if one takes inspiration from gojs-react. The issue is that there are no PureScript bindings for the GoJS types themselves, but GoJS does provide .ts.d declarations, which means I could use purescript-read-dts, but that library's maturity/usability seems somewhat ambiguous, according to an author's post from 3 years ago.
 Conceptually I'm thinking of generating the bindings, trying to call the code from just PureScript, and adjusting the bindings manually for implicitly effectful computations. I'm not an experienced PureScript (or Javascript really) developer so I'm wondering what the community thinks of such a project. I know it's big.

 Instead, I’d like some suggestions for VB macros to help me send outlook message links to org-mode. I have org-outlook and a VB macro that copied the link to the message, but here’s what I’d like: a single macro that copies the message link, subject, body, etc., focuses emacs, calls org-capture, then archives the message in Outlook. 
 I just don’t know VB well enough to know where to begin. Anyone have other workflows they have developed to work with Outlook?

I used The Archive for a long time. Since then I've progressed through org-mode, obsidian, and any number of other weird tools for my linked writing. At the moment, I'm mostly using neovim with Renee's (remember Renee? He's still around!) Telekasten plug-in (check it out if you're using neovim).
Anyway, on a whim, I opened The Archive tonight to see how it would deal with the bizarre mess that my zettelkasten is. It works, flawlessly. The only issue is that I had to abandon putting things into subdirectories, which is something that I had been considering doing anyway. So, I did that, and, just in playing around, I got more actual useful connected thinking done tonight than I have in a long, long time.
Much love to Christian and Sascha, again.
Long Live The Archive.]]></summary>

On the 9th of March in the year 2023 or our era, Topiary was born or, at
least, its version 0.1.0 was released. Thus began the quest to package it, to
make it available in various ecosystems. Topiary is a universal formatter engine
written in Rust and packaged with Cargo. Packaging it in nixpkgs was a breeze
because of nixpkgs’ support for Rust, but mostly because someone else did it for us, for which we have to thank our contributor figsoda. It is
therefore already possible to do:
$ echo '{"foo"  : "bar"   }' | nix run nixpkgs#topiary -- -l json
{ "foo": "bar" }

Great.
Now, Topiary comes with support for OCaml and we want to be able to reach
this community and make it easy for them to use Topiary in their projects.

As such, I want to block marking my "plan next day" org habit as DONE unless there exists some element that matches "highlight+TODO=\"NEXT\"" in my agenda file. Does anyone know of a way to get org elements in a file that match some tags/props matcher progammatically (or even just match on a regex), or tell whether those elements exist so that I can use them as a function on org-blocker-hook? I tried e.g. org-tags-view as well as org-occur-in-agenda-files, but it seems like both of those just open a buffer with the appropriate lines and return nil.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 Even before trying out emacs in a more decisive way I had read about emacs pinky and had remapped my caps lock to left ctrl and vice versa and I was awed by how much more sense it makes. (Funny thing is my brother who is not a software engineer made fun of me for switching with the argument that the whole world uses it as is.)
 Now I am finally getting more comfortable in emacs I am trying to figure out whether I should remap the M key somewhere more comfortable.
 In typical keyboards and laptops M is in the left Alt position and therefore feels a bit uncomfortable to type M-x since I strike M with my left thumb and x with either the pointer or the middle finger.
 Is it my left thumb that is useless or does it feel more natural to hit M with the right thumb in the right Alt or AltGr? Currently my right (dominant) thumb feels more flexible and even though I know I will probably get used to it soon, I wonder if there are any clear cut better places for it. What do you guys prefer?
 Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I just found this nice minor mode for org.
 One thing I'm not quite satisfied is that the indentation for the plain text under deep levels is too much. For example, there are like 5 spaces difference between the heading and the text at level 5. 
 I think this behavior is controlled by the internal variable org-indent--text-line-prefixes, which specifies 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, .... In the mean time, the org-indent--heading-line-prefixes is like 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.... This is weird to me, as I would think the indentation for the text should be a constant offset relative to the heading. 
 Does anyone know how to fix this? Thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have lsp-java mostly working. About 80% of the time, when I expect a completion menu to appear, I get one after a few seconds. When I don't, reloading the buffer often fixes the problem.
 More concerningly, emacs will occasionally lock up for a minute or more. If I send a USR2 signal to emacs, that appears to inject a Quit command and create a backtrace. That, or that with several C-gs, will usually get me back to a point where I can issue command and enter text. That stack traces usually have lsp-process-send near the top. 
 These tend to happen when I try to save a file or wait for a completion menu. (I am using company for completions.)
 At times, the lsp server (jdtls) will start using 8-9 CPUs for several minutes. 
 I'm assuming this is not normal behavior. :-) Are there things that I can look at to try to understand what is going wrong?

 a) should I somehow convince projectile that these files in /nix are actually part of my project?
 b) should I convince direnv to not unload upon visiting these files?
 c) should I tell LSP mode to not try to reconfigure upon visiting dependencies?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A while ago I posted about how I was changing light and dark themes in Emacs. I wanted to provide an update, as it has changed a bit. 
 I am now using the top-right menu on Gnome to enable and disable dark mode. However, old GTK3 applications do not "see" this setting at all.
 To solve this problem I am using:
  
Python script that monitors dbus and changes the GTK theme when selecting dark
 Systemd unit to ensure the script is running all time
 Emacs snippet to react to this change
  
With this setup, having Emacs complied with pure GTK, changing the dark mode on gnome triggers a theme change, while the script triggers a change on the frame decoration. It sounds hacky, but the transition is very smooth and seamless.
 Also, this new code, makes sure that only one theme is configured in Emacs, as having multiple themes selected might be problematic, if themes change different settings.
 (use-package dbus :init (defun theme-switcher (value) ;; 0 = No Preference ;; 1 = Prefers dark ;; 2 = Prefers light. Not currently used by Gnome (let* ((dark-theme 'ef-dark) (light-theme 'ef-frost) (new-theme (if (= value 1) dark-theme light-theme)) (switch? (not (member new-theme custom-enabled-themes)))) (when switch? (mapc #'disable-theme custom-enabled-themes) (load-theme new-theme)))) (defun handler (value) (theme-switcher (car (car value)))) (defun signal-handler (namespace key value) (if (and (string-equal namespace "org.freedesktop.appearance") (string-equal key "color-scheme")) (theme-switcher (car value)))) :config (dbus-call-method-asynchronously :session "org.freedesktop.portal.Desktop" "/org/freedesktop/portal/desktop" "org.freedesktop.portal.Settings" "Read" #'handler "org.freedesktop.appearance" "color-scheme") (dbus-register-signal :session "org.freedesktop.portal.Desktop" "/org/freedesktop/portal/desktop" "org.freedesktop.portal.Settings" "SettingChanged" #'signal-handler))

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Been using Neovim as my "ide", like to switch to Emacs.
 Neovim pros:
  
Very fast workflow
 well chosen keybindings
 great Project overview
 works in Terminal
 Tabs ❤️
  
Cons: - lack of features (no standardized) - many plugins unstable - sometimes freezes - not all plugins Crossplatform
 Emacs Pros:
  
Lots of features for development and more
 Lisp better than lua or vimscript
 GUI and Terminal
 Org-mode, Magit, ...
 self documentation, file opening, ...
  
Cons: - Bad default movement - complicated Keybindings general
 Some things that are important to me. Biggest thing holding me off from switching are the Keybindings. Just Moving the cursor is already such a strech. I've installed Evil mode but you have to configure it with every other plugin and often end up with doubled behaviour and not everything working as expected. It's still very hacky and i'm not sute if i should be using it.
 My Question is if i should just commit to the default binding? I've heard that they are subjectively bad and cause pinky strain and don't allow a fast workflow, and i can see that being the case. But maybe it just comes down to practice.
 Any of you had the same experience coming from Vim? Who uses the default bindings? Do you experience any problems with them?
 Thank you in advance!

 (If anyone is able to help me with the pdf-tools installation, I would be immensely grateful! I have tried downloading XQuartz, poppler and automake and set up my init file as per this answer, but I'm still getting the error that symbol is not found in ARM64 architecture)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Emacs experts, I need your help. I run Emacs in text mode in 16-colour terminal emulator. I recently upgraded from Emacs 27 (shipped with Debian 11) to 28 (shipped with Debian 12) and all the colours got horribly messed up. Here is an example from customize-face:
 https://i.imgur.com/KdaaC2J.png
 I speculate this happens because the default colours now assume 256-colour terminal, and indeed if I switch to 256 colours in the terminal emulator the settings look readable:
 https://i.imgur.com/dE2jUCv.png
 The question is how do I easily revert to earlier settings from Emacs 27? I could possible go through all the options and set font faces to desired values, but this will be an extremely tedious task given the amount of options, and I feel like there must be a simple solution for this.
 EDIT: It seems that the problem with colours only happens when running Emacs from inside Tmux, but not when running it directly from a terminal.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone, When I try to create my daily note with org-roam-dailies-goto-today , the note (title and name) takes yesterday's date. The calendar shows the right day for today (if I want to select another date), so it knows today's date. But the function goto-today / capture-today is wrong.
 My capture template for the dailies is the default one. And org-roam-dailies-goto-tomorrow also captures yesterday's date. Where shall I place the edebug() command to get more feedback from emacs regarding these functions?
 I am using emacs 28.2 on Windows, with org-roam v2.2.2-42
 Any idea? Thanks in advance

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am currently (as in right now) designing a short (first iteration 5 hours of structured lecturing in total 2 open consulting hours) workshop that is directly geared towards beginners or people who make sure that they nailed the basics.
There are 8 open slots per workshops. A workshop means that you don't have to compete for time or attention as if you are in an underfunded public school. So, I decided 8 is a reasonable size. So, it is rather limited.
It is a no-fluff-concept. I won't tell you about the history of the method or my backstory. There are no complicated workflow terms you'll need to learn or note typology (which is only clouding the applicable knowledge). It is 5 hours of intense learning to get you started (most likely divided in 3 sessions with 2 additional open consulting hours).
Cost: 250-300$ for the whole workshop.
There will be an official announcement. If you are interested, subscribe to the newsletter, send me a daily carrier pigeon and ask how it is going, check the page hourly or use your preferred method of keeping updated.
I am happy to answer any questions.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A few days ago, I wrote up an idea of mine here which some very wonderful person (Karthink) made for me!
 He even gave it a wonderful name: Dired-Delight
 (No, I'm not renaming it to Dired-Summer, guys 😛)
 Anyway, I thought some of you might want to check it out. Uses would include (for me):
 1) Sorting through lots of files and directories and marking them with colors to say if they're processed, or still processing.
 2) Coloring files differently that belong to different categories but you need to keep them in the same folder.
 3) You have a folder with lots of pictures from different decades/eras and you want to visually mark them off.
 Etc...
 Plus it kinda looks pretty.
 Karthink says he wants to give it to me and I'll be the maintainer but, as I really have zero experience doing that, I may hold off on that for now. I am learning elisp right now but it's slow-going. I'm doing my best tho. It's just got nothing to do with my job so it's sometimes hard to find the time for a few hours to get through more lessons. But I'll get there. 🙃

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Org mode is incredibly flexible, and I particular I've recently turned my attention into the customizable regexp, they're all named something like org-*-regexp: 
  
org-emphasis-regexp-components
 org-outline-regexp 
  
My question is if they could be modified so that org-mode becomes a sort of markdown, for example replacing the stars '*' with hashtags '#' and the like, and if so, how much it would break (I'd assume pretty much everything as I'm using Doom emacs which has a lot of packages I'm not aware of). For example org-ql has also defined a similar set of variables named org-ql-*regexp (although I've not checked if it's a one-to-one correspondence between org regexp and org-ql regexp but is seems promising)
 Also I sort of remember that org-mode was moving away from parsing files using regular expressions in the long term, so even if today was more or less possible, then with each passing year, support for regular expression tweaking would be smaller.
 To what extent is this possible?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Many packages like org-krita/org-yt/org-excalidraw/org-xournalpp allow custom files to be displayed inline by means of a custom link type. However, they don't work when the file is linked as an attachment, which makes me think that there may be a better way to achieve this. 
 ​
 The org-display-inline-images function uses some functions and variables from image.el such as image-file-name-regexp and create-image to respectively check if the file is an image and to create the image descriptor to display it inline.
 The packages above (except org-yt which is more general) kind of work the same way: there is a project binary file (e.g. .xopp) that gets converted to an image format such as .png and .svg and then it gets displayed inline.
 Would it be possible to define a custom image handler (e.g. for .xopp) that would work exactly the same as, let's say, .png, except that it performs a conversion (.xpp -> .png) before actually handling it? And then the second questions: would it be a silly idea?

I'm on a Mac and I almost never use the Finder anymore to sort through files and manage them because dired is so amazing. But, here's a suggestion for a package (and please let me know if one already exists that does this):
 I want to colorize files/directories to visually group them. And I'll explain:
 In MacOS, you can select files and folders and click on File at the top menu and get a selection of colors which you have defined. They are essentially tags and you can add multiple colors to files/folders this way and also define them however you want. You can also search for them in this way. Tagging files and folders will put a colored dot next to their icon or next to their name in the Icon view. My idea for this package would be:

 I get empty matches when trying to use M-x consult-ripgrep.I've also set up this function:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm using Emacs 28.2.7 on Fedora 38 (KDE spin) and I have just been experiencing some odd new behaviour when I switch to an open Emacs window. Things work without a problem until I use MS Teams for a video call (using an external webcam). Once I've done that, every time I return to Emacs I get multiple errors saying 
 <XF86WebCam> is undefined 
 When I press a key the error goes away and I can use Emacs as usual but if I move to another application and then back to Emacs the error messages return again. I'm not using any packages that I know of that require a webcam. This behaviour only seems to have started since the recent .7 update to Emacs and happens using both Wayland and X11. I can't seem to replicate the problem on my laptop that has a built-in webcam. I'd be very grateful if anyone could provide some ideas as to what's going on or how to identify the problem. Thanks!

 I ran the ./configure command with native compilation and pgtk3 options and it seemed to run fine.
 When I run make, I get an error and it fails. I don't know much about C (or elisp for that matter) but as far as I can tell, the crux of the error message is this:
 ​
 Eager macro-expansion failure: (void-function seq-some) make[2]: *** [Makefile:916: bootstrap-emacs.pdmp] Error 255 make[2]: Leaving directory '/home/me/computing/emacs/src' make[1]: *** [Makefile:544: src] Error 2 
 ​
 Does anyone know what is going wrong?
 ​
 I have also tried to build and install aur packages for emacs 29 using an aur helper and run into a similar error.
 ​
 Thanks.
 ​
 PS. sorry if this is lacking information, i am not very experienced with this process.

Contretemps with a local tax appraisal agency inspires me to track their activities. I want to take notes and link to appropriate statutes.
When the statutes are updated, I want to replace the old copies with the new. Like anyone both wanting and eating cake, I'd like for my links to survive the file replacement.
I can link to a document. I can link to a document name, and that solves the problem if the document name remains constant over revision.
What I would really like is a link to "all files containing Texas Unemployment Compensation" and "201.011".
Right now, I'm using Devonthink. I can save a search as a smart group and then link to the smart group, but that's quite a bit of friction for creating a link. I think it also may not fit intimately with Devonthink's AI based See Also feature.
Any thoughts appreciated. I also appreciate the hospitality here.  The discussion is wonderful.]]></summary>

 ​
 I have `outline-minor-0` wich has some attributes applied. I don't care which attributes are applied on the face, I just want it to have a *red* foreground. So i write the following line in my init file:
 (set-face-attribute 'outline-minor-0 nil :foreground "red")
 However, the truth is that `outline-minor-0` has already applied these attributes: `:background "light grey" :weight 'bold`. The 3 attributes get mixed together so the resulting attributes of `outline-minor-0` are: red foreground, light grey background, bold weight when I just wanted a red foreground! 
 ​
 I could specify `:background 'undefined :weight 'undefined` to remove those attributes, but I'd like to implicitly reset every other unspecified attribute. How can I do it?
