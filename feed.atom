 I like this change to the interface but it has some weird behavior. In the following screenshot

 The color extends beyond the end of the line #+end_src to the following empty lines. This is not always the case and calling font-lock-update correctly colors the empty lines, though I am not sure why it happens in the first case!
 More annoyingly for collapsed items which have a source block inside them get colored like Hello... above.
 Is this a bug or intended behavior? Can I "fix" it?

 Below is my program. Here is how it is supposed to work:
  
The program is based on an MVar quitFlag that is supposed to act as a flag: the main thread is a loop that exits if and only if quitFlag is nonempty.
 The program first launches a thread that counts up starting from 0 (see countingLoop) and writes into the flag once it gets past 1000. It also prints every number it counts.
 The main thread just loops indefinitely until the flag is set, at which point it just exits.
  
All I get is a program that never exits and prints nothing on screen, whereas I would expect it to print the first 1000 numbers and then exit.
 module Main where import Control.Monad (when, void) import qualified Control.Concurrent as Cc main :: IO () main = do quitFlag <- Cc.newEmptyMVar Cc.forkIO . void $ countingLoop quitFlag 0 runUntilNonEmpty quitFlag -- | Prints integers; once we get past 1000, set the flag countingLoop :: Cc.MVar () -> Int -> IO () countingLoop flag n = do when (n >= 1000000) $ Cc.putMVar flag () print $ "n == " ++ show n countingLoop flag (n+1) -- | Run in a loop that only ends once the flag becomes nonempty runUntilNonEmpty :: Cc.MVar () -> IO () runUntilNonEmpty flagVar = do flag <- Cc.isEmptyMVar flagVar when flag $ runUntilNonEmpty flagVar

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I would like to make a minor mode for quickly entering text containing accents or diacritical marks. In this mode, I would replace the keybinding for each alphabet key with a prefix map that is only defined for the number keys. For example the keybinding for the 'a' key could be defined as:
 ﻿(cl-loop for ch across "ąäàáæåâãǎα" for ind from 0 do (define-key quick-accent-mode-map (kbd (format "a %d" ind)) `(lambda () (interactive) (insert-char ,ch)))) 
 So if the user typed "a1", "ä" would be inserted into the buffer. But if the user typed "a" following by anything other than a digit, I would like the prefix map to have a "default" action that simply performs the actions that would result in the absence of the prefix map. So if the user types "ad", then, for a typical text-editing major mode, "ad" would be inserted into the buffer.
 Is it possible to define a default action for a keymap to achieve this behavior?

 I use LSP peek to show references and definitions but, since I'm not using the default line height, the peek panel bottom most of the time is not visible because (I guess) wrongly calculates the panel's height.
 Is there a way to customize de panel position and/or size so I can adjust it to my config?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dear Zettlers,
I am currently reading the Artikel The Two Definitions of Zettelkasten and am just a couple of hundred words in. @chrisaldrich contextualises the Zettelkasten Method within the bigger picture of using practices that seem to have something in common. I am perfectly happy to admit that I do the very thing that Chris is pointing out: My starting point it the article by Luhmann and while I am aware of the history Zettelkasten Method I never saw much practical value from reading the historical use cases.
I, myself, am a pretty non-nostalgic character. My passion for the Zettelkasten Method is fueled by exactly two motivations:
Improving my personal toolbox for knowledge work.
Generating tools to help other people to improve their toolbox.
I see this as an advantage because I have little incentive to lose myself in tweaking tools or spending time on the tool for fun and joy (nothing wrong with that if you do because it aligns with your own goals, of course).
The downside of this utilitarian approach is that it creates a blind spot which can be a source of fallacies.
So, the question is: What did you learn from the history of the Zettelkasten Method? What is there to be found what is missing in the current collective thinking in the internet?
Live long and prosper

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On GitHub, a user proposed to change "ghost" to "mind":

  
Changing ghost into mind. The mind refers to the mental frame, while ghost is the soul of a dead person.


In reaction to that, I wrote the first commentary to the translation:
The Zettelkasten as the ethereal ghost that hides in plain sight
In German, "Geist" means both "mind" and "ghost". The question spelled out could be something like "Can the mind of the Zettelkasten be observed?" Or something like that. So, why "ghost" instead of "mind?"
There is great anime film titled "Ghost in the Shell". It is quite a philosophical movie that asks the question: If your consciousness can be moved from your body and brain to machine are you still considered a human or will you become a computer program? One possible answer could be: If we can move from body to body, and we are still considered human we should be considered to be ghosts that take possession of bodies.
What do the visitors see when they see everything and are disappointed? Perhaps, they feel the same disappointment of scientists who opened the scull of people to look at the human mind but see "it all": just flabby gray tissue.
To this day, this seems to be the feeling us who start their own Zettelkasten. The frankensteinian fantasy of creating something alive turns into obsession or disappointment. The mind of the Zettelkasten turns into a ghost, something ethereal and evasive that can hide in plain sight. We dive into our Zettelkastens in search for what we believe we created and just seem to find notes.
So, what is the Zettelkasten? One possible answer might be: The ghost that is able to hide in plain sight and just can be seen from the corner of the eye.
What do you think about that reasoning?]]></summary>

I recently saw a post in which someone regurgitated the often-commented Philip Wadler quote, “Agda is what Haskell wants to be when it grows up.” I love Agda, and one of my favorite papers of all time is a proof of computational complexity using Agda (https://projekter.aau.dk/projekter/files/335444832/pt101f20thesis.pdf). But I’m sorry, Haskell is the grown-up version of Agda, and it is the rational adult in a room full of children when compared to every other programming language. Agda, Idris, etc. are programming ideals, and I would love to see them reach the level of maturity of Haskell. But, guess what? You can do literally everything in Haskell, right now, at an astronomical level compared to any other programming language. Serious…]]></summary>

 I'm thinking it might make the most sense to write the code on a local machine, and compile it on my local machine, and then upload a binary to the cloud. But perhaps there's another way to do this that I don't yet know.
 Ideally I'd like something where I can send HTTP requests to a given url/ip and have Servant handle them and send results back to me.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I am a recent grad who has been professionally developing software in Haskell over the past two years. 
 I very much enjoy developing in the language and my job in general but I am somewhat worried about my future prospects not working in a more "mainstream" language.
 There aren't many jobs concerning pure statically typed FP languages in my area and I would strongly prefer not to work a fully remote job. I am tied to my current location for the forseeable future. 
 As a result of the above, I worry about a scenario where I would end up losing my job at some point down the road and not being able to carry my experience onto my next job as easily. Is this justified or would it not be difficult to make a switch if need be? I notice vacancies often require several years of experience in whatever programming language the company offering the job is using. My qualifications are solid for my age and I have had the opportunity to contribute to open source projects as well so I guess that might help me in such a scenario. Maybe I should look to contribute to some non-FP open source projects just in case?
 In short, the dilemma I am in is that I do not want to quit my FP job but at the same time I do not want to potentially end up in a bad spot career-wise.
 I figured it could help to have some perspective from other people about this matter and would love to hear your thoughts on it.

So why not re-use it to directly insert links to headings at point? I threw together this small gist which works well for this. Now I can invoke consult-org-heading, use orderless to winnow to the heading I want, C-, to embark, and l to insert the link.

 My problem is quite simple to understand: when I activate "org-toggle-inline-images", I would like my images to be centered. Indeed, I tried this in a org-file

 [[file:images/anImage.png]]

 But it obviously doesn't work. 
 Does anyone have a tip?

So, I'm trying to get a deeper understanding of what can be done with Org properties, and I notice that in the documentation there are, or appear to be, at least three types of the wee beasties, namely:
  
Special properties;
 Built-in properties; and
 User-defined properties.

 I've seen registerv-make too, and that doesn't seem to do the trick.
 Can anyone give me a simple template to have registers set to single- or multi-line-strings during init?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have been taking rock the jvm’s advanced scala course on Udemy, and I feel like there just isn’t enough legitimate practice for the concepts to fully sink in. Basically, I recognize the patterns when they come up in production code that others write, but I have a hard time actually using the patterns myself. Work projects that require me to use them are once in a blue moon type situations, so I need a way where I can hone my scala skills and understanding outside of the day-to-day projects that come up.
 I’m wondering if anyone has advice on how I might craft my own mini practice projects that would help me really get a feel for when to use type classes, implicits, futures, and whatnot. 
 I guess more broadly, my question is: how do I come up with projects to hone my skills without prompting from courses or from product folks at work?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all!
 I have recently uploaded my first cabal package to Hackage, the text-compression library: https://hackage.haskell.org/package/text-compression
 This library aims to provide a simple interface to various efficiently implemented compression algorithms.
 Currently, this library only has implementations for the Burrows–Wheeler transform (BWT) and the Inverse BWT algorithms.
 A brief list of future algorithms to be implemented and supported:
  
FM-index
 Move-to-front (MTF) transform
 Run-length encoding (RLE)
  
And more!
 A test suite is to be implemented for the current and future implementations.
 ​
 I would appreciate any and all feedback, and thank you for taking the time to check out this post and the library!
 ​

Recently however, I had the opportunity to ask a much more experienced (20y+) Haskell-guru to review my code. He sighed, smiled and and said my code reminded him of his early Haskell days. I asked "how come?", to which he replied
  
I also used to write r instead of request -- you're a programmer, not a mathematician. You're doing Haskell, people already know you're clever -- you don't have to write it on their noses (Swedish proverb)
  
I don't think I'm alone in doing things this way. If I were to justify it, I'd say past-me was carried away by Haskell's promise of extremely concise code, and using 1-3 character variable names lend themselves to that end. Am I (are we?) just being vain at the expense of future maintainability? Have any of you found yourself adopting more descriptive variable names (as is custom in most other languages) with more experience?

I wanted to enable the mouse, so I turned on Xterm Mouse Mode, but once I did that, scrolling seemed to be completely turned off. Whenever I try to scroll, it just says mouse 4/5 are undefined.
 I tried to find a solution online, but the solutions I came across seemed very hack-y. It feels like this kind of thing is just a setting I missed, especially because scrolling was working perfectly fine before. If there is no "direct" solution, I am curious why this is the case. Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to understand the behavior of the variable current-prefix-arg. In particular, I'm trying to understand whether if I pass a prefix argument to func, and other-func is called by func, other-func should be ignoring that prefix argument. 
 Consider the following four functions: 
 (defun f1 (arg) (interactive "P") (when arg "Non-nil")) (defun f2 (arg) (interactive "P") (when current-prefix-arg "Non-nil")) (defun g1 (arg) (interactive "P") (message "%s, %s" current-prefix-arg (f1 nil))) (defun g2 (arg) (interactive "P") (message "%s, %s" current-prefix-arg (f2 nil))) 
 I would have thought that both g1 and g2 would behave the same. But if I call g1 with the C-u prefix key, I get "(4), nil", whereas if I call g2 with the C-u prefix key, I get "(4), non-nil". 
 Is this as it should be? I understand I can bind current-prefix-arg to nil before calling f2, i.e. I could just call f2 inside the scope of a let expression, binding current-prefix-arg to nil. But is there a cleaner way to do this? 
 Looking at the manual section on prefix command arguments hasn't helped me figure this out, so I'm hoping someone here may be able to help. (I'm not clear on what is meant there by "the next editing command. At first I thought prefix-arg would be passed on to functions in the scope of another, but current-prefix-arg would not; now I'm not sure anymore.)

If the 2nd argument is t i want to return the 3rd argument and if f then the 4th. I need to do this on a bigger scale, but this is a simple example I can think of.

 Show that Either String (Maybe Integer) follows the functor laws. You will need several test cases that `shouldBe` True. These cases should test when the Right value is Nothing or Just k, where k is some Integer. Your test cases should also test when Either is a Left value. 
 Will someone please help me understand how to use "either" to test the functor laws? The two functor laws that I wrote are shown below:
 firstFunctorLaw :: (Eq (f a), Functor f) => f a -> Bool
 firstFunctorLaw x = (fmap id x) == x 
 secondFunctorLaw :: (Eq (f c), Functor f) => (b -> c) -> (a -> b) -> f a -> Bool

compromised work email won’t lock out your family photos.
But then you have two different operating systems to manage, and you
may consider that it’s not worth the effort and simply use the same
operating system for your private life and for work, at the cost of

 After a period of spooky deliberation and well-received release candidate, Koz and I are pleased to announce mtl-2.3.1, which features the following hellish changelog:
  
Add modifyError to Control.Monad.Error.Class, and re-export from Control.Monad.Except.
 Make the MonadCont instance for ContT more polykinded; now, r is allowed to be of an arbitrary kind k, rather than only Type.
 Add a generic liftCallCC for use with any MonadTrans.
 Add modifyError to Control.Monad.Error.Class
 Return re-export of ExceptT and related functions to Control.Monad.Except.
 Add label function to MonadCont
  
If you wish to migrate to mtl-2.3.x and have not yet done so, please refer the migration guide in the repo: https://github.com/haskell/mtl/blob/master/docs/Mtl-2.3.x-Migration.md
 A release has been published on the github repository under the tag v2.3.1.
 Happy Halloween!

 I'm trying eglot on emacs-29 which I configure like follows (mostly for C++): ```
 (progn (customize-set-variable 'eglot-autoshutdown t) (customize-set-variable 'eglot-extend-to-xref t) (customize-set-variable 'eglot-ignored-server-capabilities (quote (:documentFormattingProvider :documentRangeFormattingProvider)))
 (with-eval-after-load 'eglot (setq completion-category-defaults nil) (add-to-list 'eglot-server-programs '(c-mode c++-mode . ("clangd" "-j=4" "--malloc-trim" "--log=error" "--background-index" "--clang-tidy" "--cross-file-rename" "--completion-style=detailed" "--pch-storage=memory" "--header-insertion=never" "--header-insertion-decorators=0")))) (add-hook 'c-mode-hook #'eglot-ensure) (add-hook 'c++-mode-hook #'eglot-ensure) (add-hook 'rustic-mode-hook #'eglot-ensure)) 
 ```
 Things seem to work, however, even when I have requested clangd to not do header insertion --header-insertion=never, eglot keeps inserting headers for me. How can I disable this behaviour or I'm I doing something wrong?
 For example, if I'm on a C++ buffer and I type std::vector then eglot will go ahead and add #include <vector> which I don't want at all.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Greetings, fellow Emacsians!
 On behalf of the EmacsConf 2022 organizers team, I’m very excited to announce the schedule for EmacsConf 2022 (Dec 3 and 4).
 All of the times listed on the schedule are in EST (UTC-5). You can click on each talk’s title to open its page for more information, including its scheduled time in your local time. (Displaying local time requires running a tiny bit of AGPLv3+-licensed free/libre JavaScript code, included on the talk pages.)
 For prerecorded talks, this time is also when the talk’s video will be made available on the same page. Please note that the times are approximations, and that the schedule may change leading up to the conference.
 As the conference approaches, we’ll post more details on how to watch and participate.
 You can subscribe to the emacsconf-discuss mailing list at https://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/emacsconf-discuss to be sure you’ll get updates. We’ll also put updates here on r/emacs.
 Want to help make EmacsConf even awesomer? Volunteer!
 https://emacsconf.org/2022/volunteer/
 We hope to see you all around on Dec 3–4 for EmacsConf 2022!
 (This email was slightly adapted from the email sent to the emacsconf-discuss@gnu.org mailing list.)

 Are there any tools that help you with it ?
 What is the "mathematical" approach to this? I assume it's something like analysis of single functions , to figure out their compositional time complexity ?
 I apologize for the foolery, I'm just a beginner :)
 Thank you !!

 The prospective opportunity of contributing cabal packages to Hackage excites me and was wondering if anyone knew of how to be added to the Uploaders group there? I have sent an email but maybe the admins haven't seen/checked emails for new users to be added to the uploaders group?
 Does anyone know if there are any other requirements to be given access to upload packages to Hackage?

 One solution would be SortedMap, but I read some benchmarking blog posts that they tend to be slow.
 Other would be implementing a binary heap using a Vector, which is supposed to be faster, but I’m not sure if it will still be faster if I need to perform the sifting on it.
 Is one of these options viable or is it just one of the situations, where using a mutable data structure is the best option?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I've been using Gnu Emacs in the office for about two weeks now. I'm a vim user and will remain a vim user but I was challenged to try emacs by my colleagues and I in turn challenged them to try Vim. After the promised two weeks I can say the following about emacs from a vimmer perspective.
 I actually LIKE IT. I like the possibilities of emacs and the extensibility although for my workflow it doesn't offer much that vim plugins don't.
  
I don't like emacs PACKAGE MANAGER at all and I don't really care for lisps. I find vim script much easier. I don't like how emacs treats buffers and I find myself constantly killing extra buffers. I don't mind the emacs key bindings that much but I quickly changed the evil mode because muscle memory was killing me. 
  
I both LOVE & HATE M-x commands! I love them cause you can discover so much about was emacs can do but I hate typing them. I REALLY like w3m in emacs! I use w3m in a terminal on a daily basis and with emacs I can just have it open in a buffer or split and do my work at the same time. 
  
I LOVE how great emacs handles RTL languages. It is just great and looks great too.
  
I don't care for org mode! Yea yea I know you will hate me for saying it but I really dont care about it I prefer Vim wiki
  
I DON'T like the emacs terminal options that I've tested so far. K couldn't install vterm so maybe thats why
  
With all that being said I will use both emacs and vim on a daily basis for different things but what would make my life easier in emacs would be if I knew a way to handle buffers more effortlessly in emacs. In vim I can ZZ out of any buffer or split. The emacs evil mode doesn't provide that by default and I couldn't map it myself in the config.
  
PS: I use the latest release of emacs in the Arch repos. I am a frontend web developer.
  
PS2: sorry about the lengthy post, just thought I'd share my experience. Cheers.

A I thought it would be nice if there was a common knowledge base on what Luhmann himself wrote on Zettelkasten. So here is a translation of all 18 notes of the section 9/8 of his second Zettelkasten. I tried to find a middle ground between a translation that is faithful to his style, the nature of the German language, and the least ambigious English I can come up with.

 For example if a user in the main put +67 in the solve is 13

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While surfing around on Emacs Stack Exchange, someone commented to go look at dir-locals-set-directory-class. It has a closely associated function called dir-locals-set-class-variables.
 Base Emacs knows about projects. Projects are defined (mostly) via version control. I know about Projectile and use it as well but this is in base Emacs introduced in version 23.
 The two steps are to first set up dir local variables based upon class using dir-locals-set-class-variables. I explain why I used eval later but I did this:
 lisp (dir-locals-set-class-variables 'proj1 '((nil . ((eval . (pedz/proj1-set-default-mode-locals)))) (enh-ruby-mode . ((eval . (pedz/proj1-set-enh-ruby-mode-locals)))))) 
 The second step is to tie a project (specified by its directory) to a class like this:
 lisp (dir-locals-set-directory-class "~/Source/proj1" 'proj1) 
 And you are done. The two functions pedz/proj1-set-default-mode-locals and pedz/proj1-set-enh-ruby-mode-locals will be called based upon the mode of the file being visited within the project. And they are also called for such things as compile buffers and other buffers not visiting files within the project based upon default-directory. Those functions can set variables, enable modes, etc.
 So... you are asking Why not just use .dir-locals.el?
 The answer is because of risky variables. I now have three variables that end with program which are (properly) considered risky that need to be set in this project and it isn't possible to type ! and tell Emacs "Yes... those variables for this directory are ok. Please don't pull on my shirt tail again about this.". Rather, each new file that is opened, it will ask if those variables are ok to be set.
 And I totally get why. It is unsafe to just set those variables based upon something that may or may not be under your control. But your init files are (or should be) under your control. So, I've moved all of the project specific settings into my init files.

 (defvar my-table (make-hash-table)) (puthash 'foo '(nil nil 0) my-table) (puthash 'bar '(nil nil 0) my-table) (puthash 'baz '(nil nil 0) my-table) (defun do-stuff () (let ((running (nth 0 (gethash key my-table))) (chain-state (nth 1 (gethash key my-table))) (last-idle-value (nth 2 (gethash key my-table)))) (setf running t))) (do-stuff 'bar) 
 then I would hope that (gethash 'bar my-table) shows me the row (t nil 0) but it's still (nil nil 0).
 This matters because now the only thing that will work is if I don't let-bind. And that makes my large functions super-unreadable with (nth 1 (gethash key my-table)) all over the place. 
 I've also tried cl-letf and seq-let, they don't help here.

 So in his talk The Case For Effect Systems Spiewak says something(its timestamped) like "I had a service that could handle 100 connection and then when it got a 1000 it didnt crash because it was written with IO and Resource" and doest really elaborate on why that was the case 
 From my point of view its very easy to have such guaranties in "1 thread per request" model since all you have to say is "this thread pool of size 100 will handle http connections" and 101th concurrent connection will fail cause you dont have a thread to for it. When with effect systems and asynchronous stuff in general(eg NodeJs which only has 1 thread) where you have n threads to handle a much bigger m of concurrent connection you dont have that. And generally its a good thing cause what you do is essentially keep a queue of things to do trading memory and latency for the ability to handle any number of connection up to the limits of you your systems resources. You latency rises but you dont return 500s. Up to the point where you die.
 And I dont see how IO and Resource would help you with now dying when IO(and to be fair Futures) is the thing that enables such a problem

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all,
 I have been playing with keymaps and wrapper commands a lot. And something I have come to realise is that a lot of stuff could be implemented really fast by sending arbitrary key sequences. 
 Keyboard macros seem limited to me : they look more like a succession of commands than a succession of keys.
 Two examples I could not achieve with macros (maybe I'm doing it wrong)
 - Prepare a command : for example I want to prepare a call to isearch, with foo pre-typed into the minibuffer. When I do it the macro way, the macro will execute the command isearch foo
 - Define an alias for partial key-bindings : let's say I want to alias C-x r to C-r, so that i can type C-r t instead of C-x r t (which is bound to #'string-rectangle). I could not make a keyboard macro work since C-x r is not bound to anything
 Is there anyway to send arbitrary key sequences to the emacs interpreter from elisp ?
 ​
 Thanks !

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, guys! I have the technical question.
 Need to merge the payload if the reference number(refNo) is the same in different messages. Limitation is that I can only use a KTable and if the key is an even number I don't need to merge the payload. Additionally, the order of incoming messages should not change the result.
 ​
 For example, if we have an empty topic and incoming messages are:
 ​
 1: { key: "1", value: {refNo:1, payload:{data1}} }
 2: { key: "2", value: {refNo:1, payload:{data2}} }
 3: { key: "3", value: {refNo:2, payload:{data3}} } // this one should be not effected and left how it is
 ​
 Expected result:
 ​
 1: { key: "1", value: {refNo:1, payload:{data1, data2}} }
 2: { key: "2", value: {refNo:1, payload:{data2}} }
 3: { key: "3", value: {refNo:2, payload:{data3}} }
 ​
 The only way I can think of to do this is to use two times .groupBy and join with the original topic everything again.
 ​
  
First change the key to refNo, save the key to the value itself, and join the payload during aggregation.
 Secondly .groupBy revert key to the initial state.
 The last step joins everything to the original topic because I lost one message during grouping by.
  
​
 I'm pretty sure there's an easier way to do this. What is the most optimized and elegant way to solve this issue?
 ​
 Thank you in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[First, I am not the author of this tool, but have used toc-mode to make tables of contents for pdf and djvu files for many times. There are only a few other tools have the same functionality, but toc-mode is supposed to be the most convenient one. 
 Most other tools are command line, which is not adequate for this task. Even though a pdf contains the information of its table of contents, it is almost impossible to get a perfect table of contents automatically. You always need to do some editing to the extracted table, and this is why having this tool in Emacs is reasonable. Most editors focus on programming code, but things involving editing are more than that. I think toc-mode is a good example.
 By the way, the same author has more ambitious goals to create better a better doc viewer with some editing functionalities in Emacs. This is again a great example how Emacs do can more than code editing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have been eyeing emacs for a very long time but haven't taken the plunge yet because of the barrier to entry. I take a lot of notes that involve figures and equations. Due to my dislike for latex, I type all of my notes using markdown in vim. While markdown is fine for simple readmes, it's a bit lacking when it comes to organizing figures or making anything but basic tables. I would like to know whether orgmode has the ability to group figures. There are two kinds of these. The first is the type where you have multiple independent figures along a row, with each having its own caption. The second is like the first but in addition to each figure having its own caption, there's a caption for the whole group. Can emacs do that without resorting to using ugly latex code ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'd like to configure my shell to automatically jump to the first error, so that I can easily visit the file at the line number where the error occurred. However, I'm coming up short when looking for hooks, functions, or filters to make use of. Essentially, I want to run compilation-next-error whenever a compilation finishes with errors.
 ​
 In case you haven't tried compilation-shell-minor-mode inside an inferior shell, please give it a try. You won't regret it. It also works with vterm, but you need to do a little extra work to make sure the key bindings don't conflict with each other.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I have the following code example to encode numerals as Church numerals, this compiles (with RankNTypes enabled) :
 s :: (a -> b -> c) -> (a -> b) -> a -> c s x y z = x z (y z) k :: a -> b -> a k x _ = x type ChurchNumeral = forall a. (a -> a) -> a -> a csucc :: ChurchNumeral -> ChurchNumeral csucc n = s (s (k s) k) n 
 However, once I η-reduce csucc to
 csucc = s (s (k s) k) 
 I get
 • Couldn't match type: (b0 -> c0) -> a0 -> b0 with: forall a. (a -> a) -> a -> a Expected: ChurchNumeral -> ChurchNumeral Actual: ((b0 -> c0) -> a0 -> b0) -> (b0 -> c0) -> a0 -> c0 • In the expression: s (s (k s) k) In an equation for ‘csucc’: csucc = s (s (k s) k) | 130 | csucc = s (s (k s) k) | 
 How could I get this version to compile? I'm guessing passing in the argument explicitly allows GHC to know that the second argument of the most-outer s call has the expected type, but leaving that s partially applied, GHC is looking for the type in the signature of s and it can't unify that type with ChurchNumeral. Is that correct?
 Thank you in advance!

You can make looping patterns greedy using the pattern.greedy() method, but you cannot yet make group patterns greedy.
  
And in the examples they have the following comment for greedy:
 // expecting 2, 3 or 4 occurrences and repeating as many as possible start.times(2, 4).greedy()
 What do they mean by repeating as many as possible in this context?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[-XScopedTypeVariables is super useful but traditionally only allowed binding type variables in function definitions with explicit types. Recently-ish we got explicit type variables in pattern positions
 lookupQMap :: forall a. Typeable a => QKey a -> QMap -> Maybe a lookupQMap qid qmap = -- This could use a Data.Typeable.cast, but it's simplified from some more complex code case lookupQ qid qmap of ResultEntry @r' dat _ | Just Refl <- eqT @r @r' -> ... 
 Which is great and makes GADTs much more usable in my experience. But there is some churn when adding new arguments, which I usually work around by using record syntax

 The proposal and paper don't seem to mention record patterns. Is this an oversight, or an intentional decision because it would make the grammar ambiguous, or something else? Does anyone know a workaround?

 Oh yeah fill-paragraph does not have this behavior in other modes. It is behaving as expected.

 Here is the type of data that I am trying to plot:

 I am running emacs on WSL2 on a windows computer and I installed gnuplot from the ubuntu terminal first. Then I also included the following in my init.el file: use-package gnuplot :straight t. I then placed my cursor near the table and ran M-x org-plot/gnuplot as mentioned in the manual. I did not get any errors but I am not sure where the graph was created? How can I make the graph pop up in the org file?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Some of you Zettelkasten fans might be interested in an outdated and idiosyncratic program called Literary Machine. You can learn more here:
http://sommestad.com/lm.htm
The program is powerful but far from intuitive, so here are my personal notes about how to use it:
The core items in LM are:
Concept/category words (in the Dictionary pane).
Text items (notes; little boxes in which you write text).
Projects (collections of selected text items).
In a regular outliner program, you add items to a category (in a tree view or hierarchical list); in LM, it's just the opposite: you add categories to an item (similar to tagging with #hashtags. This is true for LM projects, too. You don't add items to a project; you add projects to an item. All of this is done by dragging a concept (dictionary word)…]]></summary>

 Whenever I try running my program with "Load GHCI" I get this kind of message: 
 <no location info>: error: can't find file: Lib.hs Failed, no modules loaded. 
 And when I try executing the default "someFunc" function (which basically prints a string) I get: 
 <interactive>:1:1: error: Variable not in scope: someFunc 
 What's wrong? How can I fix that? Or maybe I should just start from 0? Or even use a different IDE? What do you guys recommend?
 I'm very much fascinated with Haskell, category theory and functional programming, but how can I get into it when I'm unable to execute a simple Haskell program.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm looking for a way to bypass org-agenda dispatcher (unsure about the terminology here: I'm talking about the buffer you get immediately upon calling org-agenda), and thought of a simple way of doing it. 
 (defun my/org-agenda () (interactive) (setq my/agenda-views nil) (dolist (cmd org-agenda-custom-commands) (add-to-list 'my/agenda-views (cons (car (cdr cmd)) (car cmd)))) (let ((view (cdr (assoc (completing-read "Select an agenda view: " my/agenda-views) my/agenda-views)))) (org-agenda nil view nil))) 
 That worked just fine, but I thought it'd be nice to be able to pass restrictions (to buffer, subtree, etc.) to the function, perhaps using C-u as a prefix for a buffer restriction and C-u C-u for a subtree restriction. So I figured this should work: 
 (defun my/org-agenda-restr (&optional arg) (interactive "P") (when arg (org-check-for-org-mode)) (setq my/agenda-views nil) (dolist (cmd org-agenda-custom-commands) (add-to-list 'my/agenda-views (cons (car (cdr cmd)) (car cmd)))) (let ((restr (cond ((equal arg '(4)) 'buffer) ((equal arg '(16)) 'subtree))) (view (cdr (assoc (completing-read "Select an agenda view: " my/agenda-views) my/agenda-views)))) (org-agenda nil view restr))) 
 But it doesn't. For some reason, no matter which custom view I try to call, I get a CRM prompt asking me to choose a keyword. 
 Now, I thought maybe I was passing the wrong type of object as the third argument for org-agenda, So I tested using this, and it looks like what I'm passing as the third argument is a symbol, which I thought is what it wanted: 
 (defun my/test (&optional arg) (interactive "P") (let ((restr (cond ((equal arg '(4)) 'buffer) ((equal arg '(16)) 'subtree)))) (when (symbolp restr) (message "Yes")))) 
 So I'm going wrong somewhere, but cannot figure out where.

 I tried to bind C-= to er/expand-region from the expand-region package but nothing happens when I press C-=.

 For example a bare text-mode buffer C-h k C-= C-p previous-line.
 Further, if i try binding C-S-= the same situation - it's ignored. Yet binding C-+ works so when I press C-S-= what is bound to C-+ executes.

 The only way for us to continue improvement, fix bugs, optimize code, and provide additional features to benefit the use or org is to have people out in the real world using it and breaking it. So, my brave friends, use it, and break it good. Break it real good.
 Get your freaky org game on, now! - https://codeberg.org/anoduck/org-orgzly
 Org-Orgzly is awesome!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone, I am working on a Haskell project using cabal. It is a simple executable cabal project with a Main.hs file which imports a few other .hs files.
 Whenever I build it using cabal new-run, the imported source files seem to only get recompiled if something that depends on them changes in Main.hs. This is the case regardless of whether they have been edited since the last compilation.
 How can I change this behavior? Am I doing something wrong? Surely I should be able to edit the imported files and have the changes be reflected upon compiling the project?
 My workaround as of now is to systematically delete, before each compilation, all the files generated by cabal during the last one, which I am sure is not the intended way.
 Sorry if my question is dumb; as might be apparent I don't know much about the compilation process but I'd be happy to know more.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Kinda clickbait title, but I'll go with it. I'm someone who's familiar with both functional and oo paradigm and have experience working on industrial/research project with both. Although I work with different languages and paradigms for work and study purposes, I personally prefer Haskell over other languages I work with.
 Recently, I decided to learn a new language (for fun, for job hunt etc) and am thinking of Scala. Since I love Haskell, I wanted to start with Functional Programming in Scala. However, seems like the book doesn’t cover Scala 3. Should I worry about it and use some other resource? Or should I just go with Scala 2.x?
 Also, since I haven’t started learning, I'd appreciate if you let me know if I should learn it or something else (maybe "Go for elixir since you like strictly functional stuff")?
 Thanks!
 Edit: Thank you all for your valuable comments. I made up my mind to give Scala a try. Probably I will start with 2.x and move to 3 after getting some head around it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone, I'm making a compiler for a Computer Science class for a fairly simple language based on pascal (Pascal-0).
 In this language, we have a few reserved keywords, the thing is, they are case-insensitive (as are the variables). That means that for example, function, FUNCTION and funCTiOn all mean the same thing.
 As these are reserved keywords, I can easily "hard-code" them into the Lexer with something like this:
 function { \_ -> FUNCTION } 
 But this obviously is not case insensitive.
 I found a possible way to do it with maps, but I really would prefer to do it via regex if possible.
 Obviously, I can also do something like:
  (f|F)(u|U) ... (o|O)(n|N) 
 but that's obviously out of the question as it is not scalable.
 Is this at all possible, and is there a better way to do it other than maps, if regex isn't possible?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'd like to have a completing-read type command that can perform commonly used file moving/copying operations. For example, I'm constantly syncing a couple of projects to a remote machine where they run. Currently I bind a key for each one to an rsync shell command call like so:
 (defun myprojectA-sync () (interactive) (shell-command (concat "rsync -a --progress --exclude-from='~/myprojectA/.syncignore' ~/myprojectA/ remotemachine1:~/myprojectA/ && echo 'Done.'")))) (map! :leader :desc "Sync my project A from local machine" "c b" #'myprojectA-sync) 
 It'd be helpful to have one single command to call a completion list that can run the pre-defined file operations for Project A, B, C, etc. I don't see why they couldn't act on multiple machines (remotemachine1, remotemachine2, etc.) or use different commands (mv, scp, rsync, etc.).
 Is there some feature/package that already exists to do something like this? 
 If not, does anyone have suggestions for a novice in elisp when it comes to writing the function? My thoughts so far were just a bunch of lists like
 (setq sync-names '("Sync project A" "Sync project B")) (setq sync-method '("rsync" "scp")) (setq sync-dest-dir '("remotemachine1:~/dir1" "remotemachine2:~/otherdir")) 
 to call shell-command wrapped in competing-read.

I'm building Emacs from source on Mac OS, 12.4 w/ M1.
 
I'm configuring Emacs with native compilation.
 
  ./configure --with-native-compilation \ --with-ns \ --disable-silent-rules 
  
The build succeeds, src/emacs runs like a charm and I make install.
 
My nextstep/Emacs.app runs, but emits a ton of libgccjit.so: error: error invoking gcc driver errors to the Messages buffer.
 
 I suspect the Emacs.app package has some misconfigured paths that are unable to find my libgccjit library, which I've installed via homebrew. I've tried experimenting with exec-path-from-shell to ensure Emacs is aware of my shell paths, but to no avail.
 In the meantime, I've been able to use emacs and emacsclient from the CLI with no issues to speak of. The only problems arise when I interact with the Emacs.app application. Anyone have an idea as to what's going on here?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm using GADTs to model the domain of my programme, and quite enjoying the experience, but have found that it requires quite a lot of boilerplate.
 For example, I am building a series of "filter" functions which filter input datatypes:
  data MyType = TypeOne | TypeTwo data MyEntity (t :: MyType) where MyEntityOne :: String -> MyEntity 'TypeOne MyEntityTwo :: String -> String -> MyEntity 'TypeTwo 
 I can create input filters which I can nicely compose with a fish (>=>) operator:
  filterOnes :: forall a. MyEntity a -> Maybe (MyEntity 'TypeOne) filterOnes x@(MyEntityOne {}) = Just x filterOnes _ = Nothing 
 The thing is, I'm finding writing this sort of case a bit tedious, and it would be much nicer to have something like this:
  filterOnes = filterFor @'TypeOne -- or, even better myFilter :: forall a. MyEntity a -> Maybe (MyEntity 'TypeOne) myFilter = (filterFor @'TypeOne) >=> someOtherFilter 
 But I don't know how to create something like this, which reminds me of the generic-lens library. I feel like this might be a common pattern with GADTs, is there an obvious solution?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone! I've got some exciting news to share.
 Earlier this year, I've released the first version of HVM, a massively parallel functional runtime that aims to be the ultimate target for pure functional languages like Haskell, Elm, Kind and many others, and finally unleash the inherent parallelism of the functional paradigm. HVM's first version was very limited; it could only parallelize algorithms that recursed in a perfect binary tree fashion, it lacked IO and had some synchronization bugs. Soon, we'll be releasing an updated version, which fixes these bugs, includes IO primitives, and a new workstealing-based scheduler, which is capable of generalizing to basically any functional program that isn't inherently sequential. For example, it can use all cores on the computation of Fib(n), achieving maximal performance!
 The most exciting news, though, is that a GPU runtime is on the works. I've just, right now, finished the very initial prototype, a self-contained, 1200-LOC file that evaluates a busy recursive function on the GPU. It is performing about 680 million rewrites/second on 4096 cores of my Laptop RTX 3080. That's 4x more than single-thread performance, on the very first attempt of the very first prototype. I believe we'll soon be reaching record benchmarks on GPUs. Several API improvements and stability features will also be included on the upcoming update.
 We're ahead of very exiting times for functional programming, and I hope this encourages language developers to target the HVM! Imagine a working STG->HVM compiler? We're also interested in hiring a CUDA professional to help us profile and improve the GPU back-end. If you know someone who'd be interested, please let me know via DM! And be welcome to visit our Discord community and ask anything on the #HVM channel.

 This was an especially noticeable deficiency when trying selectrum with projectile-find-file - I couldn't open my dotfiles and type "init" to find "init.el", as it seemed to want me to specify the entire path preceding it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been using emacs to write tex documents for a long time, and recently switched to spacemacs, with evil mode. I use the reftex command reftex-reference to insert \ref commands. In spacemacs evil mode, when I use this, the reference is inserted *before* the cursor (point), so that it's off by one character. I would like to know if it's possible to configure this to insert after. I'm asking here because I think this is a general evil-mode issue rather than a specific spacemacs configuration issue. Details below.
 Here's what happens:
 Have a tex file with some text like the following, with the cursor at the rectangle marker, and with the buffer in evil's "normal state" (like vim's normal mode), not insert mode.
 \begin{theorem}\label{mylabel} theorem text \end{theorem} Now some words▮ 
 Note that this is what happens when there's a space *after* "words" in the text; in evil's normal state, the cursor is a block that occupies the position of a character.
 Then I use the reftex-reference command and select "mylabel". The inserted text I get is
 Now some words\ref{mylabel}▮ 
 with the inserted \ref *before* the trailing space. Then the space appears *after*. I believe the line that actually does the inserting is line 510 of reftex-ref.el.
 ​
 To be clear, this is not because the final character is a space. If I delete the space after "words", positioning my cursor on the final "s", then the inserted reference looks like
 Now some word\ref{mylabel}s 
 with the cursor positioned on the final "s".
 ​
 So, the problem seems to be that reftex-reference is doing the insertion on the *left* side of the "normal state" cursor, not the right. I would like it to insert on the right. Does anyone here know how this can be configured?
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I guess this is a rhetorical question because I doubt anyone knows why but it turns out that dired buffers return nil for buffer-file-name instead of the path to the directory they are viewing.
 I believe this has cost me a ton of time but I did learn a lot along the way. lsp-docker highest level function is lsp-docker-start. It calls lsp-workspace-root which calls buffer-file-name which, if starting from a dired buffer, returns nil so lsp-workspace-root returns nil and the LSP server is not started.
 This is my first venture into LSP mode and I was doing something slightly different, a basic low level function was returning nil, so I assumed I was way off track in my set up, and I needed to dig deeper. And, indeed, I came up with a solution. I was documenting what I had found for myself so I wouldn't forget and started asking myself more questions.
 I went back and tested lsp-workspace-root in a file that had LSP mode enabled and it returned the proper path for the workspace. I then restarted everything, loaded lsp-mode but didn't start it, and went to the directory of the project. Sure enough, lsp-workspace-root returned nil (as it had before). I then looked at the code and started to try and follow it step by step. That's when I discovered that dired buffers have no buffer-file-name. I opened TAGS (an arbitrary file within the project) and now lsp-workspace-root returns the proper workspace.
 I think I could have set up my LSP stuff with a simple YAML file had I tried lsp-docker-start from a file rather than a dired buffer and saved the time spent coming up with the solution I pointed to.
 Anyhow... live and learn I guess.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To add to the list of Haskell wishes I posted yesterday: instance derivation for variable size tuples.
 That each tuple size has to be treated separately is really annoying. A lot of effort has been spent on much less important (= less common) problems, it certainly can be solved somehow with the syntax for variable type tuple size + extended tuple size... Actually maybe I'm just reinventing some existing wheel, but I've never seen it used.
 For example:
 class Encoding a where encode :: a -> String 
 Now I have to do:
 instance Encoding (a, b) where encode (a, b) = encode a <> encode b instance Encoding (a, b, c) where encode (a, b, c) = encode a <> encode b <> encode c -- and so on until the limit of either tuple size or patience is reached 
 You can see code like this across endless number of libraries, including base
 Why cannot I instead have something like this:
 instance Encoding (a, b) where encode (a, b) = encode a <> encode b instance Encoding (..., b) where encode (a@..., b) = encode a <> encode b 
 Never mind the specific syntax, it can be whatever, but the idea is to define instance for all tuple sizes recursively.
 Is it maybe possible already?
 That would also require (and allow) some size-polymorphic operations to add/split the first/last tuple elements, in a type safe way.
 I've no idea why it doesn't already exist.

 I am wondering whether someone has used org-mode as a basis for publishing documentation of Python projects via Sphinx. Actually, I am looking for a workflow to write my documentation in org-mode, convert it to .md or .rst, add Sphinx' autodoc-extension and finally publish the result with GitHub Pages. 
 Has somebody done something like that? Thanks...

 I am watching Rainer König's video on scheduling, deadlines and agenda view. I cannot use the agenda view. One of the comments says:
 Quick tips, the keybinding for agenda view has to be setted on the init file. Standard recommendation seems to be :
 (global-set-key "\C-cl" 'org-store-link)
 (global-set-key "\C-ca" 'org-agenda)
 (global-set-key "\C-cc" 'org-capture)
 (global-set-key "\C-cb" 'org-iswitchb)

 C-c [

 I can't quite figure how to search across all the documentation for a specific word or regex if possible. 
 Example: I know that org-clock-report table (or clocktable) has :narrow param. I initially found it in google but now, since I know it exists, how can I quickly find info about this param directly in emacs? For example I want to find a manual page where this param is mentioned. Is there anything like apropos-EVERYTHING command that will look for a word (or regex) in all documentation? 
 Even more. I now know that info about :narrow param for clock table can be found in org manual on a page called The clock table. I know it from google. How could I find this page using emacs? 
 How would you find that page in emacs manual?
 P.S. I know about describe-* and apropos-* (and info) functions but I don't see any function that does the search across everything. There are also similar questions in the internet and there is a suggestion to search the documentation with grep or zgrep which I don't find useful. They just search in *.info files which when opened don't behave as info pages. Is greping the only way?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've seen developers expensing a Sublime Text / JetBrains license to their employer, no questions asked. It would be amazing if one could similarly contribute financially towards emacs development efforts. 
 Would it be possible to cook up something formal enough (through FSF or some other org) like an annual "Emacs support license" with a couple of different tiers based on amounts (such that users can choose the split to different projects of interest). Users might then be able to expense it at work with the justification that it helps improve the specific packages they depend on (including core emacs). The same "licenses" could equally well serve as a portal for personal donations, but I feel that there's likely substantial low-hanging fruit in getting corporate funding in this grassroots manner.
 (I've pondered about this before, but some questions on the emacs survey reminded me of this again.)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm currently switching my package management from Debian to Guix, and so far it's been wonderful. However, I just found something very curious. In the screenshot, you can see my 'old' self compiled Emacs (28.1) and my new Emacs (28.2) installed via Guix. They render the same text in the same file, in the same theme, with the same font (as per M-x describe-font), but they look quite different.
 Here's a screenshot showing the two side by side: https://screenshots.200ok.ch/screenshot_2022_10_26-a7bdddc0.png
 The version to the left is quite thin, the weight seems off. However, the weight is the same. Changing the weight will not remove this discrepancy. 
 Both Debian and Guix have the bold variant of Fira installed: https://screenshots.200ok.ch/screenshot_2022_10_26-36be0060.png
 Generally speaking, the bold variant works insofar that I can use it globally: https://screenshots.200ok.ch/screenshot_2022_10_26-5620acc4.png
 However, when used in a font-face, it won't become bold: https://screenshots.200ok.ch/screenshot_2022_10_26-bb7ddfd5.png
 I'm happy if anyone can point me to the necessary change to make the new install look the same as before. Thank you for your help!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[​
 Hi everyone, 
 ​
 I'm trying to write an elisp function that allows me to more easily query org-roam database with various keywords.
 ​
 Suppose I want to find all the titles that contain both "hello" and "world", I know this can be done with a single query instance like the following:
 ​
 (org-roam-db-query [:select * :from titles
 :where (and (like title "%hello%")
 (like title "%world%")) ] )
 ​
 Now I'm trying to turn this into an elisp function to make it easier to use. However, the challenge is my queries can contain an arbitrary number of keywords, for example:
 (org-roam-db-query [:select * :from titles
 :where (and (like title "%hello%")
 (like title "%world%") 
 (like title "%again%")) ] )
 ​
 The function should thus accept a list of keywords and return the notes that contains ALL the keywords in that list, something like:
 ​
 my-func('("hello" "world")) -> should return all notes containing "hello" "world"
 my-func('("hello" "world" "again")) -> should return all notes containing "hello" "world" "again"
 ​
 Can anyone suggest how to implement such a function?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hoping someone proficient in Haskell can give me some pointers on a homework assignment I'm currently bashing my head against. We're currently covering higher order functions, and our professor wants us to write a function that acts as a form of simple memory storage. Here's the part of the assignment that's stumping me:
 -- We'll consider a different way to represent memory. Memoryf is a function from variable names to values. type Memoryf = String -> Int -- The function memf1 gives all variables the value of zero memf1 = \_ -> 0 -- The following commands use the function putValue to modify our memory function: memf2 = putValuef "z" 3 memf1 memf3 = putValuef "y" (-2) memf2 memf4 = putValuef "x" 1 memf3 -- putValue should take three arguments: -- 1. The name of a variable, x -- 2. The variable value m -- 3. A Memoryf function -- putValue should assign x to m and return the updated Memoryf function putValue :: String -> Int -> Memoryf -> Memoryf putValue x m memf = _________________________ -- Write your code here -- Example output: -- (putValue "x" 5 memf4) "x" -- 5 
 My thinking is that calling putValue should add something to the effect of "if memf x is called, return m" but I have no idea how to write this. The furthest I've gotten is:
 putValue :: String -> Int -> Memoryf -> Memoryf putValue x m memf = (\x -> m) 
 which is useless because it will return the value of m for any variable, and thus doesn't work as a store of value.
 I'd greatly appreciate any guidance y'all have to offer. I'm giving myself a headache trying to sort through this myself.

 I most likely won't move back to projectile with this information, but may implement any very compelling features atop project.el.

 ​
 Is anyone able to compile on the latest MacOS?
 ​
 So far, I've been unable to link the libgccjit hello world: https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/jit/intro/tutorial01.html
 The farthest I can get is to the following errors:
 gcc-11: warning: could not understand version '13.00.00'
 ld: -rpath can only be used when targeting Mac OS X 10.5 or later
 collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status
 At which point, it seems as if the problems are inherent to gcc-11 in combination with MacOS's ld. Anyone able to make this work?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yesterday I was trying lsp-mode. After getting a bit annoyed with my laptop's fan always getting activated, I decided to try eglot. So far it feels much more lightweight.
 I'm having trouble getting it to do some things though.
 For context, I use pyvenv to manage my virtual environments:
 (use-package pyvenv:ensure t:config(pyvenv-mode 1)(pyvenv-activate "~/miniconda3/envs/myenv/"))
 I have done both conda install python-lsp-server[all] -c conda-forge and conda install pyright in this environment.
 If I use pyright-langserver, then a lot of imports are "unknown".
 If I use pylsp, then those imports seem to work, but I get some funny autocompletion behaviour. 
 import numpy as np
 np.lin
 This says "no completion found". But
 from numpy import linalg
 linalg.
 This works as expected, and I get reasonable suggestions for completions.
 ​
 Can someone tell me what's going on here and I to get this working? I was hoping things would work right out of the box, but...

 I recently switched to straight.el mostly for packages contributing purposes and it works really great. 
 In my init.el I sometimes use package-installed-p function to check if package is installed but straight.el doesn't install packages "emacs way" so that function always return nil. I expect there should be similar function in straight.el but I can't find one. 
 Do you know if it's exists? 
 Thanks
 EDIT: There is straight--installed-p but it expects a RECIPE and I don't really understand what is this. Definitely not a package name

 My usual workflow is that I'm working on a project (with .projectile in the root directory), and at some point I need to working on files outside of this project.
 I'll then C-x 5 2 to create a new frame and start opening files there. Then I switch buffers, and what I see are all my buffers.
 Is there a way in which I could group/filter buffers based on some default criteria? For example, if the buffer belongs to a project (with a .projectile file), filter those buffers into one group. 
 Or better yet, simply add filters so that I can stay organized.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I use doom emacs and it offers [ ], [-] and [X] as part of the org-todo-keywords.
 In the org-agenda I noticed that the state changes for these states are not listed with the corresponding time when org-agenda-log-mode is active.
 Here is an example to display what it looks like instead:
 Tuesday 25 October 2022 inbox: 10:00 ┄┄┄┄┄ State: (DONE) DONE Test1 TODO -> DONE inbox: State: ([X]) [X] Test2 [ ] -> [X] 
 The headline with Test2 is displayed without the time. Both headlines have a LOGBOOK drawer that does look the same.
 * DONE Test1 TODO -> DONE :LOGBOOK: - State "DONE" from "TODO" [2022-10-25 Tue 10:00] :END * [X] Test2 [ ] -> [X] :LOGBOOK: - State "[X]" from "[ ]" [2022-10-25 Tue 10:00] :END 
 Further it seems like all todo keywords that start with [ and end with ] are not displayed with the corresponding time but below the time-grid with State: in front like seen above.
 I believe I tracked down the function that generates the State: entries (https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs/blob/9bfe00dda6b59d9b93eb7a825f6e0868afa1cca3/lisp/org/org-agenda.el#L5943) but I am not really able to understand the function and what is causing this behavior as I am fairly new to emacs/elisp
 Is there someway to show the tasks with the checkbox style todo keywords with time?
 Is this a bug or a feature that I can configure?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During my internship at Tweag, I got the opportunity to work on Chainsail (see the announcement blog post), a web service that helps to sample from multimodal probability distributions.
A common approach to sampling well-behaved distributions involves Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods derived from the
basic Metropolis-Hastings algorithm; building a Markov chain that has the desired distribution as its stationary distribution.
The major benefit of Metropolis-Hastings over more “direct” sampling methods is that it doesn’t require the target distribution to be normalized.
But it does have a big flaw:
if the distribution presents multiple modes separated by areas of low probability, the Markov chain tends to get stuck in one mode, and thus samples the distribution incorrectly.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Since its initial release (corresponding thread) the library has got several improvements (the current version is 2.2.0.0), but the most significant development happened within the ecosystem. Here's the list of new adapter libraries:
  
crypto-rng-effectful - generation of cryptographically secure random bytes and numbers.
 
log-effectful - structured logging with multiple backends.
 
hpqtypes-effectful - access to a PostgreSQL database.
 
retry-effectful - combinators for monadic actions that may fail.
 
 It's worth noting that all of these are light wrappers over existing libraries, not rewrites. As advertised, effectful makes it easy to adapt libraries to be used as effects.
 Also, the Monocle project has moved to effectful.
 If anyone was skeptical about effectful, maybe that'll convince you to give it another look. I'm sure this is just the beginning :)

 - much more adopted than Erlang and F#, I thought Haskell is used less frequently than these.
 - has almost as many projects as Elixir in GitHub, but much more popular on Stack Overflow - shows the strength of the community.

 Looking at this chart I think we can get Haskell into the top 10 (or even 5) languages by solving several problems, as community (I do have a vested interest that it happens – our SimpleX Chat is written in Haskell):
 - make JSON a first class citizen in Haskell code, ideally with some syntax-level support, without requiring QQ, rather than one of the most complex to use libraries. It doesn't seem a coincidence that 2 most popular languages - JavaScript and Python - make it really easy to integrate with JSON.
 - make cross-platform compilation "manageable" (including mobile and web), not just "possible".
 - solve problem of compiled binary size - it should be at least 5x, better 10x smaller – even if it comes at cost of 10x longer compilation time (so that we would only use it for production builds).
 - at the same time, make interpreted tests execution simpler - I still can't figure out how to do it, waiting for several minutes until it builds with most cores idling is very time consuming... Maybe this is a solved problem, and there is a simple answer how to do it.
 - make networking and cryptography more trustworthy - with exodus of some maintainers into Rust-land they are at risk of abandonment – I will share more comments on this subject a bit later.
 ​
 These are all issues that Haskell Foundation and community can help solving, we could chip in some time/money too if there is some concerted effort.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm looking for suggestions for how to manage repeated tasks with subtasks. Ideally, I'd like to be able to mark the parent heading as done and have all the DONE subtasks (or even better, those without a certain property) be changed to TODO. In practice, what I want is to be able to move from this: 
 * TODO Meal plan for the week SCHEDULED: <2022-10-24 +1w> ** DONE Make list of dishes ** DONE Make grocery list ** DONE Get groceries 
 to this: 
 * TODO Meal plan for the week SCHEDULED: <2022-10-31 +1w> ** TODO Make list of dishes ** TODO Make grocery list ** TODO Get groceries 
 after marking the heading task as done. 
 I suspect I could make use of org-todo-repeat-hook and define a function that will take all the sub-tasks of a given task and change them from e.g. DONE to TODO, or to the TODO state the parent will be in after repeat, e.g. 
 (defun my/org--bequeath-state () (let ((state (org-get-todo-state))) (org-map-entries (lambda () (org-todo state)) nil 'tree))) (add-to-list 'org-todo-repeat-hook 'my/org--bequeath-state) 
 But I'm wondering if anyone has given this more thought and has a better conceived solution they'd be willing to share.

The number of options is a bit overwhelming, but a lot of signs are pointing towards using lsp with pyright and lsp-ui. So that's what I've been doing, along with using pyvenv to choose my virtual environments. But I've noticed that I don't get any warnings if my lines are too long. I'm not sure why this is? Does it have to do with my settings, or is this not something lsp/pyright should catch?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A year or two ago, straight.el was probably the most recommended package manager for GNU Emacs. As I’ve revisited my configuration today, I noticed that there are a few recent package managers (namely, leaf and elpaca) which are new to - at least - me and (at least elpaca) want to be straight.el’s “successor”.
 Is there any write-up about the state of GNU Emacs package management in 2022? Straight.el works for me (and I need its custom build features for two packages), but I don’t want to rely on deprecated packages for too long.

 I have searched in web, and found that Flycheck is using wrong dir, but i don't know how customize that. Is there some option to Flycheck work well on Django?
 pylint has an module named pylint-django. Can be this enhabled in Flycheck?
 Edit: I found solution that works to me for now, but isn't automatic.
 1) Install pylint-django pluging with pip pip install pylint-django
 2) Create a pylint config file in the root directory of project. You can do thi from terminal
 pylint --generate-rcfile > .pylintrc
 3)Enhable Django pluging in pylint config file in "load-plugins" line
 load-plugins=pylint_django
 That worked to me. When you start flychek in current buffer, you can see if flycheck is using the config file:

 2) Spark advices any general advice? any advice on how to best use dataframes with Spark in this project? are there general things to be careful of in order not to have bad performances?
 how would it be better to return the results of a query considering that I will have to create a graphical interface?
 3) query tips I use a flight dataset. What might be some interesting aggregate queries to do? I have a lot of columns, so a lot of information about each flight

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[From October 24th to November 30th, the 2022 edition of the Emacs User survey will be collecting responses!
 📋 https://emacssurvey.org/
 About the Survey
 This time there are no non-free Javascript or user-tracking caveats as this features a bespoke survey framework written from scratch for the Emacs User Survey to support a pure HTML-forms + CSS approach with server-side rendering 🎉.
 See the FAQ for more information on the survey itself.
 Promoting the survey
 It would be fantastic for this to be shared as far and wide as possible, to get responses from a large swathe of the community. If you can share this with the non-Reddit Emacs communities you are a part of, as well as any friends or colleagues that use Emacs that would be greatly appreciated 😊.
 So far the Survey has been shared on: - Reddit - Hacker News - Lobste.rs
 Addendum: all my responses are shown as missing?
 It has been noticed by several people that their results page shows some or all of their answers to be missing for questions they answered. In every case I've checked so far, all responses did get recorded in the database, but there seems to be a glitch that is occurring in some cases with the display/export of results.
 TLDR; Do not worry, your answers are safe.

 I am currently using Org mode to try and write a JET SOP/ write fantasy books or whatever. However, When trying to navigate through the text instead of going through each line, it jumps through each paragraph in chunks. 
 I know that this is due to "word wrap" and that technically it is all one giant line. But how does one change this behavior. I know a few days ago when I tested Visual Studio code I got the same issue. 
 (ignore my bad writing, this is super duper early) 
 TL:DR: how to change function of emacs to make it act more like a traditional word processor?

 Then I started using `next-buffer` and `previous-buffer` and developing an intuition for what buffer would show up.
 It's made my experience of using emacs drastically better in the same way that learning `ctrl+tab` and `ctrl+shift+tab` in web browsers made my browsing experience better. Maybe these kinds of feelings are very subjective, but I feel like this one might generalize to others experiences well.
 By default they are bound to `C-x <left>` and `C-x <right>`.
 Feel free to also share any similar other "wow this makes buffer management so much nicer feeling to use" experiences you've had.

 The :file link created by org-attach when org-attach-store-link-p is non-nil should be to the attachment, not to the original. In fact the link is to the original, not to the attachment. I believe this is a bug.
 DETAILS
 I've noticed some unexpected behavior in terms of the link that org-attach creates and places in org-stored-links when org-attach-store-link-p is non-nil. I'm seeing it when the method of attachment is move, copy, or symlink, either via org-attach-method, or when chosen directly when running C-c C-a. (I haven't tested any of the others.) The issue concerns the target of the created link.
 My expectation is that the target of such a link should point to the actual attachment itself. By that I mean, the target should be the path to the file or link in its place in th…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I'm very new to org-mode although it already looks like something that I've been trying to invent myself (in much more lame ways) for many years.
 One thing that I don't immediately see from them the manual - is there some "standard" or well-know way to work with the outline-organized data that have multiple dimensions?
 Here is what I mean by that:
 Say, I have a lab diary where I track number of processes - each process every day:
 * Day 1 ** Morning sync up meeting with the team my notes on it ** Ongoing Experiment 1 checking out the night results, trying new approaches ** Something else ... * Day 2 ** Morning sync up meeting with the team ... ** Ongoing Experiment 1 ... ** Something else ... * Day 3 ... 
 And this is how it goes!
 So, the first dimension here is the timeline: Day 1, Day 2, ... while the second one is the processes that repeat every day.
 Clearly, depending on task, it would be handy to see this outline from the different points of view: sometimes considering the "time" dimension to be the outer one, sometimes to see the "process" dimension to be the outer:
 Time dimension is outer:
 * Day 1 ** Process 1 ** Process 2 ... * Day 2 ... 
 Process dimension is outer:
 * Process 1 ** Day 1 ** Day 2 ... * Process 2 ... 
 One can easily come up with a case of three or for dimensions like. E.g. "Date/[Home|Work]/Habit/Successes".
 Turning the tree inside out to follow the day by day progress for one of experiments would be very helpful. As well as tracking the daily successes in the second example.
 Is there a built-in feature or packages or a known workflow for such case?
 Like best practice(s) for such data organization, turning the outline inside out, making different OLAP-like views into the outline?
 thanks :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been tinkering with making simple interfaces with transient and tabulated-list-mode, things like a list of scripts with some information on them as columns, and key bindings/transients to edit, lint or execute them. While this is nice, for something more elaborate tabulated-list-mode is not enough. I am trying to get a view inspired by magit's status buffer, so I thought I could use magit-section for this. However, I couldn't find any guides on how to make something with it, and I am not savy enough to extract the exact usage from the magit code (I did try).
 So my question is, does anyone have any guides or any simple elisp code that I can use for reference to create a new derived mode out of magit-section?
 Edit: Fixed formatting.

 When I try to export an org file to pdf it always gives the error: Stopping because of bad filename. 
 Latexmk: Filename '~/notes/exports/20220825222250-beamer_presentation_example.tex' contains character not allowed for TeX file. Latexmk: Stopping because of bad filename(s). 
 I believe it is because the home directory is specified with a tilde character. 
 How can I fix this error?

 I download mail with mbsync, manage it with mu4e, and send it with SMTP. This all works fine and has for years.
 Except that I find that I suddenly have to deal with email hosted on office365. It does IMAP, so I can read my mail, but it warns
 `Notice: far side store does not support flag(s) 'P'; not propagating.`
 The consequence of this is that the changes I make locally aren't reflected on the server. Refiling or deleting mail doesn't have any effect. That means my INBOX is just going to grow and grow and grow and eventually that's going to be a problem. (Nevermind that if I decide to peek at my mail from my phone or something, it's going to be a confusing mess.)
 In a previous life, I managed with davmail, but dear $DEITY in heaven, I'd really rather not have to do that again.
 Anyone know if mbsync (or the office365 account) can be configured to make things Work Right(TM)?

 My current setup involves Kontact for IMAP and EWS.
 All the setups I've seen so far do download/sync all Emails from the IMAP server. Is it possible only download the headers and then the full emails on demand? My current setup is that I keep my Emails on the IMAP server and fetch only what I want to read.
 Akonadi does this quite good.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm creating a game where several "walkers" (and other objects) are positioned on a board. ``` data Dir = N | E | S | W deriving (Eq, Ord, Show, Enum, Bounded)
 data Pos = Pos { x :: Int, y :: Int} deriving (Eq, Ord, Show)
 data Object = Object { pos :: Pos, dir :: Dir} deriving (Eq, Ord)
 -- An Walker is an object with a position and a direction. newtype Walker = Walker Object newtype Exit = Exit Object newtype Entry = Entry Object ```
 In order to move them, I have a function that takes a list of walkers all located on the same tile. Several walkers can be on the same tile, in which case they collide.
  -- this function takes a list of walkers with the same position. move :: [Walker] -> [Walker] move ws = ... 
 I'm not so satisfied with this solution, because the pre-condition (all located at the same position) is not reflected. I'm thinking of several solutions to express/enforce the condition: 1. Use a guard 2. Decompose the first argument 3. Use refined types
 Use a guard
 I could use a guard to enforce my pre-condition:  move :: [Walker] -> [Walker] move ws | isSamePos ws = ... move _ = error "All walkers must have the same position" 
 It's an OK solution, however it's a pity that the types don't help us and look clumsy.
 Decompose the first argument
 I could decompose the first argument to express the fact that they all have the same position:  move :: Pos -> [Dir] -> [Walker] move pos dirs = ... 
 It's an interesting solution because now illegal states are unrepresentable. However, I lost the idea that my inputs are walkers and not anything else.
 Use refined types
 I couldn't install Liquid Haskell, but I guess the solution would look like:  {-@ move :: SamePosList Walker -> [Walker] @-} move :: [Walker] -> [Walker] move ws = ... 
 It seems overkill :)
 What is your opinion? Thanks!

 Several walkers can be located on the same tile, in which case they collide. To manage this, I have a function that will move them. This function takes a list of walkers all located at the same position, and calculate their next position:  -- this function takes a list of walkers that are at the same position. move :: [Walker] -> [Walker] move ws = ... 
 I'm not very satisfied with this function, because the pre-condition (walkers must be at the same position) is not encoded in the type. I'm thinking of several solutions: 1. Encode the precondition as a guard 2. Decompose the argument 3. Enforce property with refined types
 Encode the precondition as a guard
  move :: [Walker] -> [Walker] move ws | isSamePos ws = ... move _ = error "All walkers must be at the same position".  It's an OK solution, however it's a pity that the type doesn't help you.
 Decompose the argument
 I could decompose the list of walkers, removing the redundant part (they all have the same position):  move :: Pos -> [Dir] -> [Walker] move pos dirs = ...  That solution is interesting, because illegal states are now unrepresentable. However, I lost the idea that the input is a walker.
 Enforce property with refined types
 I could use Liquid Haskell to check the precondition using a SAT solver. I'm not quite sure how to write it, it seems a bit overkill.

 a package that i am using defines an a-list of various font properties f.e. 'family', 'weight', 'height' etc. etc.
 i want to set values to these properties progammatically, f.e. on linux + my-home-machine i would want to set 'family' to say "Iosevka Mono", on my laptop i would use a high-dpi friendly font etc.
 i wrote a trivial function like so:
  (defun util:get-host-default-font-family () "return host specific font-family" (interactive) (cond ((utils:host-name-is "host-01") Iosevka Mono") ((utils:host-name-is "host-02") "Go Mono Regular") ((t "Consolas")))) 
 the "utils:host-name-is <name-of-host>" returns 'true' when current hostname matches the provided argument, 'false' otherwise. the above function does the right thing when called interactively on different hosts. 
 however, when i use it like so
  (:default-family (util:get-host-default-font-family)) 
 i get a
  Wrong type argument: stringp, (util:get-host-default-font-family) 
 how do i fix it ?
 
 thanks !

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In my config https://github.com/vidbina/dotfiles/tree/reorg-for-lit-prog/emacs#-text you may spot that I use visual-fill-column-mode and adaptive-wrap-mode to improve the readability of text in Emacs.
 ⚠️ The gotcha is that I sometimes have bits of context that I want to exclude from being "wrapped" such as tables. My current UX on this is poor as I usually want to see the table fully extended while simultaneously sneaking a peak at text in the paragraphs around it. Is there a way to do this (exclude a region from being wrapped) or is there a term that describes what I'm looking for that I should factor into my web-search queries?
 🤔 There is never really a use case where the wrapped table is even readable for me so it's just a lost piece of screen real estate when I wrap the buffer. It may as well be folded away to be conjured up through something similar to C-c C-v v where can open expanded code into a preview buffer (to see how all the noweb refs resolve). How do you deal with wrapping when tables are present? Hoping to learn what I can improve about my usage to minimize this "pain".
 💡 For now I keep toggling between the wrapped and non-wrapped states and now that I'm typing this, I'm thinking that I can open a cloned frame or buffer. That way I can show the table non-wrapped or extended in one buffer, while I look at the wrapped peripheral text in a cloned buffer and thus have a way to keep the wrapped states apart. This however does alter the layout of buffers which is again a bit of a UX killer as it disturbs the y-flow of the text in the original buffer if you catch my drift.
 Looking fwd to getting schooled. Thanks for helping think along. 🙏🏿

 Relatively new to emacs. I'm looking to use emacs speaks statistics and take advantage of using polymode and quarto mode (https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-emacs) which best I can tell is a version of polymode that allows using quarto based documents.
 So far I can build the quarto document and output a html window, but if I try to run individual chunks or pieces of code it doesn't work. The github page states it uses ESS by default but when I try to use the ESS run commands I get Wrong type argument: window-live-p, nil. I've googled this error message but haven't seen anything similar so far.
 I've also tried having polymode itself enabled with quarto mode and on its own, and using the polymode run chunks command but I get a similar error message.
 Anyone have any ideas or potential solutions?
 Thanks in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently released Tecton, a new DSL for authoring CSS. My goal for this project is to make "CSS in PureScript" more practical for real-world use cases, meaning: * Extensive type-level validation * Minimal syntactic overhead * Broad CSS coverage * Alignment with W3C specifications * Exhaustive testing
 If you're interested to take a look, a good place to start might be the Zen Garments example, adapted from Dan Mall's CSS Zen Garden submission in order to assess the library's CSS coverage.
 From there, you might like to see some examples of CSS errors that will fail to compile. Some of these issues are significantly more complicated than e.g. providing a <length-percentage> value where a <length> was expected (although those cases are covered too).
 Hopefully the next step would be to try it out for yourself, using the large test suite as a reference wherever the (WIP) docs currently fall short.
 I am looking forward to any feedback you might have to offer! I would also like to note that contributions are welcome, so please let me know if you are interested via Twitter or [email](mailto:nick@saunde.rs); or, if you have something specific in mind already, just review the contributing guidelines and then open an issue.
 Thanks for reading!

 There is an Emacs option for the color of the mouse cursor, but the option for the size doesn't exist in Emacs 27.2 .
 Is it possible to change the size of the cursor for EXWM?

 I can only guess that the Doom sessions orChemacs2 sessions read some compiled scripts in that directory which are not compatible with them. From the Doom docs, there is an EMACSDIR environment variable that is supposed to be the ~/.emacs.d directory for that Doom session.
 After reading the docs I have decided to run doom install with --doomdir, --emacsdir, and I am also configuring the Chemacs2 ~/.emacs-profiles.el to set the relevant environment variables as described in https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/xs0avw/a_way_to_manage_multiple_doom_profiles_with/, which now includes more variables.
 Moving forward I am also adding the EMACSDIR option.
 Should these options reduce the risk of a shared ~/.emacs.d/eln-cache/28-xxxxx?

 Before I jump right into learning fs2, I would like to understand its bigger picture. However, I haven't been able to find any useful information about what are the possible use cases of fs2, for what we can use this awesome library, and so on.
 To my understanding, fs2 is used when we don't know the size of the incoming data.
 I am looking for answers to these questions:
  
How does a REST-based microservice look like when it heavily relies on fs2?
 Can you suggest good learning resources for fs2? (for example: github projects...)
 What are the possible use-cases for fs2?
 Can we increase throughput by using fs2 instead of using only cats-effect? (for example in a REST-based microservice?)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey! I’m experimenting with some pretty non-standard layouts’ configurations (using a lot of xkb features like custom types and actions) to work around some wrists problems, multiple languages/layouts I need to work with also attempting to get to a setup that doesnt break the flow (e.g. standard layouts for english and ukrainian have weirdly different placements of non-alphanumerics which doesnt help at all to internilize the physical typing habbits, etc.)
 So far its starting to look pretty well but I have the major problem with getting my multiple layouts work in Emacs.
 Given that at different times a same key on my keyboard could generate a different symbol from six different alphabets, I’m trying to understand how to get emacs bindings to work invariantly to this (well ordered) chaos.
 An idea that came to my mind was this: if emacs did have a central function that performs a key lookup - it could’ve been probably advised - in case of a failed search - to change all the latin letters in the failed to be found sequence to the ones from the other alphabet I use and rerun the search. And do it for every of the languages of interest until it either works out or finally fails.
 I wasn’t able though to confirm from the elisp reference that this is possible)
 Sorry for the probable naivety of this question - I’m really not that familiar yet with Emacs internals and not speaking from arrogance here - just trying to describe my thought process trying to both explain what I need and not to overload the reader with complexities of my setup.
 Probably there is some true and very different way to solve tgis question that I’m not aware of.
 Thank you :)

 And I am figuring out that it would be cool to develop an app for emacs that uses lilypond and the various combinations bd/snare/charley patterns to shows exercices to be worked out.
 The question is: is it affordable for someone like me, to start on such a project? I'd like to learn, but I need something motivating... And this would be it.
 Is Lisp a good idea for such a project? Or would Python be a better choice?
 If you have a few crumbs to lead me in the right direction, so that at least I start on the right path.. that'd be cool

 I really need to have a quick way to toggle the renderization of all fragments in a document, as if I was going to each one of them with the cursor and doing M-x org-latex-preview, which of course I have keymapped to an easier binding (SPC l p).
 I saw on the web that a way to do this would be prepending C-u to org-latex-preview (in my case C-u SPC l p). But C-u is bound to evil-scroll-up, thus preventing me to do any other combination starting with that C-u. 
 So I've been trying to disable the binding of C-u from evil-scroll-up. 
 Note: in the afterthought, that is not really what I should have been doing, because instead it would be way better to use something like SPC l l p.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello.
 I recently moved from helm-swoop to helm-occur. In helm-swoop, search results are shown in the same color that the major mode shows with syntax coloring. However, helm-occur shows search results as a single color. I checked the customize-group for both helm and helm-occur but could not find a variable for this. 
 Is there a way to make syntax coloring enabled in the helm-occur buffer?
 Thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I read somewhere that it would be best in Emacs to put all files into a single directory. Does anyone of you do that? How do you find the file you currently need? Is there a way to tag the files, so that Dired can show all invoices, for instance?
 I currently still have different directories, and have defined the keys 1-7 in dired-mode-map to open them. But of course it would be nice to just enter the first letters of the file name in Helm Mini in the case that I know the file name, which currently only works for recent files and for files in my Org directory.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi folks,
 This is probably quite a simple question and more to do with Emacs Lisp syntax than anything else. I'm trying to set Org's org-tag-alist variable so that a directory containing all my projects can easily have the type of project categorised according to some default tags. Unfortunately, the .dir-locals.el file uses different syntax (dot notation?) to what I'm already barely used to with regular Emacs Lisp, so I'm struggling to make it work. In particular, I'm trying to get some group tags in that variable, but I'm utterly clueless because I just haven't had the time to learn Emacs Lisp yet.
 Could anyone supply a minimum working example of a .dir-locals.el snippet that adds group tags to Org mode? Many, many thanks in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi folks,
 I've just started using Org and I am fascinated by it and the possibilities it offers over every other system I've ever tried. I've started tinkering with custom agenda views, and I've got this fairly basic custom view happening with the following code:
  (setq org-agenda-files '("~/Documents/projects")) (setq org-agenda-custom-commands '(("p" "Programming todos" ((tags "programming"))))) 
 Now, I have a number of projects in that projects directory whose top-level headline is marked with the WAIT TODO keyword, but whose children are marked with regular TODO. My logic here is that I want to mark an entire project as waiting or blocked without having to mark every subtree or subtask as waiting, too.
 The problem is, when I use my custom agenda view, the project headline appears (albeit greyed-out), and all its children appear. Is there a way to exclude an entire tree from appearing in a custom agenda view if its headline or one of its parents is marked with a certain keyword, in this case, WAIT?
 Thanks in advance for any help!

 I am evaluating moving over from lsp-mode, now that eglot is shipped with emacs and it supports emacs-native features where possible. I mainly use python, julia, and web-devvy things like typescript, tsx, css, and html.

There is however one thing I am missing: keybindings to insert some special snippets/characters I use really frequently.

What would be the best way to do this in Lisp?

This makes it very hard and annoying to edit.
 I'm on a mac, and this only happens when I run emacs under screen. But I depend on screen, and do everything in a screen session, ingrained habit of decades that would be very hard to change.

I like keeping notes and todos together, but I think separate contexts is a good idea so if I'm in work mode I'm not seeing all the stuff I need to do in my business. Something I'm kind of wanting to is a way to mark something as delegated to X person. I don't need them to see that I delegated it, just to remind myself that I told them to do something and to follow up.
 ​
 I started out with a regular org file for each context, then ended up creating new org files for each "thing", which created my mess. Today I decided to try creating dailies in org-roam to see how that works out.
 ​
 Any suggestions for how to keep life organized in org or org-roam when you've got so much going on. From experience, no todo list/notes manager has ever really worked that well for this for me.... a few were okay (todoist on the todo list side and evernote on the notes side.... but they both had their own issues)
 ​
 I like org and org-roam I'm just struggling with how best to setup a structure that fits such a lifestyle.
 Any thoughts or input is very welcome...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I use TRAMP to connect to GitHub Codespaces via my Codespaces package. However, I noted recently that my TRAMP sessions were suffering tremendous and unignorable lag when navigating within a file. I went through my enabled modes one-by-one and was surprised to learn that vc-mode was, in this case, the culprit. Setting vc-handled-backends like so:
 (setq vc-handled-backends '(Git)) 
 had a profound effect on latency. I'm not sure why this is the case, but its original value holds a bunch of entries for VCSs that died decades ago (CVS, SCCS, RCS…): it's possible that one of my packages was using all of vc-mode's backends.
 My TRAMP sessions to Codespaces are now as responsive and fast as if I were to connect to them via VS Code. Hope this helps someone!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A thought occurred to me today while I was getting ready, mentally preparing. I realized that I was feeling a bit stressed about the day but that the thought of my todo and agenda buffers had a calming effect. I thought to myself, "it's alright, you're organized and at least if there is chaos it is somewhat documented chaos and you don't have to hold it all in your mind."
 Last weekend, I took the time to do a much needed cleanup of my init.el file. I got rid of all the cruft of comments, things I'd tried but given up though not yet deleted. I made a move to using straight.el as my package manager. I switched from Ivy to Helm. I just did some things I'd been meaning to do for a while. I cleaned up my todo file and recommitted to using 'C-c a a' more throughout the day.
 I assume that many of you, like me, find a certain "gee, that's neat" quality to getting some of this working. A sense of satisfaction maybe. I like learning new ways to do things, maybe cleaner, tighter. But the thing that I keep coming back to even more than all that is that this technology, this nerdy system, has a way of calming me and making me feel better. It feels like the world has more and more information each day, more chaos, etc. Using org-mode helps me live in the world.
 I was curious to see if any of you have had similar thoughts about it?

 I'm putting together a little package to preview markdown files similarly to how they are rendered on GitHub. Previously I've used grip (and grip-mode), which are awesome, but I wanted a little more room for customization and to avoid hitting the GitHub API on every change.
 This package does the rendering locally if your Emacs has xwidget support. I'd really appreciate any feedback anyone has!

 Problem is the example projects there all use stack to import pure cabal projects, the latter of which do have mixins, but are not stack-ified themselves. In my case, I want to be able to add something to package.yaml or stack.yaml like:
 -- package.yaml (or stack.yaml) cabal-fields: mixins: base hiding (Prelude) - relude (Relude as Prelude) - relude 
 or something like that, just so that the .cabal file stack generates has this option enabled. I haven't been able to figure out how to do this. Some help?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm currently studying Secrets of the Glasgow Haskell Compiler Inliner by Jones & Marlow (2002), and am trying to understand the "subtlety" they mention about the rapier algorithm.
 On the bottom left corner of page 7, they mention:
  
There is one other important subtlety in this algorithm: in the case where x is not in theta we must delete x from the substitution, denoted phi \ x. How could x be in the domain of the substitution, but not be in scope?
  
However, the authors do not elaborate much further due to space constraints.
 I'm trying to understand what they meant by this comment. Although I can fabricate inputs that produce the scenario they describe, I'm not sure what concrete example would lead to that input, nor why it's important to handle it the way they do.
 Also, the paper only shows two cases of their substitution algorithm that handles lambdas. Do we fall through to the second case if we fail the guard of the first case (i.e., when we match on a lambda introduces a variable already in-scope)? That is, am I correct in reading that as pseudo-Haskell?

has to deal with more than one technology or language within the same

maybe not all at once. In the first post of this series, I’d like to focus only
on the Haskell components of the example-servant-elm project. The following post
will cover the Bazel build for the front-end (Elm) component.
This blog post is, after a fashion, an extension of the talk given by
Andreas Herrmann during ZuriHac 2021. I want to slightly

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am really new to Haskell and I came across this discussion about how closures in Haskell can be used to mimic objects in traditional OOP. 
 Needless to say, I did not understand much of the discussion. What is really confusing to me is that, if A is an instance of an object (in the traditional sense) then I can change and update some property A.property of A. This doesn't create a new instance of A, it updates the value. Exactly, how is this particular updating achieved via closures in Haskell? 
 I understand that mutability can have bad side effects and all. But if a property of an instance of an object, call it A.property for example, were to be updated many times throughout a program how can we possibly keep track of that in Haskell?
 I would really appreciate ELI5 answer if possible. Thank you for your time!!!

 On the other hand python-mode provides some functionality (like python-shell-send-buffer or python-shell-send-defun) to interact with an active, locally running python3 REPL.
 I'd like to be able to send Python code from a Python-file buffer directly (without me copying and pasting) to the MicroPython REPL.
 Any idea how to achieve that?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm not an emacs power user nor very proficient at elisp.
 I use magit quite heavily in emacs, and I'm regularly working on multiple git repositories at the same time. These are different repositories/worktrees for the same project, just with different branches checked out. I'm not sure if it is relevant, but these are Perl projects, using cperl-mode, and each project has a single TAGS files at the project root. The first time I use `M-.` (`xref-find-definitions`), I get prompted to load a TAGS file, and I select the one for the current repository I'm using. This works as expected. However when I happen to be editing a file from a different repository and hit M-., the previously loaded TAGS file is still used, so this brings me to the source file from the wrong repository. Since the files look identical, I don't notice this and regularly make edits in the wrong git worktree.
 I saw that I can load multiple tags tables using visit-tags-table, and then switch between them using select-tags-table. Is there any way to automate this so that when I use `M-.` it automatically chooses the TAGS file closest to the current file path? I looked into project.el and projectile, but I couldn't find any examples for how to do this.

However, there are limitations, for example, org-modern add space paddings to improve the visuals, which you cannot do with these two variables.
 Exactly for that reason, I will have little use for this discovery, and would rather keep it out of my .emacs.d. But hey, maybe someone would make use of this somehow :).
 You should be able to see an example also below. 
 (with-eval-after-load 'org-faces (setq org-todo-keyword-faces (append (cl-loop for todo in '("TODO" "NEXT" "STARTED" "PROJECT" "HOLD") with faces = '(:height 0.8 :inherit (org-modern-todo)) collect (cons todo faces)) (cl-loop for todo in '("CANCELLED" "DONE") with faces = '(:height 0.8 :inherit (org-modern-done)) collect (cons todo faces))) org-priority-faces (cl-loop with end = org-priority-lowest for i from org-priority-highest to end collect (list i :inherit 'org-modern-priority))))

I use it for everything. I occasionally would like a CLI tool that doesn't exist on apt, and so I build it myself. I used to use C for this, and now it's Haskell! The other day I was thinking of spinning up a chess clone because I wanted to build an AI that could beat me at chess (without looking up how chess engines work, just as a puzzle) and I thought, why not Haskell?
 Something about programming in Haskell makes me feel like a god genius programmer. She's so fast, so sleek, such a pure functional mathematical language. It's easily my favorite language by far and I just can't quite figure out what it is that makes me geek the fuck out about it.

Without an init.el, package-selected-packages evaluates correctly. However, when I try to put it back, Emacs doesn't recognize it. What's going on?
 Edit: apparently, at some point, Emacs auto-generated a .emacs file. I've deleted it and init.el is recognised now, but the issue with package-selected-packages still remains.

 f :: a -> Bool
 f x = x==0 
 However, since im using the "==" operator, to tell haskell that i wont be using any other type other than the ones to which (==) has instances, Id make it this correct? 
 f :: (Eq a) => a -> Bool
 f x = x==0 
 But this throws an error telling me i also have to include (Num a) =>
 Why is that? I'm not using any operator that is in the Num a class... Why does it need this? Isn't the whole point of overloading to restrict "a" to only be a type which has an instance in the used operator/function?? What makes me add (Num a) => here too?

 I'm going to start playing with it but thought I'd see if anyone else has gotten it to work. It might be that I will need to set :ensure nil in each so use-package doesn't try to load the package since el-get will have already done it.

 What's the best style set of keybindings (in your opinion) for Emacs, and "Why?".
 Background:
  
I ask this since I have a keybinding to easily switch to Vim style keybindings a la 'Evil Mode', but only do so for programming purposes. 
 Everywhere else I use Emacs style keybindings (Org Mode, etc).
 I also use a few custom Hydras as well for weird things like buffer rotation, etc.
  
Curious what you crazy Emacs wizards use these days (ex: Xah Fly Keys, etc). Feel free to provide the "What" you use individual keybinding sets for as well.
 Let's have at it, let the best keybindings win! :)

 While I love org-mode, and would much rather use it than any other option, I still have a hard time because I manage a lot of my tasks through my phone. Same for content consumption, I do a lot on my phone thus cannot save anything easily in org.
 I've tried orgzly, but it does not really fit me. 
 How do you manage all that ?
 Thanks !

 The rust code are mainly borrowed from agreety. And I am using the Emacs Module in Rust crate here.
 For those who are not familar with greetd. greetd is a minimal, agnostic and flexible login manager daemon.

 Is everyone just locked on 8.6 or earlier like we are?
 It seems like https://github.com/ghcjs/ghcjs/issues/821 is a rigid dealbreaker for any sizable project.
 Our setup of using a hybrid of ghcjs-8.6, ghc-8.6 and ghc-8.10 works well enough, but I'd be lying if I said it wasn't being heavily stress tested.
 I'm hoping that ghc-9.6 can potentially come to the rescue with a JS backend, but I was curious if there are other solutions on the horizon.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just thought I'd document this fix here.
 I have Emacs running portably on Dropbox through a batch script that sets the HOME environment variable:
 REM Set the environment variable HOME, which Emacs uses as the base directory. set HOME=%~dp0 REM Run Emacs, passing any parameters to it as well. "D:\Dropbox\Apps\emacs\emacs-28.1\bin\runemacs.exe" %* 
 I began getting this error whenever I tried to list ELPA packages:
 Failed to verify signature archive-contents.sig: No public key for _____________ created at 2022-10-18T08:05:04+1100 using RSA Command output: gpg: keyblock resource '/d/Dropbox/Apps/emacs/.emacs.d/d:/Dropbox/Apps/emacs/.emacs.d/elpa/gnupg/pubring.kbx': No such file or directory gpg: Signature made Tue Oct 18 08:05:04 2022 AUSEST gpg: using RSA key _________________ gpg: Can't check signature: No public key 
 My googling led me to this Stack Exchange thread which noted that this was caused by the homedir expansion producing an invalid directory path.
 The fix in my init.el is therefore:
 (setq package-gnupghome-dir "elpa/gnupg") 
 This creates the keys in the directory that Emacs expects (.emacs.d/elpa/gnupg/) and allows the whole thing to work.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been using an alist as a means of counting occurrences of characters in a string. However, the values associated with a key in the alist are persistent across function calls, even though I reset the alist in a let form (and, well, it's inside a function!). Here is a minimal working example. Calling my/test multiple times continually increases the alist values:
 (defun my/test () (let ((my/alist '((a . 0) (b . 0)))) (incf (alist-get 'a my/alist)) (incf (alist-get 'b my/alist)) my/alist)) 
 What am I doing wrong? Something tells me the problem is with incf, but I cannot understand how my/alist is stored in memory, since it should have its scope inside the function and be reset when let is run.

 I know with record syntax we can create 
 data somedata ={ sum:: String, sum:: Int}
 What's stopped me from using Haskell for my everyday data science projects was with record syntax I would to modify things so the types and headers to the csv files matched.
 Which is a pain if I am just wanting to download data and play with it.
 Is there a way to create types, say similar to a Dataframe in Python or R where you can turn a CSV to a DataFrame?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am a FTE Linux kernel dev, I use bare bones Emacs and have been wondering if maybe I should add LSP support, as I hear it's technically possible to use a LS with the kernel. Anyone do this today, or have advice on how to configure Eglot for the kernel? All I have ever used is cscope and ctags. I'd like to get it working so that the LSP server picks up the correct headers for the build arch and picks up all the GCC flags.
 I also usually run my builds inside of a container so I don't use my system's gcc toolchain.
 I am not an Emacs wizard, so detailed instructions for an idiot are most welcome.

 Trying to fix bugs in a package that's gone a bit stale so I'm trying to figure out how to use edebug. Edebug manual is pretty dense and a couple of weeks between debugging sessions I forget how to run it. In the spirit of "learning in public" here's a quick screen cast: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=560QrNt-a_w
 This should really be accompanied by a blog post, and it's kinda there in my notes. Would love some feedback.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[EDIT: Someone volunteered, and the proposal has been submitted. If the Haskell devroom gets accepted you will certainly hear from me again. There will be a call for proposals and for additional volunteers to make it a success. Thanks!
 I decided to propose a Haskell devroom (like a one/half-days pecialist track or miniconf) for FOSDEM 2023, to be held February 4--5 in Brussels (main site; call-for-devrooms). It would be great to promote Haskell among this audience and hopefully attract new contributors / community members.
 Unfortunately I left it quite late (deadline submission is today). I only just realised I need a secondary contact (i.e. co-organiser) to submit the proposal. So... any volunteers?
 Ideally you are located in Europe or definitely planning to attend FOSDEM. If you are willing, please message me here on Reddit or mail frase at frase dot id dot au. I think I all need right now is your name and email address (and enthusiasm).
 The text of my proposal may be found at https://github.com/frasertweedale/talks/blob/master/2022-02-xx-fosdem-haskell-devroom/proposal.md.
 I have experience organising and hosting FP miniconfs at linux.conf.au including running the CFP etc. I expect FOSDEM will be similar, just on the other side of the world from Australia, where I live.
 Thank you!

 No problem, I thought, I'll just create a parallel directory structure and symlink things in places, and then import that into lsp. However, at some point in the process of importing the project (based on Maven pom files) it canonicalises some paths and ends up importing the original directory structure.
 I realise this is more of an underlying Eclipse issue, rather than an Emacs one, but does anybody have a good suggestion for how to work round this?

 The issue is that when the file is moved, the buffer opened doesn't really know about it and after any change in the buffer and then save, the file gets saved into old location.
 How do I associate a buffer with new location? I found somewhere that I can use `write-file` function and it suppose to change "the pointer" to file but it didn't. It does write to specified location but save-buffer still saves it into old file.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve spent some time this summer extending Monad-Bayes, a
probabilistic programming library in Haskell. This was done in the context of a
Tweag open source fellowship, under the supervision of Dominic Steinitz. These
improvements are part of the upcoming 1.0 release of the library.
Briefly, what’s Monad-Bayes about? Like Church, Gen and
Pyropyro (among other probabilistic programming languages), it allows a user
to specify a Bayesian model as a program, and automates the process of
inferring the specified distribution. Unlike other languages, it is a
first-class library of its host language (Haskell), rather than an embedded
language. This means that any language feature in the host language is
available to you. It also means that you can have distributions over absolutely
anything. For in…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am trying to better understand (and possibly, edit) some of the C files in the latest version of Emacs.
 Does anybody know of any good resources that go over what the general design patterns are, best practices, and tips on debugging?
 (Search engines haven't been much help as most combinations of 'emacs' and 'C code' lead to results about configuring Emacs as an IDE for C)
 I am pretty familiar with Emacs-Lisp, and I can write and understand C pretty well, but I would like to get a good understanding of all the Emacs-specific things I'm seeing in the C code, such as how to go from C variables and structs to Lisp objects, the DEFUN macro, etc.
 The motivation behind this is that, as noted in a previous post, I've noticed that the xwidget-webkit feature is (partially) broken in the latest version for MacOS. I would like to try out some possible fixes: it looks like most issues are simply due to the fact that many functions are only defined for the GTK framework, and not Mac's NextStep/Cocoa framework.
 Also, if anybody wants to help out with this effort, please let me know.
 ​
 UPDATE:
  
if you're interested in understanding Emacs C source-code, take a look at this section of the official manual: I found the part about Writing Emacs Primitives especially helpful. Many thanks to u/7890yuiop!!!
 If you're interested in the xwidget patches I'm working on, I've created this fork of the emacs mirror. I don't know if I'll be able to fix everything, but it's looking good and I've already implemented the estimated-load-progress function

 https://github.com/keithfancher/haskell-notes/blob/master/haskell-notes.md
 These are some notes I started taking about Haskell, specifically about topics I found confusing or which seemed to have many disparate sources of documentation. There's stuff about installation, toolchain, and of course some oddities of the language itself. It collects some basic summaries of the info that I've gleaned so far and a bunch of links to stuff written by people a lot more knowledgeable than I am.
 Of course, to reiterate: I am a beginner. So take it all with a grain of salt! But that can also be useful, since I probably have a similar perspective to all the other beginners out there.
 Also note that it's a work in progress! It'll grow as I continue to learn (and write down) new stuff.
 Anyway, hope this helps somebody!

 I am learning Haskell because I've heard so many great things. I had heard of the language before but Software Unscripted has inspired me to pursue it seriously and dedicate some time to it. 
 So far it's really interesting! I've not had that "ah-ha!" moment but it's only been a week or so. 
 One thing I'm wondering: Can I change the cabal output directory? 
 Right now the output goes to:
  /home/chris/projects/MyPackage-CLI/dist-newstyle/build/x86_64-linux/ghc-9.0.2/MyPackage-CLI-0.1.0.0/x/MyPackage-CLI/build/MyPackage-CLI/MyPackage-CLI 
 That is a mouthful lol! I suppose it doesn't matter until I need to deploy (thanks to cabal run) but I am curious to know if I can just have a ~/projects/MyPackage-CLI/bin/MyPackage-CLI -- or something like that. 
 Any ideas? I've searched around and mostly I've found ways of changing cabal itself, not the output or bin directory. 
 Thanks in advance!

In emacs i got this indentation in a file. When i clicking tab it was directly going 15 space forward after std::cout << "enter another: ";. The situation persist in just one file. Any idea what did this happen?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone, 
 I just released a fork of all-the-icons-completion. I've added support for more completion categories (imenu, M-x, and more) by taking code from all-the-icons-ivy-rich. I've also added a few quality of life improvements, like proper icon aligning and scaling (once again ported from all-the-icons-ivy-rich). If you use all-the-icons-completion I'd recommend giving my fork a try.

 A specific combination of things makes lsp-mode (with lsp-ui and lsp-ui-doc-mode) cause lines below the cursor to move. Those circumstances are: 
  
Using one of the themes from Prot's package ef-themes
 
cc-mode with lsp-mode, lsp-ui and lsp-ui-doc-mode 
  
There is no problem with the identical configuration using haskell/lsp-haskell or python/lsp-pyright or any other language. 
 Nor is there a problem using a different theme e.g. modus-vivendi 
 This video shows 3 short clips to demonstrate the problem. 
  
theme: ef-dark, editing a C file showing the unwanted movement
 
identical setup after using counsel-load-theme and choosing modus-vivendi- no unwanted movement
 
theme: ef-dark, but editing a haskell file again using lsp-mode with lsp-ui and lsp-ui-doc-mode - no unwanted movement
 
 I'm stuck now and looking for ideas to help me discover what could cause this and how to fix it.

 #+TODO: TODO WAIT | DONE * TODO This is a test :work: * WAIT This is another test :work: 
 Run (org-tags-view nil "work+TODO=\"WAIT\"") and you will see, as expected, an agenda view containing only the task tagged "WAIT". 
 Quit the agenda and call org-todo-list, then run org-agenda-filter, and enter work+TODO="WAIT" at the prompt. Do you get the exact same result? I had assumed I would, but I do not. Instead I get this message: 
 ‘+TODO’ filter ignored because tag/category is not represented 
 So, questions: 
  
Is this as it should be? 
 Is there a way of using org-agenda-filter to filter out tasks with a specific todo keyword?
  
I realize I could do this: 
 (setq org-agenda-custom-commands '(("p" "Test" tags "+work+TODO=\"WAIT\""))) 
 or perhaps use org-agenda-filter-by-regexp. My question is just whether org-agenda-filter should allow me to find all entries with a particular todo keyword, and if not, I guess I'd want to know why not?

I pop the disk into my computer; and while the computer recognizes it, it says the disk is unreadable. So I Google what emacs even is. He was into coding, and was even trying to create his own pixel art computer game thing. I figure the backup could be related to that kind of stuff.
 How do I get this CD to open? I installed emacs on my computer (I think?) and nothing changed? 
 (I do realize he could have also used it as a journal. Honestly, I want answers to questions, and I'll never get them, now. Part of me hopes it is his journal. I'm already in therapy so it would just be one more thing to discuss, I guess. I won't let my mom know. I'm desperate. Thank you.)

I'm using a current build of emacs 29.0.50 on X (with StumpWM/XMonad and picom), it has cairo, built with gtk3, regular alpha works... but no change when setting alpha-background.
 Can anyone confirm this works for them on X with picom? I've heard it working on Wayland with Sway, and of the emacs fork that had this code initially on X, but what about on the current version of emacs with X?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I'm new to Scala and I'm following Martin Odersky's course on Coursera Functional Programming Principles in Scala. I'm also using IntelliJ IDEA. I set up my environment following the course but it seems that my code is trying to compile Scala 2 rather than Scala 3.
 When I run the following code in IntelliJ: 
 val x = 10 if x < 0 then println("negative") else if x == 0 then println("zero") else println("positive") 
 I get this error:
 /Users/myname/Desktop/miscellaneous/courses/functional_programming_principles/scala-project/src/main/scala/example/example.worksheet.sc:3:4 '(' expected but identifier found. if x < 0 then 
 When I run scala --version in my terminal I get Welcome to Scala 3.2.0 (11.0.16.1, Java OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM) and my REPL also works in Scala 3. 
 I'm sure this is related but I'm not sure how to fix it:
  
In IDEA, under External Libraries, OpenJDK 18 and Scala SDK 2.13.10 are listed.
  
Does anyone have any suggestions? Thanks
 EDIT: I fixed the issue by simply starting a new project and following the IDEA new project wizard. Helped me select the JDK and Scala version that I wanted. Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Guys, I'm migrating from Vim to Emacs and my init.el is still very basic. I've installed evil, evil-collection and which-key. Overall, things are working pretty well, but I'm having trouble when using *Buffer List* (you know, the buffer menu invoked with C-x C-b or :ls<cr>).
 When I use C-h k o, for example, it shows the proper mapping defined in evil-collection: o is mapped to tabulated-list-sort.
 However, if I use C-h m, it says o is "Select that buffer in another window". And when I invoke which-key-show-mode, is says o is mapped to Buffer-menu-other-window.
 Am I missing something here? Is there a package that "glues" all the help systems together?

 Consumption of social media typically necessitates few repeated actions - like, share, comment and follow. If these actions are assigned to convenient keyboard keys, the consumption becomes easier. Here's an attempt to unify this experience using GNU Emacs and tumblesocks.

 I have all of the above installed --- and working. With Golang, the functions autocomplete with the parenthesis and placeholders for the args, as expected. So the plumbing works.
 But, when working with Javascript (with ts-ls), the functions and methods autocomplete without parenthesis or placeholders. So, for exemple, "document.querySel" autcompletes to "document.querySelector" -- NOT "document.querySelector(selectors)" or something like that.
 Again: yasnippet is installed and working and the entire thing works in other languages. Does anyone know why it doesn't work with Javascript?
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am a novice emacs user. In an attempt to set the font in my init.el file, I came across two different functions: set-fontset-font and set-frame-font.
 set-frame-font sets the font of current frame correctly, whereas set-fontset-font doesn't do anything. To my understanding, invoking (set-fontset-font t ...) is basically modifying the default font set, making new frames to use the font I specified, so this behavior is surprising to me.
 I frequently fiddle with code that contains non-alphanumeric characters (Hangul, Hiragana/Katakana, Emoji...), and I use different fonts for each of them. It would be great if I can use set-fontset-font as that function has this feature built-in. Is there a way to make it a one-function-to-rule-them-all?
 P.S. I tried modifying default-frame-alist with (font . "fontset-default") but apparently that is not allowed? Now my init.el is broken!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am using Doom emacs, with Evil mode.
 I am learning using Org Mode and I wanted to cycle through single Headlines by using the Tab key but what I can only cycle through is the first level under the Headline I am pressing the Tab key upon.
 To clarify, I don't want to use the S-Tab to cycle through all Headlines, but I only want to cycle through one Headline and its sub-headlines.
 How can I cycle through all nested Headlines, one by one, with evil mode
 I am sorry if that's a pretty noob question. Thank you all for your help
 Edit: I've found in the manual a workaround (which is actually the official combo key for the action I was looking for) by using C-c C-k. That key combo will expand all subtrees of a headline, recursively. To close the main headline back, I'll use za.
 Sadly, default vim z operations in evil-org look not working. E.G. zO is supposed to perform the operation I was looking for, or zr doesn't open one subtree at a time.
 Edit 2: In the lang: org README file from Doom Emacs I see that this behavior was intentional and that can be reversed.
  
 TAB was changed to toggle only the visibility state of the current subtree, rather than cycle through it recursively. This can be reversed with:  #+begin_src emacs-lisp (after! evil-org (remove-hook 'org-tab-first-hook #'+org-cycle-only-current-subtree-h)) #+end_src

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This past month I've been working on implementing my first OOP language with Haskell .. implementing the syntax and context analysis was very easy for me because I'm very aware of the fact that we build parsers using stateful monads using one of the already available libraries (like parsec for example)... so that went easy after defining the context-free grammars that is not left-recursive, and then implementing the parsec-functions to every non-terminating symbol in the grammars... so that went easy with no hiccups... 
 But after I dived into the context analysis that's where shit hit the fan.. it seemed that my programming model has either been very bad or I'm a bad software-engineer because functions started to become very ugly due to many parameters that are passed to the functions, and many other reasons that I don't how to start to explain, but in summary whatever makes haskell beautiful I managed to make it very ugly and complicated with my architecture design..
 So my question is: we already have stateful monads and parsers like parsec as an architectural model to implement the syntax analysis and context analysis. Are there also standardized models to implement the other steps in compilers like the context analysis? Is there literature that answers this question in regard to Haskell?
 Edit: while implementing the context analysis I became very aware of the fact that need zippers because I needed to be very aware ot the context of every variable and method which then I did and made the job much easier, so maybe that's part of the answer that I'm seeking?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I want to follow An Introduction to Programming in Emacs Lisp as my first real programming book. I have completed a few other programming courses online which were very basic, so I doubt the book would be over my head, but I have been warned plenty to avoid emacs while a novice and elisp due to its being very niche. In my defense: I'm motivated more by a desire to fulfill a sense of seeking free knowledge than I am worried about being a paid developer asap.

 I run Emacs on a Mac. I install it via homebrew. I install packages with straight-use-package. INFOPATH isn't defined in my environment.
 When I enter Info in the usual way (C-h i) what I see is not optimal.
  
There is no entry for Emacs Lisp, among others.
 There are things for which there is no actual Info help. Example: "Info-find-file: Info file ‘ada-mode’ does not exist; consider installing it"
 There are almost 350 lines in the top level of Info and it is full of things I don't care about, such as EUDC, 'Gawk work flow', and 22 separate entries for things in GNU Gettext Utilities.
  
Info-directory-list looks like this (where <$HOME> actually represents my correct home directory)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The "snapshot" binaries of Emacs 29 for Windows posted today should be somewhat less fragile while running without GCC/libgccjit (e.g. MSYS2 installed and on the Windows path).
 https://alpha.gnu.org/gnu/emacs/pretest/windows/emacs-29/?C=M;O=D
 Note: the snapshot is dated Oct 13, 2022, but I posted it today, Oct 15th; took me a few days. The last included commit was cbd04ad3d572850775f18bde868c71abcde733ed.
 Anyway, this build use a new "trampolines" target for make. This target pre-compiles (AOT) trampolines, infrastructure that allows natively compiled elisp to call redefined elisp primitives, which are then included with the installer, zip and no-deps.zip distributables. While redefining primitives is discouraged, it does happen, especially via advice APIs.
 Including these trampolines should enable installing and running (e.g.) packages that advise elisp primitives. Previously (in all 29 snapshots and GNU windows binary distributions of Emacs 28) that might have failed because Emacs unconditionally creates trampolines on the fly if they do not exist when needed. Precompiling the trampolines should prevent Emacs from triggering async native compilation even when native-comp-available-p was returning nil, to make them.
 TIA for bug reports & feedback!
 PS, in case others are building Emacs with native comp enabled and not distributing GCC/libgcc with, the new make target isn't on the Emacs 28 branch (yet). It should be fairly easy to patch it in or manually add something like this to your packaging process after success of make all, before make install (or make install-strip or whtv)
  (mapatoms (λ (f) (when (subr-primitive-p (symbol-function f)) (or (comp-trampoline-search f) (comp-trampoline-compile f))))) 
 This code comes from message #50 in bug #58318, and worked for me (however, the 29 snapshot binaries do use the new make target, now - they don't use the above snippet).
 Edit: un-mangled the code block

 When I use control +/- I can only zoom in up to the font size I set in ~/.doom.d/config.el (doom user here) then it just says "The font hasn't been resized" (not big of an explanation).
 I zoom out and on the right bottom corner it tells me how many "steps" I zoomed back ( (-1), (-2), etc.), and when I press C-+ even just one time it takes me back to "0" ie the default font size I set.
 This what I have in my config regarding fonts.
 ;; ----------- FONTS ----------- ;; main font stuff (setq doom-font (font-spec :family "Comic Mono" :size 24) doom-variable-pitch-font (font-spec :family "Ubuntu" :size 24) doom-big-font (font-spec :family "Comic Mono" :size 24)) ;; make italics and bold show without the slash and asterisk (not working) (after! doom-themes (setq doom-themes-enable-bold t doom-themes-enable-italic t)) ;; italic comments and keywords (not working) (custom-set-faces! '(font-lock-comment-face :slant italic) '(font-lock-keyword-face :slant italic)) 
 I'm sorry if the question is high noobeness, I'm not very practical with this and I don't have any idea of how to move forward. I love editing org files in emacs though, so these headaches are worth it.
 Thank you all.

One of the greatest difficulties in understanding the Zettelkasten Method is to separate its specific characteristics from actual knowledge work. Or, how I like to phrase it: “Link knowledge, not notes.” Working with our Zettelkasten is the physical (or digital) manifestation of our thinking. It provides a framework that allows us to think through writing and to create an increasingly complex thinking machine that can help us think deeper than being on our own. The Zettelkasten Method provides a framework for our thinking, but does not prescribe what and how we think.

Start typing @ and get an auto-complete helm box with all the people I have in the system. Selecting one would should the nickname I defined for them in this sytem
 Have a capture template (for example when creating a meeting) where I can select the people I have in the system (multi-select) and assign them to a "with" property under the meeting heading
 Click on a @-link and see all the headings under which this person is mentioned.
 Assign a TODO to someone and later see all the TODOs by them (today I do this with tags but it doesn't work well with people with the same first names unless my tags keep a @first_lastname pattern for everyone) Closest I have seen so far is this: https://emacs.stackexchange.com/a/64502 but it's part of a much more complex package which seems overkill. Plus, I don't see how I could easily use with a capture template.
  
Any ideas? Thanks!

 If core domain object is near service and repository then that module must include the dependency to the SQL or other database library. Now if your other project doesn't use SQL but they need your core object it will drag all the libraries with it.
 If you separate out the core domain class into a submodule that doesn't contain any dependencies, then you can import that to other projects, but then it's suddenly not package-by-feature. Or can we achieve a hybrid model where the core object is separate and then all the rest, SQL, HTTP, API, JSON are in one other module that is the app.

 type mismatch; found : cmd.Persist (which expands to) XXXXEntity#Persist required: XXXXEntity.this.Persist .onCommand[XXXXCommand, XXXXCreatedReply] { case (cmd: XXXXCommand, ctx, state) => cmd.apply(ctx, state) } 
 ​
 I created A Command interface and created Commands from it.
 trait XXXXCommands[R] extends ReplyType[R] { override type ReplyType = Rtype Context = XXXXEntity#CommandContext[ReplyType]type State =XXXXStatetype Persist = XXXXEntity#Persist def apply(ctx: Context, stateOpt: Option[State]): Persist = {stateOpt match {case None => initial(ctx)case Some(state) if state.XXXXStatus == XXXXStatus.Success => success(ctx, state)}} protected def rejectByStatus(ctx: Context, state: State): XXXXEntity#Persist = {ctx.invalidCommand(s"${this.getClass.getSimpleName}: Invalid operation. {Id: ${state.XXXXId}, Status: ${state.XXXXStatus}")ctx.done} protected def reject(message: String, ctx: Context): XXXXEntity#Persist = {ctx.invalidCommand(message)ctx.done} protected def initial(ctx: Context): XXXXEntity#Persistprotected def success(ctx: Context, state: State): XXXXEntity#Persist} 
 I am using (or trying to use) Lagom framework. Persist is a trait that is inside of the PersistentEntity trait. Because of the the inner traits I tried to take the Persist inside the Entity that I created via hash (#) operation. That may be the problem.
 I dont know how could I fix it but its so weird to have that problem. This would exactly work in java but why it did not in scala?
 Edit:
 It happens when I try to run the code below.
 override def behavior: Behavior = Actions().onCommand[XXXXCommand, XXXXCreatedReply] { case (cmd: XXXXCommand, ctx, state) => cmd.apply(ctx, state) }

In the coming weeks I'm considering releasing my hyper-minimal take on Zettelkasten to a wider audience. My rationale has always been to squash complexity in favor of a quick & lightweight method of retrieving notes (nothing at all wrong with other apps that have all the bells & whistles btw). The same codebase runs on any of Windows, Linux, BSD (Apple likely to be included soon as well) with zero issues.
Some screen shots...



The interface as you noticed is commandline driven & features a REPL (Read Evaluate Print & Loop) to process commands. As it stands now, the source code is merely 27 Kilobytes in size & would be great to toss on a USB drive so your notes are easy to access. No smartphone interface as I'm not much interested in that domain. At any rate, if this sounds like something you might be interested in, check in every now & again & I'll hopefully post a download link eventually.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I want to write a simple converter from lambda calculus expressions to SKI expressions using these 6 rules. I have my two types
 data Expr = Var String | Abs String Expr | App Expr Expr data SKI = S | K | I | App SKI SKI 
 With these types, rule 5 does not quite work using general recursion:
 general :: Expr -> SKI general (Abs v1 (Abs v2 e)) | free v1 e = general (Abs v1 $ general (Abs v2 e)) 
 Understandably, this doesn't work because Abs requires its second arg to be an Expr but general returns SKI.
 I've tried implementing it using various recursion schemes (futu, histo, para and ana), but to no success. Is there a way to do this without having to merge the two types together into one?
 And additionally, if something can't be implemented using general recursion, can it be implemented using recursion schemes? Or is general recursion strictly "more powerful"?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I found that completing-read + embark-act-all rocks. For example, I can update all lsp-related package in straight.el by calling straight-pull-package and then type lsp- to get a list of completion candidates with lsp in the name. Then I call embark-act-all and pull all the selected packages.
 But it would be useful to be able to switch from an arbitrary completing-read minibuffer into completing-read-multiple via a key-press, collect multiple candidates (which don't necessarily have matching substrings), and then just run the original command for each of the selected candidates, e.g. via embark-act-all. This would be much more convenient than just running the command multiple times or what I sometimes do, mapping the function over the list in elisp (M-: (seq-map #'<command> candidates))
 I could write my own function which calls completing-read-multiple, like straight-pull-package-crm, but it would be nice if something like that would be possible from any command. I'm asking because I thought something like that should already exist somewhere or be possible somehow with existing functionality in emacs/embark.
 Feel free to propose other solutions to my problem, as what I'm asking might be an XY problem.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey, I just attended a job‍ that was largely JVM-focused. I'm not new to the JVM; I've done previous work in Java (1.6/Android) and spent a large chunk of time writing Clojure. My previous work has been in Haskell, which I liked. I guess my question is: Is Scala worth it now? I have a larger Java codebase I'll be integrating with, and I get to choose what JVM technologies to use, and other folks have expressed interest in Scala as well. I'd feel guilty for pushing Clojure on them, just because I know it, but I've also been there and done that, and I like types now. Coming from Haskell, are there functional libraries I should build upon but allow for escape hatch style mutability for some of my not so functional teammates? We're a small team, and pedagogy will be a part of the gig. I'm looking for honest opinions of the language and what essential reading material/libraries would be for someone more comfortable with FP in general. I'm not opposed to pragmatism either; it's one thing I like about Scala. It seems like there's a lot of excellent libraries because of the existing JVM ecosystem. Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To me, I've always thought that data constructors should have a lowercase first letter, because they are term-level and behave very similarly to functions. For example,
 data T = D Int f :: Int -> T f = D 
 Here, f and D are very similar conceptually, so why should they be represented differently?
 I've read https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6237775/why-does-haskell-force-data-constructors-first-letter-to-be-upper-case but the only compelling argument to me seems to be pattern matching, since data constructors can be matched on but functions cannot. However as someone who learnt haskell recently it seems to me that it would be clearer if data constructors had a lower case first letter to make clear their term-levelness.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m super excited about new meta programming capabilities. Macros, match types, inline methods etc. All of them are super useful in the project I’m working on - CRUD with lots of lookalike entities and logic. 
 I’m very efficient in Scala 2, good old runtime-programming and FP, but macro always felt like something not to touch in Scala 2.
 Now there’s Scala 3, and metaprogramming seems to go mainstream. The problem though is that I cannot get used to programming at compile-time. Everything I have in my project is someone else’s copypasta. I’ve read the docs and few blogposts, but still not capable to write it myself. 
 I’m looking for small Scala 3 exclusive (mixing it with 2 makes much harder to distinguish) projects with use of metaprogramming where I can learn more and perhaps contribute. Ducktape (https://github.com/arainko/ducktape) is a great example. Any blog posts would be even better. 
 Thanks!

stateful systems using traces — sequences of stateful actions — that can be
combined and modified to write complex test cases easily and transparently. This
post elaborates on the combinators used to generate new traces from previously
existing traces.
Writing generators for property-based tests is an art, and there’s often a
trade-off between how many test cases are generated and how meaningful each of
them is. When considering stateful systems, this problem is exacerbated, because
any action taken now may constrain the available actions for the future. This
means that the test generator will already need to track how the state evolves
from each step to the next in order to generate valid inputs. We think that
this is problematic bec…]]></summary>

Vuiet is supposed to show playing track information on the modeline - right about where you’d normally have line/char line counts. Mine very rarely does this; I haven’t exactly pinned it down, but SOME buffers will actually show this information. It doesn’t seem to be vuiet-specific ones exactly, but I think that might be it. 
 I’d really appreciate any suggestions for where I could look to pull that info out of vuiet and add it to my modeline. 
 I tried placing (vuiet-update-mode-line) in the modeline config variable (forget the exact name) but that didn’t help. 
 Sometimes when I run the command manually I can actually see it for what looks like a frame or two.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So let's say I have a library and a test-suite and my Cabal file looks something like this: 
 ```cabal library exposed-modules: MyLib build-depends: base >=4.14.3.0 hs-source-dirs: src default-language: Haskell2010
 test-suite test type: exitcode-stdio-1.0 main-is: Test.hs build-depends: base >=4.14.3.0 , my-lib hs-source-dirs: test default-language: Haskell2010 ```
 I want to test a "private" function from MyLib. The function is not supposed to be exported by the module. But of course then I can't import the function from my test suite. What's the standard way to deal with this? 
  
Put the tests together with MyLib and export the tests? 
 Make a dedicated module just to re-export the "public" functions and for all other modules just export everything? 
 Never test private functions?
  
All of these options seem flawed to me.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[TL;DR: I need to specify a :files value inside the use-package form, but this has irritating side-effects.
 I install packages with straight and use-package.
 I use the transient package. I noticed that its info manual didn't appear for me with C-h i. I dug deeper and realized that .../straight/build/transient didn't contain a dir file or any of the doc files. Several other packages, like orderless, did include dir in their straight/build directories, but their repo directories also happen to store the doc files at the top level.
 transient is different in that its repo has a docs/ subdirectory, which seemed to be the source of the problem. But magit has a similar repo structure, and its docs were installing fine.
 I noticed that the recipe for magit has a :files key which pulls in the doc file. Adding
 :straight (:files (:defaults "docs/*")) 
 to my (use-package 'transient ...) form appears to do the trick - and automagically triggers a make docs command for transient somehow - but now I have two wrinkles:
  
straight rebuilds transient every time I start Emacs
 I get a warning "Warning (straight): Two different recipes given for "transient" (:files cannot be both nil and (:defaults "docs/*"))"
  
The first issue is annoying, but isn't a showstopper. I don't restart Emacs very often and my startup time is already slow.
 The second issue worries me, because I don't know whether it means that updated docs will actually get installed in the future. Presumably the clash is between my (use-package 'transient ...) and the recipe that gets used when transient is handled as a dependency of magit (which I also use). But which recipe is actually used to install transient now? Is it getting installed twice every time?
 I don't know why the transient docs aren't getting installed "out of the box" as they apparently are for everyone else. What might I be doing wrong?

  readLine.split(" ").map(_.toInt)  And it works as expected, but then I try:  vertices(v).filter(!(visited(_))  and the compiler would complain:
  
value unary_! is not a member of Int => Boolean
  
So I end up writing my lambda expressions with _ and if I see an error then I expand them to “true” lambdas like:  vertices(v).filter(vertex => !(visited(vertex)) 
 This is a little frustrating, so what I want to know, is, what are the rules that the underscore syntax OK in the first case, but wrong in the second one?

 This the another mode or command that can detect and print out the home and end keys?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to write FFI bindings for librrd. My code can be found here: https://github.com/thomasbach-dev/hs-rrd/tree/context-bindings
 This is the first time I use FFI and I have not come very far. I can query the version of the library and do some calls to rrd_*_error which run but return empty results. So I'm not even sure I am missing something very basic here.
 This is what I observe: The tests in general run fine, until I enable the one defined here: https://github.com/thomasbach-dev/hs-rrd/blob/context-bindings/test/RRDTool/LowLevelSpec.hs#L41 which calls rrd_get_context. The tests simply crash then:
 $ cabal test --test-show-details=always Running 1 test suites... Test suite hs-rrd-test: RUNNING... Test suite hs-rrd-test: FAIL 
 Started in a repl I get the following:
 ghci> :add *RRDTool.LowLevel Ok, two modules loaded. ghci> rrd_get_context cabal: repl failed for hs-rrd-0.1.0.0. The build process segfaulted (i.e. SIGSEGV). 
 The code of rrd_get_context can be found here: https://github.com/oetiker/rrdtool-1.x/blob/2db8afce06e64f86133fae21b7b6b730df540293/src/rrd_thread_safe.c#L43 It basically does some calls to pthread.
 Can someone help on what to do next?
 EDIT: I looked into this a bit deeper. The problem actually does not seem to be the calls to pthread, but the way I read the rrd_context_t in Haskell (i.e. the peek). I changed my test to simply call the raw functions in C and look at the returned pointer address. That works ok and I do not get a null pointer. So I guess it has to be the peek which triggers the segmentation fault.
 This also happens when I simply call rrd_new_context which according to the C code ( https://github.com/oetiker/rrdtool-1.x/blob/2db8afce06e64f86133fae21b7b6b730df540293/src/rrd_error.c#L121) only does a malloc and then returns the pointer.
 So either the memory pointed to is already taken away from my process (not sure what the proper wording is here) or my Storable instance is broken.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I must be getting old. I've been trying to configure my init.el for org and org-roam, and I've gotten to where emacs starts without any error, I can open org-mode and I can open org-roam-mode. Then I'm stuck. Well, I did find that in org I can hit C-x C-f and open a *.org file and enter outline stuff, and save it, but I'm baffled by org-roam. Let's say I found some interesting ideas in the comment section of a blog in my browser. I assume that to record the note (zettel) I need to start emacs and get into org-roam-mode. What do I do then? I mean, what keys to I press to open a new note? How do I specify the type of note (main or reference, I'm starting out small)? Is there a tutorial anywhere that gives this kind of instruction for org-roam or zettelkasten?

 I'm currently moving my time tracking to org-mode after already using it for a few years.
 So far I've managed ok to transition/integrate org-mode in my caldav workflow.
 I found few problems that I have questions on:
  
I've used timestamps such as the one below in some entries however they don't seem to appear in my agenda buffer: <%%(and (diary-cyclic 14 31 3 2022) (diary-block 31 3 2022 30 3 2022)) 07:00-08:30> Is there anything that I need to do so that entries using those appear in my agenda?
 I've then tried to use something like `<2022-03-31 Do 07:00-08:00 UTC +2w> that works however if I include -1d to get a notification a day before they agenda doesn't show it for some reason.
 How does org-mode deal with timezones? I get some calendar invites that contain different timezones.

 It's one of the first working pieces of Haskell code I was able to write, and I'm sure it is written very naively. Keeping aside the obvious performance issues (which I'm not actually interested in solving at the moment), do you think there are ways I could improve it in terms of readability, program structure and use of the language features?
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Consider the following megaparsec parsers:  ab = string "a" >> string "b" ac = string "ac"  I want to parse them consequently, maybe adding some modifier two the first one (??? ab >> ac) to achieve the following behavior:
  
ab should be optional
 if both parsers fail, expectations of both parsers should be shown (or, at least the first one)
  
I've tried the following:
  
optional ab >> ac
 try (optional ab) >> ac
 optional (try ab) >> ac
  
The first, as expected, is not able to parse "ac", the second behaves identically to the first. The third is much better, but it doesn't satisfy the second condition: for input "az" it returns "expecting 'ac'", but not "expecting 'ab' or 'ac'". It's interesting, that if the first symbol doesn't match (for example, for "z"), the desired behavior is achieved. However, this is not enough in my case. How can I do this?
 This is my test code: ``` parsers :: [Parser String] parsers = [ optional ab >> ac , try (optional ab) >> ac , optional (try ab) >> ac ] where ab = string "a" >> string "b" ac = string "ac"
 strs :: [String] strs = ["abac", "ac", "z", "az"]
 test :: IO () test = for_ (parsers zip [1 ..]) $ (p, i) -> do putStrLn $ "parser " <> show i <> ":" for_ strs $ \str -> do putStrLn $ "string "<> show str <> ":" parseTest p str ```
 P.S. I've tried to write my one combinator for this issue, using observing or setState/getState, but have not achieved anything.

 I read Doubleloop’s blog post on his workflow, but as he stated in the improvement section,
  
I feel like I’m maintaining the flashcards separately from the body of my notes – it’s a bit of a duplication of effort. It’d be good to get a flow where the flashcard is just part of the note as is, and I can pull it out without duplicating it.
  
I tried to manipulate it a bit, and my current workflow is incorporating it directly into my notes.
 Take this note, for example, about Edge Devices,
 * Definition :PROPERTIES: :ANKI_DECK: Computer Networking :ANKI_NOTE_TYPE: Basic :ANKI_NOTE_ID: 1665541877624 :END: ** Front What are Edge Devices? ** Back - They are known as End-sytems or Hosts. These devices are divided into two groups: Clients and Servers. - These are the devices that recieves the internet as a service. *And, then here I continue with some more examples on the topic.* 
 And then I export it to Anki for reviewing.
 My question here is this a good workflow in the long run, as all my notes would take this shape?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 So I use both ef-themes and modus-themes by Prots as my themes, and I really like the fact that we can customize the org-mode headings by level.
 This is done with this configuration (from ef-themes manual)
 (setq ef-themes-headings ; read the manual's entry or the doc string '((0 . (variable-pitch light 1.9)) (1 . (variable-pitch light 1.8)) (2 . (variable-pitch regular 1.7)) (3 . (variable-pitch regular 1.6)) (4 . (variable-pitch regular 1.5)) (5 . (variable-pitch 1.4)) ; absence of weight means `bold' (6 . (variable-pitch 1.3)) (7 . (variable-pitch 1.2)) (t . (variable-pitch 1.1)))) 
 As far as I understand, we can only configure 8 level, I thought that the last line would set the themes for every subsequent level, but this is not the case in my experience. When I create a ninth level heading, it goes back to the style of the first level.
 This make it weird and not really attractive with file with many levels of subheadings.
 ​
 I don't know if we can overcome this limitation, if so I would be interested in knowing how.
 My second thought was to disable the theming in a specific buffer. But I wasn't able to do it by making the variable local. Is there a way to do that ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Usually, one doesn't encounter new simple monads in the wild, they're nearly all combinations of existing transformers. But I don't know of an existing transformer capturing this:
 data RandomT m a = RandomT { getRandomT :: RandomSeed -> m a } split :: RandomSeed -> (RandomSeed, RandomSeed) instance Monad m => Monad (RandomT m) where RandomT action >>= f = RandomT $ \seed -> do let (seed', seed'') = split seed a <- action seed' getRandomT (f a) seed'' 
 On first glance, you'd say "wait, that's just a reader", but in fact it isn't because of the split function. This could be generalized with this type class:
 class CoSemigroup a where split :: a -> (a, a) 
 While there are no nontrivial comonoids in Haskell, could there be nontrivial semigroups (although I'm not sure whether random seeds are an example because of coassociativity)? If not, do random monads implemented this way actually obey the associativity laws?
 Is this transformer implemented in general somewhere?

 I just installed and configured org-super-agenda-mode.
 I'm using it inside org-agenda-custom-command
 Unfortunately this only works if I enable org-super-agenda mode manually after emacs started:
 M-x org-super-agenda-mode C-c a rd # to open my custom view 
 I really read the documentation telling me to us setq.
 Here's my code: 
 (setq org-agenda-custom-commands '(("rd" "MyView" ((agenda "" ((org-agenda-span 2) (org-super-agenda-groups '((:name "Today" :time-grid t :date today :todo "TODAY" :scheduled today :order 1) (:discard (:anything t)) )))) (alltodo "" ((org-agenda-overriding-header "") (org-agenda-sorting-strategy '(deadline-up)) (org-super-agenda-groups '((:name "Important" :property "urgent" :order 1) (:name "Überfällig" :deadline past :order 2) (:name "Heute fällig" :deadline today :order 3) (:name "Current Taks" :todo ("InProgress" "INPROGRESS") :order 4) (:name "Next ToDos" :todo ("InputQueue" "INPUTQUEUE") :order 5) (:name "Drafts" :todo "DRAFT" :order 6) )))))) ("inf" "InfAgenda" tags "filename={INFIT}"( (org-agenda-skip-function '(org-agenda-skip-entry-if 'notregexp "\\* InProgress\\|\\* InputQueue\\|* Waiting\\|* DRAFT\\|* ToDo\\|* Backlog\\|* INPUTQUEUE\\|* INPROGRESS")) (org-agenda-sorting-strategy '(deadline-up)) (org-agenda-view-columns-initially t))) ("w" todo "Waiting") ("iq" todo "InputQueue") ("ip" todo "InProgress") ("d" todo "DRAFT") ("y" agenda*) )) 
 How can I get this to work automatically for the custom command "rd".

 I download packages manually and use use-package without :ensure to configure them. I managed to configure a very basic system with ivy, swiper, evil (+collection). The main goal is convenient org-mode use.
 Do you have any tips for such an offline situation? I admit its quite a chore to do all the config and package installation manually.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all! This post isn’t just about vuiet but this is my main issue right now. Using spacemacs on pop! OS I recently decided to start adding some extended features and working on my config. Eventually I managed to get lastfm.el and Vuiet working together and it’s awesome! I think I’ve figured out how to make a script with new keybinds for the Vuiet stuff I need to use, but some features are broken, namely searching songs by lyrics. I’m not sure how to debug emacs scripts so if anyone has any suggestions, including a better player, I’m open. Also, I’m shopping around for a completion module, mostly for Python but also C and HTML.
 Edit:
 Vuiet is cool, but seems like a lost cause. I think the only functionality EMMS doesn’t have that Vuiet did, though, is searching by artist for stuff I don’t actually have. 
 My main problem at this point is how to add an SMB share to EMMS.

I recently interviewed with a job that ultimately passed me because I didn't have a ton of experience with Scala and they really wanted someone with hands on. 
 So my question is, how would you go about learning a bigger chunk of the language? I have started researching how to write a ray tracer and plan on doing that as a way to broaden my exposure to the language but besides that what else could I do to show I know my way around?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There's a bad dynamic in America's STEM education where kids going into college computer science out of high school hit a brick wall . . . largely made of math they've never seen before. In general, CS is not at all what they thought it would be. Then they switch/flunk out. So if higher-ed physics, engineering, math has a long, gentle preparatory on-ramp in K-12 with math, comp-sci has absolutely nothing -- or maybe just some "learn to code." And so I've been trying to put together a high-school-level on-ramp for real CS . And I'm basing it on Haskell. Why Haskell? Because the top-tier schools all do some sort of typed functional programming eventually. Functional seems to be the fault line between the top schools and the 2nd-tier. So for example I mix in discrete math with Haskell. You could say I'm high-school-izing the Doets, van Eijck text The Haskell Road to Logic, Maths, and Programming. Or even the Paulson ML for the Working Programmer, another fantastic book. Great, you might say. Trouble is I'm all alone -- as far as I know. For example, if you look at the AP Computer Science stuff, it's basically learn to program Java with a smattering of data structures and algorithms tacked on. Not really much help for a kid walking into Cornell or CMU. Every high school effort I've come across so far has hardly ever been more than "learn to code," typically Python. So my question to you is, should I keep going -- or give it up for a bad job? Am I really on to something, or am I tilting at windmills? The fact that I'm so alone on this is ominous. I've contacted lots of big name professors -- and they're sympathetic but in the long run apathetic simply because they're awash in 96th-percentile applicants. Yeah.... Your ideas would be appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I binded a function open-file-at-cursor. This allows me to open the file directly from a file (given I've written down the correct path). Now, I want to use something like this where I can give the file paths as environment variable. I've been struggling but couldn't find anything related to this. Please help!
 Edit: Noting down the use case for this
 Let's assume we have a file in path - /home/user/dir1/dir2/file.txt
 I've set some env variable $TEST=/home/user/dir1
 In some other file (let's name it file2.f under dir2), I've mentioned following two lines:
 ../file.txt
 $TEST/dir2/file.txt
 With the "open-file-at-cursor" bind, I'm able to directly open a file.txt when my cursor is on 1st line. However, the same bind breaks down for line 2. I'm expecting both lines to open the same file. ffap does not solve my issue as it opens the final directory that holds my file(this will increase my keystrokes).
 Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everybody! Haskell caught my attention because of its powerful type system. I come from a math background so I thought it'd be fun to implement some theorems in abstract algebra in Haskell. From what I understand, there are classes of functions in Haskell like <> for example which represents an associative operation. What I'd really like is to implement a homomorphism type that sends f (x * y) to f(x) * f(y). The trouble I am having is that in mathematics we will always demand a proof that a map is a homomorphism before we give it its status as one. Is this not the case in Haskell? In other words, do we need to manually check that an operation is a homomorphism or is there some way for Haskell to recognize one (perhaps with a bit of assistance from the programmer/type system/something else)?

 I want to create a database that keeps track of all people that have access to some data. The database is shared by a couple of organizations, sub groups of that organization and specific characters/addresses/people/user within that organization on one table.
 Traditionally I would just use a hashmap of some nature.. the hashmap could look up the user and we would know what organization they are apart of and we could easily remove that person from the organization access table.
 But if we have an organization of 10million addresses/users that seems like a bad idea.
 SO the alternative idea is to create a set theory or a list of rules and if the user is apart of the table.

 Is there a way to allow a user to fill out an Org Capture template without having to fill out each section via the minibuffer?
 I ask because my keyboard kind of sucks and eats inputs sometimes, so the workflow gets jenk a bit. I would rather have some kind of checklist or small buffer that goes through each prompt than getting prompted by the mini buffer each time.
 Please let me know if this could be fixed by a package instead as well, thanks!

I'm only able to achieve word-level accuracy on reverse sync search. On forward sync search, the arrow that appears in the left-hand margin of the PDF preview buffer can be off by as much as a half-dozen lines.
 Is there a way to configure AucTeX + PDF Tools in order to highlight the word in the PDF Tools preview buffer corresponding to where the cursor is positioned in the AucTeX latex source buffer during a forward search instead of placing an arrow in the left-hand margin, which by construction can only be line-level accurate at best?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Im trying to have both to be displayed in the occur buffer title name. The buffer name from where the regexp is from and also the regexp too.
 I know about occur-rename-buffer but that gives only the buffer name not the regexp. When I run ibuffer I see this: *Occur: init.el* and *Occur: init.el*<2>. That's not very practical. Something like: *Occur: init.el*<defun> and *Occur: init.el*<global-set-key> would be much better.
 I've found this: rename-occur-buffer-term which it does display the regexp but not the buffer-name :/ I tried to put both together but my e-lisp knowledge is very, very limited atm. 
 Is anybody here already have a fix for this?

The pool is instantiated lazily with no open connections
 Connections are acquired when requested
 Each connection is exposed as an fs2.Stream[IO, R] where R is the type of the connection
 Each connection is checked for error before release–if error, then dispose of the connection instead of releasing it back into the pool
 The connection pool as a whole is instantiated as a Resource[IO, ConnectionPool[R]] and all open connections are released when the pool is released
  
I would appreciate if anyone could take a look at my code and offer any thoughts/feedback/critiques.

 Below is my Emms config:

 For example: I'm using python and I want to use numpy and matplotlib. I don't want to copy the lib import everytime I do a block of code, so I create another block at the start of the file where I import my libs, and when I execute another block of code this one loads before.
 There's a way to do that, or I have to copy the imports everytime?

The speedbar can be a hassle to work with when I have emacs running fullscreen.
 My question really isn't different from this question that was asked six years ago:
 Speedbar in GUD - gdb debugger and watch expressions
 but there were no satisfactory answers then, and I'm wondering if that has changed at all. Are there any customizations or packages available that would let me monitor watch variables without requiring the speedbar?

 Spacemacs wants to install evil-escape, but it does not seem to exist.
 https://github.com/syl20bnr/evil-escape (Claims the package exists in Melpa)
 https://melpa.org/#/?q=esca (this query shows evil-escape does NOT exist in Melpa)
 https://melpa.org/#/?q=evil (this query also fails to find evil-escape)
 So... what da heck? I hate to do this improperly but do I need to manually download evil-escape from github (first link) and stick it in the .emacs.d folder myself? Or is Melpa broken? Or spacemacs?

I use a lot of latex equations that I label with #+NAME and reference with internal org links, as these work both in org-mode and turn into into latex references on export. The only thing missing is a quick way to be able to pick from previous equations to reference, like how reftex does it for normal .tex editing. Is there perhaps some existing library that solves this problem?

 Ever wanted to write a function or command, but don't know what the functions for say manipulating buffers or getting file names are called?
 Version 28 of emacs introduced a new feature called shortdoc. It gives an overview over available elisp functions in a few select categories. Use the command M-x shortdoc-display-group and then type in which category you want to view and a buffer pops up giving you a brief overview.
 Give it a shot. Its great!

 I'm now getting to reading (and taking notes on) a number of publications in epub / pdf format mostly.
 I'd love to hear how everyone is dealing with references in books. My own (planned at this point) system would be to highlight passages in texts and paraphrase them in org-roam nodes.
 M-x highlight seems like the key here - is those highlights something I can reference from org-roam?
 bddean's ereader and nov.el look appealing, especially with nov-xwidget.el for formatting on the latter.
 Should I spend time exploring both of these, or am I missing the point?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I do grok Vi(m). Used Emacs mostly for coding and org. I've been using Spacemacs for a couple of years, switched to Doom, used it for 2 years too. Lately due to work stuff, I've been using VSCode (not gonna get into details with this)
 Everywhere I edit text, I'd use the Vim keymap, it is already an extension of my mind in some way and I feel crampled when working without it.
 Lately, I've started building my Emacs config from scratch, to abstract myself from the computer I'm using and start gravitating towards using Emacs more as an OS rather than a code editor.
 I've been avoiding to use evil-mode and friends for two reasons:
  
I'd need to configure all the unimaginable keybindings to work properly with other packages (I'm aware of evil-collection though)
 I feel like the Emacs keybindings are designed like that in some way and that the part of the community that doesn't use evil works in the same level of efficiency or better due to tighter integration between packages.
  
My question would be: 
 Is it worth the effort I'm taking to learn the Emacs keybindings, or is it just "a different way of doing the same things"?

 It seems that the way that Emacs can (eventually) use an AST built by tree-sitter to do syntax highlighting on program code should be applicable to natural languages using NLP libraries that build syntax trees.
 Here is a non-Emacs example: https://english.edward.io/

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Howdy. It would be much easier for me to do my note-taking if org-roam-node-find had the following behavior: - Pressing TAB changes the text in the search bar to whatever the suggestion list has highlighted. I'd like it to just replace the entire thing instead of doing that default step-by-step completion if possible. - Pressing ENTER opens or creates the exact match of what's entered in the org-roam-node-find search bar. 
 Currently, I'm having some issues. My PKM note hierarchy uses dots as delimiters. Take the note res.lore.sw as an example (my note about Star Wars). I created it first. Now I want to create res.lore as an index for all the lores I've written about, but org-roam-node-find won't let me create it, because it matches with the Star Wars note and opens it. I'd instead like to be able to either press TAB to set the highlighted file as the new search, or press ENTER to open or create the exact note id entered into the search bar.
 My current org-roam config is pretty much the minimum:  (use-package org-roam :ensure t :init (setq org-roam-v2-ack t) :custom (org-roam-directory "REDACTED") (org-roam-complete-everywhere t) (org-roam-capture-templates '(("d" "default" plain "%?" :if-new (file+head "${title}.org" "#+title: ${title}\n#+date: %U\n") :unnarrowed t))) :config (org-roam-setup) (org-roam-db-autosync-mode))

However, eglot does not seem to work well with either RMarkdown or Quarto documents as it hangs every time entering when enter a code chunk (up to 5 seconds or so). I am guessing it does this because it disconnects when entering the markdown mode and then needs to reconnect again. I am not sure. 
 I have two questions.
  
How might I be able to overcome this re-connection(?) issue with quarto or rmarkdown documents and still use eglot?
 Alternatively, how can I enable eglot just for *.r or *.R files and not just for ess-r-mode?

 (setq package-selected-packages '(use-package lsp-mode lsp-ui lsp-treemacs dap-mode company-mode flycheck prism aggressive-indent haskell-mode lsp-haskell)) 
 Then, I added this to my init.el (I use use-package):
 (use-package flycheck :init (global-flycheck-mode)) 
 However, even after doing that, when I open Emacs, I still get this error:
 Error (use-package): flycheck/:init: Symbol’s function definition is void: global-flycheck-mode
 It's strange, because even though I installed flycheck, the function seems to be undefined. The use-package configuration is what they recommend on their website, as well (scroll to find the use-package section), so I don't think the problem is calling (global-flycheck-mode).
 Does anyone have tips for what I should do next?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone,
 I have a created a class called Task that contains SignalRef and then an instance from that class
 case class Task(id: String,, cancel: IO[SignallingRef[IO, Boolean]]) val task = Task(randomUUID().toString, SignallingRef[IO, Boolean](false)) 
 Thereafter, I put the task in a Map and calling it from two different streams.
 The first one is called from an HTTP request to set its value to “true”
  case DELETE -> Root / "tasks" / UUIDVar(taskId) => taskMap.get(taskId.toString) match { case Some(task) => for{ switch <- task.cancel _ <- switch.set(true).start >> IO.println("canceled") res <- Ok(task.toOutput.asJson) } yield res case None => NotFound("Not Found") 
 and the other one is called from a "stream.interruptWhen" to cancel the stream when the value become "true"
  val httpStream = for { cancelSwitch <- Stream.eval(task.cancel) httpStream <- client .stream(req) .flatMap(_.body) .through(decodeUsingHeaders[CsvRow[String]]()) .interruptWhen(cancelSwitch) .map(x => x.toMap) .map(x => x.asJson.noSpaces + "\n") .through(text.utf8.encode) .through(Files[IO].writeAll(Path(s"jsons/${task.id}.json"), Flags.Write)) } yield httpStream httpStream.compile.drain 
 And it appears that I am doing something wrong because they don't communicate with each other.
 P.S. I am Golang developer interested in the functional programming of Scala and its libraries CE3, FS2 and ZIO

org-mode outline, that you see whole content, like in google map, you see whole world and you can zoom in to see continents, then countries, cities, districts, streets etc. and then can easy zoom out.
 
textinfo you can only go to next/previous or direct node, page, section, paragraph, without zoom in zoom out

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm newer to Haskell (know the syntax, some of the ideas behind certain stuff, but haven't used it for anything serious), and I've always heard that Haskell based some of it's concepts on category theory (monads, hask). Are there more abstract concepts in Haskell? Such as higher category theory and the Yoneda lemma. I've heard category theory be described as the linguistics of mathematics, so it only makes sense for it to have actually been used on a language.

 For comparison, if I use the same body on a method, it works as expected. Appreciate any explanation or pointer to where I can read more about this.
 Note: I'm using Scala 2 in case that matter.
 lazy val sumVal: (Int, List[Int]) => Int = (acc, numbers) => numbers match { case head :: tail => sumVal(acc + head, tail) case _ => acc } def sum(acc: Int, numbers: List[Int]): Int = { numbers match { case head :: tail => sum(acc + head, tail) case _ => acc } } val numbers = List.fill(10000)(2) sum(0, numbers) // this works as expected sumVal(0, numbers) // this blows up with a stack overflow

 I use Doom Emacs with lsp enabled. 
 I develop in PHP using Laravel framework. There's a package called laravel-ide-helper that creates stub classes to help on IDE completion for properties and magic methods. 
 The problem is, when I x-ref-find I get two results, one for the correct method and another for the stub (they are all in a file called _ide_helper.php). 
 Is there a way I can filter out these results? Maybe blacklist the filename somehow?
 Thanks in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I came across this stackoverflow post and tried to implement my own StateIO monad where I could perform IO actions. Here is my code:
 {-# LANGUAGE MultiParamTypeClasses #-} {-# LANGUAGE FunctionalDependencies #-} {-# LANGUAGE FlexibleInstances #-} import Control.Monad.Trans import Control.Monad (ap, liftM) newtype StateIO s a = StateIO {runStateIO :: s -> IO (a, s)} instance Functor (StateIO s) where fmap = liftM instance Applicative (StateIO s) where pure = return (<*>) = ap instance Monad (StateIO s) where return a = StateIO $ \s -> return (a, s) n >>= k = StateIO $ \s -> do (a, s') <- runStateIO n s runStateIO (k a) s instance MonadIO (StateIO s) where liftIO io = StateIO $ \st -> do x <- io return (x, st) class Monad m => MonadStateIO s m | m -> s where getSt :: m s putSt :: s -> m () instance MonadStateIO s (StateIO s) where getSt = StateIO $ \st -> return (st,st) putSt st = StateIO $ const $ return ((),st) 
 Then I run a simple program where the user inputs a positive integer n and I return the first n fibonacci numbers with the use of the StateIO monad. 
 type FibNums = [Int] main :: IO () main = do putStrLn "How many fibonacci numbers do you want to see:" n <- (read <$> getLine) :: IO Int let initialState = [n,0,1] process initialState process :: FibNums -> IO () process st = do (finished, newSt) <- runStateIO addFib st print finished -- for debugging print newSt -- for debugging if finished then do putStrLn "Fibonacci numbers are:" print $ tail newSt else process newSt addFib :: StateIO FibNums Bool addFib = do st <- getSt let newSt = st ++ [last st + last (init st)] finished = length (tail newSt) == head newSt liftIO $ print newSt -- for debugging putSt newSt return finished 
 The problem is in the function addFib the line "putSt newSt" does not really update the FibNums state variable and the initial state is returned. So the program loops on forever. 
 Any ideas what am I missing?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I often find myself switching between Emacs and terminal (e.g. xterm). A typical example is to run a test suite after editing some code. For years, I've been looking for a clean way to send code directly to a terminal without copy-pasting, and I think I finally found it. Best hack I've come up with in 12 years of using this editor. Here it is:
  
Install the absolutely excellent vterm package:https://github.com/akermu/emacs-libvterm
 Create the following script, put it somewhere reasonable:#!/bin/bashemacsclient -e "(progn (vterm) (vterm-send-string \"$*\") (vterm-send-return))"
 Install ob-tmux and configure:https://github.com/ahendriksen/ob-tmux(setq org-babel-tmux-terminal "<PATH TO THE BASH SCRIPT ABOVE>")(setq org-babel-tmux-terminal-opts nil)
 Enjoy!
 (e.t.a: with (setq vterm-enable-manipulate-selection-data-by-osc52 t) you also get integration between tmux visual mode and the kill-ring, which depending on your habits may be a more ergonomic way to copy/paste between terminal and emacs)

 As part of a project at university, I'm looking to formalize and implement a small DSL for proving statements in first-order logic based on Fitch notation. I'm going to implement this in Haskell.
 The implementation itself would not be a huge problem if I were to go by intuition alone, seeing as natural deduction in first-order logic is quite simple. However, since this is a project for university, I wanted to ask if you guys can recommend some interesting papers on various techniques and approaches (e.g. dependent type theory) that might be of use to me?
 Thanks!

 For those who want to understand the theory behind dependent types I have written a paper which describes in a textbook style dependent types in its purest form encountered in the Calculus of Constructions.
 It is a paper for mathematically oriented readers.

 I am an emacs beginner and I am running into this annoying issue where pressing Control-Basckscpace brings up the help menu, which is the same as pressing Control-h. I want to remap C-Backspace to the function backward-kill word but keep C-h for help.
 Currently, I have M-Backspace mapped to backward-kill-word be default, but I do not want to get used to that one because I use C-Backspace outside of Emacs. What is the best solution here? I have looked online and did not find solutions that work exactly like I want. Some remapped C-h which is not what I want to do.
 I am using wsl 2 ubuntu if that matters at all.

 But i can't make it work with yasnippet, instructions are:

 (use-package yasnippet :ensure t :config (setq yas-snippet-dirs '(;; (substitute-in-file-name "${CFG}/Emacs/snippets/") ;; (lambda () (substitute-in-file-name "${CFG}/Emacs/snippets/")) ;; (concat (getenv "CFG") "/Emacs/snippets/") ;; (lambda () (concat (getenv "CFG") "/Emacs/snippets/")) "~/snippets/" ) ) (setq yas-indent-line 'fixed) (yas-global-mode 1) )

 For some reason, persp-mode isn’t loaded on initialization. What’s more interesting is it doesn’t load if I run persp-mode after Emacs is loaded, I have to execute persp-mode two times for it to work properly. Working properly for me means that C-c w prefix works.
 Any idea what I’m doing wrong?

 "type" can have a lot of values and in essence decides what "someObject" will be. I will omit moreFieldsAlwaysKnown for brevity. 
 I like typesafety so I naively thought I would encode this statically to make it users of my lib very difficult to create invalid values and track everything on the typelevel. In essence:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I asked this question already on the Haskell discourse site, but asking here again for more opinion. 
 I’m trying to pick a language for a project I’m working on. Think of something like distributed redis with more persistent data structures and a schema. If you had to pick, would you build something like this with Haskell or would you stick with something like Rust or C++? Especially considering the query language for the database is more functional (term level haskell-like).

 What would be a good symbol to use for reblog/retweet/share option? Looking for suggestions - preferably a unicode symbol.

 I need to do a project using Spark in Scala.

 I am having difficulty in the initial setup, many guides are confusing and unclear.
 What should I do to start a scale project?

 I would like to use the VisualStudio code.
 Can you suggest a procedure to follow or a clear guide?

 class DoerOfStuff { def doItThisWay(arg1, arg2, arg3, arg4, arg5)(implicit user: String): ResultType { performCheck() helper(arg1, arg2, TYPE_ARG_A, arg3, arg4, arg5) } def doItThatWay(arg1, arg2, arg3, arg4, arg5)(implicit user: String): ResultType { performCheck() helper(arg1, arg2, TYPE_ARG_B, arg3, arg4, arg5) } def doItAnotherWay(arg1, arg2, arg3, arg4, arg5)(implicit user: String): ResultType { performCheck() helper(arg1, arg2, TYPE_ARG_C, arg3, arg4, arg5) } } 
 Where helper and performCheck require the implicit user argument. Actually there's almost identical calls to more than one helper (and more than 5 params, don't get me started about that), but I think the pattern is clear.
 I'd like to refactor that into something like
 class DoerOffStuff { doIt(typeArg) { (arg1, arg2, arg3, arg4, arg5) => { performCheck() helper(arg1, arg2, typeArg, arg3, arg4,arg5) } } val doItThisWay = doIt(TYPE_ARG_A) val doItThatWay = doIt(TYPE_ARG_B) val doItAnotherWay = doIt(TYPE_ARG_C) } 
 I want to avoid having to type the argument list in the class definition, so I wanted to stick with val instead.
 Is there a way I can do that?
 I tried
 class DoerOffStuff { doIt(typeArg) { (arg1, arg2, arg3, arg4, arg5)(implicit user) => { performCheck() helper(arg1, arg2, typeArg, arg3, arg4,arg5) } } val doItThisWay = doIt(TYPE_ARG_A) val doItThatWay = doIt(TYPE_ARG_B) val doItAnotherWay = doIt(TYPE_ARG_C) } 
 but the the type checker will say "could not find implicit value for parameter user" for all places of ... = doIt(...)

 I have several common workflows which involve switching between buffers for files (that is, switching between buffers if the relevant file is already visited, or opening a new buffer visiting the file if not). There are generally two or three buffers or files in each group. I don't particularly need any new workflow tools for switching between groups, just between files within a group. What's important though is that these workflows are about switching between different types of file -- it would be very cumbersome to add all of the different pairs manually.

 Hi guys. I know this must be possible. But can you give me some examples in Haskell? Something like representing naturals and booleans with types, writing plus and if/else for them, etc.
 ​
 BTW, is Haskell's type inference engine Turing complete? I guess the answer is no. But why? Does UndecidableInstances have anything to do with this?
 ​
 Obviously, this question doesn't have a lot of practical value. It's a rabbit hole. Sorry for that. I'm just interested. And would be glad to hear from FP experts in our Reddit giving me some hints.

 Thanks all for your informative replies! I have had a busy day. Read your comments tomorrow!

The server needs some css and js files that I can include with juliusFile and luciusFile from the shakespeare library. If I add the files to extra-source-files in my cabal file the modules that need them even get automatically rebuild, when I change one of them.
 But I don’t want to write plain javascript or css. I‘d much rather write sass or typescript. So I need to compile those files so js or css if their source changes.
 Right now I use a custom build script with a custom buildHook that extracts the extra-source-files from the cabal file and builds them according to some build rules written in shake.
 How are bigger projects accomplishing this? Are they just using a makefile. Are they dropping cabal alltogether and only use shake? I know thats what GHC is doing, with their hadrian build system.
 I would love to hear of your experiences with different approaches! And yes I am procrastinating writing the thing I want to write really hard right now.

 After interacting with some redditors and doing some more research I wrote this comment where I concluded that the way Sublime Text handles line composed of whitespace is the most intuitive for me, at least when editing Python source files. Which can be summarized as:
 If I'm editing a buffer with the following Python code
 if⋅True:$ ⋅⋅⋅⋅if⋅True:$ ⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅print('2x⋅True')$ ⋅⋅⋅⋅| 
 where ⋅ represents a space, $ represents a newline and | represents the cursor, if I press Return I want Emacs to end up like
 if⋅True:$ ⋅⋅⋅⋅if⋅True:$ ⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅print('2x⋅True')$ $ ⋅⋅⋅⋅| 
 instead of
 if⋅True:$ ⋅⋅⋅⋅if⋅True:$ ⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅print('2x⋅True'…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently upgraded my Macbook to Monterey, and noticed a bunch of linker warnings:
 ld: warning: -undefined dynamic_lookup may not work with chained fixups 
 I've already cleared out ~/.stack, so it should not be using any old artifacts, with all artifacts being rebuilt on 12.6.
 It's not that big of a deal, but it would be nice to get rid of it.
 Note: I was running into warnings like
 ld: warning: dylib (/usr/local/opt/postgresql@12/lib/libpq.dylib) was built for newer macOS version (12.0) than being linked (11.1) 
 I fixed this by completely uninstalling Homebrew, reinstalling xcode-select, and reinstalling everything. I suspect I'm getting this new warning because xcode-select upgraded ld.

My apologies if the title sounds vague, I'm looking for advice or project ideas to secure an introduction to frameworks such as Play,‍ Akka and Spark. and to how they are being used in real world applications. I have some background in Rust, so getting familiar with Scala was pretty straightforward. I'm loving the language a lot and how natural it feels. However, I would like to start building some hobby projects by using the aforementioned frameworks if possible, but I'm not really sure where to start, or which of them is more beginner-intermediate-friendly. May I ask; does anyone mind suggesting a learning roadmap or drop some project suggestions/ideas? I'd deeply appreciate it. Thank you in advance. Stay safe and healthy everyone.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A friend at an old workplace told me this morning that his boss told him they were all switching to VSCode and it was going to be a company mandate. It's not the first time I've heard people be dismissive of long time Emacs/Vim users. My last personal experience was someone telling me flat out I was wasting company time playing around with Emacs rather than using Pycharm.
 I have also gotten into long arguments that devolve into "feature-offs" where I have to explain how a feature VSCode has is also in Emacs. I tried to explain that you can use GDB in Emacs, and someone literally laughed at me because GDB is "ancient" and VSCode's debugging is modern and actually gets stuff done. It seems like even if Emacs can do something it's also A. Not good enough B. Takes too long to configure instead of just getting the job done.
 So please give me some advice on how I should combat this encroachment on my peaceful Emacs pasture. Or should I just give up my goats and switch to VSCode?

 Im having a lot of fun taking my university (electronic engineering) notes in org-mode, using org-fragtog to toggle org-latex-preview and see math equations take life in real time.
 I'd really like to do the same thing with circuits, so I'm trying to use these tikz and circuitikz packages that let you draw circuits in latex.
 It compiles just fine, in fact when I export to pdf (SPC-m-e-l-o) the drawings are there.
 org-latex-preview also seem to try, very hard the first times I go over something, so my best guess is it's actually compiling and actually thinking it's showing it regularly, but no it doesn't. 
 Has someone had any similar experience? or any idea on how to move forward? 
 Thank you guys

 and then negation normal form
 nnf :: Form -> Form nnf (Var p) = Var p nnf (C p) = C p nnf (Not (Not p)) = nnf p nnf (p :/\: q) = nnf p :/\: nnf q nnf (p :\/: q) = nnf p :\/: nnf q nnf (Not (p :/\: q)) = (Not p) :\/: (Not q) nnf (Not (p :\/: q)) = (Not p) :/\: (Not q) nnf (Not p) = Not $ nnf p 
 and disjunctive normal form
 dnf :: Form -> Form dnf (Var s) = ((Var s)) dnf (p :\/: q) = (dnf p) :/\: (dnf q) dnf (p :/\: q) = undefined dnf (Not (Not p)) = dnf p dnf (Not (p :/\: q)) = (dnf $ Not p) :/\: (dnf $ Not q) dnf (Not (p :\/: q)) = undefined dnf (Not (Var s)) = Not (Var s) 
 i am struggling to get my dnf function to work properly or finding a correct approach. ive been using the nnf as reference for myself but any help/ suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was inspired by a question at the end of the Being lazy without being bloated presentation about the library nothunks, which asked if it was possible to do the same check statically.
 I managed to come up with a type class IsStrict which will give a type error if there is a non-strict field anywhere, at any depth, in the data structure given, explaining where the non-strict field is.
 Here it is in a gist: https://gist.github.com/anka-213/440cfef8c8712f5df747029640cfe170
 For example, if one were to ask if String is strict, it would give this error:  Found lazy field of type Char • In constructor: : • In type: [Char] • When checking strictness of: String Found lazy field of type [Char] • In constructor: : • In type: [Char] • When checking strictness of: String 
 It still works if we put the string inside some other data type, e.g. a strict pair ``` data StrictPair a b = P !a !b deriving Generic
 -- Non-strict type in strict field -- >>> nfStrict @(StrictPair Int String) -- Found lazy field of type Char -- • In constructor: : -- • In type: [Char] -- • In strict field of type [Char] -- • In constructor: P -- • In type: StrictPair Int String -- • When checking strictness of: StrictPair Int String -- ... ```
 This is of course more strict than checking nothunks, since you might have forced the data in some other way, so the data is thunk-free without having the data type be fully strict.

 https://gist.github.com/LucyJohnson-lua4life/e8c97bf931b7fd5795f5b9b22739c19d.
 I started "slime" and executed "slime-compile-and-load-file" on hello.cl, then i moved my cursor to the "some-function" symbol and executed "slime-who-calls". By now I would expect slime to show me the 3 other lines where "some-function" was executed but instead i got "No references found for some-function".
 Can somebody explain me how to fix this, or how to debug that?

 ​
 I use Evernote to store my notes and access them on all platforms (Ubuntu/Linux, iOS, macOS). Apple platform has great desktop apps, but Evernote on Linux sucks. Are there any good Evernote modes available, so I can just use Emacs?

By mistake I pressed a key that i shouldn't( I don't remember which one) and the file was moved somewhere but I cannot find where. I used find, and locate but nothing. I don't have a trash can folder on my system so its rather impossible to have moved it there by mistake. 
 Does emacs, or dired provide any sort of "history of moved files" or something similar that will help me find the file?

 the only thing i miss is being able to see the code actions available in the modeline and the project error list from flymake (not just the current buffer) in the modeline.
 It would be nice if there was a way to go to the previous/next error in project.
 anyone would know how to do that?
 flymake-show-project-diagnostics with eglot is so much better than lsp-treemacs tho, i love it just for that...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Having recently been bitten by an unexpected failed Future, I was wondering if there is anything like a "safe" wrapper for Futures. Basically, the goal is to make concurrent API's inside an application not to have the hidden back-channel behaviour, yet still be composable in the usual way. A minimal implementation might be on the base Future to do a .transformWith(t => Future.successful(t.toEither)) and then return that or wrap in EitherT, maybe wrapping either of those result types.
 Would need to support stack-safe flatMap for Cats-effect. 
 Just speculating, thinking aloud here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Let's say I'm trying to wean myself off the actor model. I've grown used to thinking of systems as supervision trees. How to represent these trees without actors? E.g., let's imagine this tree structure is my app:
 - app: my app - scheduler: should wake up every quarter hour (0m, 15m, 30m, 45m) and perform a task - my_svc_pool: connection pool to a service that is called from within the scheduled task - my_svc: connection to my service - my_svc: another connection to my service 
 So let's say scheduler wakes up, tries to run its task by calling out to my_svc_pool, but the particular connection that it got routed to in the pool happened to get disconnected right before that. So the service call fails and scheduler blows up and goes away, leaving my app running without the 15-minute scheduled tasks that were supposed to happen.
 How would you structure an app with futures or tasks or any effect system (leaving aside actors) to supervise the system as a whole such that:
  
If a service connection in the connection pool happened to get disconnected and we just found out, my_svc_pool should safely dispose of it and replace it
 If scheduler blows up on waking up and trying to perform its task, app should replace it with a fresh one

In this post I will describe the approach that I’ve recently introduced in rules_haskell

Why even bother?
All software needs to be tested and verified, and Bazel rules are no exception. Some of them are
popular public libraries with a lot of projects depending on them, and they need a proper test set
to allow every contributor, frequent or occasional, to propose a change with little risk of breaking the
public API those rules represents. The same applies to the rules that live in huge monorepos growing every day,
where they often act as a glue between different components and can become complex, tricky and fragile.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello there pretty people, an emacs newbie here, and would love some help.
 When I insert a new line in my Java file, I get a lovely, sexy tab for indentation inserted automatically.
 When I press the backspace key to delete the tab, all my tabs are changed into spaces. This disgusts me. It angers me. I am close to homicidal.
 Does anyone know how to stop this?
 I have tried running "indent-tabs-mode t", but that does nothing, which makes sense, because tabs are already enabled.
 The functionality I want is simple. Tabs for indentation, spaces for alignment. When I delete a tab, it deletes the tab. When I delete a space, it deletes the space.
 I've been googling for quite a while, and can't seem to figure it out.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I'm creating a wrapper around a pre-compiled C library (GLFW, I know bindings exist, it's for figuring out how to use the Haskell FFI in a practical setting), and I haven't been able to figure out how to get stack to include the C headers in the build. 
 This means that my build works, but I get a number of warnings about implicit function declarations during compilation. e.g.:
 C:\Users\****\AppData\Local\Temp\ghc23648_0\ghc_5.c:8:61: error: warning: implicit declaration of function 'glfwInit' [-Wimplicit-function-declaration] 8 | HsInt32 ghczuwrapperZC1ZCmainZCMainZCglfwInit(void) {return glfwInit();} [...] 8 | HsInt32 ghczuwrapperZC1ZCmainZCMainZCglfwInit(void) {return glfwInit();} 
 I figured out how to add C libraries in package.yaml with extra-lib-dirs: and extra-libraries:. Unfortunately, when I browse the internet, the field it suggests for adding headers in Cabal, includes:, doesn't actually get recognized by Stack:
 C:\Users\****\Workspace\Testing\ffitest\package.yaml: Ignoring unrecognized field $.executables.ffitest-exe.includes 
 Just to be sure, I tried to use the same field in stack.yaml instead, just in case it would be recognized there. It causes the same error.
 What is the appropriate way to include C header files in a Stack project, assuming there is one?

 Hi everyone,
 Today I finally decided to not just watch videos about Haskell but giving it a quick try to see how it works and feels.
 Since I just wanted to get a feel, I didn't want to start installing everything (especially because it was more than one step like downloading one file and installing it, lazy here) so I just went for the many Haskell browser consoles (replit for example) and I just couldn't do anything that I see in the many YouTube tutorials because of this "main =" thingy. I then tried with a "main = do" and writing under it but nothing works as in the tutorial, example "sumOfNums = [1..1000]" among many others.
 What can I do if I want to just play around, test basic functions etc in a browser ? It seems that I am supposed to already know some level of coding architecture and in every basic tutorial I watched there isn't any mention of such main = ...
 It's puzzling me how incredibly complicated this simple beginner step seems to be when comparing to, say, groovy web console, in which you can just type things, functions, classes etc...
 Thanks guys !

 Is there any way to list the nearest header above a TODO item in agenda view, in addition to the file name? I’m thinking of those cases where a file may have several projects broken out under different headers like this:

 It’d be great if agenda showed:

 Instead of just:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The transient package has a macro transient-define-prefix (docs). The following defines a complete prefix:
 (setq l1 '(("vl" "visual lines" visual-line-mode))) (transient-define-prefix foo1 () "docstring" [:pad-keys t ["Appearance" l1]]) 
 (The macro allows for a list of "elements" like l1 to be interpolated, something like a ,@ splice in a backtick context.)
 But having the variable l1 lying around feels like a loose end. The following approach looks better:
 (let ((l2 '(("vl" "visual lines" visual-line-mode)))) (transient-define-prefix foo2 () "docstring" [:pad-keys t ["Appearance" l2]])) 
 But it fails with "Symbol’s value as variable is void: l2"
 My understanding of elisp scope is clearly lacking.
 Is the problem that the transient-define-prefix macro is expanded within the let scope but the result is not evaluated until after the let scope is discarded? The elisp documentation for macros says that "[t]he Lisp interpreter proceeds to evaluate the expansion as soon as it comes back from the macro" but I may be misunderstanding this.

 cyclicIndex :: [a] -> Int -> a -- cyclicIndex is total in its second argument -- provided its first argument is total and not infinite cyclicIndex xs i = xs !! (i mod N) where N = length xs i mod N = unique representative of NZ+i in [0..N) 
 My attempt is
 cyclicIndex :: [a] -> Int -> a cyclicIndex xs i = if i >= 0 then (cycle xs) !! i else (cycle (reverse xs)) !! (-1-i) 
 This seems to work, and the function is a simple enough function, but I am having trouble reasoning about its correctness from my specification. My attempts at calculating its correctness runs into confusion about mod in Haskell and mod in maths. In particular, I noted down the laws
  
cycle xs !! i = xs !! (mod n i) for i >= 0 (note the mod is Haskell's mod)
 reverse xs !! i = xs !! (N - 1 - i) for i in [0..N)
 cycle . reverse = reverse . cycle? (A free theorem? Useful?)
  
How might we approach this correctness problem?

 My config files are all in ~/.config/emacs/, but just after the launch of the container (distrobox-enter), emacs creates ~/.emacs and ~/.emacs.d and ignores the config folder.
 If I stop emacs, delete ~/.emacs and ~/.emacs.d and restart emacs, my init.el in ~/.config/emacs/ is considered and emacs starts configured the proper way.
 For now I think I will just move my config folder, but if you think this is an issue I might need to report on the mailing list, or if you can help me investigate a bit more, feel free to help me!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have the following in my ~/.emacs.d/init.el:
 (setq nov-unzip-program (executable-find "/usr/local/bin/bsdtar")
 nov-unzip-args '("-xC" directory "-f" filename))
 (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.epub\\'" . nov-mode))
 If I use C-X C-f to open an epub file I am faced with a blank screen with an error message at the bottom: "wrong type argument: stringp, nil". I then have to do C-x b and select the buffer with the epub file.
 I am using emacs-28.2 on OpenBSD and should point out that I do not know lisp ( altho I have purchased a copy of Robert Chassell's book and intend to learn).
 Any assistance is appreciated.
 Thanks

 any time i evaluate the code block passing variable b into function (it's external file's table) it puts that external file top into buffer-flip (as if i just switched from that external file).
 example say i flip between buffer1 (where above code block is) and buffer 2 (buffer1 > buffer2 > buffer 1 > buffer 2, etc), but when i evaluate the code buffer flip becomes (buffer 1 > external file > buffer 1 > eternal file)
 if i evalute the code passing variable a into function (local table) - buffer flip works correctly.
 I am not sure that's buffer flip's package problem that's why i am asking here first - maybe i am missing some emacs / org-mode setting?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's been about 20 years since I used Windows, but I just started in a new position where I need to get up and running with it. I've got a lot of my config working already, but I don't get how to do external package-management at all. My config is littered with :ensure-system-package statements that all fail. I've installed Debian subsystem and also mingw, but I don't get how I can tie either of them in. I have found a few blog-posts about Emacs on Windows, but those were more about trivial things that I were able to figure out on my own.
 So. 1) Does the concept of PATH exist on Windows? \ 1.1) Can the PATH be changed to include something either from mingw or Debian subsystem?
 Looks like starting up the subsystem takes some time, so I'm also worried about performance. \ 2) Should I be going about this in another way entirely?

I was having a conversation one day and I couldn’t recall the name of a term, something I learned from a YouTube video. That bothered me. After the chat I went back to YouTube, found the video, and started searching through it. I increased the playback speed and went back and forth but still couldn’t find it. After a few minutes of that struggle, I thought: “what the heck am I doing?”. Then I wrote a tiny elisp function to extract subtitles. While reading through the subs I realized how much good stuff went past my ears (while watching the video).
  
It's tiny and very simple, but I think can be used already.

Although this is enough to do basic editing, I would like to learn emacs "the emacs way", as I'm not a vimmer. I'm just using doom emacs as a crutch while I get comfortable with emacs and lisp.
 ​
 Anyway, I've tried the following:
 comment out (evil +everywhere) with two semi colons in "~/.doom.d/init.el"
 ran doom sync
 added (package! evil-mode :disable t) to "packages.el"
 ran doom purge
 ran doom sync
 deleted (evil +everywhere) from "init.el" completely
 ran doom purge
 ran doom sync
 removed +bindings from :config default in "init.el"
 ran doom purge
 ran doom sync
 ​
 I'm not sure what else I should try.
 ​
 EDIT: rebooted my machine and evil is no more. Not sure at which point I could/should have rebooted but here we are.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm in the process of trying to set up emacs to be comfortable enough to replace vim as my daily driver, but one issue I have that I cannot figure out how to change is the indentation of wrapped lines in visual line mode.
 In vim, I currently have it set up so that when a line soft wraps, it will be indented by one tab width compared to the first line, as seen here: https://imgur.com/X6GTuaL
 In emacs, I have visual-line-mode and org-indent-mode enabled, which makes the soft wrapped lines flush with the first line (seen here: https://imgur.com/4xfBZnJ). I searched through google and any settings I could think of, but cannot find a way to indent the wrapped lines in emacs the same was as it is in vim.
 Is there a setting I'm missing, or a package that will do this for me? If not, is this something that could be done in lisp?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've encountered a design issue several times, and I'm wondering what approach is most consistent with Haskell idioms/best practices.
 I'm implementing a data structure, call it Z a, with an interface for manipulating it where almost all of the functions in the interface return a Z a, with many of the form Z a -> Z a or b -> Z a -> Z a. But for a few of the functions there's no valid result for some edge case inputs, and it makes sense in those situations to return Maybe (Z a). 
 Now at that point, it makes sense to have every function in the interface return Maybe (Z a) because I can then sequence my operations nicely with >>= 
 z :: Z a z >>= op1 >>= op2 >>= (op3 x) >>= (op4 1 2) 
 or something like
 pipe :: (Foldable t, Monad m) => a -> t (a -> m a) -> m a pipe = foldM (&) z :: Z a pipe z [op1, op2, op3 x, op4 1 2] 
 This is pretty convenient, I suppose, but then just one or two operations that have a Maybe result changed the entire interface to the data structure. An alternative would be to make the data structure itself an instance of Monad and make everything again -> Z a. There are several advantages of internalizing, e.g., I can carry some extra information in the Nothing case or even have several failure paths; and several disadvantages -- the non maybe'd functions now have to do the boilerplate to check for the Nothing-ish inputs and pass them along for every function, whereas Maybe does that automatically.
 My question is what are the Haskell best practices/idioms for this decision. Where is the boundary for the choice between internalizing the Monad instance in the data structure type itself and just using something like Maybe for *all* the functions in the interface. 
 I hope my question is clear. Thanks for your help.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone!
 Lately, I've been defining my own regular expressions for parsing errors in the *compilation* buffers by adding entries to the compilation-error-regexp-alist and compilation-error-regexp-alist-alist variables. However, there's a problem. This list already contains an enormous amount of regular expressions for all kinds of languages that I don't use, however, these regular expressions also match errors of the language that I'm trying to add support to, and this results in extracting incorrect paths to files containing errors. I've set compilation-error-regexp-alist to nil and the problem disappeared, but now when I byte-compile elisp files, I get no way to jump to problems from the compilation buffer (well, duh, the regexp list now doesn't contain an entry for elisp).
 So this creates a problem. I want my regular expressions to be the only ones present in the list when I'm working on a project in this language, and I want other regexps to be available when I'm working on other projects. I've thought about using dir-locals.el but my regexps use functions to get the file out of the error message, and I can't put that into dir-locals reliably.
 Another problem is that the compilation-error-regexp-alist contains names of the languages it supports, but for example, there's no elisp or emacs-lisp entry, yet the byte-compile warnings are highlighted correctly. And there's no way to see what regular expressions are responsible for the matches in the compilation buffer, so it's hard to debug what's overriding mine.
 TL;DR: Ideally, I want compilation-error-regexp-alist to be configurable per project but I use custom functions that can break other people's configurations who work on the same project as me and load dir-locals.el
