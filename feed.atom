        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently came across lsp-java and I wanted to give it a try. I was able to install it with no issues and I'm able to add projects to the workspace.
 I'm coming across an issue where the LSP server isn't able to find methods from other classes within my projects. Flycheck shows many errors such as:
  
The method <methodname> is undefined for the the type <type> log cannot be resolved
  
When I open my projects in VS Code, these errors do not show up. For further context, this is a Spring Boot project that uses Maven. I'm also able to build this project from the shell with no issues. Trying to build through lsp-java fails because of the errors it is seeing.
 I've tried the following in trying to resolve this:
  
Tried using OpenJDK 11, 15 and 17
 I made sure that the JAVA_HOME path and the /usr/bin/java symlink are pointing to the same version of the JDK (I tried this with the three version of the JDK I have installed on my system)
 Made sure I deleted the ~/.emacs.d/workspace directory when changing the JDK configuration to ensure I'm working off a fresh configuration
  
I'm not sure what else to try. I'm hoping to get some guidance on what else I can try. I'm confused why I'm not seeing these errors in VS Code which as far as I know, they use the same backend - I'm using the Red Hat extension which also uses Eclipse JDT.
 Has anyone else come across something like this before? Thanks for any help!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Trying to solve this problem in Haskell.
 A function takes a list of formulae, and from this list, will return a list of the largest sublists that are logically satisfiable. 
 I've already written the function to check if a formula is logically satisfiable, isSatisfiable:
 type Element = (Char, Bool)
 type Variable = [Element]
 models :: Expression -> [Variable]
 models form = filter satisfies (valuations (variables form))
 where satisfies val = eval val form
 isSatisfiable:: [Expression] -> Bool
 isSatisfiable[] = True
 isSatisfiable = (not . null . models . foldl1 And) es
 Now I want to write a similar function that would take in a list of formulae and return the sublists based off the criteria mentioned above. I think I know how I would go about doing this; I would split the formulae given into sublists and check which ones are satisfiable (by calling the isSatisfiable function) and return those ones. However, as I'm new to Haskell I'm not sure how I would go about implementing this. Can someone help please?
 satisfiableSubsets:: [Expression] -> [[Expression]]

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all
 I'm toying with using project.el in place of projectile, since I barely use any of projectile's features other than switching between known projects.
 One thing I'm struggling with is the workflow element. Along with projectile I have perspective and persp-projectile, and I have bound p in the projectile-command-map to projectile-persp-switch-project which gives a great experience when flipping back and forth between related code repositories, something I have to do often.
 Unfortunately I can't seem to replicate this great experience. I briefly tried using persp-mode with persp-mode-project-bridge but there doesn't seem to be an analogue for projectile-persp-switch-project.
 What this means is that using Projectile I can have a 2-window split in one "project" and 6 in the other, and flipping between them is nice and smooth. Whereas in Project each time I switch the flow is broken, since the default action is to present a menu and maybe open a single file.
 I'd love to hear from people who maybe use Project+<something> and have a similar workflow/experience to what I'm aiming for.
 If it helps, my config is based on vertico+consult+embark.
 As always, thanks in advance for your suggestions/support!

 This is for a panic disorder app I've been wanting to make for some time, I've suffer/ed from them. The apps out there aren't that good and the industry standard is to have the app live behind a high monthly fee paywall which I disagree with.
 I'm going to build my backend in Haskell but rather than using something like React-Native I wondered if I could also do the mobile app in Haskell. Ideally I'd want access to native functions like taking pictures, bionic neural engine etc.
 From researching seems like Obelisk might be the right tool for this, but wanted to know if others had built mobile apps in Haskell and their experience/advice if this is a good root to take?
 Also been looking at Rust (trying to keep things FP 😅) but due to not knowing the language, I'm unsure if it's worth learning! Feels like I've been stuck on making these choices and never get started, so trying to break that today!!

 I haven't really dug into it yet, but is it possible to take an org file.. take a series of 1st level or 2nd level headlines and generate .md (or .org) files based on its content?
 i.e. in somecollection.org
 * item1 # updated sometimes yesterday sometext ** item1 subheading somemore text * item2 something about item2 
 Then take that, and make item1.md, item2.md with the contents of item1.md looking like:
 # item1 Some text ## item1 subheading somemore text 
 and item2.md:
 # item2 something about item2 
 My premise: I want to maintain some collection of data in a single file and publish it into another format for sharing/distribution. With comment blocks ignored and not shared.
 It doesn't have to be exactly like I described, if there's a reliable package that does something like this already.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Moving to Emacs 28.1 on Windows (from 26 or 27) introduces a strange behaviour on my laptop but not desktop. The setup is the same on both. Identical .emacs files used, same emacs theme.
 On the laptop, the first time I find an .org file in an emacs session, it does not format it as an org (heading colours, size etc. not correct). I can work around by either killing the buffer and finding the file again. Or by M-x org-mode. From then on in a given session, any .org file I find, opens correctly.
 I don't have this on my desktop - just works first time.
 Any ideas or file a bug?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Currently I am using a consult-ripgrep wrapper that inserts some sensible defaults options so my initial input looks like this:
 #█ -- -g *.md -g !test/** --no-hidden --no-follow -U --sort path #
 When I need to add another option, like:
 #def -- -█ -g *.md -g !test/** --no-hidden --no-follow -U --sort path #
 For a long one as --ignore-file-case-insensitive, having shell-like TAB completion definitely makes typing it more bearable, like what https://github.com/szermatt/emacs-bash-completion provides in the screenshot for shell-command prompt.

 Searching suggested me https://github.com/JonWaltman/pcmpl-args.el, but after looking at the README, I still don't get how to use it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am very excited about the new JS (and WASM) backends for GHC (see https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/zlrk40/javascript_backend_merged_into_ghc_iog_engineering/) and today immediately made a quick test using two little programs from the Computer Language Benchmarksgame.
 The first was the pi digits exercise. And I was very excited that GHC immediately compiled the code without any problems and the program ran for the first 1000 digits in 10.36 sec. Although it is currently completely unfair to compare this with other implementations since the JS back-end is not optimised in any way it is nonetheless not completely uninteresting and the result was 0.081 sec for the hand-written JS code with node. That's a factor of 128 faster.
 The second program had to create a 1024 pixel wide Mandelbrot bitmap and compiled and worked equally well. It took 77 sec compared with 0.74 sec for the node version which is about 104 times faster.
 Although the numbers might seem far away from a decent performance I am still very excited about the seamless experience and intend to explore this further for future work. Congratulations to the dev team!!!
 There is indeed an optimisation flag -O here as well and when activated the code runs about ten times as fast compared to the above. Therefore the difference to hand-written JS code shrinks considerably.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I use The Archive. Occasionally, I find notes that are no longer needed, and I move them from The Archive into a "cold storage" folder. This could potentially leave "dangling links" around. At other times, I want to link to a source file on my hard drive, but rather than using an inline file:/// link, which is prone to breaking, I just drop another zettel link inline (eg see the source file [[202212152155]] on my hard drive).
Naturally, when running across these links, clicking on them in The Archive gives no results, and leads to nowhere. This requires me to then copy the zettel id out, and paste it into a file-system-wide search. Ideally, this would be a smoother process.
I'm interested in any suggestions for making this process smoother.
I notice there's a contextual menu in The Archive, when clicking on these links. Perhaps I could create a system service that would show up here? Perhaps there's some other way to automate a fallback search.
Any ideas are appreciated.]]></summary>

I have elpy set up, and have managed to get that working. The only issue left is I have no idea how to wrap my head around pyvenv, which came included. Trying pyvenv-workon prompts me to set WORKON_HOME, which I'm unsure about since I run Windows 10, and when I try to activate venvs I've already made and have stored on my computer it doesn't seem to work. Any advice on how I can use pyvenv effectively and program with Python well in Emacs, or any good documentation sources on what exactly is going on? I've tried reading the manuals, couldn't really make heads or tails of the virtual environments content.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[(EDIT) Answer for future generations:
 "ln -s emacs-setup .emacs.d" is the command, but make sure .emacs.d doesn't exit when you do it.
 ------
 TL;DR: ln -s emacs-setup .emacs.d creates an .emacs.d dir with a link underneath to emacs-setup, where emacs-setup is the repo name.
 Emacs-setup is my github (on my other box it lives in my emacs.d). So this second machine is the first time I'm dealing with pulling it down. Conventional wisdom is "just sym link .emacs.d to your repo" -- but no snippets I find work to do that. (On WSL2 ubuntu just installed).
 I'd settle for pulling my repo contents straight to .emacs.d (how its setup on my other machine) -- but sym link should be pretty easy.
 I'm hoping it's a dumb mistake and not an issue with wsl2.
 ​
 Thanks for any help or snippets to cut/paste and then I'll give results.

 I had to blur the recipient list out, but that is what is bugging me: GNUS apparently applies some kind of hard wrap on the recipient list which makes it look jumbled and confusing and take up unnecessary vertical screen space. 
 Is there a way to make it just soft-wrap the recipient list like a single long line so it doesn't introduce random line breaks and indents, and so it uses the screen space more economically?

 data Tree a = Leaf a | Node a (Tree a) (Tree a) sumLeaves :: Tree a -> Integer sumLeaves (Leaf x) = 1 sumLeaves (Node _ lt rt) = sumLeaves lt + sumLeaves rt sumNodes :: Tree a -> Integer sumNodes (Leaf x) = 0 sumNodes (Node _ lt rt) = 1 + sumNodes lt + sumNodes rt 
 Now I want to prove with Structural induction that for all finite trees t :: Tree a holds:
 sumLeaves t = sumNodes t + 1
 I now have:
 sumLeaves t = sumNodes t + 1 I.A.: t = (Tree 0) = (Leaf 0) sumLeaves (Leaf 0) = 1 sumNodes (Leaf 0) + 1 0 + 1 = 1 1 = 1 I.V.: We assume that the statement holds for an arbitrary t. 
 I.S.:
 Now what is the induction step, I really have problems with solving this last step.

Better ui and customization, more information than register method.
 Vim-like mark and jump style.
 Integration with buffers recently used.
 Margin indicator support
  
The emacs version which this package supports is >=26.3 . And only rely on cl-lib. The package is under check in Melpa right now, so maybe you need to install it from github . 
 Since I use it for a quite few time and satisfied with it now. I hope if anybody would find it useful and give some advices.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I edit typescript files with eglot active, it resets indent-tabs-mode and inserts tabs. I can toggle indent-tabs-mode to go back to spaces, but I'd like to leave it set the way I like. I'm trying to follow the instructions for eglot-workspace-configuration in the eglot manual, but it's not working.
 I've tried creating a .dir.local.el file to set preferences for "typescript-language-server" (see below), but eglot-show-workspace-configuration shows nil, so I don't think these are being found.
 The kap/eglot-current-server command I've written (see below) confirms that I'm running "(typescript-language-server --stdio)".
 (use-package eglot :hook ((js-ts-mode . eglot-ensure) (tsx-ts-mode . eglot-ensure) (typescript-ts-mode . eglot-ensure)) :custom (eglot-stay-out-of indent-tabs-mode) ;; (This didn't work) :bind (:map eglot-mode-map)) (defun kap/eglot-current-server () (interactive) (message "%s" (process-command (jsonrpc--process (eglot-current-server))))) 
 And .dir.local.el looks like this:
 ((nil . ((eglot-workspace-configuration . (:typescript-language-server (:typescript.format.convertTabsToSpaces nil) (:javascript.format.convertTabsToSpaces nil)))))) 
 The root problem is the insistence of eglot and/or the lsp server on tabs rather than spaces.
 But the bigger issue I'd like is how to get configuration into the lsp server. Has anyone got .dir.local.el configuration to work for the "typescript-language-server"?

 I am learning algebraic-data-types in Haskell, and I ran into a problem I cannot solve.

 data Item = A | B | C deriving (Eq, Show) data List = Empty | Add Item List 
 ​
 and I have the groceries list:
 list1 = A `Add` (B `Add` Empty) 
 ​
 I have a function (That sets the prices of the items):
 p:: Item -> Int p A = 2 p B = 4 p C = 5 
 ​
 And now here is where I have a difficulty.
 I want to apply the function "p" to my list1. But I am not sure how.
 ​
 Here is my current code:
 price:: (Item -> Int) -> List a -> Int price p (Add x xs) | x == A = A + price xs | x == B = B + price xs | x == C = C + price xs | otherwise = 0 
 I also tried this.
 price:: (Item -> Int) -> List a -> Int price p (Add x xs) = x + price xs

 I'm trying to implement preOrder (First, the root is considered, then recursively the left and then the right subtree) and levelOrder (The nodes are viewed in ascending depth from left to right.)
 I have:

 preOrder :: BTree a -> [a]
 preOrder Nil = []
 preOrder (Node x lt rt) = x: ((preOrder lt) ++ (preOrder rt ))
 it seems to work, but I'm struggeling with the levelOrder function, I just have:
 levelOrder :: BTree a -> [a]
 levelOrder Nil = []
 levelOrder (Node x lt rt) =
 I dont know what to do next to make it work.

 Error (use-package): Cannot load helm-config
 And in the top of the *Messages* buffer I see:
 Error loading autoloads: (void-function helm-make-source)
 I see in the helm GitHub repo history that helm-config has been removed (like 3 days ago). What is the correct way to install and configure helm now, using use-package? Below is my config for helm:
 (use-package helm :ensure t :bind (("M-x" . helm-M-x) ("C-x C-f" . helm-find-files) ("C-x C-b" . helm-buffers-list) ("M-s o" . helm-occur) ("M-s i" . helm-imenu) ("M-s I" . helm-imenu-in-all-buffers) ("M-s m" . helm-mini) ("M-s b" . helm-bookmarks)) :config (use-package helm-config) (setq helm-split-window-inside-p t) (setq helm-use-frame-when-more-than-two-windows nil) (setq imenu-max-item-length 120) (setq helm-buffer-max-length nil) (helm-mode 1) (helm-autoresize-mode 1)) 
 If I remove the (use-package helm-config) part the warning disappears but the error in the *Messages* buffer remains, all seems to work though.
 In the commit removing helm-config it is replaced with helm-autoloads. Should I replace helm-config with helm-autoloads in my use-package statement? I tried, and it seems to work equally bad or well with the error still in the top of the *Messages* buffer.

 ~ $ history 1 pwd 2 ls -l 3 date 4 history ~ $ !! !!: command not found ~ $ !2 !2: command not found 
 That was run on an eshell session, emacs 28.1 (built myself from source with default options) started with --no-init-file option.
 There's something I'm doing wrong ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is not exactly about Zettelkasten and knowledge work. But since music is part of the work environment, this might be interesting to you. This is a note that I took yesterday (translated by DeepL):

  
Good music is made to give us strength. Old war music, a lot of video game music, some movie music.
Other music is made for us to give it power. Pop music is made to be about itself. It's all about itself. It wants us to focus our attention on it.
Listen to good music!
Music is part of the cultural environment of us humans. It is the most primal form of cultural transmission of meaning. It is (without singing) meaning in its purest form: Harmony through form in form in form.


I have no study to provide evidence for my thesis. However, my n=1 is very positive. I, personally, like to listen to traditional war music. Now, that I started my cold adaptation (cold shower + shiver walks aftwards (walking in cold with few clothes on)) I feel like nordic war music is appropriate.
But gaming music is my personal favorite. For people, that don't like to listen to music at all: Ambience sounds like campfire sounds, thunder and rain etc. are also power giving.
I like this more than binaural sounds. And my old Celtic/Germanic/Rus genes seem to like it, too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am a big fan of alpahapapa's org-super-agenda for my GTD dashboard (tho need to update it for org-ql). However, I have this weird thing that happens with my config that I've been unable to figure out: 
 It will only ever trigger once - switching to any query or custom view and then trying to get the org-super-agenda view back gives me the default org-agenda view. I actually have to exit emacs and relaunch in order to get the org-super-agenda view back. This has recently become more problematic since I'm using org-agenda-custom-commands for a Resonance Cal, Blog Queue, and Experiments list.
 Can anyone think of a reason that would occur or what I may have done wrong in my config below? 
 elisp (use-package org-super-agenda :straight t :after org :defer t :config (let ((org-agenda-custom-commands '(("u" "Super view" ((agenda "" ( (org-agenda-span 1) (org-super-agenda-groups '( (:name "Today" :tag ("bday" "ann" "hols" "cal" "today") :time-grid t :todo ("WIP") :deadline today :scheduled today) (:name "Overdue" :deadline past) (:name "Reschedule" :scheduled past) (:name "Perso" :tag "perso") (:name "Due Soon" :deadline future :scheduled future ) )))) (tags (concat "w" (format-time-string "%V")) ((org-agenda-overriding-header (concat "--\nToDos Week " (format-time-string "%V"))) (org-super-agenda-groups '((:discard (:deadline t)) (:discard (:scheduled t)) (:discard (:todo ("DONE"))) (:name "Ticklers" :tag "someday") (:name "Perso" :and (:tag "perso" :not (:tag "someday"))) (:name "UH" :and (:tag "uh" :not (:tag "someday"))) ;; (:name "Neo" ;; :and (:tag "neo" :not (:tag "someday"))) (:name "Ping" :tag "crm") )))) ))))) (org-agenda nil "u")) ) 
 If you're interested in how this helps me GTD and keep in touch with folks an old post (which desperately needs revistsing and re-writing now I use org-roam and have dropped some of the libraries mentioned) is here:

It seems that org would think my data is of INT type and lose the leading zeros, but in fact it is of TEXT type. How do I make org treat my data as TEXT instead of number? I cannot simply add leading zeros after processing, as the number of zeros is uncertain.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi guys! I want to use different input methods for different evil modes in emacs. To be more specific, I use colemak for English input (and basically everything else inside emacs), but qwerty for Chinese input. 
 As I've been exploring, I found several possible ways of implementing this: letting fcitx handle the input methods and interface with it using `fcitx.el`, or let emacs handle everything and use `pyim` for Chinese input. 
 I feel like both methods are bad. For fcitx, I'm not sure if the package could change fcitx state as buffers, major/minor modes change. Even it is possible, I suspect that it will be a huge hacking work (I'm a noob with elisp). For the native input methods, I'm not sure how to make the system input methods ignore emacs. Also, letting emacs handle its own inputs seems... inelegant.
 Do you have any good solutions for inputting Chinese in emacs, with colemak as the default English input? Any help would be appreciated!

to build projects. Reading documentation and playing around with codelab
exercises is a great way to get started, but when learning a new
technology there comes a point where you have to start applying it for real to
make further progress. To this end I decided to migrate an old hobby project of
mine to use Bazel. This post describes my experience and I hope serves as a
useful example for others.
Bazel is a fantastic build system which by itself provides many
benefits. However dependency management could be
considered an area of weakness for it. This is understandable given its
monorepo origins at Google but when not working in a monorepo, what
is the best way to provide the dependencies a project needs?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently I've been developing a package for my own use to give suggestions while typing. While there are packages that do this, I couldn't find any that were aimed at my use case exactly.
 That is, to suggest something useful while typing based on the current context.
 At the moment I have this setup so there are multiple back-ends which can be enabled at once based on the current context, this way I can have different suggestions based on what I'm working on so:
  
When typing in code, suggest using code completion or dabbrev.
 When typing in comments, suggest using statistical word prediction, falling back to dabbrev.
  
I've been interested in how good word prediction can be, at the moment I'm using N-gram's generated by code-comments of the project I'm working on as input as well as every commit message, the user-manual and some NLTK texts as well. So far it's quite nice but doesn't feel like a game-changer and might need some tweaking to improve it's behavior.
 While I'm aware other auto-completion frameworks might support this functionality, I find it useful to separate blocking completion from this kind of suggestion generation.
 Is anyone doing something similar in Emacs already, any comments?
  
This is the repository if anyone is interested although this isn't yet documented and internals may change.

This prevents laziness as you need pattern match on this to use it and doing so will force evaluation on whether or not the parse resulted in an error.
 Are there any parser combinators that are lazy instead, letting you use partial parses and using imprecise exceptions for parser errors?
 Here's some (old) code where I play around with this:
 {-# LANGUAGE DeriveFunctor #-} {-# LANGUAGE LambdaCase #-} module Parse where import Control.Applicative import Control.Monad import Data.Char data Status = Empty | Pure | Parse deriving (Show) data Result a = Parsed { value :: a, remaining :: String, status :: Status } deriving (Functor, Show) newtype Parser a = Parser {runParser :: String -> Result a} deriving (Functor) instance Applicative Parser where pure = return (<*>) = ap instance Monad Parser where return x = Parser $ \str -> Parsed x str Pure Parser p >>= f = Parser $ \str -> case p str of Parsed a str Pure -> runParser (f a) str Parsed _ str Empty -> Parsed (error "parse error") str Empty Parsed a str Parse -> case runParser (f a) str of ~(Parsed b str _) -> Parsed b str Parse instance Alternative Parser where empty = Parser $ \str -> Parsed (error "parse error") str Empty Parser p <|> Parser q = Parser $ \str -> case p str of Parsed _ _ Empty -> q str result -> result satify :: (Char -> Bool) -> Parser Char satify f = Parser $ \case c : s | f c -> Parsed c s Parse str -> Parsed (error "parse error") str Empty number :: Parser Char number = satify isDigit test :: Char test = head $ value $ runParser (many number) ('1' : '2' : '3' : undefined)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The great goodness of Emacs has tainted how I feel about my shell. I use Vertico+Marginalia+Consult+Orderless, and life feels awesome inside of Emacs. I go back to my pretty vanilla zsh shell and feel that it's a little… lacking.
 I understand zsh's completion system is quite configurable. I'd love it if I could make completion inside of zsh feel more like how it behaves in Emacs. In particular:
  
When I hit tab to complete something, I want to be able to hit the down key to start cycling through the candidates.
 When I find the candidate I want, tab should fill it in instead of moving to the next candidate.
 If I'm completing a path, after hitting tab whilst completing a directory, I should immediately see the contents of that directory, which I can then pick the file I want and hit tab again.
 Fuzzy completion ala Orderless would be awesome: hitting space during completion acts as a pattern separator.
  
Does anyone have enough zsh-fu to know how to get something like what I described in the shell? I would prefer to do everything with configuration (i.e. no packages) but that's secondary to getting the behavior that I want.
 Thanks in advance. :)

 During Haskell eXchange Novice Track I did a talk about Semigroup, Monoid, Foldable and Traversable. This talk is for beginners that are familiar with basic Haskell syntax. Enjoy :)
 —
 "In this session you will learn about three heroes: Monoid (and its side-kick Semigroup), Foldable and Traversable. Three amazing type-classes, each providing a set of astonishing powers, making your daily programming routines easy as pie.
 During the talk we will encounter numerous villains (a.k.a programming riddles). Though the baddies look tough at the first glance, we will quickly learn that with the help of our protagonists, defeating those villains is a child's play. Are you ready to meet our heroes and master their powers?
 The talk is appropriate for Haskell beginners. We assume familiarity with basic Haskell syntax (functions, data types, typeclasses)."

 Over the last month or so, I've started publishing them to Maven Central to make them more accessible to others, especially now scala-cli supports Scala.js very well. 
 0.3-M4 is on Maven Central now.
 Veautiful is a Scala.js front end I wrote originally in 2017 and have used for writing interactive learning materials since then. 
 Doctacular is a simple set of classes (e.g. router and handling for basic content types, site layout, and table of contents) that make it easy for me to write interactive learning materials. Doctactular is ironically under-documented, but these are some of the sites built with it (albeit several of these are still running on the previous version):
  
Thinking about Programming, a CS0-style resource with programmable games (turtle, lava maze, rescue line, microrat, lunar lander)
 Circuits Up, mostly interactive visualisations of simple circuitry and digital logic
 The Adventures of Will Scala, my Scala course
 Supercollaborative, essentially, second year undergrad software engineering
 My ASCILITE 2022 talk on lightweight course mapping 
  
0.3-M5 will follow soon. (As will another of these posts announcing it.) 0.3-M5 will focus on improving the docs for Doctacular.

 It's completely unusable to the point where I'm just giving up on lsp in vue for now so I can get some work done.
 LSP mode is fine otherwise in plain typescript files.
 Has anyone had the same experience? Not looking for solutions neccassirily, just wondering if it's worth it for me to debug further, whether it's even possible to have a pleasant experience with volar right now.

 You can read more about virtual formatting on the site of XMLQuire.
 Virtual formatting isn't that the editor parses the code and formats it by inserting whitespace; the text is not modified, it's just laid out on the screen to reflect its structure.
 How could that be achieved in Emacs? I didn't find any editor capable of that for multiple languages, and Emacs has surprised me multiple times with what is possible in it, so I have hope that it is possible in Emacs.

I found this for Scala 3: https://www.scala-lang.org/blog/2022/08/17/long-term-compatibility-plans.html and it's very helpful. Is there anything similar for 2.12/2.13? 
 A few things I'm trying to understand:
  
It seems 2.12 and 2.13 are being supported concurrently. What is the reason for this? Is there any public guidance for how long 2.12 or 2.13 will be supported? 
 Generally speaking, can a Scala 2.12 project be compiled to Scala 2.13?
 Given the latest release is now 3.2, is support for 2.13 worthwhile? (Subjective I know but curious what the community's sentiment is regarding 2.13).
  
Any additional thoughts that might be helpful for someone in my position and new to the Scala ecosystem would be greatly appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My question:
 I want to separate my code logic from Scala Future. After searching and reading some articles, I'm not sure what's recommendation to achieve this?
 Background:
 I have a project where it heavily depends on Future for operations. I have no problem with that. However, when writing the code, I want to be able to, for instance, test my logic instead of testing against Future. Also I know there exist libraries like ZIO, cats-effects, Monix, and Fs2. I may use it in the future. Before that happens, I don't want to choose one or the others too early. Then I found some articles talking about tagless final; but there are also some caveats regarding to applying tagless final such as complexity.
 ​
 Any advice that I can apply for decoupling my code's business logic from Future in a simpler way? Would simply provide a thunk (method or function) do the trick? For example, `Future { myFunc() }` - but with this it looks like the next step or function that handles this still couples with Future object. I appreciate any advice. Many thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I'm new in FS2, and looks like I need some help by getting some entry points or tips on how to implement it by using FS2 next system with the next sub-systems:
 subsystem A: (many instances) just some constant network consumer (one to each peer) with some logic, the result shall be put into some shared storage; also, that subsystem shall send information about of "quality" of consumed data to subsystem C.
 subsystem B: (one instance), consume data from subsystems A send consumed and transformed data to some external subsystem, send information about of "quality" of consumed data to subsystem C
 subsystem C: (one instance) open/close network connection, based on data "quality" information received from A/B.
 ​
 I easily understand how to implement a such system by using Akka actors/messages (every subsystem is just an actor with appropriate messages). But How it could be implemented on FS2? Making every subsystem as a stream is fitting very well, but I'm stuck on how to make such interactions and communications between subsystems. Of course, I could "emulate" actors (for example https://www.signifytechnology.com/blog/2019/10/replacing-akka-actors-with-cats-effect-and-fs2-by-viktor-lovgren ). Or somehow use reactive streams for it. But maybe I just missing something and there is exist a convenient way to do it?

 The problem is as I make new strides on my home config I cannot easily mirror the setup at work. On top of that I am also working on going all-in on org mode across my devices. I can figure out the org file syncing with syncthing no problem but as I develop my org setup I don't want to be having disparate versions of my config. 
 Are there any guides or walkthroughs on this type of thing? I know I"ll probably need to figure several things out based on my specific setup but figure there might be something out there like resolving moving between the ~/ and C:/ locations and any other issues I might not realize I'd run into.

 The context is that most editors (including Emacs and vim) have issues when used on non-US keyboards, because stuff is in different places. Many people solve this problem by switching to a US keyboard (which has some other advantages), but I don't really like this solution.
 I can see some challenges for this, like the differences between 104 and 105 key layouts, etc. And this is more from a theoretical standpoint....

 I would like to share a subset of my org notes to co-workers by exporting them in html files that are linked together, with one entrypoint which is an org note that I manage to keep up to date with the project state. But I have hundreds of org notes, all in the same directory, so I can't juste use the org-publish :recursive t option.
 What I would like is an option to specify one (or many) org-files to be included and then that the export process follow all links inside the given files (currently org-roam links) and try to included those linked files too.
 Is something like this already exist ? (I've search but not found anything relevant to my need) And if not, what should be my firsts steps to make it work as I wish (I'm fairly new to org publish process).
 Thanks !

 Warning (initialization): An error occurred while loading ‘/Users/me/.emacs.d/init.el’: : Please save the current buffer to a file 
 And if I do a load-file manually then the same error occurs. But if I load the init.el into a buffer, do nothing else but load-file then it all works. As does eval-buffer and the other manual ways to run it. So load-file init.el nothing, C-x C-f init.el, load-file init.el works. It works both from ~/ and from /Users/... --debug-init does nothing, and my

 at the top doesn't get hit when it fails. This started when somehow my init.el seemed to be gone (no clue how) -- so I did a revert-file in the buffer to get a copy back (per the message, save the buffer). It's as if emacs is stuck in some state of not knowing the init.el file exists -- but that seems like nonsense.
 ​
 Thanks for any help or troubleshooting. The fact that the opening message and debug-init do nothing makes me think the file isn't even getting seen at startup.

 I personally run my own config and use traditional Emacs bindings. I'm familiar with Doom and Spacemacs, but I'm also wondering if I should just write him a simple conf that's pretty much just vanilla + evil + lsp-mode/eglot and maybe a theme. Are there any must have packages besides evil-mode to get him a familiar editing experience? Thanks!

 Tree sitter brings a whole new level of possibilities that I'd also like to get feedback on. For example, elements of an array could be right aligned. Enhanced Ruby mode currently implements two choices: ```ruby ENH_CONST1 = [ 12, 999, 13, 14, 15 ].freeze
 ENH_CONST2 = [12, 999, 13, 14, 15].freeze  Both of these are aligned along a left edge -- which is fine. But another choice that I've implemented just as a proof of concept is having these right aligned such as:  ruby RIGHT_ALIGNED_CONST1 = [ 12, 999, 13, 14, 15 ].freeze
 RIGHT_ALIGNED_CONST2 = [ 12, 999, 13, 14, 15].freeze ```

I want to share a method of searching for candidates to link ideas in a new note to established ideas that consistently produce high-quality results. This advanced search option is called proximity search. Usually, proximity search has to be implemented at the software level. My main goal is to share this idea with you.
I love making lists, so you'll have to suffer my indulgence.
Background
I use The Archive to host my ZK.
I have 3K+ zettel, but you'll find this tool of use if you have more than a couple hundred.
My notes are all plain text formatted with Markdown.
I use and recommend Keyboard Maestro integrated with python and zsh scripts.
There are other ways to accomplish the same outcomes using other macro and scripting tools.
I'm dividing this demo into three parts.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A goldsmith has chain links of gold, silver, and platinum and can form chains from them.
 The following holds for the chains:
 i) Each chain has a beginning (left side) and an end (right side).
 ii) An empty chain is a chain
 iii) The end of a chain ch1 can be connected to the beginning of a chain ch by a chain link 1.
 We have following data types:
 data Link = G | S | P deriving (Eq, Show)
 data Chain = Empty | Join Chain Link Chain
 Task: We want to implement a function list :: Chain -> [Link] to determine the material sequence from left to right.
 The test chain we created is: chain1 = (Join Empty G (Join Empty G (Join Empty P (Empty))))so the function should give [G,G,P] as a result, when the input is list chain1
 How should the list function look like? We have trouble creating one.
 Thank you very much!

Did you read the book and have a different structure?

Epstein positions his arguments to refute the a claim of the 10000-hour-rule camp of getting expertise: that more time and deliberate practice is all there is.

  (add-hook 'emacs-startup-hook (lambda () (kill-buffer "*scratch*") (split-window-below) (other-window) (ansi-term "/bin/bash") (other-window) )) 
 Which splits the window in half and nothing more. I'm guessing there is something I'm missing about the other-window because if I comment these 2 out, my final output is emacs opening with ansi-term at the top and main window at the bottom.
 TLDR: How do I configure emacs to have the main-window at the top and ansi-term "/bin/bash" at the bottom on start-up
 Edit: I'm getting this error in debug: Wrong number of arguments: (1 . 2), 0
 Fixed. Apparently other-window requires an argument.
  (add-hook 'emacs-startup-hook (lambda () (kill-buffer "*scratch*") (split-window-below) (other-window 1) ; Go to the new window (ansi-term "/bin/bash") (other-window 0) ; Back to main window ))

 Ok, that moves me to the end of the line, but it also highlights all the text I moved over.
 whereas M-x move-end-of-line just moves the cursor to the end of the line.
 I am a very emacs noob, so I apologize if I am asking my question improperly. I have looked at several websites to find what I could find but I just can't seem to make it work. 
 I have since removed the ~/.emacs file
 ​
 Here is a new bit of news - I just found out the problem is only under the GUI in a terminal (Qterminal in LXQT) The CLI (non-X) pseudo terminals don't have this issue.
 C-e and C-a actually work but on my other machines and in text-only mode (non-X) on this machine [home] and [end] serve to go to the beginning and end of the line I am on.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With their introduction in Nix 2.4, flakes are quickly becoming an integral part of the Nix ecosystem. For anyone unfamiliar, flakes exist to provide a standard format to package Nix-based projects.
To allow for better user experience and composability for existing flakes, discoverability of flakes is a necessary feature.
The site search.nixos.org is used to search for packages, options, and flakes. It also provides metadata information such as descriptions, maintainers, and compatible platforms.
Currently, search.nixos.org imports flake metadata through custom nix code that wraps flake evaluations. However, wrapping employs too much memory when used with large repositories such as nixpkgs. This causes a segmentation fault. As currently implemented, search.nixos.org cannot show all flakes.…]]></summary>

 I've been looking around and I can find a lot of documentation on how to get started with emacs. But I still don't understand, what actually is it?
 Vim can be described as a modal terminal text editor.
 But what is emacs?
 As far as I can tell it seems to be much more than just a text editor, right?
 Could you use it as a terminal text editor? Or do I have to use the GUI?
 Apart from editing text what else does it do?
 There seem to be a lot of things you can do with Emacs that you cant do with Vim.
 But is there anything you can do with Vim that you cant do with Emacs?
 For example the modal editing stuff?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I'm fairly new to Haskell and am struggling with how to ensure type safety of my domain model. I'm modelling "Weather Station", which currently looks as follows:
 ```haskell data MeasurementType = Rain | Humidity | Pressure | Temperature | WindStrength | WindAngle | GustStrength | GustAngle
 data Measurement = MeasuredRain (Meter :/ Hour) | MeasuredHumidity (Double) | MeasuredPressure (Pascal) | MeasuredTemperature (Kelvin) | MeasuredWindStrength (Meter :/ Hour) | MeasuredWindAngle (Degree) | MeasuredGustStrength (Meter :/ Hour) | MeasuredGustAngle (Degree) 
 data TimeSeries = TimeSeries { measuredProperty:: MeasurementType, values:: Map UTCTime Measurement }
 data Sensor a = Sensor { identifier :: a, supportedMeasurements :: [Core.MeasurementType] }
 -- each sensor supports different measurement types, ideally it should also be type checked type GetMeasurements a = Sensor a -> TimeRange -> NonEmpty MeasurementType -> IO [TimeSeries] ```
 What I would like to achieve is to ensure TimeSeries measuredProperty match Measurement type. That is, it shouldn't compile when one tries to create time serie of type Rain while putting e.g. MeasuredWindAngle inside.
 The measuredProperty is needed to group time series and e.g. compute an average from each serie type. That is, separate average for Humidity, Rain etc..
 Basically, each weather sensor will return many different measurements, where the measurements can be duplicated among different sensors. Therefore, I'd like to combine all measurements into a single list, group by type and then aggregate.
 Moreover, each sensor has a different set of supported measurements. Ideally, this should be reflected in the type system as well. That is, one shouldn't be able to ask for Pressure where the given sensor only supports [Temperature, Humidity].
 Anyone can give me any clues on how to achieve this?

 I'd say my trajectory of experiencing programming languages was pretty common for a regular CS undergrad. Started off with Java, everything was new, many things felt weird and difficult (because they are), but I accepted them blindly and was happy. Other lectures required me to code in Python, C and C++. The amount of work required for the lectures prevented me from diving deeper into any language than what was required, but they all seemed to be decent with their individual benefits and drawbacks.
 But then came Haskell, it felt like an enlightenment. The mathematical beauty, the expressive type system, the declarative, composable nature …]]></summary>

 Does Emacs have a way of enabling the user of a particular .emacs.d but allow the project or session settings to be separate? Creating doom profiles for each user account does get time consuming.
 I have been able to create some workarounds for such issues, such as this way of setting a separate custom.el file when I run a profile copied to different user accounts on different computers.
 (setq custom-file (format (expand-file-name "%s-%s-cukstom.el" user-emacs-directory) (getenv "USER") (getenv "HOST"))) 
 I have noticed that Emacs has a command-line option --user that allows the usage an .emacs.d belonging to another user which would help avoiding replicating .emacs.d for different user accounts and going through whole doom compilations, but I need something for the particular .emacs.d as well as the project.
 Is there some package that makes such things easier? I already user Chemacs2 to keep the .emacs.d options separate, but this needs to be on a project or directory basis, ie profile + project/working directory

 Macs represent 1/3 of development platforms and deployment targets for Haskellers, but I myself haven't used a Mac in about 15 years. I would like to know what it's like to work with Haskell on a Mac.
 I'd like to ask about one aspect of the experience in particular: getting set up. And the specific reason I'm asking about this is that notarizing GHC for Macs is currently on the to-do list.
 Notarization is part of Apple's fight against malware. Codesigning is another. I am still learning how they work and what the consequences are.
 Does the lack of a notarized installable affect you? (Example of missing notarization here.) If so, how? It helps to be specific: Did you get started with GHCUp? Stack? Something else?
 What other pain points exist when you (or your students/classmates/colleagues/bosses) get set up to work with Haskell? What's the biggest pain point?
 I'll have access to a Mac soon, but I don't want to base my effort on one data point. :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently switched my config over to the (very!) aesthetically pleasing and nicely usable emacs nano. Already using it as a daily driver and very happy with it UX-wise, though I still have a thing (and a reported bug) keeping it from being near-ideal.
 Math-preview (using the new one with MathJax3), which I rely on heavily on latex when taking notes for astrophysics formulas and, well... math. ¯\(ツ)/¯ Math-preview just gives a blank little box (smaller than formula's expansion) where the formulas should go despite the fact I have it triggered on all pages with formulas via this:
 elisp (use-package math-preview :straight t :custom (math-preview-command "/opt/homebrew/bin/math-preview")) (setq math-preview-scale 1.75) (setq math-preview-tex-marks-inline '(("$$" "$$"))) (setq math-preview-tex-marks '(("\\begin{equation}" "\\end{equation}") ("\\begin{equation*}" "\\end{equation*}") ("$$" "$$") )) (add-hook 'org-mode-hook #'math-preview-all) 
 modification in custom so that it does not trigger on pages talking about money and only explicitly on a double $$ in case people were wondering. As you can probably tell from the preview command I'm on an M1 OSX system and straight as my package manager. This block works in my other config, so unsure if it's related to the fact nano uses fixed width in the main text (whereas I had variable pitch in my other config... or some other factor. Any insights appreciated.).
 I do notice that nano does some implicit (and nice!) rendering of things like CO_2 and sub and superscripts automatically inline typing, but this problem relates directly to complex math formula rendering. 
 Anyone got it working with nano?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm looking for some kind of utility that can present an overlay that displays the parameter names when the mouse hovers over a function invocation, with optional parameter descriptions.
 One feature would be to invoke a function that replaces a function call with an intermediate function that takes the named parameters, presenting a dialog where you enter the parameters.
 The idea is not to replace the function itself but use some kind generic function that can do it for any function.
 eg if a function defined as (defun dofunc a b c) it gets replaced by (param-call 'dofunc :a a-param :b b-param c: c-param) and presents a dialog for it.
 Any such thing in the Emacs universe?

 More? means cmd is expecting some additional command (creating multiline statemens). In cmd typying either ( or ^ result in More?, but I don't know what is causing this error in org-babel. Interestingly, if run like this:
 #+begin_src shell :results output :session shell echo "%cd%" echo "hello" #+end_src 
 I'm getting the right output:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For context, I have written complete bindings to five different C libraries (freetype2, libvorbis, libspng, al, Chipmunk2D) and the question in the title may very well be the last one I have concerning FFI for quite some time. The question originates from the fact that chiphunk strips prefixes, something no other low-level library I've seen does.
 Reasons for stripping prefixes:
  
The module structure was made for this. If there was a convention to be made for writing C bindings, this is the obvious default. Kudos for defining new Bool/Int/Float types, it's refreshing to remember Prelude is a module like any other one;
 Probably saves a few thousand characters per library, plus makes Haddock easier on the eyes;
  
Reasons to keep prefixes:
  
OpenGLRaw did it first and it still holds the gl prefix, same with gl;
 No need to explicitly qualify imports;
 Names stay at 1:1 to the API reference, if one exists;
  
There obviously is no one true answer to this question, I'm merely looking for the public opinion on this. I may well leave everything as is since the libraries work well enough regardless of the actual function names.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Electrical circuits have static topology, there is restricted dynamism through "switch" which i think is transistors. Do electrical circuits have "join" and if so what is it? You'd have to spill water on the circuit or have the ability to rewire itself. But the extent to which it can rewire is pre-determined by whatever was printed on the board.
 What is a higher order function or closure in an electrical circuit? It is a "piece of circuit" that can be joined or not, but the ways in which the join can be activated are constrained, so this is not actually join. Circuits are compiled. Do HOFs compile to "piece of circuit" guarded by switches?
 How would one model a concurrent list comprehension (dynamic cardinality) in a circuit? This should be possible with applicative because the continuation is pre-fabbed and reused, though here we need multiple instances of it. Can a circuit do this or do you need to print the continuation C times to the board, thus constraining the list cardinality by amount of "memory" on the board? Is this the essence of applicative – you do not know how much memory you will need?
 Can we encode dynamism into the frequency domain? A single physical circuit on the board, and multiple input signals multiplexed through the circuit simultaneously?

 The question in the back of my mind is why does a pure inmutable language need garbage collection for (which is an instant disqualify from AAA games an any other real time task I guess and the big selling point of Rust)?
 Variables are scoped to functions and in need of Ref and friends, living inside monads couldn’t they just be destroyed automatically (in a deterministic way) once out of the context?
 I get being lazy has a toll on memory usage, but is that a real limitation nowadays?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I refused to install VS Code in this laptop and default to Emacs for everything. I used vanilla Emacs without many issues for a while, but decided to use Prelude yesterday.
 Oh, it's so nice, but at the same time... I know I can disable guru-mode, plus customize the few things that irk me... but maybe there's a better starter kit?
 My objectives are:
  
No modal editing: I know vim basics, but I don't want a modal editor.
 I work most frequently with Python, Java, and Rust. Prolog, Puppet, Ansible I also do frequently. Wide language support would be nice. I'm a believer of LSP, so I'd like to use LSP.
 I write a lot of AsciiDoc for work. Being able to integrate aspell and Vale would be a big plus (recommended plugin for Vale is https://github.com/tpeacock19/flymake-vale , which is not in MELPA- maybe a straight.el-using starter kit would be helpful? Or perhaps I should just submodule/subtree/subrepo it?)
 Reasonably similar to vanilla Emacs- I don't want to be too lost without my configuration.
 Multi-account email client? I already mbsync two personal accounts (GMail and Yahoo) for backup purposes, might consider handling work email in Emacs too.
 I work significantly on RHEL 8 systems, which ship Emacs 26.1, and also on a RHEL 9 box (27.1).
  
Thoughts, suggestions?

 I found the interface that I need to implement: https://github.com/sbt/test-interface
 As I did not find any documentation, I checked existing Frameworks.
 They had in common to use org.portablescala.reflect.annotation.EnableReflectiveInstantiation to discover Test classes (I think that is my missing point). 
 But this does not work with Scala 3. Does anyone know a Test Framework that uses Scala 3, or better has some instructions on how to implement the sbt interface? 
 Here is my dummy implementation so far. When adding the testFramework to sbt it seems to be picked, but nothing really happens (see printlns - PRINTED vs. NOT PRINTED ): 
 final class SimulationTestFramework extends Framework: val name: String = "CSimulation" val fingerprints: Array[Fingerprint] = Array(SimulationFingerprint) println(s"SimulationTestFramework started") // PRINTED def runner( args: Array[String], remoteArgs: Array[String], testClassLoader: ClassLoader ): SimulationRunner = println("TestRunner started") // NOT PRINTED new SimulationRunner(args, remoteArgs, testClassLoader) end SimulationTestFramework object SimulationFingerprint extends SubclassFingerprint: def superclassName(): String = "camundala.simulation.custom.CustomSimulation" final def isModule() = true final def requireNoArgConstructor() = false println(s"Simulation Fingerprint for ${superclassName()}") // PRINTED final class SimulationRunner( val args: Array[String], val remoteArgs: Array[String], testClassLoader: ClassLoader ) extends Runner: override def tasks(taskDefs: Array[TaskDef]): Array[sbt.testing.Task] = { println("TASKS") // NOT PRINTED Array() } override def done(): String = println("it is done") // NOT PRINTED "ok down" end SimulationRunner

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi. I'm still fairly new to emacs, and usually I'd solve this problem myself, but I am honestly overwhelmed. When I search for emacs customizations, I'm curious how to enable flymake for basic linting, i.e. underlining forgotten semicolons i.e. Now, emacs does behave strangely if I make a syntax error (weird tabs, spacing, etc), which is a decent indicator. However, this doesnt show what the error is. 
 I'm asking because there's like 20 different flymake options in the customization panel.
 I've tried activating flymake-mode, but doesn't seem to do anything when I write bad syntax on purpose for testing.

 There are reveal.js, impress.js and others, but I think Spectacle is the most powerful.
 With this ox-spectacle.el, a spectacle.js backend for org export engine, you can make beautiful and powerful slideshow easily. To me, it's one of the best solutions to create slideshows.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I just started using emacs again after 10 years :-). I'm using the basic GNU Emacs distribution for Windows 64. Without having to use a hot-rodded version, I was looking for some info on a few basic customization tips that almost anyone new to emacs would want to do. For example, I figured out how to change fonts, window size and basic foreground/background colors and put those commands into my "init.el" file, so now it looks better (and is more usable for me).
 It would be nice to figure out how to make Emacs use the mouse for basic cut and paste from the clipboard. also, if you are in the command line, it would be great if the up-arrow key would give you command history (is that possible ?). Is there a list somewhere of the top "5" things a new emacs user would want to do to make Emacs more useful/friendly out of the box ? ... and how to do it ?

Especially when I search for keywords which occur in a lot of zettels or that are very short (like e.g. "git") it takes me a while to find the right zettel. Well, compared to Niklas Luhmann it's still ligheting fast, but thats another story. ;-)
Searching is something I do a lot while working with my Zettelkasten. As I said before, title search is the feature I miss the most in The Archive.
On the other hand, I asked myself: would a combined search of title and content not even be better?
To check that out, I made a little Python script that I just pusblished on GitHub (for the first time, by the way – quite exiting!). This is the link:
https://github.com/ralfzosel/zk-smart-search
The installation chapter is quite short – probably too short, if you never used Python before. So if you want to check out my script  (which would make me very happy) and if you have any trouble make it run, I am happy to assist.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am using LSP from within Doom Emacs with evil enabled. 
  
Code actions: When there is only one available code action, lsp-execute-code-action automatically executes the action without asking me to confirm first, this is problematic since often I just want to see what code actions are available on a line, without necessarily executing them. What is the workaround for this?
 
The intellisense messages on the right side of the screen are often truncated due to a lack of space on my screen. How can I view the entire message when this is the case? Surely there's a better way than just flycheck-list-errors since I have to actually visually search where in the list the error/warning corresponding to my current line is. Add further to this fact the ID columns on that interface is often truncated

 (And tangentially related: why does flycheck-list-errors provide a different error list than consult-lsp-diagnostics? I have an example of this which I can produce upon demand.)
 ​
  
When LSP shows some information about what I'm typing in the minibuffer, how can I choose to view that information in full? See the image below. You can even see the "1/3" page label. How do I access those pages? If I press ESC so I can press K, pressing ESC gets rid of the message in the minibuffer and then attempting to press K will simply yield LSP :: No content at point.

next-error / flycheck-next-error does not let you navigate to warnings (despite warnings appearing in the flycheck 'error' list). Is there a command that also lets me navigate to the next/previous warning?
  
​
  
Are there any other LSP usage tips I should know about?

 Found an open source solution such as diagrams.net which can create several kinds of diagrams without installing/tuning additional software for each kind of diagrams. Run the software paste code of your diagram into the form and get new diagram. But such kind of manual work is not emacs way . It would be cool to have org-babel 'transport' to it and result back.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been working on integrating nano into my current setup (which is going nicely). Really like the aesthetic (though it still needs some tweaking). Good use of an hour!
 One really weird thing I encountered which I can't figure out - I'm using nano-modeline (not sure if tthat's relevant - I am *not* using nano-bindings), but whenever I pull up the date picker to insert a date, in my old system, I would abuse S-RightArrow or S-DownArrow to move quickly through the calendars and Return to pick the date. 
 However when I try this with nano's setup, while I get the calendar pop up, a shift Right, Down or Left gets me a [No window right from the selected window] etc type message like it's trying to move to another window or buffer rather than move along the datepicker calendar. Strangely, other keys like M-S-Arrow etc seem to work fine.
 Does anyone know what I've done here or have an idea of what I need to do to restore the default date picking behaviour? (my muscle memory and sanity depend on it).

However, this does not look consistent at all. I thought that tree-sitter would put a focus on giving e.g. local variables like v below the same color throughout the entire scope. but this does not seem to be the case. Am I missing sth here? because like this I dont see any merit over the ordinary highlighting

 Strangely, when I use the following simple block for it:
 elisp (use-package org-modern :straight t :after org ) (add-hook 'org-mode-hook #'org-modern-mode) (add-hook 'org-agenda-finalize-hook #'org-modern-agenda) 
 this causes org-super-agenda (which I heart and abuse regularly) to pitch the following error, which I assume has something to do with org-modern overriding org-agenda or cstom commands somehow. 
 shell Error (use-package): org-super-agenda/:config: Symbol’s function definition is void: org-modern-agenda 
 Any ideas as to what may be going on or how to resolve it? (it is definitely the last hook in the org-modern block that causes the issue as when I comment it out, org-super-agenda triggers normally. 
 thanks! Daryl. PS> Lemme know if you need me to paste up the o-s-a block. Though I feel it's probably not related to it for some reason.

 I'm having trouble with python mode. Specifically, there's a command `python-check` which runs a code checker on the current buffer. You can specify which checker to run and by default it's `pyflakes`.
 Everything works as expected and the code gets checked. However, if I try to use `flake8`, the encoding is all messed up (from what I understand) and I can't seem to figure out how to fix this.
 You can see the code (lsp works as expected and I do get autocomplete, suggestions, documentation, etc with pyright)
 All good here, lsp works as intented
 Now, if I run `pyflakes`, here is what I get:
 ​
 This is also good, pyflakes works as expected
 Now I run `python-check` (C-c C-v keybinding):
 flake8 instead of pyflakes
 And what I get is this:
 flake8 encoding?
 Which actually works, but my guess is encoding is messed up somewhere and I am not sure where exactly.
 As a side note, running `flake8` in vterm works normally:
 vterm
 I also tried `(set-language-environment)` to UTF-8, but that didn't help.
 Has anyone encountered something like this and resolved it?
 Thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone!
 I am really struggling to get good performances on windows with emacs...
 As far as I understand, windows sub-process and file system is working against emacs way of doing things. Therefore I've read multiple times that switching to WSL makes emacs much more performant. Also using a VM with Unix might help.
 I've tried that and basically have seen 0 improvement, especially with LSP and maggit. I've built emacs from source to be sure that native comp, etc, is enabled.
 Using only the Linux file system (not using /c/...) made emacs a little better but still far from my Linux experience with it :( my config works really well on Linux, so I don't think it is problematic?
 I am using emacs for very different purposes such as: unity c#, c++ dev (sometimes with VS), .Net, org mode, org roam, trump edit, etc... Which makes it hard to live only in the wsl Linux file system as far as I've been able to test (a pain with unity, a pain with VS, a pain with / and \, a pain with crlf and lf, etc...)
 Does anyone have a good way to have a performant emacs on windows please? Does the native window switch on v29 improves anything?
 Emacs is such a good piece of software, it makes me really sad that after battling for months to try to solve the problem, I find myself on the verge to switch editor again because I cannot ditch windows...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I cross-reference with RefTeX using reftex-reference (C-c )). It's very convenient as it opens a list of available macros, followed by a type of references, followed by a list of labels to insert. On the other hand, cleveref extends cross-referencing, which add very useful macros and does other things as well.
 Currently, my routine is to press C-c ), insert a standard \ref{}, and then change it to \cref{}.
 I tried to find solutions, which implement Cleveref in RefTeX but there is not many sources; the one I found here on TeX does not seem to work; It does not add anything new to the list.
 I found somewhere else this line: (setq reftex-refstyle "\\cref"). This is OK. RefTeX no longer asks for a macro but go straight to a list of types followed by a list of labels. Then it inserts \cref{...} with a proper string.
 This works but ideally though I would have a proper list of macros available from Cleveref: \cref{}, \Cref{}, \namecref{}, \pagecref{} etc. on top of regular macros.
 Does anyone have or know about a working solution?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I believe org-mode has recently deprecated the use of org-font-lock-ensure in favour of font-lock-something. So, suddenly my emacs 29 stopped showing backlinks in org-roam. I've downgraded to emacs 28 and this seems to solve the problem but was just curious as to if there are nay fixes for this (tho weirdly, 28 seems just as smooth as 29 - note I am using homebrew to install emacs 29.0.60). 
 I *believe* this is what caused it googling around and troubleshooting but was curious as to whether anyone had had the same experience and if there was clarity on the path to supporting 29 (cause I often find it's hard to tell when it's safe to upgrade or do a straight-pull =] ).

Keywords
The keywords should be instructive for the type of task. I have started to distinguish whether an audio-visual input is an interview or a lecture. It is completely irrelevant to me at the action level. I sit down at my computer in both cases and take notes as I watch and listen.
For me personally, it doesn't even make a difference whether I'm listening to a podcast or watching a video. I do both on my computer, because I only listen to both at home with access to my computer. I don't listen to anything on the side while on the road.
Rather, I differentiate by length when assigning keywords: short (<20min) or long (>20min) audio-visual inputs, because I build both differently into my workday.
This is how my current note about Things looks like. Do you have any template or regular practices when you make notes about software?]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I'm new to emacs and I built v28.2 on my Pop! OS Linux instance. I'm trying to get my init file to work to set the initial window (frame) size.
 I've created an init.el file in my .emacs.d folder in home (i.e., ~/.emacs.d/init.el), but it doesn't seem to be executed.
 When I start emacs, it looks like this:
 Figure 1. Initial Emacs Window (roughly 900x900)
 What I want is for it to look like this:
 Figure 2. Resized Emacs Window (roughly 2500x1100)
 But it always starts out as Figure 1 and the only way to get it to Figure 2 is if I open my init.el (right-click in Nautilus and select emacs).
 And here is a third view showing my .emacs.d (shown by C-x C-f of ~/.emacs.d), the contents of the init.el file and the value of my user-emacs-directory (which is ~/.emacs.d/):
 Figure 3. .emacs.d folder, init.el file, and user-emacs-directory variable value.
 I've also tried renaming the init.el file as .emacs and putting it my home folder with the same result.
 What am I missing here?
 EDIT: responses based on replies:
  
user-init-file shows "~/.emacs", which, as noted above, I tried along with .emacs.d/init.el without success
 When normally opening emacs, my/set-initial-frame is not defined. If I open the .emacs file from Nautilus, it opens the frame correctly and my/set-initial-frame is defined. If I rename the .emacs file to "foo" and open that from Nautilus, it doesn't set the frame and my/set-initial-frame is not defined.
 No errors in *Messages* buffer
 There is no emacs folder in .config
 initial-frame-alist is always 'nil' (when it works and when it doesn't)
 Not sure if I'm running emacs server, but server-mode variable is 'nil'
  
Note the original .emacs content I found here.
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My new note-taking/zettelkasting mantra is: Create, review, and edit with abandon. Trust that something surprising or magical will happen.

  
I realized that in a few months, let alone years, at this rate most of my time would be spent on the maintenance of memories [notes]. I, as others have found, would be too busy maintaining these memories to use them. 1


What does "use" mean? I can use a note's contents to reignite ideas in me. They can spark new, novel ideas and connections with established knowledge. Some balance between creation, review, and maintenance has to be made in zettelkasting. In that sense, zettelkasting is like dog training. Dog training is hard work, and it is often not fun to train, but the rewards of a well-trained dog show up throughout the day.
Reviewing zettel has been a focus of mine, and I highly recommend it. Looking at notes created yesterday, three weeks ago, six months ago, and last year is a great start. If we develop notes sporadically, we'll probably only have one or two notes to review. Slowly and steadily, we plow through our notes, and in time, we will have reviewed every note multiple times.
I think Minto is confused about how much time it takes to review a couple of notes (if atomic, focus on a single idea) and how a short review over and over builds, reinforces knowledge, and shows not only new connections but whole new ideas.
Is it true that the ideas captured in our notes are not worth reviewing? I suggest the next to capture, the review is the most essential piece in a ZK workflow.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In Scala 2 we used implicits object pattern:
 import acme.Acme import acme.implicits._ 
 In Scala 3 we are supposed to use import given:
 import acme.{Acme, given} 
 However, import given doesn't truly replace the functionality of the pattern:
  
In Scala 2, "extensions" were coded as implicit class, so they were covered by import acme.implicits._
 
In Scala 3 extension is not given. So import given ignores them.
 
 In consequence, the old "implicits object pattern" must be kept alive, for orphaned extensions:
 import acme.{Acme, given} import acme.extensions._ 
 I believe this deficiency may have been overlooked, because non-orphaned (is there a name for it?) extensions don't need explicit imports (which is a great feature BTW).
 Proposed solutions:
 1. Make import recognize extensions as givens, just for the sake of it:
 import acme.{Acme, given} // imports extensions too import acme._ // does not import extensions 
 2. Add another type of import: import extension
 import acme.{Acme, given, extension}

 Zombie movement and attack
 Zombies move forward a space equal to their speed each turn, if they can. If a zombie cannot move forward because there is a plant in the space it is standing on, the zombie bites the plant and reduces its hit points by 1 and remains on that space. The only exception to this is the Vaulting zombie: if its speed is still 2 , then he jumps over the first plant and moves on, but his speed is reduced to 1.
 Let's define the performZombieActions function, which will perform the aforementioned appropriate action on all zombies in the model. If a zombie reaches the end of the playing field, return Nothing! The function does not have to delete dead plants!

 However, When I trying to learn wasm+go, eglot is output giving me following error:

 it's probably because of not setting environmental variable, right?. The wasm code compiles with $ GOOS=js GOARCH=wasm go build -o main.wasm. And eglot doesn't know about GOOS=js and GOARCH=wasm yet.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am running GUI Emacs on Arch Linux WSL2 (Vcxsrv X-server). I am noticing a significant slowdown when I full-screen my GUI Emacs. The slowdown is particularly noticeable in input latency. When I type fast, I would have to wait a few seconds for the letters to appear one by one.
 When I shrink down the size of the GUI frame, Emacs becomes very snappy and responsive. I have noticed a positive correlation between Emacs lag and the size of the frame -- this is the weirdest thing I've come across since I started using Emacs years ago. Running no configuration with `emacs -q` is the same thing -- significant latency when the frame is big.
 Has anyone been faced with this issue? I am so bewildered by this but can't find anything related online. At the moment I'm using terminal Emacs as the frame-size vs. latency issue does not exist in the terminal.

 [cling]$ 1 11 (int) 1 [cling]$ 2 22 (int) 2 [cling]$ apple aapappapplappleapple input_line_6:2:2: error: use of undeclared identifier 'apple' apple ^ [cling]$ 
 The repeated strings right under the input prompt aren't suppose to be there, under term and terminal.app it all worked fine (i.e. without the repeated gibberish).
 That makes me wonder if it is possible to start a comint process using term or vterm

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Raku programming language hashes name, version, author, and other package metadata and uses the hash as the directory name for a library or a program. Even the names of program resource files are hashed before installing resource files.
 Raku didn't have to hash, but it did because some file systems don't support unicode file names.
 The end result is that it's possible for a raku module repository to host a library written by different authors and for raku programs to import different versions of the same library written by different authors. I think this is almost the most advanced module system.
 I think haskell can do the same by differentiating name, version, and author of a library or a program when installing them onto a system. Then, haskell can install and import multiple versions of a library written by different authors. This can mitigate downsides of dynamic linking.
 If hackage hosted a library written by different authors, then no one has to ask hackage maintainers for taking over an unmaintained library or program.

The catch: These times are not consistent from day to day, as they are related to the length of the day and the time of sunrise and sunset. As such, a simple daily timer doesn't work. Various online services give times for Zmanim, such as this one (New York for an arbitrary example). 
 I'm interested in setting up Emacs to give Zmanim times. I don't know of any package that does this. Is there such a package, and if not, is there a package that can accept timers with offsets or scrape a specific website to provide that information?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I remember from Dan Grossman's Programming Languages course in SML that if you changed anything, you'd have to restart the REPL to make sure you weren't shadowing or clashing with stuff. So for example I load this into a ghci REPL
 fracEquiv a b c = (a * c) / b 
 and I don't want that version anymore, I want my fancier version
 fracEquiv = \a b c -> ((a * c) / b) 
 So I guess my new fracEquiv overwrites the old one. Problem solved(?) But what if I just called it fracEquiv2 and wanted to make the REPL forget about the original fracEquiv ? So in general, is there a way to dump/see what the REPL has and then go in and excise -- or even change -- what's in the running REPL? Or am I just flying blind and having to remember what's in the REPL, overwrite or restart it? So if Haskell doesn't allow this, do you know of any REPL-based languages that do?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone!
 Some time ago, I commented in the Alchemist Resurrection issue, talking about how alchemist.el can be a nice alternative to LSP. 
 BUT, with the news that in the next Emacs version eglot (lsp client) is going to be in the core, I decide to modify alchemist in a different way, enhancing other capabilities and letting eglot do what he best does (which is the functionality of elixir-ls).
 I'm quite relief to know that this lsp server is FROM the community and heavily inspired by the original alchemist-server.
 For now, Apprentice is usable, similar to alchemist.el but with most of the merge requests in place and with some changes:
  
Remove s, f and dash dependencies
 Remove cask as a project manager, using a simple Makefile (I don't have anything against Cask, but I prefer to use my method)
 No alchemist server, this is the main point and all the functionality that was using some of the underlying capabilities are not working (but some of them will be implemented in a different way)
 An optional vterm REPL with IEx
  
My next steps will be to fix some underlying functionality that was quite useful like help and macroexpand. 
 I hope in the future to submit this fork to MELPA (given that alchemist.el is no longer maintained),for now, here is the project:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm having trouble finding how to copy and paste notes from some windows files I have in OneNote vs emacs.
 My org-mode files are in UTF-8 and I am mid process of moving a lot of info at work from OneNote into emacs to try to consolidate a few years worth of notes in OneNote, Joplin, Logsec, Obsidian...
 Anyway, when the bullet points are copied into Emacs, I get \225 characters that are the code for the windows bullet point and I can't save the file without errors into UTF-8 like I do with my other files.
 I saved it as Raw text now to try and use M-x find-file-literally and M-x replace-string but when I type in the code as it looks in emacs, I can't replace '\225' with a dash '-' to convert it to a emacs normal list.
 Am I using the find-file-literally wrong? I can manually change all of the text but I've done that a few times and tried a few things now and I don't know what I need to do to replace the \225, \247, type characters that come over from whatever windows type character they are.
 Also, I am on Windows 10, using emacs 28.2 and doom-emacs.
 Attached are screenshots of what it looks like and what buffer output I get trying to convert all this.

 The solution is to set TERM = dumb, however, I have used setenv process-environment to set TERM to dumb, still inside the inferior julia, ENV["TERM"] is vt50.
 Opening a terminal and type TERM=linux julia, this change is reflected inside the process, i.e. ENV["TERM"] is linux. 
 Is this a case of processes started with comint not respecting TERM environmental variable??
 I am confused about this behaviour.

Reading https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/CopyAndPaste most packages deal with reading the system clipboard content and not setting it. I tried simpleclip.el but when running simpleclip-copy I got the error message Clipboar suppot not available.
 I can use emacs in graphical mode, but really prefer emacs-nox, because I mostly live in Konsole. Plus some keyboard shortcuts do not work in graphical mode like C-c down (C-c M-O B) (command-org-shiftdown) which I haven't investigated the cause of.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My current init.el is shared between 3 computers: my Linux desktop, my main work (intel) macbook with thunderbolt dock + closed lid + 3 attached screens, and my (m1) macbook that I use on the couch etc.
 I switch between Linux and MacOS specific configs with several blocks like this:
 (defun my-system-type-is-darwin () "Return non-nil if system is darwin-based (Mac OS X)." (string-equal system-type "darwin") ) (when (my-system-type-is-darwin) (global-set-key (kbd "s-/") 'comment-or-uncomment-region-or-line) ) 
 So I've got the different system types fairly easily distinguished.
 Unfortunately, the font sizes that work OK on the main docked macbook with multiple screens don't work well on the undocked/portable macbook.
 Any advice on a robust way to tell which mac I'm using, with a view to the config working on other screen configurations? I was thinking I could just detect a hard-coded "if 3 screens of these dimensions then do X, if 1 screen of those dimensions do Y" but I'm not sure the best way to do that, or even if that is the best way to do what I want.
 Any other tips for sharing a single init.el between multiple computers?

 OK, I'm dumb. I found the answer myself within 30 minutes.
 The culprit was make-symbol, which creates an uninterned symbol which is distinct from regular symbols that are checked using assq. Now I changed make-symbol to intern in rangho/create-color-matrix-alist and everything works fine!
 Original post
 I wanted to try using let-alist to simplify my colorscheme code. Basically, I have an alist of colors and its hex values, and I have a list of HSL percentage points. I want to create a new "matrix" alist where each colors are lightened by the "lighten list". This is the code:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When designing a storage solution for large datasets, the most common families of architectures are data warehouses and data lakes.
A data warehouse is a database management system that houses data from multiple data sources.
Data is structured in a predefined schema, and can be easily analyzed.
A data lake stores all structured, semi-structured and unstructured data in an object storage system.
Unlike a data warehouse, it is not necessary to process data in order to add it to a data lake.
While data lakes are often more flexible in terms of writing data when compared with data warehouses, reading data can be more difficult because it has to be validated against a schema.
This is known as “schema-on-read”.
Now consider the following figure, introduced by Databricks:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just went through this, so I thought I'd document it for Google. What I wanted was a) for Emacs to open new files in the same frame where possible, and b) for my init.el to actually work in the new frames.
 1. Put .emacs.d in user folder
 It saves a lot of messing around if your .emacs.d is in C:\Users[username]\AppData\Roaming, but if you're like me, you actually keep it on Dropbox or something. So I made a symbolic link that points to it on Dropbox:
  
Start an elevated (admin) cmd prompt
 cd C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Roaming
 mklink /D .emacs.d C:\Dropbox\Apps\emacs\.emacs.d (for example)
  
2. Make a shortcut to start the Emacs Daemon
  
Make a shortcut to emacs-28.1\bin\emacs.exe
 Add --daemon to the end of the Target (e.g. C:\Dropbox\Apps\emacs\emacs-28.1\bin\emacs.exe --daemon)
 I didn't change Start In.
 Put this shortcut into your Startup folder (C:\Users[username]\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup) so that a new server starts with Windows.
 Run this now to start the server.
  
3. Make a shortcut to Emacs ClientW
  
Make a shortcut to emacs-28.1\bin\emacsclientw.exe
 Add -n -t -a "" to the end of the Target (e.g. C:\Dropbox\Apps\emacs\emacs-28.1\bin\emacsclientw.exe -n -t -a "")
 I didn't change Start In.
  
The presence of -t lets you run this shortcut to open a new Emacs client frame that starts at *scratch*.
 The absence of -c makes Emacs open files in an existing frame instead of _c_reating a new one. 
 This emacsclientw shortcut is what you point to when you're telling Windows what app to use to open text files etc.
 4. Make some changes to init.el
 ;; Set custom font here or else new frames won't see it (add-to-list 'default-frame-alist '(font . "Hack-12")) ;; You may want to have dired start in a specific folder (setq default-directory "C:/Dropbox/")

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Since it's Advent of Code season, I've been trying my hand at Haskell (again) for solving puzzles, and I'm also using Stack for building them.
 I organize each day's puzzle into standalone executable, say day07_1 for part 1, and day07_2 for part 2. What I notice is that, when I run stack run day07_1 with source changes, Stack installs every binary configured in stack.yaml at that point. 
 Installing executable day03_1 in /path/to/project/.stack-work/install/x86_64-linux-tinfo6/dc2a579bc1e31f17298a361ff9411c0bf46198b8cd4c4cdef19391b674e4f1ff/9.2.5/bin 
 Obviously, as I add more and more binaries, this gets increasingly annoying. I'd prefer that it rebuilds only the binary I asked it to build.
 Does anyone know why Stack does this, and if there's a way to tell it not to do so? I don't see any relevant options in stack run --help.
 As a workaround, I'm commenting out binaries in stack.yaml than the very one I'm working on at a given time, which is not ideal.

 I see this kind of type error from time to time, and often find it difficult to identify the source of the problem. Usually, it's a mistake elsewhere that throws things off, but here the only change preserves type. The error messages and alternative instances are not helping me at all.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi All,
 I have a longstanding issue I haven't found a solution for. Any time I'm editing an org mode file my cursor will automatically "suck back" to the last text on the screen. For example, I type a sentence, finish with a period then hit space twice to start the new sentence. If I don't type something immediately (like less than a second) the cursor is pulled back to the period, removing the space(s).
 Needless to say it's rather annoying behavior. It's 100% consistent and what I gave was just an example, it's happening in any scenario...using spaces or tabs, happening in lists, etc.
 This is Doom Emacs and I'm running this in 28.1 on Void Linux but it was there in 27.x as well.
 Let me know if there any more info I can provide and TIA for your help.

 It has useful type-level features that are not difficult to understand.

 find [...] -exec grep --color=always -i -nH --null gef\ördert \{\} \;
 Grep returns with no results found. The problem is that the umlaut ö get's prepended with an escaping sequence. If I run the same command on the commandline without the backslash, grep succeeds. Why is Emacs escaping certain characters anyhow, especially utf-8 valid characters?
 Using bash as the shell. file encoding is utf-8, I set LC_ALL in .profile to en_US.utf8, LANG=C, SHEL=/bin/bash. My Windows is German though.

 Is there a way to temporarily open a file without activating any modes to just extract data I need and close it? Something like:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As a newcomer here I just wanted to share my point of view for the community and any maintainers. Emacs has already expanded my mind and I'm beginning to grok the power of having a Lisp system at my fingertips. Now I can get through the more research-intensive install (on macOS at least) to find the best build and install flags. And I can get through learning and customizing any historical quirks of software going on 50 years strong..
 But one big obstacle to me, which isn't customizable, is that the cursor is always in view. Even in the GUI there is this trait which makes it feel like a terminal application (which it did start as). It fundamentally changes how one selects and navigates text (select text, scroll back up and select region disappears). In a world where every other GUI app doesn't behave this way, it is a big change. It feels like a constraint. This will force me deeper into keyboard centric navigation which is fine. I just think cursor flexibility should not be overlooked and for younger people who are switching from other editors and have used the mouse their whole lives, I can see it hurting adoption.
 This is probably very hard to implement, going against how it has always worked, but I think that would be good to at least have an option to let cursor scroll off screen. Let me know what you think. Kinda related: does anyone know of a package that makes the select region wrap around words instead of going edge to edge on screen?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've tried googling to see if there is a function within haskell to check a number to see if it a Double. I had no luck there so now I am trying to make my own. Right now, I have (gotten from StackOverflow):
 isDouble :: Double -> Bool isDouble n = if (floor n) == (ceiling n) then False else True 
 Now this works majority of the time, the only issue is when a number has ".0" after. If I were to test 2.0, it returns False, despite actually being a Double. I know this is because both the floor and ceiling are 2. Is there any way around this? Or should I be trying a different approach?

 Yes, it is possible for a database to use ODBC (Open Database Connectivity) to access tables stored in the Emacs org-mode format.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Good afternoon folks! I'm Tracy, from Ontario, Canada.
I've been slowly familiarizing myself with some of the zettel intros, posts, and concepts, while also trying to be realistic and conscious about the way my brain works and what will be a sustainable habit to introduce into my existing notes system. Currently, my notes span across academia, professional work, personal stuff, grocery lists, conceptual ideas, project sketches/outlines, and even video game progress plans.
These notes are captured in Zotero attachments, paper bullet journals, google docs, iOS Notes App, liquidtext pdf editor, the reminders app... I don't think I'll be able to so cleanly bundle everything into one tool, but I like the idea of taking the things that really engage and interest me and giving them their own space in the archive so I can make cross-disciplinary connections or revelations!
I am afflicted with the "it needs to be perfect" to start with, and something I've been working on is just doing something "poorly" or "haphazardly" to get that attitude out of the way. My first zettel in the archive software was just me testing the archive syntax (which is new to me) and reflecting on how it feels with my style of note-taking.
Anyways, looking forward to learning more about zettelkasten, knowledge practices, my own brain processes, and the challenge of sorting, retaining, releasing, and integrating knowledge in a way that is helpful to my own goals]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Not going to start flooding the sub with chatbot posts, but ChatGPT managed to output a functional program (discounting some empty lists) for grouping and sorting text:
  
 write a haskell program to process text into groups and sort based on the first letter of the line
  
Here is a simple Haskell program that processes text into groups and sorts each group based on the first letter of each line:
 import Data.Char import Data.List -- This function takes a string of text and returns a list of groups, where -- each group is a list of lines that start with the same letter. The groups -- are sorted alphabetically based on the first letter of each line. processText :: String -> [[String]] processText text = -- First, we split the text into a list of lines let lines = lines text -- Next, we group the lines by their first letter grouped = groupBy (\x y -> (toLower . head) x == (toLower . head) y) lines -- Finally, we sort the groups alphabetically by their first letter sorted = sortBy (\x y -> (toLower . head . head) x < (toLower . head . head) y) grouped in sorted -- This is an example of how to use the processText function main :: IO () main = do let text = "hello\nworld\napple\nbanana\ncat\ndog" let groups = processText text putStrLn $ show groups 
 The output of this program when run on the example text given in the main function would be:
 [["apple"], ["banana"], ["cat"], ["dog"], ["hello", "world"]] 
  
Needed some minor cleanup to compile: sortBy takes an a -> a -> Ordering, not a a -> a -> Bool, and the lines variable name needed changing to not match the function. Once complete, it compiles and functions more or less as expected. I could spot the head would likely give trouble on empty lists (which it did) and that groupBy could produce some strange groupings, but wild to see the skeleton of a decent sort function produced so easily. Like AI art, this could be pretty useful for brainstorming, if the results aren't outright useful themselves.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am aware of the cl-lib library, and it is pretty cool if you want to write elisp code that is pretty close to Common Lisp code. 
 HOWEVER, is there any sort of interop library that would allow one to program IN Common Lisp to extend emacs? I would think such an interop system would allow one to interact with Emacs' buffer functionality in particular. 
 I'm not really sure that such a thing is very practical or would interest many people. But I recently wrote a Python interop library that allows me to use Python libraries from within Common Lisp, and I found it really helped my own understanding of Lisp quite a bit. 
 I'm just wondering if anything like that has been done. So far, my google searches don't reveal much.

 I'm in a buffer in a directory and I want to find all the files matching a pattern at or below the current directory. What is a simple (or perhaps the simplest) way to get that list?
 What I do now is switch to a terminal (outside of emacs) and using zsh I do print -l **/*-ts-*.el (or whatever pattern I'm looking for). It seems very likely that there is a simpler way to do this from within Emacs. I'm open to loading more applications on my laptop if that would help. This need seems to come up with me very often.

 Any one comes to mind?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So Atom has shut down. I could probably still use it, but for permanence I decided to switch to Emacs since I'm extremely picky with my editors. 
 To be honest, the first time I tried it I was disappointed how hard it was do something simple as save a file, copy/paste and whatnot. However, the "steep learning curve" everyone talks about is just a matter of having a nanosecond of patience. Then speed comes later. What I love about the keybindings is it confines all of my work to the keyboard and the bindings are ergonomic if you also use the right Ctrl and shift keys. My workflow is honestly magnitudes better, being able to jump at lightning speed, completely neglecting arrow keys and the mouse. Also, for the first time ever, I am using all ten fingers to type. 
 The question: I've set up a theme which I like, auto pairing brackets, indent and auto-complete. Curious if there's a way to get linting support? i.e. underlining missing semicolons, typos. 
 Also, can I integrate a terminal into emacs as well? So far having the screen split with emacs and terminal (GNOME on Ubuntu) is working fine, but wondering if there's an even better way. 
 Thanks.

 But for monads, I can't even do that:
 example2 :: [Int] -> Maybe Int example2 = reverse >>> findIndex (== 5) >>> possiblyFailing where possiblyFailing x = x >>= Just . (* 2) 
 I'm pretty sure that there are idiomatic ways to both of the cases, but I'm just not able to find them 😅

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi Folks, hope everyone is well!
 I've been searching for some time to see if this is even possible in Org mode. It's so simple and hard to describe in searching that I've come up with nothing and it remains something that is keeping me from going all in on Org.
 Is there no way to promote a field of text in Org without a heading marker?
  
In the attached screenshot, I want the text with the arrow ("Promote this text...") to be promoted out of this double Subtree block to reside at the same level of text as if it were under History.
 "text here" should remain under Subtree.
  
Can this not be done or am I missing something simple?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Is it possible to refer to, or link to, a header in another org file? I'm thinking I may have to read up on org-agenda. 
 I keep a personal journal, and at this point, it's almost a thousand small markdown files no larger than 4k - one for (almost) each day. I refer to each one just simply by linking to the <date>.md and then make my journal entry there. 
 On the upside, I can check what I did this day a year, two year, etc ago by doing "ls *-12-06.md".. but on the other hand, it's really inefficient. 
 I was wondering if it would be more efficient to make an org file for each year and then have header lines for each day, plus additional ones for each topic underneath. I'd like to be able to link from another org file (say a project, or a movie review) and put a date on there and be able to pull up what I was doing that day.
 Any strategies for doing that in org/emacs?

So far I managed to do the first 4 challenges simply by putting them in different directories and using ghci or runhaskell to execute them. As the point of this is learning the language, I don't want to use any libraries not included in base, I'm implementing functions like split or chunks by myself, but including the implementations of these functions in every single challenge solution doesn't seem like a good idea. I'm not sure if Cabal would be a good idea because the project would consist of 25 separate solutions and 25 input files and I'm not sure how would that go. What is the best way to handle this kind of situation?

I just can't figure out how to make it load and be active for all org-mode buffers on starting Emacs. I usually use use-package for loading/configuring packages I’ve installed, but Org is so huge and complex that I find it easier to Customize.
 I can manually type M-x org-superstar-mode in an Org buffer and the trailing bullets do change from asterisks to UTF-8 bullets, so the package is definitely loaded.

In the second case, fib' is redefined for every argument x. The compiler cannot know whether you intended this -- while it increases time complexity it may reduce space complexity. Thus it will not float the definition out from under the binding of x.
 In contrast, in the first function, fib' can be moved to the top level by the compiler. The where clause hid this structure and made the application to x look like a plain eta expansion, which it is not. 
  
I cannot really understand how the compiler optimized the first definition of the function and not the second, apparently the redefinition of the function has an impact on time complexity.
 I know that a big part of FP optimization comes to know how to dance with the compiler, it's patterns and to lay stuff out for it to make "better". But unlike tail recursion, this trick doesn't seem as clear to me.
 I'd be most grateful for a clarification on how this works for a beginner haskeller, thanks :-).

 I have just moved to a macbook and I am already enjoying emacs even more than under WSL. But unfortunately, now the tab key sometimes stops working for emacs GUI. It is not even registered as a keypress: 'C-h c <tab>' just ignores the <tab> keypress. C-i is recognized as a tab press, and in the terminal things seem to work normally.
 I am on Monterey 12.5, emacsplus@28, using a doom config. I tried to find help online but so far was unsuccessful. I have disabled mission control key bindings, including the use of tab to shift focus, but it still seems to happen. Did somebody solve a similar problem? Does it have to do with the shell from which the emacs GUI is started? It might also be something basic about macOs, with which I am completely inexperienced. Thank you for any ideas how to find out what is happening.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was watching this video from Cal Newport's podcast where he briefly mentions Zettelkasten. The video is about how he uses a simple marking system while reading and how it makes note taking unnecessary for a professional writer. His definition of the Zettelkasten method is something like take notes on everything you read, regardless if it is relevant to your current project. As an example he gives Ryan Holiday. We know that is a poor definition of a Zettelkasten and Ryan is not a good example either. He takes copious notes, but there is no linking in his system. While I don't agree with his characterization of the Zettelkasten, I think it is true that some people use it that way.
Anyway, my point is not to complain about his characterization of the Zettelkasten, he mentioned another thing…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Super-newbie alert. 
 Hey, I'm working on a watched movie list for myself (prepping for 2023). One of my hobbies is watching movies (I watch maybe 100-200+ a year - yes that's 2 movies a week, sometimes more! I don't have cable and don't watch much TV outside those times) and I like to track what I've already watched. I had one set-up in Obsidian, but one thing I didn't like was the lack of portability (Dataview can only be read within Obsidian). So , I was wondering if I could replicate this in Emacs Org-mode. 
 Here's an example - 1st is from Obsidian, 2nd is from Emacs. 
 Is there a way to have it automatically wrap at a certain width? 
 I'm aware of M-RET M-RET, but I'd like a more automatic way of doing this, so I can see about typing in my comments a little quicker. For example:
 | IMDB | [[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt13533944][tt13533944]] | | Watched | 2022-11-19 | | Genre | Horror | | Comment | It was okay. It's a "folk horror" and it does pretty well for that. I did enjoy the different "scenery" since the movie was filmed in | | | Ireland. | | Released | 10 Nov 2022 | | | | 
 Also, is it possible to render an image inside a table cell or column? 
 And finally, I was thinking of attaching a movie cover to each "movie" header but then, how do I reference the attachment into an inline image?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi People!
I'm an geosciences investigator based in Santiago, Chile.
I found about Zettelkasten a few weeks ago while navigating Wikipedia on Systems Theory -> Niklas Luhman.
It was nice to know about it and got me really excited about the possibilities.
I try to apply systemic thinking on my research, complex systems and stuff, which is really interesting for me but also gave me an (pretty bad) information overload a few years ago. Complex systems theory allows you to see links between disciplines, which also can make hard to focus on one thing at a time.
I struggled through my endless master thesis process. It got me sick for real. Concentrating was sometimes impossible even for whole weeks. Gracefully I ended it well a few months ago and now I'm a researcher, in the meantime I prepare myself for doing my phd (hopefully 2024 in Berlin).
With renovated energies, I'm gradually managing to find a new flow for my work and personal life. A really important part is to develop a workflow, combining project management, journaling, synchronization/backing between home and work devices, code software integration.
I use to take notes by hand in a notebook. I have several of them filled with research logs, scientific articles notes, theory notes, ideas, day/week journals. I tried (space)emacs and org-mode a couple of years ago, learned the basics to left it completely a month later.
Now I decided to base my workflow on digital notes. I've sneak into doom emacs with org-roam, obsidian and vscode with dendron.
I'm inclining in favor of having a note-taking workflow integrated with vscode instead of emacs, as I program in vscode.
Since deciding on digital note-taking systems choice paradox led to paralysis analysis. But today I finally started with a weakly planner on markdown, in any case it will be not worse than writing it on a physical notebook that will be forgotten.
Thanks for maintaining this nice community.
All the best

 We have two different types (Dog, and Cat) which share some common structure (here, age). These types, in turn, are the only possible types for a more "general" type, for which we define a sum type (Pet) which holds values of these types.
 This is usually modeled through inheritance in languages like Java and C#, but since Haskell does not support it we use composition instead: we place the shared structure inside our types (here, only an Int is shared between the types, but imag…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is my research so far for database libraries I want to use with SQLite.
  
Serialization/deserialization over raw SQL queries 
 sqlite-simple
 
 Query builders 
 Persistent + Esqueleto // Get used to template haskell.
 Beam // This doesn't use template haskell. This has the most SQL features, but can also be more verbose and seemingly more complex than other options.
 Selda // This looks simpler than beam.
 
  
Should database(data & schema) migration be included from the beginning? Or, can it be bolted onto my application later?
 Which ones are going to be the best for a relatively simple SQLite application in the long term? I'm going to need basic JOINs and basic CRUD operations with probably less than 20 tables. I want to minimize maintenance in the long term like 30 ~ 50 years. Churning is not desirable. I want to write it once and not have to worry about replacing a database library later for as long as I use my application while I'm alive. Most open-source projects are maintained by less than 3 people, so I can't expect other people to keep up with library churning.
 For terminal UI, I chose brick because brick seems good and extremely well maintained although it's mostly a one-man show. It seems brick may outlast the usefulness of my application. The man behind brick must be a vigorous guy who grew up with proper nutrition because I have never seen a better maintained open-source project.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I would like to keep notes about using Ruby in an .org file. When it comes to simple repetitions working well in Ruby's irb, e.g.
  irb(main):038:1* 3.times do irb(main):039:1* puts "greetings" irb(main):040:0> end greetings greetings greetings => 3 
 my assumption was I simply could use a fenced snippet of code such as
 ``` #+begin_src ruby :results code :exports both 3.times do puts "greetings" end #+end_src
 #+RESULTS: #+begin_src ruby 3 #+end_src ```
 however instead of the anticipated greetings, it is the return value 3 which shows up. By my configuration file, babel is aware about ruby, and C-c ' opens the box; there equally is syntax highlighting. Is there an additional parameter to be adjusted to get greetings shown thrice as in the irb?

I’ll do some advent of code problems in a lisp and things seem to go well but as soon as I get stuck it feels impossible to find a solution that makes any sense. In terms of elisp I’ll write simple functions but when digging into plug-in source code feel like there is no amount of study that could make me competent in the language. Is this just the start of the valley of imposter syndrome where you know enough to know what you’re ignorant about or the inability to make the paradigm shift to thinking in a “lispy / function” way? Not meaning to rant just curious how people broke through this barrier if anyone has felt the same.

learning #memory
It is not clear how to operationalize memory [[202211150901]] and thus how exactly to best use how memory works.
Clearly, there are good and bad methods of learning. For an exam, merely repeating the material is inferior to active questioning. Repetition trains recall, while active questioning trains the very behavior of being able to give answers to questions that is required in exams.
Perhaps this results in a hierarchy of learning methods?
Thesis: You should start with simple memory techniques and then work your way up to more complex ones.
Repetition
Active retrieval
Comprehension
Comment: This was part of the last note.
Thanks to the feedback, I have separated the two knowledge modules:
the problem of operationalization
the method inspired by the problem (still undeveloped).]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I saw a demo over at EmacsConf that is related to tree-sitter and the presenter showed a helm chart file and showed fancy-narrow with it.
 If there is one format that I often use, it's helm chart files and they can be quite frustrating to edit; the error messages can be somewhat obscure at times, too, so any help I could get from Emacs would be fantastic. Even getting the indentation right can be really troublesome. I'm not sure if there is a good way to have Helm's extra syntax be handled better than yaml-mode seems to do.
 I installed the emacs-plus@29 on a Mac, and it seems to have some tree-sitter support in core, but it seems yaml support might not be there? Anyone else have tips on build(s) to use that might have this in there? From some of the activity it seemed it might be in the works; maybe nightly builds are needed to pick this up?

 edit: sorry, I think I should add that I'm using spacemacs and the config was added to my user-config section
 Every time I start emacs up, it recompiles the EmacSQL SQLite binary- it takes 20s every time, and it started doing that as I started to setup Org-roam. 
 Why? And can I improve this? 
 Relevant config:
  (use-package org-roam :ensure t :init (setq org-roam-v2-ack t) :custom (org-roam-directory (file-truename "~/Notes/org-roam/")) :bind (("C-c n l" . org-roam-buffer-toggle) ("C-c n f" . org-roam-node-find) ("C-c n g" . org-roam-graph) ("C-c n i" . org-roam-node-insert) ("C-c n c" . org-roam-capture) ;; Dailies ("C-c n j" . org-roam-dailies-capture-today)) :config (org-roam-db-autosync-mode) ) (add-hook 'org-mode-hook #'toggle-word-wrap) 
 edit: I've commented out the relevant config for now - it starts up in 1.5s which seems more reasonable.

 First, native compilation comes in two modes: synchronous and asynchronous. I was getting the error when the file was being compiled asynchronously.
 It turns out that I'm using leaf where leaf is a macro. Asynchronous starts fresh and so it doesn't know that leaf is a macro and gets confused. So the remedy is to (eval-when-compile (require 'leaf)) at the top of the file.
 TL; DR -- the error above (with a file path and nothing after the proper-list-p is most likely an undefined macro hit during asynchronous compilation.

It could still be nice to attend something like a conference to learn some new skills and meet people.
 Does anyone know of conferences about Haskell or functional programming that are accessible for amateurs like me? Are you an amateur who has attended a conference? I'm curious to hear your thoughts and experiences.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Heya!
 Few days ago in an earlier thread I asked about any existing package for working with age encrypted files. Few folks pointed me in the right direction so I started working on this at https://codeberg.org/sochotnicky/age-mode
 The package is... experimental. There are a few known bugs (and many unknown I am sure). But things work in happy-path scenarios when you have correct identities defined and whatnot.
 I mostly copied over things from EPA package and adjusted for GPG->age differences (fortunately age is much simpler to work with). So when things are set up right you can get transparent age file decryption on file open and encryption on save. There's a few other accessory functions as well.
 Package needs some refactoring, more documentation, better error handling, support for different ways to specify recipients/identities, figuring out why editing over TRAMP saves unencrypted files and more. If someone feels like helping out I'd be happy to accept patches :-)
 I haven't really done that much elisp coding, but I've enjoyed the process so far. I am mostly just scratching my own itch here but who knows, it might help someone else...

 Flint is a YC company that's on a mission to fix American Healthcare by solving the nursing shortage crisis. We do this by removing barriers for international nurses to immigrate and build a career in the United States, and we are on track to help 1,000+ nurses immigrate by the end of next year (2023).
 We are growing quickly, and we need people to help us lay the foundation for our global healthcare workforce product. Our code is still young and you'd have a chance to leave your mark on the architecture.
 We're a distributed team and are considering candidates in the NA, SA, EMEA regions.
 If you're interested in this role, please apply here. Feel free to read more about our culture. You can also direct any questions to [wonchan@withflint.com](mailto:wonchan@withflint.com), thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I wanted to ask experienced emacs users on macos what their distro of choice is in late 2022. As a vimmer interested in emacs due to the vast customization capabilities and especially org-mode, I looked into trying it out for myself. It seemed as though the easiest way to get an idea of the potential of emacs was to install doom. I used the official guides on the repo and tried out both emacs-mac and emacs-plus with native comp. On my M1 macbook pro I experienced major cursor lag (when navigating through text files using vim bindings), they were so severe especially after coming from vim that i ended up removing doom entirely. Vanilla emacs didnt feel a 100% smooth either. Whats even weirder is that weeks after uninstalling emacs itself my computer still had a process running called emacs with 99% cpu useage and high gpu useage. After doing some digging, it seems that there are rendering issues on retina displays specifically that really mess up the responsiveness of the app. I read about different things to try such as using fira code as the font, changing the line highlighting behavior etc.
 ​
 Anyways, Before trying to fix something that seemed broken I want to try to install another build again, and I'd also be comfortable with vanilla emacs and configuring it on my own if it means stable performance. So what I want to know specifically is the following:
 In your opinion what are reliable distros and build options out of the following distros for M1 on a retina display in terms of responsiveness and light cpu/gpu useage?
 - emacs-mac
 - emacs-plus
 - emacsformacosx
 and would you ppl suggest with native comp or without?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Haskell FFI does not support directly passing structs in function definitions, but there is a way around it:
 Say foo and baz are structs. Given a function with signature
 bar fun1 (foo a, int b); 
 We can define a conversion that uses pointers instead:
 void wrapper (foo *a, int b, bar *out) { out* = (*a, b); } 
 Now say we have a different function defined as
 typedef bar (*cb) (foo a, int b); void fun2 (cb callback); 
 cb here can't be marshalled, just like fun1 in the first example, but now we need to wrap in the opposite direction: whatever C function we create has to input typedef bar* (*wrapped) (foo* a, int b) and output cb. This appears to be quite a non-trivial task within C. Is there a simpler solution to this I'm missing?

Though using all ten fingers to touch type, I notice the frequent use of the (left) control key to initiate/complete command chords strains my pinky; perhaps especially on a Thinkpad where the position of function key and Ctr are switched.
 While there are instructions how to remap C to an other key accessible with less crawl of the hand, I wonder: was remapping the function of the control key to an other key (e.g., caps lock) a technique frequently used prior to the advent of orgmode?

 I'm guessing the process would be; use Ubuntu Software to uninstall current Emacs, (perhaps delete the elpa Org directory and contents), then reinstall Emacs either using Ubuntu Software, or by sudo apt install.
 Any thoughts or recommendations much appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tweaking emacs with satisfication is not easy, but I am trying to think how it would work efficiently. The problem of the naive emacs keybindings is that it over relies on the ctrl key, default layout of modern computer keyboard makes it effort-some to do navigation. In my opinion, the alt (or meta) key should be paid more attention as we can balance between those two kinds.
 The first thing I found is that using arrow keys to navigate is fine, but not efficient, as its up and down arrow is not so coherent, and most of times we need rely on the thumb to hit the keys separately. While ctrl-n and ctrl-p can be an alternative to move around between lines, the same as alt-n and alt-p, for which I would suggest that using it as forward-paragraph and backward-paragraph. It can be smoother as oppose to the ctrl-<down> and ctrl-<up>, in the mean time, you can utilize the other combinations such as alt-f, alt-b to move forward word or backward. In that sense, alt key becomes a bold version of ctrl key, since it jumps fast and corresponds to every navigation key that ctrl has. We can therefore switch between those two modifier keys to move in a small pace or in a larger pace without intervening the arrow keys. At the same time, we can assign more combinations to the prefix key alt-s corresponding the ctrl-x. If we can stay mostly at the left region, the keystroke would be more efficient. If we can utilize those two kinds to the best, we can balance the left and right region, such as buffer navigation uses right hand-side alt-[ and alt-], and buffer switch uses alt-\.
 I also want to listen to your suggestions, as I believe everyone has their own opinions and configurations to make a balance, not be overloaded, while be efficient.
 Edit: I have remapped caps to ctrl.

 I have been maintaining the official Haskell docker images for about 2 years now. I have tried to push the project forward in various ways and I’m pleased with where they are now.
 There is more work to be done, such as Alpine and Windows support (both almost done, but blocked on GHC issues or need a final push).
 Unfortunately, I don’t have much time anymore for anything other than basic maintenance. Most of my time is taken up by my day job and my 8 month old. I also no longer work in Haskell, which lowers my motivation. I’d like to hand off maintenance, ideally to multiple new maintainers.
 Is anyone interested? If so, you can post here or on this github issue.

So if you're using Fourmolu and want to upgrade to GHC 9.4, wait no more! Also includes some quality of life improvements like not considering the leading space in a -- comment as part of the comment, and allowing multiline docs to be styled differently for modules than for functions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all. I'm brand new to Haskell, diving in for the first time using advent of code as an excuse to try and learn the language. I'm trying to go out of my way to "play", to get a better sense of how the language works. I don't think the specific problem is important in this case, but I have run into some counter-intuitive behavior. 
 My code reads inputs from a file, then does some simple computation (parse String -> Tuple, then "score" that tuple which is just Tuple -> Integer). Then I want to sum the scores. I first did this with a sum and a map, but then realized I could do it in a single fold. Code like this:
 main :: IO () main = do contents <- readFile "input02t" let input = lines contents -- This takes ~2 seconds to run print $ sum $ map (score . readEntry) input -- Same answer, but this takes ~10 seconds to run print $ foldr ((+) . score . readEntry) 0 input 
 The time difference shocked me, because I expected equivalence. Is there a reason the fold takes so much longer than sum + map?

 Now, what do I have in the dot emacs file? Here is the snippet, which kicks in while emacs initialize...FYI 
 (setq org2blog/wp-image-upload t)
 ..and it is not helping the cause. Most of my recent ( year or so) have written with it and none of them contain any media file. If those have, then I must go to the website and upload it manually. This is exactly what I want to bypass. 
 ​
 Am I missing the obvious?? Oh, what did I do to get it along with the text? This is the exact step I follow, on the blog body ....
 [[ file ~/some_arbitrary_image_file_name]] 
 I am sure, emacs told me something when it failed to upload the image along with blogs and I can't get it from the top of my head right now.
 PS: I can embed video url with no problem whatsoever and it works bloody well. 
 ​
 ..and those of you inclined to help me, I might point you to my frivolous dot emacs file, you might glean on it ,if it has some violation of the specific part . 
 Here it is for your perusal: Dot emacs file for your information

 Let me know if it is darn obfuscating to describe. TIA

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After experiencing how unholistic it feels configuring and extending VS Code, I started doing my research. I've tried Vim and Neovim more which has a fractured community. I question Vim's perceived efficiency with its keybindings and modal workflow but know it is universally available and quick to load.
 Testing Emacs for the first time opened my eyes and challenged what I thought I ever knew about it. The wealth of its built-in package manager with repos and extensibility is incredible. I thought it was all terminal focused but found out about the GUI and that a large majority of the community is using it. Now I am comfortable in the terminal but far from elite and have never tried a full terminal workflow. I'd like to hear from professional programmers and admins. What is your preferred choice?
 I want to know and grok the possibilities of using an editor inside a terminal, do you have more functionality, are you able to pipe things easier, etc. I know the benefits of the GUI in graphics and keybindings but is there feature loss or pain points when using something like vterm. Emacs is very flexible and there is many, many ways to complete work.
 In your opinion, should a person that wants to be the best programmer and admin possible focus on using GUI or Terminal Emacs? Thanks a million.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm a bit at a loss. I'm not that great with lisp and have been going through documentation for hours now.
 I saw that use-package supports directly customizing fonts through :custom-face which i would like to use to change some centaur tabs fonts. Before i did this "manually" with set-face-attribute. So far, i'm not getting errors, but my font also isn't getting applied. Additionally it seems things like :weight don't work here. So, could someone explain to me how this is done correctly?
 My current setup:
 (defvar PropFont) (setq PropFont "Inter") (use-package centaur-tabs :demand :straight t :init (centaur-tabs-mode t) :bind ("C-<prior>" . centaur-tabs-backward) ("C-<next>" . centaur-tabs-forward) :config (setq centaur-tabs-set-icons t) :custom (set-face-attribute 'centaur-tabs-selected-modified nil :family PropFont :weight 'bold :slant 'italic) (set-face-attribute 'centaur-tabs-unselected-modified nil :family PropFont :weight 'normal :slant 'italic) :custom-face (centaur-tabs-active-bar-face ((t (:family PropFont)))) (centaur-tabs-default ((t (:family PropFont)))) (centaur-tabs-selected ((t (:family PropFont)))) (centaur-tabs-unselected ((t (:family PropFont))))) 
 If you need more context i can put my entire init on pastebin or such, but this is all that's centaur tabs related.
 Any hint on what i'm doing wrong would be awesome.

What I'm looking for is basic IDE features (completion, inline error messages, docs on hover, etc), a REPL, and/or a debugger. Most people seem to recommend emacs, vim, or VS Code as their editor for Haskell. I'm not interested in using emacs or vim, so VS Code it is.
 I followed the recommendations on haskell.org and installed GHCup, and then using that installed GHC, cabal, stack, and the haskell language server, and then I installed the Haskell extension for VS Code. Then I noticed that extension doesn't seem to have a REPL or support for debugging, so I also installed the Haskell GHCi Debug Adapter extension.

 Example, js-indent-level value is 4. Eglot overwrite those 4 spaces with 1 <tab> making the indentation 8 spaces wide, which is Emacs default size.
 An option would be to set the default tab-size to 4. But I would rather having Eglot just using the indentation step defined in major-mode.
 Is there an option for this? I can't seem to find it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Background: I am relatively new to Emacs, and in org-mode in particular. Just this week I started using org-mode to prepare my papers, assignments, laboratory reports, etc. My only trouble is the exported tables to PDF.
 If the table have three columns with just short entries, I have no problem. But when the entries inside the table is long, the table extends to the right (outside the margin) of the page.
 Example:
 | Sequence | Score | Position | Remarks | |----------------------+-------+----------+--------------------------------------------------------------------| | TGCCGGCACCACCGCGTGTA | 97 | 1258 | This is a long text describing this sequence and another text here | | CGCGTGTAGGGCGGAGTAAA | 89 | 856 | Another long text in this second row of table | | CGGCACCACCGCGTGTAGGG | 91 | 21 | Another remark | 
 In the header I have this:
 #+title: Sample Paper in Org #+subtitle: Paper Presentation #+author: Some One #+latex_header: \usepackage[a4paper,text={6.25in,9in}, truedimen]{geometry} 
 I tried reading the org-mode manual but I couldn't figure it out how to make my table look nice.
 I did something like this:
 #+ATTR_LATEX: :environment tabu | Sequence | Score | Position | Remarks | |----------------------+-------+----------+--------------------------------------------------------------------| | TGCCGGCACCACCGCGTGTA | 97 | 1258 | This is a long text describing this sequence and another text here | | CGCGTGTAGGGCGGAGTAAA | 89 | 856 | Another long text in this second row of table | | CGGCACCACCGCGTGTAGGG | 91 | 21 | Another remark | 
 and in the header I add: #+latex_header: \usepackage{tabu}.
 The result is the same:

 Is there any way how can I fix this?

 EDIT: I invoke the M-x org-pandoc-export-to-latex-pdf keybindings to generate the PDF.
 EDIT: By the way, I am using Doom Emacs.

 After marking DONE, I archive the task/projects to a single archive2022.org file. My main objective for maintaining an archive is for generating clocktables and analyze time spent with each customer, which task/projects took me the most time, etc., and eventually bill that time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm putting the finishing touches on my second "real" Haskell project*, and now that I find myself (mostly) able to get some (simple, practical) stuff done with the language, I'd like to spend some time learning more about how to put types to work.
 I mostly-get some of the basic big ideas: make invalid states un-representable, e.g. Use a type that encodes your constraints in some way (like NonEmpty!). I found lots of good advice in this blog post, and several others by the same author. (I tried to put it to work in my own code, restricting the domain of a finicky function, which felt like a nice, if small, win.)
 Anyway, I feel like I'm still only scratching the surface. Reading posts like this or the "types" section in the "State of the Haskell ecosystem" gets me really excited, but doesn't leave me with much in the way of practical advice.
 Are there are good/recommended resources for digging deeper into this kind of stuff? I stumbled across Thinking with Types today, which seems like it could be a good fit. I also see there's a chapter on "Basic Type Level Programming" in Production Haskell. I've also found various blogs and reddit posts, of course, but nothing super-comprehensive. (And "Type-driven development" sounds cool, but I'm not ready to branch into Idris yet.)
 I'd love any recommendations, pointers, tips-and-tricks... whatever you've got to offer! Thanks!
 ​
 \Any feedback is welcome, by the way, if anybody feels like digging through beginner code. It feels weird to work/learn in a vacuum. Looking at it now I already see some deficiencies, but I'm sure there are plenty that I don't see...*

 I cloned the git repo from https://git.savannah.gnu.org/git/emacs.git and tried to build it with make configure="--with-native-compilation". It dies when it tested out to see if JIT was working. I followed the instructions, downloaded the sample program, compiled it with gcc -I/opt/homebrew/include tut01-hello-world.c -o tut01-hello-world -lgccjit -L/opt/homebrew/lib/gcc/12 and then tried to execute the result but I got:  ./tut01-hello-world ld: library not found for -lemutls_w libgccjit.so: error: error invoking gcc driver NULL result% 
 I see I have /opt/homebrew/Cellar/gcc/12.2.0/lib/gcc/current/gcc/aarch64-apple-darwin21/12/libemutls_w.a and a symbolic link to it at /opt/homebrew/lib/gcc/current/gcc/aarch64-apple-darwin21/12/libemutls_w.a but I don't know how to alter the library search path on macOS and I'm not sure if that is the way way to address this issue or if I'm doing something wrong more fundamentally.

 I've looked around but so far haven't found any package that would provide support for working with Age-encrypted files: https://github.com/FiloSottile/age
 I am strongly considering just writing some helper methods etc. I see some potential problems. For example ideally I'd love to have an editing support where I open age encrypted file, it gets unencrypted in the buffer and reencrypted on save, but not sure it is possible to easily re-encrypt file to the same recipients (without hardcoding a list in code/variable)
 Anyway - thought I'd ask if there's anything that already exists by any chance and I just missed it (age is not exactly a searchable term).

 import Data.Constraint (Constraint, Dict (..), type (:-) (..)) type family All :: (k -> Constraint) -> [k] -> Constraint type family All c xs where All _ '[] = () All c (x ': xs) = (c x, All c xs) 
 However, GHC is unable to figure out the following:
 type T :: [Type] -> Type foo :: All Monoid r => T r -> Bool bar :: All Semigroup r => T r -> Bool baz :: All Monoid r => T r -> Bool baz t = foo t && bar t -- This is an error: cannot deduce `All Semigroup r` from `All Monoid r` -- The workaround solution is to change the type of `baz` to baz :: (All Monoid r, All Semigroup r) => T r -> Bool -- but this is pretty annoying and cumbersome -- `All Monoid r` does imply `All Semigroup r`, I just need to prove it to GHC 
 One solution is to write a function with the type below, however I have no clue how to go about it
 -- | Map a constraint implication across a type-level list mapImpl :: (forall a. c1 a :- c2 a) -> All c1 r :- All c2 r mapImpl = Sub Dict -- ERROR 
 Is this possible? Or would some implementation require additional class constraints on r. Any help would be appreciated!

I got a really nice development environment for RJSX and as a matter of fact, I would still be using that as my main editing suite for RJSX and using it professionally but I have to admit. I have spent around 3 months with Doom Emacs now and in that time I also started following along system crafters videos to build my own config but I have to say that unfortunately, I'm a person that switches often between a lot of different languages and platforms and tools. 
 e.g. While I'm working as a freelancer in RJSX I also develop blender plugins and I'm also learning unreal engine 5 and WebGL on the side.
 For someone like me, I was finding that I'd have to spend 3-4 days dedicatedly crafting an environment for every new requirement I have. I do a lot of different minor development-related things and this was really killing my will to work. 
 But, emacs did force me to learn evil mode for editing and I have to say I'd always use that till the day I die now. I cannot imagine how I didn't. I also added a magit plugin and an org mode plugin on vscode and also using the vspacecode plugin for spacemacs like keybindings now. 
 My affair with emacs would definitely continue for a long time, I'm sure. But unfortunately, the barrier of entry is rather high for someone like me who wants to do a lot of things and honestly for the time being I'd have to hop back to VSCode to edit a lot of different things. I am a little disappointed but still hopeful that I'd be back some time.

 I want to create a one line function "argmax" using fold where I enter an anonymous/lambda function and a list. Then I apply the function to the list and get a new list based on the function. Now I get the maximum value of the second list and return the element from the first list which created the maximum value when applied to the function.
 It should look like this:
 Input: argmax (\x -> mod x 5) [1,4,7]
 the second list should be: [1,4,2]
 The Maximum element from the second list is 4 so it should return 4 from the first list, because mod 4 5 is 4.
 So the output should be: 4
 Currently I have this:
 argmax :: (Ord a) => a -> [a] -> a
 argmax f xs = foldr max f xs
 but it doesnt work for a anonymous function
 I get this error: No instance for (Show (Integer -> Integer))
 which I don't really understand.
 I tried to change the type signature, but that did not help.
 thanks in advance! ^

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am trying to write a One line function where you enter a number and a List, and it returns the highest value.
 For example:
 Input: getMax 5 [1,4,7] 
 Output: 7
 Here is my current code:
 getMax :: (Ord a) => a -> [a] -> a getMax f xs = foldr max f xs 
 Now I want to extend my function so that instead of a number I can enter a Lamda function to be compared.
 For example:
 Input: getMax (\x -> mod x 5) [1,4,7] 
 Output: 4
 But I cannot get it to work.
 I get an error message:
 No instance for (Show (Integer -> Integer)) 
 which I don't really understand.
 I tried to change the type signature, but that did not help.
 thanks in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I'm using the "olivetti" package with a line width of 80 characters (olivetti-body-width 80). The text is centered. This setting works fine for a fixed-pitch font. However, when I'm using a variable-pitch font such as Times New Roman, the 80 characters per line allow up to 100 characters per line to fit. This is due to the nature of variable-pitch fonts where characters are not equal in width like monospaced fonts.
 100 characters per line is too long for optimal reading and increasing the font size doesn't help. The font is already at a large size. 
 What would be the solution? To reduce the olivetti 80 characters per line setting to 70 characters per line which will compensate for the variable pitch font? But that will cause the programming modes that use a fixed-pitch font to have short lines.

 narrow to a certain subset of them (say 5 or so)
 sort them according to a date on one of the props
 list them in column view
  
taken a couple shots at this as well as searching on things like org-collector but not really finding an easy way to do this (which makes org-mode look way harded than obsidian where I did this with dataview pretty simply)
 Anyone got any pointers to something similar or an example. My lisp-fu is weak (looks down at floor) so thought I'd ask for help rather than thrash here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello!
 Can an ordinary person with no background in programming or computer science, learn Haskell by themselves? Would it be complicated? I do know that Haskell may not be the most ideal choice for beginner programming since it's quite complicated, especially considering it uses lambda calculus.. 
 I'd appreciate any suggestions!

our perspective on familiar objects. Such ideas can help tame the complexity of
abstruse abstractions by offering a more intuitive angle from which to
understand them.
The aim of this post is to present an alternative angle — that of interactive
semantics — from which to view one of the fundamental notion of functional
programming: higher-order functions.
Interactive semantics provide an intuitive understanding of the concept of
higher-order functions, which is a worthy mathematical investigation in itself.
But this approach is also practical, shedding a new light on existing
programming techniques and programming language features. We will review the
example of higher-order contracts in this post. We will also p…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to create a function where it adds the total char count of a list. For example, an input of testLength ["test", "string"] should return [4, 10] since the test has 4 letters and string has 6, but it gets added to the 4. An input with 3 elements would add all 3 of them together on the 3rd and so on. I currently have:
 testLength :: [String] -> [Int] testLength ss = [length s | s <- ss] 
 Using the previous example, this returns [4, 6] because it does not add in the 4. I know I need addition somewhere but Haskell isn't very nice when it comes to creating variables within functions to hold a value so I am not sure how to keep the 4 in order to add it to the 6.

 This does not seem like the way. 
 How should it be used and if this is a feature is there another package which might be worth trying?

 function1 :: monadState Int m => String -> m String 
 I know that String would be the input and that m String is supposed to be the output, but how would that be formatted? Also, does the monadState Int m have any interference with the input string? To further the example, if funtion1 were to be a function where it counts words in a string and returns the string with the count, would be as simple as having the format as something like:
 funtion1 s = s ++ m 
 or is there some monad stuff to worry about? Obviously somewhere in function1 would be the actual code to count the words in the string. Thanks!

It’s important to understand the layers that make up a design, because getting those layers to work together is the key to creating designs that look good, that solve problems, and that ultimately influence your users.


For the Zettel, should I always start it with "According to [so and so]...", or should I just omit that and essentially present the idea as my own? And if I come across another source that slightly expands on this, how should I express that? And how should I deal with a source contradicting this information?]]></summary>

 should I walk away as they are not the right target user ? ( but it's a niche market, there isn't much user , should I just give up on them ?)

 When I'm editing a big org-mode file sometimes I mistype an extra bracket somewhere and emacs freezes. This started happening just after I enabled smartparens' pair highlighting using
 (show-smartparens-global-mode +1) in my ~/.doom.d/config.el file,
 so it's pretty clear its because of it scanning the whole buffer looking for the matching bracket to highlight.
 Is there a variable I can set to give a line / chars / milliseconds roof to this?
 Thank you all.
 UPDATE: I just realized it is not about the highlighting itself, but smartparents in general.
 I toggled show-smartparents-global-more, I had no highligting but the freezing happened anyway.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Coming from Scala, the `Every` type seems to be much more coherent. In Purescript it seems like I am forever having to change between the two types to leverage basic functionality.
 For example I feel like I'm doing crazy stuff like the following code. I've got a `NonEmptyArray` but the only way to add a new value seems to be to convert back to `Array` use the `cons` infix operator, then convert back to NonEmptyArray....
 Pretty sure I'm doing something wrong here...But this difficulty in usage combined with the `NonEmpty Array` vs `NonEmptyArray` types got be confused. Has anyone got a solid undestanding?

 FOSDEM 2023 will be held on 4 & 5 February 2023, in Brussels. For more information see the official site. The Haskell devroom (specialist track) will take place on Sunday 5 February, from 13:10 to 17:00 UTC+1.
 We need more proposals! We need your help!
 This is an amazing opportunity to promote Haskell, and functional programming generally, to a legion of free software developers and enthusiasts. But right now, we are not even close to filling our schedule. If we don't fill our ~4 hour schedule, the Haskell devroom will not happen.
 Therefore we are extending our Call for Proposals until Saturday 2022-12-10. We are also now welcoming proposals for tutorials/workshops and longer presentations (up to 45 minutes). Shorter presentations are still welcome, of course.
 So if you want to propose an introductory workshop, install fest, hack session, or something similar, have at it.
 You can also help by sharing this CFP far and wide, and with specific people you think might have something interesting to present.
 Thanks,
 Fraser Tweedale

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I enable the three modes in the title, moving up and down with the arrow keys places the cursor in the wrong column when on a line with substituted symbols. The offset seems to be related to the org-indent depth.
 I've searched and searched but have not found a solution other than disabling one of the three modes.
 Here's a minimal repro. Anyone dealt with this in their config or have advice on how to hunt down the problem? I'm not even sure which project to make a bug report in.
 (use-package org :mode (("\\.org$" . org-mode)) :ensure org-plus-contrib :hook ((org-mode . org-indent-mode) (org-mode . visual-line-mode)) ; alternatively, comment the following lines and uncomment org-modern :config (add-to-list 'font-lock-extra-managed-props 'display) (font-lock-add-keywords 'org-mode '(("^\\(-\\)\\( \\)" 1 '(face nil display "•")))) ) ; (use-package org-modern ; :ensure t ; :after org ; :hook ((org-mode . (lambda () (org-modern-mode))))) 
 Try on this file. When the cursor is on item 1 (which has a prettified bullet), moving down to item 2, then up again places the cursor 2 to the right of where it was before.

 Curious what people think about this. I know there've been many a blog posts on how to improve this, but I have yet to see any writings on this specific approach. IMO this approach gets us a lot more type safety at the expense of a bit more verbosity.
 Currently not on Hackage yet, since it's still in the prototyping phase, but if there's interest, there could certainly be an organized effort to get a full library on Hackage, get it used in production, and even possibly open a GHC proposal to merge into base (more details in README).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm a Vim user who is trying to migrate to emacs. On Vim, I've been using the following function to execute code:
 ``` function! ExecuteOnTerminal(type) range if (&ft=='bash' || &ft=='sh') if a:type == "V" :vert botright '<,'> %terminal bash else :vert botright %terminal bash endif elseif (&ft=='python') if a:type == "V" :vert botright '<,'> %terminal python3 else :vert botright %terminal python3 endif elseif (&ft=='awk') if a:type == "V" '<,'>w! /tmp/file.awk else :w! /tmp/file.awk endif :vert botright terminal awk -f /tmp/file.awk /home/user/sampleFile endif endfunction
 vnoremap <silent> <F10> :call ExecuteOnTerminal("V")<CR> nnoremap <silent> <F10> :call ExecuteOnTerminal("I")<CR> ```
 Basically, it detects if I'm selecting lines or not. If I press F10, it'll execute the selected lines or the entire file depending on the type of the file. I'd like to create a similar function on emacs. I know that for that I'd need:
  
A function that detects the language of the file like &ft does on vimscript.
 A way of detecting if I'm selecting lines or not on the current file and getting the content of it.
 Something like the terminal command from vim, it executes the code on a split window.
  
I'd like to create my own personalized function because I end up having more control of what's happening, like the last elseif that I'm executing awk code with the data of a hardcoded file. This way I can handle multiple types of files with a single shortcut... But I'm having trouble finding equivalent elisp functions for the three points that I've listed here. Can anyone help me on that? Or give me some advice for executing code on emacs (not org files, just plain scripts .py, .sh, .bash, .js and so on)?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone ! 
 I recently had to update my system and since then I've noticed something odd with pyright. When I open a project and my lsp server starts with pyright, the file I first opened to open the project doesn't work well. I don't get the usual autocompletion, the errors listed by flycheck all appear in the first in the first lines and don't get removed if i correct the acutal error, ....
 And this only happens in the very first file which started the server ! On top of that I've also noticed that it only happens when I have more than one listed lsp workspace folder using pyright.
 My current workaround is to kill the buffer and reopen the file again but it would beetter if I could get rid of it entirely.
 I use doom emacs with pyright and lsp and I also use pyenv for my virtualenvs with the pyenv package which allows emacs to automatically detect the local version I set for a project and use it. 
 It's very weird and I have a hard time finding the root of the problem so if someone had a similar issue at some point or as any clue on what to do it would be very much appreciated !

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In my version of Org, inline code interacts weirdly with quotation marks. If I write something like
 ~"foo"~ bar ~baz~ 
 Then the entire line will be rendered as inline code, whereas I'd expect just "foo" and baz to be rendered that way.
 Weirdly, this only happens with code, not with any other type of emphasis marker.
 My Google-fu doesn't seem to be working here; I found this Stack Overflow post, it's completely unrelated AFAICT (for one thing, if org-emphasis-alist were the problem, then all types of emphasis markers should be affected).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As an exercise in learning Lisp, I am trying to write a pattern
 matching routine that I can call
 like (match pattern form) where both pattern and form are just
 forms. My ultimate goal is to perform tree-manipulations via structural editing and macroexpansion of lisp forms, where after the manipulation, I am left with a lisp form that evaluates to something useful. Because working with code is a macro's domain, I thought using them would be the most natural way forward. However,
 due to the recursive nature of the problem, I need to call match
 from within itself to see if a sub-pattern successfully matched
 a sub-form. This leads to write things like (eval \(match`
 ,sub-pattern ,sub-form)) inside the macro. This feels like an
 ugly hack, but the alternative would be to use functions and
 quote
 every input, leading to (match \(quote ,sub-pattern) `(quote`
 ,sub-form)) . Both of these make me feel like I am doing
 something wrong, surely there is a clean, lispy way of doing
 this. Is there an idiomatic way to write the routine? Should
 this be a task for functions or macros?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all -- I'm attempting to write a basic, type-directed program synthesis application using the ghc library. One issue I have run into is in comparing the types of arguments in polymorphic functions. 
 I would like to be able to take a function of type, say, `Identity a -> b` and compare the first argument for equality with a known type `Identity a`. I would like to use the `eqType` function in GHC.Core.Type, but I don't know how to correctly separate the function type to do so.
 There are helper functions like `splitFunTy_maybe`, but that cannot be directly applied to my function type since it is wrapped in a `Forall` type constructor. My (very hacky) solution right now involves stripping the `Forall` constructor, splitting the bare function, then comparing the two types on their type constructors (in this case, `Identity`).
 I'm wondering if there's a better way to go about this, because I'm having trouble extending my current solution to broader applications. Any help from ghc wizards would be greatly appreciated!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to finally learn a bit more Haskell than my current smattering. In fact, I'm going to try the Advent of Code in it, as a forcing function.
 I'm trying to get a better handle on performance. For example, I really don't understand why the foldl' implementation in Data.List,
  foldl' :: (b -> a -> b) -> b -> t a -> b {-# INLINE foldl' #-} foldl' f z0 = \ xs -> foldr (\ (x::a) (k::b->b) -> oneShot (\ (z::b) -> z `seq` k (f z x))) (id::b->b) xs z0 
 works so much better in GHCi than my naive implementation,
  foldl' f !z [] = z foldl' f !z (x:xs) = foldl' f (f z x) xs 
 Sure, that one is better than just using foldl or foldr, but it still takes about 2 s in GHCi or runghc to sum 1 to 10M. Compiled, it takes 0.2 s (reasonable), but plain-vanilla Python or Scheme (guile) only take about 0.5 s.
 The Data.List implementation takes about 0.5 s, much more in line with what I expect a reasonable interpreter to do, but I don't understand how it does it.
 Can someone walk me through it? I'd like to figure out how to make things run quickly in GHCi for while I'm going through Advent of Code problems. More generally, how should I think about performance?
 (And yes, I've read the comment in the code, but I didn't understand it.)
 Edit: In particular, if someone could help walk me through the comment in https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.17.0.0/docs/src/GHC.List.html#foldl%27, I'd appreciate it.

 I expect each time I hit Tab to have the same number of spaces inserted (if I describe-variable tab-width, it is 2). Any ideas why the first Tab inserts FOUR spaces instead of two?
 When searching for answers to this issue, other people mention separate variables such as js-indent-level, c-basic-offset, etc. But I am seeing this issue in plaintext, so I'm not sure what corresponding variable might make sense here?

 It turns out Marginalia is the which-key equivalent for Vertico.
 ORIGINAL POST FOLLOWS:
 Howdy! I'm trying to use vertico, but I noticed which-key no longer shows the keys for things when I use M-x. It still works with other keybinds, like C-x. Is there a way to make this work again?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was working on a large project and using lots of make, make clean, configure and other commands that triggered large streams of output in my shell. It was getting hard to keep track of which output came from which input.
 So I came up with this solution: it makes a 'sticky' header that always shows the prompt corresponding to the top-visible output-line (hard to explain but see screenshots for reference)
 (defun comint-get-prompt-above () "Get the prompt above the top visible line in the current window." (interactive) (save-excursion (goto-char (window-start)) (comint-previous-prompt 1) (let ((prompt (thing-at-point 'line))) (aset prompt (- (length prompt) 1) 0) ; remove the newline ending char prompt))) (define-minor-mode comint-sticky-mode "Minor mode to show the previous prompt as a sticky header." :group 'comint :global nil :lighter nil (if comint-sticky-mode (setq-local header-line-format (list '(:eval (comint-get-prompt-above)))) (setq-local header-line-format nil))) 
 Sharing here because:
  
I'd like some feedback on my solution.
 Code-wise I'm wondering if there is a more efficient solution, maybe without calling comint-next-prompt
 I figured other people might find this feature useful: feel free to paste it in your config and let me know your experience.
 If people are interested, I'm wondering if I should create a package for this.
 On the one hand I'd like the feature to be available to whoever wants it. But also it's such a small piece of code that maybe just sharing it as a snippet is enough. Unless there are possible enhancements, or additional related features that might go well with this?

 Looks like this whole journey started in May when Daniel suggested Vertico replace Selectrum. selectrum#598 The amount of humility and civility displayed by both Radon and Daniel has been inspiring—not something you see often in the software world.
 My journey has been Helm → Ivy → Selectrum → Vertico, and I can confidently say that Vertico has been the fastest, most reliable, and least buggy of them all. Thank you to all you Emacs package maintainers, but especially Radon and Daniel for working so hard to make lightweight completion the best it could be!

 I want to automate the creation of a new denote journal file each day. I want to verify if it already exists, if not create it and then find the previous journal, check if there are TODO/SCHEDULED/DEADLINE tasks and move them into the new journal.
 For now I have the following:
 (require 'cl-lib) ;; needed for cl-return (defun journal-day-exists-p ( target ) "check if journal for a day already exists" (file-expand-wildcards (concat (denote-directory) target "*_journal*.org"))) (defun find-previous-journal () "Find most recent journal" (let* ((today (format-time-string "%Y%m%d")) (all_journals (sort (directory-files "~/Dropbox/orgfiles/denotes" nil "^[0-9].*_journal.*org$") #'string>))) (dolist (journal all_journals) (when (string< (substring journal 0 8) today) (cl-return journal))))) (defun my-denote-journal () "Create an entry tagged 'journal' with the date as its title." (interactive) (let* ((today (format-time-string "%Y%m%d")) (filename (car (journal-day-exists-p today))) (prev (find-previous-journal))) (if filename (find-file filename) (progn (denote (format-time-string "%A %e %B %Y") ; format like Tuesday 14 June 2022 '("journal") nil "~/Denotes") (insert "* Thoughts\n\n* Ideas\n\n* Code\n\n* TASKS\n\n"))))) 
 Now the part where I need help is in moving the Tasks, I already have the idea that I should use org-refile or org-archive, but I am not seeing how to open the previous file and get what I need from it.
 Can anyone help?
 ​
 Thank you!

 Tramp, while sometimes usable, has poor performance and I've found it to hang during many different operations. It's not easy to debug when things go wrong, and it seems as though it's just a product of old, single threaded code that does not compete with better ideas on remote code editing - a la VSCode's remote server.
 Will we ever see Emacs embrace an over the network client/server split and make remote code editing a first class feature like VSCode?

However, sometimes I do not even see this message because eg. a minor-mode has actions attached which uses the minibuffer. The recovery-hint message then get's quickly buried.
 Instead I would rather have to actively take an action like use the auto-save file, ignore it, delete it, merge it ... 
 Can I configure such a behavior?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I have two questions regarding validation cases that come up frequently in my Scala codebase.
 1. Multistage validation
 I would like to break down the validation into several stages. Errors from each stage should be accumulated into the "final list of errors", and a validation stage should only run on data that was successfully validated by the previous stage. In other words: each stage should return a list of validation errors along with the data that passed the validations of that stage. In addition most stages require IO to pull some data needed for the actual validation. An example using 2 stages:
 case class ValidationStatus[E]( errors: List[E], leftForValidation: List[Unvalidated] ) sealed trait Errors1 def validationStage1(values: NonEmptyList[Unvalidated]): IO[ValidationStatus…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Wanted to share another note, but the book didn't have usable endnotes, so I found myself writing about a prerequisite to making good endnotes instead.
I found the direct access/sequential access distinction interesting when I thought of how RAM works; but maybe I've stretched it too thin? In a blog post I'd remove the last subsection, but for my private cesspool I'm inclined to keep it 
202211261601 Endnotes require direct access via chapter marks
  #endnote #usability
To make book endnotes as usable as footnotes, each page or page spread needs to show all relevant information the reader requires to find the appropriate endnote.
Paperback endnotes are usually not optimized for "direct access" (aka "random access" as in computer RAM[[202211281004]]): Endnotes are often counted from 1 on a chapter-by-chapter basis. Then the endnotes of a book will be sectioned by chapter.
Usability problem
Non-fiction paperback books usually only print the author and book title at the top of pages, so you don't have an easy way to know which chapter you're in.
Example usage of bad endnotes
If you're on page X and want to know what endnote Y is about, you need to page back until you find the beginning of the chapter, or look up the chapter's page range in the table of contents first. Then you can navigate to the approriate section in the endnotes.
Random access vs bad sequential access
"Random/direct access" would be possible if one of the page headers contained the current chapter title to make finding the appropriate section in the endnotes easier. Then you'd have all the information, the complete address, to de-reference the number Y.
If you page through the book, and simultaneously advance the endnote sections and leave a bookmark there, you would get "sequential access" that relies on a process like this.]]></summary>

 On macOS, you can do C-h in any text field to do backspace, which is nice and ergonomic to me, so I've got in the habit of using this key combination instead of the backspace key.
 In Emacs, I know C-h is bound to help. But in INSERT MODE, I would like to have C-h behave as backspace instead.
 I have tried putting the following into my user-config, but it seems to basically turn C-h into a NOP instead. Any ideas what I'm doing wrong here?

 When pulling in citations from sites like Google scholar there’s no option for biblatex, and I can’t just mix styles together.
 Certain fields (like date vs year/month) need to be combined and transformed, and some TeX syntax is removed, so it’s slightly nontrivial. I can make a call to Biber as an external process to do the conversion but it’s slow (around 2 seconds).
 I’m avoiding using Zotero or Jabref etc as I’m nearly finished implementing a system that totally replaces them.
 Thanks!

 In a function, I use the following to jump to a specific heading (below, the heading would be named "Example" in the above file):
 (re-search-forward (concat "^\\* " "Example" "$") nil t) 
 And from there I can insert a property with org-set-property for that heading.
 Everything works very well for my needs, but I kind of feel like there is probably a built-in function that does what my re-search-forward line does but in a more elegant way. However, I can't find such a built-in function. Is there one?

 Sometimes I fallback to C-x 8 RET.
 I use ipa-x-sampa for IPA and seems it is a /wˈaɪdspɹəd stˈændɚd/... 
 For arrows I attempted to use TeX input method but I'm not a Latex guy, too lengthy to remember & type.
 I wander if rfc1345 is popular, arrows are simple: &-> or &<=. or other math stuff: &(C ⊂, &(I 〖, &(U ∩, &(_ ⊆, &+- ±, &!= ≠, &14 ¼, &FA ∀, &TE ∃.

I recently updated to Emacs 28.2 on two machines and though the native compiler is working when I run it manually, it doesn't seem to be running automatically on packages I install with package.el nor on some personal libraries. The rest of this post has whatever details I think I might get asked about, but probably excludes some necessary details which, due to my ignorance, I don't realize are necessary! :)
 I do now have native compilation in both installations, and for built-in functions describe-function says "... is a native-compiled Lisp functions in ...". If I manually call emacs-lisp-native-compile-and-load on a file, it does get compiled to native code, the corresponding .eln file gets placed in .emacs.d/eln-cache/28.2-7…]]></summary>

Because while in theory the concept sounds awesome, I don't get the way it was implemented. And I was already close to filing a bug report for this issue that then turned out to be "intended behavior".
  
The other day I ran into the situation that I had two type aliases that both mapped to Lists of something. Then I wanted to implement an extension method on both of these types with the same signature.  type A = List[Int] type B = List[String] extension (a: A) { def doSomething: Unit = ??? } extension (b: B) { def doSomething: Unit = ??? }  But the compiler refused to do that because of the methods being identical after type erasure. Okay, I get that.
 But before I proceed with the core story here,…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello wizards, I've got a weird one today.
 I'm trying to write a small package which re-defines eshell/cat. I'm doing this with
 (defun eshell/cat (&rest args) "doc string" (do-various-things-to args)) 
 Before loading this file, which cat returns "eshell/cat is a byte-compiled Lisp function in 'em-unix.el'." 
 But after loading the file, which cat returns "/usr/bin/cat".
 Now I can manually invoke my new function with eshell/cat, but it should be callable as just cat. Everything I've seen online indicates that defining eshell/<cmd> exposes <cmd> as an eshell command, as does the built-in Info manual. 
 This issue occurs whenever I start eshell and then load the file. When I load the file first, eshell's init sequence clobbers it and restores the definition from em-unix.el.
 What is the correct way to do this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've read a lot of resources about Zettelkasten, and there are many things I'd like to address, but this post is about prefix ID for notes. Ok, I don't understand why you would use the popular timestamp thing. Sure, you know when the note was created, and you fixed the issue with duplicate titles (which, really, who experiences?) Other than that, what? Then you have this unclean 12-digit number in front of your note title; amazing.
I've been trying to use Luhmann's 1,2,3b,3c etc., system, which works fine, but there is no convenient way to use it (I am using Obsidian). I used this 12-digit timestamp on hundreds of notes, and it's simply useless. I need something else!
Yes, I researched other solutions, but they were not convincing and too geeky, as I recall. I wonder if someone had the same experience as me. The 12-digit timestamp prefix is missing the point of the Zettelkasten, IMO. I'm looking for alternatives and am eager to listen to others' experiences with ID prefixes methods for Zettelkasten. Thanks!]]></summary>

Though he indicates it was a "process [he] developed", it is broadly similar to that of the influential "historical method" laid out by Ernst Bernheim and later Seignobos/Langlois in the late 1800s.

 This seems very un-haskelly to me. Why is this the case, that errors are not handled with `Either`? Also, how can I handle these errors? I thought there is no such thing as a `try...catch` in haskell, but maybe I'm mistaken?

 The discussion is here: https://codeberg.org/martianh/mastodon.el/issues/285
 In short, the following works, but the fallback value of 12:00 a.m. feels like a hack:
 (require 'org) (require 'mastodon) (defun ct/mastodon-toot--schedule () (interactive) (let* ((time-value (org-read-date nil t nil "Schedule post at:" (date-to-time "2022-11-26 00:00 am"))) (iso8601-string (format-time-string "%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S%z" time-value))) (setq-local mastodon-toot--scheduled-at iso8601-string) (message (format "Scheduled post for '%s'." iso8601-string)))) (define-key mastodon-toot-mode-map (kbd "C-c C-s") #'ct/mastodon-toot--schedule) 
 org-read-date works flawlessly otherwise.
 How'd you approach this?

Specifically, if you scroll down to the comment made by 147pm, they say an obvious omission, i.e., that you don't get set union commutativity when you use lists as sets -- despite clever attempts to get rid of "duplicates." But then a comment below says very deep things about quotient type and commutative modulo permutations. I was wondering if someone could unpack that a bit. What's he saying about, against the 147pm comment? Can someone direct me to resources/texts that might get into this? Once again, Haskell amazes. What other language has this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm using Emacs 27. I can activate hs-minor-mode in each buffer manually via M-x hs-minor-mode. No problem here.
 But I want to have that mode for python mode only. And that doesn't work. I got no error but when I try to fold python code I got the regular message that I have to "Enable one of the following modes...".
 This is the python part of my init.el where I use the :init part.
  (use-package python :ensure nil ; in-build! :init (add-hook 'python-mode-hook 'hs-minor-mode) :hook (python-mode . eglot-ensure) :custom (python-shell-interpreter "python3") ) 
 I also tried it that way using the :hook part.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have the font installed on my PC, and it works well with other terminals such as Alacritty, but when I open my shell via the shell-mode the prompt is not displayed correctly.
 This is the view of the prompt in shell-mode, it can't display the icons.
 Edit:
 After searching Emacs documentation, I came across chapter 14.19 How Text Is Displayed, and was able to kind of pinpoint what the issue is:
  
On text terminals, characters that cannot be displayed using the terminal encoding are normally displayed as question signs. 
  
And from chapter 22.12 Coding Systems for Terminal I/O:
  
The command C-x RET t (set-terminal-coding-system) specifies the coding system for terminal output. If you specify a character code for terminal output, all characters output to the terminal are translated into that coding system.
  
I have changed the value of this command and changed the encoding to UTF-8 but still got no result.
 This is all that I have concluded, I am still an Emacs newbie, but I am trying to learn.

 Basically, I want to customize what "SPC c c" does per mode, since usually I want to run an elisp command, not a command line program. So in LaTeX, I want "SPC c c" to do #'TeX-command-run-all, but not in other modes.
 Is there a way to do this? I tried the following but it didn't seem to work

 This warning seems to be at the heart of the problem

One of my purposes in starting a ZK was to capture brief memories or "snapshots" of my past, with a focus partly on what happened and partly on how I felt (at the time) or feel (now) about that event.  I don't pursue this in any organized way, either in relation to time or theme.  I simply deal with memories as they arise, prompted by a discussion with a friend or family member, or from looking at a photo.  The order is thus random. But I hoped that as I gathered a large number of brief memories and connected them together, they would form a somewhat coherent personal history that was also intimately tied to other zettels, such as those expressing personal values and beliefs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to create a group in ibuffer that will include various buffers matching different regular expressions. Below is a simplified version of my current attempt:
 (defun my-agenda-group () (or (string-match-p "^\\*Org-Agenda\\*.*" (buffer-name)) (string-match-p ".org\\'" buffer-file-name))) (setq ibuffer-saved-filter-groups (quote (("Default" ("Agenda" (predicate . (my-agenda-group))))))) 
 If I understand correctly, ibuffer will apply my-agenda-group to every buffer, and will display that buffer under "Agenda" if the function returns non-nil for the buffer. I have called that function inside various buffers myself to check manually that it works correctly. However, this same function does not work within ibuffer-saved-filter-groups and I am unable to figure out why.

 As result, I start searching I stumble on: 1. textobjec config from doom emacs. 2. Traget.el 3. evil-textobj-tree-sitter.el 4. Objed.el 
 However, it is confusing with all these packages and for newbie the difference is hard to understand. All I want is to select text, line, sentence, paragraph, block, text between tags, functions etc.
 My initial thought is that the 3rd options seems interesting but I think it doesn't support org syntax and I can't select lines, paragraphs with it.
 P.s: I use evil 🙈

        <updated>2022-11-25T03:27:48.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you're wondering why, well, just to reduce my dependency cone and possibly build times. No deeper reasons.
 Replaced sbt-assembly with sbt-native-packager's dist command to build a zip file. Unzipped that. Then added the resulting directory into my Docker image. The image now has everything needed to run the app, no fat JAR required.
 Replacing sbt-buildinfo was slightly trickier. I decided to roll the replacement by hand and 'sacrifice' a couple of things that sbt-buildinfo provides. Let's cover all of them:
  
name: I can just hard-code the project name, it's not like it's going to change all the time
 version: just need to plug in the output of git describe here
 scalaVersion: do I really need this info in my health page? Not really. I can just look up the version, pull up my repo, and figure out the Scala version there
 sbtVersion: same argument, I don't really need this in my app's health page
 buildTime: just need to plug in the output of date -u -Iseconds here (e.g. 2022-11-25T03:11:49+00:00)
 startTime: bonus, sbt-buildinfo doesn't provide this but it's trivial to add, just run val startTime = java.time.Instant.now.toString eagerly when the app starts up.
  
OK, so above in a couple of places I mention plugging in the output of shell commands, how to do that? Pretty simple. In the project code we just have a file like this committed in the repo:
 // Info.scala package build object Info { val name = "my-app-name" val version = "TBD" val buildTime = "TBD" val startTime = java.time.Instant.now.toString } 
 And at build time we just replace this file with a generated one:
 # build.sh printf ' package build object Info { val name = "my-app-name" val version = "%s" val buildTime = "%s" val startTime = java.time.Instant.now.toString } ' "$(git describe)" "$(date -u -Iseconds)" sbt test dist unzip target/.../my-app-name.zip 
 Yes, that's printf in Unix shell. It's kinda hacky–but it works.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I typeset math a lot in latex and im getting tired of distributing/leibniz'ing terms around. I wrote a pretty crappy package for sending some stuff to mathematica and inserting them into the document but this is not enough. Ideally, i would use mathematica as the last processing step, and use something more interactive to expand/distribute/factor terms. 
 ​
 My idea is to use Wisent to write a simple latex parser that can output the AST in lisp form, then modify it with structural editing in place, and finally have the lisp execute to print out automatically formatted latex code + any processing I may want to do with mathematica/sympy. Ofc, a big part of this plan depends on being able to modify the lisp code easily. Probably one of the most common cases would be transforming
 (product a (sum b1 b2 ... bn)) -> (sum (product a b1) ... (product a bn)) 
 so I need a really featureful structural editing package that allows me to jump between and into terms, combine, swap, what have you. Do any hardcore lispers have a really powerful setup they would like to share?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm looking for a way to pin packages to specific commits in straight.el and I came across this answer here on reddit - https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/iyzs29/is_there_a_way_to_pin_a_package_to_a_specific/g6frovq/ with this example.
 (use-package diminish :demand :straight (diminish :host github :repo "myrjola/diminish.el" :tag "v0.45")) 
 but according to the answer this:
  
But I think this only applies to the initial checkout, and the real way is to run straight-freeze-versions, which creates a lockfile. Then straight-thaw-versions applies whatever versions are in there to the package repos.
  
I think I also saw a :ref option in an answer here on reddit but I can't find the either the :ref and :tag option in the straight README. There is a :branch option though and that is the one I want to stick to, but it may not be safe if changes or some fixes which I may not want are backported to it.
 My idea then is to clone the repo I want, create a branch from the commit hash I want and point straight to it. If I don't make any changes to it than that "branch" will be good with straight forever, and I should be able to use the :fork option if I want to retain a reference to the original configuration.
 Is this cloning and creating an unchanging branch a good idea? I have read about the lockfiles but at this stage it is all a bit much for me. I want something I can wrap my head around for now and get to the advanced stuff later.
 For instance I want to stick to org 9.3.8 in one of my profiles. Can I set the :branch to release_9.3.8?

 Today, I bring you Package-wide Search, a way of scanning packages for certain types of objects and return all of them type-safely in a nice list to be used as you see fit.
 This one I believe is more difficult to grasp especially because of the many quoted types and the cache invalidation I mention at the end, I hope this does not discourage anyone from trying to write their own macros, I will continue posting more examples (hopefully simpler than this one)

Instead it errors out and tells me that c is not a valid prefix.
 If I force load the package by manually pressing "C-c x" then control mode finds the binding and it works until i close emacs.
 Is it possible to make it so that control mode understands the binding without first pressing "C-c x" ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm in the process of transferring my whole messy config over to use-package, and I have a few questions:
  
I can't seem to find one place that lists all installed packages. I can see some installed packages with M-x list-packages (they will be tagged as "installed", "built-in", etc), but it does not seem to list all packages. For instance, ibuffer is not listed there, but it is a package, and it is installed (I can see ibuffer.el.gz and ibuffer.elc in /usr/share/emacs/28.2/lisp/). Is there a way to see a complete list of packages? Something like the installed packages listed by M-x list-packages plus the installed packages found in /usr/share/emacs/28.2/lisp/, but in the same place?
 
I presume that all packages found in /usr/share/emacs/28.2/lisp/ are somewhat "built-in" (i.e., part of the core Emacs packages). If so, why aren't they listed with M-x list-packages as "built-in"?
 
What is the distinction between a package found in /usr/share/emacs/28.2/lisp/ and a package tagged as "built-in" by M-x list-packages? What does the latter's use of "built-in" mean, really?
 
 Thanks.

 I'm trying to make an operator in evil that does the following: 
  
takes a motion for object to keep 
 takes another motion to delete 
  
so for example if i have a string with | as the cursor "testing |with a string" and i use the operator in it with iw then i" this would leave the string as "with" .
 the problem here is that I have some motion keys that are not standard evil motion keys those functions when used with this operator they produce this error evil-extract-count: Key sequence contains no complete binding.
 an example of the motion functions is: 
 (evil-define-motion my-backward-sexp-or-pyblock ( count args) :jump nil :type 'word (if (eq major-mode 'python-mode) (if (python-info-end-of-block-p) (python-nav-backward-sexp count t t) (python-nav-backward-sexp count t) ) (sp-backward-sexp count) ) ) 
 any ideas on how to solve this problem?

 On Linux and FreeBSD this works OK, but on MacOS this is terrible, the MacOS terminal emulator creates a lot of havoc.
 Setting up a emacsclient / emacs-server combi over tcp seems rather complicated, so I haven't tried that. The remote system is a headless system, without X.
 Would installing a different terminal emulator (f.e., with brew) help? If so, any recommendations on what terminal emulator to choose?
 UPDATE: Thanks to the reply's from https://www.reddit.com/user/rpluim/ and https://www.reddit.com/user/Greenskid/, I installed iterm2. 
 In the configuration of the profile, set the left alt-key to "Esc+". After this, using Emacs over ssh works great :)

 Hey all. The code below makes it possible to define custom wrappers for results of org-babel code blocks, as well as custom actions to take after printing the results, such as automatically previewing LaTeX equations. If you think this is worth attempting to submit to the development mailing list let me know!
 ## How it works
 By default it is not possible to add custom wrappers for org-babel results, as they are hardcoded inside *org-babel-insert-result*. The code below extracts the list with result wrappers used inside *org-babel-insert-result* and puts it in a variable called *custom/org-babel-result-wrap-formats*. It is then possible to add new entries to this list, such as this one here,

where the main difference between the two is that threads share memory and
processes don’t. Modern web browsers support concurrency through the Web
Workers API. Although Web Workers are by default closer to a
multi-process model, when used with WebAssembly you can opt-in to a more
thread-like experience. Just like in systems programming, the choice of
threads vs. processes comes with various trade-offs and performance
implications; I’ll be covering some of them in this post. These examples will be in
Rust, but similar trade-offs should apply to other languages compiled to WASM.

 Occasionally a type class can calculate a constraint through the term level (this is a simplified example to demonstrate the mechanism, it doesn't actually calculate the dictionary from anything):
 class F a where gen :: a -> Dict (Eq a) zed :: a 
 This means that F a entails Eq a but only by running a term-level proof. There is no way to teach ghc this relationship without plugins.
 wit :: forall a. F a :- Eq a wit = Sub (gen @a zed) 
 The normal way to tell ghc that there is an entailment relationship is by making it a superclass
 class Eq a => F a where gen :: a -> Dict (Eq a) zed :: a

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There's a thing that I feel like I should be able to do with lenses, but I can't quite work out how. Here's the idea. I have a MultiTree data structure, which looks like this:
 ```haskell
 data Node a = Node a a deriving stock (Functor, Show, Foldable, Traversable, Generic) type MultiTree b = FreeT Node [] (b)
 -- from the free package: -- newtype FreeT f m a = FreeT { runFreeT :: m (FreeF f a (FreeT f m a)) } -- data FreeF f a b = Pure a | Free (f b) ```
 Basically a multitree is a list of trees of lists of trees of... As an example:
 ```haskell
 trees :: MultiTree Text trees = FreeT [ Free (Node (FreeT [ Pure "John", Pure "Mary", Pure "Andy"]) (FreeT [ Pure "runs", Free (Node (FreeT [Pure "eats"]) (FreeT [Pure "lettuce", Pure "garlic"])) ]) ) ] ```
 Now what I'd like to do is to use the lens library to do a breadth first traversal trees ^.. cleverTraversal which gives ["John eats lettuce", "Mary eats lettuce", "John eats garlic", "Mary eats garlic", "Andy eats lettuce", "Andy eats garlic"].
 The reason I got inspired to do this with lenses is that I came across the plate and levels functions in lens, and those seemed like the right tools to, respectively, traverse recursively, and breadth first traverse. And FreeT has a Plated instance, so I was hoping it would all work magically. But so far I'm a bit stuck.
 Anyway, I thought it might be fun to share...

 I need help with getting font-lock search based fortification when using the function. I am getting it to work, but not really over the entire buffer; initially, when font-locking for the first time when a buffer is opened, it stops after the first match is found. If I manually edit the text further in the buffer, say add and remove a space somewhere in the text, it gets font-locked correctly, but not when the text is initially font-locked. Here is a screenshot to illustrate what I am talking about. It is maybe hard to see, everything gets quite dark…]]></summary>

 I am trying to switch from quarto to orgmode to write my masters thesis. 
 One nice feature of quarto is the ability to create a multipage html site (e.g. https://r4ds.hadley.nz/) and pdf from the same source files. Is there a orgmode package out there, that provides something similar out of the box?
 Currently I am kind of overwhelmed with the amount of features of orgmode and dont know where to start ;)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I'm opening Emacs, I normally want it to display my dashboard. But if I'm opening a file, I just want it to jump straight to the file and not waste time showing the dashboard.
 It seems that there is a pretty trivial solution in cases when Emacs is invoked from the command line: just check if there are command-line arguments that look like files, and make Emacs behave accordingly.
 However, I want Emacs to behave this way even when I invoke it from the GUI: when I double-click on a file, or select 'Open with Emacs'.
 I've done some snooping around the startup code, and it looks like in the latter case, the file that we're about to open does not show up as a command-line argument, so the above solution doesn't work. Yet there must be a way for Emacs to know that it needs to open a file (otherwise it'd just open normally and not immediately display the file in a buffer). So what can I check to know if Emacs was called in this way?

 Is there a strong reason against using the following approach?

 This is how I'm representing the tree, SBranch is only used for the NOT operator.

In YAML configuration files, the package-index key is introduced which takes precedence over the existing package-indices key. The latter is deprecated.
 In YAML configuration files, the hackage-security key of the package-index key or the package-indices item can be omitted, and the Hackage Security configuration for the item will default to that for the official Hackage server. See #5870.

For me, Twitter is no longer the place where I can meet like-minded people and speak about my passions. It has nothing to do with Elon Musk's takeover, actually, as I've been feeling like this for some time, drastically limiting its use. For me, Twitter is like that family dinner where the conversation is monopolized by your uncle's political views, and you're compelled to listen, just because he has a strong voice, he's family and can't tell him to shut up.
 You can choose to stay on Twitter, who knows, I might return in the future, too 🤷‍♂️ but right now it's no longer a healthy environment for a programming community. It's due to all the noise, as outrage generates attention, and outrage is encouraged by Twitter's features. Even when speaking of programming, I don't want inflammatory tweets in my feed, from some ignorant fool, advising Elon to rewrite the whole thing in Go, alongside all the reactions to it. And I'm sure that many Twitter users can agree that engagement has gone off a cliff lately for anything that's not related to politics.
 Some of us are trying out Mastodon. As a full disclosure, out of my Twitter followers, I could find about 4% of them on Mastodon, so around 200 people, some of them inactive. But for me that's enough, plus I found interesting people from other adjacent communities.
 Mastodon may prove to be counterproductive, too, as it's another social network, and maybe there's something wrong with social networks in general. But I like that it has that original web 1.0 vibe to it, and that it is “federated”, like email. Maybe you'd like to try it out, too.
  
I added some notes on how to migrate from Twitter, maybe you'll find it useful:
 alexn.org/wiki/mastodon/
 This is not a call to arms 🙂 it's just a suggestion, as I'd love to see more of you there.
 Cheers 🤗

 (defun foo1 () (save-excursion (let ((baz '(blank blank blank))) (while (and (member 'blank baz) (not (bobp))) (cl-loop for item in-ref baz with pt = (point) when (eq item 'blank) do (unless (member pt baz) (setf item pt))) (when (member 'blank baz) (previous-line))) baz)))

 My understanding is that I can more than likely create one and integrate it if I spend a few weeks learning the syntax of ELisp(?)
 Don't want to come off like I believe I know exactly what I'm talking about (which I don't), while also trying to avoid having this be a "Is it possible to..." post (because I'm sure that it probably is).
 (Currently studying Python as an introduction to programming, and reading up on Haskell as I continue to configure my XMonad. The plan is to begin Teaching Myself Computer Science (https://teachyourselfcs.com/), and of course, Emacs will be a huge part in the undertaking of such a curriculum. Just need to know if I should bite the bullet and overload my brain with learning ELisp so early on in my career, versus waiting until I have a better grasp of things and am able to learn it much more efficiently).

Recently, the WebAssembly backend merge request has landed
in GHC, and is on course to appear in the upcoming 9.6 release series.
This post will give a quick demonstration of how to try it out
locally, and explain what comes in this patch and what will be coming next.

Playing with WASM locally
If you’re using nix on x86_64-linux, compiling a Haskell program to a
self-contained wasm module is as simple as:
$ nix shell https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc-wasm-meta/-/archive/master/ghc-wasm-meta-master.tar.gz
$ echo 'main = putStrLn "hello world"' > hello.hs
$ wasm32-wasi-ghc hello.hs -o hello.wasm

[2 of 2] Linking hello.wasm
$ wasmtime ./hello.wasm

 First one: Annotation Maps, check it out.
 I hope it helps some people in the situation I was in where nothing seemed to link together. To be noted is that those won't cover the most basic concepts such as the inline keyword, expressions, transparent etc. since these can be understood from the documentation and many other posts.
 I will try to add more guides on use cases I found perfect for macros to showcase the potential of Scala's compile-time system. Feedback appreciated also :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey!
 I'm working on a Scala app and I want to assess my options for hosting, ideally for free while I'm l scale is still incredibly small (well, just me for now 😂). 
 I'm no stranger to managing infrastructure (that's my day job) but hosting a Scala/JDK app is not something I've done before, and since this is a hobby project, I'd like to use a low friction PAAS offering if possible, just to minimise maintenance.
 My preferred cloud is GCP and I'm happy to containerise the workload. I've already considered sticking it in something like cloud run or a plain old VM using free tier, but I'm hoping there might be some lower maintenance and more magical - ideally a java flavoured Vercel or thereabouts? 😉 
 The app currently hosts a Graphql api and also performs polling of an event stream (event sourcing), so I don't think a 'cold start' option would be viable unless I rework the polling and perform the work in-line trigger based 🤔 
 Thanks in advance!

 I use LSP Mode with the clojure lsp server. No problems generally. However, I suddenly have one project that refuses to work with lsp.
 What I've looked at/tried:
  
other projects with similar deps.edn work just fine
 lsp describe session looks identical for the working projects and the one that doesn't 
 nothing looks untoward in the lsp-io-log, though I don't know the protocol well I could be missing something, no errors though
 I've blown away my projectile and lsp caches to start from scratch, same issue
 if I manually add my src dir and restart the lsp workspace lsp starts working (of course only down the src dir)
 clojure -Spath shows "src" as an element in the classpath both before and after I manually add the src path\
 lsp claims to initialize successfully and lsp-describe-sessions shows a visited clj file as a buffer under the root of the project
 after manually adding the src dir and restarting the workspace I wind up with two versions of that project in lsp-describe-sessions: one with "/src" and one without. The visited buffer now exists under the new root but not the original
  
I'd prefer not to spend the day digging into lsp-mode/the lsp server, so if anyone has any insights I'd appreciate it.

For some reason I can never find the process ID for emacs for osx to kill -9 it so I have to do a forced reboot with the power button.
 Anyone know a workaround for this? I could just be careful not to select ~ as a project but I'd rather nip this in the bud. It seems that projectile-globally-ignored-directories would ignore ~/code, which isn't great for me, and I'd rather not re-organize my directory structure over this.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I've been going through my init.el config, trying to make sense of some things, and I've noticed the following:
  
Some variables are set using setq (example: (setq mouse-wheel-progressive-speed nil)).
 
Some variables are set without using setq (example: (tool-bar-mode -1)).
 
Some variables are set to nil by setting them to nil (see point 1) while some variables are set to nil by setting them to -1 (see point 2).
 
 According to the docs, nil is false, and everything else is true. So my questions are:
  
Why does (tool-bar-mode -1) set the variable to nil?
 
Why are some variables set using setq and some without?
 
What is the difference between (setq some-variable -1), (some-variable -1), (setq some-variable nil), and (some-variable nil)? Are these equivalent? If yes, what would be the best practice?

 I'm happy to announce the new version of dr-cabal — a Haskell dependencies build time profiler!
 This version highlights a few important features:
  
Interactive profiling output
 Computation of a critical path (so you can see non-parallelisable dependencies easier)
 A new refined and simpler CLI interface
  
dr-cabal demo
 The majority of these features were contributed by Andrew Lelechenko (/u/Bodigrim) and honestly I don't know how he finds the time to contribute new awesome features while also doing a tons of work on upgrading the entire ecosystem!
 Anway, I hope you enjoy dr-cabal and you can have more insights into compilation times of your Haskell project dependencies! 🤗

 Recently I was programming in Python and needed to use match/case construction. I found out that Emacs doesn't highlight those words. I thought that they aren't in keywords list and decided to make PR about it onto Emacs git repo. But as it turned out, match/case were already defined as keywords in python.el that was stored in the repo. So I looked at installed on my machine python.el and I saw that it was actually outdated and there were no those words in the list.
 I'm using latest version of Emacs. Could you tell me please, why is that happened and how to fix that properly (i mean, i shouldn't just manually replace my outdated python.el with newer one, should i?)
 Also sorry for possible misspellings 'cause English isn't my native language and sorry for stupid question, I'm newbie :)

This note is focussed on stating the problem.

202211150901 Operationalization problem of memory
operationalization #memory
What memory is depends on how you test it. If you understand memory merely as the ability to parrot something that you have stored, memory is something completely different than if you are talking about availability. Do I have a good memory if I can name the back of an index card, but I can't access its contents when I'm supposed to be using it?
Memorization takes into account a small part of this problem: It is a common recommendation that one practice "Active Recall" and not merely repeat the material (e.g., by reading through it several times).
After "Active Recall", the key is to make content available when you actually need it, not just in the test situation. There is a difference between memory and the repertoire at one's disposal.
But it is difficult to operationalize the situation of actual use.
Thesis: You should start with simple memory techniques and then work your way up to more complex ones.

 and lsp doctor output:

 EDIT: emacs -Q will give you the same result.
 EDIT 2: This does NOT persist in emacs-28.1 tag and master branch. Only persists in emacs-28.2 tag and emacs-28 branch.
 Steps to reproduce
  
Upgrade packages 
 restart-emacs
 M-x toggle-debug-on-error
 M-x toggle-debug-on-quit
 M-x profiler-start
 M-x pyvenv-workon (only if you have it)
 Open a python file in a directory
 Emacs freezes
 Open terminal and run pkill -SIGUSR2 emacs
 you will see stack-trace in emacs, profiler-stop and profiler-report will give you results like below 
  
error

 I am looking to see if I can replicate VSCode-Vim Easymotion bidirectional word highlighting. I can replicate forward and backward word highlighting for jumps, just not bidirectional.
 For anyone who has hacked together a solution, any suggestions?
 I would like to press space bar and maybe one character and be able to jump to any word shown on the screen.

 When you send an PGP encrypted mail with Mutt, the Subject line gets protected. Which means that in the headers, the Subject is replaced by "....", and the "real" Subject line is moved to the encrypted part of the email message.
 When receiving a message with a protected header, upon decryption Mutt recognizes the "real" Subject line and shows that in the list of messages.
 Does Gnus support any of thexe options? I have been searching for "protected header" but haven't found anything, but perhaps my search capabilities may not be good enough ...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've recently learned to use lenses and experimented with various setups. I'm mostly concerned about the Haskell record namespacing issues; this gist from 2017 offers a makeFields (& variants) based solutions but requires centralizing lens declarations which I'm not a fan of. It forces you to extract out datatype declarations from their Module into Module.Types or Types.Module to avoid circular dependencies, which is time-consuming and adds avoidable complexity to the project's directory structure.
 I've written a short guide showing:
  
The detailed pros and cons of using generic-lens, DuplicateRecordFields, OverloadedRecordDot and NoFieldSelectors
 The minimum code required to use take advantage of those tools
  
If you're looking for a modern lens setup or way to deal with Haskell's record namespacing problem I recommend checking out this guide. I've tried to make this guide beginner-friendly so I think it should be a decent reference to start using lenses for the first time.

 If you have any correction or suggestion I will gladly add them to the tutorial!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I'm going to start over. I've got mu4e working with reading multiple email addresses, I've got contexts I can send from, and I've got random bugs and gotchas that I'll never find in the rats nest of read-envelope-from sendmail-extra-arguments and other options. Bonus points if the guide explains what the options are doing.
 All the guides I've gone through seem to run out of steam before actually sending and responding to email -- it's all... look, I configured IMAP... and for gmail cause that's hard. But responding to an email and automatically changing the from: based on the to:, etc are barely touched on. (currently my to: lines gets overriden by my from: lol -- the amount of side-effects from any change are massive).
 ​
 TL;DR: I'd love a complete guide for setting up multiple email addresses, that includes responding to emails and sending from the correct account with the correct .sig etc. (The stuff generic clients do automatically)
 ​
 Thanks. I've spent an ungodly amount of time on this. You'd think these packages would include 1 complete example that you could pair down to your needs, rather than parsing blogs from the last 20 years and seeing what still exists, what actually works, and then checking out the random bugs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was playing with Scala, trying to see if I like it and if I am willing to invest more time into it. I would like to use the cfor macro from Spire in a numerical code snippet where performance is important, but how should I do it? The canonical way seems to be to add the library to the build.sbt file, but here I am not writing a full project, I am just playing with the REPL to get a taste of the language, so there is no build.sbt file. Surely there must be some easier way to use libraries, right?
 (And, in general, if one just wants to have fun solving problems from "Project Euler", so just writing code snippets in the REPL, or in some light text editor and then compiling them, how does one do it? It seems that the first steps in the Scala world must be Coursier, SBT, Maven etc., which makes things very professional and kills all the geekish fun. Is there a way to avoid them? Downloading the standalone Scala compiler is easy, but how does one deal with foreign libraries?)

 Basically I will be changing the tree and some of the changes are depending on the sizes and locations of the elements inside. The library may not provide rendering, if I’m getting Svg text back, that’s enough for me.

 For every context the value is t, with the previous value being set to the correct value from the context. So the context is setting it, and then it's getting clobbered to t.
 I don't set mail-signature anywhere else, and don't think I can set a breakpoint on a var, so does anyone have a clue where else mail-signature could get set from? (I'm checking in the compose window, so .msmtprc shouldn't matter since I'm not actually sending yet).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Does anyone know of any online courses/MOOCs that use Haskell but aren't dedicated to learning Haskell? I'm looking for a course where the content is about an interesting, language agnostic concept (databases, networking, compilers, anything really) and the course just happens to use Haskell as the language for the projects. A course where knowledge of Haskell is a prerequisite, not a goal. My searches so far have only returned results for the latter.
 I took an OCaml class in college, and I've worked through some Haskell books. I'm at the point where a "learn Haskell" course wouldn't provide much benefit to me. I'd like to apply my knowledge to a real project, but for some reason I'm just not creative enough to come up with personal projects out of thin air. Looking for a more guided/structured way to build an actual Haskell project.

 [(i, j) | i <- [2..4]] | j <- [3..5]] [[(2,3),(3,3),(4,3)],[(2,4),(3,4),(4,4)],[(2,5),(3,5),(4,5)]] 
 And also, if I wanted to make a triply-nested list comprehension, how would I do that?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I often have two side by side windows and, in my case, the right one shows the output of something in the left one (an error, or the result of a function). I'll want to see that error or output and then get back t my side by side arrangement and continue right where I am in the first. Currently, I switch to the other window with ace-window o (C-x o in my case) then mazimize that one with zoom-window-zoom (bound to z in my case). The nice thing with zoom-window-zoom is that it toggles... so z again unmazimizes the window. Then I C-x o again to get back to the first window. So, to fill my screen with the other window: C-x o, z, z, C-x o. Muscle memory at this point. But I want to be able to hit one key and maximize the other window, and hit it again to unmaximize the other window, and have my pointer where it was in the first window at the end. I'm not attached to ace-window or zoom-window-zoom... they were just what I happened across. I realize this may be more complicated if I have more than two windows open, but I very seldom do. Thoughts? And Thanks!
 PS - I have a lot of rebindings so knowing the command a suggested binding invokes is helpful.

 Note that Emacs recognizes "\\.[ds]?va?h?\\'" as verilog-mode, which includes both verilog (i.e., *.v) and SystemVerilog (i.e., *.sv, *.sva) files.
 "hdl_checker" works for both Verilog and SystemVerilog files. so when I open ".sv" file `:server-id 'lsp-verilog` (i.e., hdl_checker) is initialized by default. 
 How do I switch between svlangserver and hdl_checker for systemverilog (.sv, *.sva)?
 Thank you for your time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone, get-tested is a CLI tool that reads your cabal file and takes the tested-with stanza to generate a build matrix for GitHub Actions. It's fairly basic at the moment but I've already migrated a couple of projects to it, and it really is nice to have. Positive points:
  
You have one source of truth regarding the supported compiler versions for your projects: your cabal file. 
 No codegen is involved! You do not have to occasionally re-generate your CI file, which means that you can keep all the peculiarities and weird hacks you used to have. This tool only concerns itself with providing a list of OS and GHC versions. Some of which you can still exclude in the action file.
  
Coincidentally (or not), the next release of Flora will bring this stanza to the forefront (see associated announcement).
 Since the idea is to really be intertwined with the Haskell Github Action, the list of supported compiler is shared between this tool, the setup action and Flora.
 My thanks to David Christiansen for the idea of the CLI tool. The idea for it is to both disappear inside the future cabal status command, and that it becomes part of the official Haskell actions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The variable gc-cons-threshold is the threshold beyond which Emacs will run garbage collection. So if more memory is allocated than this (in bytes) the garbage collector runs. The default value is 800000 - just 7.6MiB! Starting Emacs and looking at gcs-done gives 67 for me (the garbage collector has run 67 times) and (emacs-init-time) gives "5.464376 seconds".
 At the start of my init.el, I've put:
 ;; Don't collect garbage while initialising. (setq gc-cons-threshold most-positive-fixnum) 
 And at the end:
 (setq gc-cons-threshold (* 1024 1024 100)) ; 100 MiB 
 You could also put (garbage-collect) at the end to collect garbage if that tickles your fancy.
 Now gcs-done is 12 (for some reason), and (emacs-init-time) is "3.598263 seconds", which is a decent improvement of nearly two seconds. I have a very heavy and badly-written configuration file, so I need all the help I can get 🙂.
 You could probably get away with higher values of gc-cons-threshold, but bear in mind that the larger the threshold, the rarer the garbage collection, but the longer it takes. So you might end up with tiny but noticeable pauses while you're typing, which would be annoying. Not sure about that so it's worth experimenting.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello dear Scala community !
 I have a very dumb ( or not, I am not sure ) question.
 Recently at work we kinda started a debate on how to handle errors in our applications : we use tapir + http4s and cats-effect's IO everywhere and current urrent practice is to throw everything in the IO's error channel and eventually catch it somewhere upstream. 
 But by switching to mainly using http4s clients to sttp clients to communi6between our services we often find our business logic kinda sandwiched between a source of data producing IO[Either[E,A]] and an API description which expects the same.
 Lifting everything into the IO error channel to caste it again into the same input shape seems to be a waste of information and effort, while also not getting any help from the compiler to handle those errors. This kinda leads me to lean toward using EitherTs....which is metwith some resistance as it does tend to add some complexity to the code.
 In this context I found out about this wonderful article https://guillaumebogard.dev/posts/functional-error-handling/ which seemed to reflect exactly my own...erm...reflexions. After reading it, I thought I found the perfect middle ground ! Put errors not in the output type of your functions, but give it the capability to fail thru MonadError from cats and Raise from cats-mtl. Maybe lift everything into a neat context function type an bam everyone is happy.
 I started experimenting. Everything was very neat and tidy until....and here comes my dumb question....where do I get MonadError and Raise instances for IO ? Is there another lib ?
 I found tofu which seems to cover pretty much anything I need but they don't publish for scala 3. Do I have to rewrite both for the IO monad ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been reading gnu's manul on elisp recently. In sort function, it talked on sort being destructive.
  
(setq nums (list 1 3 2 6 5 4 0)) ⇒ (1 3 2 6 5 4 0)
 (sort nums #'<) ⇒ (0 1 2 3 4 5 6)
 nums ⇒ (1 2 3 4 5 6)
  
Well, I understand this because it is a linked list and nums points to the cell that contains 1. To get the sorted list, we have to store the result back: (setq nums (sort nums #'<)).
 However, with doing this it said:
  
Most often we store the result back into the variable that held the original list
  
It's "Most often". So it means it's not 100% reliable, right? And why is that? I suppose sorting a list is a fundamental functionality in most languages. If it's not 100% reliable, what is the best practice to sort a list in elisp?
 Thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[org-goto-all and org-goto are probably my most used commands since I take a lot of notes. However, I have so much headlines that it takes some effort to narrow them down (headlines with similar words, so I end up parsing through lines of headlines to dig for what I'm looking for).
 Some headlines I don't need to org-goto-all, but I still it to use it as a headline for styling and if I'm in the file, org-goto is still useful.
 For my purposes, perhaps excluding headlines from an entire file and then whitelisting some significant headlines I want to org-goto-all is perfect. I've also heard of people having performance issues from too many headlines, so being able to exclude some from org-goto-all should alleviate this and allow quicker way of finding what I want. I could split into more files and just jump to them and org-goto, but I have a massive todo.org file and it has content relevant to what I'm looking for in addition to notes in a file-specific file if it has one. 
 I'm open to any approaches as well. I use org-ql/org-super-agenda but only as a custom org agenda (it's from a template that I tweaked a little, I don't know any elisp).

And then when I C-c C-c to send it comes from the wrong (default) email address... even though the name part stays correct. So somehow the email to send from is getting clobbered at send time.
 ​
 I've tried so many things with various results, I know people will want all my configs but I'm just wondering where else to look that can potentially cause a clobbering. message-sendmail-envelope-from set to nil to make sure user-mail-address used -- but nothing seems to matter from the sending side. (using msmtp on the send side)
 ​
 Thanks for any and all info. Or maybe just a guide that focuses on sending from multiple emails -- all the guides seem to say to skip right over the sending side of multiple emails and aliases.

So I wrote a little python code in org mode blocks (why not a .py file? just because I like org) to create another .org document with the sql database tables for a quick overview and not having to exit emacs. So now I like to build a function in emacs-lisp to execute the code blocks in the org mode file to automatically generate the tables when you call it, but I'm very new to emacs-lisp and don't know where to start. Any suggestions for that? . 
 Is there a package that does something similar?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone.
 I am trying to find a way to replicate the bracket behavior to the dollar sign symbols (just as if $$ was something like {}).
 This is because I use org-mode to write math notes with a lot of latex sections and most of these latex "windows" are done by surrounding the piece of text with dollar signs.
 eg: $\alpha\beta latex things$.
 Of course the best would be to have a way of setting this to any kind of couple of symbols or symbol combinations.
 For example in latex it would be immensely useful to do it on \{ and \}.
 Does someone know how to approach this?
 I use doom emacs if that matters, but I hope that a solution might be helpful to whoever needs it as well.
 Thank you a lot.

 I found the function mu4e-view-save-attachments and it asks me which part I want to save, but then nothing happens.
 I thought at one point there was a key that would force it to save rather than open, but I can't seem to find it now. Anyone?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a question about the undo and redo workflow (mostly org-roam). Undo often deletes a lot of changes for me. There doesn't seem to be any caching of steps between escaping.
 Example:
  
Write code and an explanation below.
 I mark the code to copy it, but when I hit "y" there is only this little y where the code once was. Forgot to escape.
 When I now use undo, the whole text resets to an almost ancient state, sometimes from 10-30 minutes ago.
 So I have to redo-undo.
 Now I'm still stuck with the y instead of the code and I have two options: 
 Type all again from the ancient state.
 Type the code again, I accidentally deleted by pressing y without escaping first.
 
  
Is there any way I can prevent this time-consuming mess? It can't be that everyone who works with Emacs constantly loses text / code and hours of work. So the fault must be on my side.
 I read through the undo chapter of Emacs and a few threads here in Emacs on reddit. (https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Undo.html). But I can't really make sense of it.
 How do you prevent this from happening? What is your workflow for undo and redo?
 I am very grateful for any help.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey guys, I am currently using emacs to analyze files with tab separated values.I already wrote some basic highlighting (different colors for different columns).
 Is there any way to specify value of tab-width for specific columns?For example, I would like to have tab for first column be 4, for second it would be 10, for third it can be 2 and so on.
 I checked the csv-mode, but the files that I am working on are not pure .tsv.
 First part of the file is actually free text, then there are tab separated values. So aligning the columns with csv-mode creates veeery long columns(which is totally unreadable), due to long lines of text in the beginning.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am trying to recreate the basic examples from the purescript-argonaut-codecs package. My Main.purs is like
 type User = { name :: String , age :: Maybe Int , team :: Maybe String } userDataString :: String userDataString = "{\"name\":\"John\",\"age\":25,\"team:\":\"Red Team\"}" main :: Effect Unit main = do case decodedUser of Left err -> log $ show err Right user -> log $ stringify user where decodedUser = (decodeJson =<< parseJson userDataString) -- :: Either JsonDecodeError User 
 Which will print, as to be expected
 {"name":"John","age":25,"team:":"Red Team"} [info] Success! Waiting for next file change. 
 When I remove the comments of the type annotation however, to match what the argonaut example does, it will fail with
 [1 of 1] Compiling Main Error found: in module Main at src/Main.purs:40:35 - 40:39 (line 40, column 35 - line 40, column 39) Could not match type { age :: Maybe Int , name :: String , team :: Maybe String} with type Json while checking that type t0 is at least as general as type Json while checking that expression user has type Json in value declaration main where t0 is an unknown type See https://github.com/purescript/documentation/blob/master/errors/TypesDoNotUnify.md for more information, or to contribute content related to this error. [error] Failed to build.) 
 What am I doing wrong? Is there something I misunderstood? I'm new to PureScript, but have some experience with functional languages.
 Edit: Never mind, after decoding Json to User, I forgot to change the serialisation function from stringify :: Json -> String to show which uses the inherited Show instance of the record...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to understand the difference/overlap between the transformers and mtl libraries. I've found a lot of information, most of which seems to be like 10 years out-of-date. Depending on the year, the advice has ranged from "definitely use mtl" to "definitely use transformers" to "it doesn't matter, they're basically the same thing".
 So here's my noobed-up interpretation of the current situation, what I've managed to glean:
 mtl is (now?) built on top of transformers, so they are in that sense "compatible". However, mtl provides some "extra stuff".
 So my questions:
  
Is that basic summary more-or-less correct?
 ...and if so, what is the "extra stuff" that mtl provides? I've read the docs, a few wikis, and a whole pile of stack overflow threads, but still am not clear. (Some type classes, I think?) Practically speaking, why choose mtl over transformers?
  
I've only used transformers so far, but am not sure exactly what I'm missing. I appreciate any pointers!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been trying out org-roam, and it seems encouraged to navigate between the files (as open buffers or yet to be open things) by using org-roam-find-node. 
 However, doing this a few times, I end up with a lot of org-roam buffers clogging up my other buffer list. I see the names generally start with a YYYYMMDD.... prefix, and end in the standard .org suffix - I see that there is a consult-buffer-filter option, but that wouldn't be completely sufficient due to the non-standard name of these files (it'd be nice if I could ensure they all are prefixed with "or-" or some such).
 Even better would be if I could also exclude them from my recentf list, but I'm hoping for the buffers currently.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 Not sure whether this should be handled at Scotty level or at Docker level, but my problem is the following:
 I've set up Docker and Nginx reverse proxy on a hosted Debian VPS. I'm successfully hosting multiple websites with SSL on this VPS, including an application built with Scotty.
 The app is basically just an editor in which you can write programs in a DSL I implemented. When you press "Run", the contents of the editor is sent to the backend as a POST request, and the program is evaluated server-side. The server then responds with the result.
 The problem arises in the fact that the DSL in question allows for infinite loops. Thus, when the backend evaluates the given program, it might not terminate. When this happens, the app is down for at least a minute seconds and the process consumes ~100% of the CPU on the server.
 Is there a reliable way (in my current Linux/Docker/Scotty stack) to automatically kill the process if it runs for more than, say, 8 seconds?
 What I've tried so far:
  
Setting a timeout of 8 seconds using scottyOpts
 Defining a health check in the Dockerfile that runs every 30 seconds
  
The health check helps in the sense that it automatically restarts the container if the service does not respond, but this still yields significant downtime.
 Let me know if the post does not fit the sub.
 Cheers!

 I haven't figured out where to put this that doesn't throw an error on doom sync. Because I'm using doom, I have an ~/.emacs.d/ and a ~/.doom.d, which each contain various init.el and packages.el files. The packages file in .doom.d indicates packages are installable via:
 ;; To install SOME-PACKAGE from MELPA, ELPA or emacsmirror: ;; (package! some-package) (package! elpy) 
 So I've done that, and run doom sync and reloaded Doom. It seems now that elpy is installed in a half state. There are many elpy commands available in M-x such as elpy-doc, elpy-menu, elpy-test, but the reason I installed this package is that I want to be able to navigate to e.g. Widgets(foo=bar, baz=qux) in a Python file and jump to definition, which isn't working - M-. instead outputs an error, "Previous command was not evil-repeat".

 What is weird is sometimes I get the list but only after a huge time delay. If I do completion-at-point, I get a list instantly but it is in the mini buffer and not displayed like the referenced image.
 I don't know a reasonable method of debugging this and figuring out what is wrong.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I would like to define some defaults for a subdirectory. Specifically override git author in all repositories under specific directory.
 Ideally I'd do it using `.dir-locals.el` or `dir-locals-set-class-variables` one level above all the git repos. However it seems as soon as Emacs finds one configuration it stops looking up the directory structure. So if I have project-specific .dir-locals.el I'd need to copy my overrides from level above.
 Is there a standard way to do this? Am I missing something? I didn't even notice any mention that Emacs stops looking as soon as it finds one in the docs (https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Directory-Variables.html) or anywhere else.
 The closest thing I found was this https://github.com/jinnovation/nested-dir-locals.el

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to use the emms-status package to get a nice-looking description of the currently playing track in the mode line. It mostly works -- track name, artist, year, and current timestamp -- but I can't see how long the current track is. 
  
 I think the problem is that the emms-track-get function doesn't retrieve the info-playing-time key/variable. I can test this by editing the emms-track-description-function to try to retrieve info-playing-time, but the track listings in a playlist buffer do not show this. 
  
 Is there any way to fix this? I'm using emms-player-mpv as the only player, could that be the origin of this issue?
