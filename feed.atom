        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been following along Real World Haskell, and getting the indentation right while following their style is infuriating.
 E.g,
 -- file: ch03/Lending.hs lend amount balance = let reserve = 100 newBalance = balance - amount in if balance < reserve then Nothing else Just newBalance 
 I find myself Pressing "tab" to overshoot the appropriate column, then hitting "backspace" in my editor to delete 4 spaces at a time (too many), then repeatedly smacking "space", overshooting again, deleting 4 spaces again, etc....
 Since the appropriate number of spaces to indent changes expression to expression, are there any editor/plugins/etc. that would allow for "contextual" tab stops, so that "tab" and "backspace" simply add and remove the right amount of spaces relevant to the expression I'm currently editing? I'm currently using vscode with haskell-language-server.
 Or would it be better to simply adopt a style that ignores this problem entirely? I.e., Google leads me to https://kowainik.github.io/posts/2019-02-06-style-guide
  
The indentation of a line should not depend on the length of any identifier in preceding lines.

 #+begin_src emacs-lisp (use-package org-download :config (add-hook 'dired-mode-hook 'org-download-enable) (setq-default org-download-heading-lvl nil) (setq-default org-download-image-dir "~/ko-pa-ni/images") (setq org-download-screenshot-method "~/.scripts/sway-contrib/grimshot savecopy area") :bind (("C-c d s" . org-download-screenshot) ("C-c d y" . org-download-yank))) #+end_src 
 Whenever I use org-download-screenshot, the grimshot kicks in and I can draw a rectangle to capture the area I want on the screen, but then emacs freezes and there is no image found under the org-download-image-dir. I think it has to do with grimshot and org-download not communicating. Having no image in the directory tells me that org-download takes care of pushing the image to the configured directory but grimshot usually saves to ~/Pictures/screenshots but even there I cannot find the screenshots.

I totally understand it was probably another name for sequence notes in Zettel, my question is, if I were to do this, and how do I know if the number I give to a note is occupied? He wrote in the book that "There are no “occupied slots,” because there is no prescribed order." but if that's the case, does it mean I can have two note share the same number , say "1.1 apple is edible" and "1.1 Elephant is large mammal"? My current thought on a work around is to put that number after a UID, say yyyyMMddHHmmss and a "-" and after that begin the number sequence.
Not sure If I explain my question properly, wish you all good luck.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone,
 I'm very happy to announce the release of Yampa 0.14.10 and yampa-test 0.14.10.
 Yampa is a fast, elegant Functional Reactive Programming implementation. Yampa prides itself in being a long-standing community project. It has now been around for 20 years!!! See https://github.com/ivanperez-keera/yampa#features for details on Yampa's features.
 This new release introduces a new type of integral that implements the trapezoid integration rule. Simulations executed at low sampling rates can behave in ways that violate expected physical laws (e.g., systems may gain energy over time due to inaccuracies in the calculation of positions and velocities). This new integral behaves in a more stable way in such cases. Thanks to Github users idontgetoutmuch , miguel-negrao and thalerjonatha…]]></summary>

 This seems to persist between Emacs versions, and it only happens when I open a vterm shell while using TRAMP in a remote server. If I instead open a vterm shell on my local computer first and then ssh into the remote server, it doesn't have this issue.

I have a few additional computers at home, including a web server. I don't really use org on mobile devices. I want to be able to put my org files on my own server and read them primarily from off-network.
 Currently I'm syncing my org files through OneDrive, which works for the most part. I only rarely use my personal computers for org, but would like to be able to reference them, esp. from the server for automations.
 It occurred to me that this could be done reasonably easily through WebDAV. I'm literate enough to set up the technical stuff myself, but realize I may be overlooking other options. Really, I'm less literate in Emacs/org, so I'd ask the community - is there anything wrong with using a WebDAV mount for org files? In terms of use, security, whatever. Is there some better way to share org files on my home server that can be mounted to a directory in linux?
 (for what it's worth: I cannot use a VPN at work but can use an SSH tunnel)

 Right now I'm using my own adhoc/hackish command (plugged into capf@vertico) to complete with "foo".
 Vertico would show: (/workspace/x is the git repo's top-level)
 Open File: foo foo_a.c in a/very/long/path/.../foo_a.c at /workspace/x foo_a.c in ya/very/long/path/.../foo_a.c at /workspace/x foo_b.c in b/another/very/long/path/.../foo_a.c at /workspace/x 
 Is there any melpa/elpa/buitin package/solution that does file-name completion while ignoring the dir? especially ones that let vertico clearly show the filename sans-directory in the completion list.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I'm using vertico and marginalia in my emacs setup. I was following System Crafters video to set up and configure org-roam. I'm not seeing tags in my results when I search for nodes. For example, I have #+filetags: project in some of my nodes. But I don't see them in the results when I run org-roam-node-find. I'm unable to filter by them.
 I'm not sure if this is related to marginalia or vertico. But here are my configs for both.
 Marginalia config
  (use-package marginalia :after vertico :custom (marginalia-annotators '(marginalia-annotators-heavy marginalia-annotators-light nil)) (marginalia-align 'right) (marginalia-align-offset -5) :init (marginalia-mode)) 
 Vertico config
  (use-package vertico :bind (:map minibuffer-local-map ("<Backspace>" . rr/minibuffer-backward-kill)) :custom (vertico-cycle t) :init (vertico-mode +1) (setq completion-styles '(flex partial-completion) completion-ignore-case t completion-category-defaults nil completion-category-overrides nil)) 
 Also, here's one of my roam nodes:
 :PROPERTIES: :ID: AFD9D19B-00AC-477C-95CE-7F02BA88D527 :END: #+title: Foo #+category: Foo #+filetags: project * Tasks * TODO Test task SCHEDULED: <2024-08-09 Fri> 
 Am I missing any config? Any help would be appreciated.
 EDIT: I had to set the following line while setting up org-roam.
 (setq org-roam-node-display-template (concat "${title:*} " (propertize "${tags:10}" 'face 'org-tag)))

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am a Doom Emacs user. I am trying to hide the habits consistency graph from a custom agenda view.
 I tried a few variations of the following to try to only affect this custom view (works for agenda-groups):
 lisp (agenda "" ( (org-habit-graph-column 0) (+org-habit-min-width 0) (org-agenda-span 'day) (org-agenda-start-day ".") (org-super-agenda-groups nil) )) 
 Then I tried setting some variables globally hoping to suppress it:
 lisp (after! (org org-agenda) (setq! org-habit-graph-column 1 +org-habit-min-width 10 org-habit-preceding-days 1 org-habit-following-days 1 org-habit-show-habits-only-for-today t )) 
 Every time, the graph shows in agenda. When I check the variables while in the agenda view the values are not the ones I set in the config; org-habit-graph-column (which I was the most hopeful about if set below the value of +org-habit-min-width) for example is always set to 99.
 Thanks for your help.

 As  indicated in a comment, however, this approach makes it awkward to separate the DI framework from service definitions. It occurred to me it would be easier to do so with an approach modeled on ZIO's ZLayer. I've provided a POC along with a discussion in a gist:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm upgrading an app from 2.12 to 2.13 and there's a variable declaration with an arrow function that doesn't throw an error but also isn't getting called and I'm trying to understand what's wrong with it, but my googling skills are failing me. Here's is a pseudocode version of it:
  class { function("/route")(SourceParamsReads(Reads)) { println("a log here prints successfully") Params => println("no logs here or beyond print successfully") function(Params.session) { id => val source = Params.source val user = ( groupId = Params.groupId userId = Params.userId ) val future = ... future.map {...} } } 
 There's more in the ellipses but hopefully this is enough information. the Params variable has no references anywhere else in the application, just before the arrow and inside it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I just discovered a "bug" (it wasn't a bug in magit, but a change in Git itself) in magit when I switched to a newer version of Git. After googling I found out that the problem has already been solved in magit over a year ago. Because I'm updating the Emacs packages once in a month, I was wondering why it is still in my local magit installation.
 The reason is that the release versions on NonGNU Elpa and Melpa Stable are still version 3.3.0, which was released on Oct 4, 2021. Does somebody know the reason why there are no new releases on those archives?
 Yes, I know I could use Melpa Unstable, but I don't want it, because I'm serving a lot of my colleagues with an Emacs configuration and I don't want to use unstable package versions.
 Yes, I know I could ask directly on GitHub, but I don't want to create an account for just one question.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We have a small team of "algorithms engineers" who, as most of the "data science" / "ML" sector, use python. Pandas, numpy, scipy, etc.: all have been very helpful for their explorations. We have been going through an exercise of improving the quality of their code because these algorithms will be used in production systems once they are integrated into our core services: correctness and maintainability are important.
 Ideally, these codebases would be written in Haskell for those reasons (not the topic I'm here to debate), but I don't want to hamstring their ability to explore or build (we have done a lot of research to get to the point where we have things we want to get into production).
 Does anyone have professional experience doing ML / data-science / algorithms engineering in the Haskell ecosystem, and could you tell me what that experience was like? Especially wrt Haskell alternatives to pandas / numpy / various ML libraries / matplotlib.

 I am developing the major and minor modes for Gobra, a Go verifier. When annotating a go program with specification, we use //@ or // @, and Gobra parses these lines as logic instead of just comments (we also have the multiline variant but let's keep this as simple as possible).
 I have a minor mode for Go buffers to be able to interact with Gobra and I also want to add syntax highlighting for Gobra's specification language. This means I have to override the default syntactic-face-function to work differently for these special comments.
 What I have is this until now:
 ``` (defconst gobra-comment-regexp-prefixes '("// ?@" "/* ?@"))
 (defun gobra-update-nth (l n i) "Return a copy of the list L with the Nth element updated to I." (append (cl-subseq l 0 n) (list i) (nthcdr (1+ n) l)))…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is a bit of a follow-up from this post. I have two related problems, I'm at my wits-end and I was hoping for some advice.
 The problem basically boils down to injecting context into an Aeson FromJSON parser. If I wish to read a file of JSON objects that refer to each other, I would like to be able to replace an identifier reference with the actual object when it is read. For example
  data Region = Region { regionID :: Text , regionName :: Text , regionType :: RegionType , regionParent :: Maybe Region , regionLocale :: Maybe Locale } 
 with data like
  [ { "id": "ES", "name": "Spain", "type": "Country", "locale": "es" }, { "id": "ES-CL", "name": "Castille and León", "type": "Subnational", "parent": "ES" } { "id": "ES-GA", "name": "Galicia", "type": "Subnational", "parent": "ES", "locale": "ga" } ] 
 I have an elaborate system of placeholders and normalisation at the moment to sort out the parent references to "ES" and I was wondering if there was something, a la Jackson, that would handle references naturally.
 I have lots and lots of other examples of this sort of need to reference other items.
 The other aspect of this in injecting this information, hopefully using the ReaderT pattern, into another parser that will use this data. As an example,
  data Location = Location { locationID :: Text , locationName :: Text, , locationRegion :: Region } 
 and 
  [ { "id": "S", "name": "Santiago de Compostella", "region": "ES-GA" } ] 
 where the Galicia data, with all its useful information such as locales and holidays, replaces the "ES-GA" reference.
 I have wasted waaay to much time trying to figure out how to achive this and would appreciate any useful* advice.
 * With the caveat that I do not regard "embed it into code" as "useful". The idea that I can't give users control over their configuration makes my skin crawl.

 homodoro is what I came up with, a quite simple TUI program with some timers and an extremely simple task manager, I feel like I probably didn't learn much about Haskell/FP in general while developing this but it was the most joy I ever felt while programming something and I'm quite happy with the result.
 All feedback is much appreciated.

I start emacs, the init file runs 
 it gets to org-babel-load file (code below)
 init.el is generated from org
 init file gets evaluated
  
However, when I was installing on a new machine today, I noticed than not all of the lisp code from the org file was in the generated init.el. Did something change in the newer versions of emacs? (newest machine is 29.4)
 Or have I just been misunderstanding how it worked all this time?
 (org-babel-load-file
 (expand-file-name "init.org"
 "~/.emacs.d/org")) 
 To resolve the issue I deleted the init.el file and restarted emacs, this time it generated and executed everything. Restarting alone made no difference.

 Please, correct me if I am wrong, but I understand it is a change in `org-mode` version 9.7 which throws a warning when the function is used in a non Org buffer. So, chances are that when the warning pops up, it is from an external package that has not conformed yet to that new rule/convention.
 Anyway, I get this warning every time I open the agenda time-grid, tall other built-in or custom views are working fine. This is not a terrible thing, but warnings are designed to be annoying, so I would like to get rid of it.
 Is pinning `org-mode` to a previous version the best way to go ? Any recommendation as to which version I should downgrade to ?
 I am a Doom Emacs user if it is relevant. Thanks in advance for your help.

 Google searches only suggested pixel-scrolling options, which i tried and have not worked.
 ChatGPT told me to stop using images altogether lol.

If you disagree, what does the English word 'register' mean to you, and in a zettelkasten context, how does it differ from an index?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Emacs makes use of a number of Linux-based command-line utilites, such as ls, grep, diff, and so on. However, recently I've started working for a company who has allowed me to have Emacs on my system, and have installed Ubuntu for Windows Subsystem for Linux on their Windows 10 systems.
 Unfortunately, sudo is not an option for my WSL instance, so there's no way to add any components (including Emacs or any GUI functionality) to my WSL instance, so I can only download the native Windows portable version of Emacs.
 I know that you can use the WSL commands by prefacing them with bash -s, such as bash -s find -name filename.ext. However, I'm not sure where I can specify this to Emacs without going through the source to find all the variables containing the commands I need.
 To make this more complicated, I also make use of Vertico and consult (among the other components).
 Is there a single location where I can notify Emacs to add bash -s to the start of shell commands, or perhaps a list of variables that I can add to my .emacs.d tree?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been researching how to use optimal evaluation to optimize Discrete Program Search and, eventually, I arrived at a simple algorithm that seems to be really effective. Based on the following tests:
 f 1001101110 = 1010100110 f 0100010100 = 1001101001 
 Solving for 'f' (by search), we find:
 xor_xnor (0:0:xs) = 0 : 1 : xor_xnor xs xor_xnor (0:1:xs) = 1 : 0 : xor_xnor xs xor_xnor (1:0:xs) = 1 : 0 : xor_xnor xs xor_xnor (1:1:xs) = 0 : 1 : xor_xnor xs 
 My best Haskell searcher, using the Omega Monad, takes 47m guesses, or about 2.8s. Meanwhile, the HVM searcher, using SUP Nodes, takes just 1.7m interactions, or about 0.0085s. More interestingly, it takes just 0.03 interactions per guess. This sounds like a huge speedup, so, it is very likely I'm doing something dumb. As such, I'd like to ask for validation.
 I've published the Haskell code (and the full story, for these interested) below. My question is: Am I missing something? Is there some obvious way to optimize this Haskell search without changing the algorithm? Of course, the algorithm is still exponential and not necessarily useful, but I'm specifically interested in determining whether the HVM version is actually faster than what can be done in Haskell.

 I am trying to export the matplotlib graphic to the same directory that the org files lives in:
 #+begin_src python :results graphics file output :file temp_plot_2.png import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt x = np.linspace(0, 10, 100) y = np.sin(x) fig, ax = plt.subplots() ax.plot(x, y) #+end_src 
 The file is generated as expected, but ends up in the ~ directory.
 I checked the default-directory variable, and it is correctly set to the ~/images directory, where the org file lives, and where I want the graph (image) to go.
 When I use absolute paths in the :file argument (e.g., :file /home/<username>/images/temp_plot_2.png), it works as expected, but I don't want to need to provide the absolute path every time.
 Anyone have any idea what's going on, and why relative paths seem to not be working as expected?
 From the org manual, which seems to be in conflict with what I actually observe, since the directory associated with the current buffer is /home/<username>/images according to the local default-buffer variable, but file output is actually /home/<username>:
  
The ‘dir’ header argument specifies the default directory during code block execution. If it is absent, then the directory associated with the current buffer is used.
 https://orgmode.org/manual/Environment-of-a-Code-Block.html
  
I tried specifying the dir header; didn't work. I tried using M-x cd and navigating manually to the /home/<username>/images directory; didn't work.

 with all the tracking discord attachments have, i lose this.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Edit: I changed the title from "How do you take notes on claims attributed to secondary sources?" to "How to deal with unverified indirect claims?". @Andy pointed out that I am using the terms "primary source" and "secondary source" incorrectly. The distinction I was trying to make was between direct and indirect claims.
I'm currently working on taking more effective notes using the Zettelkasten method and have encountered a challenge when dealing with claims attributed to secondary sources.
For example, academic articles typically contain numerous references to outside sources. Many of the claims discussed are not original but rather derived from these secondary sources.
My struggle is with how to properly document these secondary claims in my notes when I'm unfamiliar with the sources being referenced. I feel uncomfortable directly citing them. However, these claims are often relevant and interesting, and I want to include them in my Zettelkasten for future reference.
Here are some questions I have:
How do you approach taking notes on claims that are attributed to secondary sources when using the Zettelkasten method?
Do you cite the original source, the secondary source, or both in your notes?
How do you ensure accuracy and avoid misinterpretation when you're not directly familiar with the primary source?
Any strategies for efficiently exploring the primary sources when they seem particularly crucial to your understanding of the topic?
I’d appreciate any advice or strategies that have worked for you when navigating this aspect of academic note-taking. Thanks in advance!]]></summary>

 If this is simply not plausible in nano then I'm also up for alternative splash screen that can do this.

After a bit of trying out different configs I got it working with the OAuth 2.0 setup of my employer. 
 Now I'm trying to actually use it, but I find it somewhat unexpected; perhaps that's because I have used org-gcal for a while and was expecting something similar, i.e. synchronizing of the calendar entries into an org file which can be linked to my org-agenda (and calfw).
 For example, a very frequent occurrence is to schedule meetings with other people (in person). This generally works by everybody looking at their calendar to find a spot in e.g. the next week where all of us are available. Is this possible with Excorporate? To me it seems it's only possible to check the calendar entries for a given day (via M-x calendar, moving to the date, pressing d or e), but not get a list of all the events, or all the events in a week/month. 
 Furthermore, creating events seems to be possible via the API (https://github.com/emacsmirror/excorporate/blob/master/excorporate.info, chapter 6 API Usage), but this functionality is not exposed as an interactive function. Does that mean I have to write my own helper functions here? Has anybody done so already?
 Does anybody have experiences with excorporate for these use cases?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I primarily do scientific work in python with code-cells.el and the ipython REPL. I like this workflow but, since I'm a subpar programmer, I often end up with giant and disorganized scripts which are difficult to navigate. I eventually delete the cruft and refactor but I still end up spending a lot of time in this disorganized state. To improve navigation through the spaghetti, I thought maybe a table of contents could be made from the code-cell headers (i.e. "# %% Imports"). Does something like this already exist? Is there some other quick solution involving, e.g., code folding, bookmarks, imenu, etc.? 
 If there's no easy solution I thought this might be a good excuse to start playing with elisp and try implementing it myself. Any suggestions with respect to how to begin would be much appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I'm reading <Get Programming with Haskell> book on Manning MEAP website and have difficulties in understanding its chapter 21, titled "Hello World! - introducing IO types". In my opinion, it seems to give wrong information. Below is an example:
 "If main isn't a function, it should follow that neither is putStrLn. ... As you can see, the return type of putStrLn is IO(). Like main, putStrLn is an IO action because it violates our rule that function must return values."
 The author seemed to think "IO ()" isn't a value, which I don't agree with. So I googled and found the following on Haskell wiki https://wiki.haskell.org/Introduction_to_Haskell_IO/Actions:
 "PutStrLn takes an argument, but it is not an action. It is a function that takes one argument (a string) and returns an action of type IO (). So putStrLn is not an action, but putStrLn "hello" is."
 So I think the author is completely wrong on that, isn't it? On the other hand, however, I read lots of good reviews on the book on Amazon website. Am I misunderstanding something? Thanks for any confirmation or explanation.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Howdy. 
 I'm trying to write a util function to clean up org-agenda items. Specifically, if an agenda item has a SCHEDULED and DEADLINE with matching date+time I would like to remove the SCHEDULED property. Here's what I've come up with but though the messages indicate my logic is fine the changes are not being reflected in org-agenda view nor in the file where an item lives. Perhaps there's some save function I'm not calling to persist the changes?
 (defun local/org-remove-schedule-if-deadline-matches () "Remove SCHEDULED from agenda item if DEADLINE exists and matches." (interactive) (org-map-entries (lambda () (let ((scheduled (org-entry-get nil "SCHEDULED")) (deadline (org-entry-get nil "DEADLINE"))) (when (and deadline scheduled) (let ((scheduled-day (org-time-string-to-absolute scheduled)) (deadline-day (org-time-string-to-absolute deadline))) (when (= scheduled-day deadline-day) (message "removing SCHEDULED from task: \"%s\" in file %s" (org-get-heading t t t t) buffer-file-name) (org-entry-delete nil "SCHEDULED") (save-buffer)))))) nil 'agenda))

 https://gitlab.com/perikov/scala-bundles
 I tried this before ( https://github.com/p-pavel/osgi-scala ) wrapping every jar into a bundle, but I finally gave up.
 Everything is badly broken (split packages is the main problem).
 So I just taken a route on bundling releases ("everything related to org.typelevel/cats/n").
 I also have Karaf features with dependencies. 
 For it lets me to just type `feature:install myApp` and have relevant libraries from cats ecosystem (and also elastic4s and others) just install transparently from maven. 
 and `feature:uninstall` just unloads everything.
 I'm not sure if I have to put all this on maven (maven central requires packaging sources with jars, and my jars are just bundles containing relevant libs).
 Is there any interest on this topic?

Purely dropbox like which means it can sync files even if I open the files or not.
 Pull/merge when I open the file.

 My question is what "flavor" of emacs should i use that best fits my needs?
 All i ask is rich text, image viewing support, linking to other notes/files, hierarchical notes and optionally a GUI.
 I don't mind steep learning curves nor the specific type of rich text.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In Scala 2.13, and play-json, I used the following pattern to serialize/de-serialize between case classes and Json:
 import play.api.libs.json.{Format, Json} object WelcomeResult { implicit val format = Json.format[WelcomeResult] } case class WelcomeResult(service: String) 
 defining implicit formatin the companion object of the case class, made it easily visible from outside, so the following code worked without even requiring an extra import:
 val welcome = WelcomeResult("test") val json = Json.toJson(welcome) 
 In Scala 3 I saw the type class derivation feature and though I could take advantage of it by a. making the code more compact. b. defining such a default formatting only once in a generic way in the type class.
 This is the implementation I have in mind:
 case class WelcomeResult(service: String) derives JsonFormat
 And then something like this in JsonFormat:
 import play.api.libs.json.{Format, Json} trait JsonFormat[T] { val format: Format[T] } object JsonFormat { def derived[T](using scala.deriving.Mirror.Of[T]): JsonFormat[T] = { new JsonFormat[T]: override val format: Format[T] = Json.format[T] } } 
 But Json.format[T] fails with some "Instance not found: 'Conversion[T, _ <: Product]'" error. I guess, from other examples that I need a macro to implement the desired behavior, but not sure how.
 Any help appreciated.

So direct-style effects and monad effects can be seen as just two different syntaxes for writing the same thing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm untrained in music, but every bit of music theory I learn really increases my enjoyment of it. I wanted to learn to compose a bit, and the traditional method is counterpoint. So I did what any barely musically literate nerd would do: I started to write a program to verify that a counterpoint composition follows the rules when played against a given melody. Frankly it was an uphill battle. But finally, this weekend, I got it working.
 https://github.com/ludflu/counterpointer-report
 The main thing that stymied my earlier efforts was that I didn't understand the nature of musical intervals in a formal way. Every explanation I learned described it as a mathematically naive music student might require, which makes sense if I were trying to play the oboe or whatnot. Or, things would be explained in DSP terms, explaining how overtones work, etc. And that also makes sense, but....
 But what I really needed, was for someone to tell me that musical intervals are calculated using integers mod 12. Which actually makes a ton of sense when you think about how human's perceive relative pitch. Did you know that humans are the only animals we know of that perceive relative pitch? I'm pretty sure I learned that from David Huron's excellent book.
 Eventually I thought to ask someone over in /r/musictheory and things mostly worked out from there since I could use the Haskell modular-arithmetic library for the intervals, and Euterpea for representing notes and playing them via MIDI.
 Finally I had to hack around some broken stuff because Euterpea, though its a marvelous library, is not actively maintained and so needed some work to get it to run with modern Cabal. AND PortMIDI-haskell doesn't agree with Clang on OSX. But I was able to patch all those things locally to get everything running, and I submitted PRs to try and fix them up for everyone else.

        <updated>2024-08-05T00:42:11.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello fellow Emacs enthusiasts!
 I've noticed an interesting behavior difference between fill-paragraph in text-mode and org-fill-paragraph in org-mode, particularly when working with selected regions.
 Here's what I've observed:
  
In text-mode, fill-paragraph respects the selected region and only operates within it.
 In org-mode, org-fill-paragraph doesn't seem to respect the selected region and operates on the entire paragraph.
  
I've created a GIF to illustrate this difference:
 https://i.redd.it/7trbpcthrqgd1.gif
 I initially thought this was a bug and submitted a report, but it was determined not to be one.
 I'd like to open this up for community discussion to get your thoughts and insights.
 In org-mode, the behavior remains the same whether a region is selected or not. When no region is selected, I believe this behavior is appropriate.
 However, the issue arises when a user explicitly selects a region, expecting the fill operation to be limited to that selection.
 I think org-fill-paragraph should respect the selected region, similar to how fill-paragraph works in text-mode.
 What do you think about this behavior?
  
Update: Now that I've reviewed the org-fill-paragraph function documentation again, I understand the current behavior.
  
The REGION argument is non-nil if called interactively; in that
 case, if Transient Mark mode is enabled and the mark is active,
 fill each of the elements in the active region, instead of just
 filling the current element."
  
Unlike text-mode's fill-paragraph, org-fill-paragraph is designed to "fill each of the elements in the active region."
 The current behavior seems to be explained by this information.
 Thank you for your opinions!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fellow PKM enthusiasts,
I find myself caught in what seems to be a cyclical dilemma in the world of personal knowledge management, and I'm curious if others are experiencing the same.
My journey began with enthusiasm for local-first environments like Obsidian and Logseq. The promise of data ownership and flexibility was alluring. However, as time passed, I found myself gravitating back to cloud-based solutions.
Now, I'm feeling the pull towards local files and Markdown again. It's as if I'm caught in a perpetual swing between the convenience of the cloud and the freedom of local storage.
This pattern has me wondering:
Is this back-and-forth between local-first and cloud-based systems common in the PKM community?
For those who've made multiple switches, what ultimately made you settle on one approach (if you have)?
Are there solutions that effectively bridge this gap, offering the best of both worlds?
How do others manage the trade-offs between sync convenience and data sovereignty?
I'm starting to think this isn't just a fleeting concern, but a fundamental tension in how we approach PKM. The desire for true ownership of our data and the freedom to use multiple tools seems to persist, even after trying various solutions.
Has anyone else found themselves in this PKM pendulum? How have you reconciled these competing needs in your own systems?]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone, sorry I couldn't find a proper title for what I was looking for. what I want is a way for consult completion candidates to show a certain string when I'm selecting from the minibuffer but when the candidate is selected it should be the original form string.
 for example:
 ;; I have this list of paths that I want to select from (defvar paths '("/dir1/dir2/p1" "dir1/dir2/p2" "/dir1/dir2/p3")) ;; I want to parse those paths to only show the filename ;; in the minibuffer (consult--read (--map (file-name-nondirectory it) paths)) ;; the completion is supposed to be p1, p2, p3 ;; but when when I select I want the original path to be selected ;; for example /dir1/dir2/p1 
 I would do it using a hashmap or alist to map between the candidates and the selection.
 is there an easier way around this without using annotate function or marginalia ??

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This question is mostly to those of you, who love or enjoy Scala (or not, but still visit this sub) but don't get to use it at work, or use it only for Spark.
 Imagine that you're given a task of creating a mission critical component of your company's product. It would have to be a project deployed to the cloud, scalable, reliable, performant (but not extremely performant - jvm performance is fine). It will have to be maintained for years to come - by you, your team and your successors.
 Whatever you choose, you will have to recruit a team or train your coworkers - let's assume that they are mostly java users, good old spring booters, but they are not against the idea of learning a new language and paradigm.
 Would you choose Scala for such a project if given a choice? Do you feel confident that you'd be able to sell this idea to your manager? Do you believe that with Scala it would be cheaper to maintain or more profitable than with other languages? When would it become profitable - the recruitment / trainings would be more expensive surely, so would benefits of Scala become visible after weeks, months, years of maintaining the product, or never at all?

 I get that everyone has their own opinions about coding, but flinging insults like that? That’s just not right.
 Can we please cut the negative rhetoric and start being more welcoming to EVERYONE, regardless of their skill level or coding style?
 The /r/scala subreddit should be a safe space for every Scala user. Labeling other people's code as "trash" is not okay.
 That comment also fails to meet this community's rules of "decency" and "politeness." I'm very surprised that it received 20 upvotes.
 And can we please make full use of all the tools that reddit puts at our disposal? And let’s not turn a blind eye to this kind of behavior, we need to call it out. We can definitely do better. Thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all, this is a follow up post to this post with an amazing title.
 I am writing this so it doesn't just exist on my laptop and is documented somewhere. Maybe this is common knowledge, I did not find it anywhere.
 Basically, update from my end on the direction Monoidal -> Traversing is that there's a way to write
 monoidalToTraversing :: (Choice p, Monoidal p, Traversable f) => p a b -> p (f a) (f b) 
 we use a variation of Alexis King's construction
 data Traversal a r b = Done b | Yield a !(Traversal a r (r -> b)) deriving Functor instance Applicative (Traversal a r) where pure = Done Done f <*> a = f <$> a Yield a rToTf <*> ta = Yield a ((\ f b x -> f x b) <$> rToTf <*> ta) traversal :: Traversable t => t a -> Traversal a b (t b) traversal = traverse (\ a -> Yield a (Done id)) unTraversal :: (a -> b) -> Traversal a b tb -> tb unTraversal _ (Done tb) = tb unTraversal morph (Yield a fab) = unTraversal morph (fmap ($ morph a) fab) traversalP :: (Choice p, Monoidal p) => p a b -> p (Traversal a b x) (Traversal b b x) traversalP = dimap toEither fromEither . right' . (both <$> id <*> traversalP) where toEither :: Traversal a r b -> Either b (a, Traversal a r (r -> b)) toEither (Done x ) = Left x toEither (Yield a resume) = Right (a, resume) fromEither :: Either b (a, Traversal a r (r -> b)) -> Traversal a r b fromEither (Left x ) = Done x fromEither (Right (a, resume)) = Yield a resume monoidalToTraversing :: (Choice p, Monoidal p, Traversable f) => p a b -> p (f a) (f b) monoidalToTraversing = dimap traversal (unTraversal id) . traversalP 
 (I call both :: p a b -> p c d -> p (a,c) (b,d) to Monoidal's idiomatic class function) the other direction (Traversing -> Monoidal) needs some other kind of ideas which I am not having so far.
 Remaining questions:
  
What about the other direction?
 How to do this for Traversing1? It shouldn't use Choice, because Either a is not a Traversable1
 What are the implications?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Two dummy examples, both Scala 2.12. 
 First example - sequence of Foo[t <: T], and I want some function to use that t somehow. Pseudocode-ish:
 ``` type A <: T type B <: T
 trait Foo[t <: T]
 object Foo1 extends Foo[A]
 objet Foo2 extends Foo[B]
 def someFunc[t <: T](foo: Foo[t]): Unit = { somethingThatKnowsHowToTakeTypes[t].foobar }
 Seq( Foo1, Foo2 ).map(someFunc) ```
 This leads to type erasure concerns, even though to me it seems obvious that that Sequence is of a type where each object inside is a Foo of some concrete type that fits the constraints. I can get around it by introducing some wrapper case class that I can stick Foo1 and Foo2 into, which retains it's type as an explicit member. And then inside someFunc I have to manually use that type member explicitly. Feels clunky and it feels like something I'm tricking the compiler into doing. Not to mention at some point I did get it to compile, only to fail at runtime if I didn't create the correct implicit typetag in scope.
 Second example:
 Sequence of (Foo[t <: T], Bar[t <: T]), and Bar/Foo have methods that operate on or return t <: T. I store in a 2-tuple because inside a lambda I want to do something like Foo.read(...).map(Bar.transform) where Foo.read returns something typed by t and Bar.transform takes something subtyped by t. I assume since I pair them up in a 2-tuple, the Seq of these such objects could recognize that it's some paired object, but instead the compiler complains about expected vs supplied types.

 How can I enable copy/yank from some text from my Mac browser into emacs buffer on the terminal and also vice versa. 
 I tried clipetty and it works when I yank something from emacs buffer and paste on Mac but not the other way around. Also it does not work at all when using tmux. 
 Appreciate any suggestions!!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I need to find the nth prime number. This is what I have so far:
 module Prime (nth) where nth :: Int -> Maybe Integer nth n | n < 1 = Nothing | otherwise = Just ([x | x <- [2..n], isPrime x] !! (n-1)) isPrime :: Int -> Bool isPrime 2 = True isPrime n | n < 2 = False |otherwise = all (map (\x -> n `mod` x /= 0)) [2..root] where root = (floor . sqrt . fromIntegral) n 
 Some of the errors I get are (seems that both functions are wrong):
 Couldn't match expected type ‘Integer’ with actual type ‘Int’ • In the expression: x In the first argument of ‘(!!)’, namely ‘[x | x <- [2 .. n], isPrime x]’ In the first argument of ‘Just’, namely ‘([x | x <- [2 .. n], isPrime x] !! (n - 1))’Couldn't match expected type Couldn't match type ‘[Bool]’ with ‘Bool’ Expected: [Int] -> Bool Actual: [Int] -> [Bool] • In the first argument of ‘all’, namely ‘(map (\ x -> n `mod` x /= 0))’Couldn't match type ‘[Bool]’ with ‘Bool’ Expected: [Int] -> Bool Actual: [Int] -> [Bool] • In the first argument of ‘all’, namely ‘(map (\ x -> n `mod` x /= 0))’ 
 The second error is not really clear for me, I thought that all returns Bool (a -> Bool) -> [a] -> Bool), why would it be [Bool]? Also, any hint for the first function? Thank you.
 EDIT:
 Correct solution:
 module Prime (nth) where nth :: Int -> Maybe Integer nth n | n < 1 = Nothing | otherwise = Just (toInteger ([x | x <- [2..], isPrime x] !! (n-1))) isPrime :: Int -> Bool isPrime n = null [x | x <- [2..n-1], n `mod` x == 0]

 Both ways, the python:getting command in ubuntu are highlighted with org-document-title face, so I think (I could be wrong) that org-mode parses both way alright(or is it font-lock and parser behave differently?). but the space will make that huge difference to org-roam-find-node

I am attempting to use org-ql-defpred with org-ql-query, and because I do not quite have a handle on what I am doing yet (I am far from an elisp expert, but don't mind stretching my boundaries), I am trying to stick pretty close to the Org QL Custom Predicates Tutorial for now.
 Something that works exactly as I want, but lacks the flexibility of the predicate-based approach, is the following (with org-super-agenda):
  (setq org-agenda-custom-commands '(("A" . "Agendas") ("Aj" "John" ((org-ql-block '(tags "#John") ((org-ql-block-header "John")))))

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My main gripe are
  
I'm not always logged into reddit, and when I click a reddit link, it produces some fake security error, and tells me I'm not logged in or I should use my developer token. I'm not sure why reddit has started to do this, but does it have something to do a desire to monetize it it more, and may even have something to do with AI. It seems reddit has also signed some exclusive deal with Google allowing only Google to index it.
 
The way Reddit know handles blocking by other users. Sometime ago I began to notice that so many responses had some error like deleted and unavailable. Something I remarked on in this thread - Why do some reddit users especially on r/emacs keep messing up threads their involved by deleting their posts or making them unavailable? I don't see why some people should disrupt a technical discussion by blocking some participants who can't see what is going. It is not as though this Twitter or Facebook, this is simply a technical forum and the discussions don't often veer into the political. What kind of mindset does it take to block someone because you don't want them to read your views on technical issues, and it is not as though the person blocked cannot login using another account to see the thread?
 
 These two issues are making this forum less appealing. Perhaps I should use stackexchange more instead.

I realized that I needed a better way to hold on to and integrate all the new ideas I was finding — which led me to a new rabbit hole of Zettelkasten and trying to understand the philosophies and processes behind it.
Many of my web searches would lead me to thoughtful discussions on this forum, so I thought I'd tag along and try to absorb your collective knowledge!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For years (I use AoC as way to get familiar with new languages I add to my trophy collection), I've been used to that naive solutions for AoC2015/4 (iterate over numbers, conver to string, concatenate with prefix, hash, convert to hex, check n zero prefix, repeat) take 'too long'.
 The first optimization was to figure out how to pre-hash the prefix (in some languages/libs, copying the state is not as straightforward as calling a method).
 Second was not converting a number to string, but incrementing a byte array (or mutable string) representation of the number.
 The last is to re-use a buffer for the resulting hash, ideally not converted to hex, and to directly check the first few bytes (and perhaps 4 bits) to be zero.
 Usually, all this got me a speed-up of at least 10x.
 What totally shocked me was that the naive implementation finished in less then five seconds (I expected roughly a minute), and that further optimizations got it down only to under three seconds.

 my cabal.project and each name.cabal have the following ghc-options:
 program options/library ghc-options: -no-hs-main -optl-mexec-model=reactor "-optl-Wl" 
 something I noticed is that if I run build using --verbose , the call to wasm32-wasi-ghc doesn't have any of the ghc-options I've set. Maybe it's got something to do with the `Setup.hs`? but that file just has the usual:

 recently I've had some trouble with Doom Emacs crashing unexpectedly and I've been trying to troubleshoot today with research and chatgpt.
 I found on r/DoomEmacs a similar thread where an Arch user was experiencing the same thing while editing C++ files while mine was mostly happening when editing Rust files. I don't have much to go on but my assumption was that when the rust-analyzer was working or Rust LSP was communicating it was causing it to panic and crash but this was just an assumption and I was having trouble getting much out of --debug-init. This user was able to downgrade to version 29.3 and it solved their problems.
 Recently I've completely uninstalled rust, emacs and doom emacs and found wayland-emacs on the aur which I didn't notice last time. I've reinstalled Rust and now I'm going to attempt to install this AUR package and go from there. Another issue I was having was opening Fish shell in Doom Emacs with Term which wasn't an issue before until installing Rust.
 It's also important to note that I've had this Arch + Hyprland install for about 2 weeks and Doom Emacs hasn't given any issues what so ever until installing rust and rust-analyzer but also I upgraded around the same time and I know there was an upgrade 2 days ago. Thanks for reading, I wanted to try and be thorough so I apologize for the length of this.
 P.S The user on Arch I was talking about with a similar issue was using X11
 EDIT: solved, I use the pacaman package manager to uninstall emacs-wayland and installed emacs instead. So far rust hasn't crashed when editing or coding rs files in doom and rust-analayzer is working. Must install with rustup component add rust-analyzer though, not your package manager. and using vterm this time with no issues.. yet ;)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm new to Scala. I'm writing some performance-sensitive code for processing objects on several axes. My actual code is more complicated and handles more axes, but it's structured like this:
 class Processor: xData: Data yData: Data zData: Data def process(axis: Axis) = axis match case X => doStuff(xData) case Y => doStuff(yData) case Z => doStuff(zData) 
 But it is a bit repetitive, and it's easy to make a typo and use the wrong data object. Ideally, I'd like to write something like this
 class Processor: data: HashMap[Axis, Data] def process(axis: Axis) = doStuff(data(axis)) 
 Unfortunately, this code has different performance and correctness characteristics:
  
It's possible for me to forget to initialize Data for some of the axes. In a language like TypeScript I could type the field as Record<Axis, Data>, which would check at compile time that keys for all axes are initialized. But I'm not sure if it's possible in Scala.
 Accessing the map requires some hashing and dispatching. However fast they may be, my code runs millions of times per second, so I want to avoid this and really get the same performance as accessing the field directly.
  
Is it possible to do something like this in Scala?
 Thanks!

My job involves switching computers pretty frequently, and so I have everything set up with use-package's :ensure keyword so I can just clone my init.el to a new machine, and Emacs will download all my packages automatically. In general, this works great; the exception is org. 
 Any kind of :ensure form doesn't work with installing the latest revision of org (afaik), because the pre-installed version shadows it; use-package uses package-installed-p to decide if a package isn't installed and needs to be downloaded, and since org is always installed, no download will ever trigger. This is fine, up until you want something from a later version of org.

 First off, I am aware of `org-depend` and `org-edna` as well as the `ORDERED` property. I am trying to find a way to make them work for a common, but specific type of dependency.
 Task Dependencies
 As defined in this [blog page][1] from the 'projectmanager.com' website, a Gantt chart will define 4 types of dependency. I find two of them essential in my task management workflow.
 Finish to finish
 The first one, and most commn I think, is the **finish-to-finish dependency** which is the one I believe is covered by org-mode; this is also the easiest to enforce (again imho) programatically with orgmode tools. Task A cannot be marked as `DONE` before task B and C are.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I've been diving into the world of algebraic effects systems as an alternative to mtl-style classes for granular effect tracking. One thing I haven't quite figured out yet is how to handle errors in the middle of a computation that uses a custom effect type. For example, let's say I have an effect for talking to the database:
  data DB :: Effect where DBWrite :: Item -> DB m () DBRead :: Key -> DB m (Maybe Item) 
 and types for errors and the database environment
 ``` data DBError = DeadLockError | ConnectionError
 data DBEnv = DBEnv Connection ```
 and let's say I have the interpreter:
  runDBIO :: (IOE :> es, Error DBError :> es) => DBEnv -> Eff (DB : es) a -> Eff es a runDBIO env = interpret \_ -> \case ... do handling here ... 
 Now the recommended way to instrument all of this is to wire up all of your effect handlers at the start of your program:
  main = do env <- getDbEnv result <- runEff . runError @DBError . runDBIO env $ program case result of Left -> ... do something ... Right -> ... do something ... 
 This all makes sense. But what if I want to handle the error at a deeper level in the program and not at the very top level? The Error DBError effect doesn't manifest in the type list until the runDBIO interpreter is applied. For example,
  tryWriteDBOrSendEmailPage :: Item -> Eff [Email, DB] () tryWriteDBOrSendEmailPage item = do catchError (dbWrite item) $ \_ e -> emailPage $ "Something went wrong: " ++ (show e) return () 
 This doesn't work here because the type signature doesn't contain Error DBError, but the underlying implementation of DB uses it. If I add Error DBError to the effect list, wouldn't that be a totally separate effect from DB, so it wouldn't be able to throw and catch in the same context? Should I manually expose effects for TryDBWrite and TryDBRead that return an Either? Not exactly sure what to do here.

I find it more convenient than the HTML versions.
 This is done by running make pdf.
 However, these PDFs don't have hyperlinks or clickable TOC.
 Only the major manuals released here, like the GNU Emacs Manual, the GNU Emacs Lisp Reference Manual and An Introduction to Programming in Emacs Lisp seem to offer that functionality.
 Any idea how to get it done for all the other manuals?
 EDIT:
 Problem solved. I overlooked that the hyperlinks work fine. They're just not highlighted.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi Everyone l,
 I have a somewhat weird scenario. I have been invited for a code review interview round with a company that works primarily on scala and a bit on Java. I am a Java resource and have never worked on scala before but they have told me that they are okay to hire people with Java knowledge as they have a pretty decent upskilling plan. However the code review is on a scala code. My question is as a senior Java dev how can I deal with this. I was thinking I will brush up on a few core concepts of functional programming and monads. Anything else you guys suggest. The recruiter said that they ofcourse know that I have never worked on scala so I will be judged accordingly but I am sure there will still be some stuff that I can do.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During the closing of bug#71801 a Windows build was uploaded to the GNU FTP which was shipped with libgccjit-0.dll. If that DLL is present, then Emacs will try to native compile the 3rd party packages. If it fails to do so then it will throw an error, and it will stop loading the 3rd party packages. One user complained on the mailing list about this, and a new release was uploaded to the GNU FTP without this DLL.
 The issue is that the Windows package managers already downloaded and hashed the build with libgccjit-0.dll the first time it was uploaded. Winget had a hash mismatch, but should be fixed since then. Chocolatey does not know about the new file, and it will download the build with libgccjit-0.dll in it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[SOLVED: eshell-highlight-prompt being set to nil caused the behavior. Setting to true fixes the issue, which makes me wonder why the setting is used in the repository at all.
 I am excited to start using Eshell after reading about it on Mastering Emacs. Since I wasn't happy with default prompt, I installed the eshell-prompt-extras package like the article recommended. However, if I continue pressing backspace, my prompt and previous shell output can be deleted, which is not the correct behavior.
 I understand eshell-prompt-regexp has to match the prompt and I think it does because C-a takes me to the correct place after the prompt. Since Eshell doesn't use comint-mode, I don't know of a function to make the prompt read-only. Is there any way to achieve the desired behavior?
 My Eshell prompt customization settings are copied and pasted from https://github.com/zwild/eshell-prompt-extras:

I'm not actually sure how the popularity metric is derived, but I think it's based on users who indicated that they had "done extensive development work in over the past year". Scala is at 2.6% of all respondents, slightly down from 2.77% last year. Among respondents who are professional developers it's 2.9%, down from 3.21% last year. Among those still learning to code it's 1.7%, way up from 0.77% last year.
 If I had to put some flavor on these numbers I'd say Scala is still at the top of the long tail of languages. It comes in about 20th among programming languages (ie. I ignored SQL, HTML, bash, etc.) so certainly still relevant. Movement from last year is negligible except for new developers, which is very cool.

Before I read a new book, I'm interested in how it relates to the books I've read so far. To get an initial overview, I simply create a new Reference Note for the book in my Zettelkasten. It consists of a brief description of the book and a few references to existing notes.
When I quickly look through the bibliography, I find these references. They are links to books that I have already read or to books that are on my reading list. These are simply added to link the Reference Note. The graphical overview is generated automatically by the Zettelkasten tool.

The resulting literature map helps to provide an initial overview. By adding a few details, the map becomes somewhat easier to read as a concept map.

The concept map will be refined further. Quotations and ideas from the existing 'Reference Notes' make the 'Bibliographic Map' easier to read. It now offers a good overview that facilitates the overall understanding of this bibliographic network.

 This is roughly based on `lucid-htmx`, but is different enough that I think it can be considered stand alone and not a fork. Notable differences:
  
Not using the old `data` based tags
 New type-safe interfaces for various htmx enumerations
 Module structure tries to follow some htmx concepts (like core and extra attributes)
 Significant documentation
 Additional attributes that didn't exist in `lucid-htmx`
  
I am going to try and stay active on the issue tracker, and keep this package up to date with new GHC indexes. Hope this is useful to some of you.

 How can I use orgmode to get citations in the form
 Smith, Wu, …, Miller (2023) Nature
 i.e. First Author, Second Author, ..., Last Author (year) Journal
 (This is my preferred form to cite things in presentations in life science field.)
 I am having a hard time reading the corresponding section in the manual trying to extract the necessary information.
 Ideally, I could dynamically decide on how many authors to cite 'at each end'.
 Any solution using CSL or biblatex as drivers would be highly appreciated!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In my notes collection I use org-publish to create a nice personal website out of org-roam files. I have an index file that programmatically lists posts in categories, with tags, or in alphabetical indices. I do this via macros that expand into dynamic blocks and run all dynamic blocks during export via a source block near the bottom of the page.
 It's slow. Real slow. I do all the post link lookups using org-roam, so I assume that's just sqlite db queries. Then I use very minimal org syntax to turn it into links.
 I realised recently that I could probably do the same thing via exported source code block results, since I only need all this stuff during export.
 Is there a noticeable performance difference between org-babel exporting the results of some Lisp code, and that same Lisp code being used via dynamic blocks?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Given a frame with various windows in it, I want to be able to write text into them without them being associated with a file, and I don't want to spam buffers into the buffer list. I was thinking that having a single "log buffer" into which the messages would be written would prevent buffer spamming, and then I could just show the operator a different particular message in each window. Playing around with different things, trying to use indirect buffers with some sort of region narrowing seemed to be a good possible option.
 I didn't have much luck with this though:
  (let ((org-dates (list "2020-04-05" "2023-08-02" "2021-09-08" "2019-08-04"))) (delete-other-windows) (split-window-right) (split-window-right) (split-window-right) (balance-windows) (dolist (earlier-journal-entry org-dates) (pop-to-buffer (make-indirect-buffer (get-buffer-create "*Org Roam Daily Reflection Log*") (generate-new-buffer-name "*indirect*"))) (let* ((start (point)) (org-msg (concat "\n\n* No daily journal entry for " earlier-journal-entry "."))) (insert org-msg) ;; (org-mode) (narrow-to-region start (point))))) 
 In particular, the narrowing doesn't seem to work right. How should I be doing narrowing?
 (If this is at all the right sort of approach to this task.)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I want to rebind 'q' (normal-state) in org-agenda. The actual keybind that is finally applied seems to be defined by evil-org-agenda minor mode (how do I tell?).
 I tried:
 (map!
 :mode org-agenda-mode
 :map general-override-mode-map
 :n
 "q" 'org-agenda-exit)
 The idea being ":mode org-agenda-mode" will make sure that the keybind is set only in that mode and "map general-override-mode-map" should override any possible high priority keymap.
 This does not work.

 During upgrade to scala 3, a code involving reads/writes to json, raises a "Ambiguous given instances" error which I'm not sure how to solve.
 It only happens when trying to serialize a Seq of a type, not the type itself.
 Here's a Scastie to demonstrate:

 any guidance appreciated

containers
 mtl
 transformers
 singletons
 singletons-base
 parsec
  
Nevertheless, since I'm using ghc-wasm-meta, I cannot really include the singletons-base package (since it depends on th-orphans and the WASM backend doesn't support TH yet).
 I might be able to patch things up, if I can just expand the TH definitions in the singletons-base package, but I don't really know how to do this without just forking the repo, running cabal build with -ddump-splices -ddump-to-file flags, and manually deleting the _XXXX identifiers.
 Is there a better way to do this?

        <updated>2024-07-30T10:51:24.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have tried doing
 (setq-default indent-tabs-mode t)
 (setq-default tab-width 4)
 (defvaralias 'c-basic-offset 'tab-width)
 (setq ruby-indent-tabs-mode t)
 (defvaralias 'ruby-indent-level 'tab-width)
 (defvaralias 'sgml-basic-offset 'tab-width)
 But it doesn't work. This leads to tabs just being composed of 4 spaces, not one tab. Similar to the neovim editor, I want tabs to be just tabs. One large block, instead of being packed with several tiny spaces. I need this for indentation. Relying on tabs to be just full of spaces is impossible for me. Can anyone help. I have tried several solutions, but they all are just solutions which means tabs will be filled with 'x' no of spaces. not tabs with TABS. I am new to Emacs, and I have heard this whole tab business is not very straightforward. So please do explain if I got something wrong
 EDIT - I got the solution from this kind soul on stackoverflow https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6471803/making-emacs-tabs-behave-exactly-like-vims
 (eval-after-load "cc-mode" '(define-key c-mode-map (kbd "TAB") 'self-insert-command)) (global-set-key (kbd "DEL") 'backward-delete-char) (setq c-backspace-function 'backward-delete-char) 
 This treats tabs as one large tab. You can have the same control as neovim. It also deletes the entire tabs via the single backspace. I am not sure if this is gonna work with javascript. But I hope this post will help others
 This is all I have put in my init.el file related to tabs
 (setq-default indent-tabs-mode t) (setq-default tab-width 4) (defvaralias 'c-basic-offset 'tab-width) (setq ruby-indent-tabs-mode t) (defvaralias 'ruby-indent-level 'tab-width) (defvaralias 'sgml-basic-offset 'tab-width) (eval-after-load "cc-mode" '(define-key c-mode-map (kbd "TAB") 'self-insert-command)) (global-set-key (kbd "DEL") 'backward-delete-char) (setq c-backspace-function 'backward-delete-char)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Greetings,
 I am trying to make use of the "wuss" secure websockets library, at https://hackage.haskell.org/package/wuss. This adds TLS to the underlying websockets library.
 I can build and install the library fine with GHC 9.8.2, and the sample client at https://github.com/tfausak/wuss also builds fine. However, when I go to run it, it fails as follows:
 dyld[44192]: missing symbol called
 In this case, 44192 is just the PID. I tried using otool to see if there is a missing dynamic library, but I believe this shows that there is no missing library as such. Most likely, the "missing symbol" means that the library that is used, doesn't have something that is called. However, the error doesn't specify the issue there.
 otool -L ./dist-newstyle/build/aarch64-osx/ghc-9.8.2/wussTest-0.1.0.0/x/wussTest/build/wussTest/wussTest

 I've been struggling with a strictness/laziness issue in a recursive mini-language I've been trying to define. I'll present a pruned version here to narrow the code to the focus of my issue. 
 I can encode my problem with 5 combinators:
 haskell data Recur t a = Val a -- ^ A stored value | Hop t -- ^ A jump-to-binding statement | Seq [Recur t a] -- ^ A sequence of 'Recur' statements | Opt [Recur t a] -- ^ A choice of 'Recur' statements | Bnd t (Recur t a) (Recur t a) -- ^ An introduce-binding statement deriving Eq makeBaseFunctor ''Recur 
 Then I can define recursive sequences like this:
 ```haskell type R = Recur Text Int
 x12, x34 :: R x12 = Seq [Val 1, Val 2] x34 = Seq [Val 3, Val 4]
 n1, n2, n3 :: R n1 = Opt [x12, x34] n2 = Seq [n1, n1] n3 = Bnd "x" n1 (Seq [Hop "x", H…]]></summary>

It can take months to understand what its being done and the process usually feels like trying to take some random file reading it, trying to look its dependencies back and forth until you finally make some sense out of those. Could this process be eased if every file was accompanied by some org file? And could a master org file tell "Hey this is how you should begin reading the source code"

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm looking for project ideas for a final assignment in a college course using a functional language. We primarily used Haskell, but we're open to other functional languages if the project is interesting.
 The project should take around two weeks for two advanced software engineering students, so it should have some complexity (but not too much). Preferably it should use a monadic strategy to solve a problem.
 I've already built a compiler in a previous course, so I'd prefer not to go that route again. I was considering creating a SAT solver, but one of our teachers mentioned it involves a lot of state management, so I'm unsure if it's the best fit.
 Any suggestions or advice would be greatly appreciated!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have quite a few projects and meeting and i keep track of them by using columnview dynamic block to show them in the project (each meeting has a property which points to the project and :match searches for the property). Columview has an option to add Links (so i just need to click on it and see what has been discussed). But this link feature doesnt work if the item are in a different file. 
 So when capturing a meeting with org-capture i just created another property like:
 :LINK: [[file:~/org/meetings.org::*%\1][%\1]]
 which is essentially a link to itself, where %\1 is the Meeting Title and the org headline and add this Property to the columnview. That way i can click on it form a project and see what the meeting was about.
 Now the Problem: the headline might not be unique (e.g. weekly repeating meeting) and there for i thought it might be a better idea to use a custom_id for example. So i tried to use a capture template like this:
 * %^{Meeting}
 :PROPERTIES:
 :PROJECT:
 :ATTENDEE:
 :LINK: [[file:~/org/meetings.org::*%\1][%\1]
 :CUSTOM_ID: %<%Y%m%d%H%M%S>-%(string-replace " " "-" "%\\1")
 :LINK2: [[id:%<%Y%m%d%H%M%S>-%(replace-regexp-in-string "\s" "-" "%\\1")][%\1]]
 :ID: %(org-id-new)
 :END:
 I try to replace the whitespace in the headline as this would be no valid ID. But that doesnt work it gets evaluated but the whitespaces are not replaced. i could reuse :ID: aswell but dont know how in a capture template. Ideas??

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm finding the `._` import so confusing and this is heavily used by the Scala community. My main issue is, given that you have multiple `._` imports it's difficult to reason about the origin of the thing you're using or what is available to be used.
 For those that have been using Scala for a long time, this improves over time and do you have this same feeling?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been working on a project, and I've recently hit a devops-ish kind of issue: after getting ghc-wasm through nix flakes, I'm trying to compile the project by: wasm32-wasi-cabal build WASM --flags="wasm", but I get errors building happy and th-orphans.
 happy error:
  Configuring executable 'happy' for happy-1.20.1.1... Preprocessing executable 'happy' for happy-1.20.1.1... Building executable 'happy' for happy-1.20.1.1... wasm32-wasi-ghc-9.6.4: could not execute: /nix/store/70jynsvi21a9lm46n82yvvqfh15fdlra-wasm32-wasi-ghc-9.6/lib/wasm32-wasi-ghc-9.6.4/lib/bin/unlit 
 th-orphans error:
 ``` Configuring library for th-orphans-0.13.14... Preprocessing library for th-orphans-0.13.14... Building library for th-orphans-0.13.14... [1 of 2] Compiling Language.Haskell.TH.Instances.Internal ( src/Language/Haskell/TH/Instances/Internal.hs, dist/build/Language/Haskell/TH/Instances/Internal.o ) [2 of 2] Compiling Language.Haskell.TH.Instances ( src/Language/Haskell/TH/Instances.hs, dist/build/Language/Haskell/TH/Instances.o )
 <no location info>: error: Couldn't find a target code interpreter. Try with -fexternal-interpreter ```
 Regarding the happy error, although there is no unlit executable in that folder, there is one called wasm32-wasi-unlit, so I believe some sort of symlink can solve this, but I have no idea on how to include this in the flakes.nix file.
 Regarding the th-orphans error, I'm totally clueless.
 P.D: don't mind too much about stack in the flakes, it's there because I wanted to make sure that the other executable compiles normally.

 I have a very long list, with many subnested lists (think of it as a tree), and as of now it's currently 6000 ish elements.
 before you say why such a big list it's stuff I want to buy, it's a way to autocontrol..
 whenever I C-c C-c on anything, that be a checkbox or a counting box (the [/], idk the proper name), it takes a lot, like a good two minutes at least.
 i tried to profiling, and it seems taht org-element--list-struct in memory section is the biggest one, with match-data in cpu, but the latter it's only a 6%. I can post the full profiling if it can help, but from my (poor) understanding of the profiling reoprt, these two are what takes longer. is there a way i can improve the performance? or do I have to split it down into smaller lists? i have such giant single list because I like to have at the top two boxes that one is the percentage and the other one is the counting one. if there is a way to divide the list into the various categories, maybe with *s, while keeping an overall "completion" on the top, that would solve the issue.
 tl;dr i have a giant list. can i improve the performance? I just chronometered it, and it clocked it at around five minutes. or, if I break it down to more smaller lists, is there a way I can keep track of the overall progress?

Changes since v2.15.7:
 Behavior changes:
  
Stack uses the version of the Cabal package that comes with the specified version of GHC. Stack no longer supports such Cabal versions before 2.2, which came with versions of GHC before 8.4. Consequently, the init command will not try LTS Haskell before 12.0.
 The init command initialises stack.yaml with a snapshot key rather than a resolver key.
 After installing GHC or another tool, Stack deletes the archive file which provided the tool.

 Elfeed with date column
 However, when I run my elfeed search screen in Spacemacs, I don't see the date listed.
 Elfeed without date column
 Is there a specific configuration variable that I need to change? I looked through the elfeed docs, but I did not find any references to this.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I have a pretty good working setup for completions, but there is one annoyance that I haven't figured out how to change. I'm writing both python and rust, and my issue is that when I select a completion for a function name or class, it always puts opening and closing parenthesis after it, automatically. Meaning, I type:
 my_obj.beginning_of_metho
 and it (corfu) gives me the option:
 beginning_of_method
 I select it, and what it inserts is:
 my_obj.beginning_of_method(argname1, argname2)
 Which is right 80% of the time, and infuriating that 20% of the time that I needed to pass that bare function somewhere. Its more annoying with class names, it puts parens in when I'm just trying to make a type hint. 
 I've seen this behavior with rust-analyzer, jedi-language-server and pyright, so I don't think its server specific, and I've seen it with lsp-mode and eglot so I don't think its specific to those modes. I'm using corfu, but I haven't figured out a switch in corfu to change this behavior.
 The ideal behavior in my opinion would be when I select the method name, it inserts just that:
 my_obj.beginning_of_method
 And then if I type an open paren
 my_obj.beginning_of_method(
 At that point it would insert the args with the closing paren.
 my_obj.beginning_of_method(argname1, argname2)
 Has anyone else figured out how to do this? I can't be the only person annoyed by this behavior.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I know this may be the wrong place to ask… but let’s give a try. I have some complex objects in my code, by complex I mean that they describe “actions” and they have an impact, may have preconditions, and may have incompatibilities. All these elements are maps from the same set of keys to to integer values. And these values may be 0, 1… or max-1, max (where max is maximum value) They are now described in my Scala code, but would like to give some SME, non programmers, the ability to modify them. I must say that the I find the Scala code reasonably easy to read, but probably will be error prone. From a usability perspective do you have any experience on what would work better? - Teach some Scala (case classes mostly) - Build a DSL - Provide a GUI
 Thanks!

 When I try same with `git worktree add -f ../new-work-tree main` is it able to create directory and checkout just fine.

 Also side-note: I see these "file missing" errors also when using other modes. Wondering if there any variables I can set to make it default behavior everywhere.

 Some of the tabs are red some are don't. What might be the problem here?

 How would you debug cases like this? 
 Typically, in java, I just add a breakpoint or at least add logs. I'm not sure how to do this in scala.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am relatively new to using `elfeed`. I used it years ago, then I forgot about it for a while, and recently came back.
 So I was wondering about the current best way to filter the posts by tags, so that I can focus on specific groups of posts instead of the entire stream. I was looking at Mike Zemansky's approach to filter the posts using a hydra and a macro. It looks pretty good, and I was working towards that. However, I realized that this approach was 7 years old. 
 Hence, I was wondering if there are any better or improved ways to filter posts today, that were not referenced in Mike Zemansky's post? I believe in his code, emacs looks for all unique tags in the total feed, defines shortcut or hydra keys, and finally creates a hydra that the user can use to search for those posts. So it seems simple and nice. 
 But as I said, I was not sure if there was a package to do this now, or do I have to write that code myself in my `.spacemacs` file. Any suggestions are welcome.

However, for a large repository that I am currently using, switching between branches or refreshing the magit refs buffer takes a minute or more on a modern macbook, and emacs gets hung up for a long time. The output after magit-toggle-verbose-refresh shows the largest time consuming operation
 magit-insert-tags 50.73 
 I tried to disable it with
 (remove-hook 'magit-status-sections-hook 'magit-insert-tags) 
 in init.el however I get a completely blank magit refs buffer after that, and plus I don't want to disable it for all repositories. I also tried including
 ((magit-status-mode . ((eval . (magit-disable-section-inserter 'magit-insert-tags))))) ((magit-refs-mode . ((eval . (magit-disable-section-inserter 'magit-insert-tags))))) 
 in the .dir-locals.el file but that didn't have any effect.
 I am wondering how I could disable magit-insert-tags while also displaying the branches. I am inclined towards repository specific rather than an init.el solution.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to move away from using bespoke query building logic in a Haskell service at work. My impression from surveying some of the popular options (Beam, Persistent, Opaleye...) is that while they have tools to pull schemas and synchronize with your database, they still require you to manually declare types corresponding to tables. 
 This Haskell service is however one of many accessing the database and the schema changes somewhat frequently, so manually keeping types in sync isn't ideal. In the parts of our codebase that are written in TypeScript we use libraries like prisma and prisma-kysely to generate type definitions and the experience has been pretty good. 
 Is there anything like this in the Haskell space? My hope is that I wouldn't need to manually edit type definitions if someone else at the company adds a table or changes a column somewhere in the DB.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Basically, I've stayed at my job for 6 years. In my country there were at some point max 3 - 4 companies using Scala, even not full time, and now it is even rarer. When I got my first interview for a international remote job I had about 1.5 years of Scala experience, but 4 years total experience. I went pretty far but didn't get it because lack of experience. After that, I've had up to a dozen of these kinds of interviews, for a remote international team, but I never managed to get a job. Now finally I have found a new job but it is not a great project and not what I want.
 I am not the most enthusiastic person when it comes always being up to date and reading blogs and stuff and also for the past years, I have not been a person who got assigned to the more complex stuff in my company. Otherwise I have a pretty good basis for algorithms and coding challenges (although I failed the last one which was live coding using lots of Scala generics).
 Now, it seems to me that when recruiting for a remote team, especially for a senior position, the stands for a Scala developer are pretty high and the projects are not simple (relatively, like more distributed stuff).
 Does anyone have more insights how this compares to other languages. A lot of people that I know which I wold think were at my level as a developer or even sub, got remote jobs or jobs away from my country, and I am feeling stuck. I keep wondering if it would have been easier to find this kind of remote job if i stayed with C# or moved to Java, and not due to lack of opportunities in the Scala world....

 Update...
 I ended up just overriding the function org-margin-mode-on by removing the piece that threw the error. Not sure if this is a particularly good idea, but everything seems fine for now.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm pretty new to Haskell, enjoying developing a web app using Scotty, but I'm struggling to figure out how I can launch (background) async IO operations.
 For example, let's say I have a handle function:
 ```haskell longBackgroundIOStuff :: IO () ...
 handleSomething :: ActionM () handleSomething conn = do my_param :: String <- pathParam "my_param" -- I want to start this running liftIO $ longBackgroundIOStuff -- and then immediately respond to the client a redirect redirect "/" ```
 But then it has to wait for the longBackgroundIOStuff before redirect. If I put the redirect before the IO operation the IO operation never runs. I've also tried craziness like.
 ``` import Control.Concurrent.Async (concurrently_)
 handleSomething :: ActionM () handleSomething conn = do liftIO $ concurrently_ (liftIO $ longBackgroundIOStuff) (return (redirect "/")) ```
 But then the redirect never gets back to the client.
 I don't need to return anything related to the longBackgroundIOStuff, I just want it to start running in the background and keep running until it's done. 
 Using express with node I could just do something like this:
 js app.get('/', (req, res) => { longAsyncIOFunction(); res.redirect('/') }); 
 What would be the best way to accomplish this with Scotty? Thanks so much and sorry if this isn't the best forum for these kinds of questions.

 funSpecialized :: (C t, Int ~ D t) => t -> Int -> [Int] funSpecialized t initial = _
 instance C () where type D () = Int transform _ i = _
 {-# RULES "specialize\Int" forall x y. funGeneric x y = funSpecialized x y #-} ```
 and then, for instance:
  someFun :: Int -> IO () someFun initial = print $ funGeneric () initial 
 where I'd expect funGeneric to be re-written to funSpecialized The rule itself type-checks, but no matter what I try, it never fires due to:
  
==================== Rule check ==================== 
 Rule check results: 
 Expression: funGeneric
 ($ctransform `cast` <Co:3> :: (() -> D () -> [D ()]) ~R# C ()) () (initial `cast` <Co:3> :: Int ~R# D ()) 
 Rule "specialize\Int": arguments [4] do not match (1-indexing)

 In Scala 2.13 we were using the TypeCase from Shapeless library to overcome type erasure in pattern matching. demonstration:
 private val `Seq[AlertEntity]` = TypeCase[Seq[AlertEntity]] def onGetAlerts(arg: Any): Unit = arg match { case `Seq[AlertEntity]`(alerts) => () } 
 It was pretty convenient.
 Now upgrading to Scala 3 and checking if there a new canonical way to do it or if I should best stay with the current implementation.
 Saw TypeTest but wasn't sure how to use it even for this simple example.

Announcing ghciwatch 1.0 by Rebecca Turner
At Mercury, we’ve developed a file-watching recompiler for Haskell projects called ghciwatch, which loads a GHCi session (a Haskell REPL) and instructs it to reload or add modules when files in your project change. Ghciwatch is very similar in design to Neil Mitchell’s excellent ghcid, but with a few new tricks up its sleeve.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm using emacs to write Common Lisp code, and paredit doesn't respect the syntax of read macros. So, for example, when I write #P or #C or any other dispatch read macro(like my lovely home-brew λ)and open parenthesis or double quotes, it will insert a space before inserting the pair, and I have to double back to erase it. It's a really minor inconvenience, but I'm wondering if there's already a good solution to this problem or if anyone would be interested in improvement to paredit to correct this.
 You can just disable the behavior by adding to your .emacs, or whenever after paredit is loaded, 
 (defun paredit-space-for-delimiter-p (endp delimiter) nil) 
 But obviously this is a bit of a hack, and though I might try this out for now because I haven't ever noticed the space-adding behavior to be useful, I might find I'll miss it when it's gone, and want a more syntax aware paredit. 
 I noticed there's also a paredit-space-for-delimiter-predicates variable which you could use(or just use to disable the behavior in a less hacky way), but I would need to somehow query slime/swank to to robustly find out what the active read macros are(and I don't know how to do that at the moment), as well as actually parse them(which is messy but doable).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi folks,
 This is a package (early WIP, but usable for now) that enables formatting code in buffers via text properties.
 Long story short, it allows you to use any formatting function/command (like format-all-buffer or apheleia-format-buffer) to visually format the code in the buffer without actually modifying it. This is acheived by changing the text properties of the code with the spaces taken from the formatted code.
 This can be useful when working in a team and the codebase is poorly formatted, or when you don't like the coding style and you want to view the code in the style you like.
 This can be seen as an ~equivalent~ to Resharper's Virtual Formatter, which I just heard about when I started working on this package, but never used it actually.
 The current implementation requires treesit, so you will need Emacs 29+ with Tree Sitter support.

Since I give my habits specific time slots during a day (I'm trying to be consistent of WHEN I do my habits), it would be nice to have them show up in relation to the current time.
 So I'm considering just removing the habit style and just setting them up as recurring scheduled TODOs but I want to confirm there aren't other beneficial features to keeping it as a habit that I might not be aware of.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I run many Elisp scripts on my org-node zettelkasten, which is 2000+ Org files. So I've had plenty of situations where I hit this old nugget:
  File mode specification error: (file-error Cannot open load file Too many open files debug) 
 Now I'm wondering why. I take care to kill the buffer on each iteration, but it doesn't seem to matter. But! If I let a function process only 500 files, then finish, then run it again for the next 500 and so on, it works out. Is the call stack holding on to all file descriptors opened by children?
 Anyway, a problem I cannot solve: I have no insight into the org-publish codebase, and recently I found that the count of files I want to publish has exceeded 1024. So now I cannot publish. Has anyone worked around that? My publish code.
 Root of the issue 
 On Linux you might think the issue is ulimit -n which defaults to 1024 (on Debian at least), but it turns out that even if you increase that then Emacs will just die. The base problem sounds like a compiled-in FD_SETSIZE value of 1024.
 Last year it seems someone tried to patch it: https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2022-05/msg00115.html but this person says it just made Emacs unresponsive.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have just had this idea and I think it'd be pretty useful. Knowing emacs, there's a good change that either it's already a package or a snippet exists online. 
 The idea is this. After entering a command, say M-x compile <long compiler query>, I decide that I want it to be easily repeatable. So I then invoke a hypothetical M-x bind-last-command-to and it prompts for a key, say I now press <f5>. Now that compile command is bound to <f5>.
 I guess this is kind of like macros, but you bind it after the fact. And it is for a single command (even if it only worked for the last M-x compile it'd still be useful).
 Anyone know if it exists before I start trying to implement it myself? Thanks.

 If I start typing, it gives me autocomplete options for all functions from any package it knows about -- awesome.
 But if I do
 import qualified Data.ByteString as B B.p 
 The B.p will give completion options for all functions starting with the letter p from any package, rather than only showing functions from Data.ByteString.
 Is this how it's supposed to work? Are there any workarounds/customizations that will make it useable? There's no point in autocomplete if I have to type out the whole function name to eliminate irrelevant functions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m trying to get a C# environment up and running in Doom Emacs that can replace Rider. 
 I’ve managed to setup lsp-mode with Omnisharp and enabled decompilation, so I am able to use “go to definition” on .NET system types and external class libraries that are referred to in my project as nuget packages. 
 However if I have a class A in an external nuget package, and let’s say it refers to another type in another nuget package or a .NET system type, then I can’t go to definition from within class A to these types. 
 Rider allows me to do this, but Omnisharp can’t and this is one of the most useful features I use in Rider when debugging or trying to understand the code, and is the one thing that prevents me from going full Emacs for my C# development. 
 Is this a limitation in Omnisharp or can somebody share how to set this up, so I can decompile also referenced code from within a referenced nuget package?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Basically, i'm working on moving the final pieces to org note taking. Many people recommend using git for notes. And on the surface this makes sense. It's easy to use, automatic history and off device. But how do you deal with Personal Information in your Notes? Some of it might not be particularly interesting, but when you start using Due Dates and make Tasks on where to go, or whome you interact with, this could be different. Maybe you take a reminder to pick up some medication specific to a Illness you have.
 This might be even more of a problem if you use Org notes at work. Certainly most companies wouldn't want you to commit customer data to github/lab.
 So, how do you deal with this? So far the obvious thing is to keep Notes that are work related in their own folder and either not sync that or keep it on our own hosted gitlab instance.
 With personal notes this is a tougher call. I want them on two PCs and my phone. My experience with Syncthing over three devices in the past has been less than stelar. Any other recommendations that work reliably so i can finally leave google keep and todoist behind? (And yes, i know it's a bit ironic to care about personal information in org files in a git repo, when it's currently all on google and todoist servers. But i want to improve things ;) )

A while ago I was reading the following post:
https://forum.zettelkasten.de/discussion/1574/just-started-already-lost-in-clutter-how-do-you-prevent-to-get-lost-in-so-many-notes-and-links/p1
From the feedback it is clear that you should split your note taking into different steps, by using some sort of workflow.
I'm not arguing against this, but I would like to know how this community spreads this over time. Like for example do you have daily or weekly reviews or something entirely different?
The reason I ask is because most of the time at work, like most of you :-), my day is pretty full and I'm trying to figure out how to organize my day and/or week to incorporate this workflow.
Thank you]]></summary>

I cannot for the life of me find the source to this claim (which conveys my inability to properly execute the ZK method, as the claim, without its source, is noted down in one of my notes). But, anyway, I would really appreciate it if someone familiar with this could point me to a direction. I am also starting to believe that I made this up in my mind and convinced myself that I heard or read it somewhere, haha, even though I find it more probable that I heard about this in a podcast.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Disclaimer: noob. I use org-mode and evil-mode extensively for notes and generally want text to wrapped at say 80 lines (easier readability, better use of screen-real estate when you're using a tiling window manager or a terminal multiplexer). For those who do something similar, looking for some advice:
  
For wrapping text, can someone share a binding to toggle using text width of 80 and/off? Also useful to visually select text and set that to wrap at text width of 80 if you don't want the all text wrapped in the file. For the latter, I often visually select the text and use a binding for fill-region-as-paragraph but this joins paragraphs separated by a line. 
 
This:
  
This is some notes blah blah blah
 
  
looks better than this
 - This is some notes blah blah blah 
 , right? I find myself needing to manually adjust for the former--how to have it be done automatically?
  
Do you have wrap at column 80 for everything? I feel like if you have text at several indents deep, those lines are too short because they still get wrapped at column 80. I'm wondering if perhaps wrapping at 80 characters starting from first non-space character to the last character on the line might be better, but I'm not sure of any editors that allow for this behavior by default and in this case it would be better to stick with consistent behavior vs. some custom solution that might not cover all edge cases.
  
Much appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I'm upgrading a project from Scala 2.13 to Scala 3.
 In the project we have many enums implemented using traits and case objects such as:
 sealed trait ClientRole object ClientRole extends EnumExtender[ClientRole] { case object User extends ClientRole case object Device extends ClientRole } 
 in the base class, EnumExtender, the values method is implemented using TypeTag in the following way:
 abstract class EnumExtender[ENUM_BASE: TypeTag : ClassTag] { ... private val typesMap = allTypes final def values: List[ENUM_BASE] = typesMap.values.toList private def allTypes = { val tpe = ru.typeOf[ENUM_BASE] val clazz = tpe.typeSymbol.asClass val mirror = runtimeMirror(classTag[ENUM_BASE].runtimeClass.getClassLoader) if (!clazz.isSealed || (!clazz.isTrait && !clazz.isAbstract)) { throw new NoSuchElementException(...) } getSubclasses(clazz).filter(_.isModuleClass).map(t => { val module = mirror.staticModule(t.fullName) val i = mirror.reflectModule(module).instance.asInstanceOf[ENUM_BASE] i.toString -> i }).toMap } private def getSubclasses(symbol: Symbol): Seq[Symbol] = { def children = symbol.asClass.knownDirectSubclasses.flatMap(getSubclasses) symbol match { case s if s.isModuleClass => Seq(s) case s if s.isClass => Seq(s) ++ children } } } 
 TypeTag is no longer supported, so I'm looking for a way to achieve the same functionality, i.e. implementation for the values method.
 I can freely make changes to the EnumExtender base class, but I would like to avoid forcing changes on the actual enum subclasses.

I figured emacs would be the best place to ask as it's proximity to GNU, and also because that's where I would want to use said linter anyways. Any help is greatly appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have two Linux computers and a Windows computer. I use Emacs on all of them. 
 I've been looking for at handy way to share the Emacs configuration file between the computers. The basic step consists in letting the .emacs file on each computer load a common configuration file from a shared directory in Dropbox. With this in place, if I make a customization change on one computer, it is automatically available to the others.
 At least in theory.
 The challenge is that this sharing of a configuration file causes a lot of problems, because in many cases I want different configurations on the three computers. For example:
  
Path names to files will be different on my Linux and Windows computer.
 Font names are different.
 I have some project-specific configuration for a project that exists on one computer, but not on the others.
  
Also, if I install a new Emacs package on one computer, it will not get automatically installed on the others, and this may cause configuration problems.
 All of this can be solved by a very strict discipline about what goes where in various configuration files. But what I'd really like to know is this: Has any of you successfully created such a setup that actually works very well? If so, what insight can you share?

 I would love to pick your brains' imagination on something that would be interesting and useful to work on (implementation in Haskell of course :)). Or if you could point me to papers that contain ideas that can be explored in a Master's thesis.

 I have tried “e” to enable it, as well as M-x xwidget-webkit-edit-mode, as well as (add-hook ‘xwidget-webkit-mode ‘xwidget-webkit-edit-mode). Nothing seems to work; none of my key presses register and they seem to still execute commands. I thought it might be evil-mode, but disabling that doesn’t help (now everything echoes <k> is undefined). Does anyone know what the problem might be?
 As well, videos infinitely load. I know this is a known bug but it seemed as though it might have gotten fixed; I’m wondering if I’m missing some packages, I’m on alpine so a relatively minimal set of packages out of the box.

 I ran into a problem with configuration, caused by a malformed database path for a certain package. This causes a problem in emacsql, because it tries to treat the folder name as a file, but the error message is not descriptive at all.
 The more generic question is, how exactly should the user configuration be validated, i.e. I can of course add a check at the beginning of a function that uses it and it works fine, but I'm sure I'm not the first one who thinks about it and there is likely a more elegant/standard way of doing it and maybe some guidelines?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently I've started learning Lean4 Prover through the amazing book Functional Programming in Lean (highly recommendable) and I am amazed with the cool features it has; among others, it has dependent types, automatic coercions, very cool syntax sugar reducing a lot of boilerplate, and very good tooling (something I always miss from Haskell)
 Have you experimented with it? If so, what are your thoughts about it? In which things do you think Lean4 can not overpass Haskell?

 Two people have already reported issues on Windows on the repo, but the difference is that they were on the native build (which works perfectly fine for me w.r.t. elcord). I made an issue, but I suppose the owner abandoned the repo, so I am asking the community for some help. Is anyone in my situation?
 My suspicion is that the sock isn't being created properly and as such elcord keeps trying to reconnect, which it will never success because the sock won't be created.

Although Emacs has the best beginner-friendly documentation, it is extensive and overwhelming. I need guidance on how to navigate these documents and where to start. I found a YouTuber with an Emacs playlist, but I have trouble understanding his content. 
 I only have an hour a day to learn, but I need to get my work done. Please advise on how to learn Org mode to start taking notes.

 Can this be done in emacs? I know that i could write a new function that makes the new window for me before running find-file, but that way i'd have two "find-file" functions depending on wether i want a new window or not, which is more mental overhead. I also couldn't figure out what function is run when hitting Return on a find-file entry in the minibuffer.
 Any way to set up a bind/function that does what i'm looking for?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi! persp-project bridges perspective mode to the built-in project.el library. The idea is to create a separate perspective when switching projects. A perspective is an independent workspace for Emacs, similar to multiple desktops in Gnome and MacOS. This integration allows you to easily know which project you're currently in, and focus on files that only belong to the current project when switching buffers.
 ⚠️ NOTE: This package has come to life adapting the great package persp-projectile by Bozhidar Batsov with ChatGPT. I didn't write a single line of code. What inspired me to create this package is my recent effort to avoid most third party packages, specially if they prefer a newly defined interface over the built-in Emacs interface.
 Also special shutout to Natalie Weizenbaum for making such a great package!
 I would appreciate any feedback, I'll try to submit the package to MELPA next.

 And no completions show up.
 Auto-completion works with elisp (which comes by default I suppose), but not with c/c++.
 Also when I do M-x company-diag It says:

 (I tried to type #include)
 I am using Linux Mint with Emacs version 27.1. I also tried to use Emacs 29 but it doesn't work there either, It gives an error saying:

 Did anyone have this issue and is it worth solving it or should I just use auto-complete?

 I have many org mode files with lines beginning with dash.
 I want to export these to .html, but org mode process those lines as comments, and they are absent from the HTML exported file.
 I googled this but couldn't find any working solution...
 Thanks for your help.
 org mode example : 
  * title1 # some text here is my text code example : #+BEGIN_SRC bash # search for recent files find . -type f -mtime -1 #+END_SRC 
 HTML : 
  title1 here is my text code example : # search for recent files find . -type f -mtime -1 
 What I want :
  title1 # some text here is my text code example : # search for recent files find . -type f -mtime -1

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi there, i work in IT for 20 years, first as developer then as sysadmin.
 I worked in win, mac, gentoo, debian, redhat and for every circumstance i used different prebuilt ide like eclipse, visual studio and jetbrains, and vim with minimum knowledge for server management (copy, delete, regex replace... and i really hate counting!!!!)
 Now i use VSCode that is perfect for all my needs : project managements, rust developing, integrated terminal, docker and k8s integration.
 The only problem is that it becomes a ram eating machine and since i am non confident with websites like "downloadmoreram.com", i would like to switch to another editor.
 The lack of an integrated terminal will not be a problem but a tree on the side is fundamental.
 Did you suggest me to start from scratch with the emacs manual or a prebuilt env like doom?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've posted about the ekg notetaking app for emacs before. After a brief hiatus, I'm back working on it, and I'm pretty excited about the latest changes.
 A few weeks ago I also put out a new version of llm with a new module, llm-prompt, which allows templatized prompts that have easy and effective context filling, something that hasn't existed yet in any emacs module, AFAIK. The new version of ekg uses this new feature.
 Previously, the ekg-llm library would send the contents of the note, along with instructions to the LLM, which would then append to the note. Now, we also send the latest notes with the same tags, and similar notes, as part of the llm request context. This turns out to be a really important enhancement to the quality of the llm responses, and now using ekg is, IMHO, the best way to interact with LLMs. You can also edit the responses before you save them into a note (or just not save them at all). This is something else that can help improve the response quality. At times, the responses I'm getting are really magical - it really is what many people call a "second brain", but for real. I find myself using it constantly as a default way to interact with LLMs.
 I give an intro to ekg and talk about using it as a "second brain" in this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC_h3syRKro
 The other improvements to this version of ekg are primarily Markdown improvements (using markdown instead of org-mode is kind of necessary if you are using it to talk to llms), fixing issues and getting inline links to work.

On the other hand using Java libs sacrifices a little bit of pure FP approach. What are you using on production with Typelevel stack to implement auth these days?

 Some fonts have alternative characters behind character variants (cv), stylistic sets (ss), or other (onum, zero), and it would be very nice not to have to use an external tool to modify the fonts by hand to use them.
 It is almost a requirement to use certain fonts: their g and r are just weird, but FiraCode with the default @ and & is unusable :P
 It is supported in LaTeX (maybe only LuaLaTeX's fontspec?), and by the enemy...

 I'm working with C#, TypeScript (nodejs, react, etc), Python.
 It seems that TypeScript support is enabled gracefully with js and lsp module in init.el
 But C#... I can't understand. Anyone been able to enable it?
 EDIT: for people coming here in the future: (csharp +lsp) in init.el will enable lsp auto start in csharp files. BUT you need a language server. First time opening .cs file do M-x lsp, it will suggest you to install language server. Roslyn (csharp-roslyn) did NOT work for me, so I installed omnisharp. It worked :D

 I wish to sort directories before files, within the Completions buffer. This buffer is shown when executing C-x C-f TAB TAB, and should be done within a directory that contains directories and folders.
 The ls command has the option --group-directories-first, which is the behaviour I would like to achieve within the Completions buffer.
 Any insight is appreciated.

When the cursor is on Hebrew text, it becomes completely invisible.
 This only occurs with the cursor type set to 'bar'.
 The 'box' cursor type works without issues.
 There's a similar, but slightly different issue with Arabic text.
  
I use Emacs 29.3 for Mac. Changing font and bidi settings haven't solved the issue. Now I have no clue where to look for solution 
 Here is a short video to illustrate the problem.

 "doom eamcs recent files when i change dir of my file i want recent file to remove the old location entry"
 chatGPT gave me the code

(recentf-edit-list) (setq recentf-list (cl-delete-if (lambda (path) (string-equal path oldpath)) recentf-list)) (recentf-save-list))

 ```
 adding this code to me config file gave me the following unneeded behaviour
  
whenever i try to quit recentf-edit-list opens
 whenever i save a file the saved file is removed from recent file
  
I didn't want that so i just removed the code ran doom/reload yet the issue remained. The config file is clearly devoid of the code provided to me by chatGPT .
 After that failed i ran doom sync and then doom/reload still no change.
 I thought f#ck it and just reverted back to my previous commit and the issue still remains.
 Now i dont know what to do anymore.
 Please help as i just started getting into emacs 3 days ago and not good enough yet to deal with this myself.
 This is the value of my after-save-hook
 ```
 (diff-hl-update +emacs-lisp-non-package-mode flycheck-handle-save t ws-butler-after-save) Original value was nil Local in buffer config.el; global value is (doom-modeline-update-vcs doom-modeline-update-buffer-file-name #f(compiled-function () #<bytecode 0x96b404426f0cb9f>) +evil-display-vimlike-save-message-h doom-auto-revert-buffers-h doom-guess-mode-h)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I appreciate all the dev work that's gone into making HLS possible. It's capabilities are way beyond what I experienced back when I was last writing Haskell and has made it so much easier to quickly look up documentation and get autocomplete without having to scroll through hackage documentation for all of the functions and types that I forget.
 However, my experience using it with neovim has been less than stellar. I seem to have nothing but issues with it, and I can't tell if it's a neovim problem or an HLS problem. I'm using the haskell-tools.nvim plugin with the standard nvim-cmp and lspconfig plugins. Most other language servers work reasonably well, but this one seems particularly finicky and I can't figure out why.
 I'm currently having an issue where if I type anything for about 4-6 seconds after opening the first haskell file in the editor (while the language server is starting) it causes HLS to completely hang and become unresponsive. I'm also having issues with nvim-cmp screaming at me about misplaced dollar signs in snippets (I'm assuming because the haskell suggestions contain things like $ and $!).
 I decided to temporarily install vscode to see if that would do it. Everything worked completely flawlessly out of the box, absolutely no issues. The problem is, I would really rather not use vscode if I don't absolutely have to.
 Has anyone been able to get a working config for haskell in neovim that plays nice? I'm thinking of maybe scrapping haskell-tools and configuring things directly to see if that helps, otherwise I've spent so much time fiddling with the editor that I may have to leave it and come back later when things improve.

This coming year, I will have to complete a programming project as part of my qualification as a student. I have taken to the idea of using Haskell for this task, but I have gotten stuck on any ideas for the project. I'm aware of the nature of Haskell and how it's used in production, but am still stuck for ideas. Could anyone give me any project ideas? What have you personally developed in Haskell? What other Haskell projects do you use/find interesting? What aspects of Haskell do you find interesting to work with yourself? What sort of projects should I avoid?
 I am sorry if you have seen these types of posts frequently, but I could not find anything that was particularly useful to me. 
 Thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So my understanding of how API calls work in Haskell is something like this — The API request data that comes over the network is just a string(correct me if I'm wrong) and it gets converted into haskell record types by Aeson, that we can use in our applications.
 Now, Aeson uses instance declarations like below to convert the data to the record types.
 instance FromJSON MyType where parseJSON = ... 
 I can see from hoogle that the type of parseJSON is parseJSON :: Value -> Parser a, so the string that came over the network seems to have already been converted into a Value type.
 My question is how does the string type gets converted into Value type and where? If I want to do some transformation or validation on this string value, how can I go about it?

 Whenever I star Emacs and open any org-file with #+startup: overview for the first time, I can't expand any headings. And I can't figure out why. Executing normal-mode or org-mode with the same buffer has no effect. I have to close it and re-open it again. 
 I'm using Doom, but I rolled my own module, I'm not using the "official" Org module. Maybe this is an issue with straight.el? I don't know, I'm trying to manually call the commands - org-fold-reveal, org-cycle, and even org-reload (that reloads all of org.el Lisp files) etc. Nothing's working.
 Does anyone else have the same problem? Can anyone give any suggestions how to troubleshoot this?

 I would like to run a function that goes through the whole file and creates a new table with:
  
A column of Table Names
 A column of the net difference of highest number and lowest number
  
How would I approach this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am trying to use completing-read inside a function, but it gives errors. I have the following code that works fine.
 (setq first-alist '((one . two) (three . four) (five . six))) (completing-read "Prompt: " (lambda (input predicate action) (if (eq action 'metadata) `(metadata (annotation-function . (lambda (str) (concat " : " (cdr (assoc str first-alist)))))) (complete-with-action action (mapcar 'car first-alist) input predicate)))) 
 If I put that completing-read function in another function to which I pass an alist, it gives an error which says (void-variable some-alist). Is completing-read not supposed to be used in functions? If it is, then what changes can I make to use it correctly. Thanks.
 (setq second-alist '((a . b) (c . d) (e . f))) (defun blahblah (some-alist) (completing-read "Prompt: " (lambda (input predicate action) (if (eq action 'metadata) `(metadata (annotation-function .

 I had this idea of a kind of MVVC interface for a UI library in Haskell. A very very terribly written alpha is now here:
 https://github.com/yobson/qml-hs
 Is definitely isn’t fully implemented, and probably has memory leaks
 But it would be great if I could get feedback on the interface. There are no docs, so you will find the interface in the example (test/Main.hs)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What is effect? I asked ChatGPT and it gave me various answers:
  
Effect types are any types of kind Type -> Type.
 Effect types are types of kind Type -> Type that have an instance of Functor.
 Effect types are types of kind Type -> Type that have an instance of Applicative.
  
Sometimes it insists that a computation f a (where f is a functor) does not have an effect, only a context. To have a computational effect, there must be function application involved, so it uses terms like functorial context, applicative effect and monadic effect. However, it confuses me because the functor (->) a represents function application, as with State s and Reader r.
 Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, I've been playing a bit with the ideas from the trees that grow paper, and I've stumbled into something I don't quite get.
 Consider the following silly existential:
 type family SomeX (tag :: Type ) (x :: Type) :: Type data Some tag x where Some :: SomeX tag x -> x -> Some tag () 
 If we let:
 -- Proof carries a prof for `psi a` data Proof (psi :: k -> Constraint) (a :: k) where P :: psi a => Proof psi a 
 Then we can "inject" constraints by:
 data Foo type instance SomeX Foo x = (Proof Show x) 
 But, if I try to make a pattern, it throws a compilation error:
 -- Doesn't work 'x' does not unify with 'x1' pattern SomeFoo :: (Show x) => x -> Some Foo () pattern SomeFoo x = Some P x 
 I thought that this unidirectional pattern is supposed to work as an ordinary (possibly smart) constructor. If i "downgrade" it to an ordinary function, it compiles as expected:
 someFoo :: (Show x) => x -> Some Foo () someFoo x = Some P x

(I feel fairly confident in calling the idea that this improves performance a myth given that Emacs maintainers have frowned upon this practice on this sub)
 Also, are there any other common emacs myths that still go around that should be debunked? I think the idea that using tool-bar-mode or menu-bar-mode hampers your learning of the keyboard shortcuts is unfair and fewer "Intro to Emacs" guides should ask newcomers to turn them off.

 I'm happy to announce the new cognitive-complexity package, it is basically a port of codemetrics (based on tree-sitter) to the built-in treesit in Emacs 29+.
 https://github.com/abougouffa/cognitive-complexity
 The package implements the Cognitive Complexity metric for code, allowing it to calculate a score that describes the understandability of a piece of code.
 It is basically an implementation of Cognitive Complexity - A new way of measuring understandability.
 The original codemetrics package is based on the tree-sitter library, I forked it to port it to treesit so it can be used with Emacs 29+. I tried also to simplify the fork by removing some dependencies like dash and s.
 Looking forward for your feedback!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to figure out how to start Emacs with a default window layout that sticks, and I got lost in the weeds of trying different packages recommended by several articles:
 https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/demystifying-emacs-window-manager
 https://karthinks.com/software/emacs-window-management-almanac/
 I'd like the layout to look something like this: https://imgur.com/a/5NS7Es4
 But I'm completely lost.
 I understand that I need to set dedicated windows, but I am unable to figure out how Treemacs fits into that.
 If someone could help with the basic layout, I can probably figure out the dedicated buffers/windows configuration. Please help!
 Edited to add: After reading Micky Peterson's guide "Demystifying Emacs' Window Manager" I think I understand the display-buffer-alist better now. I also tried saving a layout to .emacs.desktop and I'm reading through that, too. I think what is causing issues for me is the Treemacs sidebar window is special and doesn't use a window. This is definitely a big ol' can of worms!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[lately I had to uninstall Haskell from one of my systems and run into following problem:
 one of the challanges were, that this was a "old" system which had dealt with multiple eras of haskell stuff:
  
I didn't know with which tool I had installed specific parts of the Haskell tool chain (Haskell-plattform, Chocolatte, ghcup, ... etc)
  
So how it went:
  
uninstallation of stack went smooth
 uninstallation of ghcup went smooth
 uninstallation of chocolatte went smooth
  
remark: I allso purged the env-variables of stack/ghcup/chocolatte
  
I'm not sure how I get rid of cabal/ghc(i) whenn using cabal --version in terminal the output is:cabal --versioncabal-install version 3.4.0.0 compiled using version 3.4.0.0 of the Cabal library
  
when using ghc --version in terminal the output is:
 ghc --version //ghci --version has the same output The Glorious Glasgow Haskell Compilation System, version 8.10.7 
 using where.exe in power shell yields:
 where.exe ghci C:\tools\ghc-8.10.7\bin\ghci.exe C:\ProgramData\chocolatey\bin\ghci.exe C:\tools\ghc-9.2.1\bin\ghci.exe where.exe ghc C:\tools\ghc-8.10.7\bin\ghc.exe C:\ProgramData\chocolatey\bin\ghc.exe C:\tools\ghc-9.2.1\bin\ghc.exe where.exe cabal C:\Users\ -censored- \AppData\Roaming\cabal\bin\cabal.exe 
 So:
 would it be sufficient to just simply purge those folders?

Competitive Programming in Haskell: tree path decomposition, part I by Brent Yorgey
In a previous post I challenged you to solve Factor-Full Tree. In this problem, we are given an unlabelled rooted tree, and asked to create a divisor labelling. That is, we must label the vertices with positive integers in such a way that v is an ancestor of u if and only if v’s label evenly divides u’s label.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey guys, I've been a pure Scala engineer for around 6 years now. The stack I've been working with was the typelevel with tagless final so 90% of our code was in the functional style. I got an offer from one of my previous employers for a Senior Java role and as usual they are using the Java Spring enterprise stack. 
 I'm considering the switch because of the better work-life balance, increased pay and more remote friendly. But what's making me doubt is Java. I haven't used Java (or any OOP language) in an production setting before and mainly throughout my career only used functional languages. Has anyone done a similar shift? Like moving from purely functional scala to Java EE style? And if so how was the adjustment? 
 I did a quick read through some Spring code bases and it just seems like most of the work is just using the spring annotations correctly, which I don't really like since it's seems like doing "config" instead of actual coding.
 So anyone with any experience on making a similar switch and how that went?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Greetings, I'm working on my computer science master's thesis and I'm having trouble finding open-source standalone tools or Intellij/VS code plugins that would provide me with code quality metrics through static analysis on package, class, and/or method levels. Most of what I've found were refactoring or lining tools, and a few paid tools/services that would give me somewhat useful metrics. 
 I reckon I could cobble something together that I could use but it would be a significant time investment. So, I figured I could ask the Scala community for recommendations before I start doing it myself. Any suggestions?
 P.S. The list of metrics that I'm interested in isn't that strict, but generally, it should be at least one of these metric sets: Maintainability Index, Halstead metrics, QMOOD metrics, MOOD metrics, and a few others.
 P.P.S. "MetricsTree" would be an ideal tool if it weren't capable of handling only Java source code. I thought about compiling scala code and then decompiling class files into Java source code but that can skew the metrics too much.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The other day, while still struggling to learn how mu4e works, I have noticed execute-extended-command suggest a faster way to get a command: for mu4e-update-index it suggested using mu-u-i.
 As I'm using Ivy, I thought, and somehow expected, to be able to achieve the same result. So I tried mu u i. Ivy suggested many mu4e commands, but mu4e-update-index was not near the top.
 As I've learned since, completion-styles, set to (basic partial-completion emacs22), explains how mu-u-i matches.
 Ivy uses its own "completion styles" that are different from the default ones. The default is ivy--regex-plus.
 Now, it's not like Ivy is not matching the command, but it's definitely not in the top results. Thus, using it requires more keys.
 Question: Is it possible to make Ivy matcher work closer to partial-completion or initials completion styles?

 Now, Emacs is never going to be as fast as simpler editors. However, most of the time you shouldn't be able to notice any slowness. All this suggests to me that lots of people are doing things sub-optimally. I have used Emacs for more a very long time. Here I'll give some advice on speed. I haven't deliberately optimized my Emacs setup for speed, but I have avoided things that make it slow.
 Firstly, there are some things that you can't really change....
  
The speed of external programs like Git.

It seems to be an endless journey to improve my personal knowledge management system. By chance, I discovered "Wardley Mapping" by Simon Wardley [1]. It's a method for understanding how to develop your strategies. My first idea to learn more about this visual tool was to apply it to my Zettelkasten strategy.
Let's take a closer look. A Wardley map allows us to visualize the **Evolution **of business components over time. It starts from the unstable beginnings to more stable, standardized components. These components fall into four stages: genesis, custom, product, and commodity.
First: Genesis components are novel and new. Second: Custom components exist for a specific use case with some proof of value. Third: P…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developing a Wardley Map for using a Zettelkasten in my personal knowledge management involves outlining several components to understand and strategize my approach effectively:
Purpose: Efficiently manage and leverage personal knowledge for continuous learning and productivity.
Scope: Digital note-taking, linking ideas, research support, excluding team collaboration.
User: Primarily self.
User Needs: Quick note capture, efficient organization with tagging and linking, easy retrieval.
Value Chain: From user to Zettelkasten.
Wardley Map: Helps to visualize the different components and their current state in the evolution, guiding where to focus efforts to improve my personal knowledge management system.
And here is my story: I started my changes to improve my personal knowledge management system by moving from OneNote to Obsidian two years ago (1). The major change was my first contact with the Zettelkasten framework (2). It was hard for me to change my personal organization from thinking in "folders" to "tagging" (3). My current challenge is to use analytical reading to improve my notes (4).
What will the next steps be? What are your recommendations?

 I work as a sysadmin and it is a common occurrence that I have to execute a command on a number of hosts (or a number of files) simultanously. What I currently do is have several buffers open at once and then switch to each buffer, make my change, go to the next buffer -- which, you can guess, is very tedious.
 After searching for a bit, I found the wonderful BROADCAST-MODE which allows you to do this for visible buffers. And indeed, it works just fine for regular text buffers. However, I was saddened to find out it doesn't seem to work with VTERM, my terminal emulator of choice within emacs.
 Is there another mode I have failed to find? Is there a configuration settings I forgot to tweak? I'd love to hear your suggestions.
 Have a good day, fellows :)

This is yet another opportunity to share with your friends what you are working on. Add to this discussion by telling us about your zettelkasten journey. Share with us what you're learning. Sharing helps me and, hopefully, you, too. It helps us clarify our goals and visualize our thinking.

Here is a report on why I'm here and this week's ZK work themes/ideas:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am making this post for anyone else who might get stuck and need some help.
 I cloned the Emacs and Tree-sitter repos and decided to build the latest version of each on Fedora 37. While attempting to compile Emacs, I ran into several very frustrating build issues.
 My first issue was that while running ./configure --with-tree-sitter --with-native-compilation I kept getting an error saying that tree-sitter could not be found. The version that was available from dnf was too old, so I decided to clone the tree-sitter repo and compile it myself. In spite of tree-sitter building without issue, it was still failing to register with the Emacs configure script.
 The solution ended up being to first runldconfig after tree-sitter is done compiling:
 sudo ldconfig /usr/local/lib
 Then, to ensure that the emacs configure script finds it, export the path:
 export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig
 Then you can runmake && sudo make installand everything should work.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to figure out a nice way to express arrays of composite values, like (a, b, c). For a variety of reasons I want to represent this with a composite of simple arrays, so for example an array of (a, b, c) would actually be structured as (array a, array b, array c). This is nice because zip- and unzip- like operations essentially become free. As I understand it, Data.Vector.Unboxed does something like this, although I don't get quite how it works. For this particular application Data.Vector.Unboxed is not suitable however as I'm making this array library specifically for an FFI which requires pinned memory.
 What I want to do is define composite types in a simliar way to how a value level list might be,
 comp = a:b:c:[] 
 so that it can be transformed by applying a type level function to each element
 map f (a:b:c:[]) == f a:f b:f c:[] 
 My current thinking is that it might be possible to express this type of transform on the type level somehow, but It's not clear to me how.
 The purpose of this would be to have a neat way to relate the element type to the array type, so I'd have something like
 CompArray (a <:> b <:> c <:> ()) ~ Array a <:> Array b <:> Array c <:> () 
 Any ideas on how to express this, or is it not possible to do this kind of type level programming in Haskell?

 So thing is that we are on sbt 13.18. We got a lot going on right now and upgrading sbt is not something we want to do in the next month (we have 2 months to transition to VS Code). 
 From what I understand, to get any kind of useful IDE features in VS Code, you need to use Scala Metals, but Scala metals only works with sbt 1.0+? 
 I tried running some basic metals commands and they don't seem to exist for my version of sbt. Is there any sub 1.0+ version that supports metals? What is my best option here? 
 Or am I just making stuff up and I have no idea what I'm talking about?

 Basically I had custom functions for fuzzy finder (in my case it was fzf) to call an external program for list of data (i.e. the stdout lines) and select the line using the fuzzy finder then pass it to another external program which returned the path of the file and then I could use edit command to open that file in a new buffer.
 I want to do the same thing in emacs mini-buffer but I don't know where to start. I've read the chapter about completion in the emacs manual but could not understand anything...
 It worth mentioning that I use vertico, marginalia and ordderless packages and It would be nice to use the marginalia to show more information about the items / files.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have built emacs from git before. I want to build it from master with the same options I used last time. The variable system-configuration-options has the value "--with-json --with-xwidgets --with-tree-sitter". So I pulled from the repo, and checked out master (I checked this had worked and the last commit in my local repo is from three hours ago). I ran make clean to clean the repo, then ./autogen.sh, and then ./configure --with-json --with-xwidgets --with-tree-sitter, literally just copying in the flags that my current emacs tells me I used to configure the build last time. ./configure runs, but the first and lines of the output say configure: WARNING: unrecognized options: --with-json.
 I'm not sure what to do about this. I want to build with proper json support like I currently have. I can't find anything in NEWS or the changelogs about this build option being deprecated, and searching the devel list archives doesn't bring up anything.
 Questions: - why is this option not recogized? - how should I configure my build to get proper json support?
 TIA!

 Make a list of unique, two characters long elements from KEYS. Elements of length one have a tab appended. Elements of length two are kept as is. Longer elements are truncated to length two. If an element cannot be made unique, an error is raised.

When I click a mouse on the frame, or switch frames, the tooltip either pops up, or displays in the echo area. And stays there far longer than the tooltip-hide-delay (set to one second,). Emacs accepts no inputs for as long as ten seconds unless I aggressively pound Ctrl-g. At this point I am almost at the point of patching tooltips out on the source. 
 Help?
 I am running emacs from git, if that makes a difference.

 My web-mode configuration. And a link to my personal configuration

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I'm trying to build a major mode, the functionality is not really that important for the question, but for the curious it is something akin to org-roam.
 I'm not new to programming, or even lisp, but new to emacs lisp.
 I'm not sure how to approach a first working prototype, as the resources I found seem to focus only on syntax highlighting and indentation, but I would like to prototype something like when I open a file of this new major mode, that two windows open side by side, one with the source file and another one with a graphical representation based on the contents of the file.
 If anyone can point me in the right direction I would greatly appreciate it. Thanks!
 PD: To anyone who might say it might be silly to start on this if I'm new to elisp, it's the way I like to learn, doing and improving as I go, most often times it works pretty well, but in this case I'm lost as to where to start.
 Edit: I'm looking for resources, other than the Elisp manual, which is the only thing I'm currently reading but I don't know if reading the manual top to bottom will point me in the right direction, thanks!

 The Diagrams library has the most elegant API I've ever worked with. A bunch of years ago I went to a Haskell hackathon, and Brent Yorgey very patiently helped me make a PR for a simple feature, explained to me about affine transformations, partial vs total functions and the like. It left a lasting impression, really made me want to do more FP. Thanks Brent, whereever you are!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I have been trying, and so far not completely succeeding, in setting up mu4e to access Outlook365 email. This setup involves:
  
davmail
 mbsync
 mu/mu4e
  
As I don't want to litter the initial message with a ton of configuration, which I can provide later when needed, I will jump to questions.
 Reading the mu4e manual I have learned about the 2 operations: move and refile.
  
Is it correct to think of Refile as what is currently found in email services like Gmail or Outlook365 under the name Archive?
 
what configuration is needed or what actions do I need to apply for email to be actually moved to the target mailbox when using move or refile?
 
 With my current setup, I have noticed the emails being copied (or duplicated) to the target directory while they continue to appear in the Inbox when using the Outlook app. On mu4e, the initial emails are not available anymore (as I was thinking that maybe I could delete them).
 This behavior is surprising to me and I'm thinking that 1) either it is a misconfiguration; or 2) it involves a different set of actions to lead to the result I intend.
 thank you for helping a mu4e newbie

New member here, hello :-)
I've been reading a lot about Zettelkasten lately and I would like to try it out.
The site https://zettelkasten.de/ has been a great place to start. I still have a couple of questions, but most of them will become clear while I'm using ZK I guess.
Still 1 thing is not very clear to me. I know a note initially starts as a concept, but I'm wondering when you add more context to your existing note, what do you do with the original text, do you keep it or rewrite the whole note into something new?
Sorry if my question is not clear.
Thank you]]></summary>

The premise is this, I'm thinking of building an upgraded GUI for Emacs (for no reason other than fun). I have two options: 1. building the GUI from scratch and bridging to the Emacs functionality then have the custom GUI render all the events from Emacs OR 2. maybe I can just edit the already existing source code for the GUI and add features or change it entirely. I just want to know what files to start digging. I could be going about this all wrong entirely, but that's my plan so far. I know frame.c and window.c manages outputs and stuff I'm just trying to be thorough and see if there is maybe something else I can look at in the source code.

 here are steps I did to build emacs maybe there is something wrong with them:
  
clone emacs from github 
 
take a snapshot of emacs 29 using: archive origin/emacs-29 | tar -x -C ../emacs-29
 
go to emacs-29 dir and run autogen[.]sh 
 
run ./configure --with-gif --with-gnutls=ifavailable --with-json --with-modules --with-xwidgets --with-rsvg it only complains about mail being unecrypted no warning or anything about svg.
 
make && sudo make install
 
run emacs 
 
 when finished I run (image-type-available-p 'svg) it returns nil (also tested with emacs -Q ).
 I tried this multiple times no matter how I did it, it won't build with svg.
 I also tried to build with native compilation but gcc failed to compile the test ( when I tested the test file it resulted in an error with segmentation fault )
 my system:
 os: ubuntu-18.04( I know it is old but I have a gpu problem that prevent any recent version to run properly)
 gcc: gcc (Ubuntu 7.5.0-3ubuntu1~18.04) 7.5.0

Instead, I just the get the ASCII quote symbols highlighted in blue to indicate that they're actually not the ASCII quote character. The same applies to left and right single quotes.
 As implied by my post title, this problem only applies when running emacs in daemon mode. if instead of launching emacsclient I run /usr/bin/emacs from a graphical environment, I get a frame where the quote characters work fine. I'm inferring that there's some variable somewhere that determines whether or not quote characters should be substituted, and it's being set to false when emacs runs daemonized because there's no graphical environment, but I'm unsure what variable that would be and where it would be set.
 I am using emacs 29.4 with pgtk enabled, on Arch Linux. My WM is Sway, which means I am running under wayland. The font I am using is Terminus 16.

 If you have already installed elisa you need to check install instructions and reparse info manuals because of internal changes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to figure out the recommend workflow for writing a standalone haskell program. Say I want to write a single program in a file 'test.hs' that depends on modules not in the prelude. And I want to compile this into an executable. So I cannot simply complie this with `ghc test.hs`, since I will get the complaint that ghc cannot find the module I need.
 So what is the recommended work around? I know you can use cabal or stack to build a project and the specify dependencies in the .cabal file. But this seems heavy duty for a single haskell file. Specifically, using `cabal init` will create a directory `app`, the file `CHANGELOG.md`, and the .cabal file, just for this single haskell file. Further `cabal init` asks quite a lot, including asking about which license to use, leading me to believe `cabal init` is meant for much more heavy duty projects.
 Using stack has a similar amount of, if not more, overhead.
 tldr; Is using `cabal init` or `stack new` the best way to create a stand alone `.hs` file depend on hidden packages? What is the recommended way?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to find some YT videos I've seen before, on writing technical docs using org-mode. I already have some System Crafters ones, and also those from spudlyo but while useful, they're not the specific one(s) I'm thinking of. I think the presenter had either an Australian (or maybe Kiwi/Tassie) or South African accent.
 Any suggestions?
 Incidentally, I did ask ChatGPT for its input. And while I have to acknowledge that accent is not a perfect predictor of nationality, I reckon it's still often a good one. And so I have my doubts over ChatGPT's three suggestions. The first was David Wilson, who doesn't sound very Australian. The second was System Crafters, but that Just Is David Wilson. The third reply was the charm though, and makes me think ChatGPT must be having a particularly bad day, hallucinations-wise, because it said:
  
...another prominent Australian YouTuber who focuses on Emacs and Org mode is 'Protesilaos Stavrou'
  
Again, I know accent doesn't map perfectly to nationality, but clearly Prot doesn't sound remotely Australian. Thing is, ChatGPT actually seemed to be "aware" of the issue, because it went on to say:
  
While not exclusively Australian, his content is highly relevant and valuable for Emacs and Org mode users.
  
So there you go, Prot. If you're reading this you'll be glad to know that ChatGPT acknowledges that you are not "exclusively" Australian. Fair dinkum.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I need to change the color of the modified lines in my git-gutter. I found this code online and I put it in my config.el
  (custom-set-faces `(git-gutter-fr:added ((t (:foreground "#00ff00")))) ;; green `(git-gutter-fr:modified ((t (:foreground "#ffff00")))) ;; yellow `(git-gutter-fr:deleted ((t (:foreground "#ff0000")))) ;; red ) ) 
 But it doesn't seem to do anything and there are no errors.
 I need to change the color of git blame line (from why-this package). The README file says I need to add:
 (set-face-background 'why-this-annotate-heat-map-cold "#203448") (set-face-background 'why-this-annotate-heat-map-warm "#382f27") 
 I put this also in my config.el and this no effect at all either. I have already tried restarting Emacs and everything and none of my settings have any effect.
 Is it just me or did everyone else also start with so much of frustration when they got started with Emacs? I did not expect something like just changing a color to be so complicated.
 UPDATE:
 Fixed the first issue based on this thread: https://github.com/doomemacs/themes/issues/268
 (custom-set-faces
 '(diff-hl-insert ((t (:foreground "#00ff00"))))
 '(diff-hl-change ((t (:foreground "#ffff00"))))
 '(diff-hl-delete ((t (:foreground "#ff0000"))))
 )
 Still struggling with the why-this package.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m on a bit of an FFI discovery journey, trying to make some bindings to openCV (it’s mostly to get better at FFI writing, less for publishing)
 OpenCV is a really interesting library because it’s Mat data type handles memory really well.
 It reference counts the actual matrix data. You can have several openCV transformations that use several Mats, but open CV will maybe do everything in place.
 The question is, how best to do this in Haskell? It feels like a job for the ST monad?
 So my questions: Is there a way of using c++ class destructors in Haskell? Calling them when values go out of scope? I worry about this because using Cont would lead to space leaks with loops(?)
 Even though I have storable instances, I seem to only be able to work with pointers to Mats, not the types themselves
 Can I use the ST monad? Is there any reason I shouldn’t?

 (setq major-mode-remap-alist '((python-mode . python-ts-mode))) (use-package eglot :ensure t :hook (python-mode . eglot-ensure) :config (add-to-list 'eglot-server-programs '(python-mode .

 This has multiple problems. First, when writing import ... I don't get completions. Second, if I have import numpy as np then later np. doesn't get completed to anything correct. I'm not sure which package is in charged of this and would love help in this regard.
