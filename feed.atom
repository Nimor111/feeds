        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've recently reached an initial milestone in the development of SLinC (Scala Link to C), a library in the vein of Java Native Access and Java Native Runtime. I'm designing SLinC to use cats' `Free` monad for a native effect type called NativeIO, and it's powered by Scala 3's macros and Java 17's foreign incubator.
 An example usage of SLinC is binding to stdlib.h's div method:
 C representation
 struct div_t { int quot; int rem; }; div_t div(int numerator, int denominator); 
 Scala 3 binding and usage
 //scala representation of div_t struct type div_t = Struct { val quot: int val rem: int } //method binding for c stdlib's div val div = NativeIO[(Int, Int) => div_t]("div") //usage of our binding //Struct returns require native memory allocation, so an allocation scope is needed Native.scope( for result <- div(5,2) quot = result.quot.get rem = result.rem.get yield println(s"quotient: $quot, remainder: $rem") ) //natively allocated data is freed after this point .foldMap(NativeIO.impureCompiler) //compiles and runs the native kernel we just defined, prints "quotient: 2, remainder: 1" 
 The library is still in development, so it's not as fully featured as JNA or JNR, but I'm hoping to improve it in the coming month. It's also very promising performance-wise: despite me not putting much of any effort into optimization, it's already rivaling JNR in performance, and resoundingly beats JNA.

 This is not your typical r/scala question about type classes or another generic job post – you won’t see any “in this role you will…” or “Bachelor’s Degree in Computer Science or equivalent.”

 Now you can run SPICE simulation for simple circuits in GNU Emacs. Since the circuit and graphs are in SVG format, you can easily share it on web or embed in a document.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently, I compiled Emacs PGTK Nativecomp and running it on my machine which is fairly good. Surely, using nativecomp is a new experience and everything felt very fast as compared to Emacs 27. But yesterday, I was facing Emacs freeze while editing a simple dockerfile which is hardly 100 lines ig and I inspected it in Htop and found that Emacs using 100% CPU. Then I killed emacs and run another instance and profiled it while editing same dockerfile but again I left with freezed Emacs. Again I tried same and found in profiler that evil (especially evil-ex command), timer.el(IDK what it is) and selectrum(precisely selectrum--update) using CPU. Then I removed evil packages from my init.el and replaced selectrum with vertico. Now, Emacs is usable. But it still lags (not freezes) in between and its due to native compilation turned on. 
 Is this only happening to me or anyone else facing same issue? Is there any workaround for it?

 ​
 Unfortunately, it looks like macOS Monterey regressed the performance of vfork, which means magit is once again slow and gets slower the more packages you have loaded. See https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-gnu-emacs/2017-04/msg00201.html
 I'm curious if anyone out there has an M1 Mac w/ Monterey and Emacs 27.2 or greater and would be willing to run this and report back the timing information:
 (benchmark 100 '(call-process "/usr/bin/true" nil nil nil))
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi guys, I've been learning haskell for school and I have an exercise Im trying to do where I have to implement a function firstWhen :: (a -> Bool) -> [a] -> Maybe a, 
 the function is meant to return Just n if n is the first member that satisfies the condition and Nothing if no member satisfies the condition. So my first thought is to use foldl since it will check everything from the left to the right and I have my accumulator set to Nothing. 
 My current implementation is: 
 firstWhen p = foldl (\acc x -> if p x then Just x else Nothing ) Nothing
 The problem is it always returns the result for the final member. is there some way to make the function return the first member that satisfies the condition and then stop iterating? or am I thinking about this the wrong way? Thanks in advance for any tips or gentle nudges in the right direction :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey guys,
 I am currently trying to learn some haskell by going throught he LYAH book and got two questions.
 ​
 1) I think it was written when Applicative was not required for the Monad typeclass. It states in this capter (http://learnyouahaskell.com/for-a-few-monads-more) that there are some functions that do the same as the functions on Functors. But specifically written for Monads (e.g. liftM and fmap; ap and <*>).
  
Which ones are you using?
 Is there a rule of thumb?
 Perhaps something like "always liftM when the value is an instance of Monad and only fmap when it is an instance of Applicative and not of Monad?"
  
​
 2) There is a small task to do this tightrope walker example (http://learnyouahaskell.com/a-fistful-of-monads) with the Either type instead of the Maybe type.Thats what I did here and wondered if I could use the state Monad in combination with the Either Monad to clean up the code by avoiding all these ```first <- landLeft start second <- landLeft first etc..```
  
Is this possible? ( I did not yet fully grasp the State Monad stuff, so it would also be a decent practice I guess)
  
​

 thanks in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Are there good options for automatically adjusting text size for a frame based on the current display?
 I didn't find anything so I made a small package textsize that currently fits my needs quite well. It automatically chooses a font point size for the default face for the current frame, based on:
  
monitor resolution: if it's lower res, typically want a smaller point size
 pixel pitch: higher point size on finer pitch screens
 manual per-frame adjustment available to shift the calculated value
  
For me there is one current omission where automatic adjustment is fired via window-size-change-functions, which does not fire if the resolution is unchanged. e.g. Going from my 1080p laptop to a 1080p external. The only options I've seen for that require polling, which feels kind of distasteful. Anyone know of triggers I might catch for that?
 I could add rules around monitor size and/or frame size, though personally I haven't particularly wanted it. The manual adjustment is available for transient needs.
 I'd welcome comments both on the functionality, how I achieved it.
  
Is this reinventing another wheel I didn't find? This EmacsWiki page outlines some details but I didn't see automatic adjustment.
 
I feel like my coding of 'thresholds' is clunky and a little obtuse - are the Elisp examples of something similar that's cleaner and clearer?
 
My default pixel pitch thresholds are guesses, as my day-to-day doesn't have a lot of variation on that.
 
 If you want to try it, load textsize.el and run (textsize-setup), and move things between disparate monitors (providing their resolution isn't the same!). Tweak the customizations and let me know if you think the defaults could be better or if you would want other rules.
 I can put it on MELPA if there's interest, but I feel like it could do with a bit more depth.

 I have been thinking about switching to Emacs from Vim. I was using Vim since I tried to use Emacs but it was difficult to understand the configuration.
 The main use I would give it would be for web development with React and node. Any blog that you recommend me to learn how to configure Emacs in general. 
 Thank you very much for your help.

 Most of my work uses rectangle arrays.
 I would like to learn Haskell, but I find myself needing a pragmatic reason to use haskell in a way that works with my very schedule.
 For example, in my PhD I was using matlab. It is slow and not open, hence I started using Julia.
 In my work I was using R, it in open but still slow, hence I started using Julia.
 What reasons can I tell myself to start using Haskell?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I'm a psychology student from an Eastern European country. Currently I'm using the method to learn more about the neuroscience of emotions and personality psychology and how they are related to each other.
I was reading some neuroscience textbooks in the past few days and I wanted to take notes from them, because I know little to nothing about neuroscience. However, I have some trouble with finding connections between the notes in my Zettelkasten (probably because there are only two dozen notes and because I have deleted my previous Zettelkästen a few times).
I thought that knowing the types of links would help me with making the connections. These are the types of connections I know of yet:
So, do you think that having a personal typology of link types is helpful in making more meaningful connections between ideas?
(P.S. Stupid me deleted my previous Zettelkästen because I wasn't satisfied with the connections I made. Most of them were of the type "This is a note about object X, this is another note about object X, I can sense a connection!", which is a link type better encapsulated with a tag. Because of that I got few insights over the months I had been using the method.)]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have been using mu4e for a year and I am fairly satisfied with it except for how slow it can be. This slowness really annoys me when mu re-indexing blocks all other email operations including opening emails.
 I decided to switch to notmuch instead and upon configuring it (based on prot's config) it seems much faster and the fact that there can be multiple open searches and emails is a huge draw for me.
 However, there are features in mu4e that I want to replicate in notmuch, at least in the beginning while I get used to the tags system. These include:
  
Moving messages between folders and deleting messages.
 Multiple accounts and automatic context switching. In mu4e, when replying to an email the correct email account is used.
 Viewing messages from a search without the related messages in a thread. The tree-view includes all messages in a thread (and is not aligned correctly by default) and the non-tree view shows a list of threads rather than messages.
  
Does anyone have a configuration that implements these features?
 Finally, to be able to use tags, I am wondering if there's a way to sync notmuch's arbitrary tags with the mail server. I have two machines that access the same mail server and I want to configure notmuch on them separately, replicating the email tags (I cannot ssh to either machine from the other and I don't want to rely on a Dropbox like service to sync the notmuch database).

 ​
 But I think Monads are likely overmystified, what with the burritos and all. One thing, after I finish getting Monads, is that I'd like to explain Monads to my mother. She's not a programmer by trade, but was studying for a Java certification years back, so it might be a little bit easier.
 ​
 I'm wondering, does anyone else want to explain Monads to their mother? Even if they didn't want to do so, would you have a strategy for explaining Monads to your mother? Come and share, both proposals and experiences!

I followed this advice and got a bunch of feedback loops and not a lot of structure. I started giving myself permission to use Structure Notes as much as I want, and I find these structure notes to be much more helpful than direct links from one note to the next.
If I have a stream of thought that spans 10 notes, I find it easier to back to the structure note to click through each note than to do a whole bunch of to/from links in each note.
Anybody else experience this? Anything I'm missing out by not linking directly?]]></summary>

 I have tried connecting to a local mac machine and a VPS. Tramp stucks at "Tramp: Opening connection nil for user@host using ssh...failed". I toggled debug on quit, and find that tramp stuck at tramp-maybe-open-connection . I also tried to use my mac machine to connect back to my arch machine, the mac machine is also on the latest commit ba278e4a9b, and they both have the same issue. Also, I have tried to open emacs using emacs -Q , but tramp failed also without loading my config.
 Tramp was working a week ago. All I did is compile Emacs from the latest source. 
 I am curious to see if that is my problem or a bug in Emacs. Does anyone of you unable to use tramp using the latest commit?
 Is there anything I can do to find out what is going wrong?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I'm not sure if this is best place to post this question, but here goes. I'm working on a problem that requires an algorithm that finds all sequences of natural numbers that add up to a given number. So, for example, 4 is broken down into `[[1,1,1,1],[1,1,2],[1,3],[4],[2,2]]`. There's a solution online I found (https://origin.geeksforgeeks.org/find-all-combinations-that-adds-upto-given-number-2/), but it's for other imperative languages and doesn't translate well to Haskell. I managed to write an algorithm that works (I think), but seems to be terrible inefficient for higher numbers. I think trying to parse through it would just further confuse anyone reading. I was wondering what someone more well versed in the ins and outs of Haskell would do to implement this algorithm. Thanks.
 sumCombinations :: Int -> [[Int]] sumCombinations 1 = [[1]] sumCombinations i = filter (not . any (>9)) $ initialList : (nub . map sort . collapseCombinations $ initialList) where initialList = take i $ repeat 1 collapseCombinations :: [Int] -> [[Int]] collapseCombinations xs | (length $ tail computed) == 0 = [computed] | (length $ tail computed) > 1 = computed : collapseCombinations computed ++ map ((head computed):) (collapseCombinations (tail computed)) | otherwise = computed : collapseCombinations computed where computed = (\(y:ys) -> (y + head ys) : (ys \\ [head ys])) xs

When using `lsp-ui`, the documentation viewer, which appears in a childframe, causes a blank frame to be created when emacs is in full screen. This appears to happen with other apps as well that use childframes. 
 I've disabled using a child frame for the doc which is upsetting because the in frame version is way worse and doesn't have clickable links.
 Anyone know of a workaround? I'm new to emacs and still just trying to get my emacs config to work without major bugs.

 Recently I realized I have no idea how should I define version bounds for my library and I got pretty confused before I finally figured out the reasoning behind it (thanks to r/haskell and Adam Bergmark from Stackage), so I thought I would capture that reasoning in a short article: https://github.com/wasp-lang/haskell-handbook/blob/master/dependencies-version-bounds.md .
 I would appreciate any feedback, be it if I got something wrong or if I could improve clarity in some way.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I realize this is a common question - e.g. see here but I want to ask a slight variation on the usual case.
 I have created my own class file with definitions called my_article.cls, with code like:
 \NeedsTeXFormat{LaTeX2e} \ProvidesClass{my_article}[Article class with style modifications ] \LoadClass{article} \RequirePackage{titlesec} \RequirePackage{setspace} \onehalfspacing \RequirePackage[a4paper, hscale=0.8, vscale=0.8, includehead]{geometry} \RequirePackage{amsmath} \RequirePackage{amsfonts} \RequirePackage{amssymb} \RequirePackage{graphicx} \titleformat{\subsection}[hang] {\large\fontfamily{lmss}\mdseries\raggedright} {\thesubsection} {1em} {\underline} 
 To use this normally, I put this file in the same folder as the .tex file I am editing, and use \documentclass[11pt,letterpaper]{my_article}.
 I want to port this to org-mode, so that I can specify something like #+LATEX_CLASS: my_class at the start of the document.
 Is there someway that I can do this without having to repeatedly copy the .cls file into the working directory of the org file? I.e. specify this in my init.el file? For instance, this method in the worg tutorials is often suggested, but it seems to be for org-mode < v8.0.
 An alternative I've tried is to use #+SETUPFILE:~/my_template.org, which is a file that contains various #+LATEX_HEADER:\usepackage{} lines. This works for declaring which packages are necessary, and for defining shortcuts, but I'm not sure it will work for defining pagestyles for example.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Greetings everyone!
 I am very new to the programming world and was introduced to this world by a friend of mine. After several hours of researching I accidentally stumbled upon haskell & the world of functional programming!
 At this very moment, I find myself puzzled about whether I should mainly write in haskell or not since the syntax of haskell, compared to other prgoramming languages, is rather more attractive I dare say.
 So I am here to kindly request help from more knowledgable haskell programmers to help me answer several questions that I am currently struggling to find answers to:
  
Should I be worried about software performance in general? I have been considering writing several applications in haskell that are somewhat performance dependent and as previously mentioned, I would rather have them be written in haskell than not if the performance is not strongly affected by this.
 Does haskell have good graphics libraries? If so, what is the performance disadvantage it has compared to languages like C/C++? I am interested in working with something similar to Inigo Quilez work.
 What is the current status of AI research in haskell? From my very simple searching, I noticed that it's not a popular programming language in the field of AI and I am honestly confused about why that is. Perhaps someone more knowledgable about this can explain to me why a language closer to mathematics is somehow further away from the mathematical research environment.
  
Other than that, I would like to thank you all for keeping this subreddit alive for newcomers like me to explore & learn from!

 The problem I have is with the Procfile. In the Yesod wiki it says that the file should contain:
 `web: ./dist/build/appname/appname production -p $PORT`
 ​
 However, that does not work. In the `heroku logs` it says that it can't find said directory. Also tried removing the production keyword for the command as suggested in a stack overflow question. Also tried ./dist/build/appname and every other variation :))
 ​
 Does anyone know how that path is chosen? Is it somehow linked with the buildpack that I've used?
 Any ideas on troubleshooting this?

 Any ideas?

 The main issues I have had are due to navigating when in normal mode and then switching back to insert mode (cursor can jump back to end of line) and other editing features like "Change-Inner-Word". 
 I have also tried disabling evil in Vterm and using a Vim mode for zsh, but that is super slow and unresponsive (changing modes takes like 0.5-1 second).
 Im pretty new to being evil, so wanted to know if anyone has any nice vterm setup to recommend. I have tried the solutions offered in that issues thread, but haven't had too much success.

While I know that a great guitar builder can be a terrible guitarist, I wonder if it matters that the "founding father" of the Zettelkasten system wrote books that felt disorganized and random.

 I am getting the "Warning: assignment to free variable" for anything I setq outside of a lexical scope, as well as the Warning: the function ‘my-function’ is not known to be defined and I know that my-function is loaded, and even natively compiled. 
 Sure, I can defvar, and declare-function these warnings away, but why the difference? byte-compilation produces no such warnings.

 Chemacs2 uses its own functions to set the environment variable DOOMDIR

 Is it possible to use something like that to extend the PATH, ie ~/emacsen/doom2/doom.d/bin/doom?
 One way I can think of is run emacs with a script that adds the configurations bin/doom before calling emacs, but I prefer it do it in the manner Chemacs2 sets the DOOMDIR, within an Elisp configuration script.

 I prefer cereal over binary because the Double encoding in cereal makes sense, but cereal is lacking quite a few things that binary has, such as instances for Scientific. The lack of instances from packages can be quite an obstacle to consistently using cereal.
 Is there a package for cereal providing instances for Scientific? I couldn't find one. I'm wondering whether to write a package cereal-instances similar to binary-instances. It would be my first Hackage package. I'm wondering whether people will find it useful and whether I would end up semi-plagiarizing binary-instances since the code is probably very simple and similar to the one in binary-instances.

 I wanted a tool to discover and explore new code bases inside emacs. While I was looking for this tool, I saw some pictures of ranger and I really liked the layout. I wanted that kind of layout for emacs.
 So I wrote bfs :)
 ​
 BFS - by Tony Aldon
 bfs (Browse File System) implements for emacs a dynamic tree view of the file system à la ranger.
 This is a new "environment" accessible via the command bfs.
 I hope you will like it.
 ---> https://github.com/tonyaldon/bfs
 ps: As I said in the README:
  
bfs doesn't try to implement the features offered by ranger (only the layout),
 bfs isn't a file manager (I personaly still use dired, wdired and any shell for more elaborated tasks applying to files).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello community,
 Do you have suggestions on state of the art libraries or frameworks to parse huge XML files? Alternatively, what's the best approach in tackling this problem with Scala?
 ​
 Disclaimer: I don't have a CS or IT background and have very little experience with pure Scala, I mostly use Spark and Python daily, but I wanted to start filling my skills gaps within the data engineering realm for a long-term goal. I think I know the difference between SAX and DOM parsing, so I was looking for something to implement the former (amirite? :D)
 ​
 Disclaimer 2: this question stems from an interview assignment that required something like this plus other features (streaming solution, JSON output), but after spending too much time just on learning the different parsing approaches I told them I wouldn't proceed: even though it's something easy for the average programmer, it clearly shows my huge gaps in knowledge and programming skills. But I still want to work on it in my own time.
 ​
 Thanks a lot in advance and sorry if it's a silly question. Cheers!

 (setq org-agenda-custom-commands '(("d" "Daily agenda and all TODOs" ((agenda "" ((org-agenda-span 4)(org-agenda-tag-filter-preset (quote (""))))) (alltodo "" ((org-agenda-tag-filter-preset (quote ("-habit"))) (org-agenda-compact-blocks t) )))))) 
 The code should show me four days of schedule plus whatever TODOs I have lying around that aren't scheduled (showing both means this post doesn't really tell me what I'm doing wrong). But it either fully excludes the Habit tag (which is sometimes used for recurring/upkeep style tasks, like mopping the kitchen floor, and that "sometimes-but-not-always" nature of them excludes this post) or the command fully includes it, with no middle ground. I had hoped that setting the filter preset for each phase individually would prevent this (by making it have no filter for the agenda, and then a filter for the todos) but I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong.
 The code as listed filters out habit from both agenda and todo. If I remove "-habit" from the second instance of filter, it shows habits in both places. It does feel like the filter preset is only being checked once, but I'm honestly in way over my head already and at a loss for how to fix it.

 For me, I love Haskell because of it's huge potential for abstraction. And at least a lot of the time, abstraction means less, and more concise code. So, in many ways, I'd like to say that many Haskell libraries are actually "Low code" frameworks -- I think postgREST might be a perfect example of this.

 I am fairly new to org-mode. I have been trying to do something for a couple of weeks now, but I have run out of what I might need to be searching for to find out if it is possible.
 I am wanting a table to look up information in this (or different, if possible) org files hierarchy/structure.
 I am including an example of what I am trying to do below. I am very sure I can't be the first person to want to try this, my thoughts are not that unique or interesting. Does anyone have ideas for might work, or what I might want to consider trying as an alternative?
 Thanks all 🙂

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all. Ive used doom emacs for a while but recently got to making my own init file. Im quite happy and have basically all I need (you never have all you need but being realistic here). However I would really like to have a helper like in doom emacs, when I press my leader or even normal prefix keybinds I got a popup buffer telling me my options and that was really helpful to remember old or not so often used commands. Right now I think I don't have too many struggles but that's probably because Ive just made the file and have all the keybinds set up and read all the documentation of dozens of packages, if I ever dont use a leybind but remember vaguely how it starts, it would be awesome not to use some find functions or scouting my emacs file and or package files for the answer. 
 Sorry for slightly over explaining, help would be appreciated, thanks for your time.

benefits,
but comes with costs.
One of the most visible cost of laziness is hard to predict memory behavior, and so we
have, and need, tools to profile and measure the heap of our Haskell programs.
Most of the time, we live in a high-level world of type classes, monoids, and
isomorphisms. But at the end of the day our code needs to run on actual
machines, and when our code is run it needs to be performant. Typically, “be
performant”, means “have reasonable computational complexity” and so we usually
focus on good asymptotic behavior instead of constant costs. But when our
programs meet our CPUs, constant costs are important, and thus having low level
tools is helpful for low level optimizations, i.e., when you want to squeeze

 I am new to Emacs and have used it in the past few months mainly for VHDL coding. It had these wonderful shutter and electric modes which auto-filled the VHDL syntax making it easy for me to code (I was new to VHDL and emacs saved me).
 I have been using python for a few years now and wanted to enjoy some fun python coding on emacs. I mainly use libraries like numpy, scipy, matplotlib (pylab), pytorch and so on. I would really like to find a shutter-mode equivalent kind of mode for python. However, I am not sure of what to use since google had so many options and none of them very widely recommended. 
 So I would like you guys to help with some mode/add-on that would help me auto-fill the functions from these libraries and also any cool thing that would make my python coding with emacs fun!!

That is to say, I'm generally in the dark about Haskell package install. I did a stack ghci --package diagrams which seemed finally to install diagrams (after nine stack.yaml extra-deps additions) and start up a REPL (8.10.4). IAC, I could get the basic starter code DiagramsTutorial.lhs to load from the ghci prompt -- after doing :set -package diagrams-lib and :set -package diagrams-svg as it errored on Could not load module ‘Diagrams.Prelude’ etc. All right, then I tried as the tutorial says, i.e., $ ghc --make DiagramsTutorial.lhs This, however, errored out just like the ghci load with 
 diag1.hs:5:1: error: Could not load module ‘Diagrams.Prelude’ It is a member of the hidden package ‘diagrams-lib-1.4.3’. You can run ‘:set -package diagrams-lib’ to expose it. (Note: this unloads all the modules in the current scope.) Use -v (or `:set -v` in ghci) to see a list of the files searched for. 
 and same for import Diagrams.Backend.SVG.CmdLine I'm confused over the whole stack versus cabal thing in general. BTW, what's the most popular IDE for Haskell? I've been using Emacs, trying to use the org-mode babel depending on a REPL session, which is iffy at best. Also, a $ ghc --version says 8.8.4. I'm confused.

Also, there was a compelling benefit of Stack handling ghc for me.
 However, recently I got more into learning about cabal due to trying to publish a library on Hackage and having to better understand what a cabal package actually is and how to determine version bounds for my library, for its dependencies.
 As a result I decided to write a small article that gives overview of what Cabal and Stack are and also compares them, based on what I learned: https://github.com/wasp-lang/haskell-handbook/blob/master/cabal-and-stack.md . I focused a lot on comparing Cabal with other package managers out there.
 I would love to hear if I got something wrong in it, or if I missed something - any feedback is very welcome!
 Article is aimed for Haskell beginners, but assumes they already had some experience with other programming languages.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I have this odd thing going on with "hi-lock-mode" that I can't seem to figure out. I want to highlight a specific word in python-mode. And have this package config
 (use-package python :config (global-hi-lock-mode t) (add-hook 'python-mode-hook (lambda () (highlight-regexp "pass" 'hl-blue)))) 
 This work when I open a buffer with the keyword (here I can see "pass" in hl-word list), but does not work if I start a new python buffer, or open a file without the keyword (hl-word list is empty).
 I'm sure its something simple I've overlooked, but does anyone have an idea here?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For the last two-three days, I have been trying to wrap my head around functional reactive programming. I came across threepenny-gui while I have been trying to understand the concept.
 My understanding is that the difference between reactive programming as opposed to event-driven programming is that in reactive programming, one describes the behavior of the UI as a time varying function rather than how it behaves when certain events are triggerred. For example, Spreadsheet allow for reactive programming since we can say that a certain cell is related to some other cell in terms of a certain formula -- instead of having to say [When those cells update, change this cell according to this formula]. 
 When I look at the different examples included with threepenny-gui, I get the impression that they have not designed their programs reactively. For instance, if you see Mouse.hs, you see that they are saying
  on UI.mousemove wrap $ \xy -> element out # set text ("Coordinates: " ++ show xy) on UI.keydown wrap $ \c -> element out # set text ("Keycode: " ++ show c) 
 which binds the \c -> element out # set text ... handler to the events. This looks like event driven programming to me, instead of reactive programming. In a reactive program, one would just say that certain fields are bound to the coordinates of the mouse.
 I have also looked at Reactive.Threepenny and I think I understand the combinators but I do not understand how to use them to actually write reactive code.
 Is my understanding correct?
 If you have suggestions on how to phrase my code as reactively as possible in threpenny-gui, that would be welcome. If this is not the correct library for this sort of programming, what would be a good way to exemplify these ideas?

 What about other boolean operators, e.g. and, xor and implies ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sometimes I want to create some one-off modes to control more of my day-to-day tasks from emacs. Elisp is fun enough to code in, however one thing I find somewhat daunting is putting things into a buffer so that it looks nice.
 I am sure there must be some higher level "widget" or tui libraries out there that speed up that process without fiddling with manual placement of text and text properties, faces etc. I would really love to collect together some libraries here that you know. I couldn't find another comprehensive resource for this.
 To make a start, here are some I'm aware of:
  
magit-section: Create a ui like magit
 Taxy: Uses magit-section but in some cases makes it even more convenient and fast to put data into a buffer
 Tabulated List Mode: Not to forget the built-ins, tabulated list mode can also help setting up a buffer really fast if a tabulated list is all one needs
 Hierarchy: Put hierarchical data into a buffer with several convenience functions to display, query and action callbacks. Seems to be merged to emacs and even though the library is there, there is not documentation in the Elisp or Emacs manuals, so the git repo README is still useful for documentation.
 tree-widget.el: There seems to be a tree-widget.el in emacs core, seems this also can be used to build trees in buffers but I haven't used it and there seems to be no documentation in the Elisp or Emacs manuals about it so I don't really know how useful it is.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are trying to get a working Haskell dev environment on MacOS M1, and are having various problems with the different approaches we have taken.
 Our project currently uses an older nixpkgs that comes with ghc[js]-8.6.5, but this unsurprisingly does not work and is likely a wontfix.
 The obvious choice was upgrading nixpkgs to a new version. However it seems like entering a nix-shell with ghc does not work, even for a very simple project. It complains about a broken compiler-rt-libc, and allowing for broken packages leads to a failing build of compiler-rt-libc.
 Surprisingly nix-build does work for ghc, however our project is too large for nix-build to be practical for development, as build times are on the order of an hour.
 Another problem with newer nixpkgs is that ghcjs doesn't work at all, again even on simple projects. It errors out with a complaint about the happy test suite failing.
 Yet one more problem is that while newer ghcjs on non-M1 MacOS does work, it is massively slower, taking on the order of a day to build our project, occasionally requiring restarts due to running out of file handles.
 There are also problems with running newer ghcjs versions on Ubuntu, as our project deterministically fails with an Data.Binary.Get.runGet at position 0: not enough bytes error.
 Due to the above we have been instead focusing on getting ghc-8.6.5 working on MacOS M1 without nix via Rosetta.
 However this has been very difficult due to C dependencies. We have uninstalled and reinstalled the necessary brew libraries in x86 arch mode, but cabal does not seem to be able to find them either way.
 So what I was more or less wondering was what other people have gotten working on MacOS M1, in case there is anything we can learn from that to get our project building on it.

 (latex :variables latex-backend 'lsp latex-build-command 'latexmk latex-build-engine 'xetex latex-enable-auto-fill t latex-enable-folding t latex-enable-magic t latex-view-with-pdf-tools t latex-view-pdf-in-split-window t latex-refresh-preview t) and 
 and 
 (defun dotspacemacs/user-init () (add-hook 'doc-view-mode-hook 'auto-revert-mode) (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.tex\\'" . LaTeX-mode)) (setq TeX-source-correlate-mode t) (setq TeX-source-correlate-start-server t) (setq TeX-source-correlate-method 'synctex) (setq TeX-view-program-list '(("PDF Tools" TeX-pdf-tools-sync-view))) (setq TeX-view-program-selection '((output-pdf "PDF Tools"))) (add-hook 'TeX-after-compilation-finished-functions #'TeX-revert-document-buffer) (setq-default dotspacemacs-configuration-layers '(pdf-tools)) (add-hook 'pdf-view-mode-hook (lambda() (linum-mode -1))) "Initialization for user code:This function is called immediately after `dotspacemacs/init', before layerconfiguration.It is mostly for variables that should be set before packages are loaded.If you are unsure, try setting them in `dotspacemacs/user-config' first.")

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[org-depend is nice, but it feels clunky to me - I use org-capture to add tasks to my to-do list whenever they occur to me, so I often end up with something like:
 * TODO Task 1 * WAIT Task 2 * WAIT Task 1.5 
 ...where I forgot there was a task that needed to be done between 1 and 2, and have to add it in later. In this situation, the "chain-siblings" trigger keyword to move tasks from "WAIT" to "TODO" doesn't really work out - plus, what about situations where Task 1 is a blocker for multiple other tasks, not all of which need to be completed in sequence?
 The trigger that works based on IDs seems more generally useful, but also even less ergonomic. If you want Task 1.5 to be enabled automatically after Task 1 is done, you have to create a UUID for 1.5, copy it, navigate to Task 1, and create a trigger property for it with the copied UUID value - which would certainly be a pain in the ass to do from e.g. the agenda.
 Something like org-linker-edna would be nice, but its functionality is tied pretty closely to Helm (I'm an Ivy user). Is ergonomic dependency creation (that is, with completion) something I'm gonna have to script up myself, or are there existing developments in this space?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm going kinda crazy trying to understand what's going on here...
 Do org blocks allow TAB indentation without going into special editing mode via C-c ' ?
 I have the following relevant settings in my custom-set-variables block (i.e. edited via customize-mode.
  '(org-edit-src-content-indentation 0) '(org-src-preserve-indentation nil) 
 I used these settings because I was getting sick of editing code in the source block and having all the lines jump 2 spaces to the right.
 org-src-tab-acts-natively is set to t as well. 
 But now when I write
 #+begin_src python def hello(): | #+end_src 
 the cursor is stuck at the start of the line and I can't use TAB to indent to add a new line, i.e. to make it look like:
 def hello( ): print("hello) 
 TAB used to work -- or atleast, I thought it was working. This github comment suggests that this facility was never actually available, and we always had to use C-c ' to edit code properly.
 Now, I have also set org-adapt-indentation to nil, because I prefer org-headings, sub-headings and text to be aligned with the buffer edge. If I set it to 1, it looks like there is some aligning going on when I hit TAB, but this is not perfect. Does this explain the "pseudo-indenting" that I had before, and there really is no inherent TAB indent in org blocks?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I just started learning Common Lisp, mostly because there is a university class I could take in the future in which they just assume you already know the language going in; and so I downloaded the Portacle IDE, which is a bundle of (a forked version of?) Emacs, SBCL, QuickLisp, and Git. 
 Currently, I am only using Emacs for my rudimentary Lisp programming, because I don't quite understand how to use Emacs properly. To put it into perspective, I find the much maligned text editor Vim far easier to use than Emacs, even though I had never really used the terminal in such a involved manner before I started programming with Vim. 
 If I decided to download the "regular" version of Emacs to use for every programming language I know later in time, would that interfere with Portacle's version of Emacs?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi! I'm trying to learn Haskell for web development, and I've decided on IHP (for now, as it is the easiest way to get something working fast). But I am still fairly new to both web development and Haskell as a language, so it'd be great to have somebody on a similar level of knowledge to talk things through and help each other.
 We would work on a project from scratch (doesn't really matter what, it's just to practice and learn) for about one or two hours a day until we're satisfied with how much we've learned. We can do it in either English or Spanish (my native language)
 So, I'm sending this to the universe, hoping there's someone in a similar position to me... Just write here in the comments or DM me.
 Thanks for reading, and happy hacking!!

For some reason every newline emacs indents the lines above and leaves the newline with no indentation.

 The indentation in my config.org
 In that example, I want each line with fs to be indented rightwards. What causes this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This small package essentially provides glue code between org-odt-convert and org-table-convert-region, enabling one to open a spreadsheet file (e.g., xlsx, ods) or a text-delimited file (e.g., csv) in a special buffer, edit it with org-table- and orgtbl- commands, and then save it back to the original file in its original format.
 https://github.com/shankar2k/orgtbl-edit
 I made this package because I often find myself wanting to make small edits to CSV files that would be very convenient to do with org-table- commands (e.g., shift a column left or right), but I don't want to deal with the overhead every time of importing the file, converting it to Org, and then exporting back to the same file format.
 Because a picture is worth a thousand words, here is an example XLSX file:
 An example XLSX file.
 And here is the same file when opened in Emacs using orgtbl-edit:

 One thing to note is that for spreadsheet files, because this currently uses CSV as an intermediate format, when saving back to the original file, all formatting and formulas will be lost. 
 I hope some of you find this useful!

 I should specify: using the terminal, sending mail with msmtp/sendmail works well with multiple accounts. The problem is with emacs itself not using it correctly... Or something?
 If you use this setup, how do you do specify the account you want to use to send the mail? Is there a configuration that makes this work?

 Don't know where else to ask, seems like a good place. Couldn't find any good resource online.

 If we treat this as definitive:
 ​
 https://redmonk.com/dberkholz/2013/03/25/programming-languages-ranked-by-expressiveness/ 
 ​
 Haskell is about 33% more concise than Python, and 85% more concise than C++ / Java. It's less concise than Coffeescript by about 22%. However, this resource is sort of obsolete, and SLOC is not necessarily a good metric (it doesn't consider how many elements exist on one line).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[First I tried generating a LALR(1) parser via Wisent parser generator but it lacks support for some of the features of the PHP grammar so then I started reading books about parsing and constructed a parser-generator library for Emacs. I used this to automatically parse the official PHP YACC grammar and convert into into a format supported by my parser-generator library and export a Canonical LR(1) Parser in Emacs-Lisp for phps-mode.
 In the future I have planned to use this parser to build semantic data, bookkeeping of symbols and build the imenu index. It would be pretty easy to use the parser to transpile PHP to almost anything. My major-mode is in GNU ELPA

Integrated support for ivy-erlang-complete and company-erlang to work on Erlang code without an Erlang node while having full auto-completion and cross-reference navigation across Erlang project and the Erlang library.
 Support for EDTS
 Support for LSP via lsp-mode and erlang-ls
  
PEL attempts to unify the use of several commands. For instance you can use the M-. key for cross-refernce navigation with any of the supported cross reference packages that work with Erlang. You select the package you want to use via customization and that's what PEL uses by default, mapping the command to the M-. key. During an editing session you can…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi! I recently switched to Embark, Consult, and Vertico. I'm having a swell time doing noun-verb instead of verb-noun. One thing I missed from my old setup was the ability to recall the last minibuffer I had open, using ivy-resume. Does something like that exist for Embark/Consult/Vertico, maybe as a plugin or something? Thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm currently learning Haskell, and am looking for an IDE that has features like instant highlighting of errors.
 I'm trying to write basic functions like get an Integer-list as input and apply some function, nothing complicated. But I fail to find anything usable, that helps me doing this. I just want to instantly know when I write total garbage. For example if my functions have the wrong type, etc.
 I'm currently trying to tweak atom with ide-haskell, but I only get default syntax highlighting of keywords. When I run ghci my_program.hs I get shitloads of errors because my functions are not even syntactically right. Is it possible to get these errors in the IDE while typing (like in any other language)?
 Is this all that I can get from this plugin, or am I missing something?

 I also get that if I make those operations non-blocking, I'm no longer limited in this way: I give an operation to a thread, it kicks it off, and then it's free for more work.
 What I don't get is how this is so. Is the thread handing the operation off to the os and saying "tell me when it's done"? If so, how does the os not get jammed up in the same way as our blocking/5-thread app? It seems like at some point there must be a thing that waits on the operation to complete.
 If it helps, here is an example of contrasting behavior: the first is async and parallel, the second blocking and parallel.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi ! 
 I've started learning and practicing Scala less than a year ago for my current job, and so far I love it. I learned following the Coursera course from the wonderful Martin Odersky, but I quickly realised that my company was still in the middle of its transition from Java to Scala, with most of our code base looking more like scalaified Java than pure FP Scala like I learned at the beginning.
 I like functional programming, I've liked it from the first moment I learned common Lisp even thou the language felt antiquated, and, well, I wouldn't say I cried, but I was somewhat moved by the....purety ? Mathematicality ? of scala ( don't judge, IK my sense of esthetic is somewhat weird ). 
 Things seem to be somewhat moving in this direction at work, and I wanted to accompany this, and satisfy my own curiosity, by learning the move fp-extremist stuff I could find in Scala. 
 I could easily find resources on cats and the rest of the typelevel ecosystem, but then I discovered ZIO and that became my latest obsession. I like the project, I like how ZIO code looks and what the whole obsessive typing of everything thingy brings to me as a Dev.
 And then I tried to learn Zio 2.0 ( because why start with the old one when the next one is almost there ? ) but I have a hard time finding learning resources.
 Which bring me to my question ( thanks for reading my life story if you did ) : is the Zionomicon, and Zio in general, worth the time and money I would invest ?
 
 TLDR : weirdo ranting on his new fp zealotry wants to know if paying 50+ bucks for the Zionomicon is worth it

 Gives an answer like this.
 My question is if i could zip the lists of a list, so that i could get [(0,0,0) (1,0,0) (2,0,0)] and so on.

 Bonus question, I'm looking to combine a weekly and daily entries automatically. I would like to have a list of todo's for the week, defined in my weekly entry, and display those at the top of my dailies automatically (creating the weekly if no exists yet). I don't want to use carry over in org-journal as that doesn't quite do what I'd like. I'm certain this could be achieved somehow 😃

 Hi there,
 I hope that the minibuffer prompts in emacs left bottom corner, such as M-x Find-file, which is produced by Function (minibuffer-prompt) defined in C source code, could be hidden/ disabled/ removed/ deleted.
 I have tried, but failed:
 (add-hook 'minibuffer-setup-hook (lambda() (put 'minibuffer-prompt 'disable t)))
 (add-hook 'minibuffer-setup-hook (lambda() (fmakunbound 'minibuffer-prompt)))
 Could somebody help? : (
 ​
 Update:
 It's done! Making selectrum + mini-frame + posframe pops up as company-mode does. Thanks _viz_ !

When I am flicking through my recent files and encounter a python file, lsp mode immediately starts upon me being shown a preview of the file. Is there a way to have lsp start only when the file is actually opened?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apologies if this doesn't make sense, but I'm struggling to find out how to express this question.
 Someone recently submitted a post or a comment about how they use use-package to configure all the packages they've installed in their init.el. I'm not sure exactly what I mean by all packages, I think I mean packages/settings that weren't installed using use-package ensure, or straight inside the use-package configuration, or maybe even that the packages weren't installed via MELPA, but by cloning a git repository. 
 In any case there was a comment that (briefly) explained how to configure the package setup and behavior using a use-package configuration; I thought I'd saved it but didn't, now I can't seem to find it. If anyone has any idea what I'm going on about, please let me know!
 EDIT: I believe what I was looking for was use-package emacs and storing Emacs settings like (setq inhibit-startup-screen t) there, as raised in this post, found by u/graduale and u/scbagley. From other comments, it sounds like you can also configure built-in packages like dired using use-package as well, so that's helpful. If you have any further thoughts on this, please feel free to add them!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm happy to announce my first library on Hackage, jordan. Jordan provides abstract and inspectable JSON parsing and serialization, using the Applicative (for parsing) and Divisible (for serializing) typeclasses.
 Jordan has you define ToJSON and FromJSON classes in terms of instructions, such as "serialize a string" or "parse an object with these fields". These instructions are then evaluated by various interpreters, which actually do the work of parsing or serializing. This has a few benefits:
  
Intermediate structures are entirely avoided: there is no Map.Map Text JSONValue anywhere in the library, and JSON fields are directly parsed using permutation parsers. This also means that we can always serialize a JSON directly to a bytestring, avoiding the need for anything like toEncoding from Aeson
 Since JSON interaction is kept abstract, you can generate documentation for parsers and serializers, directly from their definitions. This is provided in jordan-openapi.
 This library provides a fun excuse to use contravariant functors, so you can feel like a super small functional programmer
  
The github page for this project is located here. While I'm not gunning to replace Aeson or anything, I would really appreciate any feedback anybody has to offer!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For comparison: Akka actors can manage mutable state without thread-safety concerns, since each actor will only only process one message at a time.
 Taking the principle to fibers, is there any thread-safety or practical problems with using mutable state inside fiber (think vars), as long as the state is not share with other fibers? I'm not talking about Refs, which use AtomicReferences under the hood. I'm talking about closing directly over mutable state, and reading and writing to it as required on a per-fiber basis.
 An example of this may be the re-use of buffer: Array[Byte] in this part of the Cats Effect tutorial.

 Has anyone done any text-based video editing/composition with Emacs? Either with elisp packages used to stitch the content together or with an Emacs mode for editing some sort of text-based markup that is fed to OSS libraries like gstreamer etc?

add allow-loopback-entry to ~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf (then run gpgconf --reload gpg-agent)
 make sure that epg-pinentry-mode is set to 'loopback in emacs
  
however, after doing that I still see that
  
when running emacs in X what pops up is pinentry-gtk-2, and
 when running emacs in a console what pops up is pinentry-curses
  
Clearly I'm missing something, but what?

​
 Is it also true that if sptr is the static pointer of created in module M and I add some unrelated entries in M (the same module) the static pointer sptr does not change ?

 Is it possible to retrieve all the contents of "Sphere"?
 I am trying to retrieve the contents through an external function which I make like this:
 SphereData :: obj -> [] SphereData (...) 
 I am pretty new to Haskell and have been looking around on the internet for a solution, but none have had the specific "problem" that I have.
 ​
 I could maybe use pattern matching. In my head this is the best bet I have, but that won't work, because "obj" is given and based on the pattern match either an Int or String is returned. In no way or shape can I return all the "properties" of this Set.
 ​
 Any ideas, tips, tricks?

 I was watching this great talk on Reproducible Research by Thibault Lestang, demonstrating the power of Org Babel. His org file is here:
 https://github.com/tlestang/org-mode-reproducible-research/blob/main/org-mode-examples/RR.org
 The initial C++ code block works great to produce the array initial_data, but the subsequent python code block to plot the array doesn't work:
 #+header: :var timeseries=initial_data :results file :dir "./figures/" #+begin_src python import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt timeseries = np.array(timeseries) plt.plot(timeseries[:,0], timeseries[:,1]) plt.savefig("timeseries_vis.png") return "timeseries_vis.png" #+end_src #+RESULTS: [[file:figures/timeseries_vis.png]] 
 If I run the above I get: 
 #+RESULTS: file:figures 
 and no actual png output file is produced. If I run the block in :session mode that gives me IndentationError: Unexpected Indent. If I remove the indents and re-run I get SyntaxError: return outside function. I can get rid of this error by re-writing it as a function, and it then works. But I'd really like to know what is wrong with the original code, and how can I run it without :session? 
 Many thanks!

 I have browsed the dired chapter on emacs manual, but have not found how to do something very simple: preview file contents like with ranger. With ranger I can move up or down over a list of files with arrows, and I can preview their contents at the side, regardless of the content being simple text, image, pdf, etc. How can I do the same with emacs? I saw a video of someone doing that with Doom Emacs, however I am not keen on using Doom or similar packages, I prefer to have a simple init.el that I can understand.

 Doesn't happen every time, tried font-lock studio, but I don't get it! Toggling global-font-lock-mode off/on fixes.
 Any ideas? Will grab a screenshot when it happens next.

 Morton Ordering
 If you have multidimensional data and interleave the binary representation of each key, you get a neat space-filling curve called a z-order curve. Ed wrote a series about using them to do sparse matrix multiplication.
 I've also seen them used when you need to crunch multidimensional keys into a single dimension e.g., when you need to be able to use a DynamoDB sort key to search across multiple dimensions.
 Contravariant Tricks
 In Ed's discrimination library (see also: the talk Discrimination is Wrong: Improving Productivity), he uses the contravariant hierarchy to sort all kinds of things really quickly. Many instances …]]></summary>

 That said, I would really really like a way to integrate org-mode functionality on my Nextcloud server. So I was wondering if it's possible to compile emacs to WASM.
 The biggest problem I foresee, as far as usability goes, is that the browser would swallow/usurp/hijack many of the default emacs key chords. For evil users, this is not such a problem, :-) , but not everyone is evil.

Only issue is that I don't think it can be used on windows. It'll be great to open a media player like vlc, a browser (sometimes eww isn't enough), watch youtube... etc from emacs. I'd like to know if there are independent solutions to these or a package that can do multiple. Any help is appreciated. Thanks

However, the name conflict between lense and traditional field selectors makes it a bit awkward to use : you either go full lenses or at all. Mix and match doesn't really work.
 Also having to rely on TH induces some problems, and type errors can get overly complicated.
 I basically given up on them (the only real use being nested update which are kind of rare, and should be solved soon within GHC).

Dart is not terrible, but I always miss the ML types and abstractions, and very specially the strict purity.
 I see there are many backends out there, and dart supports many purescript data types (with some lack). Also not sure how to deal with the mutable aspects of dart in the purescript side.
 If this is a feasible work to do under two months I would give it a try and ask for some help in order to build a robust open source backend with the goal of becoming a real ASAP.
 Is there any information relative to making new backends including standardized tests? Is there anyone interested willing to contribute?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I encounter some font spacing problems on macOS when I switch my font from time to time: especially when the default font :weight 'light is used, something about bold constructs throws whitespace off, of all things -- the space character is rendered a bit too wide, then.
 (defun ct/use-face (font weight height) (let ((the-font (format "%s-%d:%s" font height weight))) (message the-font) (setq default-frame-alist (append (list `(font . ,the-font) '(min-height . 1) '(height . 45) '(min-width . 1) '(width . 101) '(vertical-scroll-bars . nil) '(internal-border-width . 24) ;; frame padding around the text '(left-fringe . 0) '(right-fringe . 0) '(tool-bar-lines . 0))))) (set-face-attribute 'default nil :font font :height (* height 10) :weight weight) (set-face-attribute 'fixed-pitch nil :font font :height (* height 10) :weight weight)) (defun ct/use-medium-face () "Use Roboto Medium 18pt, for smaller screens" (interactive) (ct/use-face "Roboto Mono" 'medium 18) (setq-default line-spacing .2)) (defun ct/use-regular-face () "Use Roboto Light 22pt, for larger screens." (interactive) (ct/use-face "Roboto Mono" 'light 22) (setq-default line-spacing .3)) 
 I would love to replace this manual font switching, which might be broken, with something more robust that ideally adjusts to the frame size.
 Use case
 I'm switching from my MacBook's 13" Retina display on the go to a 1440p ultra-wide at my desk, and enjoy different font settings for each. The desk's monitor is further away from my face and I use the 22pt font setting for most of the time there. That's way too big for the built-in laptop screen, though, so I use the 18pt font variant there.
 Do you know of any well-tested package that supports changing font sizes (and weights) to make the best use of a frame's size given the circumstances?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi Zettelnauts,
now that a major leap forward (for me) is done with the second edition (the beta phase in German begins soon and after that I will attack the English translation), I am turning my eyes on more specialised applications.
The development of the second books so far was driven by beginning with Luhmann as the core idea and unfold it with the help of philosophy of science. So, I deem the foundation to be layed out.
The next two branches that start to grow (in my Zettelkasten first) are:
Specialised applications of the Zettelkasten
Thinking tools that work within the frame work of the Zettelkasten Method. Cognitive Mapping is an example. (Big shoutout to u/thomasteepe for the term Integrated Thinking Environment (originally Integrated Thought Development Environment))
The first aspect is now what I am preparing in my Zettelkasten. So, I want to ask you if I forgot an important user case. In my Zettelkasten, I have the following:
Students
Teachers (Mostly geared towards the German Schools System at the moment)
Bloggers
Visual Artists
Fiction Writers
Non-Fiction Writers
Lawers and judges
Theologicans (and studying the bible)
Scientists
Humanities
Non-Scientists (~private use like dog training, cooking, hobbies, child upbringing etc.)
Anything missing?
Live long and prosper

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Emacs has cooperative threading which AFAIK does not prevent a badly behaving thread locking up the UI. Since real multithreading is hard to add to Emacs could forking support alleviate this? 
 So unlike emacs-async which starts with a fresh emacs, you could create from lisp a copy of the current process with all the settings, variables, etc. being the same, so, for example, a lisp autocompletion library could use fork to spin up an other process and calculate the possible completions of the current position, returning these asynchronously to the parent process thereby not interfering with UI updates.
 I know creating processes is more costly than creating threads, but with today's computers it may be still fast enough to produce asynchronous results for completion, etc. without blocking the UI thread.
 Forking is supported by all major OSs, so could this be a good enough solution for async processing?

I've found a couple of tutorials, guides, docs, and walk throughs but to a person new to all this, it can be a bit overwhelming. So, to help the next new guy who comes here I'm posting my org configuration complete with comments. 
 I doubt most people will use org anything like what I need to use it for, however this configuration shows you how to configure a lo of things that might not immediately be obvious and will hopefully serve as a good foundation for building your own work flow.

 Based on my init.el and package sources I suspect that in my case they are at the same level and the consult-* function was provided as advice second. But how can I be sure? I couldn't find a way to inspect the details of a function's advice with a look through the elisp manual.

 Lazy lists are wonderful to work with, but may be hard to create for some sequences (such as those which require the use of mutable state to generate efficiently).
 Various generator libraries make it easier to generate such sequences, but the trade-off is that using them is typically more cumbersome. 
 Theoretically, one would be able to get the "best of both worlds" by converting a generator to a lazy list. Is there a good way to do so in Haskell? If so, what is it?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, some quick background on me:
  
I am trying to get into Scala as I wish to work with Spark. I have good scripting knowledge in a few high-level languages (PowerShell mainly, plus Python and general Bash/awk scripting), and I'd like to break into a more rigorous programming paradigm. Another potential plus is that my company product is written in Java. I don't implement any code, but I do handle its technical implementation and design augmentations for customers. I may find an opportunity to leverage Scala in the JVM for some side projects to help me practice. 
 At any rate, my motivation for learning Scala is that it seems well-aligned with my goals and circumstances for entering a more programmatic world.
  
Books
 After looking around, I've picked out 3 books:
  
Programming in Scala Fifth Edition
 
Hands-on Scala Programming: Learn Scala in a Practical, Project-Based Way 
 
Programming Scala: Scalability = Functional Programming + Objects
 
 I saw a lot of good things about Programming in Scala Fourth Edition, and being that it's written by Martin Odersky, it seems like a solid choice. However, the Fifth Edition claims to have been overhauled for Scala 3, and it's too new for me to find any reviews on how this overhauled edition has turned out.
 Hands-on Scala Programming has good reviews and seems like it might be oriented toward a beginner specifically with its "project-based" approach. However being published in 2020, I'd expect it to have been written for Scala 2. I figured if I am jumping into Scala, I should go for a Scala 3 book.
 The book by Dean Wampler seems like a solid book, but I can't find much info on it in terms of reviews.
 Does anyone have experience with any of these books and could provide their 2 cents on it?
 Thank you!

In this case I restart that command, find the history item, copy it, cancel the command, start the command I want and paste the history item into it.
 This is cumbersome, so I created this small code which keeps track of commands' history usage, and it can show the recent history items of the recent commands for quick selection.
 Just load it, use Emacs for a bit, so it can track some minibuffer input usage and then invoke the command otherhistory-choose-from-other-history to quickly recall and insert a recent history item of a recent command.
 ;; -*- lexical-binding: t -*- (setq otherhistory-recent-history-variables '(minibuffer-history)) (advice-add 'exit-minibuffer :before 'otherhistory-store-history-variable) (defun otherhistory-store-history-variable () (setq otherhistory-recent-history-variables (remove minibuffer-history-variable otherhistory-recent-history-variables)) (push minibuffer-history-variable otherhistory-recent-history-variables)) (defun otherhistory-choose-from-other-history () (interactive) (let ((items (apply 'append (mapcar (lambda (history-var) (if (boundp history-var) (let ((history (symbol-value history-var))) (butlast history (- (length history) 5))))) otherhistory-recent-history-variables)))) (setq items (butlast items (- (length items) (- ?z ?a)))) (insert (let ((char (- ?a 1)) chars (max-mini-window-height 1.0)) (nth (- (read-char-choice (concat (mapconcat (lambda (item) (push (incf char) chars) (format " %c: %s" char item)) items "\n") " ") chars) ?a) items)) (message ""))))

 ​
 When trying to open org-agenda
 org-element-cache-map: Symbol’s function definition is void: native-comp-available-p
 ​
 I fixed this by adding
 (defun native-comp-available-p () nil)
 to my org configuration (just making sure this function is avaialble before calling org-agenda. (I am not using native-comp - still using Emacs 27.2)
 ​
 I can't seem to track down where this function should be defined. Is there something I should have installed but missed? I was surprised by this error.
 ​
 Anyways hope this helps someone else and if you have any ideas as to where this error originated I would love to know.

In particular when it comes to newlines. I frequently use \\ when I want to start a newline in my LaTeX output, but don't want extra spacing. Is there a way to hide this symbol in org-mode? I find it visually quite distracting. I have hide-emphasis-markers activated, but this doesn't affect the \\ symbol. Any way to hide \\?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I'm trying to automate grading of Haskell assignments. I don't know whether the students have defined all of the functions I need to test. Thus, I'd like to run something
 ghci> try (map foo [1,2,3])
 rather than manually comb through submissions like
 ghci> map foo [1,2,3]
 <interactive>:1:5: error:
 Variable not in scope: foo :: Integer -> b
 I know shell/bash well enough to do this there, but it would be nice to be able to do it in Haskell. Is it possible?
 ​
 (edit to note that I'm not fluent in Haskell myself (I'm trying to just keep ahead of the students), and have been using Haskell From First Principles as a guide).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I started reading about optics in haskell, and was wondering if any of the haskell optics libraries supports the concepts of alignment from the view update literature?
 Here is an example of what I want to do:
 Source (a): [ { name: "Patrick", age: 40, job: "Programmer" }, { name: "Jonathan", age 30, job: "Teacher" }, { name: "George", age: 20, job: "Office worker" } ] Target (b): [ { name: "Bob", job: "Policeman" },//person added { name: "George", job: "Office worker" }//Order changed, is now before Patrick { name: "Patrick", job: "Haskell Programmer" }//job changed //Jonathan removed ] Expected result (a): [ { name: "Bob", age: null, job: "Policeman" },//person added with default age { name: "George", age: 20, job: "Office worker" }, { name: "Patrick", age: 40, job: "Haskell Programmer" }//Job updated //Jonathan removed ] data Lens a b = Lens { get:: a -> b, put:: b -> a -> a } 
 How can I write the "put" function that takes "Source" and "Target" and returns "Expected result"? The put function must align the persons by name (key based alignment).

 But i've found that just running "emacs" doesnt connect with that server, we have to put
 "emacsclient -nw" or "emacsclient --create-frame" for gui, in order to have as many as client but one server. i put in gnome, "emacs.desktop" to run that emacsclient gui. but it takes "2 seconds to load" , while normal emacs command loads in 0.6 second. with in that, It automatically closes when i dont touch it . I also tried to add 8.8.8.8 "emacs" on /etc/hosts but it doesnt works. 
 I think dont understand , about client and server on emacs, which is client or which is server and what should i put in order to run emacs client in that server. 
 I've taken reference to make .desktop put "emacsclient --create-frame" and run from

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Basically what the title says. 
 I've been using org-tree-slide, which works fine for simple presentations, but I'm looking for something slightly more elaborate while still working inside emacs (i.e. no org-reveal or beamer). Something that offers a few presentation commodities like simple animations and a little more control over slide appearance. 
 Is there such a package?
 ps: I've looked into org-present, but it seems to be even more bare-bones than org-tree-slide.

 cgroup-rts-threads is a new library that solves a problem we experienced while running our haskell code in docker containers.
 In short, the GHC RTS -N flag will happily spawn threads exceeding a container's configured cpu limit, leading to drastically reduced performance.
 See the package README for details.
  
We'd be happy to accept contributions, including one to reduce the dependency footprint -- this code was previously part of a bigger codebase.
  
Somewhat relatedly, a quick plug: we're actively hiring for a haskeller to join our team (remote - US/Canada/Argentina) to work on our dependency analysis tool and associated backend components.
 This is the first package we've published, and we'd love to contribute some more. Come help us do that!

Is there any emacsy command for those or is the recommended way is simply to use vile mode for such situations?

I do use doom emacs on my chromebook (so no issues with this there) but on my other systems, I simply use vanilla emacs.

 Any ideas what variable or settings may have caused this behavior? It was working as designed a couple of weeks ago. I recently got doom package running, but no change when I comment that out in the config.

 I tried clearing my straight cache and pulling a few more times, nothing seems to fix it. Looking at the elisp for org, the function org-in-archived-heading-p seems like its defined in org.el, so I'm confused as to why the symbol isn't being found.
 Has anyone else seen something like this?

 However, when I went to 'recover session', it doesn't seem to be possible to get back to where I was.
  
the relevant .saves-[etc]~ file seems to only list unsaved files, so apparently if there were things I had had open but had saved they don't appear. Non-file buffers also don't seem to be listed.
 when i attempt to recover the session, it asks if I want to recover one of the six files listed, then seems to quit. Even when I press ! which the help tells me will 'recover all remaining files', it only reopens the one.
  
​
 I'm starting to accept the idea that I won't be able to get back to where I was last night, but is there a way to set up emacs so that it saves all aspects of a session, so that next time I can actually recover and get back all my frames, windows, tabs, and buffers after a forced (or even voluntary...) shutdown, not just a single unsaved file?
 And (Or?) how do I get it to at least recover the other files M-x recover session knows about but doesn't seem to be reaching?

 does anyone know of an open source project/web app/library, written in Haskell, that makes terminal interface accessible via browser?
 An example of what I'd like to achieve:
 Start R repl process withing a docker container on the backend (e.g. `docker run -it --rm rocker/r-base`) and allow user to interact with it using terminal-like interface from their browser (with stuff like TAB completion working etc.)
 It seems that xterm.js is a popular choice to implement the client side of such a thing,
 but I'm looking for some inspiration of how a backend of such an application could be implemented in Haskell.
 Examples in other languages that do similar thing to what I'd like:

 When I started developing strong-path, I haven't specified any dependency versions in package.yaml, since I knew it will pull whatever is provided by the Stack resolver I am using, and that worked fine for me.
 At some point I started needing the newer version of `path` package than the version that was present in the LTS resolver, so I added `path-0.9.0` und…]]></summary>

 votesCandidate :: [(String,(String,String,String))] -> String -> Int

 electionWinner :: [(String,(String,String,String))] -> String

 I've been doing some type-programming lately, and realized the stuff I'm writing is significantly different than the world as it existed in 2018. We now have quantified constraints, HKDs, kind-generics, and all sorts of other cool techniques. 
 Since 2018, there have also been lots of other books! I haven't been great at keeping up --- but has anything superseded TwT? If so, there's probably not much reason in pushing out a new edition.
 But if there's sufficient interest, I'd be more than keen to put it together. Let me know!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone,I'm trying to create a "visit_count_file" property for each org file I have. The code I'm doing should:
  
create the property value equal to 1 if it's not here yet
 increments the property value each time you open the file
  
Here is what I came up with for now
 (defun lkr/increment-visit-count () "increments the 'file_visit_count' property +=1" (interactive) (org-entry-put 0 "file_visit_count" (number-to-string (+ (string-to-number (org-entry-get 0 "file_visit_count")) 1)))) (defun lkr/update-visit-count () "creates or increments the 'file_visit_count' property" (if (org-entry-get 0 "file_visit_count") (lkr/increment-visit-count) (org-entry-put 0 "file_visit_count" "1"))) (add-hook 'org-mode-hook 'lkr/visit-count-update) 
 the problem is that it creates the property value in the first heading of the file if the heading is in the first line, and create the property at the top of the file otherwise. How can I do to always put the property at the top of the file?
 behavior:
 ​
 * first heading :PROPERTIES: :file_visit_count: 1 :END: 
 wanted behavior:
 :PROPERTIES: :file_visit_count: 1 :END: * first heading 
 I just started to fiddle with org mode and emacs lisp so I'm not very good at it. Thanks for reading.
 Bonus question:would it be easy to do the same but instead of putting it in a property drawer, putting it in
 #+visit_count_file: 1 * first heading 
 like this? what would be better in your opinion?Thank you again.

 I currently use Google's calendar. I have been looking for ways to use Emacs' calendar but I couldn't find solutions that check all my boxes:
  
Ability to subscribe to multiple calenders (via ics urls).
 Ability to have multiple calenders (like in Google, for example, I have one for work and one for personal events).
 Ability to create, delete and edit events.
 Ability to sync calendars with Google calendars (and Microsoft calendars if possible), so I can check events on my phone.
  
I imagine that these requirements are shared by others, so there must be a way to satisfy all of them. I just couldn't find it.
 Does anyone have a working setup for calendars that they can share?

 Edit: This seems to only be occurring on Windows. I just tried it on Debian and there's no issue. I've read that this has something to do with a Let's Encrypt certificate expiration, but have not found an immediate fix.

 There's tons of .org_archive files littered around my repo, and if I complete two different tasks on different machines, I get merge conflicts in the archive files. I think I'd rather just have it delete the entries and use Git in the unlikely even that I need to dig through the archives -- I think it's happened maybe two or three times in the 12 years (yikes!) I've been using Org Mode.
 I guess the only thing I'd be missing is explicitly recording TODO completion. If I just delete the TODO, it could have been done and closed, or unnecessary and not done. I'm definitely not going to change state, commit, delete, commit -- I think I can live with that loss for a cleaner repo.
 Is there a thing that makes archival work better with Git repos? What are y'all doing for this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a task that I've done using some Emacs and some command line tools (sort and cut), but it's slow and error prone and I reckon I could do it all in Emacs, but I don't quite know how.
 ​
 Please help me learn how to write some elisp to solve this...
 ​
 My problem:
  
I want to sort lines in a file based on a date string in the line itself.
 For simplicity: 
 There are two types of lines, but the structure is consistent within a type.
 type A might be: INSERT INTO tableA VALUES (something, something, '2021-11-11 11:11:11.111+00', something);
 type B might be: INSERT INTO tableB VALUES (something, '1999-12-31 01:01:01.001+00', something, '2021-11-11 22:22:22.222+00', something, something);
 I want the second date string in type B
 
 So based on seeing uniqueA or uniqueB in the string I know where(ish) the date string is
 Naturally, each line has different data for the something values and different date-time strings.
 There is a chance that the "line" may actually be broken with new-lines in the text, so what I know is that it starts with INSERT INTO and ends with );\n
  
​
 What I've done
  
Emacs: Define keyboard macro to search for tableA, then isearch-regex-forward for ..-..- to get my date string, copy that string, move to the start of the line, paste with a following space. C-u to apply lots of times, iterate until I have done all the lines
 Emacs: Define keyboard macro to search for tableB, then blah-blah-blah paste date at start of line with a following space. C-u to apply lots of times, iterate until I've done all the lines
 Jump back to my shell. sort the file, cut -f3- -d' ' the file and then I have my sorted file.
  
(I tried working out how to do the Emacs part in sed, but failed to see a useful example online...)
 ​
 This approach is complicated and error prone and not very reproducible.
 How would you go about it in Emacs?

In 2018, most options did not completely cut it for me, due to e.g. only formatting certain parts of the source file or having many unfortunate bugs. Upon discovering Ormolu in 2019, I was first appalled by its style, but this reaction was only short-lived, as I found these stylistic preferences to be easily malleable via familiarisation.
I started using Ormolu for all personal projects, and submitted bug reports and minor pull requests. Therefore, an internship to work on Ormolu full-time came like a call!

 Quick Facts:
  
This is a remote position. If you prefer an office environment and live in or are willing to relocate to Toronto that works for us.
 We are looking for a mid/senior level hire. We love to hire junior candidates with great promise, but at this point the team isn't yet large enough to share the training effort.
 The working hours for this position are in Toronto local time (ET)
 Authorized to work in US/CA is a slam dunk. Other countries are possible but we may need to do some investigation before we promise we can make it happen.

 This is some part of my .emacs config file. When I start Emacs and input M-x sly or M-x slime, I usually would get an editor and a REPL. In the editor, I should have lispy-mode on automatically (if according to the config), however, I still need to M-x lispy-mode to get it to work. So I was wondering that where I did it wrong?
 ;; Emacs Lisp (add-hook 'emacs-lisp-mode-hook (lambda () (lispy-mode 1) (show-paren-mode 1))) ;; Common Lisp (add-hook 'lisp-mode-hook (lambda () (lispy-mode 1) (show-paren-mode 1)))

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Rather than having a control or special key based command for changing window sizes, or having to remember and use a lengthy Emacs function name (enlarge-window-horizontally) for example, I'd like to set up an evil statusline command like so
 (evil-ex-define-cmd "ewh" 'enlarge-window-horizontally) 
 so I can use :ewh instead. (There are also other ways to get the same effect, but I'm using this for now.)
 This works (which is good), but it only grows the window by one character width, so I'd like to be able to use "." to repeat it. However, this command does not appear in the ring for some reason, so whatever was used before :ewh is what ends up repeated.
 How can I use this alias/command I want while also having calls appear in the ring so they are eligible for repetition by "."?
 Unfortunately, prefacing the command with a number like :5ewh does enlarge the window by five characters, but it also moves me to line 5. This approach would also be okay if it didn't navigate to a new line.
 Thanks!

 I'm using emacs 27 in Fedora. I make my own dotfiles. Im using everything with Emacs including music player, and I use emacs as IDE for some programming languages. My question is that, I use lsp-java but I guess it is effective with just springboot projects. But Im using various frameworks. How can I configure my Emacs as Java IDE as well. And debugging part is important for me. I'm dealing problems for configuring spring debugger. I also listen your ideas.

What's the best way to do Vue-style components and applications, but using Purescript instead of Typescript?
 I'm using Jest + Stryker to do (property-based, mutation) testing. Should I use them with Purescript (how?) or switch to some other testing framework?
  
I'm quite comfortable with Haskell, and I have an existing Vue.js + Typescript application that I wrote (and host at https://iguanasuicide.net/) but I'm not really comfortable with npm / node / vue -- there's no specification I can read ala the Haskell Report so I'm always uncertain when editing the configuration. I'm even uncertain on the latest Typescript changes -- I learned it from the specification that is no longer updated.

 I'm on a mac, and testing this on a prebuilt Emacs 26 from homebrew, and emacs 28.0.60 I compiled. It seems that in my v28.0.60 if I open a tramp connection to a remote server that is behind a VPN, if the VPN connection is killed, emacs completely freezes. (to test, I just open a dired remote directory, and sever the connection. Instant beachballing.) I've tried setting tramp verbose mode to 10 and sending SIGUSR2, but am having trouble getting useful information (for me). Once the freezing happens, I can't recover and its becoming extremely frustrating. SIGUSR2 can at least let me get back into emacs, but in a debug mode. The only message I could see was about a premature ending and Forbiddent reentrant tramp. (I don't have the exact messages right now, but could get them.)
 I do have a copy of my v26 emacs, and it does not have the same problem. When the VPN/remote connection is killed, emacs locks up for a few seconds, before it simply times out, and I can keep going. Annoying, but not a show-stopper.
 In each case, I am starting with emacs -Q option and the only extra command I'm using before opening files is ido-mode.
 I did stumble on  this issue  which mentions that start-file-process-shell-command was changed between v26 and v28. Is what I am noticing something related to that?
 The behavior is very different between versions on the same computer (and ssh configuration), and I am loading things with the "-Q" option for no init file. Any pointers to how to track this down would be helpful. Did I compile without some magic flag in the configuration that was needed?

 type family Last ts :: * where Last '[t] = t Last (t ': ts) = Last ts 
 When using the type family as part of a program, I'm encountering an error as follows (summarised):
 Could not deduce: Last ts1 ~ Last (t : ts1) from the context: ts ~ (t : ts1) NB: `Last' is a non-injective type family 
 From my understanding, the last type in the list ts1 must be identical to the last type in the list t : ts1, the presence of an extra item at the beginning should not have an effect on which item is at the end. Therefore, Last ts1 should be the same as Last (t : ts1), but GHC cannot guarantee this.
 What changes can I make to get my code to compile?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I apologize for this question but I have been trying this for a while and getting a bit stuck.
 I have installed the Emacs Application Framework and been messing around with it. It's awesome, but I can't play video files in it! As far as I can tell, everything is set up as it should be but it simply is not playing anything.
 Here is the relevant portion of my .emacs file:
 (add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/site-lisp/emacs-application-framework/") (add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/site-lisp/emacs-application-framework/app/eaf-video-player/") (require 'eaf) (require 'eaf-browser) (require 'eaf-pdf-viewer) (require 'eaf-terminal) (require 'eaf-video-player) 
 As you can see, the video player is indeed installed. I also installed qt-ubuntu from snap and ffmpeg from apt (I am on Ubuntu) to see if either of those would help (they didn't but I haven't restarted my computer since I installed those so maybe that would do something [update: rebooting did not do anything]?)
 The web browser, PDF viewer, and terminal work just fine (I haven't messed with the other plugins yet). However, when I try to run the video player on a video file, this happens.
 As you can see, the video editor is in fact on, in some sense, but nothing is here! I am not a Linux or powerful text editor newbie (I am a recent veteran of Neovim which i customized heavily) so I know may way around installing stuff and troubleshooting, but I'm nowhere near experienced enough to debug super complicated issues, so I've found myself stuck here. Any ideas on what might be going on?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone,
 This might be a stupid or rather difficult question. When you are surfing on the web, and you come across a tutorial that you were looking for hours, and you consider that tutorial or parts of it a piece of gold to avoid boilerplate and save tons of hours of re-googling, how do you store that information using org-mode? 
 Technically speaking, we are talking about non-actionable information that could be used potentially in the future. Do you use org-roam for this kind of stuff or what? And how do you organize the files, independent from your GTD workflow (if you have)? 
 Would love to hear your methods, since I have a lot of tabs temporarily saved in bookmark on Firefox but I know that I would like to store that information filtered and processed by me. Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I just came across Ctrl-Shift-E.
 It's shy though:
  
it pops up a tiny window that disappears if I try to screenshot it (and comes right back after the screenshot is taken).
 
C-h k C-S-e doesn't even help!?
 
C-q C-S-e doesn't want to quoted-insert it.
 
Search engines have never heard of it apparently.
 
C-g doesn't extinguish it. enter and esc do.
 
For both global and local, (local-unset-key (kbd "C-S-E")) doesn't unset it.
 
 So how does it behave?
 It opens a tiny window, that you can type in, and if you hit enter it places those contents at the cursor. But you can't type spaces. The tiny window is draggable. The tiny window has a hardcoded character e at the beginning of it, for who knows why.
 What on earth is this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,I searched far and wide but, with my limited competency, I was unable to find a writing tracker for org-mode that could tell me how many words per hour I produce. I want to know this to become more prolific.
 Here's an example writing tracker implementation done in Google spreadsheets: https://thespreadsheetwiz.com/automatic-writing-tracker/
 I don't need something as elaborate. But there doesn't seem to be any solution that pairs word count with clock data.
 There are a few packages that will count words for you, such as org-wc, which produces nice overlays of total word count per subtree: https://github.com/tesujimath/org-wc
 Or tracktable that embeds a table with a daily word count into your buffer: https://github.com/tty-tourist/org-tracktable
 But nothing that combines word counts with clock data, both of which I have in my file.
 Unless I missed something? Please let me know if you know.
 I use DOOM if it makes any difference.

 `shift :: ((a -> r) -> Cont r r) -> Cont r a`
 We have `shift` and `reset` for performing continuation, but it is hard to wrap my head around what these does..
 Like, what does "captures the continuation up to the nearest enclosing reset" mean?
 Why does it capture up to the enclosing reset? How does it interact with callCC and others?
 I am lost. Could you give me pointers on how to understand it?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all!
 I've written a small "proof of concept" type package nrql.el for interacting with NewRelic (an application performance monitoring and logging tool). In my current job, I do a lot of investigation into our production issues. org-mode is a huge part of my daily workflow, and I wanted something that would make it easier to save NewRelic queries (and their results) in org-mode as I typically will export an org-mode heading to html to format the text in a way that is easy to share between many different services (Confluence/Jira/Github/ect.). 
 If there are any other NewRelic and Emacs users out there hopefully this is useful! Also, I'd love some feedback elisp wise as it's my first serious attempt at writing a package for Emacs. A lot is still pretty rudimentary like error handling, but if you have interest in something like this let me know as it currently meets my needs, and I'm wondering if I should take it further.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Starting with emacs -Q -l ~/.emacs.d/straight/repos/straight.el/bootstrap.el, I then eval-buffer this buffer:
 (straight-use-package 'org) (with-eval-after-load 'org-agenda (setq org-agenda-files '("~/todo.org")) (setf (cdr (assoc 'todo org-agenda-sorting-strategy)) '(effort-up)) ;; Sort just by effort (setf (cdr (assoc 'todo org-agenda-prefix-format)) " %i %-12:c %-6e")) ;; So I can see effort in the todo list 
 If I then do M-x org-agenda t, I'm presented with
 todo: 0:30 TODO C todo: 0:15 TODO B todo: 0:45 TODO A 
 However, if I comment out (straight-use-package 'org) (i.e. using the built-in Org instead of the latest version), I get the expected output of
 todo: 0:15 TODO B todo: 0:30 TODO C todo: 0:45 TODO A 
 org-version and load-history confirm that the first version is using Org 9.5, while the second is using Org 9.4.4. Did sorting agenda items by effort change in 9.5?
 For completeness, inbox.org just looks like:
 * TODO A :PROPERTIES: :Effort: 0:45 :END: * TODO B :PROPERTIES: :Effort: 0:15 :END: * TODO C :PROPERTIES: :Effort: 0:30 :END: 
 I'm on GNU Emacs 27.2, with Arch Linux, Linux 5.10.64-1-lts x86_54, and Org 9.5-g531577.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was doing a problem sheet to play around with haskell syntax and I have to write a function :
 graft :: Rose -> [ Rose ] -> (Rose , [ Rose ])
 graft = undefined
 which takes a "parent" tree and a list of "child" trees and grafts each of the children to the leaves of the parent as we move from left to right. What is the most efficient way to do this?
 Notice how the function returns two pieces of data: the grafted tree as well as a list. This second value can be used if the length of the list of children does not match the number of leaves of the parent. For example, if there are not enough child trees in the list, your function should simply continue without modifying the remaining leaves and and return the grafted tree as well as the empty list. Conversely, if there are more children than there are leaves of the parent, then your function should return the grafted tree as well as the list of child trees which are left over.

 As far as I can tell, the way to do this would be to supply the output of (region-beginning) and (region-end) to a function that would insert text at a point.
 Unfortunately, I can't find a function to do this, or even functions to manually set the point, and then use (insert) to place the text.
 Am I going about this in the way? I know it's a very simple task just to write the tags, but I have to do it a lot and would like to automate it.
 EDIT: I figured it out, the function is a little hacky, but it does work. Note: the mess in the (insert) functions is to make it output \( \), disregard it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is a post introducing the new changes of Iron v1.1.2.
 What is Iron ?
 Iron is a type constraints (or type refinement) library for Scala 3. It uses Dotty's inline and opaque types to evaluate constraints at compile-time.
 Here is a simple example: ```scala def log(x: Double > 0d): Refined[Double] = x.map(Math.log)
 log(-1d) //Compile-time error ```
 New features of 1.1.2
 Mathematics
 This release make Iron closer to mathematics by providing two features: - A new A / B alias which has the same meaning than x € A / B(x) in mathematics. The old A ==> B alias is kept but deprecated for retrocompatibility reasons.
  
A new algebraic system allowing the user to write their constraint like a mathematical equation: ```scala
  
def acos(x: Double / (-1d <= ?? <= 1d)): Refined[Double] = x.map(Math.acos) acos(1d) //Right(0) acos(1.5) //Error ```
 Check this page for further information.
 Compile-time evaluation support for composed constraints
 Before 1.1.2, constraints like And, Or, Not etc... Weren't evaluable at compile-time. They were evaluated at runtime only. This update now allows you evaluate complex/composed constraints at compile-time: scala def acos(x: Double / (Greater[-1d] && Less[1d])): Refined[Double] = x.map(Math.acos) acos(1.2) //Compile-time error 
 Note: Compile-time evaluation is also supported by the new algebra system.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have an exercise, where I have to write a function that returns True if the first parameter's list's length is larger than the second parameter (Int type).
 Now, there's a test case where the first parameter is an infinite list ([1..]), therefore I can't just simply write `| length x > y = True` in my pattern guard, since that would cause an infinite loop. How can I check if a list is infinite or not? If it's infinite, then the function should always return `True`.
 ​
 EDIT: The second parameter is only a number, so my example should look like this:
 longer [1..] 3000 == True

 I have looked up on google and found a similar problem in this google group. 
 Like if there is a {-# LANGUAGE ScopedTypeVariables #-} or a single line comment in the first line, this error will show up.
 Everything can build successfully so I think the problem is on VScode...
 Is there anybody encountered with the similar problem?

 ```scala case class Coordinate(azimuth: Double, elevation: Double)
 def method(arg: Seq[Byte]): Coordinate // represents a point on a globe ```
 I need the method to be approximately equal to the value corresponding to the catalog entry for the byte sequence that represents it. Basically, I need this test to pass:
 scala val testValue: Seq[Byte] = ??? assert(method(testValue))(approximatelyEquals(Coordinate(azi1, ele1))) //values from spec catalog correlating byte sequences to expected Coordinate values 
 The signature of approximatelyEquals is
 scala def approximatelyEquals[A: Numeric](reference: A, tolerance: A): Assertion[A] 
 I am unsure of how to make this work with the Coordinate class. I need an instance of Numeric for Coordinate, but it doesn't make much sense, since for example it's not possible to order points on a globe.
 Basically what I need is to make sure that the elevation and azimuth values are close to the azimuth and elevation values that are expected. As it relates to the title, I need to get an ADT to understand the typeclass of its arguments, if it has arguments that all have the same typeclass as this type does.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I don't know how well known or widely used they are, but I just wanted to say how blown away I am by the Modus Themes of Protesilaos Stavrou. Not only are they really beautiful but they're incredibly clear (by design) and very customizable. I've stuck with the built-in deeper-blue theme for a very long time because of its clarity but this is the first theme that's made me switch.

If so here is what I have to do
 Implement the function puzzle, it will simulate the game similar to 15 Puzzle. In our case, we have 25 squares, where 24 squares are ocupied by tiles with big case letters from 'A' to 'X'. One tile is free, it is denotated by ' '. In one move, you can move a tile (denotated by its letter) into the free one. The function gets the original configuration and a sequence of valid moves. It will output the resulting configuration.
 If anyone would help me I would really appretiate it, though I am quite broke so I can't afford paying, I am rellying on generosity and charity of this community

 With the advent of Emacs 28's native compilation, it's only possible when we apply the highest available native-comp-speed (which is non-default) so it's unreliable.
 Today I happened to jump into named-let in subr-x.el, which according to the manual can be used just like Clojure's loop - which can be utilized in place of TCO funtions - therefore I decided to define a clone for the latter.
 lisp ;;;###autoload (defmacro clj-loop (bindings &rest body) "Evaluates BODY in a lexical context in which the symbols in the BINDING-forms are bound to their respective initial bindings or parts therein. Acts as a recur target." (declare (indent defun)) `(named-let recur ,(seq-partition ;; Convert vector to list (append bindings nil) 2) ,@body)) 
 ```lisp
 (clj-loop [i 0] (if (= i (expt 2 20)) i (recur (1+ i)))) ;; => 1048576
 (defun fibo-2expt (num) (clj-loop [a 0 b 1 n (expt num 2)] (if (zerop n) a (recur b (+ a b) (1- n))))) (fibo-2expt 3) ;; => 34 `` Although initial expressions' indentations are a bit funny & there's no destructuring, I think it's still helpful to share, because I haven't seen anyone suggestednamed-let` as a built-in workaround for TCO. (Sorry for shamelessly ripping off documentation from Clojure's).

 ​
 How do I add I implement Foo.equals(Foo) for Foo / for every extending class? (So Bar.equals(Foo), Baz.equals(Foo) would need to be implemented.)
 Ideally Bar(x1) == Bar(x2) <= x1 == x2, Baz(y1) == Baz(y2) <= y1 == y2.
 Does it need to be a sealed abstract class rather than a sealed trait?Foo must be sealed because I need to use pattern matching.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 ​
 I found this interpreter for the lambda calculus using de Bruijn Notation and GADTS:
 https://proglang.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/teaching/functional-programming/2013/Code-20140123.lhs
 data FExp :: * -> * -> * where 
 App :: FExp e (a -> b) -> FExp e a -> FExp e b 
 Lam :: FExp (a, e) b -> FExp e (a -> b) 
 Var :: Nat e a -> FExp e a > 
 ​
 data Nat e a where 
 Zero :: Nat (a, b) a 
 Succ :: Nat e a -> Nat (b, e) a
 ​
 My Questions is: Whats the best way to parse expressions like \x y z -> y to something of this type? 
 My problem is that i need a state to return the right Nat e a.
 Would it be better to write an Type FExp' that can also contain lambda expressions that are not well typed and write a parser with type String -> FExp' and a second function of type MonadError m => FExp' -> m FExp'? Thanks for your help.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi guys, I'm sharing a minimal recipe to build emacs with native compilation in macOS. More precisely, to add native compilation to your already working build procedure. I've found that it's extremely simple nowadays but also that instructions are scattered around the web, often outdated, sometimes hit-and-miss, sometimes buried deep inside complex build scripts that do a bunch of other things. So I wanted to get an up-to-date minimal working recipe and actually understand what I was doing instead of blindly copy&pasting code. The outcome gladly surprised me as trivial.
 Assuming you have brew installed and have checked out emacs-28:
  brew install gcc brew install libgccjit ... ./configure --with-native-compilation ... 
 Remarks:
  
gcc is not the compiler used during the traditional build. Instead, the clang installed alongside your macOS command line tools will be picked as usual. But gcc will be the one compiling elisp to native code (please correct me here if I'm wrong).
 
--with-native-compilation flag is not required (it's already the default!) but by adding it you ensure that any issue while enabling native compilation gets reported loud and clear. If there is any problem, try this in order to diagnose it: https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/jit/intro/tutorial01.html.
 
Be prepared for long build times. Also, you might feel disappointed the first time you launch your new build of emacs. But this is likely because the JIT compiler is compiling your packages (you may see a bunch of compiler warnings in *Messages*, new files appearing in ~/.emacs.d/eln-cache and some processes burning your CPUs).
 
I'm on Big Sur 11.6.
 
 EDIT: I've been using it for a while it's really, but really, snappy! Now that I'm typing in this reddit textarea it feels clunky as in 2 hours average latency.

 Emacs IDLWAVE mode version 6.1_em22. HTML help location not found: try setting ‘idlwave-system-directory’ and/or ‘idlwave-html-help-location’ Cannot locate IDL Assistant, enabling default browser. Loading system routine info in idle time... Failed to convert XML routine info, falling back on idlw-rinfo. [...] 
 Whaat? All I did was add ob-prolog, set a var for the program name, and put a #+SRC block in an Org file. Well, almost all.
 After getting schooled on Interactive Data Language and Emacs' IDLWAVE package (it has an info manual), and an hour of my life I'll never get back, I tracked down the issue. I had created a prolog code file, likes.pro, and guess what file extension IDL files have. I had a likes.pro buffer and IDLWAVE liked it. 
 Fun fact: one of the authors of this package is Carsten Dominik.

Kind of miss just being able to put console.log(), console. error() where it's needed and not worry about logging in the first place.

 As a person who wholeheartedly dislikes microsoft office, I decided to work with org mode presentation. I tried out the default themes from reveal.js and I noticed they are minimalist (which is very pleasing but I was wondering-
 Data Science people I know uses microsoft office regularly and makes extensive graphical presentations. So will a minimalist presentation be bad for such environment?
 Which matters during a presentation (optional: in DS)? 
 Main Question: From your experience (optional: as a data analyst), which theme/configuration do you use to do regular presentations?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone. I recently started learning Scala, I know very less about it until now. I setup Visual Studio code for Scala, installed an extension called 'metals'. I also installed scala and sbt on my OS. I already have jdk-openjdk (which is version 17 currently) installed.
 I researched a little bit and found scala 2.13.6 supports jdk 17. Still everytime I open a Scala file on VS Code, it asks me to install jdk 8 or 11 specifically. The twist is I can compile and run my programs on both on my distro's terminal emulator as well on vscode terminal emulator.
 I just want some additional knowledge based on above issue happened with me and what if I completely uninstall jdk-openjdk and install jdk11-openjdk?
 would I be able to compile and run both Java and Scala programs piecefully (errors aside Lol).
 Thanks for your time and efforts.

 For about 20 years the program used a built in IDE+debugger called "VLIDE" (Visual Lisp IDE). This program does what it's supposed to do but is terrible.
 They have now deprecated this and urge people to use VSCode, which has some sort of LSP support via an Extension
 Supposedly this does all the cool stuff I need in VSCode. I would much rather use Emacs!
 What is involved in making this work with the best editor? Is it a drop-in replacement of some sort? Is it legal?
 I don't really know how remote debugging works, even though I used it in my Java/EE days.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm experimenting with using a clean build from straight.el in order to reproduce a bug I'm chasing down, but got sidetracked in this endeavor by experiencing some other weird behavior (a familiar story to all the members of the Church, I'm sure).
 I launch Emacs with emacs -Q -l ~/.emacs.d/straight/repos/straight.el/bootstrap.el, then evaluate the following buffer.
 (straight-use-package 'org) (require 'org) (with-eval-after-load 'org-agenda (setq org-agenda-files '("~/todo.org"))) 
 After this, I do M-x org-agenda t, move the cursor over an entry, and do C-c C-x e to assign an effort. If I then do e.g. "0:15 RET" though, I get a "Symbol's function definition is void: org-duration-to-minutes" error. Weirdly, this error goes away if I remove the line (require 'org) from the above config.
 I've checked, and the straight.el build files for org do have org-duration-to-minutes listed as an autoload in org-loaddefs.el. I feel like my brain is just mush after the work week. What am I missing?
 edit:
 I'm on GNU Emacs 27.2, with Arch Linux, Linux 5.10.64-1-lts x86_54, and the latest version of Org, 9.5-g531577.
 Doing M-x list-load-path-shadows yields the same results for both of these cases - after running org-agenda, 114 packages are shadowed (everything from the built-in org is shadowed by everything in straight/repos/org).
 The load history is a lot to parse through, but the only important thing I've found so far is that after I call org-agenda, org-loaddefs.el appears in the load-history of the version without a require statement, but not in the version with a require statement.
 edit2: Solved! See my comment below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m trying to use backpack to do some limited form of polymorphic unpacking (which GHC unfortunately does not support ‘natively’). Essentially, I want something like:
 data Node a b = Leaf {-# UNPACK #-} !b | Node {-# UNPACK #-} !Index {-# UNPACK #-} !a {-# UNPACK #-} !Index type Index = Int bimapNode :: (a -> c) -> (b -> d) -> Node a b -> Node c d bimapNode f g = \case Leaf b -> Leaf (g b) Node l a r -> Node l (f a) r 
 for particular types a, c, b, and d. The issue that I'm essentially running into is that I'm not sure how I can get my hands on the copies/instances of the 'Node' type used by the library that implements 'bimapNode'. A more detailed/precise description of the problem, a minimum "working" example, and my attempts so far are at https://github.com/noinia/nodedemo . (it's a bit unweildy to describe the problem while flattening everything in one textual question; hence the ref. to a git repo that contains the proper file layout). Does ideas on how to proceed with this kind of thing?

I know the Zettelkasten method for two years now. I tried to use it, but I always have a problem with mathematical equations.

The former configures the active frame/window, the latter the inactive.
 '(mode-line-mousable ((t (:foreground "cyan" :background "#007080"))))
 I find no documentation on them. 'Look up symbol in Info' fails. 'apropos' fails. Everywhere I searched, fail. 
 Obviously, they work. Every theme I examined that configures the modeline uses them to set the mouse behavior. But from where?
 edit Or, maybe, I've missed the boat and make-mode-line-mouse-map is the key. But what does it have to do with themes?

 At the moment I've bodged together a mix of functions to try to get this behaviour, and generally works, but not always (for instance when use org-refile to jump to a subheading in another file (which I do constantly)).
 I'm wondering if there might be a simpler way to achieve this behaviour? (Not a programmer, really struggle with this stuff). 
 Thanks in advance for all help, but: please don't just tell me I shouldn't be using tabs in the first place. I know many look down on tabs, and I have tried using buffers only for 2 years, and I hate it. I need some on-screen visual representation of the buffers I have open.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Since I wrote about a year ago that I am working on https://simplex.chat project, a small Haskell reddit group was exceptionally supportive - thank you all!
 I've spent a few weeks exploring which platform we should use to build our mobile apps - and Flutter/Dart with its unified compiled UI and a decent cross-platform seemed a strong contender. But having implemented the core transport protocol in dart, I do have some doubts...
 Having come through all the options, I've read that people use Swift across all platforms (iOS/Android/Mac/Windows) for applications logic, as Swift is an LLVM compiler, so it produces very fast binaries that run on Android without JVM.
 So, I am now thinking, wait a second - Haskell GHC is also an LLVM compiler. A short google search shows that people do compile Haskell code to both iOS and Android. And we already have most of the protocol logic implemented in Haskell - people use our SimpleX chat via terminal...
 While this all seems doable, the compiler configuration and low level bindings are a bit over my head - I am an application developer, so lots to learn here. Would anybody here who has the experience with Haskell on iOS / Android be interested to join the project (terms TBD) to at least help us set it all up, if not get involved longer term?

 I have a series of TODO tasks, and I want to set them to "DONE" in the order I do them. org-enforce-todo-dependencies is set to "t".
 I set the "ORDERED" property like this for a few lists: :PROPERTIES:
 :ORDERED: t :END: 
 This looks inelegant to me. 
 The manual gives this example for single line properties:
 #+PROPERTY: NDisks_ALL 1 2 3 4
 Can I do something like this:
 #+PROPERTY: ORDERED t
 I have tried it for a few lists of tasks, but I cannot get it to work. I don't know if that is because I am doing it wrong, or if it's not possible.
 Edit: the single lines for "PROPERTY" are supposed to start with a pound sign and a plus, but Reddit markup wants to display them as headers; I added a space and another pound sign. 
 The single line syntax is here

 Here's the problem:
 1) I'm running windows native build.
 2) I'd like it to run every hour without needing emacs to be open.
 Those two problems together put it way out of my knowledge area. I could probably figure out how to pipe the command to a text file, and I know I'll want to use Task Scheduler to do the update timing, but how do you tell emacs to spit out that much data without opening it? It seems like it's going to be difficult.

 What exactly "certain folders" means I am not so sure about myself unfortunately. I can give a couple examples:
  
Standard Windows folders (e.g. "Program Files")
 Folders managed by the App "Sync" (syncs local files with cloud storage)
 The Goolge Drive App, which does basically the same, does NOT give me this issue UNLESS I share the folder in question with other users
 My work-pc is managed using Windows Intune, on this device a cannot save a file anywhere using emacs
  
I really hope someone has an idea, I am completely lost here. Thanks in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I love Scala. It's the kind of love that every time I try to explore some new language, Scala comes in the way whispering "this language lacks this and that".
 I've tried Rust, Go, Kotlin, Clojure, and more. None of them is as awesome as Scala... And I'm good, really good actually.
 (Yet... What's with Travis Brown? Holy fuck, is this guy's purpose in life is to slowly suffocating the community?)
 Besides that... At some point it felt like it was evolving crazy fast. There was a new shiny amazing library to explore every month... And now there's just promises in the air and Scala 3 hasn't really taken off, and seems like it just won't.
 There's also the job offers. From what I've seen, only some companies in Europe are hiring (mainly in the Netherlands), and the positions they offer are that of a Senior Scala Engineer with no possibility of growing.
 Also, the speed in which the Scala ecosystem grew in the previous years left every company using Scala, having a mix of styles in their software. Some using Play, and then Akka, and then Http4s (with tagless final) and then ZIO and modern functional effects libraries.
 I feel like I fell in a pit of overspecialization and now I can't leave.

 But will scala-native be able to run without a mandatory GC since scala-library itself does not allocate and deallocate memory manually?
 If a GC is required then does that mean that the problem of "having a mandatory GC" & "GC pauses" (similar to JVM) also exists in scala-native unless there is a version of scala-library written in scala-native?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As of recent, I have been getting this error:
 byte-code: Symbol’s function definition is void: org-file-name-concat 
 whenever I called org-roam's (org-roam-node-find) function.
 I was getting this error on a Linux machine (Arch) and on an Mac machine, both running Emacs 27.2. I tried installing v. 28, but the problem persisted.
 I then noticed that, if I loaded and evaluated the file org-compat.el (in org-mode's lisp directory), the problem didn't occur. The function referred to in the error message (org-file-name-concat) is defined in that file, and is conditional upon a specific version of Emacs.
 I discovered that the problem was caused by an incompatibility of sorts between the (old) version of org-mode installed with Emacs on my machines, and the (newest) version of org-roam installed by straight.
 Apparently, Emacs loads the old, default version of org-mode rather than the newer one installed later by straight (something which other users have noticed before).
 My fix consisted in deleting the old version from my machines.
 On Linux, I deleted the org directory on /usr/share/emacs/27.2/lisp/
 and on Mac, on /usr/local/Cellar/emacs-plus@27/27.2/share/emacs/27.2/lisp/
 I wanted to shared this information with other users who might be experiencing similar issues.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've written a transient.el menu with enough columns of shortcuts that the text starts to wrap at the right part of the screen when viewing on a smaller laptop display. Is there a best practice to modify the size of a transient's window? Ideally I'd like to remove the wrapping continuation lines of the transient's buffer, as the wrapping disrupts the layout of all the text. I'd also like to limit the transient window's height, though I've been playing around with transient-display-buffer-action without luck. If I could limit the window height and width, I'm guessing transient-scroll-up and transient-scroll-down would allow me to see whatever parts of the transient buffer are hidden by making the window smaller...
 The only working solution I've found is to use the predicate keywords (e.g., :if, :if-nil) to change up my transient's column arrangement depending on which computer I'm on, for example:
 (transient-define-prefix my-transient () ["MISC" [:if (lambda () (string= system-name "MY-LAPTOP")) ("R" "Avy Char in Line" avy-goto-char-in-line) ("P" "Pop Mark" avy-pop-mark) ("DEL" "Other Buffer" other-window)] ] ["Help" [:if (lambda () (string= system-name "MY-LAPTOP")) ("SPC" "Avy char" avy-goto-char)] ]) 
 But I would prefer the solutions in the first paragraph if possible. Thanks for any help!

II: GHC’s constraint solver
III: Writing a type-checking plugin
In this first blog post of the series, I’ll be outlining a few
examples that showcase some limitations in GHC’s instance resolution
and type family reduction mechanisms. With a type-checker plugin, we
are no longer restricted by these limitations, and can decide ourselves
how to solve constraints and reduce type families.

Instance resolution
Recall how GHC goes about instance resolution, as per the user’s guide.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I started doing Project Euler problems a while back using Haskell exclusively, and so far the language has worked pretty well. In particular, the language facilitates writing code using reusable components (e.g. a lazy list of primes, a function to check whether a number is a palindrome), and also benefits from utility libraries (e.g. Control.Monad, Control.Arrow, Data.List, Data.List.Ordered) and from a few other conveniences (Integer type, ^ operator). 
 Those of you who have done Project Euler with Haskell and some other language(s):
 What other languages did you use?
 How did Haskell compare to the other languages that you used?
 Do you agree with my assessment of Haskell's strengths?
 Btw please refrain from sharing solutions to problems

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am pleased to announce that I have released Git-Modes on NonGNU Elpa as well as on Melpa. Git-Modes provides three simple major modes for editing Git configuration files.
 Previously these modes were available from Melpa as three separate packages named gitattributes-mode, gitconfig-mode and gitignore-mode. These packages have been removed and you should remove them locally too and then install git-modes, but make sure that it is already available before you do. That can take a few hours.
 The motivation for merging the packages into just one is that while many users may only regularly edit .git/config and maybe .gitignore, it is not such a bad thing if a major mode is ready to go when they first open .gitattributes.
 More in the announcement.

What is the difference between zetteldeft and deft - in description of feauters?


What is the difference between org-mode and org-roam?


Do I understand it correct that org-roam use sqllite database instead of plain text files? In that case it would be disqualified for ZK.

 I am using pdf-tools and when I call the outline buffer, it open in a vertical split. Is there any way to make it open with say, a fixed width instead? I have looked around for this in other people's configs and can't seem to find anything. Thanks!

 Recently, I learned about the starship prompt and i quite liked it. Since I use the eshell a lot i would like to know if there is a way to use the starship prompt with eshell. 
 I have already read about the Eshell on emacs wiki and the Starship guide but since I have zero idea about the lisp language i wasn't able to figure something out.

 I haven't written any decent elisp code for ~3 years now and admittedly I have forgotten the little elisp knowledge I used to have. Upgrading doom-emacs has been a challenge for me as it'd be difficult to deal with possible breakage. (Also, sorry to admit that but I have also shifted some editor usage to neovim.) I am not able to properly maintain https://github.com/MaskRay/emacs-ccls anymore. There has been a few client-side issues I would probably never know how to address.
 Would it be a good idea to merge emacs-ccls into lsp-mode and take advantage of the large community? :) Apologies that I probably am not able to help much on the migration...
 If you are interested, please let me know. If you use emacs-ccls, please show your interest, it may help someone to get decided:)
 Feel free to rename functions or variables. I still know how to adapt my key bindings:)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Errata: This is a repost with a different title of a post I just deleted, since the old title "Is Haskell a better Python?" created substantial confusion, and Reddit does not allow the changing of post titles. The original post-thread can be found here: https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/qbvfsh/beginning_programmer_here_is_haskell_a_better/
 ​
 I'm just a noob with a copy of "Haskell From The Very Beginning", but I'd like to ask:
 ​
 Is Haskell a better Python? As in, Python is a deliberate attempt to make a very accessible programming language, but guess what? The textbook I just bought has 127 functional pages (albeit extremely concise ones).
 ​
 I'm wondering if Haskell might be a better Python for people beginning to code; i.e, people complain about Monads this,
 https://preview.redd.it/kqvdmwedanu71.png?width=892&format=png&auto=webp&s=4165714f28e616ac30685a8095ca34fcb68427c1
 that, but a lot of it comes down to people starting with imperative paradigms.
 ​
 The benefits, likewise, are substantial. Haskell, in comparison in other programming languages, is very hard to make bad code in (because it simply won't compile). For non-programmers coming into programming, Haskell is a way to learn to code but also to produce a relatively high-quality of code, whereas Python etc might be easier to learn, but it's far easier to produce spaghetti code in other languages. Moreover, selling Haskell as "a better Python" to non-programmers also helps enlarge the Haskell community, leading to better library, compiler, and other forms of support, while making it so that many future programmers start from a functional paradigm instead of an imperative paradigm.
 ​
 Edit: I did contact Haskell Foundation about this subject, but I'd like to message them permission to post e-mail contents first, and I'd rather finish a few Haskell textbooks beforehand so I don't feel like a poser before I do so.

 It runs another buffer zone with other hidden buffer, and it looks so clutter and unromantic.
 ​
 Is there any way to use zone on the top of that code rather than opening to saperate buffer like in image 2, (with like that showing other tabs, than the tabs i'm running. I just want to on top of my code.

 I have seen that there are packages that allow you to generate (say) desktop-notifications for scheduled todo-items and the like, but what is a bit unclear about these solutions is how to make sure that Emacs is in fact running when a notification is supposed to be generated?
 Do you have Emacs always running in server-mode or do you start Emacs in batch mode every now and then via a con-job or how is this done in practice?
 Many thanks.

 I've been looking for a way to neaten up my org mode documents and keep coming across org-hide-emphasis-markers, which when set is supposed to hide various emphasis markers in org mode. But I can't find it, e.g. when typing M-x. I'm on running Doom Emacs, Emacs 27.2. Is this option deprecated???
 Many thanks!

Everything works as expected (like in a normal Linux installation) except some key bindings are non responsive. The most annoying one is the M-d (I use it for forward-kill-char/word). I suspect that this key is set to something in the windows and stopping emacs from accessing it. Any idea what it can be. I have searched a lot but not able to find the solution yet.

 From the NEWS file for v27.1
 *** 'byte-compile-dynamic' is now obsolete. This is because on the one hand it suffers from misbehavior in corner cases that have plagued it for years, and on the other hand experience indicates that it doesn't bring any measurable benefit. 
 Wut? There's no upside to being lazy? Dang it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I lately grokked that Haskell just reveals the very nature of imperative program, or sequential code, that a thread of execution (by machine, as well as reasoning by human), is essentially single item (thus monadic) data dependencies chained together.
 IO has a phantom (yet magical) RealWorld item in the chain (though only at type level, not present at value level), you can imagine every IO step receives a new version of the RealWorld from the previous step. While ST has an even more general abstraction of it.
 Human brains seem to take single threaded reasoning for granted, so procedural code would appear more "natural" to humans. But data dependency is inherently "multi-threaded", thus how referential transparency is more "natural" to the physical nature.
 We human perceive a single RealWorld despite multiple versions of it along the temporal axis. But thinking the data dependency way, no such single RealWorld actually exists at all, just as in Haskell (at value level).
 Then we have real difficulties in reasoning about effects (mutation done to the "world") applied, if not sequentially organized. How "unnatural" we human are. Anyhow, imperative programs reflect this bug/feature of our cognitive workings, including monadic Haskell.

 (lsp-register-client (make-lsp-client :new-connection (lsp-tramp-connection "pyright") :major-modes '(python-mode) :remote? t :server-id 'pyright-remote)) 
 is loaded in my emacs. 
 When a opening file on the remote, lsp-log shows "Command "pyright" is not present on the path.". 
 If I run which pyright in a terminal outside of emacs, that is ssh'd into the remote, it returns the path for pyright: /snap/bin/pyright However, running the same from eshell returns "no pyright in <path on my local machine>. So emacs seems to be searching for pyright on my machine, when it should be searching on the remote? I tried to add (add-to-list 'tramp-remote-path "/snap/bin/") based on https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/tramp/Remote-programs.html , but same result.
 How do I make Tramp find pyright on the remote machine?

Absolutely no judgment from my end. I'm genuinely curious who you approach your workflow, as I see a lot of diehard fans of the title-free approach, and just wondering how you navigate with it.

  Since changing properties counts as modifying the buffer, it is not possible to remove a ‘read-only’ property unless you know the special trick: bind ‘inhibit-read-only’ to a non-‘nil’ value and then remove the property.

 def formula(angle: Double) = Math.pow(2, 16) * angle / 360 // and then convert to byte array 
 Some examples:
  
30 degrees maps to 1555 (or Array(15, 55))
 -30 maps to AAEA (or Array(234, 170))
  
I can get it working fine for the first case:
 val transformedAngle = BigInt(Math.pow(2, 16) * angle / 360).toByteArray 
 That yields the expected result of Array(15, 55), but putting in 330 (complement of -30) yields Array(0, -22. -86) instead of Array(234, 170) which is not what I want at all. How do I fix this?
 ​
 EDIT: I ended up doing this super manually, using the knowledge that the result of the formula must be fit in two bytes (as it is 2^16 times a number less than or equal to 1). I set
 val second = formula(angle) % 256 val first = (formula(angle) - second) / 256 Array(first, second) 
 IDK why this had to be so manual, but it works.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[edit: reposted with more clarity
 Org-refile offers the option to refile either to the top level of a file, or underneath a heading in that file - is there an equivalent for this with linking? I'm looking to write a function that will return a hierarchical list of all open Org files as well as the headings inside of them, and allow me to insert a link to any one of them, without having to leave the current buffer to store a link, or enter the heading manually.
 You can kind of patch this together using counsel-org-goto-all, which provides an alist of all headings from all open Org files, with entries (HEADER . MARKER). Just write your own Ivy action that uses (concat "file:" (marker-buffer (cdr x)) "::*" (car x)) in order to build the destination of the link and pass it to org-insert-link, then call that action on a goto-all candidate.
 However, this feels pretty bootleg, and doesn't work when linking to files. I tried concatenating the results of calling counsel-outline-candidates and counsel-buffer-or-recentf-candidates, but this doesn't give a nice hierarchical structure, and you have to start doing a bunch of ugly conditional stuff to tell if you're dealing with a file or a heading inside the action. Is there a simple facility that Org or Ivy/Counsel provides in order to return a candidate list of open Org files and the headings in them, like Org-refile provides?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I generally don't use the mouse 'at all' in Emacs, and find that some buffers showing a highlight where the mouse pointer is to be very distracting. (Maybe a theme problem of coloration?)
 ex: In Selectrum/marginalia/orderless if I hit find-file and start typing something, and the filter list is say 10 items long.. if the mouse _happens_ to be in the bottom couple inches of screen, well, Selectrum will show a full width highlight on the row the mouse is on; which can mean that as you're typing, you're seeing two highglight lines - the one that is targetted by seledtrum if you hit (say) return, and the one the mouse is over. Its annoying since they colour the same (maybe fixable in theme, I'll check.) 
 Likewise, in buffer+ buffer listing, the mouse will highlight a row, as will the one I'm looking at with the keyboard.
 Changing themes (if a buffer supports a face for mouse at all) all over the place could be error prine and annoying.
 What I think I'm proposing is .. define (say) a minor mode that causes the mouse pointer to be ignored, hidden, or even blocked (don't let the mouse enter the confines of the window the mode is applied to?) ... then I could add some hooks on say prog-mode to add this minor mode (as well as minibuffer, say). It woudl be easy to selectably add this minor mode, thus leaving everythign else to work as normally.
 *shrug*
 Any ideas?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I love these global minor modes like Helm, Ivy, Selectrum, or Vertico, which all display a list of completions in the minibuffer that filters and updates the display with every key press. But their user interfaces are always operated only from within the minibuffer.
 Are there any Emacs Lisp packages like these which could display almost exactly what you would see in the minibuffer, but in an actual buffer as a major mode instead, along the lines of ibuffer but for listing arbitrary strings and not just listing buffers?
 I would like a tool that works in Emacs sort of like how you would use "dmenu" to make a menu from text taken from STDIN. But for my use case, I would like to take an arbitrary newline-separated list of strings and make an interactive menu out of it in a separate Emacs buffer. Also it would be nice to have the ability to re-order list elements, the ability to mark elements (like you would do with files in Dired), and the ability to copy the list of marked items to the kill ring or else insert the list of items as a string into some other buffer, the same way that pressing "Enter" in Dmenu will dump the selected items to STDOUT.
 So for example, I would maybe select a region of my text buffer, press my key chord to turn that text it into a menu buffer in a new window, filter/rearrange/select elements, then press Enter and replace the region from whence it came.
 Does anyone know of a major mode like this, or a way of configuring something like Vertico to work in the way I described? Or alternatively, is it possible to use something like ibuffer or list-buffers for displaying arbitrary lists of strings rather than just buffers?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Coming from Java world perhaps i'm not fully achieved yet the Scala mindset of solving some problems. I'm interested in building an Scala 3 extensible app, whose behavior could be extended, customized via plugins. Bonus points if those plugins could be loaded/unloaded on runtime and their clients be notified accordingly.
 Possible solutions I've thinking about so far:
  
Overriding DefaultPluginManager from https://pf4j.org/ so the class can be aware of sbt generated classes (may not work with bloop/metals generated random name directories). But have trouble with Akka classloader, so I 'm not sure if it'll ever would work.
 Use https://github.com/moditect/layrry which is based on Java Modules. Not tried yet. Sbt does not recognize module-info.java which is essential for it to work. Possible solution is implement an Sbt Plugin. But, I don't know if at the end this would work in development mode which is important.
 Mess with an OSGI runtime and spend 3 months figuring out how to make it work with Scala ecosystem.
 Implement the application around https://github.com/softwaremill/macwire and hope the wiredInModule feature (which support dynamic loading) would be ported to Scala 3 soon.
 Building a sort of dynamic bundler that compiles the application along with extensions using Scala 3's given/implicits feature. (although technically that would not be a plug-gable architecture)
 distage-extension-plugins looks very promising but it's no ported to Scala 3 yet.
 Using a DI framework like Airframe, but it doesn't support dynamic loading.
 Using Guice? :-(
  
Is there any more Scala principled way of achieving that? or another paradigm that helps building a dynamic app ecosystem through plugins/extensions in Scala? or another long-term software management strategy or architecture that could work?
 PD: The reason I really really need Scala 3 is because I want to make it around new ADT implementation and use type-class derivation from them.
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We've been looking to hire Scala developers, and we give a simple coding problem that I expected candidates to typically solve with a one-liner with a filter and a sum, but instead most all are preferring a 5-line solution with foldLeft.
 Should I take that as a sign of inexperience with the language? Are there shops that prefer foldLeft as a matter of style? Or is this one of those weird situations where the interview distorts things because candidates assume interviewers don't want you to use "built in" functions? Are other companies demanding the use of foldLeft in interviews? Thanks for any insight that will help me judge fairly.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[OS: Arch linux with 5.14.11 kernel.
 I compiled emacs (using the AUR package) which is currently at version 29 but I installed and compiled it when it was still version 28. 
 emacs --version GNU Emacs 28.0.50 
 In my config I have the following snippet:
 (advice-add 'ido-find-file :after #'bhr/find-file-sudo) (defun bhr/find-file-sudo () "Find file as root if necessary." (unless (and buffer-file-name (file-writable-p buffer-file-name)) (find-alternate-file (concat "/sudo::" buffer-file-name)))) 
 When I visit a system owned file like /etc/pacman.conf 
 Previously I would be prompted for a password and after I entered it the file would be opened ion a buffer read/write. 
 It seems tramp behaviour has changed though. For quite a while now I see: 
 Autosave file on local temporary directory, do you want to continue? (y or n) 
 Typing y opens the file in as buffer read/write but without prompting for a password. 
 Typing n after the Autosave prompt leads to a weird situation
 I see a message - Unsafe autosave file name
 (Buffer is opened read-only)
 New tramp buffer appears with name "*tramp/sudo root@<host>" and the following contents:
 /root 
 Try to visit again and there's no prmopt and the buffer is opened read-only again. 
 Kill the tramp buffer. 
 I'm not sure why tramp behaviour changed but:
  
 How on earth does tramp open a file owned by root using sudo without prompting for a password? 
 Is it possible to have tramp prompt me for a password again the way it used to work.

Actually I was firstly going to learn scala 3 but I found that the documentation is in development and I currently might not be able to purchase a udemy/udacity/coursera/any other course, so hoping for financially free resources to help me learn. Hope you guys could relate. I want to ask, is scala 2 documentation enough to learn and clarify concepts of scala. I know a few other resources too such as, a geeksforgeeks tutorial, coursera's courses, devdocs.io, and a few other websites. I am learning C (mainly) [ik slow pace] since march I guess and python 3 also. I have basic knowledge of some data structures too. So, if I follow above resources and practice coding on my pc, would it be enough. Have any advice, sure. I'm happy for that. idk what else to say, so. [Edit: I think I am also comfortable at command line, I use GNU/Linux OS as my daily driver.] Thank you for giving me your precious time and help.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Q: Is there a Gmail Labs or some sort of add-on that would give each email a unique identifier similar to the one that The Archive creates?
I use Alfred to create a timestamp for YYYY.mmdd.hhmm for everything on my hard drive and in Google Drive... It makes finding and drilling down things so much easier.
One can just type in 202109301009 and boom pdf or spreadsheet shows up in finder....it's like having an ISBN number for files. [I tend to use the format with periods.. e.g.  2021.0930.1009 since my brain reads this easier, and I can just type 2021.09 and find all files created in september of 2021]
If Gmail could do something like this automatic like The Archive, it would be so much better. 
Many Thanks,]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tonight, I ran package-autoremove after deleting some packages manually - and every package it removed was a package in use. I mean, it removed use-package, for cryin' out loud. Along with bind-key and some treemacs auxiliary packages. This actually isn't the first time this behavior has occurred, so I was watching for it. 
 I mean obviously, don't use package-autoremove anymore. But wow. What is the method it used to determine that use-package was no longer need?

 data Poly a = Poly [a] 
 and also a class:
 class Polynom p where substitute :: p a -> a -> a compose :: p a -> p a -> p a 
 I can make the datatype an instance of the class:
 instance Polynom Poly where substitute = ... compose = ... 
 I also want a Ratio of a Poly to be an instance of the same class; I have tried many syntaxes and language extensions, but none of them work; things like:
 instance Polynom (Ratio . Poly) where ... -- error: cannot use (.) there instance Poly p => Polynom (Ratio (p _)) where ... -- error: no wildcards allowed type X a = Ratio (Poly x) instance Polynom X where ... -- error: X needs another param instance Polynom (* -> Ratio (Poly *)) where ... -- error: wrong kind 
 My goal is to be able to have substitute and compose work on a Ratio (Poly *); for example:
 rf = Poly [1,2,3] % Poly [4,5,6] :: Ratio (Poly Int) result = substitute rf 10 :: Int 
 Is this even possible in Haskell? If so, what syntax or language extension am I missing here?

 Basically I want to support an API for querying data from a table with a filter. Squeryl has this lovely thing called a LogicalBoolean which from my understanding is used to deal with some nubby equality issues. 
 I would like “most people” to not have to “know about” logicalBooleans. Instead I would like to accept a function of the form
 (OrderObject => Boolean) And then underneath the hood I transform this to an (OrderObject => LogicalBoolean) and pass that along to Squeryl.
 Is this something that can easily be done? I assume it mustn’t be otherwise it would just be in the Squeryl framework itself

 I'm trying to implement data schema validation through static type checking as explained in the following video between 5:23-8:46: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfaBeT0pRe0&t=323s
 The idea is that data schema is validated at runtime and the validations are represented as static types that can constrain the operations that can be performed on a given variable after it was validated.
 For example, let's take a machine learning dataset with tables, and a table named "emails" which has many fields, amongst these are: "personid", and "email". A query result can be checked whether the returned data matches a set of validators, and then the returned variable will have these verifications expressed as its static type.
 For example:
 data EmailsTableColumns = PersonId | EMail class Col a in…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I don't trust my hardware from my previous experience of losing files during tweaking around. So I decided to back everything up. Thats when i thought to keep everything in google drive.
 Pros:
 - Everything in online so you have no fear of losing them.
 - You can access them from anywhere without much configuration.
 - Its secured and scalable (gsuite is cheap)
 - Its available online all the time
 Cons:
 I have yet to face one.
 ​
 Configuration:
 - I used rclone to mount the google drive locally and then I can access it like regular directory structure. I did not face any noticeable slowdown during ivy-auto completion.
 - One issue you might face is - auto-saving. Slow-down occurs during auto-saving to remote storage so I just set a local directory as my auto-save destination.
 Here is a brief guide about my steps to set it up. (I am a newcomer so I would appreciate any suggestion.)

 I am Shuai. I am from a group of researchers from Monash University in Australia who are interested in making visual tools to assist in teaching and learning the Haskell language. I created the Chameleon type debugger to help Haskell programmers better understand types and solve type errors. You can check out our talk and our paper at ICFP2021. 
 If you know Haskell (whether you are a beginner or a veteran), I want to invite you to participate in my online user study (code challenge). You can check out some features of the Chameleon debugger during the study. The study is anonymous, and it will take you about 10 - 15 minutes to complete. But it will help us immensely. Click this link to proceed https://blend.ercu.be. 
 P.S. I know this is a form of self-advertisement after all. And therefore I have checked with the mods beforehand. To my surprise, they quite welcome my post here.
 Thank you,
 Shuai, Interactive Haskell Type Inference Exploration Team

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 Lately I was wondering about the most efficient/canonical way of quickly doing one thing (yes, only one) following a coundition result.
 In elisp, we have two possible constructs for that (at least?): and and when/unless.
 For exemple, at the very beggining of my configuration file, I have currently the following line:
 (when (fboundp 'tool-bar-mode) (tool-bar-mode 0)) 
 From a generic point of view, is there any more value to use and instead or not?
 (and (fboundp 'tool-bar-mode) (tool-bar-mode 0)) 
 Because if when is just a macro or something like that around if, I wonder if it is more efficient to directly call and?
 Thank you very much for your insight.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lists in Haskell are often used as persistent generators rather than data structures. This usually works very well, but can result in massive space leaks. Consider the contrived example below:
 main = print leak list = enumFrom <$> [0..] bigNumber = 10000000 leak = map (\n -> list !! n !! bigNumber) [1..100] 
 I reworked this example to avoid space leaks by defining a Gen typeclass which supports generators of infinite lists:
 {-# LANGUAGE FunctionalDependencies #-} module Main where main = print noleak genlist = EnumFrom <$> [0..] noleak = map(\n -> gens !! n `idx` bigNumber) [1..100] bigNumber = 10000000 -- For potentially terminating generators, val :: a -> Maybe b and next :: a -> Maybe a class Gen a b | a -> b where val :: a -> b next :: a -> a newtype EnumFrom = EnumFrom {value :: Int} instance Gen EnumFrom Int where val = value next = EnumFrom . (+1) . value idx :: Gen a b => a -> Int -> b idx a n = val $ iterate next a !! n 
 Although this approach works, simply being able to use a list would be far more convenient.
 My question: is there a way to make lists not leak space, or is there at least a solid library for non-memoizing iterators and generators?
 Edit: Thank you for the answers given so far! They have been very helpful.

 const doAThing = Promise.resolve(something).then(doSomething); 
 Looks harmless enough, right? But decide to split that line up, and you get THIS:
 const doAThing = Promise.resolve(something) .then(doSomething); 
 Having my js2-basic-offset set to any value you care to name does absolutely nothing. What I want is this:
 const doAThing = Promise.resolve(something) .then(doSomething); 
 I've tried using js2-bounce-indent-p (nothing happens when I hit <TAB>), I've made sure indent-tabs-mode is set to nil, I've tried with and without electric-indent-mode enabled (the same thing happens either way, it just happens when I type ( with electric-indent-mode enabled as opposed to when I hit <TAB> with it disabled), I've tried figuring this out for longer than I am comfortable admitting, and I'm just really frustrated at this point. It feels like emacs is trying to be really clever, when all I really want is for it to indent by the amount specified in my .editorconfig file whenever an indentation is called for.
 What am I missing?

 data Fraccion = F1 Integer | F2 Integer Integer | F3 Integer Integer Integer instance Num Fraccion where (+) = sumarFracciones (-) = restarFracciones (*) = multiplicarFracciones abs (F2 a b) = F2 (abs a) (abs b) signum (F2 a b) = signum (b * a) `F2` 1 fromInteger x = F2 x 1 sumarFracciones :: Fraccion -> Fraccion -> Fraccion sumarFracciones (F2 a b) (F2 c d) = simplificarFraccion ((a*d + c*b) `F2` (b*d)) multiplicarFracciones :: Fraccion -> Fraccion -> Fraccion multiplicarFracciones (F2 a b) (F2 c d) = simplificarFraccion ((a*c) `F2` (b*d)) restarFracciones :: Fraccion -> Fraccion -> Fraccion restarFracciones (F2 a b) (F2 c d) = simplificarFraccion ((a*d - c*b) `F2` (b*d)) 
 And we have to make it so the type "Fraccion" is declared like this: 
 data Fraccion a = F1 a | F2 a a | F3 a a a 
 So that functions can use Integrals as elements for the type. 
 We are desperate, since we can't find anywhere how to make "instance" work like this, any help would be appreciated. Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have made a minor « normal mode » for personal use, basically mapping navigation or editing commands to keys instead of self-insert-command. I mapped <escape> in prog-mode to switch to it and it's been serving me well.
 Recently, I had the idea of extending the normal mode bindings when a specific major mode is active. Specifically, I want <return> in my normal mode to call markdown-edit-code-block, but only when markdown-mode is active.
 I didn't want to add a binding that checks what the major mode is with cond and whatnot, as it didn't seem like a very clean or modular solution. Instead, I created a second minor mode with the one binding I need for markdown-mode and set it as a buffer-local variable. Now, when my normal mode activates, it checks whether the variable is non-nil, and calls it.
 It works, but since I don't know everything about emacs, I'm wondering if anyone has encountered this problem before and if there's an even simpler solution that I'm missing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I was making a little program I originally had written in (rather functional) JavaScript and wanted to replicate the functionality in Haskell, so I coded, googled some stuff every now and then, and eventually needed strip and a replace from to(which I manually wrote). I had written the entire thing (still rather small here) using the normal string (or [Char]) type. Though after reading up on how I could make a strip function I found out using Text is apparently a lot better overall and already has a strip function built-in (tho no replace from to). So I ported my program to using Text and noticed that some functionality just flies out the window which I did use quite a lot (Pattern matching for example), or is rather cumbersome to use (Concatenation, especially to normal strings; comparing with normal hard coded strings (less so than concat))
 So how should I replace such things when using Text? Constantly writing T. (as the package says one should) isn't really all that nice either, though I mind that less. I'm mostly missing the pattern-matching/recursion stuff and being able to easily compare/concat a Text to a hardcoded string. The constant T.append (T.pack "my string") myText just feels really verbose and unwieldly compared to "my string" ++ myText... The program does a lot of string (or well... text) manipulation, using pattern matching and concatenation quite a lot

 I installed org roam yesterday and I struggle to put other properties aside the default ID property. I tried a `%^{testprop}p`
 in the capture template, but it says "Capture abort: Wrong type argument: number-or-marker-p, nil" I'd like to had a capture option that puts and asks properties (like : capturing a book, with the a property : "object: book" and another property "author: " that I'm prompted to fill, for instance.
 But if I remove the `%^{testprop}p`
 it works just fine if i put things like `%^{thing}`
 ... it's just for properties that seem to have a problem. Also, I tested `%^{testprop}p` in a org capture template (not org roam) and it works fine.
 Here is my org roam part in my init file: (But if there is just a simple way you know, without debugging my init, i'd be glad too.)

 On the last discussion on the future of Elpy on github, some people showed interest in participating in its development (thank to them !). But a main maintainer to coordinate the whole thing and deal with core issues is still highly needed.
 If you are interested, please let me know, if you use Elpy, please show your interest, it may help someone to get decided :)

 My config looks like
 meta.txt - description of account and commodity
 account Assets account Spending account Grocery alias Food account CreditCard .. and so on 
 main.txt - link to specific records file
  ... include 2020.txt include 2021.txt 
 2021.txt - specific file with transactions
 .... 2021/10/16 Grocery shop Food $50.00 CreditCard 
 And there is a problem, when a try to run any command on file 2021.txt, for example C-c C-o C-r bal, i have an error
  
Report: bal
 Command: ledger -f 2021.txt bal
 While parsing file "2021.txt", line 6:
 While parsing posting:
 Food $50.00
 Error: Unknown account 'Food' 
  
When i run command at main.txt it works just fine

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have always wanted to write a completely hackable text editor which can be changed on the fly. I feel Emacs is the best when it comes to that.
 While I may start someday, what would be a good language to write it in? In my limited knowledge, the language should have the following properties:
  
It should be interpreted, not compiled
 It should have fast execution speed
 It should have good GUI-building capabilities
 It should be backward compatible
  
While many may suggest python, would that be good enough? I've heard it has slow execution speed and is not af all backward compatible. I could be wrong.
 Also, I believe the first step to writing such an editor would be writing an interpreter for the language in C/C++ and then writing the editor in that interpreted language? Isn't that how Emacs is written?
 I would really like your inputs. I know the question is really broad but I guessed Emacs veterans on this sub would be best qualified to answer my questions. BTW what do you guys think of TCL/TK?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Alright, I know this isn't really a Haskell question per se (being about emulating a Haskell language feature in another language) -- but I figured posting here would give me the best probability of getting an answer.
 Some of you may know that profunctor optics have been spotted in an open-sourced part of the Minecraft code-base, among other things. 
 While this is neat, emulating profunctor optics in Java (though I haven't looked at the actual encoding in the library) seems relatively straightforward to me: Java interfaces with generic methods can be used to encode rank N types, and a lightweight encoding of higher-kinded-types in langues with only first order generics is well-known.
 What I'm interested in with this library is the among other things. I noticed in the library documentation that (at least according to package naming scheme), this library also seems to have an encoding of type families in Java. This seems to be backed up by the fact that one of the linked papers in the readme of the project also uses type families. 
 This is more surprising to me. I know Java generics are Turing complete, but as far as I know, there are no academic results that would lead me to believe that type families can be emulated in Java (as I remember, the paper essentially uses an encoding of grammars as a kind of fluent interface in the proof of Turing completeness).
 Does anyone know anything about this seeming emulation of type families in Java? Has anyone tried to wrap their head around it, or know of any academic papers on how this works, or is this encoding a novel result applied just in this code-base , that has yet to be rigorously studied?

 So i have this line which is called post_data.scala

 But when i load it in http i only get the value : 
 action "get" node key "/big_data" value "Marius" modifiedIndex 11 createdIndex 11 
 while others get lastname and age as well, but i cannot understand why i dont but they do. I followed the same instructions as they did. Does someone have an idea what went wrong ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I have recently switched to emacs from vim and so far my experience has been pretty good (still trying to get used to elisp). One of the things which I had setup in my vimrc was a compilation command which would compile my code, I had heard that emacs had a command called `compile` and I tried to use that. I had noticed that when I did not have evil mode enabled the `compile` command would behave the way I had wanted and use the windows on the screen, however once I had turned on evil mode the compile command would not use the windows on the screen as I had wanted, I think that the best way to illustrate this would be through some images of it works with evil mode right now and how I want it to work:
 Whenever I have one window open and I run `compile build.bat` the compile command would make a new split and put the compilation buffer in there and this is fine:
 https://preview.redd.it/xqro9chktrt71.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=8e8849d1b3306b59a875758543201aab26c6f9d0
 However, the problem primarily arises when I try to compile my code on the second split, if I open a new file on the window with the compilation buffer open and run `compile build.bat` like before, evil mode will cause emacs to open a new window and run the code there, I want it to behave like it did without evil mode enabled and simpy switch to the other window in a split on the screen and run it there (I have drawn an arrow showing where I want to to open the compilation buffer which emacs did without evil mode enabled):

I can neither find a sitution where it is printed consitently nor can I find where the actual library is printing. Im assuming the print comes from reading the cert. files, however this should only happen once on startup? The printing happens around once every 3 minutes or so, seemingly randomly. I've tried to look at the source in hackage but to no avail. Any suggestions on how I could track this down..?

What are your favourite single zettels (or zettel groups) from the archive?
porn movie ("showing everything and nothing but that"), the "joker" zettel, and in my probings I found one about the hypothetical "Überbuben" and and one about Luhmann sitting in front of his office drinking from an inkpot  - those are amusing, but perhaps not crucially relevant.


What are your favourite examples of serendipity?


On a similar note - it is often said that a zettelkasten and its author should surprise each other.


The English Wikipedia page on Luhmann says "Luhmann himself described his theory as "labyrinthine" or "non-linear" and claimed he was deliberately keeping his prose enigmatic to prevent it from being understood "too quickly", which would only produce simplistic misunderstandings."]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Not sure what one would call this; "related buffers" is a bit weird. Here's an example, maybe you can help figuring out the term?
  
Visit a couple of files in a project folder (e.g. root has a .git/)
 Visit a couple channels on IRC via erc for team chat with colleagues
 Open 2 emails from your boss for reference
  
I usually navigate around by C-x b and filtering from there; sorted by recency, it makes switching back and forth simple.
 But let's say I have a potato computer and usually only 1 frame with 1 window open at a time or whatever, so the default is I look at 1 buffer. When I'm in IRC, I want to switch to other IRC buffers easily -- look at other channels, direct messages, whatever. Focus on these, don't show any other buffer in the suggestions.
 When I've switched to the project code, let's say I want to focus on other project buffers. (project.el and projectile do this already)
 Same with email: When I'm reading mail, show another mail buffer plz. Don't show me the IRC buffers or code.
  
I bet this has a name and tons of implementations, but I cannot figure this out. Like the ibuffer groupings work, maybe, but for buffer switching, ignoring stuff that's not in the current group.
 Any hints what to look for to narrow down the list of all buffers to "related" buffers?
 To write this myself, I'd filter (buffer-list) by condition(s), and pick a conditions based on context. E.g. if major mode is ERC, filter buffers by erc-mode:
 (require 'seq) (seq-filter (lambda (buf) (let ((buffer-major-mode (with-current-buffer buf major-mode))) (eq buffer-major-mode #'erc-mode))) (buffer-list)) 
 Is that a thing already?

 You see, I keep running afoul of company-mode, in that it decides at the last minute to produce a list of words associated with what I'm typing, and then, when I press enter (for a completely unrelated reason), it accepts the first choice, despite the fact that I had already typed what I wanted.
 No biggie, I just need to unset <return> for 'company-complete-selection, right? Maybe move it onto something a little less used, like M-<return>.
 Except I have no idea how to do that. I don't want to unset <return> globally, as I just want to remove the binding for company-mode, and since I use straight in my configs for installing and maintaining packages, I don't want to edit the original source (since any updates will overwrite it).
 Is there a method to unset <return> for 'company-complete-selection that I should be using?

 Recently, a video about GopCaml-mode has been made and published on this subreddit. The package itself is pretty good, and it left me wondering: What is the state of structural editing in Emacs, right now?
 Obviously, we have packages like Paredit and Lispy, recently we got SymEx, but these are all for the Lisp family of languages, where syntactic redundancy is very high because of the homoiconicity.
 I wonder if things like LSP can get us some level of standardized structural editing constructs for a set of languages supported by it. That would be really cool.

 Regardless, as I'm learning and falling in love with Haskell's inner workings, I'm struggling to thing of ways in which strict evaluation outperforms lazy evaluation (or examples where it is better to use strict evaluation compared to lazy evaluation).
 The only real thing I can think of is that Lazy evaluation requires more memory management than strict since you need to store "potential computations" that have yet to be done. But other than that I can't think of more examples

 I can understand that I can add some option like +RTS -M8g or something to limit my memory usage to 8g, but I do not understand where to add this to my stack.yaml file.
 The relevant part of my stack file looks like this:
 ``` executables: mnrl-exe: main: Main.hs source-dirs: app ghc-options: - -threaded - -rtsopts - -with-rtsopts=-N - -O2 dependencies: - mnrl
 tests: mnrl-test: main: Spec.hs source-dirs: test ghc-options: - -threaded - -rtsopts - -with-rtsopts=-N - -O2 dependencies: - mnrl
 benchmarks: mnrl-bench: main: Benchmark.hs source-dirs: benchmark ghc-options: - -threaded - -rtsopts - -with-rtsopts=-N - -O2 dependencies: - mnrl ```
 I usually use stack bench to run my benchmarks. What option should I add to my ghc-options?
 Also, what is the meaning of -with-rtsopts=-N?

 On my new computer, however, this isn't working - emacsclient always says it can't connect to the socket name, killing all daemon instances except for one (without a socket name) isn't connected to by emacsclient, and (all) variants of emacsclient -t -a "" (run twice to generate a daemon and then connect from a client) foreground themselves (?) and print the contents of *Messages* to stdout (???).
 My new computer is running Void (like the old); the big difference between my computer which works and the one which doesn't is that the new one uses ZFS. That shouldn't make a difference, though. Otherwise, init.org is the sole source of truth, and the only file copied - everything else was installed by way of tangling to init.el and running its straight.el-integrated use-package recipes.
 I've tried to find out what's going wrong by way of Google, then IRC. I don't know what to precisely search up and don't have the time. Does anyone know what's going on?

 Before, I was able to have all my packages loaded without using the (package-initialize) function. However now if I run my config like this, (without initializing) I just get an error saying it cannot load use-package, which I use instead of package.el for loading and such.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I use Gnus for my email solution, using GetMail to pop my various email servers to local and then parse them into gnus/notmuch. Works like a dream. The trouble is synchronizing sent mail. The solution I've used for several years is to automatically hide a BCC on everything I write, which sends to a sent-mail inbox that each of my PCs gets. Trouble is, not all information is saved in such a case. In particular, any other BCCs I have on the message are lost. This is a problem for the times I need to do "undisclosed" recipients lists. The answer seems like FCC field, which I notice NotMuch attempts to add on its own on the occasions I have mistakenly tried to write something through a NotMuch route. Trouble is, the notmuch default is relative to wherever directory location I am when I invoked it. Also, I read in the docs that things are appended to said location as mbox, like my spools, which means I need to think about how I am parsing that FCC thing.
 Before I dig in to a solved problem, how is anyone else making the most of FCC? Where do you put it, how do you parse it, do you put it in version control, etc?

 ​
 I am slowly but surely learning some haskell. I am going through the book "learnyouahaskell" and try to write the code before it is shown. I am currently at a binary search tree example and I don't understand the warning I get. Or lets say, I don't know why I get that warning. I don't think that these cases can even happen.
 The warning
 Pattern match(es) are non-exhaustive
 In an equation for 'insertInBinaryTree':
 Patterns not matched:
 (Node _ EmptyTree EmptyTree) _
 (Node _ EmptyTree ( Node _ _ _)) _
 (Node _ (Node _ _ _) EmptyTree) _
 (Node _ (Node _ _ _) (Node _ _ _)) _
 I mean lets take "Node _ EmptyTree EmptyTree _". How am I supposed to know whether it will be in the leftTree or rightTree?
 ​
 What did I forget to specify/constrain? Or what am I missing?
 The code is here:
 code: https://pastebin.com/AjddFFgV

 thank you in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am quite new to ZK method but I thought I understand the basic types of zettels, e.g. literature notes. While watching a workflow video about ZK I saw literature notes that make me wonder that I did not understand it yet.
This is how I do it
When reading a text and "marking important" parts I make a zettel of each part. Here are two examples from the same book but different:
# Shape of the world

The world is a ball.

Source: Bob (1876). The world. p.47

A second one.
# Alternative Shape of the world

Others think the world is a cube.

Source: Bob (1876). The world. p.419

You see: Two informations from two pages of the same book. This is how I would do this.
But in the video I saw two other interesting approaches. I would like to know how do you do this.
Alternative approach A
Approach one is to separate the source itself as zettel.
# Book: Bob 1876 The world

Full Reference:
Bob (1876). The world

Then the two informations
# Shape of the world

The world is a ball.

[link to "Book: Bob 1876 The world"] p.47

A second one.
# Alternative Shape of the world

Others think the world is a cube.

[link to "Book: Bob 1876 The world"] p.419

Alternative approach B
This is the other way around. The bibliographic zettel also holds the TOC of the book and link to the informations zettel form there.
   # Book: Bob 1876 The world

   Full Reference:
   Bob (1876). The world

   TOC
   1. Introduction
   2. Chapter X
   [link to "Book: Bob 1876 The world"] p.47

   3. Chapter A
   3.5. sub
   [link to "Book: Bob 1876 The world"] p.419

And the other two zettel.]]></summary>

But I figured it would be fun to implement a (left-associated) version of Generic1 using Generic. It seems it's been possible for just a few GHC versions now: it requires quantified constraints and data families with polykinded result along with a whole zoo of older GHC extensions. Here it is!
 Note: I definitely borrowed some marking ideas from Csongor, though I use them a bit differently.

I went with Notion, and what an great app. I got some ideas and thoughts like "that would be cool to have in Emacs". So how is your note taking workflow and what do you do to make Emacs feel less 80s ( UI packages and general functionalities)?
 EDIT: I should have explained better, what I liked is things like tables, Notion tables are incredible, you can easily replace a sheet editor like Google Sheets with it, the layout is really modular, you can organize the text in whatever way you want. The embeding stuff are really cool too, like calendar inside the file. So what I meant by modern is a interface that lets you do more functional stuff, like the tables that are not only pretty, but so useful.

 So I'm writing an app that of course works on a lot of data. So far all of the data was kept in a running program, after it was initially loaded from files. Before closing the app the data should be saved into the same files again.
 This has problems: - huge memory usage, unsustainable - there can be exceptions on save, better to have the data be saved incrementally and not loose it all.
 Solution?
 I want to add some database (is there other solution?). In a nutshell I want a simple library, best if can use existing Aeson JSON encodings or can generate all the typeclasses automatically. Complicating matters - I may need to combine in one atomic block both database and STM transactions.

 edit: 
 eldoc works, no the symbol's type is known to lsp. autocomplete is actually OK.
 however it's not about import vs. require. The destructuring seems to cause the problem. Doing like bellow causes no errors, but still does not navigate to the definition inside the d3-scale module.
 import d3_scale from "d3-scale"; const { scaleBand } = d3_scale;

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am trying to implement some functions on graphs which are like this:
 ``` module Graph.Algorithms where
 import Data.Set (Set) import qualified Data.Set as Set
 foldGraph :: Ord v => (v -> x -> x) -- operation -> x -- initial value -> [v] -- initial states -> (v -> [v]) -- successors -> x -- final value foldGraph op init inits succ = go Set.empty inits where go _ [] = init go sofar (v:vs) | Set.member v sofar = go sofar vs | otherwise = v op (go (Set.insert v sofar) ((succ v) ++ vs))
 collectGraph :: Ord v => (v -> [x]) -- result at each vertex -> [v] -- initial vertices -> (v -> [v]) -- successors -> [x] collectGraph forv = foldGraph (\v x -> forv v ++ x) []
 reachability :: Ord v => [v] -- initial states -> (v -> [v]) -- successors -> (v -> Bool) -- final states -> Bool reachability inits succ final = foldGraph (\v x -> final v || x) False inits succ ```
 Is this the best way to implement these algorithms? I plan to use this on graphs whose vertices are something like (Maybe Int, Maybe Int, Bool).
 I feel that this implementation is taking way too long on bigger (but not so big) graphs. For example, consider
 reachability [1] (\x -> [x + 1]) ( == 100000000)
 When I run this on GHCi, it blows up (takes a huge amount of RAM). But a python implementation using python's set returns like within 100 seconds or so.
 How can I improve on the performance of these algorithms?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey,
 I just took a job that was largely JVM-focused. I'm not new to the JVM; I've done previous work in Java (1.6/Android) and spent a large chunk of time writing Clojure. My previous work has been in Haskell, which I liked. I guess my question is: Is Scala worth it now? I have a larger Java codebase I'll be integrating with, and I get to choose what JVM technologies to use, and other folks have expressed interest in Scala as well. I'd feel guilty for pushing Clojure on them, just because I know it, but I've also been there and done that, and I like types now.
 Coming from Haskell, are there functional libraries I should build upon but allow for escape hatch style mutability for some of my not so functional teammates? We're a small team, and pedagogy will be a part of the gig. 
 I'm looking for honest opinions of the language and what essential reading material/libraries would be for someone more comfortable with FP in general. I'm not opposed to pragmatism either; it's one thing I like about Scala. It seems like there's a lot of excellent libraries because of the existing JVM ecosystem.
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a situation where I want to run a Megaparsec parser on a string that is the result of another Megaparsec action (not a final parse result). As an example, suppose I want to apply my expression parser on the contents of a Haskell-style line comment block within a larger program:
 -- x + -- y + z 
 Since I don't want my expression parser to worry about linebreaks being followed by --, the best approach I can come up with is to have a parser that extracts the contents of the line comment block, discards the -- prefixes, and then parses the resulting string. I can run the top-level parse function to essentially invoke a sub-parser, but this raises some questions:
  
How do I best propagate any parse errors to the top parser?
 How do I obtain the file name of the input?
 Is there another way to do this?
  
Instead of running an entirely new inner parser, I might also be able to play games with stateInput, but I'm not sure what the rules are for messing about with the state at that level.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[tl;dr; Do most people set their org-roam-directory to be the same as org-dictionary? And those that do not - why not?
 I have used pure org for my note taking & TODOs so far. However I do think I would benefit from org-roam/zettelkasten for subset of what I need - keeping a personal knowledge base (debugging history, analyzing problems, keeping track of stuff that has a potentially longer-term benefit, more wishy-washy "plans").
 What triggered this question was the fact that org-roam does not reuse org directory but has a separate variable for its roam directory. So I wondered if there was a reason to have org files that are not also roam files. One reason that came up was that the number of roam files can grow significantly and org-agenda would get slower and slower. So...
 My current setup idea is this:
  
I separate out org files from roam (or rather have roam files in a subdirectory of org directory)
 Use roam for knowledge-base, journal etc
 I generally won't do TODOs etc in roam files, but instead have a TODOs/Schedules in ordinary org (and these files are going to be part of agenda files)
  
Basically - use org-roam for idea/note taking that might or might not be related to tasks but don't actually mix tasks into the zettels. Zettels could be referenced/linked to from tasks if needed (i.e. if some information/knowledge could be useful to get the task done)
 I read through https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/hg2m5s/zettelkastenorgroamorgbrain_is_crap/ as an example of discussion of problems/benefits (though I realize that's for roam v1 and quite out of date I expect most problems to be the same currently).
 Does anyone use a similar split? How is it? What would I miss (I can imagine referencing agenda items from zettels might be useful etc). If you think I should just merge the two and use org-roam - how do you deal with agenda? Fixed set of agenda files (subset of roam files)?
 Hope the above makes sense...

 Edit: Added TL;DR

 Is there some simple way to do this with Haskell?
 Or is it completely different given that it's a compiled language? 
 I see can under ~/.cabal/store/ that it contains packages I've used in a project. But it looks to all be binary .hi files. Does the source code not even exist on my computer?
 If I want to navigate the package locally in my editor, obviously I can find it on github/etc and download a copy. But is that basically the only way to get a local copy of the source? Or is there something more efficient for packages that I'm already using in a project?
 I know you can browse on Hackage in your web browser, which is cool... but nowhere near as efficient as my normal editor where I do all my code navigating normally.
 I'm using vscode, and Cabal.

 class Functor w => Comonad w where extract :: w a -> a duplicate :: w a -> w (w a) extend :: (w a -> b) -> w a -> w b {-# MINIMAL extract, (duplicate | extend) #-} 
 It seems to me in many instances you could simply define:
 duplicate wa = fmap (\_ -> wa) wa extend wab wa = fmap (\_ -> wab wa) wa 
 Is this true for all instances? If so, the class is a lot less interesting than it seems.

 Now you can use SVG widget in GNU Emacs. That is, use an SVG image or fragment as background for push-button widget in Emacs buffer. You can also specify the width and height of the widget for finer control. Generally speaking, you can use any type of image for this purpose. But SVG suits best because you can draw widget of any size without any distortion.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi guys,
 I'm trying to develop flutter apps with emacs, I've tried lsp-mode + lsp-dart and it worked just fine... my only problem was that it was too slow, my emacs was very laggy (it might be the lsp server that is slow, but at least I could be able C-n C-p continually without lag while emacs waits for server response)... it had lots of features which probably contributed to this.
 I found dart-server which seems like it only requires dartanalyzer and not also dart language server, I tried it on a single test file and some features works. However, when I tried it with my flutter project it didn't work although it booted up the dartanalyzer I'm wondering if dart-server still works or is a viable option for dart/flutter dev in emacs.
 Also, what're your thoughts on eglot, does it stay out of my way until I request for features just like dart-server (e.g. C-c ? to give details about symbol under point, or M-/ for auto completions, rather than constant popups in miniframes and the echo area)
 This subreddit has been so helpful in my journey with emacs... thank you all
 EDIT:: sorry for wasting your time, after trying a few times, dart-server seems to work in the flutter project (also some things still aren't working, like flycheck support and intelligent completion with M-/). However, I'm still curious about eglot... I'd like some of the lsp features, but mainly on-demand

It took a minute to register. WTH? Buffer-face-mode was gone! I was in an org file with default Emacs faces. This is messed up. Let me restart again.
 Whoa. I'm getting a Flycheck error now, and faces are still wrong. Well, this doesn't fly. I'll comment out the dashboard stuff. WTH? The buffer's read-only! I toggle read-only, modeline shows file is writable, yeah, no. Let me switch to a different buffer. WTH? C-x b doesn't work! I'm flummoxed. I'm starting to hate on dashboard.
 Close the program. Start from a command line emacs -Q. That still works, anyway. Get to the init file, comment out the dashboard stuff, restart. Yeah, okay, great - I have my key bindings and my faces back. But, dashboard is the gift that keeps on giving. I still have the Flycheck error - 
 Wrong type argument: symbolp, (flycheck-mode-set-explicitly)
 Where did that come from? It wasn't here yesterday. And hey, guess what? A recursive grep for flycheck-mode-set-explicitly through all the files in elpa comes up empty.
 $ ls -R */*.el | xargs grep 'flycheck-mode-set-explicitly'
 It doesn't get any better than this.
 Actually, it does. I reluctantly decide to go to the Flycheck page and submit an issue, try to find out where this is coming from. Hahaha! Joke's on me. They don't handle issues from Windows. They dump them into a bucket and if someone comes along & handles them, great. In the meantime...
 In the meantime, I switch to Flymake.
 Afterward, I listened to "Not Just the Tudors" podcasts for three hours to regain my equilibrium. God, I love Emacs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Using vim-surround, if you have the text
 you say hello world and i say it back ^ 
 ...with your cursor on the character the carat indicates, then enter ys2aw", you end up with the line
 you say "hello world" and i say it back 
 However, in Emacs, when evil-surround is enabled, if you take the same initial line and perform the same keystrokes, you instead end up with
 you say "hello world "and i say it back 
 Is this a known issue, or expected behavior in some way?
 I stripped down my init.el so that the only lines in it require and enable evil and evil-surround, so I can't see how my configuration would be the problem. I wasn't able to find any reference to any similar issues on the Github though, which is surprising to me if other people are experiencing it; it seems like a pretty common command to run.
 If anyone else can reproduce this behavior, let me know so I know I'm not crazy!
 Edit: 
 A different means of achieving the same effect as desired is referenced in this issue: #25
 Also, after reading TFM and understanding how the aw and iw motions work, I agree with /u/bugamn that evil-surround has the most consistent behavior; since I like homogeneity (I always enable evil-want-Y-yank-to-eol), I don't really feel the need to raise an issue. If anyone else finds this irksome though, feel free to copy the text of this post to your heart's content if you do want to raise one.

 And it seems that most of us are actually using these projects. Then why are we so miserly about indicating our interest in projects.
 I can understand the low "stars" on following nice things as these not really highly relevant to Scala community.
  
 twitter / finagle 8,100  
  
 Angel-ML / angel 6,400  
  apache / zeppelin 5,400  
  gatling / gatling 5,300  
  polynote / polynote 4,200  
  intel-analytics / BigDL 3,800  
  microsoft / SynapseML 2,400  
  spotify / scio 2,200  
  almond-sh / almond 1,400  
 
 But what about the following, which have always been to focus of almost all conferences, talks, blogs and what not.
  
 milessabin / shapeless 3,200  
  
 zio / zio 3,000  
  circe / circe 2,200  
  http4s / http4s 2,100  
  typelevel / fs2 1,900  
  getquill / quill 1,900  
  tpolecat / doobie 1,900  
  optics-dev / Monocle 1,400  
  typelevel / cats-effect 1,300  
  scalameta / scalafmt 1,100  
 
 Are there really only 1,300 people who care about cats-effect ?
 Are there really only 1,100 people using scalafmt ?
 And I discovered just now that scalqa/scalqa has just 56 stars. yes, just 56!!
 Just why ? It's really funny compared to other comminities where even poc projects get more than 5,000 stars.

 https://github.com/positron-solutions/command-log-mode
 Using this package to stream is a little easier to read and especially more helpful if you were just casting keys. Command names make it very easy to figure out where to go hack. You can't always C-h k when you're dealing with the minibuffer or some weird modal package or using a command dispatcher like ivy or transient.
 Seeing the stream of function names is so helpful to get oriented faster. You might be questioning if the default org map overrides arrows (it does). Running with the log open quickly illuminates how your bindings and modes are all wired.
 Open issues or PR's to add more commands! I was going to add a minibuffer toggle and a way to pause logging (to preserve the mode state while hiding and stopping logging). Out of time tonight but I'll get around to anything nobody beats me to.
 The existing implementation was using global hooks instead of setting up hooks in the mode. It's more on the road to being a well behaved package now.
 Not on Melpa yet since I probably need to file an issue to take over the recipe.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all.
 I'm having consistent, but intermittent, problems with functions not being defined in .elc files. Here's an example.
  Debugger entered--Lisp error: (error "Autoloading file /Users/jabrahms/.emacs.d/elpa/lsp-ui-20210904.2037/lsp-ui.elc failed to define function lsp-ui") 
 This isn't an lsp specific issue. It happens regularly with different files. My normal path is to delete the .elc files and restart, but it's risen to the point of "Ugh. This sucks." so I want to fix it.
 Any clues why this is happening and how to prevent it?
 One suggestion I found suggested that it was caused by shadows in my load path. When I do M-x list-load-path-shadows, it outputs this.. which seems fine?
 ``` /Users/jabrahms/.emacs.d/elpa/magit-20210928.1325/magit-section-pkg hides /Users/jabrahms/.emacs.d/elpa/magit-section-20210829.1849/magit-section-pkg /Users/jabrahms/.emacs.d/elpa/soap-client-3.2.0/soap-client hides /Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/Resources/lisp/net/soap-client /Users/jabrahms/.emacs.d/elpa/soap-client-3.2.0/soap-inspect hides /Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/Resources/lisp/net/soap-inspect /Users/jabrahms/.emacs.d/elpa/seq-2.23/seq hides /Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/Resources/lisp/emacs-lisp/seq

 Any help appreciated.

 I am now using emacs more heavily for research at work (nice and fast). I have recovered from a permissions issue yesterday, but have now created myself new problems by trying to setup reveal.js to output some research via org-reveal.
 I'm on Ubuntu 20.04 via WSL 1, (Doom) emacs 27.1
 Following the instructions here I setup Org-reveal. 
 I now get a warning about magit-section. 
 Error in private config: config.el, (file-missing Cannot open load file No such file or directory magit-section) 
 Doom doctor tells me the following, but I'm baffled.
 :~$ doom doctor The doctor will see you now... > Checking your Emacs version... > Checking for Emacs config conflicts... > Checking for great Emacs features... > Checking for private config conflicts... > Checking for stale elc files... > Checking Doom Emacs... x There was an unexpected error Message: File is missing Data: (file-missing .

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[JVM primitive numerical types are limited to Byte, Short, Int, Long, Float and Double. For over two decades everyone was forced to use those primitives, whenever computational performance was important. Luckily, with Scala3 there is a choice.
 Let's define an opaque type Price, which will have all the functionality of a Float, will be as fast as a Float, but will be distinct from a Float. We will need to import Scalqa.
 import scalqa.{*,given} type Price = Price.TYPE.DEF object Price extends Float.Opaque.Data.Numerical[Price]("Price"): inline def apply(inline v: Float): Price = v.toOpaque override def value_tag(v:Price) : String = "$"+v.toFloat extension(inline x: Price) // Optional custom methods inline def isNotExpensive: Boolean = x < 100 object TYPE: opaque type DEF <: Float.Opaque = Float.Opaque 
 By extending Float.Opaque.Data.Numerical Price inherits numerical methods which match those for a Float primitive. Even better, all those methods are inlined, so when used, they will be reduced to primitive calls.
 Consider the following example:
  var price : Price = Price(9.99f) var primitive: Float = 5.99f price = price * 2 primitive = primitive * 2 
 when de-compiled to Java, it is clear: the Price is treated same as a Float:
  float price = 9.99F; float primitive = 5.99F; price *= (float)2; primitive *= (float)2; 
 We can use Price with the same ease as a primitive without any concern for impact on performance.
 On the other hand Price is distinct from a Float, so the following will fail.
  def discount(v: Price): Price = v * 0.75f discount(5.99f) // Fails // Type Mismatch Error: // Found: (5.99f : Float) // Required: Price

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I arrange my orgmode notes as single files with lots of entries. This works great for me because emacs is more buffer-oriented than directory-oriented, so all the emacs search commands optimize for single-file approaches (eg search all headlines in my tech/blog file for the keyword of that Linux function I've forgotten how to use).
 The single problem I have is footnotes. From the documentation you have two options: inline or in a file-wide section. My footnotes are often too long to fit inline, so I can change the name of that section but CANNOT make a section-per-entry arrangement, which is what I really want. The way I have worked around this with my blog is to always have the entry I am publishing at the top of the file, so using org-footnote-new finds that entries footnote section first and inserts things where I want them to be. I've used this compromise successfully for quite some time, but it depends on the fact that you are not going to add footnotes to anything but the top entry.
 Now I am converting footnotes in a non-orgmode date made by someone else, and moving the elements to the top of the file is not an option. Does anyone know of a way of implementing an entry-by-entry footnote section (say, for every * entry, or every ** entry as the case may be) without moving the single entry to the top of the buffer? The goal is for each entry to have a working footnote section of its own, which works nicely with org-footnote-action.

Quite vexing and difficult to google-for. I mentioned those recent installs mainly because that's the only thing I can think of, but I haven't been able to find anything that says that's a side effect.
 EDIT: Okay I can Shift-Tab and collapse everything. But org-cycle seems to be something else.
 EDIT: Oh yeah I also upgraded emacs/org-mode, so I could use roam, so that may have something to do with it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi guys, My emacs has been quite slow (esp. with lsp-mode/lsp-dart), I've downloaded gccemacs to hoping for some performance gain... I noticed that it took around 129 secs to startup ((emacs-init-time))); I tried it again, and this time, it took around 5.7 secs so I think it was compiling the .el files on the first run. Next thing I did was to start the normal emacs build to compare; This took around 150 - 200 secs, but like 10-12 secs on subsequent launches. When I tried gccemacs again, It took just as long as the first time again.
 It seems that the .elc files are not fully compatible between the two and so they are recompiled... Is there anything I can do about this? I'd love to use the gccemacs, but doesn't seem to be stable yet as I keep on getting comp warnings pop up in a Warnings buffer which is disturbing.
 I thought gccemacs would compile down to .eln while the normal emacs would compile to elc
 My gccemacs is v28.0.5 and normal emacs is like v27.2 Thanks in advance.

 The vim documentation is very interesting but I would love to find something like a beginner guide for evil-mode.

 I have three questions:
  
How can I use Emacs on mobile and sync across all of my devices? I need cross-platform usability, especially since I plan to use it on both my iPhone and iPad. I've tried Beorg, but it seems like it's only for task management.
 How can I integrate it with modern apps and services (e.g. Readwise)? This is something that Obsidian has, which I want to implement in Emacs if it's possible.
 What does Emacs have over Obsidian? Has anyone here switched from Obsidian to Emacs?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone,
 I use Doom Emacs with Evil and the +everywhere flag. I read Wiki pages with eww and I would like jump to urls with the same visual approach as evilem-motion-*, i.e., where the candidates are prefixed by letters.
 Defining the motion
 I followed the definition of the evilem-motion-* motions to create a new one based on shr-next-link:
 (after! evil-easymotion (evilem-make-motion evilem-motion-shr-next-link #'shr-next-link :scope 'line)) (map! :after eww :map eww-mode-map (:prefix "g" :n "<tab>" #'evilem-motion-shr-next-link)) 
 Which works as intended, but only highlight links in the current line while I wanted to highlight all the links in the window. This happend because I am using :scope 'line.
 Defining the window scope
 I managed to understand what was the scope handled by evil-easymotion, i.e., everything recognised by the thing-at-point function. But I didn't find any predefined thing matching the window. Thus, I have created a new one:
 (defun window-bounds-of-window-at-point () "Return the start and end points of a window." (save-excursion (message "%d-%d" (window-start) (window-end)) (cons (window-start) (window-end)))) (put 'window 'bounds-of-thing-at-point 'window-bounds-of-window-at-point) 
 And then I changed the scope of evilem-motion-shr-next-link from 'line to 'window.
 Problem
 Everything work well, except that (window-end) returns a different value when I run evilem-motion-shr-next-link via the eval prompt, i.e., pp-eval-expression, or via my keybinding.
 For instance, on (eww "https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/IntegerAtPoint") with the cursor at the beginning, the debuging message in window-bounds-of-window-at-point returns:
  
1-870 via the keybinding
 
1-1531 via the eval prompt
 
 Questions
  
Does someone know why there is this difference between the two approaches to call the function?
 
Is there a simpler and more efficient solution to what I am doing?
 
 Thank you in advance!
 Edit: Fix the formatting

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm wondering if Emacs supports the ability to search certain tags, by increasing / decreasing order. I'm planning on using date/time tags as such: <20211012113150> when writing in the appropriate heading, in one document. Would it be possible to search all entries, such that they show up in ascending order? the tag <20211012113150> represents the date and time in the format <YYYYMMDDHHMMSS>, and I'd be putting a tag each time I write in the different headings/subheadings. I'd like to be able to scroll chronologically through the different entries, and as such it would be useful if I can perform this type of search.
 I'm currently using Swiper as my main method of searching, is it possible to perform this type of search in Swiper?
 Also, is there a problem with how I'm planning on keeping my entries separated by topic, and tagging them so that I'd be able to search them chronologically? How many lines can one document contain before it's too much for Emacs to properly process?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm working on a pretty interesting project right now and I'm having different results depending on the build tool used: with cabal, the test suite fails but it passes with stack.
 My guess is that there must be some dependency version difference. So far I tried to "dump" the dependencies used by cabal using cabal freeze, and stack ls dependencies when using stack. An issue that I found is that while cabal uses my system-wide GHC (8.8.4), stack uses the GHC version defined by the resolver (8.6.5). Then, different base versions result in very different dependencies versions.
 Nevertheless, the test suite passes if I build the project using stack test --system-ghc (it uses GHC 8.8.4). I'm not really sure what dependencies are being used in this case (GHC 8.8.4 base or stack resolver base?). Running stack ls dependencies --system-ghc results in an error.
 So, how can I figure out why I get different results when building with the same GHC but different build tools?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello! You might remember me from two nearly identical posts over the past year, and now I'm back once again, because Chordify is looking for another Haskell developer! Last time we actually hired someone who found us through this subreddit, and it would be awesome to do that again.
 Chordify is a music platform that you can use to automatically detect the chords in any song you like. This way we help musicians to play all of their favourite music in an easy and intuitive way. You can try it at https://chordify.net
 Now, the backend for our website and apps, that are used by millions of people worldwide, is written in Haskell! We serve the user using primarily Servant, Persistent and Esqueleto. We also have a custom Redis caching layer and use an advanced Cloud Haskell setup to distribute our chord analysis computations.
 We are quickly becoming an autonomous workforce, meaning there is pretty much no hierarchy, and we are looking to expand our fast-growing team with a pro-active, independent and creative functional programmer to further improve Chordify. You'd get the opportunity to work with advanced type systems to power a website that serves millions.
 More information and a form to apply can be found at https://jobs.chordify.net. If you have any questions, feel free to ask them in this thread, or reach out to me at [rik@chordify.net](mailto:rik@chordify.net).
 We strive for diversity in our team, and encourage people of all backgrounds and genders to apply.
 One more thing, this is explicitly NOT a remote job. We expect our new colleague to come work with us at our (new!) office in Utrecht, The Netherlands.

 From what I understand though, radio targets only work in the same file. Currently my knowledge base spans a lot of small files. Assuming I concatenated them to one file, it would clock in at 5k lines (and constantly expanding). I am worried that this large org file would slow down emacs.
 Does anyone have experience with using radio targets in such a setup? Are my performance worries unfounded?

 What I mean, I need some maintenance tasks to be executed at a regular time.
 The easiest (and the more flexible) is to use a crontab which curl the URL where one piece of the URL is secret (ie generated when launching the server or in a config file). Is there a way to do that cleanly with Servant. By cleanly I mean a way which can assure that my route is protected like I will do with AuthProtect.

 Right now, I want to automatically add a timestamp (time of capture) to an entry when I use org-capture. What's the right way to do this? 
 Should I add an inactive timestamp right down below the heading? I was thinking of doing something like CAPTURED ON: [2021-10-02]. This is easy to do inside org-capture-templates. But then the first words can have special meanings (as in DEADLINE: ) which makes it look awkward.
 Or should I just add it as a custom property? If so, are timestamps completely legal inside the PROPERTIES drawer (and will they always be?). I've seen other people add a simple date without the brackets, but this won't cut it for me cause I want to use the timestamp with org-sparse-tree.
 Or should I add it as a list entry to the LOGBOOK drawer? Accomplishing this with org-capture needs some extra hacking, but this seems like the most semantically correct option.
  
Is it just me, or is org-mode syntax quirky? I'm confused about something that seems like a very common use-case?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm in one of those "... but it worked yesterday" situations.
 Seems like I suddenly don't have permission to access / write to my home directory (a local directory on the c:drive). I've not changed my setup at all, save for writing to my /home/ folder from Windows (I created and saved an org file using Notepad)
 I'm using org-mode in DooM emacs to take notes for work (making this all the more frustrating) via remote access from WSL (Ubuntu) on a Win 10 machine.
 On startup I get a warning like:
 Warning (initialization): An error occured while loading '/home/user/.emacs.d/init.el': Error in private config: config.el, (file-error Opening input file Permission denied /home/user/org_roam/A_RANDOM_ORG_FILE 
 There is a clue here as "A_RANDOM_ORG_FILE" was a file I was too lazy to use emacs for, so made in Notepad in Win10 and saved to my home/org_roam/ folder
 So:
 emacs --debug-init Debugger entered--Lisp error: (file-error "Opening input file" "Permission denied" ... 
 When I try to write the error buffer to a file (because WSL cut-paste baffles me), I get:
 /home/ write protected 
 So I'm here to ask: what? why? Given the generic-ness of the problem it's hard to google.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[How would I go about writing the definition of a typeclass that is constrained on a generic type, and uses the type it's generic on. for example: 
 ``` trait Request[Output]
 @typeclass trait Endpoint[R <: Request[out]] { def apply(req: R): out } ```
 I know I could make the typeclass generic on 2 parameters or have a type member on the trait, but is there a way to make it only dependent on the Request type? The information about it's Output type should always be deductible at compiletime.
 This would help with derivation above all things, since the derives clause doesn't allow you to give it parameters or type parameters.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am pleased to announce the release of a new package, linear-generics, based on GHC.Generics and the venerable generic-deriving. The killer features:
  
Generic1 representations associate compositions the right way around, which is to say the left way around, meaning no more inefficient fmaps or pesky Functor constraints.
 
to, from, to1, and from1 are multiplicity polymorphic, so you can use them in all your fancy new linearly typed code.
 
 The package includes Template Haskell-based deriving, based closely on generic-deriving, which is the recommended way to write instances. There is also a limited, somewhat unsafe, and somewhat inefficient way using provided DerivingVia targets.
 Many thanks to Arnaud Spiwack and Ryan Scott for their valuable advice and assistance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all. I am trying to create a website in HTML, and I would like to use Emacs org mode for that. The goal is to replicate this, https://html5up.net/dimension, in org mode. The index.html file looks something like this:
 <html> <!-- start main html block --> <head> <!-- start head definition like title, css..--> <head> <!-- start head definition like title, css..--> <body> <!-- start main body --> <body> <!-- end main body --> <html> <!-- end main html block --> 
 Within the main body, you have stuff like <div>...</div>, <header>...</header>,<footer>..</footer>...etc. The head definition for css, title, language is easy. In my org mode, I do this:
 #+HTML_HEAD: <title>Tab title for website</title> #+HTML_HEAD: <meta charset="utf-8" /> #+HTML_HEAD: <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no" /> #+HTML_HEAD: <link rel="stylesheet" href="assets/css/main.css" /> #+HTML_HEAD: <noscript><link rel="stylesheet" href="assets/css/noscript.css" /></noscript> 
 Basically, copy the content between <head>....</head> in the #+HTML_HEAD. The <body>...</body> is automatically create when you type stuff in the ... body of the document. That is fine too. The problem is the nested div, header, footer within body. 
 To simplify the problem, the snippet in the body has this form:
 <X id/class = "Y"> ...some code here... </X> 
 where X can be head if you do <head>...</head>, and Y is the keyword you use in the document for class and id, e.g:
 <div class="logo"> <i class="fas fa-fighter-jet"></i> </div> 
 How do I enter the above code in Org mode? Additionally, how do I nest them? What about the code in between them, use org-babel block?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[How do I check what functions emacs is evaluating when I type a given character?
 When I type the '<' character in org-mode, it automatically inserts a matching '>' character. I might have set this at some point; I checked the pairs in my electric-pair-pairs variable, which doesn't contain the '<' character. By `Ch k <key>`, I see that characters are entered with the org-self-insert-command function, but this doesn't tell me much about what settings I'm looking for.
 Bonus round, when I highlight a region and type '"', the region is wrapped in double-quotes. What variable do I customize to add other characters to do this behavior?

Functional Programming in Scala (The red book)
 Essential effects
 Practical Functional Programming in Scala
  
Or are there other books/order that you would suggest? I just want to learn pure functional programming in Scala (or as close to pure, but related concepts are welcome too).
 Is the book "Zionomicon" more inline with the red book than the two other books perhaps?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So till now I've been using the src blocks for just Python and R, and since they're normally repl anyway, emacs didn't seem that much more helpful (outside of not having to copy-paste the code and results into documents).
 ​
 But now, as I'm playing with some C code I fell in love with emacs again. I literally just write the code, press C-c C-c, and get my results. No manually compiling or anything, and the errors automatically popup on a seperate screen for you to fix.
 ​
 On top of that, print statement output are automatically cleanly separated into a table based on commas (but appear normally if you choose :output results).
 ​
 This has been so helpful for my operating systems course, and wow I'm so happy I found emacs.
 ​
 Thanks for coming to my talk (I hope the tags C Programming and Org mode help future searchers)

A new aeson release addresses the hash flooding issue, but you need more than a version bump to ensure your programs are protected. This post outlines how aeson addressed the vulnerability and what action you need to take.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi guys, emacs newbie here...
 I'm moving from package.el to straight.el and Ive been trying to install use-package with it; I keep on getting this error: straight--convert-recipe: Could not find package bind-key. Updating recipe repositories: (org-elpa melpa gnu-elpa-mirror el-get emacsmirror-mirror) with ‘straight-pull-recipe-repositories’ may fix this I ran emacs -q and only executed the minimum code I think is required to install use-package with straight.el but it still gives that same error:  (defvar bootstrap-version) (let ((bootstrap-file (expand-file-name "straight/repos/straight.el/bootstrap.el" user-emacs-directory)) (bootstrap-version 5)) (unless (file-exists-p bootstrap-file) (with-current-buffer (url-retrieve-synchronously "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/raxod502/straight.el/develop/install.el" 'silent 'inhibit-cookies) (goto-char (point-max)) (eval-print-last-sexp))) (load bootstrap-file nil 'nomessage)) (straight-use-package 'use-package)  I know there is a bind-key.el file in the use-package repo, so if it is required by use-package, I don't know why it can't be found.
 I've already used straight.el to install god-mode and it works just fine, I've also used use-package with package.el and that too works just fine.
 Any help would be appreciated.
 PS I'm using Windows 10 64 bit, Emacs 27.2

 Most of the Scala libraries I could find have not been updated since 2.9.x or only supported simple multiplications. Are there any OpenCL or CUDA leveraging libraries that work on 2.12.x?
 Or is it possible to call C++ code from the JVM?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Most articles I read about functional programming all point out that it's better to write concurrency program in a functional way. With functional programming, one can forget the mental burden to maintain the state of variables, make less mistakes, etc.
 But they don't provide examples and I can't get an intuitive view about this. Are their any books or blogs provide such an example between the imperative one and the functional one in terms of the concurrent programming? Thanks.

As other nifty features of ivy it was introduced a few years ago in a post: https://oremacs.com/2016/06/27/ivy-push-view/. It has replaced many uses of winner-mode in my workflow. Essentially it saves a buffer inside the window layout it had at the moment of the "snapshot", then you can choose to go back to buffer as per usual or inside any of the different layouts in which it was saved. All this from the plain old (ivy-)switch-buffer interface.

 IE if errors exist, don't show warn/info. If no errors, but warnings exist, dont show info. I'd be ok with just the first too, if it's a simpler solution.

My name is Neal, I'm in California and likely starting a new software engineering job soon.  I've been using a paper Bullet Journal (BuJo) for a few years. I like that it is offline and I can problem solve with it, since I spend so much time online, and recently I've been looking for ways to make my bullet journal more searchable and useful.  So I came across the Commonplace index, and Zettelkasten, both of which look promising.  I've made some few steps on implementing both in my bullet journal.  I'll have new things to learn quickly in my new job so any advice on first steps, software engineering, working on paper, or anything related etc would be greatly appreciated!
Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been using org-mode for a long time, but I'm not a programmer nor an expert. I just really like Emacs and org-mode. The hierarchical structure is not good enough for lists of data with multiple shared parts. I get lost in what is called a Wicked Problem [look it up on Wikipedia if you want] constantly almost always when I include another list, then I need to rearrange the contents of the lists for better comprehension and/or less clutter/repetitiveness.
 Hi, sorry if this seems simple to you, but I can't get my head around this so far. I've heard of something called orgmode roam or orgmode brain, but it seems that I am just stuck and constantly looking up more search results while not comprehending much of what i find really.
 ​
 I'd like some real world examples of how would you solve this problem preferably with emacs/org software if possible

 Micro works as expected. Espanso v0.7.3 works as expected with emacs. Can anybody think of a reason why that I can share with Federico the dev?
 I also tried touching the config, that didn't work either. He is looking at his code as I type so hopefully he will spot something, it is rust and I don't know rust :smile:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am trying to use org-cite in org mode 9.5. My emacs is emacs-mac 27.2 (aka Mitsuharu Yamamoto's emacs mac port). I use ivy for completion, otherwise my emacs is pretty minimalistic.
 When I use org-cite-insert, I can see bib items in my minibuffer, and I can multi-select bib items with enter key. However, I do not know what key or keybind to press to actually insert the bib keys I have selected.
 My org-cite seems to be configured correctly, because if I just type by hand the citation [cite:@key], it fontifies alright. The only problem is, I do not know how to actually auto-insert such citations by org-cite-insert.
 I have consulted org manual, and also googled a lot, no solution so far. Any help on this?
 suggested solutions so far:
 - <C-return> :: doesn't work

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Until recently, my init.el basically just called org-babel-load-file on my literate configuration file. However, this led to slow startups and issues where the wrong version of Org was getting loaded; as such, I'm trying to move to tangling my config.org.
 As of now, I'm just setting :tangle yes :results silent as properties on my config.org as well as having a function on after-save-hook that checks if the file I just saved is my config, and if so, to tangle it to init.el.
 This doesn't feel particularly "tasteful" though, since it means that if I want to make my config easily clonable, I either have to:
  
Commit both my init.el and config.org to github (which will essentially be the same file), or
 
Upon cloning my config to a new machine, flounder around in stock Emacs before tangling my config manually (with an out-of-date, built-in ob-tangle) and restarting, instead of everything working out of the box.
 
 So, I thought I'd ask /r/emacs: what do you consider the most "canonical" or "tasteful" way of tangling a (single-file) literate config?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to help my friend set up her Emacs. She needs to calculate total time duration from some time data. Currently she uses an Excel sheet to log all start and end times of the events, and then calculate the total time of the events. 
 I think org-mode with timestamps can achieve the same thing. For example,
 * Event 1 <2021-10-10 Sun 1:00-2:00> * Event 2 CLOSED: [2021-10-11 Mon 5:00] SCHEDULED: <2021-10-11 Mon 3:00> 
 the total time is 3 hours. Is there any simple way to do the calculation? I've searched for this but it seems there is no built-in function for this. Thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi friends! I know that we could control the size of inline images displayed in org by setting org-image-actual-size to 500, or 50%, or '(500, 400, 300) or adding a #+attr_org: :width 50% :height 50%. But all these methods doesn't work for remote inline images, i.e. I can't control the image like this: [[https:example.com/image.png]].
 Here is an example:
 original
 show inline image in 20%, but the size of the first image is not changed
 ​
 show inline image in 5%
 So, anyone has any suggestions? How could we let org-mode resize the displayed remote inline images?
