        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone, is there an alternative formulation of monad transformers that allow removing any reference to the base monad inside the e.g. bind definition of the transformer ? 
 The reason I'm asking for that is I'm porting some Haskell transformers to Python, for which I would like to avoid chains of lift.lift.lift... 
 A good way I found is simply to make a custom subclass of each transformer in the stack, so that they can be looked up for their lift by "tag" (the specific subclass) rather than numerical position (aka number of lift nesting). That would make composition of function using different monads very easy, even if they have not been designed to work together specifically 
 This would still allows the user to use multiple transformers of the same type (e.g. StateT), since the user can create as many subclasses of StateT they want for each piece of state.
 The problem with that is that if the user uses e.g. SubclassofStateT.pure(42), the base monad is not known , and has to be "resolved" later (when looking up the index of this class in the stack to lift appropriately). Unfortunately automatic, lifting is not enough since the definition of e.g. pure() would require the knowledge of the base monad which we don't have at this stage. Hence the need for an alternative formulation that allows delaying this knowledge to later.
 EDIT: fix typos

In the instance I'm currently exploring, OPML files are the intermediary between the ZK and, in this case, iThoughtsX.
The trick will be to get correct OPML file formatting as an output via Marked 2, python, applescript or Keyboard Maestro.
Check this out for a first rough go. So far only one level thick. But this was easy. Each link on the central node is a child node on the mindmap. The full text of each child node is attached. Links within the text are not hot, but we'll see. 
I've attached the file so you can download, review, and explore the ideas. Requires an app that will read iThoughtsX files. This type of download might be a way of sharing a specific idea thread from my ZK with the world.]]></summary>

 We built it to help all people living in oppressive regimes communicate freely with each other, without fear of persecution because of what they said and who they are connected with.
 During the terrible conflict between Russia and Ukraine, people of both countries – I have friends and family there – could be at risk when sharing their opinions or just from being connected to people who were prosecuted.
 Every messenger app that knows who you are can end up sharing all of your connections with undesirable third parties, either as a result of a court order or as a result of attack - so even Signal, which has strong encryption, cannot protect your connection graph.
 Huge "thank you" 🙏 to 137 people who helped us test and improve the apps and to u/angerman who helped a lot by compiling our Haskell code to mobile platforms and getting it accepted by app stores – and we have just submitted the release than makes the app working on iPhone 7.
 From our experience – building mobile apps with Haskell is non-trivial but doable – so if you have complex client-side logic that benefits from the advanced type system, then Haskell is a viable choice – we hope our project makes it a bit better for others too.
 Let us know what you think about the apps and we are looking forward to releasing the new features, e.g. e2e encrypted WebRTC audio/video calls – see the full release announcement here.

 Trying to use "assertThrows" as I'm trying to learn about unit testing, but I'm stuck. I made a simple calculator and wrote some tests to test them, they are all fine, simply using assert, but as soon as I want to test that an exception is supposed to be thrown, the test fails with the following error message:
 type mismatch; found : org.scalatest.Assertion (which expands to) org.scalatest.compatible.Assertion required: Int assertThrows[ArithmeticException](calculator.divide(10, 0)) 
 Here is the code I'm using:
 import org.scalatest.flatspec.AnyFlatSpec import calctest.Calculator object ScalaTestingStyles class CalculatorSuite extends AnyFlatSpec { val calculator = new Calculator "Calculator" should "add two numbers" in { assert( calculator.add(10, 5) === 15 ) } it should "subtract two numbers" in { assert( calculator.subtract(10, 5) === 5 ) } it should "multiply two numbers" in { assert( calculator.multiply(10, 5) === 50 ) } it should "divide two numbers" in { assert( calculator.divide(10, 5) === 2 ) } it should "Throw an exception if denominator is zero" { assertThrows[ArithmeticException](calculator.divide(10, 0)) } } 
 And here is my simple calculator:
 class Calculator { def add(a: Int, b: Int) = a + b def subtract(a: Int, b: Int) = a - b def multiply(a: Int, b: Int) = a * b def divide(a: Int, b: Int) = a / b } 
 It's the last test that is failing, this was part of a rock the JVM tutorial, but instead of funspec I'm trying to learn flatspec. Why is this failing please?

I would rather use a link-as-search to be as future proof and software agnostic as possible. I also prefer to use a UID internal to the body of the text instead of using a filename as I am very new to this and still changing my titles. To create an internal link, I copy the UID number of the filename (without the title) at the top of the body of my zettel. Then in my second zettel, I open a [[]] and inside I paste the UID number of the first zettel. The [[UID]] becomes green. When I hover on it it says that the file is not found. When I click on it, a search is launched and I have my two zettels that appear in the search bar but the target zettel does not open automatically. Is it normal? Should it only open in the search bar?
I saw that a "#" was sometimes set before the UID (in the body) of the zettel of origin. Is this necessary besides to denote that it is the zettel of origin?
Thank you and sorry if it is a bit messy (or very obvious), I am totally new with markdown and all of these softwares!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been studying FP for a while now in my spare time, mostly in Scala and TypeScript. I've gotten very deep into it. I feel I have a strong understanding of all the core concepts, as well as all the most common monads and other main design patterns. In short, I feel like I've got a very solid grasp of programming in FP.
 My problem lately just comes down to putting it all together at scale. Whenever I've tried to write a full app using purely FP design principles, it feels like it becomes a mess as I layer on more and more features. Because of this, I feel my main limitation is how to use functional composition for a larger system when dealing with network requests/responses, database operations, dependency injection, loose coupling, etc. I can write an application that does all these things, I just haven't been really happy with the results.
 What I'm hoping to get is one of two things. The first would be an example codebase, something open on GitHub. Something using, maybe, http4s and cats? Something that I can look through and study how it's been architected, maybe even transcribe it (I have found that re-writing code makes it stick in my head better than just reading it).
 On the other hand, maybe there are some tutorials/courses/etc out there which cover this kind of stuff. I really do NOT want one of those "This is a functor" type FP courses, I don't need that at this point. Something that goes much deeper into full-scale application construction is what I'm after.
 Thanks in advance for any help and guidance you can provide.

 Also I want to use something similar to time.graphics for visualisation. It's quite expensive though. 
 Do you have any ideas, on how I should visualise timelines?

This happens even after waiting for a long time. I would expect to be prompted for a password each time the encrypted contents is to be shown but this is not the case. Is this the expected behavior? If not, how do I prevent it from happening?

I've been using VS code for work, but in school we used a very basic setup for Java programming in Emacs and I enjoyed using Emacs (I don't do Java programming though).
 I want to really learn Emacs and have gone through the basic tutorials. I want to start adding packages but it all seems so overwhelming to me. I'd like to add a package at a time to my basically blank configuration.
 Can anyone recommend just the basic packages I should have to do C/C++ and Python until I learn how to use those? I'd like the basic IDE stuff like syntax highlighting, autocomplete, file differences and a file tree. Recommendations? What else should I have?

 I've fount solution for this issue here: https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/48719/keep-text-selection-after-indenting-with-evil 
 It works but I have couple of questions. 
 Whenever I use evil-mode and when I select some text and move/indent it with "<" and ">" , in mini-buffer there is message Wrong type argument: wholenump, nil Should that concern me? 
 Currently, this fix is placed outside of mine use-package config of evil-mode. Could that be the reason of the message in mini-buffer? It would be nice if I could place this fix inside of my use-package evil-mode config.
 Here is chunk of code from my init.el : LINK
 Thanks in advance,

Most of the texts I write need to combine the two.

 What is your setup with gnu-icalendar?

 As a user, I am quite thrilled about named routes, as well as another change in Servant 0.19 brought by our team at Tweag (this time driven by Andrea Condoluci): better error messages for faulty routes. Writing routes in a type-level DSL can be tricky because errors can get hairy, and you lose a lot of the benefits of interacting with GHC's type checker. Both of these changes should help make Servant APIs more manageable, and more accessible to newcomers.

 What I want to do is to define a function insert that will run the appropriate version of insertXXX based on the type of the first argument, imagine something like the following:
 insert :: pair -> [(a, b)] -> [(a, b)] insert = case typeOf pair of (a, b) -> insertOrd (b, a) -> insertFlipped _ -> fail_during_compilation 
 Of course, that code is not valid Haskell, but I was wondering if I could achieve something like that using some type-level magic.

 Tracking back a bit, I was wondering why .dir.locals were not being read, and it was because of the hook failure - all later hooks were being halted as a result, so it was not reading .dir.locals. I was only able to notice that by going to the *Messages* buffer.
 Is there a way to configure Emacs to throw an error when a hook fails? That would be much better for debugging and for making any errors obvious. I don't want to be lenient to hook failures.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A very annoying issue with desktop-save and desktop-read that I'm encountering at the moment:
  
I'm starting Emacs in daemon-mode, and then open a client frame. I do 'desktop-read' and my saved desktop opens with the 10 or so frames I had saved.
 
When I go to one of the frames with a buffer I'm no longer interested in, and do C-x C-c, I end up not just closing that particular frame, but all 10 or so of the frames that were open.
 
The Emacs daemon is still running, and opening another client frame shows that the buffers haven't been killed, so nothing has been lost per se - it's just that the arrangement of all the frames I had is just ruined.
 
 Any idea how to stop this behaviour (i.e. being able to just kill one frame from the saved configuration)? 
 I should add that I have also been using the minimal setup for desktop.el as shown in the EmacsWiki, but I /think/ (but am not sure) that the problem is independent of this.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello ,
 I'm looking to write a function, for my role-playing games, allowing me to create random tables with elements that have weight.
 For example, consider the following list:
 1 - 20 : 2d6 kobold
 21 - 45 : 1 troll
 46 - 100 : 3d6 orcs
 Running the function I want to be able to pick 20% of the time the "2d6 kobold" etc.
 Ideally, the function would allow me to automatically execute the dice roll. I will have then, for example: 5 kobolds!
 Not being a programmer, all I can do is create a function to select an item from a "flat" list.
 Any idea?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am pretty new to Haskell and learning it for fun, coming from Python. I recently tried to solve a problem using memoization, and I was surprised how hard it is in Haskell. I read up on a few things, for example
 https://en.m.wikibooks.org/wiki/Haskell/Fix_and_recursion
 that provides the basic concepts. Naively, I had assumed that pure functional programming language should make memoization *easier* as there are no unintended side-effects. Instead, basically every approach I found requires me rewrite the function definition itself of the function I want to memoize. 
 Am I simply missing something? Are there some techniques for memoization that don't require rewriting the function? Maybe some compiler settings?
 Thanks!

 The (" starting on line 3 and the snippet

 break autoloads for all sorts of packages in a way that is hard to track down (paren/quote mismatch leads to invalid autoloads for rest of the file).
 The snippet does not always feature the same numbers. Example:
 34 35 (face default) 91 92 (face default) 148 149 (face default) 201 202 (face default) 260 261 (face default))
 ...any ideas on this? These snippets have appeared in a wide number of autoload files-- magit, org-roam, valign, some ivy rich packages, etc. They do not appear in the upstream git repositories.
 ​
 They also reappear on package update, breaking large swathes of functionality.

Last Week
Wrote a scientist profile using The Archive and Marked2
Created a Poetry of Zettelkasting video showing how I use The Archive and Marked2 in my writing
Studied and became more familiar with the writer tools in Marked2
Read The Secret to Superhuman Strength by Alison Bechdel, a graphic autobiography. ★★★★★
Didn't re-engage with woodworking like I said I would last week. I'm trying again this week.
This Week
Refactoring Meditations on Self-Discipline 201901021303 from 90% quotes to 90% my assimilation of the quotes meaning. This book I onboarded at the beginning of my ZK journey. So I've spent about 10 hours over the last couple of weeks on this. It is a rewarding time spent refactoring this series of 30 notes—only a few more to go. "Ferraiolo, William. Meditations on Self-Discipline and Failure: Stoic Exercise for Mental Fitness. O Books, 2017."
Reading and onboarding "Paul, Annie Murphy. The Extended Mind: The Power of Thinking Outside the Brain. Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2021."
Spring Break, so no JAMM328 assignments
Re-engage with woodworking. Maybe having a tie-in with my ZK might help motivate me. Thanks, @sfast, for the link to a beautiful ZK cabinet.]]></summary>

For example I recently was chatting to a friend about a particular chess analysis he was experimenting with and although he is a non-programmer we were able to explore the idea very deeply through a quick 2 hour XP style discussion. He was 100% able to follow the data types and basics, but most importantly able to follow and guide the algorithms that resulted (as much as I was encoding english to haskell, he was also able to map back from haskell to his own internal model easily). 
 Haskell might be difficult to write, high learning curve etc, but its simplicity to read and follow is an underrated super feature?
 I blogged about it here (if you are interested in more detail of our XP session and some code snips etc) https://www.tomwells.org/blog/haskell_for_prototyping

 (global-set-key (kbd "M-b-b") #'bm-toggle) but that doesnt work because: "M- must prefix a single character, not b-b"
 I tried multiple combinations, like "M-b M-b" but without any success. Is it possible to do this with global-set-key or even the :bind in use-package?

Would something like this be useful to you?
 Is there already a better way to do what my implementation here is doing?
 If you think it could be useful to you, does it seem intuitive to use?
 What features do you wish it had, what could be improved?
 If you are kind enough to do a code review, have I made any obvious mistakes? (I am still new to Emacs Lisp).

 I like [DT's theme](https://gitlab.com/dwt1/distro.tube ) 's theme - but how do i get his particular dark theme? Sorry if this is a very specific question...

 If not, is there any other place where i can just get the link for the theme, and apply it , like the one in the pic?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Having previously worked with python, java, C and javascript I have developed some personal preferences for features/styles in programming languages that don't seem to be supported in more modern popular and low-level languages (Go and Rust).
 I'm wondering if these patterns are incorrect or if I'm attempting to use an object-orientated or functional style in a procedural language where it doesn't fit.
 The following are a few of my favourites that initially sprung to mind.
  
Chained operations on arrays/lists with functionally defined behaviour e.g. a.filter(a => a > 5).sort().slice(2).max()
 Wrapper alternatives to checking for null. e.g. extending the previous example ...2).max().else(0)
 Inline everything. e.g. if a is b then c() else d() and for 1..X as x do a += x
  
Am I a functional programmer in denial? The only thing keeping me from this conclusion is that I use a lot of oop techniques in tandem with the above.
 Or do I just want what's bad for me? In support of this is the fact that all the languages that allow these patterns are very generic and mainstream and don't have the careful direction of your Gos and rusts.

 Let me start by apologizing for this long ass post. I'm having trouble articulating what I want. 
 I am using Doom Emacs.
 There are two things I have been trying to figure out how to do. They are probably very simple but I can't seem to word them correctly in text so I am having trouble finding solutions. 
 I have ADHD, so things become very messy very quickly. If I don't lay things out a certain way I can become distracted and/or lose interest. One way to prevent this is by adding some flair to whatever I am doing. Does anyone have an easy way to add some style to an org document? Some ideas I had was to change header colors, add images (which I have sort of figured out), and maybe add borders or something.
 Another issue caused by my constant mental blockages is organization. When I had seen projects in the Doom dashboard I thought this would work but it seems designed for coding projects. How does everyone organize their org files? I'd like to find a way to set up a notebook type thing and open a directory in a buffer to navigate between the different files. Like a table of contents for every projects, and maybe a master TOC for all of my org files.
 Again, sorry for the long winded post. I suck at Reddit, and don't expect much response cuz long posts get ignored, but figured I'd shoot my shot.

 How are you doing?
 I'm getting excited about this post because when I understood how hl-line-mode works, it opened new horizons for me in the world of Elisp.
 I hope you will feel the same way after:
  
reading this post or,
 by directly reading the source code of hl-line-mode that can be found in the file lisp/hl-line.el (only 205 LOC skipping comments and empty lines).
  
You can get emacs's source code by running the following command:
 git clone git://git.sv.gnu.org/emacs.git

The topic is an open source library I'm a co-maintainer of for a couple of years now. https://github.com/ReSwift/ReSwift
The general idea of the library may survive, but the library itself is likely about to become obsolete in 1--3 years because of technical changes. That's why I want to do something with this, anything really, before it can only go straight to the trash. (Aka the sub-conscious of the Zettelkasten through forgetting about it.)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last week, I released my new emacs package zetteldesk.el and made a post here for showcasing it. The idea was rather well accepted but I got a lot of feedback, that the README was too dense in information and it was hard for a new user to try it. I have tried fixing this, by integrating gifs for demonstrations instead of the raw info (which I moved to the wiki for anyone wanting it), adding a set of default bindings in the form of a hydra and a small sample config to get you started.
 ​
 I believe some people might have been set off by those problems, so I wanted to say thank you for pointing them out. I would love to hear what you think of it now, that I have tried to make it more explanative and if it is truly easier for someone to get started with it.
 ​
 As I said in the other post, I am very new to this, so I really appreciate and listen to feedback, as I feel the idea itself is good, but some parts of the implementation may be lacking, and who better to help me than the community.
 ​
 Thank you all for helping,
 Best regards,
 Vidianos

 I'm looking for a way to set a keybinding to switch the current active buffer to a specific one. In my case, it would be something like "C-c p" to switch to my Python run (*Python* buffer).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Since in my last Scala job we agreed that functions will be separate from data, I have often felt the urge to make many (most?) of those functions into extension methods. However, I felt it would introduce a bunch of boilerplate code that is not really necessary in any way.
 Now with syntax changes in Scala 3 generally, and also with the dedicated syntax for extension methods I don't see any reason anymore to not write code this way. Feels like the best of both words.
 Can you think of any reason why that would be a bad idea. While I don't have this problem right now, I can hardly imagine reviewers being content with such code in PRs, though I can't see a reason for objections either.

I'm just trying to get "my feet wet" a bit in browsing elisp and github. I'm guessing it's a local variable, being used only right there? That's Question1.
 Question2: So also, why does my search on github not find the reference for "ctf" in org.el? On github, I've set the repository to 
  
emacs-mirror
 mirrored from git://git.sv.gnu.org/emacs.git
  
Then in the upper left search text box, I do a "search in this repository" for ctf. It only gives me two files:
 test/lisp/epg-resources/seckey.asc
 doc/misc/mh-e.texi
 Question3: Why doesn't it also list org.el? Am I misunderstanding that search function? I was looking for any other references to "ctf" in the code base. 
 So that's my final question (Question4), is how do I find all occurrences of something in a repository using github web interface?

 Today I was trying to debug Scala.js within an IDE (both IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate and VSCode).
 I've read some posts/issues/jetbrains issues but all of them are older (2016-17 era), but the most they managed to get is in-browser debugging.
 As years passed, is there a way to properly debug through an IDE?
 Also afaik debugging depends on sourcemaps, so does error tracking libraries such as Sentry. Is it possible to properly error track Scala.js?

 which is fair enough to understand and works but it sure feels like a Hack. Moreover I'd like to use this for more languages and I'd like to set the underlying mode through org mode as a pragma.
 But since this would be so convenient I wanted to ask if there is already something like this and I don't have to invent a new wheel.
 Cheers!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One thing I realized today from reading Johannes Schmidt’s paper1 is this:
In Luhmann’s second ZK:
Luhmann had 67,000 Main Notes (aka, Permanent Notes)
And he had 15,000 Literature Notecards in his bibliography (usually with about 10-15 bullet points of thoughts and page numbers per book or article he read).
This means for each book or article he read, he only creates on average 4 to 5 main notes.
The other bullet points (like the other 10 bullet points) he would just make references to the book and page numbers.
He would go to a card about Ideology for instance and write “For more on Ideology, see Williamson p. 256” for instance.
I think there’s an assumption out there that one ought develop every bullet point literature note they take.
Any thoughts on this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I'm new to Haskell and trying to wrap my head around it, coming from imperative languages it's so different I might as well have never coded in my life. I find the syntax... strange, to say the least.
 I'm trying to understand a solution for a function that detects if a String is a pangram (contains every letter of the alphabet), here it is :
  isPangram text = all (`elem` text) ['A'..'Z'] 
 What I don't understand are those parentheses, they don't make sense to me. 
 As far as I can tell, elem takes 2 arguments; a character then a string. So what does (elem text) even mean? It has to do something, because if I take those parentheses out, the function no longer works. Yet (elem text) doesn't actually work on its own, so what is going on here?
 Also, all takes a list of booleans right? Assuming all is supposed to be applied to a list of booleans, I would think that (elem text) ['A'..'Z'] should get reduced to a list of booleans, but actually that code also doesn't work on its own. Where is the list of booleans all is applied to coming from, then?

 From the docs, (setq package-enable-at-startup nil) doesn't "make installed packages available when Emacs starts". So, does "installed packages" here refer to packages found in load-path? Also, what does it mean for a package to be "available"? Such that (require 'package) will work?
  
 Then, (package-initialize) will "load Emacs Lisp packages, and activate them". So what do "loading" and "activating" here mean? Does "loading" here mean the same thing as (load FILE)? Then "activating" means (provide FEATURE)?
  
 I've tried reading Elisp Packaging Section but still couldn't understand

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On behalf of maintainers I'm happy to announce that bytestring-0.11.3.0 has been released. It will be a part of upcoming GHC 9.2.2.
 The focus of this release is an extended API for ShortByteString, submitted by /u/maerwald as a part of Abstract FilePath Proposal. bytestring is proud to be a part of this initiative, aimed to provide much faster and more principled FilePath type. Huge thanks to /u/maerwald for spearheading it!
 Other highlights from the changelog:
  
UTF-8 support: add Data.ByteString.Short.isValidUtf8 and use safe FFI for large inputs.
 Improve performance and laziness of unlines.
 Improve performance of intercalate.
 Improve allocations of singleton.
  
Many people contributed their time and effort to make this release happen. Just to name a few in no particular order, mostly according to git log:
  
Alexander Biehl
 askeblad
 Ben Gamari
 Dmitry Ivanov
 Jaro Reinders
 Johannes Waldmann
 Julian Ospald
 Koz Ross
 Matthew Craven
 Patrick Pelletier

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So years ago I did a project with Scala and really liked it, and now that I'm very into functional programming these days I've picked it up again through a course I'm taking on Akka. I've got a lot more experience with Java & Kotlin than Scala, fyi.
 Anyway, while doing this Akka course I just decided to create a nice simple utility function within an object to abstract away all the boilerplate setup/teardown for actor systems during the course:
 package io.me.akka package io.me.akka.utils // BONUS: Not my main question, but why do we declare packages twice? import akka.actor.ActorSystem import scala.concurrent.ExecutionContext.Implicits.global object ActorSystemHandler { def useSimpleSystem(name: String, useSystem: ActorSystem => Unit): Unit = { val system = ActorSystem(name) useSystem(system) system.terminate() .map(_ => println("ActorSystem terminated")) } } 
 My issue is when i try to use this into one of my lesson objects, like so:
 package io.me.akka package io.me.akka.part2actors import io.me.akka.utils.ActorSystemHandler // This is the line for #2 import akka.actor.{Actor, ActorRef, Props} object ChangingActorBehavior extends App { ActorSystemHandler.useSimpleSystem("systemName", system => { // Do stuff with the system }) } 
 There are two main issues that occur:
  
When I type the name ActorSystemHandler, I get the option to auto-import it like usual in IntelliJ. However, when I actually click that option, nothing happens. The IntelliJ auto-import fails to do anything.
 I go ahead and manually add the import statement, as can be seen above. However, "io.me.akka" part of the import is shaded in that grayish color that IntelliJ uses to indicate something is not necessary.
  
I'm hoping someone can clarify the above points for me. Manually adding the import results in code that will compile/run, but I feel like I'm doing something wrong. Thanks.

 Then I want to extract client using:  UsersRoutes { usersId = fromServant @_ @(AsClientT ClientM) -> UserIdRoutes {..}, ..} = genericClient @_ @ClientM 
 GHC politely tells me that fromServant cannot be applied to the pattern, because type mismatches.
 How can I distribute captured id to UserIdRoutes in convenient way when I want to extract client from UsersRoutes using pattern matching?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Is there a package which automatically and intelligently rewrites variable-name to variableName or variable_name depending on the current major language mode? It should be intelligent enough to account for cases where you're typing within the bounds of string quotes. The more I think about this problem the more difficult I think it would be to write such a package --- perhaps none exists.
 As an example, let's suppose we're writing Python (with | as the cursor):
 Basic:
  
variable-name|
 variable-name |
 variable_name | (conversion performed)
  
In quotes:
  
variable_name 'foo-bar|
 variable_name 'foo-bar |
 variable_name 'foo-bar | (no conversion as the user is typing within quotes)
  
In f-string:
  
variable_name f'foo {bar-baz|
 variable_name f'foo {bar-baz |
 variable_name f'foo {bar_baz | (conversion performed)

One of the most basic presuppositions of communication is that the partners can mutually surprise each other. Only in the way can information be produced in the respective other.
If...we seek communication with the second mind, we must seek internal possibilities for linkings which result in the unexpected (i.e. information).


In digging through the forums, it seems that some believe that Luhmann (and/or the community) overstates the importance of surprise in a Zettelkasten. If you are of this belief, can you enlighten me as to why you make this claim?]]></summary>

 I never use those keys. I would like to define at least one of them with a whole lot of bindings for entering unicode symbols (for instance, right-alt-A as the "alpha" symbol). I assume I'd want to set them up to act as "super" or "hyper" in emacs lingo.
 This is under windows, but I'm also interested in doing the same thing when I'm running emacs on an AWS linux box (via XMinG under windows).

 Is there a reliable way to view/edit Org files on android? Viewing should be rendered, with embedded images, not as plain text.

 I tend to have electric-quote-mode enabled when working with text and org files, for the sake of the typographic curly quotes, and I noticed that functions like forward-word and count-words-region are "fooled" into thinking that possessives and contractions are two words instead of one whenever the Right Single Quotation Mark (0x2019) appears inside a word as an apostrophe, becoming a "separator" rather than just part of the word itself.
 The straight-quote apostrophe (0x27) doesn't seem to have this problem. I found out that it's defined in the text-mode syntax table as a word constituent, so naturally I figured the easy fix would be …]]></summary>

 I have a quick question regarding multiple selections with consult: Helm Buffer has a feature which allows selecting multiple buffers via C-SPC in order to kill those at once with M-D (see here). Does consult-buffer provide a comparable feature? If so, how could I access it? 
 Furthermore, I would like to generalize the question: Given any consult-* command, how can I select multiple items and act on those with the help of embark?
 Thanks in advance!

 I was going to post there, but I think this is more of a general how to question.
 I have a shell script that I've been using as a template for my blog posts. I think, I could rework it to end up as an org file. But I recently watched a System Crafters video on org roam which talks about org-capture-template particularly the template in Org files bit
 if anyone cares about the script here's the gist
 is there a way to make an org template for blog posts that would work like org-capture but store the file in path/to/jekyll/_posts
 TL;DR is there a way to make a chord to open an org template for blog posts?

 At the same time, I'm developing my note taking workflow using Org mode and Org Roam.
 What's the best way to sync the two? I don't have a preference for which Android app to use, as long as it allows me to take notes directly on the PDF in a way that can then easily be exported and integrated with the rest of my notes in Emacs.
 I don't mind writing a little conversion script if necessary, e.g. to automatically insert some links to my org-roam nodes where possible.

I would like to move away from spacemacs for the sake of flexibility and control. Spacemacs is too late for some of the important items like native comp and their develop branch sometimes has bugs.
 I would like to minimize the changes in my workflow, if I cant keep them the same(keybindings et. al.). Replicating the same environment is proving to be cumbersome due to :
 - Spacemacs setup has too many packages, I am not even 1/4th of the way through and already the literate config is a couple of thousands of lines long.
 - I am used to the keybindings of spacemacs and replicating them is taking too much time. I have already built all the muscle memory and don't want a different set of keys.
 - Going through all the documentation of the packages to get the exact setup as I had in spacemacs is very tricky. Sometimes spacemacs has some clever ways of handling things, which needs me to look into spacemacs code.
 - Going over spacemacs code is complex. I am now left with the feeling that I am replicating spacemacs code in my config.
 Has anyone felt the same? how have you dealt with this?

 I have an issue in the new Scala3 docs. Special characters in entities are not escaped when the scala doc is generated, which leads to some issue when hosting the scaladoc on some website like Github Pages. An example would be a class named "~" which generate a file called "~.html" which is not found by Github Pages
 However in previous Scala2 scaladoc the character was escaped with something like "$tilde.html"
 Any idea if it is possible to get this behavior in scala3 ? 
 Here are a working and a flawed example :

 Notice that the first hline (horizontal line) is slightly thicker than the others, because it is interpreting the first hline as a column header. 
 Is there any way to stop this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I want to set up my personal development environment for C++ in emacs, and I have a few questions:
 I installed clangd and LSP, and if I open just one .cpp file it's all good, but when I bring in multiple headers and files in different directories it doesn't know where to find them (of course), how can I fix it? Also, I used to use makefiles, but I read that since clangd uses something called compile_commands.json and CMake can produce them, the latter would be a better option... the problem is that I don't know how this whole interaction works and I can't find a clear explanation about this on the internet. Lastly, is there a way to use only makefiles instead of CMake, or is it either impossible or impractical?

Indentation: It is the tabulator key after all
 Completion: As in TAB-completion in the terminal
 folding: like in orgmode, but most code that has blocks can be folded
  
I don't have a good solution for all of them at once. ideally it would support different packages for Indentation/compilation/folding.

The next release of Emacs, Emacs 29, will come with built-in support for pixel-based scrolling.
 You can enable it using pixel-scroll-precision-mode. 
  
I hadn't heard of this. Has anyone used this? Are there any performance issues? In my 5-minute testing I haven't noticed any.
 EDIT: According to Emacs' etc/NEWS, this is what the new mode actually improves in comparison to pixel-scroll-mode:
  ** New minor mode 'pixel-scroll-precision-mode'. When enabled, and if your mouse supports it, you can scroll the display up or down at pixel resolution, according to what your mouse wheel reports. Unlike 'pixel-scroll-mode', this mode scrolls the display pixel-by-pixel, as opposed to only animating line-by-line scrolls.

This combo of the software The Archive and Marked2 are the absolute best writing software combo ever!
A part of the writing process that this video doesn't show is the gathering and referencing of the entire ZK when making the zettel that makes up this essay.

Best view in full screen.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey folks, how are u doing?
 So... I have a doubt related to the usage of for comprehension...
 Lets imagine that I have an User type that is the product of UserId, UserName and UserEmail and each of them contains its own validations, right?
 So lets imagine that my value called UserName looks like this:
 ```scala final case class ValidationError(message: String)
 final case class UserName private(name: String)
 type UserNameFactoryResult = Either[ValidationError, UserName]
 object UserName { def fromString(rawName: String): UserNameFactoryResult = ... // some validation blabla } ```
 Now I am trying to think about the factory for the User entity inside of my object companion.
 I want to use somekind of for-comprehension but I dont have any idea on how to mix the for-comprehension with my either results
 ```scala case class User(id: UserId, name: UserName, email: UserEmail)
 type UserFactoryResult = Either[List[ValidationError], User]
 object User { def createFromStrings(rawId: String, rawName: String, rawEmail: String): UserFactoryResult = { val eitherUser = for { id <- UserId.fromString(rawId) // this can be Left or Right name <- UserName.fromString(rawName) // this can be Left or Right email <- UserEmail.fromString(rawEmail) // this can be Left or Right } yield new Right(User(id, name, email)) } } ```
 well well... what I need to do with this code is to find a way to CORRECTLY returns EITHER a List with each error that happened in those type values EITHER my valid User with its correct values.
 what should I do? what is the cleanest way of doing this with pure scala 3? can I avoid nesting pattern match inside this for-comprehension? how to go on with this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello guys! I am a front-end web developer, tired of JS-TS.
 First of all, I am not familiar with Scala and its ecosystem, so, sorry about that.
 I own a startup which is close to make a deal with an organization for a serious project.
 I always search for viable JS alternatives and really like Scala as a language (even though I have no experience with it).
 For the last 2 days I am researching on how to embrace Scala-js. I managed to gather some information. 
 Concern no 1: interop with the JS ecosystem. Solution: scalably-typed
 Concern no 2: react bindings. Solution: Slinky
 Concern no 3: bundler. Solution: Not so sure, but I've found scalajs-bundler which works with webpack, but I am unsure about the integration with Concern no 4 bellow.
 Concern no 4: Monorepo setup-build system. 
 If anyone is familiar with JS ecosystem, there is the nx.dev monorepo managing tool which has the features I need for this project, which will be structured with a feature based folder structure.
 What I need:
  
apps folder containing 3 applications which will share many libraries-modules from the libs folder mention bellow 
  libs folder which will contain feature based modules, for reuse across the 3 apps
  
Something like this:
 apps/
 ├─ app-1/
 ├─ app-2/
 ├─ app-3/
 libs/
 ├─ feature-1/
 ├─ feature-3/
 ├─ feature-4/
 ├─ feature-2/
 ​
 How can I achieve this? Anyone with experience with something similar?
 As a reminder, those 3 apps and libs will target JS, and will need a bundler.
 Is it possible to only build the affected apps when changing some feature on libs folder?
 Even if it is possible, how maintainable will it be?
 Thank you for your answers!

 Enrique here! The consult-project-extra package got recently accepted into MELPA. Nevertheless, expect to also find the package in GNU ELPA in the future, since it only requires packages either built into Emacs or on GNU ELPA (as is consult).
 Please, try the MELPA installation process, and test the functions out. I really appreciate any comments.
 Best,

 ​
 Motivation:
 I found the exwm built-in functionality for moving windows between workspaces pretty buggy. If I remember correctly, my major issue was that the built-in functionality only worked for windows displaying exwm buffers but I wanted all windows to be treated equally. I also threw in a completing-read interface that I though I would use but haven't found much use for it. Instead I find the functionality to move windows to a specific workspace by number far more useful. 
 ​
 Anyways, feedback welcome. Happy to post to melpa if people find it useful.

 I found emacs-dashboard (dashboard.el) to be a bit to involved for my liking. I wanted a much more minmimalistic splash screen that achived the following goals:
  
Centered text (any arbitrary ascii banner) regardless of the current window size. 
 Used just a single buffer rather than requiring a bunch of duplicate buffers to achive requirement #1. 
 No flashy buttons or other things that I would never bother to click anyways. 
  
​
 Its probably not everyone's taste but it does what I need it to. Perhaps others will find it useful. If people want I can put on melpa. 
 Feedback welcome.

 This is just a really minimalistic (same theme as dired-registers) implementation of a copy-paste interface like Ranger or Ranger.el (just much more minimal).

 ​
 https://github.com/jsilve24/dired-registers
 ​
 Motivation:
 I like emacs bookmarks but I rarely want to create something so permanent to just hold my place when moving between directories (e.g., when copying and pasting files between directories; see dired-copy-paste for more on copying and pasting in dired). This package lower the barrier to keeping your place by implementing registers storing a directory and making it easy to jump back later. Think of these registers like temporary bookmarks that don't persist between sessions (just like evil registers).

I discovered that lengthening the heading sufficiently (just adding more text) and rebuilding the agenda makes the asterisks white. Removing the extra text and rebuilding again greys them out again.
 I noticed this happening a couple of days ago. What is going? Is this meant to happen, and if not, what can I do about it?

 Would anyone have some recommendation for learning how to programmatically manipulate org-mode with elisp? 
 I don't have much elisp knowledge but all the other 3rd party libraries I have found are read-only and could not find anything that allow manipulation of the file itself. 
 I have digged into the source of org-element api but I am left rather confused than anything. 
 I am trying to build an integration with gitlab and orgmode (full project description here) and while I wanted to go with either python or go, I haven't found an easy way to modify org files with any of these libraries... 
 So I am trying to go with elisp, which would probably be the most native way to do it, I am just not sure where to start...
 any direction is welcome!

"Folgezettel is More than Mechanism"
This article intends to:
Show that the current state of the FZ debate is one mired in a mechanistic reading of folgezettel
Add to the discussion the often overlooked experiential aspects of employing folgezettel
Show how the practice of folgezettel positively influences the note making process
Diversify and broaden the discussion in an effort to show that zettelkasten techniques are more compliments than competitors
From the article:

  
"A mechanistic view is one that privileges the mechanics of a process over the experiential. It ignores the emotional. It tries to establish cohesion often through reductive arguments, determining value (more or less of it) by how parts function together as a system divorced from the subjective experience of the user. As it stands, the folgezettel debate is mired in this mechanistic systems thinking...."]]></summary>

 As far as I understood, Emacs provides printing.el lpr.el, and ps-print.el to print text but not pdfs. I use pdf-tools which provides pdf-misc-print-document which I can use to print with lp by setting pdf-misc-print-program-executable and pdf-misc-print-program-args. However, I am looking for "Print Dialog" like package where I can select the (network) printer, the pages, the orientation and the double-sided vs not, etc... 
 I can write a lisp function to query for these, but I am wondering if there are better solutions out there.

 I have switched to lsp-pyright and everything is fine except Python documentation functionalities. I wondered if anyone has the same problem as me and I hope that someone can give me some pointers on how to fix this.
 The problem I have is that lsp-doc-show and company-show-doc-buffer return incomplete results for many builtins and many numpy functions. Envoking these commands on list for example returns
 class list() 
 and nothing more.
 I have tried quite a lot and I am pretty confident that it has to do with LSP itself or my LSP setup because anaconda-mode-show-doc yields
 builtins list() list(iterable: Iterable[_T]) Built-in mutable sequence. If no argument is given, the constructor creates a new empty list. The argument must be an iterable if specified. 
 which is what I want from LSP.
 Any ideas?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I have this function which solves this problem: https://purdue.kattis.com/problems/trainsorting. solve is the naive recursive version and solve' is the DP version. I used the method shown on the Haskell wiki to construct the DP matrix. 
 The algorithm works, but its runtime scales with the bounds of the matrix, so it takes a prohibitively long time with bounds higher than 1000 or so. I don't understand why though, since I can tell by the trace that it only calculates the required elements. My first thought is that it has to preallocate the array, but I tried it with a Data.Map as well for the same result.
 Any explanation is appreciated

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Using Haskell has made me think about imperative languages differently. An interesting thing to think about is that the “async/await” patterns of these languages mirror monad patterns in Haskell with do-notation. The “await” keyword with “var x = await …” is just like “x <- …” in Haskell. And Future is really just a monadic type! Perhaps one day we’ll see an imperative language implement true monads and do asynchrony in terms of them.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am experimenting with Doom Emacs but it feel like performance is at least as bad as it was with my hand-rolled config. I am running 28.0.91 with native comp on Mojave.
 The stated startup time on the splash screen is normally 2-3 seconds: "Doom loaded 208 packages across 34 modules in 2.06 seconds". Restoring my previous workspace with 20-30 buffers takes 7-8 seconds. Opening a file in a project takes 1-2 seconds. At first I thought it was due to LSP mode, but it's still slow even with it disabled.
 I have followed some of the recommendations in Doom's README "why is Doom slow?", but my situation seems a bit more pathological than what those try to address. 
 I tried profiling opening a single line file (took a second or two) and the CPU profile says that it spent 28% of its time in automatic GC and 51% of its time in vertico--advice. I'm assuming that was the file selection popup, so it appears that Emacs is really just spending all its time waiting for something. I'd be grateful for advice how to debug further.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all! I'm currently implementing a source code formatter using prettyprinter and ran into a situation that I can't get over.
 The assembly of the Doc is performed in the context of a state Monad, as I need to keep track of some state as I go on:
  type StateDoc = State MyState (Doc ()) 
 This works fine, I have individual functions that assemble different parts of the document:
  fortmatPartA :: DataA -> StateDoc fortmatPartB :: DataB -> StateDoc fortmatPartC :: DataC -> StateDoc  It the end when I put the document together, parts A, B and C are to be arranged on top of each other vertically:
 vsep <$> sequence [formatPartA dataA, formatPartB dataB, formatPartC dataC]
 Now the problem that I'm having is that formatPartB and formatPartC can return an emptyDoc, which can result in something like [PartADoc, emptyDoc, PartBDoc]. This is a problem because emptyDocs have a height of 1 and will introduce an unwanted newline in the final document. I would like to completely ignore the part of the document if it returns emptyDoc.
 Does someone have an idea of how I can achieve this?
 I thought about not using emptyDoc at all, but Maybe instead:
 formatPartB :: DataB -> State MyState (Maybe (Doc ()))
 but how could I implement the "excluding" logic that ignores the Nothings? Is there something like a mapMaybe or catMaybe for Monads? Maybe I'm missing something obvious.
 Thanks a lot for your help and happy haskelling :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone,
 I am working on a software project which I am organizing my tasks in a hierarchical structure where a top level heading is a general feature and the sub headings are tasks that need to be done concerning that feature.
 This is very simple so far, what I would like to add now is a milestone tag so I can associate some features with a specific version, this is a very common approach in software development as far as I know. The problem is that when I write a tag containing dots, org-mode considers the dots as tag separators, so I cannot write a tag as the following :v1.0: because it would be replaced with :v1:0:.
 If anyone has any workaround for this let me know. Or if you have any other suggestions I would like to give them a try, I myself thought about some alternatives but I would first want to know if I can do it the way I want.

But I'm working through the book at https://book.purescript.org/ and am wondering why the code and tests all produce a bunch of warnings?
 For example, one warning I see for the Chapter 2 code is:

I'm working in VSCode and have v0.14.7 of purs (and generally the latest versions of everything as far as I know). Maybe the book would prefer me to use an older version of the compiler?

The more i read about it the more i get the feeling that it would be much more time-efficient to just master emacs and forego going deeper down the rabbit holes of bash shell scripting and the various Gnu utilities and .etc. It seems to me that with emacs I pretty much get a entire environment in which all packages,commands,config files and etc are all written in one language(e lisp). So that being said, can I just go "all in" on learning emacs and e lisp and just more or less ignore bash scripting and learning more about the various linux terminal commands?

EDIT: Answered by /u/yyoncho: "You can sort by downloads on melpa.org". So here's an example of how I'm using it. As an emacs newbie, I'm interested in installing some package, let's say ido mode, but I'm also interested in the dozen or so related packages (containing "ido-"). But it's hard to get a sense of their popularity, age, etc. 
 So I downloaded the list of all packages from melpa.org, sorted by download count, and made it into a tab-delimited file: Here's the gist link to my text file.. Then I grep that to get only the "ido-" packages:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Given this structure (Example 1), if point is anywhere in the line Proj1 (Level 1) and I hit C-S-RET, it will create a new "Level 1" TODO heading just before Proj2 (Level 1)
  
Example 1
 * Proj1 (Level 1) <-- IF POINT IS ANYWHERE HERE * Proj1 H1 (Level 2) * Proj1 H2 (Level 2) * Proj1 H2 Note (Level 3) blah blah * Another Note (Level 4) blah blah * Proj2 (Level 1) <-- C-S-RET INSERTS "* TODO" JUST BEFORE HERE AT LEVEL 1 * Proj2 H1 (Level 2) 
 
 But if they are folded and point is after ellipses:
  
Example 2
 * PROJ1...x <-- point at space marked x * Proj2... 
 
 When I hit C-S-RET I get this:
  
Example 3 
 * PROJ1... * TODO * Proj2... 
 
 That TODO has two invisible parents, which obscures it's context, which is shown unfolded here:
  
Example 4 
 * Proj1 (Level 1) * Proj1 H1 (Level 2) * Proj1 H2 (Level 2) * Proj1 H2 Note (Level 3) blah blah * Another Note (Level 4) blah blah * TODO (Level 4) <-- TODO ADDED HERE * Proj2 (Level 1) 
 
 Why does C-S-RET add a TODO exactly 3 levels deeper in this case? Why not any of the following alternatives: 
  
At level 1 (same as not folded)
 At level 2 (immediate child)
 At level 5 (depth first traversal of tree)
  
What is "magical" about 3 levels deeper? What are some ways for a typical beginner to deal with this? Maybe "never use C-S-RET after ellipses"? I certainly don't want to memorize that rule. Or is there some control variable?
 I think that a sane default would be one of the following:
  
At level 1 (same as not folded)
 At level 2 (immediate child)
  
Any insight would be appreciated, thanks!

Last Week
Impermanence is all around me. Everything I see is a temporary arrangement of atoms soon dispersed and reassembled into new arrangements. My attention is also always temporary. Attention flitters from one object to another in a time frame that speeds up and slows just a little from the moment of awakening to after fully sleeping. Even then, dreams grab my attention.
I successfully integrated The Archive/Marked2/Zotero/Pandoc toolchain into my writing environment.

 Here's what I've done so far to troubleshoot. If I manually look for the messages in a terminal by going into my mu maildir, I can see the archived messages. Additionally if I run `mu find some-message` I can see emails in the Archive directory. If I send my self a new email and then archive it, I can see it in emacs.

 Hello fellow emacsians. I am in the very happy position to announce to you, my first ever contribution to emacs (besides helping people with emacs here and in other forums), in the form of a new package for emacs called zetteldesk.el. It is by no means done, I have things I want to add, and I am certain its also not perfect, but its usable, and to an extent polished so I thought I would release it. I am just an engineer who loves to take his notes with org-roam, so forgive me if some code isn't written in the best version.
 ​
 The name zetteldesk derives from a mix of the words zettelkasten and desktop. I shortened it because zettelkasten-desktop was too large. zetteldesk.el is a tool I made, built primarily on top of org-roam - b…]]></summary>

 Trying to find the "best" ide and corresponding plugins for each programming language was just annoying to me. For eg. IntelliJ IDEA is great for Rust, but doesn't have an easy C++ support. 
 Thus my decision to switch to something like emacs or vim, which would have all-round support. 
 I completed the tutorial and immediately felt how convenient it would be to navigate around without having to take your hands off the keyboard. 
 I want to now continue to set up Emacs so that I can conveniently use it for the above needs. I'm setting it up in Manjaro Linux. 
 Do you all have any tips?

Well more and more I find myself knowing-but-not-quite some fact or info, or knowing that I know it, but not the full details that I knew at one point, or references or sources for looking it up.
So I decided to take the plunge and implement a zettelkasten system for myself. But as I investigated it I became intrigued by the simple yet powerful idea of notes and links, and decided to try to distill (my interpretation of) its essence into a new app. Yes, the cliche of the software dev who discovers zettelkasten and makes an app. However, I think mine has some advantages. For one thing I'm intentionally keeping it quite spartan–no endless customizability…]]></summary>

I might be going about this the absolute wrong way but I've never used a language like this before and I'm getting very lost. 
 Assignment:
 Write a Haskell program that generates the list of all the subsets of the set [1..n] that have as many elements as their complements.
 For the set [1,2,3,4] the output should look like this:
 [([1,2],[3,4]),
 ([1,3],[2,4]),
 ([1,4],[2,3]),
 ....] 
 I'm currently creating a list from 1-n where n is 6.
 I'm retrieving all of the subsequences of that list.
 let n = 6 let set = [1..n] let ordered = sortWith length $ subsequences set 
 I don't understand how to only get the list of the length of 3 out of this list of lists. What would be the best way to get the list of that length? Thank you for any input! I believe I can figure out the compliment on my own. I just don't know how to get the certain lists I need.

 Im a converting a Try to Either but IDK how to pass my own Type Alias so I can compile.
 Example:
 ```scala
 type UserIdFactoryResult = Either[ValidationError, UserId]
 object UserId { private def apply(id: String): UserId = new UserId(id) ... def fromString(rawId: String): UserIdFactoryResult = { ... case Some(rawId) => { // I need to return UserIdFactoryResult here Try(UUID.fromString(rawId)) .transform( success => Success(Right(this.apply(success.toString))), error => Success(Left(error)) ).get .... } } } ```
 But the problem is that this transformation returns an Either[Throwable, UserId] instead of UserIdFactoryResult...
 What should I do?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Suppose I start with this, with point on letter J:
  
Example 1
 * PROJECTS... * Inbox... 
 
 I want this
  
EXAMPLE 2 [EDIT: Actually, this is impossible with org-indent-mode on.]
 * PROJECTS... x <--- point here at space marked x * Inbox... 
 
 What's the standard way and/or the most efficient way to get there? Or alternatively, achieve this:
  
Example 3
 * PROJECTS... * x <--- point here at space marked x * Inbox... 
 
 I know that if I start with Example 1 and I press C-S-RET, I'll get this:
  
Example 4
 * PROJECTS... * TODO x <--- point here at space marked x * Inbox... 
 
 That's good enough for TODO's, but I'd like to do something similar for the other cases. But it's odd that it leaves a space there (why does it do that?). I'd rather it not, but I'll accept this standard behavior, for now, if that's just the way it works out-of-the-box. (I know I can change emacs to do whatever I want though.) Also, the C-S-RET behaves a little different if the point starts at the end of * Projects...x at space marked x. In that case, it creates something like this:
  
Example 5
 * PROJECTS... * TODO x <--- point here at space marked x * Inbox... 
 
 In Example 5, it creates a new TODO item under the last child entry of * PROJECTS, but leaving * PROJECTS otherwise folded. Isn't it a little odd to have an intermediate parent invisible? 
 Finally, does that last point position (marked x here:* Projects...x) have special meaning/purpose? Is there a name for that position?
 EDIT: I think some of my questions about the functionality of ellipses and spaces is probably related to this timely post: https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/t1r2wq/have_you_ever_wondered_how_orgmode_toggles_the/. Which, from a newbie perspective, is probably summed up as "Because reasons."

 Anyway, I installed Scalaz and now I've got a list to concatenate into a single value. Sounds easy enough, let's just use a Monoid.
 Based on fp-ts, I was expecting the append() function of the Monoid to have a signature like this:
 override def append(f1: String, f2: String): String 
 When, as you already know, it actually has a signature like this:
 override def append(f1: String, f2: => String): String 
 I'm not even sure what the type of the second argument is supposed to be, let alone how to use this to concatenate my list into a single value.
 Help would be appreciated. Thanks.

I just upgraded to The Archive 1.7.6 (202) and noticed that we can now "drag and drop" images into a zettle.  The image will automatically be copied to the media sub-folder within your ZK folder, the reference will be inserted into your zettel, and the image will appear - presto!
That is so much easier than copying the image to your media file and then typing the reference in your zettel.

I'd be interested to know if there are other interested in data visualisation out of scala code... It's young, and follows a different paradigm to some of the Prior Art.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 I've been using org-mode for writing articles for a while. And I recently tried RMarkdown. I am trying to decide which one to use in the future. 
 I really enjoy org-mode. The only problem for me is that since I do not do programming, I do not know any computer language. I have to copy and paste settings by other people for different purposes, such as spelling check, formatting, preview, etc. RMarkdown in RStudio sets up things for me and I can download some packages by others without any specific setup. 
 I also feel that I do not fully use amazing functions of org-mode. For example, while I really like the to-do list and agenda, I do not know how to seamlessly synchronize my calendar (Mac OS) and my org-mode agenda. Many of my meetings are scheduled by others sending me .ics files. I can just go to my calendar and click "accept" or "decline". Is there a way to automatically make the item appear in my org-mode agenda when I add items on my apple calendar? 
 Anyway, maybe too much information here. Just curious to see others' experience of using org-mode for academic writing.

 xwidget seems to disapear (but its only hidden) and when its hidden it always shows another buffer instead. How can I configure this to actually quit the buffer and delete the window?
 This is my function for splitting and showing the browser on the right.
 (defun mk/browser-split-window (url &optional new-window) "Create a new browser window to the right of the current one." (interactive) (let* ((ignore-window-parameters t) (dedicated-p (window-dedicated-p))) (delete-other-windows) (split-window-horizontally) (other-window 1) (xwidget-webkit-browse-url url))) 
 Looks nice - now lets close it using \"q\"
 Hmm not really what I wanted.
 My complete config can be found here: https://github.com/konrad1977/emacs
 And as a bonus I have another question:
 How do I setup emacs to always set focus to (other-window 1) when a new window is created?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I was playing around with diff-buffers and ediff-buffers. I had no idea what I was doing, and I ended up with my primary notes.org file containing highlighted sections, saved to disk. I didn't know how to get rid of this formatting, so I restored it from the backup notes.org~, as I had only made a minor change (thank goodness). Here's the two files, the original (restored), and the ediff highlighted file:
 https://i.imgur.com/K7340jK.png
 Now my questions are as follows:
  
I thought org files were visible text only files, editable in any other text editor. But it's clearly saving the highlight features with the text. How is it doing that? What is the format?
 
If I end up with something like this on the right again, how can I strip all the highlight formatting, so I get back to what's shown on the left?

 YES!!! me either!
 Let's get into it ;)
 Table of content:
  
org-mode visibility of headings
 text properties
 Why are we talking about text properties if the mechanism of outline-mode uses overlays?
 overlays, invisible overlay property, buffer-invisibility-spec 
 buffer-invisibility-spec equal to t
 buffer-invisibility-spec equal to nil
 buffer-invisibility-spec equal to ((foo) t)
 
 ellipsis and buffer-invisibility-spec equal to ((foo . t) t) 
 default ellipsis ...
 custom ellipsis modifying the display table
 
  
org-mode visibility of headings
 org-mode is built on top of outline-mode that is responsible of the visibility changes of the headings.

It organizes the APIs into categories nicely, so I can quickly find out the exact APIs that I want, and then I look up them inside Emacs using Help, Info, etc.
 But the page was gone last year (I can't remember the exact date), the content was gone, although the URL was still reachable. What a pity!
 Do you know why it was gone? I didn't find an alternative to it after that. If you know the maintainer or maintainers, would you like to tell him/her/them about the issue? Thanks!
 If you were also like me, the good news is that we can visit its backup on Wayback Machine, https://web.archive.org/web/20201202092534/https://wikemacs.org/wiki/Emacs_Lisp_Cheat_Sheet, thanks to the Internet Archive!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At the moment, GHC has some machinery for tracking (annotating and inferring) the roles of parameters to type constructors. Roles and their machinery do not appear to be first class, in that it is not possible to discuss the roles of parameters to higher kinded type variables. This is a bit annoying, because in the absence of the ability to discuss such things one has to explicitly carry around coercion dictionary baggage.
 The "role" of a parameter roughly encodes the sort of "equality functor" the type-level function is. Specifically, the role of some type constructor's parameter determines what kind of equivalence it needs as input in order to produce a representational equivalence as output. If it requires _, the parameter has a _:
  
definitional equality, nominal role
 representational equivalence, representational role
 codiscrete equivalence (any two things are equal), phantom role
  
So it seems to me that properly speaking, the role actually belongs to the -> in the kind of the type constructor in question. Namely we have three different variations:
  
haskell type Nominal :: Type -{NOM}-> Type data Nominal x where Nominal :: Nominal Int 
 haskell type Representational :: Type -{REP}-> Type data Representation x = Representational x 
 haskell type Phantom :: Type -{FAN}-> Type data Phantom x = Phantom 
  
Similar systems of inference, notation, "subtyping" etc. could be devised to the ones for linear function arrows (which occur at the type level), so that working with these things is not very painful. It might also make sense to think of "role polymorphism", although I personally haven't given this much thought.
 What do you folks think? Am I missing something obvious?
 EDIT: The Reddit editor ate half my post and I had to rewrite it, apologies to anyone who saw the truncated version.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to create a PoC literately programmed python project and cannot for the life of me figure out how to have LSP-based completion inside noweb blocks. There is a sort of pseudocode block with a few references to chunks that come later, and I would like to have completion while writing these chunks somehow. Editing the :noweb yes chunk of code using C-c ' does not seem to expand the noweb references at all, which is not ideal. The blocks themselves also don't have completion when I tangle the :noweb yes block to a file and use lsp-org.
 Both of those solutions feel like they should work, so it is possible I've run into a bug because I'm running gccemacs. Is this the case? Is it normal for noweb and lsp-based completion for python to just work inside of your org file?
 I'm very much hoping I'm just doing something wrong, as the potential of this style when writing code for high-turnover teams with mixed capabilities seems very high to me. I'm afraid it won't be possible to instigate such a culture change without code completion.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hej Hej,
 This [https://gitlab.com/OlMon/consult-flyspell] is a small package to collect all misspelled words in a buffer and display it with consult.
 This package was born because I wanted to have a nice display of all my mistakes. I know kinda sadistic...
 I tried the great package flycheck-aspell/flymake-aspell [https://github.com/leotaku/flycheck-aspell]. It has almost everything I need, but for my 11 year old notebook it was a little bit to much. Additionally I was not sure if I would only use aspell and not switch to hunspell at some day.
 In the consult issue "command wishlist" it is stated:
 "consult-flyspell, provided by see https://github.com/d12frosted/flyspell-correct, [...]"
 That is correct, flyspell-correct displays the correction in the minibuffer, consult-flyspell displays the misspelled words in the minibuffer.
 I actually use both packages and set the variable consult-flyspell-correct-function to flyspell-correct-at-point to jump to a word and correct it.
 Maybe it helps someone, or maybe I did something that already existed, then please let me know.
 Cheers,
 OlMon

 Is there a function, macro, or some other pattern to keep in mind to copy the behavior with several built-in Emacs functions? Or is it some built-in magic that I'm not going to really be privvy to?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Some time ago I created a very simple sbt plugin to generate arbitrary configuration files. It's pretty much a copy of sbt-github-actions. The only difference is that it is not limited to GitHub Actions configurations, but can generate all kinds of text files. The key feature is that the plugin is able to verify that the generated configs are up-to-date in CI (just like sbt-github-actions).
 Since I've noticed how incredibly useful this plugin has become for me, I thought I'd share it here to show it to a wider audience (:
 I tend to use it for deployment configs, generating dev environment Dockerfiles and unopinionated GitHub Actions configs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At some point in I think 2021, read-extended-command-predicate was added, which lets you filter what M-x shows you. One of the intended use cases is to prevent commands for one major mode from showing up when working in another major mode. It's nil by default, but you can (setq read-extended-command-predicate 'command-completion-default-include-p)... except for the fact that basically no package I can find actually uses this, either by using
 (defun foo () (declare (modes . (lisp-mode))) (interactive) (message "I only show up in some-mode")) 
 or by (put 'foo 'command-modes '(lisp-mode)). I'd like to go through all the commands whose names start with (say) python- and mark them as being python-mode commands. What's the easiest way to do that?
 PS, is there any downside to package authors doing this? The declare variation warns on older versions of emacs, but the put variation should work no matter what. I'm really surprised this has almost no adoption/conversation that I could find. Out of all the packages I have cloned locally, only transient uses it, and only vertico and other packages by the same author use the related completion-predicate property.

 This will open a new window where my autocomplete package, in this case yassnippet, can autocomplete base on key words. For example, while inside the editting source code mode, I can type "eq" and TAB and automatically a LaTex snippet for equation is inserted. 
 For my case, sometimes I need to use an export block, so #+begin_export latex and #+end_export. How can I autocomplete in this case? Obviously, org-edit-src-code does not work because it is not an "src" block but an "export" block. 
 Any input is appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Out of the box, calling org-store-link when point is on a headline displayed on an agenda view behaves as you would expect: it does much what it would have done had you called org-store-link from an org-mode buffer visiting the relevant file with point on the same headline. But if you set org-agenda-sticky to t , calling org-store-link from an agenda buffer gives the following error:
 user-error: No method for storing a link from this buffer 
 After digging around a bit I think I found the culprit: for the agenda relevant behavior of org-store-link to be activated, you need to be in a buffer with the name specified in org-agenda-buffer-name. On my end, org-agenda-buffer-name is set to *Org Agenda*, but when org-agenda-sticky is set to t, agenda buffers have a different name of the form *Org Agenda(VIEW)*, where VIEW is the key to the relevant agenda view (so, e.g. *Org Agenda(a)*).
 Now, if I set org-agenda-buffer-name to e.g. *Org Agenda(a)*, I get org-store-link to work as expected when visiting an agenda buffer with that name. But I do not seem to be able to use org-agenda-buffer-name to get Emacs to recognize an agenda buffer when org-agenda-sticky is set to t.
 Any ideas?

I've been using The Archive for about a year and a half and it has been a remarkable tool for me to organize my torrent of thoughts for a variety of projects. I especially love how I'm able to record my thoughts and surf through my notes without needing to take my fingers off the keyboard.
As I have gotten deeper into my research, I've found myself using LaTeX much more frequently, especially for mathematical purposes, and I'd imagine it will be necessary for other tasks as well. Does The Archive support LaTeX? If not, are there some workarounds for this to be possible? What other note-taking software is out there that has bi-directional linking and LaTeX support as well?

Reading from Cache
 Adding to Cache (With Expiration TIme)
 Updating Cache
  
Has someone done this before? Can someone point me to good resource on implementing the same? I tried to do it with a node server and it worked like a charm but while trying to do the same with Scala Play, I am still not getting good enough resources. Can someone help me and give me tips how to approach this to be time and speed efficient?

 I know there is the whitespace-cleanup-mode which does a okay job with the option to only do cleanup when the file was already clean, but i would like to go further and only do whitespace cleanup on the lines i have modified.
 anyone would know how to replicate this feature?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I created the package clean-kill-ring.el which solves a problem that I have long been annoyed with which is controlling what is allowed in the kill-ring.
 This package provides a clean-kill-ring-mode minor mode, that when active prevents any killed text that satisfies a predicate in clean-kill-ring-filters from entering the kill ring. By default the only active filter is string-blank-p to keep whitespace out of the kill ring.
 You can automatically remove duplicate items if you set clean-kill-ring-prevent-duplicates to a non-nil value.
 Hopefully some people find this useful.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm experimenting with a new form of inlining. Not sure if it has been done yet. The basic idea is to try to interpret the scala code and specialize at comp time, instead of traditionally inlining and constant folding. The following code failed to compile in my machine, reporting as  Main.scala:6:19 Maximal number of successive inlines (32) exceeded, Maybe this is caused by a recursive inline method? You can use -Xmax-inlines to change the limit. val result = fib(i) 
 ```scala inline def fib(a: Int): Int = if a <= 1 then a else fib(a - 1) + fib(a - 2)
 def timed_fib(i: Int): Unit = val begin = System.currentTimeMillis() val result = fib(i) val tm = System.currentTimeMillis() - begin println(s"fib(${i})=$result $tm ms")
 @main def main(): Unit = timed_fib(2) ```
 If we take the interpreter and specializing approach, inline is not needed ```scala def fib(a: Int): Int = if a <= 1 then a else fib(a - 1) + fib(a - 2)
 def timed_fib(i: Int): Unit = val begin = System.currentTimeMillis() val result = fib(i) val tm = System.currentTimeMillis() - begin println(s"fib(${i})=$result $tm ms")
 @main def main(): Unit = timed_fib(2)  will be optimized to scala def timed_fib_2: Uint = val begin = System.currentTimeMillis() val result = 1 val tm = System.currentTimeMillis() - begin println(s"fib(${i})=$result $tm ms")
 @main def main(): Unit = timed_fib_2 ```

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The built-in bibtex-mode provides a function bibtex-next-field which does what you'd expect: if we use "|" to represent point, calling bibtex-next-field from the following configuration: 
  @article{key, author = {D|oe, Jane}, title = {A paper}, ... 
 will take you to this configuration:
  @article{key, author = {D|oe, Jane}, title = {A paper|}, ... 
 I'm trying to define a bibtex-previous-field function that does the reverse, so I decided to look into the definition of bibtex-next-field, which is this:
 ``` (defun bibtex-next-field (begin &optional comma) "Move point to end of text of next BibTeX field or entry head. With prefix BEGIN non-nil, move point to its beginning. Optional arg COMMA is as inbibtex-enclosing-field'. It is t for interactive calls." (interactive (list current-prefix-arg t)) (let ((bounds (bibtex-find-text-internal t nil comma)) end-of-entry) (if (not bounds) (setq end-of-entry t) (goto-char (nth 3 bounds)) (if (assoc-string (car bounds) '("@String" "@Preamble") t) (setq end-of-entry t) ;; BibTeX key or field (if (looking-at ",[ \t\n]") (goto-char (match-end 0))) ;; end of entry (if (looking-at "[)}][ \t\n]") (setq end-of-entry t)))) (if (and end-of-entry (re-search-forward bibtex-any-entry-maybe-empty-head nil t)) (goto-char (match-beginning 0))) (bibtex-find-text begin nil bibtex-help-message)))
 ````
 Unfortunately, I'm having trouble parsing this. What is the expression end-of-entry doing? I thought let expressions would take the following form: 
  (let ((VAR-1 VALUE-1) (VAR-2 VALUE-2) ... (VAR-n VALUE-n)) BODY) 
 but the first argument of let in the definition of bibtex-next-field seems to have a different form: 
  ... (let ((bounds (bibtex-find-text-internal t nil comma)) end-of-entry) BODY ... 
 Any help making sense of this would be much appreciated.

I recently started a job where we use an exchange server and access it online via outlook webmail. The org-capture browser function doesn't work well for this because the link to the message is (1) not easily captured and (2) is not persistent, e.g., it changes when I move the message to a different folder
 So I started using mu4e again, but it appears that refiling does not seem to sync. When I refile messages in mu4e it somehow disappears and I can't find it in outlook, even though the message is in the correct folder in my maildir. Why would this be? 
 I made a test folder in outlook to see if that would sync and it did sync, and the folder appeared in my maildir
 I then made that folder the location of my refile function, and same thing happened, the message disappeared and is no longer visible in outlook. 
 
  
Any thoughts on why refiling messages makes them disappear? Is it just some exchange server setting that I can't get around, or is it an easy fix on my end? 
 Thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all,
 I'm using vhdl-mode a lot and just decided that it would be a great idea to include compiler vhdl-mode option into my workflow with Emacs. I have to say that I set custom file location for "Easy configuration" on Emacs. 
 (setq custom-file "~/.emacs.d/emacs-custom.el")
 (load custom-file)
 To select compiler in vhdl-mode there are two ways, and it is little bit confusing to me. I want to use Xilinx XST compiler. Let me explain.
 First, you can select compiler from drop-down menu. There are Compiler1 and Compiler2 options. If you tinker with these options, some text is saved to my emacs-custom.el file, but I can't see that something is configured there. To me it seems like it copied just to whole compilers list into that emacs-custom.el. Maybe it saves some options in other place too and I'm not aware of it?
 Second, which works, but its value is not saved anywhere! It looks like this. I have tried to put (vhdl-set-compiler "Xilinx XST")
 and it returned that error that function is void. If I do it manually by fallowing vhdl-mode drop-down menu, and then selecting "Xilinx XST" compiler, it works. But just in this emacs session. After the restart of emacs, I have to do it again manually :/ 
 my emacs-custom.el : https://pastebin.com/iaTQbK17
 my init.el : https://pastebin.com/4GNLJMQB
 Any help is appreciated :)

 So, I've been exploring ways of implementing "type-dependent"(i think this is the name) validations! But I just stepped into a doubt that is related to "scala-specific" knowledge.
 Lets imagine that I have the following error trait:
 scala sealed trait DomainError trait ValidationError extends DomainError 
 and I want to specify a generic interface for a given Id type that wraps a primitive! This is what I thought on writing:
 scala trait Id[ValueType] type Value val value: ValueType 
 First question: - Is this the right way of writing a trait which defines something like a ProductId that is, basically, Id[UUID]?
 Second Question: - How can I define the interface for the apply method which I should return something like Either[ValidationError[ProductId], ProductId]]?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[From TAPL by Pierce:
  
Kinds are built from a single atomic kind, written * and pronounced type, and a single constructor ?. They include, for example:
 * the kind of proper types (like Bool and Bool=>Bool)
 *=>* the kind of type operators (i.e., functions from proper types to proper types)
 *=>*=>* the kind of functions from proper types to type operators (i.e., two-argument operators)
 (*=>*)=>* the kind of functions from type operators to proper types
 Kinds, then, are the types of types. In essence, the system of kinds is a copy of the simply typed lambda-calculus, one level up.
  
If thinking of types as objects in a category, e.g. Hask in Haskell,
  
what is kind * in Haskell or in terms of category Hask? Is it exactly the set of all the types, i.e. the object set of Hask?
 
What is kind *=>* in Haskell or in terms of category Hask? Is it exactly the class Functor in Haskell?
 
What is kind *=>*=>* in Haskell or in terms of category Hask?
 
What is kind (*=>*)=>* in Haskell or in terms of category Hask? 
 
Are all the arrow kinds (*=>*, *=>*=>*, (*=>*)=>*, ...) exactly the classes defined by class in Haskell?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In my work often it happens that I get a call to provide immediate support. Only after the call register it under my Support Headline with a full description of the issue and update my org clock time accordingly. 
 As such, I would like to create an org capture template (or function) that does the following: 
 - request how much time has pass since I receive the call 
 - with this time, clock out of my current task with the time of when I receive the call
 - create a new heading under my *Support* heading and include a clock drawer already with the time I spent on the task. Fill new headline as I want (title, description, etc.) 
 - (optional) clock in again to the task I was working
 I almost got everything done, however it seems that calling =org-clock-out= from within the capture template makes it so that the new heading is not in the right place. 
 If someone has any ideas on how to achieve this let me know. Below you can see my capture template and function:
  ("cc" "Support" entry (file+headline "~/org/todos.org" "Support") "%(call-interactively #'custom/quick-support)" :empty-lines 1) (defun custom/quick-support (minutes-started) (interactive "NMinutes:") (let ((support-start-time (encode-time (decoded-time-add (decode-time) (make-decoded-time :minute (- minutes-started)))))) ;; If clocked in a task, stopped it when support started (org-clock-out nil t support-start-time) (concat "* %?\n :CLOCKING:\n CLOCK: " (format-time-string "[%Y-%m-%d %a %H:%M]" support-start-time) "--" ;; Insert dummy => and let Org calculate it afterwards (format-time-string "[%Y-%m-%d %a %H:%M]") " => \n:END:\n")))

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As the title says, I have two unrelated questions. I have been assigned to do a task to cover for someone. This largely entails copying details out of a template and pasting it into an excel doc. Due to the variety of the email responses, I copy a block from Outlook to an org file and format, then paste into Excel. For example, a person's name is two cells, I found it was quicker for me to put the first and last names on separate lines then copy, esp after I customized copy*.
 1- can I somehow copy the text, so if I copy multiple lines, it fills the cells correctly? Ex first name is column A, last in b.
 2- I have set up an org file, to dump this data, via capture, mostly so I can easily keep a log of when I enter due to an unrelated headache. I have a custom DONE keyword and associated it with a key, but more than often I accidentally have shift held, so org-todo quits. Is there a way to apply my keyword regardless if i press a or A for example? In org-capture, if I assigned a, but do A, we're told to try again. I am aware that allowing this could cause issues if I assign lower and upper to keywords.
 my function
  (defun me/kill-ring-save () "Adds to line to kill-ring if not marked, and puts a message in the minibuffer. If something is marked, that region is added." (interactive) (if (equal mark-active nil) (progn (kill-ring-save (point) (line-end-position)) (message "Copied the line!") ) (progn (kill-ring-save (point) (mark)) (message "Copied selected region!") ) ) )

I performed the U command just to see what it would mark, and it did not mark "org" with an I. But my current org version is 9.4.4, and the latest one is 9.5.2. Why didn't U mark my org for installation?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[From Haskell's specification,
  
Do expressions satisfy these identities, which may be used as a translation into the kernel, after eliminating empty stmts:
 do {e} = e do {e;stmts} = e >> do {stmts} do {p <- e; stmts} = let ok p = do {stmts} ok _ = fail "..." in e >>= ok do {let decls; stmts} = let decls in do {stmts} 
  
I often see that people wrote
 do {p <- e; stmts} = e >>= (\p -> do {stmts}) 
  
I was wondering when the shorten version works and when it doesn't? (Does it work if and only if e is return(e') for some e' that matches p?)
 
Can the one given in the specification be rewritten as a >>= expression, for example, still by lambda expression? (The specification gives a let expression containing a >>= expresssion, not exactly a >>= expression itself)
 
 Thanks.

 I want to try out Emacs and I want to set it up as a python IDE and play around with some other features (DOOM, evil-mode etc., Tramp mode) so I look up how to configure something and I am presented with this:
  
Let's start by configuring lsp-mode which is a client for LSP servers:
 (use-package lsp-mode :hook (prog-mode . lsp))
 (use-package lsp-ui)
  
Okay, great it's a piece of code. but am I supposed to copy/paste that code somewhere? run it? bask in it's glory? do I have to restart emacs?
 Also where in the Emacs for beginners tutorials does it explain what to do with such a configuration snippet? If you have a lot of configuration how do you organize it?
 If I need to find out what configuration options are available for a package (like tramp on windows, how do I tell it to use TortoiseGitPlink.exe instead of Plink.exe) how do I discover it?

 I'd like to write an embark function for the consult-ripgrep.
 This function can add the current file name to the search prompt.
 What I mean:
 The consult ripgrep prompt is: #whatilookfor
 and after the embark action the prompt is: #whatilookfor -- -g filename*.differentextension
 I can image that if we add this "-- -g filename*.differentextension" to the consult-history and I can reach it with M-p maybe it can be a different good solution 
 I would like to use it to search the string in the files with same name but different extensions.
 It would be useful under the angular development for me ...
 If you can send me an example where an embark function modify the consult prompt could be enough for me 
 sorry for the question but I have no a lot of time to write code for emacs ... :(

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 Sorry for the basic question. I was reading that both native compilation and pure gtk were both merged. I'm on fedora 35. What is the best way to install emacs with these features? Do I have to build it from source? And if so are there specific flags or options that need to be enabled for it to be compiled with those options enabled? or are they enabled by default now?
 Thanks!
 EDIT: I managed to build it from source using the following and it (mostly) works:
 Into a directory: git clone https://git.savannah.gnu.org/git/emacs.git
 Then ran: ./autogen.sh in that directory
 Then ran: ./configure --with-pgtk --with-native-compilation --with-mailutils
 It kept failing until I installed all the following additional packages with sudo dnf install:
  
autoconf (to run the ./autogen.sh command)
 texinfo (for the makeinfo requirement)
 gtk3-devel (for the pgtk requirement)
 libgccjit-devel (for the native-comp requirement)
 gnutls-devel (because it needed gnutls-devel)
 ncurses-devel (it needed something in this package but I forget what)
  
Then ran make (took a while) then sudo make install in the directory and it installed! Emacs 29 I believe to /usr/local/bin

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am trying to get this to work to immediately activate a defun that I just added to my init.el (instead of closing and reopening emacs). I thought eval-defun should work. Alternatively, C-x C-e worked fine. So first question is why doesn't this work, and a second question, I guess, is when should I use each version?
 I don't know if it matters, but my init.el indicates it's an "(Emacs-Lisp Eldoc)". Here's the function:
 ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;; ;; help with parens (show-paren-mode t) ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;; ;; emacs needs an unfill ;;; Stefan Monnier <foo at acm.org>. It is the opposite of fill-paragraph (defun unfill-paragraph (&optional region) "Takes a multi-line paragraph and makes it into a single line of text." (interactive (progn (barf-if-buffer-read-only) '(t))) (let ((fill-column (point-max)) ;; This would override `fill-column' if it's an integer. (emacs-lisp-docstring-fill-column t)) (fill-paragraph nil region))) ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;; ;; Some font choices (setq myfont "InputSerif") 
 With the point in or immediately after the defun, executing C-M-x aka M-x eval-defun prints "InputSerif" in the minibuffer.
 EDIT: Added extra context to my snippet, command above and below.

I have discovered zettelkasten(ing) a few weeks ago and it arrived at a perfect timing! I am reorganizing my whole “knowledge management” and my workflow.  As a dad of two small kids, the primary caretaker of a house and a phd candidate during pandemic times (I don’t know what went through my head to pursue that route), I highly need some effectivity.
I have started my own zettelkasten and I am trying at the same time to understand how the zettelkasten system works and most importantly how to make it most effective for me. And let’s be honest, I am really torn between analog and digital and see benefits in both. I like the tactile and sensory aspect of the analog, and I like the effectiveness of the digital, plus I learn a lot on software and programmes (thanks to you Forum, markdown has come to my knowledge and I am learning how to use it).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was wondering how to understand in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applicative_functor
  
Applicative functors are the programming equivalent of lax monoidal functors with tensorial strength in category theory.
  
In Haskell's, class Applicative is defined as
 class Functor f => Applicative f where pure::a->fa (<*>)::f(a->b)->fa->fb 
 A monoidal functor is defined in Mac Lane's book Category Theory for Working Mathematicians, on p164 in VII.1. Monoidal Categories 
  
A (strict) morphism of monoidal categories 
 T: (B, *, e, alpha, lambda, rho)->(B', *', e', alpha, lambda, rho), 
 is a functor T: B-B' such that, for all a, b, c, f, and g 
 T(a*b)=Ta *' Tb, T(f*g) = Tf *' Tg, Te=e', (10) T alpha_{a,b,c} = alpha'_{Ta, Tb, Tc}, T lambda_a = lambda'_{Ta}, T rho = rho'_{Ta}. (11) 
  
How can an instance of class Applicative be viewed as a lax monoidal functor? 
 What is the underlying monoidal category (B, *, e, alpha, lambda, rho) for an instance of Applicative in Haskell?
 What is "lax" here?
 Thanks.

 I know you can select a region and auto indent it by pressing C-M-\, however that doesn't seem to remove hanging braces even though my style is set to not have hanging braces.
 For example, if I highlight the following function and run auto indent
 test_function(void) { std::cout << "This is a test" << std::endl; } 
 I would like it to become 
 test_function(void){ std::cout << "This is a test" << std::endl; } 
 but it doesn't. Anyone know how to make emacs do this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was looking at using Flycheck today with lsp-mode, and I got a warning from lsp-mode. A quick google lead me to a github issue for lsp-mode that said it's a common problem and that Flycheck was going to release a new version that fixed it. There was linked issue from that one to a github issue on Flycheck's repo about releasing said version from 2020, with no actual traction on finishing the release.
 There haven't been any commits to master since August 2021, regardless of the fact that there are 45 open pull requests, and users requesting that a new release be cut for 2 years. Their CI jobs don't run anymore because they're linked to travis-ci.org which has been in read-only mode since July 2021 and no longer accepts new build jobs.
 Is Flycheck dead? Are people just using snapshots from the repo to make it work? Is there a forked version someone is actually mantaining?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I am having trouble with my org-mode. Whenever I have a heading, like "* This is a heading" and press RET, I used to be brought to a newline, and moved inwards 3 characters. However, when I press RET currently, under a heading such as in this example, point is not moved, and remains at 0 instead of being moved to 3. Interestingly, when I am in auto-fill-mode, when the text begins to wrap around, it will indent appropriately. I have also found that C-o also does not indent, and is effectively the same as C-j
 I am not sure what has changed, but I am in wayland currently, and I don't think that should have and impact on expected performance, but I would never know.
 I tried org-indent-mode to see if that is what I was missing, but that seems to be doing something else entirely.
 ​
 EDIT: fixed, i had to set org-adapt-indentation
 https://orgmode.org/manual/Hard-indentation.html#DOCF150
 ​
 EDIT2: This change does not seem to be working out, actually. I thought it would, but I still get put at 0 instead of 3 spaces when I use RET under a headline.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Due to syntactic flexibility with do notation, I really can't see a single language paradigm that Haskell can't emulate. While Prelude gets a lot of shit, it's so minimal and unopinionated that it really encourages creating language features as libraries. With QuasiQuoters you can take this to a logical extreme, convincing the compiler to compile whatever you want essentially. It seems to take very little convincing to get the language to do anything you want in the way you want as long as it's logically well formed.
 Personally as someone who loves programming language design it's really incredible, if there's a feature in another language that I want to try, I don't have to switch languages, I can find a package or just stub out an implementation in a weekend. I've heard this used as a point against Haskell however, because it lets you work with very bizzare computational models and can make a code base feel kind of disjointed. Personally, I don't buy that, while Haskell does have modules that let you differ from the norm, the norm tends to be the easiest option. You CAN have Alan Kay style objects, you CAN have prolog style logic programming, but why would you when the language is still so effective without them. Of course, eDSLs are a thing too, tho they're less hot pluggable language features and more an incredibly nice design pattern that arises naturally from the language design unless they're designed to operate more generically.
 Anyway, Haskell is cool and I wanted to talk about it, but I'm sure I'm preaching to the choir here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am making a Haskell application that uses a lot of libraries, mostly for things like parsing (megaparsec, aeson, etc) and eventually some RPC or other inter-process library. I have noticed that many of these libraries will return some kind of "Result" type for actions that can fail, often an Either String a or Maybe a or their own custom Result a type. I find it somewhat vexing how these different error types cannot mix because they carry different information, and I would like to be able to propagate them to a higher level in my program where the errors can be handled properly.
 To this end I have added a monadic Result type for my own application that is roughly data Result a = Valid a | Invalid Error where Error is my own error sum type that can represent any external error that the program might have to handle. Result has the obvious Functor, Applicative, and Monad instances, and I use it to wrap most actions that can fail including reading and writing files, parsing, validating user input, and so on.
 Is this a good approach? It seems a little unwieldy to set up so many wrapper functions, but it pays off when I can handle the errors so much more smoothly at the top level. Is there some better method I am missing?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Anyone have a working emacs config for Svelte that they can share? I’ve enabled svelte-mode and installed the svelte-ls lsp server, but things like lsp-find-definition just error out and ask me to check lsp-describe-server, which shows that the server is alive, but not much else. Any tips? I have to explore a codebase, and being able to quickly follow definitions is key.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone,
 I'm curious to see how you plan your long term goals with org-mode. I'm interested in workflows and your thoughts.
 In general, I'm pretty successful managing my day to day with org-mode:
  
I have a project list 
 each project is divided into subtasks
  
I push the projects along by executing tasks and reviewing my projects relatively regularly. It's a functional system. In general things don't fall through the cracks.
 However, I feel like most of my planning is short term. This is where "tactical vs strategic" in the title comes from. I'm having trouble elaborating on what I really mean, here.
 Do you have long term goals, if so how do you work with them in org mode?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, thought I'd share a way to control the volume of EMMS using MPV as a backend. I couldn't find any solutions on the net, and this took quite a bit of trial and error so hopefully this will save you some pain. 
  (defvar emms-player-mpv-volume 100) (defun emms-player-mpv-get-volume () "Sets `emms-player-mpv-volume' to the current volume value and sends a message of the current volume status." (emms-player-mpv-cmd '(get_property volume) #'(lambda (vol err) (unless err (let ((vol (truncate vol))) (setq emms-player-mpv-volume vol) (message "Music volume: %s%%" vol)))))) (defun emms-player-mpv-raise-volume (&optional amount) (interactive) (let* ((amount (or amount 10)) (new-volume (+ emms-player-mpv-volume amount))) (if (> new-volume 100) (emms-player-mpv-cmd '(set_property volume 100)) (emms-player-mpv-cmd `(add volume ,amount)))) (emms-player-mpv-get-volume)) (defun emms-player-mpv-lower-volume (&optional amount) (interactive) (emms-player-mpv-cmd `(add volume ,(- (or amount '10)))) (emms-player-mpv-get-volume)) 
 For reference my emms-player-mpv-parameters is set to '("--quiet" "--really-quiet" "--no-audio-display" "--force-window=no" "--vo=null" "--no-resume-playback")

 From my one semester of Haskell in university I know the basic concepts, but I now want to write a full backend in Haskell.
 I have been using Kotlins Flows for quite a while, and I am looking for something similar in Haskell. Specifically I want to be able to notify other threads about changes, so they can react to them, but not in an active waiting way. In Kotlin I would use a StateFlow or a SharedFlow for this. I've seen the pipes library which looks very similar, but I couldn't figure out to use it in a way, where I have to update a value in one place and all threads are notified about it.
 Probably I am still thinking too much in an imperative way, but maybe you can help me go into the right direction. Thank you for your help.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been spending hours trying to figure this out, but was unable to find anything online with any working examples of what I'm looking for.
 ​
 What I want to do is have one of my Akka-HTTP routes return a response like this:
 [ { name: "test", age: 24 }, { name: "test 2", age: 21 } ] 
 The issue is that the spray-json and akka tutorials only show you how to return a response like this:
 { users: [ { name: "test", age: 24 }, { name: "test 2", age: 21 } ] } 
 While messing around, I tried creating a simple route an an immutable sequence of users like so
 case class User(name: String, age: Int) // ... val usersTest = Seq(User("test, 24), User("test 2", 21)) val routes: Route = { ... route code get { // Should return an array of the users complete(usersTest) } } 
 But the above code throws the following error:
 type mismatch; found : Seq[User] required: akka.http.scaladsl.marshalling.ToResponseMarshallable 
 I'm having a hard time following why that error is being thrown when I have my jsonFormats defined already:
 implicit val userJsonFormat = jsonFormat2(User) 
 ​
 How can I make the route respond with a simple JSON array of the users? I don't want to respond with an object containing a users array, I want the endpoint to respond with an array of the users.
 ​
 Any help is much appreciated!
 Edit: I feel dumb. Thanks for the help!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I am new to Org, so I may have missed something obvious but, reading the Quick start guide or the documentation, I am not sure to understand how export is supposed to work in regards to headings. Quoting the Quick start Guide:
  
Lines that start with an asterisk * are headings. 
 A single * denotes a 1st-level heading, ** denotes a 2nd-level heading, etc.
  
So far, everything is clear. We have headings, with levels. Fine. Where I stop following is when I export, say to a html buffer (C-c C-e h H) every heading level has been decreased: one star headings are tagged as h2 and two stars as h3. Here, on a very basic test file: 
 https://preview.redd.it/p9pbaypvm8j81.png?width=1165&format=png&auto=webp&s=23832603cda8cec5ff07bd711f661d8fe71f2902
 Since I am rather new to Org and to Emacs, I imagined I had some issue with my Org configuration or that I screwed up something elsewhere in Emacs, as I so often do. So I tried on a clean install (no ~/.emacs.d, no init.el) and got the same result, on a Debian 11 machine btw. 
 What's bugging me is that I can't find mention of this in the doc. 
 Could you tell me if it is the expected behavior? And if so, is there a way to tell Org to preserve the original heading levels?
 Thank you :)

The inclusion of the zettelkasten into the lexicon of contemporary productivity scenes, many of which view note-taking systems through the lens of task and project management, has led to confusion as to what a zettelkasten is and for what it can be used. This confusion becomes particularly apparent when comparing zettelkasten to other note-taking methodologies, where the zettelkasten is seen as an advanced (and sometimes outdated) way to store and retrieve notes. I'd like to argue that the zettelkasten should not be considered within the lineage of agnostic note-storing systems and apps, but rather as something else entirely: a note-making and note-linking me…]]></summary>

 I imagine different semigroups have different implementations of append. However, while the compiler can know it'll have to deal with some manner of semigroup, it cannot know ahead of time what each member may be. How is the correct function ultimately determined? Is there some runtime check with the equivalent of typeof/instanceof which decides the correct function?
 I guess a related question is what happens in practice if data don't match their type? For example, if I ask a database for data, expecting a sequence of integers, but a cosmic ray conspires to ruin my day, and I end up getting garbage. Obviously this is a runtime error, but how can I reason about it or deal with it?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We have just released new versions of both Indigo (game engine) and Tyrian (Elm-like web framework). They've been release together because they now work together!
 As well as lots of other improvements, you are now able to build a web app in Tyrian that natively launches and communicates with Indigo web games as first class citizens, from within the same Scala codebase.
 The motivating use case was for people who wanted to use Indigo to render their games, but who also wanted a slick, responsive HTML5 based UI to drive it.
 Please note that both minor releases follow an unannounced major release a week ago, so do check out the release notes for both. 
 Indigo 0.12.1 - https://indigoengine.io/
 https://github.com/PurpleKingdomGames/indigo/releases/tag/v0.12.0
 https://github.com/PurpleKingdomGames/indigo/releases/tag/v0.12.1
 Tyrian 0.3.1 - http://tyrian.indigoengine.io/
 https://github.com/PurpleKingdomGames/tyrian/releases/tag/v0.3.0
 https://github.com/PurpleKingdomGames/tyrian/releases/tag/v0.3.1
 ​
 A massive thank you to all the wonderful people who have sponsored us, contributed code, reviewed PR's, written/proof read docs, raised issues, discussed solutions, or bravely shared their work in progress games and apps! You make it all worth while. 😊

 I don't have csharp-mode hooks enabled in my dot emacs, so I load a ".cs" file, and then type "M-x csharp-mode". I get this error:
 Symbol’s chain of function indirections contains a loop: R-mode 
 Syntax highlighting does NOT occur (except for strings and comments, for some reason). However, the mode line does say that csharp-mode IS activated for the file. 
 I don't understand why R-mode is involved with this process at all. I do have ESS installed.
 Here is the information for the package:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi!
 I attempt to gather all ideas/approaches that were in usage to manage app dependencies. As far as I see there are two survivors nowadays: - mix of constructors/implicits in Tagless Final world - "Reader on steroids" represented by ZIO (Reader channel, Has[T], and ZLayer) and cats-mtl (Ask[F, T] feature) (thanks to u/LuciaDenniard for bringing the second option)
 I want to write a note with a review of which things were in usage but were washed out.
 The roster I have:
  
Dependency rejection. Just an idea to push any IO to the edges and not mix with logic.
 Dependency injection frameworks (Guice-like)
 Cake pattern.
 Dependency parameterization (dependencies as function parameters).
 Reader monad (as is)
 
 Resources I found useful: - "Readers vs Constructors: Dependency Injection showdown" and "Reader & Constructor-based Dependency Injection - friend or foe?" by u/adamw1pl - "Dependency Injection in Functional Programming" Gist by Gabriel Volpe - Cake antipattern by Mateusz Kubuszok - "Six approaches to dependency injection" from "F# for Fun and Profit" - "Dependency rejection" and "Partial application is dependency injection" by Mark Seemann
 I'll be grateful for any additional resources and/or points I've missed.
 Thank you!

But it seems to me that even if I replaced f with g :: (a,b) then g is still ambiguous (again, if I have multiple instances). So why is there that restriction?
 I am aware of FunctionalDependencies, but it seems to me that it shouldn't be required that b is uniquely determined by a. Am I missing something?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When you have a high level language it seams easier to desugar it to a small core language when type checking. However I don't understand how type errors can then be reversed back to the original syntax. What are known strategies for doing this? It seems like you would have to litter your core AST with annotations of some kind, is this what most people do?
 I remember reading somewhere that haskell implements the typechecker closer to the original syntax because then it is easier to relate errors to the original source. However there is still some desugaring that occurs, and I'm wondering if there is a sweet spot in balancing desugaring vs tracking original source?

Is this the expected behaviour?
 Can I trim this down to one Org version, preferably the 9.5.2 and the generally speaking the most recent one?
 If this is the expected behaviour what is the purpose of each Org version? I find it strange that I cannot use the most recent stable version but still need it for dependencies.

Completed the initial processing of notes from the biography of John Cage Where The Heart Beats 202107261132.
Spent too much time fretting about the Science Profile assignment interview that never happened.
Looked again at Zettlr then settled back into The Archive.
This Week
I'll add deep links and atomize Where The Heart Beats 202107261132. I'll start a second refactoring.

Work in Keyboard Maestro, which just released version 10!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all,
I recently discovered the Zettelkasten system and thought it seemed a disciplinary and constructive tool for someone who makes connections between ideas all day long but doesn't write them down (like me). I've gotten as far as downloading Obsidian, reading the first chapter of a book called "The Bitcoin Standard," writing fleeting notes, and then polishing the relevant ones into literature notes. What repeatedly evades my understanding, however, is the nature of links.
I do not know when or how to use links. For example, if I have a note that defines the economic term "coincidence of wants," and I have another note discussing how "indirect exchange enables coincidence of wants in a diverse economy," should I: reference "coincidence" inside "indirect exchange"; reference "indirect exchange" in "coincidence"; do both of those; not link them at all but tag both notes with "coincidence of wants" and find them when I do the color-coded tag search?
And then there's the matter of linking two (seemingly) unrelated ideas. Do they get linked to each other, and then to a third note of the new idea they inspire? Both notes separately linked to the third?
Help is appreciated.]]></summary>

 Binding globally, every one of these works except C-k. It will NOT move to the upper window in either Eshell or term, normal mode or no. I tried to use bind* from use-package, I tried general, I tried so many things I've lost count, but I can't use C-k for the real shell or the Eshell. Why is this, and is there a sane way around it? For now I've settled down on using arrows:
  (general-define-key :states 'normal "<left>" 'windmove-left "<right>" 'windmove-right "<down>" 'windmove-down "<up>" 'windmove-up) 
 But I am not happy about it. Doubly so because I just don't understand why no override works.

 ```
 +begin_src bash :async t
 for i in $(seq 10); do echo $i && sleep 0.1 done

 I have a pretty basic need to view the stdout of this process (i.e. view numbers from 1 to 10 printed out to an external buffer, much like async-shell-command), not only the final result.
 Is this feasible to do this? If this were feasible it would be convenient to view the process of my long-running command. And I can totally live free from the terminal.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cross post from https://fillian.me/code/bongo-retag/
 ​
 bongo is a package for listening to music within Emacs.
 I keep all my music on my computer with filenames readable by bongo like this:
 Artist - Album - Track Num - Song Name.mp3
 ​
 I like having all the metadata stored in the filename instead of in internal ID3 tags for a few reasons:
  
filenames are easy to change
 everything is visible at a glance
 it stops me from spending too much time re-tagging and organizing my library
  
​
 The problem is that when I sync my music library to my phone using Syncthing, the music app I use doesn't read the metadata from the filename - it uses the standard ID3 tags.
 ​
 My solution was to write a small script which reads metadata from the filename and overwrites the internal ID3 tags to match.
 Whenever I add new music to my library, I'll run this script and then I'll be able to browse easily on my phone. The source of truth for metadata will always be the filename.
 ​
 The script is written in Python and requires a library called eyeD3
 You can find the it here
 Pass the script a directory and it will re-tag all the .mp3 files inside and in any sub-directories.
 ​
 It's nice to have album cover images when listening on my phone, so the script will overwrite a cover image if there is a file that matches Artist - Album.jpg in the same directory as the mp3.

 1. a backend (lsp-mode in his case)
 2. a frontend (typescript-mode in his case)
 3. a language server (ts-ls in his case)
 So I was wondering if this scheme holds true even for c/c++, if so, what packages for these three "categories" do I need?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm writing a program that transcodes financial statements into a ledger. In that program I have types representing different activities:
 haskell data Withdrawal = Withdrawal { wTarget :: !Text, wAmount :: !Cash, wBalance :: !Cash } data Fee = { fFee :: !Cash, fBalance :: !Cash } -- many more 
 I use those types, because I have functions that are transaction-type specific.
 I also wanted to write an activity parser that translates CSV records into those types, so I created an Activity sum type:
 ```haskell data Activity = ActivityFee Fee | ActivityWithdrawal Withdrawal | -- ...
 parseActivity :: CsvRecord -> Activity ```
 That Activity is quite boilerplate'y. Having to have a new Activity* constructor for a new activity type is slightly cumbersome.
 Is there a more idiomatic or better design pattern for this problem? Was it C++, std::variant would be convenient, because adding a new activity type wouldn't entail adding a new boilerplate constructor.
 I've considered type-classes, but the problem with them is that they are not closed and I can't pattern match to create a function like applyActivity :: Activity -> Wallet -> Wallet. I see that I could make applyActivity into a function of an Activity class, but then problem is that this solution is only straightforward if only one argument is using this pattern. If we had two arguments like foo :: (ClassOne a, ClassTwo b) => a -> b -> c, then it's not clear to which class foo should belong.

 recently I've been playing with org-element and org-export.
 Specifically, I was interested in the mechanism of the org exporter system and its flexibility.
 The goal of this post is to get you started with the creation of org backends.
 To do so, we build an org backend that:
  
keeps only bold elements,
 surrounds bold elements with *** before and after,
 surrounds paragraph elements with :: before and after,
 surrounds section elements with <-- before and --> after (removing the last newline).
  
We call it onlybold.
 Before, we start, if you are interested, I recommend you to read in org-mode's source code the following files:
  
lisp/ox.el,

 I'm trying to teach someone what a function is conceptually beyond just (a -> b), so that they can recognize it when they see it in any context, regardless of language. I have been trying to come up with a type, or a diagram, to explain it.
 The essential pieces I see for a function are a parameter assignment, a computation, and a return. The type at the top is meant to capture these and the diagram for this would be a square.
 I also think that this can be used to define an arrow, except the first argument would be an identity on the input, the second the arrow, and the third argument would be an identity on the output.
 This is how I sketch functions and arrows when I imagine them but I don't know if anyone else's imagination agrees.

 The shared config, extends some notions and creates new ones (some left as a kind-of challenge in the mentioned article):
 ​
 - Region actions: actions that act in an arbitrary not visible region created with avy selections (copy, yank, kill, teleport). First you mark the initial point of the region with an action, then you execute a region action on the other end of the region.
 - Quick char commands: skip the initial filtering step of an Avy command pre-filtering a character. For example I use this in emacs-lisp mode to auto filter open parenthesis with a key binding, this is very useful as actions act on Sexp.
 - Auto actions: enable the automatic execution of an avy action on a selected candidate
 - Compound actions and commands: link several avy interactions in a single command or action using auto actions. This is useful for example for region actions, instead of executing two Avy commands to first mark the start of the region with a command and then select and act on the end of the region; you only execute a command that integrates two Avy interactions, the first one auto applies the mark action, then you select the action and element at the end of the region. I also use this for creating a replace action, combining kill and yank actions in one action.
 ​
 I hope this results useful for someone.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Org-view-mode is now available for installation from Melpa. 
 Since my last post in this Reddit, it has got some new features, of which probably the most interesting is to remove read-only status, but still keep org markup hidden. It is meant for simple edits like fix a spelling mistake or add/remove a word or two. For bigger edits, drop back into org-mode. There are some other minor additions, hiding some agenda keywords and ellipses. The last one is not really recommended, but it can be useful only in some very special cases.
 For the usage info, check the README file in the Github repository.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dear community,
 I'm looking for a comparison of the various note-taking-packages implementing the Zettelkasten-method. I don't want to build a second brain or create a personal wiki, instead I want to capture and link ideas for researching and writing.
 Using org, I'm naturally drawn to org-roam, however, I dislike the bulk of dependencies and its complexity stemming. Furthermore, I dislike, that I can't get a textual overview of a subset of notes belonging together (using a webserver-solution like org-roam-ui is not what I want here). Looking at the new zk-package, I want to note that I like its simple and clean approach, but I dislike, certain design decisions, like using spaces in file names and the fact, that it doesn't integrate deeply in the org-ecosystem, e.g. not utilizizing org-IDs. The last point is the biggest downside imho. While one could hack on the codebase to change this, another drawback seems to be that it is not really mature and doesn't seem to have a large userbase. 
 Currently, I'm try out both of these very different options, but I can't really decide for on or the other, since both have different strengths and downsides. Therefore, I want ask for your opinions and experience with implementing the Zettelkasten-method (or a personalized derivation of it). Which horse should I put?
 Thanks in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey guys.
 I'm trying to get started with Reflex/Obelisk as we have a few quite simple UI use-cases that would benefit highly from sharing code between the front-end and back-end.
 However, struggling to get one thing working - HLS.
 Setting up an Obelisk project was actually remarkably easy.
 ob shell, ob run and ob watch work perfectly.
 However, when I open up VS code from within the nix-shell hls is failing with some very weird errors.
  Unexpected usage error can't load .so/.DLL for: /nix/store/jc9zqp241vz5ziwh0smls0sl1sf6h7np-ghc-8.6.5/lib/ghc-8.6.5/ghc-prim-0.5.3/libHSghc-prim-0.5.3-ghc8.6.5.so (/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libm.so.6: version `GLIBC_2.29' not found (required by /nix/store/jc9zqp241vz5ziwh0smls0sl1sf6h7np-ghc-8.6.5/lib/ghc-8.6.5/ghc-prim-0.5.3/libHSghc-prim-0.5.3-ghc8.6.5.so)) typecheck 
 I assume this is because it's reaching for my local installation of haskell-language-server (it's pointed to the 8.6.5 version, so that's not the issue), but absolutely no idea how to approach this.
 Is there some working repository example or a tutorial for IDE integration that doesn't require you to know Nix in order to make any sense of it?

 Does anyone know of a solution or why this is happening?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, I am back with my persistent request to you fellow Scala users to "Star" some projects on Github.
 Why ? 
 Because the "Github Stars" have somehow evolved into the easiest available indicator of popularity and trustworthyness of a project.
 And yes, I know that "Github Stars" are not really a good indicator of quality and trust. And they were just meant to be like a bookmark.
 But probably even the Github guys did not foresee the open-source explosion which took place in last 5-6 years and Github became the de-facto home for opensource community. With the rise of "the like/subscribe culture" of Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn during these times, our community was also craving for that "like/follow/subscribe" button, and they found the "Star button".
 Yes, it is a bad indicator but an indicator none the less.
 ​
 So, please take few seconds of your time to hit that "like/follow/subscribe". It might just help in giving outsiders more confidence in our excellant ecosystem.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[EDIT: THIS HAS BEEN ANSWERED, THANKS!
 I'm a newbie. From: https://orgmode.org/manual/Literal-Examples.html
 It says the following:
 You must insert a comma right before lines starting with either ‘*’, ‘,*’, ‘#+’ or ‘,#+’ 
 Is this a mistake in the text? Why would I need to put a comma before a line starting with ,*? I'd end up with ,,*.
 Then they give the following example:
 #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE ,* I am no real headline #+END_EXAMPLE 
 But wouldn't it be sufficient without the begin end?
 ;; This will work too ,* I am no real headline 
 For that matter, wouldn't it be sufficient to have just about any character there, including a space? 
 ;; This will work too * I am no real headline 
 EDIT: It just occurred to me that I'm thinking mainly in terms of how emacs is parsing and presenting the information within the editor as I type, but there might be other issues with the system processing the text, such as for agendas, exporting, etc.

 This is a screen shot from part of my FastMail IMAP email inbox in Mu4e.
 Lots of inbox email headers, each crossed out, but still listed in the inbox.
 All of these emails have been archived or moved via the MacOS Mail program, or iOS Mail app but they show up like this here, which means that they have been trashed from Mu4e's perspective.
 I'm trying to work out how to make my Mu4e display consistent with what iPhone or Mac Mail shows me. I.E. If I archive an email in iOS Mail, the reference to it is no longer displayed in Mu4e so that I don't have to do everything twice.
 I have followed this setup pretty much exactly but applied to FastMail.
 Can somebody point in the right direction please?

 Any suggestions will be greatly appreciated. Ideally I wanna get GHC for ppc into Macports, but if I manage to build it locally, I can open a PR.

In addition to the part included in the example, I found this: https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/38184/org-mode-ignore-heading-when-exporting-to-latex and added this to my config: (require 'ox-extra) (ox-extras-activate '(ignore-headlines)) and I added titletoc to my default packages as well. This indicates ‏‏‎ that titletoc has to be included before the hyperref package. This is what my packages setup looks like: (setq org-latex-default-packages-alist '(("rm" "roboto" t) ("defaultsans" "lato" t) ("" "paracol" t) ("" "titletoc" t))) There's no reference to the hyperref package anywhere in the file, but the output file indicates that package hyperref has indeed been loaded. Could the issue be that titletoc is not loading before hyperref, and if so, how can I make it do that? If that is not the issue, any ideas on what troubleshooting I can try next? Thanks all!

 I think Persistent-odbc is the only version that can work with MSSQL, but persistent-odbc doesn't pair with newer versions of Persistent as Persistent updated its datatypes. I thought selda was neat, but its DB language metatypes (I don't know if that's the right name) are in a closed data type rather than an open typeclass declaration. MSSQL has many database column types so having type class declarations of the translation DB language metatype would allow for more flexibility for the ORM to handle multiple databases.
 I'm going to try to rewrite selda's types to handle extensible column definitions.

After a bit, I came up with:  (>=>) :: (a -> m b) -> (b -> m c) -> (a -> m c) (>>=) :: m a -> (a -> m b) -> m b ma >>= f = ((\_ -> ma) >=> f) id -- apply to it a junk value 
 Since the result of applying >=> returns a function, I need to call the function with a junk value to make it return just m b . Was I correct in my approach? Thank you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When testing the basic functionality of my actors, my receiveMessage() event on my test probe is timing out, because the probe isn't listening for messages on the actor that I've spawned.
 ​
 For some context, I have 2 actors
  
A TaskManager actor
 A Session actor
  
My TaskManager actor has 2 commands:
  
CreateSession(id) - This spawns a new Session actor
 SessionCreated(id, ref) - When a Session actor is spawned, it sends the SessionCreated message back to the TaskManager so that I can store the ref of the session (and perform other stuff)
  
Here's where I'm running into the issue. I can't seem to figure out how to write a test to listen for messages coming back to the TaskManager actor that I spawned. When running the test, it times out waiting for the receiveMessage() event.
 Here's my test code:
  "Task Manager" must { "be able to create sessions and receive a reply from the session when its created" in { val taskManager = spawn(TaskManager()) val sessionProbe = createTestProbe[SessionCreated]() taskManager ! CreateSession("session1") val reply = sessionProbe.receiveMessage() // ^^ times out } } 
 I've been searching the docs and Googling everywhere, but I can't seem to find any documentation on how to listen for a message that should come back to an Actor that was spawned in the test.
 ​
 I've tried adding a new parameter to the CreateSession message to supply the probe ref, but then the probe receives the message instead of the taskManager actor, and thus the taskManager won't complete the changes that I need to test subsequently. I do know that the taskManager value does have a ref, but it doesn't have a receiveMessage method, so I'm stumped here.
 ​
 Any help is appreciated! Sorry for the noob question :-)

 I tried Udemy, but there doesn't seem to be anything useful on there.
 I am rather limited in terms of free time, having young children and a busy career.

 I have a few years of Java experience, so am well familiar with basic concepts.

While figuring out of vim was what I wanted I kept seeing these "vim vs emacs" yt videos and articles, which got me to check out emacs, which at the time looked very similar to vim (to my "mouse focused gui"-using eyes). After some digging i found distro tubes video on doom emacs which really sold me, but here's the issue: although it's relatively easy to find content telling you why to use emacs, there really doesn't seem to be any content telling you how to use emacs. 
 I really feel like I've walked into a car showroom, been shown this cool, futuristic car with no visible doors or windows. But as soon as I said "cool, how do I get into it, so I can test drive it?" The salesman just started starting blankly at me as if I'm the weirdo for not already knowing. 
 This post was mainly to express my woes, but I am very open to being directed to resources on how to get started, especially seeing it up for c# and python.

 So Command + V in iTerm2 is the paste action.
 However, I tried looking in the settings but am unaware of how to remap the default paste option since I swap a few keys on my Emacs setup on MacOS.
 Related swaps:
 Caps --> Control
 Option --> Control
 Is it possible to nuke the default Command + V 'paste' keybinding in iTerm2 for Emacs?
 This interferes with normal Emacs keybindings since Command + V on my setup on normal Emacs on MacOS usually advances the screen by 1 screenful.

CONTEXT
#Zettelkasten-method #cognitive-overload #quick-revision
I am relatively new to Zettelkasten (but have come across it earlier) and have just begun using Zettlr. I was trying to figure out whether for my use case, the method of Zettelkasten (which fascinates me) would be a good idea.
Previous experience suggests it is risky. I got hooked on Org-mode and Spacemacs spending time on setting it up when I had a deadline approaching. When I finally realised I was out of time, I quickly turned to drafting my work in Textedit (Mac) and polishing it up in Word for the final PDF submission. This was efficient given time crunch, familiarity with tools etc. and worked well for a shorter piece.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I'm writing some functionality in elisp which only works when I step through the expressions using Edebug and "space" but it fails when running in a regular manner. I know where the script fails in terms of a specific line, I just don't know of a mechanism in which the outcome is different due to stepping vs. regular run. Here is the code:
 (defun df/cite () (interactive) (defvar df/cite-title "") (defvar df/cite-buffer (current-buffer)) (org-ref-insert-cite-link) (org-ref-open-citation-at-point) (setq df/cite-title (bibtex-autokey-get-field "title" bibtex-autokey-titleword-change-strings)) (switch-to-buffer df/cite-buffer) (end-of-visual-line) (backward-char) (insert (format "[%s]" df/cite-title)) (end-of-visual-line)) 
 The code lets you insert an org-ref citation and uses the article's title (from the bibtex) entry as the org link description. The script works line by line in edebug but fails as a whole on the line running "open-citation-at-point". Not sure why.

So the algorithm would add a node and for each node two empty lists that denote it's two subtrees. However, I am stuck at initializing a BST in the first place. So when I insert a number into an empty BST:
 insert 5 [] 
 it would return a list like so:
 [5, [], []] 
 This is what I have:
 insert x lis = if null lis then [x, [], []] else undefined --for now 
 I thought the function declaration would have to be:
 insert :: Integer -> [Integer] -> [Integer] 
 But that doesn't work. If you know how to solve this, I would also appreciate reference material where these things are covered. I am struggling to find relevant documentation.

I can get ipywidgets to run, but instead of it displaying a browser widget in emacs/ein, it only displays a variable=value of the widget hat I'm trying to render?
 Any tips to fix this browser widget issue in emacs/emacs-ipython-notbook(or jupyter-emacs as well)?
  
I'm very happy with using emacs-ipython-notebook and and jupyter-emacs in emacs, but, the last thing that I need to get working is browser widgets, then I should be good to go with python/jupyter projects in emacs.

 Today, though, I'm trying to install the yesod bin following the Yesod quickstart guide, and not having any luck. (I'm in a Rosetta terminal and adding --arch x86_64 to stack commands.)
 The error occurs at the step of installing the yesod command line tool (step 3); this fails with:

 Is it even possible to work with the yesod command line tool on an M1? If so, am I just making some boneheaded mistake?

 I learned today about running grep from within emacs. I tried it out, and the results were spoiled by the inclusion of files from my mypy folder, which aren't of interest. I could modify the grep command to excplude that folder, but I'm lazy. I'd prefer to be able to click on the output and say "hide this and anything else from the same folder".
 I'd also like to be able to interactively toggle the -h option, to hide the filenames on the left side.
 Is this possible? I see that I can jump to the file, and the line in question, which is great. Other than that, though, the output does not seem to be very interactive.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I started using orgmode two months ago after I learnt about it from videos from thoughtbot. Never having used emacs before and not knowing lisp it took me while to ramp up on it. I found the way you can have neatly nested lists and have math equations quite nice. I set up org roam as well . Everything on doom emacs. But after 2 months of using it I find myself in a situation where it has turned out to be not all I expected it to be. * The org roam promise of becoming a second brain didn't really work for me. Maybe I'm not using it correctly but having backlink info in the buffer I didn't find that useful. It's not easy to find things unless you remember the name or keywords in the title.
  
Writing long documents feels clunky in orgmode. Maybe it's more adapted to short todos. I don't know how to explain it
 
Export options : I can export to pdf but the output often doesn't look good with the weird section numbering. Having nested items looks good inside orgmode but not in an exported pdf. There's no option to export to doc that I'm aware of. It makes collaboration with others difficult
 
It doesn't work well with tools my team uses with slack and google docs. 
 
And many others
 
 Has anyone else felt like this? What am I doing wrong? I'm planning to go back to vs code and mark down files because emacs looks like a big investment. But I really like the idea of a macro enabled editor.
 Edit: I didn't expect such useful and positive feedback from everyone. You guys are the best. I found some promising stuff . I'm going to give it another try. Thanks!

I have previously built a normal artificial network using hmatrix for linear algebra operations (BLAS, etc.) but now that I need to do convolutions, I have to somehow parallelise my code. I looked into the obvious packages for parallel arrays such as repa arrays and the accelerate package. accelerate is an embedded DSL which I think would make the code quite unelegant and I want to stay as close to Haskell as possible. Further, I am working on a Windows PC with a CUDA capable GPU but also a MacBook Pro 2021 so I'd have to implement both accelerate and some other package for non-CUDA PCs as well.

If you open a new window (from the Window menu), it opens a second copy of The Archive. Normally, this window operates independently of the first window.
But what I hadn't realized is that, if you have the second window open and highlighted, you can right click on links in the (unhighlighted) first window. If you hover over a link, right click and select Open Link in that window, it leaves the first window on its current page, and opens the link in the second window. Very cool. This is really useful for copying material between documents that are part of the same "tree" of documents, without losing your place or leaving the current document.]]></summary>

 In short, I'd like the function to do this: whenever I switch buffers, Emacs runs this function which should take the underlying filename of the buffer, open an org file arranged as a datetree, create a (or go to an already existing) heading based on the filename, and clock in. If that heading is the currently-clocked item, don't clock out and in again. Use the top-level directory name of the project as the file tag (for later filtering).

 I use Debian 11 with KDE. So far, I was on KDE X11 and I ran the emacs daemon as a service (debian configures this for you ootb, so you simply need to enable it).
 However, I moved to a KDE wayland setup today, and I cannot launch the client after boot. I think it is launching before wayland can set things up (I have no idea what that means though...).
 journalctl --user -u emacs.service | tail -n 10 gives me
 Feb 17 15:39:39 xxx emacs[1302]: Loaded /home/x/.emacs.d/config/settings.el Feb 17 15:39:40 xxx emacs[1302]: Turning on magit-auto-revert-mode... Feb 17 15:39:40 xxx emacs[1302]: Turning on magit-auto-revert-mode...done (0.330s, 90 buffers checked) Feb 17 15:39:40 xxx emacs[1302]: Starting Emacs daemon. Feb 17 15:39:41 xxx systemd[1282]: Started Emacs text editor. Feb 17 15:39:41 xxx emacs[1302]: Package cl is deprecated Feb 17 15:39:41 xxx systemd[1282]: emacs.service: Got notification message from PID 3258, but reception only permitted for main PID 1302 Feb 17 15:41:51 xxx emacs[1302]: No protocol specified Feb 17 15:45:53 xxx emacs[1302]: No protocol specified 
 So I am guessing the daemon loads properly and then encounters some problems after the Package cl is deprecated message. If I try to run the client with emacsclient -c I get
 Waiting for Emacs... *ERROR*: Display :1 can’t be opened 
 Which is very strange since systemctl status --user emacs.service shows that the service is indeed active. Any help/suggestions/comments?
 Cheers

When I process all of those numbers, the *Calc Trail* buffer doesn't scroll down automatically, so I have to do it to see what my most recent calculations were.

I really enjoy calc-mode, but it's frustrating to use for long equations due to this. Anyone have similar issues?

 Recently I've been looking for a new keyboard and I sort of settled on the Moonlander or Planck. Moonlander is a full fledged ergonomic keyboard and Planck is a smaller (40%) keyboard. I will often have the keyboard with me as I'm working at home and a couple of different locations at work, therefore the small planck is tempting. Anyone that uses Planck with Emacs? Will it be better to buy a larger ergonomic keyboard? 
 Any input will be greatly appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ok, due to the latest Arch update of latest gcc & gcc-libs (they package it so), libgccjit was broken. I had to uninstall it so I could upgrade rest of the system, and my Emacs didn't start due to missing libgccjit.so. So I quickly recompiled Emacs without native compiler, and surprise. I don't even miss native compiler. 
 I used to see a difference in Helm and some other places like a year ago when native comp was in its early stages. I don't have benchmarks, but my Emacs seems like even smoother without native comp for some reason. There are no hiccups, no waiting for completions to pop up. What happened? I run current master, re-compiled like 2 days ago.
 I now even wonder if I will enable native comp again. Is it just me, or do other people experience similar?

I've tried google, but I don't know/understand emacs terms enough to know what to search. 
 I'm not asking for a config, or "edit some-variable-name" I want to learn and the best way for me is by doing
 I'm a prose writer and have converted my markdown novel into org.
 The meat
  
Since I don't use text editors for code, I'd like to have emacs "know" to use helvetica when I open an *.org file. I'd done something similar in vim where markdown files would word wrap at 100 characters and a few other things I've since forgotten. (I haven't written in over a year and it's been longer than that since I edited init.vim
 I've been playing around with prelude-emacs … distro? I'd like to use vanilla emacs but add whatever package pops up a mini-buffer? With hints after chording C-c or M-x
 TLDR
  
What variable should I look at to have org mode use helvetica font? What package gives hints after typing C-c , M-x etc

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[First, Install OpenBangla for your distro following the official guide. (OpenBanlga include avro and many more feature.)
 Next, configure the input method for your Window Manager according to the guide above. After you do that, you can now change input method using s+SPACE So now you can have a workflow.
 - Go to emacs
 - Open a file and type some bangla texts.
 - If you need to type commands, do s+SPACE to move back to English.
 Its fairly obvious but I thought it might be helpful for some beginners who searched for similar feature, like me. And also, its not nearly as seamless as M-x set-input-method bengali-itrans which automatically handles all of these for you and gives you an amazing writing experience. Sadly, it does not yet provide avro-style input-method and the existing itrans,probhat are really unorthodox input method that very few uses and hard to master. I hope someday I will have enough knowledge to contribute that.

 Anyone here was already used to and comfortable with regular emacs bindings and decided to learn Vim keybindings?
 Did you think it was worth it? Did you keep it or went back to vanilla emacs? Do you use it only in certain contexts? Any tips for how to pursue it?

 TL;DR: Would appreciate some feedback about my WIP Emacs theme. Link: https://github.com/qhga/shanty-theme
 Last week I finally had the time to do one thing that was on my bucket list for quite some time: Write my own Emacs color theme.
 It is not available on MELPA yet, because I first wanted to ask some fellow Emacs users about their opinion. So far, the one person that also uses Emacs and I know irl thinks it is quite pleasant. But I would appreciate a bit more feedback, so here I am.
 It is still a WIP so every feedback is very welcome (: For now, I only included packages I use on a regular basis, but I'll try to slowly but surely add dedicated support for more packages (requests welcome). Most of the other packages I know have sane inheritance and could still be usable right now. I am by far not an elisp-pro but I tried my best to provide a dark and a light version without too much duplicate code.
 If you wanna check it out, here is the link: https://github.com/qhga/shanty-theme
 Thanks <3

I found out about gnus-buffer-configuration variable where is configuration of how screen should by displayed. I also found gnus-add-configuration function to modify. I tried to set article settings to:
 (article (vertical 1.0 (article 1.0 point))) 
 But when I try to open article I get gnus-summary-show-thread: Args out of range: 0 and empty buffer is open in fullscreen. I also tried without point:
 (article (vertical 1.0 (article 1.0))) 
 since I got same error when I tried to reset to default and I forgot to delete points from behind the article:
 (gnus-add-configuration '(article (vertical 1.0 (summary 0.25 point) (article 1.0 point)))) 
 I also tried to get (summary 0) but that was some other error and I thing it also does not make much sense.
 Anybody tried similar thing? How to setup GNUS to open article fullscreen?
 EDIT: I tried to debug gnus a little bit and I find out that responsible function for shoving thread is gnus-summary-show-thread, but can't understand what exactly it is doing, from mi point of view I see only some tinkering with cursor position and something called overlays:
 (defun gnus-summary-show-thread () "Show thread subtrees. Returns nil if no thread was there to be shown." (interactive nil gnus-summary-mode) (let* ((orig (point)) (end (point-at-eol)) (end (or (gnus-summary--inv end) (gnus-summary--inv (1- end)))) ;; Leave point at bol (beg (progn (beginning-of-line) (if (bobp) (point) (1- (point))))) (eoi (and end (next-single-char-property-change end 'invisible)))) (when eoi (remove-overlays beg eoi 'invisible 'gnus-sum) (goto-char orig) (gnus-summary-position-point) eoi)))

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[That's a bit of a strange post, but I hope it may spark some positive discussion: Emacs recently get tab support. First AFAIK from Centaur Emacs and then upstream. Tabs are common UI elements since years, however IMVHO in most cases are a very bad idea as they are normally: modern monitor are 16:9 and most people use them straight, not 90° rotated, so plenty of horizontal space, very little vertical one and tabs eat some of it while still being unable to scale well...
 On contrary "experiments" like Tab Center Redux (it's successor Tab Center Reborn) Firefox extension show that vertical tabs can scale well, they might be "hard to choose" at first, but actually work pretty well. They remain easy to read even when they are many, they might be scrollable if needed, integrated with switch-buffer search&narrow packages, they might co-exist with a sidebar (like those popular in IDEs), even on one and another side of the screen and potentially spark new UI ideas to extend them further. 
 What do you think about that?

 ​
 Emacs and Preview displaying the same PDF, where it is much darker in Emacs
 I am not sure why this happens -- I haven't changed any settings related to DocView or enabled any minor modes that would cause this. Disabling my current emacs config (by moving .emacs.d) does not resolve this. I am using the mituharu emacs-mac port from this Homebrew formula, but the issue also exists with the build from https://emacsformacosx.com. My .emacs.d is on GitHub here.
 Has anyone encountered a similar issue before? How would I go about resolving this?
 UPDATE:
 I found out that the issue is caused by GhostScript, as expressed in this comment. I've resolved it by installing mupdf (brew install mupdf), which should cause docview to use mudraw to convert PDFs to temporary PNGs instead of GhostScript. After installing mupdf, opening a PDF in DocView and running doc-view-clear-cache should resolve the issue.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I hope one of you fine folk can help. I'm trying to set up mu4e and integrate it with my org-mode based GTD system.
 I already have org capture templates set up to make next action entries.
 What I want to do now, is make the next action entry have a link to the email that the action is about (i.e. the one I was reading when I invoked the capture template)... but if I invoke the capture template from someplace other than an email, I don't want there to be a link in it.
 So if I'm in an email, I want C-c c a w to open this template:
 ("aw" "Work Related" entry (file+headline "~/mygtd.org" "Work") "* TODO %? %a %u \n\n ") 
 But if I'm someplace other than an email, I want the same key combination C-c c a w to open this template:
 ("aw" "Work Related" entry (file+headline "~/mygtd.org" "Work") "* TODO %? %u \n\n ") 
 Which is exactly the same, except it has no %a in it.
 How would I do that?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 seems I am too stupid to customize modes for my text file editing, either via manually changing the .emacs or via M-x customize or via Easy Customize menu. Have read all online doc, internet search, "Learning GNU Emacs" book. Have tested dozens of variants given in these sources for manual changes in .emacs, but regardless which variant, when I open my file, none is active and shown in mode line. Only I managed to set fill-column via Easy Customize dialog ad the adwaita look.
 I simply want to have text-mode, enriched-mode, auto-fill-mode, flyspell-mode set as standard for working buffer. 
 Here is my latest .emacs: 
 (custom-set-variables
 ;; custom-set-variables was added by Custom.
 ;; If you edit it by hand, you could mess it up, so be careful.
 ;; Your init file should contain only one such instance.
 ;; If there is more than one, they won't work right.
 '(add-hook 'text-mode-hook t)
 '(ansi-color-faces-vector
 [default default default italic underline success warning error])
 '(ansi-color-names-vector
 ["black" "red3" "ForestGreen" "yellow3" "blue" "magenta3" "DeepSkyBlue" "gray50"])
 '(custom-enabled-themes '(adwaita))
 '(display-fill-column-indicator t)
 '(fill-column 75)
 '(add-hook 'text-mode-hook 'auto-fill-mode)
 '(add-hook 'text-mode-hook 'enriched-mode)
 '(add-hook 'text-mode-hook 'flyspell-mode))
 (custom-set-faces
 ;; custom-set-faces was added by Custom.
 ;; If you edit it by hand, you could mess it up, so be careful.
 ;; Your init file should contain only one such instance.
 ;; If there is more than one, they won't work right.
 ) 
 If anyone could advise, I would be happy!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm having trouble customizing emacs.
 I have learned how to use hooks to switch things on and off, e.g.:
  (add-hook 'text-mode-hook 'visual-line-mode) 
 So that text files will open with word wrap on.
 What I've not been able to do is to pass a value in on starting a mode, e.g.:
 ``` doesn't work
 (add-hook 'text-mode-hook 'text-scale-adjust 3))
 or
 (add-hook 'text-mode-hook 'text-scale-adjust &eval ('text-scale-adjust 3))
 doesn't work
 ```
 I'm sure you can see what I'm trying to do -- when in text mode, automatically enlarge the text so that I can read it.
 I have read the manual -- but unfortunately that part of the manual (23.1.1 Running Hooks) doesn't give any examples.
 I think the bit that reads: "If a hook variable has a non-nil value, that value should be a list of functions. run-hooks calls all the functions, one by one, with no arguments." refers to what I'm trying to do, but how I write a list of functions that evaluates to "3" I've no idea.
 Any help appreciated.

 EDIT: I'm sorry that people are upset with me for the way I've set up the poll, I am close to a total newcomer to Linux, and I've just seen these groupings of distros around (usually referring to difficulty/level of customization) so I figured it was a fine enough compromise since I couldn't add them all as poll options. As for why I didn't include various distros like BSDs, as some commenters guessed, I just had never heard of them before.
 Also sorry that it's single choice, it slipped my mind and I can't change it now

 Aspell only seems to like straight quotes
 I've looked around the customization options for flyspell but haven't found anything that looks relevant. And it occurred to me that I cannot be the only person dealing with this problem. So I come here asking for help. Anyone?
 (I found a post by Artur Malabarba offering a solution to this problem but I'm wondering if others have other fixes.)

 class PrettyOrShow a where prettyOrShow :: a -> String instance Pretty a => PrettyOrShow a where prettyOrShow = show . pretty instance Show a => PrettyOrShow a where prettyOrShow a = show 
 Now the behavior I want is: if my type is known (at compile-time) to be Show, then use show, but if I know Pretty, then use pretty OVER the show instance (subsequent instances might take further precedence, but I don't need more instances to be possible). The part of resolution order makes sense to me (with some configuration of OVERLAPS/OVERLAPPABLE).
 But I know why I can't write this - the a in the instance definitions match all types! And the instance resolution simply does not use the constraints to resolve the instances. My understanding of the reasoning for this design is that Haskell would become internally inconsistent, because in different contexts, prettyOrShow could have different behavior for the same types in different contexts. Great - I love that - super safe. But in this case I DONT CARE. I want to write this out of convenience - so I don't care about safety here - if the behavior is inconsistent I will still sleep deeply and peacefully . If we had dependent constraints or something similar, perhaps this would be easy - but as it stands - this is not...
 Is there a way to do what I want to do? Make it as grimy as you like. Use reflection if you must but bonus points if its raw GHC Haskell: we will all bask in the ugliness.

I want to attend the event this year and notice that Haskell.org was one of the organizations. It sounds really exciting, I hope Haskell.org will participate in GSoC this year as well. But I have little experience with Haskell, I'm worried about how to write an expressive proposal when I don't even know which projects they will focus on. Can anyone give me so resources or suggestions about the following question?
  
How can I predict the projects this year? (Where can I find out some clues?)
 Which materials should I go through to master required basic skills, including reading books, articles (both blogs and papers), open-source project code, and any other resource? I can only finish some 1-3 kyu problems on CodeWars now. (My CodeWars Profile)
 How to write an attractive proposal in GSoC for working with Haskell.org? I can find very few accepted GSoC proposals on the Internet, many of which were even written several years ago. I have almost no idea about how to write the proposal, especially for Haskell.org, can you provide me with some examples for references?
  
Thanks a lot.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, to understand my problem, let me explain my situation.
 I am Greek and naturally a lot of my files are in greek. To make org export to a latex pdf properly, if it has greek characters, you need to add some packages to it. I have those in my org-latex-packages-alist and everything exports just fine. 
 However, when we get to exporting org-roam files (or any file that contains file links for that matter), there is a problem. The org latex export backend typically exports a link like \href{file_name}{description}. If the file name is in greek (which odds are it is), latex starts to freak out a bit. Org will export perfectly to latex, but latex won't export to pdf. To my understanding, it doesn't understand the greek characters in the file name (which it should as it understands them everywhere else) and it chooses not to export.
 After a lot of searching, I did manage to find a solution to this in this post. Basically, if the link is of the form \href{\detokenize{file_name}}{description}, it exports perfectly. From what I understand, that command just makes it recognize any unicode character for file names. 
 So my question is, can you configure the org latex export backend to export links in the form \href{\detokenize{file_name}}{description} and not \href{file_name}{description} as it does by default. I couldn't find any option that changes how hyperref makes its links in the hyperref manual, nor could I find how org exports its links to latex in the org-export manual, so if anyone here knows, it would help me greatly.
 Thanks in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have slowly transitioned from PyCharm to Emacs for my coding development and It's been about 6 months now and in general am very happy with my workflow in Emacs. There is just one thing that is still pulling me back to PyCharm and it is something that others might not find too useful but I constantly use. 
 It is the tree-like structure overview for your code that PyCharm has that you can toggle on the left and it looks like this. 
 Now I know I can get a directory overview with the treemacs package and I also know about the iMenu command which is very nice but not exactly a static tree-like structure you can look at. I was wondering if there exists a package to show the class/functions/ structure of a file on the side as you can see on the picture above. 
 Thank you for your help.

 #+title: Hi Reddit #+author: monsieurpi #+OPTIONS: H:3 num:3 toc:t \n:nil @:t ::t |:t ^:{} _:{} *:t TeX:t LaTeX:t * Test #+CAPTION: test #+NAME: fig:test #+ATTR_HTML: :width 400px #+ATTR_ORG: :width 400px [[./img/test.jpg]] 
 I tried to export it with C-c C-e m m:
 # Table of Contents 1. [Test](#org358707a) <a id="org358707a"></a> # Test ![img](./img/test.jpg "test") 
 Which is almost perfect but the #+ATTR_ORG: :width 400px wasn't exported.
 I then tried with pandoc C-c C-e p g (and in CLI with pandoc -i reddit.org -o reddit.md):
 @:t ::t |:t ^:{} \_:{} \*:t TeX:t LaTeX:t # Test ![](./img/test.jpg) 
 Looks like pandoc doesn't care about my options and even wrote some of them as plain text and the size for my image is still not here.
 Is there a way to achieve it (other than writing 
 #+html: <img src="img/test.jpg" width="600px"> 
 Because I tried:
 * Test #+CAPTION: test #+NAME: fig:test #+PROPERTY: header-args :eval never-export #+ATTR_HTML: :width 400px #+ATTR_ORG: :width 400xp [[./img/test.jpg]] #+html: <img src="img/test.jpg" width="400px"> 
 But the image is still exported.
 And why does pandoc export my options as plain text?

 * Tuesday, 02/15/2022
 ** 09:20 Is this supposed to be a header? I'd rather be notes here instead of having a header.
 This is the start of the next paragraph. I think it would look better if it started such that all text lines up, so "This" would start under the previous paragraphs "Is".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ok, I've been learning akka, and I'm trying to wrap my head around thread safety. Let's recap
 JAVA THREAD MEMORY MODEL
 All threads have their own little slice of memory exclusive to that thread. Periodically the JVM will sync the thread memory values to main memory, but it's not guaranteed when that will happen. This is why different threads can see different values of a variable.
 Volatile of course bypasses this by making a given variable always be read/written from/to main memory. Synchronized enforced the other piece of this, ensuring that only one thread at a time can interact with it to prevent race conditions.
 AKKA ACTOR THREAD MEMORY MODEL
 So I do not totally understand this, but here is what I do understand. AKKA has its own thread pool, and is purely message based. A given actor is executed on any available thread when a message is present for that actor.
 The first thing that trips me up is that Akka only executes a message on a given actor one at a time. Ie, a given actor will process messages synchronously. I could be wrong about this, please tell me if I am. This just seems like a bad model for concurrency vs a more traditional approach like the thread-per-request model of a traditional webapp like Spring.
 The second thing is that while this kind of message processing rule would prevent race conditions, it feels like memory consistency would still be an issue. If an actor can be operated on by multiple threads, even if those threads can't touch it concurrently, how do all the threads see the same state value? Wouldn't there be a risk of memory consistency issues? Are actors somehow made entirely volatile?
 CONCLUSION
 I clearly do not understand some key stuff here. Guidance would be appreciated. Thanks.

Using Consult's narrowing system, the user is able to access the current project's buffers, project files and all the known projects, in case they want to change projects quickly. Consult-project provides an extension to the default Consult functionality, using the built-in package project.el, defining the functions consult-project and consult-project-other-window. Furthermore, Consult-project only depends on consult, resulting in a lean and simple to maintain functionality.
 ⚠️ NOTE: This package has come to life adapting the great package consult-projectile by OlMon. Most if not all credit should go to him, I have been using his package for months now. What inspired me to create this package is my recent effort to avoid most third party packages, specially if they prefer a newly defined interface over the built-in Emacs interface.
 Also special shutout to Daniel Mendler for making such a great package!
 I would appreciate any feedback, I'll try to submit the package to MELPA next.

 I have two questions, and both of them are about this commit: https://github.com/sekunho/swapi/tree/59277e41bd12b6f390600c78f12742f5da335aea.
 Static binary
 Currently I'm not really aware of exactly what libs I need to build a static binary with cabal build; locally in nix develop. 
  
Output
 Packages in flake.nix
 swoogle's ghc-options in swapi.cabal
  
It does work fine in the CI (I think) since I'm using the ghc-musl image, but I'm not sure how that translates to a Nix environment, unfortunately. Building it with dynamic linking does work though (by removing the ghc-options under the swoogle executable), but I'd like for it to be consistent between CI and the dev environment, for the most part. 
 Discrepancies in CI and dev
  
Dockerfile
 GitHub Actions file
 cabal.project.freeze
 swapi.cabal
  
This has more to do with how cabal resolves the dependencies. So this is the result of the most recent job: (GitHub Actions, PasteBin).
 My question here is, despite freezing the dependencies (and committing it), why does cabal resolve them differently? Locally it all builds, and runs just fine. But in the CI it seems to be complaining about conflicting versions of base, for example. At one point it also complained about req, and some other libraries. I think I'm missing something obvious to make it consistent between both environments. I don't understand where it pulled that new base version from.
 I'll try to provide more information if ever what I've provided so far is insufficient. Thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all!
I'm new to zettelkasten. I've been playing with it for just a few days now, and I've already found some of the KMs very helpful.
Thanks, @Will, for many of them!
I was wondering if anyone had ever created a KM for inserting a link to a structure note on a zettel.
For me, I put my links to the structure note and other zettels at the very bottom of each zettel. I've used the naming convention for structure notes that includes the • between the UID and the text title.
I was thinking if there was a way to set it up so it worked something like this:
I place my cursor in the appropriate location in my zettel.
I enter the key combination for the KM to insert my structure note link.
It then gives me a prompt, asking me which structure note I want to link to (it would limit it to those zettels with the • in the title).
I select the appropriate structure note.
It automatically enters that structure note as a link in the format of UID and text title of the structure note.
Is this possible? Is it unnecessary?
The reverse of this would be a time saver too. For me, I often add a link to my newest zettel to my structure note immediately after I create the zettel. So, if there was a way to go back to my structure note and use a KM to create a link to the most recently created zettel (of even a prompt to choose from one of the more recently created zettels) that would save time too.
Or, have you guys found ways to save time and do this without a KM macro?]]></summary>

 I want to be able to browse, but I want to limit editing to a smaller section of the file, similar how I can edit "#begin_src" block using "org-edit-special" in a new frame/window.
 I need this as a psychological effect of saying "now I will change (and only this entry)" and "now I will only view" (I don't need this for every orgmode file, but especially in my journal where any edit to a previous section must be conscious).
 Hit me. What can a beginner do to achieve this? What is available right now?
 EDIT/NOTES: this is not about making a file read-only or about making backups or versioning. It is about the actual process of a human CONFIRMING himself that it wants to change stuff.

 SimpleX Chat for terminal is built in Haskell, and with a lot of help from u/angerman - thank you! - we made the same core work both on iOS and Android platforms.
 To exchange messages privately you can connect either via the invitation link you can share from the app or by scanning QR code from the app on their phone (e.g., during video call or in person).
 More information about SimpleX and iOS app is in this post: https://github.com/simplex-chat/simplex-chat/blob/stable/blog/20220214-simplex-chat-ios-public-beta.md
 We really look forward to your feedback – you can connect to the team from the app settings (it will be myself or somebody else replying to you:)
 Please star the repo on GitHub (thanks a lot if you did already!) and share iOS app beta with your friends – Android app is coming in a few weeks too!

 Note that this doesn't affect one's tab-bar, tab-line, or project.el config in any way. It just adds a few convenience functions to set things up for isolated buffers and for creating or opening workspaces.

 And there is different one called python-mode in MELPA: https://melpa.org/#/python-mode, with upstream at https://gitlab.com/python-mode-devs/python-mode/
 What is the difference between them?
 The background of my question is that I tried to setup my Emacs 27 as a python environment with a language server like David Wilson (aka SystemCrafter) described in his tutorial. This is a codesnippet of it.
 ```lisp (use-package lsp-mode :commands (lsp lsp-deferred) :init (setq lsp-keymap-prefix "C-l") :config (lsp-enable-which-key-integration t) )
 (use-package python-mode :ensure t :hook (python-mode . lsp-deferred) :custom (python-shell-interpreter "python3") ) ```
 I am not sure but it looks like that the python-mode here cause the use of the MELPA version of python-mode. How can I setup the inbuild python mode of Emacs include the use of the language server?

 Alternative tutorial: https://web.archive.org/web/20060409123241/http://dto.twu.net/HowmTutorial.howm.html
 EmacsWiki: https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/HowmMode
 I was looking for alternatives to org-mode, not because there is anything wrong with it, but because I use it only for note taking and sometimes TODO and was wondering what else is there.
 Another thing with org is that sometimes the ecosystem, for someone not doing GTD or writing a paper etc. can feel a bit overwhelming. 
 I didn't find a lot of info about howm, except a couple posts here, including a 15 year old link that is dead (thank heavens to the Wayback Machine). But I can infer there are some active users between this subreddit and the Emacs Wiki.
 I like the way it links info with >>> and the schedules with special sorting for TODO vs deadline vs reminder seems interesting.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
I'm working on some notes and I'm a bit confused on the process I should use.
I have note which is about "Transform information into knowledge" where I talk about the differences between the two.
It comes from the Zettelkasten method, and it gave me ideas on many other subjects, like therapy, coaching and marketing.
I also already have a note that says "It's not about what you know, it's about what you do with what you know", talking about the ideas that knowledge is not enough, and that it's acting on knowledge that builds and create things. That note is also connected to coaching and therapeutic ideas.
I had some epiphanies and good concepts while working on those notes, and that created 2 other notes.
At first, I was writing everything in the first note "Transform information into knowledge" which was becoming almost like the start of an article. The "flow" got to me and I wrote some good ideas and made some good connections.
I'm new to Zettelkasten but I remember the Permanent / Evergreen notes should be atomic and if possible, quite short.
So I splited my "Transform information into knowledge" note into 5 different notes.
I now have 5 different notes, linked together, talking about the same idea.
In a MOC about Therapeutic Changes, I added all those 5 notes.
It's a bit confusing to me because naturally I would have kept "Transform information into knowledge" and let that note because a bit longer and like an "index" of all the others ideas, and put that note into my Therapeutic MOC.
And when I see examples here and there I feel like permanent notes are not "that short" and even sometimes, not that atomic.
What's the best method here in your opinion ? What's your take on this ?
Thanks a lot]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey guys,
 I am a new convert to emacs. I tried in the past to get my head around it for simple plain text editing, but it never really clicked. Recently I got back into it (mainly via vim -> evilmode) and I am currently hacking away on my own config. (The stream series "Emacs from Scratch" by System Crafters was insanely helpful.)
 I am a physics postgrad and use R for data analysis and yihui's suite of R packages for any type of write-up/publishing.
  
RMarkdown: Simple Markdown syntax to write documents with R code blocks mainly to avoid writing LaTeX directly and for reproducibility.
 bookdown: Write scientific reports in RMarkdown and export them to html (Github Pages) and pdf with references and citations.
 blogdown: Publish my personal website via a simple RMarkdown syntax and easy to use R-functions. (Not thaaaat important to me, I don't blog regularly)
  
I have realised that I can do most of those things also using orgmode. Is someone here who made a similar switch from the RMarkdown ecosystem to orgmode, who could point me in the right direction regarding workflows, packages or tutorials etc? I am slowly getting paralysed by the amount of possibilities I have with emacs and now orgmode....
 ​
 edit: I mainly want to switch to emacs with orgmode to get away from RStudio. I feel it can be quite limiting.

 I'm using lsp-mode with intelephense as the back-end. Code completion works great, but I'm missing the usual alerts that I got with PhpStorm which showed, in the method signature, which exceptions where thrown but not catched.
 What do you guys use for that? Should I use another specific tool for it or maybe should I switch to another LSP back-end, ...?
 Thanks a lot in advance!
 EDIT: as a front-end for linting, I'm using the built-in flymake-mode.

 I'm trying to figure out how to make it so that when I C-c in a src block in org-mode, it first checks all related src blocks in the file, tangle them together in a temporary buffer and only then execute the buffer, providing the results needed.
 Is there a native way to do that? Am I supposed to use the post-tangle hook org-babel provides?
 For now what I'm doing is:
 - create all src blocks setting the tangle to a file location I can access, like #+begin_src typescript :tangle ~/tmp/this-is-a-test.ts
 - run org-babel-tangle
 - running the compiler on that file manually to find out the results
 However, that is tedious and I want to figure out a way to …]]></summary>

 foo -> bar -> baz -> foo -> bar -> baz etc. etc.
 Baz had some conditional behavior in it that either quit the "loop" or returned back to foo again. In the case of the assignment the data being passed around was data for the solution to a puzzle.
 The code worked, but the more I think about it the sketchier it seems.
 Does this seem appropriate or should it be avoided?

 I have a couple of questions regarding this change:

 Are there any drawbacks to this approach that I might not have considered?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve recently been assigned an project where I’ve been tasked to create a lexical analyzer with the basis of the main function:
 tokenize :: String -> [(String, Token)]
 and as an arithmetic string as it’s only parameter and without any imported functions (like split)
 I’ve been struggling for the past couple days trying to understand Haskell but having no such luck other than recursion as well as a bit of the split function I made, which I know is used in this project. 
 The output would be something like something like this:
 Input: “(Result * 50) = Answer”
 Output: [(“(“, LeftPar),(“Result”, Id),(“*”, Value 50),(“)”, RightPar),(“=“, Equals),(“Answer”, Id)]
 I still want to learn so I don’t want the straight full answer, but rather a push in the right direction. Especially when it comes to data type declaration which I know comes into to play here. Any help would be appreciated at this point. Please and thank you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I have a chunk of hexadecimal digits in a buffer, I want to convert it to raw bytes. I happen to know the raw bytes are going to all be ASCII characters.
 Here is the solution I have so far:
 I start with this:
 74686520717569636b2062726f776e20 666f78206a756d706564206f76657220 746865206c617a7920646f67 
 I run this on the buffer
 (let ((case-replace nil)) (replace-regexp "[[:xdigit:]]\\{2\\}" "\\\\x\\&") (goto-char (point-min)) (replace-regexp "^" "(insert \"") (goto-char (point-min)) (replace-regexp "$" "\")")) 
 That makes the buffer into this:
 "\x74\x68\x65\x20\x71\x75\x69\x63\x6b\x20\x62\x72\x6f\x77\x6e\x20" "\x66\x6f\x78\x20\x6a\x75\x6d\x70\x65\x64\x20\x6f\x76\x65\x72\x20" "\x74\x68\x65\x20\x6c\x61\x7a\x79\x20\x64\x6f\x67" 
 Now I make it into a Lisp expression:
 (goto-char (point-min)) (insert "(insert\n") (goto-char (point-max)) (insert ")") 
 Now my buffer has this:
 (insert "\x74\x68\x65\x20\x71\x75\x69\x63\x6b\x20\x62\x72\x6f\x77\x6e\x20" "\x66\x6f\x78\x20\x6a\x75\x6d\x70\x65\x64\x20\x6f\x76\x65\x72\x20" "\x74\x68\x65\x20\x6c\x61\x7a\x79\x20\x64\x6f\x67") 
 Finally I do this:
 (eval (read (prog1 (buffer-string) (erase-buffer)))) 
 and I get the result I want
 the quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog 
 Is there a better way to do this? It would especially be nice to do this without (eval (read (buffer-string))). Note that this function needs to run on arbitrary length string inputs scattered throughout a buffer, but mostly operate on only 2-8 bytes of hexadecimal encoded data at a time, so something that works efficiently on small strings is best.
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For some backstory, I'm a full-stack developer with Node (JavaScript) and I've been learning Scala as I've heard it's a faster programming language and I need something fast to handle some back-end operations in terms of file validation and processing for one of my apps. So far, I'm loving Scala - seems like a really powerful language and I'm glad that I have the time to learn it.
 However, I've made a simple test in each language to truly compare the speed of each language when running a large loop, and I'm finding that JavaScript is actually much faster than Scala in that regard.
 Here's a sample of the method I wrote in Scala for the test:
  def runLargeLoop(success: (Int, Long) => Unit, failure: (Throwable) => Unit) = { val startTime = currentTime val loop = () => Future { var num = 0 …]]></summary>

But this time I made something that I think might be useful to others so I'm sharing it here.
 This is a minor mode that can do well with LaTeX or org-mode. 
 What it does is: convert valid lisp expressions to LaTeX expressions. As you know we can evaluate lisp expressions directly in emacs (C-x C-e), so I had this thought why not use emacs as a calculator while typing the text without the need to move to another buffer to calculate things. But the problem was I couldn't leave the lisp expressions as it is if I have to submit the paper somewhere. S…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[HI, I cannot find on the internet ways to be faster on using org mode to move items between files, I am doing some hacks but I know that there have to be a faster way, to optimize such a repetitive task.
 Intuitively I opened two vertical windows, so that i have in window 1 a file A.org in a buffer, and in window 2 a file B.org in antoher buffer
 What i cut in a file is not pasted as I would expect in the second bufffer:
 1) Selecting ONE heading with relative subheadings, or selecting subheading in windows 1 cutting and pasting in window 2 at a different level of nested level, is painful, because the two files have different level of indentation(I mean number of asterisks). So for example if I have in window 1 a block of text that is at a third level, when I am going to paste in window 2 `at a specific point` at a 5th level, is `not` going to be recognized that need to be pasted "under" the 5th level and so be recognized as a 6th level the heading(from window 1) and at a 7th level the relative subheading. 
 I would rather select multiple files in window 1 and paste in window 2:
 2) I would like to select multiple headings, or subheadings in window 1 an then just paste them in window 2, so far I have been able only to do it one per time, instead I was expecting to cut in window 1 all the text I needed and then paste all in window2 (I mean like when I am using a resource browser on a PC and I select with control click all the items i need(not consequential) and then paste on a certain point in window 2

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Howdy. So I have worked with Scala before but quite a few years ago. It was my big introduction to functional programming and by the end of the project I understood functional programming just well enough to be interested in it. Since then I have studied it extensively in languages that are not purely functional, mainly TypeScript, and this has motivated me to pick up Scala again.
 I know that Scala 3 has just come out. Obviously I would like to work with the latest version. However my experience with other major software updates leaves me a bit wary. I have seen in other ecosystems major updates causing widespread compatibility issues with common libraries resulting in a highly complicated process of figuring out what will and will not work with the new version.
 On that note, I'm hoping for clarity on a few points:
 1) does scala 2 code compile in a scala 3 project?
 2) will third party libraries written for scala 2 still be compatible with Scala 3? I'm inclined to say yes because it all compiles to Java bytecode but I just want to be sure.
 3) any other pitfalls that someone with limited scala experience who will be starting with Scala 3 should know?
 Thanks in advance.

 As in the title; I want to use uuid's for links to other parts of my files, but they won't all be on the same system. Essentially, between all my projects, all in different git repositories, I want to link to different parts of their documentation, and was wondering how uuid links would translate to html duing org-html-export-to-html.
 Thank you kindly for the information!

 I just want to be able to have tabs that I can reorganize amongst themselves (I couldn't figure out how to do that with native emacs tabs), and workgroups (e.g: perspective/workgroups/persp-mode/...) to be able to switch from a set of tabs to another set of tabs.
 Currently I have centaur-tabs setup because it's the only tab solution that allows me to move tabs (eg: centaur-tabs-move-current-tab-to-left, centaur-tabs-move-current-tab-to-right), but it doesn't play nice with any workgroup packages. Tabs stay visible in all workgroups with perspective
 Has anyone been able to achieve this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In several projects, I've needed a way to implement remote procedure calls. What do people use for this, or is this something that's mostly missing in the community? Hackage has a variety of libraries but they're either very old or seemingly unmaintained. The only one I see that's maintained is grpc-haskell.
 Anyway, grpc-haskell uses proto3-wire instead of proto-lens (which the community seems to have settled on as the best solution). This leads to its own confusion.
 I could use something like warp + servant (or warp + wai to reinvent the wheel), but servant is missing some major functionality for this purpose. Namely, servant is focused on REST, which means the transfer of an entire object state. One of the things I want from an RPC system is the ability to stream data in a type-safe manner (like gRPC does). 
 Any thoughts? I'd prefer something standardized.

Today, I sat down to the book again. In doing so, it took me about 2h to get back into the subject matter enough to reach my usual level of productivity.
 That's two hours I didn't work at "optimal operating temperature".
 The reason it took me so long is related to the depth of the material. But there are additional requirements beyond the book. I have to orient myself in the appropriate section of the notebook and load peripheral knowledge into my working memory. Also, I've been working in a completely different mode for a few weeks: Seven Basic Plots is a blend of science, psychology, and spirituality. The subject of the slip box, on the other hand, is merely factual and aimed primarily at immediate use.
 In some distant future, I would like to conduct an empirical study on this issue. (Do you know some empirical knowledge?)]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[2022-02-12  I haven't touched Booker's current book Seven Basic Plots for a few weeks because I wanted to concentrate fully on the second edition of the notebook method. Today, I sat down to the book again. In doing so, it took me about 2h to get back into the subject matter enough to reach my usual level of productivity.
 That's two hours I didn't work at "optimal operating temperature".
 The reason it took me so long is related to the depth of the material. But there are additional requirements beyond the book. I have to orient myself in the appropriate section of the notebook and load peripheral knowledge into my working memory. Also, I've been working in a completely different mode for a few weeks: Seven Basic Plots is a blend of science, psychology, and spirituality. The subject of the slip box, on the other hand, is merely factual and aimed primarily at immediate use.
 In some distant future, I would like to conduct an empirical study on this issue. (Do you know some empirical knowledge?)]]></summary>

"TAB in new empty entry: In a new entry with no text yet, TAB cycles through reasonable levels." 
  
Is that different than the normal tab cycling? I can't find that TAB does anything different anywhere, other than normal cycling to me, but maybe I don't understand the context ("in a new entry with no text") or my org file is still too simple to demonstrate this function?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to write an implementation of the tabu search algorithm. Basically local search with a tabu list of recently visited states.
 To do this I need to mess around with parts of Haskell I have never touched before. Type classes.
 I want to generalise the algorithm to the point that the data that the algorithm operates on is completely invisible to the algorithm itself. Like a java interface I want something I can attach to an object type and say "this object is now compatible with this search algorithm".
 class TabuSt a where evaluate:: a -> Int type ST = (Int, [Int]) instance TabuSt ST where evaluate x = 0 
 That's a toy implementation. I define the type class TabuSt. I define a type alias ST. And I define the instance of the type class. I also define a function evaluate that takes a state and returns an integer evaluation of the state. Note that it does not compile.
 This is the error message "tabu.hs:12:10: error: • Illegal instance declaration for ‘TabuSt ST’ (All instance types must be of the form (T t1 ... tn) where T is not a synonym. Use TypeSynonymInstances if you want to disable this.) • In the instance declaration for ‘TabuSt ST’"
 Why does this not work?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all,
 I'm new here and to emacs, so sorry if I'm asking a repeated question or something just not acceptable for some reason.
 I've used vim for many years and then neovim for about two years. I am/was very happy with neovim's current state of plugins, ecosystem, lua configuration and vi's philosophy on editing text.
 However I've reached a point where I 
 A) have become very interested in lisp languages and
 B) realized that I would like a much more flexible and complete computing environment that goes beyond my text editor. 
 Funnily enough this problem was solved many years ago by the dark side (just a joke 🤣). So I'm pretty excited to dive into Emacs, learn all about it and I know today its exactly the tool Id like for the rest of my computing career.
 I wanted to ask however to other emacs users, especially ex-Vimmers if readily slapping evil on emacs to make myself comfortable (at least on the text editing side) can hinder me from learning all the ins and outs of emacs?
 I have grown very accustomed to vim's text editing experience. Its so precise and short. I'm very used to changing text with up to 3 or 4 keystrokes to a precision that is very hard to get out of. I mean this in the best of ways, I really like Emacs and am having a lot of fun learning it. I'm just asking to better understand how I should go about this. I'd imagine that the text editing part is such a minor attribute of the power of Emacs and what its capable of that maybe it wouldn't make a difference how one chooses to edit text.
 Thanks in advance 👍

 I've spent some time learning Elisp closures and lexical binding.
 Although the documentation is clear with simple examples, I needed to to play with other examples to get my bearings.
 As you might be interested, I share them with you :)
 The first section contains the info nodes and help corresponding to the examples.
 The second section shows 10 "basic" examples using lexical-binding, lambda, defun, let, lexical-let, setq and defvar.
 And the third section shows a more advanced example using lambda, let, dolist and defun.
 Have a nice day,
 ps: In the documentation, we can read "Lexical binding is also more compatible with concurrency, which was added to Emacs in version 26.1.".
 Is someone know why is this? And can you indicate me the files in the emacs source code where …]]></summary>

 I'm using Emacs-IPython-Notebook with Elpy. It was a struggle to find the right documentation to get an initial setup up and running, but, I finally got these tools working, and I'm very happy now that I can develop Jupyter Notebooks in Emacs.
 Anyways, my question has to do with being able to run Python/JavaScript Widgets in Emacs, specifically in Emacs-IPython-Notebook(and emacs-jupyter as well). I did try last year to run pywidgets in EIN, but it did not work. Anyways, I was reading a article in r/emacs a while back(I can't find it anymore, lol) about Emacs now being able run browser widgets. So that'd be great to get that working, so that I can run browser Widgets in Emacs.
 Could any of you enlighten me on this issue?
 Thanks in advance for the help.

I'm new on the forum but been reading the articles and the forum since I discovered ZK not long ago. I love it and it already changed my life and the way I work and the way I see what I do. I find the philosophy of it life changing.
Anyway, I have a question I can't find the answer too.
Quite some times I read articles that provide a step by step for something, and acronym immediately useful. I don't see how I can "put it in my own words". I could but I feel like it's spending time on stuff I really do understand and use. It's more like reminders of processes than "knowledge". The subject fits already into my train of thoughts and the stuff I'm working on.
What do you do with that kind of notes ? Do they go into the permanent folder ? Do they stay as some kind of literature notes ? How one would find those reminders / process / short tips in a ZK ?
Thanks]]></summary>

 Hi! I upgraded to org-roam v2 about two months ago after using v1 for a few months before that. I felt org-roam-server quite useful primarily for visualizing which ideas link to which others. However, I haven't felt the same introauitiveness with org-roam-ui (the server counterpart for v2). And the graph always seems too cluttered and rather difficult to use for purposes of idea-link visualization. Has anyone else felt this? Is it just a matter of getting used to?
 PS: org-roam-ui certainly is useful for checking nodes and obtaining a visually appealing overview of the personal knowledge base. But something feels off. I wonder if it is related to different coloring algorithms, wherein org-roam-server seems to color "daughter" nodes close to the parent node, especially if the parent node is a "hub", whereas org-roam-ui seems to use no such heuristic. Just a guess!

Also, fyi I decided to start with plain emacs since most tutorials and internet reference materials are based on this.
 My learning method:
  
Start with built in tutorial. Practice each command shown a few times. Do as much as I can each day. 5 min, 10 min, an hour, whatever. NEVER use the mouse to move the insertion point or switch windows! ALWAYS use standard keyboard commands.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Using Manjaro Cinnamon.
 So a few weeks ago, I built Emacs with support for background-only transparency (it's awesome btw). The build was a little buggy, but after building, I decided to install it using 'make install' - having followed some comments on this sub and elsewhere that the side-by-side install would work, since the default directory would be my 'local', separate to where Arch puts pacman packages (where my normal Emacs is) - for safety I used the prefix option and called it 'TRANemacs'.
 But the background-only transparency emacs remained a bit buggy so I decided to uninstall using 'make uninstall'. Upon running my normal emacs, everything seemed to work normally except that the Cinnamon task bar shows an empty icon where the Emacs logo should be. Further digging shows that emacs has a logo, but emacs-client (which I guess is what gets started) doesn't. I reinstalled emacs with pacman but there is no change.
 Further to that, worth noting that it seems like 'make uninstall' did not cleanly remove everything related to TRANemacs, but I don't think the files left behind (e.g. the site-lisp folder) are very important.
 I'm not great at solving this sort of problem. Might anyone know how can I return the logo to emacs? And how do I prevent multiple emacs installations from clobbering each other in future?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi All,
 ​
 I have a number of latex export classes defined in my init file like so:
 ``` (add-to-list 'org-latex-classes '("my-landscape" "\input{/home/user/.config/emacs/tex/class-my-landscape.tex} [NO-DEFAULT-PACKAGES] " ("\section{%s}" . "\section{%s}") ("\subsection{%s}" . "\subsection{%s}")))
 ``` As you can see, I include another tex file as a preamble and that works quite well.
 However, I would like to get to work on a landscape A4 multiple column class and for this it is suggested one uses \usepackage{multicols} in the preamble, easy enough added to the .tex file. 
 And here is where it gets tricky, one needs to add the line \begin{multicols}{3} after \begin{document} and \end{multicols*} before \end\document}. This is proving to be not trivial to set up for me.
 Does anybody have tips and or suggestions on how to tackle this issue ?
 thx S

This correspondence is known as the Curry-Howard-Lambek correspondence and relates:
  
Haskell types with objects of the category
 
Terms of type A→B with morphisms f:A→B (note the similar notations)
 
Algebraic datatypes with initial objects
 
Type constructors with functors
 
etc
 
  
What are algebraic datatypes in Haskell? (I thought all types, including those types defined by datatype, newtype, or type, and/or those types provided by the language and by the standard library modules, are algebraic datatypes. So I think I was wrong.)
 Is the concept "abstract datatype" the same to all the programming languages?
 How are algebraic datatypes related with initial objects?
 Thanks.

 It seems to target an old version of Alex though, as when building I get a bunch of compiler errors.
 Here is my code: https://paste.tomsmeding.com/yn3JWSrhAnd these are the errors I get: https://paste.tomsmeding.com/fTZhuGeTAlex version 3.2.6
 Also, when writing monadic parsers / lexers, should I still use the monad wrapper if I define my own monad type?
 Any help appreciated

It would contain music maybe starting slow and crescendoing throughout the commercial. Short scenes of individuals doing crazy complicated physical, artful, skillful /r/nextlevel kind of stuff, interspersed with crazy text on a screen moving around (typical org mode stuff, LaTeX editing, etc.), matrix looking stuff, more individuals performing high precision things, etc. Building up, and then ending with a finale and "Emacs" with logo on the screen. Fade to black. 
 I've read a few posts here and there about the need to get more people into Emacs. They usually focus on "how to change emacs to appeal to a wider audience". I'm not going to touch that subject, but simple marketing can be powerful. When I search google for "Emacs Commercial" I get a grand total of 20 results (none of which is a commercial). Youtube returns zero.
 Surely there's some skillful people out there, passionate about Emacs, who would also like to work on or collaborate on a few commercials? I could see another commercial that has testimonials from people.
 FYI, I'm an emacs newbie, and am excited about learning it. Apologies in advance if this isn't a good idea or if this kind of post doesn't belong here.

 I often need to act with Embark not on the symbol or plain value, but rather on the result of its evaluation. For example I'd like to be able to open the value of user-emacs-directory by using embark-act on this symbol. Is there some trick I've missed?
 I tried using M-: after embark-act as it could work as a workaround, but I didn't find a way to make it ask me to edit the resulting expression either.
 Could someone nudge me in the right direction? An info how to force embark to show me an interactive prompt for some commands (like it already does OOTB for some) would be a nice bonus.
 EDIT: It seems the latter is possible by customizing embark-target-injection-hooks (link). I correctly remembered there was a variable directly controlling this behavior but it was removed since then, hence why I couldn't find it anymore.

 The org file SRD
 The dnd-mode
 The documentation in these is lacking still, but I plan on adding more information about usage. Until then, if anyone would like to try it out they are welcome to ask questions to get up and running. Right now the mode has a dependency on 'org-mode' and 'yasnippet'. It is also expecting that the repos be cloned to your '~' directory by default (you can change it if you want).
 I do not currently have an examaple of a campaign, because I only have paid for campaigns setup for my personal. If anyone wants to provide a small campaign they made I would add it as an example, I sadly don't have one at the ready right now, however. 
 Again, I am happy to answer questions if anyone wants to try it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I love Org's date parsing abilities and often don't even glance at the calendar that pops up, but occasionally I scroll through the calendar (with < and > or M-v and C-v) a bit before typing a date and it always surprises me that when I press RET the timestamp Org inserts is the date that was selected in the calendar and not the result of parsing what I typed!
 It seems that if you want Org to parse the date you type you cannot interact with the calendar pop up at all, which I find a little frustrating. Is there an easy way to tell Org "forget I scrolled the calendar a bit, use the date I'm typing?".

Evaluating SKI combinators as native Haskell functions by Thomas Mahler
In this post I present an alternative approach to combinator-based implementation of functional languages that is significantly faster than classical graph-reduction based solutions.
Every Distributive is Representable by Daniel Mlot
At first glance, Distributive, the dual to Traversable, appears to have little if anything to do with Representable, the class for functors isomorphic to functions.

 Here is the list
  progLanguages = [ ("CptS121" , ["C"]), ("CptS122" , ["C++"]), ("CptS223" , ["C++"]), ("CptS233" , ["Java"]), ("CptS321" , ["C#"]), ("CptS322" , ["Python", "JavaScript"]), ("CptS355" , ["Haskell", "Python", "PostScript", "Java"]), ("CptS360" , ["C"]), ("CptS370" , ["Java"]), ("CptS315" , ["Python"]), ("CptS411" , ["C", "C++"]), ("CptS451" , ["Python", "C#", "SQL"]), ("CptS475" , ["Python", "R"]) ] 
 It needs to be compatible with the following
  The type of the max_count function should be compatible with one of the following: max_count :: [(a1, [a2])] -> (a1, Int) max_count :: Foldable t => [(a1, t a2)] -> (a1, Int) 
 So far, I have attempted the following code
  max_count [] = error "bad" max_count [x] = x max_count (x:xs) = x max_helper (max_count xs) where max_helper (a,b) (a',b') | length b > length b' = (a, length b) | otherwise = (a', length b') 
 This has not worked in the slightest, and I am at a blank for what to do. Any help is appreciated.

 I am trying to minimize reliance on Rosetta, since I've read nasty things happen when combining x86 and ARM toolchains. As a result, I’d like to upgrade my project to GHC 8.10.7 to take advantage of the ARM-native binary. Eventually, I'd like to migrate this project to Cabal, because HLS and Stack don't play well together in test files.

It makes use of the parser of GHC itself, so as to prevent parsing issues that unfortunately some other Haskell formatters have.
Alexander Esgen detailed several improvements he made to Ormolu during his internship in a previous blog post. In turn, this blog post will be focusing on the challenge of formatting infix operator chains in Haskell, which is notoriously difficult and has been my primary goal for the last two months.

Operator chains
Almost all programming languages allow the use of infix operators, especially for the four basic numeric operators, +, -, * and /. Moreover, most of the time, these operators can be “chained” together without parenthe…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[UPDATED: I have modified the example to remove any dependency on external packages.
 I must be misunderstanding something quite basic here, so I'll ask this question in the hopes that someone can spot the error. I may have to dig deeper otherwise, but I'm somehow thinking the issue is fairly superficial and I'm just not seeing it. 
 Consider the following function: 
  (defun my/test-let-fun () (interactive) (let* ((var "Hello")) (print var) (if (bound-and-true-p var) (print "Yes.") (print "No.")))) 
 I add this to my config, and the following happens when I call the function.
  
In the minibuffer, I see "Hello." followed by "No."
  
What I take from this is that (bound-and-true-p var) must be returning nil, since otherwise I should see "Yes." So, I conclude: 
  
The variable var must either be unbound or have a nil value during the evaluation of the body of the let* expression.
 The variable var is bound to a non-nil value, since otherwise, I couldn't get something other than nil as the output of (print var).
  
But these two things cannot be true together!
 Am I misinterpreting what's going on? 
 If I am not, how can this be? Is there some other way to check if the value of a variable is non-nil? 
 Puzzlingly, if I define the function after starting Emacs (by calling eval-last-sexp, say), it works as I expect. (I see "Hello" followed by "Yes.")

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I would appreciate advice about the following. I am currently using Embark, Consult, Orderless (and Marginalia).
 Desired action: I have a current buffer open that is 'A'. I want to switch to a different buffer 'B' (which may be anywhere), but I actually want to search buffer B and maybe copy some results over to the current buffer. This could be using consult-line or occur.
 How I am going about the above: 
  
switch buffer (consult-buffer) 
 
Hit embark-act on the desired buffer (bound to C-. as default)
 
Choose either C-s (embark-isearch) or C and l for consult-line 
 
However - the search chosen above always takes place on the current buffer A. I want to act on Buffer B that I chose in the minibuffer.
 
 My config for these packages is pretty vanilla, mostly borrowed off the README's of these packages with some functions stolen from the authors of the packages.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'd like to have my packages be 'fixed' to a specific version, and furthermore available via cloning my emacs git repository. The latter is a function of the fact that I sometimes work in (Windows) environments where emacs will seemingly not work under the proxy no matter what I try. That's fine, in those environments I don't really need emacs connecting to the internet.
 But then, what package strategy to use? The only one that seems to somewhat fit the bill is Borg: however,
  
It uses submodules, and I reaaaaally don't want submodules. I'd much rather use subtrees to commit in particular packages.
 There is no dependency management via this route whatsoever. I've played around with epkg, but there doesn't seem to be a particularly good way of managing dependencies-of-dependencies, unless I'm missing something obvious?
  
Does anyone else have a subtree leveraging workflow and have a relatively sane way of figuring out package dependencies?

The idea behind the fork is to enable a way to submit and incorporate suggestions for edits and updates for LYAH from the community as Haskell evolves and changes.

 I just want to be able to look at my org-mode files from my phone or tablet. I don't, right now, need to sync my agenda or anything like that -- mostly I just want to check my class notes and syllabus before I start reading to prep for lecture or seminar. 
 All my work files are synced via dropbox, so ideally it would be just a simple file reader that I can set so that org files "open with" that app from the dropbox app. Orgzly doesn't seem to be able to do that, though it's true that I can sync specific dropbox folders and access them from there. But mostly I'm going to be clicking on links, etc, rather than editing, and orgzly isn't ideal for that. 
 So: anyone have a good solution? Thanks!

My only emacs experience was an assembly course that I took many many years back that for some reason required it. Just over a year ago, I think, I started making a move to using org-mode for my to do lists. I started using templates and creating journal entries all in org. Then I moved into using org-roam for my notes at work and that morphed into using org-dailies and time tracking. With org-mode, I started moving all my ideas and things I wanted to remember, lists of books I'm reading or want to read. It goes on and on and it's all organized in one nice neat (well, a little messy but relatively neat) little package. 
 Just wanted to share my appreciation for org-mode (and org-roam!) and for the community!

I'm lately getting ^M characters before the line feed whenever I paste (that is, yank) from certain applications. I especially notice gnome-terminal, and pdf text content copied from evince. Google suggests it's a text encoding issue, but I created a new buffer, confirmed that buffer-file-coding-system is set to utf-8-unix, and also checked that gnome-terminal encoding is set to utf-8 (don't know how to check in evince).The problem still persists. Yank is of course written in C so I can't run edebug on it, and anyway I wouldn't really know what to look for. 
  
Any suggestions for how to track this down? It is relatively new, but I am not sure *exactly* how long it's been going on.
 If I can't fix it, shouldn't I be able to somehow filter the text in the kill-ring so that the "M" characters are removed before being inserted?
  
Thanks everyone!

 I want to search the full text of the files for all the terms of the input (terms separated by spaces), no matter where in the file they are or in what order. 
 So, if I search for "apple banana", I want to find a file where "banana" is on line 1 and "apple" is on line 15. Since pretty much all search tools are line-oriented and/or keep the order of the terms and/or use 'OR' matching instead of 'AND' matching, I came up with a way to do what I want via a series of pipes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My working method is similar to what @pgrhowarth has described here: In short, I always have to refer back to the original sources, in addition to my own ideas and conclusions. And this is not a personal choice, but a requirement of my profession.  But the "output" of a Zettelkasten, as far as I understand it, is a chain of associations of my own ideas, not some kind of source Wiki.
But I need both and more: on the one hand, I need to relate my sources to each other, i.e. "who quoted whom", "who learned from whom", "who wrote letters with whom", etc and all based on the originals. On the other hand, I want to process my ideas and thoughts on quotations, excerpts, themes, etc. in a Zettelkasten. But beyond that, I need to make sure that my Zettel always refer to the sources from which they are inspired.
The question I have is: what is the best way to do this? Do I need two "boxes", one for the verbatim quotes with sources and a proper Zettelkasten for my ideas? If so, how do I connect the two boxes? Or should I do "double bookkeeping" and always write the original quote and source on each Zettel?
To reiterate: I know how a wiki works, and I think I also know how to set up a Zettelkasten; what is not yet clear to me is how to connect these two systems.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I currently develop a little tool in which I would like to provide a temporarily visible help buffer containing cheat-sheet like content. And that content might be actually huge, so the user should be able to navigate the buffer.
 I plan to provide user options how and where that cheat-sheet might be shown (own frame, single windows with restoring current-window-configuration after close, side window left, right, top, bottom). My personal preference would be to open a new bottom window, as which-key does this for keybindings.
 The cheat-sheet mode would org, probably with a minor mode so that it is read only and can be closed with a single keystroke. I even think about using org-view-mode...
 Now my question is, what would be the best way to create and place the buffer? Shall I do it manually using basically split-window? Or is there something usable, probably the *Help*-buffers functionality as an official api? Or is it better to just create and show the buffer and let the user configure how to place it via display-buffer-alist?

It pretty big number of people who left in such a short period of time. So does anyone know what is happening, would be nice even if someone from Lightbend can explain this if their employees are here on Reddit?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[hi all,
 i have started using wucuo for spell checking. my configuration is pretty straightforward
 (use-package wucuo :ensure t :config ;; ------------------------------------------------------------------------- ;; spell checking via `aspell' (setq ispell-program-name "aspell") (setq ispell-extra-args '("--sug-mode=ultra" "--lang=en_US" "--run-together" "--run-together-limit=16")) ;; ------------------------------------------------------------------------- ;; disable spell checking in some major-modes (setq wucuo-spell-check-buffer-predicate (lambda () (not (memq major-mode '(dired-mode log-edit-mode compilation-mode help-mode profiler-report-mode speedbar-mode gud-mode calc-mode Info-mode))))) :hook (prog-mode . wucuo-start) (text-mode . wucuo-start) ) 
 this starts the spell checking as expected, and that works too. however, for source code buffers, i would like to run spell checker on comments only and not on the code itself. how do i do that ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just started learning emacs (macport) about 10 days ago, Avy is the first package I've installed. So I have some questions.
 FIRST QUESTION Was there a particular reason for Oleh Krehel to suggest binding avy-goto-char to C-: instead of C-;? Since C-; doesn't require the shift key, that would be seem to be a preferred binding for frequent navigation. (Perhaps colon C-; conflicts with some other popular binding?)
 SECOND ISSUE He suggests (from https://github.com/abo-abo/avy) possibly setting up default bindings using 
  
(avy-setup-default) 
  
But that doesn't seem to work for me. C-h b C-x o C-s avy fails to find anything.
 THIRD ISSUE [EDIT: ISSUE RESOLVED, THIS IS USED TO INTEGRATE AVY WITHIN AN ISEARCH.] Here's a snippet from the documentation, I don't understand this:
  
(global-set-key (kbd "C-c C-j") 'avy-resume)
 It will bind, for example, avy-isearch to C-' in isearch-mode-map, so that you can select one of the currently visible isearch candidates using avy.
  
How does binding to C-c C-j do anything to C-'? And what is isearch-mode-map? That function doesn't seem to exist in my beginner level emacs. What does avy-resume do? I don't understand any of this.
 FYI This is what I finally put into my .init.el file to get Avy to work:
 ;;; AVY BINDINGS https://github.com/abo-abo/avy ;; doesn't seem to work ;;(avy-setup-default) ;; not sure what this does ;;(global-set-key (kbd "C-c C-j") 'avy-resume) ;; Suggested bindings from avy github docs (global-set-key (kbd "C-:") 'avy-goto-char) (global-set-key (kbd "C-'") 'avy-goto-char-2) (global-set-key (kbd "M-g f") 'avy-goto-line) (global-set-key (kbd "M-g w") 'avy-goto-word-1) (global-set-key (kbd "M-g e") 'avy-goto-word-0)

 I want to do this in both latex and org buffers, which use two different functions/features for this (preview-latex and org-latex-preview). If using dvipng (as opposed to to the dvisvgm method) I'm not looking to regenerate the previews at the new size, it's OK if it stretches out the images when increasing the text scale.

The part that I can remember ​ case class Node[T](v: T, left: Option[Node[T]]=None, right: Option[Node[T]]=Node) { def map[R](f: T => R): R = f(v) def flatten = ... // flatten def flatMap = ... // which combines map and flatten } But I can't remember the part about flatten (the problem I suppose is I don't know what I want to flatten for that ⠀Node object), and then flatMap. Any hint or suggestions on this? I suppose this can help me learn a lesson by implementing the code. Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Background: I'm fairly new to Haskell, I can use the language but I am very unfamiliar with the overall build tooling. I largely just use what is recommended in my work project.
 So I got a new M1Pro. I'm the second on my team to do so. They were able to build everything just fine after some minor adjustments, but I have had problem after problem... and I'm stumped, so I'm turning to you for help.
 The project I'm trying to build is open source (https://github.com/fossas/fossa-cli). When I got this new system set up, I ran the instructions on our HACKING.md page and immediately tried to build. This failed because I didn't have llvm installed, so I brew install llvm'd, symlinked into $PATH, and tried again. This failed due to:
 install_name_tool: error: unsupported load command (cmd=0x80000034) `install_name_tool' failed in phase `Install Name Tool'. (Exit code: 1) 
 My teammate who has the M1 already and I compared notes, and he found that he had installed llvm@12. So I removed llvm and its $PATH symlink, installed llvm@12, installed its symlink, and now it compiles! Yay!
 ... But I can't link. I'm now failing on this:
 Building library for byteorder-1.0.4.. [1 of 1] Compiling System.ByteOrder ( System/ByteOrder.hs, dist/build/System/ByteOrder.o, dist/build/System/ByteOrder.dyn_o ) ar: @/dist/build/objs-29886/ar29886-2.rsp: No such file or directory 
 We found a post where someone had a similar issue (here), but the fix in that issue doesn't help: using ar from binutils causes link errors like this instead:
 Linking dist/build/hspec-discover/hspec-discover ... ld: warning: ignoring file /Users/kit/.cabal/store/ghc-8.10.7/hspc-dscvr-2.8.5-ab243a40/lib/libHShspc-dscvr-2.8.5-ab243a40.a, building for macOS-arm64 but attempting to link with file built for macOS-arm64 
 So I'm kinda lost at this point and hoping someone has tips. If you read this far, thanks for your time!

Does it mean that an instance of Monad is also an instance of Applicative? I was wondering how to see an instance of Monad is an instance of Applicative? Can <*> of Applicative be rewritten in terms of >>= and return of Monad?
 
Is an instance of Monad also an instance of Functor? Can fmap of Functor be rewritten in terms of >>= and return of Monad?
 
 Thanks.

 Although most posts about "cabal hell" seem to be almost a decade old I can't really find if anything has changed to abolish it. The closest I've read is someone somewhere mentioning Nix as an alternative to Cabal; is that Nix as in NixOS? Are people really using a system package manager to manage their Haskell packages, or have I completely missed the point? Separate from Nix, is Cabal good now or should I stay away?

 Question regarding where to place (package-refresh-contents)
  
 (unless (package-installed-p 'use-package) 
 (package-refresh-contents) 
 (package-install 'use-package))
  
currently i have this... but in this, (package-refresh-contents) will basically only ran once EVER - during the initial setup, since that's the only time the system will not have use-package installed. should i perhaps place that line before (unless (package-installed-p 'use-package)? so that it is run everytime when i start up emacs? there's pros and cons to this right? the pro is that, the package cache/info will be up to date everytime and i can just install packages right away through the commands as the package repos will be all up to date already... the cons is that, i doing so, it will dramatically slow down the startup time 'cuz emacs will spend a lot of time updating the package cache right? and this is probably not worth it since we typically want to run package-list-package interactively anyway when we want to look for packages interactively and it will update the cache at that time anyway

 I thought before I set myself into the indentation rabbit hole, maybe someone knows a package or a sipmle setting to set. Up to now I have been using from time to time haskell-indentation-mode but sometimes it screws some other indentation in the relevant programming language and I would really only "need it" for some comma separated special cases.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I read here that defvar only sets the value of a variable if it doesn't already have a value. 
 Then I tried to test it in scratch buffer, but could not verify that. defvar always sets the value no matter what. 
 Did some googling, found some stackover flow answers stating the same. 
 Got quite confused for quite some time. 
 Then decided to read elisp mannal, found this: 
  When you evaluate a top-level ‘defvar’ form with ‘C-M-x’ (‘eval-defun’) or with ‘C-x C-e’ (‘eval-last-sexp’) in Emacs Lisp mode, a special feature of these two commands arranges to set the variable unconditionally, without testing whether its value is void. 
 relieved. Isn't this a bit strange? That it doesn't work the same way when you want to test it out by C-x C-e

Each project comes with its own budget I need to keep track of, with a number of deadlines, but most importantly with a lot of back-and-forth, with reminding people via email, phone, or slack that their contributions are due. 
 All of these projects come with quaterly reports I have to write up. They include presentations and workshops or conferences. I can delegate some of the stuff, but I have to keep the overview at all times.
 Oh, and I have to keep track of the time i spend with each subtask. 
 So, I am actually trying to do this in orgmode. Has anybody done something similar and can share their insights, experiences or a template?
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've recently started playing more DnD and convinced a co-worker to join me in both that and emacs. As a result of this I thought it would be fun to try to create a robust and interactive DnD environment inside of emacs.
 I have been working on my environment for a about three weeks now and have come up with a pretty good org file character sheet layout that uses table formulas to auto calculate everything based of the abilities that are defined.
 I have also been creating function to toggle my session target (a campaign or a character) to switch where my org-agenda and org-captures point so that I can leverage the searching and quick note taking that those provide.
 In addition to that I have been converting the SRD docs that I can find into ORG files that I can also search via org-agenda. Leveraging tags and properties to create queryable resources.
 ​
 I plan on creating a demo of this environment and sharing it, but that will require a decent amount of work. So, I was wondering what the interest would be in this crossover tool, or if people have solutions that they have developed for this.
 ​
 EDIT 1: Screen Capture of Character Creation
 ​
 Sorry, I noticed i missed the mini-buffer on the recording. The only relevant part was the dice roll at the end though for it. I also forgot to show the proficiency bonus column adds the PB as well. 
 ​
 EDIT 2: Searching the org file SRDs
 Sorry for the little windows. The tool I'm using for recording doesn't give me many pixels :|

You should replace the system-name values with what you get when you evaluate (system-name) in your copy of Emacs. 
  
Whats the best way to do that? Use C-h v? Is there another way? 
 Regardless, one thing I'd like to be able to do (just to know if it's possible) is highlight that web text, copy to the MacOS cut-and-past buffer, then in emacs, C-h v and it prompts me Describe Variable:. Is there a way to just paste/yank the name at that point? C-y didn't work before, but now it does, so this use-case is solved.
 In another use-case, suppose I might have the variable name in my emacs buffer/window, with point on the variable name. Is there a way to "send" what's under the point to C-h v for quick inspection?
 Or another way to "evaluate" the variable so that I can see what it is?
 I'm currently using Ido, if that matters. I'm also very new to emacs!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I wrote a program to find the nth prime number between 1 and 100,005, using the Sieve of Eratosthenes. For example, the first prime number is 1, the second is 2, and the third is 3.
 Here's my program:
 -- Get a range of list of numbers from begin to end, inclusive.range :: Integer -> Integer -> [Integer]range begin end | end == 0 = [begin] | begin >= end = [end] | otherwise = begin : range (begin + 1) endcheckNotMultiple :: Integral a => a -> a -> BoolcheckNotMultiple a b = r > 0 || q < 2where (q, r) = divMod b aeliminateMultiplesOfP :: Integral a => [a] -> a -> [a]eliminateMultiplesOfP list p = filter (checkNotMultiple p) listeliminateMultiples :: Integral a1 => [a1] -> [a1]eliminateMultiples list | length list > 1 = head list : eliminateMultiples (eliminateMultiplesOfP (tail list) (head list)) | otherwise = list-- Sieve of EratosthenesgetNthPrime :: Int -> IntegergetNthPrime n = (1 : eliminateMultiples (range 2 100005)) !! (n-1)
 As n increases, so does the time the program takes to access the nth element of the list. Why, and what can I do to make this not true?
 Hazarding a guess: Maybe GHC is smart enough to realize that it shouldn't run eliminateMultiples on the entire list, despite what the code says, because I really only care about one element of the resulting array.
 EDIT: I should clarify that I don't count a number as a multiple of itself.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi haskell folk, thought I'd share this with you.
 For a workshop I am planning I want to ensure that everyone has a quick haskell development setup available, so I created a simple docker image based on haskell's official image. This one includes code-server as a vs-code web IDE.
 The image can be found on docker hub and launched like so, assuming $PWD/code is where your haskell projects are: docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 -v $PWD/code:/exercises arnemcnuggets/hs-workshop Notice that the default directory (currently /exercises) can be adjusted by changing the entry-point cmd (currently it's code-server --auth none --bind-addr 0.0.0.0:8080 --user-data-dir /data /exercises).
 You can then navigate your browser to localhost:8080 and start programming haskell with linting, type hints and formatting.
 The environment is, of course, by no means to be used in production but rather for education.
 This is kind of the first docker contribution I made so feedback is welcome!
 Edit: it comes with dark-theme (my eyes) and the haskell vs-code extension preinstalled for extra little configuration.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just playing around with a tiny project, I've found that using HSpec with cabal repl would be really really nice. You could call main to run all the tests, or call hspec XyzSpec.spec to run just the tests you currently care about.
 Problem is that GHCi can only load one component at a time. That means I can't do :r to reload code changes that aren't in the test component. If I'm changing library code, then restarting the repl from Cabal all the time isn't convenient as it is slow.
 As a hacky solution, if I add the library's src dir to my test's hs-source-dirs then it works really nicely. Things reload very quickly. But once you start needing build dependencies in the library, you also need to add them to the test project. This starts to feel a bit messy, build tools for other languages don't require hacks like this.
 Is there a better way to do this? I know there's stack test --file-watch but this is very slow. I'm looking to to make tiny changes rapidly, and the time it makes you wait while it builds the project over and over is inconvenient when compared to the instant reloading in GHCi.

 Org-view should now also work in older versions than the current master :).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is the first production release of Scalqa project. 
 Scalqa was first introduced on Reddit last summer with the "Scala3 Quick API" post. Few more discussions followed:
  
Perfect Int Loop
 Perfect Time Library
 Boost data processing speed with heavy ops
  Void Request Pattern
  GUI Could Be Easy
  Creating New Numerical Types
  
So the feature set was pretty much complete long time ago and it took many months to refactor, refactor, and refactor. At this stage there are no good ideas on how the project can be improved any more, so it is time to stabilize the code base. From now on the future releases will be binary compatible with version 1.0 and any large changes will be rejected unless absolutely necessary.
 Maintenance wise, based on experience, I expect to spend from 1 to 4 hours a week to fix any incoming bugs and make a new release every 1-3 months. Otherwise, I will move on to invest/trade markets full time, using Scalqa as enabling technology. But, I am standing by to devote all my energy back to Scalqa if needed.

 I'm using LSP-mode for C++ and I can't find how to pass arguments to clang-tidy. It's annoying because I'd like to use C++17 functionalities which flycheck flags as illegal (though they are not). 
 My config does have (lsp-clients-clangd-args '("--clang-tidy")) but I don't know how to pass arguments to clang-tidy, through clangd.
 Any combination I could think of, of '("--clang-tidy --std=c++17"), '("--clang-tidy" "--std=c++17"), '("--clang-tidy -extra-arg=-std=c++17"),... failed. 
 I thought about using a .clang-tidy file instead but there's no example of such a file in the clang-tidy docs. 
 Any help would be appreciated! 
 P.S: This issue can be reproduced with any post C++17 feature, such as std::optional.

 I would like to be able to get some more copies as presents, etc... but cannot find it being sold anywhere anymore... (I got it quite a number of years ago sadly) Does anyone have any ideas where I might be able to find this t-shirt for sale, or track down the designer?
 ​
 For those looking, I finally found this t-shirt: https://www.cafepress.com/mf/91716131/_tshirt?productId=1342277923
