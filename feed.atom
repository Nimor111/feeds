        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Why oh why has Emacs stopped using my preferred face (Iosevka) after updating from 27.2 to 28.1 (both self-built)? Is it something to do with xft and/or Cairo? If so, how do I fix it?
 I found that I could get to something that was at least readable with:
 (set-face-attribute 'default nil :family "Hack" :height 160 :weight 'normal :width 'normal) 
 and customizing typeface default to use Hack, but even this seems to come and go, apparently each time I focus a different frame (WTF?!), leaving an unreadable mess of widely spaced characters. 
 Hack is a face I used to use, still installed. Kinda sorta good enough to be getting on with, so long as Emacs doesn't keep forgetting, but not what I want and specified.
 Daemon mode, running on up-to-date Manjaro under StumpWM.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I frequently will open Emacs with a large number of files, such as something like emacs $(grep -r something *). From there I'll work on a file, close it, and work on the next one. Is there a way to tell Emacs to send all of the special buffers such as scratch, Messages, lsp buffers (for clangd), etc to the end of the buffer list? Right now, as I'm working on files, those are interspersed through out the list of buffers, so I have to skip over them as I encounter them. It's not a big deal, but it's rather annoying.
 Along the same lines, is it possible to keep lsp-mode from opening buffers for clangd unless an error or something occurs that I actually need to know about?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, I am using treemacs to display my directories in a big project. I have treemacs spawned on the left window, then everything else belong to that directory can be launched on the right window, i.e. you press Enter on treemacs and it opens on the right. 
 This works but whenever I need to open up another file in a different directory, treemacs automatically change its path. 
 Eg. say I have treemacs open ~/myproject folder: I achieve this by open a file in ~/myproject and then launch treemacs. Now, if I open a different file in a different directory like ~/Desktop and my cursor is on that file, treemacs will then show whatever I have in ~/Desktop. Of course, if I focus my cursor on the file in ~/myproject, treemacs will show my project stuff again. 
 This flickering is quite distracting with big project, and sometimes you just want to open a random unrelated file. 
 Is there a different tree app or a settings in treemacs that does this?
 Please let me know.

 If I open the project in terminal under the project folder, it can work perfectly.
 What wrong in the GUI tool?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I'm having a problem with M-x diff-buffers, in that I have two buffers which are definitely different, and calling diff-buffers on the two of them returns that they are identical. 
 How should I go about troubleshooting this issue? It seems like it's writing the contents to two temp files and then diffing these two files, and I'm not familiar with debugging elisp at all [tracing functions? inspecting stuff that's running?]. Is there a way to get to the bottom of this which doesn't involve learning how to debug elisp and debugging diff?
 Thanks in advance, sorry if the problem is badly posed.

 I wonder if someone here knows of a strategy for keeping window splits sane, perhaps by designating a window for visiting these sorts of things, or by limiting the number/width of windows in a frame. 
 Emacs being what it is, I'm *sure* a solution has been invented, but I haven't been able to find it in my searching so far.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's great that C-n/C-p (n/p) are "standard" bindings for moving up and down lines/lists/etc. across many modes. But there are many situations where you aren't navigating a flat list, but rather a "tree" of information, with more than one depth level. E.g. code (lispy and friends, many programming modes, tree-sitter structural editing), collapsable sections (e.g. magit), nested outlines (org), heading outlines (outshine), etc. Here, the different modes all seem to define different navigation commands and bindings.
 It would be wonderful if there were a set of "standard" bindings for tree-movement: 
  
among siblings at the same level (j,k in lispy; b, f with org-speed commands)
 up a level forward/backward (h,l in lispy; u with org-speed)
 to the next/previous thing in the tree regardless of level (f from either "side" of an sexp in lispy, p, n with org speed commands).
 
 Probably too late to find any common set of keys that would work across existing modes, but it would still be nice to have a consistent set going forward. Opinions? Anyone find the same mismatch and come up with a workable solution?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm new to FRP and am trying to learn rhine so I apologize if I'm missing something obvious. I'm trying to figure out control flow. I get stdin, and throw an exception if the input is "q". Otherwise I just print it back. ``` checkInput :: Monad m => ClSF (ExceptT String m) cl String String checkInput = proc str -> do throwOn' -< (str == "q" || str == "Hello", str) returnA -< str
 checkPrint :: ClSF (ExceptT String IO) StdinClock () () checkPrint = tagS >>> checkInput >>> runClSFExcept (safe (arrMCl putStrLn))
 checkUseInput :: ClSFExcept IO StdinClock () () Empty checkUseInput = do str <- try checkPrint case str of "q" -> once_ exitSuccess "Hello" -> do once_ $ putStrLn "Hi!" checkUseInput _ -> once_ exitFailure
 main = flow $ (safely checkUseInput) @@ StdinClock ``` This code successfully prints back user input, and quits when I input "q". But when I input "Hello", "Hi!" is printed repeatedly and I cannot input anything. I would expect "Hi!" to be printed once and then for it to wait for user input again.
 I thought the printing of "Hi!" might be getting picked up by "tagS", so I tried flushing, but that didn't work. I also tried changing the printed string to "q", thinking that if "tagS" was picking up the printed line, it would go through the loop and throw the exception with "q", then quiting the program. This was not the case either. Thanks for any help!

The game is fully written in Haskell, using the CodeWorld modules. Here's the Github repo, and the suggested way to play the game is using the featured link in the README: https://github.com/Pedro-V/naves-codeworld
 Since I wrote the game mainly wth my brazilian peers, the documentation is in portuguese. But the game's source code is comprehensible to anyone familiar with Haskell's registers and function compositions.
  
U can use WASD for the first ship
 And Up/Left/Right/Down keys for the second one.
 A ship will be destroyed if it hits an asteroid or if it gets hit by more than 10 shots

 This however, created a problem - If I modify the org buffer in emacs, don't write it into a file and then also modify the file externally (through syncthing), revert-buffer just asks if I want to throw away changes and reload or not. Few times I also got an option C-r (I believe it was called rebase buffer) that reverted the buffer AND reapplied my changes. 
 My question is: Do you know how is this C-r option triggered or how I could recreate it? I am looking for a way to do something similar to git rebase: take changes made to a file, update the file to new version and reapply those changes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've got two questions rolling around today and I can't seem to sort either of them. First, I'm trying to setup my home emacs configuration based (loosely) on my work configuration, but doing it entirely through use-package instead of the Emacs package management. As a result, I'm not entirely sure dependencies are being installed though I understand they ought to be. In any event I've got a behavior on my work machine that I have not yet been able to get on my home machine, namely when I start typing a path in a string, I get completion on it based on the filesystem. Here's a picture, hopefully. 
 In any event, I have company and company-statistics installed in both locations but I don't think that's what's doing the file completion suggestions. Any ideas what is causing that? 
 Second question, there is a package that has a built-in version installed, however the gnu repository has a more recent version. If I use use-package to install, it says the package is already installed. Is there a way to force it to update if there's a newer version, or something along those lines? I am new to use-package and really haven't gotten the full swing of it yet. I also have a newer version that I just had to download from a site and in the past have just used adding a directory onto load-path and then (require '<package name>) which works, but would be interesting to sort out whether that behavior can be done with use-package as well as a shortcut.
 Anyhow, any help greatly appreciated!

 New to Emacs and not a programmer. I can't invest in learning emacs in entirety at this time but I've begun using org-mode and really liking it. I will invest more as I find time. Currently, only one thing bugs me: Emacs looks terrible. 
 All the customization posts and resources are in-depth. I only want a better look. I don't want anything else, no keybindings nothing. Just regular emacs/org-mode that looks nicer (e.g., a dark theme, some prettier font maybe, etc.). 
 So, I want to borrow someone else's minimal (just better looks) customization. I don't know how to implement it but I hope it's just a matter of replacing a vanilla file with the borrowed one or pasting some code in one of the vanilla files. 
 Believe me I'm trying to learn it all but in my current workload there's like several years before I can get to the point of customizing it myself. Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've recently upgraded my org-mode from 9.1.5 to 9.5.3 - somewhere along the way the LaTeX exporter seems to have changed to always create a table environment around org-mode tables (I think the old behaviour was to only create that when captions were specified. This:
 #+NAME: total-bill #+ATTR_LATEX: :center nil | Hours at EUR 71.40 | 65 | 4641.00 | | VAT 24%: | | 1113.84 | |--------------------+----+---------| | Total: | | 5754.84 | #+TBLFM: @1$3=@1$2*71.40;%.2f::@2$3=@1$3*24%;%.2f::@3$3=@1$3*(1+24%);%.2f #+LATEX: \hfill 
 now creates this:
 \begin{table}[htbp] \label{tab:org24fa42b} \begin{tabular}{lrr} Hours at EUR 71.40 & 65 & 4641.00\\ VAT 24\%: & & 1113.84\\ \hline Total: & & 5754.84\\ \end{tabular} \end{table} \hfill 
 The problem is that only some document classes define a table environment - and I can't find any way to disable generating it.
 The org-manual section about exporting tables has two options which initially look helpful, but are not useful in the end. :mode does change the table container, but doesn't have an option to switch it off, and all the other options make things worse. :environment is for the table contents, i.e., doesn't touch the table environment (as you might think from the description), but replaces the tabular environment with something else.
 I also didn't find obvious hints in the export backend code - any ideas how I can get rid of the tables?

Just wondering if anyone else has had any luck with centering or justifying latex previews in org mode? 
 Scimax users - is this working out of the box for you? I'm using doom and wondering if there is some conflict going on that I haven't found. 
 u/tecosaur have you had any luck with this?

A complete overhaul of GHC’s Windows support. This includes a migration to a fully Clang-based C toolchain, a deep refactoring of the linker, and many fixes in WinIO.
  
I have been trying to find out more about this, but a quick search yields nothing. Does anyone else happen to have more information? I’m particularly interested to know what benefits Clang has over the current GCC-based toolchain.

 This post follows this comment, but to make It easier to search later on, if anyone encounter this issue in the future, I've creating a new thread.
 I've recently switched to Vertico as it became the default completion system on Doom Emacs (Which I'm using). So far, I'm really happy with it, however, I couldn't find any information of filtering/ignoring some directories/files in search results.
 I have some projects containing folders (e.g. "vendor") with so many files that search results become unusable but I might not want to ignore those folder at the VCS level, so I would like to ignore those folders/files in Vertico via Emacs config (And not using .projectile or .gitignore files.
 Looking at the source of Doom Emacs, vertico-file-search, I don't see any option to do so. I couldn't find anything in Vertico documentation either.
 /u/sarit-hadad-enjoyer mentioned adding it to projectile-globally-ignored-directories seems to also apply in Vertico for him but unfortunately that doesn't seems to be working in my case.
 I would appreciate any information or help to help me solve this issue,

 My current plan is have the Main function be small and its entire purpose is to call 1 function built from helper functions. Now when making the helper functions I don't know whether its good practice to have folders and files in the app which contains the Main file or to have the helper functions in the Lib file from the src folder. I'm quite unsure what the use case of the Lib file and by extension the src folder is and would like that cleared up before continuing

 My Debug.trace.trace instance in normalizeMap shows the recursion working correctly and the Debug.trace.traceShow instance in function err shows a steadily increasing error value, evidence of the "maps" variable being correctly modified within the loop.
 The program's output, however, shows the "maps" variable being unmodified. The result of the recursive loop, the final "maps" object, should be returned on line 148, but the original "maps" object with the hard-coded values is returned.
 Any help would be appreciated. Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone,
 I'm using Doom Emacs with Projectile and I'm struggling to understand how to correctly ignore directories globally.
 I have projectile-indexing-method set to hybrid, and wanna ignore the directory ./vendor in every project I have, regardless of the .gitignore file (Or any SVN file).
 I've added the following configuration: ``` (after! projectile (add-to-list 'projectile-globally-ignored-directories "vendor"))
 ```
 But this does not seems to work. Here is a quick test: ``` mkdir -p /tmp/test-project/vendor echo "Hello" > /tmp/test-project/file echo "Hello" > /tmp/test-project/vendor/file
 Create .projectile so Emacs recognize folder as project
 touch /tmp/test-project/.projectile ```
 Now, in Emacs, after going inside the project, projectile-find-file shows the vendor directory.
 describe-variable does show "vendor" in the projectile-globally-ignored-directories list.
 I've found some contradictory information whether this should work or not with the hybrid indexation: - From this comment (https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs/issues/976#issuecomment-431711176), I understand I have to use .gitignore? - But from an issue I opened https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs/issues/6504, I understand it should?
 I've tried as much debugging as my Lisp skills allows so any help you be appreciated!
 Thank you

 why is it like this? How can I configure it/them so that typing scratch will always match both buffers? 
 I'm doing this on an empty config with pretty much only vertico and orderless installed, and I'm using sample configuration from their Readme.

 I installed ghcup through curl, vscode through apt-get, called vscode with --force-user-env and everything seems ok.
 I don't know if this is the best way to do it but I call `cabal repl` at a terminal tab in vscode, inside my project folder.
 However, it requires me to save the file and to type :r at every change to have it updated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I visit a file I often enter ~ (or ~user or /) to set the navigation root accordingly. The standard behavior in this case seems to be to continue to show the "default directory" (in this case, /bin) in the minibuffer, despite the fact that I've indicated that I'm looking for a file elsewhere:

 Once I've entered ~/ I'd like the minibuffer to look like this:

 I know that I can delete the "default directory" part of the path by hand, but that's cumbersome. I've looked in the Emacs manual, and I don't see an option that produces this behavior. Am I missing something?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Learning emacs is a bit overwhelming. I've gone through the tutorial and I've read a bit of the info pages as well. I understand the things covered in there, but how do I get to the point where I can be productive in emacs as a developer? I'm mostly a javascript developer, but currently learning C as well.
 I'd really like to have things like go-to-definition/go-to-references (probably using an LSP), searching project for regexes or just words, git management, syntax highlighting, debugging, etc.
 Are there good guides for getting there that actually explain what's going on each step of the way? I hate when it's a bunch of copy pasting. I want to understand what they are doing so I can change the parts I don't like.
 I'm also curious about using things like use-package or just using the default stuff of emacs. I see a lot of stuff about melpa vs elpa, and then I see use-package docs saying it's not a package manager. What are they talking about? What is the package manager then? Is there a straight forward way for a noobie to install some basic packages like magit and some JS modes that get me up and running?

This week, I'll be…
We had visitors all last week. I took refuge in reading, and now that the visitors have left, I am left with 'tons' of notes to process from_ The Solace of Open Spaces_ by Gretel Ehrlich and James Webb Young's classic 1939 — A Technique for Producing Ideas. Such joy and riches to be loaded with gobs of ideas to process into my ZK.
I'll continue procrastinating, working up the nerve to make a planned Poetry of Zettelkasting presentation on advanced search techniques for quickly finding high-quality links in a large ZK.
I'm thinking about software lock-in, obsolescence, feature creep, development cycles, owning vs. subscription. The subscription model strikes me as a trap. If the developers vanish, so does the app.

 I wrote an sbt plugin for enforcing the conventional commits standard.
 If you use semantic-release or something similar it would be great to have an automatic commit checker that checks if the commit message is compliant to the standard.
 The plugin works out of the box with (almost) zero setup. Of course, some customizations are available but the main objective of the plugin is to apply conventional commits with as little effort as possible.
 Suggestions and PR are welcome :)

 I am trying to make AuCTeX to run latexmk as a default engine. I configured .latexmkrc in a home folder, so lamtexmk <file> in command line compiles everything as expected.
 After short consulting with AuCTeX website, I added the following lines in to ~/.emacs
 ;; AUCTEX (eval-after-load "tex" '(add-to-list 'TeX-command-list '("LaTeXmk" "latexmk %s" TeX-run-command t t :help "Run LaTeXmk") t)) 
 which let me choose LaTeXmk from other alternative rules. Everything would work but I want latexmk to be the default program. Not sure about it but it seems TeX-command-default should be set to one of the entries from TeX-command-list which I did in the following line
 (setq TeX-command-default "LaTeXmk") 
 It doesn't seem to work. Now, the default rule is not even LaTeX when I press C-c C-c but View.
 What am I doing wrong? Thanks for any help.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been experimenting with the GADTs extension in Haskell and I'm wondering is there a significant difference between existential types obtained with GADTs and type classes? For example:
 -- toStr with GADTs and existential types data Stringable where Stringable :: a -> (a -> String) -> String toStr :: Stringable -> String toStr (Stringable x s) = s x -- same result but with a type class class Stringable a where show :: a -> String toStr :: Stringable a => a -> String toStr s = show s 
 This code made me wonder --ignoring the difference in ease of use of each solution-- is there something I can do with type classes that is impossible to achieve with existential types in GADTs or vice-versa?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Encouraged by comments in https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/vjo43z/improving_emacs_performance/ * I thought I'd have another look at my 'linting on save' snippet and ask the deep-thinkers here how I might improve it. It's almost perfect for me with bash(1) scripts - the only sand in the vaseline is that next-error skips over shellcheck(1) 'notes' and only points me at 'warnings' and worse. For example, in this output from shellcheck(1):
 foobar:5:18: note: Double quote to prevent globbing and word splitting. [SC2086] foobar:20:28: warning: ShellCheck can't follow non-constant source. Use a directive to specify location. [SC1090] 
 I would like next-error to visit occurrences of 'note's as well as more serious blues. Do I need to futz with next-error-function? If so, does anyone have the code for that? 
 Or perhaps there's some way to have shellcheck(1) promote 'notes' to 'warnings'?
 Here's my miserable code:
 (defun bh:check-syntax () "Check syntax for various languages." (interactive) (when (eq major-mode 'lisp-mode) (progn (emacs-lisp-byte-compile))) (when (eq major-mode 'sh-mode) (compile (format "bash -n %s && shellcheck -f gcc %s" buffer-file-name buffer-file-name) t)) (when (eq major-mode 'ruby-mode) (shell-command (format "ruby -c %s" buffer-file-name))) (when (eq major-mode 'python-mode) (shell-command (format "python -B -m py_compile %s" buffer-file-name))) (when (eq major-mode 'awk-mode) (shell-command (format "gawk --source 'BEGIN { exit(0) } END { exit(0) }' --file %s" buffer-file-name)))) (add-hook 'after-save-hook #'bh:check-syntax) 
 * the sub-discussion was about disabling flycheck as it's just too distracting - I prefer to do linting on save, and so do others, apparently.

Now, I am in terminal, inside the correct dir, I do scalac main.scala and it generates 2 files we all know. Now, I do scala Hello 12 and it works just fine. Now, let's make a simplest scala hello world program and do scala main.scala; I usually name my object as Hello and file as main.scala; without doing scalac and it runs fine. What the heck? I know my knowledge is lacking somewhere. Please pardon me for my english or difficulty to explain my question and help me with this doubt in simple but complete sentences (no layers of abstraction LoL). Thank you so much.

run M-x recompile (so it doesn't promt for compile command, like M-x compile)
 when *compilation* window pops up and focuses, lets you standard input what needs to be inputed
 when there is no longer things to input (program exits), *compilation* buffer is back to its normal read-only state and i can q to exit the completion window.
  
hope this makes sense. have a nice day :P

 I want to implement a new Word type that is 6 bits (from 0-63). 
 Now I know I can simply create a type synonym for Word8 and have the max bound be 63, but I am genuinely interested how to create a native type. I was watching the source code for ghc how other Word types are implemented from C to Haskell, and I am sort of lost. (Guess the better question could be How to write C code that alters GHC to create new types?). 
 Sorry in advance for any mistakes!

 I have a command I want to bind to a key, let us call it do-something
 do-something can be called with a prefix: one ctrl-u and two ctrl-u, it then changes its behaviour
 I want to avoid having to type the ctrl-u(s). How do I do it? 
 I guess I can a lambda that calls do-something with the prefix. But I do not know how to programmatically call do-something as if it was called with a prefix.
 Any help would be appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While writing yet another python program to convert structure text files to equivalent json text files with same information it occurred to me that elisp should be able to do the same task without much sweat. After all to get this done I ended up with a "LineWalker" class wrapping the full text to convert that had of necessity a small subset of what is in elisp for text buffer manipulation, walking and transformation.
 So I am curious the community here has at hand some pointers to text information transformers wholly in elisp. And I am curious whether transformation in place in text buffer is often done or usually transformation into another buffer. 
 So many bread and butter programming tasks involve transformation of text to some other text. Heck, compiling a program in transformation of text to different text or binary. So the breadth of such tasks is larger than it first seems.

 As the title says, the project would be a tasks provider for Android. It would read all the ToDos and scheduled items from Org files in the selected directory. It could be read-only or could create the new tasks in a selected inbox file.
 Would you find this useful and worth investing some time into? Do you have any ideas in this direction?
 My main goal would be to display the scheduled items and ToDos in a calendar view. Since there is an existing infrastructure available, the only missing link would be the provider that links the Org files and a calendar. I'm a visual type and can't get used to the linear agenda view. I'd like to look at the monthly calendar and see all my tasks. I know that this is possible with the normal calendar and tasks providers but I'd also like to keep these in my Org files, following GTD.

Is it still true that it's hard to find a Haskell job, but easy for companies to find Haskell developers?
 
What salaries are we roughly talking about?
 
How do companies know their remote employees are really working? Is installing spyware on the employee computers common / considered acceptable?
 
What collaboration software is being used? Zoom, Teams, or some end-to-end encrypted stuff? If I don't want to use a camera (audio only), at least not regularly, will this reduce my chances?
 
Do companies pay a guy in Bangalore less than a guy in San Francisco? In this case, would a person in San Francisco have to make it clear they don't expect San Francisco salaries to increase their chances of getting the job?
 
Do companies prefer to get billed by the person as an outside consultant rather than going through the hassle of hiring an employee?
 
Do companies prefer part-time workers, or ad-hoc workers who show up whenever they need my services, to full-time employees?

Over the years I had a bad habit of bookmarking things to read later and usually just never getting to them. I also have been using this anki plugin called Searching, PDF Reading & Note-Taking in Add Dialog and I really like the queue system it has, but I really hate taken notes in it or reading webpages or pdfs in it and want to try and find a way to do it in emacs. The addon is based on incremental reading (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incremental_reading) so you can add different articles to a priority queue that you can pull up to decide what to read next. I attached two screenshots below to help understand what I am talking about.
 ​
 Anyways, I'm super new to emacs and don't really know how I would go about doing this in emacs. Any tips? 
 ​
 I'd like to be able to have the priority features in the addon, i.e. 1-100 priority scheduling, show in [n] days, show on weekdays, set a directory for files and see all files that aren't currently in the queue, but I realize this may be pretty hard so I'd settle for just being able to add and remove links to a queue with some basic priority.

 I'm a med student, and I usually share my notes with many of my colleagues. I'm planning to make a github repo where they can contribute and access them for free. I'm going to make a tutorial for them on how to contribute and work with org-mode. 
 What editor is best for a beginner? Should I recommend them to use vscode/vscodium? Do you have any advise on how to help someone that was using microsoft office/google docs switch to org without scaring them away?

 Did anyone here use scala with Quarkus? If yes, what was the experience? 
 I am very curious about two things: 1. combining scala with smallrye mutiny, and 2 using scala with reactive database clients.
 I started to read the mutiny docs, and I must say, coming from scala, I don't find it appealing especially the onItem() chains.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I frequently work with JSON files that are made up of two kinds of data:
  
mostly irrelevant data I never want to see or change
 some important properties, some of which are, written in a programming language.
  
I would like to be able to edit these files in such a way that:
  
the irrelevant data is hidden
 the code is presented in a nicely formatted way with syntax highlighting
  
What is the best approach for this? For example:
  
Is there an existing library or mode that does something like this?
 Should this feature be implemented as a minor mode? If so, which mode should it extend?
 Should this feature be implemented as a major mode?
  
For example, the JSON file:
 [ { ... hundreds of lines of mostly irrelevant properties ... "name": "foo", "code": "def function():\n. print(\"hello, world from foo!\") ... many more lines...", ... hundreds of lines of mostly irrelevant properties ... }, { ... hundreds of lines of mostly irrelevant properties ... "name": "bar", "code": "def function():\n. print(\"hello, world from bar!\") ... many more lines...", ... hundreds of lines of mostly irrelevant properties ... } ] 
 What I'd like to see in my buffer:
 // foo def function(): print("hello, world from foo!") ... many more lines ... // bar def function(): print("hello, world from bar!") ... many more lines ... 
 Saving the buffer would update the underlying JSON file.
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I don't understand how to properly incorporate a Multi-state Workflow. How fundamentally are different these two configurations?
 ;; 1 (setq org-todo-keywords '((sequence "TODO(t)" "NEXT(n)" "|" "DONE(d)") (sequence "PROJECT(p)" "|" "COMPLETED(c)"))) ;; 2 (setq org-todo-keywords '((sequence "TODO(t)" "NEXT(n)" "PROJECT(p)" "|" "DONE(d)" "COMPLETED(c)"))) 
 As I see it, the only difference is when using S-<left> / S-<right> (org-mode ensures the order), but if use C-c C-t the org-mode does not enforce any rules and it's possible to go from PROJECT to NEXT, for example.
 Am I missing something, or can I somehow enforce the org-mode to validate that the state transition only happens within a single sequence?

 I have been following along System Crafters' video to try and set up the LSP, but alas to no avail.
 I am hoping to set this up with which-key, lsp-ui, and company-mode. So, any help is welcomed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We're excited to announce our Elm/Haskell app is in production! https://insurance.caribou.com. The frontend is entirely Elm, the backend is entirely Haskell. For most of the time we've been building it we've had a team of 4 engineers (the team size has fluctuated because of hiring new people, and some members starting a new Haskell team in the org).
 In case anyone cares, we were able to get the event sourcing services setup relatively quickly, most of it was finished in about 2 months with a long tail of tweaks and feature adds. The frontend work (which included some REST API work to add or update routes, etc) took closer to 3 months.
 Interesting choices ("interesting" as in "possibly unique, or better than the normal choices in our opinion"):
  
Event sourcing for our Haskell services
 elm-program-test feels like testing super powers
 servant-elm to generate Elm code from Haskell, but we eventually abandoned it because we didn't feel like it provided enough value :(
  
I wish I could say we're hiring, but we aren't right now. However we are likely to be hiring in a few months, but I'm just a tech lead so I don't actually make those decisions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm gonna start by saying that i respect emacs contributors/developers choice to keep emacs minimal, they maintain it, while not bloating it by just copy and pasting elisp code from plethora other external packages, leaving end users free to choose if they want any packages to add. Emacs already offers a lot of development tools, that i think work really well together, like (warning, long list ahead):
 version control (magit), web browser (eww), email client, text editing, terminal, plugin (package) manager, documentation, calculator, remote file system access (tramp), org more, and most importantly, powerful configuration system (elisp), and definitely more.
 Compared to emacs, vscode (yes im comparing emacs to vscode, bite me) only has 40% percent of these features. But there is one thing that vscode does better than emacs, and that is code editing. Vscode, has built in lsp, with fast, consistent auto code completion with good completion results, fast documentation, with easy to install plugins here and there. Emacs auto code completion makes typing typing feel laggy, the completions results are a bit worse, programing in different languages feels not as consistent, and setting up all the stuff is more tedious.
 All i'm saying is that i think emacs users would benefit a lot, if we had these features built in into emacs, with good, out of a box, experience, as most of us are programmers. And it would probably take a lot of effort for emacs devs to implement something like this, but why not.
 Thanks for reading my [almost] rant, have a nice day :D

 I know people here hates mouse, touchpad and the pointer cursor, i understand your point, but it is not as i have lerned to interact with my editor. So i would need something that it's easy to get in and has mouse support to navigate code, tabs and maybe menus.
 Thank you for your help.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a rails project with Overcommit gem that runs as a hook on git commit. This works fine in the command line as Overcommit has been installed (homebrew, rbenv, gem install overcommit).
 But when I commit through Magit it complains:
 This repository contains hooks installed by Overcommit, but the `overcommit` gem is not installed. Install it with `gem install overcommit`. 
 The normal process here on OSX at least is to install Homebrew so that you can install Rbenv so that you can control the Ruby version which overrides the base operating system version of Ruby. And then you can install the gem.
 How can I run through this process for Magit?
 Or
 How can I install a dependency such as this in the shell that Magit uses?
 ​
 I tried running through the process of installing Homebrew etc using the magit-shell-command but I get this message and cannot proceed:

 In the most loved session, It attracted my attention that Scala, despite being a powerful, general and elegant language, has only ~50% "loved" responsed. That's average, if u look at the result of the other ones. There are other nice stats in the survey as well. It's worth checking out.
 Important to note that:
  
 Java has 45% in that same aspect
 Another JVM language, Clojure, is in the top 3
 Scala had 52% in 2021, 53% in 2020, 58% in 2019 and 2018.
  
Do u guys/gals have any insights or opinion about this?
 Is it because it's seen as a "scalabe database" language for tools like Hadoop and Spark? Or something else? Share your opinion!

 Searching around to see if that's possible with either the usual HTML export or perhaps via some additional packages but I'm not finding a whole heck of a lot. I'm next going to see if I can get ox-hugo to take care of it.
 But perhaps someone has been down this path and has some advice?
 Much appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello r/emacs. I am in dire need of your assistance. My main hobbies are writing and playing around with programming. I am not particularly good at either, but I was drawn to emacs after seeing people post about how great it is as both an IDE and a word processor.
 Over the last two weeks, I have scoured the internet trying to learn more about emacs. I configured spacemacs, and then switched to doom emacs. I have learned the basics of org mode and org-roam. And even though it's been a much steeper learning curve than I expected, I have really loved it so far.
 However, I am stuck on one particular issue that is maddening and crippling my ability to use emacs the way I want. And that issue is almost enough to make me want to give up.
 The problem is formatting. Eventually, I need to be able to output this to a word or a PDF doc in double spaced times new Roman font. And while I know that there are a myriad of ways to do that, I am struggling to find a way that works while making my words in emacs not completely unreadable.
 As it stands now, if I tab or add spaces to indent my paragraphs, emacs will behave more like a programming text editor and indent the whole block of text. It looks fine if I copy it into libre word, but makes for tough writing in emacs itself
 If I add a space to break up paragraphs in emacs (a new line character), then I am stuck with an undesired extra space when I put it in libre word, and I can't figure out an easy way to search and delete those extra lines in word itself.
 I am not very good at configuring emacs, but I am trying to learn. Unfortunately, this one issue has made me almost want to give up completely even though I definitely see the advantages this software could offer. I feel like I am fighting with the system more than actually producing creative work.
 If anyone has any good advice on how to solve this, I would appreciate it. I know the solution is there, but I have yet to find it in my searches of YouTube and Google.

 Does anyone have any ideas about how to import all of my contacts and sync them with my iPhone and Mac? That would be very helpful and actually make MU4E actually usable.
 Help to convert me all the way. 😀

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was going back over the LYAHFGG and I came upon this
 flip' :: (a -> b -> c) -> b -> a -> c flip' f = \x y -> f y x 
 which is supposed to be the same as flip' f x y = f y x . And I'm guessing this is also the same effect?
 flip' :: (a -> b -> c) -> b -> a -> c flip' f = \x -> \y -> f y x 
 Then he says
  
The most common use case with flip is calling it with just the function parameter and then passing the resulting function on to a map or a filter. So use lambdas in this way when you want to make it explicit that your function is mainly meant to be partially applied and passed on to a function as a parameter.
  
With the f = \x y -> f y x the x is bound and the y is free? But how does bound and free come into play here? Can I have an example of what he's saying in the above quote?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 ​
 I write an theoretical project and I need a Haskell type that contains only natural numbers.
 I used Integers until now but at some point I want get arbitrary elements of type Eval a
 which is defined like this.
 data Ty = TyNat | (:->) Ty Ty
 type family Eval (t :: Ty) = res | res -> t whereEval TyNat = IntegerEval (a :-> b) = Eval a -> Eval b
 I works now but I I also get negative Integers or functions that can return negative Integers
 Because of that I want to replace integers with type that can only contain positive numbers.
 I still want to be able to represent big numbers and do fast computations.
 ​
 What is the right package for that?
 Is this type a good fit?
 https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.16.1.0/docs/Numeric-Natural.html
 ​
 Thank you very much!

 Recently I discovered TRAMP mode, and I really love it. There's just one little annoyance: I run Emacs as a daemon and, while trying to open a file with emacsclient in a new frame, TRAMP gets in the way and stubbornly tries to resolve an ssh:// link.
 Is there a way to avoid this behavior or, if that happens, to instruct Emacs to point to the local filesystem instead?
 So far I've managed to use iBuffer and delete the entry corresponding to TRAMP, but I hope there's some better way to solve my problem.
 Any help is really appreciated. Thank you!

 When I try to start it up with M-x eglot in a file, I get the error Symbol's function definition is void: project-root. From searching the eglot discussion forums, the usual issue is that the project library is misinstalled, but if that's the case here, it's beyond my ability to debug.
 In particular: - I did install eglot the standard way via M-x package-install. M-x package-list-packages does show project 0.8.1 installed (with status "dependency", I assume because it was pulled in as a dependency of eglot). - M-x find-library project takes me to the project.el file for version 0.8.1 (github link), which I think means the correct version of project is being loaded. - I'm not an expert, but it looks like this library does define the project-root symbol. - Following a suggestion here, I tried M-x list-load-path-shadows, and found two relevant lines, both of which seem to indicate the version I want is shadowing other versions:  /home/rif/.emacs.d/elpa/project-0.8.1/project hides /usr/share/google-emacs/site-lisp/emacs-google-config/third_party/elisp/project/project /home/rif/.emacs.d/elpa/project-0.8.1/project hides /usr/share/google-emacs/27.2+gg3+1.20210329.053400.rc147/lisp/progmodes/project

 Today, I was very confused by Powershell’s behavior while trying to run Haskell commands in GHCI. Characters were spat back out at me in rearranged order as undefined variables; normal arithmetic operations didn’t work; nothing worked and the powershell even printed things to the screen in a broken way.
 To fix it I merely used the normal command line instead.

build frequent and small changes to the code. This was a consequence
of Haskell rules only being able to express dependencies

 There have been a few recent discussions about the GNU Hyperbole package, which provides worldwide interlinking capabilities across different buffers and modes via implicit and explicit links, which are activated with a single command or key. This feature is interesting, but Hyperbole comes with a additional baggage, the Koutliner, HyRolo, HyControl and technical debt, which makes the package hard to get into. For this reason I tried to cook down the package to a minimal subset - GNU Hypobole. Since Emacs is Elisp and Elisp is Emacs it also makes sense to hack it yourself. Still, the following package is only meant as a demonstrator. If you truly want to use the hotkey functionality, you may rather use the original Hyperbole package, Embark (embark-dwim as hotkey and emba…]]></summary>

 Previously I stored all the data in git, but git is not really great about storing large binary files. I know about git lfs, but all git services like GitHub provide limited space and data traffic options.

 i got the same problem again, it seems like it is not a rustic problem. 
 the problem seems to be rust-analyzer, when i go to another cargo project and edit main .rs file, it does not let it change. but when i killall emacs and run lsp again in another project, everything is fine

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone, I've been trying out emacs and really enjoying it! But been having a heckuva time getting it to launch smoothly, with the default settings. 
 I'm on Win10, and I'm getting an "end of file" error that (I think) is preventing my settings from launching (mainly the theme right now, doom-one). 
 I followed a tutorial setting up a buncha stuff like package managers, and I checked for matching brackets/parens, but I'm not sure what else to try. 
 I've followed directions here for getting debug mode, but it's not working, it just opens cmd and that stays blank. 
 Any thoughts/help? 
 Edit - here's the full error:
 Warning (initialization): An error occurred while loading ‘c:/Users/moses/.emacs’:
 End of file during parsing: c:/Users/moses/.emacs To ensure normal operation, you should investigate and remove the cause of the error in your initialization file. Start Emacs with the ‘--debug-init’ option to view a complete error backtrace.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I thought I'd ask since I'm curious.
 This type of question always goes alongside the discussion of eglot versus lsp-mode, and is asked at least every few months in this sub. In that discussion, some prefer eglot because it feels more unobtrusive and faithful to Emacs built-ins compared to lsp-mode—so eglot is a legitimate alternative to lsp-mode.
 Debugging is a different story. Really, the only viable debugging tools (that aren't for elisp) in Emacs are dap-mode and gud and its rewrite, realgud. Though the debugging adapter protocol (dap) can be reimplemented for eglot, it would take a lot of effort, so it likely won't manifest anytime soon. Consequently: if you want to use dap, then you have to use lsp-mode.
 But how is gud/realgud? It's almost never spoken of these days due to the popularity of lsp-mode/dap-mode. Of course, the tools are very different, but does anyone still think gud/realgud can be treated as a genuine alternative to dap-mode (barring preferences in UI)? Do they still have a place?

The speed of eglot/lsp-mode were real annoyances for me before, and I know emacs' (supposedly slow) speed is an issue for many.
 It just works pretty well out of the box too, which is wonderful since these are the features that attract people to make emacs their IDE.
 Has anyone else tested it more intensely? Anyone had any dealbreaking issues with it?

 There are ways to work around this limitation. You can create an event quantifier for your events. Better yet, create one for events in the future, and another for events that have already occurred. Unfortunately, this solution would require the user to manually change the state of the event quantifier for the item, or write a script to do this automatically. Regardless, such a solution would not organize events separately from other task items, and would not distinguish them as being a different type of "thing". 
 Another solution, would be to use items that…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I'm running Doom Emacs, and I'm looking to replace the standard doom-dashboard package with the regular dashboard.
 I added the package to my packages.el file, added the config that I found on GitHub, and it's ready! There's just one problem.
 With doom-dashboard, whenever I open a new workspace, the dashboard shows up, and it's also the fallback buffer, meaning that I can't delete it. I think this is the code that gives it this functionality:
  (when (equal (buffer-name) "*scratch*") (set-window-buffer nil (doom-fallback-buffer)) (+doom-dashboard-reload)) 
 With the regular dashboard however this is not the case, I made a quick little script that opens a new workspace and the dashboard at the same time, but it's not working too well:
  (defun new-workspace () "Open a new workspace and open the dashboard at the same time" (interactive) (+workspace/new) (dashboard-refresh-buffer)) (global-set-key (kbd "M-n") 'new-workspace) 
 The problem is that if I close a workspace with the dashboard open, it dissapears from all other workspaces.
 Any help would be greatly appreciated!

Been a long time notebook/journal user and more recently a Zettelkasten convert. I first heard of Zettelkasten after a few coworkers of mine were talking about personal knowledge systems. I read everything under "Getting Started" on this site plus others, and even bought (and read) the book about taking smart notes.
I started blogging over a decade ago and already see the massive assistance my Zettelkasten provides even with only a few zettels (about 70 fully formed zettels currently). Not only does it help with my blog but it's help with creating content both for public social networks as well as my online store.
Needless to say, I'm a convert and taking my time building up a Zettelkasten for my brain to work within. I'm currently using Obsidian for the software but am thinking about creating a software myself to fit my exact needs. But we'll see... creating software is a lot of work... 😅
Happy Zettel'n!]]></summary>

 Can such a database be developed in emacs? Is there any such module? 
 Apart from this, people use notion for easy document markup and linking pages. I think org mode does this so much better. The markup is simple and great and also allows to link to other pages. Almost everything else notion does, emacs does better. But the database thing is where notion seems to excel at. I also heard software like airtable provide small, noob friendly databases.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey friends,
 I'm new at this so I apologize if my lingo is off! I'm starting to migrate my configs to org files where I can use Babel to tangle. I also use GNU Stow for individual packages so everything is sym-linked from a master .dotfiles dir.
 For those that do this or something similar, I'm wondering, do you keep the org files in a git repo, or just the dotfiles? If both in a repo, do you keep them together?
 Also, because I have some per system configs where how the dotfiles will be tangled will depend on some evaluated code in my org files. I can't wrap my head around how that won't create problems for version control since the code will change depending on the machine. I guess the dotfiles can be in different git branches, but if the evaluated results in the org files themselves will be changing depending on the system, won't that pose a problem for version control as well?
 Hope this makes sense! Any ideas appreciated.

 I tried to check the build status in the Hackage Matrix Builder but the site looks pretty unhealthy.
 So, I have a couple of questions:
  
Is the matrix builder likely to be fixed in the near future and is there any effort to fix it that I or others might be able to help contribute to?
 In the short term, is there a workaround that I can use to upload documentation as part of the CI process*?

 where (===) is a primitive that checks whether its two arguments are physically equal thunks, and if so, gives you the proof that their types must be the same.
 Has this been considered before, and is it a remotely sensible idea in a language like Haskell?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi.
 Mac user here.
 I installed railwaycat with brew and it works great.
 I also installed Doom emacs which also runs fine, and my config is doing splendidly now.
 I installed mu with brew, but Doom is not finding mu4e. I'm trying to point it to "/opt/homebrew/share/emacs/site-lisp/mu4e/" but there is no mu4e there. I can't find it anywhere. Does anyone know where it is installed?
 A "where emacs" returns: /opt/homebrew/bin/emacs
 Note: I uncommented mu4e from init.el and everything syncs just fine.
 I tried re-installing mu with: brew install mu --with-emacs and I get "invalid option --with-emacs".
 Using a silicon Mac. Any advice would be very welcome. Thanks.
 EDIT: As per this comment here: https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs/issues/6473#issuecomment-1160267979
 I'm trying to point Emacs to mu4e.
 EDIT (Solution):
 After hours and hours of research, I found that the answer was staring at me in the face:
 'brew list --verbose mu' showed me exactly where mu4e was installed. I added to the path and it works. Just adding this here in case anyone else is looking for the same answer.
 (N.B.) I did not know about this command and I didn't think about looking it up. I found it on another site. But it seems so obvious now.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just did a quick look and found 98 commits to doom in the last week and a total of more than 17k commits. Maintaining such a huge code-base to share with everyone that is updated so frequently is no small feat, so just wanted to do a quick shout out to u/hlissner and everyone who contributes to doom and all the various distros out there (and everyone in this subreddit as well :) everyone is too kind and welcoming) 
 As someone who spent an enormous amount of time botching together their own config with near nil elisp-fu, picking up doom recently has been such a wonderful experience. I get sane defaults, updates on new packages and ecosystems like vertico/marginalia/consult etc., and a nice way to keep it all up to date. 
 Thank you u/hlissner, and thank you to all who contribute. Your efforts are truly appreciated by so many. I just bought Henrik a couple coffees, and if you have the means and have enjoyed using doom as much as I have maybe consider doing the same. And if you are newer to the emacs scene and your emacs-fu chops are as weak as mine, I highly recommend giving doom a go, and know that you can turn vim/evil key bindings off and still get all the benefits of a community maintained repo of awesome packages if you want to (although I am now a converted evil boi) :)

 I am using maven with java and scala, project is configured by pom.xml
 https://gist.github.com/maciejbak85/c74764a9d3540a22f9c0a4aa24e1c1df 
 and it works very different vs using only scala and sbt, for example when I type some code in scala file I need to wait ~10 seconds to see if there are any errors, or highlighted errors will be gone.
 I will illustrate this by 2 screen shots:
 ​
 https://preview.redd.it/0y53gknhtq691.png?width=585&format=png&auto=webp&s=a945ea281be05177f35db413bdd19b4a8c4d1b67
 first one is just after typing this code
 ​
 https://preview.redd.it/1mojwr9itq691.png?width=579&format=png&auto=webp&s=5a4f9d03ea51d0fe043f4cc93c87a22337fdc525
 and after about 10 seconds finally I see errors, and I can then use shortcuts to import missing classes.
 It slows down my work a lot.. maybe I have missconfigured smth ?
 not sure what to show even, from settings.
 thanks!

 For eg, if you type "v table" in shell, it will open the file tableData in vim if you have edited such a file recetnly in vim.
 Thus you can quickly type a few first letters of a file name with v and you can open that in vim quickly. What is the emacs equivalent?
 Counsel-fzf seems to do that from M-x, but what is the eshell equivalent? or a Shell equivalent? 
 This is the package I am talking about.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Here are a few examples. 
 Search and replace is a single command in vim. You type :s/text/TextToReplace and you are done. The same command also also accepts regex without the need to have seperate command for that.
 Emacs uses query search and replace which prompts 2 times for the main text and then the text to replace. And then if you want to use regex to replace, you have to use a different command. 
 Command to kill buffer prompts for which buffer to kill, although almost always you want to kill the current one.
 :bd just kills the current buffer in vim. 
 Many alt-x commands prompt too much asking for each argument, instead of just allowing all the arguments to be entered in one line. 
 I know some of these can be customised and eliminated but this seems to be a general trend. I read that one of the vim design principles was to prompt user as little as possible allowing user to do much non interactively while emacs seems to encourage lot of spoon feeding to new/ begginer users.
 Not to mention, settting the option of shorter prompts (y or n instead of yes and no), disabling some prompts made my emacs experience much better. Also disabling the splash screen, startup tutorial, and changing the scratch buffer message to something much shorter. All these changes had to be done to get a more elegant experience.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello forum members. I am about 5 days into my Zettelkasten experience and hooked. Why did I not know about this? A fluke find from Atomic Habits to Deep Work to Smart Notes resulting in crash learning how to get started in Obsidian.
Many years ago a science degree, now as a 60's something student, just finished a Bachelor of Visual Arts (Hons) I am moving on to a Ph.D (preparation mode at present). During Honours I held way too much information in my head, bounced from art journals for drawing, bullet journals, todo lists and adhoc method of note taking and Mendeley for references.
After a couple of months preparatory reading I have multitudes of ideas but have frozen at the writing/note taking point, word docs and OneNote are resulting in dead notes that I know in a couple of years wont serve me well. Zettelkasten is how my head so I am hoping this will be a game changer.
If anyone else is in the process of working on their Ph.D thesis  I would love to know how you use your Zettelkasten, do you keep it purely for creative notes or use folders etc to track authors, titles etc to ensure you have covered your lit review requirements? Any tips, starting points for a new Obsidian user would be appreciated.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, I'm completely "all-in" on org-mode now. It's solved all my frustrations and brick walls I had with pretty much every other note taking, agenda type application I've ever used over like the last 10 years (Evernote, Joplin, OneNote (that lasted like 3 days), Text files, dokuwiki, mediawiki, todist, etc)
 ​
 One last struggle I'm kind of trying to wrap my head around is organizing notes when one has too many life contexts. For example, I've got a full time job, a part time job (which really just connects to my full time job... long story), an addiction to businesses, investments, books I'm reading, a home, a truck, a car... you get the idea)... 
 So, being crazy busy, crazy spread thin half the time and needing to keeps notes has always been a challenge.
 I'm just curious if someone could share their methods of organizing their org mode files. I've kind of ended up with a bunch of files (atleast I was smart enough to leave them all in one place). I'm also taking to using agenda as well, which adds some challenges as well I would think, but I'm not sure.
 ​
 I guess maybe I don't fully understand org organization just yet. Maybe someone can offer some insight?
 I should note I also use Plain Org on iPhone, mainly because it's the only one I found that I could sync with anything other than dropbox/google drive/ webdav. I prefer self-hosted so that was my choice and I sync with Syncthing.
 As always appreciate the community

 I thought it did, but the documentation doesn't show anything like that.
 I may have confused with straight or el-get and their use-package integrations.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello there! 
 I'm currently working with a scala codebase and it's very new for me as I only worked with NodeJs on a very sketchy codebase. I'm starting to question the "good practices" setup by the previous developers but I'm struggling to find good references as to what really are considered good practices in scala and what are definitely crucial errors often made by new developers learning the trade. I was wondering if you had any resources you find/found yourself returning to? 
 FYI I am currently working on a REST API (which is not very RESTful in my opinion but that's another debate) with Scala 2 + Play + Slick (and some Akka actors for cron jobs but I don't really understand why). No documentation, no tests of any kind. I feel that files are all over the place (there is not a really defined logical architecture). Logs didn't even had a date & time before I added it to the logger (I had never even thought about not having date & time on logs before but I guess people can work without it). Sometimes controllers directly communicate with DAOs without services, and DAOs communicate between themselves, I thought it was frowned upon but I've been told otherwise by the previous devs... 
 Anyway! 
 TLDR : what's your go-to documentation?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I am a software engineer with 5 years of experience total, Scala around 3. I have been working as a contractor for the last 2 years and worked with 3 different clients. One thing is common for all of them, and that is a very poor quality codebase, without any documentation, some tests, a fundamental misunderstanding of how libraries like ZIO or Cats-Effect should be used, a tendency to overcomplicate literally everything, using GraphQL without reasonable explanation, using Slick with Cats-Effect, instead of a doobie, etc.
 After some time, I realized that I am very frustrated with my career, even If Scala was everything I ever wanted to do, I've invested a lot of time and money to be in this position I am now. I have a very high daily rate, and in spite of that, I am very unhappy with all the Scala projects I was working on.
 I started to doubt myself lately, because, before this Scala contract role, I was very happy at my work, with smart colleagues open for discussion, a very simple and clean codebase, and no overengineering, but it was an outsourcing company and it was getting really hard to get raise. Now I literally earn 8-9 times more than just 2-3 years ago but have a feeling that I always find shitty company. Just wanted to mention that all companies are product based.
 I just wanted to check, what are your experiences with Scala-based companies?

 Couldn't match expected type: [a] with actual type: [a1] -> [b1] • Probable cause: ‘map’ is applied to too few arguments In the second argument of ‘map’, namely ‘(map g)’ ... 
 So m5 and m6 would seem to be following point-free, so why are they failing?

The three types of procrastination are - "you could work on (a) nothing, (b) something less important, or (c) something more important. That last type, I'd argue, is good procrastination." Type-C procrastinators put off the small stuff to work on the big stuff.

 How do you all deal with appointments in org mode?
 I know you just put a time stamp on a headline and it'll show up in the agenda. But now what? Do you:
 - Show only a day in your agenda, and set up a deadline on the appointment so that a reminder will show up in the agenda today?
 - Show a couple of months in advance and not bother with the deadline?
 - Show only a day in your agenda, not bother with a deadline, and remind your self another way?
 I know how to do all this, I'm just trawling for ideas :-)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Like the title says, I am having an issue setting up plantUML. Particularly I am having an issue with getting a preview from a plantuml org src block. I have tried everything I know to get it working and it keeps giving the error ‘org-plantuml-jar-path’ is not set when it is. Also if i try to switch from plantuml.jar to using an executable, it still gives me the same error. 
 config snippet 
 ``` ;; #----=[plantuml]=----# (use-package plantuml-mode :mode "(\.\(plantuml?\|uml\|puml\)\'" :config (setq plantuml-executable-path "/nix/store/5iwqfbb371aa1l8lfk3dq1k3lpgklv22-system-path/bin/plantuml") (setq plantuml-default-exec-mode 'executable)
 ;; (setq plantuml-jar-path (expand-file-name "~/libraries/plantuml-1.2022.5.jar")) ;; (setq plantuml-default-exec-mode 'jar) ;; (setq plantuml-default-exec-mode 'server)
 (setq plantuml-indent-level 2) (setq my/plantuml-indent-regexp-return "\s*return\s+.+$") (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\.plantuml\'" . plantuml-mode)) (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\.uml\'" . plantuml-mode)))
 ```
 screenshot of the issue even when the jar section is uncommented and the executable section is commented.
 I have been messing with using a plantuml server instead but I have not gotten it to work.
 If anyone has any idea of how to help, I would appreciate it. Although I can use the plantuml command from a terminal, I would prefer to do it from within the org file.
 Thanks in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have some typescript projects I'm working on, and trying to keep them well documented using some docstring comments with examples like this:
 typescript /** * A greeter function! * * @param name - Who to greet * @returns "hello {name}". * * @example * const greeter = hello("world") * greeter === "hello world" * */ export function hello(name: string): string { return `hello ${name}` } 
 What I would like is some way to edit the @example code as typescript code, like how I can edit an org-babel source block using typescript-mode in a popup buffer by calling (org-edit-special &optional ARG) using C-c ' (in doom emacs).
 Ideally, I could just add the @example tag and then call some function to open a popup typescript buffer, which when I save it will add all of the necessary * prefixes to each line.
 I thought maybe something like polymode might help, except the buffer is already in typescript mode.

 I get multiple warnings pycodestyle [E501]: E501 line too long (84 > 79 characters). With lsp-mode, I could disable them in .flake8 in my project. But it does not work with eglot/flymake.
 Any ideas to solve this? And how does the flymake integration work in eglot?
 Here is what I have tried: - (setq python-flymake-command '("flake8" "-")) - (setq python-check-command "flake8")

 { "Person1": { "name": "John Doe" "job" : "Accountant" "id": 123 } "Person2": { "name": "Jane Doe" "job" : "Secretary" "id": 321 }} 
 Then I can define a new data type as 
 data Person = Person { name :: String , job :: String , id :: Int } deriving Show 
 What I'm stuck on is deriving an instance of FromJSON to deserialize the JSON text into the above data type. Most examples focus on the case where the JSON text comes as a list, but here they come as key-value pairs where each value is itself a dictionary / hashmap, which I'm having a little trouble translating into code.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Are there any known issues with file I/O and CIFS / SMB mounted filesystems? When trying to write files more than a few MB with ByteString's writeFile, I get I/O errors apparently related to closing the file. There is an entry in the directory, and the file is readable, but other operations seem to indicate the file was not closed. I ran these on CentOS 7. 
 $ ghc --version The Glorious Glasgow Haskell Compilation System, version 8.10.7 $ cat badio.hs import qualified Data.ByteString as B main = B.writeFile "badfile.dat" $ B.pack $ replicate 5000000 0x01 $ badio badio: badfile.dat: hClose: hardware fault (Input/output error) 
 I don't get this error on local filesystems and on small files on the CIFS mount. I can write files in the same way in python without issue.
 EDIT: I can also run interpreted with runghc and it will work to write & close properly. 
 EDIT 2: I can re-mount the CIFS share on the same host via sshfs to localhost and the operation will work on the sshfs mount point. So I have a workaround, but would still be interested in what the issue might be. 
 Thanks for any ideas.

 I checked my ~/.font directory, there are many font files that may match the specification.
 Furthermore, this problem only occur with certain unknown packages' upgrade, as the configuration used to work before the upgrade.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There are some nice posts in the Transitioning links from Obsidian to the Archive thread on distracting environments, particularly this post by @sfast that mentions an experiment in which simply having a smartphone in the same room was detrimental to working memory.
I'm not a current user of The Archive, but am drawn towards it due to the philosophy of being a focused, minimally distracting environment. But I am particularly interested in how people handle digital distraction beyond simply app choice. Personally I feel like the modern operating system lends itself to distraction so much, that app choice is actually minimally relevant.
Even were I to use The Archive for example, my brain is wired by now to hit Cmd+Space and start typing the name of my browser, to hit Cmd+t while in a browser and start typing the name of a distracting website without thought, to swipe left and right on the trackpad to switch between multiple apps on multiple desktops and so on. Even with enough disciple to avoid those things, as @sfast points out, just resisting them is using up working memory itself.
Where a tool like Obsidian encourages some background mental processing simply due to the complexity of options that are available, even if you're making an effort not to use them. The whole OS feels like this to me x10, kind of nullifying the benefits of a focused environmental like The Archive.
It doesn't help that I have ADHD, and am just young enough to have grown up with social media, so these behaviours were hard wired into my developing brain.
I would like to use The Archive for all the many advantages it provides, but I'm almost tempted to go the route of a physical Zettelkasten simply to be able to work in a room with no devices.
Does anyone have any thoughts on this topic, and how to manage digital distraction particularly in a desktop environment?]]></summary>

 :t solveRPN1 solveRPN1 :: (Num a, Read a) => String -> a

 I don't quite understand how read is working here. With read I thought you had to give it a hint as to what you want it to be, e.g., read "12" :: Int or
 rInt :: String -> Int rInt = read 
 but in that last line numberString first is "10". But then how does read know to make it -- right, I don't see any explicit numerical type, either. This doesn't work
 solveRPN1 "10.0 4.4 +" Exception: Prelude.read: no parse 
 So yes, how is read working here and how does this code know what number type it's involved with?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Guys, we all know that Scala is the best "pound for pound" language out there.
 It has the potential to be "the only one you'll ever need", the Holy Graal, the Default Language, the Language. Scalable and scaled across the platforms, use cases, domains and industries. Across the Universe.
 It has it all: great syntax, powerful features, sound type system, solid IDE support, tooling, libraries, great community.
 But it also must run on all the platforms: server, browser, and mobile. Both iOS and Android. 
 JVM and Scala.js are awesome, thank you very much.
 We used to have some momentum on Android, but there's nothing left these days. We are non existent on iOS.
 Maybe I'm not aware of something, but it looks to me we are losing developers to Scala's pathetic parody, Kotlin.
 Which became an obvious choice for devs, being the de-facto default language for Android development, that also compiles to JS, and has interoperability with Swift/Objective-C. They can use it for everything indeed.
 I find this situation very sad, wrong, unfair, and alarming. My fear is that if nothing changes Scala will slowly but steadily lose its share and eventually vanish, remaining only in legacy codebases, and oldfags' memories as the G.O.A.T. that didn't make it.
 Scala must win, it's just better.
 I don't know how to help with this except by pointing out the obvious.
 I understand that working on implicit context functions, capabilities, effects and multi-stage programming is much more interesting. But.
 Please, please, please, break this cycle, rise above, focus on multi platform support!
 Collaborate with Google on Android, I'm sure they love Scala. Apple loves Scala, just take a swift look at Swift! Maybe they would help?
 Kotlin recently announced Alpha version of their multiplatform initiative. They are moving in the right direction.
 Scala must too.

So far I had always assumed that The Archive can't handle spaces in file paths, so I either tried to avoid naming my files/folders with spaces or replaced the spaces with %20 in links.
<URL> or ![](URL) spaces in the path can don't destroy the link.
Do you still think it's good practice to continue replacing spaces with %20 (which also still works) for the sake of compatibility with other software/operating systems or can I abandon the practice for the sake of simplicity and aesthetics?
Best,

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a function my/tex-command that relies on the package tex and which I want to bind to some key. I handle this with use-package as follows:
  (use-package tex :bind ("C-c C-o C-o" . my/tex-command) :config (defun my/tex-command () (interactive) ;; Stuff )) 
 This works since tex is automatically auto-loaded when my/tex-command is called. Moreover, the function is defined correctly when tex is loaded.
 However, if I run (symbol-file 'my/tex-command) I get back the file tex.el instead of the file where I actually defined the function. This is because load-history has several entries for my/tex-command including ones that associate it to tex.el and ones that associate it to the correct files. The result is that my helpful buffers show the wrong file when I look up my/tex-command. 
 How do I correctly deal with this situation? I know of two solutions that I want to avoid: - Define a new module which includes my/tex-command and which requires tex when loaded. This is fine, but it does mean that I have to create many custom modules and I want to have a simpler configuration. - Include (require tex) in my/tex-command and define it outside the use-package statement. I want to avoid having to call require commands in functions.

I want to advertise for my online user study for Chameleon (https://chameleon.typecheck.me), a tool to help investigate type errors in Haskell. This tool is part of my Ph.D. project. In the past year, I showcased the progress a few times in r/haskell [1], [2], [3].
 I am deeply grateful that the community responded enthusiastically to our tool design. I received tons of positive messages, kudos, and constructive feedback. Since then, I spent a lot of time and effort integrating what I learned into a more complete and mature design.
 Whether you are a Haskell beginner or a veteran, if you are interested in this project or want to check out the Haskell tool design, please click this link to proceed https://chameleon.typecheck.me/consent. I am confident that your input will give me an important insight into where to devote my effort in the future. The study takes about 20 - 30 minutes to complete, and it is anonymous. I won't ask you for your email address or other personal information.

 I am starting to get into Haskell and using the "Haskell School of Music" book to do so. The book heavily uses the Euterpea package.
 After using cabal v1-install to install it globally, I can use the package with ghci to run my module from the repl and with ghc to compile the .hs file.
 However, it seems to me that the suggested approach when writing programs in haskell would be to use stack or cabal to setup a local project environement. Seeing how (to me as a newcomer) the amount of packages that have dependencies to specific (sometimes outdated) versions of other packages, this makes a lot of sense to me and I would like to use this approach from the beginning.

 My plan was to use miso to build it, but I couldn't set up nix properly because I'm using windows 11 and I run into some memory problem every time I try to build a miso project.
 error: builder for '/nix/store/zaw5k6i7lqgxlw7i8aaxvqhknjky3f5x-miso-1.8.0.0.drv' failed with exit code 137
 error: 1 dependencies of derivation '/nix/store/b252wg82ir1g1vqmcyp78491gamjbwp5-app-0.1.0.0.drv' failed to build
 I've read other posts on this same sub and it seems to me that the other haskell frameworks are quite simple and not suitable for non-static pages. What I ask you guys is if there is an obvious fix for my nix error or if there is another haskell framework/library that does the job (frontend web).
 If that's not possible, I will follow these advices and build it using elm/fsharp/javascript and only use haskell for the backend.
 I'm not willing to change my OS (dual boot is not an option either).
 [edit]My computer only has 8GB of ram, and even allocating it all for the WSL it doesn't compile. I am starting to think that my computer just can't run GHCJS.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello zettelkasten forums!
I've just recently gotten started with the zettelkasten method, and I find it intriguing and I'm looking forward to seeing how it affects my life, as I have ADHD and it's very easy for me to pick up knowledge and then later lose it due to time away from a subject, and it looks to me as though the zettelkasten method will help me with that.
I've noticed one "problem" as I've started with it however. I've seen the expression that people's zettelkasten are "hungry" and need to be "fed", and having started to use the method I like the expression a lot, it feels appropriate. Whenever I start writing notes it feels as if everything I say has branching possibilities for things that I should make additional notes on.
For example, I am a software engineer, and unlike most of my other interests my knowledge in this domain has remained solid for a long time because it's the topic I spend the most time in. So far I haven't put any notes into my zettelkasten on topics of software because I'm concerned that it will become a huge issue of time. I have accumulated much knowledge in the ~15 years I've spent building software, and I feel like if I put down the first note I won't be able to stop feeding the beast for a very long time.
So I would like to ask two questions: first, how do you all decide on a stopping point when writing and cope with the fact that there's more you could write, and second, how do you keep track of places that you know you could expand on later but have decided not to do so yet in such a way as to allow yourself to come back to it later during some time you have set aside to feed your zettelkasten?]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I already use org-mode but in a very simple way so please assume that I have 0 knowledge about org-mode and I can miss something very obvious. I'm looking for a solution that will let me:
  
take notes that are stored in separate files (I don't want to think in what file I should save the note [ otoh I like how org-roam-node-insert first lists all of the existing notes] but I also don't want to have everything in one file)
 notes should have tags
 notes should have creation and last update date
 I could easily list all my existing tags and show all notes from a tag
 I could search my notes using dates 
 the solution should handle at least 1k notes 
  
I'm ready to write elisp but I would prefer to have something that ticks all the boxes.
 Please advise!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What strategies do you use for displaying or notifying about the *Warnings* buffer?
 Since a while I use a bottom side window (code below) to display it. But I grew dissatisfied with that solution, because often it eats valuable space (e.g. resizes the pdf-tools buffer, aww). I have other stuff in the bottom side window as well (e.g. SLY-REPL, shells and terminals) at different slots. I experimented with resizing the Warnings buffer window when it pops up, but that resizes other mentioned windows (also not a good solution).
 I think it is necessary to being notified about a fresh *Warnings* buffer, but that should not disturb to much. I thought about just displaying a message, or popping up a dedicated *Warnings* frame, or is there something more volatile?. 
 What useful solutions do you use?
  
Source code of my current handling of the *Warnings* buffer:
 (add-to-list 'display-buffer-alist '("\\*\\(Warnings\\)\\*" (display-buffer-reuse-window display-buffer-reuse-mode-window display-buffer-in-previous-window display-buffer-in-side-window) (window-height . 0.25) (side . bottom) (slot . 1)))

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am experiencing a very weird bug with emacs-w3m. When I visit duckduckgo, the return page is a bunch of non-sense encoding char. I have no idea what charset or encoding the page is at. The strangest thing is that, I have no problem visiting every other site, only duckduckgo is affected.
 I tried to pop up a terminal, and use w3m to visit duckduckgo, no problem. I tested the same emacs config on my macbook, the same version of w3m and emacs-w3m, no problem.
 Here is what it looks like when I use `w3m-download` to download the bugged page. The url I opened is https://lite.duckduckgo.com/lite. 
 https://gist.github.com/drshapeless/d8eb40adbaf1cc00ba914a36958deb6b
 I am using Arch Linux, w3m is installed via AUR. I can load the correct html of duckduckgo via curl or firefox. I even tried to download the html to a local file and ask emacs-w3m to open the file. No problem. Duckduckgo is broken when I directly visit it in emacs-w3m.

 There are several solutions out there that save org files in sqlite databases. One is this:
 https://github.com/ndwarshuis/org-sql
 Seems pretty mature, but I don't see any example for how to use it.
 I haven't gotten further than these steps:
 (require 'org-sql) (require 'f) (defun ugt-setup-org-sql nil (interactive) (setq org-sql-files ;;(f-directories org-directory nil :recursive) (list (concat org-directory "/org-roam"))) (org-sql-user-reset) (org-sql-user-init) (org-sql-user-push)) (ugt-setup-org-sql) nil (org-sql-list-tables) ("clocks" "headlines" "properties" "file_metadata" "links" "state_changes" "file_tags" "logbook_entries" "timestamp_repeaters" "headline_closures" "outlines" "timestamp_warnings" "headline_properties" "planning_changes" "timestamps" "headline_tags" "planning_entries") 
 And I dont' even know
  
Where my sqlite database has been generated.
 How I can query that database.

 I recently got `lsp-mode` to work. So, if something is available in this eco-system that will be great. Otherwise I am open to other suggestions. 'Elpy` has this functionality but it is very slow and I notice a lag -- which I cannot live with.

 Here is my configuration:
 (use-package ob-prolog :ensure t) ;; prolog compatibility (add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/elpa/ob-prolog-20190410.2130") (setq org-babel-prolog-command "swipl") (org-babel-do-load-languages 'org-babel-load-languages '((gnuplot . t) (latex . t) (python . t) (prolog . t) (shell . t) (dot . t)))

 EDIT: Found out the solution.
 Apparently you need to set the :session argument.
 #+begin_src prolog :results output :session prolog-demo father(john, bob). father(bob, alice). grandfather(X, Y) :- father(X, Z), father(Z, Y). #+end_src #+RESULTS: : |: |: |: : true.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi there,
 been using Org Mode as my knowledge base for a good amount of time. I am using org-roam and I am very satisfied with it. 
 Naturally, I want to expand my emacs and orgmode usage to task management as well, for which I am using Todoist at the moment. For better or worse I am stuck in the Apple ecosystem at my day job and Todoist allows me to easily capture (and more importantly autmatic sync) my tasks on:
  
 My phone via the sharing menu
  Through a custom iOS shortcut
  Through their browser extension
  On my mac via a global keyboard shortcut (even when the application is not focused)
  
I have already tried beorg on my phone to replace some of that functionality. While it was pretty feature-rich, and I applaud the app author for what they've done - my manual approach to syncing with Git added a lot of friction, where Todoist mostly stays out of my way.
 The desire to stop using proprietary software is great though, so I want to ask about your setups for capturing tasks on multiple platforms. What do you use to capture tasks on mobile and outside of emacs on the desktop and what are your syncing strategies for when new tasks are added to a .org file (preferably without manual commits, ... )? Do some of you maybe even use emacs/orgmode in conjunction with other software for these use cases?
 Thanks a lot, hope to get some valuable input from you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm learning how to use Emacs with one main idea in mind. I need a powerful system to track and annotate books that I am reading. I installed org-roam and want to start learning it by using it along side a book I am reading (a physical copy).
 An example of what I'm trying to do is the quote "transmigration of souls" in this book. What I would like to do is link this quote to a org-roam note to document my thoughts. What attracted me to org-roam in the first place is that with back-linking, if I ever read my note on "transmigration of souls" (say, encounter it in another book) in the future, I see that it was referenced in this book (and whatever other sources).
 How would I go about turning an ebook into "org-roam" file that I could then link from and too (as in books that reference each other). I also seek to use "org-roam" files as books to allow grepping/annotating/etc.
 If I am doing this incorrectly, asking the wrong question, or misusing the concept behind org-roam please let me know. I also don't know if "org-roam file" is the right term. Is it an "org-roam file" a "org-mode file" or a txt file with org-roam/mode notation?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As a long time Emacs fan, I finally broke down and decided to go through the hoops of installing emacs on my work PC (Windows). I went here https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/download.html and scrolled down to the "Windows" section. (as a side note, the FTP web interface links default to http, but you can also manually enter https. Not sure what's up with that.) 
 Under the FTP links I noticed a helpful little hint if you'd like to validate the downloads. 
  
The Windows binaries are signed by Corwin Brust 
 ECE7 7CF4 17C7 6C1A CFCE 7C2B 5B61 3551 1580 F007
  
The .sig files provided along side each download file reference this same fingerprint, but after hours of searching... I can't figure out how to get the public GPG key with this fingerprint. I figured out the commands I would use to validate the downloads if I could find the key, but that doesn't help me much. It seems like a fairly large security oversight to leave this information to the imagination of the reader.
 Does anyone know how to resolve this issue? I might just need the server address that I can pass to gpg --keyserver "<address>" --receive-keys <fingerprint> .

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am trying out different packages around python development in emacs. I must confess I haven't had a lot of success getting everything to work and I am somewhat confused. So I am looking for some suggestions. 
 Elpy
 Elpy seems to come with a lot of features out of the box and I am able to get it to work. However, I have noticed a noticeable lag when typing code. It may be due to flymake. I am wondering if someone has found a good workaround this? 
 LSP mode
 I couldn't get it to work. My modeline says LSP[Disconnected]. I found this old thread but it wasn't very helpful. Does anyone have a solution for this? 
 Eglot mode
 I could get it to work and it worked pretty well out of the box. I am wondering how to get elpy like features: quick code navigation, testing, opening interpreter for the buffer? 
 tldr: 
  
Is there a noticeable lag in elpy? Is the lag just to flymake? Is there some customization that gets rid of the lag (or flymake)?
 
Can Eglot be customized to get elpy like features: code navigation, IDE like behaviors? 
 
How to get lsp-mode to connect to the server or (debug this issue)? Is it possible to customize it with features similar to elpy? 
 
 Thank you for your time and suggestions!

 Another newbie question: Does anyone here use Safari with org-capture? I'm using Emacs Plus and I *think* it may have org-protocol already out of the box. I'm looking to capture web pages with a bookmarklet for Safari. If anyone out there has a setup that works, could you please share it? I've been going nuts for a few days trying to get it to work to no avail. I've found JS bookmarklets that work with Chrome and Firefox but not Safari and I don't know nearly enough code to fix it.
 Thanks in advance for any help or suggestions.

I discovered to my satisfaction that renaming files via right-clicking the file path not only works for files in the media folder linked to with the ![]() syntax, but also for files linked to with file://. But: If I rename a file linked to with file://, the latter strangely is deleted after the renaming and needs to be added again in order for the link to work.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So every time I find a file, I do C-x C-f and then /**/fileName.
 What it does is it recursively searches through the current directory to find the file I want. This allows me to not specify the exact subdirectory the file is in. 
 I want to write a small wrapper over find-file function which automatically does this and then map a key to it.
 So for eg, when I type C-x C-r (my key map for this new function), it should prompt me with
 Find-file: current-directory/**/ 
 I would also be content with any other way to recursively find a file in the sub directories of a folder. It is insane, this is so hard to do in emacs. It's a breeze in vim. I don't want to use projectile and all, my folders are just plain text notes, they are not code files or projects most of the time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've looked around and not found very detailed or conclusive information on the subject of symbolic calculation with Haskell. So in Sage I can type in sin(pi) and I get back 0. However, in Haskell I get 1.2246467991473532e-16 which is Informatique brutal. Also, you can do this in Sage: simplify(arccos(sin(pi/3))) and get back 1/6*pi Right. Just like sqrt(2) gives back sqrt(2) and if you want the actual number you have to tell it explicitly numerical_approx(sqrt(2), digits=60) All out of the box. What's Sage doing that Haskell isn't, and can Haskell do this? Python also have "symbolic" capabilities as well. This would tie into comparisons like 
 (sqrt 2 - 1) == (1 / (sqrt 2 + 1) 
 and such, i.e., to actually calculate sqrt 2 on both sides would probably cause a False.

 Why does it create an ID for this outline section as well, when in fact I just want to create ONE node only, for Meditation in this case.
 Is this a bug? Something I can configure differently?

Ich bin vor wenigen Wochen auf die Zettelkasten-Methode gestossen, habe inzwischen viel recherchiert und heute mit dem Lesen des Buchs von Sascha Fast begonnen.
Die Methode lässt mich nicht los und überzeugt mich im Grunde. Selber bin ich auch ein Wissensarbeiter, allerdings kein Wissenschaftler oder Autor: Das Schreiben von Büchern oder Artikeln - worin die offensichtliche Stärke des Zettelkastens liegt - ist für mich nicht relevant. Ich bin mir bewusst, dass die Einführung und die Pflege des Zettelkastens viel Aufwand erfordert. Nun frage ich mich, ob sich dieser Aufwand für mich dennoch lohnen würde. Für mich wäre der Zettelkasten "bloss" eine Wissens- oder sogar nur Informationsdatenbank; also ein Nachschlagewerk ohne daraus neue Texte generieren zu müssen /wollen.
Rechtfertigt der Aufwand vor diesem Hintergrund den Ertrag?]]></summary>

When I insert an image (or other file) into an Org Roam note, how can I set it so that it copies that file to roam/images/ so that I don't break any links when syncing to my other server? Basically, I want org roam to be self-contained and not rely on files inserted from outside of the directory, if that's possible?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm fairly new to org-mode but have been doing a deep dive for about 2 months now. I'm trying to build out a workflow for a specific task (or better yet a set of tasks) and I need to change up a few capture templates depending on specifics of what I'm trying to capture. Instead of having a different keybinding for each individual capture type, I was thinking it'd be nice to create my own little menu like how org export dispatcher does.
 Is this possible, or more specifically, would anyone know where to look to find some guidance documentation on this? I'm kind of hoping it's something that can be done in lisp but I guess we'll see?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I also posted this in a tips & tricks thread a while back but got no replies.
 I have a script which uses a lot of carriage returns to update a progress percentage, then another carriage return to display the done message. When I run this in compilation-mode, it will typically replace these messages with a [...]. If I hit enter or click on this, it will display the full message, but I'd rather it not be hidden in the first place. 
 I'm not sure how to describe this well enough to get any useful search results nor look for variables to tweak, I don't know what to call this. Does anyone know how to get compilation mode to not collapse messages like this?

 Somehow when I do (setq repeat-keep-prefix t), the repeat maps stop working altogether.
 I tried various things like emacs -Q, toggling repeat-mode off and on since that's how it takes into account new keymaps, I tried reloading my init file and I also tried on different OSes (windows and linux).
 Does anyone else have the same issue?

 I have worked with Pyspark before. My Boss gave me a task that i have to solve with Scala. 
 Simple Data Ingest, Transform and Save Dataframe as a JSON File Task. Ingest and Transformation works, but when I want to save as a JSON File it Creates a Folder with a Folder named "_temporary" with some more folders in it and in the end an empty JSON file. 
 This is my code:
  
import org.apache.spark.sql.SparkSession 
 object LoadData extends App { 
 val spark = SparkSession.builder
 .master("local[*]")
 .appName("Sample App")
 .getOrCreate() 
 val df = spark.read.options(Map("inferSchema"->"true", "header"->"true")).csv("C:\\Users\\MYNAME\\Downloads/gasdata.csv")
 val df2 = df.drop("CALENDARYEAR")
 val new_column_names=df2.columns.map(c=>c.toLowerCase())
 val df3 = df2.toDF(new_column_names:_*)
 df3.show()
 df3.write.json("C:\\Users\\MYNAME\\Downloads/data_standartized.json") 
  
Transformation works fine. df3.show() shows correct DF. How can I save it as a JSON file? Nothing I try works. 
 I am coding in IntelliJ.
 Build.sbt content:
  
name := "SparkTest"
 version := "0.1"
 scalaVersion := "2.11.12"
 libraryDependencies ++= Seq(
 "org.apache.spark" %% "spark-core" % "2.4.6",
 "org.apache.spark" %% "spark-sql" % "2.4.6"
 )

 Can someone educate me on how to replace control + x to space.
 ​
 Solutions:
 Firstly I want to thank everyone who took time to reply to my question:
 u/miraged_camel u/bigguy4_x_4 u/MunsterPlop u/QueenOfHatred u/flexibeast u/zapylaev u/amizya u/samsjj u/tiddler u/takutekato u/WallyMetropolis
  
We can use general.el as described by my friend u/bigguy4_x_4 and this has been implemented by my friend u/miraged_camel
 We can swap control with caps like u/QueenOfHatred mentioned and can be implemented by the links provided by u/zapylaev, u/QueenOfHatred or we can use karabiner as mentioned by u/amizya , u/samzjj and u/tiddler
 Or we can do as the lisp god u/takutekato suggested or we can stick to doom.
 We can use roll your modal as mentioned by u/WallyMetropolis.

Now I want to be able to get a feed from arXiv, which (in short) is an open repository of (mostly) scientific papers to keep up to date with what is published in my field.
 So my general question is how does Elfeed work in terms of data, but in particular:
  
Does it download everything to my computer?
 Do "already read items" get archived somewhere or are just deleted after a given period of time?
 Is there a way to bookmark or store some of them locally for future reference?
  
Thanks in advance for all your help; I apologize if my questions are too basic (and probably more on RSS feeds/clients in general more than on Elfeed).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Define a function called mountain that draws a mountain of height n and width that can be climbed from the east (right). Widen the mountain from top to bottom by one character per line. The mountain should consist of '#' characters, with the different levels of the mountain separated by the newline character. No more new line characters at the end of the mountain. A mountain with a negative height should be equal to a height of 0, so in this case the result should be an empty list.
 mountain :: Int -> String 
 mountain = unlines (map (??) [1 .. n])
 ​
 Example:
 mountain 0 == ""
 mountain 1 == "#"
 mountain 2 == "#\n##"
 mountain 3 == "#\n##\n###"

 I'm a n00b in this so anything I say can totally not make sense.

 def calculateDotProduct(v1: Map[String, Double], v2: Map[String, Double]): Double = {

 v1.map(e => (e._2, v2.getOrElse(e._1, 0: Double))) .map(t => t._1 * t._2) .sum 
 val test_v2_first =
 v2.map(e => (e._2, v1.getOrElse(e._1, 0: Double))) .map(t => t._1 * t._2) .sum } 
 This should be commutative right? Strangely it isn't and I get test1=0 and test2=5000 for the following maps, 5000 is right because "supremes" is the only key available in both maps:

 Its getting more weird, I found that v1.map(e => (e._2, v2.getOrElse(e._1, 0: Double))) 
 results into

Book and article names, the types of properties that different primates have, lecture titles, and links to the notes, homework, and readings for that particular lecture. These types of materials often have relatively long lines.
 When I try to use tables in Org Mode, the results are unreadable.
 Before I hit tab, the results are fine if a bit basic.
 https://preview.redd.it/hzoxzaxb5f591.png?width=1319&format=png&auto=webp&s=b993d4c1dbd59e2d9beee8a62427278e9551ff76
 But when I tab or hit enter, the columns are out of alignment to the point where one column is under the next.
 https://preview.redd.it/jjbonp3g5f591.png?width=1336&format=png&auto=webp&s=49d3fb66573f1444df01bbbbdf17f2a6da32530d
 I tried setting the width for each cell by making a row at the top, but that didn't seem to change anything.
 Is there some setting in Org Mode I can toggle to change this? Some attribute I need to set for each table? I have visual line mode and wordwrap enabled. Do I need to turn those off? Is there another package I should be using? Is there some error in my formatting?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, 
 I am working on some emulator and I am almost finished with the "library". I am not really a frontend/web dev guy and I've never worked on GUI in Haskell. So my thoughts is to deploy this web app on some single page web app without a database, no hyperlinks, etc. Basically something like what one would see when you visit the [egui](https://www.egui.rs/) library.
 I have considered Elm but I'm not sure if it's the right tool for the job. I've looked into Yesod and Servant but they seem like they're for full-featured web apps with backends. 
 I wonder if there's anything like this in the Haskell ecosystem? Or if someone can point me in the right direction on how websites like [egui's](https://www.egui.rs/) are deployed? If Elm is a good option, will it be possible for Elm to call Haskell code without needing a backend like Servant?
 Thanks :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[org-roam-dailies-goto-today opens todays journal in the current window, but I'd prefer to open it in on other-window. 
 Internally this command uses org-capture-goto-target:
 (defun org-capture-goto-target (&optional template-key) "Go to the target location of a capture template. If TEMPLATE-KEY is nil, the user is queried for the template." (interactive) (let ((entry (org-capture-select-template template-key))) (unless entry (error "No capture template selected")) (org-capture-set-plist entry) (org-capture-set-target-location) (pop-to-buffer-same-window (org-capture-get :buffer)) (goto-char (org-capture-get :pos)))) 
 taken from org-capture.el
 As you can see it says pop-to-buffer-same-window, not other window.
 Any workaround for this?
 Edit: Here's my workaround
 (defun ugt-org-roam-dailies-goto-today nil "Open todays journal in other window." (interactive) (split-window-right) (other-window 1) (org-roam-dailies-goto-today))

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Coming from Roam Research to org-roam, I miss the conceptual distinction between page references and block references. In org-roam, whenever I'd like to insert a link to a node via C-c n i, I am offered a long list of nodes that represent files AND links to outline items that I have linked to.
 So when I try to link to a document called Emacs, I see a very long list of nodes mentioning Emacs, amongh which there's also my entry Emacs. My current workaround is to enter ^Emacs in the node search field (^ is a regular expression denoting beginning of line), but that maybe there's a more elegant solution?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Started using org-roam, and I'm loving it. 
 Here's one thing I cannot seem to change:
 I would love to have a newline below title section and first journal entry, but no matter what I do, it won't work.
 Here's my org-roam-dailies-capture-templates
 (setq org-roam-dailies-capture-templates '(("d" "default" entry "\n* %<%H:%M> %?\n:properties:\n:created: %U\n:end:\n" :target (file+head "%<%Y-%m-%d>.org" "#+title: %u\n#+startup: content\n\n") :unnarrowed t))) 
 As you can see, I have inserted two newlines to finish the file+head string:
 "%<%Y-%m-%d>.org" "#+title: %u\n#+startup: content\n\n" 
 But every time I create a first entry for the day, it won't have a newline below title section and it looks crammed like this:
 :PROPERTIES: :ID: 2022-06-13T115442.743517 :END: #+title: [2022-06-13 Mon] #+startup: content <--- No newline below this!? * 11:54 Test :properties: :created: [2022-06-13 Mon 11:54] :end: * 11:54 Test :properties: :created: [2022-06-13 Mon 11:54] :end: 
 How can I make org-roam insert the desired amount of newlines after title section?

 Although which-key displays its contents they don't seem to respond to keyboard navigation or mouse clicks until you exit it and apply the commands in buffers.

 [[1,2,3], [2,3,3], [2,4,3], [1,2,3], [4,4,2], [2,2,2]] 
 How to count occurrence of X value in the last value of each list. 
 CountOcc :: Int -> [[Int]] -> Int
 ex:
 test = CountOcc 3 [[1,2,3], [2,3,3], [2,4,3], [1,2,3], [4,4,2], [2,2,2]]
 Would return 4, because '3' is the last value in 3 lists.
 test2 = CountOcc 2 [[1,2,2], [2,3,3], [2,4,3], [1,2,3], [4,4,2], [2,2,2]]
 Would return 3, because '2' is the last value in 3 lists. 
 Not sure what is the best approach
 I was thinking checking if value is in list for each list in list
 counttest :: Int -> [Int] -> Bool
 counttest val xs = val == last xs
 counttest 3 [1,2,3]
 this hsould return true

 Say I have list of lists:
 [[201,4,2],[201,3,2],[201,2,2],[201,1,2],[301,1,3],[401,1,4],[501,1,5]]
 I would like to insert a list to a new list based on some condition and then insert the remaining lists from the original list to the end of the new list.
 My thinking in pseudo code would be something like this:
 var tempList = list;
 var timer = 0;foreach(var list in lists){
 if(list[2] == condition && timer < condition){
 timer = timer + 10;tempList.Add(list)
 lists.remove(list)
 }
 ... other condition similar to the top
 }
 return tempList + lists (concatenate old list to new list)
 ​
 In Haskell, I think I would need to use map, and maybe create two function one that returns the lsit of list and one that do the check for each list? I'm really not sure about haskell. thank you
 What I started:
 newTab :: tc -> [[Int]] -> [[Int]]
 newTab [] = []
 newTab (x:xs) =
 let timer = 0
 if (x!!2) == 2 && if timer < 15
 then timer + tc --add list to new list

So about a year ago, I stumbled upon BSAB and Zettelkasten. Since then, I've been refining my processes time to time (and obviously falling off the habit of capturing etc).
The reason why I'm making this post today is to open up a discussion, or possibly explore the possibilities of a BSAB+Zettelkasten hybrid.
Before I begin, I'm going to assume everyone here knows what BSAB and Zettelkasten are and their respective objectives.
In short... (let me know if i got it wrong)
Building A Second Brain (BASB) is a PKM model focused on the capturing and digesting information with the objective of DELIVERING PROJECTS.
For example, a project could mean giving a 15min talk about self development, and then whatever I capture goes into there and slowly, the content expands an…]]></summary>

 However, it'll be great if I could also view the internal compiler representation of this variable. Specifically, what will the variable look like if we evaluated the sequence until the first or fifth Fibonacci, etc.? Is there a way to see the compiler's view of lazy variables?

 I've started with scalajs-react. Overall the experience was good (perhaps the overloaded API is my biggest concern, but we can live with that). Then I stumbled upon a problem where I need to propagate a state change from two leaf components and found out I need something like this Redux thing. I trtied built-in StateSnapshot, but couldn't make it working. Then I googled for Scala-land alternatives and it seems like there are few semi-abandoned Redux facades and Diode. Diode looks like what I need, but:
  
No Scala 3 support
 See side-note
  
Side-note: at some point I decided to give up on React and tried Tyrian (Elm architecture). The experience was a total blast. CE3-friendly, Dotty-first etc etc. And I would stay with it, but I realised that I desperately need React.js ecosystem. And Tyrian seems to be quite poor at interoperability. 
 Anyways, I'm looking for something that can solve state propagation problem for scalajs-react, but with Scala 3 support.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, 
 I have recently started using pdf-tools, and I am loving it so far. The outline and annotation features are so well integrated with the emacs experience.
 I have managed to use display-buffer-alist to move the outline window to hte left and cover a certain ratio of the screen: 
  (customize-set-variable 'display-buffer-alist '(("^\\*outline" display-buffer-in-side-window (side . left) (window-width . 0.35) (inhibit-switch-frame . t)))) 
 However, I can't seem to do the same with the annotations windows as they have dynamic titles. I am trying to understand: 
  
how to move the annotation (and the associated contents and editing) windows to the left rather than the right
 how I can control their widths
 how I can make the modeline in the windows go away without disturbing the very nice black outline that surrounds them (using hide-mode-line does this...)
  
If you have some clues/tips/configurations that might be helpful, please do share!

 Say I have this list of lists: [[201,2,2], [201,3,2], [201,1,2], [301,1,3], [401,1,4], [501,1,5]]
 I managed to order this list by the last value in each list. but now, I would like to order by the second value only if the last value is equal to another list with the same last value. So the result would be :
 [[201,1,2], [201,2,2], [201,3,2], [301,1,3], [401,1,4], [501,1,5]] (changes in the first 3 list)
 I was thinking maybe bubble sort? thank you

 I changed org-startup-folded to t, but that didn't change anything. 
 What am I missing?
 Edit
 I could advice TAB or outline-cycle to fire (org-hide-drawer-all), but this shouldn't be necassry because previously I did not have any hooks or advices.
 Edit 2
 This is what I have in my org-cycle-hook variable:
 ``` org-cycle-hook is a variable defined in ‘org.el’.
 Its value is (org-hide-drawer-all org-cycle-hide-archived-subtrees org-cycle-hide-drawers org-cycle-show-empty-lines org-optimize-window-after-visibility-change)
 Original value was (org-cycle-hide-archived-subtrees org-cycle-hide-drawers org-cycle-show-empty-lines org-optimize-window-after-visibility-change) ```
 Edit 3
 Opening Emacs via emacs -Q, then opening an org file, I see that the property drawers are hidden when I cycle via TAB key.

 I installed Doom Emacs and 'm liking it so far, despite the learning curve, but I need to be able to take a screenshot of selected text. I've found org-screenshot-take, but it's limited by the size of my screen. What I'd like is to be able to make a large image of my entire selection. I've used Atom before, it had a package that did just that. I haven't really used VScode, but out of curiosity I checked it out, and it has CodeSnap, which also does exactly what I need.
 I tried looking on the internet, and there are some packages that maybe do what I want, but I tried installing one, and it's complaining about "transient 0.2.0" being unavailable. I tried looking that up, but I don't feel like I'm savvy enough to solve this issue.
 Is there a simpler solution I'm missing? Thank you in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am trying to set up Emacs to work on a Raspberry Pi 4 with Raspberry Pi OS installed, Raspbian GNU/Linux 10 (buster).
 I am running GNU Emacs 26.1 (build 2, arm-unknown-linux-gnueabihf, GTK+ Version 3.24.5) of 2021-02-06, modified by Debian. This appears to be the most recent version built.
 I have set the "Default Font" using the interactive menus and by editing the .emacs file directly. In either case what I think are the appropriate values are saved in .emacs but when I start the GUI version of Emacs, it opens with a small font, gets momentarily larger as I've specified in my .emacs file, but only for a split second. Then it changes again to a small font.
 I have reduced the .emacs file to contain only the custom-set-faces function, and still see this behavior. I have no idea what is causing this to happen. I am using the same function in an Emacs install on Windows 10, and on the current release of MacOS successfully, both have a more recent version of Emacs however.
 Here is what was in the minimum .emacs file that caused the undesired behavior:
 (custom-set-faces ;; custom-set-faces was added by Custom. ;; If you edit it by hand, you could mess it up, so be careful. ;; Your init file should contain only one such instance. ;; If there is more than one, they won't work right. '(default ((t (:family "DejaVu Sans Mono" :foundry "PfEd" :slant normal :weight normal :height 241 :width normal))))) 
 Any suggestions of what to look into? I have googled every way of phrasing it I can think of, and haven't succeeded in finding anyone talking about this.

In any event, I'm wondering how you maintain "rhythm" or momentum while reading "as if writing is all that matters". I find that, as soon as I started reading with the intention of creating notes, my reading pace comes to a screeching halt, and I never finish anything I start. Alternatively, I read and only mark interesting ideas, but then I find the process of turning them all into notes overwhelming and I never do that. I suspect I'm trying to take too many notes, but maybe there's some better process I could use. Help?
What's your system?]]></summary>

 Basically, the text/or fonts are just not rendered properly in pdf-view-mode, and either looks corrupted or in some cases is simply missing. The issue is most prominent with LaTeX compiled documents - see this image of a pdf file that was created by exporting from an org file. If I open the pdf in Zathura, it looks perfectly fine, and the same when I switch to doc-view-mode. 
 What's even stranger is that this seems to occur totally randomly - some pdfs show up perfectly fine, while others end up looking like gibberish. Sometimes, a minor change in a .org file will cause it to export to a perfectly fine pdf (via C-c C-e l o after continually showing a scrambled document.
 Has anyone else had a similar experience?
 I had an issue a few weeks ago where epdfinfo was not compiling properly after an update, but I managed to sort it out by switching to the latest package on Melpa. 
 Using Emacs 27.2, with pdf-tools version 20220522.13 on Manjaro.

 I see numerous posts asking how to compile or run a program with a single key.
 Usually, the answers are always to bind a key to compile or some other custom function or to invoke a shell. These solutions have many disadvantages:
  
The custom function is always very specific to a given project. The key bound to that function will not be useful in another project.
 The compile command (or custom function) allows only one action. Sure, you can type a different target (if you use make) on each compile invocation to run main or execute your tests, but it is quite limited. projectile provides 2-3 more commands. This is nice, but still limited.

 How do I hide the buffer level-property that has the file-ID? (See below for example). I would like to always collapse it. Usually I do this by setting (org-cycle-hide-drawers STATE) and org-cycle-hook, and that will collapse all the property drawers when I open an org file, but it won't effect the top level property it seems.

 Anyone have working examples of this?
 If I have to roll my own, I'm guessing the easiest and most lightweight option is to use org-cite and an ox-export template.

 ​
 ​
 I've seen this config repo which is really cool and easy to read and basically works this way: the init files does some preliminary stuff, then loads all the files in the /core and /config directory. I've seen that if i compile the byte code of the scripts in /config by themselves, there are some warnings of variables and functions not defined. The included files do not have explicit dependencies because everything is automatically included by the init file. 
 ​
 So the question is: is there a better approach on structuring an emacs config among multiple files?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I just merged some changes I've been working on the past few days. A new predicate is added, named rifle (because it searches like org-rifle does), or smart (because it really does feel like a "smart search" that just finds what I meant). It works so well that I've made it the default predicate (i.e. it's used for plain-string query tokens, ones without a specified predicate; previously the regexp predicate was used for them). 
 It seems to be working well, especially with the new org-ql-find command and some supporting internal changes that optimize queries that use the new predicate. 
 These changes are now in the master branch and will be in the next MELPA build, and then they will be in the 0.7 stable release. Any feedback would be appreciated.

        <updated>2022-06-11T12:51:48.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am a Haskell beginner, and in my projects I often work with tree-like types, e.g. this one:
 data Expr = Add Expr Expr | Sub Expr Expr | Mul Expr Expr | Num Float | Var String 
 Or this one:
 data Pattern = Word String | Sequence [Pattern] | OneOf [Pattern] 
 And I want to transform them in a way which may change the node types themselves or even insert/remove nodes, e.g.:
 precomputeSums :: Expr -> Expr precomputeSums expr = case expr of Add (Num x) (Num y) -> Num (x + y) Add a b -> Add (precomputeSums a) (precomputeSums b) Sub a b -> Sub (precomputeSums a) (precomputeSums b) Mul a b -> Mul (precomputeSums a) (precomputeSums b) otherwise -> expr precomputeDifferences expr = ... precomputeProducts expr = ...even more duplicate logic... removeEmptySequences :: Pattern -> Pattern removeEmptySequences pat = case pat of OneOf items -> OneOf $ filter (/= (Sequence [])) items Sequence items -> Sequence $ filter (/= (Sequence [])) items otherwise -> pat 
 As you can see, some lines in these functions contain pretty much duplicate logic: the matched node type (Add/Sub/Mul or OneOf/Sequence) varies, but the operations on its children are exactly the same. This gets worse when I have many such datatypes and many recursive functions. Apart from the first case arm, the function only cares whether a node is a terminal (and cannot be recursed into) or a non-terminal (an intermediate node with zero or more children).
 I feel like there must exist a generic solution for this, where I would define a way of retrieving children from a given node once, and the recursion and distribution over data constructors would happen automatically. It feels a bit like a Functor, but, well, not a Functor (my types are not even generic).
 Is there a typeclass or something else that can help me here?
 Thanks!

 I tried digging around, and I found how to map mouse buttons to other inputs, but I couldn't figure out how to map something into C or M. Everything in Moving The Ctrl Key only talks about specific things like mapping caps lock to it.

Today, i have developed the app Metanote which fully supports org-mode and can bring the same experience as in emacs or even better(thanks to mobile).
 I recommend Metanote to you and hope more people know about it, use it, and support me as i continue to develop it and make it better.
 You can find it by searching for "metanote" in Google Play Store or visit Metanote home page

 Nowadays, Org mode only supports Emacs 25+ and it is unclear whether we need the above change. Some users are dissatisfied that Org forcefully changes the defaults [2].
 This post is a help request to Org users who use right-to-left languages. Do you experience any issues with Org and Emacs performance if you change bidi-paragraph-direction to its default value of nil?

How would you start from a clean directory to build a new .emacs.d? What I want: - preserve my idiosyncratic key binding (mostly) and definitely no vi bindings - load org mode and enable source blocks - load auc-Tex - load a fair number of other packages. The major issue I’m looking to fix is dependency management — with my current stuff, there are deprecated and obsolete packages that warm, but tracking them down is a pain. Is there anything that does a better job with dependencies than the default?

 I have been trying to hack something together (see below), it doesn't produce an error but it also doesn't work. Fundamentally I just don't think I understand the :annotate keyword/function in consult.
 Any chance someone would be willing to give me a hand with this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Howdy, folks. Curious if anyone has come up with a good way to handle viewing stdout/stderr of Org Babel code blocks -- particularly sh/shell and sometimes async -- in real-time? I'm leaning quite heavily on code blocks for some technical documentation Literate DevOps-style and some of the commands I run can take 20-30 seconds or more. It would be nice to see what's going on in a buffer or frame while the command is doing its thing.
 I found a random .el file on GH called ob-shstream.el but it seems to have some problems with undefined functions or functions that have been renamed since it was written (ex: fourth -> cl-fourth) and I'm not a great elisp hacker so I'm not sure I want to try to clean it up if there are other options out there.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Gnus has a limitation that it cannot bind more than one "from" sending method to the same outgoing server. This means that my three different gmail sending methods won't normally work despite using different credentials.
 My work-around is effective, though it has a couple of limitations. Here's what I do:
 edit my /etc/hosts file to include "aliases" to the same IP address, which IP I can usually get by. eg, using ping. The lines in /etc/hosts end up looking something like this:
 74.125.142.109 smtp.gmail2.com 74.125.142.109 smtp.gmail3.com 
 At that point I just say to Gnus that my outgoing server is using the gmail2, or gmail3 server, etc. Problems with this are for some of my outgoing servers on dynamic IPs that periodically change, meaning that I need to change my etc/hosts file to keep up with their changes. The other problem builds on this since I changed to guix, when changing my etc hosts isn't as trivial as it once was, this is constructed from guix reconfigure, which can be more time consuming. Does anyone have a more graceful work around?

 I need this to look up something, and create something new if there is no match in the previous lookup.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have the following procedure that runs from within .emacs file to prepare an Emacs instance for work.
 ;; Open three windows and run three terminals in one of them (defun emacs-workflow-open () ;(interactive) (split-window-right) (other-window 1) (split-window-below) (other-window 1) (multi-term) (rename-buffer "term-run") (multi-term) (rename-buffer "term-test") (multi-term) (rename-buffer "term") (switch-to-buffer "term-run")) (add-hook 'after-init-hook #'emacs-workflow-open) (add-to-list 'package-archives '("org" .

 The problem is that the PLAN.org file never has Org-Mode enabled when an instance launches. Instead, I have to enable it manually every time after launch.
 However, today I noticed that it did enable when I got en error from another, unrelated line of .emacs file (package called Sly and is unrelated to Org-Mode). That is, if the execution of .emacs was not fully complete, then the Org-Mode was enabled by default in that file. What is going on? How can I fix it so that it is enabled by default at all times, whenever a new instance is launched?

 Ok, now I got the culprit with the help of u/yantar92 . Actually I wasn't following files, but I had added two more org link types via org-add-link-type (page: and journal:). And I hadn't defined actions for those in org-link-frame-setup.

 So my workaround is this:
 (let* ((result (ivy-read "Search or enter new page name: " #'counsel-fzf-function :re-builder #'ivy--regex-fuzzy :dynamic-collection t)) (page-name (if (or (string= result "Nothing found") (string= result "error code 1")) ;; ;; This here is redundant as I have typed it in `ivy-read` anyway (read-string "Enter new page name: ") (file-name-sans-extension (file-name-nondirectory result)))) (page-filename (replace-regexp-in-string "[ ]+" "-" page-name))) (list result page-name page-filename)) 
 I try to read via ivy-read, if it finds nothing, I let the user type his initial search again via (read-string "Enter new page name: "). This is not user friendly.
 So I would like to know: Is there a way to get the input in the first step via ivy-read?
 Edit
 Or to put it this way:
 How can I get the user input if completing-read has no match?

 My solution:
 getIndexZero :: (Eq a) => a -> [a] -> Int getIndexZero = ((fromJust .).elemIndex) getIndexOne :: (Eq a) => a -> [a] -> Int getIndexOne = (((1 + ) . ) . getIndexZero) solve :: Int -> [Int] -> [Int] solve 0 _ = [] solve n list = (solve (n-1) list) ++ [getIndexOne (getIndexOne n list) list] 
 Any other approach that could eliminate the recursive function? Still Looks a bit like imperative style to me. Do let me know if there's any other subreddit dedicated to these kinds of questions.

In Neovim (using treesitter as well) this is highlighted correctly. Right now my setup includes only typescript-mode, tree-sitter and tree-sitter-langs. And I activate them manually, first typescript-mode and then the tree-sitter ones. I notice treesitter highlight it's active, but still don't know why the parser seems to stuggle when it doesn't in Neovim, aren't those the same parsers anyways?
 ​
 Notice the different <div> </div> highlights
 As I said I'm new to Emacs so sorry if I'm missing something:
 This is what I have to config this:
  (use-package typescript-mode) (use-package tree-sitter) (use-package tree-sitter-langs) (global-tree-sitter-mode) 
 Then I activate the modes as I mentioned earlier. Any help is welcomed.
 ​
 The same code but in Neovim (also with tree-sitter)
 Pd.: I've tried multiple themes.
 Update: Changed example images to simpler ones.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Idk much at all about Haskell tbh. I’m only using it for the first time here so I can implement some lambdas and I thought this language would be the best.
 Here are a few I made which all seem to work fine…
 succ = (\x f y -> f( x f y )) 
 zero = (\x y -> y) 
 one = succ(zero) 
 two = succ(one) 
 three = succ(two) 
 add = (\x y -> x succ y) 
 true = (\x y -> x) 
 false = (\x y -> y) 
 and = (\x y -> x y false) 
 not = (\x -> x false true) 
  
these used to read church numerals and booleans
  
incr = (\n-> n + 1) 
 eval = (\n -> n(incr)(0))
 bval = (\b -> b(“true”)(“false”) 
 Now things get weird when I try this…
 isZero = (\x -> x false not false)
 This function works if I apply zero and one…
 bval(isZero(zero)) => “true”
 bval(isZero(one)) => “false”
 …but not any numbers greater. 
 bval(isZero(two)) => error
 When it type checks it says it can’t construct an infinite type. 
 Similarly, when I define a predecessor, it works if I apply one thing to it, but I can’t seem to apply it to things, eg
 eval(pred(three)) => 2
 eval(pred(four)) => 3
 eval(two pred four) => error
 Can anyone explain what’s happening? Why these work in the lambda calculus but not in Haskell?
 EDIT: some for clarity and format

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[hello,
 Since emacs was reccomended to me many times, I decided to sit down and go through the tutorial. 
 Immediately though the idea that you navigate with "f" for forward, "b" for backwards, "n" for next line, "p" for previous seems counterintuitive. The keys have no logical physical relationship to each other. I am not going to remember the mnemonics. 
 Is there some bigger picture rationality that will fall into place if I go on or is the whole thing so arbitrary? 
 I did like the concepts of how the navigation worked. I can really see how it would be fast if learned.
 Not sure I will be able to acheive comfort with what I am seeing. I dont work in the kind of environment where I'd be able to practice all day. just on my own time. 
 thoughts? encouragement?

 I am using eglot for python (and yaml, latex). Today I was fixing some big python code base, and I realize that I have no simple way of running the tests. I did a quick search in the Emacs web site, but they recommend python-pytest or pytest or elpy, I discarded the first one since it depends on projectile (and I prefer project.el) the second one was updated four years ago and elpy seems to overlap with eglot. 
 So I am assumming that I am doing something wrong... Currently I am using eglot AND elpy, but only using elpy for run tests ... Any advice?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A couple of days ago, a post was made about modelling data in Scala 3 with types, and the OP was asked "yes, but what use is it?".
 I've developed an interesting use for this kind of thing with opaque types and inlines: https://scastie.scala-lang.org/mmmB090CRFqUgGYhpvyX9w
 ```scala import scala.compiletime.constValue import scala.compiletime.error import scala.compiletime.ops.int.ToString import scala.util.Failure import scala.util.Success import scala.util.Try
 //probably replaceable with IsConst, but IsConst is @experimental trait SingletonType[T]: inline val t: T
 object SingletonType: transparent inline given [T]: SingletonType[T] = new SingletonType[T]: inline val t = constValue[T]
 object Test: opaque type PositiveInt <: Int = Int 
 object PositiveInt: inline def apply[T <: Int & Singleton](using s: SingletonType[T]): PositiveInt = inline if s.t >= 0 then s.t else error("Cannot interpret " + constValue[ToString[T]] + " as PositiveInt")
 def apply(i:Int): Try[PositiveInt] = if i >= 0 then Success(i) else Failure(new Exception(s"Cannot interpret $i as PositiveInt")) 
 import Test.PositiveInt //needed to keep the opaque type opaque
 val a = PositiveInt[4] //val b = PositiveInt[-2] //compile-time error "Cannot interpret -2 as PositiveInt" val c: Try[PositiveInt] = PositiveInt(a) //runtime check ```
 Please note that these kinds of checks can be extended to other types that support singletons (Strings for example). Strings are not as well supported by scala 3 when it comes to inline if, so you have to check the data at compile time using macros, making things slightly more complicated, but it still works.
 I'm still trying to find a way to generalize this pattern, but in any case, I think it's very useful. It allows you to transform data at compile time to a more specific type, and have compile-time errors if your data doesn't match the necessary predicates.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm looking for a blog post I read a couple of years ago, I think it references Haskell quite a bit but it wasn't primarily about the language itself. I've been trying to find it for a while now, hopefully someone here remembers it.
 The core idea was that when devs compare programming languages, when they look down towards lower level languages they see obvious deficiencies, but when they look up towards higher level languages they don't see the advantages and just think "huh, that's strange". For example, a Python dev would look at C and think "Clearly it's missing a GC and classes" but then look at Haskell and think "What a strange language, why would I want Monads?". But similarly, a C dev would look at Python and think "Why would anyone want a GC"?
 This idea has stuck with me and I'd like to revisit the blog post I got it from, so any help or pointers to it would be appreciated!

To share what we learned we put together a high level guide that also has specifics on how we made our translation service more reliable.

My program is basically just FizzBuzz:
  
module Main whereimport Libmain :: IO ()main = print (fizzBuzz [1..100])
  
where "fizzBuzz" is defined in another file Lib.hs as:
  
fizzBuzz :: [Int] -> [String]fizzBuzz [] = []fizzBuzz (x:xs)| mod x 3 == 0 && mod x 5 == 0 = "FizzBuzz":fizzBuzz xs| mod x 3 == 0 = "Fizz":fizzBuzz xs| mod x 5 == 0 = "Buzz":fizzBuzz xs| otherwise = show x:fizzBuzz xs
  
I'm pretty new to this but I tested out the program in an online compiler and it worked there so I don't think it's a problem with the program itself.
 EDIT: After trying "stack run" a few more times the line "module Main where" now gives the error

 (use -v for more information). 
 Please ensure that ghcide is compiled with the same GHC installation as the project.cradle
  
EDIT 2: Running "stack -v" in the project's folder gives out an error "Missing: COMMAND|FILE"

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sorry if the title didn't make any sense.
 I am tasked with migrating data from database A to database B continuously.
 Database A will be pushing notifications saying "row ${id} in table ${tableName} has been updated" or, "new row ${id} created in table ${tableName}".
 My job is to fetch this new/updated row, and create/update this same row in Database B.
 The problem: whenever I need to fetch something from database A, I need to know its schema (unless there's an equivalent to Any in Haskell?).
 I have about 400 tables, each with their own columns and datatypes... writing those 400 tables manually would be madness.
 
 My idea is to, at the start of the application, ask database A for all its tables and their columns. 
 So I might get hundreds of something like this:
 sql TABLE table1 ( name VARCHAR(256) NOT NULL, age INT NOT NULL )  (parsing the SQL syntax isn't a problem)
 which I want to convert to something like:
  data Table1 = Table1 { name :: String , age :: Int } 
 Then, somehow, when I get a notification like:
 "new row ${id} created in table ${table1}",
 I need to link this table1 to the Table1 type, so I can parse it correctly when I fetch one of its rows.
 Is this a very stupid idea? Should I even bother type-checking this?
 Thanks.

 Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhuHCtR3xq8
 Which made me come back to Haskell and try out what Brian did explain.
 I managed to reproduce the shoving/binding of a -> Ma functions. My test code lives here: https://github.com/xddq/why-monads-make-lives-easier/blob/main/Test.hs
 In the video he explains that M can be any monad, and does not have to be a specific one.
 I did not get this to work. Where should I look to get this working? How would this code look like for these example functions:
 ```
 numToMonad :: a -> [a] numToMonad x = [a]
 numToMonad2 :: a -> Maybe a numToMonad2 x | even x = Just x | otherwise = Nothing
 shoveIt :: a -> Maybe a shoveIt x = numToMonad x >>= numToMonad2
 ```
 Did I misunderstand the video? Is this not possible?
 Thank you in advanvce!

 I use org-roam and the one thing that I really like but struggle to use on my low-spec linux machine is org-roam-ui. It really uses up a lot of memory (although I'm told switching to a chromium based browser might help performance) and is pretty laggy.
 I do have an iPad however, and it would be absolutely perfect if I could use org-roam-ui on it. I tried to do the next best thing and used Logseq, and I do get a nice graph, but the nodes include random bits of org headers and markdown, and don't take me to the appropriate note when I tap on them.
 Has anyone managed to setup up org-roam-ui or equivalent on their iPad, using Logseq or otherwise?

 >λ fac 5 120 
 This is a bit like when Wolfgang Pauli was asked what the most amazing thing he'd ever encountered in physics was. He said "A thermos! I put something cold in, and it keeps it cold. I put something hot in and it keeps it hot. How does it know what to do?!" How does fac know what to do?

 I have been studing haskell for some 2 years now, to the point where I can write leetcode decently (the thing I am learning right now, understand but not fully yet are monad transformers)
 I have looked into ihp and yesod, ran some small amount of code in them, but both seem to have a lot of framework specific knowledge needed, and "reinvent the wheel" to an extent.
 I am wondering if there is a "flask for haskell", a very simple web framework that you can learn very little about and start coding. That is, write html rather than some haskell variation, write SQL rather than some haskell variation, and just need to learn a couple of simple functions. 
 I would not mind if the framework included its own type-safe versions of SQL and HTML for latter. Actually I'd appreciate that, so that I could grow into the framework (is this the case for yesod? I used the yesod book, and it went to its custom versions of html and such straight away, but maybe I can "turn those on" as I go?). 
 But to begin, I'd like the "most straighforward to a person who knows a bit of haskell and vanilla backend programming".
 Thanks!

 A coworker noted that they enjoy this feature in vscode, and I can understand the advantages it provides over scrolling the *compile* buffer and looking for errors.
 Test Explorer UI provides a user interface for visualizing the state and running unit tests.
 So far nothing popups on the web, something like this probably don't exist?

 ​
 The languages I use are the following:
  
C 
Java
 Python
 Haskell
 Elisp (duh)
  
For each of these I'd like to have some basic but essential features:
  
Syntax highlighting
 Code completion
 Folding
 Interactively compile and run from an emacs buffer
 Everything else one should except from a decent editor
  
​
 The problem is that there are so many modes that I really do not know which one to use. Also, there are LSPs which i did not really understand quite well what they are and how they differentiate from common modes. Does someone have any advice or easy to read config file to share me?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey fellow Zettlers! (This is a crossposting from r/antinet since I am into building a paperbased ZK/AntiNet since 6 weeks as an addition to my digital workhorse).
If it is OK with you, I would like to hear your opinions or get some more ideas:
My daughter is really fascinated by my work with the paper-based Zettelkasten. Which is a no-brainer since she can't watch me working with the digital one.
So I thought it might be a good idea to start one with her as well when she begins elementary school this summer.
What I talked about with her is:
She gets her own AntiNet-Box - we start with just one in A7 (5 1/8 x 7)


Everyday when she comes from school and learned something really interesting or has a question that fascinates her, we write that down, do research, write Bib-Cards and permanent notes of what she wants to keep.


In the evening we show us our cards that we produced that day and install the in our boxes.



The main idea is to get her interested in capturing her knowledge and what she learned, make it tangible and usable for her.
So that is roughly the idea.
Here are some questions for you:
What ideas come to mind when you think about an AntiNet for Kids?
What would you put in there?
How would you categorize it? (Scott’s System might be a bit too complicated for a kid )
What system to link the cards would be helpful?
I have no idea if that works longterm but it might be worth a try.  If she keeps to it and builds up her personal knowledge box piece by piece and Zettel by Zettel that could be really valuable some day.
The project should not just be a collection of Flashcards or learning cards but should teach her the philosophy of building her very own thinking and knowledge tool.
What do you think?]]></summary>

 Here's my config:
 (setq org-directory "~/orgfiles") (setq org-capture-templates `(("t" "Tasks / Projects") ("tt" "Task" entry (file+olp "myorg.org" "Inbox") "* TODO %?\n %U\n %a\n %i" :empty-lines 1) ("j" "Journal Entries") ("jj" "Journal" entry (file+olp+datetree "Journal.org.gpg") "\n* %<%I:%M %p> - Journal :journal:\n\n%?\n\n" :clock-in :clock-resume :empty-lines 1) ("jm" "Meeting" entry (file+olp+datetree "Journal.org.gpg") "* %<%I:%M %p> - %a :meetings:\n\n%?\n\n" :clock-in :clock-resume :empty-lines 1) ("o" "Office") ("oo" "Task" entry (file+olp "work_diary.org" "Inbox") "* TODO %?\n %U\n %a\n %i" :empty-lines 1) ("oj" "Journal" entry (file+olp+datetree "Work-Journal.org.gpg") "\n* %<%I:%M %p> - Journal :journal:\n\n%?\n\n" :clock-in :clock-resume :empty-lines 1))) 
 When I call any of the capture keybindings, it shows a buffer with the capture template and simultaneously prompts in the minibuffer the file selection option with "File to save in:". This has never happened before. 
 I have not modified my capture templates since I set them up an year ago. What is going wrong?

 I study physics and take a fair amount of various notes, but after discovering Org-roam and the Zettelkasten method, I have been thinking that my workflow is very rigid and just sub-par in general. Some of my "strategies" of how I approach note-taking might sound obviously flawed so any hints on that front are very welcome.
 I have been using AUCTeX to write up my notes in LaTeX for some time now. My workflow generally consists of reading various textbooks (and research papers) and creating a LaTeX "project" (a modular document) for each textbook, which sounds kind of awful, I know. But this way I can take notes on said…]]></summary>

If everything could be done in one sitting, that would be fine and my weekly report would write itself. Often, however, TODO items get worked on over a number of days and that breaks things. The fundamental problem is that an Org mode TODO needs to live in one and only one place, whereas the various work sessions comprising that TODO need to appear in several different places.

 Question: This blog post (https://www.haskellforall.com/2022/05/why-does-haskells-take-function-accept.html) from haskellforall is talking about how the take function can work even when there's not enough elements in the list to select.
 Here's my implementation:
 take' :: Int -> [el] -> [el]
 take' n [] = []
 take' n (x : xs) = x : [v | (k, v) <- zip [1 ..] xs, k <= n - 1]

 This seems pretty lazy and appear to be working correctly. Can anyone explain to me if I am missing anything?

Of course, my first attempt was unsuccessful, since org mode was not able to find the cls file (after using `#+LATEX_CLASS: customcls) , despite having the file in the same directory. After reading the docs and https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/uomvik/org_mode_to_latex_using_a_cls_file/ , I realized that I could just configure org mode to find the cls file by creating a new entry in my emacs config and copying the cls file inside the emacs config dir. 
 But I do not want to pollute my config with this. This is a single time to use this for a single conference. 
 Is it possible to configure the org file to evaluate some lisp code to add the custom cls to the org-latex-class list and set its path? I tried with no success using a * COMMENT section and so on. For now, I am just using latex directly.
 Thanks for any advice.

I wrote a little about it here: True Emacs Transparency. To my knowledge, this originated from a patch by Håkon Flatval in November of last year.
 The old alpha frame parameter, which many of you are aware of, sets the transparency of both the text and background (i.e. the entire frame). This new frame parameter makes just the background of the frame transparent. I haven't seen anything on this subreddit about it, so I thought I'd make a post. Cheers!

 data Colour = White | Black deriving(Enum)
 data ExtraState = ExtraState
 data Game = Game { white :: ExtraState , black :: ExtraState }
 getState :: Game -> Colour -> ExtraState getState g White = white g getState g Black = black g ```
 where each value of Colour has an associated ExtraState in the record. So basically a total map from Colour to ExtraState.
 Sorry, maybe this would be a better one for Stack Overflow :p

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Is there an Org-standard way to control startup visbility on lists (or parts of lists)?
 One can define the #+STARTUP keyword (in the metadata block of a document) or the VISIBILITY property under a heading in order to configure startup visibility.
 As one can cycle trough folded -> children -> subtree states on lists just like one can with headings, I've been hoping that there may be a way to configure startup visibility not just for headings but also for list (or sublists) but can't spot in the docs how to label a particular list node/branch to assume a specific visibility upon startup.
 It seems that subtree is not a valid option for either the #+STARTUP keyword or the VISIBILITY property, so I'm guessing I may be out of luck here.
 Perhaps it doesn't exist but I just wanted to be sure that I'm not just running into a "subpar websearching skills" wall here.

 I've been using emacs for months now and I still don't have any external packages installed, primarily because what I do in emacs doesn't demand any external packages. I don't have much going on for me as a programmer or a person to need to install those packages.
 I'm just a high school sophomore that likes working on my own codebases and taking notes with org mode here and there, for my codebases I use rgrep for searching terms, hs-minor-mode for code block visibility, and M-/ for term completion, these are of course all built-in features and I consider them sufficient.
 Even if I did reach a point where I did need to use external extensibility, my first resort wouldn't be using an external package, I'd honestly rather write the extens…]]></summary>

The one thing that gets me is that I'm not clear how to keep the remote IMAP server up to date. I have mu4e-get-mail-command set to "mbsync -a", and I know mu4e-update-interval can be used to run that command every so often, but as I understand it, if I make a change like deleting a message and then quit Emacs before the next update interval, the server won't see that change until I'm running mu4e again. I think what's needed is a way to trigger mbsync after every change, or every batch of changes, rather than after a set time. What's a good way to do this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I quite like org-contacts for use with gnus. One problem I always had was that to use the mail to groups functionality (where everyone with a particular tag, e.g. :family: in my contacts.org file would get added to an email "to" line) I had to disable helm-mode type "+fam" and <tab>, and then, if I remembered, re-enable helm-mode. I didn't have to do this a lot, but it was nice when I needed it. Now with the org-contacts from 6 June 2022 this no longer works. I get an error message because instead of a string of names and emails I am getting a function. For example, #("Father <fatherMadeUpAddress@family.ca>, Mother <motherMadeUpAddress@family.ca" 0 9 (face org-level-1 fontified t) 31 48 (face org-level-1 fontified t)) 
 The names and addresses are in there if I could just get them out of that function. I think there is a message-tab-function I could use. Any suggestions from people who have already solved this issue, or would like to give me suggestions for how I might try? If people want to lobby for alternatives to org-contacts I am open to suggestions. Thanks.

I am a german actuary in his early forties with a doctorate in (pure) mathematics.
I like to read and think about what I read. I want to learn the Zettelkasten Method to help me with that, to curate lines of thought in my (many) areas of interest, make new connections, and see what comes up over time. If something worthwhile does come up, I would also like to dabble a bit in non-fiction writing.
My start-up setting for the Zettelkasten:
Fleeting Notes are handwritten (either in my notebook or blank slips of paper that double as bookmarks).
Zotero as a reference system and storage for finalized proper literature notes.
Obsidian as a Zettelkasten (but still using the 'Folgezettel'-system).
In addition, I mark the number of the permanent notes in my Zettelkasten each day, together with the hours I worked with the Zettelkaste Method (aiming for at least three).
Looking forward to learning from/with you!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I jump around projects using projectile. This is nice to jump around but it doesnt preserve splits layout. Say I have 2 projects: A and B. For A, I do a 3 way splits: 2 for source codes and 1 for compilation window. For B, I have a vertical split with a text file on the left, and a PDF on the right. How do I move back and forth between A and B, and not messing up the layout? Projectile as I said, works fine but then I need to resplit the windows to my taste.
 I have tried "desktop.el". So you save to a .desktop file, but the downsides are: you need to remember to change to the "desktop-dir" to have the layouts loaded, and it doesnt keep the positions in a PDF file.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I work for a Scala company and, although my job does not require it, I want to learn it, so I can dive into the codebase.
 When I asked the dev team, there was no consensus about using Scala 2 or 3, but I'm inclined to do 3 (our codebase is 2).
 I am OK using Emacs but is IntelliJ still the suggested option? How does it work with Scala 3? I want to focus on the language, not the tooling, if possible.

 I installed ivy and even with that, I have to first navigate to the correct folder and then open the file which is annoying.

 Can anyone please share an Emacs config for JS development that actually works for private methods that are prepended with '#' pound sign?

Continuing to focus on my reading and the "Depth of Processing" of my notes using "Elaborative Interrogation and Self-explanation."
I'm working to make sense of two diverse ideas.
The Science of Setting & Achieving Goals - Huberman Lab
I'm onboarding ideas from Four thousand weeks: time management for mortals by Burkeman, Oliver, 2021. This book is brim-full of ideas about finitude and its relationship to wonderment.


Reading Longitude: the true story of a lone genius who solved the most significant scientific problem of his time by Sobel, Dava, and Armstrong, Neil, 2007. A gripping story of the discovery and development of the tool that leads to safe ocean navigation. Interesting to see Issac Newton's role in this when he was 80 years old.

Reading The Eighty-Five Percent Rule for optimal learning by Robert C. Wilson, Amitai Shenhav, Mark Straccia & Jonathan D. Cohen as an in-depth followup to The Science of Setting & Achieving Goals
Trivia.
These are the titles of a few recent notes I'm excited about.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone ! 
 I am using doom emacs with lsp and pyright for my python projects and everything works quite well. Yesterday however, I noticed that when lsp started with pyright without any internet connection, pyright would simply refuse to start. When checking the pyright::stderr buffer, I got the following : 
 npm ERR! code EAI_AGAIN npm ERR! errno EAI_AGAIN npm ERR! request to https://registry.npmjs.org/pyright failed, reason: getaddrinfo EAI_AGAIN registry.npmjs.org npm ERR! A complete log of this run can be found in: npm ERR! /home/gautier/.npm/_logs/2022-06-05T09_55_34_647Z-debug.log Traceback (most recent call last): File "/home/gautier/.pyenv/versions/venv/bin/pyright-langserver", line 8, in <module> sys.exit(entrypoint()) File "/home/gautier/.pyenv/versions/venv/lib64/python3.9/site-packages/pyright/langserver.py", line 57, in entrypoint sys.exit(main(*sys.argv[1:])) File "/home/gautier/.pyenv/versions/venv/lib64/python3.9/site-packages/pyright/langserver.py", line 26, in main return run(*args, **kwargs).returncode File "/home/gautier/.pyenv/versions/venv/lib64/python3.9/site-packages/pyright/langserver.py", line 37, in run version = node.latest('pyright') File "/home/gautier/.pyenv/versions/venv/lib64/python3.9/site-packages/pyright/node.py", line 145, in latest raise errors.VersionCheckFailed( pyright.errors.VersionCheckFailed: Version check for pyright failed, see output above. Process pyright stderr finished npm ERR! code EAI_AGAIN npm ERR! errno EAI_AGAIN npm ERR! request to https://registry.npmjs.org/pyright failed, reason: getaddrinfo EAI_AGAIN registry.npmjs.org 
 From what I understand, npm is trying to check the version of pyright but since I don't have an internet connection, it simply fails. Is there a way to skip this verification step and start pyright anyway ? 
 I must admit that I still don't fully understand how lsp works so there might be something simple that I'm missing here. 
 Thanks in advance =)

 org-superstar-mode installed easily because I can enable it when I'm in an org file. What syntax would I add to my init file to start org-superstar-mode on every new file?
 I thought it would be something like:
 ~~~ (require 'org-superstar) (add-hook 'org-mode-hook (lambda () (org-superstar-mode 1))) ~~~
 I feel so stupid for not being able to figure this out, but I know I'm missing something super obvious here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am using a custom function meant to take an entry in a .org document, and put it into a node, either a new one, or one that already existed. Org-roam-refile does not work if the node you want to put the text in doesn't already exist, and org-roam-extract-subtree doesn't work if you want to put the text into a pre-existing node. 
 Heavily inspired by system-crafters, what I settled on doing was initiating the org-roam-capture process to guarantee that there's a node, then using org-refile to move the entry to the target document. It looks roughly like this. 
 (defun my/org-roam-gtd-reference () (interactive) (let ( (org-refile-keep nil) ;; Set this to nil to delete the original! (org-roam-capture-templates '(("k" "knowledge" plain "%?" :if-new (file+head+olp "pages/${slug}.org" "#+title: ${title}\n" ("Knowledge"))))) (org-after-refile-insert-hook #'save-buffer) nodefile position ) (save-window-excursion (org-roam-capture "k") (setq nodefile (buffer-file-name)) (setq position (point))) (org-refile nil nil (list "Knowledge" nodefile nil position))) (org-gtd-process-inbox)) 
 The problem in this function seems to be in the 
  (save-window-excursion (org-roam-capture "k") (setq nodefile (buffer-file-name)) (setq position (point))) 
 I cannot for the life of me figure this out. But buffer-file-name is returning nil, which causes nodefile to be defined as nil, which causes the eventual org-refile command to fail. Strangely, this block works fine if it uses the org-roam-dailies-capture-today command instead of org-roam-capture. Unfortunately, that wouldn't fit my workflow, since it would capture to dailies instead of the actual nodes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to achieve something like track-eol:
  
When line-move-visual is nil, you can also set the variable track-eol to a non-nil value. Then C-n and C-p, when starting at the end of the logical line, move to the end of the next logical line. Normally, track-eol is nil.
  
but with two differences:
  
it should be activated after a C-e (easy, just advise move-end-of-line), and automatically disabled after any horizontal motion (I could advise every horizontal movement command, but is there a better way?). Essentially, if I move to the end of line with C-f I don't want track-eol-like behaviour.
 
it should work with line-move-visual set, which probably means using goal-column. I tried setting temporary-goal-column after C-e, but it gets ignored if the last command isn't one of an handful (move-end-of-line not included). This is unfortunate since I think temporary-goal-column has pretty much the behaviour I want.
 
 How would you do this?
 EDIT: I ended up with this
 (defvar ad/sticky-eol-active nil) (defun ad/sticky-eol () (if (and ad/sticky-eol-active (memq this-command '(previous-line next-line boon-repeat-command))) (end-of-line) (setq ad/sticky-eol-active (eq this-command 'end-of-line)))) (add-hook 'post-command-hook #'ad/sticky-eol)

 I've taken a look at vim and emacs, but I'm not sure if it's quite worth the swap.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 I'm using org-cite with the CSL backend to export to LaTeX to HTML, it works well. The only thing is, I'd like the bibliography name in the export to depend on the language.
 In pure LaTeX, you can just use \printbibliography[title={MyTitle}] and on export, the name of the
 section will be 
 MyTitle
 <bibliography here> 
 But if you don't add any title argument, it'll be smart enough to call it References in English and Bibliographie in French for example. 
 Can I do something similar with the CSL backend? Thanks.

 ​
 So far I have macros docs (2.11?) and scalamacrology workshop (from 2014). It is not clear to me how much has changed from these sources until now. Any recommendations on if what I have shared is "close enough", or of more recent documentation/resources?

 Haskell is an exceptional language that made this project very effective and helped us move really fast, so I hope some day SimpleX might help Haskell popularity too!
 Thank you all for your support 🙏

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A few years ago I discovered Rust and I wanted to learn it. But I struggled until I learned that Rust is highly influenced by functional programing languages.
 I became curious about FP, but I struggled again. This time I struggled to find a good language. My first choice was Elm, but it is limited to the browser and needs things like nodejs and maybe even interop with JavaScript (I don't like JS).
 Another option was F#, but the compiler is horribly slow (I explain it in a moment).
 Also an option was Gleam, but this lacks good documentation and I wasn't able to install the compiler.
 I decided to reactivate my old Samsung N150 Netbook from 2010 and installed Endeavour OS (based on Arch Linux) with i3 as window manager. I like to minimize myself sometimes and nothing is better to use a computer that isn't able to play YouTube videos. Using a browser is possible, but not fun. This is one of the reasons I don't choose Elm.
 I also installed the .NET Toolchain, but the compiler is horribly slow on the N150 and the editor of choice, helix, has no support for F#, so I decided to ditch this too.
 Other languages on my list are Python and Julia, but they are not really helpful to learn FP.
 Finally I tried Haskell. Helix has good support, the LSP works well and the Compiler has an acceptable oerformance. Haskell is a general purpose language, pure functional, well documented and mature. Also I have a few ebooks about Haskell I can read on the N150 without the need for a browser. I don't even need internet connection, except I need to install something.
 So this is it, a short story of a long journey. Finally I'm going to learn Haskell. Or is it?
 No, maybe I come back to Elm and F# later, but now I will focus on THE pure functional language, Haskell.

 I’m completely unfamiliar to setting up environments or configurations (aside from copy pasting templates from friends). Looking for help. I have used vim before and I really love the keyboard macros (since I’ll be doing a bit of metaprogramming, and in-line assembly too in Julia, such features will be very handy).
 (Why don’t I want to use another OS? Handwritten Note taking using stylus is a big part of my workflow and I’ve found windows machines to work best for it. Not a simple task to install BSD or Linux on surface devices. Also quite a lot of windows exclusive software for my use case)
 Also, is it possible to have eMacs display the custom variable names (like smileys, and latex symbols) available in Julia?
 I’m currently using this tutorial but even that is quite inconsistent : https://youtu.be/Iagbv974GlQ (the first step at 3.49 throws a warning on my pc, stating unnecessary call to package initialize at unit. Also at 3.35, how did he clear off the entire text quickly?)
 Apart from using for Coding for Julia programs, I am also curious about learning org mode in eMacs. (I do make slides every week and I feel that org mode will help me make it more streamlined)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi! I'm a beginner in Haskell. My understanding may be wrong, but I often hear the word "effect" being used in seemingly arbitrary contexts.
 I've always thought that it actually means "side effect" (IO), but apparently people call all sorts of things "effectful", including simple wrappers like Maybe and Either.
 This leads me to a couple of questions:
  
Is this use of the words "effect" and "effectful" correct? Do they simply mean "a wrapper type", or is it more specific than that?
 What are the origins of it being used this way?
  
Thanks!

 Caps + a even requires you to totally change hand position from the home row.
 The most common C-c, C-v we use in other programs become messy with using Caps.
 I personally bound my right alt to caps which I use most often. When I have to control plus keys on right hand side, I press left control with edge of my palm. This is also not that good but seems better than Caps lock.
 Dunno why the control keys are placed so badly on keyboards when they are the ones used to make keyboard shortcuts for almost every program.

 It appears the debugger works once, and then can never be shut off even after running geben-end as indicated in this github issue. I am able to stop my code once, but I don't see any indicators in emacs itself that a breakpoint was actually hit. I just know the code is stalled where I had set the breakpoint. If I try running the code again, I get a "connection refused, already debugging" which shouldn't be happening after running geben-end

 Has anyone actually gotten this working?

The previous implementation (Task) worked perfectly well, but hadn't kept up with developments in modern effect types.
 Tyrian is still following what I think of as the 'friendly-FP' approach you get with the Elm architecture. I promise that you do not need to be a Cats / Cats Effect guru to use this. 😅

 One annoyance though is giving up C-r for pasting from registers. I have to learn how to use emacs based registers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi Haskellers,
 I'm John, a 28 year old man on disability for mental illness and cognitive issues likely caused by said mental illness. I have almost two years of work experience as a backend programmer for Amazon working on Java code, but I was pretty bad at it. I was never able to learn that codebase that I worked on (for every task I needed to ask a more experienced engineer to point me to where in the codebase the particular code change needed to be made). I'm hoping that I will have a little bit of an easier time learning a Haskell codebase once I master the programming language (but I will definitely need to set up and use a debugger to learn said codebase because just reading code without running it line-by-line doesn't do anything for me). Haskell isn't too difficult for me because I programmed in Scala in my spare time for a couple years, so I'm familiar with the basic functional programming concepts like Monads and such. Sometimes I get confused when people go too deep into category theory and functional programming (like I don't know what is a Kleisli or a Bimonad). My biggest hurdle is just getting to the point where I am independent and useful, so I could use a mentor. Please comment or message me if you know of a codebase I should work on and would be willing to mentor me.

 It looks like OAuth support is being deprecated by Google -- see this email I got from a month ago:
  
We are writing to inform you that OAuth out-of-band (OOB) flow will be deprecated on October 3, 2022, to protect users from phishing and app impersonation attacks.
 What do I need to know?
 Starting October 3, 2022, we will block OOB requests to Google's OAuth 2.0 authorization endpoint for existing clients. Apps using OOB in testing mode will not be affected. However, we strongly recommend you to migrate them to safer methods as these apps will be immediately blocked when switching to in production status.
 Note: New OOB usage has already been disallowed since February 28, 2022. 
 Below are key dates for compliance

 non-compliant OAuth requests October 3, 2022: The OOB flow is blocked for all clients and users will see
 the error page.
  
In fact, I've been getting an error saying OAuth token expired. Now trying to refresh-token. Received HTTP 401 for a couple of months now, so this tracks.
 Is there anything to be done at this point? org-gcal still works for me at the moment, but I'm guessing it won't come October. The maintainer's github page (at least that's who I think is the maintainer) doesn't mention this issue at the moment though.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So this summer I'll be working as part of a Tweag fellowship (https://www.tweag.io/blog/2020-02-14-os-fellowship/) on extending the Bayesian inference and probabilistic programming library monad-bayes (https://github.com/tweag/monad-bayes). It's a super nice library, and my goal is to make it much more user friendly (see these draft docs for example: https://monad-bayes.netlify.app/).
 One thing that would help is if people have statistical problems (or problems involving probability and inference in general) that they would like to see implemented in Haskell, they could mention them either here or in the issues (https://github.com/tweag/monad-bayes/issues) and I'll try to implement them in monad-bayes (or advise on how to do it). That would help me work out what the pain points are in using monad-bayes for "real-world" problems.
 In fact, any suggestions on things you'd like to see in the library are welcome :)

 (defun setup-flycheck-php-project-path ()

 flycheck-phpcs-standard (concat (projectile-project-root) "sniffs.xml"))))

 but there's still a problem after executing this as the sniffs.xml file points to other files from the project root and setting the project paths like above seems to still break it. 
 Anyone got around this sort of thing before?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have many case classes with a very-very similar structure in their companion object.
 For example:
 ```scala final case class User(name: String, email: String)
 object User: // everything below is a boilerplate opaque type Id = String
 object Id: given Encoder[Id] = deriveEncoder[Id]
 final case class WithId(id: Id, origin: User)
 object WithId: given Encoder[WithId] = deriveEncoder[WithId] ```
 What I'd like to write is:
 ```scala final case class User(name: String, email: String)
 object User: generateBoilerplate[User] ```
 And have generateBoilerplate generating all the entities.
 I think it should be possible with new macros, but I've never worked with them in Scala 2 and don't even know where to start. Does anyone have any examples or tips on where I should start exploring it?
 I tried to write something, but got stuck when realised that all examples I've show how to create a value, e.g.:
 scala val someValue = generateBoilerplate[User] 
 But don't see anything that would just "unwrap" traits/objects/values within some scope.

 this is what i'm using:

 i've also tried putting this inside use-package after :config, using :bind in use-package and removing the kbd macro, but nothing works and i get the same error.
 i've even tried changing the evil-maps.el file.
 i have been able to bind other key sequences to evil-change and i've also been able to bind 'a' to other commands but not evil-change.
 this however does work:
 (define-key evil-visual-state-map (kbd "a") 'evil-change)
 any ideas?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I'm wondering about two unrelated things. I'm not very close to Scala since the split between 2 and 3, so I'm sorry if those are some standard questions that everyone asks, but I wasn't able to find any meaningful answers for them.
  
Are there any plans for introducing nullable types in Scala3? I mean e.g.
  
 val s: String = null 
 This should not compile (with Nullable Types). I saw some forks of dotty that introduce this feature, but is there some kind of official statement of the devs about it? I'm sure someone has already talked about this stuff, as it's very popular today.
  
As for Scala3 syntax, I know that when it has been introduced the blog posts were stating that nobody will force the new syntax on anyone. Has this changed? Some time has passed after introducing the new syntax, is it possible to state which one is more popular today for Scala3 code? Will "old" syntax be deprecated one day?
  
Thanks for any answers.

 I found myself needing/having to use windows (not very happy about it).
 I have parsed this Reddit, the google, the stack... and haven't found a solution to my 2 issues.
  
I cannot edit/add commit messages:
 1 git.exe … "commit" "--"
 Aborting commit due to empty commit message.
 sh -c 'printf /nWITH-EDITOR:: $$: No such file or directory
 
I can neither pull nor push to my repo using ssh
 128 git.exe … push -v gitlab refs/heads/main:refs/heads/main
 Pushing to gitlab.com:aimebertrand/dotemacs.git
 fatal: Could not read from remote repository.
 Please make sure you have the correct access rights and the repository exists.
 
 I understand that this is going on almost nothing, when meta info is concerned, so here there are:
  
Shell
 (customize-set-variable 'shell-file-name "C:/Windows/system32/bash.exe")
 (customize-set-variable 'sh-shell-file "C:/Windows/system32/bash.exe")
 (setenv "ESHELL" "bash")
 
I got git-bash installed and have my ssh-keypair in my user directory and for good mesures also in .ssh directory inside of my default-directory
 
 I am quite ambitious, but some intricacies go over my head aspecially when it comes to windows.
 Hope someone can point me in the right direction. Maybe with their own config or so.
 I do apologize if this question is not the best formed. But maybe with some of your input I can add needed Info.

TL;DR: create your project with stack new myproject github:tweag/nix-integration.

Stack
Stack is one of the two popular build tools for Haskell projects.
It takes care of setting up a build environment by providing the GHC compiler and works hand-in-hand with Stackage snapshots: a specific version of GHC paired with a subset of packages from Hackage, where each package’s version was chosen to make the set self-consistent, relieving developers of the need of finding compatible Haskell package versions.
This post is about Stack as this is our main Haskell build tool at Tweag. Without entering into an emacs-vs-vi kind of debate, a similar post could be writt…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi there!
Not so long ago, I found the book "Taking Smart Notes with DevonThink" on the website of Kourosh Dini. I haven't been able to explore it completely because I'm currently processing Effective Notetaking. However, I have started to use daily DevonThink to take notes of the PDFs I read for my dissertation, and I love how you can create links even to a particular section of a PDF inside your note.
I will definitely read the book in a couple of months because I am already connecting my notes with PDFs and other notes in my database.
What I also like, and this isn't related to the book, is that I have finally settled in my search for a tool to keep my notes, research, sources and moreover make my zettelkasten.
So, if you already have DevonThink you might want to check it out, as I said, I haven't read it, but I have started to connect my thoughts from the sources I extract the information, and also to other notes. The iconography of the software is really helpful to know where the connections are going.
Cheers!]]></summary>

 This is definitely a rookie question - but I use hs-minor-mode for folding and my preference is to auto-fold by default when visiting a file so I've got this in my init.el
  (add-hook 'prog-mode-hook (lambda () (hs-minor-mode) (hs-hide-all))) 
 Worked fine - open a file and everything folds.
 I'm switching from lsp-mode to eglot and when use eglot-format or go-mode to format the buffer instead of lsp-format-buffer it seems to re-trigger this hook and fold everything down for me. This didn't happen with lsp-format-buffer
 Is prog-mode-hook not the best place to do this?

 I'm often writing functions that do repeated pattern matches on some relatively unique nesting of structures, and it doesn't feel like the pattern synonyms for this belong at the top-level, where they'd just be confusing.
 There's probably some technical reason that ghc needs them at the top level, and I assume it would be huge hassle to support them within other bindings, but if it was a simple thing... well, maybe I should make a PR to ghc!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello. Recently, I updated my GNU emacs from v26.3 to v27.2. Now, ispell does not work anymore under Windows 10 (on my Macs, it still works). On my Windows machine, I use hunspell, which has been the same v1.7.0. I am wondering what should be changed in my setup ~/.emacs.d/init.el for the ispell in v27.2 to work. Just as an experiment, if I replace /usr/share/emacs/27.2/lisp/textmodes/ispell.[el,elc] by those of 26.3, the ispell system works under v27.2. That means that some setting in the new ispell.el has changed. My current setup in ~/.emacs.d/init.el is the following, which I copied from the posting Tutorial: spellchecking with hunspell (1.7.0) for emacs (26.2) on Windows (10) : emacs (reddit.com)
 (autoload 'ispell-message "ispell" "Check spelling of mail message or news post.") (setq ispell-program-name "hunspell") (setq ispell-library-directory "C:/ProgramData/dict-en") (setq ispell-hunspell-dict-paths-alist '(("en_US" "C:/ProgramData/dict-en/en_US.aff"))) (setq ispell-local-dictionary "en_US") (setq ispell-local-dictionary-alist ;; Please note the list `("-d" "en_US")` contains ACTUAL parameters passed to hunspell ;; You could use `("-d" "en_US,en_US-med")` to check with multiple dictionaries '(("en_US" "[[:alpha:]]" "[^[:alpha:]]" "[']" nil ("-d" "en_US") nil utf-8))) ;; the following line won't make flyspell-mode enabled by default as you might think (setq ispell-personal-dictionary "C:/Users/me/.hunspell_en_US") (flyspell-mode 1) ;; ispell-word for showing correcting options of the current misspelled word ;(global-set-key (kbd "M-\\") 'ispell-word 
 If I use the ispell.el of v27.2, I got the error message: ispell: Can’t find Hunspell dictionary with a .aff affix file
 Thanks a lot for your help!

I am currently evaluating The Archive after years of managing all my notes in a folder full of markdown files which I editu using BBEdit. After just a little light search and replace in that fine app, I was able to get all my notes into The Archive with some hashtags already applied, etc.
I like the simplicity and responsiveness of this app, but right now I have one UI issue about how the Omnibar works. In the screen grab below, I entered the word "Vacation" into the Omnibar, and as you can see I got five hits, and I have selected the second one.

My issue in this screen shot is that it is impossible to tell what the original search term was, as the Omnibar is filled in with the name of the note. I think it would be clearer if the omnibar still read "vacation," although that goes against the grain of the Notational Velocity way I guess... not that I remember how any other NV type app has solved this issue.
What do you think? Should I just get used to it?]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I want to give DIY-Emacs a shot and compiled the binary on my Xubuntu LTS according to that:
 git clone git://git.sv.gnu.org/emacs.git sudo apt install build-essential libgtk-3-dev libgnutls28-dev libtiff5-dev libgif-dev libjpeg-dev libpng-dev libxpm-dev libncurses-dev texinfo cd emacs ./autogen.sh ./configure --with-pgtk make -j8 
 Before I do sudo make install I need to get rid of the Debian packages that get replaced.
 sudo dpkg --get-selections| grep -i emacs returns:
 emacs emacs-bin-common emacs-common emacs-el emacs-gtk emacsen-common 
 The first one is obvious: I need to do sudo apt remove emacs before the install commmand of my own version. But what about the rest? They also come with further dependencies such as libgit2-28 libhttp-parser2.9 libm17n-0 libotf0 m17n-db and even more on a different machine.
 What packages can be removed and what should (may) I keep?
 Is the self-compiled Emacs 100 percent self-contained so that I never need any additional library or package from my GNU/Linux distribution?
 Thanks!

I'm starting a new job, and I have to learn some new software. I want to put what I learn into my Archive.
I don't know why, but it feels awkward to me to go through the software's documentation and start writing notes about the different features. Intuitively it seems at odds with ZKM. But, I'm don't think it actually is.
But, is that how you'd do it also?
Start with a structure note, and start to branch off into these different features within the software, writing notes about the different features?
Thanks for you thoughts in advance!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I wrote commify several years ago, but have never done anything to announce it. Just did some minor tweaking, so I thought I would let reddit-ers know.
 It's a pretty simple package, but I use it all the time. It inserts grouping commas into a number near the cursor, or all numbers in a region. If invoked on a number that already has grouping commas, it removes them. So, it toggles the commas on and off. It tries to avoid things that you don't want commas on, such as dates, or numbers with leading, or identifiers. It can also work with hex, octal, and binary numbers, each with their own grouping character, normally, '_'.
 I have it bound to the keychord ',,' which makes it easy to invoke and remember.
 It's on MELPA, so give it a try.

To easily know which frame corresponds to which project, I changed the frame title as follows: "[project-name] current-buffer-name" by customizing the variable frame-title-format and setting frame-parameter (see https://gist.github.com/jackjackk/22fba0486c7ebc0a673cc3fb30fe2d24). After some recent Emacs update (or perhaps of my linux windows manager?), now when the frame title changes after a tab switch between frames, all frames get the same project name in the title (see for example https://snipboard.io/qLHIZW.jpg). Some months ago each frame retained the last assigned project name in the frame title. Any suggestions on what could have changed and how should I adjust my code? Thanks a lot!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I wonder how to make opening a tab in tab-line in the background robust.
 I figured out a way to make it work by caching the selected tab index. But I cannot make heads nor tails of the tab structs used in tab-line; there seems to be no unique ID per tab that would help to re-select a tab, just the tab struct itself?
 Anyway, here's a macro to "save tab excursion" when e.g. visiting a file. It only works with tabs opening to the right, so that's a limitation and possibly breaks expectations.
 (defmacro infu/save-tab-excursion (&rest body) "Opens a new tab in tab-line in the background and executes BODY inside, then restores the previously selected tab." `(let ((current-tab-index (tab-bar--current-tab-index))) (tab-bar-new-tab 1) ;; +1 = Create to the right so our cached index works. (unwind-protect (progn ,@body)) ;; For some reason tab indexes are 0-based but tab numbers are 1-based (tab-bar-select-tab (+ 1 current-tab-index)))) (infu/save-tab-excursion (find-file "test.txt")) 
 Ideas to make this better would be much appreciated!

Mousing around, clicking incessantly on links, constantly losing focus, and backtracking is so painful.
A structure note is far more than a list of other notes. It places ideas in a connecting context. The value of structure is enhanced with writing. Surround the ideas with context. A structure note is not atomic, growing, and growing as idea momentum grows.
In this short video, I demonstrate a "Two Window Workflow" with the structure note on the right. I click on the links in the structure note and the target note launch in the second window. I don't lose context as the structure note remains in view. I can review and refactor either note.
Notice that the structure note includes Grouped links and many of those links are annotated. The annotations are for context, which helps steer connectivity.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Over the years there's been several attempts to build systems providing templates for new Haskell projects: Stack has had templates for a long time, but as far as I can tell/remember, they're in a state of flux or were being deprecated in favour of something new; summoner(-tui) is excellent but doesn't seem to have been updated for a while and baulks at asking it to use newer GHCs. These are the only projects I've used, I'm probably missing many others.
 So what are the options these days? I don't tend to use stack any more as Cabal seems to offer most of the advantages it used to provide exclusively, and is more compatible.
 Off the top of my head, features I'd like to see are: either a way to add in "features" (choose a database library, web server/API library, custom prelude, etc.), or a rich ecosystem of common combinations of libraries, much like Stack does/used to.

 I love the language and it's expressivity, and I'm very glad i could learn it because it has taught me many things, some of which i don't know i would have had the chance to learn without the language and it's community.
 However it seems to me that the only way to get a scala job is to be first a senior developer, and i am far from one.
 So the only way i see this playing out is having to use Java for the next five years somewhere that uses Scala libraries, and then switch over.
 Is there really no other way? Why are there no Junior scala jobs?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone. 
 I have been using emacs for a while and only a couple of features from the jetbrains editor I miss: the Conflict Resolution tool, and the execution configurations. 
 These execution configurations usually specify which file to execute, with which virtual env, set environment variables and things like those. 
 I have tried to see if lsp mode or python mode offer something like that but it does not look like it, so I spent some time building some functions to achieve similar functionality making the assumption you use pyvenv:
 https://gist.github.com/andcarnivorous/9a9fad7a267cba8f7840f338ad76cbf5
 Still don't know if this is worth packaging on MELPA, but it sure has made my workflow more efficient. 
 If you know of any alternative already present in a major package please let me know :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm modelling a particular domain which has entities which can relate to each other:
 haskell type EID = Integer data Entity = Distribution EID | Organisation EID | Site EID 
 This is how I'd initially consider declaring them as a data type. There are some hierarchical relationships I can declare:
  
a distribution can own an organisation
 an organisation can own a site
 an organisation can own a distribution
  
(Sidenote: I don't want cycles in this graph, so an organisation cannot be a member of a distribution it owns. More strongly than that, in fact, organisations which own a distribution cannot be members of another distribution at all.)
 One way I could think of modelling these relations is with a simple function definition:
 haskell isMemberOf :: Entity -> Entity -> IO Bool isMemberOf (Distribution a) (Distribution b) = return False isMemberOf (Distribution a) (Organisation b) = -- do some lookup isMemberOf (Distribution a) (Site b) = return False isMemberOf (Organisation a) (Distribution b) = -- do some lookup isMemberOf (Organisation a) (Organisation b) = return False isMemberOf (Organisation a) (Site b) = return False isMemberOf (Site a) (Distribution b) = return False isMemberOf (Site a) (Organisation b) = -- do some lookup isMemberOf (Site a) (Site b) = return False 
 This could be made more concise, but I'm being very explicit for the sake of clarity.
 The problem with this approach is that it doesn't tell you what the possible relations are at type level and therefore at compile time. Instead, you'll find out you made a mistake when asking 
 (a :: Site) `isMemberOf` (b :: Site) 
 at runtime, because you'll get False (wrapped in IO).
 Is there a nicer way to model this sort of graph of related entities which have specific rules about what types of entities are allowed to relate and how?

 It seems that by default (lossage-size) returns 300 but I'm getting 150 lines max in the history shown by view-lossage, and for some reason it fluctuates with subsequent calls as well.
 With (lossage-size 1000) I get around 500 lines of history.
 Is there a logic to this that I am not getting?

 It is only when I close the opengl window that the compilation buffer is updated with the text which should have been printed before the window opened:

 Whenever I ran the executable in neovim's built in terminal it would always print out the text first and then open the window. It seems like the compilation buffer is not being updated until after the compilation is finished. Is there way for me to update the compilation buffer whilst it is still doing the compilation?

 Now counsel-fzf uses find-file in counsel-fzf-action to open a file in the currently open window, but I'd rather use find-file-other-window. - Here's the code snippet from counsel.el:
 (defun counsel-fzf-action (x) "Find file X in current fzf directory." (with-ivy-window (let ((default-directory counsel--fzf-dir)) (find-file x)))) 
 As you can see, it calls find-file. So how can I tell it to use find-file-other-window? - Now I could use an advice to overwrite this, but I am thinking that counsel has other mechanisms to accomplish this.

I was in similar yet different situation where I was able to use packages from the a local repo mirror and I was not allowed to install any external ones. That made me think about how I would setup and use Emacs in those environments. I separated out my config (which is a literate org file) into Vanilla Emacs Configs and External Configs. When ever I'm the afore-mentioned environments I started to comment out the ```External Configs``` heading. I've also been hacking on the vanilla configs and I was pleasantly surprised. I miss certain things like hydra, magit, yasnippet and avy but I was surprised by how far I could go with Emacs's built in functions and my Spaghettified lisp config. So I'm asking about your experiences in using vanilla emacs. If you have any tips and tricks or some forgotten built in packages I should give a try and so on.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey, I'm running Emacs 28.1 with org 9.5.2 (and citeproc 20220124.721). I'm mostly intersted in the case where the export backend is html, and, albeit, adding `#+print_bibliography:` works fine, it's a bit tedious to add at the bottom of each file with its own outline, etc...
 ​
 Is it possible to add an option, either to the whole html backend or just to a project, to automatically add a bibliography section at the bottom of each html file, without having to do what I've described above ?
