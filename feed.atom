 She just took a 21.2k hit to her savings from medical expenses, leaving her at under 9k. In addition to me loosing my part time job(broken arm) as I’m still a physics undergrad student.
 She has a background in mathematics and algebraic geometry, and is hugely talented; please if anyone can help.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Please forgive this brief bout of introspection.
 I noticed that after a full workday with emacs, I am not exhausted, whilst after a full workday with anything that makes me click or drag or use arrow keys, I am knackered. 
 I look forward to working in emacs. I dread and procrastinate working with other tools, no matter how good otherwise. E.g., Mathematica and IntelliJ products are great, but they wear me out.
 I chalk this up to "mental cache misses:"
 If I can leave my hands on the home row of an ANSI keyboard, everything stays "in-cache" and I get flow-go. If I must reach for a pointing device or arrow keys, I get a "muscle-memory cache miss." If I must take my eyes off the cursor to go hunting around menus or dialog boxes, I get "visual cache misses."
 I guess I learned 1-dimensional work habits from reading books. I don't do well with video learning. Scanning back and forth in a video to review info is like hunting around for menus and dialog boxes; it wears me out. I do better if I treat a video like an in-person lecture and take linear notes with pen and paper.

 First of all, here is my current setup: Emacs installed via snap using Doom Emacs, TexLab (installed via cargo), latex enabled in Doom emacs with +lsp and +latexmk. The LaTeX LSP is working fine, and when I compile a document that needs pdflatex, it works.
 When I compile a document that requires LuaLatex, it asks me if I want to use the LuaTex engine. And when I click yes, it says this: LaTeX: problems after [0] pages and does not compile at all. I am able to compile the document by compiling it in the terminal, so the document is not the problem.
 Any ideas on how to get this working? I am not able to use XeLatex either. The distro I am using is Pop!_OS 22.04. 
 EDIT: More details! I press M-x and run LaTex-command-selection. When I select LaTex option from the menu, I get asked if I want to use LuaTex, and when I press y I get the issue. The same thing when I select the LatexMk option. I have a .latexmkrc file in the project directory as well with the contents: $pdflatex = 'lualatex';
 Thanks for the help!

 It took me a while to find enough information on the relatively-new Android port of Emacs, so I'd thought I'd gather everything I found together here to help others out.
 First of all, the version of Emacs available on f-droid is out of date. Uninstall it. Also, and this may be inconvenient for lots of people, if you have and are using Termux, you should uninstall that too. That's because the optimal way to use the GUI-based, Android-native version of Emacs is in tandem with a custom fork of Termux which shares a developer ID with Emacs so that they can cooperate. If you don't know, Termux is a command-line GNU/Linux shell and environment for Android with a package manager. With the custom version, you can use the Termux package manager to install GNU/Linux app…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have been one of the people who have never gotten used to the terminal inside emacs. I think the main reason is how the history works. 
 Is there a way to make the history work like a regular terminal, rather than jumping back in the buffer to its position?
 I wrote a three part method to switch, using bash in a terminal (it should be OS agnostic), to the directory of the active window:
 First, emacs:
  #+begin_src emacs-lisp (defun dmg-current-dir () (if buffer-file-name (file-name-directory buffer-file-name) (expand-file-name default-directory))) #+end_src 
 then create a script, I call it edir , put it in your path
  #!/bin/bash emacsclient -e "(progn (set-buffer (window-buffer (selected-window))) (dmg-current-dir))" | perl -pe 's/^"(.+)"/$1/' 
 Finally create a function in your .bashrc
  function cde { A=`edir` cd "$A" } 
 Source your .bashrc. now you can simply run cde to change to the current directory (and use edir for other commands)
 I am sure it can be done in two steps (emacs + function) but my bash skills are limited.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I see big projects like yasnippets deprecating (Clojure term) namespacing/(emacs term) prefixing with a slash for namespacing with a dash. For example, yas-recompile-all is now replacing yas/recompile-all. I see such conventions followed for other libraries, too. Personally, no doubt because I'm a Clojure programmer, I like the slash over the dash. It is more distinctive, knowing "this isn't just a core function with that name, but an actual NS (ish)." I guess it might be more honest to elisp not to indicate there is a true namespace and it's all just a naming convention, but is this really the reason? Or is it something about compatibility (maybe with terminal users? Do terminals dislike the /?), or about interop (maybe libraries like yasnippet are also being ported to other things, like VIM or VSCode, that might have an opinion?) Does anyone know why dashes are preferred to slashes?

 But as a damn stubborn clumsy guy I am, in my n-th try it just worked. Now I want to get dap mode working and some tweaks that would be nice for me to have, but that's another story. 
 Huge shoutout, thanks and props to all the emacs community. There are lurkers out there that don't say anything (like myself until today) but that are eternally grateful for your tirelessly effort.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, this is my first post here. I've been learning Haskell on-and-off for about a year now. I've completed two or three beginner-level books, but I still find it challenging to write full-fledged Haskell apps. Simultaneously, I've been dabbling a bit with Rust.
 My dilemma is that I lack sufficient experience and a deep understanding of the philosophies of these two languages to make an informed choice on where to invest my time. I've tried both, but I feel that I won't be able to make an effective comparison without creating a larger project in each (for which currently I have no time unfortunately).
 I'm love Haskell's purity, abstractions, and expressiveness and at the same time I find memory management in Rust to be a bit of a pain. However I've noticed many people transitioning from Haskell to Rust, and that Rust ecosystem is much more lively and it's causing me to wonder if Haskell is slowly falling out of favor.
 The response I've seen several times is that Haskell is worth it for it's educational aspect, but I'm interested in more practical side of things. Is there anybody who thinks that Haskell is better then Rust for real world applications?
 From my current perspective, Rust doesn't seem like a direct replacement for Haskell. I'm not sure how to incorporate the functional style I love into Rust. Could this just be a lack of expertise on my part? Would I eventually be able to write Rust in a way that captures what I like about Haskell?
 I'm aware this topic has been discussed many times in various forums, but I still can't shake the feeling that focusing on Haskell might not be a worthwhile investment. Would it be more reasonable to spend time gaining a deeper understanding of Rust?
 Any insights from those with broader experience in both languages would be greatly appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi. I'm wondering if there's a package that lets you send marked text to your kindle email address? I tried to copy/paste some text from a buffer into mu4e and send it to my kindle email address and forgot that it has to be in attachment form. So I'm just thinking if there's a way to do export it automatically as an attachment somehow and attach it to an mu4e compose buffer automatically with your kindle address.
 That could be really nice to read very long screens of text.
 I couldn't find one with a search but maybe it still exists?
 EDIT: After talking to some people in #systemcrafters and the like, here's the ideal:
 1) Mark text in a buffer
 2) Hit M-x <command>
 3) It exports text to like /tmp/ as a .pdf or .epub or something
 4) then it opens mu4e and attaches as an attachment
 5) it fills out the email for [name@kindle.com](mailto:name@kindle.com)
 And then all you have to do is hit C-c C-c to send.
 I see this as really useful for reading very long text buffers in a more convenient way than on a laptop or monitor screen for a long time.

 And just in advance, I already know about Lisp machines and how they relate to Emacs.

 If it needs doing, I need advice on which hooks to use to get it to run at the right time.

 I'm almost completely happy with my new config. I have only one thing I need to address:
 When I add a new package (via use-package, generally) to the config, it almost always fails to download the next time I restart emacs. This is because of the package contents data being stale. I was manually running (package-refresh-contents) and restarting a subsequent time, but that was getting old. Especially given that I was experimenting with a variety of different packages.
 So I added that command to the start of my init.el, right after (package-initialize). And that added several seconds to my start-up.
 What do the rest of you do, to address this? Just accept that adding a new package means you have to refresh contents before restarting? Or is there some way to run this asynchronously?

 We wouldn’t be able to transform chained maps into nested maps because map doesn’t guarantee that it returns a List, no matter what function we pass. flatMap does. 
 But I'm looking at the scala API and it looks like the map function for List does guarantee that it returns a List? https://www.scala-lang.org/api/2.13.3/scala/collection/immutable/List.html#mapB:List[B]

 In which scenario would a map function mapped over a list not return a list? Even if it's empty

 https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/16gzmmi/orgwindowhabit_an_alternative_habit_system_based/?sort=new
 I've always found that the built in habit tracking provided by org-mode that is based on repeaters is less than ideal for capturing anything other than the notion of repeating something at some fixed interval (typically daily).
 The way that I think most people think about non-daily habits is that they ought to be completed some number of times within a certain window. For example, you might set the goal of doing some form of cardiovascular exercise at least 4 times a week.
 org-window-habit Allows you to do exactly this. Instead of relying on org repeaters (or even the habit flavored org repeaters), it uses properties from the org drawer to understand the constraints the user would like to have around their habit. To explain how this is useful, I'll return to the 4 days a week example from above. If you wanted to give yourself some leeway within an individual week (life happens), but still wanted to ensure that in the long term you are conforming to your goal of 4 repetitions a week, you might do something like specify a short term window where 3 repetitions are required in a single week, but 16 repetitions are required within any 4 week period. This would allow you to require that you're never completely falling off the wagon with your habit, but also that you can do a bit of makeup/slowdown, as long as you are roughly hitting your goal when you zoom out enough.
 For more details, take a look at the README, but also be aware that even more customization is available (take a look at the source code if you are so inclined). If it seems that people in the community are interested in this sort of habit tracking I'm happy to document even more details about how this package works, but at this point, I want to evaluate whether or not people are interested in using it before I put more work into it.

 I really have no idea how to use propertize, or what delight wants from me. I mostly just want the ability to make that particular icon larger on the mode-line. Can anyone help? Give me a fish by showing me what's wrong with my syntax. Teach me to fish by explaining how I can find valid args with propertize. I've looked online, in examples, and in the emacs info and though they point me to good information, nothing actually helps me know how to up the size of a particular item in the modeline.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The topic of auto suggesting packages for installation when a user ends up in a fundamental mode buffer recently came up on the emacs-devel mailing list.
 I'm not sure if/how the feature will work in package.el, but I've implemented an extension for Elpaca.
 The basic idea is that the package maintains a "database" of entries that would be added to auto-mode-alist, interpreter-mode-alist, and magic-mode-alist. When elpaca-suggest mode is enabled and a fundamental mode buffer is visited, the database is checked to see if an appropriate mode can be installed. When the user installs one of the suggested modes, it is enabled in the fundamental-mode buffers it applies to.
 If any Elpaca users are interested, testing and feedback are appreciated. No need to alter your config. Running the following test will allow you to experiment in a test environment.
 (elpaca-test :interactive t :ref "feature/suggest" :init (elpaca elpaca-suggest (elpaca-suggest-mode))) 
 For example, creating a file named "test.d" should suggest d-mode for installation.

 There are some small issues with association lists (that I will eventually change) but besides that it should work for any org file.
 I also for the life of me can't figure out how to make emacs use the fonts in the flake without resourcing to globally installing it (I wanted to make it a standalone package) and would love to get some help.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone. I'm on a mission to escape the switching-notes-app-software-treadmill world we currently live in, and I'm wondering if emacs could be the answer. I'll describe my use case and let you be the judge. Any and all input is appreciated.
 I'm currently a masters student in clinical counseling intending to go into private practice. This means I'll need a notes app that is HIPAA compliant, yet the state of feature rich note taking in out-of-the-box electronic health records software is abysmal. I've narrowed down the list of non-commercial, open source notes apps to neovim, qownnotes, zim, and emacs. 
 Of those, Emacs seems by far the most feature rich. I'm coming from Obsidian. I don't mind a steep learning curve, I just want something I can stick with for the long haul.
 Does anyone know if emacs can be configured for HIPAA compliance, or know of any resources that could help me confirm or deny this? Thank you in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This post is not meant to cause flame or anything. I’m sincerely asking this to understand relationships between various concepts. Asking on this sub because it has lots of people who probably know a lot about type theory.
 It seems to me that in Smalltalk, Common Lisp, and other languages that treats classes as objects at runtime, we basically get all three things one can get in lambda cube. A message to create a subclass is a type dependent on type; all generic functions/messages are terms dependent on type; to achieve type dependent on term we basically just write a method that calls type constructors based on input term. Essentially, by treating types (classes) as runtime values (objects), we basically make them first class and get everything from reflection. If one doesn't like nominal subtyping, we can also achieve similar expressive power by supporting "algebraic classes" at runtime.
 Given that there are so many research into making more expressive type systems, I suppose that there’s probably a lot of other things that I haven’t thought about. Other than guaranteeing termination or improving performance of programs, what are some benefits of a powerful static type system over the runtime first class type approach I mentioned above?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been using 29.1 for a few weeks now, having built it myself from source (installed to /usr/local). At the same time, I found the Homebrew build of this version for MacOS to be much easier to install and manage than trying to build it. So I tried the Homebrew installation for Linux earlier today, and... it was weird.
 It will not open a GUI instance, plain and simple. Trying to launch it from my dock failed to materialize a window. So I popped into a terminal window and ran it manually. It opened up as a text (non-X) application, but it ran code that is gated on a test of window-system:
 (use-package display-line-numbers ;; Number ALL the lines :if window-system :config (global-display-line-numbers-mode t) (setq display-line-numbers-grow-only t)) 
 When this (terminal-bound) emacs started up, it was showing line numbers. When I run the self-built copy (with -nw) it doesn't set the global-display-line-numbers-mode mode.
 As a test, I even ran the Homebrew version with an explicit --display argument, but still text-only (with line numbers).
 Anyone seen something similar? I'd like to have this be managed by Homebrew, so that I can get updates without manually rebuilding.

 If you're using ZIO, you might enjoy this little compiler plugin I made, that makes the infamous ZIO type mismatch errors more human-readable.
 Due to a small change in Scala 2.13.12 I needed to create a new release, so if you're using ZIO Clippy and upgrading to Scala 2.13.12, you'll have to update the plugin.
 The easiest is cloning the repository and running sbt +install. See the README for more information!

 Is it possible to get rid of embark's prefix key embark-act and if not, which function will return the buffer selected in the minibuffer so that I can write a defun ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've seen a lot of people talking about Emacs 29 and it's new set of features like tree-sitter and LSP support through Eglot. However, no one seems to ask how to get a version of Emacs built with these features enabled.
 Right now I'm running Fedora Workstation 38, and I've searched Copr for Emacs 29 builds as it is yet to be released in the main repos, but I found nothing.
 I then tried to build it from source, downloading the latest tag's tarball from the Savannah repo. I looked at the options offered by the configure script, and enabled the tree-sitter option, as well as the json built-in support and the mailutils option. However, I was still missing a dependency : json. And nowhere to be found on Fedora's repos (I tried every version of json-c but none of them seem to do the trick). And when I finally gave up and the script was finishing its job, tree sitter, image support, and all the good stuff was disabled, and I have no idea how to enable it back.
 So, my question is : how can I get a copy of Emacs with all the fancy stuff enabled on Fedora ? Building from source is not a problem, but the instructions provided by GNU are lacking clarity for me.
 Some help would really be appreciated, and sorry if I sound like a total noob but I kinda am 😅

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I just started learning Haskell. I have experience in Python, JavaScript and TypeScript.
 data BinTree a = Leaf | Node a (BinTree a) (BinTree a) deriving (Show) depth :: BinTree a -> Int depth Leaf = 0 depth (Node _ left right) = max (depth left) (depth right) 
 So basically the above is my approach to finding the depth of a Binary Tree. It is performing (implicit?) recursion on the left and right nodes and getting the max depth. I have come to realize that in python or other languages, depth Leaf = 0 would basically just be an if-statement which is a base case.
 But in Haskell, in this context, it is referred to as pattern matching as far as I'm concerned. So what is pattern matching really? And how does this code differ from me writing a simple if-statement?
 In Haskell does "=" have more meaning than just defining a value? Does it represent anything else?
 My interpretation of the code above is.
 // takes in a BinTree object depth :: BinTree a -> Int // If the BinTree so happens to be a leaf, return 0 depth Leaf = 0 // Else perform recursion on left and right depth (Node _ left right) = max (depth left) (depth right) 
 So what really is Pattern Matching doing here?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have the following Cache implementation:
 trait Cache[F[_], K, V] {
 def get(key: K): F[Option[V]]
 def put(key: K, value: V): F[Cache[F, K, V]]
 }
 An implementation of that trait like this:
 import cats.effect.kernel.Async 
 case class ImmutableMapCache[F[_]: Async, K, V](map: Map[K, V]) extends Cache[F, K, V] {
 override def get(key: K): F[Option[V]] =
 Async[F].blocking(map.get(key)) 
 override def put(key: K, value: V): F[Cache[F, K, V]] =
 Async[F].blocking(ImmutableMapCache(map.updated(key, value)))
 } 
 object ImmutableMapCache {
 def empty[F[_]: Async, K, V]: F[Cache[F, K, V]] =
 Async[F].pure(ImmutableMapCache(Map.empty))
 }
 I then have my application code, creating an instance of this case class and then use the pur, get operation to work with the Cache. But my application uses a different effect type and I would like to pass on that effect type to the ImmutableMapCache. But here I'm restricting my ImmutableMapCache to an Async effect type. So the question is, can I make my ImmutableCacheMap even more generic so that I can pass the effect type from outside?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I use subdirectories in my org-directory that also serves as org-roam-directory. This means that to place a new file in the proper subdirectory, I either need to update/expand my capture templates each time when I add a subdirectory or that I need to refile or manually move the file after creating it.
 This is not a completely unsolved problem, fortunately, but most solutions are more complex than mine and require significant tailoring to one's own setup. So I set out to write something simpler using the ${foo} construct from Org-roam's template expansion.
 Quite happy with the solution that is also the first bit of elisp that I fully wrote myself (while of course being inspired by the examples on the web). I first set up a function to (recursively) collect all subdirectories below the org-directory. The resulting list is then used in a completing-read. Because ${foo} gets the file argument passed by Org-roam's capture system, the pl/ask-para-location needs to get accept this input although it doesn't actually use it.
 Together this enables interactively drilling down a directory structure or (even) to create a new (sub) directory by entering a new string instead of selecting a directory from the list provided by/to completing-read.
  (defun pl/org-roam-directories () (let ((files (mapcar (lambda (f) (file-relative-name f org-roam-directory)) (directory-files-recursively org-roam-directory "\\.org$")))) (mapcar (lambda (f) (file-name-directory f)) files))) (defun pl/ask-para-location (ARG) (completing-read "Choose org file :target : " (pl/org-roam-directories))) (setq org-roam-capture-templates (quote ( ("d" "Default" plain "%?" :target (file+head "${pl/ask-para-location}/${slug}.org" "#+title: ${title}\n") :unnarrowed t )))) 
 Proud of this little snippet!
 (edit: small font locking improvements)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A discussion question.
 I was porting a script I wrote to Scala Native when I started encountering missing APIs in Scala such as Scala's version of java.time. Even once I found a 3rd party library it wasn't 1-to-1 compatible tojava.time (for example had a different set of ZoneIds). It took some digging and trial and error (and testing stuff in run-time because these were Java dependencies).
 This experience got me thinking what else is in common use that should become part of the Scala API to be JVM agnostic? There's a sentiment lately that Scala shouldn't rely strictly on the JVM (can be seen here and there in the comments, JdG wrote about it) so perhaps making a standard for common APIs would help porters target only Scala and not create Java shims to the entire Java API.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am using the stack consult/vertico/orderless. When I want to search a directory often the order is not sorted properly. Suppose that I have the directory Music in my home directory. If I use consult-find and search for the pattern "Music" I get other entries first, while the closest pattern is burried somewhere in the middle.
 ~/bla/bla/bla/Music ~/aaa/bbb/bb/Music ~/ccc/ddd/eee/Music ... ~/Music 
 If I specify a pattern, how do I get the closest match as the first line? I would expect to have this instead:
 ~/Music ~/bla/bla/bla/Music ~/aaa/bbb/bb/Music ~/ccc/ddd/eee/Music ... 
 Note that here the closest pattern is in the first place. That would be my goal. First the closest matches, then the rest.
 Thank you for sharing with me your wisdom.

This is the question: can someone just confirm or explain what The Archive does when you click on a link such as [[202309091054]]?
What I think I have read elsewhere in the forum is that The Archive takes the information inside the set of double brackets and searches both the names and the content of all files in your Zettelkasten directory, and returns the name of any file where a match is found.  Is that correct?  If not, please enlighten me 
Also, is the information within that set of double brackets limited to 12 characters or can it be any length of characters?
I'm just trying to understand how the linking functions.]]></summary>

 I was wondering if Haskell has a place where the best libraries for common tasks, together with their strengths and weaknesses, are listed like Rust has in blessed.rs. This would be really useful because just from hackage, its hard to determine which packages have the most features and best support and docs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've found a ton of posts/questions/answers about Haskell binary size in general (tl;dr: they're big 'cause static linking!), but I recently got curious about the drastic differences in size across platforms.
 I've built a couple of little tools which I've released for Linux, Mac, and Windows. I recently pushed out a new version of one and was startled to see the difference in binary size, despite building them all exactly the same way:
  
Linux: 23.8 MB
 Mac: 9 MB
 Windows: 37.8 MB
  
Crazy! Can anyone help me understand what's going on here? I assume they're all statically linked.
 Oh, and to be clear: this isn't a problem for me. I don't really care about binary size in this case. I'm just very curious!
 By the way, this is the tool. And here's its package.yaml, if that matters. (FWIW, I've built all three binaries the same way, with a simple stack build, using GHC 9.2.8.)
 Anyway, thanks for any info!

 That said -- It's hard for me to believe standard emacs text editing facilities are more efficient than modal editing (for someone that really groks modal editing). I'm curious if there are any vim veterans that believe otherwise, and if so, what specifically makes you think that. 
 I understand efficiently modifying text is just one part of a productive workflow and emacs has many other advantages, but I'm talking text editing here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was getting super excited about beOrg plus workingcopy on my iPhone. Got everything "working" and then started a simple test.
 Test 1: I went into a large personal.org file and changed the status of something from NEXT to DONE. Hit the back arrow since I think it just saves. Go to workingcopy and it shows the file has changed, great. And then do a diff... and it's several hundred changes, all of which look identical in the diff. Maybe its a word wrap (can't tell on the phone), sometimes a space. Just a bunch of green and red highlighted sections of the same content. I didn't notice a pattern.
 Test 2: I just went into the same file in basic text mode and added "test save" text at the top. Do the diff in working copy and the entire file isn't mangled, it just show test save as new text. BUT there is also an added block at the bottom of the file #+BEGIN_SRC scheme / blank line / #+END_SRC. How totally random?!?! (I've never made a scheme block in my life)
 ​
 So, is beOrg just doa or what am I doing wrong? It didn't parse the SEQ_TODO block at the top of my file so I added my states in the settings, but other than that it's entirely vanilla setup. I'm so bummed I had finally got this all up and working and it just seems non-functional. I'm hoping someone can point me in the right direction and I'm doing something stupid. Maybe there is a setting to not add a bunch of invis ctrl characters somewhere?
 Thanks again for any and all help.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been using org-mode long enough that I'm coming up with all these weird bespoke things that I want to do with it, such as create types. For instance, when I'm reading a book, and creating notes about the book, I have some mashup of the book's title and author as a headline; and notes are in sub-headings underneath that. I just informally made this up as the need arose for various kinds of thing.
 It would be nice to regularize this, so that I could later write code that has a sense of what a "book" is, and its fields (author, publication date, ...) and to check for the inclusion of those fields, or integrity check them, or whatever. I'm only just beginning to think about this because I have only recently come to want it based on the way I've been using org-mode, but I'm sure this has been discussed many times, and maybe there's even a package or a method that's well-understood. Some of the new-fangled PKM tools have versions of this (e.g., Logseq, Tana) but they're undesirable for other ways (mainly, in my case, their editors suck so hard).
 Could anyone suggest existing thinking on this topic, or proposed packages, or reasons why it's a terrible idea?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I wrote the following piece of code to derive a headline from property values. Ideally, I would just replace the text of the title, and leave the other properties (todo, priority, tags) in place. 
 The code below instead rebuilds the whole headline by first gathering the properties, building a new title string, and then re-inserting it in the buffer.
 I am wondering if there is a simpler/smarter way
  (save-excursion (org-back-to-heading t) (let* ((point (point)) (todo (org-entry-get point "TODO")) (priority (org-entry-get point "PRIORITY")) (tags (org-entry-get point "TAGS")) (title (concat (make-string (org-outline-level) ?*) " " (cl-destructuring-bind (title-comps title-format) (mv/org-get-title-info) (mv/format-section-title title-format (mv/org-collect-section-properties% title-comps point)))))) (delete-region (point) (line-end-position)) (insert title) (when tags (org-set-tags tags)) (when todo (let ((current-prefix-arg 0)) (org-todo todo))) (unless (char-equal (aref priority 0) org-default-priority) (org-priority priority)))) 
 What the code is doing, is as follows
  
Extract todo, priority, tag info
 Build the new title along with leading `*` 
 Delete the title line, and insert the new one
 Re-assign todo, priority and tags.
  
It is working so-so. Still has rough edges.
 My question is: Does org.el have code that will allow me to replace the title in place? I could define my own regexp to do it. But maybe there is existing plumbing already in place.
 Thanks,

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Is there any way to ignore the files and directories starting with dot in eshell using vertico, or in general, in any of the completion frameworks? I am currently using vertico, but I am willing to switch to something else, provided that it allows to filter the dot files. Ideally, I would like the files and directories starting with dot to be suggested only when I insert the initial dot as a part of the name. Otherwise, they should not be suggested.
 Can this be done?
 Also, when using pcomplete, is there any way to integrate fuzzy search in the completion? Right now the only thing I can do is use C-n and C-p or click on the entry in the window containing the suggested list of items.
 Thank you for sharing your wisdom with me.

 I want to preface that I love Haskell. It is my favorite language by far, I love the syntax and I want to use it as much as I can because it's a blast to code in.
 But I can't get cant get anything working! I've tried multiple GUI packages, multiple plotting packages, quipper (quantum computing), and the physics module. I have such a hard time just installing things that I'm starting to get turned off. Even java fx has been more pleasurable to work with. 
 I really love there language but my patience is running thin, does anyone have tips?
 I want to learn more but I need to be able to use packages. If you know a good way to install any GUI or plotting package please let me know. If you have also run into quipper issues too. I use WSL 2.0 on windows 10 (since I've had a lot of trouble running on native windows) and I install everything with ghcup.
 Greatly appreciate any and all advice.

Any action (like navigation) in the mini buffer results in Tramp refreshing this git-gutter connection all the time.
 Has anyone experienced this before and knows a workaround? I see that git-gutter is no longer actively maintained (https://github.com/emacsorphanage/git-gutter/issues/151). I'd like to switch over to Vertico + Consult, but I use this workflow often and hope it to get it working.

 I'm pleased to announce version 0.2 of indent-bars, which now supports tab-based indent, works in terminal using character-based display, and can leverage tree-sitter for context-aware bar depth. You can also now start bars at column 0 or another offset.
 Lots of formatting options; here's a simple one that highlights the current depth (red) by increasing its contrast:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm working on a project with a large submodule. The files in the submodule are making it harder to find the files in my project. How do I stop projectile from listing these files?
 Walking through the projectile-find-file source, I got to projectile-dir-files-alien which returns the list of files that projectile-find-file suggests. It uses the following:
 (nconc (projectile-files-via-ext-command directory (projectile-get-ext-command vcs)) (projectile-get-sub-projects-files directory vcs)) 
 For the case of git. So it initially seems it's hardcoded into projectile that it finds "sub-projects" (which based on projectile-get-all-sub-projects seems to be used synonymous to submodule).
 Going a little further I get to:
 (defcustom projectile-git-submodule-command "git submodule --quiet foreach 'echo $displaypath' | tr '\\n' '\\0'" "Command used by projectile to list submodules of a given git repository. Set to nil to disable listing submodules contents." :group 'projectile :type 'string) 
 Which is used by `projectile-get-immediate-sub-proejcts` to name the project's submodules. But I'm still getting the submodule's files after setting that to null (even after restarting emacs and running projectile-invalidate-cache). I also tried running the projectile-git-command directly in a terminal to confirm that that command was not listing submodule files.
 Any ideas what I'm doing wrong?

 Most days it is useful as my notes from the previous day are automatically brought to the present, however occasionally an entire page's worth of notes is just dropped! This has happened 3 or 4 times in the past month and it is driving me insane
 Today I went to add to my org journal and all the TODOs from the previous day were gone. Moreover, the previous day's journal file was automatically deleted. Luckily I was able to open up a buffer with the same file name and spam undo, and my research journal luckily was cached and restored.
 I am hoping you all can help me with the following issues:
  
How do I avoid the auto-deletion of old content when rolling tasks forward? I'm okay with some redundancy/bloat in my filesystem if it ensures that I don't lose day's worth of work/my healthy todo list
 
Is this just user error? Should I not be carrying TODOs over multiple days. I'm not really sure if what is happening is desired behavior of org journal or a strange occurrence

What is the prober way to do this and to ensure tab is working?

 I've been using org-mode for over a decade, and it's the best solution I've ever used. However, I struggled with the lack of mobile apps that fully supported org-mode a few years ago. So, several years ago, I decided to develop an android app that would allow users to use org-mode on mobile devices just like in Emacs. At that time, Notion didn't have the influence it does now, and Obsidian and Logseq hadn't been released yet. Later on, Notion became valued at billions, and Obsidian and Logseq secured investments. However, I found that they all had various limitations and couldn't provide the complete org-mode experience. This strengthened my determination to bring…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I would like to set the keybindings for minor modes in their respective keymaps using the minor-mode hook. Using local-set-key, the same operation for MAJOR modes is easy. However, it appears that I must name the minor-mode keymap in every define-key expression, e.g.:
 (defun my/add-tab-bar-history-keys () 
 "Specify more convenient keybindings for the functions that traverse the history of the tab-bar window configurations. This function is added to the mode hook for tab-bar-history-mode." 
 (define-key tab-bar-history-mode-map (kbd "C-q b") 'tab-bar-history-back)
 (define-key tab-bar-history-mode-map (kbd "C-q f") 'tab-bar-history-forward))
 I could use map() to eliminate the redundancy, I guess, but something like local-set-key() would be more convenient and robust. 
 After scouring the Web, I found this StackOverflow question from 10 years ago, viewed 1k times, "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19308390/how-to-define-keymap-for-minor-mode-correctly, but it doesn't deal with this aspect of minor-mode keymaps. 
 Perhaps a more recent technique has emerged? Thanks for any thoughts!

 I installed nerd-icons, then M-x nerd-icons-install-fonts. Reactivating doom-modeline and there is no performance issue. Downright snappy.

 I would like to know if it's possible to use multiple instances of emacs (in different panels of zellij) on the same project/directory, and if so, how.
 Thanks for the answer !

The brain's analytical way of breaking complex things down into atomic parts is important. But it is far from all that is needed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm getting a weird shifting of the line numbers when using (setq-default display-line-numbers 'visual).
 When moving through rows of text, the whole buffer will shift to the right by (what looks like) 1 column. The row that this happens on isn't consistent either. Moving back up the lines of text will shift it back to the left.
 In org-roam it's usually between lines 6 and 7 that I get the shift. With emacs -q it happens between lines 1 and 2. With emacs -Q it happens between lines 9 and 10. I've seen it happen for lines above 40 even.
 I can stop it from happening by disabling the absolute numbering with (setq display-line-numbers-current-absolute nil), but then I loose absolute numbering; and that's not a solution.
 This doesn't happen when using relative numbering; only with visual.
 I've tried using both (setq display-line-numbers-width-start t) and (setq display-line-numbers-grow-only t) but neither appear to change anything. (As suggested in this post)
 I'm using emacs version 28.1. I'm fairly new to emacs too.
 Steps to reproduce:
  
Start emacs without config: emacs -Q
 Show line numbers: M-x display-line-numbers-mode RET
 Set visual line numbers: M-x set-variable RET display-line-numbers RET visual RET
 Press enter a few times until all text shifts right by 1 column. This happens between rows 9 and 10 for me.
  
Anyone have any suggestions on how to stop this from happening?
 Here is a gif showing what I'm seeing:
 text shifting when moving rows
 Update:
 It appears to be affected by the vertical size of the window. With 24 lines visible, the shifting gets pushed out to line 66/67. It is not affected by where in the window those lines are though.Fiddling with the window size, It looks like the shift position happens according to (# visible lines + cursor line # = 90).
 ie. 31 visible lines, shift between line 59/60.
 24 visible lines, shift between line 66/67.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 While trying to learn lenses, ReaderT Design Pattern and Continuation Passing Style, I came across the following when I'm unsure about a parameter:
 ​ haskell myLiftA2 :: (a -> b -> c) -> (Int -> IO a) -> (Int -> IO b) -> (Int -> IO c) myLiftA2 f enva envb int = f <$> enva int <*> envb int 
 [details="Summary"] I don't understand how the int parameter can exist on the left-side [/details]
 SOLVED: The type signature is the same as: haskell myLiftA2 :: (a -> b -> c) -> (Int -> IO a) -> (Int -> IO b) -> Int -> IO c  so the Int was there the whole time: Without the int, we return a function that takes an int and returns an IO c -> with it applied, we return an IO c :)
 I also notice this in the definition for a function to create a lens: EDIT: expanded type of Lens haskell lens :: forall f. Functor f => (s -> a) -> (s -> a -> s) -> (a -> f a) -> s -> f s lens getterFunc setterFunc sa s = setterFunc s <$> sa (getterFunc s) 
 where sa :: (a -> f a) and s :: s seem to appear out of nowhere on the left hand side.
 EDIT2: Now given the expanded type signature this is more apparent and this one is also now solved for me!
  
I now have a new issue:
 The type of most lens functions (getter, setter, traversal) tends to look like
 haskell type Getter/Setter s a = Functor/Applicative f => (a -> f a) -> (s -> f s)  which, in the case of getters apparently is equivalent to s -> a but not in the case of setters.
 In this case a getter can be a function that has a function of (a -> f a) and a parameter s and this should return an f s so I'm not sure how we get s -> a here.
 Can anyone help explain this to me?
 EDITS: Sorry for the edits, posted on reddit too and slowly working things out at the same time.

 That sql selects based on a field and I will have hundreds of such CRUD operations and it makes it complicated to remember all the column names of the tables in my database. I would rather prefer to leave it to a mapper (like in Slick) and just use my case class fields for formulating a query. How do you guys out there using doobie think about it? I do not see any value in doing it like this!

Pressing return on the dir in untracked files doesn't go into it (i thought maybe I could just add the files, but no joy). What gives?
 When I committed/pushed the wc-mode/ I staged I expected it to just add the subdir, but instead it went into creating a submodule (no experience with that term as far as VC goes) and added to the history that I merged a pull request from the git repo the dir originally came from (don't know where it grabed that info from). It was all very new, and pulling from my other machine just got me an empty dir. So I backed it all out manually by killing my .gitmodules file (newly created i think) and my .emacs.d/.git/modules/wc-mode (also newly created). Checked in the .gitmodules removal, but now looking for the way to just add a dir to my repo.
 I found a .git dir under wc-mode/ (don't think it was there before) and mv'd it to a bak. Now pressing return on wc-mode brings me up to .emacs.d in dired mode. Sooo confused now.
 (While I am curious about what how submodules work, and how it knew about the original github... I'd also really like to know just how to add a directory of files, since that seems very common.)
 ​
 Thanks for any and all help. I know this is a bit of a shit post from a debug perspective, but if you could point me toward the right info/book/etc that would be great. The magit info seems a bit obtuse at times, it's great for explaining low-level functions but not so much at explaining the designed workflow for things like this.

 I have been using org-mode (version 9.6.9) to write both pdf and html documents for a while now, but I never had a very clean setup.
 I am trying to follow the official documentation and other sources to set up a correct publishing environment, but I am encountering trouble for the latex part.
 I am working on a small example. Here I am starting with a tiny org/main.org file that I would like to export to both html and pdf:
 . ├── html ├── org │ └── main.org ├── pdf ├── project.el └── tex 
 My goal is to leave the org/ folder untouched by the publishing process so that no file will appear there and be copied everywhere.
 This is the result that I am aiming for :

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I would like to collect opinions from fellow Scala users.
 Given my experience in Scala it would be unfair not to provide my point of view so here it is:
 ​
 killer features:
 - domain modelling and processing: sealed hierarchies, type aliases, opaque types, pattern matching (Kotlin and especially Java falls behind)
 - contextual abstractions (unrivaled however there is little public knowledge on how to cook them properly)
 - DSLs (custom operators and occasional macro only, smart interpolation is landing in Java while Kotlin has functions with receiver type)
 - Innovations and other unique features (cool but hard to sell for commercial development)
 ​
 no-longer-killer features:
 - collections: Kotlin does it well, maybe even better (simpler hierarchy, faster, more helper methods on collections)
 - asynchronous/scalable code: project Loom does it better (however there are no established practices/usage patterns/libraries yet)
 - functional programming: practical parts have been absorbed by other languages, impractical are still plaguing Scala codebases.
 ​
 other stuff:
 - cats/ZIO/TF: imo requires too much effort with little gain unless writing complicated fiber interactions.
 - typeclasses: good for adapt-for-everything libraries, rarely seen in production code where abstracting over single specific type usually adds more complexity instead of reducing it.
 - HKT: GADTs? Never seen them in production code.
 - compile-time code generation: controversial. Can be enabler for unique code features (e.g. logging without org.slf4j.Logger instances or smart asserts) but is nightmare to develop, test and support. I'm quite sure everyone having macro-based RPC library silently wishes to rewrite it to plain old code generation.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I learned about Scala around 2 years ago and started actively learning it 1 year ago. Reading books, watching talks from Daniel Spiewak, John De Goes, and Rock the JVM.
 In my current job, I write Golang and Typescript, both on a massive microservices architecture that serves 7-digit devices, and have around 2 years of experience. I know the typelevel stack and can write/read Scala without a problem. Played around with Spark, Actors, and Akka HTTP too, so I guess I can orient myself in the ecosystem on what does what. I also have a bachelor's degree in tech/design.
 I read here that you shouldn't learn Scala because finding a job is very unlikely in some countries. So I knew beforehand, anyways I started my job hunt in Belgium. It has to be a permanent job and not too far away (1 hour 20min drive will do) or fully remote.
 So far I have found 3 companies: one paused the hiring, the other one only had one backend developer with 2 years of experience, and the last one I received no email, but they did view my LinkedIn.
 Either I become a data engineer and maybe I'll have another 5 companies I can apply to and will probably get no answer since I don't have a relevant master's degree or relevant experience. Or I start doing something else.
 Scala made me a better developer and taught me a lot so no regrets there. But what's the next best step forward? Should I get a job in Java (never written Java before) which will in the future improve my chances of landing a Scala position? Or should I hop on the Golang hype train? Of course, this greatly depends on the country. Here in my country, it is mainly .NET, Java, and Typescript. 
 There surely have been others of you that experienced this, What did you do?

 The goal is for me to move away from Slick and use some other library. I considered doobie and it seems not a wise option as it causes compatibilities with Monix. Is there any other alternatives? I'm considering using quill. But it is unfortunate that there is no active development happening on Monix these days. It is such an awesome library.

 There are still some tools I'd like to use from org-ref, especially the ability to refer to org-src blocks and to LaTeX equations/environments via ref:. This is the use-package declaration I had in mind:
 (use-package org-ref :straight t :after (org) :config (require 'org-ref) ) 
 I'm new to straight.el though, so I think this might result in more features being built via the default recipe than I need. Is there a more precise recipe that will e.g. build only org-ref-core.el that will do what I need?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a weird issue that I do not know how to debug. I am using sway and when I start my session sometimes the http links do not trigger the browser.
 In the sway configuration I export the browser variable:
 export BROWSER=firefox 
 I am trying to open the links from an emacsclient, but this also happens with a regular emacs session. The only way I can make it work, once it stops working, is to restart emacs. After I do that the links start triggering the browser again and everything works as intended.
 Could you please help me to debug this issue? I don't know how to proceed in this case, but I have found out that browse-url seems to be the resposible one. If I position the cursor on the URL and do M-x browse-url it does not work. Of course, after the emacs restart it starts working again. So, I think that this is the function that is failing.
 SOLVED: It is possible to add a handler and set the default browser with the browse-url-text-browser variable and then set the browse-url-browser-function as browse-url-firefox. This block of code solves my issue:
 (setq browse-url-text-browser "firefox") (setq browse-url-browser-function 'browse-url-firefox browse-url-new-window-flag t browse-url-firefox-new-window-is-tab t)

 I currently have v. 28.2 installed on my Mac. I'm trying to research upgrading to 29.1.
 On the download instructions page, it says to install using brew. But when I open a terminal and type ...
 brew info emacs
 ... if I'm reading it correctly, it looks like brew only has 28.2 
 Just wondering if anyone who uses a Mac can confirm with me that I'm on the right track?
 And has anyone with a Mac upgraded to 29.1? If so, how?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, r/Emacs,
 I recently began working on a major mode for Microsoft PowerShell, and after many late nights of perusing documentation, reading through source code of other packages, and debugging, it has been accepted into MELPA. This was a great learning experience and really gave me a brand new appreciation for the customizability of Emacs. 
 This package currently includes the following features:
  
Detailed syntax highlighting (variables, cmdlets, keywords, .NET types, strings, single- and multi-line comments, docstrings)
 Code indentation 
 Auto-complete for built-in and user-defined variables and cmdlets, built-in cmdlet parameters, and .NET types and members
 Spawning and sending code to an inferior shell process
 Support for PowerShell in Windows, *nix, and MacOS
  
I kind of hacked together the company backend, so it may not be as efficient as it could be. There may also be some bugs I missed (I haven’t figured out how to do company completion for multiple periods yet for the .NET types, for example), but I have been using it for writing PowerShell scripts at work and it’s been working well. 
 Feedback is always appreciated and pull requests are always welcome. I hope you guys enjoy the package!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've got a weird problem that I've been poking through the code and cannot find an option of how to set this. So recently (and probably foolishly) I did list-packages and let it update everything. Doing this kind of broke doom-modeline for me. I was getting weird ISO characters in the modeline, and with some research discovered that it had switched to nerd-icons at some point in the past. Previously it was working fine with all-the-icons. 
 Well I got nerd-icons installed and that fixed things up pretty much though the character is still quite small in comparison. However I discovered that the little icon doom-modeline uses for VHDL files is different from the one treemacs and all-the-icons uses for VHDL files. So this got me looking around for some definition of what file suffix gets associated with what icon.
 And that's where I got stuck. I can't find any option or list anywhere that sets that up. It's not that I need them to be the same (though I do prefer the one in all-the-icons) but now I'm just puzzled as to how this is assigned. Clearly it's got to be in the elisp somewhere, but... nothing so far.
 Does anyone know where it lists a character hex value and a file type list?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Currently, I do the following but wondering if there is a more efficient workflow. I use the full command names below to be clear but have key bindings for these. 
  
Open dired in the directory where I keep projects I'm working on.
 M-x magit-clone, select the [u]rl option and paste the SSH URL from the project (github say) repository and agree to the suggested local repository location
 Press n to the question: Set `remote.pushDefault' to"origin"? (y or n)
 Press M (for Remote) in the magit-status buffer for the local repository
 Press a (to add) and enter "fork" for the remote name. So "origin" refers to the upstream remote. This automatically presents the remote url as: git@github.com:fork/<project-name>.git. I don't like this.
 I move to the word fork in this URL and change it to my github username and then hit enter.
 Press y to the question: Set `remote.pushDefault' to"fork"? (y or n). This way I pull in from the upstream origin remote and push to my fork remote.
 Press b c to create a new branch etc. and begin my work
 
 What would be a more efficient workflow than this that would also avoid the incorrect URL in step 5 above? Thanks for your time.

 Regarding Scala 3 support, all modules in Pekko Connectors barring 2 have Scala 3 support with the exceptions being Pekko Connectors Slick and Pekko Connectors MongoDB due to underling libraries missing Scala 3 support. Scala 3 support in Persistence JDBC is also missing for same reason.
 When Slick 3.5.0 will be released with Scala 3 artifacts then Scala 3 support will be added and there are ideas to use ReactiveMongo for Pekko Connectors MongoDB which is currently working on Scala 3 support.

 I have a Haskell programming assignment due in a few days but I am stuck on the final component. The assignment is to render a variety of shapes through mouse and keyboard interaction in CodeWorld API. For example, one of the shapes is a "Line" which requires the user to draw a line in CodeWorld by "clicking" the screen to set the initial point and " releasing " the mouse to set the final point, and drawing a line between those 2 points.
 I have succeeded in rendering the shapes in CodeWorld, but the final element requires some more complex elements that I have no idea how to approach. The final functions require a user to press the arrow buttons on a keyboard to change the rotation and 'stretch' of a semiCircle and an ellipse. The rules are as following:

 For those that are unaware mermaid is an excellent way to programmatically define diagrams for technical writing. It is extremely org based workflow friendly.
 Mermaid is huge and not every part of the grammar is supported. See the README for more information about what is and isn't supported.

 However, I've been facing quite a challenge over the past year and a half (on and off), trying to download and integrate it into my DOOM Emacs configuration. Despite my persistent efforts, I haven't been able to get it up and running successfully.
 I also know that DOOM Emacs has its own flavor of Reveal.js integration, but it doesn't have what I want. 
 Can someone help me incorporate this in my config? I would greatly appreciate any guidance or assistance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When using the %\N escape code in a capture template, is it possible to modify the value prior to having it inserted into the capture buffer?
 My use case is the creation of a headline where I prompt once for a person's name, but then insert it twice: once into the main headline text, and once as a tag. Something like this:
 ("m" "meeting" entry (file+olp "~/org/logbook.org" "MEETINGS") "* MEETING with %^{Person?}\t:%\\1:meeting:\n%?" ) 
 And that's fine if I respond to the "Person?" prompt with just the person's first name. So responding "John" gives me something like this:
 * MEETING with John :John:meeting: 
 The problem is, the person's name is usually two space-separated words, and spaces aren't allowed in tags. So if I respond to the "Person?" prompt with "John Smith", I get something like this:
 * MEETING with John :John Smith:meeting: 
 with the tags being broken.
 At the moment I have a kludgy workaround where I simply prompt for the name a second time, and I respond to that with a tag-acceptable version. Something like:
 ("m" "meeting" entry (file+olp "~/org/logbook.org" "MEETINGS") "* MEETING with %^{Person?}\t:%^{PersonAsTag?}:meeting:\n%?" ) 
 So when prompted for "PersonAsTag?" I'll respond with "john_smith" (but "JohnSmith" would work just as well) to get:
 * MEETING with John Smith :john_smith:meeting: 
 But it is, as I say, kludgy. So, is there any way to munge what I get from %\1 prior to it being dropped in as a tag?

 I am currently considering writing my own modules for my own dotfiles by picking out modes for them, but before I do that, has anyone done the same already? And if you did, could you share your setup?

I've been using emacs for a couple of months now, so I'm still quite a noob, but managed to get a rather large config.org file, and I would like to find a way to look for a particular keybinding that I defined without having to read all the code from my config file. Is there a built-in function or an external package that would list all user-defined or user-modified (customized) keybindings and/or shortcuts?
 Thanks in advance for all your help.

 If I open a C++ file, verify that c++-ts-mode is running and try to use the keys "M-<up>" or "M-<down>" nothing happens. If I re-evaluate the code above and try the keys again, it works. It's as if the :bind must be evaluated late to take effect. Am I doing something wrong here? The same works fine with treesitter Python mode.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In emacs, in the same buffer, I can input Chinese characters. The characters are displayed properly, but when I copy the same characters from MS Notepad and paste them to the same buffer, they are displayed as garbage. What could be the difference? And how to fix the problem?
 I believe that I'm using UTF-8 encoding in MS Notepad, and I'm trying to use UTF-8 encoding in the emacs buffer. (There are many UTF-8-* encodings, I tried many, none so far works.)
 It's even strange that the same content from the MS Notepad, if I save it to a file, then open by emacs, then the same content is displayed properly! It seems that the copy and paste might introduce some noise?
 EDIT: 
 My emacs/doom runs in WSL2 in Windows 11. This causes the problem. If I run emacs natively, copy from Notepad and paste to the natively running emacs, there is no problem.
 I even tried to 
  (set-next-selection-coding-system 'utf-16-le) (set-selection-coding-system 'utf-16-le) (set-clipboard-coding-system 'utf-16-le) 
 in emacs/WSL2, it still does not work.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's my yearly annual "Let's try Emacs and fail miserably and give up in 3 days" day! So I'm excited to announce that I once again have a newbie problem I can not solve!
 The problem is, as a pleb I want to use cua keybindings with ergoemacs. I know there is a built-in cua mode but I don't like it that much. So ergoemacs it is. I did install ergoemacs from the elpa package repository and tried to follow the directions they give but there are problems, the official site https://ergoemacs.github.io/ asks me to add:
 (package-initialize) (require 'ergoemacs-mode) 
 to my emacs init file. When I add those I get the error of:
 ⛔ Warning (initialization): An error occurred while loading ‘/home/user/.emacs’:
 Wrong number of arguments: (3 . 4), 2
 To ensure normal operation, you should investigate and remove the cause of the error in your initialization file. Start Emacs with the ‘--debug-init’ option to view a complete error backtrace.
 Then I realised the line: (custom-set-variables '(package-selected-packages '(org ergoemacs-mode)) already exists so I didn't had to do anything about it, but then It wanted me to add:
 (setq ergoemacs-theme nil) ;; Uses Standard Ergoemacs keyboard theme (setq ergoemacs-keyboard-layout "us") ;; Assumes QWERTY keyboard layout (ergoemacs-mode 1) 
 Which I don't know where to add or how to add them. Can someone tell me, this worked perfectly when I last tried emacs.
 Answers such as "why not give emacs keybinding a chance?" or "why not use evil mode?" are prohibited since they literally are the opposite thing I'm asking here.

 build-site.el
 Hello everyone, I am trying to use ox-publish to build a static blog and am seeking advise on my setup so far for my publishing script. The one on the left hand side is the one I will be using, the one on the right hand side was the one I used to test to make sure I had the syntax correct and everything working.
 So my question is about the directories, I have one project called pages and that's where everything for the website lives in directory format. Static is where my assets live like css style sheet and images. 
 0xblockz · main ⟩ tree
 .
 ├── assets
 │ ├── img
 │ │ ├── logo.png
 │ │ ├── mastodon.svg
 │ │ └── planetary_system_icon_125429.ico
 │ └── style.css
 ├── build-site.el
 ├── index.html
 ├── notes.org
 └── README.md
 ​
 this is the tree of the directory I am not a web developer so any advise would be greatly appreciated thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am trying to apply the methods from this blog post by John Kitchin in order to automatically center latex preview fragments in org mode. The code is as below, after I got rid of some redundancies:
  (defun org-justify-fragment-overlay (beg end image imagetype) "Adjust the justification of a LaTeX fragment. Only equations at the beginning of a line are justified." (cond ;; Centered justification (= beg (line-beginning-position)) (let* ((img (create-image image 'imagemagick t)) (width (car (image-size img))) (offset (floor (- (/ (window-text-width) 2) (/ width 2))))) (overlay-put (ov-at) 'before-string (make-string offset ? ))))) ;; advise the function to a (advice-add 'org--format-latex-make-overlay :after 'org-justify-fragment-overlay) 
 The blog post was from many years ago, and it seems that some of the functions here, such as org--format-latex-make-overlay don't even exist in org-mode anymore. I tried searching through the org-mode source code and could not find any function with a similar signature as that of org-justify-fragment-overlay. Does anyone know of any potential fixes for this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As an active Emacs user and package developer, I've been contemplating the structure of tabulated-list-mode in Emacs Lisp, particularly its use of vectors. While vectors are efficient for indexed access, they present challenges when dealing with complex data structures or transformations.
 Much of my work involves parsing data from JSON API responses, which naturally form alist, plist, or hash-table structures. In the current iteration of tabulated-list-mode, a two-stage process is necessary: first, normalization into vector format (I find it hard to imagine a structure where the entry format (ID [DESC1 ... DESCN]) could originate from), followed by rendering through tabulated-list-print. This process can introduce performance inefficiencies.
 In real-world scenarios where normalization to the tabulated-list's vector format is unavoidable, the efficiency advantage of vectors is somewhat negated, and can even result in an overall performance loss due to the extra conversion step.
 I'd propose using lists instead of vectors in tabulated-list-format and tabulated-list-entries. This change could potentially allow for greater flexibility and better alignment with common data inputs. However, I understand that historical decisions and compatibility concerns may limit the feasibility of such changes.
 In the interim, I suggest enabling tabulated-list-print to act as a transducer, reducing the need for multiple iteration passes. This could significantly streamline the rendering of non-vector-compatible data while preserving compatibility and performance.
 I've noted that some libraries also struggle with this issue, resorting to workarounds and hacks, as evidenced in the magit-repolist-columns documentation string.
 I welcome your thoughts, advice, and any potential solutions or alternatives. If there are potential pitfalls I've overlooked, I'm keen to learn about them too.

 I would really appreciate it if someone would familiarize me with all the vocab/tools and recommend me how to install Haskell.
 I'm a python programmer and I use conda a lot, I looked up and found ghc available as a package on coda. I would prefer if I could install ghci and Haskell's package manager (if there is one? idk) through condaas well.
 any other advice is also appreciated

 Does anyone know what might be causing this? They are both python files incase that helps. 
 Thanks :) 
 Here is my config (I've tried emacs with just this and it gives the same result). So i think it must either be a bug in git gutter or something odd with these files (line endings? im not really sure). If it would help to link the files somewhere I can try do that.
  (use-package git-gutter :ensure t :delight :hook ((prog-mode . git-gutter-mode) (org-mode . git-gutter-mode)) :config (setq git-gutter:update-interval 0.5)) 
 Edit: didn't solve this as such, but think somewhere i messed the file encodings up. decided to just copy the contents of the files into a new file and it fixed the issue. bit annoying but will do.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Is it possible to set a random splash message from a list of provided messages in nano Emacs? Or does nano override all of them? I don't want to change the splash screen, just the message. For reference, I'm using Emacs-mac-port where the splash screen automatically disappear after 0.5 seconds. By default, nano splash screen show the message "GNU / N A N O" in bold with the message "Emacs made simple" in grey right below, I want to change the "Emacs made simple" line to a random message from a list of messages. 
 After screwing around in Emacs for hours on end with ChatGPT and the Internet it has been pretty fruitless (because it kept hallucinating nonexistent functions). I have tried some stuff such as initial-buffer-choice (turned out it randomize my scratch buffer's name in the modeline). There's this but it's only for images.
 Edit: I even tried this:
 (let ((inhibit-message t)) (message "Welcome to GNU Emacs / N Λ N O edition") (message (format "Initialization time: %s" (emacs-init-time)))) (require 'nano-splash) (require 'nano-help) 
 I tried removing the 'nano-help part because I didn't need to know initialization time. I tried removing 'nano-splash part then put the snippet above before the install nano line. Nothing works. It even broke the nano theme.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am so shocked to find that author of "The Language Instrinct" take Emacs as his writing company.
 In chapter 7 of "talking head", Professor pinker introduced some AI chatting programming, he write it as:
 A version of the program was later sold as a computer game in Radio Shack stores, and another comes packaged with ~my word processing program, GNU Emacs~. (The documentation says, “If using Emacs becomes terribly frustrating and none of the techniques described above solve the problem, Emacs can still help you. Type ‘M-x doctor RET.' “) Here is a typical dialogue: User: I have been rather depressed lately. Computer: Are you depressed often? User: Yes, almost all the time. Computer: Why do you say yes almost all the time? User: Right now I feel like I could cry. Computer: Is it because right now you feel like you could cry that you came to me? 
 I read "The language Instinct" of Chinese translated version in 2016 before met Emacs 2 years later in 2018, so have no impression of Emacs in this great book.
 (P.S. "the language insticnt" was by the first time to be translated in Chinese and introducded to the masses in 2015 which is 21 years after Professor Pinker published it in 1994).
 I am very shocked, this book re-forged my mind afterwards. After its reading, I set off to throw away various tools of note-taking and mindmaps, then encountered Emacs 2 years later.

 Dear all,
 We have an opening for a student internship at NASA Ames Research Center, next Spring:
 https://stemgateway.nasa.gov/public/s/course-offering/a0B3d000001OkSrEAK/onsite-virtual-improving-testing-capabilities-for-cfsrosfprime
 The student, if selected, will be working on extending our capabilities to test cFS/ROS/FPrime applications, especially those using Ogma and/or Copilot for monitoring. Both Ogma and Copilot are open-source software written in Haskell.
 Applicants for this internship must be U.S. Citizens and meet a minimum 3.0 GPA requirement. Prior experience is not required. Knowledge of the following will be considered a plus: Haskell or other functional languages, C/C++, Bash, git, Docker, Linux, NASA Core Flight System, Robot Operating System, FPrime. Please note that the academic level listed in the opening is merely indicative and students at other levels (e.g., PhD) will also be considered.
 For further details, or if you have any questions, see intern.nasa.gov and the specific listing at https://stemgateway.nasa.gov/public/s/course-offering/a0B3d000001OkSrEAK/onsite-virtual-improving-testing-capabilities-for-cfsrosfprime.
 Even though the deadline for applications is Aug 31, it will remain open for a few more days.
 I will be at ICFP during Mon 4 Sep - Sat 9 Sep. Find me there if you would like to discuss.

 After i started coding with lsp-mode (rust-analyzer as server) and company on, i realize that auto complete in company won't insert () for functions automatically.
 I know this may be a duplicated question but i still cannot find the solution.
  
And also how can i make YASnippet work with lsp-mode? Like showing both lsp and YASnippet completions in company menu.
 I tried copying Doom Emacs' hook but not working.

I'm particularly interested in integration tests, as it's harder to spot unintended interactions between the many functions that make up the algorithm than it is to spot bugs in a single function in isolation.
 I'm familiar with the QuickCheck paper, and I typically test functions by randomly generating test cases and, where possible, testing properties. The constraints that my rebalancer enforces define a set of properties that are easy to test, but they are not sufficient to guarantee optimality. It seems that the only general way to test for optimality would be to compare the output of my rebalancer to the output of an alternative rebalancer that tries to s…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a few different use cases for org mode that have a common feature: A template that is repeated in a file. For a fictional example:
 ``` * Beer Template - Country :: - Aroma :: - Taste :: 
  
Carlsburg
  
Country :: Denmark
 Aroma :: Citrus
 Taste :: Slightly bitter
 
 
Weihenstephan 
  
Country :: Germany
 Aroma :: Grains
 Taste :: Sweet wheat ```
 
  
I have tens of different files with these "templates". A common problem that I have is that I need to add or change a field in the template. For now, I'm using clever VIM searches and macros to manage the templates. Is there a better way, preferably using an Emacs or org-mode feature?
 In some cases where the field content is short, I've gotten away with using a table. But that is the exceptional case, usually the field content is too long to make a table useful.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have been using Emacs for a two years as my primary coding environment and use Org Mode with a suite of org related packages for class notes and case notes for work. I love the shear custom ability of Emacs and love the how it seamlessly integrates code and notes. I love literate programming and being able to tangle documents from org-mode so that my notes become the function code. I love the versatility of Emacs to literally do anything. I love org-agenda and I love tools like magit.
 I dislike the amount of time that I seem to need to delicate to ensuring Emacs is constantly functioning properly. I really struggle sometimes to fix and issue. For example: Org-ref recently stopped working, it took a week for me to solve the problem and I am still not sure how I solved it. I also feel lik…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Do any of you capture interesting current events in your zettelkastens?
There are a few topics that interest me. For example, in my job, I like to keep on top of certain technology trends and it's useful to me to track them. The stories I find might be slight, but I'm more interested in a larger pattern that they represent. The pattern may or may not be obvious at first, or it may end up going in a different direction than what I expected, or it may end up being noise.
My idea is that I would create a note documenting what interests me about the story and have a structure note representing the broader trend, but curious if others have thoughts on the merits and demerits of this kind of approach within a zettelkasten framework.
The concern I have is that I will fall prey to the collector's fallacy, and end up with a bunch of notes that are little more than "So this happened."]]></summary>

 I also use baseline spacemacs and evil-mode, specifically gh, gj, gk, gl to move around and in Vim there's "] z" to go to the bottom of the fold, but on evil mode it only shows "] z is undefined". Is there a plugin I'm could use or some org command to I could bind using evil-mode.

What are the general benefits and how noticeable of an improvement are they? I've heard the bad parts are performance issues.

The new version vhdl-mode 3.39 is out with some enhancements and fixes:
 VHDL-2019 support Style and template enhancements Enhanced compilation error parsing Many indentation fixes Emacs 28/29 support 
 Please check out the complete list of changes and the download link at
 http://www.iis.ee.ethz.ch/~zimmi/emacs/vhdl-mode.html
 Please report any bugs, especially regarding indentation, as well as any missing support for VHDL-2008/2019. That's the most important features I want to keep up-to-date in vhdl-mode.
 Happy coding! Reto

 With compiled Heist it seems like there's a rather narrow happy path that you are supposed to take: have an application monad and access that from within your (runtime) splices to fetch data from the database.
 There is a Stack Overflow answer that hints at the possibility to also get data into compiled splices outside of a monad but the Heist documentation for initHeist says:
  
We don't provide functions to add either type of loadtime splices to your HeistState after initHeist because it doesn't make any sense unless you re-initialize all templates with…]]></summary>

 But in emacs evil mode when I try to bind C-c to the same functionality it works in some places But when modes like haskell-mode is turned on it just starts to wait for a keychord I was wondering is there a way to work around that
 I had an idea of maybe introducing a state like emacs state Suppose I am in evil state and everything is working like vim I mean all the motions and then I press say “C-z” which toggles evil mode Now I am in emacs state and all the emacs key-chords start working
 Is there a way that I can achieve that?

 I'm using emacs 29.1 on WSL2. (I'm pretty sure this was an issue on emacs 28 as well)

 EDIT: OK, found the solution. An update in the doom-modeline breaks the `all-the-icons` package, so you have to use `nerd-icons` and its respective install fonts command.

 I'm using Emacs from Homebrew (29.1), and I had the following in my old configuration file:
 (setq mac-option-modifier '(:function alt :mouse alt) mac-right-command-modifier 'super mac-right-option-modifier 'hyper ns-alternate-modifier 'super ns-command-modifier 'meta ns-pop-up-frames nil) 
 This was cargo-cult stuff, though, cribbed from someone else's config (whom I can't remember). I tried to shrink it down to just this:
 (setq mac-option-modifier 'super mac-right-option-modifier 'hyper) 
 Because I really just need the super keysym working. But it doesn't-- I keep getting the alt keysym (doing a C-h k and using the key gives me something like "A-q", for example).
 Is there a good resource for these variables?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On behalf of maintainers I'm happy to announce tasty-1.5 RC1. Here is the changelog:
  
Progress reporting is no longer ignored. PrintTest constructor of TestOutput now has an extra field used to report progress. Supply const (pure ()) as this extra field value if you want to skip progress reporting (#311).
 foldGroup now takes [b] instead of b as its last argument to allow for custom fold strategies. This is a backwards incompatible change, but you can get the old behavior by applying mconcat (#364).
 Dependency loop error now lists all test cases that formed a cycle (#340).
 Dependencies can now be defined pattern-free with sequentialTestGroup (#343).
 Added --min-duration-to-report flag that specifies the time a test must take before tasty outputs timing information (#341).
 When a test failed with an exception, print it using displayException instead of show (#330).
 The -p/--pattern option can be specified multiple times; only tests that match all patterns are run (#380).
 Fix color scheme to make info messages visible in terminals with white background (#369).
 When parsing of a command-line option failed, report received option (#368).
 Support WASM (#365).
  
You can give it a try using the following cabal.project:
 packages: . packages: https://hackage.haskell.org/package/tasty-1.5/candidate/tasty-1.5.tar.gz https://hackage.haskell.org/package/tasty-hunit-0.10.1/candidate/tasty-hunit-0.10.1.tar.gz https://hackage.haskell.org/package/tasty-quickcheck-0.10.3/candidate/tasty-quickcheck-0.10.3.tar.gz https://hackage.haskell.org/package/tasty-bench-0.3.5/candidate/tasty-bench-0.3.5.tar.gz https://hackage.haskell.org/package/tasty-rerun-1.1.19/candidate/tasty-rerun-1.1.19.tar.gz 
 If all goes well, the release is scheduled for mid September.

 Haskell excels because it's truly an amazing language.
 ML has become interesting because it crossed this viability threshold in the last year where it unlocks many new exciting use cases.
 I've long considered that Haskell is the best lang+ecosystem in every way, except it doesn't have as much community momentum as python/JS, eg not as many libraries, not as much adoption.
 ML Benefits:
  
ML makes bridging that gap significantly easier; it's significantly easier to write and translate new libraries into Haskell
 
It makes onboarding new people to the community easier by helping them write code before they necessarily grasp all the language's nuances (yes this is a two-edged sword).

 I have following problem - there is some internal logic in emacs on when to split the window and when to reuse one of the windows when I, for example, commit via magit or use rgrep. On my laptop for example it is 2 and on my wide screen it is 4.
 The problem is that if I split wide screen into 4 it is too narrow for me. Can I limit number of windows so it stays 2 as on laptop? I found function to query this value but not to set it.

An opportunity that I couldn’t pass up by David Thrane Christiansen
A rare opportunity came by, and I will be returning to a full-time developer role at the beginning of October. Based on the hard work of our volunteers, the board, and our collaborators, the Haskell Foundation has become a key part of the community’s infrastructure. This will not stop - we’ve arranged for project work to continue after my last day, and the next ED will take over an organization in action.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Does anyone have experience in writing some very simple games in a functional language. I tried it and failed miserably. My approach was really bad. I tried to do an OO approach and everything got tangled in IORefs, IOs and a billion functions that do a lot of stuff and are difficult to refactor. 
 I would like to know if someone has tried this before and how they went about it. Let's say you have this very simple game, at the start you can choose how many players can play, they choose their name, the deck is shuffled, the players are put in a circular queue and the game begins. To play, simply write the card you want taken out of the pool in the order chosen. The game loop ends when no cards are left in the pool. How would you design something like this? How would you add on top? Is it possible to use an OO approach, where different "objects" can communicate with each other, or is another pattern better? 
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm a new Emacs user and I am finally getting to know all the key bindings out of my head! I'm following an Emacs from scratch tutorial which is very helpful!
 as I work on a couple of c/c++ projects I configured lsp and ccls. whilst they seem to work, it is not working as intended (for me).
 I have a project, let's name it project1. the root directory of project1 has a CMakeLists.txt file, another folder named "Arduino" with all Arduino libraries and a folder called "app" which includes my custom code.
 ​
 When I navigate to /project1/app and click on a .cpp file. ccls sets that as the root folder. the issue here is that definitions are not all being processes meaning if I would input a .h file not in /app I am not able to go to its definition or get any syntax help..
 ​
 I have tried to add a .ccls-root and .ccls file in /project1 but ccls seems to ignore this and creates a .ccls-cache always in /project1/app once I hopen a .cpp file in app.
 ​
 Does anyone know how to solve this or is this intended this way? I am also using projectile and treemacs! I appreciate all the help!
 here is part of my config regarding lsp and ccls
 ​
 ​
 (defun efs/lsp-mode-setup ()
 (setq lsp-headerline-breadcrumb-segments '(path-up-to-project file symbols))
 (lsp-headerline-breadcrumb-mode))
 ​
 (use-package lsp-mode
 :commands lsp
 :hook ((typescript-mode js2-mode web-mode) . lsp)
 :bind (:map lsp-mode-map
 ("TAB" . completion-at-point))
 :custom (lsp-headerline-breadcrumb-enable nil))
 ​
 (use-package ccls
 :hook ((c-mode c++-mode objc-mode cuda-mode) .
 (lambda () (require 'ccls) (lsp))))
 (setq ccls-executable "/usr/bin/ccls")

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Using org-super-agenda is it possible to only list the parent task in a project?
 Currently it seems that when I have tasks with sub-tasks and sub-sub-tasks each task-with-a-child is classed as project, even if they are part of a "parent" task. 
 In the example below, Project 1 and Task 1.1 both have children, but I want to only count Project 1 as the project (i.e. it's the parent) as well as Project 2. 
 * TODO Project 1 ** TODO Task 1.1 *** TODO Task 1.1.1 ** TODO Task 1.2 * TODO Project 2 ** TODO Task 2.1 * TODO Task 3 
 However, if I run the sample code Task 1.1 is included.
 (let ((org-super-agenda-groups '((:name "Projects" :children t) (:discard (:anything t))))) (org-todo-list)) 
 What I'm looking for is something similar to Bernt Hansen's project definition. I'm happy to keep using that if org-super-agenda doesn't do this...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently switched to org-preview-latex-default-process=dvisvgm and am really liking the nice vector rendering SVG provides. Given that SVG can be quickly displayed at any scale, I stick the following in my org-mode config. It rescales all latex preview fragments correctly with the text size as you zoom text. Works pretty much instantly, since no image regeneration is required.
 Looking forward to Org 9.7 and super fast preview rendering. Thanks to the org devs!

(lambda () (add-hook 'text-scale-mode-hook #'my/resize-org-latex-overlays nil t))) 
 org latex preview using SVG and automatic scaling. 160 snippets in file.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am taking mathematical notes using org mode and would like to have inline previews for commutative diagrams. For mathematical equations previews works perfectly with dvipng, but since dvipng doesn't play well with tikz-cd based commutative diagrams I changed to using imagemagick by setting org-preview-latex-default-process. However, when using imagemagick my latex previews (equations, diagrams etc) come out huge -- the text itself is appropriately sized, but the "frame" of the image is huge. See the below for examples:
 With Imagemagick: https://i.stack.imgur.com/SWS65.png
 With Dvipng: https://i.stack.imgur.com/yRkTV.png
 As you can see, in the first example the image is so large the lorem ipsum paragraph isn't even in view.
 How can I fix this? I would really like to use imagemagick for commutative diagrams, but having such huge images is unwieldy.

I posted this a while back but didn't get a response. Really sorry for posting again, but I'm still struggling with it!!! Thanks in advance for any thoughts.
When I use this function, The Archive copies the title of the note and the identifier, and pastes them like this:
[[201930091959 Alexander Gordon]]
It was my understanding, from reading the forum and blog posts over the years, that best practice was NOT to include the title of the note in any link, as the title may well change in the future and rather to link using the unique ID. So, I do this, with only the ID actually linking:
[Alexander Gordon][[201930091959]]
Any thoughts? Why does The Archive include the title when generating the link?
Cheers.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a pretty basic setup for writing org files with jupyter and converting that to an ipynb with pandoc. The problem I'm running into though is that the code blocks never recognize the conda environment. Below is my workflow for it and the error.
 ​
 This basically sets up my session and activates my conda environment, which is confirmed by the second command. This seems to work just fine.
 ```
 +BEGIN_SRC shell :session qiskit :results output
 conda activate tutorials
 echo $CONDA_PROMPT_MODIFIER
 +END_SRC
 ```
 Then I run some basic code and it fails at the imports with No module named 'jsonpickle'
 ```
 +BEGIN_SRC jupyter-python :session qiskit :results output :exports both
 import time import warnings from pathlib import Path
 import jsonpickle import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
 import numpy as np from scipy import interpolate
 +END_SRC
 ```
 So I added in another block to check that it was installed with
 ```
 +BEGIN_SRC shell :session qiskit :results output
 pip3 freeze | grep pickle
 +END_SRC
 ```
 When running that it shows I have jsonpickle installed. On top of that, even outside of the conda environment I have jsonpickle installed, so if it wasn't recognizing the environment and went without one then I don't know how that error would appear. Taking the same code and putting it in a python file and running that works just fine.

 I'm still learning PureScript, and I'm struggling to do that with Arrays or Strings. As far as I understand, I can't pattern match on arrays in a [x:xs] kind of way, as xs in this case will only match the complete rest of the array exactly.
 For Strings, at least Data.String has no cons. Of course I could List.fromFoldable <<< String.split (Pattern "") to get a List or similarly create a listf of Chars, but being able to do that without would be much cleaner. I'm sure I just don't know enough yet :D
 Also, Pursuit is quite a rabbit hole if one searches type signatures...

 I am using Plasma5. Recently I have a new installation of Emacs, but there is some very confusing behavior.
 Whenever I press M-x, the bottom end of the window moves up a bit (and the rest of the window doesn't change), and when I type a command and press Enter, the bottom end of the window moves up as well. The same thing happens when I use shortcuts like C-x v, etc. When I use it normally for a while, the window is almost down to the top half of the screen.
 I don't know if this is a bug in Emacs or some other program and don't know how to search for this problem, does anyone have any clue?
 Please let me know if I should provide more information.
 Thanks!

 im relatively new to doom emacs, been a month using it.
 for my note taking in class, i am trying to use org mode and add images to the text file. 
 the org-download package solves my problem, but i am unable to install it since i dont know what to do on the github page. 
 i dont know where to paste the code/what to do. 
 https://github.com/abo-abo/org-download
 I have however, been responsible and tried to trouble shoot the problem by: 
 ​
 - installing the org download package from package list
 - messing around with the config.el file 
 - researched about melpa
 ​
 despite being a beginner, could someone help me out to get it up and running
 ​
 warm regards, 
 Aryan
 ​
 ​
 despite this, nothing really works - i dont think its supposed to, since the github page had more instructions.
 no clue what to do

 I'm configuring my Emacs config again, and I'm wondering:
 - What is everyone's favorite file manager in Emacs to quickly rip through a given project directory to access it on the fly?
 Is there anything that would allow it so that the directory could be displayed in the middle portion of the screen as an overlay and would allow you to type a few characters to quickly rip through a project to find the given file you're looking for?
 ​
 I'm basically looking for the 'ripgrep' equivalent of a file manager. I've used Dired through and through, and want a faster workflow for modern web dev projects.
 ​
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I use org-roam and regularly use org-attach to add clippings or even as a save location for babel file outputs (e.g., generating a diagram or figure).
 I'm also a bit naughty, and don't always keep my files entirely atomic. Such that I quite often will retrospectively org-store-link on a heading, assigning it a new ID. But when I do this, any attachments in that section now break, as the results of (org-attach-dir) now are generated from the new ID, not the file-level one. I also generally like the idea of having a single (org-attach-dir) per file; but also to have that (org-attach-dir) be based on the file ID. 
 Is there a way to have (org-attach-dir) use the root/file-level ID for generating its file path? 
 Thank you very much for any advice.
 ​
 Notes:
 I've looked through the archives, with some related posts found but which don't quite match my needs.
  
Question on setting up org-attach folder per file. :: I'd still like to automatically generate from ID
 How to enable org-mode to search attachment in parent header's attachment folder :: this seems to be my question! But there wasn't any satisfactory answer at the time. tag u/shelper9527 
  
I've tried to set the DIR property to the value of (org-attach-dir) at the root, but I don't think its possible to dynamically set properties like this? This would be ideal, as I could do this only for new files, so not breaking files that already exploit inherited IDs.
 I've tried looking into the org-attach-use-inheritance, but it seems its not designed to enforce only using the root property.
 I suppose there is some advice-add magic that could be done to (org-attach-dir)? This would be satisfactory, but less preferred as I don't like over-coupling my org notes to my specific emacs dotfiles.

 I have been making a sound synthesis library which I want to share:
 https://github.com/Simre1/lambdasound 
 Compared to others of its kind, it's more low-level and simpler. You can work directly with audio samples while having some combinators for more complex work. 
 Here's an example:
 main :: IO () main = play 44100 0.5 $ let upwards = sequentially $ note <$> [c4, d4, e4, f4, g4] backwards = reverseSound upwards triad = setDuration quarterNote $ parallel $ note <$> [c3,e3,g3] pause = setDuration quarterNote silence in parallel [ upwards >>> dropSound halfNote backwards, repeatSound 5 $ sequentially [triad, pause, pause, triad] ] where note semitone = easeInOut 3 $ setDuration halfNote (asNote harmonic semitone) 
 If there's interest, I can put up the package on Hackage.

I'm using MSYS2 MINGW64 and used used pacman to get: 
 mingw64/mingw-w64-x86_64-emacs 28.2-4
 This version hangs when i invoke package-list-packages 
 I have to kill the process from another mingw64 window
 
 
 I uninstalled that version of emacs and then used pacman to get: 
 msys/emacs 27.2-1 <--- note that this sits in the msys space and not the mingw64 space; and for some reason only works in CLI mode (as if invoked with the -nw option)
 This version does not hang when invoking package-list-packages
 
  
Why: 
  
I'm stuck on windows with absolutely no admin privileges and there are various tools that are so far only for linux and a few only for emacs.
 While I do like the CLI version of emacs I sure would like to use the GUI version. 
 some of the packages will only work in GUI mode... at least i'm pretty sure.
 
 I could use a VM. That is my backup plan. But I'm hoping to avoid that.
  
My troubleshooting so far: 
  
using the built in debugger: 
 setting the debugger to trigger with (package-list-packages) via M-x debug-on-entry only results in an immediate lockup
 
 eww on MINGW64 also hangs in MINGW64 but not in the MSYS version. 
 No eww isn't one of those tools I need, I'm just using it for troubleshooting purposes.
 
 I don't have access to the firewall logs of the host (windows 10). I also can't turn it off.
 emacs messages buffer doesn't provide anything.
 google searches haven't yielded anything useful (that I can understand)
  
How:
  
i dunno.
  
Who:
  
Probably a user error or oversight on my part.
  
I think that's it. I appreciate if anyone read this far. I'm open to suggestions but understand if this is one of those mysteries that will never be solved.
 Thanks in advance and have a great day.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just spreading the word about a(nother) great post by Mickey Petersen: https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/securely-generating-totp-tokens-emacs
 It is not a new post, but I received today an email from GitHub which caught me off-guard, stating that my account would require 2FA from now on. And I really hate to tie any workflow of mine to the phone. I recalled having read something about it, and some searching brought me back to Mickey's post. Jackpot! Emacs to the rescue, with Mickey's help.
 I ended up doing things a little differently, since my setup is not the same. I store my passwords in a .gpg file, and wanted to retrieve the totp key from there, instead of from auth sources. And I also preferred to use oathtool for the main task, instead of the adapted version of Jürgen Hötzel's `totp.el'. Which, as a bonus, spared me of handling the base32 decoding.
 But Mickey's post was really useful in showing an alternative and laying the ground work. You may find it useful too, since you are likely to have received or to soon receive the same GitHub message (if you didn't already had 2FA set up).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Greetings everyone, 
 I hope you are doing well and good, so recently I decided to use the Xmonad window manager. I did so using GHCup and via cabal-install. I said yes to all the options afterwards so installed stack as well as Haskell language server. 
 However I now actually want to learn the language, There is so much stuff online however that it's now confusing me. 
 Can someone please guide me, help me build a small road map perhaps as to how to begin. Also I am confused because someone's using stack , someones using cabal and people suggesting stack but others saying stack is used for big projects ....I am lost guys, any help would be appreciated. 
 Thank you so much,
 Best Wishes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Independend of all other such requirements and approaches. I started my own little experiment of reassigning shortcuts, to what is known in most editors and IDE's. Only did it in my .emacs file.
 It is about the known shortcuts like: Ctrl+C = copy, Ctrl+S = save, Ctrl+Z = undo, Ctrl+Q = quit, and 30 more of these.
 It is a work in progress (it is working well but has still has lots of ToDo's), but I would love to get some feedback about it. (and if the feedback is: "completly unnassasary, becase there is something better", that is okay as well)
 I like how I combined Ctrl-c for coping in transient-mark-mode with Ctrl-c keping it's original functionality when nothing is selected. (At least I like the way it works, the elisp-code was just the best I could do).

 Emacs 29's alpha-background frame parameter provides some more options to do this, and I was wondering if anyone had other suggestions. One complication is that most people use a white background for their slides, but Zoom will also letterbox or pillarbox it into something with a black background.
 The best thing I've found so far is to set some theme with a black background and white text (I'm open to suggestion on themes for this purpose) and then
 (set-frame-parameter nil 'alpha-background 20) (set-frame-parameter nil 'alpha 60) 
 This seems to have some balance between being able to see the Emacs frame at all and the Emacs frame not obstructing a text-heavy presentation. But if anyone else has tried something else that works, I would love suggestions!

The "DONE" line along with the contents appears gray and has a strike out because of the lisp code below. But the "CLOSED:" line and tags are still bright green. How do I change those based on the done state? Thank you.

 However, the professor added a Tests.hs file that imports Test.HUnit so we can run and confirm the functions we implemented are correct, at least in a simple form.
 The issue is I’m lost on how to actually run the tests. “ghci :l Tests.hs” gives an import error for Test.HUnit. When looking up the package it mentions “runTestTT” but that just says there is no variable call that so I’m sure I’m running it incorrectly.
 There is also a cabal file that lists HUnit as a dependency. 
 How do I go about getting HUnit working? Thanks for the help!

4. Ask for selection


5. Create Summaries:


6. Generate Descriptive Titles:



Step 4: Requesting Specific Information
Step 5: Summarizing and Concluding

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi friends, I do hope my message finds you all well. I recently started learning emacs (with doom emacs) and I'm pretty happy with my setup right now. However, my current daily driver is a low-end laptop, and I wonder what's the best practice to start emacs so it won't load a ton of packages to just edit a 1-2 files. I built emacs29 from source, with native compilation, I'm also lazy loading most of my packages, which are just a few, but I wonder if running `emacs` instead of `emacs -nw` or `emacsclient` , might be affecting my starting up time and cpu/mem consumption. 
 The later implies that I should start the `emacs daemon` on startup? What's the difference between the options I mentioned above? I would appreaciate any suggestion. Thank you in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Many tasks are -- or at least, eventually end up being -- multi-"visit" affairs. In other words, the work may end up being done as several sessions in a single day, or even across multiple days. Either way, it can be useful to log what was done at each "visit". I've tried a couple of methods, in particular with a view to being able to produce some kind of time-filtered status report, perhaps via a clock table (cf. this question) :
  
Use org-add-note (C-c C-z) to add a timestamped note to the task, in the same way that state change notes get added. That's nice and quick in terms of adding the info, but I've never been able to find a way of getting that into any kind of time-filtered report, 
 Create a sub-headline for each "visit" -- usually using org-capture with a C-0 prefix. I'll clock into and then out of that and that means a clock table can pick up the sub-headline to use as my note of progress for that visit. It's tolerable, but it still restricts that progress note to just a headline, and I 'll often want to say more than that. 
  
How do others log progress in tasks? Do many use org-add-note?

 org-timeblock: Multi-day views
 org-timeblock is a new Emacs package that allows you to view and manage your orgmode tasks/events using timeblocking technique, which is implemented in almost all modern calendars.
 org-timeblock is interactive: you can navigate between blocks via mouse or arrow buttons; and then reschedule them or change TODO state. 
 Here's a quick video demonstration: org-timeblock: Multi-day views

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently installed emacs 29.1 in fedora 38 using snap. Specifically using that link https://snapcraft.io/install/emacs/fedora 
 But emacs has this "twitchy" behavior where it goes "back" for a brief moment and returns to the current "state". Let me give me example to illustrate the behavior better: Suppose I am the beginning of a line of text, then I run `C-k` to delete it. The line is deleted, then it shows up again for a brief moment, and then not anymore. Just to clarify, let me add the sequence of events:
  
(line present) Displays line
 (deteles line) `C-k`
 (line deleted) No display line
 (line deleted) Displays line for a brief moment
 (line deleted) No display line
  
This behavior happens with basically everything, meaning the new "state" (a word is typed, a buffer is switched, etc) is displayed and then momentarily goes back to the previous "state" (when the word had been typed, etc).
 My problem felt similar to this https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/112uuse/emacs_29060_is_bit_jumpy_scrolling_when_using/ but it isn't because I emptied my `init.el` and the problem still persists. Also, when I run `emacs -nw` in the terminal, then there is no problem. So, it is something with the rendering, but I have no idea how to even tackle this. Any help/guidance is appreciated.

But sadly after I pulled the change down to my mac connected to very ultra-wide monitor emacs starts up far to the left and half off screen. (I had previously hacked it with some default-frame-alist stuff that was only good for one box).
 TL;DR: desktop saving code below worked great on single monitor laptop, but chokes when second monitor is ultrawide much bigger than laptop screen.
 Here's the code snippet:
 #+begin_src emacs-lisp
 (use-package emacs
 :custom
 (desktop-path '("~/.emacs.d/var/desktop"))
 (desktop-save t)
 :init
 (defun rgr/restore-desktop()
 (when (fboundp 'alert)
 (alert (message (format "loading desktop from %s" desktop-path))))
 ;;I include the run-with-timer despite being able to get this to work without as it's a timing
 ;;issue and a little delay does no one any harm
 (run-at-time "1" nil (lambda()
 (desktop-read)
 (desktop-save-mode 1))))
 (add-hook 'emacs-startup-hook
 (lambda()
 (if (daemonp)
 (add-hook 'server-after-make-frame-hook 'rgr/restore-desktop)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I just started building a project that ends up as a CLI app. I have been working with Scala for a long time and I thought I can continue with it. While I have heard of Graal VM for a long time, this is the first time I'll be using it. So far, I've been running into some weird build failure intermittently on Ubuntu. Whereas Windows/MacOS builds work fine. I'll be using the Typelevel stack.
 While I'm continuing with my experiments at the moment, I was wondering if anyone here has any experience building with scala + graal. I'm also wondering if I'm better off with golang (hate the lang) or Rust (won't be super productive for a while for me)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello guys. I've been using (neo)vim for 1-2 years now. I use emacs for note-taking only (rarely)
 The reason I use emacs much less than neovim is the simplicity (of lua) and performance.
 I find neovim REALLY fast while It's obvious that emacs is less performant.
 Point of this post is: (as a non-power emacs user) 
 How'd you compare lua vs elisp
 How'd you compare emacs with a "well configured" neovim (in context of lua what is the difference between elisp? [except the power of GUI])
 - There are lot of plugins that will "keep you in neovim" (~~living~~) like plugins that integrate with web (e.g godbolt, stackoverflow etc.)
 - I am no near being a emacs power-user nor a GUI guy
 Why should I use emacs?
 Why not neovim
 ​
 > I think Neovim can "almost" be powerful as emacs (while keeping the performance [0])
 > Is it correct?
 > [HERE IS LINK TO MY CONFIG [WIP] IN NEOVIM](https://github.com/UTFeight/CamelVim) -> there is a feature list in README (outdated)
 > [HERE IS MY EMACS CONFIG](https://github.com/UTFeight/dot-doom) -> Simple doomemacs with org-mode

 [0] -> Thanks to plugins like `Lazy.nvim` and lua

 Is there any way to automatically generate web UI form from openAPI spec or Haskell types ? 
 I've tried with https://github.com/rjsf-team/react-jsonschema-form ,but the performance is poor when dealing with deep nested form with many inputs.

 I am emacs noob so forgive me if this is a dumb question.
 I have FlyMake running for java as shown in the screenshot. Is there any way that FlyMake shows how to fix error suggestions or is that simply not a feature of FlyMake? Like in the screenshot example, I want FlyMake to make the suggestion to import java.util.Scanner since I am using a scanner, not just simply tell me that there's some error because it can't find a Scanner object, that kind of stuff.

To me the next step is to make a small project to i) get some real world experience of writing something complete/useful in Haskell, getting to know some libraries beside prelude ii) showcase to eventual employer that I have a basic understanding of Haskell. I'm wondering if some of you went through this or had some suggestions for that kind of project (bonus point if it resonates with some real use case of Haskell, and is not a generic portfolio project that I would do with any other language). Thank!

My name is Kostas and I am 42 years old, having a wonderful family and for the last 20 years I have worked as a computer system and network engineer.
Two years ago I was hired by an international company and changed my career path, so I am currently working as DevOps. After this change, I noticed that I had some knowledge gaps I wanted to fill and some skills I wanted to improve.
I read technical documentation and watch online courses or webinars about technologies that were not my area of expertise, practices that are mostly in the software engineering world, new network or security concepts, and other stuff related to the so called "soft skills", such as How to Write Technical Documentation, How to become Persuasive, Give successful presentation, foreign languages. And on top of that I have lots of family concerns such as, family psychology, recurring tasks, hobbies and other.
For all the above, my brain cannot keep everything and thus the search some months ago brought me in front of some new to me methods, like zettelkasten, BASB, How to Take Smart Notes and lots of software. But to be honest, I haven't found my own workflow yet, what system to follow and what software to combine. I hope "building-a-second-brain-and-zettelkasten" will be something I could use for tasks and knowledge, but we'll see 
I read so many great forum posts here and shared workflows, I watch your great videos in youtube and I try to adjust my workflow when I see something that could make it better.
I'm glad that I join zettelkasten.de forums]]></summary>

 I'm glad to post whatever config seems relevant. Might this be an odd interaction with olivetti mode, org-indent mode, and visual line mode? Any hunches as to what variables I can tweak to fix it?
 All ideas would be very much appreciated!

 First, the problem description: As part of my 29.1 overhaul of my configuration I decided to add the pdf-tools package. I based my use-package block almost verbatim off of Sophie Bosio's configuration. This has the advantage of delaying the install of the package until you first load a PDF. But upon opening a PDF, the installation failed when trying to build the epdfinfo server utility.

 I wanted to gather some pointers and or critique from the community.

 Yesterday I thought I'd see if I could fix this. So started with trimming my setup down to the bare minimimum
 ``` (use-package magit :custom (magit-display-buffer-function #'magit-display-buffer-traditional))
 (use-package forge :after magit) ```
 and found that to be working well, i.e. I didn't have to manually "start" forge by running e.g. forge-pull. I then re-introduced my setup piece by piece to see when it breaks. (Luckily it's not very big.)
 In the end I made this change, where the relevant bit is this:
  (use-package forge :after magit - :general + :config (mes/despot-def forge-post-mode-map "c" '("submit" . forge-post-submit) 
 That is, I swapped the use of :general to :config when bringing in forge. (I'm still using :general when setting up magit as using :configresulted in keybindings going missing.)
 I can't pretend I know what's going on here, but my gut tells me there's some "interesting" interaction between straight.el, general.el going on.
 I'd love an explanation, but I'll be happy enough if this post will reduce someone else's head scratching when observing something similar.

 When I started college, I needed to create my school schedules mostly from scratch (selecting individual classes and checking that my classes didn't overlap). Unfortunately, doing it manually is very tiring, slow and prone to error. 
 So I thought: why not automate it? this is the result of that experiment. Ofc, this is a haskell sub, so obviously it is written in haskell. I'd appreciate very much if someone more experienced than me wants to take a look at the code for some feedback! :)
 Basically schedule-maker works by creating a yaml file with the specification of the classes you might consider taking. Then run schedule-maker classes.yaml and it will spit out a schedules.xlsx file with a valid schedule per worksheet.
 There are a some more features. For more information the rep…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to offload multi-line templates in my org-config to files to make formatting both the template and my config simpler. However I'm running into type issues.
 Excerpt:
 (defvar my/org-capture-templates-dir "~/org/templates/org-capture" "Directory for \\='org-capture\\=' template files.") (defun org-journal-find-location () "Open today's journal. Specify a non-nil prefix to inhibit inserting the heading" (org-journal-new-entry t) (goto-char (point-min))) (setq org-capture-templates '(("j" "Journal Capture Group") ("jd" "Daily Goals" entry (function org-journal-find-location) (file (concat my/org-capture-templates-dir "daily-goals.org")) :empty-lines 1) ("jj" "Journal" entry (function org-journal-find-location) "* %(format-time-string org-journal-time-format)%^{Title}\n%i%?"))) 
 Problem: When I try to invoke the template with 'C-c c j d' I get:
 org-capture: Wrong type argument: stringp, (concat my/org-capture-templates-dir "/daily-goals.org") 
 I can use 'C-c c j j' perfectly fine to append a new entry in my Journal file.
 I can get it to work as desired if I instead replace the concat with the string I expect to get like so:
 (setq org-capture-templates '(("j" "Journal Capture Group") ("jd" "Daily Goals" entry (function org-journal-find-location) (file "~/org/templates/org-capture/daily-goals.org") :empty-lines 1))) 
 Question: There's something I'm not understanding about how to use the output of the concat function as a string for a filename here. I'd prefer not to type the full file name every time, especially as I define more templates. How can I get the concat to work?
 ​
 For reference, the template 'daily-goals.org' contents are:
 * %(format-time-string org-journal-time-format)Daily Goals Today I plan to: 1. %^{goal-one} 2. %^{goal-two} 3. %^{goal-three} %? 
 Also, my full capture config can be found here: paraparity configuration.org. I'll always welcome feedback on my config and how I can terse up some of my emacs lisp.

 Depending on the things one wants to evaluate, it could be very useful like calls to (text-property-search-forward) for instance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For ages I have tried and failed to come up with an Org mode approach to answering the eternal question we often ask ourselves:
  
What (TF!) did I work on this week?
  
Or, more to the point, I want to get Org mode to answer the following question, often asked of us by our managers:
  
What did you work on this week?
  
In other words, I'd like to get Org mode to generate a share-able report that:
  
Draws from some pre-defined subset of all my org files. For example: all files in org-agenda-files plus whatever is in org-agenda-text-search-extra-files
 Includes any given headline (from the above files) if and only if it has a clock entry in a specified period -- last week, two months ago, etc
 Lists the headlines in chronological order (ascending, or user-selectable)
 Displays the headline itself, plus the relevant clock entry and associated text (i.e. it's not just an clock table)
 Is exportable using org-export-dispatch << This is important because the report is for more than just my own benefit. So, a mere dynamic view within emacs is not sufficient. I need to be able to produce a PDF, or HTML, or the like.
 Can do all this based only on the data and meta-data in the headlines themselves. That is, it should achieve my desired data output format without enforcing on me a data storage format. I'm adding this requirement because my (partial) solution to the problem so far has been to store my daily notes in a datetree format (fed by org-capture), which encodes information not just with a heading's data and meta-data but also in its position. But that is neither a complete solution, nor a good one even where it does go part way.
  
How would/do you achieve this or something like it?[1]
 thx!
 [1] Ideally, using Org out-of-the-box, without having to write a bunch of lisp. But, failing that, I'd take pointers to lisp approaches. (TBH, I'd take the lisp itself, if you had it, but that would be above and beyond the call on your part! :-) )

 I've been out of the Scala scene for a couple of years, and looking to find employment in my fav language again. What's changed?
 Essentially, what I'm wondering is whether it's worth it professionally to double-down on Scala in '23, if what I want to do is FP, DSLs or, at the very least, core-Scala, and not Spark?
  
What are the trends for industry adoption, besides Spark?
 
Is Spark still "the killer app"? (I've done some Spark, can't say I liked it)
 
Is Scala 3 gaining traction in industry?
 
Are Cats/ZIO gaining traction, becoming more niche, and have the culture wars finally stopped?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello friends, I'm getting the following error when I'm installing xmonad with stack. I'm using this custom GHC version that's compiled with musl libc.
 configure: error: X11/extensions/Xrandr.h (from libXrandr) is required 
 Which makes sense, so I installed libXrandr from my distribution's package manager (Gentoo). But unlike the many other times I have installed XMonad on a glibc system, this time installing libXrandr did not get the error to go away.
 I additionally installed libXinerama through my package manager but the output also complained that it does not find it, but it's not required like Xrandr is so it's not a big deal.
 I run the following command as indicated by the page of the custom GHC build.
 stack install --ghc-options ' -static -optl-static -optl-pthread -fPIC' --docker --docker-image "utdemir/ghc-musl:v25-ghc944" --no-nix 
 My stack.yaml contains the following:
 resolver: ghc-9.4.4 packages: xmonad-git xmonad-contrib-git extra-deps: 'random-1.2.1' 'X11-1.10.3' 'data-default-class-0.1.2.0' 'setlocale-1.0.0.10' 'X11-xft-0.3.4' 'utf8-string-1.0.2' 'splitmix-0.1.0.4' 
 I'd imagine it has do to with GHC being a docker image but I can't be too sure.The issue is that despite installing the required dependency which would normally fix this trivial error,stack does not recognize that it has been installed.
 Please keep in mind that I'm in no way knowledgeable in anything Haskell related. Feel free to ask for any output or information.
 Any hints towards the right directions are greatly appreciated. Cheers!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey there, fellas! Beginner haskeller here. I've come across an interesting problem when configuring Vim surprisingly.
 Description. Given several lists ordered by priority, I want to gather unique elements from them. There needs to be at most n elements overall. For each list there is its own limit k of elements I want to take from it. Only the elements that are actually taken (so, overall unique) come towards filling the limits. I attached some test cases in a separate file in case you want to give it a shot by yourself first.
 I decided to give it a go using Haskell as it is pretty abstract and I couldn't come up with anything elegant using Python.
 The imperative version seems pretty straightforward, although I haven't programmed it.
 Here's my solution: https://gist.github.com/EgZvor/12268b0d439bd916c693c38b1fd853c8 . I can't help but think it can be simpler, so as to improve readability of a hypothetical imperative version.

 Maybe this question is better suited for /haskellquestions but can you point out what is making this code so slow? (Taking more than 10 seconds before I aborted it) It is fast until r = 10, b = 10. Writing the equivalent in C++ has allowed me to compute r = 100, b = 100 in a flash. Something is up. It is a simple memoization task

 The current implementation uses SVG to display Sixel image (and UTF-8 half block character when Emacs is itself running inside a terminal). Is there any other image format that is faster in Emacs?
 If you don't know what Eat is, Eat (Emulate A Terminal) is a reasonably fast pure Emacs Lisp terminal emulator for Emacs. In addition to other things, it features better keybindings, shell integration, mouse support, and now, Sixel support.
 And by the way, I was thinking about a talk about Eat at EmacsConf. What do you think?

 mac-tab-desktop is a tiny package that enables saving/restoring the native Mac tab configuration with desktop.el. Simply turn it on and it just works like you'd expect. It can also be used for other tools that manipulate "framesets".

 In my current emacs 29.1 setup I have frame titles setup "dynamically" by setting:
  
(setq-default frame-title-format "%b - Emacs")
  
This works well for the first frame created but every other frame created with C-X 5 2 or emacsclient have a title set to initial buffer file name, it seems. 
 Am I missing something or have I come across a bug?
 EDIT: I should probably add that I run a PGTK build under swaywm.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've had a quick once over of the book & decided it's time to tackle it. I am planning on following along in Scala 3 as I figured while it might add an additional challenge, I should gain insights about either version of Scala in the process through contrast. Maybe flawed logic, we will see.
 From my limited experience, the main 4 differences I've picked are;
 Ember instead of Blaze when using HTTP4s,
 Opaque types / Iron rather than @ newtype / Refined
 Givens instead of Implicits
 Some difference when using Circe.
 Are there any other gotchas I should be aware of before I get cracking?
 Will this detour be beneficial for my growth or will it hinder my progress?
 It will not be the end of the world if I have to pivot but It'd nice not to have too many nasty suprises.
 Additionally if there are any other resources I should be aware of that would supplement the read well I'm all ears.
 Currently have;
 Red Book,
 Scala with Cats, &
 Programming in Scala 5th ed. for reference.
 Still slowly getting to grips with Cats (essential effects would be nice) but figured I would learn by example & reference with Cats.

 I have the ~/.authinfo.gpg file in my home directory, and I can encrypt/decrypt the file correctly.
 When using auth info, if the info is already in the .authinfo.gpg file, emacs will ask me to unlock my gpg key, then it can use the auth info correctly.
 But if the auth info is not in the .authinfo.gpg file, it will prompt me to save it into the .authinfo file, and the content is not encrypted.
 Any idea why auth info can automatically read from .authinfo.gpg, but cannot save to it?

 I know that network effects are hard to overcome and that some of you don't particularly care about the issues with Reddit management, or don't make "fighting against Social Media and Big Tech" a hill to die on, but I strongly feel like the time for centralized social platforms has passed. We gave away too many of our freedoms in exchange of convenience, but now the costs are too much to ignore.
 You might have received already a DM from me inviting you to join our Emacs community on Lemmy. It's slowly but steadily getting traction and activity, to the point that you might have even seen it mentioned at Sacha's blog.
 Over there, one of the things that we are still missing is content from people with questions, or small tips/tricks to share. I was thinking of automating some of this work I've been doing and I started working on a small bot that could post a comment on every "self" post asking the OP to also take a look at the alternatives. 
 The question is: would that be ok with the mods and the community here? If a bot posting on every comment is too much I can maybe make a rule for limiting to 2-3 submissions a day, but more than anything I would like to know if the community at large would consider this alternative or if most are actively in favor of sticking to reddit.

 "The influence of Scheme on Lua has gradually increased during Lua’s evolution: initially, Scheme was just a language in the background, but later it became increasingly important as a source of inspiration, especially with the introduction of anonymous functions and full lexical scoping" 
 https://www.lua.org/doc/hopl.pdf
 Neovim -- I understand this to be the hot new thing in the vim world [1], correct me if I'm wrong -- uses luascript too. Emacs has the evil-mode of fame (amongst other modal editing packages). This whimsical post is just me pontificating on how all's well that ends well in regards to the editor wars of old that I was too young to experience firsthand. 
 Only took a couple of decades lol. I am curious though, regardless of emacs or vi keybindings, I believe it common to use 'ctrl' more than 'alt' so I've swapped them. Anatomically speaking, our thumbs are stronger digits than pinkies. Am I right in assuming that's the reason so many of the venerable default bindings are on 'ctrl'?
 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-cadet_keyboard
 How many years before this accident of history is undone, lisp machines become mainstream and we eradicate the dreaded 'emacs pinkie' like humanity has done to smallpox? Rhetorical question, you can tell I've too much spare time on my hands. 
 Emacs > Vim ;)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Emacs for Android got a really awesome feature that allows to access files in SAF document providers.
 SAF document providers are the closest things to FUSE that Android can offer. NextCloud implements a document provider, giving its users the ability to keep local copies of cloud files transparently, keep placeholders of online-only files, offer bidirectional sync.
 However, as the Emacs manual states, document providers are kinda limited:
  
Subprocesses can't access files in the document provider (this means no shell commands)
 No symlinks are allowed
  
This is kind of a deal breaker: simple editing of Org files could still be feasible, but anything slightly more advanced might not. Using nov.el, for example, is not feasible since it require extracting with the tar command.
 A solution is to simply copy files outside the /content/storage/ (document providers directory) before opening them in a buffer. However doing so manually is stressful and not tidy at all. Is there a way to transparently copy files in a temporary location before opening them, and automatically update the source file when needed?
 What could be other ways to make document providers more practical to use?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lets assume I have a function f that performs two different actions depending on whether it is called for the first time or not.
 How could I achieve this? Should I use the state monad, which I didn’t really understood yet?
 My actual problem is a graphical application with a save button, which has to open a file dialog when clicked for the first time, because we do not have a file name yet. But if we have already created a file it should just overwrite the file.
 So what would I need to do with this example function in order to let it handle the state.
 onButtonClick :: ByteString -> IO () onButtonClick text = do state <- checkState case state of Nothing -> do file <- fileDialogSave writeToFile text file Just file -> writeToFile text file 
 In my case this function needs to have an `IO ()`, I guess, as I am using GTK and this is how it gets invoked.
 https://hackage.haskell.org/package/gi-gtk-4.0.8/docs/GI-Gtk-Objects-Button.html#v:onButtonClicked
 I know there is a lot of material about the state monad, but I can’t really see how to use it in my case
 Solution: 
 I was thinking to complicated as the solution is fairly simple as /u/AshleyYakeley pointed out.
 I Just need to create an IORef FilePath with:
 fileRef <- newIORef "" 
 and pass it to the function:
 onButtonClick :: IORef FilePath -> ByteString -> IO () onButtonClick fileRef text = do filePath <- readIORef fileRef case filePath of "" -> do file <- fileDialogSave writeToFile text file writeIORef fileRef $ getPath file file -> writeToFile text file

They all have the name *emacs*<NN> or *emacs:err*<NN>, with NN being a number. I have no idea what purpose they are supposed to fulfill, but at some point, they become so many that it blocks other operations in Emacs ("too many open files" error), and I need to restart Emacs to get rid of them. 
 Any suggestions how to troubleshoot it and figure out how to avoid this happening?

 The way it works at the moment it pops up results in the minibuffer and vanishes when you visit a match.

 Maybe I should experiment with PureScript and Halogen? But maybe there‘s a Haskell alternative? Re-using code with the „isomorphic“ approach of Miso seems to be very interesting, but I know almost nothing about it. It uses GHCJS, is this still state of the art now that the JS backend of GHC is out?
 I‘d like to share Haskell code, but I also would love to have a smooth developing experience and overall elegant declarative code. Any suggestions for me?

 "Server rust-analyzer:1412060/starteing existed with status exit(check corrosponding stderr buffer for details). Do you want to restart it? (y or n)" 
 If I respond in the affirmative the question just pops up again. So obviously the language server has failed to load.
 If I do 'M-x lsp-install-server" I am not presented with options. 
 How do I get a language server to run with lsp in rust mode?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I read this article - Free Monad in Scala, and its video, where it implements FlatMap with natural transformation. My question: if I want to implement a generic version of Free Monad (it's generic enough a little bit like ZIO, Cats but it doesn't need to be production grade), is this the right direction?
 I have this question because I want to play with this concept by implementing it myself. Then I started to search online, finding an explanation like this. I understand the point (though not thoroughly understand everything regarding this term I suppose); however, when checking the examples on the internet, most of them use `List[A] => Option[A]`, or tap in Cats.FunctionK. I am confused generally how it's implemented. Is the example in the video is good enough, or some other implementations are recommended as references?
 Many thanks for answering my elementary school level question.

 If I create a new entry and use org-gcal-post-at-point it creates a new calendar entry on google calendar. I then change the name of the entry in the org file and then use org-gcal-sync it updates correctly in google calendar as well.
 But on entries that already existed in the calendar before the original fetch, I can push them to with org-gcal-post-at-point to update the title. But org-gcal-sync never work.
 I would expect org-gcal-sync to make google calendar match the org file. Am I misunderstanding how org-gcal works or is this a bug?

 My implementation is not sophisticated but it works on transmission in the directions of local-to-local, local-to-remote, remote-to-local and remote-to-remote. However, it's not working on multi-hop SSH connections.

I have installed `ruff` (yet) another python linter and set this variable to `("ruff" "--quiet" "--stdin-filename=stdin" "-")` but flymake does not report any errors when enabled in a python buffer. I'm aware of the `flymake-ruff` package but was wondering if setting this variable would mean I didn't need that package. Thanks for your time.
 Edit: I found this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/10yzhmn/flymake_just_works_with_ruff/) and saw how to correctly set this variable but still no joy. I'm still on Emacs 27.1 if that matters but the latest flymake.

 I want to learn Scala as my second FP language. I know Haskell and I am somewhere between an Apprentice & Journeyman. In the sense that I can read and understand Haskell code, and write trivial programs and rest services. I am quite familiar with Haskell Transformers and general FP style of programming.
 With this background, I was looking to dive into Scala and learn the language for fun (& maybe profit). Programming in Scala seems to be the authoritative book for this. I have two questions.
  
Is it a good choice for someone who knows Haskell and general FP principals?
 If yes, should I go for the 4th edition which is for Scala 2 or the 5th edition which is for Scala 3?
  
​
 TIA!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In some of the projects I work with, there might be 25+ imports at the beginning of a file and I almost never need to look at them. On the other hand, I almost never use code folding, and my config already has so many packages in it that I wondered if I could hide those imports using only built-in functionality. Surprisingly, hideshow.el apparently doesn't have this functionality built in, so I took a crack at making it happen.
 After some fiddling, I came up with this: 
 (defun rex/php-fold-use-block-initially () "Hide the initial block of `use' statements in PHP buffers." (interactive) (save-excursion (goto-char (point-min)) (ignore-errors (re-search-forward "^use ")) (set-mark (point)) (while (ignore-errors (re-search-forward "^use "))) (ignore-errors (hs-hide-comment-region (region-beginning) (region-end))) (deactivate-mark t))) (add-hook 'php-mode-hook hs-minor-mode) (add-hook 'php-mode-hook rex/php-fold-use-block-initially) 
 This does what I want, but it's not elegant and it seems pretty fragile (then again, it hasn't broken yet and I've been using it for a couple of days now). Because it does work, I figured it might help someone else too if I shared it, ymmv. 
 EDIT: In order to hide import/include/whatever keyword your language uses to include code from libraries or elsewhere, you would need to change the regex pattern "^use " to "^include " (for instance) and add the appropriate mode hooks. 
 P.S. Now that I think of it, this function should actually be generalized to accept the pattern as an argument...

 Edit: Based on comments C-s means control+super. I checked and there is nothing wrong with my keyboard. Does anyone know why emacs would register this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This might be a dumb question. I read through the manual and was confused regarding properties and tags. What I want to do is something like this:
 :PROPERTIES table: #+attr_odt: :style tablestyle #+attr_latex: :environment longtable :END: 
 then later i want to be able to tag a header with that property label so that it inherits all of those attributes:
 * I'm going to put tables here :table: | hello | my | table | | is | here | hello 
 Is creating a group of attributes possible in org mode? 
 edit: i've found that I can achieve this with macros. Still curious if there's a way to group a bunch of attributes in a non-macro way

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm using the latest git version with pgtk and native comp and I'm noticing a bit of lag when I just move my cursor through a file. I profiled it and it was pointing at a function called redisplay_internal taking up almost all of the usage, but when I expanded it the sub-functions didn't take up as much as redisplay_internal. Emacs -Q causes the redisplay_internal usage to drop considerably and the lag to go away. I'm wondering if anyone has had this issue or if not how I could go about further dissecting what is going on since profiling didn't lead me in the right direction.
 I have a sneaking suspicion doom modeline may be part of the issue since one of its functions has come up in the many profiling runs I've done. Disabling it seemed to help briefly, but redisplay_internal tends to stay higher than the emacs -Q profiling(in that it is lower than running M-x commands in cpu usage).
 EDIT: After singling out parts of my config it seems that doom-modeline is indeed the culprit. Any recommendations for a replacement that looks just as nice?

 The most important thing is that it's purely locally stored, even the file management system is just like Emacs. By adding locations, you can use any cloud service you like, such as iCloud, Dropbox, WebDAV. You can also collaborate with ease and enhance your workflow by connecting Metanote with the tools you love.
 If you're used to version controlling and syncing your documents using Git in Emacs, just like me, you can achieve the same functionality with Metanote. Follow thes…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On my journey through the lands of Haskell and GTK4, I once again encountered a problem I am not able to solve for myself, so I again hope for your help:
 I created a Gtk.DropDown from a list of text with Gtk.dropDownNewFromStrings ["1","2"] and now I would like to retrieve its selected value:
 dropdown <- Gtk.dropDownNewFromStrings ["1","2"] -- :: Gtk.DropDown selection <- dropdown.getSelectedItem -- :: GOb.Objects.Object.Object 
 Now the type of selection is GI.GObject.Objects.Object.Object, although actually it is a Gtk.StringList (See: https://discourse.gnome.org/t/get-string-value-from-dropdown-in-gtk4/7911/2)
 If the compiler knew it was a StringList I could do:
 string <- selection.getString 
 But that raises an error of course, because not every GObject has this method.
 I tried to use Gtk.toStringList but that gives me the same error.
 Do you have any idea how to convince GHC that my selection is in fact a StringList and let me retrieve its value?
 Update:
 I found this function which might do what I want:
 Gtk.castTo :: (GHC.Stack.Types.HasCallStack, ManagedPtrNewtype o, TypedObject o, ManagedPtrNewtype o', TypedObject o') => (ManagedPtr o' -> o') -> o -> IO o' 
 And now it works:
 strObj <- Gtk.castTo Gtk.StringObject selection -- :: Maybe StringObject 
 Please down vote or tell me if I should delete this post.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi community,
 I am a novice of Emacs and I am trying to config .emacs from scratch. Right now I configure a dozen of packages. I am a emacsclient user: I run emacs --fg-daemon with systemd user session and connect to emacs server through emacsclient (both GUI and TUI).
 The problem I am having now is: after running Emacs GUI client (v29.1 from Ubuntu 22.04 snap install) for a few hours, opening three dozons of buffers plus 1 LSP (gopls), I switched to Emacs client TUI. TUI hangs quickly (less than 1 sec) after connected to the server:
  
I see my active buffer of GUI in TUI for 0.5 sec => based on my understanding, this should not happen: a new client should not render the active buffer of another client
 Emacs TUI switched to scratch
 Emacs TUI stopped unresponsive
 Open another Emacs GUI client and this instance worked fine
  
What's the right way to debug this issue? Is there a way to dump the threads and stacks of the runtime? My hunch is LSP may be the problem. I hope to investigate before asking for more help.
 Thank you!

 The code is almost completely unchanged since prior versions, except for the addition of the obsoleting flag.
 The commit is here:
 https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/emacs.git/commit/etc/themes/light-blue-theme.el?h=emacs-29&id=72491495e7b4b574f04fd18902c61dca84dcbc1b
 The commit message says:
 Obsolete the light-blue theme * etc/themes/light-blue-theme.el (light-blue): Make theme obsolete since it's not maintained and seems to serve no particular use case (bug#47047).
 The code itself is here:
 https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/emacs.git/tree/etc/themes/light-blue-theme.el?h=emacs-29&id=72491495e7b4b574f04fd18902c61dca84dcbc1b
 The bug report was here, and frankly, I'm just not impressed that these couple of dudes decided it was okay to delete the theme because it was too hard to find a good face esp when they admitted they have absolutely no idea how many people use it.
 https://debbugs.gnu.org/cgi/bugreport.cgi?bug=47047
 I honestly don't need any sort of themes or styles to be uber awesome, I just want to be able to read the damn screen for hours at a time, and light-blue did that for me.
 Can anyone help me understand what their issue in there thread is, and suggest a better face?
 At any rate, how do I suppress the warning message when loading that specific theme?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 My after-init-hook settings work fine when using Emacs in normal mode. Recently, I wanted to run my emacs in server mode and create a frame using a client. But the frame starts with a different font.
 lisp (setq-default initial-frame-alist '((fullscreen . maximized)) indent-tabs-mode nil default-terminal-coding-system 'utf-8 select-active-regions nil) ) 
 I tried to move my font settings out of the initialization hook, but it makes no difference.
 I guess in server mode, emacs decide not to execute the font setting function because there's nothing to display. But is there a way to tell it to execute the font settings when creating a frame?
 Another issue is that the frame starts in the *scratch* buffer. Is there's way to make it start at the normal GNU welcome buffer?
 Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently decided to learn emacs and I was creating an `init.el` from scratch, but after adding eglot and corfu I found the auto-completion is super laggy. I'm testing it on a MacBook air m1 with 8G ram (I know, it's a potato computer), I also tried neovim and even vscode just for comparison, and emacs appears to be the only one that is laggy.
 I just like to know if it's normal, is it true that emacs requires more power to run?
 btw, I'm running emacs 29, I read some documents before starting to create `init.el`, and I know emacs has supported native compilation since 28, my understanding is it was enabled by default, correct me if I'm wrong, thank you folks!

 you can also change the date from the agenda view.
 Is there a way to change the time (say from 11:50 to 11:55) from the agenda view?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The code for this sucks, I know. But here's a tweak to my Emacs which I find so incredibly useful I want to share it with you. I call it "electric M-m". Essentially, it makes M-m skip more than just whitespace. So it skips the //, # and ;; at the start of code comments, and also skips the *** TODO [1/10] at the start of Org mode headers. So it skips up to the first bit of proper text. By adding things to skip-prefixes-alist, you can extend this easily to more modes. I've been using this for a few years now and I'm happy with how it works.
 Anyway, here's the code:
 (let ((c-like '("//+!?" "/?\\*+")) (lisp '(";+")) (org-header-regexp (rx bol (+ "*") (+ space) ;; I know this is a filthy way of doing the keywords but I just can't ;; be bothered to do it properly. (? (or "TODO" "NOW" "DONE" "D…]]></summary>

 I have gone though this tutorial, but it doesn't explain anything and doesn't show how to customise anything.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'd like to tell you about the new version of the dotty-cps-async.
 The most significant thing in this release is introducing a compiler plugin with experimental support of direct context encoding. 
 // The idea of a direct context encoding is briefly described in 
 https://rssh.github.io/dotty-cps-async/BasicUsage.html#direct-context-encoding-experimental 
 This brings into the Scala API possibility to use a direct style model, similar to the Kotlin suspended function approach.
 Connected change: automatic coloring is deprecated in favor of the upcoming direct context encoding.

 Any ideas how can I trace the problem?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am getting started on using Zettelkasten. Here is one of my zettels, the purpose here is to capture concepts in Indian philosophy and discover connections. I look forward to your critiques/feedback:
In Indian philosophy, light can be understood as both physical and metaphysical. 

Prakasha refers to manifested light. There are three types: 
* ordinary fire (_jada agni_), 
* sunlight (_saura agni_), 
* lightning (_vaidyuta agni_).

The original spiritual light is _jyoti_. 

How does physical light interface with the metaphysical?
* Physical light sustains life on Earth, for example, sunlight provides energy through photosynthesis. 
* [[Prometheus stole fire and was punished for giving power to humans]]
* Light enables creation, as consciousness is the first element required.  
* Light is involved in metaphysical visions too:
1._Krishna_ grants _Arjuna_ a glimpse of his effulgent divine form, which _Sanjay_ also perceives through inner sight. 
2. The _Nachiketa_ and _Yama_ story conveys spiritual light's ability to illuminate the knowledge of death and immortality.

 It seems that others have had this thought as well:

I have a similar problem with "I'm". These modifiers work fine in math mode, and typing e.g. "it's" is fine too.
 If I show the list of available modifiers by '?, t and m are both there, with blanks next to them, which I presume should mean (as the documentation suggests) that 't should just produce 't - or should it actually be showing something nonempty?

 Warning: I am a relative noob, so I might say something stupid.
 I am trying to use tree-sitter and eglot, and setup as emacs as my IDE for python. Specifically, the minimum features I'd like to have are:
  
Syntax and variable highlighting, e.g., if I am using a variable it doesn't exist anywhere, it should be highlighted, highlight functions with a color, etc.
 Completion of libraries, but also of variables, e.g., if the variable old_array exists, then I'd like to type `old` the hit tab (or something) and have emacs complete the rest.
 Also, something (like flymake) that highlights syntax errors

If flymake has some new update why can't you just get that updated at the same as the third party packages you have installed? Why do you have to either install a newer version of flymake from GNU Elpa or just wait for the new release of Emacs to access the newer version of flymake?

 So far, I've come across Bozhidar's[1] post, which has been quite helpful. What's currently bothering me the most are:
 1) Non-functioning keyboard shortcuts like "Super + arrows" for window manipulation. This is a known bug[2] across all WSLg applications due to the lack of support for this mechanism in non-native Windows' windows.
 2) The inability to open files in the Windows system using Emacs (WSL2). This is particularly frustrating for Org files, of which I have quite a few on my disk.
 3) Duplicate icon on the taskbar. I know it's a minor issue, but it's quite annoying. When I pin a shortcut for Emacs using "Pin to taskbar," then open Emacs using the shortcut, it doesn't "overlay" the pinned application. Instead, a new icon appears next to it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I want to import Yaml and keep the order but the module Data.Yaml uses the Data.Aeson.Keymap type which is unordered. i only need the top level key-map to be ordered.
 What would be a decent way to preserve the order of my yaml file? Should I parse it for a second time and restore to get the order of my keys or can you think of a better approach?
 Edit:
 A solution is to create a list from the same file using this unreadable line of Haskell code:
 let keys = map (fromText . Data.Text.init . decodeUtf8) . filter (not . isSpace . BS.head) . BS.lines $ content 
 where BS is my ByteString import. I can then later map over the keys list and lookup the yaml KeyMap in the right order.
 This solution feels a bit like a hack. So I wonder how you would solve this.
 Also, how would you make that huge line more readable?

 inline def recurser[T <: Tuple](inline t: T): List[String] = inline t match case _: EmptyTuple => Nil case t: (head *: tail) => val h = dispatcher(t.head) h :: recurser(t.tail) inline def dispatcher[T](inline t: T): String = inline t match case t: Product => val m = summonInline[Mirror.ProductOf[T & Product]] val tup = Tuple.fromProductTyped(t)(using m) recurser(tup).mkString("[", ", ", "]") case _ => t.toString 
 This compiles. However, calling dispatcher on a product type doesn't: 
 dispatcher(1) // works dispatcher(1, 2, 3) // doesn't :( 
 The compiler cannot perform the match in `recurser`: 
 cannot reduce inline match with scrutinee: tup : (tup : m.MirroredElemTypes) patterns : case _:EmptyTuple case t @ _:*:[head @ _, tail @ _] 
 Why is that? Everything seems precisely typed and inlined. Are there any workarounds? I know this particular example can be solved with givens, I'm exploring a given-less design space.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been thinking, and I'm suspecting that frameworks are a better idea than Simple / Boring Haskell for production. Why? Two reasons, first, frameworks simplify onboarding because you can now teach to the framework; the new programmer can be taught only the Haskell needed to operate the framework, and then "proper" Haskell later.
 ​
 We can do this already, but then you have to decide what dialect of Haskell you're aiming to (there are TONS of Simple Haskells in use), and then get annoyed when new hires with Haskell experience get annoyed that your dialect doesn't match their dialect.
 ​
 Second, I've compared a framework-centric approach to a keto-diet, in that it lets you cheat. Boring Haskell means to limit your use of language extensions to the absolutely "crucial", which Boring Hask…]]></summary>

 I suspect what I'm seeing is what's described in #285. However, the fix described there, to modify `markdown-code-face`,
  (custom-set-faces '(markdown-code-face ((t (:inherit default))))) 
 doesn't make any difference.
 My font settings are
  (set-face-attribute 'default nil :font "Iosevka" :height 110 :weight 'normal) (set-face-attribute 'fixed-pitch nil :font "Iosevka" :height 110 :weight 'normal) (set-face-attribute 'variable-pitch nil :font "Cantarell" :height 110 :weight 'regular) 
 Any suggestions what else to try?
 Could it be something related to my running a PGTK build?

Cognitive Extension
Cognitive Expression - Conversation
Cognitive Endurance
Ideas I'm thinking about:
I'm exploring using my structure notes as a thinking canvas.
How the effectiveness of a targeted review practice intersects with active cognition.
Humor
I think that THE key to zettelkasting is every zettel is a proxy for an idea, and the only thing that matters is zettel relatedness to other zettel. Discovery of the scaffolding of zettel relatedness is something that grows organically but can be nurtured as a gardener cares for her flowers, fruits, and veggies. Different strategies will tickle out the relatedness.
How to discover which zettel has the most pixie dust of magic at the moment. I'm getting further on my quest to weigh each zettel by measuring their use and connectivity.
The "My rolling ten-day zettel production" is produced by a script for attachment to my daily journaling template. I do my journaling in Bear to keep personal journaling separate from my knowledge work.

 Eli pushed changes aimed to fix at least one --maybe several-- scrolling bugs, and issued a general request for help testing. Especially, I think, from those with touchpads and heavily customized scrolling behavior.

 Relatedly, I've stepped up my own pipeline for building Windows binaries. For the moment, I (try to) build after basically any push to "release" or "development" branches. (Treesitter grammer DLLs are still refreshed manually when I think of it.)

 I recently (very recently) got hooked on Doom EMACS, and from all the videos I've watched I see how powerful it is. I mainly want to use the org mode, and I encounter four major difficulties :
  
I don't really know how to enter "Insert mode" in an ORG buffer, I just start typing random things until the cursor turns from a box to a line ;
 I don't know how to type special characters like = # = on a buffer, cause Im on Mac and I need to press ALT+3, and that's a keybinding to switch between workspaces;
 I can't really press TAB to show/hide content of headlines, all it does is it adds an extra tabulation (Demoting the headline) ;
 I don't know how to change the headline ticks.
  
Can someone please show me how to do all these things, cause Chat GPT is giving me some nonsense responses.

 I've recently embarked on my Haskell learning journey and have acquired the book "Effective Haskell". However, as I want to delve deeper, I feel like I'm missing some of the mathematical foundations upon which functional programming is based. I don't only want to know the HOW, but also the WHY.
 A bit about me: I'm currently in the 5th semester of Applied Computer Science, so I have a foundational understanding of mathematics. However, I'd like to bridge the gap between my current knowledge and what's required to truly grasp the concepts in Haskell.
 Could any of you recommend books or resources that elucidate the mathematical principles essential for Haskell? I'm particularly interested in materials that would fit well with someone at my academic stage and can help me connect the dots between math and functional programming.
 Thanks in advance for your suggestions!

Currently I just have a basic html and css file and it's still very minimal but I am wondering if I should incorporate something like php to be able to make blog posts in markdown or org mode rather.
 I do not have very much experience in web dev but am pretty decent in other back end and system languages and find php to be sorta similar to bash. Creating a blog from scratch kinda seems like the long route to a simple solution but it's more of a learning experience as well as having control over the skeletal structure and knowing whats behind everything. This will also give me control over the customization of the pages. Any help would be greatly appreciated thank you 
 EDIT: After a few responses and reading over a couple tutorials I've learned you can basically build your own blog directly in Emacs. No php required ;)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey there,
 So I'm in the process of figuring out how I can sync my phone notes to my local file server with Synching occasionally. Basically 'phonenotes.org' from one machine to another. That being noted, I have another file called notes.org on my file server that basically lists completed tasks under a following format:
 ```
 *COMPLETED TASKS 2023
 ** Week of 08-14-2023
 *** Date
 Completed task summary
 ```
 In my actual phone notes file, I have this for an example:
 ```
 Title: 08-15-2023
 Recorded music
 ```
 With this in mind, how do I facilitate the ability to routinely ingest any of the notes that are date based on the phone note title itself from Orgzly so that it automatically determines the Monday of the given week, creates a 'Week of (Starting Monday of that week)' subheading in the 'notes.org' file and slams that new note in there?
 Sorry if it sounds complicated but I do this manually all the time and I wanted an easier way to do this programatically with Org Mode.
 Thanks!

I have tried to follow this guide which uses org-cite and citar, and got it somewhat working by modifying their org-roam-node-from-cite function, but I couldn't get it working completely because there seems to have been some API changes in citar that broke the code as it is.
 I have also seen this guide using org-ref, but I would like to stick to the built-in org-cite if possible. Any help is appreciated, thanks!
 My current function modified from Kristoffer's guide: ``` ;; Create a new node from a bibliographic source. taken from ;; https://jethrokuan.github.io/org-roam-guide/ (defun org-roam-node-from-cite (keys-entries) (interactive (list (citar-select-refs :multiple nil))) (let ((title (citar-format--entry (cdr '(keys-entries nil)) "${author editor}${date urldate} :: ${title}"))) (org-roam-capture- :templates '(("r" "reference" plain "%?" :if-new (file+head "references/${citekey}.org" ":properties: :roam_refs: [cite:@${citekey}] :end:

I don't know whether it's the space in the command or something else, but all the online solution's I've tried don't seem to work. I get the result I want by typing "bash" at the prompt after it has logged in and is using sh. Any recommendations for how to use this on every server I log in to?

 I'm using emacs centaur which is using project (and not projectile).
 For a small hello project, I could solve a first issue of LSP folder path :
 How to remind lsp-workspace-folder (+ to be used by DAP) ? : emacs (reddit.com) 
 Now, I'm on project with several sub folders with their own compile_commands.json, .git ....
 There is also a compile_commands.json on root, the most important.
 I created an empty .project file on root to try to solve the problem. I thought it should be the same that for .projectile. 
 I do project-switch-project and choose directory on root.
 I select the file I need with compile_commands.json on root.
 The LSP folder workspace is starting with compile_commands.json on a sub folder ... 
 Even with .project + (setq lsp-auto-guess-root t) in custom-post.el + remove compile_commands.json of the sub-folder used + delete of sub-folder with lsp-workspace-folder-remove + add of root with with lsp-workspace-folders-add
 I still have the sub-folder selected for project and lsp-workspace-folder ... 
 Please, if you have advice to solve this issue to force to declare a project directory and not auto-detect the git project of the file selected ?

 After months of previous attempt on using DOOM Emacs, I'm trying to give Emacs a new try but this time with my own configuration and no Evil in the mix.
 I saw the fantastic news about the Emacs 29.1 major version, like having Eglot and Treesit built-in; so I decided to give it a try, but unfortunately no success :( 
 When I run the treesit-install-language-grammar I receive the following error.
  Warning (treesit): Error encountered when installing language grammar: (file-missing Setting current directory No such file or directory /tmp/treesit-workdir1YJ0sh/repo/src) 
 After checking the temporary folder I could find that is empty, seems like not even the git clone is executed.
 Anyone already faced this issue and was able to solve, or have any idea of what is happening.
 Thanks

 I just found out about this function to detangle from the source code to the main org file. However, I cannot do this in my configuration (doom-emacs), having an error message saying that 0 code blocks were detangled. I am using the `:comments link` option as well.
 When I tried launching emacs with -Q flag, it didn't find this function. 
 ​
 Does anyone else have a similar issue? Does anyone use it?
 I didn't find any alternative to this feature as well.
 ​
 Many thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am using Emacs to edit files in a computer in my network over ssh. However, this has been very painful because I sometimes lose connection (for example if put my Emacs into sleep mode) and then Tramp freezes emacs and I see a message: "Tramp: Openning connection nil for HOSTNAME"
 I then have to kill emacs and restart.
 Is there a way to make Tramp more robust to connections dropping?

 I'm following this tutorial for Clojure: https://www.braveclojure.com/basic-emacs/
 I follow these instructions:
 Do the following to delete your existing Emacs configuration and install the Clojure-friendly one:
  
Close Emacs.
 Delete ~/.emacs or ~/.emacs.d if they exist. (Windows users, your emacs files will probably live in C:\Users\your_user_name\AppData\Roaming\. So, for example, you would delete C:\Users\jason\AppData\Roaming\.emacs.d.) This is where Emacs looks for configuration files, and deleting these files and directories will ensure that you start with a clean slate.
 Download the Emacs configuration zip file listed above and unzip it. Its contents should be a folder, emacs-for-clojure-book1. Run mv path/to/emacs-for-clojure-book1 ~/.emacs.d.
 Open Emacs.
  
When you open Emacs, you may see a lot of activity as Emacs downloads a bunch of useful packages.
 I am able to complete the steps, however I see no activity and nothing being downloaded when I reopen EMACS. Just the regular EMACS screen with the logo.
 Anyone know what I am doing wrong ?
 Here is the file I moved to the .emacs.d folder per the tutorial

 (require 'org) (org-babel-load-file (expand-file-name "init.org" user-emacs-directory)) 
 But now in Emacs 28.2 I'm getting next error:
 error: Recursive load, /home/kereell/.emacs.d/init.el, /home/kereell/.emacs.d/init.el, /home/kereell/.emacs.d/init.el, /home/kereell/.emacs.d/init.el, /home/kereell/.emacs.d/init.el 
 https://pastebin.com/CDjLseT2 - Here is my init.org. What's wrong with that? It is actually was "working" configuration untill one day it stoped.
 P.S.: Actually it behave weird after deleting all tmp files and reboot it literaly takes all the configuration from the init.org and putting it into init.el replacing the:
 (require 'org) (org-babel-load-file (expand-file-name "init.org" user-emacs-directory)) 
 Is that a bug or new feature in emacs 28.2 or I doing anything wrong?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For one of the things I work on I use emacs exclusively in a terminal over an ssh session rather than through the GUI. I am developing C++ and recently switched from a ycmd setup to using eglot with a more recent clangd. And there's one thing it does that I want it to not do, but I can't identify the name of the behavior to google for how to configure it off (or if it's attributable to eglot or one of the other modes that eglot interacts with).
  
const auto sources: const std::set<SourceDetails> = get_filtered_sources(config, source_options);
  
The text I'm rendering here with strikethrough isn't struck through on my terminal, but it's rendered in a different text color and it's always displayed, but isn't part of the text of the buffer. When I declare a variable with auto it will annotate it with the type of the variable. Or when I call a function it will sometimes tag the names of the arguments like so:
  
config.get<std::string>(tag: "the_key_sought");
  
I would like it to not do this - these annotations unconditionally inserting itself into the flow of text pushes things out of alignment, makes rectangular yank more confusing, etc.
 Does anyone know the name of this behavior or (even better) how to configure my eglot+clangd setup to not do this? Having these annotations appear only on request would be ideal, but having them not appear at all (while not disabling eglot completely) would be a big improvement.

 I'm new to emacs, I switched over to it mostly because of org-mode. Most things are working perfectly, except for the icons in org-mode, and perhaps all icons? I'm not really sure since its the first time I use doom emacs. This is how my org files look:
 my current org-mode
 I checked for the all-the-icons font, and apparently it's installed corrently:

 And here's my doom doctor output:

 I did M-x doom/reload and doom sync, restarted emacs, and it still doesn't work. I've done M-x all-the-icons-install-fonts too. Does anybody know how to fix this?
 Here's my fetch if that helps in any way:

 For clarification, I want my org files to look like this:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a literate configuration named "custom-init.org," which is loaded in the init.el file as follows:
 ;; Load the Emacs Lisp code blocks embedded in the literate Org file (org-babel-load-file (expand-file-name "~/.emacs.d/custom-init.org")) 
 I've noticed that some people use a different loading strategy, where they directly load the Emacs Lisp file if it's available. However, this approach isn't any faster than using org-babel-load-file in my opinion:
 (if (file-exists-p (expand-file-name "config.el" user-emacs-directory)) (load-file (expand-file-name "config.el" user-emacs-directory)) (org-babel-load-file (expand-file-name "custom-init.org" user-emacs-directory))) 
 org-babel-load-file only auto-tangles during startup when it detects a modification; otherwise, it loads the cached stuff.
 The fact that Emacs initially loads the init.el file and then needs to access a different file, regardless of the method used, is what introduces a speed penalty.
 I was thinking about giving up on the Org literate setup, but right now, I don't have much time to redo my Emacs configuration in plain Emacs Lisp. I know there are cool stuff like the outshine mode, etc.. However, I'm wondering if there might be another way. Maybe there's a way to have Org mode directly add everything tangled into the "init.el" file? That would make Emacs load much faster without the need of a server/client thing.
 Also, do you think Org really adds a layer of unnecessary abstraction for a literate config, to the point where I should think about giving up at some stage? I've been considering whether the effort is justified if it's working well.

 If there's no easy way to link documentation, then is there at least some way to silence the warning, since it gets extremely verbose even when developing a tiny package?
