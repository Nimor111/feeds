        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, with all the talk about tree-sitter in Emacs 29, I decided to give it a try. With everything set up, I can confirm that I'm running c++-ts-mode when I open a cc file. However, my previous indentations like c-basic-offset set via c-mode-common-hook are not being honored. How do I control the indentation when c++-ts-mode is enabled? Thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Inspired by the recent repeat-map discussions (thanks u/karthink), I immediately noticed that rectangle-mark-mode (C-x SPC) was the perfect target for single-key quick bindings. Why? Any time I explicitly activate rectangle-mark-mode, I do so only to call one of the various *-rectangle-* commands next. So why should I remember/type their prefixes? And what's more, I can see that I have this mode active by the region shape & left border.
 Repeat wasn't the right approach, but it was simple to activate a transient map in rectangle-mark-mode-hook. Check this tiny gist. So C-x SPC, highlight your desired rectangle, then [k]ill [d]elete del-[<SPC>] [c]lear [o]pen s[t]ring [w]-copy [y]ank [N]umber. I didn't even know about the (unbound) command delete-whitespace-rectangle, but will use it often now that I don't have to bind/remember it.
 The only thing I wish for is the ability to recall the region of the last marked rectangle (line+col; from, to), for when you'd like to do a series of rect operations in a row on the same columns.

 Note that ghc924 and the advent package name are wired in. Is there a better way?
 Also note that I am not a NixOS guru, I just enjoy the feeling that I understand the state of my system via /etc/nix/configuration.nix.

 For example one of my shells has the buffer name of *myco-back-end-server*. In this shell I always run a script to start the server.
 How can I get the shell in *myco-back-end-server* buffer to run the bash script to start the server automatically? I mean, I want to write an interactive elisp function that looks something like this
 (defun my/start-development-session ()
 ( interactive )
 ( shell *myco-back-end-server* )
 ( ;; run bash script here to start the back-end server )
 ( shell *myco-front-end* )
 ( ;; run bash script to start front end )
 ( .. )
 ( etc )

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all,
 When I kill buffers, I often get the message from the title. But when I diff-buffer-with-file, I often get Diff finished (no differences).
 What gives? This is super annoying if I'm closing a long-running session with numerous unsaved buffers. 
 I don't want to just save everything without prompting, because sometimes I type accidental changes into a buffer or two. But manually checking these false positives is a pain in the ass. 
 Has anyone else dealt with/solved this? If the current buffer contents at the time of closing matches the file on disk, I don't want to be prompted.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For a fiction project I am working on I have been reading into parapsychology and branches of what I would consider pseudoscience. In digging into this work, I've found read some fascinating stuff from people who strongly believe in and/or participate in this kind of research. Their first-hand testimony is going to be valuable for some of the world-building and plot development I want to do in my speculative fiction.
Now, I want to track this information in my zettelkasten. But I also feel some small anxiety that I'll be "polluting" my notes with some of this stuff. I'm curious about how others who do this kind of research handle materials that would not be the kind of thing you'd espouse yourself, but something you want to keep a record of for some other purpose.
Second: do you keep biographical information in your zettelkasten? In this same case, I've encountered a few recurring names that I would like to track. While my novel's not going to be based whole cloth on any of these figures, I am drawing some inspiration from real life programs and work and events. My initial thought is to create a structure note related to the individual that I might put a smattering of biographical information in that can then spin off into some specifics about their life and work that matters to me. But again, curious about how others have handled this.]]></summary>

Im seeing that Scala is loosing popularity and my question is - is it a good idea to work there, with the option of becoming a niche developer that is experienced with an unpopular lang, or should i progress with other companies that use more familiar languages such as node, python etc...?
 Thanks!

 Would you pay for a yearly license for an Emacs distro preloaded with things such as Magit, lsp-mode, etc? Basically, a good out of the box IDE experience. The majority (80%?) of the proceeds could be donated to the devs of the packages. Basically, a nice value add that also benefits our package devs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What are the secrets to high performance Haskell? I've met people who claim that Haskell code should perform around 5-10x slower than C, Tikhon Jelvis says that mildly optimized Haskell can perform around 3x C in time, kuribas claims that Haskell should perform at least at 50% of C, an acquaintance can get Haskell to half of Rust's performance, and there's libraries like Attoparsec and Streamly that claim 80-90% of C performance. And of course, there's Don Stewart.
 ​
 What's the secret to getting high performance Haskell? Are the ultra-fast libraries concurrency scams (i.e, C is single-threaded, Haskell is parallel)? Or are the ultra-fast libraries actually as fast as they claim, and that it's possible to get Haskell to near-C speeds? 
 Because I love Haskell as a fun toying-around language, given how concise the language (and functional style) can be. Especially when you have defections to the Rust camp, keeping Haskell performant is a worthy goal, and I guess high-performance Haskell is joked about as "only if you're Don Stewart" or "dark magic, summoned by sacrificing puppies and kittens".
 ​
 Any tips, links, advice to get ultra-high-performance Haskell, other than, perhaps, inline-C? ;)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I know emacs has much better autocomplete (e.g. yasnippets) than Overleaf. However, I've found that simply defining new commands in overleaf goes a long way and provides similar benefits to using snippets. Also, org mode has the option to render LaTeX directly inside the editor instead of having one screen for the editor and another for the rendered output. I guess the bullet point features of org mode are also pretty cool. However, despite all of these cool features, I find when I use emacs I end up wasting a lot of time researching how to do stuff. In practice I find simply writing things up in Overleaf to be a lot faster. Does emacs eventually get faster if you're good enough at it?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, I've released ekg version 0.2. Why it feels like just yesterday I was release ekg version 0.1, and in fact it wasn't that long ago.
 ekg is a note taking application for emacs that stores all data in sqlite, is very tag-oriented, and designed to be easy to extend.
 The changes for version 0.2 are:
  
Added hooks ekg-add-schema-hook, ekg-note-pre-save-hook, ekg-note-save-hook, ekg-note-delete-hook, and ekg-note-add-tag-hook to enable customization.
 New commands ekg-show-notes-latest-captured, =kg-show-notes-latest-modified, for showing notes created or modified recently.
 Introduced variable ekg-notes-size to control the default page size for limited views such as ekg-show-notes-latest-captured.
 Added templating.
 Added embedding as an optional add-on, to enable note similarity and note search; requires an account at OpenAI or similar embedding provider.
 Added new function ekg-active-notes to easily get all non-trashed notes.
 Improved ability to have note list buffers that have flexible titles and operation, notably improving the ekg-show-notes-in-trash command.
 Standardized buffer names for ekg-notes-mode buffers, which all are prepended with "ekg" and surrounded by asterisks, to denote that they are non-file-based.
 Added documentation in texinfo, viewable via M-x info.
 Fixed bug interfering with completion at the beginning of the tag property line.
  
For details, watch the demo of 0.2 changes. I think the templating is done via a unique way that shows off the power of ekg, and embedding stuff is advanced, super useful, and virtually no other note app in any system has it. On the other hand, the embeddings costs a very small amount of money and has unfortunate privacy implications. I think it's well worth it, and I hope that you enjoy this update.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hear me out here. Before you downvote me, I'm not advocating that any functional changes be made to Emacs regarding car and cdr. I've looked up a brief history of the terms and their origins. They have their uses and should be neither removed nor renamed.
 However, as someone who's only recently learned about these terms, Emacs' self-documentation for these terms was not helpful at all to me. I saw the function being used in existing Elisp and thought, "What's car and cdr?" So I looked it up inside Emacs, and it told me that car returned the car of LIST. Wow... super helpful...
 I'd offer to submit a pull request to update the documentation if the source code wasn't managed via email, but it is. So, I'm just putting my opinion out here where someone else who contributes might read this. ``` car is a function defined in C source code.
 Signature (car LIST)
 Documentation Return the car of LIST. If LIST is nil, return nil.
 Error if LIST is not nil and not a cons cell. See also car-safe.
 See Info node (elisp)Cons Cells for a discussion of related basic Lisp concepts such as car, cdr, cons cell and list.
 Other relevant functions are documented in the list group.   cdr is a function defined in C source code.
 Signature (cdr LIST)
 Documentation Return the cdr of LIST. If LIST is nil, return nil.

I can see the benefit of incorporating this feature into longer Elisp processes as well. However, controlling the progress bar natively requires the use of Applescripts, which can be difficult without the official IDE. As Emacs users, we naturally desire an Emacs Lisp binding. 
 I would greatly appreciate any guidance on how to create bindings for the described functionality (elisp <-> shell <-> applescript). Thank you very much!

When I am programming in python or c++, the debug message is helpful as it points out what line the issue is on and why it occurred. However with emacs, when there is something wrong with my init.el file, I have run emacs with debug-init and the error message looks messy and difficult to interpret. What is the best practice or steps or tutorials on how to debug large files of elisp code or emacs errors?

 a c e g i 
 And I have:
 b d f 
 I want to be able to use one copy and one paste to achieve this:
 a b c d e f g i 
 Basically if I have 5 lines of text in my kill ring, I want to use string-rectangle at the end of a different set of 5 lines and paste the 5 lines from my kill ring directly alongside without moving any of the other lines around. I hope this mess makes sense to somebody.

 It's excellent for understanding the roots and means by which certain languages came into the world and why they are imperative or OOP and/or FP.
 I think we identify an underlying theory of programming when someone starts to build the tool to do that kind of programming. Naturally there will be a lot of overlap with other languages which are also tackling similar tasks. Richard Feldman, in the video, describes a lot of that in a very clear and entertaining way.
 Scala's place in this lineage and facing those issues
 The Scala community has to tackle those same issues. For example, what is the programing paradigm, what is the name of it, and what are the techniques & parts…]]></summary>

 Codd is a tool that applies plain postgres SQL migrations atomically (when postgres allows it) and enforces schema consistency checks to ensure different environments have the same schema. It also helps by providing meaningful merge conflicts for when e.g. different developers modify the same DB objects, among other interesting features. Please check its GitHub for what it can do! 
 We've been using codd at PRODA for some months (though we've been using parts of it for far longer in a transition and test period) to apply our migrations, run schema consistency checks and manage our multiple environments' databases, from dev to staging, production and tests. I'd like to thank my friends at PRODA for their support and feedback all this time: it has been invaluable. 
 Now I find it's time to release codd to a broader audience, and thought of this community because it's written in Haskell. 
 I hope the documentation on GitHub explains reasonably how codd works and its nuances. I'm open to questions and feedback of all kinds here as well!

I've tried both the url (which apparently is non-standard?) and note parameters in my BibTeX citation, but neither do anything. I've been referring to these two blog posts. I've never used BibTeX before and I'm quite new to Org mode and Emacs, so I might be missing something.
 Also, is it possible to have numbered citations?

 Also espotify.el complains of nonexisting dbus service file for spotify, while Spotify DBus is clearly functional and I can use it from the command line. 
 It would be nice to have Spotify controls with vertico fuzzy search.

Is "open-ended question" what I hope it is? "Closed question" would be sth. that you can answer with yes, no, 100; an "open-ended question" would be sth to just talk about. Fits the Wikipedia definition, but is it really without end?
Early on, there's this paragraph:

 **** subsubhead2 
 //(a lot of sub heads 
 **** subsubhead1000

 *** subHead3 
 then when will run a myTag research I will have all the 1000 subsubhead items, this is not good I guess 
 Is this the "right" approach one should follow? Basically i could mark some sub tags in the children and then refine my research? 
 It would be possible to custom in the headers #+ of the file on top the level of nested tags that have to consider? In this way I would have a tag for the subHead but not for the subsubHead(the children of a subHead)

 If I had a little visual indicator in the margin, to remind me what the thing was I'm looking at, it would help a lot.
 Is there a way to make such an indicator and move it around easily? I'm not terribly interested in learning elisp just now. Maybe when the kids are grown up...
 [EDIT] Actually, it might not be critical for it to be visible. I might be able to use setting and swapping mark and point, except that that creates a region - which is an unwanted side effect for what I am trying to do.
 [EDIT] replaced mark with indicator to avoid confusion.

For (some) Linux systems, there's an open source app targeting GTK/GNOME that was shared in my interweb circles recently:

So, I'm curious if anyone has used Emacs with Gitpod or GitHub codespaces and how they set it up.
 Thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone, I want to share a new package keepass-cli-rs I wrote recently (well actually, it's last December).
 The URL for the repo is https://github.com/fuyu0425/keepass-cli-rs
 I am aware of previous keepass packages like the following, but that does not fit my need.
  
keepass-mode
 keepass.el
  
Some highlight for this new package:
  
based on hydra, so you can quickly switch entries
 use completing-read purely, so you can use your current completion engine.
 ICON!!! which is very important to me to find the entry I want.
 You can find some screenshots in the repo.
  
Some restriction:
  
It's read-only (you cannot edit the database) and only tested by me now.
  
You can only build from source now (it's not on crate.io and Melpa now) because I want some initial feedback!

 My thought would be emacs21. basic is also fast but seems to me that it might be slower. flex seems the slowest to me out of all the default ones.

 How do I save the configuration in order for it to take effect at startup because I thought everything was supposed to save into the .emacs,d folder. but its all just going to the home directory. I 'd like to use org mode for taking notes for all my classes, is it preferred to just keep the notes under one file or is it a best practice to create different files for each subject?
 Is there a way to automatically save .org or config files in the same folder? I'm new to CS and we'll be starting on python but I have no prior programming experience and I've gone over the navigation and watched several tutorials such as Systems Crafters and a few others, read Emacs Wiki, Org website Emacs reference and all the references under getting started for the last two weeks. Is it best to start out vanilla or should I go spacemacs or take copy a different theme. The default white background is blinding me.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm doing my masters in CS, and it won't be long until I finish. It's right now shy to 3 a.m. and I've been losing sleep recently about what I'll do after graduating. To put it mildly, Haskell was everything that I used in the past 4 years. I'd say I'm in an intermediate level in utilizing Haskell. I did my bachelor thesis using Haskell, and doing my master thesis using Haskell again. I also had student jobs in which I taught and programmed using Haskell and Scala.
 I'm starting to ask myself what I'll do after graduating. Do I look for a Haskell job? (I'm based in Germany, and everything I'm finding is requiring to already have many years of experiences in the field which I don't have, and I also found other jobs in cyber security which are related to Functional programming but I have no expertise in that and they always ask for people with experience). This means I can't help but to wonder what I will be doing for living.
 Do I ignore Haskell and fp in general for now? Which other it-jobs could be suitable for someone with my modest expertise? Which other languages should I concentrate at instead? Which IT-jobs should I keep an eye on if Haskell jobs are not within reach? Should I try to find a job in cyber security since many cyber security jobs ask for Haskell developers? Does anyone have a personal experience with my dilemma or any advice on what I must do next? Are there some special platforms for fp programmers who are looking for jobs? I feel right now like a child in the body of a grown-up.

https://github.com/microsoft/wslg/issues/614
  
​
 That being noted, seeing Tux for every Linux application installed via WSL2 sucks.
 ​
 Here's the workaround I used, posting here for anyone else for future reference:
 ​
 Related Workflow Notes:
  
I found the related icon here: 
 https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:EmacsIcon.svg
 
 More specifically, I used the '48x48 pixel' version here: 
 https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/08/EmacsIcon.svg/48px-EmacsIcon.svg.png
 
 I then downloaded it via just using Firefox in Windows as 'EmacsIcon.png'.
 I then copied and pasted it to the 'Linux > Ubuntu-22.04 > usr > share > icons' folder (This directory is '\wsl.localhost\Ubuntu-22.04\usr\share\icons' in File Explorer on Windows 10)
 The resulting file with path was the following 
 '/usr/share/icons/EmacsIcon.png'
 
 I then edited the '/usr/local/share/applications/emacs.desktop' file to include the following changes:

 ```

I started a new book Weinberg On Writing: The Fieldstone Method and it is terrific. Funny, and it contains many insights. Weinberg's 'fieldstone method dovetails nicely with the zettelkasten method.' Before my time here on the forums, @ctietze mentioned Weinberg back in Feb of 2018 - Writing with the Zettelkasten is like building a fieldstone wall and Gerald Weinberg was brought up again by @chrisaldrich back in October - Review of “On Intellectual Craftsmanship” (1952) by C. Wright Mills, I'm slow on the uptake. Still, if you keep pounding away, I'll finally get it.
Please tell me about your past week and what you are working on.

  1 git --no-pager --literal-pathspecs -c core.preloadindex\=true -c log.showSignature\=false -c color.ui\=false -c color.diff\=false commit -- hint: Waiting for your editor to close the file... Waiting for Emacs... *ERROR*: Wrong type argument: keymapp, nil
 I can create a commit in the shell no problem and it will ask for my passphrase. I can push no problem with magit, just can't commit and I believe its due to gpg.
 My gpg-agent.conf:
 ```
 #Do not ask me about entered passwords for 24h (during the same session)
 default-cache-ttl 86400 max-cache-ttl 86400
 pinentry-program /usr/bin/pinentry-tty allow-loopback-entry
 #Allow pinentry in Emacs minibuffer (combined with epg-pinentry-mode)
 allow-loopback-pinentry allow-emacs-pinentry``` 
 Thanks for any help.

 I often find myself in writing Elisp with a "data-flow" mindset, meaning "this data should be processed like this, then like this, then like this". I could use some piping techniques, but what if I then need to reuse a partial result? Should I recompute everything? Of course not, let* to the rescue!
 Except that let* syntax is a bit too verbose, I'd like to have something similar to Rust's let. Well, here's my attempt, help yourselves:
 ``` (defmacro rust-let (&rest body) "Allow to have a let Rust-like syntax in BODY."
 (cond ((not body) '()) ((atom body) body) ((listp body) (let ((current-form (car body))) (cond ((not current-form) current-form) ((atom current-form) current-form) ((listp current-form) (if (eq (car current-form) 'rlet) (let ((,(cadr current-form) ,(caddr current-form))) (rust-let ,@(cdr body))) (progn ,current-form (rust-let ,@(cdr body))))) )))))  This allows to turn  (rust-let (rlet a-partial-result (some-func some-data)) (rlet another-partial-result (another-func a-partial-result)) (process-func another-partial-result) ;; but I want to return a-partial-result)  into  (let ((a-partial-result (some-func some-data))) (let ((another-partial-result (another-func a-partial-result))) (progn (process-func another-partial-result) a-partial-result))) ``` Any suggestion is greatly appreciated!

Do you guys use the Design by contract very often? Is this something useful on a production environment? If yes, what tips or references would give me?
 This is just an example I've written testing the preconditions and postconditions feature. Still, all these checks may throw an exception and it's necessary to wrap then on a try-catch block wich would make the code less elegant, are there any solution to this? *If this feature is really useful.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I would like to introduce the second release of Iris — a Haskell CLI framework that supports CLI Guidelines.
  
https://github.com/chshersh/iris
  
There were lots of changes since the initial release last year, so now would be a perfect time to try Iris!
 The most significant improvements are:
  
A complete tutorial about writing CLI apps in Haskell with Iris
 Lots of Haddock improvements
 Automatic detection of terminal colouring support
  
 See CHANGELOG for more details.
  
​
 I created Iris with the initial goal to provide mentorship to beginners in Haskell, FP, and Open-Source. And, as you can notice, most of the improvements were made by outside contributors. If you would like to contribute something to Iris, check out beginner-friendly issues!
 It takes a lot of effort and patience to help others, but in the end, I hope my guidance was helpful to them 🤗
 P.S. To add a few more positive news, today is also my 29th birthday 🥳🎂 Your best gift to me would be to support my Haskell Open-Source work via GitHub Sponsorship. Or you can just star Iris on GitHub, and this would encourage me to continue doing more Haskell OSS!

 They wrote to me today: 
  
Sorry for the delay, Team has a less experience in Scala tech. We are trying to setup and make it work and also we have aligned the recruitment team to hire the resource with the same expertise.
  
Which basically translated to - they need to hire a Scala dev before they can continue working on my website.
 If anyone is interested, then you can help me by working for them....
 Their Upwork profile is: https://www.upwork.com/agencies/~01edb0e09d72122edd/
 And their website is: https://softobiz.com/
 Personally, there may be a possibility for me to hire a Scala dev directly, but it's not that straightforward since I am not very proficient in code, and my original dev who wrote the backend in Scala has flaked off (for the most part), leaving me trying to figure out how to proceed. That's why I went to an agency rather than hiring directly. The original dev is still around per se, but it takes a week to extract any information from him. Albeit 50% of the info needed is document on Confluence.
 Nevertheless, thought I'd post if anyone was interested.
 Thanks.

 I just recently found out that one can't have something like this in servant:
 UVerb 'PATCH '[JSON] '[ WithStatus 200 Foo, WithStatus 500 ErrorA, WithStatus 500 ErrorB] 
 Which confused me at first because the docs mentions this:
  
A variant of Verb that can have any of a number of response values and status codes.
  
This led me to believe that this was possible, but it seems to be limited to one per status code. Since eventually, all servant seems to care about is the status code, not exactly including the response body itself. The above becomes
 '[200, 500, 500] 
 Which GHC tells me about because genericServeT expects this list to be unique; any duplicate status code will fail regardless of the varying response bodies.

 Also another very common task is to change part of a name written in camel or snake case. Both killing and navigating fast to the point where I want to kill would be great!
 However similar questions in stack overflow and the net often get shot down with “just code it yourself”. I probably will, but was just wondering if other people would like that itch scratched or know a canonical solution that’s already available (package)?

 However, i have no idea how to get back to the other mode (what's the other mode even called)? I've looked at the entire eshell documentation and found not a single thing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 In the online tutorials I see examples of people scheduling tasks for particular days, and then the agenda view gives a great overview of tasks for the week.
 The question: What do you do if the day arrives and you are not able to complete many of the items? For me, this is _usually_ the case: either I am hit with an unexpected task at work, or I over-estimate how much I can do in a day.
 Specifically, do you delete the items and create new ones on the next day? Or change their date somehow? It seems like a lot of work to have to re-schedule tasks each day.
 ​
 ​
 Recently I asked this question about setting up an org/todo workflow that does _not_ use dates.
 https://www.reddit.com/r/orgmode/comments/1163k17/first_time_org_todo_user_fit_it_to_me_or_vice/
 The answer provided worked, but it would need some work to setup an agenda view, and I am wondering if I am just missing the right way to think about org.

 Currently
 I have the log view in my agenda set up to show both closed and clocked tasks by way of (setq org-agenda-log-mode-items '(closed clock state)). When a task is both clocked and closed, I'll see something like this:
 13:30-14:38 Clocked: (1:08) DONE Read a book 14:00...... ---------------- 14:38...... Closed: DONE Read a book 
 I want to suppress the second entry.
 Fumblings
 I think I want something that behaves like org-agenda-skip-deadline-if-done, i.e. org-agenda-skip-done-if-clocked, but that doesn't exist.
 I'm not sure how to do it with a custom org-agenda-skip-function either, because whether I want to skip it depends on whether it's been shown already, and I don't think that information is available.
 I thought about using org-agenda-finalize-hook but that seems like it would be hard and probably the wrong way to do it.

 ​
 I've seen both Krita-mode and Xournalpp-mode but both seem overkill for what i want to achieve: in particular, I dislike the fact that in Krita you have to specify width and height for the picture you want to create. Xournalpp, on the other hand, is more suited to make complete notes in A4 format, rather than quick sketches. 
 ​
 I'd like something that is more like a Whiteboard and is possible to embed in emacs with no issue, in whatever size it takes to occupy my sketches. Does anyone here uses something similar?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[XFTP is a new file transfer protocol focussed on meta-data protection - it is based on the same principles as SimpleX Messaging Protocol used in SimpleX Chat messenger:
  
asynchronous file delivery - the sender does not need to be online for file to be received, it is stored on XFTP relays for a limited time (currently, it is 48 hours) or until deleted by the sender.
 padded e2e encryption of file content.
 content padding and fixed size chunks sent via different XFTP relays, assembled back into the original file by the receiving client.
 efficient sending to multiple recipients (the file needs to be uploaded only once).
 no identifiers or ciphertext in common between sent and received relay traffic, same as for messages delivered by SMP relays.
 protection of sender IP address from the recipients.
  
You can download XFTP CLI (Linux) to send files via the command line here - you need the file named xftp-ubuntu-20_04-x86-64, rename it to xftp.
 Send the file in 3 steps:
  
to send: xftp send filename.ext
 to share: pass the generated file description(s) to the recipient(s) via any secure channel, e.g. via SimpleX Chat.
 to receive: xftp recv rcvN.xftp
  
Please let us know what you think, what downsides you see to this approach, and any ideas you have about how it can be improved.
 We are currently integrating the support of XFTP protocol into SimpleX Chat that will allow sending videos and large files seamlessly and without the sender being online - it is coming soon!

 I used both alternatively because I think it is become better on the other side.
 There is always the easy vscode but not with full vim keybinding.
 I decided to share my personal comparaison. 
 Here, I share my point of view. 
 Why I prefer DOOM
  
 LSP (clangd, there the % progression of DB, I know that it is ongoing)
  GUI mode
  Call tree (available natively for C++)
  copy/paste (more easy because of the GUI)
  grep (ripgrep is better integrated for me, no plugin to add)
  find file (the same with fd)
  server mode (emacsclient)
  git (magit)
  Docker (included by default)
  Bookmark (easy to use by default)
  Org mode
  Fold (evil is working well by default)
  installation on windows
  
why I prefer Lunarvim
  
 Comment (simple <cc> shortcut)
  Treesitter (by default first)
  DAP debug (better integrated even in terminal)
  Terminal mode (expected for…)
  C-i/C-o navigation
  Explorateur (nvimtree)
  project (more easy to mksession)
  show invisible char
  git lens
  search & replace(inccommand=split)
  undo (as I want by default)
  configuration (more easy with lua)
  escape key (I can use ’ù’)
  highlight (It is highlighting a word everywhere)
  mergeconflict (thanks to lazygit integration)
  speed
  
Do you have a similar behavior from one to another ? why ?

 Because sometimes I have long headings, and the tags get misaligned or in a different line of the item (if visual-line-mode is on). So, I thought that having the tags at the beginning of the item would make the document more organized, since my tags are usually shorter and about the same size.
 Is there a way I could do that? Suggestions are welcome.

This has lifted my spirits quite a bit. I was starting to think that it might not be feasible anymore to continue on my current path. It was also a bit overwhelming, thus my late response.
 It all began on Sunday, when I realized I was likely to loose many sponsors, due to GitHub's decision to stop accepting donations made through PayPal. I quickly send an update to existing sponsors urging them to update their payment method, which got "leaked" in parts.
 My post contained an appeal to also encourage other users to contribute, so the leak is perfectly okay with me. I wasn't really expecting it to be posted verbatim, but had I wanted to prevent…]]></summary>

 When doing that, I often end up realising I need to pop a TODO in the middle of a thought / text. Now, I do understand that I can make a header be a TODO -> but in this case I will often be in the middle of the bullet point list, or middle of paragraph, and I Just want to pop a TODO there to work more on that piece or to reconsider something later. Kind of like leaving breadcrumbs for later, since I usually do many passes through this document until I completely refine it.
 Of course, I can just write TODO, but then it is not recognized as a TODO by org, and I would like to be able to get a list of all TODOs, mark them as done, move from one to the other, have them nicely syntax highlighted, ... .
 Any advice how to go about this? Should I be doing this in Org in some other way?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today I wanted to calculate some costs in an org buffer. I heard that calc was powerful and convenient but found it unintuitive when I tried it the last time.
 I gave it a second chance today and had fun using it, entering formulas in the org-mode buffer then marking them with a region and letting calc evaluate the formulas and pasting it back into the buffer. But I needed too many key presses to do this really comfortably, so I made something for the next time, which should be more fun:
 ​
 (global-set-key (kbd "C-c c") 'calc-insert-result-with-equal-sign) (defun calc-insert-result-with-equal-sign (this-prefix-arg) "Evaluate the expression in the active region using `calc`, insert an equal sign and the result." (interactive "p") (calc-fix-notation 2) (if current-prefix-arg (calc-fix-notation this-prefix-arg)) (let ((expression (buffer-substring-no-properties (region-beginning) (region-end)))) (if (string-empty-p (string-trim expression)) (message "Region is empty.") (let ((result (calc-eval expression))) (goto-char (max (region-beginning) (region-end))) (insert " = ") (insert result) (deactivate-mark))))) 
 ​
 Mark a formula in any buffer, press C-c c to insert " = result" to the right of the region. This will insert the result with 2 digits after the decimal-point. If called with C-u number C-c c it will insert the result with the specified Number of digits after the decimal point.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A common task I have when refactoring some code is to search for an occurrence of some text in the codebase and then look at or update the code at that point. For example, I might want to check every use of a certain library is being used in a thread-safe manner.
 So I search for this string - e.g. using consult-git-grep - and I get a list of results. I go to the first result, then do my thing. Now I want to go to the second item in the search and I have to search again.
 Emacs of course makes this as painless as possible since I can do M-p to yoink the previous search term, but it's still a bit inconvenient to have to search again multiple times. I also lose my place in the search list.
 I was wondering if there was a better way of doing this. E.g. is there a way of telling the minibuffer to stay open, so if I search for something I can go through the list methodically?
 Or maybe there's a package that handles this nicely, or is there a better way of using the tools?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm currently rereading the book "Get Programming with Haskell" and in chapter 4.2 on page 40-42 is an example use case for first class functions: 
 sfOffice name = if lastName < "L" then nameText ++ " - PO Box 1234 - San Francisco, CA, 94111" else nameText ++ " - PO Box 1010 - San Francisco, CA, 94109" where lastName = snd name nameText = (fst name) ++ " " ++ lastName nyOffice name = nameText ++ ": PO Box 789 - New York, NY, 10013" where nameText = (fst name) ++ " " ++ (snd name) renoOffice name = nameText ++ " - PO Box 456 - Reno, NV 89523" where nameText = snd name getLocationFunction location = case location of "ny" -> nyOffice "sf" -> sfOffice "reno" -> renoOffice _ -> (\name -> (fst name) ++ " " ++ (snd name)) addressLetter name location = locationFunction name where locationFunction = getLocationFunction location >> addressLetter ("Bob","Smith") "ny" "Bob Smith: PO Box 789 - New York, NY, 10013" 
 The author then writes the following:
  
Now that you’ve separated each function needed for generating addresses, you can easily add new rules as they come in from each office.
  
While I'm understanding the code itself, I have problems to apply what the author has written.
 Where would you add new rules? Would you write a new rule function and pass it down to the nyOffice for example? This approach doesn't seem to scale well if you add several rules.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[https://hackage.haskell.org/package/sorting-network repo: https://github.com/Javran/sorting-network (PRs are welcome!)
 I have this idea of using TH to turn sorting network into partial sort functions for small lists (2 - 16 elements) for a while. Not many resources turn up with I searched Haskell topics on this so I got my hands dirty. I'm happy with the performance (see some benchmark output below) with my proof-of-concept code, so I decided to turn this into a package (apologies that I didn't spend much work on documenting, in my defense I'm quite excited to share it - expect quality to improve in future releases).
 To use this, import Data.SortingNetwork to bring into scope functions like sortList4By :: (a -> a -> Ordering) -> [a] -> [a] (partial function) and sortTup4By :: (a -> a -> Ordering) -> (a, a, a, a) -> (a, a, a, a) (supporting list / tuple of 2 - 16 elements, but TH module is exported so you can generate more).
 To explain how it works, the implementation took some inspiration from https://doisinkidney.com/posts/2018-05-06-sorting-small.html. For a input size 3, a sorting network (more specifically, my package uses https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batcher_odd%E2%80%93even_mergesort - I'll try to try to have optimal network and other varieties in future releases) would compare and conditionally swap a-b, a-c, b-c in that order (I'm kinda relying on optimization to figure out data dependencies and take advantage of parallelism). And the TH generates function like below (name shadowing is intentional for demostration, although in code I do ensure that all new variables are fresh):
 sortTup3By = \cmp (a, b, c) -> let sw = \u v f -> if cmp u v == GT then f v u else f u v in sw a b \a b -> sw a c \a c -> sw b c \b c -> (a, b, c) 
 Unit tests are complete coverage based on 0-1 principle.
 Benchmark output is available: https://gist.github.com/Javran/95cf757866668e43fe188d70f25c1c05 (comparing with Data.List.sort)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am trying to build an AST using tree-sitter and I found related nodes which seemingly has what I need. 
 Edit: I am basically redoing this since I made some progress but am getting unexpected results.
 Here is a function that I believe should be getting the parent type, starting/ending position and the parent node. That being said, my output isn't actually giving me the parent node. My output is 
 Parent node:#<user-ptr ptr=0x565357826740 finalizer=0x7fcf98715780>, type: modifiers, start: 46, end: 59
  (defun testing/AST-parent () "Return parent node of the tree-sitter node at point." (interactive) (setq get-parent (tsc-get-parent (tree-sitter-node-at-pos (thing-at-point 'symbol)))) (if get-parent (progn (setq parent-type (tsc-node-type get-parent)) (setq parent-start (tsc-node-start-position get-parent)) (setq parent-end (tsc-node-end-position get-parent)) (message "Parent node:%s, type: %s, start: %s, end: %s" get-parent parent-type parent-start parent-end)) (message "No parent node"))) 
 Edit 2: Solved it! Below is the code that will get the parent node of the node under the cursor. If anyone more knowledgeable on tree-sitter has a better idea to solve this then I'm all ears, but for now this is what I got: 
 ``` (defun testing/AST-parent () "Return parent node of the tree-sitter node at point." (interactive) (let ((node (tree-sitter-node-at-pos))) (if node (message "%s" (tsc-node-type (tsc-get-parent (tsc-get-parent node)))) (message "No parent node at point"))))

 com.wbillingsley %%% veautiful % 0.3.0
 com.wbillingsley %%% doctacular % 0.3.0
 Docs here: https://www.wbillingsley.com/veautiful/
 API here: https://javadoc.io/doc/com.wbillingsley/veautiful_sjs1_3
 https://javadoc.io/doc/com.wbillingsley/doctacular_sjs1_3 
 Veautiful is a "low level control, high level ease of use" front-end library
 Doctacular is a set of components/classes for it that are particularly useful for building teaching materials (e.g. interactive slide decks and tutorials, teaching sites driven by a table of contents)
 They are substantially the same as 0.3-M6.
 Our (southern) autumn teaching trimester has just started, so my focus switches a little from updating the library to the sites that are built using it. i.e. the next release might not be for a few months, as the current one has enough for what I'm teaching at the moment.

 If you have suggestions on how to improve this, please keep in mind the high school algebra limitation. It should either be things that remove unnecessary parts so there's less to remember or things that explain it in even plainer language.

 Vitalii helped me on some points I was struggling but I've managed to make an app which has three modules, one as the worker, another a CLI client and last a REST server which listens to an API using zio-http and fires workflows to the Temporal cluster. The app also publishes Prometheus metrics using zio-metrics.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Whoops, running behind schedule...
 Randomly stumbled on this part of the org mode manual:
  
11.4.2 Time-of-day specifications 
 Org mode checks each agenda item for a time-of-day specification. The time can be part of the timestamp that triggered inclusion into the agenda, for example 
 <2005-05-10 Tue 19:00> 
 Time ranges can be specified with two timestamps: 
 <2005-05-10 Tue 20:30>--<2005-05-10 Tue 22:15> 
 In the headline of the entry itself, a time(range)—like ‘12:45’ or a ‘8:30-1pm’—may also appear as plain text.
  
Which means I don't have to fiddle with timestamp creation to adjust my times for tasks/events and I don't have to worry about going in to a file after capturing something to finish putting in a time range. All I need is a date stamp on a headline and this will work automatically. (You can disable this behavior by setting org-agenda-search-headline-for-time to nil.)
 Somehow I hadn't come across this feature before. I've recently gotten more into managing time/time blocking in my org agenda and this was a useful enough discovery that I thought I'd share!

 I'm using a Windows client to access various headless, Linux-based development servers. In many cases I want to edit a file on the remote server, using Emacs.
 Currently, I have just been using SSH (PuTTY) with X11 forwarding enabled. I simply SSH to my target, open the file, and voila Emacs is drawn on my local/Windows client. When I'm on the same local network as the development servers, this works fine.
 When I'm connecting remotely (VPN), oftentimes a much slower connection, this can get a little ugly. It works, yes, but can be painfully slow. For example, hitting page up inside Emacs may take a couple of seconds to draw. This creates the need for some very delicate typing/selecting of text.
 How can I improve this setup? I have started to research emacsclient (to run in Windows) to potentially connect to Emacs on the Linux side (running in daemon mode), but I'm not sure that this is actually the correct approach. It doesn't totally make sense to me, as the file I'm trying to open is located on the daemon/Linux side (not Windows). Any help is appreciated!

When I press the up arrow or down arrow to extend the selected region, it sometimes gets "locked" and continues forever as if the arrow key has been held down constantly. This locks out the emacs window as it goes on scrolling up or down forever increasing the selected region. It does not respond to any user input or a ctrl -g break. Any ideas what's wrong ? Usually once it's reached the top or bottom of the buffer the control eventually returns to the user.

 I've just joined a new company and the code is indented with only 2 spaces which hurts my feelings, and doesn't help readability in my opinion. 
 Since I can't really change this, is it possible to use 2 spaces as the indentation style but makes it appear wider? For ex: 2 spaces could look like 4 (only for indentation spaces)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I wanted to get hands dirty of calling GHC Wasm Module from browser, here is what I got and I'd like to share my experience. I might be rebuilding some wheels here, please let me and everyone know!
 Full example at: https://github.com/hellwolf/haskell-examples/tree/master/2023-02-24-wasm-comm.
 Browser to Haskell Wasm Reactor Module Communication Example
 Setup Using Nix
  nix shell https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc-wasm-meta/-/archive/master/ghc-wasm-meta-master.tar.gz 
 Read more about GHC Wasm: https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc-wasm-meta.
 Run the Demo
 Build
  $ make 
 Serve
 Using python http.server:
  $ make serve 
 Test
 Visit http://localhost:8000/ from your browser and open console.
 You should see the output:
  echo: hello world client.js:67:12 size before 0 client.js:68:12 size after 2 client.js:71:12 a= 42 client.js:72:12 b= 21 client.js:73:12 c= <empty string> 
 What Was Done
  
A toy Store.hs providing a wasm-independent save2/load2/size2 API globally.
 A WasmComm.hs module that exports Store.hs module through FFI.
 It uses wasm32-wasi-ghc to build a wasm reactor module that exports for Javascript VM to use.
 Browser client library uses browser_wasi_shim to communicate with the module.
  
Javascript String Hurdle
 The biggest challenge is that in order to pass Javascript string between the Wasm Module and Javascript VM, we need to play with the linear memory model of wasm.
 This example creates a few ad-hoc wrapper function to help with the alloc/free memory management convention for the functions exported by the Haskell wasm reactor module.
 Here is an example of how to wrap the Haskell save function as store_save for Javascript usage:
 haskell foreign export ccall save :: CString -> CString -> IO () 
 javascript function store_load(k) { return fromCString(withCString(k, k => inst.exports.load(k))); } 
 Check the client.js for more information about how fromCString and withCString is implemented.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been using the Hyper modifier for ages, as a place to put personal bindings. I have xkb rules set up to remap a physical key to the modifier.
 Long story short, since upgrading to Emacs 28.2, the Hyper modifier hasn't been working right. Certain combinations, like H-e work fine, while other combinations like H-i do not. C-h k shows that Emacs gets an unmodified i, but a correctly modified H-e. xev shows that the Hyper keycode is being emitted consistently.
 If I change my X session to start an xterm instead of Emacs, then launch Emacs from the xterm, the modifier works perfectly. But when it's started directly in my session, it works inconsistently.
 I haven't changed any other part of my setup, other than upgrading Emacs.
 Any thoughts what might be wrong here?

I first made sure I had WSL2 installed, and updated, etc.
 I then installed 'Ubuntu 22.04' from the Microsoft Store (had to hit Ctrl-C to get it to prompt for the username and password part of the installation, but it worked).

 From my browsing I stumbled upon a list of libraries which I'm currently taking into account.
  
selda (Postgres, SQLite)
 persistent (Postgres, SQLite, MySql, MongoDB)
 beam (Postgres, SQLite)
  
Do you have experience with one or multiple of these libraries? Let me know what you prefer.
 From looking at the manuals quickly I liked selda the best, but maybe you know better than me :)

 So basically, the Emacs theme I created is fine for Org Mode and some modes, but it sucks for vterm usage, especially for 'curses' style terminal programs where its just blindingly bad.
 I don't have the time to configure the theme correctly, so I would prefer the following:
  
Is it possible to just set a different theme for 'vterm' vs have a different theme for 'Org Mode' etc?
  
​
 Thanks!

However the video seemed to imply that eshell is a shell and not a terminal. But it seems vterm doesn't really provide support for doing stuff like capturing output like eshell does. So I'm kinda confused.

 Maybe a better explanation would be this: I want to reference a subtree from another file, where the changes I make on one would be reflected on the other.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've wanted to have a reason to do Haskell for some time now, the type system and guarantees are just too good. I have used some Haskell-like languages and I liked it. I also prefer functional programming to others. However, I came to realize, having a dynamic type system is a headache and missed type guarantees. 
 So now, I want to try to give Haskell a try. I read a little on DataHaskell, but not sure yet.
 I just want a language that can replace python as my exploration language. I mainly use the jax (functional-style) library anyway. I'm not going to do big neural networks (I plan to use another language for that case), and my interest lies in small machine learning scales (think of toy problems).
 With this, is haskell okay for this? 
 Further background: I have been trying languages here and there (for varying purposes) and I usually go back to a non-functional language just because of the lack of libraries or development or !documentation (Elm, ML-based languages, etc).
 Maybe Haskell, being very rich in types... can it type check matrix types(shapes) (or can I write them my own)?

 I struggled to find some resources on the subject, so I'm looking for help.
 In org-mode, i would like to export in pdf a document with and without headlines tagged differently in two or more separated files.
 For example, if we considered this file, named a_dumb_example.org :
  
# Headline one :foo: 
 Some contents 
 # Headline two :bar: 
 Another contents
  
I would like to export it in two files :
  
a_dumb_example_foo.pdf : containing only the contents of the first headline
 a_dumb_example_bar.pdf : containing only the contents of the second headline
  
It's seemed like you can do almost anything with elisp, but i can't manage to find anything. Theses days, as I mentioned in another post (https://www.reddit.com/r/orgmode/comments/10fyjyc/comment/j5edzha/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) I do everything this manually, but I want to speed up the process. 
 Any hints ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I know I can set for the whole document like this:
 #+TODO: TASK | IN-PROGRESS | IN-REVIEW | DONE 
 But I want some subtrees to have different TODO sequences/keywords, so they would be scoped to a subtree.
 One way I found was to set the sequences I'd use in the document like this:
 #+TODO: TASK | IN-PROGRESS | IN-REVIEW | DONE #+TODO: TODO | DONE 
 This way the TODOs would have both sequences, but maybe there's a better way to achieve that?
 Ideally, it would be a property where I could set the steps/keywords there, like I can do with :LOGGING: so I would avoid cycling the wrong sequence in the subtrees.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Emacs newbie here, be gentle. I'm rewriting my config and trying to keep packages to a minimum. Since I want to use emacs as an IDE, I want to install eglot for the LSP client and company to have a better completion UI. I went with eglot over lsp mode because I have previously used lsp mode and it seemed slow. Plus, eglot is shipping with emacs 29 by default, which means it is good enough to be included in emacs, so I might as well use it.
 Anyway, I do the typical thing. M-x package-install RET eglot RET. Gets installed from elpa as expected. Same with company: M-x package-install RET company RET. They both work, all is good, but upon restarting, they're not longer there.
 After some head scratching I realized they are not being initialized. After running package-initialize they both work again. If I add that same function to the end of my init.el, then it works. But why? The package-enable-at-startup variable is set to true, as it should.
 Here's my config, it's not very big.
 Also as an extra. Anyway to move the eln-cache folder? Thanks.
 EDIT: I know the packages.el file isn't being loaded. That's fine, I'm not done with it yet. I have installed the packages manually with the built-in package manager.

 I want to exclude the hidden directories. Can I achieve this with directory-files-recursive? It seems the regexp is only applied to the basenames, without the paths. 
 Thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm sure many people are familiar with Li Haoyi's excellent article, "Benchmarking Scala Collections," which can be found at https://www.lihaoyi.com/post/BenchmarkingScalaCollections.html. However, the article was written six years ago for Scala 2.11 and an unspecified version of the JDK. Time flies so fast! Regardless, I have taken the time to update the old benchmark to Scala 3, added some new tests, and run it on Scala 3.2.2 and JDK 19.0.1.
 Here are results: https://gist.github.com/scf37/36a86427697bcf1fdae161edbc2bb2c9
 Some conclusions:
 - mutable.Map and mutable.Set are no slower than their immutable counterparts on all operations
 - Lookups on immutable Maps/Sets are 5 times slower
 - foreach is good enough on Scala collections but is horrible on arrays
 - Vector lookup performance is much closer to HashMap than to mutable.Buffer
 - mutable collections are as fast as their Java counterparts

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Left folds are by default defined via right folds in base, because this way left folds play better with fusion as explained in the Call Arity paper:
  
Call Arity was devised mainly to allow for a fusing foldl, i.e. a definition of foldl in terms of foldr that takes part in list fusion while still producing good code.
  
E.g. the default definition of Data.Foldable.foldl' is 
 foldl' :: (b -> a -> b) -> b -> t a -> b foldl' f z0 xs = foldr f' id xs z0 where f' x k z = k $! f z x 
 On the other hand the default definition of Data.Foldable.foldl1 is this:
 foldl1 :: Foldable t => (a -> a -> a) -> t a -> a foldl1 f xs = fromMaybe (errorWithoutStackTrace "foldl1: empty structure") (foldl mf Nothing xs) where mf m y = Just (case m of Nothing -> y Just x -> f x y) 
 Why not something like
 foldl1 :: Foldable t => (a -> a -> a) -> t a -> a foldl1 f xs = foldr step (const id) xs (const id) $ errorWithoutStackTrace "foldl1: empty structure" where step x k f' z = k f (f' z x) {-# INLINE step #-} {-# INLINE foldl1 #-} 
 ? The latter seems like it would play much better with fusion. I didn't check, but perhaps it's more efficient too? Both versions generalize trivially to foldl1', which would be great to add to base if only to define maximumBy and minimumBy in terms of it. Those are currently defined as
 maximumBy :: Foldable t => (a -> a -> Ordering) -> t a -> a maximumBy cmp = fromMaybe (errorWithoutStackTrace "maximumBy: empty structure") . foldl' max' Nothing where max' mx y = Just $! case mx of Nothing -> y Just x -> case cmp x y of GT -> x _ -> y {-# INLINEABLE maximumBy #-} minimumBy :: Foldable t => (a -> a -> Ordering) -> t a -> a minimumBy cmp = fromMaybe (errorWithoutStackTrace "minimumBy: empty structure") . foldl' min' Nothing where min' mx y = Just $! case mx of Nothing -> y Just x -> case cmp x y of GT -> y _ -> x {-# INLINEABLE minimumBy #-} 
 Or am I missing something?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I had done some search here and on the internet, finding some talks, articles resources such as [1][2][3][4]. While they are good, somehow I feel something is missing based on my current level - a person who has experience and works on Scala projects, but still feels himself lacking of "something" or advance knowledge.
 For instance, [1] is nice which helps me get started in understanding the differences between OOP and FP when applying related concepts. [2] is also good that points out some usages that I was not aware of like case class's copy. [3] and [4] are probably the resources that are closest to my expectation because I am looking for materials that I don't need to rely on third party library, and can build/ design the artifact of my own after learning; however, [3] seemingly is not finished while [4] looks like a starting point.
 So I would like to know if any recommended resources (doc, links, videos, and so on) of such topics that fill in this gap? Or diving the library such as cats is the only way to go? I appreciate any suggestions, and commentary.

 "Recently GitHub announced that GitHub Sponsors is going to abruptly stop accepting PayPal payments on February 23, 2023.
 "In the three days since, I have already lost a dozen sponsors. If this continues at this rate, I am going to loose over half my sponsors on this platform.
 "This is a huge issue for me. These donations are not just a nice extra but how I make a living. I already have to get by with an income that is way below minimal wage, so losing sponsors in great numbers really hurts. I receive about 80% of all donations through Github Sponsors, losing between 50% and 75% of that, would mean I cannot pay my bills anymore.
 "If you are currently using PayPal, then please take some time to switch to another payment method, either here on GitHub, or by using one of the many other options donation options."
  
My personal opinion as a professional developer and one among many donators is that I couldn't survive my work without the help of Magit. It allows me to be really effective and to find new Git tricks.
 If you are using Paypal as a payment method in Github, please switch to another way of donating. And if you're not donating, this would be a great time to start.
 Donate to Magit!

Whilst at school several decades ago, I became very keen on Tony Buzan's methods popularised by his 1974 BBC television series Use Your Head, in which he encouraged people to use colourful mindmaps and speedreading, among other techniques, to better understand and remember anything they were studying.  At the time, I was a failing student.  So, even though most students and staff saw his techniques as weird, I decided to give them ago.  To my astonishment, by applying just a couple of his key techniques, I quickly started getting top marks and with less effort.  So, I have no doubt Tony's methods have merit.
It would therefore be beneficial to introduce coloured text into The Archive app by using some simple markup code.
Even a limited pallet would be helpful, perhaps just red, green and blue, although the more colours, the better.  Something like <r>for red text</r>, <b>for blue text</b>, etc., would be enough.  But hex codes would allow for a more extensive pallet.
Would coloured text in The Archive app be possible?
Tony Buzan's talk at SWPS University can be seen here:  https://youtu.be/QEokHNWf-Qg.
And his 1974 BBC television series Use Your Head, is available here: https://youtu.be/EgG8GuQHHIs.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, the use-package documentation says that we should use the :init keyword to execute code before the package is loaded. In the use-package documentation, those are usually variables set before the package is loaded, but can be functions to enable a certain mode as well.
 However, I've noticed for example on the Vertico GitHub page, vertico-mode is enabled in :init but it works perfectly fine when enabled in :config as well. The package is not deferred so I don't see a reason to put vertico-mode within :init.
 There are situations when using :init makes sense because the package is deferred. For example :bind automatically defers a package.
 (use-package ef-themes :init (load-theme 'ef-summer t) :bind ("<f9>" . ef-themes-select)) 
 If I wouldn't use :init in this situation, the theme wouldn't load until F9 is pressed.
 Please correct me if I'm wrong. Also, is it true that overusing :init can cause Emacs to start a little slower? I've seen it mentioned by someone here on Reddit, but I don't have the link anymore.

One thing I was interested in was defining custom indentation for an "algorithm" special block. The idea would be to define a list of keywords that, if typed within a block, that after pressing Enter on that each subsequent line the cursor would be indented until the an end keyword is reached at which point the indentation would stop. I know of psedudocode-mode (although I do not know if this can be used in an org file), but the idea would be to do something similar to that. Any guidance would be appreciated. Thanks.

 In my humble opinion, the design of NANO Emacs by u/Nicolas-Rougier is probably the best one out there. However, I could never really use NANO Emacs because I require Doom Emacs, which, on the other hand, has the best configuration framework :)
 Hence, I decided to port the NANO modeline and themes for Doom Emacs. The former is adapted to display information about the Evil state. The latter uses the Doom themes framework, making everything work out-of-the-box in Doom Emacs.
 If you want to try, those are the repository:
 https://github.com/ronisbr/doom-nano-themes
 https://github.com/ronisbr/doom-nano-modeline
 These are works in progress and probably have many bugs and inconsistencies.

 A few weeks back I wrote a blog post about my initial ideas for a Haskell persistence layer that uses generics.
 I got positive feedback and some very useful hints. In the meantime, I have been busy and have been able to implement almost all of the suggestions.
 Of course the library is still in an early stage of development. But all test cases are green and it should be ready for early adopters use. 
 Several things are still missing:
  
A query language
 Handling auto-incrementing primary keys
 coding free support for 1:1 and 1:n relationships (using more generics magic)
 schema migration
 ...
  
Feature requests, feedback and pull requests are most welcome!
 The library is available on Hackage:
 https://hackage.haskell.org/package/generic-persistence

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone!
 I'm really, really excited to announce the release of Ogma 1.0.7!
 Ogma is a NASA tool that facilitates integrating runtime monitors or runtime verification applications into other systems. Ogma extends Copilot [1], a high-level runtime verification framework that generates hard real-time code.
 In spite of the small increase in the version number, the feature included in this version is big: we now generate monitors for Robot Operating System (ROS 2) applications.
 Use cases supported by Ogma also include generating monitors directly from requirements specified using a structure natural language framework, and producing NASA Core Flight System (cFS) monitoring applications.
 For more details, including videos of monitors being generated and flown in simulators, see: https://github.com/nasa/ogma
 Monitors generated from natural-language requirements using Ogma, running inside X-Plane Flight simulator.
 Releases
 Ogma is released as a collection of packages in Hackage. The entry point is https://hackage.haskell.org/package/ogma-cli.
 Code
 The github repo is located at: https://github.com/nasa/ogma.
 What's coming
 The next release is planned for March 21st, 2023.
 Ogma is currently undergoing the qualification process necessary for NASA Class D Software. Apart from the changes required by that process, we also have the following in our roadmap:
  
Extend ROS 2 monitors with further information about sources of violations.
 Add tests to generated code.
 Simplify NASA cFS monitor generation process.
  
Happy Haskelling!
 Ivan

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Org-attach is very useful for embedding images and other files into org headings, especially with the ID flavor, which makes attachment painless. But the hard-coded attachment directory locations creates the real potential for the links to go stale. I think a couple of small additions would go a long way towards hardening org-attach against eventual "stale ID link syndrome": 
  
It would be very useful to be able to specify the org-attach-id-dir as a file-level setting, ala #+ATTACH-ID-DIR or similar. This would allow you to keep "separate stores" of id-based attachments, so you could move them around. You could do this with a relative path for org-attach-id-dir (though see below), but maybe for some documents you want all their attachments in a fixed location (e.g. ~/org/.attachments) but for others you want them "packaged together" for portability. Maybe this is already possible? The org docs don't seem to have a single place documenting all the #+CONFIG: val settings that can appear at the top of the file. 
 
Another related wish which I don't think is yet possible: an option to set org-attach-id-dir based on a locate-dominating-file search. So you could have a structure as below, and all the note's attachments would be stored and live in the top .attachments/ directory. Then you could happily move portable_dir around, send it to colleagues, etc., and attachment links would never go stale.
 
 ​
  portable_dir/ .attachments/ path1/ notes1.org notes2.org subpath1_1/ subnotes1.org path2/ notes_other.org

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have tried to shift a chunk of my online media consumption to elfeed, so that I can quickly check out blog posts, webcomics, arXiv papers, podcasts and YouTube videos. However, this has meant that updating my feeds has become quite resource intensive, and runs for a few minutes.
  
 My current setup involves 60+ feeds, 20 of which are podcasts and 10 of which are YouTube channels and playlists.
 Playing around with my settings, I now use 
  (elfeed-set-timeout 90) (setq url-queue-timeout 5) (setq elfeed-curl-max-connections 8) 
 and elfeed-search-fetch takes about 5 minutes to run, at about 25% CPU usage across my 4-core i7. I've have the elfeed timeout at 90 seconds as otherwise some feeds simply time out when I try to update them.
 Is there anyway to speed this up, or do I just have far too many feeds (some of which only update e.g. every month)?
  
 One course of action I do is to go to a particular filter setting (which I have stored as a bookmark and access via a shortcut) and do elfeed-search-fetch-visible. I do this for feeds tagged as podcasts for instance, which I check more often than blog posts.
 An alternative that I haven't started working on yet is to write something that updates some subset of feeds. I use elfeed-org to manage my list of feeds and their tags, so perhaps there's an elegant solution that ties that package into a new fetch function.

 Usecase: I wanted to take the contents of description lists in a consistent format, have them export normally and use an export filter to parse up the list's content for input into a program. After trying numerous export filters (https://orgmode.org/manual/Advanced-Export-Configuration.html), the common ones weren't satisfying as they lost formatting on export or would've caused me to write a significantly more error-prone filter than I wanted.
 The solution: wrap each section in a special block (https://orgmode.org/manual/Special-blocks-in-LaTeX-export.html) so you keep formatting and can group all the text together.
 Relevant aside: my usecase would've been trivial if either of orgmode supported either of the following:
  
multiline table cells in the default table type.
 a way to feed table.el tables to src blocks as a parameter.

 I have been exporting an org-mode manuscript via `ox-pandoc` with good results, but now I need to produce Word 'comments' from my org source. Pandoc understands these comments, so running pandoc on a `markdown` buffer using HTML syntax like this works
 <span class="comment-start" id="3" author="jdm204" date="NOW">comment</span> This is the text that is commented on. <span class="comment-end" id=3"></span> 
 but the same syntax in an org document naturally just inserts the HTML source into the document.
 I've also tried `#+begin_export pandoc` block, but that also just inserts the raw source. 
 It seems like pandoc needs something that it understands as org syntax but I'm stumped.
 Does anyone have any idea if or how this could be achieved?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Currently I am using org roam to manage my knowledge base and add notes from my laptop. But I am now thinking of transitioning my note taking on a tablet or iPad where I can type and draw to take notes. But unfortunately I can't use emacs on this and converting my notes is also a hassle. I was looking at other posts comparing emacs to obsidian and logseq, but they always go on tangents and talk about how emacs can do so much more rather than simply focusing on the note taking aspect between emacs and the other applications. So I am uncertain about emacs capabilities just for note taking with tablets and iPads. I was wondering if anyone uses a tablet for their note taking and how they integrate it quickly into their org roam? Or is this best left for obsidian which has an app on the tablet?
 Currently I'm thinking I take notes in obsidian in tablet/iPad which automatically syncs to my computer where I have a script running to convert it to org. This seems like the fastest and most efficient way of doing things

 (use-package org :ensure t) 
 When opening emacs, it connects to the repos and the *Messages* buffers indicates org is already installed, so for some reason it doesn't want to install the latest version from gnu elpa, which is version 9.6.1, local version for emacs 28.2 is 9.5.5.
 Calling list-packages and installing org manually from there solves the problem. Any ideas on how to make use-package install the gnu elpa version automatically?

Those urls often had webpack:// in front.
 I use to copy the path and edit it to open in Emacs. With this code You can just copy and press C-c C-f if the previous file shares a path.

Vertico and icomplete-vertical seem very similar on the surface: they both give a vertical completion system that uses Emacs's built-in completing-read, meaning they are both compatible with things like Marginalia and Orderless. icomplete-vertical ships with Emacs, while Vertico is a third-party package. So my question is: why would I use Vertico instead of icomplete-vertical, when they seem to offer basically the same features?

I'd also want the pdf preview to automatically scroll to the position that I am typing at. If the same thing could be done with a .tex document (no linked org file), that would also be amazing. Does anyone know how to do this? I am using pdf tools. Thanks.

 I haven't been able to find any footage that shows how the emacs workflow goes to judge if it's interesting and that's basically what I'm asking for, thanks in advance.

 The awesome part is that building buffers out of an easy-to-select storage (something MANY hate in this community) is damn effective: text is easy to read but not easy to combine on the fly and that's an issue no files&dirs text tools can solve, org-ql, org-transclusion are excellent examples of very good tools who can't give the same outcome of spit out text from a backend DB.
 The not-so-exiting part is that while notes can be org-mode, they are not actually real org-mode, yes, they got rendered, but I still can't manage attachments properly, use a drawer as in org-mode and so on.
 My dream? Simply a note-taking solution that allow FULL Emacs/org-mode features but out of a flexible solution that allow dynamic result buffers out of queries, like notmuch/mu for emails, like ekg for notes and so on, because while text is super flexible is still also limiting in some aspects.
 The purpose of this post is reiterate this long running not so accepted but definitively felt topic on notes seeing the regular evolution of tools who try to be kind-of query-driven (like search&narrow vs menus/taxonomies) and periodically fail to complete the game. I hope a day enough people would accept such storage concept and we will finally see an Emacs-based storage who is actually a kind of DB directly managed in Emacs, with of the flexibility of a DB and the power of elisp. Oh, and I hope to be clear in this quick description as well!

 Is they any particular reason it is not on public package repos?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just a moment ago, I was working on some statistics homework. And it was all just boring rote confidence interval calculations. Mostly busy work. After doing about two problems, I wasn't satisfied with the pace at which I was completing the homework, so I fired up GHCi in my terminal. In theory, what I am describing here can be done with any language with a REPL, but Haskell's syntax makes for extremely fast prototyping (in my opinion).
 First I created a function that would map some common confidence intervals to it's corresponding z-score. I.e. 0.9 -> 1.645. Took 10 seconds.
 Next I created a function that would take some sample mean as an argument, number of samples, and variance as an argument and it would return a function which, when given a z-score, will return a tuple that represents my confidence interval. 
 Next, plug and chug. A homework that could have taken me an hour and a half took me 15 minutes. Next step is to integrate it with LaTeX so it will automatically write out the answers for me :) 
 Maybe this is a trivial example but I was just really impressed with the ease and speed with which I could quickly slap together a "custom" calculator and start plugging in the values I care about.

 - I then work into a small description and some checklists - [ ] that I need to work on.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am in the process of configuring Emacs as my daily driver and love org-mode so far!One of the most important tasks for me is creating LaTeX documents (reports, papers, exercise sheets, proposals, ...)I like how literate programming works for my Sage worksheets and would like to also incorporate it into my document writing with LaTeX for boosting the org-component of creating such documents.
 Obviously (at least for me as a layman), I want to have multiple LaTeX codeblocks, say for different sections of my document. My first codeblock contains the header and a \begin{document}. However, when I do not write \end{document} into the same codeblock, Emacs appears to not accept the codeblocks end #+end_src and throws an error on running org-babel-tangle. If I include an additional \end{document} in the first codeblock, all LaTeX codeblocks in my orgfile are recognised as such on tangling and correctly exported. Then, however, I have to go into the generated TeX-file and delete the superfluous \end{document} from the export of the first block manually. That does not feel right.
 Is there an elegant solution to that problem? In particular, how may I allow a codeblock to be exported properly by org-babel-tangle, even if it contains environments that are not properly closed in the same codeblock?
 PS: As far as I understood from a simple web search, org-export does not deliver what I want without additional setup, as I basically want to write a LaTeX file and manage the org stuff around it without exporting it.

 These fib implementations come from a 2010 mailing list: https://mail.haskell.org/pipermail/haskell-cafe/2010-October/084538.html.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am trying to my tasks in the file that are not done and have both a deadline and a scheduled date.
 When I create the dblock to capture the column view, it works fine. ```
 +BEGIN: columnview :hlines 1 :id global :max-level 3
 ...
 +END:
 ``` Following this page: https://orgmode.org/manual/Capturing-column-view.html.
 But when I try to add a filter using match or exclude-tags, it doesn't create the table, and instead shows the column view as if calling org-columns on the entire file.
 ```org
 +BEGIN: columnview :hlines 1 :id global :max-level 3 :match "+DEADLINE={.+}+SCHEDULED={.+}-repeat/!-DONE-CANCELLED"
 ```
 What's funny is that it was working before, and I have a filtered table, but now it doesn't want to function properly. 
 Any advice?
 EDIT:
 Looks like this bit +DEADLINE={.+}+SCHEDULED={.+} is the cause of the issue.
 Anyone knows how to achieve this filter?

 ​
 I'm working on this, because it seems somewhat trivial. Initial feedback, obviously, has been negative, and I guess the package needs a parser to convert existing .hs files to use the clearly idiom instead.
 ​
 The intended use is to make Haskell readable for newbies, when I think everyone reading this is at the level wherein, excepting maybe `timesDo`, none of the functions are necessary.
 ​
 
 ​
 And to be totally honest, this is 100% a clone of Flow, taylorfausak's extremely popular (sarcasm) operator library, except deliberately using semi-verbose function names instead with declarative programming / readability being the aim.

Thought for the week
In the classic Greek sense, we should make more time in our lives for leisure. Slow productivity is a combination of incremental work and tangential work. It is incremental because it is made of micro-actions accumulating over time. Tangential, in the sense that it sometimes is work or play that seems unrelated but actually moves the needle forward. A walk in the woods might be an example of tangential productivity.
Writing has taken priority. My course assignment is to write a creative non-fiction essay modeled after the works we discussed in class. My Zk has been a joyous and surprising resource for ideas. I'm using my ZK by creating search queries and using the highlighting feature to find where I've already written answers to the query in my own voice. They become snippets directly into my essay. In a sense, I've already written my essay. I just have to find all the pieces and put them together. In truth, this is only a first draft and still needs work.
What I've found to be key steps to creating a rough draft.
—
My review routine has again surfaced something wonderful in my ZK. I had no idea I was curating ideas on the value of practice. I started a secondary hub with 18 entries, hung off of the main hub titled The Art Of Living A Good Life [[202105102006]]. 

  
Basic learning preps. What am I doing that is practice? How else do I expect to improve unless I practice? The best continue practicing even after achieving success to push themselves, not become complacent, and reach new heights. Practice Different - by Stephen Vafier - Carolina Stories

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Struggling with understanding what a monad is, I asked chatGPT to explain what a monad is in cowboy lingo, hoping that it would make the explanation easier to understand. Is he right when he says that: 
 ​
 ```
 A monad in programming is made up of three parts, also known as the three laws of monads:
  
Unit (also known as "return" or "pure"): This is the function that wraps a value into a monadic context. In cowboy terms, you might think of this as the cowboy who rounds up a calf and brings it into the corral.
 Bind (also known as "flatMap" or "chain"): This is the function that applies a function to a monad and returns a new monad. It allows you to chain operations on the monad. In cowboy terms, you might think of this as the cowboy who takes a calf from the corral to the branding iron, then from the branding iron to the castrator, and so on.
 Associativity: This is the law that says the order in which you chain the operations with the bind function should not matter. In cowboy terms, you might think of this as the cowboy code that says you should always ride in the direction of your destination, no matter what order you do your chores in.
  
Together, these three parts make up the monad. In cowboy terms, you might think of it like a group of cowboys who work together to round up and process cattle. Each cowboy has a specific job to do, and they follow a set of rules to make sure they get the job done right.

It is what it is, in any case. But before I consider using the software, I want to get a realistic idea of what's going on in a descriptive sense, without judgement. It seems on a superficial view that the project has slowed down quite significantly. The latest release was in April of 2022, currently open bugs seem to be fixed or even considered at a very slow pace, whereas in the past a lot of bugs have been closed swiftly.
 Has org-roam simply reached a state of maturity, where the main functionality works fine and is stable, such that everything else is either details or some minor stuff that's hard to fix? Or has development and improvement stalled involuntarily because the maintainers don't have a lot of free time to put into the project? Any insight is welcome.

 I kindly ask community for a feedback. What should be fixed, what have I forgot to mention in three written texts? Why an isomorphism of a corepresentable functor is called `tabulate` in `representable-functors`?
 In next post I will try to cover monoidal functors, second next will be devoted to monoids in all three defined monoidal categories.

 All the advanced and experimental features are now hidden behind the --power launcher option, as was already the case for the scala distribution for a while. This includes things like package, publish and others. So to package something, you'll now have to :
 scala-cli --power package . 
 Of course, the power mode can also be set globally.
 scala-cli config power true 
 Other notable changes include:
  
support for script inputs with no file extension via the shebang sub-command
 support for JSON exports of project configuration
 dropping ammonite imports syntax
 improving the readability of individual sub-commands' --help and --full-help outputs
 and more, refer to the release notes for details

 Apparently this course lectures are "published" every week since the 30th January 2023 and will end up with 17 Lectures (currently 8 are available)
 This course was already completely available in 2021 and 2022.
 But every year he removes the videos "I'll be releasing the videos week by week as my class for Nottingham students progresses. They are the same videos as previously with some minor updates."
 The YouTube videos are either one or two years old so i just think he unlists them. Even the lectures slides are already available A few people had the same problem last year So I wanted to ask if someone knows where the lectures are still hosted? I really prefer this course over the other introduction resources, but I only have the next week off so I want to watch them soon.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone. I've recently tried out Emacs and enjoyed it a lot, but I can't seem to get my color scheme working, no matter the many different methods I use.Before, in Vim, I set it to use my terminal(st) colors, and I was very happy with that. A picture of what a .cpp file looks like is below.
 https://i.imgur.com/C3R6Ikv.png
 I use Emacs Gui mode, and I was looking to use these terminal colors, but I can't find a way to port the Vim colors over(even though they are terminal colors). I've tried creating my own Emacs color scheme(using autothemer), but the lack of faces for some things prevent me from fully creating the theme, and my lack of knowledge about Emacs Lisp is hindering me as well.
 I'm not sure how st(suckless terminal) and/or Vim uses the colors specified in the st config, but I think it is Xresources-related. Below is a picture of the 16 colors I use in my st config.
 I am considering porting this over to Vim(as these seem to be somewhat general) and then to Emacs, but again, I have no idea how these colors are used and applied.
 https://i.imgur.com/FAEcuer.png
 (I can't remember when I made the theme, but I believe it was based on something online, but I'm not sure how prevalent it is)
 In the end, any pointers on how to implement this theme in Emacs or anything about the way st uses these colors will help greatly(or any other places I should cross-post this in). Once I figure out how to use this color scheme in Emacs in beyond, I plan on releasing it or such, as I think many might find it interesting.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm curious about using org-mode for language learning (currently working on Spanish, German, and French). Particularly, I'm trying to build up vocabulary as well as try my hand at reading / translating.
 In the past, when I was translating, I worked in a cryptpad and just wrote the translation in another text color and then went back to make corrections in yet another color. It was pretty time consuming. I've used org-remark for annotations on text and think it would be a good tool for this purpose. But maybe others have experience and suggestions for other tools or workflows.
 As for vocabulary, I think I'd like to do spaced repetition flashcards. I had used Anki for awhile, but it eventually got overwhelming. I couldn't really make a habit out of it.
 I haven't used any flashcard tools in org yet. Preferably I'd like something easy to use. I'm also wondering how to get vocab lists into org. It might be educational to do it by hand but I would prefer an automated solution, especially since I'm looking for "top 1000+ common words" lists. For example, taking an Anki set and converting to org. 
 Any suggestions and tips are appreciated.

The Vertico-based completion stack is gaining popularity, but there is no easy way to refer to the whole thing. Just "Vertico" doesn't tell the whole story, while "Vertico + Orderless + Embark + Consult + Marginalia" is quite a mouthful.
 For example the way this question is phrased, the technically correct the answer would be "little to none". Vertico itself offers no feature parity with the aforementioned alternatives. The answer the OP actually expects is about the advantages of the whole stack, but that increases the friction as it requires convincing everyone interested that each part of the stack is worthwhile (and often just plainly needed), even though originally they only planned on using Vertico.

 For example: the device is offline but I asked to access a file on a WebDAV server. Emacs already showed me that file previously so it shows me a cached copy of that file.
 Another example for writing: I'd like to write on a file using TRAMP. The device is offline, so Emacs will store this modified file for later and save it whenever it is possible.
 This is basically synchronization but done on Emacs, i guess. Is it possible?
 EDIT: Logseq, a famous notetaking app, has implemented an interesting sync mechanism that tells you if a file has been synced or not. Can someone like this be made in Emacs?

 I have other custom-id links in my org-file which work fine (that's where I yanked the properties from)
 Any ideas what's happening?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been an org-mode as my organisation tool, and emacs as my "OS" as a "beginner" for 2+ years. I happily use Org to do some GTD-alike organisation, and to collect my thoughts on topics in Org-Roam.
 **tldr;** I'm trying to dynamically generate org-headings for each (new) subdir of a directory. I think a shell script is the best way to achieve this (so it can run independently of an open emacs session) - but may be wrong. In any event I don't script very often and am very confused.
 *What I'm trying to do:*
 I edit video for fun. 
 I use syncthing to sync my scratch (editing) folder and my org-files across two machines:
  
my old i7 machine (effects and rendering); and 
 my dual boot surface go (basic and on-the-go editing, footage ingestion etc).
  
I work on my org-files in DooM emacs on those machines and orgzly / logseq (for roam) on my android phone (occasionally using termux too, but not if I can help it).
 My video editing software creates a folder for each video project. As a result I have a folder structure like `~/scratch/live_projects/video_X`
 I'm getting to the stage where I need to use notes in org-mode to keep track of various aspects of videos (scripts, b-roll, assets etc).
 It would be lovely if each time I create a project (and a directory is generated) it would pop a heading into my org-file where I could keep notes. 
 *What I've done so far:*
 I've managed to manipulate an org-file checklist using shell scripting in Tasker (on my phone). Mostly just checking / unchecking boxes via a menu. E.g. using sed to replace `/]` with `X]`.
 I'm struggling to google how to interact with directories in bash:
  
When I google the answer to this as keywords Org and Directory together get me lots of hits. 
 Maybe I need a better boolean search fu - but that is a different question.
 
 I also use fish, so when I test I hit `$(...) is not supported`. 
  
So as you can see, not much progress has been made.
 Any pointers would be greatly appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A while back, I started to transcribe my mother's old recipes written on 3×5" note cards into a digital format. Portability is important to me, as I wanted to be able to send them to friends and family and not have to worry about apps needed to view them. I initially opted to write them in Markdown. Then I became an Emacs user. 🤩 I like the idea of being able to write the recipes in org files and exporting to whatever format convenient for family, like perhaps PDF. Hosting a little website for them might be a neat project for a future date.
 ​
 I installed org-chef, but as far as I can tell, it's meant for scraping recipes from websites. I don't need functionality to adjust proportions, either. Being able to generate a shopping list might be useful someday, but it's not currently something I need to do. I've written a few recipe files in org-mode, but I'm not sure if this is the mode I should be using. I also experimented with using markdown-mode, but wouldn't it be better to write in another mode and export to Markdown? I'd prefer to have the recipes in separate files, rather than one big file, but I'm open to good reasons why I might not want to do that.
 ​
 I'm currently writing them with a few keywords and some tags for metadata. I searched a lot online, here on reddit, as well as asked ChatGPT (it worked well till it gave me a bunch of what seems to be incorrect advice 🫠), about how to create a basic template, but I haven't been able to figure out how to do it on my own. I'm currently using a file that I fill my stuff into and then save with a new name. That works well enough, but it seems to me like there'd be a more elegant way to do it.
 ​
 So, that's where I'm at. Part of me is starting to wonder if I should instead try to learn some database software for this... Though I really only want to be able to search for titles and basic tags, so a database sounds like overkill. Any advice and direction pointing is appreciated.

 I would like to share with you my humble project - library for creating and managing tray icons Emacs-Appindicator.
 ​
 https://preview.redd.it/yn9vdccnqkja1.png?width=532&format=png&auto=webp&s=b90dfa4f2e477d10b79ec7751d0a8a8e430e9217
 ​
 You can hide/show icons, labels, create context menus with lisp callbacks for each menu item. The library uses svg-lib so you can use icons from various online collections supported by it. Under the hood it has tiny daemon, written in C that interacts with system tray via libappindicator. So, at least for now, the only supported OS is Linux.
 I planned to keep minor modes in separate repo - Emacs Appindicator Modes. For now there is only icon for pomm.el , but I plan to add more useful packages soon.
 I will be glad to hear your thoughts about package. Also I suppose it is the good time to change something in api, so if you have any idea - please share it!

 I want to use some of my org-roam files like a “database” (not in the strict sense), to keep some metadata about my files. 
 In this spirit, I want to save in the PROPERTIES drawer some information, which I want to put it in a table. My idea is to do the same process with several files and copy/paste those small tables into another (a large one) with all this information.

 What I have tried:
  
open the submodule transient with o
 specify the --recursive infix with r
 sync all submodules with c-u s
 init all submodules with c-u p
 update all submodules with c-u u
  
This effectively does the same as the git submodule update --init --recursive, but requires 3 separate commands, each with a prefix argument.
 I'm looking for a way to create another entry in the submodule transient (under the "All modules actions" section) to run git submodule update --init --recursive. If that can't be done, is there a way to more easily run all three commands (sync, init, update)?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all! 
 I'm a beginner in emacs configuration. Please excuse me if the answer here is obvious, but I am unable to find the solution online :/ I am having trouble configuring org-roam-dailies. I want each daily note to be pre-populated with the contents of a template file. My current configuration is as follows: 
 ```elisp
 (defun note-path (subpath) (let ((note-directory "/Users/<MY_USERNAME>/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/notes")) (file-truename (concat note-directory subpath))))
 (defun org-template (filename) (note-path (concat "/templates/" filename)))
 (use-package org :ensure t)
 (use-package org-roam :ensure t :config (setq org-roam-db-update-on-save t) (setq org-roam-directory (note-path "/")) (setq org-roam-dailies-directory "") (setq org-roam-dailies-capture-templates '(("d" "default" entry (org-template "daily-note.org") :target (file+head "%<%Y-%m-%d>.org" "#+title: %<%Y-%m-%d>\n")))))
 ```
 My issue specifically is with the last statement: setq org-roam-dailies-capture-templates. I expect this to read the content of daily-note.org and create a new note with this as the content. However, it simply creates an empty note. I have ensured that the value of (org-template "daily-note.org") is correct; substituting it for an absolute path (e.g. ~/test.org) behaves the same way. 
 Are any of you kind people able to see where I'm misunderstanding?
 EDIT: fixed code formatting

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Usually C++ source files automatically set c++-mode, but every once in a while I have a source file that does not. Today, I wanted to find out, but I'm a bit of an emacs noob, so I turn to you!
 From my experiments it seems to have to do with the filename. I have a bunch of identical files containing some c++ code:
 [~] $ cat importfromdesktop.cpp #include <iostream> int main() { return 0; } [~] $ md5sum *.cpp 1824f46236ad646997b49e6414e1ed10 importfromdesktop.cpp # no good 1824f46236ad646997b49e6414e1ed10 importfromdeskto.cpp # no good 1824f46236ad646997b49e6414e1ed10 importfromdesk.cpp # no good 1824f46236ad646997b49e6414e1ed10 importfromd.cpp # no good 1824f46236ad646997b49e6414e1ed10 importfrom.cpp # WORKS! 1824f46236ad646997b49e6414e1ed10 importfro.cpp # WORKS! 1824f46236ad646997b49e6414e1ed10 importfr.cpp # WORKS! 1824f46236ad646997b49e6414e1ed10 fromdesktop.cpp # no good 1824f46236ad646997b49e6414e1ed10 verylongfilenamehereman.cpp # WORKS! 
 When opening the first importfromdesktop.cpp, c++-mode is not started (this was the original filename that was problematic, when I copied the file's contents to a main.cpp it worked, so I started testing the filename).
 I kept removing a letter from the end and starting from importfrom.cpp, c++-mode would engage. So I thought maybe it has to do with the filename length? But testing doesn't show that either.
 Nothing different shows in the messages buffer in all these cases. How do I debug this?
 Thanks!

Client defines orphan instance. If a package defines an orphan instance, it MUST depend on the minor version of the packages that define the data type and the type class to be backwards compatible.
  
I don't really understand why this is required. Can anyone understand this?

 Neorg (Neo - new, org - organization) - https://github.com/nvim-neorg/neorg
 Its description says it's a is a Neovim plugin designed to reimagine organization as you know it. Grab some coffee, start writing some notes, let your editor handle the rest. 
 The first point of its philosophy is to
  
 Revise the org format: simple, extensible, unambiguous. Will make you feel right at home. Alternate markup formats have several flaws, but the most notable one is the requirement for complex and slow parsers. What if we told you it's possible to alleviate those problems, all whilst keeping that familiar feel? Enter the .norg file format, whose specification can be found here. The cross between all the best things from org and the best things from markdown, revised and merged into one.

 I've implemented a small prototype of type-safe remote hot-code swapping using Arrow-based (or more accurately, Cartesian-category-based) state machines of type input -> state -> (state, output):
 https://github.com/stevana/hot-swapping-state-machines#hot-swapping-state-machines
 The readme is written a bit like a blog post and contains code for how hot-code swapping is done in Erlang, how it's done using the prototype, implementation details and a couple of ideas for possible extensions and refinements.
 I hope you find it interesting and I'd be curious to hear your thoughts!

I'm not sure what is happening, since using SPC h ' shows they have org-hide as face and only those in headings multiple of three have this issue. Any tips on how to find the cause of the problem?
 ​
 Some headings have their \"bullets\" showing wrongly
 org-hide-emphasis-markers does not change the situation. Even when using describe-char, it says the asterisks are being shown as just the background.
 ​
 describe-char of the two incorrect asterisks in each heading.
 Some things point towards emphasis markers, Only the headings which have a multiple of 3 asterisks suffer from this problem, the middle asterisk is higher than the other two (although no boldness is indicated by describe-char), the left one and the last one in the affected lines are a little closer to the middle one and not centered.
 I have no idea on how to pursuit this problem... any tips?

 If I would implement this naively, I would just keep a buffer with original text in latin alphabet, while only showing to user transliterated form.
 But I am asking because there is a chance something which does the job has already been implemented?

 I've been working on the ekg package, the Emacs Knowledge Graph. Simply put, it's a note-taking system, but also a system that can store lots of kinds of interlinked data, not just notes. Here's a few things at a glance to know about it:
  
Stores all data (including the note) in a sqlite database
 Uses a "triple" schema, which is a way to store a variety information as a graph favoring extensibility, ease of introspection, and two-way links between data, but not maximizing efficiency
 Uses tags instead of in-buffer links and backlinks, where tags can be multi-word
 Notes have no title, so in general small notes are easier in this system
 Designed to be easy to integrate with; so if you want to auto-generate notes when, say, you finish an org task, that's trivial to write

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I already tried to explain why the Haskell/JS story currently IMHO sucks: https://old.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/115csmc/my_main_beef_with_haskelljs/
 But it turns out that it won't suck for much longer, and the reason is that "foreign export" is coming. I wasn't aware of this. Please accept my humble apologies. https://engineering.iog.io/2023-01-24-javascript-browser-tutorial/
 Here is why Haskell/JS won't suck anymore after "foreign export" is here:
  
I will be able to code a standard HTML/CSS website that mostly works even on text-based browsers and Tor Browser without JS enabled. Users of text-based browsers will get graceful "<foo.jpg>" placeholders. To code this website, I will obviously use Haskell on the backend.
 If the user has JS enabled, I can have a link on the site that says "activate interactive JavaScript features (5 MB download)". It is IMHO incredibly disrespectful to activate this mode by default, shoving something down the user's throat he didn't ask for. (Maybe the user is running a slow computer, or e.g. Qubes with lack of nice GPU integration and prefers the simple site because it has all the needed info.)
 Once clicked, a nice download indicator now spins for half a second.
 Boom!!
 The JS parts are now live. Static JPG images (previously rendered on the server) have turned into interactive HTML canvases with websockets support. A text counter that previously required a website refresh is now updating live through websockets. And so on.
  
This is the way. This is the future. This is the only way to stop the web from becoming an increasingly ugly place. (If you don't get it - if you e.g. really believe the new Reddit is better than old.reddit - you're lost and beyond saving IMHO, sorry.)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ok so I have a bit of a mystery. On one of my computer's Emacs installs, if I type an ampersand it gets underlined and shows what I assume are completions in the modeline. Annoyingly, it completes them without confirmation. So if I type &ke it gets replaced with け. This is really annoying when typing &key in Common Lisp since it gets replaced with けy. And oddly, it only happens on one of my computers, despite me sharing my .emacs folder between my computers using a git repo.
 I have no idea what this is or how to turn it off. I can't find anything about it online, and I'm at a loss as to how to find it within emacs (helpful-key says the ampersand is a self-insert-command, and pressing C-h while the ampersand is underlined exits out of whatever this is).
 What do?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've written an extensive series (link) about various aspects of binary search, starting with the basics but then going quite a bit deeper, all in Scala. Each part addresses a separate topic, hopefully as a bite-sized chunk.
 Just to set appropriate expectations, this series is not about Scala--it's about binary search--so I've tried to make the code as readable as possible even to people who don't know Scala, which means that there's a lot of imperative loops. (But higher order functions do show up starting in Part 6.)

 I'm not a native English speaker so I'm a little bit confused about it, even though I know it is a trivial thing. It's just a placeholder that gets replaced anyway with typed text. I was wondering if "title" is more appropriate, though.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I'm planning to set up an Emacs configuration for somebody writing books and stories who is not familiar with technology that much.
 There are nice looking distraction-free setups with https://github.com/joostkremers/writeroom-mode or https://github.com/rnkn/olivetti or https://github.com/joaotavora/darkroom or https://github.com/rougier/nano-emacs
 However, as far as I've read (I haven't set up them except nano), they do not offer a very reduced and visually appealing recentf-open-file alternative.
 I'm thinking of a screen that pops up when booting Emacs that only shows the files I was working on recently in large font (maybe as buttons to click on). The file extension should be hidden, so that I may use it with Orgdown files that have long, descriptive file names (most probably within the same directory).
 Something like:
  
The Picture of Dorian Gray (that points to "The Picture of Dorian Gray.org")
 1984
 Notes about The Picture of Dorian Gray
 ....
  
Does that ring a bell for anybody here? Is there some similar functionality out there?
 Bonus for support for an easy to use file creation process like "add a new book", "add new notes", "add new short story" in combination with, e.g., a template mechanism. 
 Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[hello everyone, currently i work on doom emacs and sometimes i switch to another distro like prelude or just vanilla to experiment and i have noticed that there is certain setting i want in all distros i.e. config indepently of a distro. So I would like to know how you handle this situation and also what cloud service you use for that. I want to have my configuration files in the cloud for fast setup in others computers. Is GitHub good for that?, what would be a great approach?

 It doesn't have any non-closed or wrongly nested tags, but the escaping isn't handled correctly.
 E.g. it has:
 <manufacturer>Procter&Gamble</manufacturer> 
 ... where the & symbol is not escaped correctly (thus "expected a semi-colon after the reference for entity" error).
 I don't control the companies generating those XMLs so I cannot influence the data quality or format at the source.
 Some of the files have![CDATA[ and proper escaping and some don't.
 I currently use xs4s.XML.loadString to parse it to scala.xml.Elem.
 I also tried to use ruippeixotog/scala-scraper to handle it as XHTML but some of the tags are <link> which are considered as empty tags by JSoup so it lost the data in them.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I have been using org mode for notes but I never used or understood the todo list features.
 Now I am trying to use org for todo lists, but having trouble fitting to my mental model. Maybe it can be configured, or you can tell me why my approach is wrong.
 What I tried is (foolowing tutorials) to make some tags HOME,WORK,then make some project topics in an outline like
 * TODAY ** TODO ask reddit // tag this with @HOME * TOMORROW ** TODO finish that thing * WEEK * SOMETIME * IMPORTANT ... 
 ​
 In this view, the tags are "where", and the list provides "what".I can easily move items from IMPORTANT to TODAY using C-c C-w.I can filter by home or work. Good so far.
 Now, I would like to see an adjenda view that shows at least the TODAY view, and hopefully a view of selected other categories. However, this requires assigning dates. I don't want to do that because dates do not mean much. In fact I rarely need to think about dates. I look at the calendar and note that something is due on "Wednesday", not caring about the date.
 a) my TODAY list is a "goal" not a contract. Some days I will make a list, then learn of an unexpected task will change everything, with no time to get back to the org mode undil end of day. And most days I find that I do not complete everything on TODAY's list. I want those uncompleted things to automatically carry over to tomorrow's version of "TODAY".
 b) I will use a calendar for things that have a particular associated time.
 c) I do not want to waste time deleting dates and adding new dates that mean little,or constantly moving tasks from one date to the next. Just leave them under TODAYuntil either they are done, or I move them to another category like SOMEDAY.
 In short, I think I do not want the calendar features for now, just a todo-list sorted by categories and with a configurable view and hot ckeys.
 Is this possible? Or, what _should_ I be doing?
 Thank you for your advice (and note that I really am a beginner).

Currently, I would have to create a new note in my org roam directory, and then copy the Apple notes text into it and save it. As for the images, I would have to store them in some directory and make a reference to it in my org file. Is there already a way to automate the whole procedure?
 It doesn't have to be about moving notes from Apple notes to Org files. I believe the process would be similar for moving notes from words to Org as well.

 I went into some basic Scala material and now I am trying to solve Leetcode problems that I solved before using Python to get more used to Scala. The question I have is about the Two Sum problem. I am submitting the following solution and getting a compile error.
 ​
 object Solution { def twoSum(nums: Array[Int], target: Int): Array[Int] = { var res = Array[Int](2) var idxs = Array[Int](2) for ((num, index) <- nums.zipWithIndex) { var remainder = target - num if (remainder == num) { for (j <- 0 to (nums.length - 1)) { if (nums(j) == remainder) { // idxs += j idxs :+ j } if (idxs.length == 2) { return idxs } } } else if (nums.contains(remainder)) { // res += i res :+ index // res += nums.indexOf(remainder) res :+ nums.indexOf(remainder) } if (res.length == 2) { return res } } } } 
 The error
 Line 8: error: type mismatch; (in solution.scala) found : Unit required: Array[Int] for ((num, index) <- nums.zipWithIndex) { ^ 
 I don't understand why i am getting it. I understand that the return is not an Array as expected. However, both res and idxs are arrays. Any help will be appreciated, thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I see compiler (and flymake) errors of this sort all the time. Consider the common pattern:
  
A.el - main code, requires and uses a.el.
 a.el - a “module” or component of a.el. Its only entry anywhere is via being required and used in A.el. Makes use of some of A.el's functions and variables.
  
How to handle this dependency to try to satisfy the compiler:
  
Non-solution: obviously you cannot (require 'a) in A.el and (require 'A) in a.el.
 Just forget about it and put a.el inside A.el. Leads to large and harder to maintain files.
 defvar nil and declare-function everything that the compiler complains about in a.el. I see this a lot. Ugly, hard to maintain.
 Just ignore the compiler warnings. Lots of people do this, alarms users, encourages ignoring linters.
 Factor out the bits of A.el you need in a.el into some A-common.el and require it in both places. Maintenance headache.
  
What I want is to tell the compiler: this feature will only be required in A.el, which is its parent. I do not require it, it requires me. Compile me after compiling my parent, and consider its symbols as fully available to me.
 Anybody have a better strategy?

 I'm realizing more and more that I prefer the flexibility of modal editing. That being said, I'm really enjoying the robustness of emacs in many other ways. I know evil mode exists, but I also don't want to just turn emacs into Vim, and it seems like evil swings too far in that direction.

 Basically, it’s just Evil-easymotion, purged of evil.
 My take: think of a movement command, like forward-word. Rather than repeating that command four times to go four words forward, you can turn that into a holymotion/easymotion, and press a single, home-row character, and jump straight there. For those familiar with Avy, it’s much the same(and uses avy under the hood), but generalized to work with any movement command, and the ability to restrict the scope of an avy motion to look only within some lisp object, like a buffer, a sentence, or a line. This will tend to give you short, usually one/two-character targets. In my…]]></summary>

 Org-mode is a highly versatile and powerful tool for organizing notes, tasks, and documents. While it was originally developed for use with the Emacs text editor on Unix-based operating systems, it can be used on other platforms as well, including Microsoft Windows.
 However, using Org-mode on Windows can be more challenging than using it on other operating systems for several reasons:
 Emacs installation: Emacs, the text editor used to run Org-mode, is not included in Windows by default, so users need to install it separately. This can be a complex process, especially for users who are not familiar with command-line interfaces or Unix-based software.

At first it happened on my urxvt terminal, and then I tried on st terminal, the problem is still there. Some times the characters are a few ones scattered on the screen, some times they align in a line, and you can't select and delete them. They only disappear when you close and reopen the buffer. I also didn't find there is an operation pattern that triggers this. Anyone knows why, and how to solve this problem? thank you very much.

 * REPEAT Weekly Review - [ ] checklist here * Captured - Captured stuff * Personal :@personal: ** House stuff *** NEXT Task 1 *** TODO Task 2 ** PROJECT Title of Project *** WAITING Task 1 *** TODO Task 2 * Work :@work: ** Category 1 *** Task 1 *** Task 2 
 I read that splitting up Org files is not always a smart idea. I was thinking if I should put all them in one file and eventually create "custom agenda views" to separate the personal and work tasks in case things start to get crowded.

 That would enable one to have a canvas in a buffer that you could draw or hand write in. Excalidraw seems to be svg based, so you can put links, search text, etc. 
 I could live with a way that showed a preview of svg in emacs, but clicking on it would open it in a browser for editing, as long as the svg is locally stored. 
 Any ideas?

 To scratch a personal itch, I created a little package that integrates perspective-el into the built-in tab-bar.
 Emacs showing perspectives as tabs in the tab-bar
 Adding and removing perspectives using the 'x' and '+' buttons just works.
 It's not on any repo yet, as I'd like some feedback first ;)
 You can find it here: perspective-tabs
 Let me know what you think!
 addition:
 Credit where credit is due: 
 When building this, I had a long hard look at Bufler by alphapapa, especially the implementation in bufler-workspace-tabs.el
 I'm only hacking, while sitting on the shoulders of giants. Thanks! \m/

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My current opinions (subject to change):
  
Most websites should mostly work without JS enabled. (In fact, they should mostly work even on text-only browsers.)
 Most "single page apps" (SPAs) could easily be ordinary websites that mostly work without JS enabled.
 Most SPAs therefore suck (because of the fact that they are SPAs to begin with).
 Calling Haskell functions it not possible from the standard JS/DOM on an ad-hoc basis, is it? (Only in this way is it possible to enrich a website that mostly works without JS enabled, with certain features in cases where JS is enabled.) Note: Rumors of one or two individuals doing it with some obscure trickery does not count. It should be supported by the ecosystem as a fully fledged feature.
 Therefore, you are confined to SPAs when using Haskell/JS.
 Therefore, Haskell is simply not a suitable language for web development in general and that's just the way it is. (Apps that are legitimately SPAs only are a rare minority and that's not what I'm talking about here.)
 This is precisely where PureScript shines.
  
Someone please debunk the above, because I really would love to be wrong so I could use Haskell for everything.

 In short the following code

inspirated by this thread I thought that perhaps we might be able to collect case studies successes and failures (=learning experiences!) of AI-supported knowledge work.
My hypothesis is that it is to early to move above the layer of phenomenology. The best method to access such an unknown field is trial and error.
So, I am collecting individual use cases (or perhaps even: instances). Whenever I try something I document it and leave it there. Occasionally, I will write add hypothesis to it. I will add an example to show what I mean.
If my notes on this matter reach a level that is worth publishing I will bring everything together to a document that will be available as donationware.
If you have any case study, successful interaction or failure or thoughts in general, I'd be happy if you share it.
Live long and prosper

 Then months or years later, How could refile all the done tasks under heading of Plans to GetThingsDone heading in one single command? 
 Current solution is first to use occur to popup all the done tasks "C-u M-s .*DONE.*" in a narrow to subtree window, then copy them to heading of GetThingsDone; 
 Second to delete them under Plans heading with regex in the previous narrow window.

 I checked magit-status on a different repository, and everything works as it should - it showed unstaged changes just fine.
 I turned on toggle-debug-on-error, but calling magit-status doesn't return any errors. I checked my git config and didn't see anything (I found this issue but the solution doesn't help me: https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/54041/unstaged-changes-not-appearing-in-magit-plus-other-oddities)
 Did I toggle a setting somewhere to hide the list of unstaged files? Anyone have any insight?

 Right now my custom agenda view is as roughly as follows. It shows a block labeled "Tasks" but that shows all the TODOs in tasks.org not just the ones in the short list:
  ((" " "Agenda" ((agenda "" ((org-agenda-span 'week) (org-deadline-warning-days 365))) (todo "TODO" ((org-agenda-overriding-header "To Refile") (org-agenda-files '("inbox.org")))) (todo "TODO" ((org-agenda-overriding-header "Tasks") (org-agenda-files '("tasks.org")))) nil)))

 I settled on a layout that I love:
 - Capslock as Ctrl
 - Enter (when held) as Meta.
 It's symmetrical, and feels identical whether using my macbook pro's keyboard or mechanical split keyboard with array of thumb keys which would otherwise be great modifiers. Enter still works as usual newline if you tap it.
 When navigating with something like C-f, I appreciate my left hand doesn't have to move to go from C-f to M-f.
 I use Karabiner to make this possible. 
 On macos
 .config/karabiner/assets/complex_modifications 
 Create a json file 
 (omit "conditions" - I use this to only apply this modification for built-in macbook keyboard. My mechanical keyboard is programmable and has it's own configuration to achieve this function which is a little smarter but same effect)

Unfortunately, I'm a beginner with elisp, having spotty experience with CL only. How can I really get up to speed with elisp? What path of study would you suggest? What I've seen with elisp is that it's very close -- always seems to be getting closer -- to CL -- buuuut it has its own "best practices" realm, i.e., you can't just take your CL code and CL mentality verbatim into elisp. I've also heard that the traditional An Introduction to Programming in Emacs Lisp hasn't really been updated to include the lexical scoping yet -- which is a game-changer that can't be avoided, i.e., you're learning/doing it wrong if you don't work with lexical scoping. Any ideas how to chart a course of study to become a competent elisper?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 I'm a product guy with non-prod-levels of previous coding experience (HTML/CSS, Python) and I'm learning Scala with the intent of making it the first language I'm proficient in to the degree that I can write software in it.
 Looking at the big picture - obviously Scala is multi-paradigm and sets me up for tackling a lot of different use cases by itself, but what language(s) do you consider to be the best ones for matching with Scala once I've mastered it?
 (I appreciate that the simplest answer to this is probably "Depends what you want to work on!" I'm still mulling my options in that sense, so getting a sense that 'Scala + x = Great prospects in y" would be incredibly helpful).
 Thanks!

 This can be rather confusing at a glance, as it might lead to think that I could arrange a meeting at 18:00. Moreover, it doesn't help visualizing easily how much time an activity (such as Teaching, in this case) demands. 
 How would I go from that (above) to this (below):
 Friday 12 June 2022 8:00 ┄┄┄┄┄ ┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄ 10:00 ┄┄┄┄┄ ┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄ 10:47 ┄┄┄┄┄ ← now ─────────────────────────────────────────────── 12:00 ┄┄┄┄┄ ┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄ 14:00 ┄┄┄┄┄ ┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄ 16:00 Teaching 18:00 Teaching 20:00 ┄┄┄┄┄ ┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄ 
 so I can see how much of my time is blocked by activities?
 Thanks in advance for all your help.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nothing but anecdotal data, but when a newcomer is faced with a choice between Emacs or Vscode, they will very likely choose Vscode, one of the reasons being that Emacs has a rightful reputation of having a steep learning curve. The idea of having to install a dozen packages to get modern IDE-like features and write Elisp right away in order to customize them can be daunting and overwhelming. Personally, it took me a couple of years before I even bothered to start learning Elisp to become a more advanced user.
 By providing a more streamlined and user-friendly way to customize Emacs, we can help make the platform more approachable and welcoming to new users.
 One approach could be to provide a series of customizable templates or configurations that new users could choose from when first setting up Emacs. These templates could be designed for different use cases (e.g., programming, writing, project management, etc.), and could include pre-installed packages, keybindings, and other customizations that are tailored to the user's needs. This would allow new users to get started with a powerful and customized Emacs setup without having to dive too deeply into the details of Elisp code.
 Another approach could be to provide a more user-friendly interface for customizing Emacs, such as a graphical user interface (GUI) or a set of interactive prompts that guide users through the customization process. This would make it easier for users to discover and experiment with different customization options, and would help them feel more confident and in control of their Emacs setup.
 I think we need to put some work and effort on this.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone,
 First and foremost I am super new to emacs. Specifically I am using Doom Emacs and I just got a new system up and rolling and installed Doom Emacs. I have done this many times before and have never had a problem. After Emacs is installed I usually go into the init.el to add the languages that I will be using along with editing the config.el file to change the font as well as the theme of emacs. This time I am getting an error anytime I try to open a file https://imgur.com/a/1BTOvrh - I have never seen this and I can't seem to find anything via a google search. I am sure that I haven't given enough information so if that is the case let me know and I will share anything that is needed!
 Appreciate the help in advanced.

 I started a podcast focused on Emacs and plan to release one episode a week. I've never done anything like this before, so I'm sure there's a lot of room for improvement :-). I've made a Git repository that contains the show notes, for those who aren't interested in listening to the podcast or me.
 In the fist episode, I discuss how I make use of locate, to recursively find files based on the current projects scope. You can read the episodes show notes here. Let me know if you have any questions, thanks!

 It works and displays the line number aligning correctly, but the Emacs suddenly become very very very slow.
 How could align the line number with global-display-line-numbers-mode on? (Emacs-28.2 on Kubuntu-22.10

What I need is some what of specifying (probably in a directory e.g. with project.el) that the project `*.ts` files I'm working on are in fact deno files and need to initialize lsp-mode with the deno language server.
 Does anyone have guidance for configuring lsp-mode to work in this situation? I effectively want the default to be my current configuration, using typescript-language-server. When I'm in a deno project, I want to use the deno language server.
 Here you can see my web-mode configuration specified for `*.ts` files:
 (use-package web-mode :ensure t :mode (("\\.ts\\'" . web-mode) ("\\.js\\'" . web-mode) ("\\.mjs\\'" . web-mode) ("\\.tsx\\'" . web-mode) ("\\.jsx\\'" . web-mode))) (use-package lsp-mode :ensure t :hook ((web-mode . lsp)))

 Dear all,
 I just want to send you all a quick note to let you know that we have an opening for a student internship, on-site at NASA Ames Research Center, this summer:
 https://stemgateway.nasa.gov/public/s/course-offering/a0B3d000000y6o5EAA/onsite-improving-testing-capabilities-for-cfsrosfprime
 The student, if selected, will be working on extending our capabilities to test cFS/ROS/FPrime applications, especially those using Ogma and/or Copilot for monitoring. Both Ogma and Copilot are open-source software written in Haskell.
 Applicants for this internship must be U.S. Citizens and meet a minimum 3.0 GPA requirement. Prior experience is not required. Knowledge of the following will be considered a plus: Haskell or other functional languages, C/C++, Bash, git, Docker, Linux, NASA Core Flight System, Robot Operating System, FPrime. Please note that the academic level listed in the opening is merely indicative and students at other levels (e.g., PhD) will also be considered.
 For further details, or if you have any questions, see intern.nasa.gov and the specific listing at https://stemgateway.nasa.gov/public/s/course-offering/a0B3d000000y6o5EAA/onsite-improving-testing-capabilities-for-cfsrosfprime.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I have a set of annotations and a case class as follows:
 import scala.annotation._ class GreaterThan(level: Double) extends StaticAnnotation class SmallerThan(level: Double) extends StaticAnnotations case class Quantity(@GreaterThan(0) x: Double, u/SmallerThan(1) y: Double, n: String) 
 I would like to access each field of the case class, its type, its annotation(with value) in order to do something with this information.
 Like I would like to know that there is x in Quantity, that is Double, that is annotated with GreaterThan, where the value of the annotation is 0. 
 Is there a way to achieve that in Scala? I know reflect could achieve part of what I want, mainly the fields and the types. But the annotations .. Can't find a reference for that!
 Many thanks

I want to use emacs to write all of my php code using php-mode and all the utilities it brings but the indentation is not what I want. When I type ENTER after a function I want to write the left curly brace with the same indentation as the function definition. Something like this:
 https://preview.redd.it/fmcbgnisnjia1.png?width=591&format=png&auto=webp&s=124a72aa69244a781bf6f401b191522d6003b224
 But instead when I hit enter after defining the function the brackets are like this:

 I guess php-mode is doing this but I'd like to change it. I've tried overriding the c-set-style to "linux" and many other styles but it doesn't work. Does anyone know how to do this without rejecting php-mode and use web-mode instead? I really like php-mode.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is a newb programming question, and unfortunately Googling has failed me. I see this kind of code all the time in minad's packages where an anonymous function is put inside a named function:  (defun tempel--completion-table (templates) "Return a completion table for a list of TEMPLATES. The completion table specifies the category `tempel'." (lambda (str pred action) (if (eq action 'metadata) '(metadata (category . tempel)) (complete-with-action action templates str pred))))  What would be the purpose of doing that? My guess is that the named function is later going to by applyed or apply-partiallyed, and the other function that will do the applying wants to influence the result in some variable way with an argument to the named function, and the lambda inside the named function only accepts a fixed number of arguments (because that’s how the underlying lisp code that is being hacked was written), and so there needs to be this middleman named function. 
 Am I close, or hopelessly far off? Are there any other reasons one might put a lambda inside a named function?

 Is there any good documentation or examples I can pilfer? The documentation is quite sparse.

 It only works, however, if I automaticallly execute it. How can I make it so that the desired effect occurs automatically. I have a similar issue with changing the face style of org-blocks. Thanks.

 --edit--
 The following worked...

  (defun org-fontify-proof-blocks () (add-to-list 'font-lock-extra-managed-props 'display) (let ((margin-format (format "%%%ds" left-margin-width))) (font-lock-add-keywords nil `( ("^#\\+begin_proof.*?\\(\n\\)" 1 '(face nil display " ")) ("^\\(#\\+begin_proof.*$\\)" 1 '(face nil display (,(concat (propertize "Proof."

 I'd like to make it so that the ∎ appears on the line below and is right aligned though. Any help on that would be great.

standard for package management in the OCaml ecosystem. opam’s main package

Like many other language-specific package managers (e.g. cargo, cabal, etc.), opam
performs four main tasks:
Download the sources.
Resolve the needed dependencies of a package.
Provide those dependencies such that the build system can find them.
Run the build system.
It is pretty good at this. However, there are some problems with step (4):

I end up with emphasis across manually broken lines, ie.This_lineText betweenThis_lineWill result in the line "Text between" getting emphasized. I thought by adding \n to the list of forbidden characters that this would be fixed, but it is not.
 I cannot mix emphasis properly ie.*T*his *should* be *bold* should bold "T", "should", and "bold" but instead bolds "This should"

Prolog is unique in that it's like a database where you enter "facts" into a running REPL, then do queries on those facts in the running REPL. This means a Babel, in order to be useful, must be able in one code block to add new facts to the REPL, then give answers to a code block acting as a query. Just the normal prolog-mode will only allow you to write out a database of facts in a buffer, then pose the queries in the the running REPL -- not both together. (This is not dissimilar to any other interpreted language with code and REPL separated.) Again, Babel should offer both in the same buffer.

 Tried to achieve similar behavior with the builtin whitespace-mode module but to no avail. Need to mark leading and trailing whitespace characters only, however Emacs puts space mark replacement everywhere:

 For a comparison, the same file opened in gVim, with whitespace mark only at beginnings and ends of lines:

 Is there a way to tweak whitespace-mode to not put replacement · mark outside of leadining/trailing parts? Is there an alternative 3rd party mode which can do this?

 from time to time my (spac)emacs is slow, which I try to resolve using the internal problem. However, it seldomly points me a in a useful direction. Most recently, one of the lags occurred when I tried opening an org-roam node using helm. Typing characters in helm was slow, so I profiled it
 ​
 CPU profling
 ​
 Memory profiling
 It points (unsuprisingly) to Helm and org-roam, whereas I was hoping that there is a third component involved (like a minor-mode) that's making problems.
 ​
 My question is essentially: How would you go from here to identify (and mitigate) potential underlying issues?
 Best,

 When I'm typing a method name, i.e. `this.myMethod`, when the company auto-complete kicks in, it seems that lsp-mode or flycheck decides that's a great time to check my code and point out problems, when I know full well I'm in the middle of typing a line of code.
  
Is this lsp-mode or company mode doing this?
 Can I tell it to wait a bit? Maybe until I'm done typing the symbol? Or even done typing the line?

 I'd like to speed this up and ease my pain by using a package manager, but need to find one that will let me audit package before installing them. In particular, I'd like to go through diffs of package updates in ediff, and have the option of accepting our rejecting each update instead of just blindly installing it.
 Related to this, I'd also like to have the package manager store checksums (modern ones like sha256, not just git's sha1) for every version of a package I install, so that if I need to reinstall I can be assured I don't have to re-audit the code because it's exactly the same that I audited and approved earlier.
 Are there any package managers that would fit my needs?

 I'm trying to figure out how to specify, for a particular document, how to get latexmk to build using xelatex instead of pdflatex, particularly for org-beamer.
 Right now I've got:  %%% Local Variables: %%% coding: utf-8 %%% mode: latex %%% TeX-engine: xetex %%% TeX-command-extra-options: "-xetex" %%% End: 
 But this doesn't seem to do anything, looking at the org-beamer output, it's still saying ``Run number 1 of rule 'pdflatex'. 
 From what I can see, the +latexmk option imports the auctex-latexmk package, which adds latexmk to tex-commands-list and sets it as the default. So what I'm trying to figure out is how to get the -xelatex option to latexmk from emacs.
 I've tried futzing about with .latexmkrc but it seems to ignore it

 The goal of this project is to make it as easy as possible for someone with a light coding background (e.g. some experience with Python) to pick up the core ideas of Haskell quickly, without them giving up because of the unfamiliar syntax, complex types, seemingly restrictive purity, ill-documented ecosystem, and the many choices of set up. 
 In this respect, The Haskell Guide is not a tutorial, project-based guide or textbook, which aims to give a more complete walk through the language, in a linear fashion, but more like a reference guide that is carefully designed to be accessible and clear.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I want to avoid using evil-mode and try to stick to the emacs philosophies and key-binds. Ive familiarised myself with the default Emacs bindings and found myself missing the speed of editing text Ive had in Nvim. I do realise that theres a getting used to phase, but I can foresee that even after getting used to emacs key-binds I wont match up to what Ive had in Nvim. I have currently installed avy, highligh-region packages and they have helped, but I wonder what is it that I am missing. Is there something builtin to Emacs that Im not utilising, is my overall mental approach wrong. Please share your ways, packages, philosophies of editing and navigating text in Emacs

I found it hard to use at first so I decided to try something else and I found website and as of now I have some experience with vim. I use .org for taking notes. After some months I decided, I'll once again try emacs and then I found 'evil keybindings'.
 Right now I have few questions..
  
Which keybindings should I use?
 Will I need to use default emacs keybindings even if I use evil?
 Will I need to remap a lot of keys when using default emacs keybindings?
 Is one efficient over the another or is it just personal preference?
  
Hope I made my question understandable
 Thanks in advance

 Emacs is not installed by default on these images, but can be apt-gotten. However, default image size pushes the limits of the local storage. 
 I could install jed or jove or mg, but those are great VI replacements, not lightweight emacsen. These are all that google finds for me, given a range of search terms about lightweight emacs.
  
Q: Does there exist a true emacs (not work-alike) distribution that is made lighter through the separation of formerly default package into add-on libraries? For example, for my usecase, terminal-only core with python and comint and shell modes would be all I need, so I'd like to apt-get install emacs-core emacs-shell emacs-python and avoid all org-mode, mail, gnus, ... and also the graphical UI code.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to upgrade the stack lts on one of my project (from lts-10.9 to lts-20.11).
 The project uses Persistent and Servant and I encounter the following issue.
 The following code
 ``haskell -- |Appis the monad stack used in the Servant Handlers. It wraps -- Servant'sHandlermonad in aReaderTmonad that holds the server's --Config` data. type App = ReaderT Config Handler
 type AppSQL = SqlPersistT App
 -- | Run & return a database query. runDB :: AppSQL a -> App a runDB query = asks getPool >>= runSqlPool query ``` doesn't compile anymore (with the following error message)
 ``` /home/max/devel/mae-website/server/src/Server.hs:49:22: error: • No instance for (unliftio-core-0.2.1.0:Control.Monad.IO.Unlift.MonadUnliftIO Handler) arising from a use of ‘runSqlPool’ • In the second argument of ‘(>>=)’, namely ‘runSqlPool query’ In the expression: asks getPool >>= runSqlPool query In an equation for ‘runDB’: runDB query = asks getPool >>= runSqlPool query | 49 | asks getPool >>= runSqlPool query |
 ^
 ```
 I understand that the "new" version of Persistent requires Servant Handler to be MonadUnliftIO which is not the case. I also understand that I am suppose to use acquireSqlConn somehowe (following this this), but I can't figure it out. Any ideas ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi
 So one year ago I started learning Scala. Because it's a challenge and also because I want to get to know functional programming without hopping immediately into something like Haskell. Keep in mind that my current job and all my skills are within full-stack typescript development. So Scala is definitely something else and that's also why I am so intrigued by the language. 
 But now my question is, I kinda want to move away from typescript and go the Scala way. Because I think Scala has much bigger problems to solve and the language is more mature (also because of pay).
 I am hoping to do this one year from now. I am currently learning Cats and have been reading a lot after my working hours. I recently purchased "The definitive guide" for Spark, in order to maybe spark an interest in data engineering (see what I did there).
 A lot of co-workers look weird at me when I say I have been learning scala. And they ask me why. And they think it's a waste of time (because "java is bad")
 I have been looking at jobs, and I don't see a lot of remote junior scala positions (I will be working from Belgium). As I don't have any JVM experience, I do have a passion for learning. Does this seem possible to all of you or is this a stupid idea? 
 Nevertheless, learning this language has never been a stupid idea since it has taught me so much.
 But just wanna get an opinion from some of the pros.

 For the portfolio, if I have to make, I'm thinking of some web app written in some nice looking code with cats effect like that.
 Any advice would be appreciated, thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I enjoy solving simple coding puzzles in Haskell, but I am still mostly a beginning Haskell programmer. On LeetCode, there is a problem called "First Missing Positive". The problem states
  
"Given an unsorted integer array nums return the smallest missing positive integer. You must implement an algorithm that runs in O(n) time and uses constant extra space."
  
Is it possible to create an O(n) run time algorithm in Haskell for this problem? 
 I can create an algorithm in C to solve this problem, but the only algorithm that I came up with modifies the input array which is something that I don't think I would do if I was programming for someone else.

 My problem with GHC 9 is that ,GHC 9.0 might have some bugs in it, but the going to GHC 9.4 might means less library are available to stackage.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 I am more and more in situation when I have to use compact and laptop keyboards witch chiclet keys. I have no issue with flat chiclet keyboards, except of the typical layout of the last row. 
 Two examples, the upper one is a laptop keyboard, the bottom one is a compact desktop keyboard.
 https://preview.redd.it/hgsa2xfz0yha1.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=824cc12df8fc5dce11ffeac1d4239f160d101eec
 Other features, common in Europe, are a short <shift> on the left side and a narrow two row <enter>.
 I need to figure out how to use them with emacs efficiently and possibly ergonomically. I am used to use a standard keyboard and my palm to press <Ctrl> but this clearly doesn't work here. 
 How do you type on keyboards like this? Did you change your typing habits? How do you use <Ctrl> and <Alt> on the right side next to the arrow block? What fingers do you use to press them? Do you change the keyboard or command map?
 Any hint and experience is welcomed.

 A couple of weeks ago I posted about how I think that Erlang/OTP's behaviours are more fundamental than lightweight processes and message passing when it comes to building reliable distributed systems.
 The post got a couple of comments, including one from Robert Virding (one of the Erlang creators), basically saying that one needs lightweight processes and message passing to in order to implement behaviours, even though I sketched an implementation that doesn't use lightweight processes at the end of the post.
 Anyway, this inspired me to start working on a follow up post where I flesh things out in more detail. This post quite isn't ready yet, but I've finished a first Haskell prototype implementation which I'd like to share:
 https://github.com/stevana/supervised-state-machines#readme
 As usual I'd be curious to hear your thoughts!

 I need to submit a summary of a series of events to a lawyer, and I wrote it up in an eleven page org document as it was most natural. Now I am trying to export it into a PDF file, because he is not going to know what to do with an org file or even a text file for that matter. The problem is, I need it to remain a nested outline, and not have nodes converted to headings. 
 It seems that a good approach is to export it to an HTML file first, and then convert the HTML file to PDF later. To do this, I thought about using AWK, but it would take too long to learn and perform. I was also looking at using some python with beautiful soup, which might work, although uncertain. Then, there is always the masochistic approach of editing the file by hand. I know sed might do the trick, but my sed pants are not big enough to tackle that one. 
 Help me, please...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[# This is a cross-post from Haskell Discourse; sorry for duplication.
 It is our great pleasure to announce the first OSS release of guardian, a dependency boundary constraint checker for Haskell monorepo!
 https://github.com/deepflowinc/guardian
 If you have a trouble with Haskell monorepo with increasing complexity of the package dependencies, then guardian could help the situation! It is developed at DeepFlow, Inc. and has been used almost for two years.
 With guardian, you can divide the packages into several "domains", and define the allowed dependency between those domains. Guadian will make sure that the only predefined dependencies between domains are introduced by package dependencies and report the result.
 For more details and motivation, please refer to README.
 Thanks!

 to my extra-deps in stack.yaml. Used stack --resolver lts-18.28 build to build the project. I'm getting the following error with clang. 
 z80000gn/T/ghc29668_0/ghc_1.s:3394:2: error: cryptonite > error: instruction requires: sha3 cryptonite > eor3.16b v0, v1, v0, v2 cryptonite > ^ cryptonite > | cryptonite > 3394 | eor3.16b v0, v1, v0, v2 cryptonite > | ^ cryptonite > cryptonite > <no location info>: error: cryptonite > Error running clang! you need clang installed to use the LLVM backend cryptonite > (or GHC tried to execute clang incorrectly) cryptonite > `clang' failed in phase `Clang (Assembler)'. (Exit code: 1) Progress 1/12 -- While building package cryptonite-0.29 
 So far I have used the lts-20 as resolver for my project and it worked fine. Since amaonka supports only ghc 8.10.7 I used lts-18.28 as resolver. 
 I'm using Mac m1 Monterey (12.6.2). I installed llvm@12 via brew and when I type clang --version I get the following output. 
 Homebrew clang version 12.0.1 Target: arm64-apple-darwin21.6.0 Thread model: posix InstalledDir: /opt/homebrew/opt/llvm@12/bin 
 Any suggestions on how to fix this issue?

 This isn't a question related only to Haskell, but I'm more interested to hear what you guys have to say about that and which approach is best to follow and whether you could recommend some resources for me to read and go through, thanks!

 The usage instructions are in the readme

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I have a problem with my org-habit consistency graph. Mainly, I do not understand how it works.
 I have a habit which repeats every day and I mark it "DONE" on that day if I have compeleted it. If I do not, I don't change it's state.
 I have done it for 6 times during the past 2 weeks and this is my agenda org file contents for that habit:
 * TODO EXAMPLE SCHEDULED: <2023-02-12 Sun +1d> :PROPERTIES: :CATEGORY: EXAMPLE :STYLE: habit :LAST_REPEAT: [2023-02-12 Sun 20:17] :END: - State "DONE" from "TODO" [2023-02-12 Sun 20:17] - State "DONE" from "TODO" [2023-02-11 Sat 20:17] - State "DONE" from "TODO" [2023-02-10 Fri 20:17] - State "DONE" from "TODO" [2023-02-05 Sun 20:15] - State "DONE" from "TODO" [2023-02-04 Sat 20:15] - State "DONE" from "TODO" [2023-02-03 Fri 20:15] 
 But when I open my org-agenda weekly view I see this:
 Here for example, all the days that were "DONE" are marked as "DONE" but they have different colors. I would like to see blue bar on the days that it was done and red bar for the days it was not.
 Also, could I assign different colors for different keywords?
 I would like "DONE" to be blue, "NOT DONE" to be red, "DELAYED" to be yellow and such.
 Right now, every keyword that is logged is marked as "DONE" in the consistency graph here and has different coloring even though all the states are "DONE".
 I am using Doom Emacs and org-super-agenda
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've read NixOS documentation and Nix package manager specific docs about the way to configure packages (specifically Emacs since there are sections reserved for it) and everywhere it assumes we are using a global configuration .nix file or home-manager which I'm not using since I'm on openSUSE.
 My configuration goes in ~/.emacs.d and it only picks up my early-init.el (it wasn't being picked up in ~/.config/emacs for some reason) and nothing from my init.el which includes downloading packages through package.el and I'm sensing Nix wants to manag them.
 So I'm wondering how should I configure Emacs or if Nix expects a config .nix file (and where) or if it's a bit of both ways? How do you configure Emacs if you are not in NixOS and you installed it via Nix?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello to all!
 I don't know about you, but sometimes with embark I need to insert something into the minibuffer, not the main buffer. That is, I do for example M-x cp/consult-ripgrep-with-directory (personal command that calls consult-ripgrep but asks where to search before with a folder path), and there I need a directory. So I do M-x in the minibuffer (see enable-recursive-minibuffers) and type consult-recent-file, remove the filename to get the folder name... and then I want to insert what I have in the previous minibuffer. My problem is that embark-insert only allows inserting into the main current buffer... 
 Same problem when I know that I need the path of a bookmark.
 How do you do this guys ? Have you an idea to resolve this issue ?

 It brings to mind Emacs ludicruous speed which is another way of prepping emacs configurations for fast startup.
 Would the combination of native compilation, emacs ludicruous speed and some of the features of Emacs 29 make an Emacs version of Babashka a practical thing?

 I've reinstalled my emacs with

 And this thing started to appeared above my completion ui. I use corfu, but I don't think this is caused by it. More interestingly, after I set (tool-bar-mode -1), this ui no longer appears.
 But I want tool-bar, is there any method to turn it off without setting (tool-bar-mode -1)? I've google it but I cannot find anything related.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I want to give emacs another shot. Last time I tried it, I attempted to make my own config, and I installed some packages and whatnot, along with evil mode.
 It felt really sluggish and slow, it even paused while I typed due to the LSP plugin. I didn't really like it. Plus, evil mode made the entire experience very inconsistent. I love vim keybindings, but emacs is not just a text editor, and that's kind of the appeal of it, and emacs is built around its own keybindings, so trying to force vim ones on it just makes a mess really...
 So how usable is emacs as a text editor with the default ones? Having to reach for control all the time sounds annoying, although I guess I could replace caps lock for control, since that's far more reachable. How fast are you editing text with it? Do you prefer it over vim keybinds?
 People like the guy in the "tsoding" channel use emacs without evil mode, and he can type quite fast. Any tips about this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi ! 
 I'm trying to start a scala project. I tried to setup a basic environment project: I've installed metals as a vscode extensions, and I've installed scala and sbt from coursier like official scala docs. 
 Metals create lot of directories which I don't know what the are used for. Sbt also do that when creating a project with it. It was a bit overwhelming, so I just flush those and tried to start with the simplest dev environment I could get. 
 Well, I couldn't resolve a single custom package, so I just reset the regular way metals and sbt wanted it to be. Still can't resolve custom packages, unless the file is at the project root. 
 Is it "normal" to feel lost with the dev environment, or am I missing some point ? Is there some exhaustive-ish resources you would recommand to get started with scala ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Originally posted to the emacs stack exchange here, but figured id ask here as well!
 When I narrow to a subheading in emacs, I would love for it to be displayed as if it was the top level as opposed to it staying the level it actually is.
 For example consider this tree
 * Heading 1
 ** Heading 2
 *** Heading 3
 **** Heading 4
 ***** Heading 5
 foobar...
 In my emacs displays it more like this:
 * Heading 1
 _* Heading 2
 __* Heading 3
 ___* Heading 4
 ___* Heading 5 foobar...
 And if I narrow to heading 4 it displays like this:
 ___* Heading 4
 ____* Heading 5 foobar...
 However I would like it to display like as a 'top level' header like this:
 * Heading 4
 _* Heading 5 foobar...
 And when I wide, for it to display normally again.
 I'm very new to emacs, but I haven't found anyone else with this issue when searching, which suggests that either I'm doing something wrong or everyone is fine with it as is!
 If the latter is the case, I know overlays could potentially provide an solution but I'm very new to lisp (and especially elisp) so I have no idea whether it's even possible or not.
 I'm using the following version(s) of emacs on windows. I can attach my configs if needed!

I use emacs for my text editor many times for 8 hours a day and on occasion for up to 14 hours (with breaks a couple hour break after 8 hours). I am having discomfort (not too bad, but I want to "listen to my body") using my LHS pinky now. Has anyone else had this problem? 
 I have always used caps-lock as my ctrl key, am wondering if I should be using something else. Maybe something on my right hand. Has anyone used the emacs foot-pedals? 
 Any ideas and suggestions will be appreciated.

A command line version is essential for updating some packages, etc. The custom config for doom emacs is also essential to me.
 I installed Emacs using rpm-ostree and the command line version runs fine, loading the doom configuration as it should from .config/emacs and .config/doom. But the gui version does not run well with the doom configs - the window is initially black, and it only intermittently accepts keystrokes. If I disable my configs by running emacs -Q, the window opens and responds fine, there's just no doom goodness.
 I would appreciate any suggestions!

 I looked through the code of both erc-desktop-notifications.el and erc-notify.el and neither of these packages support this feature.
 It seems that I could potentially edit the erc-notifications-PRIVMSG function from erc-desktop-notifications.el to add the desired feature, however I am not able to figure out how to detect the current channel name from this function.
 I was wondering if anybody knows of a way that this can be done.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I'm a begginer at Haskell, but lately at work I have to read and modify lots of haskell codes. The general context is you have lots of data (just imagine excel table), and the codes usually try to compute something from these data, but when data contains error, we want these computation to revert to a simpler form,
 Example: you have function that multiply a column A by 2 and put the result in a new column B, but when data contains error, I want this function to just put 0 in new column B. 
 What would be a good global strategy to modify the codes? , since there are tons of these functions, I don't want to modify them individually. Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[FYI. It looks like ruff (a pretty fast python linter) just work with flymake out of the box.
  (add-hook 'python-base-mode-hook 'flymake-mode) (setq python-flymake-command '("ruff" "--quiet" "--stdin-filename=stdin" "-") 
 If you are using Eglot, you have to add it to the diagnostic functions:
  (add-hook 'eglot-managed-mode-hook (lambda () (cond ((derived-mode-p 'python-base-mode) (add-hook 'flymake-diagnostic-functions 'python-flymake nil t)) ;; if not adding diagnostic functions to other modes just use an if ;; ... (t nil)))) 
 Also if you are in Emacs 29 shellchek just works on bash scripts. All that is needed is to enable it:
  (setq-default sh-shellcheck-arguments "-x") ; follow sourced libraries (add-hook 'sh-base-mode-hook 'flymake-mode) ; requires shellcheck 
 Hope this helps someone.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In Scheme you simply do a define for everything where you want to assign a name to a form. In CL you have many options (visit the zoo). So what is the best practice for elisp? For example I see setq, which seems generic, i.e., you can define a new symbol or update an existing one with setq (e.g., change a nil to t). So, e.g., how would I attach a name to a lambda anonymous function in elisp? Again, with Scheme it's simply put define in front of it. Once again, how much of CL do we, can we bring over to elisp?

 So I want to be able to somehow switch the 'git' user on the fly to switch between the 'git' user to push stuff to my personal GitHub repos vs my GitHub user for my work stuff.
 I have two separate GitHub accounts (one for work and one for personal stuff).
 How can I easily configure this in Emacs?
 Is this more of an Emacs config thing, or can I swap them out on the fly with the use of an interactive Hydra or something?
 Please link to any related guide if you can, since I can't seem to figure this out. Thanks!

 - Jump to definition works 95% of the times
 - Search symbol in workspace works 70% of the times and sometimes throws an overflow (?) error
 - I do not have the fancy intellij functions that find all subtypes for example or generally play with the type hierarchy
 - Many commands just fail saying that metals is not supporting the executeCommand command and I should check the capabilities of the session in which there actually is an executeCommandProvider with many commands reported available which do not work in reality
 ​
 Is metals just bad or have I possibly missconfigured it?

I had a DropBox fiasco this week. For some reason, all my zettelkaten files, on my office mac suddenly have a 3 Feb 2023 timestamp, both the modified and the created. The files on my shop laptop remain unchanged. But I'm worried and have temporarily turned off DropBox syncing. I've started a super-top-secret coding project that uses these file parameters and am worried my file's timestamps will get mucked with.
Oh well.
I spent a ton of time this week learning about manipulating python dictionaries. In the coming week, I'll be looking at html and css tools.
I'm really happy that my zettels are non-zettelkasting and life-focused.

 I'm considering which database library to use for a production system. For now I wanted to use persistent, however stumbled upon beam and it looks nicer to me. I've seen this post, however most of it is about persistent, and I didn't find how they differ in real production life. What I'm interested in is how do they compare in terms of 
  
features
 type safety
 scaling
 performance
 migrations
 productivity
 overall production readiness / adoption
  
I'm not afraid of a bit complexity, but I definitely hate TH / generated code. I'm keen on trying beam, but I'm just not sure if it's a right choice for a production system. Can someone more experienced with both libraries give their thoughts / opinions?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Over the last couple weeks while putting the treesit-auto package together it gained adoption much faster than I had expected. While I'm incredibly happy others found it useful, that also means that many assumptions in my hacky code were quickly blown apart. Also, in no small part due to my poor documentation, it was confusing to figure out exactly how/what would be supported when trying to add a new language.
 The key learning since I first tried to launch this package is that there's no reason for the grammar name in grammar.js to match the Emacs major mode, and there's a possibility that there are many "fallback" modes that should upgrade to the tree-sitter version, rather than just one. For these reasons and more, I needed to adjust the structure of how these modes are described internally alongside their grammars. As a consequence to that, some of the public functions/variables have been changed or removed. 
 I am sorry to anyone who has already picked up the package and started tweaking it. However, I think the changes will make the package more maintainable down the line, and it’s better to do this sooner rather than later. Most folks will probably not notice a difference if all you have set is treesit-auto-install and global-treesit-auto-mode. 
 Hopefully this is the last post I will need/want to to make about the package!
 TL;DR
 treesit-auto-fallback-alist no longer has any affect. If you want another language to be supported by treesit-auto, there is now a guide for contributing recipes

 and
 #+begin_src nix :noweb-ref A :noweb-ref B google-chrome-dev #+end_src

 #+begin_src nix :noweb-ref A google-chrome-dev #+end_src #+begin_src nix :noweb-ref B google-chrome-dev #+end_src 
 but this isn't very DRY and I'm fixating on this atm.
 Did a few websearches and even prompted GPT-3 but no dice. I think I need a human expert. 🙊
 # TL;DR
 For my home-manager Nix config, I am tangling a package name `google-chrome-dev` into the package listing `home.packages` (location A) and also to the `nixpkgs.config.allowUnfreePredicate` function body (location B) which just maintains a manifest of non-FLOSS packages that I want to clear for installation.

 I have to occasionally use Emacs from a Windows 11 machine to access a remote server with all my org-mode notes, my issue is that every time I try to access the server through tramp my Emacs client completely freezes and becomes unresponsive.
 I am using the following syntax for tramp: /ssh:user@server: (same issue when using sshx). I am using the version of Emacs provided at https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/ which I didn't have any problems with when using Windows 10.
 Would be very appreciative for any help, I am utterly incompetent when it comes to debugging Emacs on a non-Linux system.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all, 
 For many years, my Org workflow has depended on the Agenda's ability to display entries that have active timestamps in the :PROPERTIES: drawer. As of version 9.5.5 this is working fine for me, as it always has. 
 However, I remember a discussion on the Org developer list some months back that the developers planned to remove this feature at some point in the future. I cannot, however, locate the thread where I read that. A search of this Reddit forum does not mention this matter either. 
 So, I thought I'd ask specifically: Is it true that the Agenda is going to lose its ability to act upon active timestamps in the :PROPERTIES: drawer?
 If true, that would be very unfortunate for me. But I want to be prepared if it happens. I see nothing about this matter in the Release Notes for Org 9.6, so I surmise it's safe for me to upgrade -- for now. 
 Many thanks for reading, and to all the Org developers for Org mode, which is a work of genius.

 I started with the coursera class, however a team member told me that this class was going way too deep and that I wont be using anything learnt with it (the code is "easy" scala, without expert concepts). However, I have also been told that a team member was coding poorly because he kept coding like we would do with imperative programming (using loops and coding in a way where several lines could be simplified with one or two by programming the way scala is supposed to be used). 
 So I'm kind of stuck because I'm being told that the coursera class is going too deeply, but I still have to find a tutorial so that I dont end programming in scala like I would do with an imperative langage. What can I do ? What do you suggest ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, I've had this idea knocking around in my head for the last 5 years. It would be a great help for debugging, if the messages, warnings and errors printed to the *Messages* buffer could show where they came from!
 This is not the same as simply adding a timestamp, something much easier (https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/32150/how-to-add-a-timestamp-to-each-entry-in-emacs-messages-buffer).
 Today I am getting the following error and I have no idea where it's coming from, and it's frustrating.
 Error processing message (file-missing "Cannot open load file" "No such file or directory" "company"). [2 times] 
 That's just one of a ton of different sorts of errors over the years that were unhelpful due to lack of indication where the fault is. I've learned to write all my error messages with more background info, but we can't expect every package author to do this.
 Any ideas on the necessary architecture? I guess the C source needs a patch, but can we do it in such a way that we don't need to update the calling convention i.e. so we don't need package authors to update every message sexp in their codebases?

 But I noticed when marked as done, it does not go to the next month's last day, which in this case is 2023-02-28. So I googled some answers and the only one that I found was this: https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/31683/schedule-org-task-for-last-day-of-every-month
 Using the mentioned function:
 * TODO Pay something DEADLINE: <%%(diary-last-day-of-month '(1 31 2023))> 
 Which works perfectly, but I want it to be repeated.
 Did you guys know some way to schedule/deadline that repeats on every last day of the month?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to run Fourmolu built with the new WASM backend in GHC, where I malloc an input string in JS, send the pointer to Haskell, malloc the output string in Haskell, send the pointer back to JS, and free everything. It works as expected initially, then I run into two problems:
  
At start up, sending a really large input will show Data.Binary.Get.runGet at position 32: not enough bytes.
 When sending multiple small inputs, I eventually get RuntimeError: memory access out of bounds. I see this happening in the hs.free() JS call, the hs.malloc() JS call, or the malloc Haskell call
  
Printing out the pointers shows that the input pointer uses the same memory address every time, and the result pointer isn't continually increasing, so it doesn't seem like a memory leak. Regardless, the pointers + length are well below the size of hs.memory.buffer.
  
How do I go about debugging this? I've never worked this low-level before, and I'm not really sure how to start
 I've attached the relevant files below; am I doing anything obviously wrong?

 Anyone know when this changed, and why?
 EDIT: to partially answer my own question. I see that starting with macOS 10.15 (Catalina), Gnu Emacs was replaced with mg. Catalina was released in October 2019. I don't know anything about Mg but it seems like a neat project.
 If I were to guess the "why", I'd say it has to do with licensing?

macOS and how we can make this task easier.

Why would I want to run a NixOS virtual machine on macOS?
My colleague at Tweag, Dominic Steinitz, asked me this question after I shared
my first minor achievement in this area, and it struck me that I have never
described why exactly I run virtual machines (VMs) on my laptop and why I want
to make it easier for myself (and others).
Like many members of the Nix community – more than 25% according to the Nix
community survey – I rely on macOS to provide me a stable
shiny desktop environment. However NixOS is based on Linux and so many pieces
that are used for developing and testing it require running it in VMs. I’ll
describe some major use cases for it below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi /r/haskell. Almost ten years ago, I wrote a version of the boardgame Yinsh in Haskell. The project included a web-based frontend and a backend for the computer opponent. Everything was running just fine (on my website) until a few weeks ago when Heroku shut down its free tier, where I was hosting the backend.
 Since then, I made multiple unsuccessful attempts to resurrect the game somehow (for example: compiling either the frontend or the backend). The main problem is that I have been developing in other programming languages and ecosystems since then and I'm not familiar with the modern Haskell stack anymore. But it would be sad to rewrite the project in another language. Haskell was actually a really nice fit for this project.
 Back then, I was using Haste to compile Haskell to JavaScript for the frontend part. But now I fail to properly restore the environment to make the hastec call work. Also, I'm not sure if Haste is still actively maintained.
 The backend was 'plain' Haskell, but I have trouble setting up an environment where I can use ghc to compile the backend. I have an old .cabal file that I was apparently using to deploy the backend to Heroku, but it seems that too many things have changed since then.
 I could probably try harder to restore that old state somehow, but I think what the project really needs is some kind of ecosystem modernization. I would be very glad to hear your suggestions on how to move on. If someone is interested in the project itself, I would also love to take contributions on https://github.com/sharkdp/yinsh.
 Yinsh, by the way, is a really fun abstract board game (two player, zero sum, perfect information) which is similar to Gomoku/"Five-in-a-row". As far as I know, there is no other implementation of Yinsh out there that features an 'AI' opponent (my implementation uses a classical minimax-style search in the game tree).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey there,
 Related Setup:
  
Emacs running via WSL2 with Ubuntu on Windows 10
  
​
 Related Issue:
  
Copy text from Windows 10 and pasting into Emacs via 'C-y' Emacs keybinding totally works as intended to paste stuff into Emacs
 However, I cannot do the reverse: 
 Ex: I cannot copy and paste text from Emacs using selecting text in Emacs, hitting 'M-w' in Emacs to copy it to the clipboard buffer, and then just click 'Paste' wherever I want in Windows 10
 
  
​
 Related Research I Tried:
  
I tried referring to this guide page: 
 https://shelper.github.io/posts/setup-emacs-in-wsl2/
 
 However, the 'copy paste sharing between wsl2 and windows host' section just says you can use 'GWSL' above.
 However, I referred to that section, and found the related 'GWSL-Source' GitHub repo and its associated Windows store link: 
 https://github.com/Opticos/GWSL-Source
 https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/gwsl/9NL6KD1H33V3?hl=en-us&gl=us&cid=storebadge&ocid=badge&rtc=1
 
  
​
 Question:
  
Can anyone confirm how this works for the clipboard manager?
 From your related YouTube video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6GXBEQ5KzA), it looks like you can easily launch GUI programs from various Linux distros all from Windows 10 etc which is really really cool
 But, it doesn't really show how the clipboard functionality would work.
  
​
 Thanks!

 I was typesetting a document that I want to be exported to html and latex, and I'm using the latex package bussproofs in it (for derivation trees but the exact package is besides the point) that package, like many others is available in MathJax v3.2 but org html export uses MathJax v2.7.
 I tried customizing a bit the template so that it would load MathJax v3.2 but it didn't work(I can edit to elaborate on what I tried) so here is my question.
 How could it be done?
 Is there any reason for it to use v2 over v3?
 Thanks in advance!

 I've uninstalled emacs, installed it again, tried installing via cask, no luck. Anyone have this problem?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I experience the following anoying behavior: If the text in the minibuffer get's longer then the display width and lines are therefore continued on the next line, the minibuffer scrolling no longer works.
 What I mean by that is that it "logically" works as when I press <down> or <up> the indicator correctly displays the number of the item I am supposed to choose when pressing <RET> yet I can't visually see what I would select.
 First I thought it is a marginalia issue but that's not the case. With marginalia it only shows much more easily as marginalia adds text to minibuffer entries thus making lines longer. So this is a thing I can easily reproduce when making the whole Emacs window narrow enough to trigger continuation lines in the minibuffer.
 Seems to be an issue with the highlight line logic and scrolling? Report it as a bug?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been taking notes in org-roam and publishing them online for my own use. It's worked really well and has been immensely valuable. I did run into something today that was a puzzle--I knew I'd taken a note on a topic, couldn't find it easily and didn't have access to my home machine. My thought: I'd be fine if I could search everything for the word 'awk'.
 I'm thinking the following would be elegant:
  
Index the notes generated by org-publish using sqlite's FTS5 capability.
 Add a search field to the generated sitemap.
 Update the publishing script to copy the indexed database along with the notes.
 Write a CGI to handle the searches and link to search results.
  
Minus the CGI part it was stupidly easy to get indexing with stemming working:
 #!/bin/sh sqlite3 t.db<<EOF CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE notes USING FTS5(title, body, tokenize=porter); EOF for file in $(ls *html | grep -v sitemap) do data=$(cat $file | sed "s/'/''/g") sqlite3 t.db<<EOF INSERT INTO notes(title, body) VALUES('$file','$data'); EOF done 
 I did run into one ugly that I need an elegant idea to help solve--indexing the generated HTML leads to poor search results (e.g. searching for `awk' finds every note due to the export language boilerplate). I've had the following thoughts:
  
index the org files. Downside: this will pickup the #* lines which works poorly for some searches (e.g. session).
 use an HTML parser (e.g. Beautiful Soup) and carve content out of the generated files. Intuitively, this seems like it would be brittle.
 publish to text as well, index those and associate the results with its HTML counterpart.
 use some combinations of org-export filters to index the content.
  
As an aside, I realize there are services for this but there's no fun in that.

 Is this a result of bitrot? Or do I have weird interactions with another package?
 I've been adding debugging messages, and truly it seems that the directory variables don't get updated when you navigate across the directory tree...
 Anybody else seeing the same behavior?

 :var myvar1a=mydir/my.org:mytable1a :var myvar1b=mydir/my.org:mytable1b :var myvar2a=mydir/my.org:mytable2a :var myvar2b=mydir/my.org:mytable2b :var myvar3a=mydir/my.org:mytable3a :var myvar3b=mydir/my.org:mytable3b ... 
 etc, i would love to be able to just use
 mypythonfunction(tbls=['mytable1a', 'mytable2a']), etc 
 Or even
 mypythonfunction(tabletype='all table_a') 
 I considred merging all remoute tables in one, but it won't work cause they have different structure between types (table A, table B) and even with same type they can be a bit different. So it won't work.
 This suggestion looks promissing, but it's for local tables, is it possible to adjust it to make it work with remote files? So i can
 :var myvar=mydir/my.org 
 And then
 mypythonfun(myvar, tabletouse=''table1a") 
  
This is what i use now
 #+BEGIN_SRC python :var vara=data/my.org:table_a :var varb=data/my.org:table_b :var varc=data/my.org:table_c :hlines no :colnames no :results value table :return ttout import scripts.bimp_figures as bf ttout = bf.calcrtn (vara, varb, varc)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone, 
 I am trying to use data from a JSON to fill in an HTML template. I have decided to use hamlet from yesod, but I am opened to easier-to-use alternatives.
 I am struggling with defining correct types to make it through typechecks ... :D
 Given such JSON (shortened from what I am working with):
 test.json
  {"parameters": [ {"name": "name", "required": true}, {"name": "limit", "max": 10} ] } 
 If I parse the JSON with aeson like:
 ``` newtype Parameters = Parameters { parameters :: [Parameter] } deriving (Show, Generic, ToJSON, FromJSON)
 data Parameter = Parameter { name :: Text , required :: Bool , maxValue :: Maybe Integer } deriving (Show, Generic, ToJSON)
 instance FromJSON Parameter where parseJSON = withObject "parameter" $ \param -> do name <- param .: "name" required <- param .: "required" maxValue <- values .:? "max" return ( Parameter { .. } )
 newtype Parameters = Parameters { parameters :: [Parameter] } deriving (Show, Generic, ToJSON, FromJSON)
 template :: Parameters -> Html template parameters = [shamlet| $doctype 5 <html> <body> <h1> Page generated from the JSON data source <table>
  <tbody> $forall Parameter name required maxValue <- parameters <tr> <td> <p> <code>#{name}</code> $maybe realRequired <- required <span style="color: red">REQUIRED</span> $maybe maxInput <- maxValue <li><strong>max:</strong> #{maxInput} 
 |] ```
 I am getting an error (rightfully so I guess) that the types don't match -- the template expects all it's inputs with the type Text, but I have multiple -- some are simple types like Integer, others are Maybe Integer or even Value (they can be either string or integer).
 How can I satisfy the hamlet template constraints? Should I go about it differently?
 I can add full code if neccessary, it's not long, I just don't want to make this question longer than it already is :D
 Thank you for any help with this :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi! I'm writing some content for a game that has its own data file format. So I figured I'd whip up a derived mode for it to make things easier.
 The problem is that the game engine only uses tabs for indentation, and nothing I've tried has managed to get that working.
 Here's the behavior I want when in this major mode: hitting the tab key inserts a tab character at the beginning of the line. If that can't happen, I'll settle for hitting the tab key inserts a tab character at the cursor. I'm not concerned right now with behavior during region operations.
 I also want to define keywords and use font-lock to highlight those (and strings).
 How do you get that working in a derived mode? Or is it the sort of thing that would be easier to do by writing a mode from scratch?

 When I use imenu command, then press tab for completion, it will autofill a * , then will show me dozens of entries starting with a star:

 When on a working version, pressing tab will only show me the first level of org headlines, the topmost level, to choose from.
 This happens with emacs 28.2 started with -Q This works perfectly fine with emacs 26.2 started with -Q
 I tried updating the org mode that comes with emacs to 9.6.1 but that doesn't change a thing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have just created a package related to notetaking, hoping that it would be useful to others as well. It can be found here, https://github.com/chatziiola/klp, still in its infancy. The problem is that, using the snippet I have in the readme file, I get an error that the package can not be loaded (even though it gets properly downloaded). If I load it manually, it works, but it is unacceptable.
 I must have done something wrong when writing the package, but since it is my very first one, I do not know where to look for more info. 
 Installation Snippet:
  (use-package klp :straight (:host github :repo "chatziiola/klp") :init (setq klp/static-notes-dir "~/path/to/dir")) 
 Error
  Error (use-package): Cannot load klp Disable showing Disable logging 
 Manual loading command
  (load "path/to/klp.el") 
 I do not need a solution. I tried following the information I found online, related to package creation but I know I have a long way to go. Suggestions on where to look or possible points of failure are more than welcome.
 EDIT: I used the (setq debug-on-error t) command in my init.el to have more data for you but the error remained the same.
 EDIT 2: Corrected the installation command

When it's not crashing emacs, the lsp loves to make very strange formatting decisions for me. For example, I'll get to the end of a line, then I put the semicolon and suddenly the line gets partially deleted. And if I undo that, it returns to normal, but put the semicolon back causes the deletion again. Not to mention the seemingly random indenting of lines that it likes to do. Does anyone else have this issue? Is lsp-java really this poorly made?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I like what ghcup project and what they do, I think it is a fantastic tool for many people. But since I am using NixOS mostly, and I also use nix flakes for projects, I often use these buildInputs for devShells instead:
 nix devShells.default = with pkgs; mkShell { buildInputs = [ cabal-install haskell.compiler.ghc94 haskell.packages.ghc94.haskell-language-server hlint stylish-haskell # ... other packages ]; }; }); 
 If you wish to have a specific version pin down you could even do:
 nix haskell.compiler.ghc944 haskell.packages.ghc944.haskell-language-server 
 However, this often leads to building the entire haskell.packages.ghc94.haskell-language-server since the official cache doesn't have it. I am wondering, if there is enough people doing the same thing, if so it may be a good way to share resource and have different versions of ghc and their HLS-es built and cached as a untrusted substitutor?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Title,
 I am using eglot + pyright for only 1 week, and i love it (great improvement over my pre lsp days :)), features that are most usuful to me are variable/function highlightning, xref-find-definitions, eglot-rename, etc. But i am unhappy with performance, sometimes it's relively fast, but often (usually after i edit variable or function name) it can get to lagging state when everything is very slow, highlightning does not work (forget about autocomplete), etc. I have only 7 files in project, so it should not happen i think?
 1, usually what's the reasons for lags? Is it eglot/client/device side or is it server/pyright/internetspeed side?
 2, is it good idea to try to turn off some features? which are most resource hungry/less useful? i was thinking to turn off error checking while i am in "creation mode" and turn it when i am ready to clean up. 
 3, did anyone try lsp bridge? how did you like it?
 Here is my init.el
 (use-package eglot :ensure t :defer t :bind (:map eglot-mode-map ("M-f" . xref-find-definitions) ("M-F" . xref-go-back) ("M-r" . eglot-rename) ("M-t" . xref-find-references) ("M-j" . flymake-goto-next-error) ("M-J" . flymake-goto-prev-error)) :config (add-to-list 'eglot-server-programs '(python-mode . ("pyright-langserver" "--stdio"))) :custom (eglot-autoshutdown t) (eglot-events-buffer-size 50000) (eglot-send-changes-idle-time 3) (flymake-no-changes-timeout 5) (eldoc-echo-area-use-multiline-p nil) (setq eglot-ignored-server-capabilities '( :documentHighlightProvider)) :hook (python-mode . eglot-ensure) ) 
 I tried looking at eglot events buffer, but didn't find any clues on lags.
 Update: here is the list of capabilities that can be disabled

I've been trying to figure out how to find which packages are being used by the functions but describing-functions or -variables don't seem to point me anywhere other than the source file and the description.

 ​
 I've been using Emacs for about a year now, and it's single-handedly the best program I have ever used. It has ultimate extensibility, and it's just the perfect tool for so many tasks.
 Among those tasks however, I want to add note-taking, could someone please help me find a method that fits this criteria?
 I want to write notes in markdown, be able to see and use these notes on mobile through a sync client like Nextcloud, have bi-directional link support, and maybe some tags.
 ​
 I first tried using org-roam with the md-roam, but I don't really like the node system that it creates, or the IDs for each file, I feel like it's almost locking me into a sort of org-roam ecosystem, I prefer something more like a tree approach, with folders and subfolders for different categories.
 I think what I'm trying to replicate is basically the functionality that a program like Notion gives, but in Emacs.
 ​
 What suggestions would you guys have? Any and all would be greatly appreciated :)

 I'm happy to announce the release of Yampa 0.14.1!
 Yampa is a fast, elegant Functional Reactive Programming implementation. Yampa prides itself in being a long-standing community project. It has now been around for 20 years!!!
 This is probably the largest release to the Yampa project in a decade: The unit tests for all of Yampa's public API are now complete. Many of the new tests are implemented using QuickCheck, and care has been taken, whenever possible, to express the properties based on the continuous-time (FRP) interpretation of Yampa's primitives and combinators.
 Hopefully, this battery of tests will help speed up the process of accepting new features and changes, and will free resources that can be dedicated to investigating other issues.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Understandably not everyone wants auto-formatting to be all-or-nothing, previously only formatting the entire buffer was supported, so if someone wanted to auto-format a single block or function it wasn't possible.
 Now two new commands have been added:
  
elisp-autofmt-region auto-format the selection.
 
elisp-autofmt-region-dwim auto-format the selection, using the surrounding/adjacent S-expression when there is no selection.
 
 This makes it useful as an editing feature for emacs-lisp, so you can paste code and format it, wrapping by the fill-column, removing unnecessary space & indenting.
 It's available on melpa as elisp-autofmt, see: elisp-autofmt for details.
  
Example for reference:
 Unformatted text:

 Here's an example:
  (setq-local header-line-format `(:eval (funcall #'message "hi"))) 
 When I try running the same line but with eval instead of :eval, it appears that the header is not set properly (it becomes an empty line rather than “hi”).
 But as far as I can tell, :eval is not its own separate function: when I try to call describe-function on it, I get "no match" unless I remove the colon (":").
 So my question is, what is the purpose of the colon here? Why is it necessary, and where else should/could it be used?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all
 As my previous post stated, I am in the process of learning Haskell (mainly from learnyouahaskell.com at the moment).
 I've played around with folds a little in the past when learning Scala, and the learnyouahaskell site is currently introducing them.
 One example it gives is an implementation of the elem function (omitting type declaration):
  elem' y ys = foldl (\acc x -> if x == y then True else acc) False ys 
 I have implemented it as a pattern matching function (whether from a previous example on the site or just to try it I can't remember):
  elem' _ [] = False elem' e (x:xs) | e == x = True | otherwise = e `elem'` xs 
 I can understand the foldl version no problem, but my question is regarding performance on large lists. Is the foldl version a worse performer if there exists a matching element early in a long list?
 Would it run forever on an infinite list?
 The pattern matching version obviously terminates as soon as it hits a matching element. But the foldl version appears to just "note" that there exists an element, but continue checking the rest of the list anyway.
 I understand this is just an example to understand how folds work, and behind the scenes is probably not how the elem function is implemented. I just want to make sure my understanding is correct regarding this fold example. That is, that there is no way to terminate the fold process early.
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello - hope January was good for you!
 Open-source SimpleX Chat – developed in Haskell! - now supports multiple chat profiles – and your traffic will be isolated from other chat profiles in the app.
 Also in v4.5/4.5.1:
  
unsent message draft.
 filenames based on UTC time, to prevent leaking timezone.
 reduced battery usage.
 fixed WebRTC calls for users with blocked UDP.
 fixed some important bugs and one medium severity vulnerability (it had no impact on message or connections security though) - we will publish the disclosure in 2 weeks, together with our bug bounty programme announcement.
 Italian interface, thanks to the users' community and Weblate – with 5 more languages in progress (Chinese, Dutch, Japanese, Czech and Hindi)!
  
See more details in this post and download the apps via the links here.
 We need your help!
 We are looking for a Haskell developer who is more competent in network stack and memory management than we are to help us improve the stability of the platform. Please get in touch if you are interested in a short-term contract.
 Some common SimpleX Chat questions:
 Why user IDs are bad for privacy?
 How SimpleX delivers messages without user profile IDs?
 How SimpleX is different from Session, Matrix, Signal, etc.?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I like to have to have a rather minimal mode line per buffer instead of seeing the same (global) information repeated again in each mode line. For example, I don't want to see the task I have clocked in or the song that is playing right now on every's buffer mode line.
 What is your approach to that?
 Currently, I have (setq mode-line-misc-info nil) to avoid the global-mode-string in the mode line and this helps already a lot. 
 Now, where to put the global-mode-string information instead? I've found the minibuffer-line-mode package and this displays my global-mode-string in the minibuffer area, which is great in 95% of the time. However, sometimes there is important information displayed in the minibuffer that is too fast overridden by minibuffer-line-mode. The cases are rare enough, that I don't have an example right now. But when it happens, it's super annoying.
 So using the minibuffer is maybe not the best option here. So I'm wondering if it's possible to display global-mode-string right-aligned in the menu bar? At least I have it activated and the text in my global-mode-string would fit here (length).
 Is that somehow possible? Couldn't find anything into this direction...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I really like Emacs. It's powerful and has so many packages it feels like it can do just about anything.
 My use case is that it's mainly my text editor for anything that it isn't worth opening my IDE for. The problem is, this means I'm not using it every day and therefore I'm not really getting past that early pain while you learn shortcuts/commands. It's almost like I'm starting from scratch every time I use it. Every simple action requires looking through a cheat sheet or doing a web search.
 I know that Emacs isn't supposed to be used in a mainly mouse driven way and many will say that half the point is all the powerful shortcuts that will, eventually, improve productivity. I'm just never getting past the early pain and I'd like something with more menus and more mouse driven support, but still all the features and extensibility of Emacs.
 I'm not looking to switch from my IDE for the heavier stuff, although that would probably help me get over the learning pain, but I've already done that with the IDE and don't want to give that up.
 I did see mousemacs and I really hoped it would be the solution I was looking for, but it seems a little buggy and actually makes things more complicated to use - not less.
 Can anyone suggest either an Emacs alike that fits my needs or a simple way to setup Emacs in this way?
 Edit: Specifically, what I want to be able to do is much of the every day stuff via menus. Either context menus or menu bar menus. I want to be able to list buffers and switch/remove to them. I want to be able to access the customisation via a menu - especially themes and packages. Also - ideally package specific commands as well as being able to assign various commands to a custom menu.

  ┌─┐ │3│ │ │ ▼ │2│ ┌────┴─┴────┐ │ │ │ │ ┌▼┐ ┌▼┐ │1│ │4│ 
 This looks like a job for a Zipper. However, I also think this can be done with a Lens, although I'm just getting started with Lenses, and not entirely sure. I'll probably end up implementing both approaches for kicks. but I'd like to hear from Haskell veterans that, given this problem, which of the two would be your choice, and why.

 This cause the q key to close all normal mode windows.
 As I understand lisp the quote caused the helpful-mode-map to be sent to evil-define-key unevaluated, so why would it result in its application to all the windows?
 Is it because of the way evil-define-key is defined, or is it some general feature of Emacs Lisp?

 I'm a 2 year old typescript web developer. I'm a bit tired of web development and typescript, and I'm willing to learn something different. I could use your expertise about scala, more precisely to know if it is suited for my needs : 
 1/ I'm willing to learn a functional programming language. I tried recently purescript (haskell like), it made me afraid of purely functional programming, so I though "why not start with something less rigid ?". 
 2/ I would like to make native application (specifically CLI tools), and it has a scala-native compiler. 
 3/ I also would like to make GUI apps. Is it doable with scala ? Does using JavaFX and ScalaFX prevent compiling with scala-native, and make my app require the JVM to run ? 
 Also, would you consider setting up a reliable development environment for scala simple or complicated ? For example, I consider typescript development environment a bit too patchworky to set up. 
 Thank you for any clue you can give me and thank you for reading ;)

 It's been some time that I have been trying to figure how to work out configuring an exchange outlook account for notmuch with Oauth2 / multifactor verification, since basic authentication is now deprecated by microsoft.
 In my UNI there is a 2FA/Oauth2 authentication for Outlook. I am definitely by no means expert on this, however, I have tried all sorts of different setups (using a setup for offlineimap with oauth2 authentication, a mutt token generation script, among others).
 Unfortunately, my university does not give permission for other registering additional clients (and apps in general) therefore I can not use azure for registering new applications therefore I can not use thunderbird's client_id and secret for generating a token. Long story short, I can not use my favourite editor for composing/sending email for outlook.
  
I have IMAP enabled, but is not possible to register application
  
Is there any way to configure outlook with 2FA/oauth2 :
  
without having to bypass my university's regulations
 any other solution at least for
  
 Composing email within emacs and somehow telling outlook application to send it ? (osascript?)
 Fetching new email and exporting to maildir therefore I can create a notmuch-friendly database?

 This release introduces kele-list, bound to s-k <resource type> l. In previous versions of Kele, you could only fetch single resources; there was no way to view groups of resources at a time. Now, with kele-list, you can create ad-hoc “overviews” of specific resource types within a given context and namespace; hitting Enter on any entry in this list brings up the resource’s full manifest.
 Here's a screenshot
 For more details, see: How-Tos > Usage. As always, please open an issue for any peculiar behavior you notice, or feel free to start a discussion if you'd like to give general feedback or throw ideas around.

 Let's say you have a list of lists of Doubles [[Double]].
 [[-0.5,-0.5,4.5,4.5],[1.5,-1.0,6.5,9.0],[1.0,2.0,5.0,6.0]] 
 How would you go about iterating (map) over each one, and making a new list with the elements at index 0. Then doing a new list with elements at index 1, then at index 2 and finally at index 3.So essentially the first list will have all the elements at index 0, second list at index 1, etc.
 Result would be:
 [[-0.5,1.5,1.0],[-0.5,-1.0,2.0],[4.5,6.5,5.0],[4.5,9.0,6.0]] 
 Or it could also just be function that takes [[Double]] as first parameter and the index as second parameter and then returns a single list.
 createList :: [[Double]] -> Int -> [Double] createList list index = map function list index function :: [Double] -> Int -> Double function list index = list !! index 
 Something like that.
 Then I could do something like:
 let list = [[-0.5,-0.5,4.5,4.5],[1.5,-1.0,6.5,9.0],[1.0,2.0,5.0,6.0]] let listAtIndexZero = createList list 0 let listAtIndexOne = createList list 1 let listAtIndexTwo = createList list 2 let listAtIndexThree = createList list 3 
 Thank you

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've got Emacs 28.2 (self-compiled, 739b5d0e52) on one host of mine.
 Whenever I do invoke M-w (for kill-ring-save) of a region that has - I guess - non 7 bit US ASCII characters included, I get "Non-ASCII string must be encoded in advance" followed by the region text with re-coded characters in the minibuffer. As a matter of fact, the message appears even before that when the region gets expanded to the first non-ASCII character and the later kill-ring-save is failing when kill-new is invoked within its definition.
 Good case: I mark a region like "foo bar" and am able to push it into the clipboard by invoking M-w as usual. Perfect. No issue with marking the region or pushing to the clipboard.
 Error case: However, when I try to create a region with "foo€" or "fooä" or "fooß" or "foo¼" I get the weird behavior described above as soon as the first non-ASCII character gets added to the region and the clipboard doesn't get any new content pushed to when I do try to kill.
 I'm not sure if this is related: when the region gets defined by pressing C-SPC and then expanded by right-char I also get "Replaced 0 occurrences" with every new invocation. This is suspicious as well. Maybe they both are related? 
 With emacs -q, there is always normal behavior (good case) without the error message. So it has to be related to my configuration.
 The same configuration using Emacs 27.1 also does not have this weird behavior. 
 How can I debug this? Does this sound familiar to you? Do you have an idea what that might cause? 
 My config is rather hard to impossible to bi-sect with a sane effort. :-(

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm looking for a HTML scraping library that has good error handling; basically at least Parsec-style errors. If a parser fails, print where and why it failed.
 Scalpel exists and has a nice API, but it mashes everything into a Maybe value and it's a pain to add errors without a big rewrite.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lately, I have been thinking of playing with desktop GUI in Scala (I know that "desktop is dead", but I am not a fan of Electron and have always been fond of reading about native GUI, so I want to try it out). There are already tools like Skija and JWM which provide a good starting point, but I miss an important feature that a GUI framework should have: the ability to hot reload code, so changes can be seen on the screen quickly.
 I have come across three alternatives so far:
  
Going with a markup language: I could create my own XML-like language or use a template engine to parse the UI and generate components. This approach is used by Gtk, WPF, JavaFX, Avalonia, and others. While this solution is good for simple projects, it becomes annoying for more complex UIs that need to be dynamic. It also seems burdensome to connect all events and signals.
 
Embedding an interpreted language, like Graal-js and interoperating with Scala for non-UI code. The downside of this approach is that most of the code would likely be written in JavaScript, kind of defeating the purpose of having a Scala GUI.
 
Joining forces with other projects like HumbleUI, which already achieves this goal, and bridging them to Scala. The downside again is that HumbleUI is written in Clojure, not Scala. I like the idea of contributing to the success of other projects, but I am not sure if most people will want to deal with a Lisp.
 
 I am wondering how I can achieve this feature. Is a Scalajs-Graaljs-Scala combo worth the complexity? Should I go with a templating engine? Would it be possible to do some Scala hot reloading of the view with Ammonite, and if so, how? Are there any other ways I am missing? I have been asking myself these questions for some time now, but I cannot find the answers on my own.
 Maybe I am spoiled by web development, and hot reloading is not that necessary. What would you like to see in a modern GUI framework to make desktop apps that can compete with Electron ones?

Copy and kill. I can kill from the cursor's position with Ctrl+K. Is there a way to copy and kill the line from the current cursor position?
 Kill current word. In the line void foo(int a, |int b) { /*do stuff*/); the cursor is right before the second int declaration. Can I kill this word without having to use Ctrl-3-d?
 Select and modify all identical words on the same line, i.e. in the line void bar(double a, double b, double c, double d) I found out it would be better if each argument was an int. Can I for example select the first instance of double somehow, then as I retype it to int, all other instances are also changed? I think I've seen tsoding do this, so it's probably just a matter of installing a package. 
 Any input on how to efficiently selecting large blocks of code fast would also be appreciated!

 I also made a reddit thread about this same topic: https://www.reddit.com/r/haskellquestions/comments/vi0tcm/how_to_redirect_cabal_haddock_output_to_a/
 I would like to be able to redirect cabal haddock output to a folder of my choice. In issue comments it was suggested to add an --only-documentation flag to cabal install.
 I've been trying to implement this change and realised that I don't actually know what would be the most desirable behavior for this command.
 Should it only copy documentation that's already been generated? Or should it generate documentation? If it generates documentation, then should it be also able to re-run haddock and overwrite the existing documentation even if documentation already exists?
 If it's able to run haddock (and not just copy documentation) then should it put the documentation in the standard folder first and then make a copy? Or redirect the documentation where the user wants it and create just this one copy?
 Is adding this option to cabal install the most reasonable way to do this? Are there other, maybe better ways of achieving the same end? Wouldn't it be better to add some kind of additional flag / argument to cabal haddock?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone,
 I have this issue with org publish and I can't solve it...
 I want to make a different postamble for different parts of my project (the same problem applies for the head variables).
 I define two different postamble as this:
 (setq pages-html-postamble "<footer>My postamble 1</footer>" blog-html-postamble "<footer>My postamble 2</footer>") 
 And then I reference them in different components of the org-publish-project-alist variable like this:
 (setq org-publish-project-alist `(("pages" :html-head ,pages-html-head :html-postamble ,pages-html-postamble ;; ... :recursive t) ("blog" :html-head ,blog-html-head :html-postamble ,blog-html-postamble ;; ... ("blog-images" :base-directory "blog/" :base-extension "jpg\\|gif\\|png" :publishing-directory "docs/blog" :publishing-function org-publish-attachment :recursive t) ("assets" :base-directory "assets/" :base-extension "css\\|ttf\\|ico\\|png" :publishing-directory "docs/assets/" :publishing-function org-publish-attachment :recursive t) ("all" :components ("blog" "pages" "blog-images" "assets")))) 
 ​
 Then if I publish from command line using emacs --batch --load publish.el --funcall org-publish-all I cannot get the result that I expect of two different postambles but only the pages postamble is used. Is there anything I am missing? I tried with org-html-postamble-format but I encounter the same issue.
 Org version is 9.6 and Emacs version is GNU Emacs 29.0.60 (build 1, x86_64-pc-linux-gnu, X toolkit, cairo version 1.17.6, Xaw scroll bars) of 2023-01-10.
 Any help is appreciated, thank you!
