        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm using nix to manage python dependencies (see excerpt of flake.nix below) but this means those python dependencies are in a /nix directory, so when lsp tries to figure out project root for them, it thinks they have nothing to do with my own project. Also I'm using emacs-direnv to transparently switch into nix environments (.envrc + use flake), so direnv (correctly) unloads my LSP executable (configured in flake.nix), so even if they should be considered totally separate projects LSP-mode doesn't know how to start up the server.
 a) should I somehow convince projectile that these files in /nix are actually part of my project?
 b) should I convince direnv to not unload upon visiting these files?
 c) should I tell LSP mode to not try to reconfigure upon visiting dependencies?
 excerpt of flake.nix:
  devShell = pkgs.mkShell { buildInputs = with pkgs; [ (python3.withPackages(ps: with ps; [ python-lsp-server pandas numpy ]) ] }

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A while ago I posted about how I was changing light and dark themes in Emacs. I wanted to provide an update, as it has changed a bit. 
 I am now using the top-right menu on Gnome to enable and disable dark mode. However, old GTK3 applications do not "see" this setting at all.
 To solve this problem I am using:
  
Python script that monitors dbus and changes the GTK theme when selecting dark
 Systemd unit to ensure the script is running all time
 Emacs snippet to react to this change
  
With this setup, having Emacs complied with pure GTK, changing the dark mode on gnome triggers a theme change, while the script triggers a change on the frame decoration. It sounds hacky, but the transition is very smooth and seamless.
 Also, this new code, makes sure that only one theme is configured in Emacs, as having multiple themes selected might be problematic, if themes change different settings.
 (use-package dbus :init (defun theme-switcher (value) ;; 0 = No Preference ;; 1 = Prefers dark ;; 2 = Prefers light. Not currently used by Gnome (let* ((dark-theme 'ef-dark) (light-theme 'ef-frost) (new-theme (if (= value 1) dark-theme light-theme)) (switch? (not (member new-theme custom-enabled-themes)))) (when switch? (mapc #'disable-theme custom-enabled-themes) (load-theme new-theme)))) (defun handler (value) (theme-switcher (car (car value)))) (defun signal-handler (namespace key value) (if (and (string-equal namespace "org.freedesktop.appearance") (string-equal key "color-scheme")) (theme-switcher (car value)))) :config (dbus-call-method-asynchronously :session "org.freedesktop.portal.Desktop" "/org/freedesktop/portal/desktop" "org.freedesktop.portal.Settings" "Read" #'handler "org.freedesktop.appearance" "color-scheme") (dbus-register-signal :session "org.freedesktop.portal.Desktop" "/org/freedesktop/portal/desktop" "org.freedesktop.portal.Settings" "SettingChanged" #'signal-handler))

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Been using Neovim as my "ide", like to switch to Emacs.
 Neovim pros:
  
Very fast workflow
 well chosen keybindings
 great Project overview
 works in Terminal
 Tabs ❤️
  
Cons: - lack of features (no standardized) - many plugins unstable - sometimes freezes - not all plugins Crossplatform
 Emacs Pros:
  
Lots of features for development and more
 Lisp better than lua or vimscript
 GUI and Terminal
 Org-mode, Magit, ...
 self documentation, file opening, ...
  
Cons: - Bad default movement - complicated Keybindings general
 Some things that are important to me. Biggest thing holding me off from switching are the Keybindings. Just Moving the cursor is already such a strech. I've installed Evil mode but you have to configure it with every other plugin and often end up with doubled behaviour and not everything working as expected. It's still very hacky and i'm not sute if i should be using it.
 My Question is if i should just commit to the default binding? I've heard that they are subjectively bad and cause pinky strain and don't allow a fast workflow, and i can see that being the case. But maybe it just comes down to practice.
 Any of you had the same experience coming from Vim? Who uses the default bindings? Do you experience any problems with them?
 Thank you in advance!

easy drag and drop movement and
easy hiding and revealing of branches.
Most of the time I take notes in The Archive.
Is there any way to get this type of functionality within The Archive?
If not, is there an external editor that would be good for this?
Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Emacs experts, I need your help. I run Emacs in text mode in 16-colour terminal emulator. I recently upgraded from Emacs 27 (shipped with Debian 11) to 28 (shipped with Debian 12) and all the colours got horribly messed up. Here is an example from customize-face:
 https://i.imgur.com/KdaaC2J.png
 I speculate this happens because the default colours now assume 256-colour terminal, and indeed if I switch to 256 colours in the terminal emulator the settings look readable:
 https://i.imgur.com/dE2jUCv.png
 The question is how do I easily revert to earlier settings from Emacs 27? I could possible go through all the options and set font faces to desired values, but this will be an extremely tedious task given the amount of options, and I feel like there must be a simple solution for this.
 EDIT: It seems that the problem with colours only happens when running Emacs from inside Tmux, but not when running it directly from a terminal.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone, When I try to create my daily note with org-roam-dailies-goto-today , the note (title and name) takes yesterday's date. The calendar shows the right day for today (if I want to select another date), so it knows today's date. But the function goto-today / capture-today is wrong.
 My capture template for the dailies is the default one. And org-roam-dailies-goto-tomorrow also captures yesterday's date. Where shall I place the edebug() command to get more feedback from emacs regarding these functions?
 I am using emacs 28.2 on Windows, with org-roam v2.2.2-42
 Any idea? Thanks in advance

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am currently (as in right now) designing a short (first iteration 5 hours of structured lecturing in total 2 open consulting hours) workshop that is directly geared towards beginners or people who make sure that they nailed the basics.
There are 8 open slots per workshops. A workshop means that you don't have to compete for time or attention as if you are in an underfunded public school. So, I decided 8 is a reasonable size. So, it is rather limited.
It is a no-fluff-concept. I won't tell you about the history of the method or my backstory. There are no complicated workflow terms you'll need to learn or note typology (which is only clouding the applicable knowledge). It is 5 hours of intense learning to get you started (most likely divided in 3 sessions with 2 additional open consulting hours).
Cost: 250-300$ for the whole workshop.
There will be an official announcement. If you are interested, subscribe to the newsletter, send me a daily carrier pigeon and ask how it is going, check the page hourly or use your preferred method of keeping updated.
I am happy to answer any questions.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A few days ago, I wrote up an idea of mine here which some very wonderful person (Karthink) made for me!
 He even gave it a wonderful name: Dired-Delight
 (No, I'm not renaming it to Dired-Summer, guys 😛)
 Anyway, I thought some of you might want to check it out. Uses would include (for me):
 1) Sorting through lots of files and directories and marking them with colors to say if they're processed, or still processing.
 2) Coloring files differently that belong to different categories but you need to keep them in the same folder.
 3) You have a folder with lots of pictures from different decades/eras and you want to visually mark them off.
 Etc...
 Plus it kinda looks pretty.
 Karthink says he wants to give it to me and I'll be the maintainer but, as I really have zero experience doing that, I may hold off on that for now. I am learning elisp right now but it's slow-going. I'm doing my best tho. It's just got nothing to do with my job so it's sometimes hard to find the time for a few hours to get through more lessons. But I'll get there. 🙃

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Org mode is incredibly flexible, and I particular I've recently turned my attention into the customizable regexp, they're all named something like org-*-regexp: 
  
org-emphasis-regexp-components
 org-outline-regexp 
  
My question is if they could be modified so that org-mode becomes a sort of markdown, for example replacing the stars '*' with hashtags '#' and the like, and if so, how much it would break (I'd assume pretty much everything as I'm using Doom emacs which has a lot of packages I'm not aware of). For example org-ql has also defined a similar set of variables named org-ql-*regexp (although I've not checked if it's a one-to-one correspondence between org regexp and org-ql regexp but is seems promising)
 Also I sort of remember that org-mode was moving away from parsing files using regular expressions in the long term, so even if today was more or less possible, then with each passing year, support for regular expression tweaking would be smaller.
 To what extent is this possible?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Many packages like org-krita/org-yt/org-excalidraw/org-xournalpp allow custom files to be displayed inline by means of a custom link type. However, they don't work when the file is linked as an attachment, which makes me think that there may be a better way to achieve this. 
 ​
 The org-display-inline-images function uses some functions and variables from image.el such as image-file-name-regexp and create-image to respectively check if the file is an image and to create the image descriptor to display it inline.
 The packages above (except org-yt which is more general) kind of work the same way: there is a project binary file (e.g. .xopp) that gets converted to an image format such as .png and .svg and then it gets displayed inline.
 Would it be possible to define a custom image handler (e.g. for .xopp) that would work exactly the same as, let's say, .png, except that it performs a conversion (.xpp -> .png) before actually handling it? And then the second questions: would it be a silly idea?

I'm on a Mac and I almost never use the Finder anymore to sort through files and manage them because dired is so amazing. But, here's a suggestion for a package (and please let me know if one already exists that does this):
 I want to colorize files/directories to visually group them. And I'll explain:
 In MacOS, you can select files and folders and click on File at the top menu and get a selection of colors which you have defined. They are essentially tags and you can add multiple colors to files/folders this way and also define them however you want. You can also search for them in this way. Tagging files and folders will put a colored dot next to their icon or next to their name in the Icon view. My idea for this package would be:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm using Emacs 28.2.7 on Fedora 38 (KDE spin) and I have just been experiencing some odd new behaviour when I switch to an open Emacs window. Things work without a problem until I use MS Teams for a video call (using an external webcam). Once I've done that, every time I return to Emacs I get multiple errors saying 
 <XF86WebCam> is undefined 
 When I press a key the error goes away and I can use Emacs as usual but if I move to another application and then back to Emacs the error messages return again. I'm not using any packages that I know of that require a webcam. This behaviour only seems to have started since the recent .7 update to Emacs and happens using both Wayland and X11. I can't seem to replicate the problem on my laptop that has a built-in webcam. I'd be very grateful if anyone could provide some ideas as to what's going on or how to identify the problem. Thanks!

 I ran the ./configure command with native compilation and pgtk3 options and it seemed to run fine.
 When I run make, I get an error and it fails. I don't know much about C (or elisp for that matter) but as far as I can tell, the crux of the error message is this:
 ​
 Eager macro-expansion failure: (void-function seq-some) make[2]: *** [Makefile:916: bootstrap-emacs.pdmp] Error 255 make[2]: Leaving directory '/home/me/computing/emacs/src' make[1]: *** [Makefile:544: src] Error 2 
 ​
 Does anyone know what is going wrong?
 ​
 I have also tried to build and install aur packages for emacs 29 using an aur helper and run into a similar error.
 ​
 Thanks.

 PS. sorry if this is lacking information, i am not very experienced with this process.

Contretemps with a local tax appraisal agency inspires me to track their activities. I want to take notes and link to appropriate statutes.
When the statutes are updated, I want to replace the old copies with the new. Like anyone both wanting and eating cake, I'd like for my links to survive the file replacement.
I can link to a document. I can link to a document name, and that solves the problem if the document name remains constant over revision.
What I would really like is a link to "all files containing Texas Unemployment Compensation" and "201.011".
Right now, I'm using Devonthink. I can save a search as a smart group and then link to the smart group, but that's quite a bit of friction for creating a link. I think it also may not fit intimately with Devonthink's AI based See Also feature.
Any thoughts appreciated. I also appreciate the hospitality here.  The discussion is wonderful.]]></summary>

 ​
 I have `outline-minor-0` wich has some attributes applied. I don't care which attributes are applied on the face, I just want it to have a *red* foreground. So i write the following line in my init file:
 (set-face-attribute 'outline-minor-0 nil :foreground "red")
 However, the truth is that `outline-minor-0` has already applied these attributes: `:background "light grey" :weight 'bold`. The 3 attributes get mixed together so the resulting attributes of `outline-minor-0` are: red foreground, light grey background, bold weight when I just wanted a red foreground! 
 ​
 I could specify `:background 'undefined :weight 'undefined` to remove those attributes, but I'd like to implicitly reset every other unspecified attribute. How can I do it?

 Tried few config tricks but none seems to work, and C-c l does not work either:
 (use-package lsp-mode
 :commands (lsp lsp-deferred)
 :init
 (setq lsp-keymap-prefix "C-c l") ;; Or 'C-l', 's-l'

 Any help is greatly appreciated.

However, when I use break in sly, i get thrown into a generic debugging buffer. Typing B to use the default debugger does nothing other than freeze the repl until I C-c. I am remoting into a slynk server so this might be the reason, but this is not mentioned in the docs I believe. Is this the correct behavior?

 We are provided with code via gitlab and only have to compile basically.
 I would like to do some own little projects in scala to get deeper into it and exercise before the exams.
 I've my setup in IntelliJ and I am using sbt.
 So far the issue I am having is I do not get how to manage dependancies correctly.
 Or say I really don't know how to manage them at all.

 Simple things like the M-x popup isn't actually stock. In Doom, it's provided by a package called vertico. Then other packages provide fuzzy matching in vertico.
 To get out from M-x I had to press Escape 3 times. And this is without bringing up how unintuitive the keybindings are (like moving around).
 Emacs could do with much needed polish. Without Doom Emacs (and its configuration) and the amazing packages people provide, I don't think I could use Emacs.
 It's no wonder Emacs isn't really brought up in conversation. I would like to see improvements in usability. It needs built-in quality-of-life improvements to be more accessible to people. Emacs being extremely powerful and extensible means nothing if the average person isn't able to use that to their benefit.
 I hope I didn't come across as too criticising; I do love Emacs and spend most of my day in it. Thanks

 I would like to use the siunitx latex package. 
 I installed the package doing:
 sudo apt -y install texlive-science
 When I compile my document using directly latex:
 pdflatex mydoc.tex
 it works, but when I'm within emacs, the latex-preview-pane package cannot compile my document.
 I guess I have to tell emacs and auctex where to find the packages I installed when I installed texlive-science. 
 How can I solve this ?
 PS : I know that the error in latex-preview-pane comes from the \usepackage[siunitx], because if I comment this line, it works perfectly.

I saw about reference manager tools (like Zotero) for the process of note-taking (not especially for Zettelkasten).
Is it as useful as it pretends to be ?
Why do you use one ?
How does it fit in your workflow ?
Thanks !]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Introduction
 Functional applications offer numerous benefits in modern software development. They enhance testability, modularity, and composability, leading to more maintainable and scalable codebases. In this article, we'll explore the syntax and semantics of functional applications and introduce the app-toolkit library—a powerful tool for building functional applications more efficiently.
 Syntax and Semantic of an App
 At its core, an app can be represented as a function that takes an input (I) and produces an output (O). By incorporating side effects, we extend this representation to I => F[O], where F[_] denotes the ability to handle side effects.
 Resources
 To build an app, we rely on resources such as app information, input arguments, a logger, and configuration settings.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After struggling for years to manage my personal finances, found ledger/hledger. My goal is to find my yearly expense so that I can make FIRE plan. Ledger is great, but required to create transactions in ledger. Struggled with parsing bank/card pdfs, manually creating entries and nothing worked. Eventually realized that I can just copy the text from pdf into emacs and then format it using emacs macros. Then next task was to convert the transaction lines into ledger entries. This gave birth to `ob-ledger-convert` or `ob-lc` to provide `lc` src blocks in the org mode which when executed convert the given transactions into ledger format. It does need parsers and I have provided some of the parsers used by me in the `ob-lc` module. New parsers can be added easily.
 This post is to share the enthusiasm of the emacs being such a fascinating machine which lets you do anything you want and also to get the feedback from the community on the package.
 The sample org file provided in the repo provides a gist of how to use the module.

 i hear a ton about emacs, and the lengths to which people take it, but i don't actually know what it can do
 basically all i know is that it's a very configurable text editor, but from what I've heard, that description doesn't really do it justice.
 so basically, tldr, what makes emacs so good? why do people like it so much?

Liquid Haskell (LH), a tool that gives the Haskell
programmer both the ability to express properties about programs

In this post we present a specific improvement that I integrated
recently, which cuts down the maintenance cost to use LH
when introducing assumptions about functions coming
from large or multiple packages.

Problem: How to reason about dependencies
Let us suppose that we are trying to verify that the following
function yields a non-empty list.
module M where

{-@ consPlus1 :: Int -> [Int] -> { v:[Int] | len v > 0 } @-}
consPlus1 :: Int -> [Int] -> [Int]

 maccalfw
 This is a project born by personal need and mostly for personal use and very much still work in progress, so use at your own discretion. I am still testing it as I had to customize large parts of calfw and calfw-blocks to my liking (working on the interface for modifying and adding events now).
 Bug reports and possible improvements are welcome.
 ​
 A bit of background: I was trying to find ways to view and modify my calendars from within Emacs which lead me down the rabbit hole of figuring out calendar clients for my Google Calendar, my Apple calendar and my work Office365 calendar. Clients for Office365 are particularly annoying with the new Oauth2 system; an app has to be trusted by Microsoft which pretty much means that all open source clients are unusable unless one has admin control over the Azure environment.
 After some pointless struggle, I decided to just rely on my local MacOS calendar app to handle all the authentication and to sync my calendars. I wrote a simple interface in Swift which can be imported in Emacs and then used to feed events into calfw.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just as the title says, Scala's community looks very pessimistic on how the language is progressing on the basis of what I read here and from say blog posts.
 Context is that I'm an AI engineer in R&D. Currently I do just about everything in Python, SQL with a sprinkle of R. I know some Scala 2, Java and C++ as well. To me, Scala always felt like the ideal marriage of having a great type system and not having the annoying things you'd associate from static typing.
 I think the pessimism hurts adoption as folk like myself become skeptical. That's sad because at least in theory the language does exactly what people like me need: a pragmatic yet principled way to make software. Scala 3, especially, looks flexible enough for scripting and interactive stuff with for example polynote. Type safety also reduces the footguns compared to Python.
 It won't deter me, I'll keep on going but at the very least I wanted to share my thoughts.

 My goal is to take a single buffer and divide it into multiple regions, so that, for example, the top half could display a calendar (I use calfw, so I had intended to show the one week view here) and the bottom half could be divided into left and right.

It causes some calendar clients to read them incorrectly by scheduling todo headings with current time or showing scheduled events in a todo list.
 I wrote a systemd .service file (with a bit of help) to switch all scheduled todo headings as VEVENTS and unscheduled as VTODOs. From initial tests it seems to be working correctly on Thunderbird and calcurse.
 It works by checking if an entry in the .ics file uses current time for DTSTART (that's what icalendar assigns to unscheduled todo headings). If it does then it should be a VTODO, otherwise a VEVENT.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Does the Refined library for Scala (at https://github.com/fthomas/refined; "eu.timepit" %% "refined") work in Scala 3? Does it work differently?
 I'm having trouble in migrating some code that uses Refined from Scala 2 to Scala 3.
 The code is:
 import eu.timepit.refined.api.{Refined, RefinedTypeOps}
 import eu.timepit.refined.numeric.Interval.Closed
 object Example {
 type MyType = Int Refined Closed[1, 3]
 object MyType extends RefinedTypeOps.Numeric[MyType, Int]
 val good: MyType = MyType(1) // 2.13: works
 val bad: MyType = MyType(42) // 2.13: correctly fails with error re 42 > 3
 }
 It works fine with Scala 2.13.11 (with dependency "eu.timepit" %% "refined" % "0.11.0"), compiling per the comments.
 However, with Scala 3 (I tried 3.0.0, 3.3.0) the line with good fails compilation with the error "object MyType in object Example does not take parameters".
 It looks like an apply method implemented using RefineMacro.implApplyRef disappeared for the Scala 3 version of eu.timepit.refined.api.RefinedTypeOps. 
 Does the Scala 3 version still support compile-time validation of literal values to refined types? 
 If so, how? (That is, what do I change "MyType(1)" to in order to have it work in Scala 3?)
 Thanks.

I want to I use my e-ink tablet as an external screen when programming out in the sunshine. But it has turned out that something as simple as a high contrast theme with a pure white background and black text is beyond my abilities. 
 For some reason, M-x set-background-color white sets the background to gray when running emacs in a terminal. Even setting the background color to #ffffff results in a gray background (and in me shouting frustrated at the monitor). I can get pure white with xemacs, but I'm mostly working on our development servers remotely over slow ssh connections, so xemacs is out of the equation. 
 Of the standard themes, whiteboard comes closest, but is also gray background, smudged and hard to read on e-ink. Literally every light theme I've downloaded has been some variant of smudgy yellow, gray or teal for the background. Grayish text on grayish background is virtually illegible on e-ink. 
 I found an "e-ink" theme here: https://emacsthemes.com/themes/eink-theme.html. This gets me black text on a white background... mixed with white text on a white background (#includes and other syntax highlighting), so also not useable. 
 Can it really be that difficult to get real black text on real white background? What is the obvious thing I'm missing? I'm happy to have some syntax highlighting in (dark) gray, but the main text needs to be pure black, and most importantly the background should be actual white. 
 Please help, my inability to get something so trivial to work is hurting my self-esteem!

However, in emacs 28.3 a lot of his commands seem to be missing. Does anyone know what package provides org-batch-store-agenda-views or org-agenda-export-to-ics ?
 Doom emacs only provides org-icalendar-combine-agenda-files for exporting .ics.
 This command seems necessary to replace VTODO with VEVENT types.
 WORKAROUND: You can just run sed command on the exported .ics instead whenever cron job exports .ics to replace all VTODO with VEVENT: sed -i 's/VEVENT/VTODO/g' org.ics

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm not sure exactly what I'm looking for here, so this is going to be a bit open-ended. But I was wondering if there was a way to produce statistics on a group of org files. Here are some examples of what I mean.
 Example #1 - Tag Count
 You create TODO items over an entire year. Your TODO's all have at least one, but possibly more, tags. Those tags are "Work", "School", "Personal", "Spouse", "Home", and "Fun", for example. At the end of the year, you want to know how you divided your time. Is there an easy way to produce output like this:
  
Work - 30
 School - 28
 Personal - 24
 Spouse - 20
 Home - 17
 Fun - 11
  
Example #2 - Avg Time
 You spend a year completing tasks. At the end of that year, is there an easy way to display how long tasks took to complete? Maybe broken down by tag?
 I'm sure there are lots of other ways of summarizing and splicing the various meta data collected, so if anyone has any suggestions, I'm open to it.

 Any idea on how to achieve this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I use tmux on a remote server for persistence. I find it useful to have a multi-term buffer inside my local emacs that is then ssh'ed into this server and then I can also attach to my persistent tmux session. 
 My question applies even if I skip the tmux step. In my term window I may want to edit a file that is local to the remote. Running emacs in that window, I loose control of emacs shortcuts: everything including closing the remote emacs goes to my emacsclient running on my laptop. Is there a way to solve this? Can I keep my workflow, and edit a file remotely like this? 
 In solving this, I don't want to give up on all shortcuts passed to my local emacsclient when I am not editing a file remotely like this.
 This is not the same as running emacs inside multi-term that is running bash locally. For that, I use emacsclient (my local emacs is running as a server) and so I can open any file in my emacs client locally. One solution would be to pass -X to ssh and have a gui running locally.

 I am pretty new to emacs and at the moment I try to configure lsp-mode with pylsp. In my understanding I can just use a hook at prog-mode to run lsp (seems to work). The only problem is that emacs wont find pylsp. I allready hacked something together to prepend the emacs intern PATH var (read by using (getenv "PATH") with the path to the directory which contains the pylsp executable but it just says that it cannot find it. This problem only exists when starting emacs via dmenu and not via a "normal" terminal which uses my zshrc with the appropriate PATH var I guess.
 My config can be found here
 Any help would be appreciated. Have a Great Day!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been making "come-here..." eyes at emacs for a year or more now, but also had a pretty crazy year, which has led to a return to school for a career change. Looking for a good, cross-platform note-taking/workflow thing, and heard about Obsidian, Evernote, Roam, Foam...and came across this thread. Talm' bout eMacs being able to do a lot of what the new-fangled apps are bragging about. Put it this way - I got a couple months that are kinda-sorta free, so if you're telling me this is a valid excuse to run through emacs, I'm sold. One step closer to achieving true FOSS nerd-dom, after dabbling in it from the edges.
 But, like I said in the title, I'm mostly a fan of FOSS for ideological reasons, and past recognizing names of things I don't actually have that much ability. So, I gotta be that guy and ask for any advice on easy-to-set-up-and-understand emacs-centered solutions to note-taking. Specifically, I need something that I can sync between my Linux Mint laptop and Android, or that I can make sync. Searchable across devices/files is big, too. I can go a step further in being an entitled new guy, if there are any good resources - youtube playlists, blogs, articles, whatever - on something like "designing/customizing workflow for your industry/goals in emacs," that'd be cool, too.
 Thanks for bearing w/me, here's hoping I'll finally be joining this community.

One things that I want to do asap is set up a lot of my keybinds to mostly mirror the ones set by Doom. That being said, there are a lot of binds to copy over and I don't want to do all of the hard manual labor of setting them all. More specifically, I want to copy over a lot of the useful leader key functionality that Doom sets. For instance, if I were to hit <leader> W in Doom, it would function about the same as if I hit <C-w> in evil mode. As of right now, I'm using the general package to set my binds for the leader key manually but it's kind of a pain in the ass, especially for such a massive set of commands like the <C-w> or <C-h> functionality. Is there a way to either 
 A.) More easily port over most of the keybinds from Doom? (I know a lot of them are package specific but still)
 B.) Easily set certain default Emacs keybinds to other key combinations? (E.g set <Leader> W to be equivalent to <C-w> and <Leader> H to be equivalent to <C-h>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently there was a thread about how r/haskell should respond to upcoming API changes: https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/146d3jz/rhaskell_and_the_recent_news_regarding_reddit/
 As a result I made r/haskell private: https://discourse.haskell.org/t/r-haskell-is-going-dark/6405?u=taylorfausak
 Now I have re-opened r/haskell as read-only. In terms of what happens next, I will leave it up to the community. This post summarizes the current situation and possible reactions: https://www.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/14cr2is/alternative_forms_of_protest_in_light_of_admin/
 Please comment and vote on suggestions in this thread.
 Regardless of the outcome of this vote, I would suggest that people use the official Haskell Discourse instead of r/haskell: https://discourse.haskell.org

 I want to switch to use Emacs daemon with the provided systemd user unit emacs.service for quicker startup but if I simply enable and start it, it doesn't restore any frames. I see that there's this thread which seems to work on restoring a single frame, but how to restore/save multiple frames like my initial setup? Unfortunately I barely know any elisp.
 Much appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi ! I'm a bit confused with the goal of permanent note in a standard ZK workflow.
Sometimes, I feel it is redundant or useless.
Context: I mainly use note-taking to capture and convert informations into pieces of reusable cards (for technical docs). My main interest are science (physics/math) and computer science (programing/software/web).
What I pretend to know about permanent note
In pure theory, I believe (maybe I'm wrong ) a permanent note is a card :
that should contain enough text about a specific topic (atomic)
that should contain enough informations to "live alone" (self-contained)
that should be reusable in other topic context (portable)
that should contain links to spread the web
that should contain references to sources (context)
The permenant note, from my head to paper
When I have an idea, I write it down to paper (fleeting note) and I must convert this note into a well-formed, in my own word permanent note.
I am unconfortable with this new permanent note because there is no reference at all.
The permanent note, from books to idea
When I read about literary note (or reference note), it is said I should pick up an interesting passage, write it into my own words and so on.
literary note into multiple "ideas" which are called permanent note.
I really don't see the difference between the aggregated permanent note in my literary note.
This feeling is intensified when I write a technical subject (e.g. http).
Maybe I suffer from misconception and you could provide some keys to understand please.
If someone knows about some basic samples of ZK implementations, it would be great !
Thank you !]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[TL;DR: Please install https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/emacs-gc-stats.html and send the generated statistics via email to emacs-gc-stats@gnu.org after several weeks.
 Many of us know that Emacs defaults for garbage collection are rather ancient and often cause singificant slowdowns. However, it is hard to know which alternative defaults will be better.
 Emacs devs need help from users to obtain real-world data about Emacs garbage collection. See the discussion in https://yhetil.org/emacs-devel/87v8j6t3i9.fsf@localhost/
 I wrote a small package https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/emacs-gc-stats.html that will collect garbage collection stats during Emacs sessions. Please, install it and later (after few weeks) submit the results to emacs-gc-stats@gnu.org
 Usage:
 Add
 (require 'emacs-gc-stats) (setq emacs-gc-stats-gc-defaults 'emacs-defaults) ; optional (emacs-gc-stats-mode +1) 
 to your init file to enable the statistics acquiring.
 When you are ready to share the results, run M-x emacs-gc-stats-save-session and then share the saved emacs-gc-stats-file (defaults to ~/.emacs.d/emacs-gc-stats.eld) by sending an email attachment to <mailto:emacs-gc-stats@gnu.org>.
 You can use M-x emacs-gc-stats-clear to clear the currently collected session data.
 The following data is being collected after every command:
  
 GC settings gc-cons-threshold and gc-cons-percentage
  Emacs version and whether Emacs framework (Doom, Prelude, etc) is used
  Whether gcmh-mode is used
  Idle time and Emacs uptime
  Available OS memory (see memory-info)
  Emacs memory allocation/GC stats
  Current command

 I have found an issue when update the header line(although I am not sure if this even is an issue).
 While displaying information in the header line, not everything is updated at the same time in the *Messages* buffer.
 Code I used to enable header line in scratch buffer:
 (setq wat 0) (defun initialize-header-line () (interactive) (setq header-line-format '(:eval (message (format "header line updated %d" (setq wat (+ wat 1))))))) 
 My question is:
 Why is the header line being updated on every key movement, but the *Messages* buffer doesn't display the "header line updated" on every key movement? Is this expected?
 I also added a gif screencast to show this issue(sorry for the quality, This is the best that I was able to record):

 I also tried
  
 both :map commands under 1 :bind heading
 define-key org-agenda-mode-map style of binding (same error)
  
of note after my startup config loads I can run this execute and it executes which seems to me like there is some load issue with the map during the use-package setup but once my config loads I can "rerun" the code block and make it work...not ideal.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Orgzly is a popular android client that allows you to edit org files in a feature-rich and intuitive way. However, for over 4 years its syncing mechanism for local repositories (not webdav) suffered from a critical bug.
 If you try to delete a file on one of your machines orgzly (running on another machine) will recreate it - meaning you can't ever delete any file in your org-mode directory AND have it synced with orgzly. This makes any form of administration that relies on many disparate files impossible (e.g. org-roam):
 https://github.com/orgzly/orgzly-android/issues/287
 If anyone has any experience with developing on android and would like to support this otherwise great project, this may be a perfect opportunity to do so.
 UPDATE: it is possible that the project might have been abandoned.
 UPDATE2: As mentioned in the comments syncing with WebDAV instead of local directories may not to have this issue. I'm checking if nextcloud provides encryption when using WebDAV (if someone has already configured it please let me know).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I tried Chemacs2 but switching to my Org Mode based Emacs config that has a 'config.org' with 'init.el' doesn't work as easy as just literally using GNU Stow with 'stow -t ~/.emacs.d'. The problem with that is that I have to constantly wipe out that '~/.emacs.d' directory each time, let it install everything, and let 'vterm' compile again which takes a good 5 mins each time.
 ​
 Goal:
  
I'm trying to switch between my normal config and the Spacemacs config.
 This is because I've been trying to check out Spacemacs to see what I like from it to later then adapt it with my own config or just use Spacemacs for web dev projects since I hate configuring LSP myself.
  
​
 Questions:
 Q1. Has anyone with an Org Mode based config used anything similar, and if so, what have you used?
 Q2. Or should I somehow add my actual Emacs config to the Spacemacs config too? If so, how?
  
I ask this because there are some quality of life changes I have in my normal Emacs config that annoy me so much for the defaults for Emacs in general, especially with Org mode defaults sometimes.
  
Thanks

 By default selection seems to include them even when they are toggled off (not shown) in the buffer. Copying such small portions of text frequently to the clipboard can get a bit annoying after a while.
 If you are using evil mode (vim keybindings) key combination v i W will select the entire word and those surrounding characters. It would be nice to find some way to avoid this.

 https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/12517/how-do-i-make-the-timespan-shown-by-org-agenda-start-yesterday
 But this question is about "scrolling" aka "moving agenda view up or down" by adding previous or subsequent days to the view.
 You can change org-agenda-start-day variable, but I'm not sure how to "regenerate" the view then? There also doesn't seem to be an equivalent "org-agenda-end-day"? Perhaps someone knows a better way to approach this?
 SOLUTION: If you are using doom emacs you can "scroll" by showing previous/next "period" with square brackets ([ previous and ] next). Commands are called org-agenda-earlier and org-agenda-later (a bit hard to find).
 If someone still knew how to "scroll" by adding/removing earlier/later days in the current view that would be still very useful.

 Is there a command to write all committed changes to the corresponding files?
 This question was addressed already on emacs stackexchange: https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/477/how-do-i-automatically-save-org-mode-buffers
 The command is org-save-all-org-buffers and is bound by default to C-x C-s
 However what if you have some other org buffers opened that you didn't mean to save when editing org-agenda items at the same time?
 Maybe there is something like org-save-all-org-agenda-buffer to only save the buffers edited in org-agenda?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello guys! I have a SVG image like the following:
 ​
 https://preview.redd.it/pfro6swpqq6b1.png?width=36&format=png&auto=webp&s=65a3bbf2d08af6fcad8d47960e224f488f3b2d00
 It is a simple SVG with a number in it. The SVG file looks something like this:
 <svg ...> <g ...> <text id="my_text" ...> <tspan ...> 6 </tspan> </text> ... </g> </svg> 
 I can load it in purescript Halogen:
 import Halogen.HTML import Halogen.Svg.Elements import Halogen.Svg.Attributes loadImage :: forall w i. HTML w i loadImage = image [x 0.0, y 0.0, width 36.0, height 36.0, href "assets/my_image.svg"] 
 How can I programmatically change the number "6" in it? Can I modify the VDom in the HTML w i? Any other method? Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've repeatedly seen the claim that frequent breaking changes to the language are one reason why Scala isn't more widely adopted in the industry. While I can only speak from my personal experience I don't really see the point here. It seems to me that other languages and ecosystems get away with big changes:
  
Python's adoption has only increased after the infamous 2 -> 3 version change.
 JavaScript itself is backwards-compatible with older versions, but the JS ecosystem keeps changing a lot. For example the industry was happy to adopt React even though it introduces breaking changes with major version updates.
  
What are your takes on this matter? Is feature churn that much higher in Scala? Has language instability been discussed in your organization? Has it impacted any team's decision to use or not use Scala? Will the introduction of LTS versions help Scala's adoption grow in the long-term or will it just make library maintainers happier?

Anyone have experience optimizing their emacs on MacOS as much as possible? I basically run native comp vanilla emacs with only about 100 lines in my init file, which I byte compile (I’m not sure if the init file byte compilation helps?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 All-the-icons maintainer here.
 Over the years, all-the-icons have been inundated by user issues about mis-aligning fonts, tofus and font installation or code point clashing problems. This is all the result of cross-pollination of a set of Web front end tricks of a certain era to Emacs.
 The problems of using icon font are
  
They require extra manual installation of fonts
 Amalgamation of different icon fonts designed for different grids and negative spaces result in non-uniform display of fonts
 Code point clashes
 Updating the fonts and their mappings are painful
 Fonts don't scale properly even with a lot of manual adjustments
 The project gets an incessant amount of issues opened due to all of the above
  
Since last August, I have been experimenting with simply using the SVG sources of these fonts directly instead, and I'm happy to announce that I'm satisfied with the result enough that I want to invite the community to try out the SVG branch.
 There are now over 18000 icons included in the package, and over 31000 when you count all the variations. Chances are, if you are looking for an icon that looks good and appropriate, it's probably in there.
 The public API largely remains the same, but there are some backward incompatible changes in the private APIs. Please refer to the README for details.
 Judging from Github searches, these changes do not appear to cause too much breakage, but I could be wrong. Please let me know on Github as I do not plan to come back to Reddit too often because of a certain u/spez.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I'm interested in creating forms using org-mode where information entered beneath each heading can be saved to an sqlite database, with each org-mode heading being the column heading for the sql table.
 I am using the emacsql package for saving the information to the database, and so long as the entries are placed in a vector, an emacsql function will be able to save the entries to the sql table.
 With the help of chatgpt, I've found several ways of parsing the org-mode headers and saving the entries within each header to a vector. When I display the vector in emacs, the entries look exactly as I would expect.
 However, when I save them to the database, each entry not only includes the text that I want, but a bunch of elisp code around it that appears to be coding the relative position of the text within the org file. It's as if the text has a bunch of Metadata attached to it that is invisible within emacs but becomes visible when taken out of emacs and put into the database. I've tried many different ways but all end with the same outcome.
 It's clear that there's a problem with the methods im using, so I'm wondering if anyone has been able to successfully do something like this before or has some suggestions as to why this is happening and how to fix it. Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone,
 ​
 I'm new to ZIO and currently exploring the concepts of ZIO environment, ZLayers, and ZEnvironment. As I delve into the ZIO documentation and source code, I feel like I'm missing a few pieces to fully grasp how they fit together. I'd greatly appreciate your insights in helping me form a complete picture.
 ​
 In the `ZIO[R, E, A]` effect, the type parameter `R` is referred to as the environment type or the ZIO environment of type `R`. The ZIO environment can be constructed by composing ZLayers. By using accessor methods provided by the ZIO datatype, we can access the ZIO environment of a specific type to execute the effect.
 ​
 Here's where I am seeking clarification: Is it correct to say that ZIO constructs the ZIO environment of the required type `R` from the ZIO environment built by composing the layers? The ZIO environment constructed from the layers will have a different type, but ZIO effects need a specific ZIO environment of a particular type.
 ​
 Furthermore, I am curious about the role of ZEnvironment in all of this. How does it fit into the overall picture?
 ​
 I am grateful for any insights or explanations you can provide to help me better understand these concepts and their interactions.
 ​
 Thank you in advance!

This example removes star buffers from the main buffer source and creates a new source for them.

I think the problem may be due to a mismatch of C version between the code and clangd. But how can I tell clangd to check a specific version of C (eg. C99)?
 (Edit) I just tried to use `c-ts-mode`, and for some reason the linting issues went away but I still cannot jump using (M-.).

 One of the challenges with cross-compiling Emacs is the dumping. Perhaps a way around that is to just use “temacs”, which avoids the dumping step.

 Every time I start a new course I have to navigate across all these pages and archive everything that I could possibly need: slides, assignments, exams from previous years, etc...
 However, there are a bunch of issues:
  
Storing everything in the file system is a mess: not everything can be stored as a file. Some things (like an online quiz) are meant to be stored as simple bookmarks. This heterogeneity breaks the purpose of "having only one place to look at" for me
 
Given "exam-2-4-2005.pdf", I'd like to write some information related to it: whether i have already done it, and the solution. Sometimes the solution is on paper, so all I need to write is a simple number that corresponds to the page on my paper notebook.
 
 Using org mode, I can link both local files and Http URLs (also pdf pages!). I could also write notes related to each one of them.
 Does any of you have a similar workflow in your Emacs routine? Is there some suggestion or package that could aid me for this purpose? This is the first time I use org for something beyond note taking, so I really do not have any "concrete" idea on how to achieve all this.

[2023-06-17 14:21:23] This and that has been said...
 [2023-06-17 14:21:57] And then that other thing...
  
Yas snippet or org-time-stamp commands let you add a timestamp anywhere in the document, but it may get tedious with larger lists. Ideally there would be some way for a timestamp to be bound to the new item creation? Would you just add a yasnippet to a new keybinding (for example Ctrl+Shift+RET)? If anyone has such an example in their config I would really appreciate it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently, I tried to use Eglot + pyright on Django project.
 But pyright doesn't works as expected, can not get completion on when import django.db.model
 Any one known how to make pyright works with Django?
 Steps to reproduce:
 ​
  
setup project
  
​
 mkdir django-project cd django-project python3 -m venv ./.venv .venv/bin/python3 -m pip install django source .venv/bin/activate django-admin startproject CoreRoot . django-admin startapp core python manage.py migrate python manage.py runserver 
  
Install Pyright
  
sudo npm install -g pyright
  
Install pyvenv for activate virtual environment in Emacs
 (use-package pyvenv :hook (python-mode . pyvenv-mode) :config (setq pyvenv-post-activate-hooks (list (lambda () (setq python-shell-interpreter (concat pyvenv-virtual-env (if (eq system-type 'windows-nt) "scripts/python" "bin/python")))))))
 
Start Emacs and open the file: django-project/core/models.py
 
M-x pyvenv-activate and choose the .venv directory
 
M-x eglot, and choose pyright-langserver
 
Try some example code in django-project/core/models.py as below:
 from django.db import models
 class Person(models.Model): first_name = models.CharField(max_length=30) last_name = models.CharField(max_length=30)
 
You find that you can't get completion for "CharField", see pictures as below:
 
 ​
 can get models
 ​
 Can not get CharField
 ​
 9 . I also tried python-language-server(pylsp), it can get completion but the server is a little slow, I can feel delay while input characters.
 ​
 works as expected with pylsp
 You can test with this example project: https://github.com/Eason0210/django-project.git
 My personal Emacs config: https://github.com/Eason0210/.emacs.d
 my Emacs version:
 GNU Emacs 30.0.50 (build 1, x86_64-apple-darwin22.5.0, NS appkit-2299.60 Version 13.4 (Build 22F66), git sha1 8657afac774) of 2023-06-16

        <link href="https://forum.zettelkasten.de/discussion/2598/zettel-view-a-vs-code-extension-to-list-zettels-by-h1-header"/>
        <updated>2023-06-17T05:13:18.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[ChatGPT and I collaborated on a Visual Studio Code extension to display a list of markdown files by their H1 header. The extension is called Zettel View, and it contributes a Zettlr-like display of Zettels to the VS Code Explorer View, as shown below.

Clicking on any file in the Zettel View window opens the Zettel markdown file in an editor window and causes the file explorer to highlight the selected file.  Since I installed the "Auto-Open Markdown Preview" VS Code extension, the markdown preview of the selected Zettel also appears.
The Zettel View extension for VS Code is available on my GitHub account.
Zettel View makes some assumptions about Zettels. First, Zettels are markdown files with the extension .md. Second, a markdown file's H1 or level-one header has the form # ID TITLE (the ID is to the left; some prefer the ID on the right). Third, ID matches a regular expression specific to my ID scheme. Fourth, ID.md is the filename of the Zettel markdown file with the header # ID TITLE.
The second and third assumptions are hard-coded but could be made configurable in later versions of the extension. The fourth assumption isn't enforced: a mismatch between ID.md and the filename will appear as a discrepancy between the Zettel selected in the Zettel View and the file explorer. A warning will be emitted in that case.
Zettr has the built-in configuration setting, "Display files using first heading level 1 if available." A community plugin for Obsidian called "File Explorer Markdown Titles" once produced a similar display in the Obsidian file explorer. Unfortunately, that plugin no longer works with newer versions of Obsidian. Since VS Code is more valuable for my work than Obsidian, it made more sense to develop a VS Code extension than to modify the plugin to work with the current Obsidian API. I plan to move to VS Code the Pandoc and LaTeX integration I configured in Zettlr.]]></summary>

When I insert headings code blocks are automatically indented - which is what I want - but white arrows appear for each indentation and these are overlayed with gray blocks (a bit like Visual blocks), which I don't want. Nothing I have tried seems to get rid of either the arrows or the gray blocks. Is there some function that shuts this off as it's visually really distracting? Thx in advance... 
 P.S. The white arrows might be difficult to see under the gray block but they are there sure enough!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently I have been doing some programming in python. I have got it working nicely in Emacs - I may share my configuration another time.
 I'm have a problem with imports though. In Python you bring in a library by "importing" it. I often have to edit libraries that are part of the project I'm working on. The problem is that in Python 3 you can't unload a library, nor can you replace it with a newer version.
 This is a problem because Emacs python-mode is based around the idea of sending python code to a python shell. This works fine unless imports get involved. Once imports get involved you run into the problem that python will never re-import a library after it has imported it once. So, if you're editing a library the only way to update to the new version (which could be what you just wrote) is to stop the python process and start another one.
 Is there a fix for this? Has anyone written a package to at least make constantly restarting python more convenient?

 So far, this has been working great -- until I had to write template implementation files:
 Refresher: 
  
In non-templated C++, #include "header.hpp" goes at start of implementation.cpp file.
 
In templated C++, #include "implementation.tpp" goes at end of header.hpp file. 
 
 Basically, since implementation.tpp doesn't explicitly "include" its header definitions, the LSP thinks I am just writing out things without defining them, resulting in a bunch of squiggly lines.
 I know a lot of people just put their template implementation code in the header file, but I really want to keep it separate. Have any C++ users encountered this problem before and found a solution? Thanks.

 * TODO Task 1 * TODO Task 2 * TODO Task 3 
 After some time you complete these tasks and want to add new ones. Where do you add them? Do you add them to the same file? Do you create a new file after the first one gets too big? Do you manually perform clean up of the file every so often?
 It may be unrelated, but I'm wondering how do you add new entries? I imagine that if file gets really big opening and navigating it may get slow after some time. Do you have custom capture templates for that? Do you manually open that file navigate to the top or bottom and add entries there?
 There seems to be a lot of manual processes involved here, which I assume people have figured out how to automate already, but I can't quite find out where.
 In org agenda calendar view there is some mention of a "diary file" - is that the place where these entries should be stored instead of organizing them manually?

 There is now a new version of the function with improved interface and functionality, you can find it in the post above, or directly in the gitlab repo. The corresponding snippet can be found here.
 Hope it helps, I'm looking forward to any kind of feedback.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello!
 I hope you're all having a great day. I'm a newbie to Emacs, and I've been doing some exploring to find the best fit for me. I started with Spacemacs, but to be honest, it felt overwhelming, and I couldn't get all its spirit.
 Then, I gave Doom Emacs a shot, and I was simpler, yet it still seems to have all the functionality I need. For me, doom-emacs offers me a great experience, though. 
 That said, I have a minor concern. I noticed they released the last significant update back in March. More concerning, though, is that there seem to be quite a few unanswered pull requests, some of which appear to be pretty important in terms of features or fixes.
 So, in my complete ignorance, I first want to ask you guys experts about the situation. 
 Is Doom Emacs still being actively maintained? If not, what do you think is the best way, return to Spacemacs or try another configuration kit? 
 Thanks for your insights and suggestions. 
 Best.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi guys! I want to export a certain company/project TODO list I am working on, to a CSV file, in order to produce a shareable ongoing progress report of my work onlne. I've gotten the Emacs built in macro org-batch-agenda-csv working somewhat using a command like this:
 (org-batch-agenda-csv "MYTAG1|MYTAG2")
 Where I'm struggling is with date/time information. I assumed that if my TODOs have a typical SCHEDULED attribute that i'd easily discover date/time info in the generated csv. So far, no such luck.
 The help for org-batch-agenda-csv macro talks about optional (rest) Parameters that "are alternating variable names and values that will be bound before running the agenda command." This sounds extremely useful but I'm not sure how to proceed without perhaps examples of how these could be used for some typical uses.
 There are also a handful of references to date/time things in both the Emacs online help for the macro, and in the elisp macro definition. I am not an Emacs Lisp expert though and so far my randomish trial and error has gone nowhere.
 Can you help?
 Thanks!

 So,
 I'm writing an application using vanilla js + WebGL and my development stack is:
  
emacs
 lsp-mode
 company-mode
 ts-ls installed through emacs
  
My LSP config is here, and I'm open to suggestions for improving it.
 Completion works fine for the core parts of javascript, e.g. getElementByID() and friends. But if I want to call into, let's say, the canvas API, I don't have completion working. Here's an example:
 var canvas = document.getElementById("foo"); var ctx = canvas.getContext("bar"); 
 screenshot
 Note how the getContext isn't offered by the language server as a completion option.
 Here's a second example:
 xmlr = new XMLHttpRequest(); xmlr.open('GET', url, false); 
 Similarly, the open isn't offered as a completion option.
 How do I fix this? I've tried setting both a tsconfig.json and a jsconfig.json with the following contents:
 { "compilerOptions": { "target": "es2020", "lib": ["es2020"], "module": "commonjs" } } 
 But no dice. I still don't get completion in the examples above.
 What do?

 the cd works but when I try to open the agenda I get "org-agenda-files cannot be a single directory".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today I finally found a few hours to implement 2 features from swiper that I missed in consult-line:
 ​
  
Smart recenter: buffer is recentered only if you jump to match outside of current view. (This can be done in a pretty non-invasive way via hooks)
 Highlighting of matches on all visible lines in buffer. This is a noticeable patch to core consult code. Instead of creating a patch/fork, I just put into a separate file which I load after consult itself, it redefines quite a few core functions. It might break with newer consult versions.
  
​
 Feel free to try: https://gist.github.com/lazy/4f609cf2b956de2531885747e3c3bf88
 Save it to "consult-patch.el" file, open in emacs, M-x eval-buffer, run consult-line, search for something like "let" and enjoy.
 ​
 UPD: gist was updated at least once. Overlay caching didn't move overlays between windows. Now it doef.
 ​
 P.S. I saw another approach to doing that: https://github.com/minad/consult/pull/774. But minad decided not to merge it due to perf and personal preference. Mine is a little better performance-wise: it checks for highlighting only visible candidates and caches the highlight overlays (of which there can be many). But I am not sure if I will be able to overcome minad's personal preference, so don't want to bother with PR. If someone wants to polish this code and try merge into mainline, I won't mind. Think of this code as "public domain".
 P.P.S. I don't use swiper because I have quite a lot of custom vertico/vertico-posframe/consult configuration which I do not want to replicate for swiper.

 ​
 I am trying to generate a report from an org file with R code blocks.
 ​
 Blocks are defined such as:
 ​
 #+begin_src R :results output round(cov(phenmz1),3) #+end_src 
 ​
 And I have an option at the header:
 #+PROPERTY: exports both

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Langchain significantly accelerates the development of large language models (LLMs). I'm curious if Scala can offer suitable implementations, based on its language features, to make the development of asynchronous streaming text applications easier, just like popular older Scala projects in the field of big data.
 AI and LLM have made Python great again; perhaps Scala can demonstrate its power in new domains.
 P.S. I'm currently working on a closed-source Java-lang project for our LLM project, built on Reactor. Just asking for fun.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Here's the 1.0.0 version of FxCalculator
 It's, well, a calculator for your Android phone.
 It's got all the usual buttons with numbers and operators, and also parentheses as well as buttons for storing the partial results of your calculations to the memory.
 But that's not all. It also has an advanced editor hidden under the "Fx" button. In that mode, you can write an expression with your virtual keyboard, as if you were writing simple programming code. You can use variables and functions from a list, combine them, and even write your own custom ones. They will be stored on the phone so they can be actually useful to you more than once.
 And, on top of that, FxCalculator was written in Scala 3, with JavaFX, Gluon, and GraalVM Native Image. For now it's available only as APK stored on GitHub. You can install it by allowing 3rd party APK installation on your Android, clicking the link above on your phone, and then downloading and installing the APK from there.
 I will try to push the app to the Google store and create a better looking webpage for it later this year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I gave a quick run around the posts about emacs server/daemon and I have a couple of questions
  
If you don't put any special arguments by default and you run emacs --daemon this will have a Unix socket right? Which means that both server and client will be on localhost.
 You can also specify a TCP socket allowing the server and the client to live on separate hosts. Is this right?
 Finally, if and when this happens when you edit files with emacsclient do you edit files on the client side or on the server side? Would this be a good use for editing files both on the server and the client? Or you should have something separate to edit files on the server? i.e. use git or ssh or nextcloud
  
Thank you very much for your help.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I often browse though tweets using the nitter.net site, which is basically a scrape of the text and images on twitter.com. 
 Over the past month or so, images in tweets shown in nitter have stopped displaying in EWW, but can be seen on an external browser like Firefox. 
 For instance, in this tweet, there is a profile picture and an embedded .jpg image of a football/soccer player which both show up in Firefox. However, when viewed in EWW only the poster's profile picture is shown. This is not the case for images that show up as "previews" of webpages, e.g. in this tweet, both the profile picture and the previewed image of aircraft from the article both show up in EWW.
 I thought this issue would explain why, but the images I see in Firefox are .jpg, not webp. This might still be a nitter issue, but I would be interested to understand why this has happened.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As a follow-up to this old thread, I am pleased to announce the first release of the Kreuzberg Library.
 The library's primary purpose is to simplify the creation of declarative ScalaJS components.
 The concept is straightforward:
  
Components can subscribe to models, which contain some state.
 Components declare event bindings (e.g., click events) that, in turn, modify models.
 If a model changes, the components emit new HTML (including event bindings and sub-components).
 The new HTML gets rendered.
  
Additionally, Channels are included, which offer n:m communication and can be incorporated into event bindings (as sources and sinks).
 HTML rendering can be performed via Scalatags and Scala XML, but other mechanisms can also be implemented.
 The rendering engine can be changed. Currently, there are two simple client-side engines available: a simple imperative, and a ZIO-Based.
 A proof-of-concept RPC system is also available. You can declare a trait for a service, and macros will generate a stub for the client (ScalaJS) app and dispatcher code for the server side. In the examples, this is used to implement a TODO app with server-side storage.
 Components, Models, and Channels are identified by IDs, which are currently auto-incremented. This isn't entirely functional. I've experimented with other ideas, like creating IDs via a State-Monad, but they ended up being less practical.
 I'd love to hear your thoughts on this.

 I've tried cycling visibility to show level one headers only and doing a visual selection of line Foo2 and Foo3 then using regexp-replace and :s/... but in both cases the replacement takes place on the folded lines under Foo2 and Foo3 too.
 * Foo1 ** Sub * Foo2 ** Sub * Foo3 ** Sub * Foo4 ** Sub 
 UPDATE Setting search-invisible to nil prior to the replacement, works as long as 1) I use regexp-replace, and 2) the search is for plain text (not a regexp) only. 
 If I search for $ then neither regexp-replace nor :substitute work.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am starting a process via start-process-shell-command. The command starts server, and is actually never "finished" as the server is continuously running. However, one can infer when this command is finished, that is to say when the server is up and running, by looking at the output (i.e. when the string "Server is running!" is observed in the output).
 I want to code up an Elisp function that calls the command, wait until the server is up and running, and only then execute the next step. How would I best do this?
 My current method is check the relevant process-buffer every 0.5 sec (with sleep-for) to see if the known regex pattern is observed, however this seems a bit sub-optimal. In particular I am unable to use Emacs until the pattern is observed (even though my process is async).
 I have tried to read up on process filters as my understanding is that they are functions which receive output from processes, but I can't figure out a way to "wait" until the regex pattern is observed via filters.
 Does anyone have any idea how to reliably achieve this, or any pointers on where I should look to understand process filters better to get to my solution?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I haven’t really used emacs too much yet, but I love the idea of using it for taking notes and organizing my life with org mode. Funny enough, I feel like I’m procrastinating organizing my life cause I’m thinking “wait I need to get org mode set up first”.
 The problem is, I’ve seen people say it takes YEARS to understand emacs and that it has an incredibly high learning curve. I wouldn’t mind using something like doom or centaur, but at the same time, it seems weird to use a preconfigured editor and not understand what’s going on underneath the hood, especially if there’s an issue and I don’t know how to fix it. You think that’s a big deal or is using those preset editors perfectly fine? I’m looking to use vim bindings so I wonder if I should just stay with doom.
 I’m planning on reading “Mastering Emacs”, working through the built in tutorial, the elisp tutorial (maybe, but it seems weird to not understand the language the entire applications is built and configured in), and maybe Emacs from Scratch and the org mode udemy tutorial by Rainer Konig.
 After all that maybe I’ll know enough to build my own config, or at least understand a lot of what goes on in doom or centaur or something.

with the concept of property-based testing, and have first hand
experience with a framework like QuickCheck or hedgehog. You might
also have heard of the term “fuzzing” in various places, and it sounds
just like what we’ve already been doing for so long, right? Just
generate a bunch of random test inputs, in the hope of exposing an
unknown bug?
Well, actually there’s more to it than that! Recently, I had some fun
exploring coverage-guided fuzzers like AFL++ and libFuzzer. Along
the way, I discovered a simple trick that allows us to compile Haskell
code in a manner that these fuzzers can handle. The experience was
akin to unlocking a hidden skill. I can say, without a doubt, that
coverage-guided fuzzing can work wonders. Thi…]]></summary>

 When I open some.cfg in emacs, conf-mode is selected. But if I do M-x sh-mode after that, the sh-mode settings from .dir-locals.el are applied (the sh-basic-offset and fill-column).
 Why it ignores the auto-mode-alist clause? My emacs is from ubuntu 22.04 repositories, version 27.1+1-3ubuntu5.
 Yes, I tried starting it with the -q option, the behavior is the same.

 I use org with neovim, instead of Emacs. So the package khalel was not useful for me.

 treesitter-inspect-mode tells me that I'd need to highlight nodes matching a query like jsx_opening_element "<", jsx_opening_element ">", etc. I saw the recent Mastering Emacs article on Treesitter which was very helpful in getting started, but it wasn't clear to me how to customize fine details like this.

I would have thought this is something done commonly but I'm having issues. At first I made the method like so:
 partitionInPlace[A <: Ordered[A]] (...
 But it turns out common AnyVal types such as Int and Double don't extend Ordered, so that's not suitable. They extend Ordering but that's not quite the same and it seems silly to use a function such as "gteq" instead of a simple operator.
 I have a feeling the solution is some kind of implicit conversion? Please help, I'm kind of new to Scala and I'm sure this is a common issue.

 I installed the elixir-mode M-x package-install [RET] elixir-mode [RET]
 https://github.com/elixir-editors/emacs-elixir
 and added
 (load-file "~/.emacs.d/elpa/elixir-mode-2.4.0/elixir-mode.el") (require 'elixir-mode) 
 to ~/.emacs
 But elixir's files are still in fundamental mode, I guess I'm missing something ?
 Thank you for your help :)
 ​
 EDIT: Thank you the problem is solving :)
 I added this in ~/.emacs
 (require 'package) (add-to-list 'package-archives '("melpa" . "https://melpa.org/packages/") t) 
 and installed elixir-mode via M-x list-packages who created elixir-mode-20221017.2044 folder and now it's working :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone, I've been programming in Java but wanted to try something new from the ecosystem and chose Scala. However, I've encountered a major problem. Sbt starts syncing my projects but never finishes. I even let it run for entire day and nothing happened.
 I've tried basic troubleshooting: reinstalling IntelliJ Idea (2023.1.2), running different versions of sbt ( 1.9.2, 1.8.3, 1.8.2, 1.7.3 ), reinstalling Scala (2.13.19 and 2.13.17), disabling Windows Defender, installing different JDKs (19, 17, 11, 1.8), removing .lock, file, checking logs - they are empty. I even upgraded from Windows 10 to Windows 11.
 I know that Scala works better on Linux, but I tested a similar scenario on my friend's Windows 10 laptop and it worked like a charm. 
 Here's screenshot of my last attempt:
 https://preview.redd.it/28f2b7ajou5b1.png?width=1232&format=png&auto=webp&s=30ef0f584998bae20641a352c08ee6307dcc70a3
 Honestly, i have no idea what else I can do. I've read through many GitHub issues for sbt and nothing has helped. Has anyone else encountered simillar problem? Any tips or suggestions on what I can do next would be greatly appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am in the midst of thinking about my overall workflow, may even setup a Linux box to use for work (right now on Mac).
 I've been using Obsidian for notes, it kinda works. But have been thinking about Org mode for a while now for both my personal notes and work notes.
 Generally, I'm assigned to a project/client for a period of time. I have thought about creating an org folder in home then a org/client for the client or project then something like: - meetings.org for meetings and calls - notes.org for client or project specific notes - tickets.org for any sort of ticketing system they use to help keep track of those without having to login to the ticket system.
 TODOs would of course roll up to Org Agenda.
 More general notes would be in the main Org file.
 Any tips or thoughts on how to manage a similar workflow? Open to ideas.
 I would setup some capture templates to make it easier to add data to these. Maybe even org-roam at some point.
 I would have to start small and expand as I go. Just working on thinking through the mental model. I plan to start working on reading the org manual, any other recommended resources would be appreciated.

For example assuming my table has 3 fields - name, assgn1, assgn2 and I want to sum the assignments (assgn1, assgn2) but each one has a different gravity, for example, assgn1 65% the other 35% so both sum to 100 but with different proportion.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've written a working(!) org-capture extension for org-protocol. It's Firefox-only at the moment but I'm happy to accept patches to support Chromium based browsers. I wrote it because none of the current extensions/bookmarklets were all that usable (security popups, no hotkeys, etc.).
 Features include:
  
Hotkeys. One for storing links, one for capturing the page (or selected text, if there's a selected region).
 Context menu items for capturing: 
 A link to the current page, along with a description pulled from the page's metadata.
 Selected text. Optionally, selections can be captured as HTML. You'll want to use this with something like org-protocol-capture-html to translate the HTML to org mode.
 Media (images, video, etc.). Media can be (optionally) downloaded (through your browser's download manager) before capturing.
 
 A browser action button to perform some default action on click (can either store a link to the current page, or initiate a capture).
 Optionally, capturing a selection will capture the HTML itself. You'll want to use this with something like org-protocol-capture-html to translate the HTML to org mode.

Do you think there are some features it is lacking that scala has which java will add in future?

 Does anyone know what are the closest alternatives to functional scala using cats effect or zio?
 Do any other languages (that companies hire for) allow the same effect driven monad\IO FP style? 
 From what I've seen, haskell is the closest alternative, but I was wondering if there are others I'm not aware of.
 I really like the style of developing that scala with cats effect\zio allows, but I think it might be a good idea to look into another language(s) that encourages this style\methodology too, in order to increase the amount of potential companies I can apply to. 
 Many thanks.

 Everything is in the title :) 
  
did you experimen with the feature ? 
 what do you think of it ? 
 any lib using them rn ? or example projet ? I would be extra interested in error handling examples 
  
I've started playing around with boundaries and breaks for the fun of it with the objective of implementing an async/await ( but I guess dotty-cps-async existing and looking great kinda killed my motivation ^^ ) and making scala more Rust-like with Result<E, A> and "nice" ( all a matter of perspective folks, don't burn me to the stakes yet ) overloadings with .? and .! . Very rough right now though
 I'd welcome any suggestion if you have a lookt at mine, and would very much like to see yours !

 It begins from first principles, i.e. the motion of the players and the ball rather than from some existing statistical analysis of football. The idea is instead to work backwards from those statistical models and tweak the physical parameters until something approximating the real game of football emerges. I hope that this approach sets the simulation up for success as the application of data and analysis to football evolves and better statistical measures of success become increasingly available.
 Motivation
 There are clearly a number of existing football simulation games that are wildly more advanced and capable than this simple hobby project. The closed source and commercial nature of these alternatives makes f…]]></summary>

If your Zk is file-based, uses a UID as part of the file name, like 202306XXX..., and you have Python and dependencies installed; it should work for you.

 Does anybody have some tips to throw ny way perhaps ?
 thx. S
 edit: yes, yes it is possible:
 ``` defaults tls on tls_starttls on logfile ~/.cache/msmtp.log

 turns out, I had the token stored with encryption and forgot to add the -e xxx@xxx argument....

 I had used XEmacs in the early 2000s, before Emacs 21 or 22, don't remember. But one of the things I liked more, was that help buffers and other popup windows, get focused straight away, so they are easier to navigate and to close, just by using the normal movement keys and q. I always thought it was much nicer than the default in GNU Emacs, where the popup window is not focused so you use C-M-v and C-M-V to scroll it and C-x 1 to get rid of the help window.
 After a short period of XEmacs, I brought with me that XEmacs behavior for help buffers to GNU Emacs. I've been doing that for more than 20 years.
 Well, from the XEmacs changelog: 
  
Improve: Help buffer behaviour synced with GNU (Mats Lidell)
  
I laughed so hard :D

 New in this issue:
 - support for boundary/break API, which was introduced in Scala-3.3.0
 - changed API for custom monad contexts -- now monad context should provide an instance of monad with possible intercepted operations instead await interceptor. This is needed for unification with context-encoded direct style, where we can have no await-s. [And last relative significant change, for which we had kept the '0.x' versioning scheme].

 I am wrassling with outlook365 and I want to move from thunderbird to mu4e and I have finally been able to get mbsync to login and download the mails. However, with thunderbird I have set up an Archives/[YEAR] subfolders structure that I have used for years with my personal mail that also works as advertised in mu4e.
 But with outook365 I get :
 IMAP warning: ignoring mailbox Archives/2022 (reserved character '/' in name) IMAP warning: ignoring mailbox Archives/2023 (reserved character '/' in name) IMAP warning: ignoring mailbox Calendar/Birthdays (reserved character '/' in name) IMAP warning: ignoring mailbox Calendar/United States holidays (reserved character '/' in name) 
 Which I thought/expected to be flattened into Archives.2022 like in my personal setup.
 This is the relevan mbsynrc snippet: ``` IMAPStore outlook-remote Account xxxxxx PathDelimiter "."
 MaildirStore outlook-local Path ~/Mail/outlook/ #trailing / is important ! Inbox ~/Mail/outlook/INBOX
 Flatten "."
 Subfolders Verbatim
 InfoDelimiter "_"
 Channel outlook Far :outlook-remote: Near :outlook-local: Patterns * INBOX* Create Near Expunge Near SyncState * Sync All ```
 Does anybody have some tips or tricks up their sleeve perhaps ?
 thx S

 As part of my Master thesis, I would like study some of Akka's internals, i.e. the code machinery that allow actors and Behaviors to work.
 I am aware of the Actor Architecture's documentation, but I am looking for something different:
  
What are the most important components that allow an actor to come into existence and communicate with others? How do these components interact?
 When an actor does a tell, what components does the message go through until the receiving side processes it?
  
I examined the source code a bit; my understanding is that the ActorCell class is crucial; however, being an implementation component that is not to be touched by users directly, it is not covered by the user documentation. Similar reasoning for the ActorRefProvider class.
 Up until now I have found this resource (it provides a very useful component diagram); I am looking for similar resources, and possibly more comprehensive ones.
 Any resource would be helpful (even conference talks). Thanks for your inputs.

And also, if you have any suggestions based on my taste above, please recommend me fonts to try out (if possible with the lisp code on your init.el so that its easy for me).
 P.S. I also like the red code font used on reddit here

I decided I wanted to explore Clojure again but now, when I run cider-jack-in, if I type an expression and hit Enter, it just creates newlines repeatedly, but does not evaluate.
 I have tried some troubleshooting steps, but have not had any success. What I've tried so far is:
  
Clear out ~/.emacs.d/elpa and let the packages install fresh.
 Upgrade leiningen (with brew on macOS), start a new Clojure project and core.clj file and try to jack in to that. (Has the same behavior.)
 Enabled logging for nrepl-server. No errors are logged.
  
Interestingly, if I run C-x C-e next to an expression in core.clj, it evaluates normally, but the REPL no longer works.
 Could you please suggest more troubleshooting steps or a possible fix? I am running EmacsforOSX version 28.2. I searched the web but have not yet found someone who encountered this same problem.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi folks, 
 I found the following in Section 16.10 of the Emacs Lisp Info Manual for Emacs 28.2: 
 "Normally, well-designed Lisp programs should not use with-eval-after-load. If you need to examine and set the variables defined in another library (those meant for outside use), you can do it immediately—there is no need to wait until the library is loaded."
 Some obvious exceptions to setting variables "immediately" spring to mind, such as modifying a library's keymaps with define-key(). The keymaps must already exist, of course, which happens only after the library is loaded. I don't doubt that the manual authors had situations like that in mind with their beginning caveat, "Normally . . ." 
 But more generally: what if the library, upon loading, overwrites -- with its own default values -- the values the user had earlier set? 
 It seems to me that it's safer to put all setq()s and whatnot into with-eval-after-load and be done with it. Or are there benefits to the blunter "don't bother waiting" approach that I'm missing? 
 This comment from the Info Manual is tormenting me: I would sooner die than write an ill-designed Lisp program!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On May 31, 2023, Reddit announced they were raising the price to make calls to their API from being free to a level that will kill every third party app on Reddit. More background information here. The recent "Ask Me Anything" session with the CEO of Reddit didn't really address the concerns of people, and some subreddits decided that they would shutdown indefinitely.
 I think /r/haskell as a community should be discussing what action to take. On a personal level, this subreddit is pretty dear to me, as it has been my go-to place to keep up to date with the Haskell news over the years, and has been an invaluable source of information when I first started learning the language. So I guess my (kind of open-ended) question is: what is the stance of /r/haskell regarding the events happening on the broader Reddit? I am aware that a bunch of communities are migrating to some federated, open-source alternatives, most popular being Lemmy. Would us as a community consider such a mass exodus? The admin of functional.cafe, a Mastodon instance for the FP community, has recently been gauging interest in spinning up a Lemmy instance, maybe some arrangement could be made through cooperative effort?
 I have created this thread to hopefully seed some useful discussion surrounding these. I am looking forward to hear what the community thinks in general.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In my setup I use a file for each "project" i.e.
  
Tasks - personal tasks
 Work - for work tasks
 Config - for tasks related to updating my config
 Game Design - tabletop game design tasks
 Programming Study - for learning / growing my programming knowledge
  
You get the idea. Each of these have a filetag so that everything is tagged and I have use categories for top level task types i.e. tasks/meetings/reminders etc (this lets me use category icons)
 The issue I have is for negative filtering. Say I want to filter out JUST my work and config tasks for say the weekend when I can work on a variety of personal projects.
 The documentation (here) states:
 C-u / Hide entries matching a tag. You can successively call this command to hide several tags. 
 If I call this and use Work it filters out work options. I call it again and the prompt is pre-filled with the text "-work" if i change it to "config" then work comes back. So I though maybe it should be "-work-config" when i do this it removes config but brings back work. I'm at a complete loss on how to apply multiple negative filters.
 I've also tried using \ for the Tag filter only mode not the more universal / filter. There same thing if I exclude work and run \ again and exclude config it brings work back

 Documentation on the native android port is hard to find; searching tends to give me decades old stack overflow questions and lots of info about termux.
 Are there good docs about configuring the Android port?
 Maybe the ideal at this point would be just to be able to point the native port to the .emacs.d I have already set up in termux, if there's a way to do that?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm currently using Debian-stable, known for its reliability. However, packages in the Debian repository tend to become outdated over time. Therefore, I chose to download the Emacs source tarball and compile it myself, which was successful. Recently, I came across the Guix package manager, which can be installed on Debian. Based on my research, guix install emacs installs Emacs in its own environment without requiring sudo access. This approach seems to reduce the likelihood of future dependency issues and makes package management easier. Is my understanding correct?
 I also observed that GUIX installed a daemon of some sort. I'm curious if this daemon consumes a significant amount of memory, considering it runs in the background continuously.
 Is it possible to install Emacs using GUIX while allowing the management of other packages to be handled by "use-package" as in my old configuration?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Helm is useful in most cases, but it is sometimes very annoying because it doesn't let me put what I want, maybe because it's not in the list. Sometimes helm lets me do that by choosing question mark [?], but that's not always the case.
 One example I experienced today. I'm using spacemacs with helm. I did find-file to a remote directory with TRAMP. So I'm in dired. From there I put M-x shell and it asked me the remote shell path. The default shown in helm text area is "/bin/sh" which is a reasonable default. But helm does not let me press enter there. So I can't open a remote shell.
 I thought there would be a way to just force put "/bin/sh", but I couldn't find any ways. C-f, C-z or whatever didn't work. I'm pretty surprised that helm does not have any unified way to fallback if there are no ways for a mature feature that existed such a long time.
 BTW, for that specific issue, I solved it with this elisp code, but I'm still curious if there's a way to fallback on helm.

 There is a quarto-mode, unfortunately it is not being actively developed (and my elisp skills are not good enough to submit meaningful PRs).
 Personally, I was unable to get quarto-mode to work for me as-is. The quarto-preview command does not work for me as it does not pick up the correct virtualenv, not even with pyvenv. Hence, I started to code up my own custom quarto-preview function, and continued to further write up some really basic elisp functions to make it work for me.
 My setup is summarised here: https://gist.github.com/fast-90/3d7ce3252fff59b0f6d6d1bcadcf4938
 Basically my workflow is (I only use it with Python):

However, for calendar (keep track of birthdays, holidays, this kind of stuff) or contacts i prefer to use CalDAV and CardDAV since I can use NextCloud for this and also it can well integrate with my smartphone.
 ​
 However, Akonadi (the PIM suite from KDE) is pretty unreliable. I'd like to interact with CalDAV and CardDAV from desktop nicely, but it really hangs more often than not. Is there a way to achieve this with Emacs?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Does anyone know why org-download might be adding image links with different urls (download:)? When adding this to config.el (doom emacs):
 (after! org-download (setq org-download-method 'directory) (setq org-download-image-dir (concat (file-name-sans-extension (buffer-file-name)) "-img")) (setq org-download-image-org-width 600)) 
 links appear as download:<PATH-TO-FILE> instead of file:<PATH-TO-FILE>. Then they don't display correctly unless you manually change that url to file:.
 I assume that it must be detecting the file type and at some point decide to use a specific type of url (there is file: in source code, so it should be possible).
 It seems that by default org-downlaod just uses the standard org-mode's attachment mechanism. The question though is why doesn't changing org-download-method to directory switches it to a "download" url type.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If anyone is interested, I've created an Atom backend for Gnus, which can be found here.
 I posted it to the Emacs development mailing list, but unfortunately it doesn't seem like there's much interest in it currently.
 The only major remaining issue with it is that it doesn't use Gnus' inheritance system, since I keep running into weird issues trying to implement it. If anyone is interested in helping with this I can provide more details. This doesn't affect usage at all, but it kinda sucks because I designed the backend to be very modular so it would be simple to quickly build custom backends.
 To use it, add (or browse) Atom feeds as servers, with the address being the URL of the feed (without a "http://" or "https://" prefix due to a limitation with how Gnus parses group names in some cases unfortunately). For example:
 (add-to-list 'gnus-secondary-select-methods '( nnatom "somewebsite.tld/feed.xml" (nnatom-name "<optional custom name for the group>"))) 
 Each "server" will contain a single group with a name taken from the feed or 'nnatom-name'.
 Some design notes:
  
Atom feed entries (articles) can contain both a summary and "content" (or both, or neither). nnatom saves both, and allows viewing either by making the article multipart when needed.
 Every piece of data extracted from the feed is handled by a separate function, and all Gnus backend interface functions are generic, which allows very simple creation of derivative backends theoretically (you only need to implement a set of parsing functions for your feed).
 Every feed has it's own file for data storage, and those are the only files modified directly by nnatom.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I'm building out my capture templates and I'm mostly squared away (borrowing a bit from Norang actually).
 One of the capture templates I use is for "reminders" these are tasks that I want to show up as a reminder on the agenda but are not TODO entries. A common use for me on these is for meetings. I drop the meeting on my calendar but capture it with a "meeting" capture template that clocks the meeting and I just notate my meeting notes within. 
 To accomplish this I have a top level heading called Reminders and under that I store them:
 If its a one off I use the <2023-06-08 Thu 14:30> type of active timestamp so it shows on the agenda.
 If it is a recurring I use the following which I found online. the 3 means to show every 3rd day of the week. (1 2 3 4 5) would show mon-fri etc. 
 ** Weekly Marketing Meeting 11:00-12:00 :Reminder: <%%(memq(calendar-day-of-week date) '(3))> 
 My one off reminder capture template uses %^T to prompt for and insert an active date+time which works perfectly. 
 I try to include this snippet of text in my capture template where I can just manually update the days I want the reminder to trigger for recurring ones like so
 ("!" "recurring reminder" entry (file "~/Orgfiles/refile.org") "* %? :REMINDER:\n %U\n <%%(memq (calendar-day-of-week date) '(1 2 3 4 5))> 
 \n%a\n%i" :empty-lines 1)
 However when I run the capture I get this output
  <%%![Error: (void-variable date)]> 
 Ideally I'd love to use a prompt for "which days to repeat" where I could input 1 3 5 and get a m/w/f repeater output into the entry. 
 I'm still learning so this might be really simple elisp issue creating the erorr and void variable situation here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I thought I had got this to work. I was wrong. I am now very confused.
 I want the following characters to pair automatically in org mode: "/" "" "=" "+" "_" "~" "`" (the last to pair with "'", for LaTeX). I also want them to *not pair when point is next to a word. I thought I had everything I wanted with this:
 (defun my/text-electric-pair-inhibit (char) ;; Account for buffer-end weirdness (unless (eq (following-char) 0) (or ;; (electric-pair-inhibit-if-helps-balance char) ;; TODO This logic isn't quite right, check out how ;; `electric-pair-inhibit-if-helps-balance' does it. ;; (electric-pair-conservative-inhibit char) ;; Don't pair after before a word (memq (char-syntax (char-before)) '(?w ?.)) (memq (char-syntax (following-char)) '(?w ?.)) (memq (char-syntax (char-after (- (point) 2))) '(?w ?.))))) (setq electric-pair-inhibit-predicate #'my/text-electric-pair-inhibit) (modify-syntax-entry ?/ "\"" org-mode-syntax-table) (modify-syntax-entry ?* "\"" org-mode-syntax-table) (modify-syntax-entry ?= "\"" org-mode-syntax-table) (modify-syntax-entry ?+ "\"" org-mode-syntax-table) (modify-syntax-entry ?_ "\"" org-mode-syntax-table) (modify-syntax-entry ?~ "\"" org-mode-syntax-table) (modify-syntax-entry ?` "('" org-mode-syntax-table) (modify-syntax-entry ?' ")`" org-mode-syntax-table) 
 But it doesn't work. I get a few different bugs. Most of the time, the pairing works but the inhibition doesn't (characters still pair immediately before or after a word character). Sometimes different characters with the same syntax class behave differently (e.g. "=" and "/", one will be inhibited and the other not). 
 I'm really confused. Any help appreciated.
 TIA.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Someone help me out here. I'm following FP in Scala, the red book and I am currently at chapter 4, where we define our own `Option` type. This type, like other collections, takes a covariant type parameter `A`:
 enum Option[+A]: case Some(value: A) case Nothing 
 The book then asks to implement some methods for this type, including:
 def getOrElse[B >: A](default: => B): B = this match case Some(value) => value case Nothing => default 
 This is where the confusion starts. Notice the type parameter annotation `B >: A`. As far as I can tell, this means `B` is a supertype of `A`. I read this as a constraint. I can only pass values of types which are supertypes of `A` to this method. However, the following compiles without any issue:

 I'm experimenting with capture templates, in particular to get a diary going for appointments. Here is what I have:
  
'(org-capture-templates '(("d" "Diary" entry (file+olp+datetree "~/org-mode/diary.org") "* %T %?" :time-prompt t)))
  
Just a couple of small questions:
  
What does the '*' mean in the template? I see it in all of them but it's quite a hard thing to search for!
 I quite often get the message 'clipboard pasted as level 4 subtree' when I use this... but I don't want that (and I'm not entirely sure what it means, since it doesn't seem to paste my mac clipboard? maybe the emacs kill ring?)
 How can I do a newline so the timestamp appears below?
  
Simple questions I'm sure, but the notation is a bit overwhelming at first!

I can get all the info I want (10 day view, then unscheduled and expired/older TODOs) in a custom command, but it makes a long buffer and I need to scroll to get to the unscheduled stuff while leaving the right-hand side of the screen mostly empty.
 I'd like to have the standard ten days agenda list on the left, and a column shows me my unscheduled and expired TODOs on the right. I've tried opening the two in separate vertical split windows, but when I change agendas in one window, the other changes too.
 Is there a way to have different agenda views active at the same time? Or to have a single agenda view that flows through vertical columns somehow? Ideally I'd like to open the whole thing with a single command.
 Thanks!

 I tried everything and every kind of suggestion present in corfu, orderless or eglot github/wikis. I don't know how to debug it.
 This is a video showing the lag. Sometime the cursor disappears, it just so lagging that typing become frustrating. Video
 This is the output of the profiler profiler

 Any idea or help is very welcome. Thank you.
 EDIT: BTW I even tried eglot+company without orderless, still the same lag. Even though a little bit less, but still frustratingly present.

 This is superior to something like consult-history, as I don't need to invoke it separately.
 Is there something equivalent for eshell, or can I set up eshell completion to be similarly frictionless?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been coding in Haskell for over 6 years and I still feel as if the lack of dot completion (i.e. completion after typing identifier. in the code editor) is the single thing I miss most compared to mainstream languages. In Haskell I find myself constantly jumping to type definitions, searching for documentation, or even grepping the project to recall the name of a function, when in (say) Rust or Typescript I could type foo. and have the editor show me what I need 90% of the time.
 Edit: Here's a concrete example. I was working on some code with a variable vec :: Vector Int and needed to split it into two vectors based on some predicate. I recall that there is a function for doing exactly this, but can't remember the name. In Haskell this is a situation where I usually find myself Googling for the Data.Vector documentation on Hackage. In other languages I would just type vec. and scan through the completion options to find what I need. This sort of thing happens many times per day and I feel like it makes a big difference in productivity.

 I generally do my reading with epub files on my phone. This has been a pain point for me with emacs, since while it can display epub files with docview (in emacs 29+) it's just images. You can't click on links and it doesn't save your position or anything. Then there's nov for ebook reading specifically, but I wanted to explore this other option, since info-mode is a core part of emacs and is likely to be better integrated with it. Plus, nov isn't in active development.
 So, is there a converter from epub to info specifically for emacs? I tred a few online ones, but when trying to open it emacs complains with No such node or anchor: Top.
 Ideas?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been looking for a while, but I haven't been able to find "good" resources on utilizing laziness effectively in practical Haskell.
 ​
 There's Hutton's explanation in Programming in Haskell, Bird actually seems to go quickly into laziness (chapters 1,2 of Thinking Functionally With Haskell), but I haven't seen anything like, say, a Serokell article on how to manage laziness in practical terms.
 ​
 Maybe I'm just not trying hard enough? What I'm looking for is:
 --Laziness beyond the lazy infinite list (that's just an iterator / generator function with better syntax).
 --How to effectively exploit laziness to improve algorithmic efficiency.
 --How to avoid space leaks mostly reliably.
 --When space leaks occur, best practices in locating and debugging them.
 ​
 I do have Okasaki (Purely Functional Data Structures) and Bird (Algorithm Design with Haskell), but I haven't seriously gone through them. Are those books sufficient to master laziness / non-strictness to go from "laziness is a 60-40 double-edged sword" to "laziness works for me 90+% of the time"?
 ​
 
 ​
 It matters because, well, you have firms that deliberately choose a strict dialect of Haskell (SC, Mu), you have firms that go to -XStrict by default (NRI, Key.me), and, well, Purescript is strict, Idris is strict; Haskell is rare in making non-strict / lazy evaluation its default, and as functional programming becomes increasingly mainstream, Haskell's main long-term selling point will be its experiment with lazy-by-default.
 ​
 However, lazy-by-default is best known for the resulting space leaks, not for its expressiveness advantages. For I myself, I'd like to have a list of resources to understand how to get pervasive laziness not to screw me, but rather be a useful tool, and I think it'd be useful to be able to redirect skeptics and newbies to a laziness resource list.

The availability of deep learning frameworks like

machine learning tasks or other numerical algorithms. The Haskell library
ecosystem has been catching up as well, and there are now multiple good array
libraries. However, writing high-performance array processing code in Haskell

 Here's a screenshot depicting my trouble: https://imgur.com/a/yuNePvZ
 Note in particular the right hand buffer where the output from R is showing me the results of loading the tidyverse package (the bold, kinda royal blue text) and also the output of the dataframe's contents (the dark text that's almost unreadable).
 If I put point over the gray text and invoke M-x describe-char I get:
 There is an overlay here: From 1682 to 1697 evaporate t face (:foreground "gray30") insert-behind-hooks (ansi-color-freeze-overlay) modification-hooks (ansi-color-freeze-overlay) 
 I can click the (:foreground "gray30") bit which brings me to a Help buffer with the following contents:
 Face: :foreground undefined face. 
 That's basically where I hit a dead-end because it's not clear to me how to proceed beyond just blindly grepping through code in ESS and nord-theme. So I guess my questions are:
  
how do I figure out what "gray30" is and where it comes from
 why it's undefined
 how do I change that to be something more readable?
  
edit: In case anyone else stumbles across this from Google, I believe I am experiencing the issue described here

This is fine, but I sometimes can't keep going because my syntax highlighting stops updating. I understand that LSP servers will sometimes have bugs and fail - it is a hard problem, but I'd like to make emacs robust to this: how can I make it so other aspects of my emacs setup, especially syntax highlighting and basic emacs functionality, are robust to failures in LSP mode?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have installed Jedi - the python autocomplete package - on my emacs. The autocomplete feature is great, but causes me issues when I am navigating through the code. 
 A simple example is: when I comment a line in my code, and try to move to the line above or below, I can't do it. This is because the auto-complete pops up, and it scrolls through those options rather than go up or down in my code. As a result, every time I need to comment -> move left -> move up, instead of just moving up. Commenting is just one example. There are several other times (changing variables and so on) where this happens.
 I want the autocomplete to help me when I am trying to finish a variable or call a function, not unnecessarily bother me like this. Do you guys know of any solution to fix this? Maybe changing the keys for scrolling through autocomplete might help (although that might make it difficult to use it in normal circumstances, I am open to ideas). Any suggestions are welcome.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I use org-refile to navigate and file things all the time. While it is functional, I have long craved something a little more flexible.
 So I've written a package that allows you to programmatically set composable shortcuts for org-refile.
 https://github.com/thread314/org-navigator
 It allows the user to set prefix shortcut keys to various actions (refile to, go-to, clock in to etc), and combine these with suffix keys that define the target for the desired action.
 So for example, typing C-c fa might file the current subtree to the subtree set to "a", whereas C-c ia would instead jump to that subtree and open it in an indirect buffer.
 It also allows the user to define the destination suffix keys by setting a property on the target subtree itself from within the org-mode file.
 I'm not a programmer so always very open to any feedback or suggestions.

 I am a CS undergrad and currently taking a functional programming class. The teacher has left us about 8 weeks to make a final project, without any directions. If you were to make some project in haskell, that would take about 6 weeks, what would you do?

 The problem is I need to find a project where I can use it. 
 I’m an embedded engineer, I mostly do linux stuff and sometimes bare metal, I mainly use cpp. My dev set up is mainly comprised of neovim and terminal app. 
 Ideally I would love to create a tool that I would use often and keep expanding so that I keep practicing haskell. 
 Any idea? :)

 I use scrivener for larger project planning and overseeing, as I like the way to organize documents there; however I only want to hop into it once every couple of weeks.
 Daily, I use emacs, and I would love to be able to just work with one or 2 documents in org mode on the fly as needed.
 Anyone familiar with a way that this might be easily done?

 Sharing a short note about upcoming Iron library updates. The next release enables the convenient turning of opaque types into value objects with optional validation and neat subtyping.
 So, we'll be able to do things like: scala opaque type Temperature = Double :| Positive object Temperature extends RefinedTypeOps[Temperature] 
 and after both value and apply are in place for iron&opaque types: ``` val t1 = Temperature(100) val t2 = Temperature(100)
 val result = t1.value + t2.value ```
 The note itself: Iron updates: turning opaque types into value objects
 And there is a beginner-friendly ticket: Add alias for True constraint and IronType[A, True]
 Thank you!

 Alternatively, does anybody offer hourly tutoring/consulting for macros? I'm using them for a side project, so don't have any colleagues to bounce things off of.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey
 I'm starting with reproducible research in MySQL using org-babel.
 https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/languages/ob-doc-sql.html
 I am able to connect to the remote host (manual SSH tunnel), but the configuration of dbhost/dbuser and so on needs to be applied to each block. Is it possible to have some macro that would expand during execution? Let's say my init.el has predefined values for each of the databases I use. In the org doc, I would be able to reference (like #+use_headers: this_db). I know I can have macros that would type all those headers, but having this data present in each file makes it less readable and adds some chance of data leakage.

 I'm using this to define the fonts in init.el, but the width and weight are completely ignored:

 However, if I run the same command using M-x shell and then typing it out manually, it works as expected. It also works in vterm as well as my terminal outside of Emacs.
 I have tried to check relevant (environment) variables between shell-command and shell, but I can't notice any difference. For the avoidance of doubt I mainly checked the following: - echo $VIRTUAL_ENV - which jupyter - jupyter kernelspec list (both show that my kernel is available, even when using shell command
 Can anyone explain me where the difference could lie between the different results between shell-command and shell? Is there any way to execute a command as if it was executed using shell?

The way I write notes is a bit different compared to the classical note-taking style or the Zettelkasten Method.
Suppose I was learning about Moravec's Paradox. Here is my typical workflow.
I first go through the learning process. To learn about these things, we basically consume some form of a source like the Wikipedia page, articles, explanations, videos, etc. On a side note, I always do a syntopical reading (coined by Adler I guess?!), I never read about a topic only from one source. I at least use two, to get a better understanding of it. Anyways, so I read and read and watch and watch and as I am going along with it I am learning in my head by doing all those wonderful things that my brain can do, thinking, analyzing, critiquing, understanding, comparing, blah blah bl…]]></summary>

 -- >>> map (+2) [1,5,7] 
 the comment block gets replaced with:
 -- >>> map (+2) [1,5,7] -- [3,7,9] 
 Is this possible to replicate in Emacs?
 Or to phrase my question differently, in Lisp mode, Emacs has the key binding C-j (which executes eval-print-last-sexp) to evaluate Lisp code and insert its output in the buffer. Is there an equivalent mechanism for evaluating code in other major modes? Can this be achieved with lsp-mode or eglot maybe?

 I have noticed that in Emacs word "manger" has been replaced with "archive" is this because their is a difference between a package manger and a package archive? Is it called an archive in Emacs instead of a manger for a reason?
 I'm almost certain that they are they are the same thing just different names but wanted to make sure. 
 Any feedback will be greatly appreciated.

I mean, a user can define a gesture, putting middle finger out, as M-x, followed by a sequence of ninjutsu, like the Naruto things. Then a command will prompt out as you wish. And you can still fully use all the .emacs things in that case. 
 Are you looking forward this device? How are you going to adapt it into your daily use? What things cannot be done rightnow but super easy for using it on visionOS? Love to hear your voice.

  "--with-native-compilation -with-json --with-modules --with-harfbuzz --with-compress-install --with-threads --with-included-regex --with-x-toolkit=gtk3 --with-zlib --with-jpeg --with-png --with-imagemagick --with-tiff --with-xpm --with-gnutls --with-xft --with-xml2 --with-mailutils --with-tree-sitter --with-xwidgets CC=gcc-10" 
 When I open a page (e.g. https://www.gnu.org/) with xwidget-webkit-browse-url all I ever see is a white screen.
 Has anyone been succesful getting xwidget working on a WSL setup? If so, I'd like to hear how you got it working!

 ​
 I currently am reading a paper (to be found here https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.02856.pdf ) that includes some haskell code. The authors made some statements about various topics, some more some less related to functional programming that left me a little confused. I would be really grateful if someone could help me to better my understanding here. I will be marking the section concerned with quotes:

Page 1: "A standard CSE transformation can rewrite this to [...] which can be computed more efficiently".Q: Why can it be computed more efficiently? Because of the evaluation order of the let binding? My intuition tells me because we're only evaluation the subexpression once and binding it to a name, rather than evaluating the same expression twice. Does CSE alwa…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to use my init.el byte compiled. It works, but if it is further native compiled (automatically), it doesn't. The problem is with packages which are loaded in a deferred way. Native compile doesn't have a chance to know whether a particular call is a macro or a function. For example, if my init.el is this:
 (with-eval-after-load "evil" (evil-define-key 'normal Info-mode-map (kbd "m") 'Info-menu)) 
 It works if init.el is just byte-compiled. But native compilation gives a warning:
 init.el:3:4: Warning: the function ‘evil-define-key’ is not known to be defined. 
 (Note with init.el is so small, it seems that native compilation doesn't happen automatically, so you may have to run (native-compile "~/.emacs.d/init.el") manually to reproduce this)
 And later I indeed have a problem when I restart emacs (it tries to call evil-define-key as a function, but it's not found because it's a macro)
 What could be the solution for this problem? Note, that I have almost everything loaded in a deferred way. One possible solution I see is that I load all the deferred packages somehow (is there an emacs/use-package function for this?), then call native-compile manually (instead of relying of the automatic native compilation) to make sure that native-compile sees all the macros.

 For example when I am beneath a header with a bunch of bullets and I hit M-RET , this by default should execute: 
 org-insert-item 
 What I get instead is that Emacs creates a new same-level heading beneath last bullet ( even cuts remaining text from above bullet text
 ** Heading 2
 - Item
 ** 1
 Support to create new bullet underneath Item 1 but I get only 1 with same heading level as above.
 Any ideas ? It worked and now all of the sudden it stopped.
 I have following packages installed for org mode: "org", "org-bullets"
 ​
 Thank you

In the spirit of this quote, I was thinking to myself, "What is the problem situation that the ZKM was created for?"
In the Introduction to the ZKM article @Sascha said that it, "is a holistic method on how to deal with knowledge in your life." So, it would seem that it is, in part, helping with managing your knowledge outside of our memory system. I think elsewhere it is referred to as "a personal tool for thinking and writing." Which, I think helps to see more of the picture of the problem situation. Knowledge. Thinking. Writing.
I'd love to hear some thoughts from others in this forum on how they'd answer this question.

 A few days went by with no hiccups. Then seemingly out of nowhere, whenever I opened my Org files, all of my lines ended in dos carriage returns, ^M. Moreover, it opened a popup buffer that said there was an encoding conflict with the inputting encoding system and the underlying default. I didn't document it and have been unable to reproduce it. 
 To get rid of it, I have to M-x revert-buffer-with-coding-system RET utf-8-dos every time I open an org-file. 
 Does anyone know of a more permanent solution? Thanks in advance.

 This is what I came up with, but work only partially, and wrong sometimes.I could implement it?Thanks 
 EDIT: 
 (defun select-latex-frac () "Visually selects the LaTeX fraction expression under point." (interactive) (save-excursion (re-search-backward "\\\\frac{[^{}]*}{[^{}]*}") (setq start (match-beginning 0)) (setq end (match-end 0)) (evil-visual-make-selection start end)))

 How do org-mode/org-roam peeps integrate Slack with their systems and remain GTD productive? 
 The Longer Tale
 Perhaps more a general r/emacs question than org-mode but I'm very curious how people use org-mode and Slack together, particularly in terms of capturing TODOS and generally being productive and relating things back to source material. 
 In general, I find Slack turns my highly efficient, inbox-zero, mail-based, David-Allen-esque GTD system to swiss cheese by creating about 200 "inboxes", so I"m kinda wondering what other org-mode-ians do, and what the mu4e equivalent might be to Slack vs mail (to be clear, I use gmail's web interface even for mail, but lean into org-mode to manage notes and TODOs). 
 Would love to hear what's working for people vs not. (rather than us all griping about Slack... =] I'm not a fan of the tool, but feel most of its problems are around the way people use it, rather than the tool itself — despite the discourse and twist folks trying to convince me to give those a go at my company. =] ).

 I had written a package that allow using org-ql with org-roam:
 https://github.com/ahmed-shariff/org-roam-ql
 The idea was to make org-ql aware of the org-roam database. The package also allows viewing the content of an org-roam buffer in an org-ql-view buffer, which would allow querying based on the nodes, or vice versa, viewing the content of a org-ql-view in a org-roam-like buffer.
 Switching from an org-roam buffer to a org-ql buffer, narrowing the results using org-ql then rending the results in an org-roam-like buffer (which I am org-roam-ql buffers)
 Querty the org-roam database
 It's my first package and I am still working on it. I would love to hear any feedback on it :)

 base32-0.3 is out now, with extended support for GHCs 8.10 thru 9.6, as well as a text and bytestring min version bump. 
 This will be the last in the 0.x series for this library. base32, along withbase16 and base64, are nearing the release of a new epoch 1.x version cycle. In addition to various reworkings of the core apis for all of the base encoding libraries will come a focus on newtyped inputs and outputs, allowing for encode/decode, as well as support for SIMD-enabled loops for architectures that support it. 
 Cheers, Emily

 I'm playing around with my emacs config.Using use-package lazy loading options I settled down to ~0.4 s startup time with ~120 packages.Is possible to get even lower?
 At the moment evil and projectile are taking up 0.050 s, can I maybe shave down from projectile?
 I'm doing this just for fun, 0.4 s is already ultra fast enough, with emacsclient I get as low as 0.35 s ish
 This is my emacs config: https://github.com/Stefanomarton/DotFiles/tree/master/.config/emacs, maybe could be useful to someone.
 Thanks to anyone suggesting something 
 EDIT: maybe there is a specific order in which load stuff?

Looking at the GitHub issues, I think the package isn't getting the TLC it needs.
 I'm not eager to try fixing Outshine myself, so what would you suggest as alternative approaches for code folding or navigating large files? I have low vision, so I use big fonts, so I don't have many lines of code on screen at once, generally about 20.

 VSCode hilighting
 Any idea on how to fix this and get complete VSCode like hilighting? If you notice here `isLoading` and `setIsLoading` are also different because one is a variable and other is a function. I guess VScode knows this because of semantic hilighting from lsp? 
 I guess eglot doesn't support it yet: https://github.com/joaotavora/eglot/pull/839
 But I thought atleast typescript would be smart enough to highlight `setError` correctly to pink in the emacs case.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I use default key bindings and meow, on Japanese keyboard with the help of key re-mapper called keyd for linux, and sharpkeys for windows. Here are the reasons.
 - Emacs default key bindings are the ones that are also used in other programs, like terminal. Getting used to text-operation stuff (like C-a/M-f) to some extent makes consistency.
 - I use Japanese keyboard on desktop and laptop so that I can remap <muhenkan>, <henkan>, and <katakanahiragana> key (they are on my thumbs position) to control, shift, and escape key. I want my keyboard layout to be the same on desktop and laptop, so thumb clusters keyboards are not my choice.
 - I use meow for modal editing. I've used evil, but I didn't like to configure evil key bindings for every different mode. I also didn't like to disable evil completely for some modes. I just wanted to use j/k and J/K (I map J/K to scroll up/down faster) in certain modes like magit, that do not require much text editing. The thing I like the most about meow is its motion mode. In motion mode, I can use j/k and J/K to scroll, and if I wanted to dispatch keys that are bound in major-mode maps, I can simply prefix them with SPC key (the default is Hyper key, I changed it). In magit for example, I can dispatch k (magit-discard) by pressing SPC-k. Any keys that are not in motion mode map follow the major mode map. I do not use meow keypad because I'm comfortable with pressing control key. But for those who are not, meow keypad might be good.
 ​
 What do you think? I see a key bindings discussion occasionally here so hope this helps.
 I would very appreciate your suggestion.

For example, if I could hover over a file in Dired and have something like a org-capture template menu of categories/operations pop up according to the files extension. I was thinking of how useful this would be for being able to define commands for file compression or (extension-specific) conversion in a config.
 Alternatively if anyone knows of a method to could accomplish something similar to this would be appreciated, I'd just be interested in having a good way to run common commands on files from Emacs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone!
 I'm relatively new to Emacs and I'm trying to figure out which text-inputting framework I should use. I've never used Vim before, and I don't think I ever will. I have a keyboard with thumb clusters, which eliminates the issue of the "Emacs pinky" entirely. In fact, I find myself preferring chorded commands because they make me feel like a Jedi, with my keyboard as a lightsaber of sorts. It all started with cut/copy/paste when I was a child, and Emacs' style of running commands feels more like magical sorcery to me.
 Moreover, I use a different keyboard layout than the standard "QWERTY," so the default movement keys in Vim ("HJKL") are less convenient for me.
 I've noticed that switching between insert and normal mode in Evil Mode throws me off a bit, but maybe I just need to get used to it. I often hear people say that Evil Mode is a superior way to edit text compared to the default Emacs keybindings. However, I wonder if this preference is mostly driven by those who started with Vim and are already used to modal editing.
 I'm curious to hear your thoughts. In your opinion, what makes modal editing either superior/inferior? I'm particularly interested in hearing from those who have switched from Emacs to Vim (lol), especially if they inadvertently got used to Emacs keybindings first.
 Looking forward to your insights!

But I don't see any changes, the behavior is the same before and after loading the advices.
 My config is: elisp (use-package pcmpl-args :after eshell :demand nil :config (advice-add 'pcomplete-completions-at-point :around #'cape-wrap-silent) (advice-add 'pcomplete-completions-at-point :around #'cape-wrap-purify)) 
 Which expands to: elisp (eval-after-load 'eshell '(progn (require 'pcmpl-args nil nil) (advice-add 'pcomplete-completions-at-point :around #'cape-wrap-silent) (advice-add 'pcomplete-completions-at-point :around #'cape-wrap-purify) t))) 
 cape is loaded with emacs initalization so I think it's irelevant, but here is anyway: elisp (use-package cape :defer 1 :config (add-to-list 'completion-at-point-functions 'cape-file)) 
 (I tried to open this issue on both cape and corfu repos but github blocked me and I don't know why)

But i quickly faced an issue which is that LLVM-hs fails to compile which is due to the fact that the project requires llvm-4.0 which is really outdated and i can't really build it or install it trough my package manager i know that LLVM-hs supports LLVM-9.0 but that is also too old. So is there some workaround to this or should i just pick a different language for my compiler (Which would be sad since i really like haskell).

 I did not assess the quality of their material (although I heard good things about their Rust track) but, in all cases, I'm thinking it could be a good way for people not familiar with Emacs Lisp to start tweaking their editor. :-)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The new 3.3.0 release of Scala introduced an interesting new syntactic feature (first proposed in SIP-44 - FEWER BRACES).
 I had some fun implementing a Scala version of Python's with statement :
 Python version:
 with open(filename) as f: content = f.readlines() for line in content: print(line) 
 Scala version:
 with_ (open(filename)): f => val content = f.readLines() content.foreach: println(_) 
 Behind the scenes:
 def with_[A](expression: A)(suite: A => Unit): Unit = val manager = expression val enter = try manager.getClass().getDeclaredMethod("__enter__") catch _ => null val exit = try manager.getClass().getDeclaredMethod("__exit__") catch _ => null val value = if enter != null then enter.invoke(manager).asInstanceOf[A] else manager try suite(value) catch case e: Exception => println(e) finally if exit != null then exit.invoke(manager) 
 My implementation is obviously highly inspired by Python's. For example, by defining a simple file I/O wrapper with __enter__ and __exit__ methods we can nicely and properly handle file reading and writting.
 Let me know what you think and if you have other ideas!

 For context I work as a web developer with node (with express), react and vue. 
 Most job postings I see usually mention http4s and specifically mention having experience with libraries other than Play is a plus. Would learning http4s would be a good idea, from what I understand it’s more fp and the only fp knowledge I have is from an university course in Clisp.
 I would appreciate any recommendations.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone,
 I'm using dirvish for browsing folders and appreciate the plain text preview feature. 
 It is working surprisingly well even for office documents with the help of some external libraries (pandoc, pdftotext, etc...) : https://i.imgur.com/ZET3dWt.png 
 and ability to register your own dirvish-preview-dispatchers. 
 Example with docx file : 
  ;; register a plain text dirvish dispatcher for docx files (dirvish-define-preview docx (file ext) "Preview docx files in plain text Require: `pandoc' (executable)" :require ("pandoc" ) (cond ((equal ext "docx") `(shell . ("pandoc" "-t" "plain",file))))) (add-to-list 'dirvish-preview-dispatchers 'docx) 
 I'm however struggling with pptx extension as I need to chain execution of 2 commands : 
  
pptx2md for converting PPTX to markup files 
 pandoc for markup files to plain text. 
  
I've tried to use " && " like this : 
 ;; register a plain text dirvish dispatcher for PPTX files (dirvish-define-preview pptx (file ext) "Preview PPTX files in plain text Require: `pptx2md' & `pandoc' (executables)" :require ("pptx2md") :require ("pandoc") (cond ((equal ext "pptx") `(shell . ("pptx2md", "--disable-image",file,"&& pandoc","-f","markdown","->t","plain","out.md")))) ) (add-to-list 'dirvish-preview-dispatchers 'pptx) 
 but end up with this output in my buffer : 
 usage: pptx2md [-h] [-t TITLE] [-o OUTPUT] [-i IMAGE_DIR] [--image-width IMAGE_WIDTH] [--disable-image] [--disable-wmf] [--disable-color] [--disable-escaping] [--wiki] [--mdk] [--min-block-size MIN_BLOCK_SIZE] pptx_path pptx2md: error: unrecognized arguments: && pandoc -f markdown out.md 
 I understand why I have this issue, and think it will be possible to fix it by creating my own shell script mixing both commands, but would like to know what is proper way to handle this in elisp. 
 Any ideas ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm currently working on an emacs configuration for myself. I'm coming from NeoVim and VSCode and both of those have a pretty easy way to fuzzy search for files in the current directory. VSCode has this built in and NeoVim can do this through telescope.
 It feels like there isn't a "simple" solution to this in emacs. find-file more or less requires me to type the path. Yes you get tab completion, but that's still pretty slow in comparison. And beyond that i seem to get into selectrum, orderless, marginalia and what not, which for one doesn't seem to solve this problem either, and feels needlessly complex for what i'm trying to do.
 So, my workflow has always been that i open my editor in my main projects directory. When i want to open a file, i press a hotkey and start searching with file and folder names. In 99.99% of cases i know exactly how the file is named and where it's located. I just don't want to have to type out the path. I'd rather type the parts of the path that are unique and get there quickly.
 What's the simplest solution for this? All i really need is a wrapper around fzf. fzf.el would do what i need, but doesn't work on windows. There is a fork of fzf.el that "should" fix that but i can't get it to work. I'm also not too sure how to point use-package to a random git repository rather than what's on melpa.

No
 Yes
  
For many decades editors have been unable to do simple things. Like correctly color variables. That is until now. Emacs 29 treesit is here. It is going to enable so many new features.
  
paredit/lispy edits for all languages? check!
 highlight thing at point, in a scope sensitive way? check!
 sticky scroll? check!
 Syntax highlighting that actually works right? check!
  
4 decades of being unable to add color to variables has passed. Programmers have been born, lived, and retired all under that era. This is all about to change. These insurmountable problems are about to become EASY to solve. YOU can implement the features that were impossibly hard for the previous generation. YOU can implement an object-at-point highlighter that is more performant and correct than ever. All you need to know is how to walk a tree.
 Trees are really what enable lisp's special powers. Lisp's tree nature is what made it possible to easily make advanced modes like paredit. Now everyone is about to have their tree exposed to package developers, not just lisp. The other languages always had a tree, it was just hidden. Adding treesitter to Emacs is more than just another feature. It is lisp-esque. It will pave the way to true editing features.

I am a Bookends user, and I have a nice collection of PDFs associated with references. I was able to dump the references into a *.bibtex file and import it into bibdesk, but I don't know how I can attach those PDFs to references in BibDesk. Does someone here know?
Also, bookends supports what they call, I think, "floating citations", where pressing alt-alt in The Archive brings up a small window where I can search a reference and it pastes, for example, [@Smith1976] into the Archive. This too I'd love to replicate, but if not available, I can script it easily enough using an unholy mix of Python and Keyboard Maestro and Alfred.
Why I want to switch: Bookends isn't very git-friendly; they produce a binary file containing the references instead of a text file like bibtex.
Many thanks!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm a complete Emacs newbie and recently decided to take the plunge on my macOS system. As a beginner, I find the learning curve a bit steep, especially when it comes to customizing my setup.
 I've been trying to set up Doom Emacs with a configuration from this GitHub repository: https://github.com/slano-ls/Doom-Emacs-Config and ran into some issues.
 Firstly, the installation process was a bit challenging. I followed the steps to clone both Doom Emacs and the configuration repository, but I've been encountering errors saying that Emacs cannot find my config.el file. I did ensure that the file exists in the appropriate directory, though.
 Secondly, I've had trouble with having Emacs recognized in my $PATH. I installed Emacs using Homebrew and attempted to add it to my $PATH, but the Doom installation script keeps telling me that it can't run Emacs.
 To summarize, I've got two main issues:
  
Emacs/Doom Emacs can't seem to find my config.el file.
 Having trouble getting Emacs to be recognized in my $PATH.
  
I'd greatly appreciate it if anyone could provide some guidance, tips, or resources to help me sort these issues out and get more comfortable with Emacs on macOS. I've been searching and trying out solutions, but as a beginner, it's been quite overwhelming.
 Thanks in advance!
 P.S. If there's any additional information you need, please let me know. I'm keen to learn and make this work!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have started a mooc which uses Emacs. I have only previously used Dr.Racket and Anaconda so I'm having trouble with how I actually run programs in Emacs.
 I did the tutorial which covers how to edit and navigate text, open and save files.
 I just don't understand how you actually write some code and run it?
 In Dr.Racket or Anaconda, I could write some function in say python, that asks user for two numbers, and returns their sum. I'd write the code, click run, it would prompt me for the two numbers, I'd enter them and it would return their sum.
 Can anyone explain how I would do this in Emacs? I understand it's more powerful text editor I just really can't see how to do something simple like the above. I would like to learn how to use Emacs, and the course videos are all done using Emacs so ideally I'd like to be able to follow along with the videos.
 So yea if someone could explain how I could do what I know how to do in Anaconda, just write a simple function, run it and interact with it, then get a return. I think it might really help me understand the difference between Emacs and Anaconda etc. All the tutorials just talk about editing text. Not writing code, running it and giving it input and seeing the output? I'm sure I'm missing something very obvious but just struggling to see how you go from the text editing to actually running code I have written?

 It's better than nothing, but one doesn't go the emacs route for "better than nothing". It's not showing symbols. E.g. vscode shows symbols:

 I am new to emacs and Org Mode. But I'm looking to step up my personal notes game and move away from proprietary systems.
 My hope is to use Spacemacs on my various computer and beorg on my phone and iPad to give me a good note and 'second brain' system.
 This is probably a real simple question, but I have only been at this since yesterday...
 Is there a way to scape a web page into Org format and include it in my notes? Or possiblt just scrape paert of a web page and convert it into org mode.

 Given a csv file with columns A, B, C; and rows 1, 2, 3... how do I turn that into a tree, walking it column first?
 So ~~~ | | A | B | C | | 1 | | | | | 2 | | | | | 3 | | | | ~~~
 becomes: ~~~ A *1 *2 *3 B *1 *2 *3 C *1 *2 *3 ~~~
 I saw "GitHub - emacsmirror/org-transform-tree-table: Transform org-mode tree with properties to a table, and the other way around" (https://github.com/emacsmirror/org-transform-tree-table) but it works on properties, not the cell value...
 I'm sure there is something there (and of course 1st I searched on emacs itself), but can't find it... I must be using wrong keywords.
 Thanks a ton. :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Because tree sitter is making a nice opportunity for us to evolve Emacs bindings, I have been pulling together some POC work into a package called user-keys.
 So far it's useful for Elisp programmers. I'm undecided about whether or how to take it to the next level for users. The state of progress:
  
reports and extensible tools for keymap analysis 
 shadows (every single map that binds C-n for example)
 "stupid keys" that you want to delete everywhere
 preferred bindings state
 
 macro proof of concept for abstract key bindings, an idea I've pushed on emacs devel to make ad-hoc conventions like C-n configurable to the user
 lots of groundwork for mass rebinding or unbinding
  
some of the kinds or report generation I created earlier.
 I was going to spike the code and use it as a demonstration for writing a transient UI, but I'm a little unclear on where to deliver the most value. I'm not super committed to this package, but felt it had too much utility already to keep it to myself.
 I'm interested in feature requests, hopes and dreams, (and support for the package or other packages I'm working on).
 I've been getting a lot of value out of the elisp repo kit (erk) and was able to use a normal TDD style like a civilized person, really making things go faster. I also got some more experience with the dash library and of course immense exposure to the weirdness of Emacs keymap data.

 So I want to just completely uninstall emacs and start over again.
 How ever when I run "brew remove emacs"
 i get the error "Error: cask "emacs" is not installed"
 I have been using it and went through the tutorial so I really don't understand why I can't uninstall? I'm completely new to using command line and emacs so I dont even know where to begin. I tried to just remove it from applications folder but there is still several associated files when I search emacs.
 Ideally I'd like to understand what this error means and how to completely uninstall emacs and all the associated files. Can anyone please explain why I'm getting this error after I had been succesfully running emacs? surely everything must have been there to be able to open and complete the tutorial?

 This function exists in logseq under the name Macros.
 For instance, when I enter Trac-2345, logseq knows that it must be replaced by a link to the ticket number 2345 in my Trac ticket system.
 How is it called in emacs and how shall I implement it?

 I'm using Wanderlust for years, and just now I discovered this issue/problem:
  
I am using Wanderlust (v. 2.15.9) on my main machine and it works just perfect.
 
I am using rsync to "clone" literally whole home folder on my laptop, when I am going on the roads. So I have the same behaviour, messages, notes… in (on) my laptop.
 
Wanderlust (and Emacs of course) works fine, except:
 
I can not delete message(s) from remote (POP) folder, after marking with d and pressing x I get a error message "1 execution(s) were failed" (or more than 1, depends on Nr. of marked messages).
 
 What can be a reason of this?
 Note: I can delete messages from local folders (stored on HDD).
 All the settings like .wl, .folders… are the same.
 Does anybody has any idea how to solve this (actually I can still delete messages from webmail or telnet, this is not a problem, but it's little-bit annoying)?
 Thanks in advance

 I use org-change-tag-in-region a lot in my daily routine. I love it because I can set or unset tags in a huge block of stuff. However, what bugs me is this: When I mark a region to tag/untag all the selected items, it will unmark the items after I set or remove a tag. Is there a way to keep the selection on the text so I don't have to mark it all over again to set/unset more tags?

the Glasgow Haskell
Compiler (GHC).
The back end includes a new translation for control flow, which enables GHC to avoid depending on external tools like Binaryen.
Because the translation is new, we wanted to test it before submitting a merge request.
And classic unit testing was not a good fit—we would have needed to know what
the WebAssembly code was
expected to be generated from any given fragment of Haskell,
and that’s a job for a compiler, not an engineer.
Fortunately, we don’t care
how generated code is written; we care about how it behaves.
Code’s behavior can be tested by running it, but we wanted to test the translation before integrating it with GHC. So we
simulated translated code by tracing possible
executions…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I used to be a VSCode user. I'm a programmer and make my living doing web development these days. Last year I decided I wanted to give Emacs a try. I went for Doom Emacs with the intent of someday making my own config. I used it for a good 6 months at least and fell in love with Emacs. I also decided I wanted to give neovim a fair try. 
 I made a neovim config from scratch. It took me 2 days but I got a really good config which does almost everything I want and I use that as my daily editor for my work without any problems. 
 After I made my neovim config I decided I wanted to make my own Emacs config from scratch and started on tha endeavor. I am so heartbroken to say that after having sunk more than a month into it, having read the 300 pages of the book "Mastering Emacs" by Mickey Peterson, I'm nowhere close to done. Nothing seems to work like it should. Adding a new packages breaks the functionality of the old ones for whatever reason. 
 I upgraded from emacs 28 to 29 and lsp that worked about fine on my config now doesn't work. Company mode seems broken as well. I really want to love Emacs and I've been at it for months now. It's starting to seem like a fool's errand at this point. 
 after spending almost a year between neovim and emacs, it's starting to feel like VSCode wasn't all that bad. It did almost everything I wanted from it and I didn't have to feel like I was fighting against the very tool that's supposed to make me productive.

 Does anyone think that we should have an official Emacs emoji? You can apply for one for free: https://emojipedia.org/proposals/#:~:text=Anyone%20can%20submit%20a%20proposal,and%20cannot%20already%20be%20represented.
 Now, I know what you're thinking:
  
Emacs people don't use Emojis
  
A: Well, some of us *do* use them. A lot. Even inside of Emacs.
  
They're not going to give it for a piece of software
  
A: Well, Emacs isn't just a piece of software. It's seen as a philosophy by most people who even know what it is. So maybe we can apply for it under that banner?
 I know the chances of it being approved would be slim but it *is* kind of unique and it *is* a philosophy to many people. So maybe?
 Again: I'm not expecting a huge response but I figured maybe some here might agree and try anyway?
 Thanks for reading. 🙃

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello! 
I adopted a Plain Text workflow a few years ago. I am on Linux/Windows environments. I'm not tied to any editor (hence my use of markdown). I use various VIM flavors, VS Code, notepad, and have tried emacs, Zettlr and Obsidian. I'm fairly comfortable using any of those but am mainly using Zettlr right now. I use pandoc to generate most everything I need either to HTML, docx or PDF via LaTeX. My reference manager of choice is Zotero. I use hypothes.is "somewhat," but not much. I haven't figured out a good way to just pipe those notes into Zotero where I'd prefer them. My "inbox" is Zotero.
Why am I looking at Zettelkasten after all these years? Because I'm adventuring out into new phases in my life where I think notetaking and writing are going to become far more important. Mainly in the area of Genealogy. Genealogy has overlap with many topics/cross-overs in history, anthropology, social sciences, archive/library science, DNA, general research, writing. I need a better way to process and use information. While I have degrees in history, anthropology, and engineering, I've work in more practical fields, mainly Tech, for years and am well out of practice in research and writing.
Since I haven't seriously written or researched in years, I need to shake the rust off. As part of that effort, I want better techniques to process and store what I've read. I think the "commonplace" tradition (and I fit Zettelkasten in that category for this discussion) is the only methodology that seriously considers the process of taking notes and tying them together. There is, I believe, a fairly complete workflow from figuring out what to read, how to read it, how to take notes about it, how to process those notes (including storage), how to tie notes together, and how to use them for output.
Also, it seems to be the most amenable method to fit into my plain text workflow.
I do have more specific questions, mainly around my notes in Zotero and what to do with them, but I will post them separately.]]></summary>

I've been using LanguageTool since 2019 because it's open source and has some level of Emacs integration, but I'm not happy with it anymore as it lets some critical grammar mistakes slide. For instance, LanguageTool couldn't detect the two grammar issues here, while Grammarly was able to:
 "I’m in a plane. I thought classes today." 
 I'm used to writing markdowns on Emacs, but I don't think my setup is adequate anymore.

Mine just deleted the character in front of the cursor. I had this happening in fundamental and text mode, why?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ever since I started using emacs I've progressively moved a lot of my work into emacs, as I suppose is the case for many of you. As such, I devised various workflows, which include creating reproducible org documents, custom LaTeX exports, capturing things to my agenda and to my org-roam Zettelkasten, etc. After a while, I've felt the need to start writing small guides to myself to remind me how I achieved several things which I do frequently but not often enough that I would remember. Do you find yourselves also doing this? Writing little short descriptions on how to do things? If you do, I'm curious to know what kind of strategy you use for this.
 Thanks in advance for all your help.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to set up certain interactions between my window manager (Hyprland) and Emacs, and for various reasons just matching window titles is no longer sufficient. Specifically, I need the minibuffer frame to have a wm_class other than emacs.
 Setting the title is just  (add-to-list 'minibuffer-frame-alist '(title . "uniquename")) 
 However this doesn't change the class, nor does there appear to be a class frame parameter. Parameters I have tried that don't work: class, name, role, instance, x-class, wm-class. 
 I've looked thru the manual and did not find anything related to the Class of frames, only titles and internal parameters.
 It appears from https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/60168/how-can-i-set-wm-class-for-emacs-27 and the bug report linked therein that name used to do this but no longer does because of GTK or something.
 I'd prefer not to rely on Emacsclient as that interferes with other things.
 What are we supposed to do in this case?

 And I'm not sure how to diagnose. I had followed the (older) base instructions from Mastering Emacs (http://www.modernemacs.com/post/prettify-mode/), with `(pretty-activate-groups '(sub-and-superscripts :greek :arithmetic-nary))` and a set of `prettify-symbols-alist` pairs for Python. 
 ...the prettify-symbols-alist pairs work (but look different...sometimes)
 ...the ligatures work...
 ...but greek symbols are nowhere to be found (seemingly in python-mode and python-ts-mode). It's a minor thing, but since there's a lot of mathematical programming involved, I rather miss it. I don't see any error messages in *Messages* but I'm not sure what I would be looking for.
 Any suggestions? I feel appropriately foolish...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi! I would like to prevent completions from being suggested to the empty string in inferior-python-mode. 
 To explain a bit better - when the prompt or the string is empty, there are no completions proposed. When I type something, say "a", I get a number of completions (such as abs, all, any, etc.). 
 If I backspace and get back to the empty string, instead of just getting back to a normal cursor, I get empty string completions such as "%%!", "%%HTML" and more irrelevant options of the sort. My completion-at-point-functions are (python-shell-completion-at-point comint-completion-at-point t) I'm using spacemacs with the basic python layer and not too many changes (using ipython as my REPL, with python-shell-completion-native-enable set to true). I hope this might be enough information already to suggest a solution.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've done lots of research on this one, lots of references to mobile org which is no longer in the play store, I see orgzly but don't see an integrated sync solution. There is org-mobile-pull/push. And then there is the dropbox crew...
 TL;DR: I'm thinking of setting up a dropbox to copy my daily plan.org file to, so I can keep in check on the go. I'd need a mobile capture file as well and then I'd manually parse that into my org system at home when convenient. Intuition says doomed to fail, but I'd love to hear if anyone has settled on this kind of system, or something better that works robustly.
 (It would be nice to have more access to the rest of the org setup since the items in my plan file tend to be org links to places with notes, followups, tacking info, etc... which would be occasionally nice to have on the go but isn't part of the min feature set.)
 ​
 Thanks for any and all help or info. I know this gets asked a lot, but it seems in that deadzone of many half baked solutions that different people sometimes kinda use with apps and libraries that were tried and then have fallen out of favor.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I understand that GNU ELPA is the official GNU Emacs package repository and is the only repository enabled by default. I also understand that submitting a package to GNU ELPA is a bit of a hassle and requires an FSF copyright assignment meaning that the official repository has a limited selection of packages.
 Correct me if I'm wrong but a copyright assignment is basically transferring ownership and rights of a specific creative work or works to a third party. So in this case, the third party would be the FSF, right?
 Where as with NonGNU ELPA the FSF doesn't ask for copyright assignments for packages meaning they won't be able to go into core Emacs? NonGNU ELPA isn't enabled by default..? 
 If anyone has a simple, less confusing way of explaining this, please leave a comment. Any feedback is greatly appreciated and I thank you in advance.

 Hi, I am trying to display the ellipsis that shows that the line is larger than the screen, but can't find any good solution. What is the name of the variable?
 So far I get this □ character at the right side of the screen for each line, showing that the line is larger than the screen. How to display a proper and nicer symbol?
 Or does it mean that there is a symbol defined, but not supported by the face? (name of the variable?)
 I looked for "ellipsis"... I thought the variable truncate-string-ellipsis was the right one... In my config "..." is defined (and it does work as org-level ellipsis...)
 I am sorry, I am not english and maybe not looking therefore for the right info using the wrong vocabulary...
 Looking for info with  describe-char  did not help...
 Thanks for your support.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have been having a couple of issues w/ the indentation of SRC blocks under lists (picture attached).
 1) I have an underline enabled for my begin line and an overline enabled for my end line. Under a list, these lines extend all the way across the buffer, while instead, I'd only like them to extend from the current indentation level to the right side of the buffer.
  
The org-modern-indent package does restrict the length of this line, but it adds some extra fontification to my begin/end lines that I do not want (fringe markers, and a small overbar at the beginning of the begin/end line), and I do not know how to remove these.
  
2) The content of the src is always flush left regardless of indentation level. I think this is probably related to me setting org-src-preserve-indentation to t which I did for other issues w/ indentation.
 ​
 Does anyone have any idea how to fix these issues?

Tf-Ncl enables configurations to be checked against Terraform provider-specific

can natively generate outputs as JSON, YAML or TOML; since Terraform can accept
its deployment configuration as JSON, you can straightforwardly export a Nickel
configuration, adhering to the right format, to Terraform. Tf-Ncl provides
a framework for ensuring a Nickel configuration has this specific format.
Specifically, Tf-Ncl is a tool to generate Nickel contracts that describe the

 For some reason, ispell has a keybinding of s-: on the Mac and no binding set on the Linux machine.
 I can confirm that the super key is available for binding on my Linux machine within Emacs.
 Can someone help explain why there is this disparity?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 This isn't an Emacs issue, but an intermittent problem I'm having with my home wifi. But Emacs has provided the latest clue.
 I was trying to update my packages via M-x package-display-packages. This brings up the list of packages as expected, but when I try to 'update all' via 'U', I get the message "waiting for refresh to finish". Only it didn't, after many minutes, when it usually takes a few seconds.
 This lead to many rabbit holes, until I discovered that the problem happens on my home wifi network, but if I switch to my cellular network (via a phone hotspot), the problem disappears - I can refresh my package list almost instantly.
 This makes me suspect other issues with services hanging when on my home network (but not on my cell data) may be related. 
 So: how does Emacs connect to elpa/melpa/etc? I'm hoping understanding this better might help me resolve my network issues.
 Other observations:
  
while the package update hung, I could still load webpages, including those for the repositories I use (elpa, melpa)
 
using curl -I to connect to the repositories also worked, even while I couldn't refresh the package list.
 
I build Emacs from source, and the problem existed on the previous build yesterday (which was several months old), and the latest build from sources pulled last night.
 
 As I said, not an Emacs issue, but maybe Emacs not being able to contact the repositories is a clue to the network issue?
 Any suggestions?
 Thanks,

 I'm finally taking the plunge and switching fully from Windows to Linux. Getting vterm on Windows was too involved to make me switch from my dedicated terminal emulator, but the process seems much more doable on Linux, so I've been considering it.
 However, I've also seen people praise Eat, but it seems like less people are familiar with it. And so I got curious whether people who have used both have a strong preference.
 If so, would you mind sharing a little about why you find one more appealing/ergonomic or why it may be more efficient/powerful than the other?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Some years ago, I wrote myself a tool to download financial transactions from my bank and put them into a ledger journal. I found that manually entering the transaction with the hledger interface was too tedious for me.
 The tool uses the german FinTS standard, so the number of supported banks is limited.
 I've now released a new version that is mainly written in Haskell instead of Python. I did that because I noticed that I am much more likely to work on Haskell projects in my free time, simply because it is more fun for me.
 Unfortunately, this complicated the setup process somewhat, as one can no longer just run pip install fints2ledger. I would love to improve this in the future but don't really know a better way.
 Code feedback is also appreciated, especially from the perspective of people not too familiar with Haskell.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am looking for a tool to organize my life and take notes for undergrad engineering studies — which is exactly what org-mode is perfect for. I would prefer to use Neovim instead though. 
 I feel like emacs seems like a walled garden — where I’ll start to feel like everything I do on a computer needs to be done in emacs, as opposed to using a variety of different purpose-built tools together for task management and note taking.
 I could just use: - Markdown and LaTeX plus vimwiki to take notes - Task- and time-warrior for an agenda and to-do list - Ledger for financial management - Various shell or Python scripts to tie things together
 I’ve seen that people switch to emacs entirely for org-mode, however, and I can’t shake the feeling that I should maybe switch over.
 Edit: I definitely used “walled garden” the wrong way here; I meant that I might feel like I have to use emacs to do everything instead of having more flexibility to use other software. I see what y’all mean though, I don’t have to use it for everything if I don’t want.
