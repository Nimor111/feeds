        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone. I'm new to Julia and language servers. I've set up Eglot with eglot-jl and it seems to be working fine. The only thing that's off is that Eglot takes 15 to 30 s to start up. It's not a big deal but it got me wondering if I misconfigured something.
 I'm running Emacs 30.0.50 with the latest version of the packages as of yesterday. My emacs config goes like this:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to use Emacs (doom, 29.1) via the daemon in MacOS (14.3, apple M2). I used to have the emacs-plus installed, but switched to emacs-macport. The first one seemed to have a homebrew service installed for the daemon, but it never worked for me, not sure why. I'm now trying to set up the daemon for emacs-macport.
 What I've gathered so far:
 - Opening emacs GUI and doing m-x start-server make the process be attached to that OS Window and, when it is closed, it all dies together.
 - running /opt/homebrew/opt/emacs-mac/Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS/Emacs --daemon gives me the terminal output I would expect when starting the daemon and a process, but when I try to emacsclient -cn, it opens a terminal emacs, not a GUI.
 Daemon start command output:
 Starting Doom Emacs in daemon mode! Initializing org-roam database... Clearing removed files... Clearing removed files...done Processing modified files... Processing modified files...done Copilot agent started. Starting Emacs daemon. Doom loaded 285 packages across 47 modules in 5.113s 
 - when using the launchctl, as indicated in the wiki (with the modifications to emacs' path, and --fg-daemon), it starts the process with the same output as above. But, when trying to emacsclient -cn it gives me *ERROR*: Terminal type xterm-kitty is not defined. Doing export TERM=xterm does fix that, but it still opens a (rather very bugged) terminal frame.
 - Lastly, I tried creating an Emacs.app via Automator, but when invoked, it gives me the error could not get terminal name, which, I suppose, comes from the fact it is trying to open in a terminal, not GUI.
 TL;DR: It seems I've managed to open the server, but not to open a GUI frame. Any tips?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am using awesome-tray and like the layout a lot. It does have some problems though, for instance there are errors on startup and I'm not able to set the color successfully. I'm wondering if anyone has experience with these type of packages?
 Another one that works well is mini-echo which is free of errors, but the code is structured in an advanced lisp style that's hard for me to interpret, so I have not been able to customize it for different reasons.
 It would be good to fix the errors in awesome-tray and improve it. The errors I get are fairly simple:
 awesome-tray.el: Warning: Pattern t is deprecated. Use _ instead [2 times]
 Warning: setting attribute ‘:background’ of face ‘mode-line-buffer-id’: nil value is invalid, use ‘unspecified’ instead.
 Warning: setting attribute ‘:foreground’ of face ‘region’: nil value is invalid, use ‘unspecified’ instead.Unable to load color "color" [2 times]
 I've been able to override how awesome-tray displays major modes with a list of shorthand strings and change the time format, so it seems easy to customize. I suspect setq awesome-tray-mode-line-active-color doesn't work because of the above errors, but I'm not certain.
 Anyway are there any other packages that would be a good choice, or does anyone have some advice on how I might go about fixing or improving awesome-tray? My lisp knowledge on it's own is not enough to locate the problem.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What kinds of buffers do you wish you could bookmark in Emacs that you can't usefully bookmark already? Emacs can of course bookmark specific locations in regular text files, but also several types of non-file buffers: dired, eshell, Man, eww, Info, help, image, vc-dir, doc-view, possibly others. Are there any others you'd like to be able to bookmark?
 Here are some ideas:
  
occur and grep buffers (jumping to the bookmark would rerun the search).
 
REPLs. I can imagine this being useful: you bookmark a Python REPL and later jumping to the bookmark starts a new REPL and reruns all the import statements you had run before (or maybe just reruns everything?, or everything marked with a special comment?)
 
shells. The eshell bookmarks are great, and that's what I use, but not everyone uses eshell. A shell bookmarker should preserve the current directory and whether you were ssh'ed into some other computer.
 
Shell command output buffers, the bookmarks should rerun the command. Same for compilation buffers (revert-buffer already knows how to rerun the compilation!).
 
 I'd love to see some more ideas for missing bookmark capabilities.

 I'm trying to find a good, generic, folding solution based on indentation level. This is just because I tend to have formatting outputs that don't have specific configuration for hs-minor-mode. hs-minor-mode seems like a good solution in general, but looks like it doesn't come with an obvious indentation-based level solution?
 I have used yafolding but in general I have found that I can't get yafolding-toggle-all to do something predictable. What it chooses to fold is never predictable to me.
 Any solution using hs-minor-mode?

 I've been trying to restrict the values that can be given to the CATEGORY property. Now I know that for a property I define -- MYPROP, say -- I can specify a set of allowed values by giving them as a list to the property MYPROP_ALL for example:
 #+PROPERTY: MYPROP_ALL Value1 Value2 Value3 
 Then if I use ‘C-c C-x p’ (‘org-set-property’) and answer "MYPROP" to its first prompt, the second prompt (which wants the value) forces me to stick to the list in MYPROP_ALL.[1] Also, both ‘S-<RIGHT>’ (‘org-property-next-allowed-value’) and ‘S-<LEFT>’ (‘org-property-previous-allowed-value’ respect the MYPTOP_ALL list as well.
 But when it comes to Special Properties that doesn't appear to work. So if I have:
 #+PROPERTY: CATEGORY_ALL Value1 Value2 Value3 
 then ‘C-c C-x p’ (‘org-set-property’) ignores the list in CATEGORY_ALL.[1] Furthermore, neither ‘S-<RIGHT>’ (‘org-property-next-allowed-value’) nor ‘S-<LEFT>’ (‘org-property-previous-allowed-value’ pay attention to it either. In fact both of them respond with "Allowed values for this property have not been defined".
 Is that the expected behavior, or am I doing something wrong?
 [1] Org may well give a completion list, but only if CATEGORY has already been given values elsewhere in the file, and then the list consists of all those values, and it still ignores CATEGORY_ALL. And that list of pre-used values is not enforced, the way an _ALL list is. It is merely a list of suggestions that can be ignored; brand new values can be entered without being trapped.

The implementation was pretty straightforward, but I had to make sure that the log file is not accessed concurrently by multiple fibers. I could have used a Ref to keep track of the state, but I came across Semaphore in ZIO and decided to give it a try. I was pleasantly surprised by how easy it was to use. 
 This is my new blog post about how to use Semaphore to implement concurrency control in ZIO.

I've also seen an example of someone running two VScodes, one for the project and the other for the test project, and notepad++ for editing config files.
 Does anyone find it weirder that no one seems to think this is a weird thing to do?

 I'm reading a string from console:
 add vet james bond espionage <command> <context> <command specific arguments> 
 My ADTs looked like this:
 object Context: case object Vet extends Context case object Owner extends Context trait Command trait ContextedCommand[T <: Context] extends Command { val arguments: List[String] } case class Add[T <: Context](context: T, arguments: List[String]) extends ... more commands 
 My flow is: read string from console -> validate command & context -> validate arguments depending on context and command (pattern matching) -> execute specific "Repository" method depending on command + context (pattern matching) .
 What refactoring should I do, if I'm trying to go to the tagless final approach?
 Currently I'm going in circles fiddling with the code from the command and implementing something that seems wrong and scrapping it.
 Would the correct refactoring steps be:
  
remove context: T from Command proprties
 validate command & context the same way 
 create separate given instances for validators addVetValidator() / addOwnerValidator()
 continue with distinct given instances for command handling logic 
  
I've watched RockTheJvm's video/article and DevInsideYou's series but I feel like I'm too grug brained.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sorry for verbose, detail is here.
 At first, I'm reading https://okmij.org/ftp/Haskell/extensible/more.pdf to understand "Free monad". I mean the word FFree in title is from this paper.
 And maybe I have been able to understand what is FFree in this paper. This paper says FFree is a data type which has two aspects Pure and Impure, especially Impure works as an action handler like monad's >>= and it presents fmap. I think that FFree seems very simple and reasonable.
 So I implemented FFree monad as written in the paper. ```haskell {-# LANGUAGE GADTs #-} import Control.Monad ((>=>)) data FFree f a where Pure :: a -> FFree f a Impure :: f x -> (x -> FFree f a) -> FFree f a
 instance Monad (FFree f) where Impure fx k' >>= k = Impure fx (k' >=> k) Pure a >>= k = k a ```
 And I need Functor and Applicative for Monad instance.
 ```haskell instance Functor (FFree f) where fmap f (Pure a) = Pure (f a) -- Continuous is here, impressible. fmap f (Impure fx k) = Impure fx (fmap f . k)
 instance Applicative (FFree f) where pure = Pure Pure f <> Pure a = Pure (f a) Pure f <> Impure fx k = Impure fx (fmap f . k) Impure fx f <> p@(Pure _) = Impure fx (\x -> f x <> p) -- I have no idea how implement this pattern. Impure fx f <> Impure gx g = undefined `` I could writeFunctorwith no problem (maybe), but I couldn't write<>implementation betweenImpurecase. Here is my question again, how do I implementFFree` of Applicative?
 From the first, What does Applicative applying between Impure mean theoretically?
 P.S. No need to ensure what a compiler says, I know why I can't it. Left hand f x and right hand one are rigid types each other.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, PyCharm overtook my life for day to day Python development and Notepad++ was fine for editing Windows text files. 
 I was dismayed that I could not get realtime word-count in N++ and also dismayed at the author of N++ in how he responded.
 So here I am back to Emacs 5 years later.
 A few questions
 the sidebar has a section called "configurations" (plural) yet only lists Better-Defaults for setting up emacs. my own configuration settings were based on technomancy's Emacs Starter Kit. What other frameworks for managing defaults are out there?
 What is the best Emacs package archive these days? my setup references MELPA and ELPA.
 it seems something called "Embark" is replacing helm? Currently my attempt to load emacs from init.el choked on trying to call init-helm:
  Debugger entered--Lisp error: (file-missing "Cannot open load file" "No such file or directory" "helm-config") require(helm-config) load-with-code-conversion("c:/code/emacs/init/init-helm.el" "c:/code/emacs/init/init-helm.el" nil t) require(init-helm) load-with-code-conversion("c:/code/emacs/init/init-custom-packages.el" "c:/code/emacs/init/init-custom-packages.el" nil t) require(init-custom-packages) eval-buffer() ; Reading at buffer position 185 funcall-interactively(eval-buffer) command-execute(eval-buffer record) execute-extended-command(nil "eval-buffer" "eval-b") funcall-interactively(execute-extended-command nil "eval-buffer" "eval-b") command-execute(execute-extended-command)

The definitive fix would involve refining the logic within org-roam-db-sync, but until then, a workaround is to set the path to its true location or use the file-truename function as shown below:
 elisp (setq org-directory (file-truename "~/Notebooks/") org-roam-directory (file-truename "~/Notebooks/RoamNotes/") ) 
 Discovering the Issue:
 Each time I fired up Emacs or initiated a db sync, I was greeted with the all-too-familiar "Processing modified files..." message, which seemed to take an eternity even on my beefy M2 Mac. Rather than incrementally updating, the process was going through eve…]]></summary>

 I.e.
 * Level 1 ** Level 1a ** Level 1b * Level 2 ** Level 2a ** Level 2b 
 I.e. operate on Level 1b to produce (with all the heading contents intact):
 * Level 1 ** Level 1a * Level 2 ** Level 1b ** Level 2a ** Level 2b 
 In the world of lispy/paredit, this would be barfing from Level 1, slurping to the beginning of Level 2. 
 The only thing I can figure is to promote Level 1b by a level, move point down to Level 2, move Level 2 up above Level 1b, return to Level 1b, demote it a level.

 ```
 type X = A | B | C
 ```
 Is it possible to make a type which represents the concept of "any of this type except these types"? 
 I have the following data types.
 ```
 trait Base {}
 trait Special extends Base {}
 trait A extends Special {}
 trait B extends Special {}
 trait C extends Base {}
 trait D extends Base {}
 ```
 I am looking for something like `type Y = Base - Special`. Today, I could write that as `type Y = C | D`. However, next week, someone might create `trait E extends Base`, at which point that definition of `Y` becomes out of date. At the location where one would logically create `E`, it is not at all obvious that you would need to update `Y`. 
 Is something like this supported in the compiler? I didn't find it in the documentation, but then I couldn't even find the documentation for `|`, so I obviously did not find a potentially relevant part of the documentation.

 https://github.com/minad/corfu/issues/420#event-11611884483
 Is there a way for me to set the height of alternative fonts?
 Alternatively, can anyone recommend a monospace font that I could use for both Latin and Chinese text?

 This is 100% my fault, but i have no clue how to even begin troubleshooting this. Any tips on how to get to the bottom of this without having to manually go through my plugins one-by-one?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I dunno if anyone else has run into this but I have a buffer; let's say 9 lines. And I have a function which runs (previous-line) (beginning-of-line 1) and said function is bound to a key (let's say <up>).
 So I apply a text-property of 'invisible using (pos-bol) of the first line and (1+ (pos-eol)) in order to get the first line to disappear, like it's not even there.
 If I'm on line 3 and M-: my function, it does what I'd expect and (point) will return the (pos-bol) of the second line. But, if I execute my function by pressing <up> from line 3, (point) keeps returning back 1, the point of the beginning of line 1 rather than the point at the beginning of line 2.
 Is this expected behavior? I'd be less weirded out if running code through M-: gave back similar results but I get what I'd expect to happen no matter what code I run and only the unexpected behavior when running the exact same code via a key binding.
 This seems to happen even when running Emacs with -Q. Also occurs when I try with (backward-char) and C-b: so long as it's the first line – at the top of the buffer – which is invisible, there's a difference between executing code by itself vs. via key commands (with the latter putting me at point 1, every time).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been looking at the docs for tree-sitter. I think I'm pretty sold on trying it out for c++ programming, as there's a lot of utility in smarter highlighting (and easy customization of the grammar). 
 However, I have a question (of course): 
 The only examples I could find of custom highlighting was assigning custom faces to different syntactic elements.
 But I need not to just be able to change the font but also display properties so that I can provide substitutions (unicode symbols for example), the 'raise property for superscripts, :align-to to keep my end of line comments lined up since I use proportional fonts, and more. 
 Can it do that? 
 I suppose I could combine other highlighting packages to get this functionality, but the thing I was hoping to get out of tree-sitter was better accuracy in my substitution operators as well, using syntax queries instead of regexs.

 So I had my old dog of a laptop die on me the other day and had to run out and buy a new one. Settled on an M2 Air since I mostly do writing, documents and some analysis and the version is Sonoma 14.3. I live in Emacs, I do all my writing with it and basically feel like I can't live without it. I have been running Railwaycats emacsport for, I dunno eight years or so..? Installed via Homebrew, which I don't really have much experience with since it always just worked whenever I've used it. But this time with this new computer I really can't seem to figure out how to get it done nor what I dare to do. Has anyone else been through this? If so how did you do it? Should I just try with "--cask" even though my OS isn't listed?
 If you don't know what I'm talking about, this is the repo: https://github.com/railwaycat/homebrew-emacsmacport
 I am confused and looking for some guidance here. I was hoping one of you pros had some.
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Spent a lot of time trying to get emojis working again (were working normally with emacs 27-28) and now I need help.
  
I have Noto Color Emoji installed on my system
 
system-configuration-features:
 
 "ACL CAIRO DBUS FREETYPE GIF GLIB GMP GNUTLS GPM GSETTINGS HARFBUZZ JPEG JSON LCMS2 LIBOTF LIBSYSTEMD LIBXML2 M17N_FLT MODULES NATIVE_COMP NOTIFY INOTIFY PDUMPER PNG RSVG SECCOMP SOUND SQLITE3 THREADS TIFF TOOLKIT_SCROLL_BARS TREE_SITTER WEBP X11 XDBE XIM XINPUT2 XPM GTK3 ZLIB"
 using emacs-nativecomp in arch linux
  
when running describe-char on emojis I get 
 display: no font available
 
Trying different font with
 (set-fontset-font t 'emoji '("JoyPixels" . "iso10646-1") nil 'prepend) has no effect
 
I have the following config, can any of this cause emojis not to display? 
 
 ``` (setq default-font-height 120) (set-face-attribute 'default nil :family "Fira Code" :height default-font-height :weight 'regular)
 (set-fontset-font t 'arabic (font-spec :family "Amiri Typewriter")) (set-face-attribute 'fixed-pitch nil :family "Fira Code" :height default-font-height :weight 'regular :fontset "fontset-default")
 (set-fontset-font t 'arabic (font-spec :script 'arabic) nil 'append) (set-fontset-font t 'emoji '("JoyPixels" . "iso10646-1") nil 'prepend)
 ;; proportional font (create-fontset-from-fontset-spec "-------------fontset-proportional") (set-fontset-font "fontset-proportional" 'latin (font-spec :family "Fira Sans" :height default-font-height)) (set-fontset-font "fontset-proportional" 'arabic (font-spec :family "IBM Plex Sans Arabic")) (set-face-attribute 'variable-pitch nil :font "Roboto" :fontset "fontset-proportional")

 I want to remotely connect to an instance of SSH running on a remote OSX machine (to save files I forgot to save).
 So I run (in the terminal)
  emacsclient -t 
 Then I get (momentarily) emacs to display a buffer in this terminal. But in around 3 seconds, it quits and I am back into the command line.
 This problem happens even if I am running emacsclient inside Terminal in front of the computer running emacs (no ssh involved).
 I can do it over and over again, and I am always getting the same result. I have checked and this is a problem I also have locally.
 I have checked that I run the emacsclient that corresponds with my emacs installation (Emacs-29.1, in /Applications/Emacs.app/
 Does anybody have any idea what is going on?
 thank you in advance,

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For context, I am a noob, I started off working on a simple lab assignment project in VScode, which is just a package and two classes. one class holds the main method, and the other is a class that holds data. I wanted to see if I could work on the assignment in Doom emacs, and quickrun seemed like the easiest solution to having the same functionality as the run button in vscode instead of manually compiling every class in a project. I tried executing quickrun on the main class but it seems like it's not recognizing the other class in the package. 
 ​
 Are there any additional steps to setting up quickrun correctly?

This process not only presented some technical challenges but also involved a substantial amount of work. There are many usage scenarios to support, and the testing alone took nearly two weeks.
 With this, Metanote's support for the core features of Org mode is more comprehensive, including basic document structure, custom task management, custom InBufferSettings like tags, Agenda views, custom Capture, and more. I believe Metanote is now one of the most complete applications supporting Org mode outside of Emacs. In future development, we will gradually introduce support for rich text rendering, including images, tables, hyperlinks, encryption, export functions, Roam Research, and more. Stay tuned.

I wonder if it would help new users learn about monads if we said "a Monad is something that has a do notation, and you have to write >>= to explain what its do notation means".
 Personally I find (m >>= g) >>= h == m >>= (\x -> g x >>= h) really obscure and (f >=> g) >=> h == f >=> (g >=> h) really cool, but not relevant to practice, but I find
 do y <- do x <- m f x g y == do x <- m y <- f x g y 
 really practical and straightforward. What do you think?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone!
 Long-time Emacs user (this is my 8th year!) and lurker on this sub. I use Emacs for *nearly* everything. Coding, reading, writing, RSS, ToDos, knowledge base, website, music etc.
 So, I'm juggling Emacs on a bunch of different setups: a Linux machine with Ubuntu at home, a RHEL workstation and a node I ssh into at work, a MacOS laptop, a few Raspberry Pis. You see where this is going. Each has different uses, but some core things that I like to keep consistent.
 With the mix of OSX, Ubuntu, RHEL, plus the GUI and TTY variations, I need to change my Emacs config on every machine (even though a lot stays the same across the board).
 The real headache starts when I change something on one machine, and I want to apply that to all (or some) of the other machines. Yak shaving and all...
 Right now, my setup's built around an init.el that loads up a settings.org file, which has my literate config. The way I deal with some things (for example, remapping key bindings on MacOS) is by wrapping it up with conditionals. But it's looking quite ugly and is more annoying to maintain.
 I wonder what the best approach here is. Split my config into multiple files and load them as needed depending on where I am? Maybe mess around with Git branches for different setups? (And how would I even start with that?) Git submodules?
 Are there some tools that already deal with this? I am sure this is not an Emacs-only problem.
 Thanks in advance and would love to hear how you deal with this :)

 I'm a newbie with emacs and this may be a stupid question, but I'm using Doom Emacs (Evil) using emacs-plus 29.2 on Mac using homebrew (Apple Silicon) and I'm in org-mode (version 9.7) using org-bullets and after I finish writing my bullet points, I can't seem to unindent. How do I achieve this?
 Example:
  
Item 1 
 Item 2
 
  
(Next line are indented at same indentation as item 2)
 I want to reset back to left most region after item 2 and not remain indented.

 Copying the DLL from the previous Emacs 29.1 solves the issue.
 When comparing with 29.1, I see the following are missing in 29.2, despite downloading the full version with dependencies:
 emacs-29.1/bin/libgmpxx-4.dll emacs-29.1/bin/libgnutls-openssl-27.dll emacs-29.1/bin/libgnutlsxx-30.dll emacs-29.1/bin/libharfbuzz-gobject-0.dll emacs-29.1/bin/libharfbuzz-icu-0.dll emacs-29.1/bin/libharfbuzz-subset-0.dll emacs-29.1/bin/libtiffxx-5.dll emacs-29.1/bin/libturbojpeg.dll emacs-29.1/bin/libwebpdecoder-3.dll emacs-29.1/bin/libwebpmux-3.dll emacs-29.1/bin/libXpm-noX4.dll 
 I do not know what could be the implications in terms of missing functionalities.
 What do you suggest doing?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am building a small compiler in Haskell and I just finished the syntax analysis phase. During syntax analysis, it was easy to keep track of the line and column numbers where the parsing failed and report back what was expected and what the compiler needed. 
 But if the parsing succeeds, the generated AST is passed on to check the semantics. However, my AST nodes do not store any positional (or spanning) information. So if I find a semantic error, I can only tell what the error is but cannot provide any line or column number information.
 The easiest way to solve this is to store the spanning information on most nodes I have defined, which is tedious and lengthy. Additionally, I would have to write boilerplate code on parsing functions. 
 Is there any other method you'd recommend for this problem?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is a rather vague idea that is still forming:
 Could a SoC project be proposed to train or fine-tune a LLM on Scala code?
 Most LLMs are primarily trained on Python code, just because there is so much of it, leading to more generated Python code, ...
 For Scala there is less code to train on, on the other hand models like Phi-2 show that a smaller set of highly curated training data (in this case well-written code) can make even smaller models compete with bigger ones trained on "the internet".
 A fork of e.g. CodeLlama 70B, fine-tuned with the full Git history of successful Scala projects might decrease the gap between code generation capabilities for Python and Scala.
 The aider project proposes a diff format that is more amenable to LLM generation than the standard Git diff. The transformation from one to the other should be rather mechanical and a well-written Git commit is a very close to an instruction a human might give an LLM in order to get a code modification done, so hopefully one could get a sufficient amount of decent training data from existing open source Scala repos. 
 I created a GitHub issue on the ScalaCenter Google Summer of Code repo as well, but Reddit might be a better place for brainstorming and discussion.
 Feel free to post any ideas, critique, proposals related to the topic here.

 At that stage it may become easier to copy out the row being edited and the headers to a new table, transpose it and edit vertically, transpose it back again and insert it into its original position without the headers.
 This is rather like the form mode in spreadsheets which enable a wide column to be viewed without navigating horizontally.
 The problem is the formulas get messed up in the process.
 Is there some fix out there for this issue.

 Obviously gdb and other tools are on the container, it's just likely that the path used (/docker:<container-id>:/path/to/binary) doesn't exist in dap's eyes. Anyone thought about or have some sort of workaround for this?

 Setting up a Magit forge is little bit of work. But it really pays off. Totally recommend.
 By the way, I noticed that in Github Magit has 427 supporters and in LiberaPay 130. I like round numbers a lot more. How about 450 and 140?

 So what I've been trying to move (technically I want this to occur every two weeks but just starting small to test it):
 ** Recycling
 <2024-01-30 Tue>
 I can only get it to work through setting :time-prompt to t and typing the date in manually. But this is tedious
 Managed to thoroughly confuse myself so I'm giving up and asking. If I'm not going about this a sensible way feel free to tell me also. Thank you.
 edit: I should say I have read the documentation multiple times. I may have missed something though. I have also tried to google my problem but I struggled to find anything fully relevant.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm currently learning to use emacs and org/org-roam. So far it doesn't seem too complicated and I could implement a note taking system that would work for me. But I barely scratched the surface and wonder if I could make my current workflow (coming from Obsidian) work.
 So what I currently do is to mostly take daily notes in which I have a template that covers the following:
  
What did I do (just a bunch of bullet points)
 Ideas 
 Each idea is a bulletpoint
 Each idea has some metadata like "subject:: homelab"
 
 Daily journal (some bulletpoints)
 Tasks 
 New Tasks, that I want to get done (tasks usually have metadata to categorize them)
 A list of all tasks I finished today
 
  
Then I have a couple of notes that display this information in a grouped way. For example I have a tasks note that displays all my open tasks. And I have a homelab note, that lists all ideas and tasks with the metadata "subject:: homelab" under headings for ideas and tasks. Also the list of completed tasks in the daily note is auto populated with tasks that have the completed date set to today.
 Now I'm trying to do something similar with org-roam. 
 TL;DR: I want to query my org-roam notes for specific data that is marked with metadata and display it in other notes
 Thank you!

 I have created WikiMusic, an invite-only community, with a well spirited effort to share musical knowledge with the world. This means tabs and PDFs for several instruments for music of all kind.
 The backend for WikiMusic is made with Haskell, using Servant, Free monads (freer-simple), Hasql and more.
 I am more of a backend dev type of person, but dabble in frontend every now and then. The frontend works with Svelte, Tailwind, Skeleton. The platform works with Haskell (.nix), Nix, PostgreSQL and others.
 I'd love to hear your experiences with the page, and with the UX, the Haskell code, and look forward to feedback you may have. If you want to become a member of WikiMusic feel free to email me at [jjbigorra@gmail.com](mailto:jjbigorra@gmail.com)

This works well, except when it comes to lsp integration. Sometimes the "global" server that is installed via lsp via the prompt won't play nice when I switch language versions and simply crashes over and over for every file I open.
 Any suggestions on how I can set my config to check for an lsp server installed in the project dir? In fact, it would be very useful if emacs only used/installed in the project dir and never used/installed servers to the emacs directory.

 I cannot find any documentation on how I can have a custom Activity for Android (and likewise other platform-specific code for desktop/iOS) in that standard project structure. The only thing I could find online was this repo project but I am brand new at Nix and quickly lost, I'm also not sure it's a good idea to copy their build scripts (issue).
 So question: How do I for example have Obelsik use my custom Activity which can platform-specific code? A good solution should allow me to provide platform-specific implementations which may be used by the platform-agnost…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After meld became unstable for me recently I decided to check out ediff instead. My main workflow is to make a series of changes in a git project and then diff them against the checked in versions before doing a commit as a last check. ediff-revision works for single files although quitting is sometimes a bit odd. 
 But ediff-directory-revision doesn't seem to do what I want.
  
It only seems to operate on a directory and not recursively below it. 
 All the files popup in the registry rather than just the ones that have changed.
  
Is there some way to get the behavior I want. (A tree view of the fileset would be a nicety)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi I am Haskell newbie and I am little bit confused about "built-in" types concept in Haskell. Coming from C++ background, I understand "built-in" as constructs recognizable by compiler without including external libraries. In Haskell however I see in many literature sources, types like Int|Num| Bool, are treated as "built-in", or core language features, though they can be easily "excluded", by disabling Prelude module, which in my understanding is just external "library" included by default. To add to confusion, some core language constructs, like guards will not even work without including Prelude. On other hand constructs like 
 import Prelude() 
 foo x = 1
 compiles well, but then what is the "1" type in this case (Isn't Num defined by including Prelude)?
 So I guess the question is - Where true (in C++ sense) bult-in language features can be found if at all. And should Prelude be understood as true external library or as "grey area" combining both traits of external library and compiler intrinsic syntax.

 I'm currently starting to learn and develop with Haskell.

Now I started to develop a small app with Flutter and Dart and i was really surprised that Dart more or less just provides unchecked exceptions by default. Because I thought Dart is a relative young language I was wondering, why one would decide to design the language this way. Is there a real benefit?
 The question is not directly to Haskell related, but I thought there are many smart people here and maybe someone could explain it to me.

I know I can do a two active schedule dates with some dashes to get it to show a span of time i.e. <date>--<date> . 
 However I'd prefer if I could do some prefix / augmentation to the agenda like below. Imagine the prep of salads would take 2.5 hours and is marked with 2.5 hrs of effort. 
  Task: 18:30...... Scheduled: NEXT Prep Salads for Wed/Thurs/Fri |-> 19:00...... |-> 20:00...... |-> 21:00...... Reminder: 21:30...... Start Evening Wind Down Habit: 22:00...... Scheduled: NEXT Evening Review 
 I know a some lisp and want to learn more...but org and agenda are quite big code bases to jump into fresh. Figured I'd ask here before I start down this road of trying to make the feature. 
 Full solutions or even just some food for thought or starting points of what to look into would be great.

 Since Haskell is lazy strongly typed language , it shouldn't even try to evalute different types. So I checked types of two different entities. ( Are they objects as in C++ or python, or are they something else , I don't know what the runtime model of Haskell is ? )
 ghci> :t "abc"
 "abc" :: String
 ghci> :t ['a','b','c']
 ['a','b','c'] :: [Char]
 Okay, so list of Char is different from String. So they shouldn't evalute when checked for equality. Since [Char] and String are clearly different types, why following is evaluted? 
 ghci> "abc" == ['a','b','c']
 True

 ;; Fallback font for unicode symbols, both for standalone & client modes (let ((symbols-font "Noto Sans Symbols 2-16")) (set-fontset-font t 'symbol symbols-font) (add-hook 'server-after-make-frame-hook `(lambda () (set-fontset-font nil 'symbol ,symbols-font))))

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone,
 I've got the problem that "turning back in time" is not possible from org roam dailies.
 I can use org-roam-dailies-goto-yesterday without a problem but as soon as I want to go back e.g. 3 days, day per day org-roam-dailies-goto-previous-node is very convenient.
 I am in the today's daily file and try to use this function but the message I get is "Not in a daily-note". The behavior is the same for org-roam-dailies-goto-next-node or org-roam-dailies-find-next-node (and so on).
 It seems like (org-roam-dailies--daily-note-p) is nil if I excute it as lisp function in todays org-roam-daily buffer/file.
 I have no clue how I can resolve this.
 Anyone having the same problems or any ideas?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[tl;dr so am looking for a way-in to all the syntax highlighting and magit goodness emacs offers for my non-org-mode uses.
 edit - I use doom by the way
 I'm a org +roam2 user, but I find myself doing more and more "coding" these days.
 I always intend to use emacs / magit etc for code projects, but find myself getting bewidered and end up using something else.
 As a non-dev I'm unfamiliar with the terms used in emacs-world.
 My experiences so far:
 1 Previously I've managed to tramp in to my headless Pi from emacs to edit my Home Assistant .yaml file - but have even stopped doing that because of the loooooong command I need to type (I have never worked out how to paste it - or do some lisp magic) to make it work. 
 2 I looked into Python (Anki Vector SDK) but ended up confused and went back to nano / Mu (via Windows);
 3 I also looked into Arduino (c++) but ended up confused about interfacing with the microcontroller itself, so went back to Arduino IDE (Windows);
 4 I had a platformIO project (Gaggiauino - STM32 Blackpill). I couldn't fathom platformIO in emacs, fell back on VSCode on linux (which threw a bunch of errors) and ended up using VSCode in Windows.
 I may be wrong, but I feel if I can start just one project in emacs (probably editing something on a remote machine) then everything will click?
 Any tips on where to begin?

Why do you say what is the meaning of life?
  
Emacs is the main source of problems in my life.
  
Emacs? Hah! I would appreciate it if you would continue.
  
Well, it has many bugs I want to fix.
  
What makes you believe you might want to fix?
  
I can't live with bugs existing in Emacs. It's embarassing.
  
Earlier you said you would like to fix?
  
Yes.
  
I see... Well, are you sure that this is so?
  
Right. I want the bugs to be fixed but I also want to get other things done.
  
Is it because you also want to get other things done that you came to me?
  
Yes. Emacs stops me from getting other things done.
  
Are you sure?
  
No, maybe it's just me. Maybe I need to... stop configuring Emacs?
  
My secretary will send you a bill.
  
It worked for me. You can run Emacs' psychotherapist with M-x doctor RET.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I know there is a ton of discussion around this but i'm not sure i've found my "perfect" solution yet. Maybe some of can weigh in on which path is "worth" following.
 Basically, i come from vim and neovim. I've worked with emas and neovim in parallel for years now. I generally enjoy the "regular" emacs keybindings for UI stuff. But i feel like i'm lossing a LOT of editing power when leaving evil behind. Yet, getting it to work consistently is a bunch of work and it'll always be 99% at best.
 Now the relevant part. I'm pretty sure i've only scratched the surface of emacs native keybinds. What i find missing is "simple" stuff like "delete between paranthesis" or "duplicate this line". Is this something emacs can "just do" and i just haven't found it yet?
 I see 2 ways forward:
  
Stick with evil and invest the time to create consistent remaps where evil-collection and others don't quite do it.
 Stick to emacs and remap/write functionality i'm missing from vim
  
Note that ergonomics are a secondary thought. I have a custom keyboard so arrow keys are still on hjkl and modifiers are on thumbkeys. I'm also not married to the idea of modal editing. In fact, i enjoy not having to worry about modes and just "type away". But deleting/changing a specified area is just something i haven't found a good solution in emacs to.
 So, thoughts? Is what i'm missing from emacs just there and i need to find it, or am i better of investing fully into evil and making that work?

 My configuration:

 I don't have any particular indentation related packages or modes enabled beyond stock python-ts-mode, so what's going on here? Whenever I start a new line it jumps to that point on the screen?
 Any help is very much appreciated!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At the top of my org files I usually have some in-buffer settings stuff. Those include things like #+TITLE:, #+STARTUP:, and, more recently, #+COLUMNS:. And I've also sometimes put local file variables up there, right at the top, in a # -*- ... -* line.
 But when I put the buffer into column mode, those settings lines are messing up my view of things; in particular they are creating a gap between column view's column headers, and the various column-ized headings down below in the buffer proper.
 Is there a way to hide all that settings cruft so I get a cleaner view in column mode? (Actually, it would be nice to be able to hide it at all times, but it's worst in column mode).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[nothunks-0.2.0 is available on Hackage. The new version can point out exact location of unwanted thunks (which could lead to space leaks), e.g. haskell ThunkInfo { thunkInfo = Right "fromModel :: Int @ test/Test/NoThunks/Class.hs:198:53-84" }  This is only supported when compiling with ghc-9.4 or newer (although the feature needed to support it is available since ghc-9.2), and requires -finfo-table-map (if -fdistinct-constructor-tables is added the location information will be more precise, and thus it's recommended for debugging space leaks with nothunks).
 When info tables are not available the type context is available, which was supported in earlier versions.
 The new version also includes a few more instances of some data types exposed by base package, e.g. various semigroup & monoid newtype wrappers and the Solo data type.
 I would like to thank IOG for supporting this work and colleagues from Well-Typed.

 I am working on small mode for editing pal files, which is a poor-man calendar agenda.
 Everything is more-less done, and almost ready to write a blog about it, but I am facing the problem with faces.
 Problem: custom defined faces are not displaying (at all).
 My definitions:
 (defface pal-todo-face '((t (:foreground "orange red"))) "Face for word TODO") (font-lock-add-keywords 'pal-mode '(("TODO" . 'pal-todo-face))) (add-hook 'pal-mode-hook (lambda () (font-lock-mode 1))) (defun pal-mode-set-face () "Set the face function for pal-mode." (setq-local font-lock-defaults '(pal-mode-font-lock-keywords))) (add-hook 'pal-mode-hook 'pal-mode-set-face) 
 Where pal-mode is defined as:
 (defun pal-mode () "Major mode for editing pal files" (interactive) (setq major-mode 'pal-mode mode-name "Pal")) 
 I use a similar approach to define custom faces for tcl-mode and other extensions. There it works.... 
 Where could be the snag here?
 Thanks for any idea.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To follow up on my previous demo of text editing, I have a new demo on using LLMs to manipulate org-mode in a structured way.
 This shows using LLMs to produce JSON, which I then turn into both subheadings in the first part of the demo, and task estimates in the last part. This is part of an effort I'm making to find a good way to support more complicated LLM interactions than we've seen so far. This one isn't just showing the ability to get structured output, but also the ability to refine the previous results as part of a "conversation" with the LLM that started in the first interaction. I haven't seen these things being done before, but I may be missing something. The details and code links can be found in https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2024-01/msg01134.html.

I discovered Zettelkasten in 2020 when I started working on a rather large personal project called MindOS. I was trying to create content in the intersection of philosophy, psychology, programming and rationality. During the research phase, I understood that it was going to be impossible to keep all of this in my mind - even with the note taking method that I used at that stage. I needed a better system.
This search led me to Zettelkasten, and I immediately fell in love with it! Since then I have actively trying to encourage others to use it as well. To do this, I have written tutorials, videos, created a couple of tools, etc. But my biggest and most resent contribution is a book I wrote and published a few months back: Zettelkasten and the Art of Knowledge Management.
My Zettelkasten Process...
I have 2 vaults. Everything I learn that is useful for others go into Obsidian - and I publish it as a Digital Garden at https://notes.binnyva.com
All my personal information goes into a Logseq graph. This includes...

 Since 2011, I'm was a full-time macOS user, until some months ago when I decided to stop supporting companies like Apple and brought a new PC and putted NixOS on it; I'm still using macOS for my day job, the company doesn't allow me to use Linux. This was the moment where I put myself in trouble.
 Firstly, I was really productive on macOS and using the CMD key in combination with the arrows to move around on the line, quickly select and all of that. These are the moves that I'm missing more on, coming back to Linux. The need to use a Home and End key to do the same thing is killing my productivity, mainly due to the fact there is no dedicated key to do that on my laptop keyboard or on the Keychron K6.
 On my Mac I used to use VS…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, I finally picked Scala 3 for my new product and I'd like to share some experience. Overall, it's a tool for reservations. Involves a bunch of CRUD. Nothing special or particularly challenging. The stack was classic "spartan": Tapir, ZIO, Quill, Circe, Cats...
 The good:
 Tapir folks nailed it! That's pretty much all I can say about them. ZIO also worked flawlessly. Quill was a pleasant surprise since it was the spot where I expected most of the obstacles. Although, the general documentation of Quill could be improved. E.g. in the context of structure, more examples, etc. But in all fairness, well done.
 The bad:
 Some things do not work quite well with new Scala features. E.g. a lot of hacking around various encoders and decoders for opaque types or enums. Some libraries are still not supported which is bonkers. E.g. I miss Scalamock and Cornichon.
 The ugly:
 Tooling. The neverending story... Let's begin with Metals. Metals is like a... musket. Sometimes it fires, sometimes it misfires, and sometimes explodes straight to your face. In a lot of cases, I had to kill its Java process, remove the target dir., and reimport the project. Funny enough, IntelliJ worked okish. With, few error reports when there are no actual errors. However, the experience is kind of clunkier than with Scala 2. Also, I noticed that sometimes incremental compilation doesn't work quite well and you can end up with some weird behavior.
 The unnecessary: 
 Indentation syntax. I don't want to start a rant... especially if I start asking questions about how much time and resources this feature required. Especially, since Scala has much greater "burning issues". In all fairness, I didn't see any benefit from having this.
 To conclude: 
 The experience was ok, spiced with some rough edges. From a Scala beginner's perspective, I presume it would be quite nasty. Overall, there's still a lot of work to do.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Probably it's been asked many times, still, I'm not sure which way should I go.
 I'm hungarian, and my solution to write hungarian in emacs (which I have barely done) was that I just simply typed "auoeiuo" instead of "áúüű....".
 Lately I started to have the need to write text for others, so using the correct vowels with "umlauts" became needed more and more often. It would be amazing if I could just simply switch layout and go on with my life not fighting with my muscle memory. Most often I still use us layout, not only because of the shortcuts, but also typing special characters like \, [], etc... on hungarian layout really a pain in the ass. On hungarian layout I will almost never use any "programming characters", I'm pretty sure.
 The problem I have for example is that "C-_" is "C-Ü" or "C-y" is "C-z" on hungarian layout, which doesn't work anymore. I don't want to learn different combinations, neither fighting my muscle memory every time when once a week I want to write some longer hungarian text in emacs.
 I have a feeling that there could be a trick that any time i'm using a different layout, (and probably I should also put a condition that I'm in txt mode for not mess up things like dired or magit), emacs would interpret my keystrokes differently when I hold down C or M. So I would use the same key for typing a single "ü" and "C-_" for example.
 What could be the simplest way to set up emacs like that? Can you post me a link where it's already answered? I'm pretty sure it's been answered a couple of times, I'm just too stupid to find it.
 Thank you!

 Failed to request slack-authorize: invalid_auth 
 I've included slack in my dotspacemacs-configuration-layers, and here is what I have in my dotspacemacs/user-config (with personal parts redacted): 
  (slack-register-team :name "emacs-slack" :default t :client-id "xxx@xxx.com" :client-secret "xoxd-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx" :token "xoxc-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx" :subscribed-channels '(general slackbot)) 
 I got the client-secret and token by following the direction in the emacs-slack package (as directed by the spacemacs slack layer documentation). 
 There does seem to be some differences in nomenclature between the spacemacs layer and emacs-slack, maybe I'm entering the wrong thing? And the instructions for the spacemacs layer doesn't go into enough detail. Is name suppose to be the name of the slack team I use? Is client-secret the same as the d cookie from the emacs-slack instructions or is it my password? 
 If someone has it working could you provide a copy of your user-config entry (with the personal stuff redacted of course, but not so much that I can't tell if I'm doing it right or wrong.) and maybe some details about each of the items?
 It does seem that emacs-slack isn't under development any more, maybe it just doesn't work anymore?

 This is part of my effort to replace my three TiddlyWiki instances with org files. I've looked at a number of conversion tools written by others, and ended up rolling a small(-ish) Perl script to do about 90% of the conversion, from a JSON export of a given TW instance.
 The first TW instance I've converted is a journal of my scale modeling projects. In it, I have future projects, current projects, and completed projects. I would like it if the completed projects (all of which have a tag "Completed" on their level-1 headline) were folded. I read in the manual that adding :VISIBILITY: folded to the properties drawer would do this, but it didn't work for me. And, as I already have a tag unique to these headlines, it would be great if I could trigger this based on the tag.
 Is there a way to run elisp code when an org file is first opened, specific to a file, with which I could do this? I suppose it could be done with a hook, but I would likely want code to be specific to a given file. (That is, I might have a similar-but-different need in the other files I'm yet to convert.)
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[the problem
 so i have this in my doom emacs org mode setup which make the headings a bit bigger then other stuff emacs-lisp (with-eval-after-load 'org (dolist (face '((org-level-1 . 1.3) (org-level-2 . 1.2) (org-level-3 . 1.1) (org-level-4 . 1.05) (org-level-5 . 1.1) (org-level-6 . 1.1) (org-level-7 . 1.1) (org-level-8 . 1.1))) (set-face-attribute (car face) nil :weight 'bold :height (cdr face)))) 
 but when i enter the org-columns view it is a complete mess as i have variable pitch and visual-fill-columns mode enabled , the big font size in org-columns headings flow to more then one line and different heading levels are indented differently due to their different font size.
 what i want in theory
 is to toggle the enlarged heights of the headings temporarily while in org-columns mode to normal settings and then toggle back when i leave the org-columns 
 is it possible in emacs? or is it something else that i need but i dont know about it

This is another installment of the What Are You Working On? thread. Add to this discussion by telling us about your zettelkasten journey. Share with us what you're learning. Sharing helps me and, hopefully, you, too. It helps me clarify my goals and visualize my thinking. And sometimes, a conversation sparks a magical moment where we can dive into an idea worth exploring. We'd love to hear more from you.  🫵🏼
Ideas I'm exploring with my ZK:
I'm looking at the high switching costs of how I've set up my ZK. It seems I've boxed myself in with some basic decisions about file naming and linking conventions.
Young Adult Literature as a genre ripe for literary criticism.
Uni Class has started, so I'm finding most of my thinking is slanted toward Young Adult Literature.
Things I'm reading:
Gratz, Alan. Refugee. 2017.
Tucci, Stanley. Taste: my life through food. 2021.
Gantos, Jack. Dead end in Norvelt. 2013.
Picard, Max. The world of silence. 1948.
Music I'm listening to:
House Music to zettelkast with.
Passenger
★★★★★
The "My rolling ten-day zettel production" is produced by a script for attachment to my daily journaling template. I do my journaling in Bear to keep personal journaling separate from my knowledge work.
Let me know if you would like to discuss any of these notes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When typing up some long-form text for entry into a website, I'll sometimes do it first in Org mode and then once I'm happy with it I'll copy-paste it into whatever I'm using. 
 However, one issue is that of <NEWLINE>.
 On the one hand, web forms often want to handle line wrapping, and so it wants the user to insert <NEWLINE> characters only if really necessary; e.g. for between paragraphs, list items, and so on.
 But on the other hand, I have Org set up to auto-fill text input (and I'll also regularly give it a hand in that using M-q to run org-fill-paragraph), so I end up with <NEWLINE> characters all over the place.
 Now obviously I could just turn off emacs and Org's auto-fill for the purpose of these situations. But I don't want that. I actually *want* the Org text formatted with the auto-fills, just as it would be if I wasn't creating something for input on the web.
 So, is there a simple way (maybe using export? ) to have the newlines that are not needed (I'm thinking it's only newlines within a paragraph) replaced with what is almost certainly going to be a simple inter-word space? Note , though, that it isn't just going to be the newline that needs to go, but also any following indenting whitespace characters used to correctly position the next piece of text.
 For example, I'd like to have this:
  1. A line of text 2. Another line of text but this one is long enough to need to be wrapped. And notice that this portion is indented.  converted to:  1. A line of text 2. Another line of text but this one is long enough to need to be wrapped. And notice that this portion is indented.

 Please test it and let us know at the Stack repository if you run into any trouble. If all goes well, we hope to release the final version in a couple of weeks.
 I would to like thank Théophile Batoz. His sustained efforts cleared a long-standing issue and Stack can now build packages with dependencies on public sub-libraries of other packages.
 Release notes:
  
After an upgrade from an earlier version of Stack, on first use only, Stack 2.15.1 may warn that it had trouble loading the CompilerPaths cache.
 The hash used as a key for Stack’s pre-compiled package cache has changed, following the dropping of support for Cabal versions older than 1.24.0.0.

https://github.com/skeeto/youtube-dl-emacs
 https://gitlab.com/tuedachu/ytdl
  
both of which seem to be semi-maintained based on presence of long out-standing PRs.
 From memory, I started with the first and switched to the second when the first stopped working with yt-dlp. Regardless, there are several new features I would like to add to my Emacs-based download workflow (ex: logging).
 If there is anyone who has strong feelings about merits and demerits of the two I would appreciate your input before I invest in extending/forking one.
 thx

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone, I've been trying for the past month or so to get Emacs working reliably and quickly on my High DPI linux machines, but have been struggling.
 Currently I am running into issues with a machine running Manjaro + GNOME (wayland) and the pgtk version of emacs 29.1. When I scale the frame to take up the entirety of my 4k display, I have noticeable input lag, likely in the 100s of ms. When I shrink the frame down, my input lag decreases significantly, and emacs feels snappy. The issue persists when I run emacs with emacs -q.
 At the moment I've resorted to running emacs 29.1 without pgtk, forcing it to run under XWayland. This causes emacs to render at a lower resolution to XWayland, resulting in blurry text when it's finally displayed on my monitor, but results in emacs staying snappy even at full screen.
 I've run into this issue across all my machines, across distros (namely Void, Arch, and Fedora), whenever I try to run Emacs full screen on a 4K monitor attached to a machine running Wayland. Switching to X isn't an option due to the excessive screen tearing that I get at high resolutions.
 Weirdly, compiling and running Emacs on my Windows work machine natively results in the best emacs experience I've had so far, with input feeling extremely snappy and fluid. I don't experience the scaling issues there. Emacs also is working fantastic on an old low resolution laptop that I have running Void with XFCE.
 I've tried adjusting the double buffering as mentioned in this post without success: https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/zgp6kw/gui_emacs_weird_the_bigger_the_frame_size_is_the/
 Any thoughts? Is this a thing that people are running into on high resolution displays with Wayland? Is XWayland the best bet right now?

I feel way more confident about my apps when built with Scala, they end up being a lot less buggy and generally easier to understand. My cofounder is used to Python, he’s been coding in Python for like 15 years (I have too) but I also have used JS and Scala in my career. Two jobs ago I only used Scala and my most recent job was only Python. The transition back to Python from Scala was so disappointing. I HATED it. Everything felt so sloppy and disorganized. 
 My co-founder has only ever used Python. He’s extremely resistant to learning Scala. he feels very certain we should be using Python for all of our backend services because it’s easier, there are more libraries and it will be easier to hire devs in the future. 
 Anyone have any advice or opinions on this? Is it unreasonable for me to continue to convince him to use Scala? Am I being too opinionated about what stack we should be using?

 I need to manage my contacts with an extensible tool. Availability is a must - they have to be sync-able on all my devices with ease. Ease of backing them up is also very important to me. Integration with Emacs mail clients is also very important. I don't use an Emacs mua at the moment, but I plan on using notmuch.
 I have come across this post on the subreddit. Right now, it seems to me like bbdb or ebdb are options that would suit my needs, but I have doubts. I know people in the Emacs community are very vocal about how great various features/packages are (and why everything is better in Emacs), but I haven't really found content on managing contacts with Emacs.
 Is there a general favorite of the community in regards to contact-management packages? How come nobody really talks about this? Is it better to do this outside of Emacs? Thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been using org mode for many years, pretty much since I started using emacs, and for all this time I've kept my notes in a single org file that grows as I add more notes.
 Recently I discovered denote, a young and excellent package to organize notes in files, and I have to say that I'm really enjoying it. However, it requires me to reorganize my long org file (which is good, after so many years growing out of control).
 I would like to ask, first of all, somebody with similar experiences, why did you decided to switch to denote? Or to stay with a long org file?
 The long org file works for me in a way that I simply come to the file and search for a particular word, so I can easily access all the results and choose the one I want. I don't even use tags, everything is organized in sectons using headers. How do you make that search easy in denote? I know that using keywords is the best but, assuming that sometimes you are not even 100% sure about the exact word that you need and you type in a few to try.
 On the other hand, small files work better for my mobile (where I sync my notes), specially with zettel notes app, which has similar organization than denote. However, I wonder if somebody has a good experience with a long org file with some particular app for android.
 I'm still trying to decide if switching to denote or staying with my long org file. Any comments would be appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been using org mode for many years, pretty much since I started using emacs, and for all this time I've kept my notes in a single org file that grows as I add more notes.
 Recently I discovered denote, a young and excellent package to organize notes in files, and I have to say that I'm really enjoying it. However, it requires me to reorganize my long org file (which is good, after so many years growing out of control).
 I would like to ask, first of all, somebody with similar experiences, why did you decided to switch to denote? Or to stay with a long org file?
 The long org file works for me in a way that I simply come to the file and search for a particular word, so I can easily access all the results and choose the one I want. I don't even use tags, everything is organized in sectons using headers. How do you make that search easy in denote? I know that using keywords is the best but, assuming that sometimes you are not even 100% sure about the exact word that you need and you type in a few to try.
 On the other hand, small files work better for my mobile (where I sync my notes), specially with zettel notes app, which has similar organization than denote. However, I wonder if somebody has a good experience with a long org file with some particular app for android.
 I'm still trying to decide if switching to denote or staying with my long org file. Any comments would be appreciated.

 Is there a simple clean way to do nested record field update without lens? I wonder when OverloadedRecordDot will start to actually work (without the unwieldy requirement for RebindableSyntax).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I'm new to both Emacs and Reddit, so bear with me if I'm not doing this right. I've been using org-mode for note-taking, and I'm also learning e lisp introduction guide in Emacs, I'm trying to set up org-indent-mode to enable when I'm in normal mode and disable when I'm in insert mode. So I could read my note more clearly.
 I came across a code snippet on EmacsWiki that changes the mode line color based on the Evil state, but I'm having trouble understanding and adapting it for org-indent-mode. 
 So I wrote this code to achieve this
 (defun escape () "Change org-indent-mode based on evil state" (interactive) (if (evil-normal-state-p) (org-indent-mode 1) (org-indent-mode -1))) (add-hook 'org-mode-hook 'escape) 
 It work when I type M-x escape , I know the problem but i don't know to solve it, the problem i think is it is checking for first time and but not observing the change in state.
 I really appreciate any help 💖

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been using Org for repeating meeting notes for several years. My workflow
 is something like:
  
for each person I regularly meet I have a top level bullet.
 every time I have a meeting with that person, I find the top level bullet, and create a new child bullet, with the date of the meeting and the topic - I have two usual topica, being "catch up" and"review".
 under that new bullet I type my notes from the meeting. These are usually transcribed from paper notes I make during the meeting.
  
E.g
 * Ann Onymous
 ** <2023-08-22 Thu> catchup
 Ann is having fun working on cold-fusion. Needs new peanut butter and
 mousetraps. Says warm weather is interfering with correct function of
 reverse osmosis proton macerator.
 Needs me to sort out climate and mousetraps.
 ** <2023-09-20 Wed> catchup
 new mousetraps have made life better. Climate still not good enough...
 ​
 Having watched (in bits, over a week or two admiteddly) Prot's 'tube explanations, and done a basic installation of Denote, I want to make it work for my note taking needs. I'm in no way wedded to the arrangement shown above. I'd happily have a file per person. But I think Denote wants me to have a file per meeting. But for me, a big part of the value is continuity. I.e. being able to see what happened in previous meetings so I can be sure to follow up on actions, and keep a proxixmate record of outstanding actions and conclusions.
 I think this means that I might use Denote by having a file per meeting, with keywords like "talking_to_Ann_Onymous" and then use a dynamic block to gather the rolling textual status. By playing with the frontmatter I could include the date of each meeting. Further, I think I would use the signature fucntions to ensure that the notes are displayed in calendar order.
 Has someone else solved this kind of problem? Did you find a better way to handle this kind of note taking?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m wondering if there is some roadmap, or blog posts devoted to the future of the Scala language. I was looking through Rust's blog posts and the Rust team does an amazing job describing “what’s next” for the language. In addition to that, there are a lot of blog posts from core language contributors that also give a view on the language evolution which is pretty cool. I could not find any of that for Scala. I read periodically Scala Contributors but it’s more like the discussion of potential improvements and separate proposals. Before 3.3.0 it was stabilization and road to LTS. But now it’s not that clear. 
 It would be nice to have periodical blog posts related to the future of the language and the vision of language designers, a road map that is periodically updated. 
 Not the list of new features (we’re adding this because <lang X> has it), but why these features are important, how they will affect language, etc.

 So I'm setting up evil mode and so far it works pretty well for me. The only thing that doesn't really fit what I'm used to is actions that span multiple lines. The starting and ending lines are not included completely in this action but only from (and on the ending line up to) the position of the cursor. 
 If I had this text ([x] is the cursor position):
  This is[x] a test line Another line to test 
 and then do dj I would end up with this result
  This is line to test 
 I would expect it to just delete both lines. What do I need to configure to get the desired behaviour? The current behaviour is active for all commands that can span multiple lines like yank, delete and so on

Also, side question. Why don't more packages simply rebind existing (fundamental) functions instead of invent/make us bind new keys?
 I am exploring vertigo/consult (currently ivy/counsel user) and it striked me how friendly transition to vertgo was in terms of keys. I have to learn nothing new, all keys are intuitive. Vertigo simply remaps fundamental functions to vertigo functions. Screenshot - https://imgur.com/a/isc9iYv

 Right now, I'm in a situation (context in the end), in which I believe I need to store a function with its context in an MVar , but I can't seem to wrap my head around on how this should work.
 I came up with a simplified example of What i would like to achieve:
 {-# LANGUAGE TypeApplications #-} {-# LANGUAGE ScopedTypeVariables #-} {-# LANGUAGE ImpredicativeTypes #-} example :: IO () example = do let f :: forall a. Show a => IO (a -> String) f = pure show g :: IO (forall a. Show a => a -> String) g = pure show f' <- f @Int -- needs type application g' <- g -- doesnt compile pure () 
 I understand why f needs to be called with a type annotation, after all f :: forall a. Ctx a => function means that if i want to get function, I must first apply a typ…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Background to the problem.
 I use the GUI form designer on Lazarus which saves changes to the form to a text file and in manipulating the form elements, spurious changes are made that I don't want.
 For instance if a form is moved around the screen during the edits, the top and left positions of the form are saved to the file even if they are not relevant to the task. Adjusting the size of an element to gain access to some other elements also result in spurios changes.
 Is there some way to revert those changes from the Magit diff view and only commit those desired?
 I know how to stage and commit tht hunks I need but I also need to revert the unwanted uncommitted changes in the working copy.
 Logically I can commit only the changes I want and check the file out again to restore the unwanted changes back to their original setting, but that applies to files containing hunks I have no use for.
 BONUS INFO
 After a bit of searching around I have realized that in addition to Magit there are quite a few package that provide the same functionality, two of those I already have installed.
  
diff-hl
 git-undo
 git-gutter-plus
 git-gutter
  
Searching for stuff is difficult when you don't know or can't recollect the right terminology. All I had to do was to enter C-h f - hunk and their commands would have showed up.

 So without any recourse, since the variable is defined using 'defconst` as opposed to `defcustom' and `setq` wouldnt work - I had to patch the source in ox-latex.el as

 I hope this change is undone as it proved to be a source of my many miseries and many more that will have a rather rude awakening.

 There are languages which have CLI tooling to automate the dev+test loop. As an example from Rust there is: 
 cargo watch 
 which will watch the directory for file changes and automatically run tests when a file changes. 
 There are other languages/tools which don't have that sort of thing (or for which the tooling is just getting going). As an example, here's a much simplified version of what I do in the shell for Terraform: 
 while true; do fsnotifywait -r -e close_write . ; terraform plan && terraform apply -auto-approve ; sleep 2; done 
 There must be an Emacs package which combines the ability to watch a directory for changes and then automatically execute a pipeline like the above, yes? 
 NOTE: Emacs LSP is fine for fmt and lint in most cases I've encountered. Also, yes, there is better tooling for automated testing in TF now. Like I said, that loop is much simplified.
  
EDIT: Interestingly, here's what I eventually managed to get out of an LLM for non-elisp tools perhaps reachable via an Emacs package:
  
 Tool Name Language Written In Recursive Watch Support Config File Support in Work Directory Latest Release Date Emacs Package Available 
  
 inotify-tools C Yes No Sep 12, 2023 No 
  fswatch C++ Yes No Jul 1, 2023 No 
  Watchman C++ Yes Yes Jan 22, 2024 Yes (emacs-watchman) 
  entr C No No Not available No 
  nodemon JavaScript Yes Yes Jan 16, 2024 No 
  Git Hooks Various (Shell, Python, etc.) Not Applicable Yes (via scripts) Not applicable Not directly, but can be used with Emacs 
  watchexec Rust Yes No Jan 5, 2024 No

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of orgs big strengths is its ability to emit code. I use org-tangle for my literate emacs config, org-export for producing PDFs and HTML, and a variation of org-export MD for producing my Hugo blog posts. But I am unconfident about when org will skip lines. Is my understanding correct?
  
 It seems that timestamps, including inactive timestamps, and DEADLINE and SCHEDULED are ALWAYS output. I wish this weren't so.
  When tangling, COMMENT on a heading (shortcut key #) is skipped. I don't know if this omits things from org-agenda.
  When marked with :ARCHIVE:, lines are skipped in org-agenda. I use this for optimizing long repeating sequences so that I only have one chunk (month, or school semester) at a time.
  DEADLINES can have their visibility shortened with syntax like <span class="timestamp-wrapper"><span class="timestamp"><2024-01-25 Thu -2d></span></span>; however, the same seems to break stuff if put into SCHEDULED instead.
 
Traditional syntax commenting with literal =# = at line start in an org file omits from all of the above, I think. But I'm not sure.
 Is this as confusing as I see, or is there a unifying principle here?

A look under GHC’s hood: desugaring linear types by Arnaud Spiwack
I thought I’d take the opportunity to discuss some of GHC’s inner workings and how they explain some of the features of linear types in Haskell. We’ll be discussing a frequently asked question: why can’t Ur be a newtype? And some new questions such as: why must linear let-bindings have a !?

 Here is the beginning of the README after checking out the emacs-29 branch:

I entered the path ~/Documents/projects, the first time I ran it, it actually did something, took about 10 seconds. It probably indexed those projects. But if I try to switch projects, no projects show.
 I'm still quite new to Emacs, so I attempted to run the function in my config.
 (setq org-directory "~/org/" projectile-project-search-path '("~/Documents/projects/")) 
 But it also doesn't work...
 As I said, still quite new to Emacs, so I don't know how to check for Error messages, the *Messages* buffer is empty tho.

 What i want to achieve is to have main font for buffer around height 11-12, and org tables height 10.
 Problem right now org table face seem to take minimal line height from main font seize disregarding their font size. So they are a bit heigher than they should be.
 Screenshots:
 main font 10, org table face 10 https://imgur.com/a/hntoqNS (rows are ideal height)
 main font 10.5, org table face 10 https://imgur.com/a/qvxOeI9 (rows are a bit heigher than optimal)
 main font 30, org table face 10 https://imgur.com/a/8u3PAWL (rows ... you can tell :) there is no extra linese here - it's a 3 row table)
 Is this how it supposed to work, or did i mess something up? I swear before update to emacs 29 / org 9.6.6 rows had line height 10 (not 10.5) with my normal set up of main font 10.5. But maybe it was always like this...

 ``` data Pattern = Var String | Fn String [Pattern]
 data Rule = Rule Pattern Pattern
 -- (f ?a 1) ==> (g ?a) rule = Rule (Fn "f" [Var "a", Fn "1" []]) (Fn "g" [Var "a"]) -- Invalid rule: (f ?a 1) ==> (g ?b) invalidRule = Rule (Fn "f" [Var "a", Fn "1" []]) (Fn "g" [Var "b"]) ```
 Informally, if an expressions "matches" the LHS, this binds each pattern variable to an expression, and then we substitute these into the RHS.
 The problem is that this representation doesn't prevent me from writing invalid rules. In particular, I'd like to prevent variable binding issues: I'd like to enforce that all pattern variables that appear on the right hand side must appear on the left hand side. (It's fine for variables to appear multiple times in a pattern.) Is there a way to do this? Maybe with some HOAS approach?

 My major mode is typescript-ts-mode.
 I'd like to have "css-ts-mode" inside the space delimited by `...` (backticks). With the exception of ${ ... }, which is Javascript/Typescript (also typescript-ts-mode).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I'm relatively new to Emacs (28) and spent the holidays configuring it to be a nice environment for machine learning applications and writing Latex/org-mode markup. Loving it so far.
 However, one thing I wish I could change is the major modes for C, C++, Python, and Shell languages. I tend to get really overwhelmed by how many options are provided because of the maturity of these languages and it's hard for me to really learn their features even with which-key installed. Another sticking point is that they sometimes overwrite custom keybinds that I use frequently, especially c-mode.
 Is there such a thing as a general purpose coding major mode that just provides syntax highlighting with tree-sitter, code folding, and Eldoc info for each language? Maybe this is something that would be easy to hack up by extending prog-mode with only those features?
 Barring that, is there a way to help simplify the major modes like not overriding my global keymap? I have a difficult time with mental context switching and want to only need to think about my basic keybinds and org stuff.

I am creating a growing list of the benefits of the Zettelkasten Method. This is in itself neither new nor exciting, since it would be a repetition of the marketing babble already existing in the domain of knowledge management.
My take will be to highlight the steps of the causal mechanism how the benefit is created. There is a lot of talk about that the Zettelkasten gives you a certain set of benefits, sometimes a blurry idea of the how. There is a lack of explicitness and precision. This is what I am going for.
So, my request is for you: Give me every benefit you can think of. Being it a benefit that you want to be justified or rejected. Being it a benefit that you experienced. Being a benefit that other's claim and you are not sure about.
GIVE ME EVERYTHING!]]></summary>

I've tried multi-isearch-buffers, but it doesn't search when I press RET, seems buggy.
 My current method is:
  
Switch to the second buffer.
 Perform an I-search.
 Switch back to the first buffer to continue writing.
 Repeat as needed.
  
This workflow feels cumbersome. Does anyone have suggestions for a more efficient approach?

Somehow after a lot of effort, I made it work but then I was looking at this article: https://www.lightbend.com/akka/license-faq which made my heart skip a beat. Since Akka had super powerful capabilities, especially for concurrent apps is this end for scala? Are the older functionalities like Akka streaming and all still under Apache 2.0 or they would also be affected by this? Any alternatives for all this?
 I know what Akka is requesting makes sense but I can't convince my business owners to get one license. They are instead insisting me to migrate to some other microservice or framework. :/

 is it not possible to store strings with newlines as the values of file-local variables? The elisp manual makes no mention of this limitation in the file-local vars section -- perhaps I missed something?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, I'm having trouble installing lsp-java on Mac. Installing the package itself is easy; however, installing the `jdtls` lsp is proving to be difficult. 
 Since it is on a work laptop, I cannot provide log messages. My first issue was when the script that LSP runs to install jdtls failed to install due to cert issues. I was able to fix those, but I ran into error `java.security.InvalidAlgorithmParameterException: the trustAnchors parameter must be non-empty`. I tried fixing the cert store, but no luck.
 The next thing I tried was doing `brew install jdtls`. I tried setting `lsp-java-server-install-dir` to the install location of the jdtls binary; however, that also did not work. For some reason, LSP cannot find the `jdtls` in my path, even though it's available globally on my system. FWIW, I am using package exec-path-from-shell, and it's properly configured (other packages that depend on external tools work just fine). 
 I was wondering if anyone has had any luck getting lsp-java to work on Mac, especially if you went the `brew install jdtls` route. Thanks in advance!

 Installation
 Use the Melpa Emacs Lisp archive to install this as a regular package:
 ```lisp (package-install 'ert-results)
 (require 'ert-results) ```
 or install it directly from the Github archive above as it is a single file code library.
 ert-results.el Rationale
 Within an interactive Emacs session, if ert is called with a regular expression selector argument that matches to multiple test names, all such tests are run, but only a summary line of output is displayed for all passing tests. Thus, the names of the passing matched tests are not displayed. Presently, within the ert output buffer, you must press {j} on each individual test summary result to display and jump to the test name and have its status spelled out.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey fellow Haskellers,
 I hope you're all doing well. I'm currently a chemical engineer working in scientific software development, and from a couple of months ago I've been diving into Haskell. It sparkled the desire to eventually transition to a job where I can use this fantastic language on a daily basis.
 I've gone through a few Haskell books and even tackled some challenges like Advent of Code 2023, which was a great experience. However, as I start thinking about applying Haskell to real-world problems, I find myself lacking the confidence I need to navigate the complexities that may arise.
 For those of you who have made a similar learning journey or have experience working with Haskell professionally, I'd love to hear your advice on how to bridge the gap from solving algorithmic challenges to confidently handling real-world projects. Are there specific resources, projects, or practices that you found particularly helpful in your journey?
 I appreciate any words of wisdom you can share with me as I go on this exciting but challenging journey. Thanks in advance for your support!

 I have a config for which-key in my keybindings, intended to show a minibuffer when hitting the <leader key> + <some key>. For example:

 When I run (SPC + "b p") the command works just fine (as all the others combinations of b + ...)
 However, when I hit only (SPC + b) It does nothing, and I get the following message:
 Error running timer 'which-key--update': (void-function-which-key-order-alpha) 
 I already tried updating the package via elpaca-manager (elpaca is my pkg manager) but It seems to bu already up to date.
 Does anyone know how to solve this issue?
 Thanks a lot in advance!

Should I expect package incompatibility? I am using a lot of MELPA packages!
 What version better to use? From PPA or Snap?
 Both repositories offer 29.1, not 29.2. Should I wait for 29.2?
 What is the easiest way to migrate all my installed packages?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am looking for advice on how to handle use cases where a repeating task has to be temporarily rescheduled and then reset back to its normal timestamp. 
 For example, say I have a repeating task that occurs once a month on the 17th. A month comes up where I need to reschedule this task to the 18th. Once the task is complete, I then have to remember that it usually occurs on the 17th and manually set it back to that date. 
 A similar issue comes up when I have to change just the time of day of daily task while organizing my day. I then have to remember to change the date back at the end of the day. 
 Manually resetting daily tasks back to their normal time of day is a particularly tedious chore, because I have quite a few of them and their times are fairly intricate. 
 Is there a less manual way to handle these use cases? Ideally, I would like the tasks to be set back to their normal time slots automatically.

I'm considering giving it a go, but converting my notes and porting the custom stuff I made for roam over the years would take considerable effort. Problem is, that the implementation being more elegant, doesn't necessarily make something more useful in practice. Can someone who used both roam and denote give me a practical sales pitch?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 it's a bit of an open-ended question I guess.
 Is this just me or org feels very unfriendly to build on top of? Is there a public API I could use to perform some org-related actions?
 Example:
 I don't like the way todo items in the agenda are displayed and the configuration is pretty poor (I believe you can only configure the prefix and even that isn't that powerful). So I figured I should just write my own view for todo items. Well, I couldnt find any documentation for that. I figured the only way is to go through the source code (which is a huge blob of a file that I'm not sure how to navigate efficiently) and hack my way into it (which may end up being incompatible with future versionsk break features, etc)
 Another example:
 I'd like to collect some data across all my org files. I don't see any "org" way to grab all my files, convert them to some sort of objects, and grab some data I need. The closest I found is the Element API which seems to do with parsing org files and I'm not even sure that's an official package.

 FWIW, here's what I've tried so far.
 I had hoped that the Special Property, TIMESTAMP_IA would give me what I'm after, but I can't get that to work. So far I've tried:
  
Relying on the fact that I usually clock-in when capturing, and so the datum I want is almost always already there for me, in the form of the start time for the earliest clock entry. But TIMESTAMP_IA appears to ignore timestamps that are part of clock entries. So this is no use.
 Having my capture templates create a property drawer into which gets inserted a new property called CREATED, with value of %u. That does allow me to see the value in column view, but it is under %CREATED, not under %TIMESTAMP_IA.
 Same as #3, but instead of having the CREATED property inserted into the property drawer, insert it into my logbook drawer. That does let me see the value under %TIMESTAMP_IA but bizarrely it then does not display it under %CREATED. 
  
So either #2 or #3 could work, but I consider them to be non-ideal. 
 With #2, I don't get to use the built-inTIMESTAMP_IA which I get the feeling is really intended for the kind of thing I'm trying to do. 
 And while with #3, I do get to use TIMESTAMP_IA, it is at the expense of having to insert my CREATED property into a non-property drawer, which something in the back of my mind says is ill-advised. 
 And of course with both #2 and #3, unnecessary duplication is involved since, as I said, the date I want is already staring me in the face in the starting stamp of the first clock entry. Having to go around creating properties for the sole purpose of duplicating and making available an otherwise unavailable variable is, well, naff.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[EDIT: This has now been solved, see https://discourse.haskell.org/t/haskell-wlroots-bindings/8426/45.
 (This is a repost of a Discourse post in the hopes of getting more responses. This issue is actively impacting my ability to maintain wlhs, so I would appreciate any ideas!)
 For the past few weeks, I and others have been developing wlhs, a set of Haskell bindings to libwayland and wlroots. For the most part, development on my side has run fairly smoothly.
 However, when I tried to build wlhs two days ago, I received the following error:
 $ cabal build Resolving dependencies... Error: cabal: Could not resolve dependencies: [__0] next goal: wlhs-bindings (user goal) [__0] rejecting: wlhs-bindings-0.1.0 (conflict: pkg-config package wayland-server-any, not found in the pkg-config database) [__0] fail (backjumping, conflict set: wlhs-bindings) After searching the rest of the dependency tree exhaustively, these were the goals I've had most trouble fulfilling: wlhs-bindings 
 Despite the error message saying that wayland-server is ‘not found in the pkg-config database’, it clearly is present on my system:
 $ pkg-config --modversion wayland-server 1.22.0 
 What makes this strange is how suddenly it stopped working. Two days ago, I couldn’t build wlhs; the day before, I could. (Or at least, I have no memory of it failing before that.) Does anyone have any ideas around how to fix this problem?
 For reference, I’m using pkgconf-2.1.0. (Installed on December 7, so that hasn’t changed recently.) I have also tested several Cabal versions: it fails with 3.10.2.1 and 3.10.1.0, as well as current HEAD. It does succeed with cabal-3.6.2.0, but that version is unusable for me as it can’t handle my custom Setup.hs. I’m running EndeavourOS, which is a variant of Arch Linux.

In this blog post, we explain both concepts, as well as their benefits and limitations compared to the monolithic architecture.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I plan to work on a series of demos of more complicated LLM-based editing with Emacs, either more complicated because the interactions are more complicated, or because they just require a bit more complicated types of processing.
 The first is a demo of asking an LLM to improve text. The ellama package already does this, but what this adds is the ability to see a diff, ask for further changes (in context of the previous changes) and accept the diff.
 My goal is to produce a bunch of these demos and figure out the necessary library functions to do these things in a clean, consistent, and useful way. Perhaps I'd add them to the `llm` package, perhaps it might require a new package. In emacs-devel@ I wrote up details, including code pointers and a list of interesting questions I'm thinking about. I'm posting this here as well because I think there's interest on what I'm demoing, and I'd appreciate feedback on it, especially from a user perspective.

 Hi I am implementing a small parser to learn type level (programming) Haskell.
 I have the following data types for:
 data Exp = Num Int | Plus Exp Exp
 data SExp = Atom Type | L [SExp]
 And I want a function that does the following:
 parse :: SExp -> Exp 
 parse (Atom s) = if typeOf s == Int then Num s else _
 I understand the existing of function typeOf. But is there a way to do this equality without passing an actual value (i.e. typeOf s == typeOf 1 or typeOf s == typeOf 'c'). Things that come to mind, but don't know how to implement, is to use type families since one can they map types to types. Apologies in advance for any nonsensical things on this post.

 At first, I used the following code:
 (set-fontset-font "fontset-startup" 'latin (font-spec :family "Noto Sans Mono" :size 24))
 I start Emacs by typing Emacs in the terminal, and it worked fine.
 But when I run emacs --daemon, it gives me the following error:
 error: Fontset ‘fontset-startup’ does not exist
 So I tried to set fonset-default. but strangely, the fonts I set for latin are always overwritten (whereas the fonts I set for han don't have this problem).
 I know I can set fonts using set-face-attribute etc, but they can't set multiple fonts like fontset can. So I decided to come to Reddit to try and ask for help after I couldn't find a solution that worked for me in Google.
 Also attached is my runtime environment:
  
KDE Plasma 5.27.10 with wayland(kwin)

 My company is currently using Lagom framework to deliver a technical solution with the following properties.

Our domain is your typical ecommerce ecosystem with our entities defined as things you would expect (e.g product, order, shipment).
 Lagom is approaching EOL on July 1, 2024. Therefore, we are looking for some alternatives that we can potentially migrate to. Lightbend suggest to use Kalix or pure Akka. However with the recent changes to their licensing we perhaps do not want to tightly couple ourselves to Lightbend products going forward.
 There's a million questions I could ask here but I guess the most pertinent one is at a high level/first steps, how should our team approach this? Here are some thoughts I …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I would like Org mode to behave like outline-mode with reveal-mode (a minor mode) turned on. That is, when I move into hidden text (shown by an ellipses), all such text is auto-expanded. Then when point moves out of a node that was auto-expanded, it collapses back to the way it was.
 I know org-fold has all sorts of context exposure capability and settings but I can't seem to get any behavior like this from looking at the documentation. I want simple, automatic behavior. Yes, it is okay if it just expands all levels drawers, etc. that are hidden based on movement of point.
 Even better would be if Org mode were made compatible with reveal.el. Then one could simply enable the global version of that minor mode and have this behavior in all of your org files, as exists now for other outlining modes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently I realized an analogy that helped me - That the way Haskell does IO is the same way React does UI. Instead of doing the IO (or building the UI), we instead write a program that generates the program that does the IO (or builds the UI).
 Writing it down this way makes it sound fancy and meta, but it's a simple, almost obvious, connection really, maybe I'm not using the right words. I also tried doing a longer exposition on this here (there I also show how React, SwiftUI and Flutter have the same gene).

This isn't advocacy--it's an attempt to describe what my Zettelkasten has become so far, or rather, what it can and cannot do. It seems impervious to market forces and cannot interact with them. It wants to negate virtually every front-page headline in the paper of record and other carefully edited organs of filtered pablum. Other than that, there is no interaction. Attempts to optimize it only make it worse and more convoluted than otherwise. I wouldn't call it a wellspring of ideas--more like a trapped aquifer.
This seems to have happened after switching ID formats at least twice and adding an alphabetic backlink index. Any effort to describe it is at least as long as the Zettelkasten itself.]]></summary>

 Error in ~/.gnus: smtpmail-smtp-server In my .gnus file, it's exactly as provided by my email provider. My .gnus is as follows:

 Does anyone know what's going on with it? I've been busting some sweat over it for the past 3 hours |:

 Edit: I've been able to get the rmail client in Emacs (M-x mail) to send mail but am having trouble configuring the .gnus file.
 Second edit: I've reached a solution. I ended up simplifying my .gnu file to only contain my mail address, name, smtp default server, and the port.

 Every few years I have the need to parse XML, I find that the top results on Google when I search for Haskell libraries to deal with XML are packages that have not been updated in a while, and the situation never improves.
 This is hard, so I'm not surprised that some authors have given up on updating their libraries. But XML is still widely used.
 I would not mind it if there was some coordinated effort towards cleaning and updating of XML libraries.

 That post is 3 years old, so posing also as a new entry in case it's useful to anybody (and to gather feedback):
 This creates a new keyword extension for use-package, :mark-selected t:
 ``emacs-lisp ;;;; use-package :mark-selected ;; Make it possible to kinda managepackage-selected-packages' from ;; use-package by adding `:mark-selected' as a keyword.. (require 'use-package) (defun use-package-normalize/:mark-selected (_name keyword args) (use-package-only-one (symbol-name keyword) args #'(lambda (_label arg) (or arg nil))))
 (defun use-package-handler/:mark-selected (name _keyword arg rest state) (let ((body (use-package-process-keywords name rest state))) (if arg (package--update-selected-packages `(,name) '())) body))
 (add-to-list 'use-package-keywords :mark-selected t) ```
 You can then do:
 emacs-lisp (use-package no-littering :mark-selected t :config (no-littering-theme-backups) (setq custom-file (no-littering-expand-etc-file-name "custom.el"))) 
 And your package-selected-packages will have this package!

 I noticed that (almost) all "special" modes derive from special-mode which provide such a key-bind among others.
 So I defined a minor mode to reuse these keybinds in read-only-mode:
 https://gitlab.com/Thaodan/emacs.d-lisp/-/blob/master/simple-ext.el?ref_type=heads#L14
 The mode can be activated similar to other minor modes like shown below (when using use-package).
  (use-package read-only :init (require 'simple-ext) :hook ((read-only-mode . special-keymap-mode))) 
 The mode made is much more convenient for me to work with files which are read-only.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apologies if this is the wrong place for this. There is no beorg subreddit, and I can only image that this is the only place on reddit where there would be a decent number of beorg users.
 I have had some issues on beorg when it comes to connecting to my NAS server via WebDAV so I can sync with my .org files on there. No matter what I do, it seems, I get the following error message:
 'Sync could not be completed. A list of your files couldn't be downloaded from your server. Check that your WebDAV server URL, username and password are correct.'
 I have entered the URL, username, and password correctly, as I have been able to connect using other devices and services. I am confident this is not the issue.
 Some of the (log-contents) mention an SSL error, so I thought the issue might be with the certificate. But since I have managed to use WebDAV with other devices and services, and since I have tried logging in while toggling the 'Allow untrusted certificate', I am not so sure it is a certificate issue.
 I have tried every kind of URL, folder path, and I just can't understand why it isn't working. The settings on my NAS don't seem to be the issue either. I have gone over them, and, as mentioned, managed to connect with many other devices and services.
 My usual URL is something like this:
 https://[DDNS hostname].synology.me/webdav
 I have also tried the following:
 https://[DDNS hostname].synology.me/webdav
 https://[DDNS hostname].synology.me/webdav/[path to my .org folder]
 https://[DDNS hostname].synology.me/dav
 https://[DDNS hostname].synology.me/dav/[path to my .org folder]
 https://[DDNS hostname].synology.me:5006
 https://[DDNS hostname].synology.me:5005
 I have tried using http and smb as well. I have also tried using NAS quick connect and using the external IP address of the NAS. Port-forwarding is correctly configured on my router.
 I just can't hack it.
 Any ideas or suggestions would be much appreciated! Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[New to Emacs and building my own configuration from scratch. I am impressed with the approach used in the rougier/nano-emacs and would like to implement. 
 The readme is easy enough to follow, but the existence of more recent repos for individual submodules has me second guessing myself. The following repos have been updated more recently than rougier/nano-emacs: 
  
 rougier/nano-modeline
 rougier/nano-agenda
 rougier/nano-vertico
  
This leaves me wondering, for example, whether I should be using nano-modeline.el from rougier/nano-emacs (last updated three years ago), or from the rougier/nano-modeline (last updated yesterday) . 
 ​
 For those that use nano-emacs, what is the approach you recommend?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, feel free to guide me out but I have a strong feeling Haskellers already have this figured out.
 I'm a python programmer coming from research background. I fell in love with programming and functional programming always had this allure for me. I have read quite a bit on functional programming, Bartoz Milewskis "Category theory for programmers" and doing the haskell.mooc.fi
 To learn the things actually, I started writing a simplified version of card game Dominion with python and trying to use pseudo-Haskell approach. Why? I'm more fluent in python for now (especially IO) and a game like Dominion is inherently stateful so I thought this would be a good practice.
 I have record (dataclass in python) called playerState which contains deck, hand, discarcd_pile i.e. things that model individual player. For now, I have a gameState that contains a list of playerStates and central_supply that is global for all players.
 All card effects are pure, often partial functions effect::playerState, someArg->playerState. For example draw::playerState -> num_cards -> playerState. Here is an example of a card that draws one card and gains one card: gainDraw = Card( name="Gain Victory point and draw 1 card", card_type="Action", cost=2, effects=[gain victoryCard, draw 1], ). Now the "cool part" is that I have a function play_card:: playerState -> Card -> playerState that simply composes all effects of a card to one single composite function and applies it to playerState. Playing one card is then one elegant transition from state1 to state2 with no intermediary assigments etc. So far so good.
 Now the problem: some card effects modify also the global gameState and not just fields in playerState. Essentially I have globalState containing localStates. What is a common solution in Haskell or in functional paradigm in general to handle nested states? A whole different architecture, lifting types? You can be harsh and say that my domain(ion, sorry had to) modeling is all wrong.

 Personally, huge pre-configured solutions (like lazyvim or spacemacs) are too complicated for me. As a beginner, I want to do things at a relatively raw level, which is more comfortable because I don't feel blindly accepting things where I often confuse different parts and keep doing things the wrong way, and that blindness in my experience often prevents me from using a tool in the most efficient way (plus spacemacs' startup time is too long :( on my already not so powerful computer).
 So I liked it once I found the repo of Ashton. I tried the simplest version from the repository (called "early-init.el") and followed its comments carefully. Useful things I found in this file include
  
how to install packages
 how to change the background colour (I didn't do though)
 Others like font face where the repository owner left it blank, but the related function names are there to guide me.
  
​
 --------
 Totally unrelated, the Emacs plugins have a very different flavour compared to their counterparts in Neovim/vim. They are structured quite differently. This is how I feel as someone who has tried to learn Vim for a while. (The latter's approach requires a degree of understanding of "the editor itself" such text object)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey there, I'm experimenting more with Org-roam and am trying to figure out some of the best practices before committing too much on one path. Currently, I've set up a few bigger .org files such as emacs and orgmode that link to each other, but in each I have a bunch of useful links. I've seen some tutorials suggesting that links and thoughts should be in very small individual .org files, but that seems convoluted and time-consuming. 
 Secondly, I'm wondering how much info I really want to add from areas that might not be so related. Do I really want to mesh together my cooking knowledge base with my computer focused information pools? Will things get convoluted down the line?
 I've been having a little trouble finding actual workflows. A lot of tutorials on setting things up, but I'd like to see more of Org-roam in action. I think I'm missing some of the bigger picture philosophy in relation to org-mode.
 How do you all use it? Do you have any useful media I can read or watch?
 Thanks for your time!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a function that I use inside of a larger function to list all org-roam notes with the "Project" tag. These functions are defined in a .el file that is called from my init.el file. For some reason, when I eval the defun blocks in that file, the function fails to recognize the argument I pass to it ("tagname"), but when I copy the code into my scratch buffer and evaluate it there, it suddenly works. I am also able to add the line (defvar tagline "Project") and it works in that case as well.
 (defun cj/org-roam-filter-by-tag (tagname) (lambda (node) (member tagname (org-roam-node-tags node)))) (defun cj/org-roam-find-project () (interactive) ;; Select file to open, creating if necessary (org-roam-node-find nil nil (cj/org-roam-filter-by-tag "Project") nil :templates '(("p" "project" plain "* Goal\n\n%?\n\n* Inbox\n\n** TODO Add initial tasks\n\n" :if-new (file+head "%<%Y%m%d%H%M%S>-${slug}.org" "#+title: ${title}\n#+category: ${title}\n#+filetags: Project") :unnarrowed t)))) 
 Essentially, the issue I'm having is I start emacs/load my init file, these functions are defined, and I run cj/org-roam-filter-by-tag. I get the error (void-variable tagname), which seems to come from the lambda function. At this point, if I run (cj/org-roam-filter-by-tag "Project"), it evaluates to (lambda (node) (member tagname (progn (or ... ...) (aref node 16)))), which I can then fix be either copying the (cj/org-roam-filter-by-tag) function to the scratch buffer and evaluating it there, or evaluating (defvar tagname "Project"). 
 This code is taken almost exclusively from system crafters, and I don't really understand the lambda function and what it does. As far as I can tell this seems to be some sort of scoping issue, but since I'm directly calling the function with "Project" as an argument, I don't see why I'm getting the "void-variable" error. 
 I'm a little lost with this issue, and I'd appreciate any help. Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As the title says, is it possible to use emacs-jupyter with Databricks?
 A typical workflow for me involves writing a conversational-style org file in Emacs as I puzzle through how to get the data I need out of Databricks tables in an accompanying browser window:
  
Issue Spark SQL query in browser window.
 Download result set as CSV.
 Open CSV file in Emacs.
 Save the entire file contents to the kill ring.
 Paste it into my org file.
 Select the table and run org-table-create-or-convert-from-region (C-c |).
  
I could streamline steps 3-6 with a homebrew command, but I am aching to do this kind of exploration org-babel style, just pressing C-c C-c to run the query and seeing the results right there in the org file.
 The emacs-jupyter Github page mentions a command jupyter-connect-repl which connects to an existing kernel, which seems to be what I'd need, if, as I suppose, a notebook I run on the Databricks web interface is backed by a kernel. (Although I don't know for sure; introductory-level descriptions of the various components seems to be pretty scarce.) The Github page links to something called a kernel's connection file, a JSON file with fields like control_port, shell_port, etc, which I would need to supply. I've scoured the Databricks notebook interface and can't find a file like this offered anywhere. There is a tab called "Partner Connect" that offers "connection files" for many Databricks partner companies, but the ones I'm able to access don't contain the information emacs-jupyter seems to want. Some aren't even JSON.
 So, yeah. Any advice?

 Parser i seems to implement some distorted version of Monad
 I haven't come up with a definitive proof but on the surface level identity laws seems to hold. I'm not so sure about composition but my tests (albeit a small set) gave me affirmative results. 
 I get a sensible free implementation for fmap. However i failed to get a free implementation for join and apply which makes me suspicious that the composition law indeed does not hold. Instead of banging my head against the compiler i wanted to ask you where exactly the problem is

 For example, in the context of /home/user/my-project1, I want to setup this menu:
 <F5> t: Execute specific command 1. <F5> r: Execute specific command 2. <F5> k: Execute specific command 3. 
 In /home/user/my-project2, I want this other menu:
 <F5> a: Execute specific command 4. <F5> b: Execute specific command 5. <F5> h: Execute specific command 5. 
 I am flexible on the details. The only requirement is that this menu is configurable and specific to a given project. This menu should contain only the relevant commands for my project and should be accessible whenever default-directory is in that project (meaning accessible from dired, magit, any visited files in that project, etc.).
 What are the options?

 Around the release of 29.1 with tree-sitter, I chose to wholly re-write my config. I tossed almost everything I had, and pulled things back in piece-wise as I found I needed them. I also took the opportunity to add in a few things I had always heard great enthusiasm for (counsel, ivy, company, swiper to name a few).
 And now... I'm barely using any of the new stuff. Maybe I tried to add too much too quickly? How do others integrate all these truly useful packages into your daily flow?

 It'd have to be language sensitive. For example 'when' and 'let' have one arg before the body but 'save-excursion' has none. Wondering if anything already exists before I start trying to write it myself.

 This issue only persists on mituharu emacs macport.

 I need to be able to run python script with M-x function (so i can bind it to hotkey). So far i have this:
 (defun my/mysimplefunction () (interactive) (insert (shell-command-to-string "python mysimplefunction.py"))) 
 I have 2 problems with it:
 1, how to set default directory for script, or absolute path? Cause right now script works only if current buffer is in same directory as
 2, i don't need function output to be inserted in current buffer (it's script without output). Now it ouputs (error, etc) to current buffer. (It can ouput to "*messages", but it's not necessary)
 Update: Made it work with
 (defun my/mysimplefunction () (interactive) (shell-command-to-string "python /AbsolutePath/mysimplefunction.py")) 
 Won't delete the thread in case it will be helpful to someone with same question in future.

 Can it detect some changes to the parent window and user set-frame-size to adjust itself to match? Or perhaps set scroll bars if the parent size shrinks below some preset levels?
 I just noticed that the command-line-args variable removes some of the command line arguments after they've been processed.
 Is there some way of retaining the original list? The --parent-id parameter seems to be removed after it has been processed.

 I started Haskell this week, and I'm completely in love. Compared to my previous languages (Python, Java, C++) Haskell is just utterly beautiful. I can't get enough of it.
 I'm finding the language difficult at times. Not because the language itself is difficult - it isn't - but for a few other reasons:
 1) Learning resources are far more limited than for other languages. Resources for learning on mobile, in particular, seem almost non-existent. Does anyone have any they'd recommend?
 2) When my code doesn't work, I find Haskell's error messages very hard to interpret. Does this get easier?
 3) Input/output seems trickier than elsewhere. Anyone have anything I can read that might make them click? I've been mainly solving Codewars problems so I can bypass my input/output block.

 I call (debug-on-entry #'cape-file) in ielm and then press TAB with my cursor over a string that is a prefix for a valid file name. I enter the debugger so I know cape-file is being called but it ends up returning nil. When I then press M-x and call cape-file interactively it also brings up the debugger but this time it completes the filename accurately. If anyone has any idea what's going on or knows how to fix this I would be very appreciative.

So far I'm largely filling it with ideas I've been turning over in my mind for a while rather than the product of new reading. I've come to the conclusion that these ideas should be sat on for a while before they turn into permanent notes and so a zettelkasten would be unsuitable for learning a new field or subfield, which would be better served by a sort of lab manual or similar (not being an academic, I don't particularly need to preserve citations). Like an accounting system that uses a memorandum sheet, a journal, and then a ledger, with the zettelkasten being analogous to the last.
I got into this from Scheper's book, but I'm not a purist and I found his approach a little too dogmatic. But what I don't recall from his book or Luhmann's zettelkasten is recording the date each card was written. I don't know if that information is useful, but I've been including it on each card.]]></summary>

I am writing a book on habit. I know, finally somebody is making an effort on writing about that topic. Here are my reasons:
The inspiration for writing the book was Atomic Habits. It is a very well written book. Written so well and concise that I didn't even need to barbell-methoding it. I just could process it right away. On the flip side, I can't recommend to read the book if you already read another of the popular books on habit, because the content was almost identical. This is one of the most critiques of the one-star-ratings: "Read X instead, same content but better". But I can't come up with a book that does what the current state of the collective knowledge requires: A book that actually makes an effort to give a complete picture. This is the gap I want to fill.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm a medical student. I currently use org mode for managing a task list and have quite enjoyed using it together with orgzly, termux running Emacs and beorg. I would really like to use org-roam for maintaining my notes in medicine however I find that there to be a few parts of my workflow that are stopping me from just using Emacs and orgmode:
  
When I go to placement, I often like to just use the computers that are there. These hospital computers as you can imagine are locked pretty securely and so its impractical for me to setup Emacs on these computers or run anything from a USB. I have previously used something web based like notion.so but the experience was far from satisfactory.
 I unfortunately fell into the trap of buying an iPad for medical school and I want to make the most use of it. I will ocassionally bring this to placement and would like to be also take notes on my iPad.
 I do often have to look or reference my notes while on my phone. So quick offline access to my notes synced through syncthing is ideal.
  
I am currently considering using obsidian.md which uses markdown files. I can then sync these files with my phone and iPad and use the obsidian apps on either device. On my own computer I am thinking of using Emacs with https://github.com/licht1stein/obsidian.el. On computers at placement I am considering having my org files in a private repo on gitlab or github and then using the built in text editor on thos platforms.
 My question therefore is: is there a better alternative for my workflow/use-case that mainly uses org mode files as opposed to using obsidian?
 EDIT: I am open to also using pandoc to convert org and md files as long as the process can be somewhat automated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of Haskell's arguably most important and interesting features is lazy evaluation.
 As a novice / intermediate (I started learning Haskell about a year ago and am really enjoying it!), I still can't explain the advantages of lazy evaluation in real world applications. 
 After a bit of duckduckgoing, the first benefit that is often mentioned is the ability to create infinite data structures. While that is certainly interesting and fun to work with, it feels somewhat gimmicky to me. As mentioned, I am a novice, so I wonder, are infinite data structures a feature you regularly use in real world applications, and are they important in these applications? By that I mean that they are clearly better to use in that position than code without the infinite data structure?
 Another benefit that is often mentioned is the possibility to define control structures in normal code. To my understanding, this is the case for many monad combinators such as when or replicateM, and so on. Again I wonder how relevant this is in real applications, as most programming languages suffice with a few basic control structures.
 Furthermore, it seems that the monadic control structures still require the do notation to be useful, which is not defined in normal code, and when defining control structures for a new type class (such as arrows), new syntax defined outside of normal code is still required, as arrows seem to have their own special variant of do notation.
 Finally, there seems to be a performance trade off with haskells lazy evaluation, as lazy evaluation inherently has overhead, but might avoid unnecessary calculations. I wonder if these unnecessary calculations could not be avoided by better programming?
 All in all, how useful is haskells lazy evaluation, and is it a feature that should be adopted by other (new) programming languages? Or maybe is that a question that is still being researched / explored?

 I have just switched doing my (hobbyist) Haskell dev on VSCode on Windows to VSCode on Windows / WSL:Ubuntu 20.04. After a full compile on both and doing a minor change I am seeing a 20X speed improvement in WSL vs running all the same cabal build under plain old Windows. This speed improvement is predictably cascading through to the tooling (HLS starting and making significant code changes, running GHCID) . 
 It feels like all the tooling has snapped to life with the switch to WSL.
 Needless to say I'll be sticking with WSL but I'm curious if this is a common experience for Windows users or if I'm an outlier on this one?

For some reason, typescript-ts-mode and tsx-ts-mode are not correctly highlighting function calls. Typescript-mode does correctly highlight them, but it doesn't parse TSX, so I was going to use tsx-ts-mode for .tsx and typescript-mode for .ts. I installed the grammar with treesit-install-language-grammar and added it to the auto-mode-alist with (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.tsx\\'" . tsx-ts-mode)), but this is what my syntax highlighting looks like:
 tsx-ts-mode: no function call highlighting
 typescript-mode: no jsx highlighting
 If anyone has encountered and fixed this problem I would greatly appreciate you telling me how you fixed it. Also, for some reason, tsx files force me to have 2 space indentation despite typescript-indent-level and tab-width both being 4. Any advice for how to fix this would also be greatly appreciated. Thank you very much!

I've got it working like I want it except that I have to M-x variable-pitch-mode every time to get it on... is there a way to make variable pitch mode the default? Would I need to use a hook to activate it every time I enter a buffer? I'd rather not make the proportional font my font for everything, but I'd like all text in "normal" text buffers to use this proportional font.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi Friends of Haskell,
 It is our pleasure to announce that ZuriHac 2024 will take place Saturday 8 June - Monday 10 June 2024 as a physical event at the Rapperswil-Jona campus of the OST Eastern Switzerland University of Applied Sciences.
 The focus of ZuriHac is being a community event and hackathon, but we will also have some exciting keynotes from Ningning Xie, Alex McLean, Ivan Perez and Mary Sheeran. In addition to that, there will be some more hands-on content: Well-Typed will host a workshop, Jesper Cockx will host an Agda track and Manuel Bärenz will host an FRP Track.
 We also welcome beginners or people unfamiliar to Haskell who are curious to learn more. Eliane Schmidli will teach a beginners workshop, and there will be many mentors from the Haskell Community happy to answer all your questions.
 Two days prior to ZuriHac, the Haskell Foundation and OST will organize a co-located 2-day Haskell Infrastructure Workshop. More details about that will be announced soon.
 You can find more information about the event and register at https://zurihac.info.
 The event is free for participants. This is only possible with the help of our generous supporters, who are currently:
  
The Haskell Foundation
 Jane Street
 OST Eastern Switzerland University of Applied Sciences
 Tweag
 Well-Typed
  
In case you would like to support ZuriHac, please get in touch with us.
 We hope to see you there! The Zurich Friends of Haskell

 Any line in a python file with a "red" eglot error in flycheck now gets greyed out, which to me is completely counterproductive to actually fixing the errors, since the code just gets harder to read. I've done some googling and can't find anything useful. Does anyone know what package might be causing this, and where I can switch it off? Thanks!

check/warn/error on line length
 align closing brackets/parens to the indentation of the opening bracket/paren
 align series of whatever (params mostly I suppose) to the indentation of the first one
 mirror spaces around closing brackets/parens to the opening. eg. if ( thing) becomes if ( thing )
 etc. basically providing localized syntax consistency rather than global
  
If nothing like this exists, would anyone be interested in it?

This is another installment of the What Are You Working On? thread. Add to this discussion by telling us about your zettelkasten journey. Share with us what you're learning. Sharing helps me and, hopefully, you, too. It helps me clarify my goals and visualize my thinking. And sometimes, a conversation sparks a magical moment where we can dive into an idea worth exploring. We'd love to hear more from you.  🫵🏼
Ideas I'm exploring with my ZK:
Knowledge work in public.
I'm exploring a method of changing the format of all my links so I can interact with software that uses the literal file name in the link.
I'm exploring how I'm using the YAML frontmatter. This is a part of the file that could be a rich source of knowledge.
Upping my writing chops. LEADERSHIP LAB: The Craft of Writing Effectively
Things I'm reading:
Tucci, Stanley. Taste: my life through food. 2021.
Gratz, Alan. Refugee. 2017.
Music I'm listening to:
Grandbrothers
Jessy J - Latin Saxophone
Halie Loren
Weathertunes
Stats
In my opinion, the generated numbers do not hold any specific meaning. They are just fun to create using my ZK's dataset. Feel free to interpret them however you wish. As Homer Simpson once said, "You can come up with statistics to prove anything. 40% of all people know that."

The "My rolling ten-day zettel production" is produced by a script for attachment to my daily journaling template. I do my journaling in Bear to keep personal journaling separate from my knowledge work.
Let me know if you would like to discuss any of these notes.

 Scala is known for its ability to model complex domains and DDD (Domain-Driven Design) is known for the same thing.
 Are there anything like that (https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-implement-domain-driven-design-ddd-in-golang-2e2139beb09d) but for Scala? I'm thinking of articles, videos, tutorials which contain simple introduction or step-by-step guides for implementing DDD with Scala.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi. I'm currently writing a bytecode interpreter for a programming language in Haskell. I've written most of it so far but the main problem is that the actually execution of a program is very slow, roughly 10x slower than Python. When profiling the execution of the program, I noticed that most of the time is being spent simply getting the next byte or incrementing the instruction pointer. These operations are simply changing an Int in a StateT monad. Is Haskell simply the wrong language for writing a backend VM or are there optimizations that can be done to improve the performance. I should mention that I'm already running with -O2. Thanks
 edit - added code:
 I'm adding what I hope is relevant parts of the code, but if I'm omitting something important, please let me know.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I would like to contribute my little story. I started using Emacs with the Spacemacs distro (great distro!). I used it for a year and realized that the amount of things to learn is much greater. I learned Vim keybindings, Spacemacs keybindings, modal editing. I also learned the concepts of Emacs, Org Mode, Magit. I realized that some things don't happen so quickly, and I also started to get tired of modal editing and only using the keyboard to perform actions. So, I decided to try vanilla Emacs. I noticed that the contents of the main menu, the button menu and the modeline change according to the position of the pointer, that is, the GUI presents the options in a contextual way. Now I can work effectively using the keyboard and mouse and receiving feedback from the interface regarding commands and key combinations that I always forget. And finally, I gave up on maintaining a configuration file (for now), I learned to use 'customize'. I'm really amazed at what you can do with absolutely no configuration initially! Some advice for beginners (I still am): - Enable CUA mode at the very beginning and migrate to default over time - Learn the concepts (Emacs is a platform!) - Learn how GUI behaves - Learn the key combinations - Learn Org Mode (this is f****** awesome!) - Have a good time!

For context, right now I use kitty+tmux and neovim to do most of my note taking and general linux stuff. This includes compiling and writing in LaTeX, script writing, etc.
 For context: I've used emacs in the past and like emacsclient + the other useful tools emacs has to offer out of the box, but it hasn't seemed really sensible to me. DistroTube recently came out with his series on building a sensible config from scratch which I've played with for a bit, but I don't want to fully commit if what I want isn't possible.
 What I am looking for: - ability to act as a terminal - pdf viewing with latex editing side by side - being able to navigate to other workspaces to view pdfs and navigate through them with vim-like binds - extensible (which emacs is) - ability to integrate zettelkasten with a pdf open in another pane/split within the same program
 The general idea I want is it do everything I need to do school/productivity wise within emacs, and nothing else. My current setup works, but I like seeing what else is out there. Let me know how doable this would be.
 Please go easy on me I know there's probably a post like this on here once a week. :')

 Is there an API for doing this with some examples for doing this? Currently I use EXWM and regular GUI program windows do show up and I can use them normally, but I need something native to Emacs and not based on XCB or other windowing modes used by Emacs programs.
 I suspect that Xwidgets (GNU Emacs Lisp Reference Manual) and An Emacs Dynamic Module for WebKit may be working along such lines but I need simple examples that are not so web-focused.
 I am not even sure whether my concept of forms in GUI Apps conform to what Emacs calls native widgets.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all! I write Rust using eglot and rustic and it works great! I can jump to the definition of an identifier with xref-find-definitions, and I can see the type of the binding with eldoc or with inlays.
 However, I don't know how to quickly jump to the type of an identifier?
 Rust uses type inference a lot, so the concrete type is often not spelled out in the source code. This means that I don't have the type to use as a starting point. An example:
 rust let foo = build_me_a_foo(); 
 Here I would like to be able to jump to the Foo type which build_me_a_foo presumably returns. Today I do this by jumping to the definition of build_me_a_foo and then jump further from the function signature.
 Reading the Emacs manual, I see that I could use C-u M-. to get a prompt for the identifier to jump to. The very large list presented to me does contain what I need, but I need to spell it out based on what eldoc showed me in the mode line.
 Has anybody written the code to look up the type and then feed it directly into C-u M-.?

 I have a question regarding ghc bootstrapping. It used to be the case that you could build an unregistered ghc for a new platform by compiling to .hc files. Copying the build dist over to the new platform and then using a g compiler to build them.
 I am wanting to port ghc to a platform with a c compiler, but no gcc or llvm port. This seems like the best option if it’s still working!
 Anyone know anything helpful?
 Edit: I realise that Hadrian makes this hard…. I’d need a cross compiler to create the build program on the target system….
 Edit 2: I think Hadrian would have to be adapted to generate hc files and makes files. But in all seriousness, isn’t this a good idea? It’s a bit of a barrier porting ghc to new platforms if the bootstrap process involved digging up ghc 6 and working up to 9.
 Thanks!

 I'm making fun in my life implementing Parser (and it's really fun), but i would like to ask following.
 i have Parser a :: Parser String -> Either String (a, String)
 let's say i have a list of parsers ps = [p1, p2, p3 ...]
 How can i push input string through all of them, and i'm looking for 2 solutions:
 Alternative (so we get first successful result)
 Chain (so i apply them one by one and output from p1 is input for p2), and its successful only if all of them are worked.
 I think this is pretty simply, but my brains are old, i have 39' temperature and need to solve it to feel better.
 Here is gh, code is located in lib/Parseme.hs

in GHC. Which means that we’ll have these in GHC 9.10, which is cause
for celebration for me. Though they are much overdue, so maybe I
should instead apologise to you.
Anyway, I thought I’d take the opportunity to discuss some of
GHC’s inner workings and how they explain some of the features of
linear types in Haskell. We’ll be discussing a frequently asked
question: why can’t Ur be a newtype? And some new questions
such as: why must linear let-bindings have a !? But first…

GHC’s frontend part 1: typechecking
Like a nature documentary, let’s follow the adventure of a single

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm starting to use dependencies in TODOs in org mode. For now I'm using only parent-child dependencies; i.e. I've set org-enforce-todo-dependencies to t so that attempting to move a task to a DONE state is blocked if the task in question has child tasks that have not yet been marked as DONE. And I have that working fine...
 ... but only if I to try to mark the task as DONE using C-c C-t (which runs (org-todo &optional ARG) ).
 But if instead I try to mark the task as DONE using S-<right> (which runs (org-shiftright &optional ARG) which will in turn, "on a headline, switch to the next TODO keyword" then the task in question gets switched to the next keyword, including DONE if that's next in the sequence, regardless of any children still being not DONE. In other words, it looks like the process triggered by S-<right> ignores the value of org-enforce-todo-dependencies.
 Is that how it's supposed to work?

I've seen a couple videos about the power of emacs org mode and I'm very interested in using it myself. My current setup is 1 laptop running windows 11, a boox note air 2+ running android, and a iphone running iOS. For me, I would like to use my e-ink tablet to markup lecture slides, take notes etc, and have it sync to all my devices. Would syncthing be good for this purpose? Accessing emacs from my phone would be a big plus but I've heard that this is easier on an android phone. 
 As of now I have no experience programming (planning to learn python in my free time) and don't really know what a text editor is or really what emacs is as a whole. 
 I would also love to use emacs org mode for: 
 -planner 
 - TODO lists 
 Any help on how to go out this would be greatly appreciated.

 I tried to change the style with c-set-style but I haven't found the one I was looking for, which is something like this.
 void stack_push (int val, stack* s) { element* e = _make_element(val); if (!e) return; e->next = s->head; s->head = e; }; 
 If you know a style that looks like that, or the main Elisp commands to get it looking like this, let me know.

 I'm new to Emacs (been using it for less than 3months) and I haven't touched Elisp that much (only for setting up some packages and configuration).

A seriously long time lurker (3+ years) turned member here.
Through that time lurking, I've gained incredibly valuable insight for working with Zettelkasten, avoided many pitfalls and had the apprehension of working with the system reduced significantly.
Many thanks to Sascha, Christian, and those who regularly frequent these forums for providing that valuable information. This forum is a cave full of treasures.

So I'm finally posting with what I hope is useful for someone else, as it has been for me; a formalised system for organising a Zettelkasten, that takes a very critical look at categorisation, folders and tags. The driving concern being reducing "cognitive friction" when creating and writing notes.

I run Emacs on Wsl 2 on Windows 11, compiled from from source with pgtk. I found a post from last week that solves this issue by compiling emacs using the default method. However, compiling with pgtk was the only working solution I had found to a problem of blurry text in emacs. 
 Does anyone have a solution for this? Thank you in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I just wanted to share a delightful moment I had today. I'm currently working on a NMEA-based protocol for some microcontroller stuff. NMEA uses a simple format:
 $<message>*<checksum>\r\n 
 And in my tests I need to write the message, and then compute the checksum over message. A simple byte-wise or. There are websites for this, or I could write a script - but that always means leaving emacs, copy-and-pasting around.
 But this is an extensible editor! This snippet does it for the marked region and inserts at point.
  (defun deets/nmea-checksum () (interactive) (let ((checksum (format "%02X" (apply 'logxor (mapcar (lambda (c) c) (buffer-substring (mark) (point))))))) (save-excursion (insert (format "*%s\\r\\n" checksum))))) 
 There's some obvious extensions like ignoring a leading $, ensuring I'm always appending at the end, and possibly even replacing an already existing checksum with the new one. But even in this most basic, cost-me-5-minutes-to-build version it's a productivity boost and just plain joy for me :D

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I know there are problems with Emacs (29.1) and the current version of GnuPG (2.4.X), causing Emacs to hang indefinitely when trying to access GnuPG tools (like saving an encrypted file). 
 Until now, the only workaround was to downgrade GnuPG (and by the way, this script fails as well). And since Homebrew doesn't have 2.4.0 version, I went all the way down to 2.2, however, the problem persists and I can't save encrypted files from Emacs. 
 I've tried on two M1 machines (both with macOS 14.2.1) and I get the same behavior. Since (fset 'epg-wait-for-status 'ignore) is dangerous and can corrupt your file, what else can I try?

 This morning, I wanted to make a new org-roam node so I SPC-m-f (org-roam-node-find) and enter the name of the new node: Archiving in Org Mode. Unfortunately, there is already a node named OrgMode Archiving and that's what was selected. Here is my config:
  (use-package orderless :config (setq completion-styles '(orderless basic) completion-category-defaults nil completion-category-overrides '((file (styles partial-completion))))) 
 Orderless finding that node would have been fine if I had a way of canceling its choice and telling it to use what I typed instead. Usual cancel keys ESC or C-g didn't do the job.
 ​
 Solved: Thanks everyone. The completion was Vertico. I had set M-k as previous in Vertico, and that was indeed what was needed- select what I typed and not the entry Vertico found. I'm a simple man, up arrow is easier for me to remember.

 GNU ELPA stands for "Emacs Lisp Package Archive", which is a repository of packages created by the GNU Emacs community. In order to submit a package to the GNU ELPA repository, a package must be licensed under the GNU General Public License (GPL) and require a copyright assignment to the Free Software Foundation (FSF) to be included in core Emacs. NonGNU ELPA allows for packages to be included without the copyright assignment, and while it does not go into core Emacs, it is still an official and popular archive for Emacs Lisp packages.
 GNU ELPA and NonGNU ELPA are both enabled by default but since MELPA is an unofficial archive it isn't and requires you to manually install it. Despite it being an unofficial archive, MELPA is still managed by the Emacs Lisp Package Archive Team, and it has a strict screening policy, so only high-quality packages that meet the licensing requirements can be included.

 I used to consider it as non-pure because it reads a hidden state C1 , which is not a parameter of this method.
 But someClass.someMethod(v1, v2) is a method. The real function in terms of FP should be something like someMethod(someClassAndItsImmutableProperties, v1, v2) , then C1 is part of the parameter.
 So someClass.someMethod(v1, v2) is a pure function. Is my understanding correct?

 org-timeblock
 https://github.com/ichernyshovvv/org-timeblock
 Emacs package that provides interactive multiple-day timeblock view for orgmode tasks.
 Also, might be used as a tool for timeblocking productivity technique.
 Changes
  
Added mark commands (mark-block, unmark-block, mark-by-regexp) for timeblocks that can be used to reschedule multiple tasks at once
 Replaced ts.el with built-in time API
 Replaced org-ql with own searching and caching functions
 dom.el is now used instead of regexps to fetch and change SVG data (much cleaner code)
 Deadline timestamps are now treated as it should be, not as events
 Now, each active timestamp in a heading body is displayed (as event), not only the first one
 Added custom variable org-timeblock-files
 Other minor bug fixes and improvements 8)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, my lsp-mode setup looks like this: 
 (use-package lsp-mode :commands (lsp lsp-deferred) :ensure t :hook ((python-mode . lsp-deferred)) :config (lsp-enable-which-key-integration t) (lsp-register-custom-settings '(("pylsp.plugins.flake8.enabled" t t) ("pylsp.plugins.autopep8.enabled" t t) ("pylsp.plugins.black.enabled" t t) ("pylsp-plugins.isort.enabled" t t) ("pylsp.plugins.rope-autoimport.enabled" t t)))) 
 The *lsp-log* output for the lsp-mode startup is this:
 Command "semgrep lsp" is not present on the path. Command "ruff-lsp" is not present on the path. Command "pylsp" is present on the path. Command "pyls" is not present on the path. Command "semgrep lsp" is not present on the path. Command "ruff-lsp" is not present on the path. Command "pylsp" is present on the path. Command "pyls" is not present on the path. Found the following clients for /home/user/test.py: (server-id pylsp, priority -1) The following clients were selected based on priority: (server-id pylsp, priority -1) 
 So I think lsp-mode should be running correctly with pylsp, right? I have some IDE features working, but none of the custom settings are working. Any help would be much appreciated! :)

 I'd really like to add properties (as if a capture) to an item as I refile. Let's say I quickly jotted down in beorg "True Grit" and when I'm refiling I want to add that to my movie list but also add properties like TODO state and then a property drawer with things like the GENRE, RELEASE, RATING etc. etc. Is that possible at all to make it a one step process instead of a two step process (refile and then add property template). Or is best to just re-enter the information with a capture and then delete the original heading?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have encountered a strange issue when using Emacs to edit LaTeX files.
 When I type certain keywords, such as \begin or \section, they are turned into unicode symbols. Please see the screenshot for examples.
 This behaviour could have been fine, except that they don't seem to function. For instance, the "section" symbol does not create a section in the document.
 It looks like it might have something to do with the input method for TeX, since I can find the symbols as "translations" of the keywords when I look there. Please see screenshot.
 I don't encounter this problem when using emacs -Q but I also cannot find a LaTeX related culprit in my config, so I'm at a loss. I experience the behaviour both on my personal Linux computer and on my work Mac.
 Does anyone know what might cause this behaviour and how I can disable it?
 In case you think there might be something in my config and want to help me out by having a look, it's available here.
 EDIT:
 Thank you for the help! Turns out it was related to corfu's autocomplete. Setting corfu-auto to nil resolved the issue.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Some may remember me asking about migrating my TiddlyWiki instances to org a while back. I'm now actively working on that conversion, starting with the two relatively small instances. Once I have those done and have learned from my many anticipated mistakes, I'll tackle the journal for my day-job.
 My question is this, and it's not necessarily TW-centric: for those of you with comparable situations, do you use one larger (centralized) org file, or one master file that mostly contains overview/contents and links to a number of smaller files, one per topic?
 I'll give an example: one my my TW instances is for my FOSS projects (mostly modules, mostly for Perl at this point). I have about 17 separate topics in it, each one ranging from 5-6 lines of text to the largest being about a full page by itself. Would you folks be more inclined to have a single file (a la the original TiddlyWiki), or break each topic into its own sub-file?
 I realize that org is going to be capable of jumping around a large file as easily as it can jump between files, at least that's the impression I've gotten. I guess I'm interested in what people find works best for them?

 Is there a way to use evil AND emacs keybindings.
 If there isn't a way, is there a way to do things like move to the first character of a line, format (like you do in vim by selecting and pressing "=")?
 Edit: I have only followed the basic emacs tutorial and found a few useful keys here and there. I've been using it for a week and I think I'm going to stay.

I really like this as a writing environment and use it whenever I can get away with it. 
 The document class is Koma-script scrartcl that I have set up an export for. I have no math or images here, but would just use the standard math font for that - I like it when math glyphs look different from text glyphs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Has anyone successfully configured Emacs to run without freezing on macOS?
 On my macOS, Emacs exhibits random freezes, and this behavior varies across distributions like Emacs-Plus and EmacsMac. These freezes don't seem tied to any specific package. And when it freezes, i can only force exit the whole process.
 I THINK EmacsMac tends to freeze more when in fullscreen mode on an external monitor. But each time I think I've pinpointed and resolved the issue, it unfortunately resurfaces.Most stack traces aren't very enlightening, often showing repeated calls to functions like 'mac_gui_loop', 'dispatch_semaphore_wait_slow', and 'redisplay_internal...'.
 Is there anyone who can run Emacs on macOS without experiencing these freezes for >1 day? If so, what hardware are you using? Did you use any special configurations or fixes?
 Does native-compilation or any other flag influences this?
 I plan writing an article about Emacs on macOS, aiming for a stable and consistent environment. However, the inconsistency of these freezing issues makes it difficult to offer solid advice. Any insights or experiences would be greatly appreciated!

'(org-todo-keywords '((sequence "TODO" "WAITING" "|" "DONE" "CANCELLED")))
  
I noticed what may be a bug that I have not been able to replicate. In my org-mode file I have a repeating task similar to the one below:
  
TODO Wash car 
 <2024-01-14 +1m>
  
After completing the task, I type c-t c-d. Because the task is repeating, org-mode typically reschedules the task one month into the future. However, when I typed c-t c-d, the status of the task changed to DONE.
 Without changing any of the syntax, I typed c-t c-t, which toggled the status back to TODO. After typing c-t c-d again, the task rescheduled one month into the future, as expected.
 I have been unable to replicate the error. Any explaination?

 The problem with this one is that it always gave the mapped list without the last element, and I can see why. But my question is why does this code work:
 mymap :: (a -> b) -> [a] -> [b] mymap f (x:xs) = f x : mymap f xs mymap _ [] = []

my entire career as a Humanities professor, with diverse interests in Sciences, Maths, and pretty much everything, I was going to have to add another 0 to do those disciplines justice in the first place. 

  
10000 - Humanities
11000 - Arts (Performing and Visual)

  
11100 - Music

  

  
11200 - Theatre

  
12000 - History

  
12800 - English/British/UK History

  

  
12900 - French History

  
13000 - Literature

  
1381[act.scene]  (For some reason... when I was reading Bussy d'Ambois by George Chapman, I placed it here in Literature instead of in Theatre... If I recall, I had a reason for this. I don't remember what it was, though. I want to say it was because I was saving "Theatre" for like... theatre theory? Anyway, to explain this UID, 13 for literature, 8 for George Chapman being English, 1 for George Chapman the author/playwright himself being the first author and 0 will be for Shakespeare. )

  
14000 - Philosophy

  
1401[book#].[Stephanus number(paragletter)]Folgezettel# - 1 for The Republic, 0 for Plato

  


I have two separate systems going, apparently, in two categories under Humanities. But they both reflect something important, I feel. 
I was wondering, does anyone else use their UIDs to tell them information about the card? I'm also using a date at the top, in case I can't figure out where to put it when I first make the card [YYMMDD, of course.] Like, the way i use 8 to mean "England/English" or 9 to mean "France/French" under across History and Literature. Alternatively, 0 could mean Greece and 1 for Plato in the context of Philosophy's 14018.532b1. Just thinking aloud.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cross posting this from Discourse:
 I’ve been looking into Haskell’s data ecosystem. There seems to be a lot of foundational work that is missing that I’d like to help implement (if such efforts already exist) or start to implement with a group of Haskellers who have time. Namely:
  
A flat buffer library - the current one is abandoned and isn’t featured in the official flat buffer documentation despite some seemingly niche language called Lobster being supported.
 an Apache Arrow compatible data frame library (along with the rest of the apache arrow suite)
 A well supported plotting library
  
I think this was somewhat initially the vision of dataHaskell but that effort seems to have fizzled out. Were there learnings published somewhere? What were the pitfalls? Is there still activity in the community?

Why?
Any app that renders URLs as clickable links can now become your external app or file launchpad.
🎉 Create open-file-with-app links anywhere!

For example, you can use this in almost any Markdown editor with syntax highlighting to get a clickable link that will open TextEdit:

 * TODO Out of bed by 7h SCHEDULED: <2024-01-16 Tue 07:00 +1d> :PROPERTIES: :STYLE: habit :END: 
 By the nature of this habit, it can either be done (I get out of bed before 7am) or I may fail (I stay in bed until after 7am).
 The point is that if I don't manage to get out of bed by 7am this task should not appear as an overdue todo the following day as if I could still do it for the previous day. I want to mark it as failed on the day it was scheduled and also see it as a failed / not done state in the habit graph of the org agenda. Any ideas how this is typically done in orgmode?

So I was wondering whether GHC has this kind of optimization or not. It seems that the Maybe and Either types are used frequently for error handling so such optimization can give big performance benefit.

 The tricky part is keeping them within the width of the window and truncating the text of a particular column when the text that would go on that line exceeds the self-imposed width of said column.
 I have something relatively working by mapping through the list and truncating the relevant strings from the data based off of calculations and inserting them into the buffer.
 This isn't bad but, at larger amounts (say, 15,000 lines), things slow down, taking about a half a second.
 I've written it so the data is inserted into the buffer and, then, manipulating the text to get the truncated version directly in the buffer (saves about a tenth of a second) but it's stil…]]></summary>

 Surely some enterprising Emacs user must have created something like that by now, assuming its not built-in in the first place?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[First time using TypeLits and Proxy. I want to convert bytestrings to fixed length vectors and have the vectors length be known on the type level.
 import GHC.TypeLits import Data.Proxy import qualified Data.ByteString as BS import qualified Data.Vector.Fixed as VF import Data.Word (Word8) class KnownNat n => ValidByteStringLength n where byteVectorLength :: Proxy n -> Int byteVectorLength proxy = fromIntegral (natVal proxy) instance ValidByteStringLength 128 instance ValidByteStringLength 256 -- Add instances for all lengths I want to support -- A type alias for a fixed-length byte vector type ByteVector (n :: Nat) = VF.ContVec n Word8 byteStringToByteVector :: forall n. ValidByteStringLength n => BS.ByteString -> Either String (ByteVector n) byteStringToByteVector bs | BS.length bs == expectedLength = Right $ (VF.fromList :: [Word8] -> ByteVector n) . BS.unpack $ bs | otherwise = Left "ByteString length doesn't match the target vector length" where expectedLength = byteVectorLength (Proxy @n) 
 However, I get
  • Couldn't match type: Data.Vector.Fixed.Cont.Peano (n + 1) with: Data.Vector.Fixed.Cont.S (Data.Vector.Fixed.Cont.Peano n) arising from a use of ‘VF.fromList’ 
 Here, S refers to the successor of its type argument, but does that not mean that the Peano numbers are equal? Does this happen because the compiler does not reduce it to n+1, rather than S(n), and conclude they are the same? Is this a bug? Am I overlooking something?

 If I run a python script on my .org files which creates a new .org file with all TODOs that meet certain property conditions (i.e. all TODOs with the property 'Category: Work')--will emacs consider these TODOs in the new .org file the same as, or different to, the TODOs that were originally copied?
 So, if I had a TODO in .org file 1, and python copied it to .org file 2, would emacs view these as separate TODOs? Basically, if a dynamic block called all TODOs with the property 'Category: Work', would this TODO appear twice?
 I ask because my specific workflow will likely require me to do something like this, and I am wondering if there is a way to do so without emacs thinking they are different. Might one way of doing this be to assign each TODO a unique identifier (UID) so that when I copy a TODO, the UID is copied too? Would this solve the issue of emacs possibly viewing both items as separate rather than the same?
 Any help is much appreciated. Thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am trying to migrate to ibuffer instead of tabbar mode to switch between buffers. It would be convenient for me to have the ibuffer open and visible while I am editing a file, so I was trying the ibuffer-sidebar package. 
 It seems like a great package, however, I am trying to get around a minor inconvenience. Whenever I press enter on a buffer in ibuffer-sidebar, that buffer opens after splitting the window which contains the previous buffer into two. I would like to change the behavior to have the new buffer take up the full space. Any suggestions how I could achieve this?

 i have following code in my neovim config how can i replicate these in doom emacs in evil mode i read the map! macro docs but i cannot understand how can i do these
 ```lua vmap <c-v> "+p (ie pasting in insert mode with C-v) vim.api.nvim_set_keymap('n', 'o', 'o<esc>', { noremap = true }) vim.api.nvim_set_keymap('n', 'O', 'O<esc>', { noremap = true })
 lvim.keys.normal_mode["<C-u>"] = "<C-u>zz" lvim.keys.normal_mode["<C-d>"] = "<C-d>zz"
 vim.api.nvim_set_keymap('n', '<space>ii', '1z=', { noremap = true , desc = "fix spelling" }) vim.api.nvim_set_keymap('i', '<C-a>', '<cmd> norm z=1<CR>', { noremap = true, desc = "fix spell ins mode" })
 keymap('v', '<space>g', function() local text = vim.getVisualSelection() tb.current_buffer_fuzzy_find({ default_text = text }) end, opts) ```
 these are - maping o,O to go to normal mode after creating new line - while doing C-d also center the buffer - in normal mode when cursor is on a wrong spelling fix it by replacing to closest match - similar keybinding in insert mode - select a word in visual mode and then fuzzy match its presence in live grep of the whole buffer
 if help me solve these issues it will give me a good direction on how to do similar things in future. Thanks :)

 Typst is a fairly new typesetting language which purports to be a more modern alternative to LaTeX. 
 Based on the VS-code extension https://github.com/Enter-tainer/typst-preview, I wrote a minor mode which gives a live preview while you edit your files (a la impatient mode). Feedback appreciated!
 Aside: There's already a fair amount of support in emacs through `typst-ts-mode`: 
 https://git.sr.ht/~meow_king/typst-ts-mode (link is currently down due to sourcehut problems)
 and the lsp `typst-lsp`: https://github.com/nvarner/typst-lsp, which seems compatible with lsp-mode, so the typst writing experience is slowly catching up with auctex!

 All I'm trying to do is add a function that will print a message right now. Nothing fancy, but my custom function isn't being invoked at all, and I just cannot figure out why. I've tried multiple ways of creating the keymap, and none of them work. On top of that, I can call keymap-lookup on my temporary keymap and see that it's pointing to the correct function. Any help would be appreciated.
 Code:
 ```lisp (require 'popup)
 (cl-defun temp-select (p i) (message "popup %s" p))
 (defvar temp-keymap (let ((keymap (make-sparse-keymap))) (set-keymap-parent keymap popup-menu-keymap) (define-key keymap "a" 'temp-select) keymap))

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I use org tables to keep track of stuff. I have a number of field formulas that calculate stuff, some based on fields in other tables and others are simple mathematical expressions. If I add a row, say in the middle of such a table, all absolute field formulas below the added row will be broken since all field references will be off by one. I use relative references in some places to "sum the five rows above" etc, these do not break. Below is an example of formulas:
 @3$2 = remote(table1_77,@>$2) @15$2 = ceil(8126/12) @16$3 = vsum(@-9$2..@-1$2) @21$3 = vsum(@-3$2..@-1$2) @34$3 = vsum(@-11$2..@-1$2) @37$3 = vsum(@-1$2..@-1$2) @39$2 = ceil((6770/12)*0.44) @43$2 = ceil(184*0.44) @45$3 = vsum(@-6$2..@-1$2 @49$3 = vsum(@-2$2..@-1$2) @59$2 = ceil((4050*4)/(12*2)) @61$3 = vsum(@-5$2..@-1$2) @71$3 = vsum(@-8$2..@-1$2) @72$2 = vsum(@3..@-1) @72$3 = vsum(@2..@-1) @72$5 = vsum(@2..@-1) @73$2 = @-1$5-@-1$2 
 All field references on the left of '=' are such that can break when adding a row in the middle. I cannot come up with a way of making them relative and not breaking when adding rows. And I haven't found a way for Org to automatically update all absolute field references below an inserted row. Is there a way to solve this?

At some point everyone tries to learn Haskell and I’m generally a curious person, so I want to learn Haskell now. But I have a few mental issues that are being worked on. Because of that I rarely finish what I start and need someone to push me to do something. I can read documentations all I want then ‘haskell-learning’ will be another orphan on my GitHub. Are there any resources that I can code along, maybe a beginner to intermediate video series where someone implements an app or solves a problem? I guess there are not many because most Haskell devs are really smart and prefer to read. Hmm, I feel stupid, but I still want to know Haskell. I don’t know if this post is welcome here, if not, feel free to delete it. :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi Emacs friends. I've had a strange keyboard shortcuts issue come up today:
  
2 systems are sharing synced Emacs config
 Both systems have caps lock mapped to act as an additional ctrl key
 Both systems use KDE
 One system will allow some ctrl key shortcuts to be typed with caps lock (see below). C-S-s nope; C-S-d OK, for example.
  
Init.el:
 ;; Let's save stuff more easily ;; This only works on one system when using caps as ctrl. ;; Kubuntu is OK with it--use caps as ctrl, this is fine ;; The other system Manjaro KDE only lets this work if pressing regular ctrl key, even though caps is mapped to ctrl (global-set-key (kbd "C-S-s") 'save-buffer) ;; Let's have the plain date at hand ;; This works fine on all systems when using caps as ctrl, incl. Manjaro (global-set-key (kbd "C-S-d") 'plain-date) 
 I looked through my custom KDE shortcuts but C-S-s isn't mapped to anything that I can see. 
 C-S-x also doesn't work on this system unless I use the regular ctrl key.
 I also restarted Emacs just in case but it's still happening.
 Thanks for any tips to troubleshoot this.
 Edit: Marking resolved since it seems to be a reported hardware issue with some Dell models, more here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We all know that Scala is losing ground. But I still haven't seen the reasons why clearly formulated. I think the best people to answer this question would be the people who have stopped using Scala.
 Questions to those people: 1. Why have you stopped using Scala, or Why are you planning to stop? 2. How much Scala experience do you have? What stack were you using? 3. What would make you come back, or Is there anything that would make you change your mind? 4. One suggestion for improvement. 
 People who are not using Scala may not be on this sub anymore. But in case some are still lurking, it would be great to hear their opinion.
 Please feel free to speak your mind. All answers from former devs are welcome.
 In case you want to share your thoughts anonymously, you can do it via this google form. I will share all the responses in a thread.
 Scala is very close to my heart as long time Scala dev myself. I think knowing why people are leaving + suggestions will really help. Thanks everyone for your input.

I've looked and I can't find a working method to export my .org file into pdf so the table automatically splits where necessary within the pdf. People say to use the long table package but when I include something like "#+ATTR_LATEX: :environment longtable :align |p{7cm}|l|l|" nothing happens. 
 Also, how do I change the table width? I couldn't find a good explanation either :/

 What I'd like to know is what's the format of org-mobile-capture-file (mobileorg.org by default). It appears to me that it does not only contain capture headlines which will be blindly appended to the staging area, but it may also contain some rows that encode some edit events to existing headlines that will be applied when org-mobile-pull is invoked. If that's the case, I'd like to see some concrete instances of mobileorg.org files as an example, if anybody has time to satisfy this little whim of mine.
 Thank you in advance

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I want to test a function by comparing the return value against static content in test data files. I'm looking to answer the following questions:
 Is there any standard practice/convention for putting test data files? For JVM projects following Maven directory structure, the location is src/test/resources, but AFAICT, there's no such convention in Haskell. So, putting the files inside the test directory, presumably under the same module path, makes sense to me.
 For example, If the code under test is in the module A.B, then putting the test data in the directory test/A/B is fine. If using HSpec, the test module is A.BSpec.
 How to read the test data files? There's no need to list these files in the cabal file, because these are't going to be shipped with the package. Simple readFile test/A/B/file.txt from the test works.
 Can anyone please confirm/correct the above statements?

Removal would be even better so I can save disk space too but it seems to be a too complicated task to be worth it. I asked ChatGPT what to put in my "_emacs" file in "C:\Users\Admin\AppData\Roaming\_emacs", and these expressions don't seem to do anything, I'm still able to open calendar, mail, games, etc.
 (setq gnus-init-file nil) (setq gnus-novice-user nil) (setq calendar-load-hook nil) (setq mark-diary-entries-in-calendar nil) (setq tramp-mode nil) (desktop-save-mode -1) (setq org-startup-folded nil) (setq zone-which-screen nil) 
 Are these expressions out of date for this version, am I putting it in the wrong file, am I misunderstanding Lisp, or do they not actually disable them? Other expressions like turning off autosave, changing font and background colors, turning off cursor blink, turning off the bell/error sound and replacing it with visible-bell and so on seem to work.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I know this question has been asked over and over again, but after reading many articles on this topic, as well as blog posts, orgmode tutorials, and trying a bit on my own, I'm still not sure orgmode fits my needs. Since the orgmode learning curve comes up a lot, I want to make sure it's worth my time. 
 I'm a graduate student in applied mathematics. I'm just starting my master's degree, so I'm looking to set up my workflow for classes, research and personal projects. I'd like to be able to quickly and easily create notes on articles, or textbooks, keeping a journal, organize files into projects, create to-do lists and roadmaps (much like orgmode does perfectly if I've understood what I've read correctly).
 I've never used emacs in my life and I don't come from a computer science background --> I find it very difficult to learn and I have the impression that it will be a long time before I can start using it for real. 
 People keep saying that it's worth learning emacs and orgmode nonetheless because of the unlimited customization possibilities. What are your thoughts on this? 
 Should I be patient and learn to use emacs and orgmode to set up my workflow, or should I just start using Notion or any other simple organization and note-taking app? 
 Note that I don't want a complex setup in the long run, just something minimalist that allows me to concentrate on what's important while having a clear vision of my work.

 At some point over the past couple of months Magit was updated to depend on a version of Transient that is greater than the one packaged by Emacs 29.1. This is accompanied by an error message with simple instructions on how to manually upgrade transient and fix the issue:
 ``` Emergency (magit): Magit requires ‘transient’ >= 0.5.0, but due to bad defaults, Emacs’ package manager, refuses to upgrade this and other built-in packages to higher releases from GNU Elpa.
 To fix this, you have to add this to your init file:

 What I need is: 
  
Show symbols of current selected buffer, if buffer changes, update the symbols automatically
 Open and close sidebar with single shortcut

 How can I achieve this?

But why is it so? Why is it that Contravariant doesn't instantiate Functor? On a superficial level, given Haskell's definition of Contravariant and contramap, obviously there don't correspond to fmap's type signature. But why are we forced to define Contravariant in this way? In category theory, there's no doubt that contravariant functors are functors. Does anyone have an explanation?

 Does anyone figured out a way of sharing their emacs conf in a single org file and ask collaborators to load the configurations in a single line of code (like the below, but for a org file)?

 I'm currently working with a scala codebase on a REST API that I did not design with the following stack : Scala 2 + Play Framework + Silhouette + Slick (and some Akka actors but I don't think it is relevant here).
 My client (who is administrator on the platform being developed for his own company) got used to login as other users before I enforced some well needed security developments regarding passwords. Long story short was: he created the users with their password so he knew their authentication infos and was able to login in order to "see what they can see", "check for missing features directly on their account", "test out that some specific features would really work for them" in production, etc.
 But! I changed the way users are created, mainly because the passwords he created were way too easy to guess (without even having to brute force, litteraly everyone could guess the passwords, that's why he could remember them in the first place).
 So he can't login as other users anymore, and he would like to be able to "do it again". I already worked on a platform that allowed user impersonation for administrators out of the box but I can't find anything on the internet regarding this subject on the Play framework and Scala documentations or their communities...
 So my questions for you are: have you ever had to deal with an impersonation feature request using silhouette + play framework + scala and if you haven't, do you have any advice to provide on the subject anyway? =D
 Thanks very much for those who take the time to respond!
 EDIT: added essential politeness to my post

 At first, here's the solution I did a month ago in Go: main.go. Basically, I iterate from 1 to raceTime, and count the number of times where applying a function is bigger than a specific value. Note that raceTime can be pretty big (in my case it's 55826490). The result is executed in a few milliseconds.
 I did the same in Haskell: Main.hs:
 ``` numberOfWays :: Int -> Int -> Int numberOfWays time distance = foldl' (\acc i -> acc + (travelDistance i time distance)) 0 [1 .. (time - 1)]
 travelDistance :: Int -> Int -> Int -> Int travelDistance hold raceTime distance = if (raceTime - hold) * hold > distance then 1 else 0 ```
 At first, I used fold and I had a stack overflow. I read here and there what the issue was so I switched to foldl'. Yet, this version runs in more than 20 seconds compared to only a few milliseconds in Go.
 I'm not at all comparing Haskell and Go, but I'm trying to understand what makes my solution so slow and how to improve it. Note that I have seen versions in O(1), fair enough but I don't want to implement a solution with better time complexity. I'd like to stick with an O(n) solution for now, to understand what I'm doing wrong.
 Thanks for the help.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[hi all, I'm going through the elisp tutorial book. I got to the exercise to write an interactive function that doubles a parameter but have hit a stumbling block
 (defun double-param (number) (interactive "p") (* number 2)) 
 This is the function I wrote. After running C-x C-e after the function (unlike without interactive) I can use M-x double-param but after hitting return it does not wait for input for the parameter. It simply exits with nothing in the echo area. Similarly I cannot use C-u 3 M-x double-param to send it the parameter. However, it still works if I call it with (double-param 3) for example I'll see 6 *#o6, #x6, ?\C-f) in the echo area.
 What am I doing wrong? I'm guessing my understanding of what the "p" character modifier to interactive is wrong. Is there a different character to pass to interactive that will behave correctly?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For those who, like me, have to share their days between Emacs and one of IDEA's IntelliJ-based products, I recently published the first version of an IntelliJ plugin called EmacsJ. It could perhaps be of interest for some people here. While the Emacs keymap in IntelliJ is actually pretty good, there's enough differences that my Emacs-marinated fingers stumble too often while using IntelliJ. So the plugin is meant to be an extension of the existing Emacs functionality, offering around 40 commands that either modify existing IntelliJ commands to be closer to Emacs, or are pure additions to the IntelliJ commands.
 The plugin only makes these commands available, and you can use whichever ones you find useful, either by adding keybindings one-by-one, or by using the EmacsJ keymap installed by the plugin which is an extension of the Emacs keymap and activates all the commands at once.
 The main features are:
  
Incremental search modelled on Emacs' Isearch, with text and regexp search.
 Query-replace as in Emacs with text or regexps, with a very light-weight interface.
 Word commands: transpose, upper-case, lower-case, capitalize, move, delete.
 Rectangle commands: copy, open, clear, paste.
 Whitespace commands: delete space around point, delete empty lines.
 Easy access to clipboard history à la Emacs (kill ring).
 A mark history with ability to pop mark (mark ring), and exchange point and mark.
 Duplicate and comment regions and lines.
 Recenter and relocate caret.
 Zap to character.
  
​
 The plugin is of course free and open source.

 Usually, the job description describes the tooling required, such as Airflow, Spark, Flinck, etc. I have some previous experience with Spark and Hadoop. But somehow it seems insufficient to start a conversation. 
 Can anyone provide me with some hints on how to start this focus shift from Development to Data Engineering?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm starting with ZIO Http, in the past I used Akka Http, Play, and Http4s.
 So, I visited the official site on github: https://github.com/zio/zio-http
 Latest version is 3.0.0.RC4 ... so I will skip version 3 for the moment.
 Therefore I will try previous version of ZIO Http .... but in maven repository (https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/dev.zio/zio-http) there are no version 2 or version 1 ... jumps from 0.0.5 to 3.0.0-RCx ...
 Where are versions 2 and 1? In github official site I see the following:
 NOTES ON VERSIONING:
  
Older library versions 1.x or 2.x with organization io.d11 of ZIO Http are derived from Dream11, the organization that donated ZIO Http to the ZIO organization in 2022.
 Newer library versions, starting in 2023 and resulting from the ZIO organization (dev.zio) started with 0.0.x, reaching 1.0.0 release candidates in April of 2023
  
Check in maven repository, search for "io.d11" (https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/io.d11/zhttp) but all versions 1 and 2 are "RC" ...
 ​
 So I'm kind of lost ...
 - I don't want to use version 3 because latest version is "RC"
 - But I'm not able to find versions 2 or 1 ...
 ​
 Am I doing something wrong when searching versions?
 Any suggestion?

 Super quick question. I love building ghc cross compilers, but I am struggling a bit since the switch to Hadrian. I can’t find enough information on the process to understand it. E.g. what is the role of the configure script now? Do build.mk options do anything?
 Has anyone got either an overview of this, or alternatively some scripts to cross build ghc that I can study?
 All the best!
 Bonus Question: can you still bootstrap ghc from .hc files? I’m wanting to port GHC to 9front and I a cross c toolchain looks like a pain.

 I am trying to dive back into emacs after installing nix, ensuring some reproducibility. 
 After starting prog-mode in the scratch buffer, the letters "C-x C-f" were highlighted beautifully. After some digging I found that they are the output of the function "substitute-command-keys" 
 I was playing around with it and tried to evaluate (substitute-command-keys "String \\[abort-recursive-edit]"). This gave me the output #("String C-]" 7 10 (font-lock-face help-key-binding face help-key-binding)) 
 My question is, how can I get the output displayed with the "help-key-binding" face applied to "C-]" 
 Thanks,

 I've upgraded my personal project to use Scala 3 (precisely Scala 3.3.1).I'd like to take advantage of opaque types, though, even if Doobie is in the latest version that seems to support Scala 3, it doesn't know how decode the opaque type into a String, ZonedDateTime or any other reference/composite type (works with primitive types) when using the type in a Fragment or Sql interpolator e.g. in an Insert query.
 Found: (price : com.marryfied.bandservice.domain.model.Band.Price) Required: doobie.syntax.SqlInterpolator.SingleFragment[?] band <- sql"insert into bands (name, price, address_id, created, updated) VALUES ($x, $price, $addressId, $created, $updated)" Found: (name : com.marryfied.bandservice.domain.model.Band.Name) Required: doobie.syntax.SqlInterpolator.SingleFragment[?] val updateBandQuery = sql"update bands SET name = $name, price = $price, updated = $updated where id = $id"

 Here's the gist: https://gist.github.com/wjoz/b88d206826501ce3bf6915508e17613a (Look at PostgresBandRepository) 
 Is there any possibility to define custom mappings so Doobie knows to treat an opaque type e.g. Name or Price like a concrete implementation e.g. a String and decode it properly? 
 I also may be doing something wrong, so any help in figuring it out is highly appreciated :) 
 Thanks in advance!

Basically all I want is one folder with multiple projects that stores all my pipelines, 1 commons project that sets up databricks configs and being able to build all projects into individual jar files.

I tried using gradle task rules - mustRanAfter, shouldRanAter and DependsOn, all seem to apply the rule within each individual module but not across the whole project.
 Is it even possible to run all UTs across all modules and then trigger a new task with gradle build? Thanks!

From searching online, seq should be build in and be Version 2.24 since quiet some time. I also don't remember ever running into issues with this in the past.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi All,
 I work using a local emacs instance running on my Mac and ssh to a remote machine. The two do not share a filesystem - i.e. any server files created on the Mac won't be immediately visiable on the remote. 
 I've been trying to call emacsclient on the remote and have that open a frame on the local emacs instance. This used to work for the longest time (by accident?). I was recently noodling with my setup and suddenly it no longer works :) 
 I've been attempting to do the following from https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/emacsclient-Options.html : 
 local$ ssh -R12345:localhost:12345 remote 
 remote$ export EDITOR="emacsclient \
 --server-file=server \ 
 --tramp=/ssh:remote:" remote$ $EDITOR /tmp/foo.txt #Should open in local emacs.
 where I've copied the server file (from local Mac to remote) just ahead of trying.
 ​
 Any tips on how to get this work again? Quite a big part of my flow and hate having to use $EDITOR=vim on the remove :D

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello! As a new Emacs user, it seems that I have joined in exciting times with the adoption of treesitter + LSP (which also was my setup in neovim). I have spent some time customizing and slowly get the hang of how minor/major modes work.
 From what I saw, a major mode defines syntax rules for highlighting (similar to treesitter), on-the-fly error checking with flycheck (similar to LSP) and some setup, such as indentation, etc.
 I understand that TS + LSP are still being actively developed and integrated into Emacs and so I accept that the experience using these tools might not yet match that of established major modes. So I am mostly curious about the future.
 If you were to start coding in a new language in Emacs, what would your setup look like? My thinking is to install the treesitter grammar and the LSP plus minor modes for navigation and editing (e.g., lispy for elisp). Would TS + LSP be used instead of the language major mode or in conjunction with said major mode?

Without issuing a command to swap the two windows, is there a setting that will cause emacs to open the file_a file in the left window and file_b in the right window? The convention that emacs uses appears to make the last file specified on the command line as the main buffer (which is the left window in my case).

 Its is possible to share your elisp function for the migration?

 In this case, I cannot jump to "1 Introduction", "2 The Way of Emacs", or any other non-leaf nodes like "Guiding Philosophy".
 Is there any way to configure imenu so that an item gets created for those inner, non-leaf nodes?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've started using lsp-bridge after months of fighting with eglot and lsp-mode. Both eglot and lsp-mode are great projects, but they have their quirks, and for me, most of them revolve around how slow and how prone to timing out they are, as well as the massive memory footprint that they cause (I've had both of them spawn clangd processes that end up consuming 20-30GB, and so far lsp-bridge is keeping under 10GB, which is fine). This isn't their fault per se--I'm working on an Unreal Engine project and there is just so much going on all the time, and I can easily believe that parsing JSON is the bottleneck. (I know there's a new-ish project that tries to solve that problem for lsp-mode, and I will definitely try that one day if this experiment with lsp-bridge doesn't work out.)
 So, two questions:
  
Can I jump to the (header) file under the cursor, or like lsp-mode, cause that header to become a link to the file?
 I have some functions and classes that seem inaccessible because they're wrapped up in a namespace. This isn't true of everything in a namespace, just a few things. That means I can't jump to classes/functions defined in that namespace, and I also get no completion information back. This wasn't the case with eglot or lsp-mode, so I don't think it's a fundamental limitation of clangd.
  
Other than that, so far, I'm pretty impressed. I'll work out some keybindings and wrapper functions to see if I can get the functionality that I'm missing, but for jumping around the code, it's significantly more performant.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lately I've noticed that new frames (e.g., created with emacsclient -nc) don't come to the front with keyboard focus on them. I'm now on Mac OSX 14.2.1 (Sonoma), but I think it started happening before Sonoma upgrade. This behavior also shows with other programmatic ways of getting new frames (make-frame, yequake, etc.)
 Has anyone else noticed it, or solved it hopefully? 
 I'm up to date on osx (14.2.1 Sonoma) and emacs:

 The first line, with "mail.git", is the form I would like these things to be. I cringe at the repetition in each of them as I have the same headers bit that I want to replace with the (rx bol (or ...)) bit everywhere. But I can't figure out the syntax to generalize that. In Clojure I could whip up a little let-bound function and use into to pull it off; what is the elisp solution to being able to stick the same rx code inline everywhere? I'm imagining (rx headers (* anything).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to get a nice setup for LaTeX/Overleaf rolling, and I really like how GhostText and atomic-chrome let me just edit my browser Overleaf live rather than worrying about keeping a local git repo up-to-date with collaborators' changes. I was wondering if there's any way to get citar working with this setup though?
 At the moment whenever I use M-x citar-insert-citation in a LaTeX buffer using atomic-chrome, I get the message "RefTeX works only in buffers visiting a file". That seems conclusively like a dead-end to me, but this old comment from /u/T_Verron does imply that it is possible. (it also implies my setup might not work so well for collaborative editing as I thought it would, but I'm crossing my fingers that things have improved in the last two years)
 Can anyone point me in the right direction on a possible workaround? Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hej fellows,
 I am using Org Mode while learning about Guix via the fabulous Dissecting Guix series, employing Code blocks to visualize what it is I am talking about. However, I noticed two things that REALLY bug me out.
 First off, when I load the org file containing said source blocks, it is slow to the point of unusability UNLESS I first start GEISER-CONNECT with an instance of GUIX REPL hooked up. This leads me to believe that it is independent of org mode and has to do with the fact that it searches for the code to which the blocks reference. Nonetheless, input on this is highly appreciated
 Second, when I use TAB (for org-cycle), I am asked for the currently used scheme implementation - despite the fact that both related geiser variables, geiser-active-implementation and geiser-default-implementation only contain guile. When I choose guile, then the source block contents become read-only, and all subsequent editing needs to happen in a separate Org Src buffer. I have no clue why this is the case.
 I have come to the point where I commented out all code blocks to not have to deal with it, which is obviously not acceptable in the long run. Thus, any input is appreciated :)
 Have a good day, fellows!
 EDIT/SOLVED: I found out the source of the problem. At one point I had opened a lot of files related to Guix and then saved the Desktop file. Then, loading the file would load all those other files including all modes related. For some reason I don't quite understand this literally ground emacs to a halt performance-wise.

 One thing I don't like most is there is no parentheses and comma in function calls. When a line contains several function calls with each having more than one arguments, your brain will be burdened to identify the "parse tree", while in popular languages the parentheses will save you this effort.
 I don't think there is mathematics base for this kind of designation. You can argue this is concise or elegant. I may also think the same way if I stick to Haskell for a while. But I'm afraid this can be one of the reasons Haskell has not been more popular - a developer from another language with passion of FP comes here, only to find he can't tolerate the syntax and finally leaves for other FPs. :-)

 This is a dangerous variable, so I don't want to just add (org-confirm-babel-evaluate . nil) to my safe-local-variable-values, because then any file would run its code blocks without asking me.

 eglot--error: [eglot] Unsupported or ignored LSP capability `:implementationProvider' 
 The particular capability varies with what I am trying to do, but in short, even though I can connect to racket-langserver, any attempt to use eglot cross-reference features results in an error message like that above with each of the capabilities. I am using a vanilla configuration based on Emacs Bedrock. The pertinent parts of my config are here
 (use-package racket-mode :ensure t) (use-package eglot :hook (((c-mode c++-mode python-mode elixir-mode gleam-ts-mode racket-mode) . eglot-ensure)) :custom (eglot-send-changes-idle-time 0.1) :bind-keymap ("C-c l" . eglot-mode-map) :bind (:map eglot-mode-map ("a" . eglot-code-actions) ("r" . eglot-rename) ("h" . eldoc) ("f" . eglot-format) ("F" . eglot-format-buffer) ("d" . xref-find-definitions-at-mouse) ("D" . eglot-find-declaration) ("i" . eglot-find-implementation))) 
 I've checked the eglot events buffer and don't see any requests going out. The only message I get back is the error mentioned above.
 This happens to me in Racket, but I've seen the same problem in other languages like Elixir. I should note that these features do work with other editors/LSP clients like Neovim and Doom Emacs. Am I missing some crucial configuration?

Thankfully it's not a fatal issue since a single undo restores the contents of the buffer but it's very strange and annoying! Has anyone else experienced this issue or perhaps know of a fix?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I followed this guide for using LaTeX with emacs, and I added snippets to my emacs configuration. The snippets are here along with my emacs config here.
 For some reason, when my snippets activate (either automatically or with tab completion) a new line is inserted after the snippet. As a result, my documents become very hard to read very quickly. The GIFs in the guide didn't have this issue, so I was wondering if anyone here could point me in the right direction.

Swimming with Ideas
This is another installment of the What Are You Working On? thread. Please be courageous and add to this thread by telling us what is happening in and around your ZK journey. Join the community and enlighten us about your knowledge path trajectory. I do this for selfish reasons. It helps me clarify my goals and visualize my thinking. And sometimes, a conversation sparks an idea worth exploring. This is an invitation to you to up your participation in the discussion.
Ideas I'm exploring with my ZK:
EDCI445 Young Adult Literature is about to start.
I'm studying techniques for capturing "Idea Flurries."
Reviewing 2023 and setting intentions for 2024.



I'm trying hard to slow down to interrogate and chew my thinking thoroughly. He/She who dies with the most notes doesn't win. The goal is a rich and fulfilling life.

“It matters less what you read,” he told me, emphasizing each word, “than how you take notes.” - from Rank and File — Real Life by Robert Minto Referenced to me from On a failed Zettelkasten by Robert Minto — Zettelkasten Forum three years ago.
Zettelkasting randomness and disorder, and how it is surprising that these lead to knowledge.
Things I'm reading:
Parrish, Shane. Clear thinking: turning ordinary moments into extraordinary results. 2023.
Garmus, Bonnie. Lessons in chemistry. 2022.
Tucci, Stanley. Taste: my life through food. 2021.
Music I'm listening to:
Keith Jarrett
Lissie
Japari Park
Jazz,  Jazz, and more Jazz.
★★★★★
The "My rolling ten-day zettel production" is produced by a script for attachment to my daily journaling template. I do my journaling in Bear to keep personal journaling separate from my knowledge work.
Let me know if you would like to discuss any of these notes.

Most of my books at the moment are in digital formal (kindle) that I turn to pdf or EPUB using calibre. I want to start acquiring physical books but in the short term this is what I got.
I’m looking for an app that lets me highlight and add notes or comments to the highlights I made. Using the barbell method of reading I’d read the book twice and the highlights would have the purpose of being visual cues of what I found relevant and why.
There are three options I have found (MacOS): Highlights, Skim and PDF Expert.
Which software do you use and recommend? If you could expand a little bit on your workflow it would be great.

 I've tried char-mode; semi-char-mode; line-mode. Text does get yanked into the buffer, but eat doesn't do anything with it. It doesn't fontify, the cursor remains in place, I can't edit the text, it won't be processed as a terminal command. After pressing ENTER, the yanked text moves to the next line with the cursor, but remains useless.
 What am I doing wrong here?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dear Zettlers,
I am in the process of restructuring my training regimen to align it with the new role of fitness in my life. (You can have a badly translated version of my last article here)
I am building an inventory of training stimuli for that. I am doing something similar like a factor analysis. For many years, for example, my aerobic endurance (roughly, what you normally associate with endurance if you are not into sports science) training was distributed over many different other training sessions that you'd normally not associate with aerobic endurance. Like that I could skip long sessions of running, biking etc. and use that freed up time and energy for other training while still having a solid aerobic base (for recovery between bouts of intensity and between exercise sessions).
I thought that I'd create something similar for knowledge work. Examples are items like reading physical books, attributes like screen time (to highlight a benefit of physical books over ebooks) or requirements like daily empty time slots (like my dog walks in which I do nothing, but just listen to the sound of the world).
So, what should be considered?
Live long and prosper

 I wrote the former based on what I have read in the docs here, but it still does not work as expected.
 I'm running Emacs 27.1 on a Pop!_Os system. Can anyone help me figure this out?

 Is there an analog to Haskells undefined or Elm's Debug.todo, allowing me to skip implementing functions while keeping the compiler happy? I just found an older Github issue suggesting this, but maybe I'm using the wrong queries in the internet search?
 I think type holes is not really what I want, as it kind of goes the opposite way around, right?

 The installation appears to complete without any errors, and I can initialise a Git repository using Magit without any problem. Staging files works too, but when it comes to commiting, I get an error which finishes:

 I've found a couple of references to others having a similar issue, but no solution listed, so before I contact the developers I thought I'd try Reddit.

 i am very new to emacs and org-mode. in fact i just finished watching the google talk by the creator.
 i found an app called Orgzly which seemed to work really well in the phone, and it even has a feature to set alarms. but it doesn't seem to work. 
 i put the time in the scheduling as well as in deadline but it seems to only triggers a notification.
 it's not a deal breaker and i could see my self replacing all my Obsidian notes to org. but i was just hoping to trigger an alarm so that i can plan EVERY PART OF MY DAY 😭😌
 thanks for the great software, and thanks for any help

 If you're tackling the tedious task of modeling language or country concepts and you're already utilising the Enumeratum library in your project, I'd suggest considering these two libraries: scala-iso-language and scala-iso-country. 
 They offer a minimalist and standardized approach and have some translation capabilities.

 so i just moved from neovim to emacs and loving it so far. but i’m having an issue configuring it to suit my workflow for python and django.
 so what i wanna do is replicate the workflow i’ve used in vim which is:
 configure pylsp with plugins pylsp-ruff and pylsp-mypy and then have isort and black handle formatting without lsp interference.
 and i also want to configure mypy globally in my config to check if there’s a (venv, poetry or conda) env active and and use that env’s python executable
 and bonus, if i could also get help setup a function to run django tests from emacs.
 i know my question seems like a tall order, but i’m really loving Emacs and doom and hope i could finally find a solution so that i’m able to stick with Emacs.

 In that light, I made a video showing how they are useful when taking notes. Specifically, I used ekg (my module in GNU ELPA) to come up with a way to get Aeropress recipes (Aeropress is, to me, kind of like the emacs of coffee brewing), and take notes how they taste. The video shows the entire process.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am currently testing PIKCHR, a modern take of the ancient PIC little language that generates diagram from textual input. PIKCHR outputs the diagrams as SVG files. However, when opening the files in Emacs (29.1, ) only an unfilled box (30x30 per mode-line information) is shown instead of the SVG files. Opening the same file in a browser (Brave), the diagram is shown. Also, when opening random SVG files found on the internet, they work perfectly in Emacs. Where to start finding the underlying issue?

 Because I am using GNU gettext I do have flake8 errors like this. I don't want to put an extra flake8 config file into the repo.
 I don't know how Emacs/eglo/pylsp do invoke flake8 in the back. Is there a way to inject '--builtins="_"' commandline option somewhere in there?
 *EDIT*: It seems that a ".flake8" file in the repos root folder is also ignored.
 [flake8] builtins = "_"

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I have a MBP 2019 16" Intel, 64GB, I9 and running Ventura 13.6.3.
 Intellij Idea is the latest version as of now, Build #IU-233.13135.103, built on December 19, 2023. I allocated max. 12GB to the VM running IntelliJ
 What I am experiencing?
 When I edit scala files in a small size Scala project (roughly 40 files, scala source code + few files generated from the play framework) using playframework 3 & anorm, basically IntelliJ goes nuts, i.e. the CPU usage goes up, the fans rpm go to the maximum (I run TG Pro) to the point where I cannot type continuously - I keep typing, and the characters don't show up for a few fractions of second, then they all appear at once. Clicking anywhere in the editor or in the user interface has a lag. I am using the default JDK that comes with IntelliJ. Cmd+Tab doesn't respond immediately, or it is frozen for a moment then the selection moves quickly a few more icons to right.
 I tried VS Codium + Metals to edit the same project and it is more responsive but I don't like it as much as IntelliJ.
 I also run a Windows 10 VM in desktop parallels and, believe it or not, I installed the same version of IntelliJ and it is more responsive than the mac version. I think I am going to continue on windows in the short term.
 I am just curious about few things if you don't mind sharing your experience:
  
do you use Intellij on Linux and if yes, what is the performance like, assuming that you don't run it on apple hardware?
 if you run IntelliJ on a newer mac with the apple CPU, what is the performance like?
 any suggestions/recommendations on how to improve the performance of IntelliJ on the mac?
  
And just a side note, because I read the MBP 2019 16" intel has some problems handling external monitors, I should mention I do use an external 4K Dell monitor, but I do not experience the problems described in this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlUmnVYPcKM .
 Thank you

 It allows everyone (since 2022, before that it was only students) to contribute to projects for a stipend. However, in order to do that, we need to have some ideas of what to contribute to.
 In the past, this has led to many improvements for GHC, Cabal, HLS, Hasktorch... and it can include your project as well! This is a great way to find contributors for your project (even after the summer ends) -- many past participants have become involved long-term.
 You can find more info and instructions on how to participate here: https://summer.haskell.org/ideas.html.

 In this case, Ruff reports two errors that don't exist: 1. ruff [E701]: Multiple statements on one line (colon) and 2. ruff [E999]: SyntaxError: Unexpected token Indent. "M-x eglot-reconnect" solves the problem.
 I want to report the problem but I'm not sure which component (Ruff, Flymake, Eglot, python-lsp-ruff or python-lsp) causes this problem. Any suggestions?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I don't know why but I am just having a really difficult time wrapping my head around the Emacs window manager. I can't seem to translate what I have in my head into code, which is an unusual and frustrating experience for me.
 What I'd like to do is, when I'm specifically working on a Python project, have my frame set up so that there's a main window with the buffer I'm working on, then to the right is a python REPL, and to the left is a switchable choice between an xrefs list and a directory tree. What I'd like to do is set up the position and sizing of all of these by mouse-dragging them to how I want them, then saving that configuration somehow. Then, crucially, having this configuration and sizing be entered when I visit a python buffer and python-mode launches, and exited back to "normal" emacs when I leave python-mode except in a couple of instances.
 Has anyone done something like this? If so, could you share your config? I don't know what it is about Emacs's window manager but each one of these requirements has so many moving pieces in different parts of the system that I just have trouble wrapping my head around the whole.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm developing an experimental musical score writer. For now I've only been working on the internal representation, but I'd like to start prototyping the graphical aspect, which I've never done on haskell.
 I'm asking for recommendations on libraries to create an interactive canvas: basically, a window where I can draw/update the score and click on different elements in it, and also receive keyboard input. Not a GUI in the sense of menus, widgets or anything of the sort; just an interactive canvas. 
 Now, if memory doesn't fail me:
 - the OpenGl bindings take mouse and keyboard events, but it's perhaps too low level.
 - the Cairo bindings are nicer to work with, but to put them on an interactive screen some Gtk lib was needed; but even with that, would I only receive mouse click coordinates? I don't mind writing some square object detection, but I wouldn't mind a simpler route if there was.
 - ability to import svgs would make my life easier, probably.

 At a single press of the F5 key -- or whatever you wish to make it too -- your project will be compiled. 
 I have examples for a number of languages -- Ruby, C++. Rust, Go -- but they are highly configurable and you can add your own.
 This works with your git projects. It will go to the root of your git project and execute the necessary commands to compile your entire project. Well documented with examples.
 If you hit the F6 key, you will be presented with the compile string that you can then edit on the fly.
 I should get this in Melpa. I tried a long while back, but the maintanier of Melpa insisted that I do a pull request instead with smart-compile, that schlau-compile is derived from. Except at that time I had made so many breaking changes a pull request would not have been feasible. And now? It has completely diverged, as I have added quite a few features and changed the workflow. It is its own project now, and I should approach Melpa again to include it separately.
 Let me know what you think!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Happy New Year!
I follow Sascha's advice to use object tags: https://zettelkasten.de/posts/object-tags-vs-topic-tags/
In the following note, I have used the object tags: "#good-technician #mediocre-boss #human-capital".
I often encounter this situation where I want to refer to a specific entity (e.g. a good technician), so I use adjectives to be specific about it. But I don't know if this is good practice. The other options I could use are:
use two tags: "#good #technician".
use only the core of the idea: "#technician".
What do you recommend me to do?
Because in this note, I just want to refer to good technicians (I don't want to talk about technicians in general). Therefore, I think that's the object to define with the tag. But I could be wrong :^)
# 202401060957 Turning a good technician into a mediocre boss destroys human capital
#good-technician #mediocre-boss #human-capital

In companies (public or private), one way to progress economically is to
acquire responsibility for the work of others: to move from being a technician
to being a boss.

However, the skills that define a good technician are different from those of
a good boss.

This causes many good technicians (motivated by economic incentives) to become
mediocre bosses: they do not have the skills needed to be good bosses.

For the company, this situation destroys human capital value: we have turned
a good technician into a mediocre boss.]]></summary>
