        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 Previously I had Java working with lsp-mode. Experimenting with tree-sitter recently has caused this to break.
 I'm using Emacs 29.2 on a Mac.
 My lsp-mode config is very basic:
 (use-package lsp-mode :ensure t :hook (lsp-mode . lsp-lens-mode) (lsp-mode . lsp-enable-which-key-integration) :config (setq lsp-prefer-flymake nil lsp-client-packages '(lsp-clients lsp-metals))) 
 And lsp-java:
 (use-package lsp-java :ensure t :init :config (add-hook 'java-mode-hook 'lsp) (add-hook 'java-ts-mode-hook 'lsp) (add-to-list 'lsp-language-id-configuration '(java-ts-mode . "java"))) 
 However, when I open a Java file I get:
  
LSP :: There are no language servers supporting current mode java-ts-mode' registered withlsp-mode'.
  
Clearly the major mode is different with tree-sitter, it's now 'java-ts-mode'. Looking in lsp-java.el though, I do see this in the 'lsp-register-client' function:
  :major-modes '(java-mode java-ts-mode jdee-mode) 
 There is obviously something else I'm missing. Any help is appreciated.

 (defun my-compile () (interactive) (let* ((current-window (selected-window)) (compile-buffer (get-buffer-create "*compilation*")) (compile-buffer-window (get-buffer-window compile-buffer))) (if compile-buffer-window (progn (delete-window compile-buffer-window) (kill-buffer compile-buffer)) (let* ((compile-window-height (/ (window-total-height) 4)) (compile-command (read-from-minibuffer "Compile command: "))) (select-window (split-window-below (- compile-window-height))) (switch-to-buffer compile-buffer) (select-window current-window) (compile compile-command))))) (global-set-key (kbd "C-c C-c") 'my-compile) 
 However, when I'm in a python file, this bind doesn't run correctly: python-shell-get-process-or-error: Start a Python process first with M-x run-python or ‘C-c C-p’
 But if I run the default emacs compile: M-x compile It works correctly, why? Is there a way to make this function of mine behave the same way as the native emacs compile? I like how it turned out because it doesn't open a large buffer and it makes it much easier when I want to run a file.

 2nd : night mode, invert image(chromatic image)

 since 2nd 3rd option's difference is only on images
 It may be possible to not invert image.

 But somehow it's not working. The original behavior remains....
 What is the trick then?

 I see it takes three arguments, the first is a function, the second the accumulator, and the third a list. Then the result is of type b. Could someone decipher, first, why the function uses two type variables a and b? If the function is binary commutative addition (+), why can't the description just be (a -> a -> a)? And the accumulator is type b, again, why not just type a? And what is being indicated by t a? The Foldable t means t must be a type for which Foldable has an instance. Again, why this t a notation?

For example, I tried to change the background color of the PROJ heading, but it does not seem to change no matter what. I also tried running the svg-lib-demo.org, but it did not change the colors.
 ;; TODO / DONE ("TODO" . ((lambda (tag) (svg-tag-make "TODO" :face 'org-todo :inverse t :margin 0)))) ("NEXT" . ((lambda (tag) (svg-tag-make "NEXT" :face 'org-todo :inverse t :margin 0)))) ("PROJ" .

 I also noticed that the text in the icons is a little above and not centered. I was wondering if anyone had been able to figure out how to correct this in vanilla emacs.

At first, I didn't like it too. I found it weird, since the first language that I had contact with was C and it is much different from Haskell. Besides, my teacher wasn't a good professor, so this made things worse. But instead of saying that this language is useless, I decided to give it a chance, since there might be a reason I'm supposed to learn it. After that, I end up enjoying Haskell and started viewing it as a new tool and a different approach to solve problems. I told my friends that I would continue to learn Haskell and read books about it during vacation time, and they laughed at me, told me that it is useless, that I'm just wasting my time, that Haskell has no real life application and that I should learn Java if I wanna get a job (we'll learn Java next semester). I felt discouraged because I DO wanna get a job. My mom works very hard so I can only study, and I want as soon as I can be able to financially help her (or at least help her a bit). What I am asking is if learning Haskell will help me in the future somehow or am I just being naive?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You can download binaries for this pre-release from: Release rc/v2.15.6.1 · commercialhaskell/stack · GitHub.
 Please test it and let us know at the Stack repository if you run into any trouble. If all goes well, we hope to release the final version soon, as the changes are made to allow a released version of Stack to build with the coming GHC 9.10.
 Release notes:
  
This release fixes potential bugs.
  
Changes since v2.15.5:
 Major changes: 
  
Stack 2.15.5 and earlier cannot build with Cabal (the library) version 3.12.0.0. Stack can now build with that Cabal version.
  
Behaviour changes: 
  
Stack’s StackSetupShim executable, when called with repl and stack-initial-build-steps, no longer uses Cabal’s replHook to apply initialBuildSteps but takes a more direct approach.
  
Bug fixes:
  
Fix a regression introduced in Stack 2.15.1 that caused a ‘no operation’ stack build to be slower than previously.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After I previously enabled treesitter imenu support and rewrote the simple imenu configuration variables, I decided I wanted to tinker a bit more and produce more hierarchical results.
 The two images are before on the left vs afterwards on the right.
 Note the constructors, methods, inner classes are placed as items under the class. I also discovered the builtin rules misclassified enums nodetype and fixed that as well. Finally, although I normally adjust the faces to all black/gray I've left it at the default to highlight something odd about the treesitter node creation code. Based on some unknown code path about half the time the node names come with the original properties including faces and the rest of the time they are plain text.
 Some sample in progress code.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In my daily work I often work for clients that need me to track and report my time based on what exactly I did in a project. Like Meetings, coding feature x, writing documentation, ... On the other hand my employer has a project which is just assigned to the project I do for the customer. So it is basically a hierarchy with two levels:
 * TODO employer project ** TODO customer Meetings ** TODO customer Coding ** TODO customer Documenting 
 So at the end of the day I need to tell the customer the more granular times and the employer the overall times.
 What I want to have is a feature where I clock in on the customer todos but can also see a daily aggregation on the employer todo. How could I do that in org mode?
 It would be also awesome if I could have the customer todos in a different file and just "backlink" them to the employer todo which is in its own separate file

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, I'm hoping you might be able to help me out with this. My sister was diagnosed with a progressive auto-immune disease not to long ago. To simplify things, she has started to develop arthritis-like symptoms that will get progressively worse, and she will lose her vision over time. 
 She's not very technical, but I know there are a lot of interesting ergonomics modes like xah-fly-keys, or even just spacemacs style bindings with a leader key. I'd love some recommendations for relatively easy to learn ergonomics systems that might be less intimidating to newer users. Right now I'm leaning towards spacemacs because that seems the easiest way for someone who would probably be pretty put off by editing an init.el right out of the gate. 
 I also thought that over time she could augment this with speech to text as well as text to speech. I know that there are a number of emacs tools like emacsspeak, but I remember seeing a video on youtube where someone had some hooks into a google text to speech library, and was using ai to send audio clips to chat gpt.If that rings a bell for anyone, please let me know what they were using. I haven't been able to find it, but I'd love any other recommendations or thoughts there as well. 
 Anyway, thanks in advance!

Ignoring "high level" declarative functions such as seq-filter, what's the best way to build a list step by step? AFAIK, each call to append takes O(n) where n is the numbers of elements in the list. Also keeping a reference of the last cons of the list in order to nconc it might be frowned upon, as it is a destructive operation.

 Last question, 
 if you were to become a scala developer now, would you invest much time into quirks and features of scala, or would you spend more time to become a badass data engineer with more tools (pyspark, cloud, kubernetes, kafka [architecture wise])

Things seem to work and it is really doing a good job so far! My only issue is, if I try to "go to definition" of one of the builtin classes or the ones that are provided from maven, it doesn't go there as expected. For instance, `import picocli.CommandLine.Command` if the cursor is on Command and I try to go to definition, it just doesn't go there and the minibuffer highlights the Command part for a second. The same thing for the java builtin methods. such as System.out.println. Is there a way to make them work?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all! 
 I've had this bug for some time now, this is what I've got:
 symptom: in the shell, when asked for password, prompt shows in minibuffer, then quits a second or two later (while I'm typing said password) leading to only the later half of my password being typed in clear text. 
 comint-watch-for-password-prompt runs comint-send-invisible in a (run-at-time 0 nil ...). If I replace run-at-time by the lambda content it is supposed to run, no more bug. If I replace 0 by 1 or 0.1, no more bug either. For values under 0.01 bug is back.
 If I add "lol" at the end of comint-watch-for-password-prompt, so that run-at-time's cancelable timer is not returned to the caller, the bug still happens, so... it's not quitting because somebody is canceling the timer. 
 So, what do I with this? 
 for reference, here is the function I'm talking about:
 (defun comint-watch-for-password-prompt (string) "Prompt in the minibuffer for password and send without echoing. Looks for a match to `comint-password-prompt-regexp' in order to detect the need to (prompt and) send a password. Ignores any carriage returns (\\r) in STRING. This function could be in the list `comint-output-filter-functions'." (when (let ((case-fold-search t)) (string-match comint-password-prompt-regexp (string-replace "\r" "" string))) ;; Use `run-at-time' in order not to pause execution of the ;; process filter with a minibuffer (run-at-time 0.1 nil (lambda (current-buf) (with-current-buffer current-buf (let ((comint--prompt-recursion-depth (1+ comint--prompt-recursion-depth))) (if (> comint--prompt-recursion-depth 10) (message "Password prompt recursion too deep") (when (get-buffer-process (current-buffer)) (comint-send-invisible (string-trim string "[ \n\r\t\v\f\b\a]+" "\n+"))))))) (current-buffer))))

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Let's say I have a record type like
 data PosInt = PosInt { getInt :: Int } 
 and I want to maintain some invariance about it. Here, that the wrapped Int is always positive (I know in this example I could also use a newtype but bear with me). So (I guess?) the standard approach would be to not expose the type constructor, so only the current module can construct instances of type PosInt. However, I still want to give read access to the wrapped Int, so I want to expose getInt. I might end up with something like:
 module Lib ( PosInt(getInt), setInt) where data PosInt = PosInt { getInt :: Int } setInt :: Int -> Maybe PosInt setInt x | x > 0 = Just (PosInt x) | otherwise = Nothing 
 Now if I try to construct a PosInt outside this module, the type checker complains:
 import Lib ( PosInt(..) ) test1 :: PosInt test1 = PosInt (-3) -- type error 
 So far so good. But given a PosInt I can actually violate my invariance using the getInt field:
 import Lib ( PosInt(..) ) test2 :: PosInt -> PosInt test2 x = x { getInt = -3 } -- no type error 
 That caught me a bit off guard. It's not a problem if I define getInt "manually":
 data PosInt = PosInt Int getInt :: PosInt -> Int getInt (PosInt x) = x 
 Maybe I misunderstood the role of record fields. This convention of calling them getSomething gave me the impression that they only give read access.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[tldr: Don't upgrade your tree-sitter library, otherwise Emacs will crash when loading it. If you've already upgraded tree-sitter, either a) roll back to v0.22.2, or b) rebuild Emacs. If you use a package manager, uninstalling and reinstalling Emacs should rebuild Emacs.
 The latest version of tree-sitter library is binary-incompatible with the previous version, but the ABI version remains unchanged. That means package managers will simply replace the old libtree-sitter.so file with the new one. Then when Emacs runs, this binary-incompatible libtree-sitter.so is loaded and crashes Emacs.
 What should've happened is for tree-sitter to bump the ABI version; then package managers would install the new libtree-sitter.so file alongside the old libtree-sitter.so, rather than replacing it. And Emacs will still load the old libtree-sitter.so. 
 Rebuilding Emacs will resolve this issue since Emacs and tree-sitter remain compatible on the source level. Rebuild the Emacs binary and it'll be compatible with the new tree-sitter binary.

 I checked the widget library in emacs and I would like to know what is the concern about use this library ?
 Nobody who write a new mode/package use the widgets.
 I think to use this library for the setting it is reasonable but every package creator prefer the "code" based setting.
 I know I can use the customize-variable to set a variable but to create a custom page with widget to setup a module/mode/function should be a good point for the newbies.
 Is there a plan to use GTK based widget in the future ? :)

(elpaca-use-package-mode)) ;; Without this, have to add ":ensure t" to most recipes to get them to install, ;; otherwise elpaca just tries to load it. (setq use-package-always-ensure t) ;;; Use latest org-mode. Do this early, to use when loading config (use-package org :mode (("\\.org$" . org-mode)) :commands (org-mode org-babel-load-file) :config (require 'org-mouse) :ensure nil) ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;; ;;; Load main emacs-config.org ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;; (org-babel-load-file (concat user-emacs-directory "emacs-config.org"))

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm currently trying to rely more on emacs for file browsing and stumbled upon the openwith package. It allows the user to specify which programs to use for opening which file types, and the choice is respected by find-file and dired-find-file. This is super useful as there are some file types which I never want to open in emacs. 
 The following config is more or less taken from github and tells emacs to open "doc", "xls", ... with "libreoffice":
 (use-package openwith :config (setq openwith-associations (list (list (openwith-make-extension-regexp '("doc" "xls" "ppt" "odt" "ods" "odg" "odp")) "libreoffice" '(file)) )) :init (openwith-mode 1)) 
 Unfortunately, it requires me to explicitly specify which program to use for which file and does not seem to work when I replace "libreoffice" with "xdg-open". Does anybody know why or whether there are any alternative packages that do something similar but work with xdg-open?

 How can I do this in an efficient way via org-ql (I can use rgrep to achieve something similar)? 
 Using org-ql-search interactively allows me to choose "all" files/directories, which is too broad. There doesn't seem to be universal argument support, so I can't pass the directory via "C-u".
 I've also tried the org-roam-ql package, but for whatever reason, this doesn't seem able to return the correct results -- maybe all the nodes have to be proper Org-roam nodes, with a corresponding org-id?

I have been able to track this down to whenever I use a treesitter based major mode, not just `js-ts-mode`. I don't know if this was caused by me updating my packages or something else (I am using Void Linux btw). Any idea how to resolve this issue?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[TLDR: I'm trying to change the color of the cursor according to the enabled theme, but the color of the cursor don't change when I start Emacs.
 Just to give a little of context I'm a web dev an currently working with a lot of css code. Emacs has a css-mode that change the background of the face of color codes meaning a { background-color: #fff } will have the #fff with a white background (just like the rainbow-mode package does). 
 The thins is that my cursor often get lost in certain color and I don't like that so I decided to write a little of elisp to fix this (realice that a white or black cursor does the job). Also forgot to mention that I switch a lot between dark and light themes so I figure that I need to change the cursor color according to that. Doing my research came across to this https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/modus-themes/A-theme_002dagnostic-hook-for-theme-loading.html and this helped me to do the part of calling the function to change the color when I change of theme. 
 Everything work fine until I restart Emacs or open Emacs for the first time (like when I turn on my computer on my job) because the color of the cursor don't change when Emacs start so I'm a little lost here and I'm not sure if I missing something. 
 Also I'm checking the *messages* buffers and appears that the function load correctly so.... 
 Here is the code I'm using:
 (defvar after-enable-theme-hook nil "Hook to run after enabling a theme.") (defun run-after-enable-theme-hook (&rest _args) "Run `after-enable-theme-hook'." (message "executin hook after-enable-theme-hook") (run-hooks 'after-enable-theme-hook) (let* ((color-mode (frame-parameter nil 'background-mode)) (cursor-color (if (eq color-mode 'dark) "red" nil))) (set-face-attribute 'cursor nil :background cursor-color))) (advice-add 'enable-theme :after #'run-after-enable-theme-hook) 
 (load-theme 'gruvbox-dark-hard)

 lemmy RSS feeds (such as "https://lemmy.ml/feeds/c/emacs.xml") often (but not always) have mis-guided "Link:" elements which target an external link, an image file or other material instead of the lemmy post itself. Consequently, hitting 'b' elfeed-search-browse-url may send one on a surprising if not always useful journey.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello Scala people, I'm currently writing tests for some http4s routes for a "pet" project, I'm using the default dependencies that came in from the http4s library scala 3 starter so I'm using MUnit + Munit-cats-effect. I needed to "mock" PetAlgebra as petRoutes is using it.
 My questions are:
  
I'm using Mockito-core as ScalaMock doesn't work with Munit and that is not a "me problem". Does the regular mockito get used along with the typelevel stack or I've just hacked up something.
 Why would I use MUnit over ScalaTest, from what I gather it's a matter of preferrence, some say code using cats-effect is easier to test via MUnit, but ScalaTest integrations with that too
 Would this method pass a PR? It does the job, but it feels like I pigeonholed java style into Scala and it looks clunky, how/do I have to change it to be idiomatic FP
  
​
 test("GET /pet/:id should return 200 and pet JSON when found") { val expectedPet = Pet(/*not important*/) val mockPetAlgebra = mock(classOf[PetAlgebra[IO]]) when(mockPetAlgebra.read(1)).thenReturn( IO.pure(Right(expectedPet)) ) val expectedJson = petDeepEncoder(expectedPet) val petRoutes = PetclinicRoutes.petRoutes[IO](mockPetAlgebra) val request = Request[IO](Method.GET, uri"/pet/1") for responseOpt <- petRoutes.run(request).value response <- IO.fromOption(responseOpt)( new NoSuchElementException("Expected a response") ) respJson <- response.as[Json] yield assertEquals(respJson, petDeepEncoder(expectedPet)) assertEquals(response.status, Status.Ok) } 
 Thanks in advance

 Could someone point out where the problems are in the code? Also, why does the `while` block never seem to stop? 
 (I noticed that emacs returns the last return value (as opposed to python where the first `return value` defines the value a function returns. I wonder if this is related, but haven't gotten across.)
 Thank you very much.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The job market, as I'm sure we all know, is dire right now, so I was thinking of picking up another language (other than Scala) to help market myself further. That being said, I can't seem to bring myself anymore to use a language that uses if-statements rather than if-expressions. However I'm not so far into the deep end of Scala that I feel the need to F[_] everything up.
 So while I hope the Scala market picks back up in the future, what alternative languages with jobs are there in the meantime, that I might feel comfortable with?

However, I'm encountering an issue: the info message doesn't appear correctly when I run my code on clusters with primary and secondary nodes. Strangely, it works fine during unit testing, but a lot of info output without SparkContext.parallelize related function on the clusters.
 I've experimented with using `foreachPartition` or `foreach`, but these changes impact other subsequent logic. Can anyone provide some keywords or guidance for reference? Debugging code involving `SparkContext.parallelize` efficiently can be challenging. Thank you!
 Below is example by scala 2
 val RDDResult: RDD[Row] = SparkContext.parallelize(ID,10).mapPartitions(
 ID =>{logger.info("show the message 1)

 logger.info("show the message 2)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm interested in how the workflow for many of you is. I'm realizing that i'm doing more and more things inside emacs and struggle to find a balance of what i want keybinds for. Some stuff is super obvious, like `project-find-file` or Window navigation. But with Org-Mode, Roam/Denote, Magit, Dired and Terminal things, i'm not sure how many functions i want to bind to keybinds.
 Thing is, keybinds are only quicker, if you remember them. If you need to search through which-key, just `M-x` and searching is faster. So, do you tend to create keybinds for most things in the packages you use? Or just for the one or two things you use multiple times a day and search for the rest?
 Additionally, maybe someone can give me a hint if this is possible: Can i come up with a sort of "custom Command Palette"? So, like `M-x` but it should only contain commands is specifiy? I find that with things like consult or other packages, searching `M-x` can be hard, when a package provides tens of interactive commands.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Can someone please help me tame expand-region?
 You know, the package that lets you mark, expand and contract the expansion?
 This is what I want, I want it to start expanding in this order:
  
First select the word
 Then select until the end of line
 Then if the cursor initially was not at the beginning of the line, I want it to mark the whole line,
 then paragraph, etc. etc.
  
The way how it's usually achieved is by setting "mode expansions", i.e.,:
  (defun er/add-mode-expansions () (setq-local er/try-expand-list '(er/mark-word er/mark-eol er/mark-bol er/mark-paragraph .... ))) (er/enable-mode-expansions 'text-mode 'er/add-mode-expansions) 
 What I see is happening is that it often skips the first step, immediately proceeding to the selection until the end of line.
 Ideally (I think), I'd like it to mark the word, then next adjacent word right after, then to the end of line, and so forth. But first, I need to figure out the simple one. 
 Why is it skipping the first step?
  
Additional notes:
 er/mark-word and er/mark-paragraph are defined in expand-region code. er/mark-eol and er/mark-bol are my custom functions, and they seem to be working just fine, at least when they are called directly, and not via er/expand-region. Interestingly, er/mark-word is also doing what you expect, when called independently. But when it's called as a mode-expansion, expand-region often skips it (unless the cursor initially is at the exact beginning of the word).

I'd like to start using org-mode to create meeting agendas for various status and tagup meetings I attend with my boss and other team-mates working on projects. To date, my LaTEX/PDF exports tend to look more like term papers with bullet lists instead of paragraphs of text, so I end up cutting/pasting into MS Word to get simple lists of topics and action items to status. 
 Does anyone have a recommended template or workflow for preparing itemized lists of topics to discuss at meetings? I've found several templates for capturing meeting minutes, but my needs are slightly different than that. I'm looking for a titled document with a date and simple two-column bulleted lists - perhaps including a table, graphic, etc.?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 I am a new emacs user so please bear with me. I was setting up org-roam so I can have all my files from different categories linked if there is a relationship. For example, if I have a journal entry that talked about a philosophical topic in application to my life, I want it to link to one of my studies of that topic that is part of the philosophy category. Essentially, I want to map my brain. 
 In order to keep my files organized, I was planning on keeping my files for each topic in a completely separate directories from the Org-roam directory. I would have an org file in the Org-roam directory that links to that particular file and if there is a relationship, I would just link the org files in the Org-roam directory. In other words, the org files in the Org-roam directory simply contains links to the actual files in my file system and serves as the linker. 
 To organize my files in my file system, I plan on using the denote package for its file naming scheme.
 How does this setup sound? Are there any better setup designs that you can recommend? I was thinking about just using denote, but I like the org-roam-ui and I would like to keep everything in separate dirs. However, if this setup is not feasible then I might do that instead.
 Thanks!

 Bluefin's API differs from all prior effect systems in that it implements a "well typed Handle/Services pattern". That is, all effects are accessed through value-level handles, which makes it trivial to mix a wide variety of effects, including:
  
Bluefin.EarlyReturn, for early return
 Bluefin.Exception, for exceptions
 Bluefin.IO, for I/O
 Bluefin.State, for mutable state
 Bluefin.Stream, for streams
  
If you're interested then read the Introduction to Bluefin. I'd love to know what you all think.

 That book recommends Emacs for Clojure, and I decided to give it a spin. It also provides some config files for Emacs, here: https://nostarch.com/clojure
 It's looking good so far - I vastly prefer keybindings and typing commands than clicking on GUIs (and I sort of already do that with my current "IDE" of choice, VSCode), but there are a few features that I'm missing
 Auto-complete, for example: how do I get that?
 Also symbol renaming is so very useful - by symbol renaming I mean how in VSCode you can press F2 on a function or variable name, type in a new name, then the variable/function will be renamed everywhere within the project, in a context-sensitive way - so, for example, if I have a poorly name function named, idk, getVars, I can F2 that function, type in getUserPreferences and everywhere that function is used in any other file within the project will be renamed
 Is that something that Emacs can do in a reasonable way? (e.g. without me having to write a lengthy program)
 EDIT: What an awesome community! Thanks for answers, folks!

 The change affects all the frames I have up at the time and both, GUI and terminal Emacs.
 I don't remember this happening before - how do I go finding what is going on? I am sure it is possible but I do not know where to start.
 OK, it seems that the keys work but the menu that shows all the kebindings no longer works - in case this helps anybody.

 What I want to do in this post is to document a bit better how templates work.
 First of all, a bit of context. Templates in org roam piggyback on org templates. Let us use the example from the org-roam manual:

But know that I appreciate you allowing me to rage against the machine for a few minutes. At very least it'll stop me chucking my laptop out the nearest open window.
 So, as well as reading docs, trying code, and my usual flailing about as I learn Org and lisp, I admit that I am not averse to also seeing what ChatGPT has to say on a topic. Today it was on the use of properties in calculations, in particular table formulae, and using org-entry-get-multivalued-property and the like.
 After some back and forth -- and one thing I am impressed with…]]></summary>

 This shell command will....
  
Copy all files in your specific original_dir to a new_dir to preserve your Obsidian .md files in case of an error.
 Add PROPERTIES, ID, END, title, and filetags at the very start of the file. 
 If you plan on using #+filetags, you'll need to run this separately for each tag(s) you want to add.
 
 Rename an .md file "Text1 Text2 Text3.md" to "text1_text2_text3-lastModifiedTimestamp.org." 
 Note that the title added to the file is separated from the renaming process after removing the .md extension, so it stays as e.g., "Text1 Text2 Text3."

 I was checking out the new gears library (https://lampepfl.github.io/gears/) . I noticed that scala.js is not supported. I understand that Scala native is using the newly developed delimited continuations support, and the JVM version, the new virtual threads. 
 As JS is single threaded, I wonder if that makes it impossible to implement gears on it, or it requires some new feature that is not yet there, or there are just not enough resources to do it right now... so, do you know why ScalaJS is not supported by gears?

I'm finding this one a bit of a head scratcher!
  
I have made no changes to the build script that might have impacted this (aside from various since-reverted attempts to fix it)
 The build environment doesn't appear to have changed between the last successful build and the first failure (same emacs version, same ubuntu version, etc)
 It works fine locally
 I get the same warning when attempting to use elpa-mirror.
  
I would greatly appreciate any thoughts/suggestions! If nothing works I can just clone and manually install the necessary package but I would much prefer to solve this issue.

 And I miss this feature: when I checkout a local branch in Magit by pressing b l, I am presented with a list of branches to choose from. And this list is sorted alphabetically (it seems). I wish it was sorted in the LRU manner instead.
 How would I approach this? Must this be done by Magit? Or is it the feature of either vertico or embark which I use? But I still would need to supply them a branch modification time somehow...
 Any pointers on where to go from here?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In http://gem.librehacker.com/gemlog/starlog/20240418-0.gmi Christopher Howard talks about segregating Roam nodes into different areas, perhaps by project. He provides some code to select different Roam setups. I'm responding here as Christopher doesn't provide a way to reply or comment.
 I have segregated my Roam data into two areas, work and personal. My Roam settings on my work laptop are for the work Roam data:
 (custom-set-variables ;; custom-set-variables was added by Custom. ;; If you edit it by hand, you could mess it up, so be careful. ;; Your init file should contain only one such instance. ;; If there is more than one, they won't work right. . . . '(org-roam-directory "/home/davemarq/org/roam/" nil nil "Customized with use-package org-roam") 
 My personal Roam data is in a directory pers I synch between work and home via Github. I use this personal Roam database at work too. To set my roam directory for this area, I use directory local settings in pers/.dir-locals.el:
 ((nil . ((org-roam-db-location . "~/pers/org-roam/org-roam.db") (org-roam-directory . "~/pers/org-roam")))) 
 I'm not a user of project or projectile, but I suspect one could also set these variables per project using mechanisms provided by project or projectile.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm using PragamataPro Mono Liga font, using the ligature.el library by Mickey Petersen to display ligatures. The double pipe || ligature causes the current line height to increase and causes the next line to move down slightly as shown in this gif:
 https://cdn.zappy.app/87bee52262a7d88cc60b5a596339cca1.gif
 It does not happen with other ligatures, nor with other fonts I've tried. So it could be a problem with this font, although the ligature displays correctly in VS Code. The combination of Emacs, this font, and this ligature causes the problem.
 Although as mentioned I'm using ligature.el, I reproduced the above gif more simply using emacs -q and this elisp:
 (set-char-table-range composition-function-table t '(["||" 0 font-shape-gstring])) (set-face-attribute 'default nil :family "PragmataPro Mono Liga") 
 Increasing `line-spacing` does not help. 
 Any ideas as to a workaround? Visually it's a little annoying. Thanks!

 With a compiled init.el file, I'm finding that use-package-always-defer isn't working the way it ought to. At the beginning of my init, I have this:
 (setq use-package-always-defer (not (daemonp)) use-package-always-demand (daemonp))) 
 However, I find that packages still get eagerly loaded. The only way I have found to change this is to replace with the following:
 (eval-when-compile (setq use-package-always-defer t)) 
 Can anyone explain what's going on here?

In any case I want to make sure that I have the basic idea down correctly.
I searched for other posts on this but I didn't feel like I found a really conclusive answer. People seem to have different ideas, some expressed more strongly than others.
As far as I currently understand it, a Literature Note is a summary of any concept or idea that comes from a source other than yourself. Books will be a regular source, but audio, video, personal conversations, etc. technically could as well. The Literature Note should have some kind of way to identi…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been having a weird issue w/ org-mode for a while now. I have a giant org file (~3 megs) with tons of nested headlines, and every so often when I'm zooming around one of them won't expand. Other nearby headlines will still expand, but this one won't.
 I can get around the issue by deleting the collapsed headline and whatever subtree is underneath it, then yanking it back, right where it was. Once I do that, I can expand it just fine, and I won't have the problem again for days. I can't figure out any commonalities as to why this happens. I think it's happened across multiple versions of emacs (running 29.2 now) and org (9.6.25) but because I am a dumbass, I was not exhaustive in tracking the first appearance.
 I doubt anybody will be able to diagnose the issue from what I've written here, so diagnosis isn't what I'm after. What I'm after is this: could someone tell me how to get whatever contextual info would be most relevant to debug it properly, next time it happens? Then I can come back and have a chance of figuring it out.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have read in the manual that SCHEDULED is supposed to be the start time when one will start working on a meeting. However, it's pretty convenient to use a time range (using the commands that org-mode supports to manipulate the SCHEDULED timestamp is very convenient). Also, query languages like org-mode's internal language and org-ql support querying the SCHEDULED time specifically. 
 Using ranges with SCHEDULED is widespread.
 Would it make sense to change SCHEDULED to mean the time when one will work on a task? (either start working on it, if it's not a range, or spend working on it, if it's a range).

 I work in big data space (data engineering), I mainly used Java, Scala and Python.
 I have been learning functional programming in greater depth and I found this Python library which seems pretty cool.
 https://github.com/dry-python/returns
 I've used it at work for implementing an Either based error handling.
 It seems a great library.
 Any of you have used it?
 Any thoughts?
 For sure, I prefer doing FP in Scala but given the job market isn't too kind too Scala and FP languages in general. What are your thoughts to bring FP (at least parts of it) to the Python world?
 Some people in the TypeScript world seem to take that direction:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone, first of all I would like to say a huge thank you to everyone who has contributed to this forum. I've been here for a while now reading all sorts of posts, but only now did I need to create an account for the sake of joining the discussion.
I'll just briefly introduce myself, my name is Petr and I'm 20 years old, I love fitness, biohacking and anything that improves a person's mental/physical performance and especially health in general. I guess that's about me.
Now for the interesting stuff. This is probably going to be a very direct question, but how do I include in a permanent note the studies that the text or some statement in it discusses? I was thinking of putting a letter or number at the end of a sentence the normal way, but then I wonder if that would interfere with the note itself. Or should I leave the references to the literature note?
Example from today:
How do you guys approach this?
My goal is to create content on social media as well as developing my knowledge.
I apologize for the probably vague question, I still have a lot to learn.
Thank you!
Petr]]></summary>

But curiously I haven't found an explicit definition of what is meant by this word. Most of the time it seems interchangeable with 'monad'. I also have the impression is that the word 'effect' is used when talking about managing a program's control flow.
 Is it the case that effects are about control flow? Are all effects representable with monads, and do all monads potentially model effects?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am trying to change how isearch works. What I want is to be able to type in my search string, hit "RET", and then be able use abbreviated characters for different behavior, such as "n" for isearch-repeat-foreward, "p" for isearch-repeat-backwards, "o" for isearch-occur, etc. I want to also be able to switch back to normal isearch with something like "i" so I can modify my search string. What I tried was to create a custom minor mode that would change the keybindings to what I want. From my understanding, since this mode is more recently added to minor-mode-alist and minor-mode-map-alist, the bindings in my-isearch-mode-map should take higher precedence than isearch-mode-map. However, when I define it and activate it, isearch bindings still function like the default.
 Here is the link to my code. Be warned, it is not pretty as this is my first time writing a minor mode.
 What am I missing? Is there a better way to do this? I want to avoid hacky solutions to the best of my ability and I don't want to have to go down to route of trying (and probably failing) to remake isearch just to get this one thing to work.
 I am open to suggestions on other packages as well. Currently I am using swiper primarily for search, however I want to start using isearch because of its integration with other emacs functionality like occur-mode. It is also built into emacs which is also a plus.
 Any help is appreciated, thank you in advance.

 Eglot-rename does not seem to work with this. I don't know if there is a way in AucTeX, other than maybe writing a customized function. I am trying to avoid that since it is an in-built function in Vim or TexStudio.
 Any help would be useful. Thanks a lot.
 PS: I am using texlab as LSP server for LaTeX with eglot.

 I have tried to rename the application in the Info.plist file.
 I have been successful changing the CFBundleIdentifier. But when I change the CFBundleName, this change does not take effect. Does anybody know how I can change the name of the running Emacs (even if it involves recompilation of the binary)?

In place of what should have been a buffer for org-agenda-list is a seemingly random buffer.
 Apparently desktop-buffer-mode-handlers can add support for Org Agenda buffers but I don't see an e.g. org-agenda-restore-buffer so I guess on would need to use a custom function? I don't know much programming so hoping someone has found a solution for this.
 I also looked into activities.el but it looks like each "activity" is a frame/tab, but for my workflow with a tiling window manager I find it more suitable to liberally create and destroy frames from my window manager's workspaces and for now at least am just looking for a way to restore all buffers/frames/window configuration without the need to create and switch projects. Actually activities.el might be suitable if an activity includes a set a frames. I prefer dealing with frames than Emac's window management because I often work with at least a browser alongside in a window manager workspace and it's just less cognitive overhead to treat each buffer as a frame when the rest of your applications are also managed by the window manager.

It lists Applicatives that fail their laws, in different ways.
 So far, I have found Applicatives that fail the following sets of laws:
  
Id
 Id, Comp
 Id, Comp, Inter
 Id, Comp, Homo
 Id, Comp, Homo, Inter
 Id, Homo
 Id, Homo, Inter

But I had trouble triggering only failing the Composition law, or the Homomorphism law. Or only the Identity and Interchange laws, and so on.

I created my first Cabal package, https://github.com/aaditmshah/hledger-check-postings, and pushed it to GitHub. Since I'm a complete noob, I'm looking for guidance on improving the package and publishing it to Hackage. I would appreciate it if you would look at my code and tooling, and suggest improvements by creating new GitHub issues or starting new GitHub discussions. For example, I want to add unit tests, Haddock documentation, and continuous integration via GitHub actions. I also want to publish my executable on Hackage so that it's easier to discover and install. Furthermore, I would love to automate process of bumping the version number, updating the changelog, and publishing a new version to Hackage via continuous deployment. Finally, I would love to hear all the tips and counsel that you Haskell veterans have to offer, both here and on GitHub issues or GitHub discussions.

 Pretty new to the language (and functional programming more generally) so not sure on what I’m missing here but I can’t figure out the proper way of exception handling in Scala.
 So as I understand it an Option or an Either should be used most of the time to produce a None or an alternate value in the Left of the Either. Then exceptions should be thrown only in rare circumstances as they are a side effect?
 If that’s correct then:
  
How do you evaluate that the circumstance is right for an exception to be thrown?
 
What are the alternative values you provide instead of an exception that can keep the program running?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As my first Halogen application has just surpassed 3K lines of Purescript code, and contains several components that communicate with and through each other, -I am starting to wish that I had some sort of visual 'map' to navigate the relationship between my components.
 This is where I got the idea that what if we could simply invoke a function on the 'root' component and then the function would output something like 'plantUML' which then can be compiled to a diagram. In theory all the required information to generate the diagram is contained in the type information for all the Halogen components.
 Being relatively new to Purescript, I don't have any clear idea how this could be achieved. But roughly I am thinking that since Purescript is quite weak on the metaprogramming side of things, one would probably have to exploit some FFI and JS to extract the information required to generate the diagram.
 For now I will probably just manually create my visual 'map' with plantUML since I am busy on my own project, however I just wanted to throw the idea out there. Perhaps I will work on it in the future, or perhaps someone else will like the idea and work on it.
 In any case it would be cool to hear from more experienced Purescript programmers whether or not this is possible and how it could be accomplished. I personally think it would be quite awesome to be able to generate visual overviews like that.

Its bloody good package, but I don't need 99% of what comes with it ( which now I realize I really miss :'( ). I am making my config from scratch and I really need some help with making org-mode work the way i want. 
  
This is my primary issue (Image) . Notice how the text in lists wraps right under the its number. I want it to align with the text block (marked in red).
 In Doom Emacs whenever my cursor was on a list item that entire item would be highlighted. How do I replicate this?
 Where can I find all the commands I can use to customize org-mode? I did not find this in the manual, or am I not looking hard enough?
  
I am using emacs 29 (the crafted emacs config) on Mac OS.
 PS - Indent mode and other relevant options are enabled
 Thank you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone. I'm fairly new to emacs I'm using emacs 29.1, I do web development with typescript and react,so I configure emacs for that purpose, first I've only use the treesiter modes for typescript and tsx (typescript-ts-mode and tsx-ts-mode) until a friend introduce to lsp and tell me to use eglot since is builtin into emacs.
 So I did my research and find about autocompletion with company-mode and that is another mode called lsp-mode, so I decided to try both eglot and lsp-mode. first I use eglot and everything work well until I came across this tutorial -> https://emacs-lsp.github.io/lsp-mode/tutorials/reactjs-tutorial/ then I decided to give a try to lsp-mode
 Later on working normaly with lsp y decided to switch back to do a comparision with eglot and realize that in lsp you can autocomplete snippets but then switching to eglot that same thing don't happen. but accordingly to the eglot page you can autocomplete snippets using yasnippet (which I'm already using with lsp-mode) but for some reason this is not working and searching across internet I didn't find any solution. So maybe I'm missing something?
 If I didn't explain my self maybe these gif help.

 note: I tried eglot and company with another languages (c-ts-mode, c++-ts-mode) and there works perfectly, only with typescript and javascript buffers don't work.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have the C environment setup from the Wikemacs tutorial, which includes helm-gtags and gg tags. I first thought this was conflicting with c-eldoc, but turning those off did nothing to give me c-eldoc functionality. The closest I can get to actual functionality is to load an empty file with no extension (that doesn't trigger a language mode), and then run c-turn-on-eldoc-mode. From here I get a null pstring error every time I hover over a symbol. At least that is something. 
 Weather the gtags packages are on or off, c-eldoc does absolutely nothing otherwise, besides turning on the "Eldoc" indicator. 
 I'm wondering if there is backend setup that I'm missing. 
 I tried downloading from github and compiling, I get warnings about missing cache functions, and emacs doesn't seem to load it despite the folder being in 'load-path'; I'm not experienced with installing packages this way; that's another issue. 
 Mine is from Melpa.
 I'd like to see function signatures from the standard libraries.
 I have an F1 shortcut set for man pages, but sometimes that's overkill, and sometimes the specifics of the function are embedded in a much larger man page of related functions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I've been trying to setup emacs for the first time and it's been pretty easy and straightforward apart from a couple issues. I'm setting it up on a NixOS Virtual Machine using home-manager: I have two files a default.nix where I say which packages to install and a config.el where I write the configs. Here are the relevant parts from the files:
 default.nix:
 { pkgs , ... } { programs.emacs = { enable = true; package = pkgs.emacs; extraConfig = builtins.readFile ./config.el; extraPackages = epkgs: with epkgs; [ evil evil-collection treesit-auto ]; }; } 
 config.el:
 (setq evil-want-keybinding nil) (require 'evil) (require 'evil-collection) (evil-collection-init) (evil-mode 1) (require 'treesit-auto) (global-treesit-auto-mode) 
 The issues are:
 When I run home-manager switch I get two issues. The first one is assignment to free variable 'evil-want-keybinding' followed by a reminder to set evil-want-keybinding to nil before loading evil and evil collection (even if I am doing it).
 The second one is that it gives the error cannot open load file: no such file or directory, treesit.
 I've tested and the issues are disconnected from one another. I've been googling around for a day now and I wasn't able to find a fix to either. If any of you may know how to fix I'd be grateful.
 EDIT: Regarding the treesitter problem, I'm just a moron. The default pkgs.emacs is version 28. Changing it to pkgs.emacs29 it works. It does compile and works, but it does still give me issues about evil-want-keybinding.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 I already tried asking this over on the citeproc-el github, but while I wait for an answer there I figured I would try my luck here.
 Basically, I'm having trouble rendering certain superscripted citations properly when exporting to ODT. Instead of showing a proper superscripted citation, the generated ODT document shows the underlying org shorthand (e.g., ^{1}). Using a (relatively) minimal example:
  
#+TITLE: Manuscript Title 
 #+OPTIONS: author:nil toc:nil num:nil 
 #+CITE_EXPORT: csl ~/path/to/CSL/styles/american-medical-association.csl 
 * Testing 
 This is a test sentence with a citation.[cite:@somecitekey] 
 This is standard superscript.^{1} 
 #+PRINT_BIBLIOGRAPHY:
  
The first sentence will render as (^{1}), and the second sentence will render with appropriate superscript (1). The bibliography will render appropriately according to the CSL style, as expected.
 Interestingly, when I export to other formats such as HTML, the superscripted citations render appropriately—it's only ODT that has issues. Also, unsurprisingly, this isn't an issue for CSL formats that do not require superscript for in-text citations.
 For reference, I'm using citeproc-el and the advanced org-mode-ox-odt fork to export org files to ODT, although I don't know how much of a difference this makes.
 Any help or insight would be greatly appreciated!

The basic issue concerns where timestamps are "best" placed. In the original question, the focus was on whether an Entry's PROPERTY drawer was an acceptable location, but I've been trying to understand it more generally. When I wrote my answer earlier today, I talked about how Org handled timestamps depending on which of FOUR locations was chosen. In the subsequent hours, I've discovered a FIFTH. It wouldn't surprise me if there are even more. So, FWIW:

 I do a lot of data exploration in org, similar to what one would do in a Jupyter notebook, and it’s a bit of a pain to come up with a unique filename for each one. I’d much prefer just to be able to kill/yank the header and reuse it for each code chunk.
 EDIT: Just realized I can create a yasnippet that inserts the timestamp right into the header. That should solve my problem.

 I need to run some commands over and over again, but they are basically the same. I'd like to write a script to run them under eshell, but I have no experience with that. The commands are rclone commands.
 Any thoughts?

 In the font picker I can specify 9, 9.5 and 10 and they all look different, I want to use 9.5 but emacs windows display/round the font to 10. When using a size of 9.5 the font picker saves the font as the following:
 '(default ((t (:family "Comic Code" :foundry "TAB " :slant normal :weight regular :height 98 :width normal))))
 I tried messing with multiple values of :height but that didn't work. I'm guessing the font picker dialog is some gtk widget and uses a different font rendering? In a terminal, the font is displayed correctly with 9.5, looks the same as in the file picker with 9.5.
 What should I look for to solve this issue?

 This works in the GUI. However, when I'm running -nw in the MacOS Terminal, either the system or terminal app is hijacking the Command shortcuts. So, for example, Command-n creates a new terminal window and Command-p opens the print dialog. How do I disable all of the Command shortcuts of the terminal?

 One new feature is the single hyrolo.py script which you can install for shell command-line record-level access to your Org, Markdown and Emacs Outline files. You give the search string and files to search on the command-line and it highlights the match in the lowest-level records that match. You can then pipe that into any other program. Not quite as powerful as the Emacs version of HyRolo but useful in other contexts. On an old machine, a single word search over 1300 files with four matches takes 0.75 seconds.
 Enjoy.

Choreographing a dance with the GHC specializer (Part 1) by Finley McIlwaine
Overloaded functions are common in Haskell, but they come with a cost. Thankfully, the GHC specialiser is extremely good at removing that cost. We can therefore write high-level, polymorphic programs and be confident that GHC will compile them into very efficient, monomorphised code. In this episode, we’ll demystify the seemingly magical things that GHC is doing to achieve this.

Luckily, relatively recently, GHC got a feature to include all Core bindings in the interface files. Wh…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Emacs is the best singular computer-interaction framework I’ve encountered so far, but we can all agree it has its flaws. Single-threaded performance characteristics, limited to text (rather than some more flexible core abstraction, perhaps one which would better allow making full use of the screen as a 2D canvas), Elisp (which while decent isn’t on par with the self-contained Lisp languages like CL), and other more minor problems.
 Are there any promising projects going on to make a replacement or successor for Emacs? The only ones I’m aware of are Lem and Project Mage; the former only solves 2 of the above major issues, and the latter is literally a one-person effort right now.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I've been using Haskell for a while now, I've gotten the hang of monads, applicatives, lazy evaluation, dabbled in mtl, lenses, and free monads, and I've absolutely loved all of it. But there's one single function that perpetually stumps me and I can't seem to understand how it works, and that's fix.
 The definition is
 fix f = let x = f x in x
 Trying to read through some stackoverflow answers explaining this function the closest I could get to understanding it is that the f passed into fix is infinitely composed with itself like so:
  x = f . f $ x -- or x = f (f x) x = f . f . f $ x -- or x = f (f (f x)) x = f . f . f . f . f . f . f . f . f . f . f $ x -- etc. 
 Given this explanation my question is, if a function is infinitely composed with itself, even if we were to have lazy evaluation here, how could it ever possibly terminate? The documentation says something about how fix produces the least fixed point of a function, looking that up I see something about domain theory and don't get any closer to understanding it. This is the one thing I feel like I simply can't get about this language. Can anyone help me out here?

There I appreciated many of VsCode's features, but being based off Microsoft once my job finished I began planning on dropping it. However seems to be neovim with many of its distros is nowadays the best experience for out of the box similarity with many of vscode's features, however knowing emacs is emacs I know everything's possible but is it worth the effort? Also with vanilla emacs I've seen some performance drawbacks whit heavy configurations and things were sometimes not as smooth even as vscode and I've heard neovim is very fast and light. Do you think emacs is a good idea for my goals? Maybe doom emacs already has what I want? So I don't have to spend weeks configuring emacs.....

If you’ve never heard of cloud native computing before, it has a number of definitions online, but the simplest one is that it’s mostly about Kubernetes.
Kubecon is a huge event with thousands of attendees. The conference spanned
several levels of the main convention center in Paris, with a myriad of
conference rooms and a whole floor for sponsor booths. FOSDEM already felt huge
compared to academic conferences, but Kubecon is even bigger.
Although the program was filled with appealing talks, we ended up spending most

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For a long time I have been having the issue where my emacs would occasionally glitch, in the following 2 ways:
  
it will randomly hang when I'm doing something. this happens with M-x and honestly everything so I don't think it's caching 
 when I type, it will randomly hang a bit and emit the text I type, but in the wrong sequence of keystrokes. I used to think that it might be completion-at-point taking too much time, but there's honestly nothing there, and there are various of times they are very fast.
  
I used to assume that it was my keyboard as I basically only use emacs when I'm using my computer, but I just tested that other program don't seem to have this problem
 So I suspect it is something with emacs.
 ​
 I tested the typing problem in firefox(I rolled "123123123" on my keyboard) and emacs. In firefox there's occasional delay but very brief and no sequence error, and in emacs this happened
 "123123123123123123123123123123123123123123123123123123123123123123123123123123123123123123123123123123123123123123123123123123123123121323232311123123123123123123123123"
 notice the "121323232311" part at the back, that's when emacs hangs and emit the whole of them out altogether. My hand is quite consistent as you can see all other parts are consistent "123123123".
 ​
 I have no idea why this happens, my machine is generally fast, nothing else (that is only firefox) glitch, and emacs only takes 7% of CPU. I wonder if anyone else have seen this before?
 my emacs version is 29.1 with doomemacs. my config is on z.gehninfel.xyz/20230914114145-doomemacs_configuration.html

 Demo of lasgun.el
 After writing some functionality for my personal configuration, I figured I may as well take a stab at writing my first package out of it.
 lasgun.el takes the Filter -> Select -> Act loop of avy and allows you to repeat the first two steps as needed, then act on the selections in bulk.
 It comes with two actions preloaded: one to place multiple-cursors.el cursors at each mark, and one to run embark-act-all on the positions. Users can define their own actions with the macro define-lasgun-action. Docstrings have usage information. 
 Besides avy, there are no dependencies (optionally mc and embark are needed for the aforementioned actions).

 Hook to save desktop on daemon exit doesn't seem to work, any ideas? Restoring the desktop works if I manually save the desktop:
 (setq desktop-dirname "~/.cache/emacs") (add-hook 'server-after-make-frame-hook #'(lambda () (unless desktop-save-mode (add-hook 'server-done-hook #'(lambda () (desktop-save "~/.cache/emacs"))) (desktop-save-mode 1) (desktop-read)))) 
 The desktop file doesn't get written to disk on C-x C-c or emacsclient -e "(kill-emacs)" so I need to manually evaluate (desktop-save "~/.cache/emacs"). I can also confirm the hook gets updated--it just doesn't seem to apply on daemon exit.

 so my basic questions are:
 what is the best package manager, is it use package, straight, elget..? oh so many...
 how should i structure my emacs config? is it only a .emacs or is it separated in init.el package.el straight.el whatever.el? i have no idea
 also i wonder if there is a proper "guide" to all of this, and if so, please tell me
 i also didnt manage to setup lsp because use package was complaining
 but anyways ty very much everyone

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Specific question here for tracing in Scala
 In a CRUD webapp, let's say a client receives an http request with a trace header, calls some logic, spins out some new fibers/futures/what-ever and does a bunch of work off the back of this instigating thing that all should be traced.
 If you want flamegraphs etc in the tracing visualisation tool of your choice to show where time gets spent for all subsequent calls (jaeger, datadog, graphana tempo, what-have-you). 
 In Java you'd have the option of instrumenting the JVM, and you'd get this without having to in code pass contexts nor record spans - basically, you instrument the JVM and you're done (unless you want to explicitly gain access to it to do something more specific) and your only (some asterisks here, but, mostly) code interaction is to extract the trace-headers from the incoming http request.
 Am I correct in saying that this is not possible in Scala currently - Scala cannot be instrumented in this manner, and we need to use libraries akin to Natchez and/or otel4s where you manually call Span.trace(or whatever the library uses) each call that you want traced? 
 I guess a TL;DR - is it possible to instrument scala for tracing, or is it necessary to interact with libraries?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been looking at trying out treesitter support again (specifically, c-ts-mode), and one thing that's got me stuck is how to modify the rules that are used to highlight the text. c-ts-mode makes some baffling decisions where it deviates from cc-mode in how certain things get highlighted, and I'd like to change this.
 I haven't been able to see anything about how to modify the highlighting so far. c-ts-mode doesn't offer anything like c-ts-mode-indent-style for modifying indentation, and the general treesitter documentation for font lock stuff doesn't really help. The closest I've figured so far is that maybe you can write a mode hook that adds entries to the treesit-font-lock-settings list, but there's no indication if this would actually work, and if so how.
 I'm worried that the only "solution" right now is to copy-paste the font lock rules in c-ts-mode and manually maintain a separate copy just to change a couple things, which would obviously be unacceptable. And I can't sidestep the issue by, say, modifying font faces to look better, because the issues I want to fix have to do with poorly-chosen generic font faces for some of these rules.
 If modifying syntax highlighting isn't possible right now, then I'll make a feature request and go back to waiting for treesitter support to be usable. I'm just not sure what part of emacs would be responsible for the new feature. I get the impression that the font lock rule system as it is now makes it really difficult for a major mode to let you extend its rules, so I'm leaning towards it being a treesitter feature request (as opposed to a c-ts-mode feature request).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi. I'm making a package that sometimes asks for user input with completing read. I would like to add marginalia annotations for the candidates.
 Is there an example as to how I should do it? My candidates are already a list in the form of ("candidate" . "content"). I would like for "content" to be displayed as a marginalia annotation.
 I would also like to not have a hard dependency on marginalia, of course. I read the README in marginalia's github, and there seems to be a way to do it, but it kinda went over me, didn't quite get it. Thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was introduced to Emacs at work and would like to migrate my physical todo list to org-agenda. This process is much easier thanks to the introduction materials by DistroTube, SystemCrafters, and Prod. While the aforementioned youtube videos are useful, I am having difficulty envisioning how best to organize my todos -- especially across multiple projects.
 It seems to me that there are three options (please correct me if I am wrong):
  
Single .org file -- top-level todo headers, :tags: used to organize per project
 Single .org file -- second-level todo headers organized under project-specific top-level headers
 Multiple .org files -- top-level todo headers organized in project-specific .org files
  
What is your approach for tracking/organizing todos across multiple projects?
 I find myself drawn to the idea of having a separate .org file per repository at work, organizing git-issue todos in the top-level header and task "steps" todos at the second-header level. However, I question whether this is the best approach because it would require me to update my configuration (setq org-agend-files ...) should I work on a new repository -- however unlikely.
 ​
 Any recommendations from seasoned `org-agenda` users is welcome!

While I appreciate the tips from then, I'm still stuck and eager to overcome this problem so that I can move on with my learning. Since then, I have read LYAH and I have read a large chunk of Real World Haskell, yet I still can't overcome this obstacle. I have pondered this problem on and off regularly during this six months. I feel like it is holding me back at this point. As before, this is *not homework*. This is for my own edification.
 This code won't compile and I don't know how I could bring it to a state where it could be compiled as I can't figure out the logic behind it. Hopefully this will offer insight into what the program is supposed to do.

 Do packages generally have some kind of protection mechanism to avoid functional conflicts like this? Or at least a warning?
 Or perhaps there's a document somewhere that goes into incompatibilities or maybe just "it makes no sense installing X if you have A, B, C..."

 In an org-capture template, is there any way to have a prompted %-escape that provides both:

Or, more generally: is there a way to get to reuse, further into my capture template, my response to a prompt of the form: %^{Birthday}u?

 I'd given up trying to beat org-capture templates into the precise shape I want. Instead I was looking more at yasnippets and the like.

 For some reason everything past the mode declaration is quasi-randomly indented. I cannot figure out what is doing it and looking at the yasnippet docs this does not seem like the intent.
 My mode line tells me Snippet, ws, yas, company, and wrap are all activated when I invoke yas-new-snippet.
 This is my configuration for yasnippet: 
 (add-to-list 'load-path

My config.el file has ;;; $DOOMDIR/config.el -*- lexical-binding: t; -*- at the top, and describe-variable shows that the value for lexical-binding is indeed 't' in this buffer.

Note that this is for `tab-bar-mode`, not `tab-line-mode`, which means it is a tab per window layout (similar to perspective.el/persp-mode), and not a tab per buffer.

 Please let me know if it works for you and if there's anything you'd like to customize that you can't with this version of the package. No guarantees that I can or will add additional customization options, however.

 I've posted a few times about my tab line config so my love for tabs is public. Recently I've seen several other folks posting as well on the topic and I noticed a trend in the comments with some repeated questions along these lines: 
 <slight exaggeration>
  
But seriously they look nice but do you use them? 
 What's the point / I don't see what it adds beyond switch-buffer?
 I have a lot of files, hundreds really, open - this doesn't look like it will scale.
  
</slight exaggeration>
 So I decided to make another tabs video with my answers and perspective on why I really find them useful and how they work in practice.

 I’ve been a Golang developer most of my career but lately I’ve been feeling kinda stuck knowledge and career wise, so I’m looking for ways to improve my development skills and how to design maintainable clean code. Since I think I’m quite familiar with the common patterns in Go I thought learning a new language might help with broadening my views. I’m currently looking at Zig and Haskell and was going to decide on one of them.
 Im quite curious about your opinion on:
  
Has learning and writing Haskell has affected the way you think about code? not only in Haskell programs but in other languages too.
 
Do you think it has made you better developers? 
 
If so would you able to give some examples? What do you do now that you didn’t before learning Haskell?
 
Has it open some more opportunities for you career wise?
 
 Thank you for taking the time go through this post! Hope you have a great day!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm exploring using silos in denote, which I think are potentially very helpful.
 Am I correct in saying that, at present, once I switch to a silo (e.g. with `denote-silo-extras-create-note`), I can't switch back to the default `no-silo` (`denote-directory`) without switching to the `denote-directory` directory in dired? Or is the intention that everything should be in a silo, rather than in the default `denote-directory`?
 Either way, I think things could get complicated working in different silos (assuming the goal is to keep them separate). Perhaps what is needed is some indication prepended to buffer-name of the silo - e.g. if the silo is in ~/Orgs/Silo1 and the #+title is "My plain title", the buffer name would be "Silo1:My plain title". If we were in the default `denote-directory` , buffer-name would just be "My plain title".
 Thanks

Whenever I try to do M-x package install RET lsp-mode RET, it begins downloading as normal, but then it runs into 123 errors all going along the lines of:
 lsp-actionscript.el:27:2: Error: lsp-execute-command is already defined as something else than a generic function
 The other 122 errors are the exact same but for all the lanuages the lsp supports.
 If I go in the lsp-actionscript.el and go to line 27, then it's this command which throws the error:
 (require 'lsp-mode)
 The same goes for all the other errors. I can't seem to find anything about this online. Hope u can help:)
 Btw, I use windows 11 if that makes any difference

 Hi everyone, I have developed a new library [typed-fsm](https://github.com/sdzx-1/typed-fsm). 
 It allows writing typed finite state machines.
 It has many advantages:
  
Focus on the right message
  
​
  
Top-to-bottom design for easy refactoring
  
​
  
Conducive to building complex state machine systems

 + Type guarantees will not produce incorrect function calls when written

There is a sanity check. If you miss some items for pattern matching, the compiler will issue a warning, and there will also be a warning for invalid items.

I cannot get this program to work with the packages I am trying to install per the recommendations of a tutorial I am following. It would be really helpful if someone who knows what they are doing could help me on screen share with discord because I feel like I am close to fixing this because I think everything that is supposed to be installed is there and I feel like probably just one of my directory paths is wrong but I don't know where or how.
 I have posted on the tutorial and also asked on stack overflow and nothing has been helpful and I am just getting the same errors over and over. I just want to start coding but I can't because I can't even get this editor set up.

 Edit: I woke up with renewed vigor and I am going to try again when I get home from some obligatory human activities which unfortunately detract me from my goal of being a data spirit of some kind. Below is a copy of my relevant major file structure. "pmacs" is the HOME directory in my environment variables.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'll preface by stating that I use project.el, and not projectile. Any solutions involving the latter won't do for me.
 In most other editors, you can create a file at the project root (or some other predefined path) that specifies settings and, among other things, launch commands.
 These commands are for anything related to the project, be it running, compiling, testing, debugging, whatever.
 I want something like this for emacs. So, I've been investigating possible ways to do it.
 I created a .dir-locals.el file on the project root. Emacs automatically loads this file. In it, I defined numerous variables with commands. I defined compile-command and created my own, like run-command and test-command.
 I would then need to create functions that read these variables and run their values, similar to how compile-command is handled. This would work just fine, but there's an issue.
 Since the variables I'm creating are unknown to emacs, it marks them as risky. So, what ends up happening is that every time you open a file where these variables would apply, you get a prompt asking you if you want to apply the variables.
 I managed to fix this by setting these variables as safe when giving them strings like this:
 (put 'compile-and-run-command 'safe-local-variable #'stringp) (put 'run-command 'safe-local-variable #'stringp) (put 'test-command 'safe-local-variable #'stringp) 
 And while this works, it irks me the wrong way, since this file would obviously be bundled with the project. So, if anyone else downloads this project and opens it with emacs, they won't have this extra config and they will be bugged by it, and for no good reason since they won't have the functions that use these variables anyway so it's of no use to them.
 So, I'm looking for a way to:
  
Define an arbitrary amount of commands to run on a project.
 Have this configuration loaded automatically.
 Not be a nuisance to third parties.
  
Any ideas?

 For example, if I do C-x C-f and start typing init.el, that should come before early-init.el.
 I seem to have gotten it working for the most part:
 (add-to-list 'ivy-sort-matches-functions-alist '(counsel-find-file . ivy-sort-function-buffer)) (add-to-list 'ivy-sort-matches-functions-alist '(ivy-switch-buffer . ivy-sort-function-buffer)) (add-to-list 'ivy-sort-matches-functions-alist '(counsel-projectile-find-file . ivy-sort-function-buffer)) 
 However, I'm still faced with execute-extended-command (i.e, M-x) not honoring my wish. What relevant ivy function should I look into to get this to work?
 Would there instead be a way for me to get it to work for all of them instead of individually?
 Edit: I was able to do it by enabling counsel-mode and the relevant function was counsel-M-x; however, I'm still curious if there is either (1) a better way (2) to do. this for all completions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm happy to announce the release of Kele 0.5.0, the spritzy Kubernetes cluster management package for Emacs. Changelog is available here.
 This release integrates Kele with the menu bar. With this initial integration, you can switch Kubernetes contexts and default namespaces from within the menu bar. Kele presents your available contexts and namespaces as dynamic sub-menus, freeing you from the need to remember exact names and typing them in by hand (similar to kubectx and kubens on the terminal).

 With this release, Kele is now also integrated with doom-modeline. By adding the k8s segment to your doom-modeline configuration, you'll see current context and namespace information directly on the modeline. By clicking the segment, you can also access the menu bar, for the (menu-bar-mode -1) crowd.

 For more details, see the Kele documentation. As always, please open an issue for any peculiar behavior you notice, or feel free to start a discussion if you'd like to give general feedback or throw ideas around.
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi.
 As a follow up to this post I tried manually configuring the laravel-dev-tool server for blade templates.
 Here's my config (I'm using Doom):
 (after! lsp-mode (...) (add-to-list 'lsp-language-id-configuration '(web-mode . "blade")) (lsp-register-client (make-lsp-client :new-connection (lsp-stdio-connection (executable-find "laravel-dev-tools") "lsp") :activation-fn (lsp-activate-on "blade") :server-id 'bladels :priority -1))) 
 When I use this configuration and open a .blade.php file nothing happens. No server starts. It doesn't even try to start a server as I see no messages related to LSP.
 If I change the "blade" language to "html" (which is bound to html-ls) it starts the server successfully.
 So I'm guessing either I'm missing something or have something not configured correctly.
 Can someone please try and help me figure this out?
 Thanks in advance.

s-<mouse-1> on an url in a comment open browser 
 s-<mouse-1> on a type definition search for references
 s-<mouse-1> on something opens definition
 s-<mouse-1> on import opens the imports definition
 s-<mouse-1> on a { folds it
 s-<mouse-1> on a folded block unfolds it
  
Does someone have some lookalike setup or have pointers to quickly implement this?
 Thank you!

 * heading this is a test text `{True if 1 == 1 else False}` this is another line 
 now I want the text inside `{ }` to be highlighted using python syntax, is this possible preferably using something related to font-lock-add-keywords ??
 I already tried poly-mode but it misses up all the org-mode syntax highlighting, and it makes emacs kinda laggy, but code completion when inside `{ }` is related to python. but no syntax highlighting.
 and here is the code I used to create the poly-mode :
 (define-hostmode poly-org-python-hostmode :mode 'org-mode :protect-syntax nil :protect-font-lock nil ) (define-innermode poly-org-python-innermode nil :mode 'python-mode :head-matcher "`{" :tail-matcher "}`\n" :head-mode 'host :tail-mode 'host) (define-polymode poly-org-python-mode :hostmode 'poly-org-python-hostmode :innermodes '(poly-org-python-innermode ) )

 The problem is random, only happens sometimes. The emacs runs in Ubuntu 22.04 in WSL 2.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am upgrading a lot of Scala 2.13 services up to Scala 3, and have encountered some codebases where reflection was used in unit tests to examine all the subclasses of a trait.
 For example, in 2.x the way to make enumerations was with a sealed trait and case object subclasses. We would often make a collection listing all types, similar to Java enum .values. In our unit tests we would want to make sure no subtypes were accidentally omitted from that collection, and we would use reflection for that.
 ```scala import scala.reflect.runtime.universe
 val classType = universe.typeOf[Branding] val subclasses = classType.typeSymbol.asClass.knownDirectSubclasses ```
 This is gone in Scala 3 and I'm wondering if there is a simple alternative. I would love to spend a day or two learning the new Scala macro syntax but I don't have the time right now to devote to that, just for this simple 2-line expression.
 One might also suggest just updating our 2-style enums to Scala 3 proper enums. That will solve some of our scenarios but we use this "find subclass types" in tests for other classes as well, not just enums. For example we might occasionally have a trait with many subclasses and we want to make sure we have written a certain kind of test for each of the concrete subclasses, and reflection can come in handy as a sanity check here.
 gzoller/scala-reflection seems popular but I don't see any documentation.

 (define-minor-mode test-mode :init-value nil :lighter " test" :keymap (make-sparse-keymap)) (define-key test-mode-map [t] 'ignore) 
 and enable test-mode in a test buffer. As expected, nothing happens when I press any key. Even M-l does nothing and minibuffer remains clear. However, if I then evaluate
 (define-key test-mode-map (kbd "M-j") (lambda () (interactive) (message "hi fren"))) 
 when I run M-j in the test buffer, I see "hi fren" in minibuffer, but if I also run M-l in test buffer, I also see "hello" in minibuffer. In fact, all M-modified global keys are now working. Why is this? 
 ​
 More to the point, what if I want to still have access to my global keybinds, while having special code for anything that is not defined in test-mode-map? 
 ​
 I could set the parent of test-mode-map to global-map, but then any keys that are not in test map and not in global-map are handled by global-map if I dont use the [t] option, and if I use it, any global keys not in test-map never reach global-map.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've started a Cabal project which consists of an executable and a single test-suite. In the test-suite I call the executable in a subprocess using System.Process.callProcess. 
 I've found that cabal test does not automatically rebuild the executable after its Main.hs has been modified. Hence tests were failing simply because the executable was out-of-date.
 It took me a while to figure out how to fix this so I'm recording the fix here. The Cabal file should look something like this:
 name: foo executable: bar main-is: Main.hs hs-source-dirs: app test-suite: tests type: exitcode-stdio-1.0 main-is: test.hs hs-source-dirs: tests build-tool-depends: foo:bar 
 The build-tool-depends line ensures that the executable bar in project foo gets built every time the test-suite is run.
 The comments on this Github issue suggest that this is the official way of ensuring that an executable is built before a test-suite is run. And this open issue is requesting the addition of a run-tool-depends field which would create a distinction between executables used when building a component and those used to running a component.
 Is there a better way of directly testing an executable with Cabal?

This is yet another opportunity to share with your friends what you are working on. Add to this discussion by telling us about your zettelkasten journey. Share with us what you're learning. Sharing helps me and, hopefully, you, too. It helps us clarify our goals and visualize our thinking. And sometimes, a conversation sparks a magical moment where we can dive into an idea worth exploring. We'd love to hear more from you.   🫵🏼
Ideas I'm exploring with my ZK:
A deep dive into time-slicing vs time-sinks. I'm looking at this from the perspective of creating a flourishing life in the present moment and not as much from a formal "time management" perspective. I see that incrementally working on strategies for maintaining continuity and interest over time is what will make time-slicing sustainable, where my rigid thinking has led me to drop this practice in the past.
With the help of Matt Ellis at Grammarly Blog, I am studying the differences between summarizing and paraphrasing for academic research.

 Up until now I have been using lsp-treemacs-symbols to get an outline view of my java files. This mostly works but because it depends on the lsp server to provide the information there can be lots of odd hiccups when for whatever reason that server is down or slow. An alternative would be to use imenu and imenu-list to provide this capability. But by default it doesn't show as much detail as lsp-treemacs and in particular there were no field …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This works perfectly fine and snappy in X11, but on Wayland with the PGTK build, some emacs links don't display the highlight when hovering with the mouse immediately, it takes a few seconds. Then there are some other links that do work immediately, which makes it even more odd.
 You can see this in the dashboard.el recent files or project list. It can also be spotted on treemacs. Links in org mode buffers seem to be instant tho. It is quite inconsistent.
 In any case, I am more interested in knowing how can I see what function is reposnsible for the mouse highlighting on hover. I tried to use the profiler, but the function doesn't show up. I guess it's very deep in emacs, something from the C core most likely which would be a bummer. I want to investigate why this issue happens in the first place.
 Any ideas?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello emacs community, no matter how hard i try i cannot seem to wrap my head around the idea of using hooks in emacs. I have two examples to provide. The one working and the other one not, although i've seen both in the documentation.
 First example: Defining a function and then passing in to the hook.
 ```emacs-lisp (defun my-c-mode-hook () (setq c-basic-offset 4 indent-tabs-mode nil electric-indent-mode nil) (message "C-mode hook loaded successfully"))
 (add-hook 'c-mode-common-hook 'my-c-mode-hook) ``` Even though the message prints, the variables don't seem to get the values.
 Second example:
 emacs-lisp (add-hook 'c-mode-common-hook (lambda () (setq c-basic-offset 4 indent-tabs-mode nil electric-indent-mode nil) (message "C-mode hook loaded successfully" ))) 
 The second one, passing a lambda to the hook works. It also is the same for my latex-mode hooks.
 So my question is, what is the difference between the two methods and what am i missing here. If anyone wants to share a resource for working with emacs hooks it will also be really appreciated.
 On the note of hooks, i have a more general question. When using the setq-default it will set the variable globally if it can. tab-width for example if set with `setq-default does not apply to all buffers. But if it is passed with a hook it works. Correct me if i'm wrong but does that happen because the settings get overwritten by the major mode? That's why you need the hook to overwrite the major mode defaults perhaps???
 Thank you in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, folks! Learning to use the awesomeness that is org-babel, having trouble finding my footing:
 Withing dedicated buffer for, e.g. emacs-lisp, I get neat docs, and auto-completion, lsp (in the minibuffer).
 Now I know that lsp-within-org-babel has a whole package dedicated to it, so I know that:
  
there's no LSP within code block by default
 there's a hack that's experimental but it might work
  
Haven't tried it, so this is me regurgitating google, basically, and I welcome corrections gladly.
 Now when I try the above example within org code block - I don't get the same features. 
 Is this a natural limitation of org babel and I just shouldn't go for literate programming if I need the features of a proper IDE?
 emacs v.29.2 distro - spacemacs
 ADDED: huh, found this by one of spacemacs' devs.

Dyadic Decomposition using Functional lenses by Eduardo Lemos
Compressors are usually implemented imperatively. Pointers and mutation are in the spotlight and it is not hard to put yourself into some spaghetti code. How functional programming abstractions deal with it? In this presentation, I explain one instance in which some of them fit like a glove to the problem on hand, going all the way from intuition to actual code.

Depending on which kind of node I am currently editing, I have a different keymap for different commands that apply to that node. When I switch nodes however, I want to switch the active keymap, but changing the mode-map I have does nothing, the old keymap is still active and the new commands do not become available. I could look up the command in a hashtable, but Im worried that is not as efficient as just using the keymap structures furnished by emacs. How should I go about this?

 After a lot of work (and crashes), I'm pleased to announce colorful-mode.el, a featured alternative to rainbow-mode.el
 Features
  
Preview any color from your current buffer in real time.
 Change them to any color type (only hex and emacs color names are available).
 Choose between highlight them or using a customizable string prefix.
  
Also you can add your custom regex function (check colorful-extra-color-keywords-hook).
 Since this is the first package for emacs that I've ever made I would like to hear your comments, feedback and tips (since i'm not expert in elisp)
 Here the link to the repo:

 I am quite new to Emacs which is not helping either since I don't know if it is an issue with how I am running it, if I am missing a package, or if the whole of Yololisp just doesn't work anymore.
 When I run the .sh, I get a long error message with "Eager macro-expansion failure: (error "Misplaced t or 'otherwise' clause")" being the only thing I can see that leads me in any sort of direction. The error message only stays up for a quarte of a second, though I grabbed a screenshot of what I can view before it vanishes.

 tl;dr -- Every lsp mode for emacs works great, under most circumstances you can't go wrong with any of them.
 Seriously, if all you want to know is if lsp modes for emacs are good and if you should use one, the answer is yes, assuming it supports your language.
 Summary
  
lspce is the lightest weight, least intrusive of all of them, even less than eglot if you ignore the setup costs. It gives you the least ability to inspect what's going on (I haven't checked the project for a couple of weeks, but when I first installed it it didn't even have the stderr output of the lsp that was running) but also feels the most transparent. Similar to lsp-bridge, you'll see a big benefit on large projects with the potential to block your UI.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm having to write jsx/tsx, and I want the best possible experience dealing with this pesky syntax elements.
 What do you folks use these days? I'm basically hoping to improve the following aspects:
  
Typing jsx/tsx forms
 Folding
 Structural editing
  
 
For the first thing I probably can still use Emmet mode. Or maybe there's something better now?
 
Since I'm already using treesitter, for folding I tried: emacs-tree-sitter/ts-fold, but because I'm using Emacs 30, I had to use this fork: abougouffa/treesit-fold, see emacs-tree-sitter/ts-fold#48 for details. That though still didn't get me the desired outcome. If I have a component such as:
 export default function Home() { return ( <main> <div> <p> ... 
 
 and I try folding around <p>, it folds the entire function body. Not sure why. In general, I'm not sure what to use for folding to make it work with treesitter - ts-fold/treesit-fold, hideshow, evil-fold, origami, bicycle, yafolding, evil-vimish-fold, or something else?
  
For structural editing I'm not even sure what would be helpful here. I'm thinking of trying evil-matchit, to quickly jump to beginning/end of an element, because evil's % keybinding doesn't support html tags by default, but that's just one aspect. There are probably a few other things to consider?
  
What are your thoughts? In general, do you know of any other Emacs packages you'd recommend for web-development? Also, I noticed that not all the features of emacs-tree-sitter/elisp-tree-sitter went into core (again, I'm using Emacs 30), do you think it's worth loading the package instead of relying on what's already in the core?

 🔗 Repo: https://github.com/mihassan/cloud-run-hs-demo
 Why This Project? I've been coding in Haskell for some time now mostly for toy projects. I really love coding in Haskell, but one thing I was missing is to easily share my work in a straightforward, cost-effective way to friends/colleagues. This setup, combining Haskell with Docker and Cloud Run, might not be ideal for a production-grade service but is great for demos and learning experiences - all for free.
 Project Overview:
 The project, cloud-run-hs-demo, is a basic Haskell application that uses the Scotty web framework to set up a simple API. This demo showcases how you can containerize a Haskell application using Docker and deploy it to Google Cloud Run, a managed platform that automatically scales your stateless containers.
 I am aware that the setup lacks many essential features like rate limiting, authentication mechanisms, and DDoS protection. Also, there are many options for web frameworks, such as servant, yesod etc. and many database libraries. These are critical for production-grade services to ensure security and manageability. This project serves as a demonstration on how easy it is to get started.
 Features:
  
Simple Haskell API using Scotty.
 SQLite readonly database using sqlite-simple project.
 Docker integration for Cloud Run deployment.
 Static webpage as frontend for the API.
  
I'd love to hear your thoughts, feedback, or any experiences with similar technologies. Let's learn and explore together!
 Happy coding! 🎉

 My eshell prompt is split across two lines. The first line shows my working directory followed by the git branch if relevant. (I also want to add venv info at some point.)The second line shows just # or $ depending on the user. 
 eshell-prompt-regexp is set at the default value "[#$\n]* [#$] " as it seems to match my constructed prompt but perhaps not? 
 Still on Emacs 27.1. Thanks for your time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have some academic notes with citations in org-roam. They used to be like Train (2009). Recently, when I modify and complie them into pdf, the citations are now in footnotes like1.
 1 Train (2009)
 I think I did not change my init file. The releant lines are
 (setq org-cite-csl-styles-dir "~/snap/zotero-snap/common/Zotero/styles/") (setq org-cite-global-bibliography '("~/Dropbox/org/org-roam/my_library.bib")) (setq org-cite-export-processors '( (t . (csl "chicago-author-date.csl")))) ; Fallback(the default option)) 
 I tried other csl bib styles and citation styles, they are all in footnotes. For now, I use
 #+cite_export: basic author author-year 
 However, this produces Train, Kenneth (2009). Not something I want.
 I did some search and still do not know what happened. I followed the articles
  
https://amerygration.com/Blog/citation_handling_in_emacs.html
 https://blog.tecosaur.com/tmio/2021-07-31-citations.html
 https://kristofferbalintona.me/posts/202206141852
  
The author of citar posted something (https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/11rmakl/comment/jca9iqt/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web3x&utm\_name=web3xcss&utm\_term=1&utm\_content=share\_button) related to my problem. But is no longer on reddit.
 This is what I got when I compile the file now.
 This part relies on [cite/t:@trainDiscreteChoiceMethods2009].

 This is the file I complied in February.

 I have a project utilizing CMake with nested subprojects, structured roughly like this:  -Root/ --compile_commands.json --CMakeLists.txt --Build/ --Library/ ---src/ ----A/ ----B/ ---CMakeLists.txt --Executable/ (Depends on Library) ---src/ ----A/ ----B/ ---CMakeLists.txt  The hope is to start Eglot once at the root, and have it work for each subproject, but it doesn't enable when opening the source code for each subproject. Enabling Eglot repeatedly simply starts multiple instances, treating every single subdirectory as it's own project. Is there any way to have it treat the whole Root/ folder as a single project?

For every character that is in a position greater than position 24 and less than position X, if (mod position 12) is zero, one, or two, then fontify.
  
I have the following that I plan to add this to when activating a custom mode.

 I notice that Haskell Also has great documentation, playground and the "try Haskell!" tutorial. but I don't see ways to download these resources. Also I can't seem to find an extensive video tutorial as it is the case with Perl, Python or C which I downloaded. 
 So tl;dr I already think online Haskell resources are great but, I need, for my special case offline resources that are as good.

I suspect the addition of AI-backed tools could start to reduce the hours required to achieve such a task, so perhaps an additional financial commitment from the community would make it worthwhile and eliminate any financial risks on your end, Sascha & Christian.]]></summary>

 A bit of context: last 10 years I was involved mostly in web development (backend) and I feel kinda burned out now. Everything is the same: create a CRUD, connect a DB, integrate 3rd party API etc. It feels like it's not fun anymore, everything is the same and boring.
 Currently I have a Scala job that has nothing to do with FP and to be honest I quite like the language. I also like FP and spend some time every day to learn cats and cats effect, I REALLY enjoy it, something new and refreshing.
 But anyway, at the end of the day i realize that all these fancy things like cats and monads, although it's fun, is just anothe…]]></summary>

I know that it takes time, also coming from a dynamical language like python doesn't help. But I would like to improve at a faster pace, could you suggest me something? In my opinion what helps more is: personal projects, spend a lot of time reading working on code and reading other people code. Anyone has some advice? Everything is accepted: books, courses, also personal advices or ideas about what worked for you..thx in advance

 I'm almost always going to want at least one org file open, so I'd like to eagerly load org-mode on startup and pay the cost then as opposed to being interrupted by an annoying hitch when I'm trying to open my first org file.
 My first two theories were:
 (use-package org :demand t) 
 and
 (require 'org) 
 but neither worked.

 I've finally got my own configuration built and a fairly decent working understanding of Emacs. I followed the System Crafter's Emacs From Scratch YouTube playlist and then branched off into my own thing.
 I'm now wondering if there's anything that I should exchange from that baseline configuration? 
 There's a package that Neovim has that I'd love to have in Emacs called oil. It's a buffer based directory and file tree modification system. 
 So those who are more familiar with the meta of Emacs packages right now, would you be able to recommend some packages that I should exchange with what I built from this config mentioned above?

 So I was impressed to read u/github-alphapapa's answer to a recent question, on org-ql:
  
You may also consider using datetrees in a smaller set of files, e.g. one file per year, or even for multiple years. My log.org file goes back over 10 years, ...
  
I'd be interested to hear (from the estimable u/github-alphapapa himself, but from anyone else too):
 In what way(s) do you find datetree to be useful and worth sticking with?

 Debug: link before replace-match = [[file:/home/john/org/RoamNotes/book1-characters-jane.org][Jane]]
 Debug: replacing match with = [[file:/home/john/org/RoamNotes/book1-characters-jane.org][Jane]] [28 times]
 ​
 ​
 However when I cat the org file from the CLI, the links in the file actually look like this:
 [[File:/Home/John/Org/RoamNotes/Book1-Characters-Jane.Org][Jane]]
 Because of this the links do not work. I know the issue is not the function, could there be some addon or function to org mode that is capitalizing all the links?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My question is a bit more general this, but help me understand the best way to namespace some code:
 I work for the National Solar Observatory. We are NSF funded, and my team processes data from the DKIST solar telescope. I'm excited to build tools for this in Haskell.
 FITS is the digital format used for telescope images. I've been contributing to the fits-parse package, which uses Data.Fits as a namespace, but my needs are growing beyond the scope of that package. I need to add support for the ASDF file format (containing metadata for many FITS images) and for the World Coordinate System (WCS), among other things.
 So I'd like to make a new package containing all the tools one might need to work with astronomical images from modern telescopes/observatories. How should it be namespaced?
 There's an existing package that uses the Data.Astro namespace: https://hackage.haskell.org/package/astro. The fits-parse package uses Data.Fits
 Let's assume that I create a single package for this, and name it telescope. Should the code be namespaced under Data or not? If yes, should I use a different namespace than the Data.Astro that the astro package uses?
 Option 1: Pick my own Top-level Namespace
 import Telescope.Fits import Telescope.Asdf import Telescope.Wcs 
 Option 2: Add packages to existing namespaces like `Data.Astro`, which is used by the `astro` package
 Note that the `astro` package deals with calculating the position of celestial bodies, which is every bit as as valid a use of the word astronomy, but has a very different focus from my work to process astronomical observations.
 -- from this package! import Data.Astro.Fits import Data.Astro.Wcs -- from `astro` package import Data.Astro.Sun 
 Option 3: Pick a new namespace under `Data` to differentiate from the other packages
 import Data.Telescope.Fits import Data.Telescope.Wcs 
 What's the right approach here?

 Now I see corfu has become a good simpler alternative to company, but I'm unsure what the difference is between corfu & vertico, so I'm not sure if I can dump company or not. Minad says "Vertico is the minibuffer completion counterpart of Corfu" but what does that mean really?
 In my mind I think of company as a completion provider (on top of capf) and vertico as the UI for it. But corfu is a UI for capf, right? So do I still need vertico? And I assume I'll still need consult, I couldn't live without consult-buffer.
 I know I should just try it & see what happens, but any pointers would be helpful.

So, I can get everything loaded by evaluating my emacsql use-package, and then my ff-data use-package. But why do I have to do this every load time? I thought I could get around it by using :after and :demand but for some reason this doesn't seem to change anything. I like to pretend that order doesn't matter in my init.el, so I would like to avoid repositioning them in some other order.
 Here are the important lines I am trying:
 (use-package emacsql :demand t) 
 and above:
  (use-package consult-ffdata :after emacsql :straight (consult-ffdata :type git :host github :repo "chen-chao/consult-ffdata") :custom (counsel-ffdata-database-path "/home/torysa/.mozilla/firefox/aabkj82t.default/places.sqlite") ) 
 Why aren't the demand and after statements working, and why do I have to manually evaluate those lines to get things to work properly?

 And since I haven't had much experience in haskell, I would ask your help.
 I would ask you all to see the code and mention what I can improve, maybe there is somewhere memory leaks or performance issues, or maybe you have some your own best practices of how to orgranise the code and so on and so forth.
 I haven't made tests and benchmarks, yet.
 I haven't move String to Text yet.
 Also, I left the example in the example folder and also I left comments in the code so you might understand what is going on there
 So, I please you very hard, look on the code and make your suggestions/advices. And, please, look on example folder, I made question there about existential type
 And sorry for english here and in the comments in the repo, English is not my native
 thank you

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Now I'm writing a small application which manages some files in linux for my hobby.
 So I have tried to implement an abstraction of IO Monad to test as my file managing functions like below.
 ```hs
 imporrt qualified System.Directory as D
 class (Monad m) => FileManagerMonad m where
 moveFile :: FilePath -> FilePath -> m () doSomething :: FilePath -> FilePath -> m ()
 data FileObj = File | Dict [FileObj]
 data AppPure = AppPure
 { appDir :: FileObj
 }
 instance FileManagerMonad (Reader AppPure) where
 moveFile src dest = do
 // do logical file moving onto appDir as same as `D.renameFile` of directory package. 
 doSomething src dest = do moveFile src dest // do something.
 instance FileManagedMonad IO where
 moveFile = D.renameFile doSomething src dest = do moveFile src dest // do something as same as for AppPure. ```
 After I wrote that, I have wondered that this implementation is meaningless at all because my FileManagerMoand implementation for AppPure is enable to be misimplemented and I don't want to test removeFile directly. I'm satisfied to D.renameFile function in actual usage.
 But I am not good at Haskell programming, I want to know that I should create an IO monad abstraction for just imitation like a unnecessary mocking in testing context.
 Though I think that should write or not is depended on contexts absolutely, I have no idea how to decide it.
 Sorry for my stupid noobie (poor English) question. If I was gave some comments, so pleasure. Thanks.

I have been looking for that site again but can't seem to find it. I am mainly looking for it because one of the configurations was customized for creative writing with all kinds of packages for creating novels, managing biographies, and world building. They also claimed snippets for org mode to insert LaTex that would get you most of the way to what is needed to publish an ebook. 
 I don't remember everything they said it did, but I mainly use emacs for programming and org mode related things. I really wanted to take a look at the configuration and packages to see what was included. I want to add some creative writing tools to my emacs config, and I was hoping to save time scraping elpa and trying different things, by testing their starter-kit out and then stealing the best packages and workflows which I could modify and add to my own config for my own purposes.
 Anyways if anyone has seen anything like that Please point the way.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Digging into org-ql and its pretty amazing to say the least.
 What i'm trying to do is query some org files I use for my personal review periods. I'd like to do a query that looks for additive tags not or based tags but I"m not sure how to structure the query.
 An example:
 I'd like to be able to search my org files for items tagged say :FEB:2023:Accomplishment: if I use those tags via tags:Feb,2023,Accomplishment it gets things tagged with all the combinations not the 3 joined together to be more restrictive.
 If it's helpful to understand I organize my reviews by month such that the 2023-02-Feb.org file has the FEB and 2023 in the filetags at the top of the file and then I have 4 headings within each file Week1,2,3,4 each with the same structure.
 If I can limit to just those tags then sorting by parent should then auto organize the month into week 1/2/3/4 sections in the org-ql view.
 Thanks in advance for any help!
 p.s. Additionally is there a way to have org-ql search a directory not just a set of individual space separated files?

 I was also wondering how the notes are organised, are they organised by different pages like something in obsidian or is it more of an atomic way like logseq? 
 Linked to the idea of organisation can I organise things via tags and links and stuff instead of folders because of ease of use and things like that because in obsidian my workflow was based around tags instead of looking through specific folders to find my information.
 I'm also just looking for a brief rundown of how you would organise the notes in orgmode on a very basic level.
 This is a copy paste from the emacs subreddit as I feel like it would better fit here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I used to have a job where I had been hired as a Scala dev. Then I got roped into doing database stuff and haven't touched any Scala code for real in years. Last time I did any production coding was before they announced that Akka was moving away from open source, and Zio was still pretty new. Consequently, I've also fallen off on staying up to date on the happenings in the Scala community.
 So what's the new hotness I should be on top of if I'm going to advertise myself as a Scala dev again? Any big new developments I've missed? What should I study up on to ensure I speak the correct language at an interview?

 Very simple init.el:
 (add-to-list 'load-path "path/to/evil") (require 'evil) (evil-mode 1) 
 But it still isn't enabled on startup. I can enable it manually, but interestingly, I have to enter the command twice. If I remove (evil-mode 1), I just have to execute the command once. Other commands in my init.el get executed as expected.
 It works as expected when running emacs through WSL. I've also tried installing with package.el and elpaca but same thing. I was also able to install general.el without issue, and I'm a solid 4 hours in at this point, so I'm not sure where else to look. It just seems like (evil-mode 1) in my init.el doesn't work for some reason
 Edit: Just added hooks to enable evil-mode to work around this

 Example of bibliography and badly formatted numbering
 What I would hope to get is something like:
 [1] Reference 1 [2] Reference 2 
 I have the following in the org file header:
 #+cite_export: basic numeric numeric #+bibliography: ~/OrgFiles/OrgRoam/biblio.bib 
 and use the following for a citation:
 [cite:@reference] 
 I export using "Export to Hugo-compatible Markdown :: Subtree to Md file".
 A "(1)" appears in the text ok, although not hyperlinked to the actual reference in the bibliography section, but not as bothered about that.
 How do I fix the formatting of the bibliography numbering?

 I have zero experience with research and little experience with Haskell, but I loved what I've seen of the language so far, and was told that undergrad research would be a great way to learn about it. Do you have any suggestions for topics that are reasonable to research in one year? (Don't know how it works elsewhere, but where I study, that's how long an undergrad research project typically lasts)
 I was thinking of doing research related to DataSci (I'm open to suggestions in other fields), maybe implementing some aspects of the Pandas library in Haskell. Is this a decent idea? Do you know of any features that would be interesting?
 Also, I have a (demanding) full time job as a software developer, so ideally the project shouldn't be super difficult.
 Any help will be so very much appreciated. Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I made a post yesterday about Scala.js.
 I spent two days to experiment with Scala.js and the three.js library for developing small 3D Games.
 I have used ScalablyTyped for generating the facades.
 I'm confident to say I'm a total beginner in three.js and scala.js. 
 I came to the conclusion that Scala.js can be awesome but I feel it is too much troubles since the facades generated by ScalablyTyped have some kind of issues and making the facades by myself for a 3D library isn't a trivial task.
 At least it isn't for me :)
 Not knowing well three.js sure isn't helping.
 I probably gonna stick to TypeScript for this use case.
 If I really wanna use Scala, better use a framework like Libgdx (Java) anyway.
 I do feel like Scala.js is really good but it makes more sense when working with scala.js libraries like Laminar.
 Using it to use a heavy javascript library perhaps make less sense. Especially for a simple video game. 
 Anybody have used three.js with Scala.js?
 Any thoughts overall?

Functors can represent up to Finite State Machines
 Applicatives can represent up to, I dunno, Push Down Automatas somehow?
 Monads can represent up to Turing Machines
 Selectives are somewhere in between Applicative and Monad. 
  
I mean, definitely in between Applicative and Monad in computation ability, but also nested on the Chomsky Hierarchy somewhere. Are they akin to Push Down Automatas?
 Am I just hallucinating the connection? (Also, if you have a favorite Selective resource, please send it my way! :) )

 Generate Commit Messages within magit-status Buffer
 Yep, you guessed it, another one calling the GPT API(gptel). The prompt modified from gptcommit, I've simplified it, trimming down API calls at the cost of accuracy. This package is more for fun than productive. There was a similar package before: Introducing GPT-Commit: An Emacs Package for AI-Generated Commit Messages, but the community feedback wasn't very positive. Hence, I've been a bit hesitant to put it out there until recently when I finally uploaded it to MELPA. Anyway, I'll still share it and any feedback are welcome.

In Chapter 2, Section 2.2 Data Kinds, I am finding the highlighted part, in the screenshot attached below, very confusing; it says "we can change our User type..." what does this mean?
 https://preview.redd.it/lemuzpikwtsc1.png?width=774&format=png&auto=webp&s=f4cf318243853d7217c99f49856a86313b259ae9
 I tried this out in ghci (please refer to the screenshot attached below). But as expected, this causes an error. User is already defined as a data constructor for the UserType type, so creating another type by the same name gives an error. So, what does that line exactly mean? That
  
we can change our User type...
  
Kindly help me understand this. I am still new to this, so it is possible that I am unable to put together some related concepts that I have covered but might not have understood as well as I think I have. Thanks in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently migrated from VSCode to Doom Emacs, loving it so far. Though the learning curve seems steep, and I have lots of questions. Since I work with C/C++ most of the time, spent the Saturday goofind with Emacs GDB & make. And I encountered the problem with M-x +evil:make (pic 1). It seems like the function's supposed to create an interactive "sh" so that I can input the argument (pic 2), but it doesn't (pic 4). Also attached an image showing edebug (pic 3) but I barely understand this tool.

 My questions:
 - Have anyone encountered my problem? Tried a couple other +evil: functions, they don't create any interactive environment either
 - What is the "proper" way to close the comint terminal? C-x k seems tedious, if I can navigate and "q" it somehow would be nice. 
 Thanks.

 Do any of you have a working config for dape which attaches to a remote dlv-dap adapter. In my case, goland binary runs in a pod. I have a ssh tunnel to it. And I attach to localhost on the ssh tunnel port. I do see in the cmdline "Handling connection for" print by the ssh tunnel. But dape doest connect to dlv on the binary. Goland easily does this though.
 If you have a working config for remote attach to dlv-dap, please do share.

 I am trying to set up functions to differentiate the visual styles of programming modes, text modes (specifically org mode, but also others), and the dashboard. The hooks, however, seem to only trigger when I manually set the mode of the buffer (e.g. when I run M-x emacs-lisp-mode in init.el), and not automatically when I open a file with a given major mode. Is there a better way to write these hooks? As well, the line numbers don't always seem to disappear properly in text modes, am I incorrectly using (display-line-numbers-mode -1)?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This function is called when you have pixel-scroll-precision-mode activated with the pixel-scroll-precision-interpolate-mice option enabled and scroll with the mouse wheel. The problem I'm having is that a single slight movement of the mouse wheel results in a substantial amount of scrolling.
 It is adequate if the windows takes the whole screen, but if you have some tinier ones, it's too much, and you're missing content. Is there a way to make it take into account the window size? (I'm talking about emacs's windows here).
 For instance, I did something similar for the M-v and C-v keybinds, since I felt like scrolling the entire window was too much, so I just wanted half the window:
 (defun pixel-scroll-interpolate-half-down () (interactive) (pixel-scroll-precision-interpolate (/ (- (window-text-height nil t)) 2) nil 1)) (defun pixel-scroll-interpolate-half-up () (interactive) (pixel-scroll-precision-interpolate (/ (window-text-height nil t) 2) nil 1)) 
 Making the scroll wheel go past, I don't know, maybe a fifth of the window would be cool.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For example if I'm using typescript and I have the following data:
 const orbitRatios = { mercury: 0.2408467, venus: 0.61519726, ... neptune: 164.79132, }; 
 I can easily create a type that contains all the keys of orbitRatios
 type Planet = keyof typeof orbitRatios; 
 instead of manually doing something like
 type Planet = "mercury" | "earth" | ... 
 and if orbitRatios get updated or extended I don't have to manually update the type.
 I wonder What is the mentality to approach the same problem using haskell.
 What I did is
 orbitRatios :: [(String, Double)] orbitRatios = [ ("mercury", 0.2408467), ("venus", 0.61519726), ... ("neptune", 164.79132) ] test :: String -> Double -> Double test planetName elapsedTime = case mRatio of Nothing -> do something otherwise -> do something where mRatio = lookup planetName orbitRatios 
 the function accepts wherever string and I have to check against a list of tuples if the given key does exist.
 is this the appropriate way?

I have spent quite a lot of time trying to figure out how to set up eglot, corfu, cape etc. on my python project but the results are "meh". I get generic suggestions, it is not really able to pick up internals of classes (suggest methods etc. after I type object_name dot...) or even other imported modules and in general it is nowhere nearly as usable as VS code (which I am not a fan of). So, either my expectations are too high or I am doing something wrong!
 Can anyone post or point me to the simplest code completion initl.el setup in Emacs that I can use? I don't have the time to spend weeks trying to debug this stuff, unfortunately. Sometimes and just sometimes, I would like things to work out of the box without having to become an expert in every package that is out there. Apologies if this sounds like I am lazy, I am not but deadlines, work, life... 
 Thanks!

 To prevent my config getting too complicated, I'm trying to set up seperate configs. I want to use chemacs2 to switch between profiles.
 https://github.com/plexus/chemacs2
 My .emacs-profiles.el looks like this:
 (("default" . ((user-emacs-directory . "~/.emacs.d-default")))
 ("astro" ((user-emacs-directory . "~/.emacs.d-astro")))
 )
 If I just start emacs by typing in 'emacs' at terminal, my default profile loads. As I believe it should.
 I think I should be able to load my astro profile by typing 'emacs --with-profile astro'.
 However, this loads emacs with no init. The init in my astro profile does not load.
 How can I get the astro profile to load?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am experiencing a total slowdown in a fresh emacs instance, started with `-Q` (which as I understand starts without `.emacs` init so as to produce an unbiased measurement). The file is around 1800 lines of a list of non-enclosed braced sublist in a C header file, i.e. a syntactically incorrect file of:
 ​
 { one, two, three, four },
 { five, six, seven, eight },
 ...1800 more lines...
 As soon as I put the braces around the whole list, i.e. one opening `{` in line 1 and one closing `}` in line 1800, the slowdown is reduced (but still a bit noticeable). The performance monitor (mem) shows that it is indeed the handling of a braced list:
 877,399,714 70% - redisplay_internal (C function)
 877,226,114 70% - jit-lock-function
 877,226,114 70% - jit-lock-fontify-now
 877,221,930 70% - jit-lock--run-functions
 877,221,930 70% - #<compiled -0x1550d26a13fe3ac7>

 873,729,173 70% - #<compiled -0xee9b6e5ecb4f73d>
 861,984,604 69% - c-get-fontification-context
 859,903,452 69% - c-inside-bracelist-p
 858,589,113 69% + c-looking-at-or-maybe-in-bracelist
 1,165,232 0% + c-backward-over-enum-header
 365,361,651 29% + command-execute
 287,920 0% + timer-event-handler
 56 0% mouse--click-1-maybe-follows-link
 48 0% + tooltip-show-help
 0 0% ...
 Are we stuck with this kind of performance degradation in braced or somehow else bracketed lists? 1800 lines is not small but it also isn't really big.
 I know that the syntax is illegal but honestly I don't think that the editor should make this a problem for the user.

 I was not sure if I should use ScalablyTyped.

 Note: Given that I'm trying to develop a little game with three.js with ton of mutations, perhaps Scala.js doesn't make sense lol

 But (at least on linux) shift-insert and ctrl-insert work as copy/paste everywhere, including the terminal and emacs!
 Of course, the insert key is not near the home row on most keyboards, but I set up my qmk firmware to move it close. Your operating system probably has some way to remap something handy like super-c/super-v to shift-insert/ctrl-insert.

 I wonder if anyone here uses beorg on iOS for their org agenda?
 I subscribe to the "many tiny org files" method, and it works totally fine on the desktop (especially with org-roam).
 With beorg, I have significant sync slow downs. To the tune of 10 seconds. That makes it practically unusable. 
 I experimented with only including org files that have * TODOs in the them and that made a huge difference -- from ~10 seconds to sub second. It makes sense since I have a few thousand org files, but only a handful of them have TODOs.
 In any case, does anyone have any advice on how to expose only a subset of org files to beorg while maintaining a master copy on my desktop?

My problem is whenever I use the interactive Emacs customize system it updates any committed customization of variables in a new custom-set-variables list which it tacks onto the end of my init.el file. IOW, it doesn't know I want it stored in my-custom.el And so now I have a new version and an out-of-date version of custom-set-variables in my-custom.el. Also the custom-set-faces list gets tacked onto the end of init.el whenever I change that. Is there any way to have Emacs understand that I want at least custom-set-variables accessed, changed only from the my-custom.el?

 it started as a small collection of utilities and then i decided to package it, it helps the user create links between different blocks of text in (possibly) different files, similar to org-roam but not restricted to org headings/files, the patterns that can be linked to are defined using regex, and grep (or another tool, e.g. ripgrep or emacs itself) can be used behind the scenes to find the links when blk-open-at-point is invoked, this is the baseline functionality but much more is possible, including navigating to functions in source code by their names (e.g. your init.el) and inserting links from your elisp files to your org files and vice versa (inserting a link to an elisp function in an org file, without having to worry about the filenames, only about the function's name as that is how its found when using blk-open-at-point).
 i would be happy to answer any questions, please note that this is still very much a work in progress but i feel it is perhaps time i received some feedback. so any criticism/suggestions are welcome. thank you!

Alias the current module with Imp by Taylor Fausak
Sometimes when writing a Haskell module you want to use an identifier that would be ambiguous. For example perhaps you’re writing a logger and want to call a function log. That’s a problem because the Prelude also defines a function called log. You can’t use either one without disambiguating. Usually you will disambiguate by qualifying the identifier like MyLogger.log. This is fine but it is a little annoying because it duplicates the name of the module. If you later refactor this module by changing its name, you’ll also have to update a…]]></summary>

 We use Scala and the university recommended using Linux Fedora as our OS. I always had some troubles with Scala but now we approach the exam and now my Scala doesn't work anymore.
 First I had a problem with Java Home, which seems to be fixed, but now the next one is even more significant.
 I cant even run the scalac command in cmd and anytime a function is mentioned in code when I paste it, it spews out the same old Error 6.
 Yes, I have tried running code I know works and the error persists.
 ​
 At this point I'm just clueless and if I can't fix this i will just return to Windows

 However I think some of these shortcuts are not just appending the existing keybindes on emacs (which is expected), but making the existing keybinds unusable.
 For example, I cannot press `C-x-C-s` or `C-s` on `--with-ns` version on emacs. It is wierd that these keybinds cannot be scannable for emacs. When I press it, emacs simply do not responding. The minibuffer waits for next input like `C-x-C-` even if I pressed multiple times `s`, and when i pressing other key on keyboard, It responds and that other binding is executed. I'm able to use `S-s` for saving and `S-f` for I-search instead, but these keybindings are not comfortable for my hands, so I really want to use the original one.
 Is there anyone experiencing same thing on macOS? Or if anyone has ideas on how to fix it, I'd really appreciate it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[TL;DR
 When I follow an attachment: type link, how does Org mode know where the target is?
 Details
 I'm (re-)getting to grips with attachments and remembered something that puzzled me the first time but I never resolved. Suppose I have the following:
 (setq org-attach-preferred-new-method 'id) (setq org-attach-method 'cp) (set org-id-method 'ts) (setq org-attach-store-link-p 'attached) 
 and I then create a brand new heading and attach a file -- call it myfile.org -- to it.
 I will end up with the following:
  
the heading having had a property drawer created and an ID property inserted, with a value of something like 20240403T211636.762842
 a copy of myfile.org placed in <something>/20/240403T211636.762842/, and
 a link added to org-stored-links as ("attachment:myfile.org" "myfile.org")
  
Then, if Igo somewhere else entirely -- another file in my vast Org estate, say -- and use C-c C-l to run org-insert-link and choose that new link, I'll end up with this inserted:
 [[attachment:myfile.org][myfile.org]] 
 (which may well be rendered to look like myfile.org, but it's the above text underneath nevertheless.)
 Finally, if I follow that link, e.g. using C-c C-o to org-open-at-point -- I'm taken to the attached file, <something>/20/240403T211636.762842/myfile.org
 How does Org know where that file is?

 or is it a matter of taste?

Most of the times I'd open the agenda buffer alongside the org daily buffer so I can document accordingly to what's shown in the agenda for today. I also use org-clock, so if I were to find the timeline of a certain task after seeing it in my dailies, I'd search for the corresponding day in the agenda (with M-x calendar) then check of the clock logs. 
 I wonder if there's a better way to link org-agenda directly with dailies. I thought of going with simple org-agenda-add-note but this loses the functionality of org-roam linking + Encryption becomes harder

        <updated>2024-04-03T22:14:07.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello!
I have started using The Archive about a couple of days ago in order to centralise my note taking - as I discovered that I've been jumping between the Simplenote and Apple Notes for a while now. Was using NValt some time ago, but it's become grossly outdated and unstable.
I love the idea behind The Archive and its implementation is both visually and conceptually appealing. However, I've discovered a couple of issues with it:
The most annoying one is when I get past one page of writing text in a note - in a particularly long paragraph, the frame starts jolting every time I press "Space" - scrolling quickly down and up, until I start a new paragraph, and then this behaviour disappears. It might be that this problem has already been reported, but I could not find it in the forum - perhaps I was using wrong keywords.
Another issue is with the displaying of the Cyrillic letter "и" (which roughly corresponds to the Latin "i" as in the word "Tim") - for some reason, occasionally it starts to be displayed with a different background to the rest of the text - as if there was a rectangle behind it. I didn't have enough play with different fonts and themes (using PrettyFunctional with Dark mode and the UbuntuMono-Regular 20.0 pt. at the moment)
I hope someone can advise me on how to overcome the above issues, thank you!]]></summary>

 sometimes I have a piece of data that appears in different contexts, an example would be the amount of a payment that would be both part of a speadsheed calculation as well as part of a todo-item.
 Is there any way to enter this data only on one location and somehow refer to it from other locations to ensure that everything is consistent?
 I am aware that you can refer from a table cell to a cell in another table - is there something similar for headlines?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In Brick.Forms , the way to create a new form is that you have a Haskell data type with some pre defined fields which then become the corresponding input in the brick form.
  
This module provides an input form API. This API allows you to construct an input interface based on a data type of your choice. Each input in the form corresponds to a field in your data type. This API then automatically dispatches keyboard and mouse input events to each form input field, manages rendering of the form, notifies the user when a form field's value is invalid, and stores valid inputs in your data type when possible 
  
I have a requirement where, I have, say a list of column names from a db table, and I want to make a brick form to insert a new row in the db table.
 Since I could select any db table at run time, the column names can change at run time.
 So at best the data type I can have is a thin wrapper around the list of column names. 
 How can I make brick form with such a data type?
 For simplicity lets assume, the form ,for all the input fields rendered, accepts only string values or Text values. 
 If I cannot make a form with such a data type, what are the alternatives?

 I'd like to share with you a small pet project I started months ago as an excuse to learn about Scala 3 macros, and then evolved into a Scala 3 compiler plugin :))
 Sometimes, for convenience, it's easy to dump a whole case class into console/log, because of the way Scala neatly formats all its content; however, if that class contains sensitive data like api keys / PIIs / other sensitive data, you probably wouldn't want to leak these fields by mistake.
 Therefore, enter redacted:
  
include redacted compiler plugin
 import redacted annotation
 mark sensitive fields with @redacted
  
and you're good to go!
 Hope you'll like it and find it useful :)

 As jgm pointed out, conditionally deriving the instances would violate a library policy (although maybe it's ok to have features enabled for later language versions idk).
 Is there a better way of doing this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am working on a JSON formatting library. Suppose the following structure:
 Text.JSON.Format ├── Text.JSON.Format.Object └── Text.JSON.Format.Array 
 Where the outermost Text.JSON.Format exports ppValue to prettyprint a JSON Value which in turn uses ppObject and ppArray from respective internal modules.
 The problem is, when prettyprinting an object or an array, you would need to refer to ppValue to prettyprint the values inside the object or array, which cannot be done without creating a cyclic dependency.
 If that's unclear, here's the simplified project:
 ```haskell module Text.JSON.Format (ppValue) where
 import qualified Data.Aeson as Aeson import Prettyprinter
 import Text.JSON.Format.Object (ppObject) import Text.JSON.Format.Array (ppArray)
 ppValue :: Int -> Aeson.Value -> Doc ann ppValue nesting = \case Aeson.Object obj -> ppObject nesting obj Aeson.Array arr -> ppArray nesting arr other -> ppByteStringLazy $ Aeson.encode other ```
  
```haskell module Text.JSON.Format.Object (ppObject) where
 import qualified Data.Aeson as Aeson import Text.JSON.Format (ppValue) -- error!
 ppObject :: Int -> Aeson.Object -> Doc ann ppObject nesting obj = ... -- uses ppValue ```
  
```haskell module Text.JSON.Format.Array (ppArray) where
 import qualified Data.Aeson as Aeson import Text.JSON.Format (ppValue) -- error!
 ppArray :: Int -> Aeson.Array -> Doc ann ppArray nesting arr = ... -- uses ppValue ```
 There would be no problem when ppObject and ppArray are defined in the same module as ppValue, had their implementations not been too bulky and complex; sadly they are, thus it would be better to separate them. But how could this be done without creating a cyclic dependency?
 Here's the repo for anyone interested in the full code.

Sometimes, the user types a command that exists but the tree it is acting on has the wrong shape. In this case, I want to override cl-no-applicable-method so that the code automatically inserts a template definition for the command in the correct file. If the command definitions were functions, this would be easy using find-function, but because they are methods, find-function cannot find the files where they are defined. Is there a way to solve this?

 Can you see a notable difference? 
 What are your experiences with the new parser? 
 this question can be a bit early due parser has merged like \2 days ago) but I would like to hear your opinions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Visible changes in addition to the usual bug fixes:
 Compiler-plugin:
  
first release with automatic generation for 'shifted variants' of high-order functions. It is possible when the ho function does not store functional arguments in variables but only invokes (as in map). This is the work of Olena Kravchenko during her GSoC-2023 project. More details can be found in Olena-s presentation: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1H5rIQlqeektpZAnC547YnlPoXChrH99UOLMy4kY-pRQ/edit?usp=sharing and GitHub discussion: https://github.com/rssh/dotty-cps-async/discussions/79.
 Added compile-time checks for attempts to use direct syntax when the compiler plugin is not enabled. It is possible to freely mix code compiled with and without a plugin, if you accidentally forget the plugin when it was needed, you will receive a compile-time error.
  
Logic module:
  
Extend API, add a few examples in tests, and an implementation of CpsLogicMonad over LazyList.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As a polyglot software engineer by day (and by night, and in the morning, too), I'm always keen to tweak editors I use via any scripting language available. (I'm that weird guy in the dark corner of the room who likes BOTH Emacs AND Vim precisely because they are so extensible.)
In fact, org-roam for Emacs is what turned me onto Zettelkasten, but I (so far) like the system you've evolved for managing the Zettels better, which is why I went ahead and purchased The Archive. My only complaint is that The Archive limited to Mac OS X, because I work on Windoze and Linux as well.
So, any info about what you're planning that feature to entail would be of great interest to me.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[EDIT: I fixed it. Open straight build and repo folders, delete auctex, reopen emacs, and the problem disappears
 I've used AUCTeX for ages but I seem to have recurring issues with it loading. I recently started up Emacs (29.1, Emacs for MacOS) and got an error that "auctex.elc failed to provide feature 'auctex'". I tried deleting the build folder and having it recompile, I tried upgrading to 29.3, but I can't get AUCTeX to load. My googling has failed to surface anything relevant. Any ideas that people have would be greatly appreciated.
 I use straight.el with use-package for package management and initialization.
 The relevant portion of my config is:
 (use-package auctex :config (require 'tex) (load "preview-latex.el" nil t t) (add-hook 'LaTeX-mode-hook (flyspell-mode 1)) (add-hook 'LaTeX-mode-hook (auto-fill-mode -1)) (add-hook 'LaTeX-mode-hook (visual-line-mode 1)) (add-hook 'TeX-mode-hook (flyspell-mode 1)) (add-hook 'TeX-mode-hook (auto-fill-mode -1)) (add-hook 'TeX-mode-hook (visual-line-mode 1)) (add-hook 'latex-mode-hook (flyspell-mode 1)) (add-hook 'latex-mode-hook (auto-fill-mode -1)) (add-hook 'latex-mode-hook (visual-line-mode 1)) (add-hook 'markdown-mode-hook(auto-fill-mode -1)) ) 
 which throws the following error
 Error (use-package): auctex/:catch: Loading file /Users/me/.emacs.d/package-repos/straight/build/auctex/auctex.elc failed to provide feature ‘auctex’ 
 I also tried changing my config to the following as described in the auctex manual
 (use-package tex :ensure auctex ) 
 but it give me this error if I try to run it
 Debugger entered--Lisp error: (error "Could not find package tex. Updating recipe reposi...") 
 Possibly related to my upgrade, I'm also getting this new error
 crux/:catch: Symbol’s chain of function indirections contains a loop: ConTeXt-mode

This is yet another opportunity to share with your friends what you are working on. Add to this discussion by telling us about your zettelkasten journey. Share with us what you're learning. Sharing helps me and, hopefully, you, too. It helps us clarify our goals and visualize our thinking. And sometimes, a conversation sparks a magical moment where we can dive into an idea worth exploring. We'd love to hear more from you.   🫵🏼
Ideas I'm exploring with my ZK:
I'm thinking a lot about metaphors and how they shape language. How they are used to communicate ideas. How they are used in ideation.
I'm reexamining how I can refactor my structure notes, transforming them into thinking tools. What does this mean, and how can I formalize this for myself?
I am integrating the project-driven areas of my life into my ZK. This week, my attention turned to melding my Samu Practice into my ZK, hoping for some serendipitical magic.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to use Emacs and one vim feature I miss so much is digraphs, i.e. inserting some additional (Unicode) symbols with two keypresses that describe it.
 Say, if I need to insert ä in vim, I press Ctrl-K a :, and that's it.
 In Emacs I have Ctrl-x 8 RET, but that is extremely inconvenient, because I have to remember how symbol is called in Unicode table or look it up from recent symbols. If you need to paste some words in German or Greek, it's really cumbersome.
 Is there a package that replicates vim behaviour?
 SOLVED: Ctrl-x 8 " a gives me ä. For other symbols check help via Ctrl-x 8 Ctrl-h. Big thanks to u/lostcoffee.

 I can write a single interpreter function, but I need to call it for each event type, which could add quite a number of interpreters of the stack, and I'm wondering if I could write it in a way that I can just add one interpreter and be done with it.
 Here's the simplest code to demonstrate the issue:
 https://gist.github.com/kephas/90a0cd7fb719bfdf6077c4b57efd5758
 As you can see, I need to do run $ runFakeEventStore @Int $ runFakeEventStore @Char $ program. The question is, is there a way to write runFakeEvenstore so that I can just do run $ runFakeEventStore program?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Based on valuable feedback and the challenges many of us face during online coding interviews or sessions, I've pushed a significant update to the Chrome-Emacs extension that extends its compatibility to more environments.
 This includes experimental support for vscode.dev, codesandbox.com, GitHub Codespaces, and other online Monaco-based editors where direct API access is unavailable.
 The update relies on simulating user interactions to achieve real-time synchronization from Emacs to the browser. Given the complexity of these platforms, the feature primarily supports synchronization from Emacs to the browser, with additional nuances due to the simulation approach.
 Important to Note:
 This experimental feature heavily relies on the presence of some default keyboard shortcuts within these web editors. These shortcuts are essential for simulating actions such as selection, deletion, and text navigation.
 For a detailed explanation and the full list of these shortcuts, please refer to our documentation on experimental Monaco support.
 I also primarily tested it on Linux. Although I have translated shortcuts to be Mac-compatible too, I haven't tested it extensively.
 Try It Out: If you’re interested in testing this feature or want to see how Chrome-Emacs can enhance your coding sessions, visit the Chrome Web Store. Source code and installation instructions are available in this repository.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am trying to publish a HTML webpage using an Org file. I am using a very standard Lisp script that I execute in the terminal as: emacs -Q --script script.el following some of the work of System Crafters and some references on oc.el and CSL. 
 (require 'ox-publish) (setq org-publish-project-alist '( ("org-notes" :base-directory "./content" :base-extension "org" :publishing-directory "./public" :recursive t :publishing-function org-html-publish-to-html :headline-levels 4 :auto-preamble t ) ("org-static" :base-directory "./content" :base-extension "css\\|js\\|png\\|jpg\\|gif\\|pdf\\|mp3\\|ogg\\|swf\\|txt\\|cur\\|svg\\|csv\\|json" :publishing-directory "./public" :recursive t :publishing-function org-publish-attachment ) ("org" :components ("org-notes" "org-static")))) (org-publish "org") 
 I am using a csl file rather than the basic or bibtex options in my Org file:
 #+AUTHOR: Me #+BIBLIOGRAPHY: ~/bib/references.bib #+CITE_EXPORT: csl ~/Zotero/styles/apa.csl 
 When I export directly from Org-mode to a PDF or a HTML there is no error, but when I run my script.el, which is my preferred approach, I get the following error:
  eval-buffer(#<buffer *load*> nil "/Users/topcat/projects/notes_org/build-site.el" nil t) #f(compiled-function (buffer file) #<bytecode 0x146acef1111a2e2b>)(#<buffer *load*> "/Users/topcat/projects/notes_org/build-site.el") load-with-code-conversion("~/projects/notes_org/build-site.el" "/Users/topcat/projects/notes_org/build-site.el" nil t #f(compiled-function (buffer file) #<bytecode 0x146acef1111a2e2b>)) command-line--load-script("~/projects/notes_org/build-site.el") command-line-1(("-scriptload" "./build-site.el")) command-line() normal-top-level() Citeproc library is not loaded 
 I am bit lost and haven't found good documentation regarding references using oc.el in HTML project exports. Does anyone here has more experience with it?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Emacs is good, maybe the best but being the best comes with a lot of baggage. With the global obesity epidemic, we don’t need our software bloated with functionality too. Leave the productivity hamster wheel to the AIs.
 Let the lean times begin. We are stripping down our software as we do our souls. You are all invited to help us build Emins. Emins will run only on 8086 processors attached to VT52 terminals, eliminating all that overhead of window systems, multitasking OSes and all that #ifdefed C code. Lisp will be replaced with the direct control and numeric accuracy of the native instruction set. Key bindings will be limited to standard ones on C-a to C-z. Although this will make writing hard, it will save a lot of work and compositions that, let’s face it, are often written but not read. With all that extra time, we could finish the HURD, embed Scheme everywhere and write tools in simple languages to support all the complex languages people actually use.
 Come join us as we build Emins and keep a lid on the software complexity that only graybeards can handle.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone, I just fixed a long-time annoyance I had with evil-mode. I couldn't find this info online so I thought I'd share it.
 Problem:
 In regular evil-mode, when you copy or format some text, evil will mess with your highlighted region (if you are in a visual mode) and your cursor. The cursor position will always be set to the original point or mark preferring the one which comes first. If you are in visual mode it will always unhighlight your region, which I also find annoying.
 Cursor Example
  
If you highlight from left to right and yank, your cursor will jump to where you started highlighting.
 If you highlight from right to left and yank, the cursor will stay where you stopped highlighting.
 If you highlight top to bottom and yank, your cursor will jump to where you started …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have two machines: my laptop and a VPS. They do not share a filesystem. I regularly ssh into the server from the laptop and work on the commandline. I use a terminal emulator which runs in emacs on the laptop. Sometimes this involves opening files, often automatically, in $EDITOR (e.g. for a git commit). I want to configure $EDITOR so that the instance of emacs running the terminal emulator is also used as $EDITOR on the server, when I'm sshed into it. Ideally, I'd like to set it up so that if I ssh from a terminal which isn't running in emacs, a different program (one local to the server, e.g. nano) will be used, but that's a later question.
 How can I do this? I've read a cursory explanation here, but that seems to require a shared filesystem, and it's pretty brief -- I'm new to any kind of networking. I do like the idea of using emacsserver to achieve all this though.
 TIA!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Im migrating from Jetbrains Pycharm into Emacs and I was wondering if there is a way I can get autocompletions similar to Pycharm, this is:
 1 - Some way of "auto importing" modules (or at least some way of given a class/function get the option to import it)
 2 - LSP for internal stuffs, atm my lsp desnt seem to "know" about many homebrew classes' methods we have in our project.
 Here is the current LSP cfg i have on my emacs
 (use-package pyvenv
 :config
 (pyvenv-mode 1))
 (use-package python-mode
 :ensure t
 :hook (python-mode . lsp-deferred)
 :custom
 ;; NOTE: Set these if Python 3 is called "python3" on your system!
 (python-shell-interpreter "python3")
 (dap-python-executable "python3")
 (dap-python-debugger 'debugpy)
 :config
 (require 'dap-python))
 ​
 ​
 (use-package company
 :after lsp-mode
 :hook (lsp-mode . company-mode)
 :bind (:map company-active-map
 ("<tab>" . company-complete-selection))
 (:map lsp-mode-map
 ("<tab>" . company-indent-or-complete-common))
 :custom
 (company-minimum-prefix-length 1)
 (company-idle-delay 0.0))
 ​
 (use-package company-box
 :hook (company-mode . company-box-mode))
 ​
 (use-package importmagic
 :ensure t
 :config
 (add-hook 'python-mode-hook 'importmagic-mode)) 
 ​
 ​
 Maybe I just need a clear example of how to set up LSP properly, thanks in advance guys, sorry if im asking anything too obvious/stupid

 I'm a Software Engineer Master student (2nd semester) located in Denmark, and have recently chosen to quit my previous student job meaning I'm currently looking for a new one. I'd love to get to develop in Haskell (I know it's most likely not possible), and was wondering if anyone knows any company/project that may be willing to have a student worker, most likely remotely?
 I've programmed in Haskell for a bit more than a year now, and have recently passed a functional programming course at my university (1st semester on the master), where we programmed in Haskell.
 Please let me know if I should fill my post with additional info (experience, preferences, etc.).
 Thank you for your help!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I do not know Haskell, or much functional programming, but I’ve been digging through research papers in a particular field of interest and Haskell is used in most of them.
 After further research, I’ve come to an assessment that Haskell is considered a “white paper” language that isn’t used outside of universities and enthusiasts. I’ve looked into it a bit, as well as other functional languages and realized I’ve been using functional programming for most of my career without really considering it. I use power query from excel for data migration, and it is a functional language called “m code” that is related to F#.
 I think it may be worth while to learn Haskell, mainly as it forms the foundation of many Domain Specific Languages in the research papers I’ve been reading, but it led me to think maybe Haskell has untapped potential on AI driven development.
 Because Haskell’s stigma as a “whitepaper” language, and often not used outside of the academic setting (just as viewed from outside observation), wouldn’t code quality in training datasets naturally be of a higher quality than the sea of sloppy JavaScript and terabytes of poorly written Python scripts?
 Has anyone experimented with ai generated Haskell code?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After installing themes from repos by cloning them mostly from Github into my themes directory it looks I need to copy the theme-xx.el files to the top-level themes directory to get them to be detected.
 I am not sure whether some or all of the files which remaining in the repo subdirectories need to be copied to the top level themesdirectory, but I presume that some of the files may be necessary to the full and correct functioning of the themes, such as the contents of their img directories.
 There is also the matter of not being able to commit their directories because they are git repos themselves and I don't know how useful it may be to add them as sub-repos.
 How do I work my way around this?
 Is there some means of installing a theme by running some additonal code in some files it is associated with or is just copying the main theme files to your themes folder enough?
 Maybe my theme installation code needs to iterate every directory in the themes directory and execute a file .el matching the directory name, rather than just placing them in the themes directory?

Because of how og-info.js works, it is loading slowly and flashes as the js waits and tries to determine how long the file is and all its headers (I think this is how it works).
 I was just reading about css :has() property and thought, why can't that be used in loading up an exported html file?
 What I want as an end result is a Table of Contents, and then clicking on each link, displays the section under that org heading with links to sub-headings.
 I think the closest alternative is the ReadTheOrg theme, but I would like it without a sidebar.
 Anyone know any alternatives or js free versions?
 If not, any guidance on how I would approach this situation with my own css and if needed only minimal js?

 Last year, my wfie and I walked the Camino Santigo and, since I had plenty of time to think and not much else to do, I started to think about how to better plan the daily stages. It takes 30-40 days to complete and guidebooks tend to give stages for a "normal" pilgrim; we discovered that we started flagging at about 25km or so.
 So building a Camino planner that optimises the stages for the entire journey, based on people's preferences in terms of distance, time, accommodation etc. became that project.
 You can give the result a spin at https://de-calixtinus.org It's a yesod website that uses dynamic programming to plan out the route. The source code is at https://github.com/charvolant/de-calixtinus
 I'm painfully aware that this has been a learning project. You can see traces of it where, for example, I've become comfortable with something like applicative programming but haven't got around to rethinking previous stuff in the light of my new knowledge. Yesod is a bugger to learn and the scaffolding makes it wilfully obscure, so you can see where I've been going through things in a step-wise fashion, slowly pulling stuff in from the scaffolding once I've understood what's going on. The fields work, but there's obviously more stuff needed. The configuration is trapped partway between where it was a stand-alone program and where it became a web application. And so on.
 If any kind soul wanted to look over the code and suggest improvements or completely better ways of looking at things, I'd be most grateful.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi! I’m fairly new to org-mode, and trying to set it up for academic reasons. I’m studying engineering, so I’m seriously eyeing the inline LaTeX rendering capabilities of org-mode for notetaking. I first downloaded MiKTeX and installed it with the provided installer (it seems like dvipng is included in MiKTeX) then tried configuring org-mode to render with dvipng, by adding the following to my init.el file:
 (setq org-preview-latex-default-process 'dvipng) (setq org-latex-create-formula-image-program 'dvipng) (setq org-preview-latex-process-alist '((dvipng :programs ("latex" "dvipng") :description "dvi > png" :message "you need to install the programs: latex and dvipng." :image-input-type "dvi" :image-output-type "png" :image-size-adjust (1.0 . 1.0) :latex-compiler ("latex -interaction nonstopmode -output-directory %o %f") :image-converter ("dvipng -fg %F bg %B -D %D -T tight -o %O %f")) )) 
 However, if I type some inline LaTeX in an org-mode file and try to compile it with C-c C-x C-l, I get the following message: 
 Creating LaTeX previews in region... org-compile-file: File "c:/Users/USERNAME/AppData/Local/Temp/orgtexTelk2W.dvi" wasn’t produced. Please adjust ‘dvipng’ part of ‘org-preview-latex-process-alist’. 
 Does anyone know what I might have done wrong? I read this post, but no log files seem to have been generated for me. If I run "latex c:/Users/USERNAME/AppData/Local/Temp/orgtexTelk2W.tex" in the command line it generates a dvi file of the same name; running "dvipng c:/Users/USERNAME/AppData/Local/Temp/orgtexTelk2W.dvi" seems to also generate a proper png image with the same name. When I check the log for generating the dvi file, it provides a bunch of information but seemingly does not show any errors.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm not 100%, but I believe after updating to Emacs 29.3 on Arch Linux, X11 instances and clients will only work for a few minutes until they freeze. After that, any attempts to create a new frame will result in frozen frames; I just see the "When done with this frame..." message in the minibuffer, and otherwise have no keyboard input. The same thing happens with emacs -Q. 
 If I open a client or instance in the terminal, however, everything works fine. With clients, I've tried looking at messages, but I don't see anything out of the ordinary. Is there anything I can do to try to pinpoint the issue?
 I am using fcitx5, if that has any potential consequences.

 I working on a personal project in which I am signing up users. I am taking their password, hashing it using password and wanting to store it in the postgresql db. I was using Generic instance so far. But it seems the `PasswordHash` type does not have instance of ToRow.
 One solution that is coming to my mind is to unwrap the PasswordHash type and store the text in the DB.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm just starting to learn org-agenda and I have a workflow in mind where, e.g., I need to install blinds in an apartment. So I begin with a heading. Then I do C-c C-t and choose TODO which adds TODO to the heading and opens an add note box. I write something preliminary, and this is added as list item with a timestamp
 * TODO APT B7 Blinds :sometag:someothertag: - State "TODO" from [2024-03-30 Sat 23:02] \\ B7 requested blinds. 
 Now, in my mind, I want to have a connected task such as "order blinds" somewhere relating to this particular TODO entry -- I'm thinking in another org file of just orders. This orders.org will then have a header 
 * Order B7 Blinds :sometag: 
 then I make it TODO and add details of the ordering to the note. I come from the relational database world where the instinct is not to crowd everything into one table, rather create a new table to normalize. But is that "best practice" with org-agenda? My instinct is to separate out all the stages, parts of the project install blinds. However, what I might have seen so far is people simply adding sub-headings for each sub-task, stage, etc. So the ordering blinds might be a sub-heading TODO? Or perhaps just more added list items? What's the best practice here?

 I opened a file in my project and was prompted to import the project root, that worked great (that's fll-sw/working-dir below). My project is built using gradlew.
 I then started a new git worktree in issues/1168... and opened a file in there. I got errors about all kinds of missing imports. When I run lsp-describe-session I get the output below. The file "Playoff.java" has been opened from issues/1168, the other files are opened from fll-sw/working-dir. I see that the jdtls process id is the same for both directories and that seems odd to me given that they are different projects.
 Can someone point me to documentation on what I'm not doing correctly here?

 When exporting (to PDF or HTML) an Org file containing lisp blocks, what might cause a lisp error that goes away without making any changes to the file in question, but only if I close and re-open emacs having first run desktop-clear?

 I'm converting my emacs config to use babel, and so I'm currently hacking and pruning and generally beating my init.el into shape in the new form of a new and nicely narrated config.org.
 From time to time, when I try to export the growing org file, I'm running into an error of the form: Wrong type argument: listp ... always in reference to the same setq of one particular variable. However, if instead of exporting I simply tangle the .org to produce the target .el, the tangling reports no error, and the resulting lisp is all fine too. Export …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello ! 
 I'm getting into FP and I was wondering of how hard & practical it would be implement Leetcode type of questions in a purely functional way (Scala for instance).
 I do feel not using any mutable variable would make some algorithms more complicated to implement. The code would be perhaps harder to read. Sometimes less efficient as well. 
 What are your thoughts on this? Would you say FP and immutability make sense for some more or less complex algorithms? 
 Also, once again I'm no FP expert but I'd tend to think it's okay to have mutable state if the method do not produce any real side effects. As long as no class instance variables or global variables are mutated by a method, having some "var" inside a method can be an okay choice if it makes the code more readable and efficient. Why would it be so bad to have a "var" inside a pure method? 
 I'd love to hear your thoughts. 
 Thanks in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The title is mostly ironic. If you have reasons please share though.
 Emacs seems to have a marketing problem.
 Its almost everyday that I see videos that talk about using Vim and its derivatives and it's generally positive.
 On the otherhand when I look on YouTube "why use Emacs", the search indexes plenty of videos saying why you shouldn't.
 Maybe this just says something about the recommendation engine's belief about what I'll watch is, but that's why I'm making this thread.
 I'm a newb so I'm still learning a lot and that's really the main drive for me. I can't remember what made me invest into Emacs, but I think it had to do with Vim changing conventions every couple years while Emacs seems stable and centralized to its ways.
 What's your experience?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[lisp (use-package centaur-tabs :init (centaur-tabs-mode t) :config (setq centaur-tabs-set-icons t centaur-tabs-set-modified-marker t centaur-tab-buffer-local-list '(("\\*scratch\\*" :hide t) ("\\*Warnings\\*" :hide t) ("\\*straight-process\\*" :hide t) ("\\*Messages\\*" :hide t))) :hook (dashboard-mode .

 This prevents buffers that - i don't want to get displayed as a tab - from getting displayed. How do i make every time C-x C-f is called open the file in a new centaur-tab instead of a normal Emacs buffer? I want multiple files to be open side-by-side...
 Thanks in advance, Emacs noob

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have the following sample agenda items:
 * Future ** A meeting non-recurring :meeting: SCHEDULED: <2024-03-30 Sat 11:00> ** Meeting recurring starting today :meeting: SCHEDULED: <2024-03-30 Sat 09:00+1d> ** Meeting recurring started before :meeting: SCHEDULED: <2024-03-27 Sat 18:00+1d> 
 The resulted agenda view for today is as follows:
 Today's agenda Saturday 30 March 2024 8:00...... ---------------- 8:10...... now - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 9:00...... Scheduled: Meeting recurring starting today :meeting: 10:00...... ---------------- 11:00...... Scheduled: A meeting non-recurring :meeting: 12:00...... ---------------- 14:00...... ---------------- 16:00...... ---------------- 18:00...... ---------------- 20:00...... ---------------- Sched. 3x: Meeting recurring started before :meeting: 
 Note, the same configuration, "Meeting recurring started before" does not have the expected timestamp shown. 
 Here is my settings related:
 (setq org-agenda-prefix-format '((agenda . " %?-12t% s") (todo . "%?-12t") (tags . "%?-12t") (search . "%?-12t"))) (agenda "" ((org-agenda-start-day "+0d") ; start from today (org-agenda-span 'day) (org-deadline-warning-days 0) (org-agenda-block-separator nil) (org-agenda-overriding-header "\nToday's agenda\n") ))

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was a heavy user of Emacs + org-mode. I really love(d) org-roam, had thousands of notes in it, would navigate them in a second, create powerful org-documents. But I felt the pain of not having access to my files on the go (both task management and notes). That's when I heavy heartedly switched to Obsidian for note taking and OmniFocus for task and project management.
 So I took the plunge and invsted a good amount of time into migrating my org-mode files into markdown files, and migrate them into my vault in Obsidian.
 As I missed a good editor in Obsidian for long documents, I asked myself recently why not edit my markdown files in Emacs. After all Obsidian stores all files in markdown format in a folder that's accessbile to any program.
 I realized that the tools I used previously in E…]]></summary>
