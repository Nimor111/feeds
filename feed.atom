        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On my home network I have two computers, both running Windows 10.
 On the desktop computer, I've got VcXsrv and WSL1 running, and I have the Linux build of Gnu Emacs 27.1 running under WSL and displaying through X Windows.
 On the laptop computer, I've got VcXsrv running.
 On the emacs on the desktop, I run M-x make-frame-on-display to pop up a frame on the laptop. This way, I have only one instance of emacs running, and I can view and edit the same buffers from both computers without worry of getting my files out of sync. (I tend to pace my apartment while I work, so it's nice to be able to access my buffers from two different rooms.)
 Unfortunately, when the laptop goes to sleep, the emacs on the desktop computer freezes for a few seconds and then crashes.
 What would you suggest as a workaround or fix?
 (Please don't suggest "delete the frame on the laptop before putting the laptop to sleep". Yes that would presumably work but I won't remember to do that.)

Apologies for the stupid question I've been using emacs for a few months now and have always just worked with my own (pretty poor) config and am just now realizing what lsp is and why it's useful lol.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, currently learning Haskell and pretty much everywhere I look I am told that one should avoid explicit recursion and try and use functional abstractions like fold or map.
 This has caused me some pain when, as an exercise, I was implementing the library function dropWhile. My initial implementation using explicit recursion looked like this:
 dropWhile :: (a -> Bool) -> [a] -> [a] dropWhile _ [] = [] dropWhile p xs@(x:xs') | p x = dropWhile' p xs' | otherwise = xs 
 This also seems to match the implementation used in the GHC source code.
 After some perusing I found an example using foldr as follows:
 dropWhile :: (a -> Bool )-> [a] -> [a] dropWhile p = fst . foldr f ([], []) where f x ~(xs,ys) = (if p x then xs else x:ys, x:ys) 
 After some head wracking I do understand the second definition. However I would like to know if this is a situation in which the implementation using explicit recursion is preferable as it is easier to reason about?

 But sometimes I want to use links with $NEXT instead of \very\long\path\to\Nextcloud in them and that seems to not really work. 
 Is there a way to make this work?

 ## Heading {#heading} 
 What I really want is just
 ## Heading 
 After reading the docs, I thought that the https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/doc/usage/#org-hugo-pandoc-cite-references-heading is responsible for setting this behaviour. But when I look through counsel-describe-variable, this variable doesn't show up in the list.
 Anyways, I've tried setting the variable via these two methods:
 Setting it in my config.el
 (use-package ox-hugo :ensure t :after ox :custom (org-hugo-base-dir ".") (org-hugo-front-matter-format "yaml") (org-hugo-section "braindump") (org-hugo-pandoc-cite-references-heading "")) 
 Setting it in .dir-locals.el
 ((nil . ((org-hugo-base-dir . ".") (org-hugo-front-matter-format . "yaml") (org-hugo-section . "braindump") (org-hugo-pandoc-cite-references-heading ""))) 
 But no luck.
 I've posted this issue in the ox-hugo github here https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/issues/449 but I figured maybe I can get a quicker response here since I think the issue is coming from my config not the package.
 EDIT:
 The author of the library replied in the GitHub issue. There is a way to disable it. But it doesn't help me in my overall goal. Thanks for reading.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am trying (with the blessing of the cabal maintainers and the haskell foundation) to spearhead an initiative to re-vamp the cabal documentation. Right now it is a combination of reference material, and a user guide. It would be nice to have a beginner friendly, linear guide that walks a newcomer through the most common use cases of cabal.
 I am trying to keep on top of the issue tracker and provide plenty of context. The first three sections have all their required chapters recorded in the issue tracker https://github.com/haskell/cabal-userguide/issues
 I plan on adding the more advanced chapters as issues later, but if anyone feels especially strongly about contributing those it would be greatly appreciated. They can be found in the SUMMARY.md https://github.com/haskell/cabal-userguide/blob/main/src/SUMMARY.md
 I want this project to be friendly to beginner contributors, so if you want to take an issue and learn as you write it, I would love that and will be happy to offer any guidance I can (as well as coercing more senior cabal contributors to offer input).
 Thanks everyone, I think this is a really important initiative to improve the haskell ecosystem for the uninitiated and the old guard alike!

build OCaml projects with Bazel.
Compared to the first OCaml ruleset published in
2016, which contains only a few basic rules, OBazl is under active development
and aims to provide highly granular, low-level control over the build, and
eventually automatically generate build files.
It is therefore a practical choice to enjoy Bazel’s incremental, parallel,
cacheable and remote building capacities.
However, it is in its early stages, requiring manual work for some tasks that
will be automated in the future.
To exemplify its usage, I will show how to convert the build of the
uri package to Bazel. Since OCaml and
Bazel is not a frequent combination, I will give an introduction to Bazel, as
well as some aspects of compiling OCaml modules.

 This is my init.el file:
 ;; Install use-package (condition-case nil (require 'use-package) (file-error (require 'package) (add-to-list 'package-archives '("melpa" . "http://melpa.org/packages/")) (package-initialize) (package-refresh-contents) (package-install 'use-package) (require 'use-package))) (use-package lsp-mode :ensure t) (use-package lsp-dart :ensure t :hook (dart-mode . lsp)) ;; Optional packages (use-package projectile :ensure t) ;; project management (use-package yasnippet :ensure t :config (yas-global-mode)) ;; snippets (use-package lsp-ui :ensure t) ;; UI for LSP (use-package company :ensure t) ;; Auto-complete ;; Optional Flutter packages (use-package hover :ensure t) ;; run app from desktop without emulator 
 which I copy-pasted from the emacs-lsp's github page.
 The problem is that I retrieve this error:
 Error (use-package): Failed to install lsp-dart: Package ‘lsp-dart-’ is unavailable Error (use-package): Failed to install projectile: Package ‘projectile-’ is unavailable Error (use-package): Cannot load projectile 
 and I cannot figure how to resolve it. 
 I've tried to install projectile using M-x package-install RET projectile RET (after enabling MELPA), but I get an error saying that projectile-2.3.0 cannot be found, while the MELPA website says that the projectile current version is 2.4.0.
 ​
 What am I missing?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was playing around with fancy record libaries and was very impressed with how well labels can infer types. Probably because it avoids unnecessary complexity and less-frequently-used operations.
 So I wanted to try how much unnecessary complexity and infrequently operations I could throw on top of it while maintaining reasonable type inference. Going back-and-forth between tuples and hlists mostly works but I ran into some troubles with the union operation.
 union:: (IsHList a l, IsHList b r, IsHList c (Concat l r)) => a -> b -> c -- infers nicely union l r -- infers nicely union l _ :: ("foo" := String, "bi" := String, "bar" := Int, "baz" := Double) -- uh oh union _ r :: ("foo" := String, "bi" := String, "bar" := Int, "baz" := Double) 
 The blame lies with this type family implementation which recurses on the first argument:
 type family Concat l r where Concat '[] a = a Concat (x ': xs) a = x ': Concat xs a 
 I found a way to make it work by going through type classes. If someone wants to try for themselves, here is a test case:
 l :: Proxy '[1,2] l = Proxy r :: Proxy '[3,4] r = Proxy cat :: IConcat a b c => Proxy a -> Proxy b -> Proxy c cat _ _ = Proxy c1 :: Proxy '[1,2,3,4] c1 = cat l _ -- _ :: Proxy '[3,4] c2 :: Proxy '[1,2,3,4] c2 = cat _ r -- _ :: Proxy '[1,2] c3 = cat l r -- c3 :: Proxy '[1,2,3,4] 
 And here is my solution https://gist.github.com/Tarmean/fc553829a044979e9c5c8b4d226270b1
 You might notice that my solutions is an ugly pile of hacks. Does anyone know of a cleaner/less silly solution?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'd like to hear about the layouts you've selected, particularly the placement of modifiers to be harmonious with Emacs keystrokes.
 Background, for normal, sane people who don't know what I'm talking about:
 One rabbit-hole on the edge of the custom / mechanical keyboard world is minimizing the number of keys so your fingers never have to stray far from the home row. Some boards, like the Ferris, have only 34 or 36 keys so you are never more than one key away.
 These keyboards make heavy use of 'layers' - additional custom 'modifier' keys you hold down to generate numbers, symbols, arrow and function keystrokes etc..
 For this, keys do double-duty where tapping generates a character, but holding down applies a modifier. E.g. you may have shift on F, so tapping F makes an f character, but holding it down while tapping another key it applies shift to that other key. This is referred to as "home row modifiers". Typically you'd make it symmetrical, with J as another shift, so you can use opposing hands for modifier and keystroke.
 But with Emacs, you often type modifier-key sequences that travel around the keyboard, like C-x C-k, for which alternating hands would be awkward. So I'm interested in the directions people have gone with their own keymap and what they've settled on.
 I'm playing with a Ferris Sweep, developing my own keymap, mostly as a 'game' in my spare time, but it may yet work out and become my working keyboard. I'm thinking of having Ctrl on a thumb just to deal with these Emacs sequences.

I noticed that the official quick start giter8 template akka/akka-quickstart-scala.g8 uses Scala version 2.13.1 
 I have attempted to add Akka dependencies to the Scala 3 template scala/scala3.g8 and also attempted to change the Scala version number in the Akka template but both result in unresolved dependencies and failed to build.
 Is there a way to get Scala 3 and Typed Akka up and running with current versions (I saw an older unofficial template from 2019 using Dotty but nothing more recent)?
 If I must I can postpone using Scala 3 to a later project. It is more vital that this use Akka than that it use Scala 3.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone, I've been working through Types and Programming Languages by Pierce lately and really enjoying it. Throughout the book you work through the theory and implementation of the lambda calculus, the simply typed lambda calculus and it's variants (including System F). However as far as the implementation of these languages go you only go as far as implementing type checkers and parsers to form ASTs in OCaml (translating the code in the book to Haskell is fairly easy). 
 I'm interested in learning more about how functional languages like Haskell are compiled to something lower level in the real world, different techniques used for memory and speed optimisations often talked about on this subreddit, how to "desugar" syntax into it's core IR language (like system F) prior to compiling it to something lower level.. all that jazz.. I've considered picking up a book/course on compilers however a lot of them have an inclination towards compiling imperative and OO languages which I have no interest in doing. I came across this http://dev.stephendiehl.com/fun/ which seems to match up to exactly what I'm looking for. However I can see it's been discontinued or the author has other priorities at the moment.
 Is there an alternative to Write You a Haskell? Or something that can at least serve as a complement to TAPL? I'm interested in learning more about LLVM if that option is available since it's interesting to me that some modern languages like Rust are compiled to/with LLVM.
 I'm aware of this https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/the-implementation-of-functional-programming-languages/ however fear it may be outdated. Correct me if I'm wrong.
 Cheers

 I'm asking the impossible:
 Does anyone have any Emacs configs that would make Emacs so easy to use, that normal people like my partner would be able to utilize it for their daily TODO lists?
 I'm talking GUI friendly options, sane normal people keyboard shortcut choices, and even the ability to totally ignore normal Emacs regular keybindings.
 I ask because I was showing off what Org Mode could do, but was told that it looked too complicated to use.
 Does anyone have any links to some super-easy-to-use user-friendly Emacs configs that would be mouse and GUI based? (I know, its sacrilege but hey, gotta try somehow).
 I know Emacs without a config has the context menu which is fine, but yeah, looking for some tips in this department. This person was debating using it for TODO lists for work, and also maybe for writing scripts for TV shows, etc.
 Thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm playing around with readability when reading large blocks of text in emacs, and sometimes the lines kind of blur together for me when I'm reading. I think coloring each sentence a different color would help me keep track of my place without needing to actively highlight each line. As far as I can tell, the only way to do this is with some implementation of faces. However, it looks like each face is assigned to a single color, so I would have to figure out how to switch to a different face for each sentence in a paragraph. The fact that I'm doing all of this within org-mode kinda complicates things too, since I only want this to apply to paragraphs, not other elements.
 Has anyone else attempted to do anything similar to this? Is there a better way to approach this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey, I started today to create my emacs config. I'm following the Emacs from scratch series from System Crafters in youtube. 
 I want to have the same mappings I have on Neovim. I'm using general.el and my leader key is the spacebar. And I want to map spacebar to do fuzzy search, so by just pressing double spacebar I'm searching for a file (similar to doom-emacs amd what I have on my neovim config). 
 Can't figure what is the syntax for mapping the spacebar. For setting the leader key, using SPC worked, but doesn't work for mapping spacebar after the prefix. 
 Here's how I have defined my leader key.
 (use-package general :config (general-evil-setup t) (general-create-definer rune/leader-keys :global-prefix "SPC")) 
 And here are the mappings I have:
 (rune/leader-keys 'normal "b" '(:ignore b :which-key "buffers") "bb" '(counsel-switch-buffer :which-key "all buffers") "bs" '(save-buffer :which-key "save buffer") "bq" '(kill-current-buffer :which-key "quit buffer") "/" '(swiper :which-key "search in buffer")) 
 What I have tried:
 "SPC" '(counsel-fzf :which-key "search file") "<space>" '(counsel-fzf :which-key "search file") 
 That last one I tried:
 (kbd "SPC") '(counsel-fzf :which-key "search file") 
 Those don't work, can anyone point me in the right direction ? Thanks.

The outcome would be similar in spirit to that of the existing OverloadedStrings GHC extension, however, the latter I believe "only" infers the type (Data.String.IsString a) => a for a string literal l during type checking and then desugars them to fromString l, where fromString :: (Data.String.IsString a) => String -> a is from the typeclass Data.String.IsString.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Greetings Emacslings,
 I've been trying to get company-mode to only trigger completion on tab. This is my set up, which does pretty much what I want:
 ```lisp (use-package company :defer t :diminish "" :hook ((prog-mode) . (lambda () (company-mode))) :config (setq tab-always-indent 'complete) (setq company-idle-delay nil) (setq company-minimum-prefix-length 3) :bind (:map company-mode-map ("<tab>" . 'company-indent-or-complete-common) :map company-active-map ("C-n" . 'company-select-next-or-abort) ("C-j" . 'company-select-next-or-abort) ("C-p" . 'company-select-previous-or-abort) ("C-k" . 'company-select-previous-or-abort)))
 (use-package company-prescient :defer t :hook (company-mode . company-prescient-mode)) ```
 The only problem now is that yasnippets are borked up: tab triggers company, which doesn't test to see if it can expand as yasnippet first. Is there any way for me to get this working how I'd like?
 Edit: better minimal example

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm curious if there's a way to convert a tuple into a "type map".
 Example:
  val t: (Int, (String, Double)) = (3, ("Pi", 3.14)) val m = toTypeMap(t) val i: Int = m.get[Int] // returns 3 val s: String = m.get[String] // returns "Pi" val d: Double = m.get[Double] // returns 3.14 
 toTypeMap(t) should only compile if t contains no duplicate types, i.e. wouldn't compile for an (Int, Int). Calling get[T] should only compile if the tuple contains the type T. 
 Perhaps "type map" is not the canonical name for this. What I'm thinking of is something like ZIO's Env, basically a Map that lets you retrieve elements based on the type of the element.
 edit: the tuple doesn't necessarily have to be "nested"

 I've been using Emacs for a long time but my needs are not that fancy so my understanding of it is not that great. I'm mostly using it to edit DNS (bind) and configuration files. 
 I have for a long time had this peculiar thing come up. In most of my dns zone files the TAB key acts as I want, ie when you press TAB the cursor moves 8 characters to the right, (from position 1) when you move the marker with arrow left it jumps back to position 1, and if you press TAB again it jumps 8 characters to the right again.
 But in some files when I press TAB the marker moves to something like position 16. Now when you press arrow left the marker goes to the left as if the space is filled with spaces. If you try to press TAB again nothing happens.
 I've been trying to read the documentation on how to program the TAB key but I haven't been able to solve the problem.

This is for python with lsp-pyright. I'm also wondering if the special org src buffer has a hook on closing or something. I want to run my python black command when I close the src buffer.

It would be useful because it would be possible to move the cursor exactly in the position of a specific character using a evil-mode shortcut, pressing a number and h/l to move right or left a specific number of times. I have yet the distance from current line for every line, using linum, but i think that even this feature would be useful.

 I don't mind some code which can change the configuration on the fly, perhaps I can use Cw for cases when I want to see dashes as regular letters of a word and use cw for the standard usage.

I’m not a coder or programmer. I write and edit legal documents for a living. I have installed a dark theme and some add-ons.
 I’ve started using it for its text editing capabilities, but I am impressed with its extensible features as well. It has now become my go-to for most html browsing and I also browse Gemini capsules and Gopher holes with it. I really like the file manager, built-in terminal (I use a lot of tui apps out of preference), multimedia and internet radio support, org-mode which I am using to write unit meeting agendas, as well as the built in games.
 I’m looking for suggestions for additional extensions that work with my use case as I would like to use Emacs for the majority of my workflow rather than rely on multiple tui and GUI applications. Additional game recommendations would be welcome as well.
 Emacs seems like an another OS within my OS (I use Fedora at home and when I telework).
 Initially I thought that Emacs would be “too hard and complicated” but I have enjoyed the tutorial and documentation. I feel like I am just scratching the surface.

 This is my second Haskell library. It is a low-level library that creates a logical replication slot and streams changes to your program from your PostgreSQL server.
 It's still experimental and ready for library authors and interested hackers to kick the tires and build real-time applications with it.
 Future plans include: - handling user-defined types - libraries based on conduit and other popular streaming packages
 Thanks for taking a look. And thanks to this community. I built this library from scratch on my stream and am grateful for those who've been watching and cheering me on. This is a library I've wanted for a while and I hope you enjoy it too!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I never used EXWM, but if I'm not wrong it allows you to switch between different workspaces, where each workspace has its own frame configuration. For instance, I can do a vertical split in workspace 1, than move to workspace 2 which will be a new empty frame, not vertically splitted. Then, if I want I can move back to workspace 1 and find again the vertical split and the buffers opened in that workspace. I didn't manage to find anything similar to this for regular Emacs, every time I want to open a new empty frame without changing the configuration of the frame I'm currently using, I need to open a new Emacs X window, while I would like to do everything in the same Emacs window. Why you don't just use EXWM, you might ask. Because for now I'm quite skeptical about its usefulness for me, so I want to take my time to understand if it's something that might actually improve my workflow. In the meanwhile, I would really love a feature like the one described above. I started only very recently to use Emacs so sorry if the feature I'm looking for is something obvious or basic. Any suggestion is greatly appreciated!

 I've been playing around with emacs for a few days, mainly with org-mode, and I really like it and the idea of it. But, I've barely scratched the surface. I thought a way for me to get into using emacs would be learning a new language, and looked into C++. I found this great guide for using C++ with emacs, but frankly I'm a bit intimidated by how many extensions and how much configuration are required. It makes me want to just use a more standard IDE.
 I guess I have two questions for more experienced users: 1. Am I looking at this the wrong way? Is coding with emacs at odds with using an IDE, and I should be looking at a different work flow entirely, rather than forcing emacs to have ide like features? 2. What sort of stands out for folks as the reason it was worth climbing up the emacs learning curve?

I'm under the impression that it's supposed to just work, and I have a hook set up for c++ mode, but the result is lsp[disconnected] and no actual attempt to connect to clangd. Is there something else I need to do? clangd is on my path so it should be easy to find.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As the title indicates, I'm having a bit of trouble finding the source files for the Elisp functions. Specifically, when I'm attempting to call
 M-x xref-find-definitions 
 in any buffer of any major mode. For example, running that function on 
 xref-find-definitions 
 in the info buffer causes emacs to return with
 Find definitions of (default xref-find-definitions): 
 so we hit <RET> and are shown 
 Visit tags table (default TAGS): /Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/Resources/info 
 hit that <RET> again and we get 
 File /Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/Resources/info/TAGS does not exist 
 (note that running 
 xref-etags-mode 
 doesn't change anything)
 now I'm aware this has to do something with the 'etags' shell command, but this only creates a tags table in a specific working directory. How would I configure so that I have a global tags table so that anywhere I could run 
 xref-find-definitions 
 and go take a look at the course code of a function?
 Thanks

The instructions at https://github.com/oantolin/orderless/issues/31#issuecomment-763908249 are thorough but don’t seem to override my usual behavior of allowing for orderless-initialism matches, and unlike the code suggested there, I do not want any matches to be made if a regexp search fails (much like how Swiper works.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey Emacs lovers, I've updated the top-up for the Inside Emacs videos by adding the files and commands used in the last 3 videos on org-table I uploaded recently.
 This top-up is for you if you like the videos and:
  
you want the list of the commands used in the videos,
 or you want to practice your Emacs workflow by reproducing some of the actions in the videos with the files I've used.
  
For instance, if you're interested on trying the commands related to exporting tables in org-mode we discussed in Inside Emacs #6 (part 6), you can:
  
find the commands in this section of the README,
 and try them with the org file org-table.org.
  
I hope this top-up can help you reduce the time between the moment you watched the video and the moment you're able to do what's in the video and much more.
 If there something missing in the top-up or you think of another way of presenting it, let me know.
 Have a nice day :)

 This works nicely in a browser but not in the native emacs SVG viewer. I tried this in emacs 27 that comes with ubuntu 21.04 and in a freshly compiled version from https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs.git using the master branch.
 Any ideas on if this is possible and/or how to get this to work ?

 So I'm in an org-table and I give it a simple addition like (+ 8 $4) But it seems to be multiplying (8 * the_number_in_column4) rather than the correct behavior of (8 + the_number_in_column4). 
 I'm sure it's a mistake on my part and not emacs, but I'm very interested to see where I went wrong.

 def myscope(byNameParam : => Unit) : Unit = println("BEGIN") byNameParam println("END") 
 I cannot use
 myscope println("test") 
 but instead still have to use
 myscope { println("test") } 
 This is slightly annoying. Will this restriction be lifted at some point?

 I'd been searching for a while for a way to do this but couldn't find it, so yesterday I sat down and coded my own. With this function and binding, when I hit Return on a file in Dired it either opens the file asynchronously in an external command if the file format-command combo is defined in dired-guess-shell-alist-user etc., or opens the file in Emacs as usual if the format is not bound to a command.
 (defun dired-find-file-or-do-async-shell-command () "If there is a default command defined for this file type, run it asynchronously.If not, open it in Emacs." (interactive) (let ( ;; get the default for the file type, ;; putting the string into a list because dired-guess-default throws an error otherwise. (default (dired-guess-default (cons (dired-get-filename) '()))) ;; put the file name into a list so dired-shell-stuff-it will accept it (file-list (cons (dired-get-filename) '()))) (if (null default) ;; if no default found for file, open in Emacs (dired-find-file) ;; if default is found for file, run command asynchronously (dired-run-shell-command (dired-shell-stuff-it (concat default " &") file-list nil))))) ;; This function is bound to the Return key in dired-mode to replace the default behavior on Return (define-key dired-mode-map (kbd "<return>") #'dired-find-file-or-do-async-shell-command) ;; For added convenience: Don't open a new Async Shell Command window (add-to-list 'display-buffer-alist(cons "\\*Async Shell Command\\*.*" (cons #'display-buffer-no-window nil))) ;; Always open a new buffer if default is occupied. (setq async-shell-command-buffer 'new-buffer) 
 These modification more or less "complete" Dired for me as a file manager for everyday use without annoyance or cognitive load. The shell command and async shell command functions and keys remain available for more involved stuff like multiple files, but for 95% of my uses this is sufficient.

 I'm trying to "grok emacs". I've heard high praises, the enlightenment, what not. I have not found it yet. Over the years:
  
Done emacs tutorials multiple times (forget most key bindings).
 Did org-mode tutorial once and created a huge org-mode daily-notes file. Abandoned it.

I was wondering how to fix it.
Should I divide literature and permanent notes?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I understand the emacs way to do this is to download a package for each file type/mode and use the indent functions specific to that mode, but not every package has an "un-indent" or "shift left" function. In these cases, they seem to expect you to manually delete white space in front of the line to un-indent. Also, working all of these different indent functions into my existing keybinds is annoying.
 I have a package (github) that detects the indentation offset and updates the tab-width variable in emacs. Does anyone have a package/function that can use this variable to indent/dedent single or multiple lines?

 I received the following notice because I was subscribed to the 'Intermediate Haskell' newsletter, but thought it might be worthwhile to know for other people on Reddit as well:
  
Hey! 
 You are receiving this email because you have subscribed to updates about the 'Intermediate Haskell' book. 
 The book is cancelled. Vlad and Artyom and all other contributors have switched to other things. 
 [...] 
 Anything that we write will likely be announced on Twitter: https://intermediatehaskell.us15.list-manage.com/track/click?u=67b31bfe9303116749c079389&id=25c6c78b9d&e=3e3ab466bb is Vlad's, and https://intermediatehaskell.us15.list-manage.com/track/click?u=67b31bfe9303116749c079389&id=97065ee399&e=3e3ab466bb is Artyom's. 
 Bye!
  
Writing a book is a very large and difficult ordeal, so it is not strange for a book to be cancelled and I wish the authors the best <3.
 Hopefully some other work(s) will fill the gap between 'beginner' and 'expert' material of Haskell in the (near?) future.

 Here is my next iteration on basic WYSIWYG printing in GNU Emacs for Images. Now you can print Emacs Welcome screen in all its glory.
 Cavaet: Since PS only supports JPG and bitmaps for images, SVG and PNG with transparency will require manual conversion for desirable output.

 I have tried using Gtk, wxHaskell, and Fltkhs, and all of them fail during compilation now. They clearly worked in the past, but apparently are not being maintained anymore.
 Now, at this point, I am prepared to fork one of them and bring it current for LTS 18.0 (and beyond), but I would rather not have to do that, as I want to just write the application, but will if I have to.
 Can anyone please point me to a GUI framework that compiles and links flawlessly with LTS 18.0 without a fuss? And why is there so little maintenance on these GUI frameworks to begin with?
 I will also be making use of FRP in this project, and many others to come, but they so far don't seem to suffer from the same problems, for the most part.
 I would also prefer not to have to rely on Qt, as I did for a prior (non-Haskell) project, and they yanked the part I was heavily reliant on out of Open Source, the bloody bastards! :)
 Any suggestions at this point would be extremely helpful.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 Does anyone have minimum example to rendering string or font using GLFW-b in Haskell OpenGL ?
 Currently, I use GLUT to render string inside My Haskell OpenGL binding project.
  import qualified Graphics.UI.GLUT as GLUT GLUT.renderString GLUT.Roman "Hello World" 
 ​
 ​
 here is the code to render "Hello World"
  preservingMatrix $ do translate (Vector3 (u/2.0) 0 0 :: Vector3 GLdouble) GL.scale (1/scaleFont :: GL.GLdouble) (1/scaleFont) 1 GL.blend $= GL.Disabled preservingMatrix $ GLUT.renderString GLUT.Roman "Hello World" GL.blend $= GL.Enabled 
 ​
 ​
 Here is my Stack dependencies 
 ​
 stack ls dependencies
 GLFW-b 3.2.1.0 OpenGL 3.0.3.0 OpenGLRaw 3.3.3.0 GLUT 2.7.0.15 
 ​
 But the text is very bad and weird and hard to recognize the word.
 What I have tried so far.
 Disabled Blend when rendering the string but the result is not much different.
 Disabled Lighting when rendering the string but the result is not much different.
 ​
 Here is the image you can see how bad the font is using GLUT or I did something wrong.
 Can you recognize "Hello World"?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've gone round and round with this issue, i.e., how to add a non-Prelude package. I like to work with org-mode babel for Haskell, i.e., without a specific project directory, just babel source blocks interacting with a non-project REPL. My Emacs non-project Haskell stuff works, I'm guessing, because it's relies on my ~/.stack/global-project. But let's leave that aside for now.
 So let's say I'm just trying to get a plain-vanilla project to work with an outside package. So I create a new project with stack new basicmath And let's say I'm trying to get Diagrams to work just like they give with the example code here, i.e., "Your First Diagram." I'm trying all the install instructions at the command prompt in .../basicmath/, none work. I'm guessing something needs to happen with the basicmath.cabal or the stack.yaml? But I look in vain for any concrete examples. Confusing to me also is whether to actually use cabal when I'm supposed to be using stack. In any case, nothing works. How exactly would I make the example code work?
 I'd eventually like to see this work on the Emacs babel side, but I won't get greedy yet. Emacs babel is just a wrapper apparently for feeding multiple lines into a non-project global REPL, i.e., fraught.
 A really good tutorial on this would be nice to find, BTW. Most of what I've seen is just someone's stream-of-consciousness hypnosis ramblings, i.e., leaving a beginner to do guess-and-test over and over. And beginner books don't talk about it either; rather, you simply put code in a file and load it at the REPL as you work through these books. (I did find one book that walks you through a project creation. But it has no example of adding a non-Prelude package.) Would another IDE handle adding packages better? What about VS Code?

 https://github.com/overdr0ne/gumshoe
 What is it?
 Gumshoe quietly keeps tabs on your movements so you can retrace your steps if you ever need a reminder. It does not keep track of every move you make, rather, only when you exceed some minimum Euclidean distance from the last tracked position, like a leash, or when you idle in one place for a while. It is a lot like the global-mark-ring, but expanded, and a lot like Evil's jump list, but works more generically.
 Why?
 Basically, I tend to get lost when searching around large code bases(yes, lsp and tags help a lot too), or when I’m getting lots of interruptions, or when I just sorta space out... Specifically, I made this as a replacement for Vim’s jump list which, in Evil’s implementation at least, logs only for certain evil commands-- not at all general, and just doesn’t work when you’re not using evil for movement. I found a few other movement tracking packages, and the global-mark-ring, but they were either too manual, or had bad granularity of tracking, so I made this and thought I'd share.
 Does anyone do anything similar? Comments and suggestions welcome!

 I ventured into the world of scala a couple of years ago when I went in search for a better faster programming language and fell in love with functional programming. Now I work quite a lot in Scala.

 I ran into ScalaPy but this does the opposite ie. It enables calling python routines from scala. I am looking for the opposite.
 I figured ScalaNative would perhaps enable this since this does not depend on JVM. Futhermore, I guess it is also faster then Scala. Can any one point me in the right direction?

 [[ 1.1, -4.2 ], [ 3.14, -2.718 ]], [[ 7, 8 ], [ -10, 33 ]], 
 Suppose, for example that I'd like to multiply each number by 777. What is the simplest way to achieve this?
 By simplest way, I mean writing no (or very little amount of) lisp code. Maybe there is an already existing package which solves the same (or similar) problem.
 One way I see is to convert this into an org table, and use org's table capabilities to apply the math formula. But then I lose the format of the original buffer (I mean []'s, etc.). Losing the format is not a huge problem, but it would be better if the formatting was retained.

All I know is by using the companion object with we can access the private methods and variables of companion object and can access in class/trait/case class . I want to organize my code based on the features provided by them but not sure how. For example, I am writing all my utility methods in object and service method in classes which is fine but end up writing too many functions in object(for utilities). From the real time application development perspective how can we take advantage of the features of companion object, case class, class and trait to organize the code.
 And is there additional features/ difference for the companion object across those three

 I came up with this code (feedback welcomed!) that I added to the :config section of my (use-package emacs...) block:
 (defvar hoagie-container-name nil "Stores the name of the current container, if present.") (when (file-exists-p "/run/.containerenv") ;; from http://ergoemacs.org/emacs/elisp_read_file_content.html ;; insert content in temp buffer rather than open a file (with-temp-buffer (insert-file-contents "/run/.containerenv") (search-forward "name=") ;; move point to the line with the name (setq hoagie-container-name (cl-subseq (thing-at-point 'line) 6 -2)))) ;; Identify the toolbox container for this Emacs instance in the frame title (setq frame-title-format '(" %b @ " (:eval hoagie-container-name)) icon-title-format '(" %b @ " (:eval hoagie-container-name)))) 
 I removed from my frame parameters (undecorated . t) for this. It could go in the modeline too, probably in misc-info: (push '(:eval hoagie-container-name) mode-line-misc-info).

 An example of this kind-of setup is Stephen Wolfram's, detailed here: https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2019/02/seeking-the-productive-life-some-details-of-my-personal-infrastructure/
 Or more generally: https://quantifiedself.com/
 I want to start tracking little aspects of myself in an open format, ideally co-located with my other notes. It's fairly important that I can query the data I'm storing so that I can look for interesting bits of data or trends.
 A MVP of this might be a random prompt for a handful of questions: * How do you feel right now? 0-3 * How energetic do you feel right now? 0-3
 How might y'all implement something like this? Appending answers to a table using org-capture templates perhaps? Any tips or tricks? Have you implemented anything that rhymes with my thinking here?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 Major noob here looking for some pointers on their first project. The aim of the project is to pull data down from multiple entity's public REST APIs (let's call them cryptocurrency exchanges). For each entity, I have to make numerous individual API calls without breaching that entity's API rate limit. The aim is to execute the API pulls from each of these entities in parallel/concurrently in order to save time. I have everything working now using parallel collections, but this is non-optimal because 1. CPU is underutilized on each thread because the bulk of the time is spent waiting between API calls and 2. more entities in parallel mean more cores.
 Could someone advise me on the best way to tackle this with a concurrency based approach? 
 If possible, I would also like to keep the project structure close to what I have now. Each entity is represented by an object that extends a trait called Entity. The trait contains a method called getData that executes all the HTTP requests that are needed for that specific entity, waiting a specific amount of time between calls to avoid breaching the entity's rate limit. Each implementation overrides an apiLimit value as well as other functions for handling the specific entities HTTP responses.
 Thanks in advance!

 I have the following line:
 notmuch-fcc-dirs '((".*" . "sent -unread"))
 To save my mail in sent and remove the unread tag. However when I send an email it asks me if I want to create the directory and it creates 'sent -unread'. As opposed to creating 'sent' and removing the tag unread. notmuch-maildir-use-notmuch-insert is set to t.
 If I remove the -unread it works fine. Is my syntax wrong?

Scala 2's somewhat puzzling behavior with respect to ambiguity has been exploited to implement the analogue of a "negated" search in implicit resolution, where a query Q1 fails if some other query Q2 succeeds and Q1 succeeds if Q2 fails. With the new cleaned up behavior these techniques no longer work. But there is now a new special type scala.util.NotGiven which implements negation directly. For any query type Q, NotGiven[Q] succeeds if and only if the implicit search for Q fails.

I have a couple of questions, however;
I don't want to start with a digital zettelkasten, so I've started the process of acquiring a novelink box and index cards from Amazon. But info online is considerably vague. I know I'm to use my fleeting notes for quick ideas or notes as they come, then my literature note is for learning purposes before transferring to my permanent note, then finally transfer singular ideas into my zettels. My question is how do I use this while reading a book or taking an online course? What do I need to transfer between these notes? How do I know I'm taking the ideal note? Do I look at it from the context of why I'm studying the note/book/course, or I'm to maintain an open mind?
Also, I don't know if there are copywriters in this group, but how can I use this method to boost my research ability? How do you use your zettelkasten system to research?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Introduction
 When I saw opaque types and inline methods, I quickly thook about type-level assertions evaluated at compile time. I was pretty hyped by this idea so I made Iron.
 Iron uses Dotty's inline and opaque types to create almost zero-overhead (and true zero-overhead for the next Scala 3 release) type constraints for Scala. It also supports runtime constraints.
 Actually, Iron is almost full-vanilla (By vanilla I mean "without macro/black magic"). Inline methods, implicit conversions and opaque types are powerful enough to use them for 90% of the library. Thank you Dotty.
 Usage
 Passing a value A to a parameter/variable/return requiring a Constrained[A, B] will (using a given method) implicitly get a Constraint[A, B] (alias: ==>[A, B]) and use Constraint#assert. If the result is false, a compile time error is thrown.
 Example: ```scala import io.github.iltotore.iron., constraint., numeric.constraint.*
 inline def log(x: Double ==> Greater[0d]): Double = Math.log(x) ```
 Using to type aliases, we can sugar even more our constraint: ```

 Well I am a new user to emacs, I use a lot of text editing, mainly VSCODE and mainly with git. 
 I am currently facing an issue with Magit and I wanna ask you if you can point me out to a solution as I already did some research but found nothing.
 So, I have a repo cloned using HTTPS protocol. I can push new branches to origin normally using the command "git push origin [branch-name]".
 Now when I try to push my branch using magit, (P u - type the upstream branch name - [RET]) I am getting:
 (fatal: Could not read from remote repository.
 Please make sure you have the correct access rights
 and the repository exists.)
 I found some people having issues like this one but when using SSH protocol for their repos, but in my case as, I said, I am using HTTPS protocol and it works normally using terminal.
 If you can point me out to a solution for this issue I would appreciate it :)
 the log shows me this...
 git … push -v --set-upstream [my-branch]\:refs/heads/
 Thank you in advance!

 Working in Windows emacs 27.2
 I would love to use the functionality of radio targets in my org file. If you dont know it see: https://orgmode.org/manual/Radio-Targets.html
 Therefore I have heading * dictionary <<<mydefinition>>> bla blub * my org text Text mydefinition is then highlighted as link.
 Now the problem
 When I klick the link on mydefinition. I would expect it to jump to the position of <<<mydefinition>>> 
 Instead emacs pops a file dialog and asks for "Visit TAGS table"
 Generating TAGS files seems rocket science to me and Documentation is really scattered and not consistent at all for this. For windows even worse. Does anybody use this? Is it outdated functionality or could it be configured to just work out of the box? Does it work on linux without special installations?
 Thanks

But also the directory elements have squiggly lines under them (whether or not the file name does). Sometimes they go away, but I'm not sure what I do that makes them go away. What do the squiggly lines under the directory elements mean and how to make them go away? Thanks

I came across auto-complete and company-mode, but most of the discussions I found about them (even on this subreddit) were very old. There were discussions about company-mode being easier, but not supporting docstrings.
 I just want to know as of 2021, how good they are, what about speed? memory? do they work in terminals? how easy are they? does company-mode now support docstrings? Any feedback would be really appreciated.

 object FormatCurrency { private lazy val instance = NumberFormat.getCurrencyInstance def apply(num: BigDecimal): String = instance.format(num) } 
 so I can call it like FormatCurrency(1.00).
 What do y'all think? Should it be formatCurrency to make it look more like a function and less like a class constructor?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi!
 My assumption is that Haskell has no support for a scenario where a client ought to be authenticated (certificate send and verified) as part of establishing a TLS connection. OnCertificateRequest function does not seem to be called back.
 We see a lot of code examples such as this one:
  creds <- either error Just `fmap` credentialLoadX509 crtFile keyFile let hooks = def { onCertificateRequest = \_ -> return creds , onServerCertificate = \_ _ _ _ -> return [] } clientParams = (defaultParamsClient hostName "") { clientHooks = hooks , clientSupported = def { supportedCiphers = ciphersuite_all } } tlsSettings = TLSSettings clientParams 
 For Windows 10 and ghc 8.4.3 has someone gotten onCertificateRequest called back?

At one stage of writing a 300-page book I had 1000 sheets of paper, each with a mathematical statement on it, a theorem, a lemma, or even a minor comment, complete with proof. The sheets were numbered, any which way. My job was to indicate on each sheet the numbers of the sheets whose statement must logically come before, and then to arrange the sheets in linear order so that no sheet comes after one on which it's mentioned.


Emphasis mine.
It is of course not quite a Zettelkasten, since the numbers are only used to describe predecessors, but I think it is still interesting to look at these examples of almost-Zettelkasten. I think it gives credibility to the Zettelkasten technique that it is not really something entirely new, but that the elements can be recognized elsewhere.]]></summary>

 It seems to me the error is from the org-clock-remove-empty-clock-drawer function within the org-clock-out-hook. 
 And removing the function from the hook does fix the issue immediately. 
 It seems the hook is being executed when the current buffer is the Org Note buffer instead of the org buffer. 
 is anyone else getting this? 
 I was able to reproduce the issue with these steps: 
  
Download https://orgmode.org/org-9.4.6.tar.gz and extract to ~/org-9.4.6
 
Start emacs 27 with emacs -Q 
 evaluate (add-to-list 'load-path "~/org-9.4.6/lisp")
 create a new org file, create a heading and clock in 
 evaluate (setq org-log-note-clock-out t) 
 clock out. 
  
I'm using WSL2/Ubuntu 20.04 on Windows. this shouldn't be relevant though.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently, I found out about haskell and got intrigued to find more about it. I was also fascinated with Xmonad so I been tweaking in it. But I'm having a bit hard time to understand the codes of different modules so I thought it would be best to know the basics of the language as such would help me to understand the codes as well as make me more able. Can you all suggest me books that I can refer to as a novice in this field? 
 I know this question has been asked quite a few times but it all dated atleast 5 years ago or so. It's 2021 and many things have changed so I'm looking for any book which is totally updated and beginners friendly. Please consider myself as total novice in the programming world as I had very little exposure to programming. I know a bit of C and Bash and I used it mainly to make my life easier on Linux by building small scripts. Any sort of help is totally appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I'm coming back to my haskell project after some months and hitting the good ol' "wow this is a giant mess, I should totally revamp this".
 I'm realising basically everything I write is of the type foo :: a -> b -> m c for some huge m ~ ReaderT BigOlRecordType1 (StateT BigOlRecordType2 IO).
 This seems like...a huge oversight. For reference, the thing I'm working on is a text adventure, so the big abstraction I have is a game world populated by objects. If I want to go query some property of some object, I have to lug around this huge monad stack. It doesn't feel very haskell-y. Rather than handling propertyCheck :: SomeSpecificObject -> Bool, I'm doing things like HasSomeSpecificObject w m => EntityID -> m Bool.
 Am I missing something here? It'd be great if I could deal with little fu…]]></summary>

As such, I want to enable this for every org file in the org roam directory but only in that directory. I found here that this can be done with 
 ((org-mode . ((eval . (org-hugo-auto-export-mode)))))
 added to the directory's .dir-locals.el
 After trying this, it simply didn't work for me. I have tried restarting as well and with this code snippet, the mode simply doesnt get activated. My problem is this is the first time I have worked with directory local variables/modes and I can't find another way to do this online. 
 Anyone have a clue why this isn't working. I would love if I could properly do this. 
 Thanks in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello! I just started using Emacs and have a noob question:
 How to configure Emacs to automatically close brackets like in VS code or other text editors?
 I switched from Vim to the latest version of Doom Emacs and didn't like the behavior of auto-closing brackets. Specifically, I don't like two things:
 - Auto erasing closing bracket('|' -> cursor):
 ```c++ int main() { {| } ``` becomes: ```c++ int main() { | ``` 
  
No new line with indentation after pressing Shift+Enter:
 c++ int main() { { |} } 
 Just Enter:
 c++ int main() { { | } } 
 
 I tried several solutions from the internet, but neither of them worked as I wanted(I also tried hacking on them, but it was really hard because I am a noob in Elisp and Emacs). My requirements are not that high, though: - Add a closing bracket - Add new line and indent after I press Enter (and Shift+Enter) - Don't remove the closing bracket when I erase the opening one (I usually start erasing from the closing bracket and when I reach opening one, it removes the next closing bracket)
 In vim, I used simple bindings:
 ``` " brackets
 inoremap " ""<left> inoremap ' ''<left> inoremap ( ()<left> inoremap [ []<left> inoremap { {}<left> inoremap {<CR> {<CR>}<ESC>O inoremap {;<CR> {<CR>};<ESC>O 
 ```
 I tried to implement it in Emacs but couldn't. Will appreciate some help.
 Is there a good way for auto closing brackets in Emacs?
 EDIT: I think electric pair suits me. As for me, smartparens' behavior is really annoying: it deletes closing pair and acts strange. I figured out how to turn off it in Doom Emacs: lisp (remove-hook 'doom-first-buffer-hook #'smartparens-global-mode) (smartparens-global-mode -1) 
 One thing left: I want auto indentation after pressing Shift+Enter too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been trying to set up for python development. Everything is working fine so far, only flycheck is giving me some headaches. I'm using lsp, so flycheck defaults to using lsp as it's checker. But I want to use flake8 as the default checker, which depends on the virtual environment to be loaded before. The environment is automatically loaded using direnv. I tried this to select flake8 as default:
 (add-hook 'pyhon-mode-local-vars-hook (lambda () (when (flycheck-may-enable-checker 'python-flake8) (flycheck-select-checker 'python-flake8)))) 
 However it doesn't select the checker and I have to do it manually (M-x flycheck-select-checker). I also tried disabling the lsp checker completely and to always select flake8 (without checking if it can be enabled) but it still doesn't work. I guess what causes a problem is that flake8 cannot be selected until the environment is loaded, since the executable is in the virtual environment. Is there any way I could still make it load flake8 automatically?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Background: With projectile, I usually use projectile-grep or projectile-ag to search for stuff in my code bases or blogs. Thanks to wgrep etc., I can then edit the results in place and perform changes to my project next to any occurrence of the search terms.
 Observation: I noticed that with Emacs's new-ish built-in project.el stuff, there's C-x p g to perform a regex search (project-find-regexp) without grep in a project. The resulting buffer is using xref-mode. It looks rather nice and tidy. But there's no built-in wgrep equivalent to make it editable.
 Question: Is there a wgrep, but for xref-mode? Web search yields confusing results because 'xref' hashistorically been the name of a couple of things in Emacs land. Help by ye all would be appreciated!

 I have a codebase that's quite old now that uses akka http with Futures as a main IO monad and throwing exceptions for error handling.
 I would like to improve on this and have been looking into other options like using Monad Error. However I am wondering how I can handle this because it seems to me in akka http youre obliged to create an exception handler. Also, I am not sure Monad Error will be compatible with the monad used by the app (Future) 
 Any suggestions or code samples i can get inspiration from?

inherently evil, or just misunderstood? Is global coherence a mistake or a
fundamental requirement? In this post we argue that most of the arguments over
these questions stem from the fact that type classes embody a number of
disparate concepts, with each facet giving rise to perceived wisdom which does
not necessarily map to other facets. We look at the various concepts which are
combined in type classes, and posit how one might disentangle them.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been working to understand the theory behind algebraic effects, with the understanding that that's what Polysemy's based on. I'm starting to think I'm fundamentally confused. 
 Following through citations (Polysemy cites Kiselyov and Ishii, who cite Kammar, Lindley, and Oury, who cite various papers by Plotkin and Pretnar) strongly suggests that "extensible effects" are just a rebranding of "algebraic effects", and that equational reasoning gets left out of implementations because that's more practical (but Polysemy's trying to add it back?). Is this a good understanding of the situation?
 Similarly, in Petnar's representations of algebraic effects (e.g.), it's quite important that the handlers have access to the computation's continuation, and get to decide how it's used. I haven't been able to find any support for this in Polysemey, but everything's phrased so differently it's difficult to search. 
 Any suggestions for bridging the gap between theory and practice, or for quickly getting up to speed on the last twenty years of research in this area?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new release of fakedata has been released: https://github.com/fakedata-haskell/fakedata
 Brief Summary of what fakedata is: It's a library for producing fake data such as names, addresses and phone numbers.
 The changelog contains the list of changes in this release: https://github.com/fakedata-haskell/fakedata/releases/tag/v1.0
 Note that this release contains breaking change. I have documented it with more detail in the changelog entry. The most interesting one is making Fake type as a transformer which allows writing efficient code more easily. This was done by Isaac Van Bakel and more details are here: https://github.com/fakedata-haskell/fakedata#using-the-faket-transformer
 The current release also adds various new modules (+ 15), locale improvements and contains updates to fake data sources. Also, the test suite has been enhanced which helped me find bugs in the upstream Ruby data sources (Corresponding fix: https://github.com/faker-ruby/faker/pull/2339) . And thanks to Tristan de Cacqueray for fixing the test failure issues related to random 1.2.0 as part of ZuriHac.
 The following packages can be used to create generators out of fakedata:
 * quickcheck integration by Jappie Klooster: https://github.com/fakedata-haskell/fakedata-quickcheck
 * hedgehog integration by Matt Parsons: https://github.com/parsonsmatt/hedgehog-fakedata

 I am using Doom Emacs with (org +pretty) and org-autolist installed (disabling this didn't seem to change behavior) if that is relevant.

 A previous emacs install I used would let me format (Perl) quoted text with spaces or tabs so I could write 
 my $sql = "SELECT foo, bar FROM wibble WHERE baz = 'done'"; 
 Hitting tab on those lines would not change the formatting 
 However currently if I hit tab on those lines it changes it to an ugly
 my $sql = "SELECT foo, bar FROM wibble WHERE baz = 'done'"; 
 I could use heredoc, but was wondering if there was option I needed to disable.

 I like that I can add entries quickly into my Diary note using the + widget.
 However when I go into the app, I'd like to see my entries listed by date (with the creation date on the left), instead of as a bullet list... What am I missing?
 Note that I'm not talking about scheduled tasks/events. I'd just like to do simple journal entries, and see them in a journal format.
 PS: I'm posting here because this sub seems to be the most active with Orgzly. To be honest I don't really know what orgmode is!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am working on an NBT parser for Minecraft and I wanted to test my implementation. There is an official test file, but that one is far from code coverage and I had since tried to find the best way to create my own files. These are some examples (ignore .bin files).
 I tried to use hexdump and some other GUI tool which were not very useful imo. The best luck I had was with a custom c++ code but the issue I had was that code is since broken, besides its not the best idea to rewrite source .txt and forget to update the .bin. Which led me to writing my own elisp file editor.
 A binary file would look like this:
 0a 00 00 01 00 00 11 00 ^ ^ ^ ^ | | | end of vector | | byte data | following data will be a byte vector // Those 00 00 are lengths of names of vector and byte // but i removed the names to make it fit on the line // More details in the NBT specs. 
 The above would be diplayed like this:
 0a 0000 01 0000 11 00 
 Or like this: ([%] means vector, b means byte)
 [%] "" { b "" 0x11 } 
 Or:
 [%] "" { b "" 17 } 
 So it should be at least hexadecimal, indented and separated into lines, but I would also add some readability.
 Optional: While editing the file I would like to safeguard myself and do checks on the data that I insert. Maybe even a separate buffer like in calc for stack and trail, but for insert/edit and view.

 The fast access to TODO states as mentioned in https://orgmode.org/manual/Fast-access-to-TODO-states.html#Fast-access-to-TODO-states doesn't seem to work for me anymore. When I do "SPC m t" it just tries to cycle through the available TODO states TODO->PROJ->NEXT ... and not ask for a shortcut letter to my desired state.
 I remember this stopped working after I did a fresh install of doom emacs, but this doesn't seem to be related to doom emacs. Any pointers on where to look at?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I'm a long time Vim user who switched to (DOOM)Emacs yesterday and I am looking for a way to translate all of my UltiSnips LaTeX snippets to yasnippet. So far I figured out how make basic snippets which can be expanded by pressing TAB and snippets which expand only in certain environments like the math environment but I can't figure out how to translate my more complicated snippets which expand automatically. Here is an UltiSnips example:
 snippet / "Fraction" i
 \\frac{${VISUAL}}{$1}$0
 endsnippet
 What this one does is the following: If type 1/ it will automatically expand to \frac{1}{} . Another example is the ket:
 priority 100
 context "math()"
 snippet "\|(.*?)\>" "ket" riA
 \ket{\!p[snip.rv=match.group](https://snip.rv=match.group)(1)\}\``
 endsnippet
 This gives me \ket{a} when I type |a> . I'm sure there must be a way to write snippets like these in yasnippet but I haven't found any examples of such snippets.

 After scavenging on the Internet without success results, I decided to write those myself: after-multiple-cursors-core.el
 Although a hack, the idea is simple: Just extract cursor positions from mc/all-fake-cursors's output and save it in an association list (maybe we don't need a hash table since it's not too often, and buffer-local variables are lost when we revert the buffer; and yes there's the limitation of editing will render positions incorrect, but I think we don't need to handle that case) with buffer objects as keys.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all!
 I wonder what is the right/common way to collect outputs from multiple asynchronous processes (which may run concurrently) into one log buffer. So far I have found three options:
  
Associate all the processes with the log buffer (as the process buffer). This is discouraged in the manual and indeed seems like a bad idea (it may interleave the outputs).
 
Create a unique process buffer for each process and copy the output from the process buffer to the log buffer at the end in the process sentinel. The problem is that we may have lots of buffers left. It seems to work if we kill the buffer as well in the sentinel, but I am not sure if that works reliably. Here is a sample of this solution:
 
 ```

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'd like to disable a specific behavior in *eshell* buffer, that is very much similar to the result of applying the comint-postoutput-scroll-to-bottom in inferior buffers, like M-x shell or M-x ielm (and others alike).
 For the buffers that use comint mode, I can simple remove-hook from the comint-output-filter-functions, and whenever I use C-l C-l to recenter current line to be the top one, and evaluate some expression, I like that the top line I was on is still the top line (unless the expression result is bigger than the window height).
 *eshell* always moves current line to the bottom first, then prints the result of the command, which is a bit annoying, as I mostly use it in a long vertical buffer, and going from the top to the bottom visually is very distracting. Clearing previous output is not an option, because I want to refer to it occasionally.
 But I can't seem to find anything in eshell that corresponds to this feature, and it doesn't use comint either, so any help would be great. Thanks!

Somtimes I'm having trouble doing it though, especially when the input variable needs to be fed to multiple intermediate functions, like when you'd want to find the average of an Int array:
 avg :: [Int] -> Double avg xs = fromIntegral (sum xs) / (fromIntegral (length xs)) 
 So I'm wondering if there's a way to do it at all, or if I should even bother.

 Is the system still using Static Rules? Or all static rules are gone and replaced with ML models?
  
Two friends who left Facebook at 2016 gave me contradicting information, one said it was replaced with ML written in C++, and the other said the system is still up and running. So I am asking here to see if anyone has more recent information.

 I think the functionality of MonadUnliftIO is exactly what I want, but unfortunately Snap appears not eligible for:
  
the intuition is that a monad must have no monadic state, but may have monadic context. This essentially limits MonadUnliftIO to ReaderT and IdentityT transformers on top of IO.
  
Then I found Snap has a MonadBaseControl instance, and thought it should work for me. But sadly to find it losing states. Also I failed to find a user side example of MonadBaseControl on Github (as there're only instance impl. hits), so I have not way to verify whether that's due to my incorrect usage.

 system Windows Unknown Windows_NT 10.0 x86_64 w32 emacs 27.2 HEAD deef5efaf ~/.emacs.d/ -> ~/.emacs.d/ doom 2.0.9 grafted, HEAD -> develop, origin/develop, origin/HEAD 47bce88 2021-06-06 01:19:49 -0400 ~/.doom.d/ -> ~/.doom.d/ 
 What the problem it might be?

I have beorg on my iPhone 6, and every time I start it it takes a number of seconds to sync, even if nothing has changed, and then a few more seconds to “settle down” Usually I hope to quickly add a note, and then move on, so it has some slight friction for usage. Especially when I close and reopen to add another thing — same long wait though nothing has changed. Any thoughts? My org files are not particularly large.

I've started setting up gnus, and I've got it working, though I don't want to have to manually write down my passwords in ~/.authinfo. This isn't a security issue -- I know I could encrypt it and use ~/.authinfo.gpg -- it's a convenience thing. I don't want to have to manually change the settings as well as updating my pass database every time I change my passwords (quite often).
 So, is there a way to have gnus read in my pass?
 Come to that, I used to use neomutt, which didn't need ~/.authinfo, and all other information (usernames, smtp ports, etc.) could be stored in the config. Could I do this with gnus too and get rid of one more file altogether?
 TIA!

 I often do this for work aka these two commands in an 'ansi-term' session, but have to manually type them, hit enter, and wait for connections for both separate commands:
 gcloud compute ssh --project (name of 1st box) (name of 2nd box)
 ssh (alias for end point box)
 ​
 I'm being a bit vague because yeah, its for work. 
 But, can someone please help me figure out how I can add Tramp to this combination? Also, how could I configure it to a keyboard macro as well?
 ​
 I've used Tramp to remotely edit my website as if it were local, and I absolutely love it. Wanted to do the same thing and blow some coworkers minds about how you can do this. Reason being is that I can install anything on these endpoint boxes, so I figured maybe Tramp might come to the rescue for this situation.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Greetings Emacsians! I, emacs noob, am back with additional questions. I am configuring emacs to be my personal calendar and task management system. I really like the "M-x org-agenda a"
 view's information, but I don't like its formatting.
 First and foremost, long lines look terrible. I have "word wrap visual line mode" activated, which wraps lines in all org files. I also have the "adaptive-wrap" packaged installed and active, and that makes the text wrapping in normal org mode files look much better since indenting is respected. However, this package seems to have no effect on the org agenda views. 
 Q: How can I force org agenda views to also wrap nicely such that indentation is respected? (i.e. like "adaptive-wrap" does for ordinary org mode files?)
 Separately, there are two other aspects of the org agenda view formatting I'd like to change (including them here since they are also related to org agenda view formatting even though they are otherwise separate issues).
 (1) Since the todo's are pulled from multiple files with different filename lengths, the "todo" keywords and descriptions of the todos are not aligned, and this makes the view look visually chaotic. Is there a way to tell the agenda daily/weekly view not to include the filename of each todo?
 (2) There is no extra vertical space between one todo and the next which makes it visually difficult to see where one todo ends and the next one begins. Is there a way to specify that a small amount of vertical margin beneath every todo?

For me, history is a way of connecting various pieces of evidence from the past, both diachronically (connecting similar items over time) and synchronically (connecting different items from the same time), to find patterns and to draw conclusions.  A Zettelkasten would therefore seem an ideal tool for making these connections and helping to draw the relevant conclusions.  However, the way I work doesn't seem to fit the Zettelkasten 'method' described in this forum, especially in relation to reading notes.
The first stage of my work is to collect the evidence, usually from various different primary sources.  This usually involves noting the evidence verbatim.  I may summarise it later, but I need to work from the original evidence…]]></summary>

 The configuration below sets up a DBus handler that is triggered when the Gnome GTK theme changes, and it sets the appropriate Modus theme.

 I'm trying to create a function that I can call with a key binding that will prompt me for a buffer (I'm thinking (counsel-ibuffer) style), and open the buffer as a new split next to my current buffer. Since the native emacs split functions only take dimensions as arguments (so far as I can tell) and I use evil mode, here is what I have:
  (defun other-buff-to-split () (interactive) (evil-split-buffer '(counsel-ibuffer))) 
 If you guys know of any way to get this working, please let me know. Thank you!
 EDIT: Resolved, thanks to u/flexibeast. Here is their code for people with this problem in the future:
 ``` (defun other-buff-to-split () (interactive) (ivy-read "Switch to buffer: " (counsel-ibuffer--get-buffers) :history 'counsel-ibuffer-history :action #'other-buff-to-split-1))
 (defun other-buff-to-split-1 (x) (evil-split-buffer (cdr x))) ```

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I know Emacs can automatically decrypt .gpg file when I open it in dired. However, when I open a .gpg file, the mini buffer stuck at "decrypting 0%", and doesn't prompt me for the passphase no matter how long I wait.
 If I go to the shell and manually use gpg command to decrypt a file, and I enter my passphase in the shell, the passphase is cached for a certain time. When the passphase is cached, I can now decrypt the .gpg file by opening it in dired, and this seems to be the only way that I can successfully decrypt a file automatically. It is not only annoying but stupid.
 Why is Emacs not prompting for anything when it needs my passphase? Am I missing any configurations to make it works?
 I am using Emacs 28.0.5 with native compilation.
 Edit: I am using Arch and Exwm and I use startx to initialize Emacs. I just noticed that, when I quit Emacs, I saw the tty shell was prompting for passphase, I have no way to enter my passphase there when I am in GUI mode, what am I supposed to do?

Nonetheless, i found that I just keep tweaking it; the lsp user interface just seems to always be in my way in some sense, or I end up disabling something I want later. (I'm using Doom, fyi.)
 I'm hoping to crowdsource a solution to my continual tweaking. Which combo of lsp features to you find are best for getting helpful info, and otherwise staying out of the way?

 ... and it's a calculator.
 https://github.com/makingthematrix/scalaonandroid/tree/main/calculator3
 From here you can download the APK file and install it on your phone with `adb` and a USB cable. I don't think it makes sense to register this app on F-Droid or, gods have mercy, Google Play Store. In the future, I will do it with a more complex app I have in plans, but for now, `adb install` is the way to go). Or you can copy the whole repo and build the app yourselves.
 Here's how it looks like:
 Scala 3 Calculator
 This remarkable achievement of razor-edge tech and top-notch UX wouldn't be possible without all the brilliant people working on Scala 3, GraalVM, Gluon, JavaFX, and scala-maven-plugin. Me, I'm just putting the puzzles together.
 That being said, Scala 3 support still needs some love. There are issues, mostly around JVM/Scala compatibility (Java modules *coff* *coff*) . Now I will spend some time describing what I found about them the best I could - and nagging the above-mentioned brilliant people to take a look. But, all in all, I think we're really doing great. I didn't expect the migration to be so easy. Just as earlier I didn't expect all these different pieces would so easily fall into their places and a Scala app on Android would just work. I feel... grateful. And also super happy - hence the tone of this entry.
 Cheers 😊

 Seems like a possible alternative to using org-mode for todo lists, but I can only find a few mentions of it online.
 I think I like the structure it imposes, because sometimes org-mode's many features and flexibility can be distracting. 
 Is it harder to integrate with other parts of Emacs?

The end result is that my table became too wide for me. Is there a way to (manually) split the second column over 2 lines? For instance my position is on the middle of the second column. Then I use some function and the rest of the column goes to a new inserted line. Thanks in advance for your help.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Is there a way to define a "super type" in Scala? It seems like types can not implement traits. What I want to do is something like this example, where I basically I have this trait:
 type ScrollBar = ... type Window = ... trait Widget[A] { def CreateScrollBar[B]() : ScrollBar def CreateWindow[B]() : Window } 
 And some type that implement it using ad hoc polymorphism:
 implicit val pmWidget : Widget[PMWidget] = new Widget[PMWidget] { def CreateScrollBar[PMScrollBar](): ScrollBar = ... def CreateWindow[PMWindow](): Window = ... } 
 But I want both ScrollBar and Window to be of a specific type, referent to my PMWidget:
 type MotifScrollBar = ... type MotifWindow = ... type MotifWidget = (MotifScrollBar, MotifWindow) 
 Is there a way to do this using type declarations? I thought about something like:
 type ScrollBar[A] = A type Window[A] = A 
 But if I implement it like this (using ints just to simplify):
 type MotifScrollBar = Int type MotifWindow = Int implicit val pmWidget : Widget[MotifWidget] = new Widget[MotifWidget] { def CreateScrollBar[MotifScrollBar](): ScrollBar[MotifScrollBar] = 0 // type mismatch here def CreateWindow[MotifWindow](): Window[MotifWindow] = 0 // type mismatch here } 
 I'm getting type mismatches where I indicated. Is there some workaround?

 But can't figure out how to get working lsp and yaml on emacs
 I followed the official guide, using npm to install the yaml lsp server and enabling the lsp mode for yaml files.
 FIRST PROBLEM: if I use the combination keys (C-M-i) I used to run company-complete, in yaml mode it runs the ispell-complete-word and I can't understand why
 SECOND PROBLEM: when I run lsp-yaml-set-buffer-schema or lsp-yaml-select-buffer-schema and I select a json schema, I get the following error in lsp-resolve-value(set-from-style) function
 (void-variable set-from-style)
 ​
 Did somebody figure out how to get working lsp and yaml on Emacs? You can even apply json schema for some CRD, like the ones managed by Istio?

 EmacsWiki: GCC Emacs said:
  
When a byte-compiled Elisp module is loaded, it gets queued for native compilation. Once native compilation has finished, the native-compiled definitions automatically replace the byte-compiled versions.
  
In my config:
 (setq native-comp-deferred-compilation t) (byte-recompile-file file nil 0 'load) 
 But functions in file are just byte-compiled, even after a looong time. I have seen emacs-lisp-native-compile-and-load, but isn't it usable for active buffers only?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello!
 As in the title; I have forked general.el to add a few autoloaded keywords of my own, by using the :general keyword use-package functions as a template. However, this bit of code, originally used for :general, is not working (read "not being autoloaded"):
 emacs-lisp (defun use-package-handler/:gone (name _keyword args rest state) "Use-package handler for :gone." (use-package-concat (use-package-process-keywords name rest state) `(,@(mapcar (lambda (arglist) ;; Note: prefix commands are not valid functions (if (or (functionp (car arglist)) (macrop (car arglist))) `(,@arglist :package ',name) `(general-def (:keymaps '(global aiern-insert-state-map aiern-normal-state-map)) ,@arglist :package ',name))) (plist-get args :arglists))))) 
 The part I have changed is the general-def bit, by adding (:keymaps '(global aiern-insert-state-map aiern-normal-state-map)). When demanding the package, it works fine. Am I missing anything here? I've also copied the use-package-autoloads/:general and use-package-handler/:general functions as well, which are exactly the same, and renaming them appropriately.
 Thank you kindly for the help!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have an issue where my .dir-locals are getting bigger and bigger, namely due to my current projects using prettier in quite a few different major modes. But also due to specific eglot setups. Enabling prettier and eglot for the relevant major-mode would work in these projects, but would start becoming annoying in the others.
 In trying to move most of the logic to my Emacs configuration and have less duplicates in each of my project roots, I tried the following:
 ;; path/to/my/project/.dir-locals.el ((nil . ((me/eglot-p . t) (me/prettier-p . t)))) ;; dotemacs.el (use-package prettier :preface (defvar-local me/prettier-p nil "Should prettier be enabled?") :hook (web-mode . me/prettier-mode-maybe) :config (put 'me/prettier-p 'safe-local-variable #'booleanp)) (defun me/prettier-mode-maybe () "Enable `prettier-mode' when the prettier executable is found locally." (when me/prettier-p (prettier-mode))) 
 The issue with that is that dir-local variables are taken into account after web-mode-hook has kicked in, even with nil when no major-mode is specified. So me/prettier-p is always nil in me/prettier-mode-maybe.
 A second attempt, ignoring dir-local variables altogether, looked like this:
 (defun me/prettier-mode-maybe () "Enable `prettier-mode' when the prettier executable is found locally." (when-let ((command (shell-command-to-string "npm list -p prettier")) (prettier-p (length> (string-trim-right command) 0))) (prettier-mode))) 
 Which is obviously too slow to be acceptable.
 What are your preferred methods to avoid having to copy the same .dir-locals.el every time you start a similar project or even reinstall your machine(s)? That was actually my case btw: I realized while reinstalling my machine how much stuff I had to copy around after cloning all my repositories.

 Tomorrow, Saturday June 19, 17:00 Zurich time, there will be a GHC ask-me-anything panel discussion.
 It will be live-streamed on YouTube on the ZuriHac channel.
 We will have Simon Peyton-Jones and Ben Gamari on the panel as GHC developers, and we need you to ask them questions!
 You can ask your questions:
  
Live via the ZuriHac Discord, channel #ghc-panel-discussion
 Live via the libera.chat IRC channel #ghc; prefix your question with nh2: ZuriHac GHC AMA question:
 Here any time (I will collect the questons until 1 hour before the event)
  
The questions will read to the panelists during the event.
 We'd like to get technical questions about GHC, e.g. “how does class instance lookup work?”, not so much personal questions like “how long have you worked on GHC?”.
  
ZuriHac is the world's largest Haskell Hackathon. It is free to join, and this year it is remote, so you can join simply by registering on https://zfoh.ch/zurihac2021/ Registering will send you the Discord invite, in case you want to ask your questions there.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What is Hideout?
  
Hideout is a self-hosted service that makes private, persistent chat rooms possible. It requires no installation or account creation. Unlike disposable chat, a Hideout room preserves privacy without expiring.
 The GitHub repo contains a detailed introduction, and guides for hosting, building, and contributing: https://github.com/techmindful/hideout
 A video demo can be watched here: https://vimeo.com/564494164.
 A demo instance is running at hideout-demo.com. Uptime is expected to be unstable. Do not trust it for your own private conversations.
 Language stack is Haskell/Elm. Haskell, Elm, and the privacy community need more killer apps! Hideout tries to be as pretty and feature-rich as possible, so that when people opt for privacy, they won't be getting a lackluster alternative.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone,
 Chordify is hiring again! This post might look familiar to you if you've been around here for a while. That's because I posted about a vacancy we had back in October. Since then, we've hired two new developers, but we're still expanding!
 Chordify is a music platform that you can use to automatically detect the chords in any song you like. This way we help musicians to play all of their favourite music in an easy and intuitive way. You can try it at https://chordify.net
 Now, the backend for our website and apps, that are used by millions of people worldwide, is written in Haskell! We serve the user using primarily Servant, Persistent and Esqueleto. We also have a custom Redis caching layer and use an advanced Cloud Haskell setup to distribute our chord analysis computations.
 We are quickly becoming an autonomous workforce, meaning there is pretty much no hierarchy, and we are looking to expand our fast-growing team with a pro-active, independent and creative functional programmer to further improve Chordify. You'd get the opportunity to work with advanced type systems to power a website that serves millions.
 More information and a form to apply can be found at https://jobs.chordify.net. If you have any questions, feel free to ask them in this thread, or reach out to me at [rik@chordify.net](mailto:rik@chordify.net).
 We strive for diversity in our team, and encourage people of all backgrounds and genders to apply.
 One more thing, this is explicitly NOT a remote job. We expect our new colleague to come work with us at our (new!) office in Utrecht, The Netherlands.

I've been processing papers on psychology lately (on retrieval practice and reading comprehension) but I'm having trouble implementing the concept of "layers of evidence" as described in https://zettelkasten.de/posts/layers-of-evidence/.
In the post, @sfast said: (my emphasis for context)

  
The next layer of evidence is the interpretation of data patterns. The phenomenological layer meant you describe what you saw. Here, you interpret why you saw it.
Now the concept of causality can come into play. You can explain the correlation above by saying: Drowning people in swimming pools generates amplifiers for the nuclear power plants in the U.S, and that’s why when more people drown in swimming pools, more energy is generated in nuclear power plants.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I run into a problem of ediff-files hanging. How to figure out the root cause? 
 When I performed ediff between two files, after providing file B, the emacs hanged, without displaying the ediff buffers, but the status area shows "processing difference regions ... done". 
 The emacs process has to be aborted through task manager. C-g would not work, neither SPC q 
 The emacs version is Emacs 27.1. 
 The emacs-config of tecosaur (https://github.com/tecosaur/emacs-config) is used with the recent Doom. 
 Here is a screenshot showing where it hanged and the high CPU utilization of the emacs process. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2638417/122454243-05707c00-cf60-11eb-8bb7-93c39339811d.png) 
 I tried ediff-buffers has the same problem.(edited)
 I really like emacs-config that I want to make it work. Thanks in advance for helps!

He say's we need a container to store the result i.e, myresult[ aggSum ] . My question is Why do we need to store the result ( aggSum ) inside myResult ( container ), when we can represent the sum of elements using aggSum. If he says Optional[aggSum] / Either[aggSum] I would understand but he wants to store it in a container. So what exactly is a container ?, why is it's purpose ?, does it has to do anything with generics.

Not only cannot I not access cmus, I can't access anything.
 However, I have no idea what caused this, where to fix it, and how to fix it. Can anyone help? I've looked around, but can't find a good answer.
 Also, when I run emacs -Q, the terminal DOES seem to work fine.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Greetings, emacsians. I'm trying to set up org mode for personal task management and have come across the issue that apparently org mode list items can't be todo items (only checkmarked items) and that only headings can actually be org mode todos. This is quite a disappointment as I enjoy the automatic numbering and nicely formatted nestability available for lists and also the agenda views of todo items, and I would very much like to use them together.
 Are there any packages which fix this dilemma? Or any elisp way to do this? Or are miracles real and is there a way to actually do this in normal org mode? Any of these would be much appreciated!
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi! I'm mostly a Java guy, but with the new functional bits in Java I found Scala people many times have already developed good practices for things we are still struggling with, so I'm asking here.
 Recently there is a trend in my workplace to replace null-friendly values with Optional, so (simplified case, you get the idea)
 NamedObject obj = ..... if(obj == null){ return "no object, so no name" } else { return obj.name(); } 
 becomes
 Optiona<NamedObject> opt = .... return opt.map(NamedObject::name).orElse("no object, so no name") 
 I like that, but I don't know how to handle logging. When I have
 NamedObject obj = ..... if(obj == null){ logger.warn("there was no object") return "no object, so no name" } else { logger.debug("using actual name of the object") return obj.name(); } 
 What would be the proper way to keep the logging functionality in a more functional way?

Every emacs tutorial seems to call for installing either Ivy or Helm, however few are able to describe why they are necessary without referring to use cases and jargon that I either can't relate to or don't understand (my use cases for now involve task management, calendar management, and writing with only a small secondary emphasis on coding).
 I've opted not to go with Helm for now based on some complaints about performance, but the question remains of whether or not to install Ivy. So, for those of you who have experienced both vanilla emacs and Ivy emacs, what are the features (if any) that Ivy provides that you just can't live without? Also, what are the worst things about Ivy?
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I am beginner learning Haskell and Cabal toolchain/workflow. Currently, I am compiling simple Haskell code with C-wrapper into foreign native shared library on Linux. To make the toolchain commands and package loading/(future) dependencies easier to manage, I am doing it with Cabal. I found a reference in this site (among others):
 http://www.vex.net/~trebla/haskell/so.xhtml
 At first, I missed key point:
 "The Haskell code is to be listed under other-modules."
 I did not set the other-modules field and my build wasnt working. Now it works. But I wanted to ask why the name of the field was chosen as to other-modules, since it actually makes the connection between Haskell code and the C code wrapper? Without having the clue that "it doesnt work without it," I would never try to search for something like that ...
 Let me know if this is not the correct place to ask this question and where would a better place for that be.

I'm finding that some of my files are not being added to org-agenda automatically even though I'm using the config below. Am I doing something wrong here?
  (setq org-agenda-files (apply 'append (mapcar (lambda (directory) (directory-files-recursively directory org-agenda-file-regexp)) '("/Users/ochaa/Code/org/"))))

 I am using notmuch in Emacs, whenever I sent an email and sync the mailbox, my sent email shown as an unread email in my notmuch emacs client. This is very annoying.
 I am hosting my own Email server using dovecot and postfix. I am not sure whether this is a server side issue or client side issue. I knew it may not be caused by notmuch or Emacs, but I had no issue when using mu4e.
 Is this normal? What can I do to fix?

 I was wondering what options do we have in org-mode to save metadata on web links.
 I have counted 6500 https?:// links in all my notes and I would like to categorize at least some of them, in time.
 I don't want to use titles for them, but I know that only titles have properties, or drawers.
 Right now my pseudo random convention is:
 
 This is a list of useful links:
 Wow, this article is so nice:
 https://example.com/whatever
 > summary line 1
 > summary line 2
 Written by the same author as the previous:
 https://foo.bar.com/stuff
 > summary line
 > summary line 2
 
 I would like to add metadata such as:
  
some tags, or categories for the links (eg: technical, art, spiritual)
 if it's a git repo mention the programming language
 if it's an article mention the author's name
 if I save it offline, take a note about that
 different fields that I don't know yet
  
Does anyone use anything like that? Maybe there's a library that does something similar?
 Thank you
 edit: fix formatting

This uses two short and straightforward Keyboard Maestro macros. One to place the file in the /media directory and then forms the link, placing it in the clipboard for pasting, and the second calls the file and opens it in its default application. This all works beautifully with my Two Window Workflow keeping the target note in focus while reviewing the attachment alongside in a separate window. Simple is as simple does!
This video shows this process in action. The triggers are hard to grasp and hard to display. The trigger for the "Form Media Links" macro is ⌃⌥⇧⌘M whi…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm looking for a lib that would allow me to build up a markdown doc using some DSL out of primitives (Blocks, Inlines, etc) and then simply convert it to a `Text` representation (i.e. render into text).
 This seems like such an easy thing to do, I've googled for potential solutions to this however and I'm having a real hard time figuring out how to do this with current libs available on hackage.
 I've looked at `cmark` `mmark`, even `pandoc` to no avail. It seems to me that libs like `mmark` are designed to only parse markdown documents, ensure conformity to standards, and render to html.
 I thought `pandoc` would be my saving grace (which I reluctantly tried to use since it's such a large dependency), their `Block` DSL seems fine, but even `pandoc` does not have something like `render :: Pandoc -> Text`. It does have `writeMarkdown :: PandocMonad m => WriterOptions -> Pandoc -> m Text` but i really want to have a pure rendering function without all this `PandocMonad` complication (which seems superfluous if I want to render into a simple `Text` doc).
 (https://hackage.haskell.org/package/pandoc-2.14.0.2/docs/Text-Pandoc-Writers-Markdown.html) 
 Anyone has a suggestion?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a Haskell project that I've been working on over the last few years.
 One thing I absolutely love about Haskell is that its so easy to refactor with confidence, for example renaming and changing types, and the compiler flags any issues early on.
 What I would like to do now is to consolidate the names of parameters. So for example, I started with a function for working with indices and counts of elements.
 ```
 indicesRemaining :: Cnt -> Idx -> [Idx]
 indicesRemaining cnt idx = <some-implentation>
 ```
 and say I've renamed the types to be clearer, using a global find-replace:
 ```
 indicesRemaining :: BlockCnt -> BlockIdx -> [BlockIdx]
 indicesRemaining cnt idx = <some-implementation>
 ```
 this is great, but I'd like to also update cnt and idx, to be blkCnt and blkIdx, for example. I can do in manually, but I've done a load of refactorings, so have a load of these.
 What I am looking for is a tool that can run over my code-base, and spurt out a list of types, and all the different variables names used by that type. So, if I have the following code:
 ``` indicesRemaining :: BlockCnt -> BlockIdx -> [BlockIdx]
 indicesRemaining blkCnt blkIdx = <some-implementation>
 indexWithinCnt :: BlockCnt -> BlockIdx -> Bool
 indexWithinCnt cntMax idx = <some-implementation>
 ```
 Then, I am looking for something like the following output:
 ``` BlockCnt : blkCnt, cntMax
 BlockIdx : blkIdx, idx
 ```
 And I can then go through and manually review cases where lots of different names exist for the same thing.
 Is anyone aware whether something like this already exists? If not, I was wondering if HIE would be a good tools to build something like this on top of??
 Best wishes, and thanks in advance.
 Mike

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm an IDE user (JetBrains currently, Visual Studio when I used to write C#) with basic Vim knowledge, using primarily Java and JS with some TS. I'm getting tired of the less-than-useful vim support in the IDE space, as well as general inflexibility in setting up workflows. I've been looking into emacs (spacemacs) as a daily-driver, and I like almost everything about it. However, I'm not sure what I'll do with a certain part of my workflow that relies on refactoring support.
 This applies less to new features, and more to maintenance work on legacy(ish) code, which is honestly a lot of what I do. I've come to heavily rely on Kent Beck's "make the hard change easy" advice, combined with Arlo Belshee's read by refactoring. I like that I can use chains of known-safe IDE refactorings to rapidly explore and change the structure of a body of code before I even understand what it's doing, and know that I'm not changing the semantics in the process.
 Seems like a decent portion of my go-to tools are supported in JS with js2-refactor, but not all. (Haven't looked at whether it works with TS yet, and Tide may also be able to fill some holes even when applied to plain-JS.) On the other hand meghanada has been a bit disappointing in the refactoring department. Rust, if I ever work with that, looks to have an absolutely phenomenal language server.
 In addition to my two primaries, I'd like to be confident in branching out into, say, Go, Kotlin, or Swift, and I see about as much refactoring support for each of those as what meghanada has for Java; that is, nearly nothing.
 What do experienced emacs-ians do for these tasks? Do former IDE users among you not miss automated refactorings? Do you have emacs-native workflows that reliably work for, say, "extract/inline variable/function/parameter"?

 explore :: (ComonadCofree f w, MonadFree f m) => (w a -> m b -> m b) -> w a -> m b explore f = wrap . fmap (\w -> f w (explore f w)) . unwrap 
 I've been calling it explore because it behaves as a kind of fold over a cofree comonad into a free monad: the first argument to f is the part of the comonadic "environment" that's getting "explored" in this step, and the second argument is the future monadic "exploration" that covers the "rest of the environment".
 Is this a thing? I haven't been able to find anything on Hackage with exactly this functionality, but I'm afraid I don't quite have the categorical vocabulary to easily tell if it's a special case of a definition in adju…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Is there any way to do this? I'd like all my org mode files to be part of an "org project", regardless of their locations. I use projectile, ibuffer, ibuffer-projectile, and (obviously) org-mode.
 At the moment I've got:
 (setq org-directory "~/.emacs.d/config/org/") (setq ibuffer-saved-filter-groups (quote [...] ("orgproject" (or (name . "^\\*Org Agenda\\*$") (mode . org-mode))) 
 which I thought would do it, but it doesn't. I expected all buffers with org-mode active would be listed within an "orgproject" group in ibuffer, and files that are in the org-directory are in that group, but files that are in other directories, even though they're open and in org-agenda-files, just go into a general group in ibuffer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am trying to use shakle to tame the pop ups that I have (in combination with popper). One case I have is AUCTeX which displays a list of errors if the document fails to compile. Clicking on an error brings up a new window which shows details of the error.
 I wanted to set it so that the list of errors appear at the bottom and then the error description appears at the right of the error list. I tried the following
  (setq shackle-rules '(("*TeX errors*" :select t :align below :size 0.2) ("*TeX Help*" :select t :align right :size 0.5))) 
 Now, if I have a window displaying the latex file, the list of errors appears at the bottom as expected, but then clicking on an error adds a vertical window spanning the whole interface (both the latex buffer and the error list buffer) instead of splitting the window which displays "TeX errors". 
 Is there a way to get my desired window splitting?

More precisely, I just want to remove the (ivy-rich-switch-buffer-project (:width 0.18 :face success)) part of it, that shows to which project a buffer belongs when switching buffers. Redefining the entire variable without this bit clutters my config a lot since this variable has a lot of content. Is there a few to just remove that bit from the original value of the variable? I tried to do it using my limited elisp, but I couldn't do it even in a semi-elegant way. Any tips there? Cheers!

 I can never remember the syntax, and I don't use it often enough to learn it, so it would be most helpful if I could go M-x insert-file-local-variable or something.
 Ok, so this is where Emacs is great:
 After I remembered that it is called "file local variables" I did M-x apropos file-local and found... add-file-local-variable which does exact what I wanted.
 So the answer is: Yes!

 split :: ConsList a z -> ConsList a b -> ConsList b z
 or even just:
 tail :: ConsList a z -> ConsList b z
 Alternatively, is this possible using free monads?

 Is there a way to automate this, beyond just using after-save-hook? 
  
Could this be done by Emacs when installing the package?
 Could this be done by Github after I push to the repo?
 Are there existing packages that have automated this step?
  
Thank you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So here's the setup. I've got two projects. 
 f:\project-base
 f:\project-base\specific-case
 I cannot change the layout of these projects; they're not under my control.
 It's legitimate to want to compile project-base on its own. However, most of the time I want to compile specific-case.
 Both project-base and specific-case have .dir-locals.el files, and I'm using the files to define relative paths to tools and the like. I've defined an override variable that I can set within a hydra called project--path-override. However, if I invoke my hydra while visiting a buffer that's in project-base, it uses the .dir-locals.el from that directory. That's kind of as I expect, but if my override is set, I'd like to figure out a way to use the locals from the override directory.
 Even if I invoke the hydra and set the default-directory to the project--path-override and call (hack-dir-local-variables-non-file-buffer), the local variables from project-base are still set.
 I don't really want to have to defvar all of these configuration variables somewhere and update them every time I switch project directories; being free of that management is exactly why I'm using .dir-locals.el in the first place. 
 I also thought that I might be able to create a fake buffer as part of invoking the hydra, but that seems like a needless mess of its own. 
 Anyone have a more manageable solution? I can always switch back to a file in specific-case, but I often forget to do that and launch a compile in the wrong directory first. Plus, I'm doing most of my work in project-base, so I end up having to visit random files that I actually don't care about in specific-case just to get the vars to be set right. (I could also modify the .dir-locals.el in project-base to match the one in specific-case, but this falls apart if I ever try to do anything in specific-case2.)

 When I write docstrings in my Lisp code, I like the source to be auto-filled so that line breaks appear in sensible places, but I don't like those auto-filled newlines to appear in the runtime versions of those docstrings (since the line width may vary between my editor and whatever is printing the docstring). To that effect, I've been using auto-fill-mode to insert newlines as appropriate, and then manually putting backslash characters at the end of each broken lines. This is undesirable for a few reasons, including that it means auto-fill makes some lines longer than will fit once I've added a space and a backslash.
 Is there any way to get fill-paragraph to insert these backslashes for me?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have just finished the first article or a substantial post if you like , where Zettelkasten did help me to gather ideas, combine them and produce something valuable (on how to choose the statistical significance level for your AB-tests and what effect does the choice have).
I happily published it and.. what do you, guys, usually do with the articles of yours then?
The final article definitely does contain some valuable knowledge (valuable to me certainly). If I have found something like this on the internets, I would probably compose several zettles out of it and saved to the local storage for references (I tend to not just link to the web, but also store referred things locally so they don't disappear).
But in this particular case, zettels the article was based on do exist already, there's nothing new to extract. What do you usually do with the work of yours?
- Do you still add it to your Zettelkasten as a giant Zettel?
- Or do you store it and make a dummy zettel just so that you have a link to this reference in ZK?
- Or do you review your existing zettels that contributed to the article and add a reference to the final target?
- Or do you do nothing as all the knowledge from this article is in your ZK already and that's good enough?
- Or something else?]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, I have a new notation for rendering function application and composition at the type level. It may make some Haskell concepts clearer and may be useful for expressing other things such as complicated logical combinators
 The change is simple, just write the function result type on a 3-D plate and have the function argument type orbit it--hence the term orbit diagram. It's rendered in orthographic perspective. Something about the extra dimension and the clear difference between domain and codomain make it easier to see what's going on when function types get complicated. In particular it helped me grasp the Yoneda lemma and continuation-passing style better
 More info in the readme and some examples can be found in the following repo:

 mothers, fathers, elder siblings. listen to your little fellows when they come to you, and say "my friends are trying something", or if they say "when i grow up, i want to customise my text editor". i beg you, deliver them from this.. this... evil. or else, you may have to watch them edit-last-kbd-macro, with your hands tied, and heart broken. i was young, alone, and misguided, but you're adults and you can understand. listen to this lost soul!

I guess this is similar to using "expand-selection", but I wonder if it's possible to mimic the LibreOffice behaviour. Any ideas?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I want to get better at the language, and the way to achieve that (that makes the most sense to me) is to apply for a job to be trained. So I've been job hunting for Haskell positions. 
 Naturally, I got rejected from most of the applications. I'm expecting to get rejected in all, tbh. Getting rejected doesn't bother me though since I'm pretty new to Haskell anyway. This is pretty much the only expected outcome.
 Anyway, I'm more concerned with how I can get my first step through an internship. It (internship) appears to be non-existent in the Haskell industry, which it makes it difficult to get some really good hands-on training with the proper learning environment. So with that, it seems like internship is pretty much impossible. I noticed a common expectation among the rejection messages that I'm expected to have more experience with the language. But getting this experience is rather difficult, and I don't really see a clear path to obtain a decent enough experience with it.
 I'm wondering: 
  
Do personal projects hold any weight in the deliberation process?
 Is contributing to Haskell OSS the only/better way for people to validate that I know something?
 Do I just work for free?
 How do I know what I'm doing isn't a bad approach without anyone there to program with or to act as a mentor? I'm pretty much alone in self-learning. I tried streaming but it's sometimes very distracting, and really daunting.
  
This post isn't meant to gather pity from others, please don't pity me! I just want to know what I should focus on doing exactly to get a much better chance next time, since this entire thing feels like a chicken and egg situation. If you're a business owner, or an employee in a company that uses Haskell in your company, any insight would be much appreciated!

So I can configure it once and load it like this, before any other code in my init.el file. I try to speed up load time. I already found very old version of this theme in repo history, but it doesn't have all necessary color changes, as latest one have.

 I'm using mbsync and mu4e with a very large IMAP tree. It takes ages to update. On the other hand, thunderbird very quickly updates the inboxes. I suspect that thunderbird has more frequent checks (polling the IMAP server for new messages) for inboxes compared to other folders. Is something similar possible in mysync ? Right now, the delay between reception on the server and mu4e updating is just too long. 
 Cheers

 I'm looking for a solution to switch between tabs (tab-bar) using ivy counsel.

 A super noob question but I've been digging into theming (as one does) and wanted to know how to tell if a theme is a "color theme" or a "custom theme"? I'm inclined to go with the "color theme" variant as it seems to be super easy to reset to the original state. Also I am only wanting color changes and not interface changes (yet).
 As an example monokai for emacs.
 Thanks!

writing format that tries to combine the readability and intuitiveness of
Markdown with the rigorous requirements of technical authoring and publishing.
It offers power and flexibility without resorting to HTML or tool-specific

or features like automatically generating a table of contents.
This post presents a new AsciiDoc parser and converter in Haskell, called
asciidoc-hs. It has been developed
with the support of a Tweag Open Source Fellowship, and is BSD licensed. It
aims to be the first AsciiDoc processor that can be directly used as a Pandoc
front-end1. It is still far from complete
in terms of AsciiDoc syntax and features, but it hopefully establishes a solid
foundation to build up…]]></summary>

application will query a REST service that serves XML (preferred) or JSON
 that XML links to other endpoints that might get queried depending on user-interaction
 the served XML changes infrequently, usually less than once every 2h
  
Because the data gets changed relatively seldomly and I don't want to query too much (rate-limits) I want to cache the responses.
 Is anyone doing something similar? What library can you recommend?
  
Currently I am thinking about the following options:
  
hedis: seems a good suit but I will need to figure out Redis
 acid-state or TCache: seem the next best suit?
 beam-sqlite: seems sub-optimal as I don't really need persistence but I am familiar with it
  
What options/libraries am I overlooking? Preferably, I would like a more light-weight solution and avoiding pulling in too many dependencies.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is something I've been trying to do for a while: have an all-day event (like a vacation, or a holiday) marked in a different color than the other events on the agenda so it stands out and easy to find later (good use-case example for me: marking sick days so I can later write them out on our monthly reports). 
 It's a bit long, but it contains a lot of different bits of information I hope you'd find useful. Enjoy!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey there,
 So I use 'Swiper' but have found that it chugs like crazy on a huge log file (ex: Takes a minute to process a query if its a specific date in a log file).
 I currently use Helm and Company in my config.
 I mention this because I tried employing this workaround in this GitHub post, but it uses Ivy unfortunately:
 https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper/issues/416
 ​
 This is the workaround:
 (global-set-key "\C-s" 'ora-swiper)
 ​
 (defun ora-swiper ()
 (interactive)
 (if (and (buffer-file-name)
 (not (ignore-errors
 (file-remote-p (buffer-file-name))))
 (if (eq major-mode 'org-mode)
 (> (buffer-size) 60000)
 (> (buffer-size) 300000)))
 (progn
 (save-buffer)
 (counsel-grep))
 (swiper--ivy (swiper--candidates))))
 ​
 Any ideas on how to avoid conflicts and what I could use instead? It appears from the workaround the 'counsel-grep' is the way to go though (which I believe is the front-end for 'ripgrep').
 ​
 I'm assuming I would have to find Helm's version of 'swiper--ivy (swiper--candidates)' instead, but wanted to confirm this.
 ​
 Or should I somehow figure out how to grep the entire file for a search query, and redirect it to a new temporary buffer instead?

 Repost with a more descriptive header after suggestion from github-alphapapa. :)
 I am a bit lost and need some help to get nudged in the right direction. 
 Using Doom Emacs and Org mode with Org Roam.
 I've set up a set of org-roam-capture-templates. When I try to create a new file, by entering a filename that does not exist, with Org-roam-find-file (SPC n r f), I am prompted with the Capture templates. 
 Before I set up Capture templates, a new file would be created when I entered a filename that did not exist.
 What I want is for the file to be created, as it did before I set up Capture templates.
 I've tried Googling and reading in the manual, but I must be missing it.
 Does anyone know what I can read up on and provide a link, or maybe let me know what I've missed? If you let me know what I've missed, I would be very grateful if you could tip me on what I should have read in order to figure it out myself.
 Thanks in advance!

 ((nil . ((pyvenv-workon . "fancy-python-env")))) 
 When I open a file in the same directory as my .dir-locals.el for the first, emacs used to ask me whether to mark the newly declared variable as safe. But recently, I must have messed something up in emacs config because it longer asks me, but simply prints a warning message:
 Ignoring unsafe file local variable: pyvenv-workon 
 Any way I can revert to the previous behavior of Emacs regarding local variables?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In Emacs Lisp, is there a built in system or third party package that helps you trace variables?
 I’m thinking of two ways I might want to do this. 
  
Like trace-function, but for variables i.e. producing a log of updates to a variable
 With a “watch list” buffer like IDEs usually have that updates defined variables or expressions when the variables change
  
I looked through the manual and searched a bit and have not really found anything. This seems like such obvious functionality though so I feel like I must have just missed it. Thought I’d ask here before rolling my own. 
 How are people tracing variables in Elisp?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have two diaries I have written in org-mode, and both of them have entries in top-level headlines, where the next line is an inactive timestamp, like:
 * This is an top-level headline :headlines:orgmode:reddit: [2021-06-14 Mon 13:19] Diary entry goes here. Lots of multiline text. 
 Originally, these diary entries were in reverse chronological order. At some point, I forgot and started adding new entries at the bottom of the document. At this point, the change in order is about halfway through the document. I know I could start moving individual headlines up to the top, one by one, with M-S-up/down, but there are hundreds of entries, and I'd rather do one command that sorts the entire document.
 Is there an org-mode command that will sort all of the headlines in the document based on the inactive timestamp? Preferably with the options of either chronological or reverse chronological order?

Right now I use high-level functions to compose an email in a message-mode buffer via mu4e. But it seems like it would be smarter to just assemble the email as a string (or maybe in a hidden buffer) and then send it using sendmail-program. Has anyone done this kind of thing, and is it hard? I can keep using mu4e if it's the best option, but it's somewhat slow and I'd like to reduce the latency if possible. thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am happy to announce that I have released my new library - rrb-vector. It provides an implemention of the RRB-Vector data structure, which can be used as an alternative to Data.Sequence.Seq a (from the containers package).
 It supports very fast indexing/updating and iteration (faster than for Seq a), while other operations, like concatenation, append, prepend, take, drop, etc. are also quite efficient. Most of the operations have a complexity of O(log n), but since the logarithms are base 16, that behaves more like O(1) in most cases.
 For more information, see the documentation on Hackage. I'd be happy for your feedback!

 In some ways it feels like using a template engine, but the end-user experience is much nicer, because data is streamed from the server and everything is written on/for the backend. Almost, like a hybrid between, say, Twirl and Scala.JS/Laminar, except that client-server communication appears to be entirely transparent to the developer.

 This is a joke of course. Centaur-tabs is a great package, and I can see it becoming a nifty part of my workflow, but can't help think about how buffer-focused emacs is, and yet, tabs are a pretty standard feature in every editor and browser now. I think the tab-bar is a great visual indicator of the open buffers. And DOOM seems to have some nice integrations for it. 
 Thanks for coming to my TED talk.
 Edit - yes, I've leaned into the buffer-centric workflow for a year or more now but tab-bar mode or whatever it is that centaur-tabs offers works for me. https://xkcd.com/1172/

 I started fooling around with Linux the other day (Pop OS). I just assumed that installing Emacs via 'apt' would provide me with Emacs 27.x... No dice.
 To keep up to date on Emacs are people really building from source? Is there a package repo that keeps an up to date version?
 If I'm going to build it myself are there any options I should consider. It's a bit embarrassing that I'm so used to the install and go experience I've been getting with Emacs on the Mac.
 Edit: Turns out it was org-tempo and org-indent-mode, both of which I believe I added for Emacs 27... I can't remember if I upgraded to 27 for a specific reason or not on OS X, so I can forget ahead with 26 for now with those disabled.
 Thanks all.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[dyncloze is an emacs module (offered via Melpa) for testing yourself on language learning. The core idea is that you can take any piece of text in emacs, and form "clozes" (an Anki terminology), that erase the work in question and let you guess what it should be. For example, you can test, in English "in" vs. "on", and every location of those words will be replaced by a cloze, denoted by "[ ]" and you are led through each of them and asked to guess each one. At the end, it tells you how well you did.
 In version 0.1, we started with the ability just to test two or more words against each other. With this version, 0.2 (just submitted, not yet updated on Melpa), we add the ability to use regex's for testing. That opens the ability to do more useful testing, at least with European languages that have a lot of word variants and word-ending grammatical bits.
 I've added two example files, one for Spanish, one for Portuguese to demonstrate. You can load them up and try out functions such as dyncloze-es-ser-estar, which will let you guess every variant of ser and estar ("eras", "fui", "está", "estaba", etc.), but you just choose which of the verbs it belongs to: ser or estar. There's a similar function that lets you choose between perfect and imperfect tenses.
 If you'd like to contribute, please open pull requests for the language you are studying with more examples (or fix up an issues with the ones I have).

 ​
 It seems that only M-- works, C-- is C-_ which is undo command instead.
 Any ideas? Thanks a lot.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello! I present to you my first emacs package - atp. It's intended as a component for writing text editing commands and augmenting modal editing modes. Its main feature is the ability to automatically recognize and highlight things at point and apply commands to highlighted things or active region.
 I started working on this package because I was lookig for a new approach that would help me save a couple of keystrokes on each common task such as copying and pasting text, evaluation of lisp expressions and shell-commands, changing letter case, etc.
 For a year I used a wonderful package "expand-region" for that purpose. Despite it being very smart and useful, it requires 2 actions to select an object under the point. First, the user must navigate to the desired location, and then call er/expand-region to select an object. I thought that the second step was redundant and decided to write a package that will work without it.
 At this moment atp is unstable because it was written in a hurry and my knowledge of elisp and emacs internals isn't great. I just wanted to write something usable as soon as I could to check the viability of the chosen approach. Here is a repo and a video that demonstrates how atp works in the context of a tiny modal editing mode.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 The construction of my aggregate is side-effectful. I need to go to the DB, check for some invariants, then decide if I can construct it or not.
 While with side effect-free construction, I'd just create a smart constructor in a companion objects. For example:
 ```scala case class Aggregate(...)
 object Aggregate { def create(...): Either[Error, Aggregate] = ??? } ```
 Since now my creation is side effectful, I consider a few options:
 Option #1 - separate class for the factory
 ```scala case class Aggregate(...)
 class AggregateFactory[F[_]](repository: Repository[F]) { def create(...): F[Either[Error, Aggregate]] = ??? } ```
 Then I'd just pass AggregateFactory around where needed.
 Option #2 - curried smart constructor
 ```scala case class Aggregate(...)
 object Aggregate { def create[F[_]](repository: Repository[F])(...): F[Either[Error, Aggregate]] = ??? } ```
 and then I could pass around just the partially applied create function, e.g.
 scala def factory[F[_]]: ... => F[Either[Error, Aggregate]] = Aggregate.create(repository)(_) 
 What do you think is the most idiomatic approach to the side-effectful construction?

 With this deriving Traversable-like type classes and Distributive becomes possible, as well as type classes with lenses.

I have been debating about the use of so-called "literature notes" for a while now (actually, since I first learned of them). The definition seemed a bit nebulous. Reading Ahrens's book, I got the impression that literature notes were more or less bibliographic entries. They had references to some pages along with keywords and key ideas, but were mostly used for reference. And, being so, they were stored. They were permanent.
Then, reading here, I got the impression from Christian and many others that literature notes were literally notes taken on the literature (or in a notebook): marginalia, brief comments, reminders, etc. Their goal under this view is to be processed a…]]></summary>

 Should I be concerned with strictness at this point? For example, should I worry about sharing and practice writing code accordingly or be concerned with optimization only when it actually becomes a performance issue?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is a quirk I ran into recently, and am wondering if someone can provide some insight about it.
 I have an abstract trait with a type param that represents some intermediate representation (IR) that can be converted to the type param:
  trait IR[O] { def toOutput: O } 
 I have a concrete implementation of this trait:
  case class StringIR(data: String) extends IR[(Int, String)] { def toOutput: (Int, String) = (data.length, data) } 
 Then I want to define a circe Encoder for the IR trait, assuming the O already has an Encoder.
 This is the first way I implemented it:
  implicit def encoder[O : Encoder, R <: IR[O]]: Encoder[R] = Encoder.instance { r: IR[O] => Encoder[O].apply(r.toOutput) } 
 But when I try to get an implicit Encoder for StringIR it results in a compiler error:
  diverging implicit expansion for type io.circe.Encoder[StringIR] starting with lazy value currencyEncoder in object Encoder 
 An interesting thing I noticed is that the error doesn't always mention the currencyEncoder. Sometimes it's other provided encoders.
 So then I implemented the encoder like this:
  implicit def encoder[O : Encoder, R <: IR[O]]: Encoder[R with IR[O]] = Encoder.instance { r: IR[O] => Encoder[O].apply(r.toOutput) } 
 The only difference is that I'm using Encoder[R with IR[O]] instead of Encoder[R]. 
 Here's a Scastie with a working example: https://scastie.scala-lang.org/alexklibisz/VvnYuNiGS5SN7R5GwV5cHg/25 
 It seems like the implicit resolution doesn't know that an Encoder[R with IR[O]] is the same as an Encoder[R]. I know I used Circe here, but I don't see how it would be any different for any old type class. Is there any more precise explanation for this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, 
 As there seems to be a demand for practical Haskell examples/applications, I decided to create a video series to show an example of how such an application could be developed. In this case I chose to show how to process streamed binary satellite data and build a Haskell application for this. This starts with basic things like network connections, conduits, goes over logging, config file handling, command line parsing to parsing the binary ground- and space-protocols involved, threading (for parallel processing chains), STM and finally displaying the results in a graphical user interface (with GTK). 
 This also can serve as an introduction to the AURIS mission control system I am writing in Haskell (on ZuriHac and MuniHac there was some demand for more explanations as the project is a bit intimidating and requires some domain knowledge). So I thought I could combine this and provide some insight into this domain, while showing how such an application could work in Haskell. 
 Each video builds on its predecessor. The current ones are: 
  
Video 1: Introduction and Project Setup 
 Video 2: Network Connections and Conduits 
 Video 3: Configuration Files 
 Video 4: Command Line Arguments 
 Video 5: Parsing the Transport Protocol Layer 
 Video 6: Parsing the TM Transfer Layer 
 Video 7: CRC Check, Interfacing C++, Property Tests 
 Video 8: Logging and the RIO Monad
 
 Further ones are planned, but not yet available.
 I might be going quickly sometimes (as I wanted to focus on certain areas and the videos are already quite long), so if there is a demand for more detailed explanations of certain things, let me know.
 The video series as a Youtube playlist:

The code can easily be looked up in official documentation and referred to in forums, StackOverflow, etc.. There is work underway which could lead to the same functionality in GHC.
 I wondered whether there's a particularly strong reason for numeric error codes as opposed to human readable identifiers. For example, would conflicting_trait_implementations be a more useful error code than E0119? None of the reasons given in the discussion for avoiding readable error codes rang true for me, and, surprisingly to me, no one at all supported readable error codes.
 Are my instincts completely out of tune on this issue, or would readable error codes have some benefit over numeric ones?

 But lately i have been thinking if i was wrong or if my assumptions still holds true, today ides like vs code provide all the above features in a fast modern looking ide.
 So does the question of Emacs vs Modern IDEs boils down to asthetic choice between modern vs classic/vintage or is there any real advantage in using Emacs today.

 What if we can have these for emacs? Well, we have something similar. For example, bui and tui.el. However, afaik the first one only supports multiple columns, in contrast to bashtop where multiple windows of arbitrary size are supported. The second one does not have a screenshot, but it seems a bit promising too.
 TLDR I hope to have/make a general UI for emacs. Any hints?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As a preface, I am using GHC 8.10.4, and I've read a few posts about hang ups with this version of GHC. My main build tool is Stack so using stack build --fast works just fine, while running stack build (using -O2) does causes the hang up. Some of the suggested comments from the similar posts say to sprinkle in some {- OPTIONS_GHC -O1 -} on the offending files to allow it compile. However, I can't seem to find the right one to use it on. 
 My question is: How do I debug this compiler issue? My terminal always hangs up after it prints [ 9 of 17] Compiling Display. Is this the offending file? Or is it something that comes after? 
 Are there any options I can pass to the compiler to get some more verbose output to diagnose the issue?
 Thanks
 EDIT: I've done some brief testing as per /u/manpacket suggested. Display.hs seems to be the offending file. 
 The testing is by no means robust and is simply using stack clean && stack build each time. The left hand side indicates which instance definitions have had their undefined definition returned to normal. 
 The timings are as follows:
 all undefined - 18.8s storeLoc - 18.9s storeLoc/OperandType - 18.5s storeLoc/OperandType/Operand - 22.7s storeLoc/OperandType/OpCode - 31.8s storeLoc/OperandType/Instruction - 18.8s storeLoc/OperandType/Instruction/CPUState - 43.2s storeLoc/OperandType/CPUState - 42.8s 
 It seems as though the issue stems from the repeated use of <>?
 The github repo is here if you want to take a look.

 b. second child item

 Instead of what orgmode currently does, which is:
 1\. First list item.
  
first child item
 second child item

 Spent a couple of days now looking at various options for typescript development. Specifically, I'm interested in some refactoring workflows (extraction, renaming etc).
 There's js2-refactor. It relies on js2-mode which appears to be..quirky? It's using it's own internal linter which doesn't seem to support all of the latest TypeScript features.
 I'm now looking at LSP-mode with typescript, but there doesn't seem to be any support for refactoring.
 How are you coding typescript with emacs? Is there robust refactoring support?
 Thanks!

 I’ve just setup my first org-mode file and in it I have a hierarchy of headings as follows: Area -> Project -> Task
 Each of the levels above have unique keywords. 
 Now when it comes to agenda views is it possible to only show tasks whose parent (project) has a particular TODO keyword as well as having a particular keyword themselves. 
 For example only show “NEXT” tasks for “CURRENT” projects?
 I’m sure that there must be a way to do this, but my searches have been fruitless - I’m guessing that I’m not using the correct terminology. 
 Thanks in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently I read the ACM Queue article titled "Schrodinger's code" concerning undefined behaviors in C so I started to wonder if Haskell has them and how many.
 So quickly I found that obviously Haskell does have them here and there. There are a bunch of unsafe functions, and FFI, etc.
 What baffles me, however, is that C compilers work on the assumption that paths contain UBs are not reachable so the compilers can aggressively remove code paths and optimize code. I personally think this means (if Haskell did the same) all code paths containing bottom values are removed. This actually makes sense in a non-strict language, because the semantics of the remaining parts remain unchanged.
 Therefore, I'm asking here the question, how well do bottom values relate to UBs (or LLVM undef?) My knowledge about Haskell is still limited so maybe this similarity is just superficial and there's no serious conclusion can be drawn here.
 Another question is: will GHC actually do the same kind of optimizations? If yes, how are they justified? If no, why not? I once encountered <<loop>> (my intent was exactly making it loop). But for other scenarios the bottom values seem to be preserved, and they are even used to cancel tasks (async exceptions).
 edit: The last question is baffling me. If the bottom value can be somehow "caught" like exceptions, are they really bottom values?

 The official faq also recommends to install only packages that we can trust.
 I don't know how much of this is still relevant, but I was wondering if any of you for programming use Emacs vanilla as it is without third party packages or do you limit yourself to some of them and which ones would you recommend? 
 I'm asking especially to those who don't have time to always review every update and have to weigh the risks.

So, I have been intrigued by the ideas of both Zettelkasten and commonplace books for a while now, and I am trying to find a synthesis that fits my needs. First, I will give some definitions and differences according to my understanding.
A Zettelkasten is a place to not just store thoughts from other people, but to process them in your own words. The key thing here is linking the notes together to make an idea-generating resource. This can be accomplished with tags and with more direct internal links. Another important aspect is that the notes in the Zettelkasten, zettels, are atomic; that is, they are focused on one thing and one thing only. To summarize (at the risk of simplifying): A Zettelkasten is a network of interconnected, atomic ideas…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am a new user of emacs. I recently learned about emacs client-server model. So I am in doubt that my understanding might be wrong about this system. So I will try to explain what this client-server model is in terms of emacs and I seek suggestions from this community about the validity of my understanding.
 So client-server model is basically used for utilizing the same running instance of emacs instead of opening up a new session everytime. How emacs does this is it creates a emacs server instance which keeps running in the background . Now if I want to to do something with emacs by using that single instance running in the background I will do so by emacsclient binary. For example if I want to open a file in gui frame (emacsclient -c filename) emacsclient will direct the emacs server to do so. I can create many instances of emacsclient which will use the same emacs server instance that is running in the background. By doing so I can do things in one session. Avoid the time cost of starting up a whole new session and open files quickly. There are different switches for emacsclient and emacs server which one can utilize to use different features provided by both of them. 
 Thats it. This is my current understanding of emacs client-server model and how to use it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've just started using ebib and it's awesome. I'm blown away by it. But there's one tiny cosmetic thing I'd like to fix. I work with resources which often have latex symbols for accents and diacritics in their titles in bibtex files. For example `The Nya\={y}asu\={\d{t}}ras of Gau\d{t}ama'.
 I would like these to appear 'correctly' (rendered) in ebib's index window. Could I somehow render the latex to unicode or something, and display that correctly?
 If so, should I? Would this be preferable to just editting the titles to use proper unicode (which is supported by biblatex, and is feasible as there aren't too many)? I just want to know if anyone can think of pros/cons either way?
 Thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 One of the things I miss from living in a shell in a terminal emulator is the history.
 Now, the shell history was never perfect for me, while I loved being able to go back a year and find some obscure cURL/compilation command that I never noted down, I hated that there wasn't any nice metadata (working directory) associated with the commands.
 I was wondering if there's any emacs equivalent, that will keep history for any shell command functions (there's a lot, given that there are project/dired variants), but perhaps for more clever uses that I haven't thought of (eshell?)
 My question is: Does this thing already exist before I think about it myself, I think a pluggable framework would be the best approach probably.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was playing a bit with ZIO Stream and encountered few situation I'd like to clear up. Let's say we have:
 val text = "A B A B A " Stream .repeatEffectWith(ZIO.succeed(text), Schedule.recurs(1)) .tap(putStrLn(_)) .transduce(ZTransducer.splitOn(" ")) .tap(putStrLn(_)) .groupByKey(identity) { case (word, stream) => stream .tap(x => putStrLn("aggStreamBefore " + x)) .scan((0, word)){case (acc, _) => (acc._1 + 1, word)} .tap(x => putStrLn("aggStreamAfter " + x.toString)) } .tap(x => putStrLn(x.toString + "\n")) .runCollect .flatMap(chunk => putStrLn(chunk.mkString(", "))) .exitCode 
 ​
 A B A B A A B A B A aggStreamAfter (0,A) aggStreamAfter (0,B) (0,A) (0,B) aggStreamBefore A aggStreamBefore B A B A B A A B A B A aggStreamAfter (1,A) (1,A) aggStreamBefore A aggStreamAfter (2,A) (2,A) aggStreamBefore A aggStreamAfter (3,A) (3,A) aggStreamBefore A aggStreamAfter (4,A) (4,A) aggStreamBefore A aggStreamAfter (5,A) (5,A) aggStreamBefore A aggStreamAfter (6,A) (6,A) aggStreamAfter (1,B) (1,B) aggStreamBefore B aggStreamAfter (2,B) (2,B) aggStreamBefore B aggStreamAfter (3,B) (3,B) aggStreamBefore B aggStreamAfter (4,B) (4,B) (0,A), (0,B), (1,A), (2,A), (3,A), (4,A), (5,A), (6,A), (1,B), (2,B), (3,B), (4,B) 
  
Why do we see zero-size chunks? 
 Why are aggStreamBefore and aggStreamAfter out of order?
 Why do we see fewer aggStreamBefore operations than aggStreamAfter ?
 groupByKey is supposed tu run different groups on different fibers, but results don't seem to be intermingled...
 Why didn't the stream use the first A B A B A sequence, but started pulling another one?
 Bonus question - does FS2 have groupBy / groupByKey? I found some leftovers, but nothing besides that.

 I installed pdf-tools from Melpa with the command M-x package-install RET pdf-tools RET, and I believe it was successful.
 I then tried to open a PDF with "emacs some.pdf". It indicates pdf-tools has been launched but it does not show an image of the PDF. It shows the underlying PDF code, I believe.
 I am using Termux, a terminal emulator app. Is this because pdf-tools only works in a GUI environment, in Linux? Or is there something else I should do to make it work?
 Thanks very much.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm tinkering with "full stack". As far as possible, I'd like things type safe, as a big fan of how much work the compiler does on my behalf. I'm some distance from guru-dom, so I'm half pattern matching things I've pieced together over time. So far, I've got:
 - Cask on the back (no complicated effect frameworks for me!)
 - Laminar on the front
 Where I'm struggling, is joining them up. The idiom I'm following separates the definition of the API from it's implementation,.
 trait TodoApi {def listAll: Future[Either[String, Seq[Todos]]]} 
 But this can fail in two ways
  
Network
 Json parsing
  
I wanted to use upickle and sttp. Both look simple enough, and should both work back and frontend ... helpful for me to learn fewer frameworks.
 def listAll1: Future[Response[Either[String,Try[Seq[Todos]]]]] = { basicRequest.get(uri"$ApiHost/todo") .mapResponseRight(r => Try(read[Seq[Todos]](r))).send() } 
 But look at the method signature! So okay...
 object ToDoApiImpl extends TodoApi { def flattenFutureEitherTry[A](a: Future[Response[Either[String,Try[A]]]]) : Future[Either[String, A]] = { for (fut <- a) yield { fut.body match { case Left(value) => Left(value) case Right(value) => { val something = value.toEither something.left.map(_.toString()) } } } } } override def listAll: Future[Either[String,Seq[Todos]]] = flattenFutureEitherTry(listAll1) } 
 Somehow, this feels... not right. It took me quite some time poking that with a sharp stick to get it to compile. And my eyeballs hurt :-(.
 Does anyone have suggestions for something more idiomatic / easier? I get that networking isn't fun, but is this as good as it gets? Suggestions welcomed...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi!
 I have been looking for a way to move as efficiently as I do in vim in emacs. In vim, I usually use the relative line numberings to do my movements. This causes issues with folded items in org-mode. Let me illustrate.
 I have the following org file:
 1 I want to 1 2 * Jump over 3 ** this 4 * to here 5 * without overshoot 
 To go to where I want, I'd do 4j in vim, and C-u 4 C-n in emacs. However, when I fold "Jump over", I get differing line numberings.
 In vim:
 1 I want to 1 2 +-- 2 lines: * Jump over ......... 3 * to here 4 * without overshoot 
 But in emacs:
 1 I want to 1 2 * Jump over... 4 * to here 5 * without overshoot 
 In vim, 3j takes me where I want. In emacs, C-u 4 C-n, as hinted by the numbering, results in overshoot.
 From my search (e.g. here https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/6i8nu3/question_for_evilmode_users_folding_and_relative/) the vim behavior has not been possible in emacs. Is this still the case?
 This type of movement is very fundamental for my workflow, especially when programming with my voice (being able to say "one four dip just" to delete 14 lines down, for example).
 Is there any way to achieve equally efficient vertical movement in emacs?

 I currently maintain my SQL notes (for example) in a .txt file. (Yes, I'm on Windows).
 For this, I manually maintain a TOC on top of the file. Actually this is more like an index, because it is sorted alphabetically. Each title is followed by some sort of unique code, that links to the actual note further in the same .txt file. When I need to lookup something, I lookup the topic in the TOC, select the unique code it and then do a find for that code. This is indeed a primitive system, but it works with any text editor.
 But lately I discovered (Doom) emacs and org-mode and I want to move my notes to emacs. I'd like to auto generate the TOC and sort it alphabetically. I found the package toc-org but as far as can see the TOC is not sorted. 
 How do you keep notes and navigate to in org mode ? (I'm a newbie so this could be a silly question)
 Thanks for your input !

 First, I ran counsel-describe-bindings to see what C-c C-l invokes. When I found out it is the org-insert-link function, I tried to look at its documentation via counsel-describe-function. My initial guess was that you can invoke it via a prefix. But no luck.
 After some Googling around, I found out that you need to use the read-file-name function. However, when I tried to find this function in the org-insert-link source code, it is not there. So my question is how can I make this connection?
 Do I have to just try my luck and search for something remotely relatable to what I'm looking for?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 in one of my project, I need to do some manipulation and transformation of Haskell source code files and AFAIK ghc-exactprint is the right tool for that. Unfortunately I have zero experience with this one, there seems not to be any more detailed documentation/tutorial examples. What is the best way how to learn this library? Can you recommend any sources?
 Thank you.

 The type Result is an instance of the Testable class, so properties retuning a Result can be tested by quickCheck.
 I have a property that I would like to test, but it happens to return an Effect Result instead of a pure Result, mainly because it does some debug logging to the console.
 someProperty :: String -> Effect Result 
 It is possible to test this property using quickCheck anyway?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lately I've been test driving Fedora Silverblue, an emerging distribution where the root filesystem is read-only and everything is done with Flatpaks and containers. So far it's pretty cool.
 If you aren't familiar with toolbox it's a nice wrapper around Podman that makes working with ad-hoc containers super easy.
 I have emacs in a flatpak and a toolbox with my C development environment installed. My goal was to hook them together so that I could use Eglot to develop C programs like I normally do.
 There's the docker-tramp project but this didn't work right for me... not sure what the issue was. The wonderful emacs wiki has a page on Tramp and Docker with some example code. So, I took it and modified it to use toolbox:
 (push (cons "toolbox" '((tramp-login-program "flatpak-spawn --host toolbox") (tramp-login-args (("enter" "-c") ("%h"))) (tramp-remote-shell "/bin/sh") (tramp-remote-shell-args ("-i") ("-c")))) tramp-methods) 
 Now I can C-x C-f /toolbox:fedora-toolbox-34: and open any file from inside the toolbox environment. I installed ccls in the toolbox and then Eglot was up and running. How about vterm-toggle? Like a charm... dropped me directly into a shell. Super cool.
 It seems like a few flaming hoops to jump through, and it's not a wrong assessment either. But when it's all working it's completely transparent and quite amazing, considering that Emacs and the development tools are running in different containers. Neat!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey there,
 Just started a new job doing support for a cybersecurity firm, and there is a ton of log searching involved.
 Basically, I'll have to rip through logs to figure out what certain parameters exist in a client's environment based upon a support packet that they send.
 This involves Docker, Ansible, Python 3, CentOS, etc.
 My last job involved examining logs sometimes but not all the time, so naturally I used Emacs via Swiper. I never did really get to the point where I felt comfortable looking through logs though. I would often use "Ediff" to compare two files, and take screenshots for Zendesk, but nothing too fancy.
 This time around though, its a bit more involved so I'm asking for some Emacs Wizards to help me find some suitable new packages to pump my config with.
 This being noted, I have to use GCP (Google Cloud Provider) to then SSH into a related sandbox environment. On that note, can Tramp be used in that scenario to make those two hops (aka to a GCP box, and then to an ssh box?)
 ​
 For the main topic though, does anyone have any good ideas on any packages that are great at grepping through a bunch of logs, and also how to re-direct anything that's found into separate files? 
 ​
 So far though, I've been able to connect through 'ansi-term' just fine but would love to somehow take that same terminal connection and do some more crazy Emacs stuff with it. 
 ​
 Very curious to see what people have in mind. The only thing I could think of is to maybe use Sunrise Commander instead of Dired :)

Basically upon launching, emacs adjusts to whatever monitor is set as the main one and becomes blurry if you drag it to another monitor. The issue exists on both 27.2 (downloaded from GNU ftp) and compiled master from like 10 days ago or so. Also, emacs only ever launches on the main monitor, it doesn't remember the last monitor it was used on as most other apps.
 Is there a way to make at least scaling work properly again? I don't think emacs ever remembered the monitor it was last open on. Pls don't suggest wsl emacs, I need native one 
 UPD: I just realized that emacs.exe (the one that opens both window and a terminal) is blurry on one monitor and good on the other one, and runemacs.exe is vise versa - it's blurry on the monitor where emacs.exe is not blurry, and it's crystal clear on the monitor where emacs.exe is blurry.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone
 I'm sort of a Haskell noob, and I'm writing my thesis in Haskell. This is the first "real" project I've ever done so please bear with me if I sound stupid.
 Anyway, I'm almost at the end of the project. I have a function that opens a file, does some things to it, and then returns a result. I'm working with about 500000 files, so I thought I'd add parallelism to speed it up. I read some about parallelism in Haskell but still don't understand it very well. However, that's not important.
 My original sequential routine looks like this:
 openGetListResults :: [String] -> IO String openGetListResults [] = do return "" openGetListResults (p:rest) = do resP <- openGetProgramResult p resL <- openGetListResults rest return (resP ++ resL) 
 It works fine.I found the Control.Monad.Parallel module online and thought I could use it to speed it up. I came up with the following:
 pOpenExecuteListPrograms :: [String] -> IO [String] pOpenExecuteListPrograms l = do list <- P.mapM openGetProgramResult l return list 
 I know the return types are different but that doesn't really matter right now. The parallel version also works fine.
 I compiled the program with -threaded and -O2. I ran it with +RTS -N -s for both versions and got the following results.
 For the parallel version:
 Parallel version
 For the sequential version
 sequential version
 So the parallel version is way faster. However, it did not start any sparks. My understanding from Haskell parallelism is that sparks are like mini threads, so if it's doing parallel work, it should be using sparks no?
 Could anyone explain what is happening here? Thank you so much, hope this kind of question is allowed.
 ​
 Edit: Wrong link for Monad.Parallel

 > sbt run 
 I'd like to be able to distribute the "build" and run it elsewhere.
 To do so, I ran the following from within the project's directory
 project> sbt compile ... [success] Total time: 1 s, completed Jun 9, 2021 11:10:49 AM project> sbt package ... [success] Total time: 1 s, completed Jun 9, 2021 11:11:31 AM 
 I copied these files and folders:
 project> cp ./target/scala/*.jar ~/app/target/scala-2.12 project> cp -r ./project/build.properties ~/app/project/ 
 When I try to run the application, I get an error:
 app> sbt run [info] Loading project definition from ~/app/project [info] Updating ProjectRef(uri("file:~/app/project/"), "app-build")... [info] Done updating. [info] Set current project to app (in build file:~/app/) [info] Updating ... [info] Done updating. [info] Packaging ~/app/target/scala-2.12/app_2.12-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar ... [info] Done packaging.

 It appears that sbt creates a second JAR (app_2.12-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar) for some reason.
 Which file or files am I missing?

 The link at the top of page here, references the github repo : https://github.com/WebFreak001/code-debug which isnt the same thing as installed by vscode or by running dap-gdb-lldb-setup . Indeed this link points to a codebase using .ts files in different locations to the VSCode extension installed .js files. (I did set up the dap program/path variables to use the .ts files but that didnt work)
 (Side note : Debian doesnt ship with lldb-mi which is required for the lldb portion to work so I compiled that from source but still no joy. )
 Anway, before I go any further, does anyone have the "Native" working with gdb or lldb to debug C++? If so, then I can chalk it up to me doing something wrong and try to correct it and will provide more details.

 In the last years I learnt Elm and Idris and now I am evaluating Purescript for the somewhat complex long project of creating a minimalistic programming language with its respective IDE and compiler. I would like to know your general opinions in how does compare PS with Elm and Idris for complex projects, specially whether it is worth for the mid long run (for example a small SPA might be done faster and easier with Elm).
 In one hand I felt Elm does an awesome job at the time of reducing the boilerplate and go to the point, however Evan’s focus is not always to keep a consistent programming language and I am afraid I would lack some abstractions at some point.
 Regarding Idris, it is totally the opposite direction from Elm, the compiler is immature and Idris 2 is just not ready. I like from dependent types that we can make a type dependent on a single attribute such as Matrixes with its dimensions and let the compiler verify that at compile time, however all that becomes messy when trying something beyond trivial examples. I believe that by using higher order types with purescript that’s possible as well, but I couldn’t find yet a working example (perhaps I should just try).
 Last but not least, a big missing in all the ML family is somewhat logic programming (or prolog dialect), so being not many kanrens for any of those I would believe all three are even in this aspect.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello there fellow devs,
 I want to share a small library I just published with you. Its called delegate-macro.
 It is a macro annotation to automatically delegate/proxy the implementation of an interface to a dependency. It has been super helpful to me when I have had to implement the "delegate pattern" for an interface with dozens of methods.Maybe you will also find it useful.
 I developed against Scala 2.
 edit:
 As u/agilesteel kindly pointed out below, unlike Scala2, Scala 3 has constructs to allow for this behaviour natively.

 Any feedback welcome,

 I use variable-pitch-mode for my org files. As a lot of people I configured my org mode in order to have some fixed-pitch in the table so that they are well aligned. This worked like a charm since today where I've inserted an org-ref citation inside a table. You can see below that the citation is made with some variable-pitch and that the table become not well aligned.

 Here is the part of my init.el regaring the fonts of orgmode:
 (defun david/org-font-setup () ;; Set faces for heading levels (dolist (face '((org-level-1 . 1.2) (org-level-2 . 1.1) (org-level-3 . 1.05) (org-level-4 . 1.0) (org-level-5 . 1.1) (org-level-6 . 1.1) (org-level-7 . 1.1) (org-level-8 . 1.1))) (set-face-attribute (car face) nil :font "Cantarell" :weight 'regular :height (cdr face))) (set-face-attribute 'org-block nil :foreground nil :inherit 'fixed-pitch) (set-face-attribute 'org-document-title nil :foreground nil :inherit 'fixed-pitch) (set-face-attribute 'org-formula nil :inherit 'fixed-pitch) ; (set-face-attribute 'org-indent nil :inherit 'fixed-pitch) (set-face-attribute 'org-block nil :inherit 'fixed-pitch) (set-face-attribute 'org-code nil :inherit '(shadow fixed-pitch)) (set-face-attribute 'org-table nil :inherit '(shadow fixed-pitch)) (set-face-attribute 'org-verbatim nil :inherit '(shadow fixed-pitch)) (set-face-attribute 'org-special-keyword nil :inherit '(font-lock-comment-face fixed-pitch)) (set-face-attribute 'org-meta-line nil :inherit '(font-lock-comment-face fixed-pitch)) (set-face-attribute 'org-checkbox nil :inherit 'fixed-pitch) (set-face-attribute 'line-number nil :inherit 'fixed-pitch) (set-face-attribute 'line-number-current-line nil :inherit 'fixed-pitch))

 ​
 I've got a mixed-language org-mode file that I use for pre-processing some data, and in the name of reproducibility (and portability), I'd like to be able to also run this pre-processing from outside of Emacs. My first thought was to add the `:tangle` argument to every code-chunk, then add a bash language chunk somewhere, set it up so that it fires off all of the tangle outputs in the correct order, and then instruct users to run the tangle output of said bash chunk.
 ​
 I don't like the degree of intervention that this requires though, since I imagine this will get annoying to maintain as I add more and more chunks to this file. Wondering if anybody has any wisdom on how to accomplish this.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to use an org-mode table with elisp formula containing a literal string like $s. But the $s seems to be interpreted as an org-mode constant. 
 Is there a nice way to "escape" this kind of behaviour?
 simple example
 Works
 #+begin_src elisp (format "(%2$s - %1$s) / %1$s" "x_1" "x_2") #+end_src #+RESULTS: : (x_2 - x_1) / x_1 
 Problem
 | fails | #ERROR | | works | (x_2 - x_1) / x_1 | #+TBLFM: @1$2='(format "(%2$s - %1$s) / %1$s" "x_1" "x_2")::@2$2='(format "(%s - %s) / %s" "x_2" "x_1" "x_1") 
 simpler example
 Works
 #+begin_src elisp (format "$s") #+end_src #+RESULTS: : $s 
 Problem
 | fails | #UNDEFINED_NAME | #+TBLFM: @1$2='(format "$s") 
 It seems that $s is trying to be expanded as a constant (even though it is in quotation marks - which could be useful in some cases, but causes problems here).

 A coworker is non-technical, but wants to clear things out regardless of the status. Getting them to use emacs will be beyond painful. We have a few SOPs and and excel file that we track. The person likes to take the shop as a grain of salt and customizes it. A hurdle my supervisor is dealing with. I have to fix the excel file a few times a month due to errors, so I fear the same if a spin up a new one.
 Any thoughts about what I can suggest?

 The code uses (kill-buffer buffer) when processing is done and if the file is already open I get a prompt, but I don't want that to happen because the script is supposed to be non-interactive and should avoid killing existing buffer.
 How do I check if the file is already open to avoid killing its buffer?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sorry to post again about this in such a short interval, but I'm hiring another Haskell dev for my team at Standard Chartered bank, this time in Singapore or Hong Kong.
 My team sits in front office and has about 20 Haskell devs (well, technically Mu, our in-house variant). We work in close collaboration with trading, sales, and structuring to build diverse software, from desktop GUI applications to server-side financial analytics reports and services. The current roles are at a relatively junior level -- 2 to 5 years industrial experience expected, or a relevant PhD.
 Feel free to reach out to me directly if you're interested and have any questions, but applications should go via the links below. To apply to the Singapore role go here: https://scb.taleo.net/careersection/ex/jobdetail.ftl?job=2100014272
 Or for Hong Kong: https://scb.taleo.net/careersection/ex/jobdetail.ftl?job=2100014571
 And the London role I posted before is still open: https://scb.taleo.net/careersection/ex/jobdetail.ftl?job=2100012204
 Standard Chartered supports (practically fully) remote working, but only from the country of payroll. We will cover visa and relocation costs for successful applicants.

 same on cabal.
 i don't really know what else to do, readme don't give a lot of troubleshooting steps, wiki is even worst.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone!
 I'm trying to change the background color for the gui version and would like it to use the same theme as my terminal (Alacritty).
 To do this I added:
 (set-background-color "#030c11")
 Keep in mind that I have only recently started using emacs and I don't know lisp much.
 Now when I open Emacs in my terminal (emacs -nw) the background color is not the intended one (#030c11) but the default one of the wombat theme which is grey. Emacs gui on the other hand displays my custom theme correctly.
 To work around this problem and have both versions with the same theme I configured my init.el in the following way:
 ```
 (load-theme 'wombat)
 (add-to-list 'default-frame-alist '(background-color . "0x030c11"))
 (add-to-list 'default-frame-alist '(foreground-color . "0xd3d0c8"))
 (set-background-color "#030c11")
 ```
 I don't know why but it's the only way to display the same background. After opening the gui version, the flip side of this is the following error reported below the mode line: undefined color: "undefined". It's not so annoying and it disappears after the first input but I'd like to fix it.
 Do you know how can I solve the theme conflict between the two versions or how to remove the error message as a work-around?
 My init.el: https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/jMDvYrTwNK/
 Thanks in advance!

 I know the keycodes. So the loadkeys part under Linux is ok. 
 I followed the articles on EmacsWiki. It helped me setup the various keys that otherwise are not available. (loadkeys in Linux then input-decode-modmap in Emacs)
 But Super and Hyper are modifiers, not full key sequences. So I don't know what to do next. 
 There is something about C-x@ in Emacs but I can't find definitive information about that. 
 Any help appreciated
 Notes: * I am not talking about X terminals. * I am not asking about GUI version. * This is about emacs -nw on Linux tty console.

etc. For example, if I'm organizing my dotfiles in a literate config, I might want a set of scripts that are executed in order. 
 It would be nice to be able to reorder headings and have the tangled files reflect the heading order. That is, if I move the heading for 02-someothertask.sh above the one for 01-sometask.sh, I want the output tangled files to now be 01-someothertask.sh and 02-sometask.sh.
 Has anyone encountered this and come up with a good solution for it?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A common pattern you'll see in Scala libraries is applicably combining n-elements, each with a different type, to a Product or Tuple. For example:
 ​
 def combine[A, B, C](element1: A, element2: B)(combinator: (A, B) => C) = ... def combine[A, B, C, D](element1: A, element2: B, element3: C)(combinator: (A, B, C) => D) = ... def combine[A, B, C, D, E](element1: A, element2: B, element3: C, element4: D)(combinator: (A, B, C, D) => CE = ...``` 
 Is there some syntax sugar/technique to simplify this in Scala 3? Perhaps with Type Lambdas?

 A displays the buffer of my code in Python mode. B displays the buffer of the console python. C displays the buffer of an org document.
 When I C-c C-c in A, (execute the code in the console) C now displays the code. So the final situation is :

 I setup company-mode and it's background color was similar to my theme's color. So I wanted to change the background. I installed company-box with :
 (use-package company-box
 :hook (company-mode . company-box-mode))
 But when I did that company mode changed it's color to white.

 I tried all the methods but couldn't figure out a way to change it's background color. None of the answers worked for me.
 I also want to change font and it's color.

https://thesweetsetup.com/the-art-of-note-making/
If anyone does read through it and his examples, or if anyone has read some of the "Linking your Thinking" materials, do you consider his term "Map of Content" to be the same (or perhaps similar but not exactly the same) as the way the term "Structure Note" is often used in this forum?
I like the distinction Mike Schmitz makes between:
Things I may need to reference
Tasks I will need to do
Ideas I want to develop

My research area is machine learning. My first zettel was 02/23/2020 and most of them focus on my research area or research in general. Throughout my life I have read many books, but I remember little about them. For instance, I say books like "The Double Helix" or "The Art of Learning" made a big impact on me, but outside of a few anecdotes, I remember nothing. More than that, I have no notes to go back and refer to.  My plan this year was to change this and systematically process any book I read.
The first book happened to be "Team of Rivals". My first zettel was on 02/06/2021. At the time I had approximately 430 zettels.

 This one is for the users of org-super-agenda. I have some views defined as follows:
 (use-package! org-super-agenda :after org-agenda :init (setq org-agenda-custom-commands '( ("T" "triage" ((todo "" ((org-agenda-overriding-header "") (org-super-agenda-groups '((:name "Triaged tasks" :tag "triage" :order 0) (:name "Confirmed" :discard (:anything t) :order 1))))))) ("A" "agenda" ((agenda "" ((org-super-agenda-groups '((:name "Closed" :log t :order 5) (:name "Deadlines" :deadline future :order 3) (:name "Agenda" :time-grid t :order 0) (:name "Chores/Habits" :habit t :order 4) (:name "Important tasks" :priority "A" :order 1) (:name "Other tasks" :priority<= "B" :order 2))))))))) :config (org-super-agenda-mode)) 
 The first is to see tasks which are tagged :triage:, and the second for my agenda. The "agenda" view works very well. However, here's the issue. In the "triage" view, I can only see one task! If I mark that as done, I see another one. I don't understand why I can only see one task at a time. Any idea why? Any tips/suggestions are greatly appreciated. Cheers !

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am an evil user. I was dissatisfied with evils jumping mechanism because I couldn't figure out how to control what commands set jump points, and therefore couldn't get my jumping to feel predictable. I thought I would share what I have come up with because it is working very nicely for me. 
 Please check out better-jumper.
 (use-package better-jumper :custom ; this is the key to avoiding conflict with evils jumping stuff (better-jumper-use-evil-jump-advice nil) :config (better-jumper-mode 1) ; this lets me toggle between two points. (adapted from evil-jump-backward-swap) (evil-define-motion better-jumper-toggle (count) (let ((pnt (point))) (better-jumper-jump-backward) (better-jumper-set-jump pnt))) ; this is the key here. This advice makes it so you only set a jump point ; if you move more than one line with whatever command you call. For example ; if you add this advice around evil-next-line, you will set a jump point ; if you do 10 j, but not if you just hit j. I did not write this code, I ; I found it a while back and updated it to work with better-jumper. (defun my-jump-advice (oldfun &rest args) (let ((old-pos (point))) (apply oldfun args) (when (> (abs (- (line-number-at-pos old-pos) (line-number-at-pos (point)))) 1) (save-excursion (goto-char old-pos) (better-jumper-set-jump))))) ; jump scenarios (advice-add 'evil-next-line :around #'my-jump-advice) (advice-add 'evil-previous-line :around #'my-jump-advice) (advice-add 'helm-swoop :around #'my-jump-advice) (advice-add 'evil-goto-definition :around #'my-jump-advice) (advice-add 'evil-goto-mark :around #'my-jump-advice)) ; ... whenever you want a new jump scenario just use the above pattern. 
 From here just add keybindings for better-jumper-toggle, better-jumper-jump-forward, and better-jumper-jump-backward.
 If you have ways to improve this let me know.
 Hopefully somebody can get some use out of this.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I'm very much an Emacs noob so please excuse my basic understanding of this. Not a computer science guy, but also trying to learn Linux at the same time.
 I'm trying to configure Emacs for python development. All of the lsp and development environment tools are installed and working fine, my question is about code execution. 
 I want to write to bash (Konsole?) and ask it to interpret the .py file. I know I can use M-x shell, but I have seen online that this invokes a "subshell" within Emacs. My worry is that any python I run through this subshell is limited to a single CPU as Emacs is not multithreaded, and my python project needs all of the compute resource available. 
 Does that concern even make sense? Should I looks towards using M-x term instead? Apologies if not enough info, would be happy to clarify anything you want to know, just not sure what's relevant.
 tl;dr 
 Can I execute python files while in Emacs without having the execution be limited to a single CPU due to Emacs' lack of multithreading?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I wonder if there is a simple solution to have a UI to navigate packages information with straight.el. It is mentioned in the README from straight that
  
any UI is provided by the user's completing-read framework
  
I would love to see examples of it ! (or build it myself)
 ​
 I tried something myself using marginalia and the metadata provided by package.el. I added this to to my init to associate the recipe keyword with package annotation :
 (add-to-list 'marginalia-prompt-categories '("\\<recipe\\>" . package)) 
 But I also have to (package-initialize) somewhere in my init since marginalia-annotate-package relies on package-alist and package-archive-contents. 
 ​
 Of course its a far from ideal solution. It doesn't work for all recipes, relies on package.el and doesn't inform about the current status of installed packages. For a proper solution, I think one could reuse part of the mechanism package.el uses to get packages information like package-load-descriptor, combine it with information from straight and finally add information provided by git for each repo.
 ​
 Does anyone know about packages or obscure init files that go in this direction ?

 First, I'm far from a soccer fan and most probably won't watch a single game within the upcoming weeks.
 However, for small-talk and event organization reasons, it's handy to have the games on my agenda.
 I converted the game schedule to Org mode format, assuming two hours per game. Since there might be a few Orgers out there who could profit from this task, you might want to check out https://pad.graz.social/p/EUROrg2020 and even maintain the schedule after the group stage where there are placeholders for now. The pad is writeable to everybody.
 If somebody should mess up pad content somehow, please use the timeslider button on the upper right corner (the fifth icon from right) to get back to the previous versions.
 Have fun

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I tried to setup dap for my c/c++ project. So i created a bare minimal c test project that i compiled it like this:
 clang -o main main.c 
 I installed dap and lsp like this in my init.el:
  (setq dap-lldb-debug-program '("/usr/bin/lldb-vscode")) (straight-use-package 'dap-mode) (use-package lsp-mode :init ;; set prefix for lsp-command-keymap (few alternatives - "C-l", "C-c l") (setq lsp-keymap-prefix "C-c l") (setq dap-auto-configure-features '(sessions locals controls tooltip)) (setq dap-print-io t) :hook ((c-mode . lsp) (lsp-mode . lsp-enable-which-key-integration)) :hook ((c++-mode . lsp) (lsp-mode . lsp-enable-which-key-integration)) :straight (lsp-mode :type git :host github :repo "emacs-lsp/lsp-mode") :bind (:map global-map ("C-c d" . dap-debug)) :config (require 'dap-lldb)) (require 'lsp-mode) (setq lsp-ui-doc-enable t) (straight-use-package 'lsp-ui) 
 I set breakpoints in lines: 5, 11, 13 of sample project. Also created a file called: launch.json.
 And also generated a file called compile_commands.json with this command:
 clang++ -MJ main.o.json -Wall -std=c++11 -o main.o -c main.c 
 And start debugging with dap-debug and select my own configuration template(Test dap-lldb).
 The application runs without stopping at breakpoints.(Though it generates weird output) I just see the output message that print numbers.
 Am i missing some configurations?
 Edit: I've noticed that when start lsp_server and dap_server, some files generate automatically. like: *clangd::stderr* Or *Flaymake log*

I'm looking through the source of org-capture but I can't decipher where these special buffers are being triggered.
 If anyone can point me in the right direction, I'd be appreciative. Thanks!

The fact that it updates the buffer after staging selective hunk region is mindblowing. How much care that the author has put into this. Fucking love it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I found a post by Sacha Chua about how she used Org to manage her grocery lists, and I want to do something sort of similar. I have an org file with recipes as headings, and immediately beneath each heading is the ingredients list as a table, followed by a list of instructions. I want to go through each week and pick an arbitrary number of recipes to cook by toggling a todo state on the heading. I want to write a function to concatenate all of the ingredients tables from the recipes I select for the week. I think I want to do something like this:
 (org-element-map (org-element-parse-buffer 'element) 'table (lambda (table) (when (string= (org-element-property :status table) "MAKE") ...code to concat table...))) 
 The missing piece with this idea is that I don't want to set a table property manually, but I also don't know how to set a property on a table based on the parent heading's todo state. Todo state triggers weren't meant for this it seems. I'm reading the documentation of course, but it's a little slow-going and I'm not that familiar with all of Org's built-in functions that might help with something like this. And this might not even be a great approach! So does anyone have recommendations on things to investigate or an alternative approach?

 Remaining in the Coursera specialization is Parallel Programming, Spark, and a Capstone project.
 After I complete the specialization, I am wondering what to focus on next.
 I think I will take this course which will uses Akka.
 If I learn Akka through this course, should I then learn a Typelevel framework/ library like Cats? Or is it better to just focus on Akka? I know this depends on the employer, but unsure where to focus my energy after learning base Scala.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the past, scientists have developed a number of impressive theories. In the case of Luhmann, we have a detailed picture of one of the crucial tools he used, this tool has been made very explicit to a degree that anyone can use it, and this tool is largely uncoupled from the individual knowledge and the cognitive skills of its users. For other scientific breakthroughs, some of them perhaps even more impressive than Luhmann's theories, we seem to know little about what methods led to these breakthroughs.
I wonder what we could develop from this perspective - what, if any, explicit, transferable methods and tools can we extract from the works of physicists, philosophers or mathematicians? How can we combine these tools with practices from the ZK universe?
As far as I know, most breakthrough ideas in science and elsewhere were made without the use of a ZK - so people have used other ways to create great ideas, and it would be foolish to narrow our view on ZK-based work only.
To me, in most of the forum discussions we have a dominant focus on "literature-driven" ZK work - people read, write zettels, enrich them with their own thoughts and link them to other zettels. On the other hand I suspect that a huge part of people's crucial relevant work in life is "problem-driven". I'm convinced that many writers in this forum use their ZKs for this purpose, but postings about how to start thinking about a topic, how to formulate problems, how to ask questions, how to generate ideas, how to discard approaches in the ZK framework seem to me underrepresented, given their importance for creative work.]]></summary>

 For context, I'm an Ethereum community member and investor. Recently, a world expert in Ethereum's proof of stake told me that it would be valuable if an independent party were to develop a non-production implementation of the eth2 spec to be used as a quality control mechanism against the four production clients that are live today.
 Please see the eth2 specs repo https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs

Although I'm quite happy with my workflow on my iMac I'm having a hard time making a good workflow for creating zettels on my iPad. That's why I'm looking for help.
I've been trying to populate some front matter on a new note using this iOS shortcut for iAWriter: https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/05a688e941954398aafab768f75966fc. The shortcut adds a filename following the convention used by The Archive and adds title, date, and tags. The problem is that it works sometimes while fails most of the time for no apparent reason.
As you can see image 1 (sucessful-shortcut.png) shows how it looks when the shortcut properly works, and image 2 (fail-shortcut.png) shows when it fails.



Do you have any insight into what's happening? If you use iA Writer, is there another way to add a front matter to a new note on iPad (other than manually)?
A simple workflow is really important for me to work with The Archive and iA Writer on the iPad, so if you have figured this out I'd love to learn from you. Thank you, André.]]></summary>

 How might you seasoned elisp-ers go about this? Is font-lock mode the right way to do it? Should I consider another way? Are there any guides you might recommend that would help me out on this journey?

 It seems that dired-mode is active when editing a file from the filesystem.
 Are there any other such modes?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last year I started using Spacemacs on evil mode because it was recommended not because I have been using vim or something, then around February this year I moved to original Emacs because I faced some issues on Spacemacs and I would almost always find a fix for Emacs but not Spacemacs, the transition phase didn't last very long as I learned how to make Emacs feel almost like Spacemacs.
 Lately I've noticed that I would have to use some of the Emacs keybinding even on evil mode and this is really annoying me, I was thinking that maybe if I learned Emacs keybindings it would've been much better.
 So my question is as the title says, and if anyone has good resources for learning Emacs keybindings for in case I end up going that way I would be very grateful.

 use case:
  
I have a notes.tex with literature review.
 when I start writing I often put lots of comments about relating ideas and reference sources.
 In those comments I started putting buttons to the notes file where the relevant information is.
  
It works like a org-link but for tex files.
 Hyperbole stores a .hypb with the linking information.
 Any other ideas or alternatives?

Some of my random thoughts
Reading print is more time efficient in itself.
Saving time via the habit of reading digitally comes from more efficient workflows surrounding the pure reading (e.g. extracting your highlights all at once)
The faster you read the better is your comprehension if the reading speed comes natural and you don't overpush yourself by some (not working) speed reading techniques oder overestimating your abilities.]]></summary>

 I think the link explains the trouble. The compiler can't find implicit Writer for Thing, which makes sense, but I can't have Thing derive Writer since it's just a trait. What's the correct approach to solve this for Scala 3?

 My problem is have some advices on some org functions which may not work with the latest versions and I will have to revert to the current one until I can patch them.
 If things don't work is it a simple matter changing the load-path to the older version or reinstalling it in the package-list-packages page?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So my company runs its own JIRA servers internally. I've been trying to get Org-JIRA to work today with no luck. I've looked at the solutions that other people used, but none of it has worked out for me yet. 
 (Namely: https://github.com/ahungry/org-jira/issues/21 and https://github.com/ahungry/org-jira/issues/186)
 I've noticed that if I use the constructed curl command with my username and password manually, I get what I *think* is a valid response. Otherwise, I see this X-AUSERNAME: anonymous in the messages. I tried creating a .authinfo file, but it changes nothing. Org-JIRA only asked my for my credentials once and never again.
 Internally, I use either a login/password or SSO to log in, but it doesn't look like our system has the same API token functionality that the Atlassian site does. I tried finding the cloud.session.token to use with the authorization workaround, but nothing that I did surfaced it. I'm not really a web guy, so I was just making some stabs in the dark.
 This is all on Windows; I'm not sure to what extent that makes a difference, but I've seen problems with that in the last few days in other packages. 
 Anyone else have anything else I can try?

I was struck by an idea, "What if...?" not fully formed but enough to continue to bounce back and forth between my ears. The idea originally was, "Wouldn't be interesting to know how many times a person was mentioned in my archive?" Then it quickly morphed with, "What if there was more than one person I'd like to know how many times they were mentioned? What if I wanted this list to be keep up to date, tracking progress over time?" And it has spread like head lice ever since.
You poor souls get to be the ones exposed to my attempts at learning to code. This is an experiment and my humble attempt at coding.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In my job I edit a lot of text files. Gvim has a lot of options that make editing text really fast. Like yyp to copy a line and paste it or * to automatically search for the word under the cursor. 
 I often end up with a lot of vim windows open that create a clutter. I also have a lot of projects to work on and I need some place to keep my notes for these and organize my tasks. I hear that managing such things with emacs should be easy with orgmode and that it should be able to match the text editing provided by vim.
 However most of the things I find are related to installing packages from the internet. At work I don't have the ability to install anything. For vim pluging i am able to copy the plugin and create the files manually. Is this possible to do in emacs? 
 Also any tips for switching to emacs? I feel a lot slower with emacs to switch and edit file even though I find things like file browsing directly from emacs is much nicer than what is in gvim.
 So can the vanilla emacs match gvim in terms of text editing, and are there any features which are possible in gvim but not in emacs?

If we have a list, we might very well want to get the first element in it. And indeed, the operation of “getting the first element of a list” isn’t impossible in Haskell, it just requires a little extra ceremony.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dear Orgers... :)
 In the org manual, "7.5.3 Capturing column view", in https://orgmode.org/manual/Capturing-column-view.html#Capturing-column-view says:
  
Since column view is just an overlay over a buffer, it cannot be exported or printed directly. If you want to capture a column view, use a ‘columnview’ dynamic block (see Dynamic Blocks). The frame of this block looks like this: 
 #+BEGIN: columnview :hlines 1 :id "label" 
 #+END: 
 This dynamic block has the following parameters: 
 ‘:id’ - This is the most important parameter. Column view is a feature that is often localized to a certain (sub)tree, and the capture block might be at a different location in the file. To identify the tree whose view to capture, you can use four values: 
 -- ‘local’ - Use the tree in which the capture block is located. 
 -- ‘global’ - Make a global view, including all headings in the file. 
 -- ‘file:FILENAME’ Run column view at the top of the FILENAME file. 
 -- ‘LABEL’ - Call column view in the tree that has an ‘ID’ property with the value LABEL. You can use M-x org-id-copy to create a globally unique ID for the current entry and copy it to the kill-ring.
  
Since the option for ‘LABEL’ says, "Call column view in the tree that has an ‘ID’ property...", my question is: how do you capture a column view that is in the same file, but another tree?
 For example
  
chapter 
 subtitle
 another subtitle that tries to capture the tree with logs
 
 another chapter 
 tree with logs (that can be seen as column-view)
 
  
As always, thank you very much for your generous help, time and attention... :)
 Best regards...

I recently created a theme for The Archive to suit my personal needs and I thought I'd publish it, in case somebody else finds it handy too:

I'd describe it as minimalist, high-contrast and equally suited for writing and coding (I store many code snippets in my Zettelkasten).
You can find it on Github: https://github.com/stephanbogner/the-coding-writer-theme
I also stumbled upon the "The Archive Userland Themes"-repository, so if there is any interest to add my theme to that, that would be cool too

But, there continues to be one lingering concern... that I am just collecting and not making any real use of my notes.
I do my best to take quick notes while reading, putting them into my own words before adding these ideas to my slip box and expanding on them... but even after that, it still feels like I am just creating collection of other people ideas.
This leads me to ask two questions. First, what are some strategies that you use to combat this? And, second is this sort of feeling fairly common as your system grows?]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In my init.el I need to define several functions that will return cons cells and the returned CDR depends on an argument to the function, like this:
 (defun foo1 (x) `(symbol1 . ,(+ 1 x))) (defun foo2 (x) `(symbol2 . ,(+ 1 x))) 
 (Context: I am defining several similar "style dispatchers" for orderless. My actual functions are a bit more complicated than this, but have a common structure.)
 I would like define a macro to build these functions for me. The naive thing to try is this:
 (defmacro build-it-1 (name symbol) `(defun ,name (x) `(,symbol . ,(+ 1 x)))) 
 But this gives
 (macroexpand '(build-it-1 foo1 sym1)) (defalias 'foo1 #'(lambda (x) `(,symbol \, (+ 1 x)))) 
 Oh, so the "inner" backquote control ,symbol and there is nothing to expand there.
 (But the \, is weird. What happened to my cons cell?)
 So, let's try this for the sake of the symbol:
 (defmacro build-it-2 (name symbol) `(defun ,name (x) ,`(symbol . ,(+ 1 x)))) (macroexpand '(build-it-2 foo1 sym1)) *** Debugger entered--Lisp error: (void-variable x) 
 OK. Now the symbol x is unquoted by the comma we just moved, so, uh, maybe this?
 (defmacro build-it-3 (name symbol) `(defun ,name (x) ,`(symbol . ,(+ 1 'x)))) (macroexpand '(build-it-3 foo1 sym1)) *** Debugger entered--Lisp error: (wrong-type-argument number-or-marker-p x) 
 Hmm. Elisp didn't like that.
 I suspect that it is possible to do what I want with some combination of comma, backquote, and quote. I've tried (more or less at random) various strings like ,`(+ 1 x) and ',`(+ 1 x) but I can't get what I want.
 What am I doing wrong?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sometimes I'd like to open a file in some chosen external application.
 For that I created Mediator, a very simple package which provides a simple open-with menu for Emacs.
 It can be used with Embark or with Ivy (including `all-the-icons-ivy-rich` support) actions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I went through some litterature and there they talk about overloading. 
 From what I understand Haskell does not support this in the most general sense, I can't declare two functions of the same name. I can only do such a thing if I declare a typeclass, correct? Then I can in that class declare a function that can take a multitude of different parameters, depending on what I'd want? 
 Some clarity on this would be greatly appreciated! :)

 My work around is to use the left arrow v$← to work around that but that feels like one key too many.
 Is there some other built-in for that, or is it Elisp time or macro time? I haven't got into macros yet.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[desktop-save-mode had caused me issues before because of different ways of starting Emacs :- command line "emacs", as a service ("systemctl --user enable Emacs") with the system starting it, as emacsclient (emacsclient -c ) or even from your own startup with something like "emacs --daemon". Anyway, this little snippet "works for me" and might be of interest to others. All self-contained in a use-package form. If starting as a daemon do the desktop read after the first frame is created, else do it immediately after emacs-startup-hook is triggered. The only thing that scuppered me a little was not checking the supplied emacs.service systemd config - it hardcodes the Emacs path, starting the wrong Emacs version and causing straight.el to recompile everything on startup : solution to that is copying /usr/lib/systemd/user/emacs.service to ~/.config/systemd/user and altering the paths to your own Emacs version (Debian paths there).
 The settings of desktop-save and desktop-path in combination with needing a desktop-read call are, on observation, what caused much confusion out there in google land. 
 Maybe not news to many, but I thought I'd share the snippet as googling showed it's still an issue for some.
 ​
  (use-package emacs :custom (desktop-path '("~/.emacs.d/var/desktop")) (desktop-save t) :init (defun rgr/restore-desktop() (when (fboundp 'alert) (alert (message (format "loading desktop from %s" desktop-path)))) ;;I include the run-with-timer despite being able to get this to work without as it's a timing ;;issue and a little delay does no one any harm (run-at-time "1" nil (lambda() (desktop-read) (desktop-save-mode 1)))) (add-hook 'emacs-startup-hook (lambda() (if (daemonp) (add-hook 'server-after-make-frame-hook 'rgr/restore-desktop) (rgr/restore-desktop)))))

Then I saw haskells partial application: let a = (1 +) and my mind was blown. Watched a few presentations and I’m convinced this is the language to learn. I gotta learn this language. It appears it’s not really a ‘step 1 = toy example first’ kinda language instead i need to study up and grasp a lot before using Haskell in real life problems. So any advice ahead of my journey to learn Haskell? I just realise there are so many expert haskellers here would love any advice that makes the journey as useful as possible. Do you think I should start with some basic tutorials then project Euler (or something similar)? Or better getter some great big book and reading all the theory first?

 I forgot to include code, i also fixed some of the errors but i currently have "pattern match failure.." in line 13 (columns 11-57, which would be the whole line before "<-" part) and still nost sure about this api thing in line 15

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sorry for a weird title, I couldn't think of a way to word it neatly. 
 Anyways, I have been using company-mode for a while now, and it has worked perfectly for me. I recently switched to using evil mode and now when I type, the company mode box pops up, but it doesn't automatically put the cursor there. Instead I have to manually scroll down with C-n to get the a selection to the company mode box.
 I of course thought that it was an issue with evil mode, but nothing looks wrong to me. 
 Any suggestions of what could be the issue or any possible solution?

 Does Emacs have an option to check if a directory points to network share or a local directory?
 On Linux checking /etc/mtab is a possibility but I prefer something higher level that will work on Windows too.

In a current project, I want to be able to write long-form citations of the type that one frequently sees in humanities texts. What I mean are footnotes that may include multiple citations, and some additional analysis. Here's a random example:

 So what you have is a footnote with a citation in it, but also some text. Can you do this with org-ref?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am happy to announce the 1.0 release of TTC (Textual Type Classes).
 The library provides the following functionality:
  
The Textual type class is used to convert between common textual data types. It can be used to write functions that accept or return values of any of these textual data types.
 
The Render type class is used to render a value as text. Avoid bugs by only using Show for debugging/development purposes.
 
The Parse type class is used to parse a value from text. Unlike Read, it has support for error messages.
 
Validate constants at compile-time using Parse instances.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[First some context:
As I understand Luhmann workflow...
He put every interesting thoughts he have as a permanent note without worrying too much. (Like a skeptic tank)
His notes are really short (generally 1 to 3 sentences).
I see nobody else using the Zettelkasten in this way. Lot of people create longer notes and try to synthesize before putting the ideas into the system.
Last but not least: the system is created for academic research in mind.
My frictions:
1) When I think and want to create new notes... having to search existing notes in the Zettelkasten stops my thinking flow.
I am wondering if it’s not better to just create note without connection when I think... and only then look at the possible connections. But that will create a lot of duplicates.
Or thinking more deeply before putting the note and find the connections. (But I feel I don’t leverage the Zettelkasten fully by this way)
2) When I want to create a new content... going to the Zettelkasten kills my creative flow. As I am not creating academic content (but marketing content)... The most important in the content isn’t the information, but the emotion (you can only put emotion in a content with your first brain in a specific mood)
Because of this 2 things... I am wondering if a Zettelkasten is the best tool for me.
And if it is... I am wondering why only luhmann work in a very atomic way without bothering of the quality of the note. And why mainy people create longer note with digital zettelkasten.
My question:
I deliberately don’t ask a specific question because at this point, I don’t really know what is the good question to ask myself.
Maybe: How to determine the best way of organizing the process and scope of permanent notes ?
Thanks for reading.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to create a Mac installer for a project that uses the SDL2 library and a couple of extension libs.
 Currently when I build, things are linking against the libraries installed on my system via homebrew in /usr/local/opt/. However, when I package these libraries with my program they are not recognized as safe to run on others' systems, so in order to run my program a user has to go through a launch, crash, allow library to be run cycle for each of the libs I link against until everything is allowed. This is obviously a no-go from a user friendliness perspective.
 I figured if I could link against the Mac frameworks for the libs that they should be signed (as they've been released as frameworks) and the user would only have to go through this allow process for just my app executable (until I get it signed). However, I'm not sure how to link against the frameworks.
 I tried repointing the executable to the framework dylibs using the install_name_tool, but the versions differ between the homebrew and framework versions of the libs, which made my app not run -- I've since thought better of trying to use this method in case there were incompatibilities between the entry points of the lib versions.
 My next thought was that I would have to link to the frameworks at build-time, but adding the -framework ghc option when I run stack build doesn't seem to have any effect -- it still points to the homebrew versions. Maybe the Haskell bindings are set to point at the homebrew versions only?
 This is the first user-facing application I've developed on Mac, so I'm in a bit over my head. I'd like to have the standard DMG/drag-the-app-into-Applications installer for the app, as I don't know that homebrew would be the friendliest install method for my target audience.
 Any help or suggestions are appreciated!

 I just released a new chapter focusing on IO in my online course Foundations of FP in Scala https://www.fp-tower.com/courses/foundations
  
Includes 16 videos, around 4.5 hours in total.
 Lots of exercises, including a very realistic one where we implement a search flight aggregator similar to skyscanner
 We’ll cover features such as by-name parameters, lazy evaluation, dependency injection, and concurrency.
 We’ll study the differences between IO and Future extensively. 
 This chapter is a perfect introduction to cats-effect, Monix and ZIO.
  
Let me know if you have any questions!
