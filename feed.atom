Do you really need to go outside the Archive and use Obsidian , Roam , etc.  to develop a PKM for yourself?
How can you use a Zettelkasten  as a practical tool for doing something such as writing a book, studying for a test etc.  in other words.  Is the Zettelkasten more than a note taking method?

 You can find it here, or find it from the build artifact.
 The Emacs source code that&#39;s used to build this package is in this repo, straight from the master branch with a simple patch to allow to build on Windows.
 The scoop bucket for this package is https://github.com/kiennq/scoop-misc, you can just install the package with scoop install emacs-k

 Currently I am trying to decide on which library I want to use.
 An important aspect will be consistency within the app, meaning that e.g. the information about one video (e.g. how much of it has been watched) needs to be the same in every place in the app where it is displayed.
 Another example would be which video is part of which playlist. A playlist that is displayed in a side bar for example should automati…]]></summary>

I've been adding some notes that when I'm writing them, I have some "aha" moments or I know how they are related to to other notes, and then I remember that another note was related to this one, and so on. What I do is type [[]] and write in the omnibus the text of the note I'm searching, to copy the ID and paste it inside. It's a little time consuming and I was wondering if there is an easier way where the [[-type something-]] automatically prompts some suggestion after I type something inside.

 I&#39;m using &quot;M-x eval-buffer&quot; and emacs tells my I can use &quot;M-x ev-b&quot; instead. This looks like a 2nd shortcut but I&#39;ve never seen the &quot;ev-&quot; prefix before and can&#39;t guess what key it might be. There is no &quot;ev-b&quot; function I can find. I can find only passing references to it on the net and in this subreddit (nothing that tells me what it is or how to use it)
 Little help ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I wonder if there is a way to set an option (is that the right term?) to a multiline-string.
 What I mean is e.g. in org-reveal you can specify the title-page like this:
 &#x200B;
 #+REVEAL_TITLE_SLIDE: &lt;ul&gt; #+REVEAL_TITLE_SLIDE: &lt;li&gt;hubba #+REVEAL_TITLE_SLIDE: &lt;li&gt;hubba #+REVEAL_TITLE_SLIDE: &lt;/ul&gt; 
 So you repeat the REVAL_TITLE_SLIDE option for every line, but I would like to have something like this:
 #+REVEAL_TITLE_SLIDE: &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;hubba &lt;li&gt;hubba &lt;/ul&gt…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For internal links I use the org-id CUSTOM_ID format. It works great.
 Now I would like to find all entries that link to this node. Orgmode has the &quot;Find existing link to here&quot; function but that seems to ignore the id.
 Right now I&#39;m copying the ID to the kill-ring and do an org-agenda-search for this ID, but that is a bit complicated. Is there a way to do this elegantly with a single command?

This syntax has a lot of discussion
 Martin once said brace works pretty well .
 What is the consideration for adding such a controversial syntax now ?

 emacs noob here.
 When I create an url-link in orgmode it normally opens in my web-browser which most of the time is what I want.
 But sometimes it would be more convenient to open the link in a eww instead so what I would like to have is a new command that would split the windows and open a link in a new eww buffer.
 Could someone give me a hint on how to do that? 
 Many thanks!

Ad-hoc interpreters with capability by Gaël Deest &amp; Andreas Herrmann
The capability library is an alternative to the venerable mtl. It features a set of “mtl-style” type classes, representing effects, along with deriving combinators to define interpreters as type class instances.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The conventional wisdom of Zettelkasten is that it should be non-hierarchical. I am starting to think that it's well-intentioned, but misguided. In particular, it conflates storage and presentation. That is, you can have hierarchical storage, and still allow for non-hierarchical presentation.
For example, you can have the following file structure:

But still have the following view of it:

(okay you can't actually have that view of it since it's from The Archive, which doesn't read from subfolders... but it…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Our previous posts on computational pipelines, such as those introducing Funflow and Porcupine, show that Arrows are very useful for data science workflows.
They allow the construction of effectful and composable pipelines whose structure is known at compile time, which is not possible when using Monads.
However, Arrows may seem awkward to work with at first. For instance,
it’s not obvious how to use lenses to access record fields in Arrows.
My goal in this post is to show how lenses and other optics can be…]]></summary>
