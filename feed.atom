The hierarchical structure is not good enough for lists of data with multiple shared parts. I get lost in what is called a Wicked Problem [look it up on Wikipedia if you want] constantly almost always when I include another list, then I need to rearrange the contents of the lists for better comprehension and/or less clutter/repetitiveness.
 Hi, sorry if this seems simple to you, but I can't get my head around this so far. I've heard of something called orgmode roam or orgmode brain, but it seems that I am just stuck and constantly looking up more search results while not comprehending much of what i find really.
 ​
 I'd like some real world examples of how would you solve this problem preferably with emacs/org software if possible

 When I use org-cite-insert, I can see bib items in my minibuffer, and I can multi-select bib items with enter key. However, I do not know what key or keybind to press to actually insert the bib keys I have selected.
 My org-cite seems to be configured correctly, because if I just type by hand the citation [cite:@key], it fontifies alright. The only problem is, I do not know how to actually auto-insert such citations by org-cite-insert.
 I have consulted org manual, and also googled a lot, no solution so far. Any help on this?
 suggested solutions so far:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Until recently, my init.el basically just called org-babel-load-file on my literate configuration file. However, this led to slow startups and issues where the wrong version of Org was getting loaded; as such, I'm trying to move to tangling my config.org.
 As of now, I'm just setting :tangle yes :results silent as properties on my config.org as well as having a function on after-save-hook that checks if the file I just saved is my config, and if so, to tangle it to init.el.
 This doesn't feel particularly "tasteful" though, since it means that if I want to make my config easily clonable, I either have to:
  
Commit both my init.el and config.org to github (which will essentially be the same file), or
 
Upon cloning my config to a new machine, flounder around in stock Emacs before tangling my config manually (with an out-of-date, built-in ob-tangle) and restarting, instead of everything working out of the box.
 
 So, I thought I'd ask /r/emacs: what do you consider the most "canonical" or "tasteful" way of tangling a (single-file) literate config?

 I think org-mode with timestamps can achieve the same thing. For example,
 * Event 1 <2021-10-10 Sun 1:00-2:00> * Event 2 CLOSED: [2021-10-11 Mon 5:00] SCHEDULED: <2021-10-11 Mon 3:00> 
 the total time is 3 hours. Is there any simple way to do the calculation? I've searched for this but it seems there is no built-in function for this. Thanks.

But all these methods doesn't work for remote inline images, i.e. I can't control the image like this: [[https:example.com/image.png]].
 Here is an example:
 original
 show inline image in 20%, but the size of the first image is not changed

 So, anyone has any suggestions? How could we let org-mode resize the displayed remote inline images?

This advice is also present in the documentation for save-restriction. 
 While the book does give a one line explanation- "if save-restriction is used before save-excursion, Emacs may fail to record the narrowing in the buffer it switches to", I don't quite understand it.
 Can someone please explain this, preferably via an example where something goes wrong if I have save-restriction immediately followed by a save-excursion expression?

 That alone got me curious but I am comfortable in vscode at the moment. So, is there something that makes you not leave emacs for vscode? I know that there is a very nice git plugin (magit?) But other than that I haven't read anything else. Also I read that code completion and going to function definitions are not easy to do on emacs, which doesn't seem right considering how popular it is.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am trying to add a hook that will re-generate the latex fragments when I modify the zoom level in the org buffer.
 Here is my function:
 (defun update-org-latex-fragments () (let ((text-scale-factor (expt text-scale-mode-step text-scale-mode-amount))) (plist-put org-format-latex-options :scale (* 1.75 text-scale-factor)) (org-latex-preview t) )) (add-hook 'text-scale-mode-hook 'update-org-latex-fragments) (add-hook 'org-mode-hook 'update-org-latex-fragments) 
 It only works partially. The zoom level is adjusted only in the org section the cursor is currently in.
 From the org-latex-preview function I read that two universal arguments C-u C-u would rebuild the latex fragments everywhere in the buffer:
  
With a C-u C-u prefix argument ARG, display image for all fragments in the buffer.
 With a C-u C-u C-u prefix argument ARG, clear image for all fragments in the buffer.
  
How do I translate C-u C-u to elisp so that my hooked function regenerates the latex fragments in whole buffer?
 I do not think this matters, but just in case, I am using doom emacs.
 EDIT: Solved! Found the solution in this archived thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/67y5kj/what_is_cu_cu_cu_command_in_code/
  
Plain universal-argument actually creates a prefix-argument of '(4), and multiplies the car of the list by four with each iteration. So try doing (org-cycle '(64)).
 You'll need to look at the actual command's source each time to decide what exactly the function is expecting. Check out the doc-string of interactive for more info.
  
So I just added '(16) as an argument of the org-latex-preview function:
 (defun update-org-latex-fragments () (let ((text-scale-factor (expt text-scale-mode-step text-scale-mode-amount))) (plist-put org-format-latex-options :scale (* 1.75 text-scale-factor)) (org-latex-preview '(16)) )) (add-hook 'text-scale-mode-hook 'update-org-latex-fragments) (add-hook 'org-mode-hook 'update-org-latex-fragments)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The advice here does not work: https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/ShowParenMode
 If show-paren-mode is called anywhere then the show-paren-mode variable still set globally. If the variable is set then the parentheses do not highlight, so the mode isn't active (I assume).
 With this code, show-paren-mode is set on initial load:
 (use-package prog-mode :ensure nil ; not really a package :hook ((prog-mode . rainbow-delimiters-mode) (prog-mode . smartparens-mode) (prog-mode . local-show-paren-mode)) :config (defun local-show-paren-mode () (make-variable-buffer-local 'show-paren-mode) (show-paren-mode 1))) 
 I also tried calling `(make-variable-buffer-local 'show-paren-mode)` at top level. It's still global even though inspecting the variable, it calls itself buffer-local.
 I'm pretty sure it's actually still global because when I call M-x show-paren-mode and open another empty buffer, its state in the new buffer is the same as the old buffer. Going back to other buffers, the state likewise stays the same.

 I've built a docker image which asynchronously exports org files in the format requested. I started from this awesome example from emacs-web-server and added a file cache and pdf support. You can see it here: org-ssr
 As you might've already guessed, I'm going live with it. My blog is being served by emacs.
 That means if you ever have to wait a few seconds to see a page load, you are probably the first person to see that page in that format.
 It also means that with `url-handler-mode` enabled, you can browse to my site like `C-x C-f https://blog.tygr.info/index.org` to see the website in org mode.
 So now all pages on my blog are available as .html, .txt, .tex, or .org. As I mentioned, pdf is available but I don't have texlive installed on my server, so it'll just fail right now.
 And yes, I realize there's no favicon. I don't think there ever will be.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Greetings,
 Began to migration to org 9.5 today and with it to try to adapt the new citations system. I have run into two questions that someone may have the answers to.
  
Trying to use any processor other than 'basic' results in an error. For testing my configuration is very simple:
  
 (use-package org :demand t :pin gnu :config (setq org-cite-export-processors '((latex natbib) (t basic)))) 
 If I export to latex with this setup, it results in org-cite-store-export-processor: Unknown processor natbib error. Only basic works. The biblatex, natbib, and csl exporters all result in the same error. Is it really going to force me to perform a (require 'oc-xxx) for each of them?
  
The styles seem a bit limited to me. Is there an option to provide a reference in place without a bibliography? One common use case is produce a list of publications in a chosen order (e.g., NSF-style CVs require "Five relevant publications"). With latex, this is commonly done with \nobibliography and \bibentry. Unfortunately, I don't see support for either in the table provided in the very nice Introduction.
  
Is it possible to not insert a bibliography? It would make sense that if citations are used and exported to latex without the #+print_bibliography directive that it automatically inserts \nobibliography.
 For inserting references rather than citations, is there a style I am missing? It might make sense to have an r style that inserts the full reference in place (if exporting to latex, it would use \bibentry while basic would simply insert the reference text).
 Anyhow, I appreciate hearing whether I am missing something on these issues.

 When I open the file in the console section it tells me "Running atril [path-to-file]...done".

 Sometimes though, when I'm navigating to previous company completions, the "C-k" keypress will "fall through" and register as the evil digraph command instead of the company one, which drops me out of the completion I was in the middle of. I've only been able to reproduce this in go-mode while lsp-mode is on; I thought it might be a performance issue as a result of spamming the keypress too fast (I'm on a fairly weak VM), but I've occasionally been able to recreate it even when I'm leaving a solid 1 sec pause between "C-k" presses. Anyone got any idea how to debug this? It happens relatively frequently, but really inconsistently, so I'm having trouble reproducing it on command.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm reading (studying) the book "Scala with Cats". In the chapters on Functors, it includes a section on covariant functors.
 The book describes contravariant functors as "the ability to prepend a transformation to a context". What is meant by a "context"? All the examples show how, under certain circumstances, you can derive a type-class instance F[A] from F[B] if you have a function A => B. Unlike contravariant functors, covariant functors seem not operate on type-class instances, but on concrete data-types. Are covariant and contravariant functors in two distincly different categories? I "understand" covariant functors. How can I gain a better intuition of what a contravariant functor is?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During my recent studies into effective learning methods, the phenomena that food plays a major role in cognitive performance has surfaced. Some research observed differences in cognitive performance between 15-20% based on nutrition intake (high cal/protein/fat vs low). From my own experience, if I'm hungry I get distracted more often and find it harder to enter the flow state of work.
In How Not to Die, the author points to research that observed consumption of burgers/meat lead to a very noticeable decline in cognitive performance minutes after consumption.
In his essay writing guide, Jordan Peterson recommends eating something high in fat and protein first thing in the morning before writing. He also talks about the importance of waking up early & working in the morning. Peterson also said in another interview that he solved a clients anxiety problems by making her eat more. This suggests a link between not getting proper nutrition and anxiety.
The Netflix documentary "The Game Changers", Connor McGregor puts part of the blame of his loss on eating too much steak - not having energy during the fight. This documentary argues vegetable-based diets are just as effective for building muscle as meat ones, as well as being more healthy for anyone interested.
I haven't done much research into this question obviously 
My question(s) to you is: have you experimented with different foods and consumption schedules to boost your cognitive performance during knowledge work sessions? Do you know any interesting resources to continue this line of research?]]></summary>

What happens if the authors of the package get tired and abandon it? You could have a package that is a whole part of you work flow die ! This seems risky because you have no certitude if the packages come from random people."
 And I couldn't answer because I don't know if its common that a package is left to death by its authors, but my intuition was that other people would fork it and still contribute to it or just maintain it... any answer? I didn't say much to my friend because I don't really know and didn't want to say some dumb stuff.
 Thank you for reading!

 I’ve got the encryption working, and figured out how to get agenda items from said files into the agenda.
 My only issue is that I can’t seem to get full text search working.
 I’ve tried using the grep commands in Doom but they don’t seem to decrypt the files?
 The specific feature I’m trying to get working is Doom’s SPC n s which seems to be a function that calls ivy’s search for symbol at point?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A really helpful tool for maximizing keyboard efficiency QMK's layer feature, which allows you to hold down one key, and have different functionality for the other keys. Any key can be a layer.
 I was thinking that combining this functionality with something like ryo-modal could make for a very satisfying and efficient modal keybind system. However, it doesn't seem like there's any ready made way to do this in Emacs. 
 I think that the closest preexisting thing is Hydras, which basically are layers, except you have to define a keybind that exits the Hydra. 
 So the question is, how can I make the exit function for a Hydra be the releasing of its prefix key? I'm not sure if this is a simple or complicated elisp task, as I'm still pretty novice when it comes to Emacs hacking. Any help or insight would be appreciated!

 and that works in all programs it seems, including Emacs.
 Under Wayland, with Wayfire have

 In Emacs I'm told that <Multi_key> is undefined. All the instructions I've found tell me to add the file ~/.XCompose with the contents

 This looked very exciting, and would simplify many things related to record access.
 For example:

 <command line>: User-specified static library could not be loaded (/usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/10/libgcc.a) Loading static libraries is not supported in this configuration. 
 I use stack with LTS-18.12 and in the cabal file there is:
 extra-libraries: stdc++ gcc dl z pthread 
 The cabal settings are:
 extra-libraries: stdc++ gcc dl z pthread 
 and the ghc options are:
 ghc-options: -O0 -g2 -Wall -Wcompat -Widentities -Wincomplete-record-updates -Wincomplete-uni-patterns -Wredundant-constraints -Wpartial-fields -funbox-strict-fields -threaded -rtsopts 
 This is especially weird, as the exact same settings with the exact same stack LTS are in use in another project and there it works without the error. 
 I am a bit lost about what is happening/where to look at. Does somebody have an idea?

I don't think I'm incapable of understanding the concepts but everything just moves very fast and I'm left trying to cram and eventually understanding very little of what's going on.
 Maybe this is the wrong place to ask, but how do I efficiently catch up and grasp the concepts so I'm able to solve basic problems using things like list comprehension and recursion? My grade depends on this because it's based on the coursework we submit each week.

 Any help is appreciated :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently switched from package.el to straight.el, and was surprised by how smooth the transition was - everything worked out of the box and the changes to my config were super minimal.
 However, a couple days and a couple modifications to my config later, I noticed that org-related things were breaking. Checking load-history showed that nearly all the org.*.elc files that were getting loaded were from the built-in version of Org instead of the one cloned by straight. 
 Maybe I was just hallucinating that it was ever working: at least if that's the case, it provides a way for my best present theory to be true, which is that the built-in Org is getting loaded as a side-effect of me having a literate configuration. I printed the load-path variable at the beginning of my init.el file (which is basically just (org-babel-load-file "~/.emacs.d/config.org")), and the straight version of Org wasn't on the path yet. This has me thinking that when Emacs hits "org-babel-load-file" it loads the only version of Org available on the path - i.e. the built-in version.
 If so, what's the fix? Does keeping a literate config force you to do some ugly workarounds with setting the load-path manually prior to running "org-babel-load-file" or pinning what version of a package you use through straight, or is there some cleaner option I don't know of? It seems like Emacs should be able to reload a package to a newer version during runtime once the new source becomes available.

I use the ##tag method from Sasha to signify a root link or parent link attached to a note. When I search for ## I also get all the H2 sections.
##links to @#links, is there a way to have a saved search with a joker like to catch every terms beginning with @# like @#$ or @#catchall?
To organize myself I use ttt to signify a note as a terrain in french, meaning field, for me they work not like hubs. And I have the feeling I would appreciate to have a saved search with ttt AND my root tags to get an idea of where my energy is going.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Most languages that I work with, I use a code formatter. It takes away a lot of the cognitive load with me having to worry about the code looking good.
 For elisp, I have been using srefactor for a long time, but it has quite a few issues have not been update in 5 years. Most other formatters for elisp/lisp that I have seen has some subtle issues or just does not handle splitting of long lines. People also have suggested just using aggressive-indent-mode and then putting the line breaks manually, but I was hoping to avoid having to decide where/when to split long lines as well.
 Do anyone else use a formatter, any recommendations on a good one?
 Projects that I am aware of: - https://github.com/eschulte/lisp-format - https://gitlab.com/ideasman42/emacs-elisp-autofmt

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Note: Although the following example is for org-roam-capture-templates, it works in the same way as org-capture-template.
 How can I change the org-capture templates to insert the file name of the current buffer I'm visiting and format it with a string? create a new file with a name based on the file I'm currently visiting?
 Example: I'm visiting a file called book_notes_some_title.org and I want org-capture to create a new file called book_notes_some_title_anki.org.
 The following example doesn't work because it will only call the function once - when I evaluate the variable. I need to make it call a function every time I create the template.
 The function simply return the current buffer's file-name (through org-roam) and appends _anki.org to the name.
 (setq org-roam-capture-templates `(("d" "default" plain "%?" :if-new (file+head ,(format "%s_anki.org" (file-name-nondirectory (file-name-sans-extension (org-roam-node-file (org-roam-node-at-point))))) "#+title: ${title}\nDescription: ") :unnarrowed t))) 
 Edit: My explanation was wrong.

All I have used is C# in VS Community and in Unity scripts, so I've always had it simplified in the IDE.
 What I want to know is: how do I start writing/using Haskell code? What is GHC/GHCup/Chocolatey? It seemed to me that GHC is something like a "plugin" required by the machine to run Haskell code, but I'm not sure of that, and I don't even have a guess for what the other terms mean (GHCup/Chocolatey)
 I also tried installing VSCode with a Haskell extension and it seemed to be the most simple solution, but I would like opinions on that: what is best/easier? VSCode or using the PowerShell/CMD with "manual" writing on something like Sublime?
 If the manual way is best, can anyone explain how I install/set up Haskell/GHC on my PC? And how would I run code? If I have a function/method written on a file, what would I do if I wanted to use it? 
 Thanks a lot

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, fellow Zettlers!
Being fresh to both Zettelkasten method and this forum, I have to first and foremost ask for your forgiveness if this was already discussed or perhaps it is stupidly obvious, but I struggled to find any threads relating to the following conundrum: how to deal with fields of knowledge or areas of practice, which are subject to significant changes in relatively short time frames?
Example: I am a lawyer based in an EU member state, practicing in a global industry dealing with several fields of law (e.g. intellectual property or privacy law) which are subject to quite dynamic changes (due to legislative actions on EU and state level, ever growing case law, technological changes, etc.). Of course, some concepts fundamental to jurisprudence or terminology specific to a given field may stay relevant for some time. However, due to this high variability, when taking notes regarding more practical and recent issues I face the problem of dealing with "volatile" notes, which feel like they may unexpectedly, suddenly, in any moment become irrelevant, useless or even harmful (e.g. by severing an existing train of thought with a statement which is not true any more).
Maybe this is my lack of understanding, but I feel there is a meaningful difference between evolution of sciences (regardless of its pace), where old models or theories give way to new ones, which explain given real phenomena better, or where new evidence provide a fresh look on the reality; 
legal "reality" may change in an instant, rendering prior statements describing this "reality" not so much obsolete or outdated as simply not true any more (or true exclusively within a bound time frame).
Are there any good practices or strategies helping to deal with such volatility of notes and tending the Zettelkasten without getting crazy?]]></summary>

 but after initializing it just like this:
  (use-package counsel :init (setq ivy-use-virtual-buffers t) :config (ivy-mode 1) (global-set-key (kbd "C-s") 'swiper-isearch)) 
 it seems that I have properly instrumented versions of find-file, M-x, describe-function/variable, etc. But the bindings still refer to the original functions, not the counsel flavored ones, e.g.:
  C-x C-f runs the command find-file (found in global-map), which is an interactive compiled Lisp function in ‘files.el’. 
 When explicitly calling the counsel- ones, I see little to no difference, for example some of them automatically prefix the search pattern with .
 How is ivy instrumenting builtin functions under the hood? What does counsel add in top of that? Is it worth rebinding everything as suggested in the manual? Why?
 Sorry for so many questions but I dislike copy&pasting stuff to my init.el without a clear reason. Maybe someone experienced with ivy can help me (an ido old-timer).

 I do see some java libraries for this, wonder what is the best one and if there is some scala wrap or alternative (but java is fine also if nothing else)
 thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I used to have 3 monitors on my desk, but when I started working from home, I just had the 1 monitor, and for various reasons, I still only have the 1 and it's unlikely to change.
 I used to have several small, single-purpose frames off on a second monitor, and one of them was for compilation output. It's been 18 months with just one monitor, and I still haven't found a solution that I like.
 Currently, I've got a child frame that pops up compilation output in the middle of my main frame. It hides itself if the compilation succeeds. I don't really like this because there's a lot of extra handling that I have to do, focus switching is weird (like if I'm in my web browser and click on the child frame, it's in focus, but the main frame doesn't come to the front. I have to click on a buffer in the parent frame), and it doesn't play nicely with which-key, etc.
 I've tried some solutions where the buffer switches to the compilation output and the buffer hides itself afterwards, but those are honestly kinda janky. 
 So I'm on the verge of going back to a compilation frame--dedicated or not--but then the cues that compilation is still ongoing or has failed or succeeded might be hidden if I'm working on something else. (I used to try modifying the modeline in every active buffer, but that caused weird conflicts with doom modeline and other things that also wanted to play with the display.)
 There's a tradeoff with everything; I'm not looking for a perfect solution, I'm just curious what other people do.

 What's worked well for my learning style is to have a "question of the day" programming challenge, where the poster posts their own implementation of a programming problem the next day.
 Does anyone know of something like this for elisp?

I can group by filenamess using the :auto-category selector, or by path hierarchy using the :auto-outline-path selector, but I cannot figure out how to get both. 
 I would like to get something like this:
 File_1.org/Tasks/Coding File_1 : NEXT Write script File_1 : TODO Debug File_1.org/Tasks/Manuscript File_1: TODO Write draft File_2.org/Tasks/Coding File_2: NEXT Run simulations 
 So basically it would like to add the filename to the groups obtained by :auto-outline-path selector. u/github-alphapapa, is this possible?
 Many thanks!

 I've looked thru the manual and I see something about frame parameters but I don't know enough to know what if anything I should change or if I should be looking elsewhere.

My apologies if the title sounds vague, I'm looking for advice or project ideas to get an introduction to frameworks such as Play, Akka and Spark. and to how they are being used in real world applications. I have some background in Rust, so getting familiar with Scala was pretty straightforward. I'm loving the language a lot and how natural it feels. 
 However, I would like to start building some hobby projects by using the aforementioned frameworks if possible, but I'm not really sure where to start, or which of them is more beginner-intermediate-friendly. 
 May I ask; does anyone mind suggesting a learning roadmap or drop some project suggestions/ideas? I'd deeply appreciate it. Thank you in advance. Stay safe and healthy everyone.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am a developer who works with a ticketing system. I get assigned tickets, they contain details, I complete the tickets, and move on to the next task. I would like to incorporate org mode into my workflow but I'm not sure how. Here is what I'd like to do, perhaps someone can tell me the best way to accomplish that.
 I want to be able to create a TODO for each ticket that I am assigned. I want to be able to keep notes on that ticket as well as have a check list of things to do. To include such items as:
  
investigate bug
 create a pull request
 verify with test team
  
Additionally I'd like to have custom states other than TODO and DONE. Something like TODO, IN PROGRESS, DONE, VERIFYING, and BLOCKED. Finally I would like to be able to assign tags to different tickets so I can track them. So if tickets 1,2,&3 all deal with the UI, then they get tagged with "UI". If tickets 4 & 5 are done on the backend with Java, I'd like to tag them as "JAVA" and "BACKEND". Then I'd like to be able to filter based on my tags.
 What is the best way of doing this in org mode? Should I be making a new document for each ticket? Just have one really big document with all my tickets? Is there something about this that I'm missing? I'd appreciate any clues you guys could toss my way.

 boxy-headlines (previously org-real-headlines) allows you to view and navigate any org file as a boxy diagram.
 org-real allows you to keep track of real things as org mode links.
 Both of these packages rely on the boxy.el layout framework to generate interactive and expandable box diagrams.
 The example above shows off some of the available customization options for each package, like flex-width, margin, and padding, as well as the ability to work well in a linux console.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi!
 I'm trying to export org-protocol links so I can open stuff directly in emacs, but the ox-html export won't even export the link.
 This is the code I'm using before processing:
 (defun my-open-in-emacs-link (backend) "Add a link to use org-protocol to open a file in emacs." (save-excursion (goto-char (point-min)) (while (re-search-forward "\\(\\[\\[file:.*?\\]\\[.*\\]\\]\\)" nil t) (message "MATCHED: %s" (match-string-no-properties 1)) (let* ((file-path (replace-regexp-in-string ".*\\[\\[file:\\(.*?\\)\\]\\[.*" "\\1" (match-string-no-properties 1))) (fixed-file-path (replace-regexp-in-string "\\(.*?\\)\\(::.*\\)?" "\\1" file-path))) (message "FILE_PATH: %s" fixed-file-path) (replace-match (format "%s ([[org-protocol://open-file?file=%s][open in Emacs]])" (match-string-no-properties 1) fixed-file-path)))))) (add-hook 'org-export-before-processing-hook 'my-open-in-emacs-link) 
 So, before processing the org file, go through each link and make is look like [[link][name]] ([[protocol][open in Emacs]]. However the only thing that shows when exporting is name (). The protocol part won't show up.
 How can I export the org-protocol link?

However, I was a poor learner back then. Imagine short-term memorization on steroids. Effective short-term, not at all long-term. In other words, I remember nothing. Not even what an atom is.
I'm not sure if this is important, but I'm adding it in case it is.
I'm taking a gap year and now I'm working on choosing a career to pursue. I don't have the research skills necessary to get anywhere with this, so I don't know where to even begin. Also, at the same time, I can't do research on how to do research. Thus, I'm double stuck, if that's even possible.
I've tried looking on Google, Reddit, and Wikipedia. Didn't help. Too much information, some of it not actionable, and I don't even know which is trustworthy.
Any tips on how to get unstuck with this project? If research isn't important to complete it, some advice or resources on research would be helpful too. Research skills are crucial for most of what I do.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I am working on adding more packages to NonGNU ELPA, the new package archive enabled by default from Emacs 28 onwards. Compared to GNU ELPA, there is no need for a copyright assignment (the only requirement is that packages do not endorse non-free software, but that is the case for most Emacs-related software to begin with).
 As can be seen here, I have already added contributed a number of popular packages and am waiting for a few packages to be fixed before they are added (I log the progress on these issues on my homepage).
 Going forward, I'd like to know what packages there would be an interest in adding to the archive? Note that a lot of popular packages are already on GNU ELPA, but I am specifically interested in the packages that are currently just available on MELPA or in no other package archive.
 (P.S. I am not interested in a flame-war on whether or not NonGNU ELPA makes sense or not. I just want to gather a list of popular packages.)

 https://gist.github.com/Patryk27/c7b9dac8113f4ccdb2ef74e0083d9d41
 I've just created it a few minutes ago, but a quick test shows that the code works as intended; I'll try using it for a few days and probably try upstreaming it - in a better, more configurable way, that is :-)

 When I use an external keyboard (MS Sculpt), the opt-somekey combinations are recognized as Greek/Special characters (π , © etc).
 If I load emacs without any packages (emacs -q) it works as expected.
 So it is some package loaded later doing this? 
 I had 'Chord' enabled before. I removed it but it didn't improve the situation.
 My Setup
  
Mac OS X Big Sur
 
Emacs28 with native compilation (Same issue with 27)
 
Recent Doom emacs config.
 
 I use Doom with several programming modes, orgmode etc. How do I narrow down which package is causing this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I use org to take notes for my classes, and make pretty good use of <<<radio links>>> to make vocabulary terms and definitions get automatically linked-to from other parts of my notes (I use a file per class so I only need intra-file links).
 However upon exporting my notes to PDF to share with classmates (so they don't have to ignore all the org markup and it looks pretty), the radio links don't work. It does remove all the angle brackets, but no links. Ideally I'd like it to preserve that so people reading the pdf can click links to jump around in the (very long) file.
 Is this:
  
Something wrong on my config (maybe add some kind of #+ line to the file telling the exporter to include radio links? A variable in emacs?)
 Something wrong with my latex install (I have the full scheme of like 2GB of stuff, I can't imagine I'm missing something)
 A limitation of PDF (do PDFs even support file jump links? Interestingly exporting to ODT mostly preserves them - they work similar to how they do inside emacs, but then converting the ODT to pdf doesn't work either, and I can't leave it as ODT as they're all normie MS Word users, and afaik Word can't open ODT files)
 A limitation of org's exporter (I just can't export radio links/have to make [[manual links]]?)
  
Any leads or help would be appreciated.

 Are there any packages that disable using the same command twice (Like repeated C-n or C-f ) so I'm forced to move more efficiently?

The final hurdle for me at the moment is getting org-noter-pdftools-create-skeleton to create a much plainer output, and bonus points for it going straight into an org-roam node, but I'd happy for that not to happen.
 Currently when I run M-x org-noter-pdftools-create-skeleton I get the following org-file. I have no idea what the 'contents' subheading is doing, but it seems to contain random bit from the annotation.
 Ideally I want the command to just output a bullet pointed list with the 'comment' text. 
 If anyone has experience with changing the output of this command I'd love to hear what you did and how. 
 I'm quite new to emacs on the whole, so forgive me if the solution appears simple!

But the auto completion of ivy prevents me from copying remote file to local machine, because it does not allow me to delete the ssh prefix, e.g. /ssh:jky@mac:/, once I delete to the slash, I cannot delete further.

 Hello everybody,
 droplet is a type-safe SQL library targeting (so far, only) Postgres. Two main features set it apart from similar PureScript (or Haskell) libraries:
  
SQL like DSL
  
The eDSL used tries to stay as close as possible to regular SQL. IMO, this has the advantage of making the translation from PureScript to SQL transparent, specially for more complex queries.
 So far, most common usage SQL keywords are supported, e.g., SELECT INSERT DELETE UPDATE UNION PREPARE, etc.
  
Query mapper 
  
Query result rows are always expressed as records, with projected columns as keys. The query mapper can also be used independently from the DSL, in case raw SQL strings are needed.
 Feedback is highly welcomed. Specially ideas to improve error messages or ease the current type class abuse :)

 I can receive emails and all the IMAP functions seem to be working (deleting/reading updates other mail clients).
 However, when trying to send emails it just hangs at “sending via mail…” with no obvious errors.
 I’m using ProtonMail and their bridge, with the default SSL mode. If I try changing it to STARTSSL I get either a certificate error or invalid transport method error, so I can see that it’s maybe trying to send the email if the rest of the config is broken?
 I saw this note that using contexts for smtpmail settings as outlined above might not work, but I was wondering if anyone else had thoughts on that? I’d like to not add another application to the mail process if possible.

 I tried to clean up everything and make bootstrap but to no avail. Googling this issue also came in vain.

 I used to update and compile weekly, and everything was alright then. There was a one-month gap since my last update, and I noticed the version was bumped to 29. I was wondering if there is anything new I missed or it is because of something else.

 Has anyone encountered something similar? I am so grateful for any hints or solutions for this issue.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all! I would be grateful for any help with a question about org-mode. I love using org files, and displaying them in Emacs is wonderful: I have my config set up to present subtrees indented, hide leading stars, etc.
 However, I would like to improve how my .org files look when accessed by other editors (or when printed out). Without the illusion of indentation that comes from editing .org files in Emacs, the documents are (at least in my opinion) extremely hard to decipher at-a-glance; there is no obvious visual relationship between headings and subheadings.
 Ideally, I would like for the content under subheadings to actually be indented in the text files, so that they would be easy to read/skim in other editors. My searching led to me to this page in the manual, which seems to explain that this can be done if the following settings are used:
 (setq org-adapt-indentation t org-hide-leading-stars t org-odd-levels-only t) 
 However, even after adding these settings to my config, the behavior doesn't change: when I save a .org buffer, it is written to disk without hard indentation. Did I misunderstand something about how this works/should work (perhaps I missed something obvious)? Has anyone else had better luck making this happen?
 Many thanks in advance for any help.

I started migrating many of my notes, api org files (used with verb) and other things at work into it's own private org repo. What i'd like to do is actually somehow combine the content of the repos together without actually having them go to the same repo. So at work, I can add work fiels to the work repo, while at the same time have the db include my personal files that I can also update. I'm not sure if there's ways to manage this seamlessly so that I can not have my private content mixed with my public.

 Lately I've been doing a lot of config hacking. I use Doom as my main daily driver, but starting a vanilla config and playing around with various packages has taught me a lot of cool stuff and helped me rethink parts of my workflow that have been fairly sub-optimal until now (naturally there's still lots of room for further refinement).
 Yesterday and today I've migrated features from my vanilla config that I particularly like into my Doom config. While doing it, I got carried away with the latest commit message, which related to adding my consult-dir and embark configurations into Doom. These are both great packages and I am more than happy to do what I can to give them more attention and hopefully convince some people to check them out! Here are links to…]]></summary>

I found a stackoverflow answer that creates a flymake.mk in the root of the project and makes flymake to look for that file, which only contains the make recipe check-syntax.
 Of course that didn't work. Flymake log says: *** No rule to make target 'check-syntax'. Stop.
 So I did a way simpler project, just a file.c and a Makefile, with default flymake and that worked fine. So I removed the check-syntax part from the Makefile and put it on a flymake.mk, all three files in the same directory. Now again with the custom init and doesn't work either.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm currently trying to make some bindings to a c library. The C library has a whole bunch of constructors and special destructors. Which means I can't just free everything with free; I have to use the correct c function.
 My plan was to use the ReaderT monad to hold pointers of the allocated objects and create a typeclass for deletion which would trigger when things fall out of scope:
 class Collectable p where collect :: (MonadIO m) => p -> m () newtype CThing = CThing (Ptr ()) instance Collectable CThing where collect (CThing p) = ffi_c_delete_function_for_thing p 
 I then created a newtype called 'Bin' for holding these objects:
 newtype Bin = Bin { unBin :: forall p . Collectable p => [p] } 
 The reason for this is that it complained about impredicative polymorphism if I didn't create the newtype. It also didn't like:
 newtype Bin = Bin { unBin :: [forall p . Collectable p => p] } 
 For the same reason.
 I then tried to call the delete functions on the environment:
 mapM collect $ unBin env 
 But GHC complains again:
 Ambiguous type variable ‘a0’ arising from a use of ‘collect’ prevents the constraint ‘(Collectable a0)’ from being solved. 
 Why can't it solve the constraint? I have defined a bin to contain only collectable objects!?
 As you have probably worked out by now, I have very little idea what I'm doing when it comes to higher rank polymorphism! send help!
 I have a backup plan (creating a type level list for the environment and using type families to construct the Collectable class), but it seems excessive

 I see some documentations Repeated tasks - Org mode, and packages like org-recur, other way that I saw on a suggestion is:
 * TODO Some task SCHEDULED: <2020-10-05 Tue ++1w> * TODO Some task SCHEDULED: <2020-10-06 Wed ++1w> 
 Is set the same task to each day from the weekday, but I think that this approach isn't correctly.
 Do you know if is there a way to do some task work with only weekdays (Mon to Fri) with a specific time?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[tldr; You can use C-u M-x command-name to pass the Universal Argument into an interactive command. This is helpful if you do not want to bind the command to a hotkey, but still want to pass the Universal Argument into it.
 I recently encountered a situation with the anki-editor package where I wanted to pass the Universal Argument into the anki-editor-push-notes function. I did not want to create a keyboard shortcut for this command because I will use it less than once a day. First I tried things like M-x anki-editor-push-notes(4) and M-x (anki-editor-push-notes '(4)) but neither of those worked. Then, following this guide, I created a wrapper function that calls (anki-editor-push-notes '(4)). This worked fine. I could call my wrapper function which would in turn call the function I really wanted to run with the Universal Argument passed in; however, I figured out a more succinct way. Pressing C-u M-x anki-editor-push-notes will pass the Universal Argument into the command. In my opinion this is better because I don't have to have that extra function in my init.el and I don't have to remember two slightly distinct commands.
 I figured if I didn't know about this and the author of this guide may not have known about this, then there may be other people on the subreddit who do not know about this. So I am just trying to share a cool thing I learned.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I use the i3wm on a two monitor setup. 
 I generally have one Emacs GUI window/frame with my org-agenda buffer and mu4e continually open on a single workspace on one monitor. 
 Then I open a new instance of Emacs (in a new frame) for whatever project I intend to work on. If I want to pivot to an unrelated project/task, I open a new Emacs frame and edit the relevant files to that project there.
  
I'm curious to know if this is the standard in the Emacs community. I sometimes think this workflow is a bit too resource intensive, and it seems wasteful to execute init.el several times and load all my packages etc. every time I do something new (although it takes <5 sec to load, which I'm happy with).
 An alternative would be running one instance of Emacs, then doing e.g. C-x 5 2 to open a new frame (but now init.el is not re-evaluated) every time I want to work on a different project/task. This also feels a bit resource heavy -- maybe the resolution of this problem is just to not open so many things at once!
 What is your workflow, and do you think it's efficient memory wise, or helpful in terms of organization?

https://mjtsai.com/blog/2021/09/30/manual-full-justification/
The linked twitter thread is worth a look.
The real banger is this document: https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/snes/588741-super-metroid/faqs/10114
You don't have to actually read it; it's a guide/walkthrough for a Super Nintendo game. The interesting detail is that the author accomplished full text justification without tweaking the spacing between words. That's how you usually accomplish that effect in e.g. MS Word or other desktop publishing applications. The space between words is stretched.

But here, there's only ever 1 space between words.
So the author had to write everything to fit. Conversely, that means words and sentence structures had to be picked because of their length to properly fill the available space.
Matt Gemmell points out that this is not a feat one is likely to accomplish for the lulz. It's serious effort. And that document sure as heck is long! Now that's some plain text dedication]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to write an emacs w3m filter for duckduckgo lite. I thought it would be cool to leverage magit-section, and have each result in its own section. So I have a function for inserting the sections from parsed 'result-groups' (a group is all the DOM material for one result):
 (defun my/w3m-insert-duckduckgo-section (group) (let ((href (cdar (cdadar group))) (title (caddar group)) (body (cddr (nth 1 group)))) (magit-insert-section (result) (magit-insert-heading (insert (format "%s\n" title))) (insert (format "%s\n" "this-is-the-body"))))) 
 I'm using the "this-is-the-body" string in place of an actual body at the moment, because I haven't got round to learning about parsing DOM text yet.
 I run this in a loop over all the groups, inserting each one. This runs inside a root section I insert first.
 This inserts the relevant text, but with no special properties (e.g. magit sections normally have certain faces) and no newlines. Everything is on one line, just running on to the next result.
 If I run something like this in a scratch buffer, the result is correct:
 (magit-insert-section (root) (magit-insert-section (result) (magit-insert-heading (format "%s\n" "Header text 1")) (insert (format "%s\n\n" "this-is-the-body"))) (magit-insert-section (result) (magit-insert-heading (format "%s\n" "Header text 2")) (insert (format "%s\n" "this-is-the-body")))) 
 Running eval-last-sexp after this in the scratch buffer works exactly as expected (standard magit section text properties, newlines are printed correctly). What's most stange is that if I use eval-expression to run the above form in a w3m buffer, it works correctly! Correct faces and properties etc.
 So, why do the newlines and properties not show up in the w3m buffer when I call the forms programatically vs interactively, and how can I fix this?
 TIA!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a social science background. Most, if not all, of my requirements consists of - taking notes and to be able to search through them to write research papers. I am already using Scrivener, which I feel, seems to do all of that pretty efficiently.
 I have a question for the Emacs community. How can Emacs help me ? I am willing to take the learning curve, but how is Emacs better than Scrivener ? That's my main question.
 Any help would be very much appreciated. Thank you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been working on a cookbook using emacs org mode, and org-chef to import recipes. I set it up so that I can export to a printable bifold booklet that I can use in the kitchen, and it exports to my website: https://www.gnuisnotunix.com/recipes/
 I have a couple more things I'd like it to do:
 So far I have been manually inserting page breaks with #+LATEX: \newpage to prevent recipes from splitting across odd numbered pages, so you don't have to flip a page to see the rest of the recipe. I'd like a way to automate that if possible. I usually adjust the font size a bit to get everything to fit on a multiple of 4 pages for printing.
 On the HTML end, I'd like a simple way for each recipe heading to link back to the table of contents, to make the page easier to navigate. It would also be nice if I could get the title of the page to export as a h3 instead of h1, to match the sidebar.
 I have the org mode source here if anyone wants to take a look: https://www.gnuisnotunix.com/recipes/recipes.org

 I have been using Emacs since 2016, and would roughly estimate that I have spent 100+ hours configuring Emacs to my liking (only using other packages and writing small custom functions), and I still play around with my init most weeks to update it and fine tune it to my liking. Although I could use something like Doom or Spacemacs and get a pretty awesome environment with minimal setup, creating and customising these things to my own personal taste is super satisfying. 
 Was just curious, how much time have you all spent configuring your beloved setup? :)

 I want to do something pretty conceptually simple. But I don't know enough elisp to figure out how to do it.
 I have helm configured with helm-bibtex, I have org, and org-roam, and org-ref all more or less installed and working.
 EDIT: in response to a comment below - I also have org-roam-bibtex as well. 
 What I want to have happen is when I open helm-bibtex and select a paper, and then select edit notes, that instead of opening a note with the paper title (as it does now) it runs the org-roam capture template and creates an org-roam node (if one doesn't exist) or opens an existing org-roam node (if it already exists) with the the cite-key as the file name, the paper title as the title, the author's name filled in, etc.
 Any idea how I can do this?

I want to write the function to have the data type signature a -> [a] -> [a]. Here, the a can either be Integers or be tuples (Integers, Integers). I want my function to work in both cases. However, as far as I am aware, tuples cannot be compared with the "==" sign, right? So, the function I have so far
 findE n [] = []
 findE n (m:zs) = if (n == m) then findE n zs else m:(findE n zs)
 will work fine for when a == Integer but not for when the elements in the list are two-component tuples right? I was looking for how to improve my code so that it works for both cases. Also, it would be preferable if no modules need to be imported unless absolutely necessary to make this function universal for a lot of types. Thank you!

 I have been using org-noter and pdf-tools for taking notes during lectures and annotating the slides. However, I would like to have an option to :
  
Automatically update my notes with the highlighted portions, without having to call org-noter-create-skelton every time (more over this function executes interactively so I have to select the options every time). This would make it easier to switch seamlessly between the pdf and the notes.
 When adding precise notes with the shortcut M-i, highlight the corresponding portion in the pdf automatically.
  
Is there any config that I am using missing to achieve these two features ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am looking to write a zip function in Haskell, such that each element of list 1 combines to form a tuple with each element of list 2, something like -
 zip' [0,1,2] [3,4,5] = [(0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (1,3), (1,4), (1, 5), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5)]
 I was wondering if there is a way possible to describe such a function using the original zip. Or ideas on any other way in which this can be done are appreciated!
 I was thinking of "zip (map list1) list2" however this is not really yielding the results it should.

Any advice on how I should proceed with this? Although ideally, I am interested in knowing if there is a way to do this even if the lists have duplicates, I am thinking of writing a code to remove duplicates and then check if the two lists are equal. I already have the code written to remove the duplicates, but cannot think of what to do next to actually compare the lists both ways (i.e, to check if both have exactly the same elements).

Example string of tags with the last one in the series having lost its link decoration.

It seems this behavior is when tags are not on the last line of the file.
Let me explain the following GIF. 
I then line feed 3X, and up arrow, so I'm not on the last line of the file, and after each tag, a space character causes the last tag to lose its link decorations.
Notice the tag in the YAML block. It is not on the last line of the file, and it has no link decoration because it has a space character after it.

EDIT::
It is the last word in the tag that loses its link decoration. In this screenshot, only the second half of the two-word tag is affected.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I got a version of snake working with the threepenny-gui library, but I didn't like the fact that I was explicitly calling newEvent and addStateUpdate manually instead of defining the behavior completely based on events, e.g. this:
 (updates, addUpdate) <- liftIO newEvent managerB <- accumB initialManager updates on UI.tick timer $ \_ -> addUpdate $ \manager -> manager' 
 compared to:
 managerB <- accumB initialManager $ UI.tick timer $> \manager -> manager' 
 IIUC the second is more idiomatic FRP, as it defines a behavior with the actual event instead of creating a proxy event to proxy updates through. But when I make this change, it causes one of two problems:
  
If I define managerB first (using RecursiveDo to access timer, which is defined below), nothing's rendered at all
 If I move managerB to the end (using RecursiveDo to access managerB from the DOM elements), the initial movement when hitting an arrow key for the first time lags, and the frames render in a jerky fashion.
  
Am I doing something wrong? What's the idiomatic way I should structure these events/behaviors?

 Over the last 1-2 years, I've accumulated a good amount of poker-related code that I think would be best to share! Over this week I'll be adding some more libraries to the collection of poker libraries, but this is a good place to start :)
 I'm hoping for:
  
feedback: anything you think/feel about the library and its goals
 usage: try and use the library - tell me if it's helpful...
 review: look at the library code, let me know where I need to make improvements.
  
I haven't yet been able to upload to Hackage, because I don't yet have uploader status. I'm not restless here (I only asked for permission last night). But let me know if you have any issues downloading. I'll also be around all day (west coast USA) to discuss the code in chat or phone call.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello fellow Zettelkasteners. I have heard that zettel notes should be written in one's own words. But I have never understood what it means to write notes in your own words. Most of the time I just copy a passage with minor changes or I translate an English passage as if I copied it.
I thought about different strategies. I could first read a paragraph, then close the book, then rewrite some ideas from memory without looking at the text. Or I could simply read the text and not bother with the information within and just write my thoughts that could come into my mind. Or I could write the note as if I explained it to my mom.
Note that I write my zettel notes in Romanian so when I read a text in English I translate it in Romanian. Not that it helps.
Am I missing something? Can you tell me how can I write a zettel note without copying from the text or write it in my own words?]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[in polysemy, freer-simple and effectful there are two different functions for interpreting an effect:
 interpret :: e :> es => (e a -> Eff es a) -> Eff (e ': es) a -> Eff es a reinterpret :: e :> es => (e a -> Eff (e' ': es) a) -> Eff (e ': es) a -> Eff (e' ': es) a 
 reinterpret is mostly used to interpret an effect into several other effects:
 m :: Logging :> es => Eff es () myHandler :: Writer [String] :> es => Logging a -> Eff es a reinterpret myHandler m :: Eff (Writer [String] ': es) () 
 However in any case I am aware of, I could also use interpret to reach similar goal, even with a more lenient signature:
 interpret myHandler m :: Writer [String] :> es => Eff es () 
 Given that, is there practically anything that is only representable via reinterpret?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I would like to pick up a workflow manager for my data transformation and analysis pipeline. As it's comprised of calls to bioinformatics command line tools and custom R scripts that sometimes have to be submitted to an HPC, I require a fairly flexible solution. 
 There are a billion of them out there (https://github.com/pditommaso/awesome-pipeline), so the decision which one to choose is not exactly easy. Most of my colleagues rely on Nextflow and Snakemake, so I should consider these, but before I start to learn an entirely new language I wanted to explore the Haskell ecosystem for possible solutions. Strong typing should in theory be a perfect match for a pipeline manager. And having this in Haskell would simplify replacing some of my R code with Haskell eventually.
 So far I saw three tools:
  
Funflow: https://github.com/tweag/funflow
 Porcupine: https://github.com/tweag/porcupine
 Bioshake: https://github.com/PapenfussLab/bioshake
  
Is here anybody who uses any of these in production and could share their experiences? Are there other Haskell-based pipeline tools? Is the user community for these tools just to small to make them a feasible choice?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I posted something similar before but can I get an opinion on this: https://www.sandromaglione.com/how-to-use-fpdart-functional-programming-in-dart-and-flutter/
 Dart is a null-safe language that I am using for Flutter development and because I want to learn Haskell but my new job takes up so much of my time, I am looking for options where I can combine both. However, reading the documentation above, and with my still-novice Haskell knowledge it is not immediately clear to me if:
 - this is going to help me learn Haskell
 I am already using a package called Freezed for immutable classes (along with a state management package called Riverpod) which in tandem with null-safety makes the code "error-safe" enough. 
 FYI shifting from almost purely academic coding to "doing-it-for-a-living" was invigorating at first but now I feel trapped because I have to learn and get better at what my company uses (Dart, Flutter, FastAPI) leaving me too exhausted. I finally had a whole day off today but still ended up polishing the app I am working on. There has to be light at the end of the tunnel?

 new to orgmode. can someone help me amend the following sample config? 
 C-c c t adds a todo item under a title "Tasks" like this:

 but i would like to add the todo item without the *Tasks title. also, if possible i would like it to be inserted at the top of the file as the first in the list instead of the bottom.
 any help would be greatly appreciated. thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Is there a way to have the carry-over of unfinished-todos that org-journal offers to also work in org-roam dailies? 
 I do like the "integration" of my dailies (which I often use to structure my day - a bit out of my head, maybe because I do not harness the power of the agenda yet..) and also the fact that there are some backlinks when I just jot down some notes on it.
 But I am missing the feature of taking unfinished todos from the past to the current day - to finish stuff that I could not finish the last day..
 Any ideas about this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Haskell.org committee is considering a change to the Haskell.org Downloads page. The change is being reviewed in a GitHub PR.
 The specifics of the change are to replace Chocolatey with ghcup as the preferred installation method of GHC, cabal-install and haskell-language-server on Windows. The overall effect is that the install instructions become common over Windows, Linux and MacOS. The Chocolatey install method is mentioned further down the page. (The PR does not impinge on Stack. The Stack instructions remain unchanged.)
 The committee would welcome input from any interested parties, particularly those who have familiarity with Chocolatey, or ghcup on Windows, or both. You are welcome to comment on the PR itself.
 Thanks to bodigrim for the PR.

 I'm experiencing some doubts when implementing the behavior of my entities using companion object, case class and the new given/using concept(the reborn implicit).
 So...
 Let's imagine that we are defining an User abstraction that should contain the behavior of addFriend.
 Is this the right location to place the addFriend method and to consume it?
 Idk... It doesn't feel "right" this need of declaring given User = user and calling the addFriend from the companion object
 ```scala sealed trait User(id: String, name: String, friends: List[User])
 object Users { enum UserProfile: case Common
 final case class CommonUser private(id: String, name: String, friends: List[User]) extends User
 def create(id: String, name: String, friends: List[User] = List()): User = { ... }
 def addFriend(friend: User)(using user: User): Unit = { ... } }
 val myUser = Users.create("fakeMyUserId", "fakeMyUserName") val friend = Users.create("fakeFriendId", "fakeFriendName")
 given User = myUser val myUserWithFriends = Users.addFriend(friend) ```

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I’m pretty new to scala. I’m building a greenfield application and need to solve my CRUD problem. 
 I’d like to bring a bit of the functional paradigm to CRUD operations. 
 “Find all case class objects in table that pass function, apply this function to update”
 You get the idea. Sorry if my terminology is off anywhere and please correct. 
 My requirements are: 1. Nothing experimental, this is an enterprise application 2. Readability 3. Leverages functional expressiveness
 4. You have personally used it before and have lived with its growing pains. 5. Compatible with SSMS
 Frankly there are so many options and I’m overwhelmed, could use some help narrowing down the field.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When reading texts, I occasionally find that I didn't understand something very well.
I follow a modified version of the Feynman Technique for writing Zettels. Also, I write in a notebook first, then transcribe the writing into my computer to avoid editing while writing.
However, when there are gaps, I'm not too keen on the idea of referring to resources until I can fill in the gaps. It means that I have to switch from writing to reading. Reading is low effort to me while writing is demanding. I'm most energetic in the morning. Thus, I'd rather use my mornings to write than to read if I have anything to write about.
But, if I split the tasks, I need to do something about what I've written so I can address the gaps and re-use the text. I've tried multiple approaches to deal with this to no avail.
So I ask: What is your approach to handle gaps in your understanding when processing reading notes?]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, brand new Zettelkaster here - as in, I've been reading blogs about it and just ordered How to Take Smart Notes but I haven't started implementing anything yet. I feel like I'll learn the principles better if I can immediately start implementing the practices, and that means I need to choose what software I'm going to use (definitely not a card-and-box system - my handwriting isn't up to the task).
My existing workflow involves 1) highlighting and commenting on scholarly papers and ebooks in Mendeley; 2) highlighting and scribbling in the margin of hard copy books; 3) saving popular press articles to Evernote from Chrome. Then I write in Word. As you can see, something to process and organize notes and move them smoothly to the writing process is greatly needed.
Since I already have several programs in this process, my top consideration for Zettelkasten software is that it be intuitive and work out-of-the-box without me having to hack any fixes.
I have seen that some people use Evernote for Zettelkasten and I wonder if that's the way to go, to avoid proliferating software. It would be nice if I could click from my note on an article to easily see the article itself. However, looking at the earlier thread on Evernote, it seemed to get a bit technical with people figuring out plug-ins and fixes - I wonder if there's software I will find more simple and intuitive for Zettlekasten.
Thanks very much in advance for your help!]]></summary>

 In my org-mode workflow, I export the work done in the week and all current tasks with:
 elisp (setq org-agenda-custom-commands '(("W" "Weekly Review" ((agenda "" ((org-agenda-span 7))) (todo "TODO") (todo "STRT") (todo "LOOP") (todo "WAIT")) ; review waiting items ((org-agenda-start-with-log-mode t))) ))  Then I write the list with org-agenda-write. The problem is that I loose heading tree during the process.
 What I got:

 Is it possible to keep global heading when exporting agenda view ?

 Double escape closes the string early as expected and results in illegal syntax.
 #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp (defun foo () (princ "Hello (\\"there")) #+END_SRC 
 I could not replicate in lisp-mode major.
 Any ideas? Should I take this to #IRC? Is this org-babel or some other component?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As a scala data engineer, I normally write some ETL projects and bigdata projects using Spark.
 I learned about functional programming lately and got to know about Cats.
 I see cats is very useful in the aspects of dealing with NullPointer Exception as well as providing higher abstraction for Try, Option, Eigher, Future classes.
 My question is, unlike some other program like web, which is not allowed to crash on runtime, data engineer's job allows programming crash and sometimes it's more desirable for me to fail fast so I can know what's wrong immediately. I don't need my data job to run all the time and finally I can only find it's wrong in the log.
 With that in mind, I found the Try, Option, Either, Future seems not so useful to me. Because if I use them, I had to use some option.get
 or either.left.get
 to get the method result, which seems rather unnecessary. Otherwise, the program never fail.
 In my company, people don't know Cats, but they can carry out their data development normally.
 So is my above perspective right? Please correct me if anything wrong in my thinking.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) is a MCMC sampling algorithm which proposes new states based on the simulation of Hamilton’s equations of motion.
One of the main ingredients of this algorithm is its integration scheme — how the equations are discretized and its solutions found.
The standard choice for this is the classical leapfrog.
In this blog post we present our empirical investigation of U7U_7U7​ — an algorithm that is computationally more expensive, but also more accurate.
This trade-off is not a simple one (after all, more precision implies less tries), but our explorations show that this is a promising algorithm, which can outperform leapfrog in some cases.
We don’t suppose previous knowledge of integration methods, but in case you are new to HMC or MCMC methods, a good starting point…]]></summary>

So for example I'd like to do forward search (whilst in org file find corresponding place in pdf), and reverse search (whilst in pdf find corresponding place in org file). The closest I can currently get is to add #+LaTeX_HEADER: \synctex=1 to the org file which gets me reverse search in the pdf and be directed not to the org file, but to the intermediate tex file that org creates when compiling org to pdf. 
 I feel like org to pdf bidirectional linking should be possible in 2021. To me this is pretty much the only thing holding me back from using orgmode for all pdf generation.
 Many thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've recently found the Google Maps feature that allows you to save places and organize them into lists (e.g., restaurants you have been recommended), and then choose to show in the map or not the places in a given list. I find it really useful and would like to start using it more, but I don't think those lists are a good way to organize a large amount of places, and have some privacy issues with Google Maps. I would rather use org-mode to organize them, and then export them whenever I want to some other open maps application, or maybe keep them synchronized automatically. Do any of you know of something that implements this or something similar?

 | ! | slope | intercept | xval | yval | |---+-------+-----------+-------+------| | | 1.2 | -5 | 1.4 | | | | 2.4 | 2 | -5 | | | | -5.6 | -3 | 2.2 | | | | -0.2 | 4 | 2.718 | | | | .56 | 3.14 | -0.5 | | #+TBLFM: $5=$2*$4+$3 | | slope | intercept | xval | yval | |---+-------+-----------+-------+------| | | 1.2 | -5 | 1.4 | | | | 2.4 | 2 | -5 | | | | -5.6 | -3 | 2.2 | | | | -0.2 | 4 | 2.718 | | | | .56 | 3.14 | -0.5 | | #+TBLFM: $5=$2*$4+$3 
 The only difference between these tables is that the first has named columns while the second doesn't. For both tables, I can calculate values in the last column one at a time by doing M-x org-table-recalculate or C-c *, but iteratively updating the table using M-x org-table-iterate or C-u C-u C-c * only works for the second table. For the first table, if I run org-table-iterate, I get the message "Table was already stable." Is this a bug, or am I not understanding how named columns are supposed to work?
 I am running Org 9.4.6 and Emacs 27.2 on Windows 10
 Update: I posted this question on StackExchange and someone pointed out the following from the Org manual. So it turns out I didn't understand how named columns work 😄
  
The documentation (C-h i g(org)Advanced Features) says: 
 Important: Please note that for these special tables, recalculating the table with ‘C-u C-c *’ only affects rows that are marked ‘#’ or ‘*’, and fields that have a formula assigned to the field itself. The column formulas are not applied in rows with empty first field.

Is there a top-level dependency, and if so, if you exclude the dependencies of that top-level dependency won't it be broken? Or does it come into play if there is an upgrade in the future?

I want to check for all the tuples with the first same element that the third element meets some criteria for all of them, and then put the first element in a new list. How would I go about with this? I am only beginning with Scala so it's hard to even reason about this.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi - I can update a value for a mutable.Map using the 'update' function/method whereas immutable.Map doesn't have it so I tried somethin like this,
 mymap(i) = mymap(i)+1
 but that didn't work. Alternatively converting the map to a mutable map also did not work for me,
 ....mapValues(somefunc).to(mutable.Map) //didn't work
 I'm using scala version 2.12
 Edit:
 I've put the code below and here are the issues,
  
the 'mapValues' method is deprecated in 2.13 and unfortunately the scala api doc doesn't give any hint on what otherwise I can use
 As per the comments 'to' factory method exist only in 2.13 version but not in 2.12
 'update' won't work on immutable map.
 no direct way to create mutable map from an immutable map
  
Not sure what lies ahead in Scala 3 version, I guess having hints and example usage on each API is what will make my future learning easy. 
 def countTriplet(arr: Array[Long], r: Long): Long = { val aft = arr.groupBy(identity).mapValues(_.length) val bfr = new mutable.HashMap[Long, Int]() var cnt = 0 var i = 0 while (i < arr.length - 1) { val n = arr(i) if (bfr.contains(n / r) && n % r == 0 && aft.contains(n * r)) { cnt += bfr.getOrElse(n / r, 0) * aft(n * r) } if (bfr.contains(n)) bfr.update(n, bfr(n) + 1) else bfr.put(n, 1) // aft.update(n, aft(n) - 1) // this won't work i += 1 } cnt }

 I am working with a Java API from a data vendor providing real time streams. I would like to process this stream and write using Akka streams.
 The Java API has a pub sub design and roughly works like this:  Subscription sub = createSubscription(); sub.addListener(new Listener() { public void eventsReceived(List events) { for (Event e : events) buffer.enqueue(e) } }); 
 I have tried to imbed the creation of this subscription and accompanying buffer in a custom graph stage without much success. Can anyone guide me on the best way to interface with this API using Akka? Is Akka Streams the best tool here?
 Edit: I was able to get a solution on stack overflow here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I know that ZIO test has its own mocking setup, but I am not sure how well it works to mock dependencies that aren't ZIO services, such as a 3rd party SDK. He is my situation:
 I have a service that depends on the Firebase Admin SDK, specifically the auth module. So the live layer looks like a ZLayer[Has[FirebaseAuth], Throwable, Has[UserService]]. I'd like to mock the Firebase Auth SDK for testing, but I don't want to use the annoying emulator thing they have, it's too heavyweight and I don't want to deal with running another Docker container.
 UserService wraps around the auth SDK but has some custom logic. For example, UserService.getUserByEmail(email: String): Task[Option[UserId]] returns an effect that returns Some(UserId) (UserId being an internal domain object) if a user with this email exists, None if no user with the email exists, and fails if it was unable to complete either of these. In contrast, FirebaseAuth.getUserByEmailAsync(email: String): ApiFuture[String] returns a Java Future which fails with a specific error if a user with the email doesn't exist.
 For example, for mocking FirebaseAuth's getUserByEmail, I'd like to do something like (pseudo-code):
  when (auth.getUserByEmailAsync(email1)) return Future.succeed("userid") when (auth.getUserByEmailAsync(email2)) return Future.fail(NoSuchUserException) when (auth.getUserByEmailAsync(email3)) return Future.fail(BadEmailException) 
 and use this somehow in my ZIO-test of my UserService.
 I can't find any examples of using Mockito in ZIO test. Does anyone have a code snippet they can share, or if this is better done through ZIO-test's own mocking system (I only saw mocking of ZIO services there so I am not sure if it can do more than that), can you explain how to do it?

The Unit type has a single inhabitant, called unit. It represents values with no computational content.
  
What does "inhabitant" mean in this context? What does it mean to say that unit is the "sole inhabitant of the Unit type"?
 I'm completely clear on what it means for a function to be a method of a typeclass, for example, but Unit is a data type so this isn't that.

 The problem:
 Given a list with values, increment all values by one.
 some 34 word 30 another 38 thing 59 to 39 say 10 here 47
 So, I thought, let's just put in a table and incement column:
 | some | 34 | | | word | 30 | | | another | 38 | | | thing | 59 | | | to | 39 | | | say | 10 | | | here | 47 | | #+TBLFM: $3='(apply '1+ '$2);N' 
 However, when C-c C-c, i get ' (apostrophes) filled in instead of values. Why? :)

 Quickly: My goal is to use the new org-cite citation format for org-exports to ox-hugo and LaTex.
 I didn't use the org-ref style of citations and org-export workflow so I don't know how this would work normally.
 I get citations to get exported but can't figure out how to have them exported in the style I want and with a bibliography.
 If someone could point me to a definitive tutorial or their config files + a test org-mode file that would be great!

 This is basic functionality in essentially any text editor, but aside from regexing it, there doesn't seem to be a way to simply append a specified character to the beginning and the end of every line in the region. Org-emphasize, evil-surround-region, facemenu or make-face, no bueno. Either they outright don't work because of font-lock, for good reasons, or they have half-functional functionality and put it at the beginning and the end of the region, not every line.

This code is pretty contrived and currently not compiling, but I'm just trying to get comfortable with ps syntax and hopefully this gives you an idea what I'm trying to accomplish.
 What I'd like to be able to do is
  
Take my duderrr = MyDude {b: true, i: 77, s: "hellotest", c: 'x'}
 Pass it to succeedOddFailEven
 Given that param i is currently 77 and odd, succeedOddFailEven should return Right (Tuple "hellotest" 'x')
 However if i is changed to an even int such as 78, succeedOddFailEven should return Left (Tuple true 78)
  
Problem is, @ -style deconstruction mydude@(MyDude rec) doesn't seem to be working? Getting this error but not quite sure how to interpret it.

 I'm trying to be better about code documentation and would like to use this for my current contract. It needs to be hosted locally. I was thinking of using this to convert my literate programming org docs into something my client can browse.
 The license here is GPL3
 Can I use this project to render the documentation for my client's commercial, proprietary code? How can I comply with this license and is there any possibility that it can interfere with my client's IP or legal responsibilities in any way?
 I'm an open-source guy but unfortunately that's not how I make my living. If I cannot use this, can anyone point me to the typical workflow?
 EDIT: The author of this project seems very open to resolving licensing issues. For anyone else considering this excellent project, see the relevant issues on GitHub. Personally I'm going to be cautious since I'm not working on a personal project.

As users of several of the above frameworks, Tweag has a special interest in

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Well :( once again need help building a project. I swear I'll get better at this...
 Trying to build this game following the instructions in the Local Install section:
  
git clone https://github.com/sharkdp/cube-composer.git
 cd cube-composer
 npm install
 bower install
 gulp
  
All goes well until I ran gulp. Here's the gulp output. Just my own analysis, looks like there's three things going on
  
36 warnings of deprecated features. However these shouldn't be blockers for the build, correct?
 22 errors referring to the wrap and unwrap typeclass functions not being implemented. Are these blockers? If so, how did this ever work in the first place and how should I fix? I'm seeing many (but not all) of these errors coming from bower_components/ which was simply the tool in step #4 above used to build the project, and not from the project itself. Should I try rebuilding without bower? Any recommendation on what to run to do this?
 Then it seems to continue compiling before failing completely with a traceback at the end.
  
Would love any advice on how to build this. What do I need to do please?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On the zettelkasten subreddit I came across a post linking to an article on the method (shared by the author of the article). In it he was making some bold proclamations, so I thought I'd ask what this community thought?
The core argument seems to be

  
Today, however, I shall provide one fundamental component of Luhmann's system. This fundamental component is missing from an estimated 96% of digital zettelkastens.
Luhmann outlines this fundamental component in the very beginning of his paper on how his zettelkasten works.

    
Information is an intra-systematic event. It results when one compares one message or entry with regard to other possibilities. Information, accordingly, originates only in systems which possess a comparative schema—even if this amounts only to: "this or something else."

  
  
You see, built into every single note in Luhmann's system is one requirement: he must decide where the note belongs. It forces associations, and associations stand as the fundamental building block of human memory. One must decide if the note is associated with this or something else. It is a comparative schema built into the very root of Luhmann's antinet zettelkasten, which surfaces the magic of his system.
Unfortunately, this fundamental component is watered down to near extinction in the world of digital zettelkastens.


(Source: https://daily.scottscheper.com/num/243/)
The idea of "must decide where the note belongs", while true, misses the point of multiple context within the zettelkasten, as Luhmann was trying to come up with an alternative to filing notes using folders. Or is he just rehashing the classic Folgzettel Debate?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone,
I usually take a ton of notes from narrative non-fiction books I read: story ideas, research etc... Those should be considered "literature notes" in the context of zettelkasten. I find it confusing having these notes in a single file, so I split them by topic or anecdote. But I don't like to have my computer crammed with tons of files. When I read a new book on the same topic, rather than creating new notes and linking them, I tend to group the notes I already have with new notes who adds info to the same topic or details to the same anecdote. Still, I keep a reference to the original source (in the form of citation).
To better explain what I do:
I read a book about a writer and I take a note on an episode of his life (which we'll call NOTE 1).
Another episode of his life goes to a different note (NOTE 2) in the same folder.
I read another book and I find some detail on the same episode as NOTE 1. I don't create a new note but I add it to NOTE 1 and eventually add a citation for the new source.
I read a book about a chemist and I take a note about one of his discoveries in the specific folder of that book/project. It isn't directly related to the episode of NOTE 1, but I think linking them can bring to a new perspective. I create NOTE 3 and link NOTE 1 and NOTE 3.
Is that a good practice, or is it better to have a single file for the notes coming from a book, then different super short notes for concepts I want to keep from each book?]]></summary>

I do not understand the concept of backlinks. What is it and how to use it?
From the meaning of the word I would assume that a "backlink" would create a 1to1 relation by default.
But in "B" is a new and automatic created link (back) to "A", too.
So what is backlinking about?]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Every now and then I come across a situation in which I need to transform a sequence of elements, say a List, but the transformation isn't independent for each element and I would need to keep additional state during the loop to perform the transformations I need.
 Let me try to give a simple example. In C# I could write something like
  private static List<object> transformSomeElementFirstTimeItOccurs(List<object> list) { bool done = false; var result = new List<object>(); foreach (var elem in list) { if (!done && elem is SomeType) { result.Add(transformElement(elem)); done = true; } else { result.Add(elem); } } return result; } 
 My naieve attempt at achieving this in PureScript currently looks as follows.
  transformSomeElementFirstTimeItOccurs :: List ElemType -> List ElemType transformSomeElementFirstTimeItOccurs elems = reverse (loop elems).result where loop :: List ElemType -> { done :: Boolean , result :: List ElemType } loop = foldl (\{ result, done } elem -> case elem of SomeValueConstructor t -> { result : SomeValueConstructor (if done then t else transformValue t):result , done : true } _ -> { result : elem:result, done }) { result : Nil, done : false } 
 But it feels like it could use some improvement. Is there an idiomatic way to do this kind of thing?

 , dependencies = [ "console" , "effect" , "prelude" , "psci-support" , "debug" , "css" , "arrays" , "integers" , "maybe" , "tuples" , "halogen" , "foldable-traversable" ] 
 Running build again I get the following errors: https://pastebin.com/cUutNNn4
 What, why? Debug.Trace comes from package debug and Halogen.HTML.CSS comes from package halogen, both of which I have there.
 What do I need to do please?
 Is there any tool that can take a look at the import statements used in a project and solve the dependencies based on that?

I'm looking for a library/package that would provide the drawing functionality for me to minimise development time. I'm thinking of functionality somewhat like Microsoft Visio (e.g. place shapes, connect shapes, move shapes, autorouting of connectors etc.). 
 Are there any libraries/packages either natively or wrapped in purescript? Failing that, are there any suitable javascript libraries I could use through FFI?
 Everything I've found myself is either a dead project, intended for data display (i.e. graphs), static (i.e. closer to MS Paint than Visio) or contains too much functionality (e.g. more general rendering libraries for games or multimedia). I'd rather not roll my own if I can help it :)
 Any help or advice you could provide would be appreciated.
