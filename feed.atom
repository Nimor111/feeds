        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to move away from using bespoke query building logic in a Haskell service at work. My impression from surveying some of the popular options (Beam, Persistent, Opaleye...) is that while they have tools to pull schemas and synchronize with your database, they still require you to manually declare types corresponding to tables. 
 This Haskell service is however one of many accessing the database and the schema changes somewhat frequently, so manually keeping types in sync isn't ideal. In the parts of our codebase that are written in TypeScript we use libraries like prisma and prisma-kysely to generate type definitions and the experience has been pretty good. 
 Is there anything like this in the Haskell space? My hope is that I wouldn't need to manually edit type definitions if someone else at the company adds a table or changes a column somewhere in the DB.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Basically, I've stayed at my job for 6 years. In my country there were at some point max 3 - 4 companies using Scala, even not full time, and now it is even rarer. When I got my first interview for a international remote job I had about 1.5 years of Scala experience, but 4 years total experience. I went pretty far but didn't get it because lack of experience. After that, I've had up to a dozen of these kinds of interviews, for a remote international team, but I never managed to get a job. Now finally I have found a new job but it is not a great project and not what I want.
 I am not the most enthusiastic person when it comes always being up to date and reading blogs and stuff and also for the past years, I have not been a person who got assigned to the more complex stuff in my company. Otherwise I have a pretty good basis for algorithms and coding challenges (although I failed the last one which was live coding using lots of Scala generics).
 Now, it seems to me that when recruiting for a remote team, especially for a senior position, the stands for a Scala developer are pretty high and the projects are not simple (relatively, like more distributed stuff).
 Does anyone have more insights how this compares to other languages. A lot of people that I know which I wold think were at my level as a developer or even sub, got remote jobs or jobs away from my country, and I am feeling stuck. I keep wondering if it would have been easier to find this kind of remote job if i stayed with C# or moved to Java, and not due to lack of opportunities in the Scala world....

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm pretty new to Haskell, enjoying developing a web app using Scotty, but I'm struggling to figure out how I can launch (background) async IO operations.
 For example, let's say I have a handle function:
 ```haskell longBackgroundIOStuff :: IO () ...
 handleSomething :: ActionM () handleSomething conn = do my_param :: String <- pathParam "my_param" -- I want to start this running liftIO $ longBackgroundIOStuff -- and then immediately respond to the client a redirect redirect "/" ```
 But then it has to wait for the longBackgroundIOStuff before redirect. If I put the redirect before the IO operation the IO operation never runs. I've also tried craziness like.
 ``` import Control.Concurrent.Async (concurrently_)
 handleSomething :: ActionM () handleSomething conn = do liftIO $ concurrently_ (liftIO $ longBackgroundIOStuff) (return (redirect "/")) ```
 But then the redirect never gets back to the client.
 I don't need to return anything related to the longBackgroundIOStuff, I just want it to start running in the background and keep running until it's done. 
 Using express with node I could just do something like this:
 js app.get('/', (req, res) => { longAsyncIOFunction(); res.redirect('/') }); 
 What would be the best way to accomplish this with Scotty? Thanks so much and sorry if this isn't the best forum for these kinds of questions.

 instance C () where type D () = Int transform _ i = _
 {-# RULES "specialize\Int" forall x y. funGeneric x y = funSpecialized x y #-} ```
 and then, for instance:
  someFun :: Int -> IO () someFun initial = print $ funGeneric () initial 
 where I'd expect funGeneric to be re-written to funSpecialized The rule itself type-checks, but no matter what I try, it never fires due to:
  
==================== Rule check ==================== 
 Rule check results: 
 Expression: funGeneric
 ($ctransform `cast` <Co:3> :: (() -> D () -> [D ()]) ~R# C ()) () (initial `cast` <Co:3> :: Int ~R# D ()) 
 Rule "specialize\Int": arguments [4] do not match (1-indexing)

 In Scala 2.13 we were using the TypeCase from Shapeless library to overcome type erasure in pattern matching. demonstration:
 private val `Seq[AlertEntity]` = TypeCase[Seq[AlertEntity]] def onGetAlerts(arg: Any): Unit = arg match { case `Seq[AlertEntity]`(alerts) => () } 
 It was pretty convenient.
 Now upgrading to Scala 3 and checking if there a new canonical way to do it or if I should best stay with the current implementation.
 Saw TypeTest but wasn't sure how to use it even for this simple example.

Announcing ghciwatch 1.0 by Rebecca Turner
At Mercury, we’ve developed a file-watching recompiler for Haskell projects called ghciwatch, which loads a GHCi session (a Haskell REPL) and instructs it to reload or add modules when files in your project change. Ghciwatch is very similar in design to Neil Mitchell’s excellent ghcid, but with a few new tricks up its sleeve.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm using emacs to write Common Lisp code, and paredit doesn't respect the syntax of read macros. So, for example, when I write #P or #C or any other dispatch read macro(like my lovely home-brew λ)and open parenthesis or double quotes, it will insert a space before inserting the pair, and I have to double back to erase it. It's a really minor inconvenience, but I'm wondering if there's already a good solution to this problem or if anyone would be interested in improvement to paredit to correct this.
 You can just disable the behavior by adding to your .emacs, or whenever after paredit is loaded, 
 (defun paredit-space-for-delimiter-p (endp delimiter) nil) 
 But obviously this is a bit of a hack, and though I might try this out for now because I haven't ever noticed the space-adding behavior to be useful, I might find I'll miss it when it's gone, and want a more syntax aware paredit. 
 I noticed there's also a paredit-space-for-delimiter-predicates variable which you could use(or just use to disable the behavior in a less hacky way), but I would need to somehow query slime/swank to to robustly find out what the active read macros are(and I don't know how to do that at the moment), as well as actually parse them(which is messy but doable).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi folks,
 This is a package (early WIP, but usable for now) that enables formatting code in buffers via text properties.
 Long story short, it allows you to use any formatting function/command (like format-all-buffer or apheleia-format-buffer) to visually format the code in the buffer without actually modifying it. This is acheived by changing the text properties of the code with the spaces taken from the formatted code.
 This can be useful when working in a team and the codebase is poorly formatted, or when you don't like the coding style and you want to view the code in the style you like.
 This can be seen as an ~equivalent~ to Resharper's Virtual Formatter, which I just heard about when I started working on this package, but never used it actually.
 The current implementation requires treesit, so you will need Emacs 29+ with Tree Sitter support.

Since I give my habits specific time slots during a day (I'm trying to be consistent of WHEN I do my habits), it would be nice to have them show up in relation to the current time.
 So I'm considering just removing the habit style and just setting them up as recurring scheduled TODOs but I want to confirm there aren't other beneficial features to keeping it as a habit that I might not be aware of.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I run many Elisp scripts on my org-node zettelkasten, which is 2000+ Org files. So I've had plenty of situations where I hit this old nugget:
  File mode specification error: (file-error Cannot open load file Too many open files debug) 
 Now I'm wondering why. I take care to kill the buffer on each iteration, but it doesn't seem to matter. But! If I let a function process only 500 files, then finish, then run it again for the next 500 and so on, it works out. Is the call stack holding on to all file descriptors opened by children?
 Anyway, a problem I cannot solve: I have no insight into the org-publish codebase, and recently I found that the count of files I want to publish has exceeded 1024. So now I cannot publish. Has anyone worked around that? My publish code.
 Root of the issue 
 On Linux you might think the issue is ulimit -n which defaults to 1024 (on Debian at least), but it turns out that even if you increase that then Emacs will just die. The base problem sounds like a compiled-in FD_SETSIZE value of 1024.
 Last year it seems someone tried to patch it: https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2022-05/msg00115.html but this person says it just made Emacs unresponsive.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have just had this idea and I think it'd be pretty useful. Knowing emacs, there's a good change that either it's already a package or a snippet exists online. 
 The idea is this. After entering a command, say M-x compile <long compiler query>, I decide that I want it to be easily repeatable. So I then invoke a hypothetical M-x bind-last-command-to and it prompts for a key, say I now press <f5>. Now that compile command is bound to <f5>.
 I guess this is kind of like macros, but you bind it after the fact. And it is for a single command (even if it only worked for the last M-x compile it'd still be useful).
 Anyone know if it exists before I start trying to implement it myself? Thanks.

 Are there any elisp magicians who know how to make it automatically prefer the C file in this case and jump to it directly without opening a buffer with the choices, and maybe also display a message "both .c and .h files found; using the .c" or similar?
 Or anyone could point me to the docs for this kind of thing, I'm a bit lost.

 I’ve managed to setup lsp-mode with Omnisharp and enabled decompilation, so I am able to use “go to definition” on .NET system types and external class libraries that are referred to in my project as nuget packages. 
 However if I have a class A in an external nuget package, and let’s say it refers to another type in another nuget package or a .NET system type, then I can’t go to definition from within class A to these types. 
 Rider allows me to do this, but Omnisharp can’t and this is one of the most useful features I use in Rider when debugging or trying to understand the code, and is the one thing that prevents me from going full Emacs for my C# development. 
 Is this a limitation in Omnisharp or can somebody share how to set this up, so I can decompile also referenced code from within a referenced nuget package?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Basically, i'm working on moving the final pieces to org note taking. Many people recommend using git for notes. And on the surface this makes sense. It's easy to use, automatic history and off device. But how do you deal with Personal Information in your Notes? Some of it might not be particularly interesting, but when you start using Due Dates and make Tasks on where to go, or whome you interact with, this could be different. Maybe you take a reminder to pick up some medication specific to a Illness you have.
 This might be even more of a problem if you use Org notes at work. Certainly most companies wouldn't want you to commit customer data to github/lab.
 So, how do you deal with this? So far the obvious thing is to keep Notes that are work related in their own folder and either not sync that or keep it on our own hosted gitlab instance.
 With personal notes this is a tougher call. I want them on two PCs and my phone. My experience with Syncthing over three devices in the past has been less than stelar. Any other recommendations that work reliably so i can finally leave google keep and todoist behind? (And yes, i know it's a bit ironic to care about personal information in org files in a git repo, when it's currently all on google and todoist servers. But i want to improve things ;) )

A while ago I was reading the following post:
https://forum.zettelkasten.de/discussion/1574/just-started-already-lost-in-clutter-how-do-you-prevent-to-get-lost-in-so-many-notes-and-links/p1
From the feedback it is clear that you should split your note taking into different steps, by using some sort of workflow.
I'm not arguing against this, but I would like to know how this community spreads this over time. Like for example do you have daily or weekly reviews or something entirely different?
The reason I ask is because most of the time at work, like most of you :-), my day is pretty full and I'm trying to figure out how to organize my day and/or week to incorporate this workflow.
Thank you]]></summary>

I am retouching my section on the Zettelkasten (within my Zettelkasten), and I am having a hard time finding the source for the following claim, which is that Luhmann stopped using his Zettelkasten in his late years and instead focused on churning out manuscripts as fast as he could, perhaps given that he knew his life was coming to an end due to his illnesses. I cannot for the life of me find the source to this claim (which conveys my inability to properly execute the ZK method, as the claim, without its source, is noted down in one of my notes). But, anyway, I would really appreciate it if someone familiar with this could point me to a direction. I am also starting to believe that I made this up in my mind and convinced myself that I heard or read it somewhere, haha, even though I find it more probable that I heard about this in a podcast.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Disclaimer: noob. I use org-mode and evil-mode extensively for notes and generally want text to wrapped at say 80 lines (easier readability, better use of screen-real estate when you're using a tiling window manager or a terminal multiplexer). For those who do something similar, looking for some advice:
  
For wrapping text, can someone share a binding to toggle using text width of 80 and/off? Also useful to visually select text and set that to wrap at text width of 80 if you don't want the all text wrapped in the file. For the latter, I often visually select the text and use a binding for fill-region-as-paragraph but this joins paragraphs separated by a line. 
 
This:
  
This is some notes blah blah blah
 
  
looks better than this
 - This is some notes blah blah blah 
 , right? I find myself needing to manually adjust for the former--how to have it be done automatically?
  
Do you have wrap at column 80 for everything? I feel like if you have text at several indents deep, those lines are too short because they still get wrapped at column 80. I'm wondering if perhaps wrapping at 80 characters starting from first non-space character to the last character on the line might be better, but I'm not sure of any editors that allow for this behavior by default and in this case it would be better to stick with consistent behavior vs. some custom solution that might not cover all edge cases.
  
Much appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I'm upgrading a project from Scala 2.13 to Scala 3.
 In the project we have many enums implemented using traits and case objects such as:
 sealed trait ClientRole object ClientRole extends EnumExtender[ClientRole] { case object User extends ClientRole case object Device extends ClientRole } 
 in the base class, EnumExtender, the values method is implemented using TypeTag in the following way:
 abstract class EnumExtender[ENUM_BASE: TypeTag : ClassTag] { ... private val typesMap = allTypes final def values: List[ENUM_BASE] = typesMap.values.toList private def allTypes = { val tpe = ru.typeOf[ENUM_BASE] val clazz = tpe.typeSymbol.asClass val mirror = runtimeMirror(classTag[ENUM_BASE].runtimeClass.getClassLoader) if (!clazz.isSealed || (!clazz.isTrait && !clazz.isAbstract)) { throw new NoSuchElementException(...) } getSubclasses(clazz).filter(_.isModuleClass).map(t => { val module = mirror.staticModule(t.fullName) val i = mirror.reflectModule(module).instance.asInstanceOf[ENUM_BASE] i.toString -> i }).toMap } private def getSubclasses(symbol: Symbol): Seq[Symbol] = { def children = symbol.asClass.knownDirectSubclasses.flatMap(getSubclasses) symbol match { case s if s.isModuleClass => Seq(s) case s if s.isClass => Seq(s) ++ children } } } 
 TypeTag is no longer supported, so I'm looking for a way to achieve the same functionality, i.e. implementation for the values method.
 I can freely make changes to the EnumExtender base class, but I would like to avoid forcing changes on the actual enum subclasses.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have two Linux computers and a Windows computer. I use Emacs on all of them. 
 I've been looking for at handy way to share the Emacs configuration file between the computers. The basic step consists in letting the .emacs file on each computer load a common configuration file from a shared directory in Dropbox. With this in place, if I make a customization change on one computer, it is automatically available to the others.
 At least in theory.
 The challenge is that this sharing of a configuration file causes a lot of problems, because in many cases I want different configurations on the three computers. For example:
  
Path names to files will be different on my Linux and Windows computer.
 Font names are different.
 I have some project-specific configuration for a project that exists on one computer, but not on the others.
  
Also, if I install a new Emacs package on one computer, it will not get automatically installed on the others, and this may cause configuration problems.
 All of this can be solved by a very strict discipline about what goes where in various configuration files. But what I'd really like to know is this: Has any of you successfully created such a setup that actually works very well? If so, what insight can you share?

 I am looking for inspiration/ideas for my master's thesis. I will have a year to do it and I am familiar with Haskell, FP and PL theory (with a little bit of language-based security). I don't mind doing front-end GUI stuff either.
 I would love to pick your brains' imagination on something that would be interesting and useful to work on (implementation in Haskell of course :)). Or if you could point me to papers that contain ideas that can be explored in a Master's thesis.

 I have tried “e” to enable it, as well as M-x xwidget-webkit-edit-mode, as well as (add-hook ‘xwidget-webkit-mode ‘xwidget-webkit-edit-mode). Nothing seems to work; none of my key presses register and they seem to still execute commands. I thought it might be evil-mode, but disabling that doesn’t help (now everything echoes <k> is undefined). Does anyone know what the problem might be?
 As well, videos infinitely load. I know this is a known bug but it seemed as though it might have gotten fixed; I’m wondering if I’m missing some packages, I’m on alpine so a relatively minimal set of packages out of the box. 
 Thank you!

 I ran into a problem with configuration, caused by a malformed database path for a certain package. This causes a problem in emacsql, because it tries to treat the folder name as a file, but the error message is not descriptive at all.
 The more generic question is, how exactly should the user configuration be validated, i.e. I can of course add a check at the beginning of a function that uses it and it works fine, but I'm sure I'm not the first one who thinks about it and there is likely a more elegant/standard way of doing it and maybe some guidelines?
 Current, not very informative error:
 ⛔ Error (use-package): org-roam/:init: EmacSQL had an unhandled condition: sqlitep, nil
 A primitive check:
 (if (file-directory-p org-roam-db-location) (error (format "org-roam-db-location %S should be file, not folder " org-roam-db-location)))

 Two people have already reported issues on Windows on the repo, but the difference is that they were on the native build (which works perfectly fine for me w.r.t. elcord). I made an issue, but I suppose the owner abandoned the repo, so I am asking the community for some help. Is anyone in my situation?
 My suspicion is that the sock isn't being created properly and as such elcord keeps trying to reconnect, which it will never success because the sock won't be created.

I was looking for tutorials to learn Emacs, but decided to learn Neovim first because it has easy-to-follow tutorials on YouTube. Although Emacs has the best beginner-friendly documentation, it is extensive and overwhelming. I need guidance on how to navigate these documents and where to start. I found a YouTuber with an Emacs playlist, but I have trouble understanding his content. 
 I only have an hour a day to learn, but I need to get my work done. Please advise on how to learn Org mode to start taking notes.

 Can this be done in emacs? I know that i could write a new function that makes the new window for me before running find-file, but that way i'd have two "find-file" functions depending on wether i want a new window or not, which is more mental overhead. I also couldn't figure out what function is run when hitting Return on a find-file entry in the minibuffer.
 Any way to set up a bind/function that does what i'm looking for?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi! persp-project bridges perspective mode to the built-in project.el library. The idea is to create a separate perspective when switching projects. A perspective is an independent workspace for Emacs, similar to multiple desktops in Gnome and MacOS. This integration allows you to easily know which project you're currently in, and focus on files that only belong to the current project when switching buffers.
 ⚠️ NOTE: This package has come to life adapting the great package persp-projectile by Bozhidar Batsov with ChatGPT. I didn't write a single line of code. What inspired me to create this package is my recent effort to avoid most third party packages, specially if they prefer a newly defined interface over the built-in Emacs interface.
 Also special shutout to Natalie Weizenbaum for making such a great package!
 I would appreciate any feedback, I'll try to submit the package to MELPA next.

 And no completions show up.
 Auto-completion works with elisp (which comes by default I suppose), but not with c/c++.
 Also when I do M-x company-diag It says:

 (I tried to type #include)
 I am using Linux Mint with Emacs version 27.1. I also tried to use Emacs 29 but it doesn't work there either, It gives an error saying:

 Did anyone have this issue and is it worth solving it or should I just use auto-complete?

 I worked in win, mac, gentoo, debian, redhat and for every circumstance i used different prebuilt ide like eclipse, visual studio and jetbrains, and vim with minimum knowledge for server management (copy, delete, regex replace... and i really hate counting!!!!)
 Now i use VSCode that is perfect for all my needs : project managements, rust developing, integrated terminal, docker and k8s integration.
 The only problem is that it becomes a ram eating machine and since i am non confident with websites like "downloadmoreram.com", i would like to switch to another editor.
 The lack of an integrated terminal will not be a problem but a tree on the side is fundamental.
 Did you suggest me to start from scratch with the emacs manual or a prebuilt env like doom?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've posted about the ekg notetaking app for emacs before. After a brief hiatus, I'm back working on it, and I'm pretty excited about the latest changes.
 A few weeks ago I also put out a new version of llm with a new module, llm-prompt, which allows templatized prompts that have easy and effective context filling, something that hasn't existed yet in any emacs module, AFAIK. The new version of ekg uses this new feature.
 Previously, the ekg-llm library would send the contents of the note, along with instructions to the LLM, which would then append to the note. Now, we also send the latest notes with the same tags, and similar notes, as part of the llm request context. This turns out to be a really important enhancement to the quality of the llm responses, and now using ekg is, IMHO, the best way to interact with LLMs. You can also edit the responses before you save them into a note (or just not save them at all). This is something else that can help improve the response quality. At times, the responses I'm getting are really magical - it really is what many people call a "second brain", but for real. I find myself using it constantly as a default way to interact with LLMs.
 I give an intro to ekg and talk about using it as a "second brain" in this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC_h3syRKro
 The other improvements to this version of ekg are primarily Markdown improvements (using markdown instead of org-mode is kind of necessary if you are using it to talk to llms), fixing issues and getting inline links to work.

 There are various ways to frame this problem:
  
finding a way to "compose" serveWithContext
 passing data from one combinator to another
 and probably others
  
Does anyone know if it is actually possible as I've run into a bit of a wall.

 I started configuring it and the first thing I did is install evil-mode, so I can have nice Vim keybindings.
 I installed it with ELPA, and the installation seemed to work without any issues. The error shows up when I try to use the evil-mode package, with:
 M-x evil-mode

 This is the error Emacs prompts me:
 Warning (comp): evil-vars.el:561:25: Warning: the function `evil-delete-backward-word' is not known to be defined.

Is there any consensus in community how to tackle problem of auth? I found some abandoned JWT libs, and the ones that are maintained are fairly unpopular. I guess this is the problem when you want to use well known and battle tested solution so using some Java libs seems like a no brainer. On the other hand using Java libs sacrifices a little bit of pure FP approach. What are you using on production with Typelevel stack to implement auth these days?

 Some fonts have alternative characters behind character variants (cv), stylistic sets (ss), or other (onum, zero), and it would be very nice not to have to use an external tool to modify the fonts by hand to use them.
 It is almost a requirement to use certain fonts: their g and r are just weird, but FiraCode with the default @ and & is unusable :P
 It is supported in LaTeX (maybe only LuaLaTeX's fontspec?), and by the enemy...

 It seems that TypeScript support is enabled gracefully with js and lsp module in init.el
 But C#... I can't understand. Anyone been able to enable it?
 EDIT: for people coming here in the future: (csharp +lsp) in init.el will enable lsp auto start in csharp files. BUT you need a language server. First time opening .cs file do M-x lsp, it will suggest you to install language server. Roslyn (csharp-roslyn) did NOT work for me, so I installed omnisharp. It worked :D

 I wish to sort directories before files, within the Completions buffer. This buffer is shown when executing C-x C-f TAB TAB, and should be done within a directory that contains directories and folders.
 The ls command has the option --group-directories-first, which is the behaviour I would like to achieve within the Completions buffer.
 Any insight is appreciated.

When the cursor is on Hebrew text, it becomes completely invisible.
 This only occurs with the cursor type set to 'bar'.
 The 'box' cursor type works without issues.
 There's a similar, but slightly different issue with Arabic text.
  
I use Emacs 29.3 for Mac. Changing font and bidi settings haven't solved the issue. Now I have no clue where to look for solution 
 Here is a short video to illustrate the problem.

 "doom eamcs recent files when i change dir of my file i want recent file to remove the old location entry"
 chatGPT gave me the code
 ```
 ;; Function to remove old file path from recentf list (defun remove-recentf-entry-if-moved (oldpath newpath) "Remove OLD-PATH from recentf-list if file is moved to NEWPATH." (recentf-edit-list) (setq recentf-list (cl-delete-if (lambda (path) (string-equal path oldpath)) recentf-list)) (recentf-save-list))

 ```
 adding this code to me config file gave me the following unneeded behaviour
  
whenever i try to quit recentf-edit-list opens
 whenever i save a file the saved file is removed from recent file
  
I didn't want that so i just removed the code ran doom/reload yet the issue remained. The config file is clearly devoid of the code provided to me by chatGPT .
 After that failed i ran doom sync and then doom/reload still no change.
 I thought f#ck it and just reverted back to my previous commit and the issue still remains.
 Now i dont know what to do anymore.
 Please help as i just started getting into emacs 3 days ago and not good enough yet to deal with this myself.
 This is the value of my after-save-hook
 ```
 (diff-hl-update +emacs-lisp-non-package-mode flycheck-handle-save t ws-butler-after-save) Original value was nil Local in buffer config.el; global value is (doom-modeline-update-vcs doom-modeline-update-buffer-file-name #f(compiled-function () #<bytecode 0x96b404426f0cb9f>) +evil-display-vimlike-save-message-h doom-auto-revert-buffers-h doom-guess-mode-h)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I appreciate all the dev work that's gone into making HLS possible. It's capabilities are way beyond what I experienced back when I was last writing Haskell and has made it so much easier to quickly look up documentation and get autocomplete without having to scroll through hackage documentation for all of the functions and types that I forget.
 However, my experience using it with neovim has been less than stellar. I seem to have nothing but issues with it, and I can't tell if it's a neovim problem or an HLS problem. I'm using the haskell-tools.nvim plugin with the standard nvim-cmp and lspconfig plugins. Most other language servers work reasonably well, but this one seems particularly finicky and I can't figure out why.
 I'm currently having an issue where if I type anything for about 4-6 seconds after opening the first haskell file in the editor (while the language server is starting) it causes HLS to completely hang and become unresponsive. I'm also having issues with nvim-cmp screaming at me about misplaced dollar signs in snippets (I'm assuming because the haskell suggestions contain things like $ and $!).
 I decided to temporarily install vscode to see if that would do it. Everything worked completely flawlessly out of the box, absolutely no issues. The problem is, I would really rather not use vscode if I don't absolutely have to.
 Has anyone been able to get a working config for haskell in neovim that plays nice? I'm thinking of maybe scrapping haskell-tools and configuring things directly to see if that helps, otherwise I've spent so much time fiddling with the editor that I may have to leave it and come back later when things improve.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I have recently started learning Haskell and I am finding it incredibly interesting. This coming year, I will have to complete a programming project as part of my qualification as a student. I have taken to the idea of using Haskell for this task, but I have gotten stuck on any ideas for the project. I'm aware of the nature of Haskell and how it's used in production, but am still stuck for ideas. Could anyone give me any project ideas? What have you personally developed in Haskell? What other Haskell projects do you use/find interesting? What aspects of Haskell do you find interesting to work with yourself? What sort of projects should I avoid?
 I am sorry if you have seen these types of posts frequently, but I could not find anything that was particularly useful to me. 
 Thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So my understanding of how API calls work in Haskell is something like this — The API request data that comes over the network is just a string(correct me if I'm wrong) and it gets converted into haskell record types by Aeson, that we can use in our applications.
 Now, Aeson uses instance declarations like below to convert the data to the record types.
 instance FromJSON MyType where parseJSON = ... 
 I can see from hoogle that the type of parseJSON is parseJSON :: Value -> Parser a, so the string that came over the network seems to have already been converted into a Value type.
 My question is how does the string type gets converted into Value type and where? If I want to do some transformation or validation on this string value, how can I go about it?

 Whenever I star Emacs and open any org-file with #+startup: overview for the first time, I can't expand any headings. And I can't figure out why. Executing normal-mode or org-mode with the same buffer has no effect. I have to close it and re-open it again. 
 I'm using Doom, but I rolled my own module, I'm not using the "official" Org module. Maybe this is an issue with straight.el? I don't know, I'm trying to manually call the commands - org-fold-reveal, org-cycle, and even org-reload (that reloads all of org.el Lisp files) etc. Nothing's working.
 Does anyone else have the same problem? Can anyone give any suggestions how to troubleshoot this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What is effect? I asked ChatGPT and it gave me various answers:
  
Effect types are any types of kind Type -> Type.
 Effect types are types of kind Type -> Type that have an instance of Functor.
 Effect types are types of kind Type -> Type that have an instance of Applicative.
  
Sometimes it insists that a computation f a (where f is a functor) does not have an effect, only a context. To have a computational effect, there must be function application involved, so it uses terms like functorial context, applicative effect and monadic effect. However, it confuses me because the functor (->) a represents function application, as with State s and Reader r.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, I've been playing a bit with the ideas from the trees that grow paper, and I've stumbled into something I don't quite get.
 Consider the following silly existential:
 type family SomeX (tag :: Type ) (x :: Type) :: Type data Some tag x where Some :: SomeX tag x -> x -> Some tag () 
 If we let:
 -- Proof carries a prof for `psi a` data Proof (psi :: k -> Constraint) (a :: k) where P :: psi a => Proof psi a 
 Then we can "inject" constraints by:
 data Foo type instance SomeX Foo x = (Proof Show x) 
 But, if I try to make a pattern, it throws a compilation error:
 -- Doesn't work 'x' does not unify with 'x1' pattern SomeFoo :: (Show x) => x -> Some Foo () pattern SomeFoo x = Some P x 
 I thought that this unidirectional pattern is supposed to work as an ordinary (possibly smart) constructor. If i "downgrade" it to an ordinary function, it compiles as expected:
 someFoo :: (Show x) => x -> Some Foo () someFoo x = Some P x

(I feel fairly confident in calling the idea that this improves performance a myth given that Emacs maintainers have frowned upon this practice on this sub)
 Also, are there any other common emacs myths that still go around that should be debunked? I think the idea that using tool-bar-mode or menu-bar-mode hampers your learning of the keyboard shortcuts is unfair and fewer "Intro to Emacs" guides should ask newcomers to turn them off.

 I'm happy to announce the new cognitive-complexity package, it is basically a port of codemetrics (based on tree-sitter) to the built-in treesit in Emacs 29+.
 https://github.com/abougouffa/cognitive-complexity
 The package implements the Cognitive Complexity metric for code, allowing it to calculate a score that describes the understandability of a piece of code.
 It is basically an implementation of Cognitive Complexity - A new way of measuring understandability.
 The original codemetrics package is based on the tree-sitter library, I forked it to port it to treesit so it can be used with Emacs 29+. I tried also to simplify the fork by removing some dependencies like dash and s.
 Looking forward for your feedback!

 https://karthinks.com/software/emacs-window-management-almanac/
 I'd like the layout to look something like this: https://imgur.com/a/5NS7Es4
 But I'm completely lost.
 I understand that I need to set dedicated windows, but I am unable to figure out how Treemacs fits into that.
 If someone could help with the basic layout, I can probably figure out the dedicated buffers/windows configuration. Please help!
 Edited to add: After reading Micky Peterson's guide "Demystifying Emacs' Window Manager" I think I understand the display-buffer-alist better now. I also tried saving a layout to .emacs.desktop and I'm reading through that, too. I think what is causing issues for me is the Treemacs sidebar window is special and doesn't use a window. This is definitely a big ol' can of worms!

 one of the challanges were, that this was a "old" system which had dealt with multiple eras of haskell stuff:
  
I didn't know with which tool I had installed specific parts of the Haskell tool chain (Haskell-plattform, Chocolatte, ghcup, ... etc)
  
So how it went:
  
uninstallation of stack went smooth
 uninstallation of ghcup went smooth
 uninstallation of chocolatte went smooth
  
remark: I allso purged the env-variables of stack/ghcup/chocolatte
  
I'm not sure how I get rid of cabal/ghc(i) whenn using cabal --version in terminal the output is:cabal --versioncabal-install version 3.4.0.0 compiled using version 3.4.0.0 of the Cabal library
  
when using ghc --version in terminal the output is:
 ghc --version //ghci --version has the same output The Glorious Glasgow Haskell Compilation System, version 8.10.7 
 using where.exe in power shell yields:
 where.exe ghci C:\tools\ghc-8.10.7\bin\ghci.exe C:\ProgramData\chocolatey\bin\ghci.exe C:\tools\ghc-9.2.1\bin\ghci.exe where.exe ghc C:\tools\ghc-8.10.7\bin\ghc.exe C:\ProgramData\chocolatey\bin\ghc.exe C:\tools\ghc-9.2.1\bin\ghc.exe where.exe cabal C:\Users\ -censored- \AppData\Roaming\cabal\bin\cabal.exe 
 So:
 would it be sufficient to just simply purge those folders?

Competitive Programming in Haskell: tree path decomposition, part I by Brent Yorgey
In a previous post I challenged you to solve Factor-Full Tree. In this problem, we are given an unlabelled rooted tree, and asked to create a divisor labelling. That is, we must label the vertices with positive integers in such a way that v is an ancestor of u if and only if v’s label evenly divides u’s label.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey guys, I've been a pure Scala engineer for around 6 years now. The stack I've been working with was the typelevel with tagless final so 90% of our code was in the functional style. I got an offer from one of my previous employers for a Senior Java role and as usual they are using the Java Spring enterprise stack. 
 I'm considering the switch because of the better work-life balance, increased pay and more remote friendly. But what's making me doubt is Java. I haven't used Java (or any OOP language) in an production setting before and mainly throughout my career only used functional languages. Has anyone done a similar shift? Like moving from purely functional scala to Java EE style? And if so how was the adjustment? 
 I did a quick read through some Spring code bases and it just seems like most of the work is just using the spring annotations correctly, which I don't really like since it's seems like doing "config" instead of actual coding.
 So anyone with any experience on making a similar switch and how that went?

Enough of shit-talking, I created this discussion to present my workflow.

My current zettelkasten is in fact an evolution of a blog I started ten years ago. Even with my efforts to save this blog over time (manual backup, git) I think I lost a few things.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Greetings, I'm working on my computer science master's thesis and I'm having trouble finding open-source standalone tools or Intellij/VS code plugins that would provide me with code quality metrics through static analysis on package, class, and/or method levels. Most of what I've found were refactoring or lining tools, and a few paid tools/services that would give me somewhat useful metrics. 
 I reckon I could cobble something together that I could use but it would be a significant time investment. So, I figured I could ask the Scala community for recommendations before I start doing it myself. Any suggestions?
 P.S. The list of metrics that I'm interested in isn't that strict, but generally, it should be at least one of these metric sets: Maintainability Index, Halstead metrics, QMOOD metrics, MOOD metrics, and a few others.
 P.P.S. "MetricsTree" would be an ideal tool if it weren't capable of handling only Java source code. I thought about compiling scala code and then decompiling class files into Java source code but that can skew the metrics too much.

 As I'm using Ivy, I thought, and somehow expected, to be able to achieve the same result. So I tried mu u i. Ivy suggested many mu4e commands, but mu4e-update-index was not near the top.
 As I've learned since, completion-styles, set to (basic partial-completion emacs22), explains how mu-u-i matches.
 Ivy uses its own "completion styles" that are different from the default ones. The default is ivy--regex-plus.
 Now, it's not like Ivy is not matching the command, but it's definitely not in the top results. Thus, using it requires more keys.
 Question: Is it possible to make Ivy matcher work closer to partial-completion or initials completion styles?

 Now, Emacs is never going to be as fast as simpler editors. However, most of the time you shouldn't be able to notice any slowness. All this suggests to me that lots of people are doing things sub-optimally. I have used Emacs for more a very long time. Here I'll give some advice on speed. I haven't deliberately optimized my Emacs setup for speed, but I have avoided things that make it slow.
 Firstly, there are some things that you can't really change....
  
The speed of external programs like Git.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Working with my Zettelkasten constantly evolves, as my needs change over time. It seems to be an endless journey to improve my personal knowledge management system. By chance, I discovered "Wardley Mapping" by Simon Wardley [1]. It's a method for understanding how to develop your strategies. My first idea to learn more about this visual tool was to apply it to my Zettelkasten strategy.
Let's take a closer look. A Wardley map allows us to visualize the **Evolution **of business components over time. It starts from the unstable beginnings to more stable, standardized components. These components fall into four stages: genesis, custom, product, and commodity.
First: Genesis components are novel and new. Second: Custom components exist for a specific use case with some proof of value. Third: P…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developing a Wardley Map for using a Zettelkasten in my personal knowledge management involves outlining several components to understand and strategize my approach effectively:
Purpose: Efficiently manage and leverage personal knowledge for continuous learning and productivity.
Scope: Digital note-taking, linking ideas, research support, excluding team collaboration.
User: Primarily self.
User Needs: Quick note capture, efficient organization with tagging and linking, easy retrieval.
Value Chain: From user to Zettelkasten.
Wardley Map: Helps to visualize the different components and their current state in the evolution, guiding where to focus efforts to improve my personal knowledge management system.
And here is my story: I started my changes to improve my personal knowledge management system by moving from OneNote to Obsidian two years ago (1). The major change was my first contact with the Zettelkasten framework (2). It was hard for me to change my personal organization from thinking in "folders" to "tagging" (3). My current challenge is to use analytical reading to improve my notes (4).
What will the next steps be? What are your recommendations?

 I work as a sysadmin and it is a common occurrence that I have to execute a command on a number of hosts (or a number of files) simultanously. What I currently do is have several buffers open at once and then switch to each buffer, make my change, go to the next buffer -- which, you can guess, is very tedious.
 After searching for a bit, I found the wonderful BROADCAST-MODE which allows you to do this for visible buffers. And indeed, it works just fine for regular text buffers. However, I was saddened to find out it doesn't seem to work with VTERM, my terminal emulator of choice within emacs.
 Is there another mode I have failed to find? Is there a configuration settings I forgot to tweak? I'd love to hear your suggestions.
 Have a good day, fellows :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am making this post for anyone else who might get stuck and need some help.
 I cloned the Emacs and Tree-sitter repos and decided to build the latest version of each on Fedora 37. While attempting to compile Emacs, I ran into several very frustrating build issues.
 My first issue was that while running ./configure --with-tree-sitter --with-native-compilation I kept getting an error saying that tree-sitter could not be found. The version that was available from dnf was too old, so I decided to clone the tree-sitter repo and compile it myself. In spite of tree-sitter building without issue, it was still failing to register with the Emacs configure script.
 The solution ended up being to first runldconfig after tree-sitter is done compiling:
 sudo ldconfig /usr/local/lib
 Then, to ensure that the emacs configure script finds it, export the path:
 export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig
 Then you can runmake && sudo make installand everything should work.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to figure out a nice way to express arrays of composite values, like (a, b, c). For a variety of reasons I want to represent this with a composite of simple arrays, so for example an array of (a, b, c) would actually be structured as (array a, array b, array c). This is nice because zip- and unzip- like operations essentially become free. As I understand it, Data.Vector.Unboxed does something like this, although I don't get quite how it works. For this particular application Data.Vector.Unboxed is not suitable however as I'm making this array library specifically for an FFI which requires pinned memory.
 What I want to do is define composite types in a simliar way to how a value level list might be,
 comp = a:b:c:[] 
 so that it can be transformed by applying a type level function to each element
 map f (a:b:c:[]) == f a:f b:f c:[] 
 My current thinking is that it might be possible to express this type of transform on the type level somehow, but It's not clear to me how.
 The purpose of this would be to have a neat way to relate the element type to the array type, so I'd have something like
 CompArray (a <:> b <:> c <:> ()) ~ Array a <:> Array b <:> Array c <:> () 
 Any ideas on how to express this, or is it not possible to do this kind of type level programming in Haskell?

 From what I understand, to get any kind of useful IDE features in VS Code, you need to use Scala Metals, but Scala metals only works with sbt 1.0+? 
 I tried running some basic metals commands and they don't seem to exist for my version of sbt. Is there any sub 1.0+ version that supports metals? What is my best option here? 
 Or am I just making stuff up and I have no idea what I'm talking about?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently I switched from vim to emacs, and I'm building my configuration as I go. I configured most of the editor as I needed it. but there are some custom actions that I don't know how to achieve in emacs. 
 Basically I had custom functions for fuzzy finder (in my case it was fzf) to call an external program for list of data (i.e. the stdout lines) and select the line using the fuzzy finder then pass it to another external program which returned the path of the file and then I could use edit command to open that file in a new buffer.
 I want to do the same thing in emacs mini-buffer but I don't know where to start. I've read the chapter about completion in the emacs manual but could not understand anything...
 It worth mentioning that I use vertico, marginalia and ordderless packages and It would be nice to use the marginalia to show more information about the items / files.

 Started getting into emacs, and trying to get mu4e to work nicely with my university email, which unfortunately is provided by google. So far I've managed to get the receiving part working by invoking oama, but I can't get the smtp part working. Using this configuration:
  (make-mu4e-context :name "EMTA" :match-func (lambda (msg) (when msg (string-prefix-p "/emta"(mu4e-message-field msg :maildir)))) :vars '((user-mail-address . "myemail@uni.ee") (user-full-name . "Kenneth Flak") (smtpmail-smtp-server . "smtp.gmail.com") (smtpmail-auth-credentials . (secrets-get-secret "Default keyring" "oama - myemail@gmail.com")) (smtpmail-stream-type . ssl) (smtpmail-smtp-service . 465) ... etc...  I am pretty sure the culprit is the smtpmail-auth-credentials part, but I don't know enough elisp yet to debug.
 Any help much appreciated!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have built emacs from git before. I want to build it from master with the same options I used last time. The variable system-configuration-options has the value "--with-json --with-xwidgets --with-tree-sitter". So I pulled from the repo, and checked out master (I checked this had worked and the last commit in my local repo is from three hours ago). I ran make clean to clean the repo, then ./autogen.sh, and then ./configure --with-json --with-xwidgets --with-tree-sitter, literally just copying in the flags that my current emacs tells me I used to configure the build last time. ./configure runs, but the first and lines of the output say configure: WARNING: unrecognized options: --with-json.
 I'm not sure what to do about this. I want to build with proper json support like I currently have. I can't find anything in NEWS or the changelogs about this build option being deprecated, and searching the devel list archives doesn't bring up anything.
 Questions: - why is this option not recogized? - how should I configure my build to get proper json support?
 TIA!

When I click a mouse on the frame, or switch frames, the tooltip either pops up, or displays in the echo area. And stays there far longer than the tooltip-hide-delay (set to one second,). Emacs accepts no inputs for as long as ten seconds unless I aggressively pound Ctrl-g. At this point I am almost at the point of patching tooltips out on the source. 
 Help?
 I am running emacs from git, if that makes a difference.

I've been using Emacs and web-mode since 2020, and have never experienced any issues; however just recently I found that whenever I open a PHP file, web-mode will highlight the syntax of whatever HTML is in the file, but completely ignore PHP code.
 My web-mode configuration. And a link to my personal configuration 
 (use-package web-mode :ensure t :config (setq web-mode-enable-auto-quoting t) (setq web-mode-css-indent-offset 4) (setq web-mode-indent-style 4) (setq web-mode-markup-indent-offset 4) (setq web-mode-code-indent-offset 4) (setq web-mode-enable-current-element-highlight t) (setq web-mode-enable-auto-pairing t) (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.php\\'" . web-mode)) (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.phtml\\'" . web-mode)) (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.blade\\'" . web-mode)) (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.tpl\\'" . web-mode)) (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.[agj]sp\\'" . web-mode)) (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.as[cp]x\\'" . web-mode)) (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.erb\\'" . web-mode)) (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.mustache\\'" . web-mode)) (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.djhtml\\'" . web-mode)) (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.html?\\'" . web-mode)) (setq web-mode-engines-alist '(("blade" .

Inserted of just including these comment lines in the org file source blocks, I want to write the comments in a text file and include the file so that when the org file is tangled, the comment file is pretended to the tangled file.
 I tried to use the following:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I'm trying to build a major mode, the functionality is not really that important for the question, but for the curious it is something akin to org-roam.
 I'm not new to programming, or even lisp, but new to emacs lisp.
 I'm not sure how to approach a first working prototype, as the resources I found seem to focus only on syntax highlighting and indentation, but I would like to prototype something like when I open a file of this new major mode, that two windows open side by side, one with the source file and another one with a graphical representation based on the contents of the file.
 If anyone can point me in the right direction I would greatly appreciate it. Thanks!
 PD: To anyone who might say it might be silly to start on this if I'm new to elisp, it's the way I like to learn, doing and improving as I go, most often times it works pretty well, but in this case I'm lost as to where to start.
 Edit: I'm looking for resources, other than the Elisp manual, which is the only thing I'm currently reading but I don't know if reading the manual top to bottom will point me in the right direction, thanks!

 The Diagrams library has the most elegant API I've ever worked with. A bunch of years ago I went to a Haskell hackathon, and Brent Yorgey very patiently helped me make a PR for a simple feature, explained to me about affine transformations, partial vs total functions and the like. It left a lasting impression, really made me want to do more FP. Thanks Brent, whereever you are!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I have been trying, and so far not completely succeeding, in setting up mu4e to access Outlook365 email. This setup involves:
  
davmail
 mbsync
 mu/mu4e
  
As I don't want to litter the initial message with a ton of configuration, which I can provide later when needed, I will jump to questions.
 Reading the mu4e manual I have learned about the 2 operations: move and refile.
  
Is it correct to think of Refile as what is currently found in email services like Gmail or Outlook365 under the name Archive?
 
what configuration is needed or what actions do I need to apply for email to be actually moved to the target mailbox when using move or refile?
 
 With my current setup, I have noticed the emails being copied (or duplicated) to the target directory while they continue to appear in the Inbox when using the Outlook app. On mu4e, the initial emails are not available anymore (as I was thinking that maybe I could delete them).
 This behavior is surprising to me and I'm thinking that 1) either it is a misconfiguration; or 2) it involves a different set of actions to lead to the result I intend.
 thank you for helping a mu4e newbie

New member here, hello :-)
I've been reading a lot about Zettelkasten lately and I would like to try it out.
The site https://zettelkasten.de/ has been a great place to start. I still have a couple of questions, but most of them will become clear while I'm using ZK I guess.
Still 1 thing is not very clear to me. I know a note initially starts as a concept, but I'm wondering when you add more context to your existing note, what do you do with the original text, do you keep it or rewrite the whole note into something new?
Sorry if my question is not clear.
Thank you]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This question can be worded a lot better but I'm honestly drawing a blank. The premise is this, I'm thinking of building an upgraded GUI for Emacs (for no reason other than fun). I have two options: 1. building the GUI from scratch and bridging to the Emacs functionality then have the custom GUI render all the events from Emacs OR 2. maybe I can just edit the already existing source code for the GUI and add features or change it entirely. I just want to know what files to start digging. I could be going about this all wrong entirely, but that's my plan so far. I know frame.c and window.c manages outputs and stuff I'm just trying to be thorough and see if there is maybe something else I can look at in the source code.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to build emacs 29 from source and no matter how I configure, it won't build with svg support.
 here are steps I did to build emacs maybe there is something wrong with them:
  
clone emacs from github 
 
take a snapshot of emacs 29 using: archive origin/emacs-29 | tar -x -C ../emacs-29
 
go to emacs-29 dir and run autogen[.]sh 
 
run ./configure --with-gif --with-gnutls=ifavailable --with-json --with-modules --with-xwidgets --with-rsvg it only complains about mail being unecrypted no warning or anything about svg.
 
make && sudo make install
 
run emacs 
 
 when finished I run (image-type-available-p 'svg) it returns nil (also tested with emacs -Q ).
 I tried this multiple times no matter how I did it, it won't build with svg.
 I also tried to build with native compilation but gcc failed to compile the test ( when I tested the test file it resulted in an error with segmentation fault )
 my system:
 os: ubuntu-18.04( I know it is old but I have a gpu problem that prevent any recent version to run properly)
 gcc: gcc (Ubuntu 7.5.0-3ubuntu1~18.04) 7.5.0

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Despite my best efforts, I haven't been able to get my normal emacs configuration to render the left and right quotes (u+201C and u+201d: "“”"). Instead, I just the get the ASCII quote symbols highlighted in blue to indicate that they're actually not the ASCII quote character. The same applies to left and right single quotes.
 As implied by my post title, this problem only applies when running emacs in daemon mode. if instead of launching emacsclient I run /usr/bin/emacs from a graphical environment, I get a frame where the quote characters work fine. I'm inferring that there's some variable somewhere that determines whether or not quote characters should be substituted, and it's being set to false when emacs runs daemonized because there's no graphical environment, but I'm unsure what variable that would be and where it would be set.
 I am using emacs 29.4 with pgtk enabled, on Arch Linux. My WM is Sway, which means I am running under wayland. The font I am using is Terminus 16.

 There are a handful of `main` programs, so am working thought converting them to be wrapped in IO. and called within each main. Its a fail fast program, but feel the control given with IO, may make it better. 
 I know that is fairly vague. It was written for Ammonite, and have moved it all to Mill and pure scala. The concept of if its worth it, keeps crossing my mind.

 https://github.com/shishimaru/gemini-code-completion.el
 On Google Colabo, Gemini suggests code and the experience was awesome because my development got more efficient and faster, and I could sometimes learn new things with the suggested code.
 I have sent PR to Melpa and hope it will be approved soon so that other Emacsen can easily try this package and make their life a better place.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to figure out the recommend workflow for writing a standalone haskell program. Say I want to write a single program in a file 'test.hs' that depends on modules not in the prelude. And I want to compile this into an executable. So I cannot simply complie this with `ghc test.hs`, since I will get the complaint that ghc cannot find the module I need.
 So what is the recommended work around? I know you can use cabal or stack to build a project and the specify dependencies in the .cabal file. But this seems heavy duty for a single haskell file. Specifically, using `cabal init` will create a directory `app`, the file `CHANGELOG.md`, and the .cabal file, just for this single haskell file. Further `cabal init` asks quite a lot, including asking about which license to use, leading me to believe `cabal init` is meant for much more heavy duty projects.
 Using stack has a similar amount of, if not more, overhead.
 tldr; Is using `cabal init` or `stack new` the best way to create a stand alone `.hs` file depend on hidden packages? What is the recommended way?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to find some YT videos I've seen before, on writing technical docs using org-mode. I already have some System Crafters ones, and also those from spudlyo but while useful, they're not the specific one(s) I'm thinking of. I think the presenter had either an Australian (or maybe Kiwi/Tassie) or South African accent.
 Any suggestions?
 Incidentally, I did ask ChatGPT for its input. And while I have to acknowledge that accent is not a perfect predictor of nationality, I reckon it's still often a good one. And so I have my doubts over ChatGPT's three suggestions. The first was David Wilson, who doesn't sound very Australian. The second was System Crafters, but that Just Is David Wilson. The third reply was the charm though, and makes me think ChatGPT must be having a particularly bad day, hallucinations-wise, because it said:
  
...another prominent Australian YouTuber who focuses on Emacs and Org mode is 'Protesilaos Stavrou'
  
Again, I know accent doesn't map perfectly to nationality, but clearly Prot doesn't sound remotely Australian. Thing is, ChatGPT actually seemed to be "aware" of the issue, because it went on to say:
  
While not exclusively Australian, his content is highly relevant and valuable for Emacs and Org mode users.
  
So there you go, Prot. If you're reading this you'll be glad to know that ChatGPT acknowledges that you are not "exclusively" Australian. Fair dinkum.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I need to change the color of the modified lines in my git-gutter. I found this code online and I put it in my config.el
  (custom-set-faces `(git-gutter-fr:added ((t (:foreground "#00ff00")))) ;; green `(git-gutter-fr:modified ((t (:foreground "#ffff00")))) ;; yellow `(git-gutter-fr:deleted ((t (:foreground "#ff0000")))) ;; red ) ) 
 But it doesn't seem to do anything and there are no errors.
 I need to change the color of git blame line (from why-this package). The README file says I need to add:
 (set-face-background 'why-this-annotate-heat-map-cold "#203448") (set-face-background 'why-this-annotate-heat-map-warm "#382f27") 
 I put this also in my config.el and this no effect at all either. I have already tried restarting Emacs and everything and none of my settings have any effect.
 Is it just me or did everyone else also start with so much of frustration when they got started with Emacs? I did not expect something like just changing a color to be so complicated.
 UPDATE:
 Fixed the first issue based on this thread: https://github.com/doomemacs/themes/issues/268
 (custom-set-faces
 '(diff-hl-insert ((t (:foreground "#00ff00"))))
 '(diff-hl-change ((t (:foreground "#ffff00"))))
 '(diff-hl-delete ((t (:foreground "#ff0000"))))
 )
 Still struggling with the why-this package.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m on a bit of an FFI discovery journey, trying to make some bindings to openCV (it’s mostly to get better at FFI writing, less for publishing)
 OpenCV is a really interesting library because it’s Mat data type handles memory really well.
 It reference counts the actual matrix data. You can have several openCV transformations that use several Mats, but open CV will maybe do everything in place.
 The question is, how best to do this in Haskell? It feels like a job for the ST monad?
 So my questions: Is there a way of using c++ class destructors in Haskell? Calling them when values go out of scope? I worry about this because using Cont would lead to space leaks with loops(?)
 Even though I have storable instances, I seem to only be able to work with pointers to Mats, not the types themselves
 Can I use the ST monad? Is there any reason I shouldn’t?

 This has multiple problems. First, when writing import ... I don't get completions. Second, if I have import numpy as np then later np. doesn't get completed to anything correct. I'm not sure which package is in charged of this and would love help in this regard.

 https://github.com/plokhotnyuk/jsoniter-scala/compare/v2.30.3...v2.30.6
 The main operations that contributed on time/battery spends happened to be divisions of `Long` values on some constants during serialization of `BigDecimal`, `BigInt`, `Long`, `Float`, `Double`, `java.time.Duration` and `java.time.Instant` values.
 Here are final results measured on different browsers:

When playing macro, As long as there is a file name in the dired buffer of the form fuu[0-9]+, I’m good, keyboard macro continues playing after finding the file name. However, if dired buffer only contains file name ‘fuu’, macro terminates prematurely with failed regexp search when ‘]’ char is played, before ‘’ char is played. Any ideas?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm working my way through the excellent Crafting Interpreters book and decided to do the first part in Haskell instead of Java. Everything has been going swimmingly until we got to closures, which introduced a subtle problem involving variable shadowing. To fix this, the book introduces a semantic analysis pass where all the variables get resolved to their proper scope before any actual interpreting happens.
 This analysis pass uses a Map Expression Int, mapping from an expression to a location in the stack of scopes of the program where the variable can be found. In Java, because `Expression` is a separate object with its own object ID, this works out fine. In my Haskell version I have implemented Expression something like the following:
 data Expression = Grouping Expression
 | Unary UnaryOperation Expression
 | Binary BinaryOperation Expression Expression
 | Literal LiteralContents
 | Variable String
 | Assignment String Expression
 -- etc
 deriving (Show,Eq,Ord)
 This has worked very well so far, however it does introduce a problem with regards to the Map Expression Int: Any Variable "abc" will be considered equal, even if they come from very different nodes in the AST. The derived functions for Eq will not do here.
 What is the recommended way to solve this? So far I've come up with:
  
Try and fake the Java way of object equality by using `StablePtr` and friends, though that may not work too well with the (hash)map.
 Add a unique integer to every node in the AST to disambiguate them.
 Add the original source location to every Expression, so that different references to the same variable would be disambiguated by their source location. This feels a bit dirty though, since it would bleed implementation details from the scanner/parser into the interpreter.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Few days ago I happened to stumble upon an interesting read and link on SX, about a calendar library in Common Lisp. I actually ordered a book to the local library (we can distance-borrow in Sweden), and I found an interesting statement in Preface:
 "Our initial motivation was an effort by one of us (E.M.R.) to create Emacs-Lisp code that would provide calendar and diary features for GNU Emacs ( ... ) A deluge of inquiries from around the globe soon made it clear to us that there was keen interest in an explanation that would go beyond the code itself"
 Ha! Looking at the calendar.el, indeed, the author is one of the authors of the book in question (Calendrical Calculations).
 Basically, what they say, Emacs and Emacs community inspired them to gather together information and write probably the most authoritative book on the subject yet. How cool is that!

 Is there a way to implement something like this? I want the keymap to be repeatable but I want a key to exit the keymap.
 I tried to use "q" #'ignore :repeat (:exit ("ignore")), but that did not work.

 (use-package flycheck ;; Flycheck base package :ensure t :commands global-flycheck-mode :config (setq flycheck-global-modes '(not org-mode)) :init (setq flycheck-emacs-lisp-load-path 'inherit) (add-hook 'after-init-hook #'global-flycheck-mode)) 
 Note the sixth line, it tells global-flycheck-mode not to apply in org.
 On my Linux machine, this works. On my MacOS MacBook, it doesn't. Both machines use the same config files (managed in a GitHub repo), and both are running Emacs 29.4 (Linux is custom-built, Mac is a Homebrew cask).
 Yesterday (when I noticed this while doing some heavy editing of an org file on the Mac) I tried a number of different things to get FC to not be on for org, but every time I restarted Emacs the org buffers had FC enabled.
 Does this sound familiar to anyone here?

 I use the "src" block and it is very good but how I can use the tab to indent like a normal file or how I can format the code in the "src" block ?
 The <tab> is binding to the org-cycle what is good but how I can bind it to the indentation ?
 thanks in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am entering my senior year of my BSc. in Data Science (primarily use R and python). I first learned about Emacs my freshman year and was intrigued by the potential -- keyboard-focused, modularity, customization, etc. I started using and configuring vanilla Emacs as my "daily driver" about 18mo ago. Within the last 6mo I have used `org-agenda` to organize my schedule, Jupyter notebooks for class assignments, and record most* of my notes using `denote` (*need to spend some time configuring latex for math notes). 
 This summer, I completed a Data Science internship at a medium-ish sized tech company. Although most of my classwork is in Jupyter notebooks, the dev team discourages the use of notebooks. Experiments are mostly organized in python files but it does seem that others still use Jupyter notebooks to tinker with code snippets or intermediate plotting. All development is done remotely across a number of servers and docker containers.
 Needless to say, my "little" Emacs configuration was not up to the task. The jump from using Emacs for my homework assignments to fleshing out a reliable IDE that I can be used on the job is overwhelming. I struggle to envision how I would make that jump. I am aware of `tramp` and `lsp-bridge`, for example, but have read a lot of complaints about latency or `magit` being slow. Alternatively, one could install Emacs on given server ... but how common is it that companies allow you to do that? 
 For those that use Emacs professionally: How do you use Emacs at your company? Do you run Emacs locally but develop over tramp, what is that experience like? If not, does your company allow you to install Emacs on a server?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Is there a neat way of handling configuration data in Haskell that doesn't involve threading the configuration all the way through the compution?
 What I mean by "constant" configuration is stuff that will not change throughout the lifetime of the program, so you could embed it in code as a simple function, but where it would be generally good software engineering practice to keep it in an updatable file, rather than embdedding it in code.
 A few examples of what I mean:
  
A collection of units and their conversions, it would be useful to have a file of this data and have it read when the program starts, so that additional units can be added or values corrected without recompiling, plus some functions to get units by name, etc.
 Calendars giving things like the (notoriously difficult) dates of Easter
 Message files
 Locale information, such as Basque days of the week
  
The default, as far as I can see, is to embed the data directly into the program, possibly using template haskell or just as code. For example, I can see how Yesod handles messages and keeps type safety. But not being able to add a new language or reword things without recompilng is more than a bit meh to my eye.
 In my current application, I'm looking at calendar definitions. I'd like to be able to have a file saying "Pentecost is the 50th day after Easter Sunday. Easter Sunday is supposed to have a definition but it got messed up and it's now effectively an arbitary list of dates. Australia Day is on the 26th of January." etc. etc. and then, if I'm reading JSON and there is a named calendar, just get the calendar defintiion. Threading stuff through the compution looks both incredibly awkward and just a bit tacky.
 Does anyone have any pointers to a good technique?

I have re-implemented a part of expand-region for the new tree-sitter modes, using only a few lines of elisp and built-in packages. This is probably already in Mickey Peterson's excellent combobulate package.
 To use it, open a treesitter enabled buffer (say with python-ts-mode) and then hit <C-return>. Repeat invocations of <return> will expand the region, - will contract and C-g will reset and exit.

Several times a week, when I unlock my screen (regolith3/X11/i3) Emacs will die immediately or as soon as it gets focus. It doesn't seem to dump a core file anywhere obvious and even if it did I'd have to learn how to debug a core file for Emacs.
 Anybody have any advice on how to debug this?
  
EDIT1: This Emacs is 30.x from the Guix emacs-next pacakge. TIL that you can guix install emacs-next --with-debug-info=emacs-next and Guix will recompile the package with debug symbols. Now how long is THAT going to take? ;)
  
EDIT2: So I was able to get a backtrace and it looks like I've got something odd going on during garbage collection. I had a backtrace but reddit's editing environment chokes on it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Consider the following:
 ``` type role M nominal data M a -- .. a has a nominal role
 type role N representational data N a where N :: (Coercible b a) => M b -> N a ```
 Now if M is a functor, N is a functor, like so:
  instance Functor N where fmap f (N m) = N (fmap (f . coerce) m) 
 But less say I have: 
  class MakeM a where makeM :: M a 
 Then I can't say:
 ``` class MakeM a where makeM :: M a
 newtype MyM a = MyM a deriving newtype (MakeM) ```
 Because a has a nominal role in M.
 But I can say: 
 ``` class MakeN a where makeN :: N a
 newtype MyN a = MyN a deriving newtype (MakeN) ```
 Because a has a representative role in N.
 But it's my understanding that the Coercible dictionary is still included in the datatype as a field at runtime (see here and here): 
 Why?
 Is this just an optimisation GHC could make but it hasn't got around to?
 It seems to me if that any calls to coerce are eliminated at runtime, you should be able to drop the pointer to the Coercible dictionary. You're never going to use it anyway.
 Furthermore, in this particular case, I can't see why we just make N a newtype of M:
  newtype N a where N :: (Coercible b a) => M b -> N a 
 As once we get rid of the dictionary we've just got an indirection, could we just get rid of it (I'm not as sure about this though).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In my previous post which was answered and I learned a ton from (thank you all!), I was trying to write a megaparsec parser for the NATS protocol messages.
 I got my message parser down to something that I like and is somewhat readable:
 ```haskell pMsgMessage :: Parser ProtocolMessage pMsgMessage = do _ <- string "MSG" <* hspace1 subject <- validSubject <* hspace1 sid <- many alphaNumChar <* hspace1 reply <- try (fmap Just validSubject <* hspace1) <|> return Nothing len <- integer <* crlf
 return $ MsgMessage {..} ```
 This covers a message like:  MSG hello.world s1 reply.to.me 50\r\n  What needs to follow on this message type and a bunch of others is the optional payload. This payload is a string of bytes, and the number of bytes is indicated by the len variable.
 I've tried combinations of takeP and count and some other stuff, but I'm at a loss. Yes, I know I need to learn more (and hitting these walls is how I learn), and I know I lack experience with general purpose combinators.
 So all I'm looking for is a Nothing when len is 0, and a Just ByteString for when it's not.
 The psuedocode I was hoping I could write was something like:
 haskell payload <- try (fmap Just $ take len <* crlf) <|> return Nothing

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I was recently fiddling with programmed completion and want to document it for posterity. There's no example snippet like this in the manual, and it'd have got me started much more easily.
 (defvar my-coll '("foo" "fnord" "baz")) (defun my-programmable-coll (str pred flag) (let ((coll my-coll)) (cond ((eq flag nil) (try-completion str coll pred)) ((eq flag t) (all-completions str coll pred)) ((eq flag 'lambda) (test-completion str coll pred)) ((consp flag) (completion-boundaries str coll pred (cdr flag))) ((eq flag 'metadata) (completion-metadata str coll pred))))) ;; These are equivalent! (completing-read "Pick: " my-coll) (completing-read "Pick: " #'my-programmable-coll) 
 My use-case: now I can hardcode an affixation-function in the metadata, so that I do not need to let-bind completion-extra-properties every time I write a call to completing-read.

Now, when I installed the default version of GNU emacs (v29.3) via sudo apt install emacs, I got a peculiar problem. When I run emacs as the end user, I got the following error shown in the minibuffer:
 Symbol’s function definition is void: eieio-defclass
 When I run it with -q option, it works, but clearly my ~/.emacs.d/init.el file is not loaded. So, when I run: emacs -q --load ~/.emacs.d/init.el it works as usual. So, what is wrong here? Does GNU emacs by default first load and check some files before loading my ~/.emacs.d/init.el file? Thanks a lot for your help!!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have installed Haskell on Ubuntu 22.04 via ghcup (curl command).
 Everything is installed and seems to work, at least as far as I tested. But in the ghcup tui all tools are marked with a grey check mark (with a little "1"), if I try to set a tool as default. I would expect two green check marks.
 On my Laptop everything works as expected. I don't know why it in not working on my PC. Any idea?
 Edit: I completely removed .ghcup and .cabal folders from my home directory and installed everything from scratch. With the same result.
 I can install everything and get a green check mark, but if I try to set it with "s" I get the single grey check mark with a "1"
 I think I found the answer. The problem is the font I use in the terminal. The check marks change depending on the font I use. If I use DejaVu Sans Mono I see two green check marks. Some other fonts show two grey check marks. I assume that what I thought was a "1" is actually a cut-off second hook.

https://zettelkasten.de/the-archive/help/#hidden-preferences
If you want to create a simple settings dashboard, you can use the thearchive:// URL scheme in one of your notes inside of The Archive. There, you can click the links to change settings -- no terminal needed.
For example, try to paste these into a note:
Pasted image filename without spaces: thearchive://preference/pastedImageFilename/set/yyyyMMdd'_image'
Pasted image filename without date: thearchive://preference/pastedImageFilename/set/'pasted-image'
Pasted image filename reset: thearchive://preference/pastedImageFilename/delete

ID's accurate to seconds: thearchive://preference/identifierDateFormat/set/yyyyMMddHHmmss
ID's accurate to minutes: thearchive://preference/identifierDateFormat/set/yyyyMMddHHmm  (original)
ID's accurate to days: thearchive://preference/identifierDateFormat/set/yyyyMMdd
ID reset: thearchive://preference/identifierDateFormat/delete


Then you can play around with different formats.
Note: Most of these settings don't actually require a relaunch of the app, but if something doesn't work, quit and open the app again if in doubt.]]></summary>

        <updated>2024-07-11T09:09:06.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently I found out that Emacs can deal with so-called noncontiguous regions. I cannot find very much information about these on the internet, the Emacs manual or the Emacs help system. But I'm curious about these noncontiguous regions and want to see if I can use them for something. As an example, something I want to do is to narrow to a noncontiguous region. But to be clear, narrowing to a noncontiguous region is not the problem I want solved here. I just want to learn how to use noncontiguous regions. 
 I'll try to define a clear question. If I want to create a noncontiguous region that contains the columns 4 to 7 on rows 1 and 2 then I can do this using a rectangular region(at least interactively, but I imagine I can recreate that in elisp too). But what if I want to create a noncontiguous region containing columns 4 to 7 on lines 1 and 3 but not line 2. Then I cannot use rectangular regions(as far as I know). Is there a way to do this? I'm not necessarily asking for an interactive way to do it. An elisp solution is fine and even prefered. 
 I've found the variable region-extract-function that perhaps could be useful, but I'm not sure how to use it. In particular, I don't know when the function that this variable is bound to is called. 
 I also found the library zones.el. But from the documentation it seems like it doesn't actually define noncontiguous regions, just something that looks and feels like noncontiguous regions. So this doesn't really satisfy my curiosity. And I'm mainly interested in learning the builtin functionality, so a third party package like this isn't really what I'm looking for.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I understand the title may be vague or nonsensical. But I had to make one, and that was the best I could come up with. A longer version of my question follows.
 I am an amateur Emacsist. I've got a solid understanding of all things *nix, lisp, and configuring a text editor (from prior vim experience). I've been eagerly building up a very comfortable .emacs for the past few months, and have been loving the experience in general. However, there is one thing that bothers me which I don't believe bothers others as much, if not at all: When I try to use some package that adds to or modifies the fundamental Emacs experience — something that modifies things like buffer management, text editing or whatnot — it often clashes with my own previous customizations or even default Emacs behavior. 
 For instance, If I were to use a modal editing package like Evil mode, I'd need to rebind keys to work correctly for every package I added. Think Magit for instance. Another time I faced a similar issue was when I tried popper.el. It's a great package, but It's job is to augment default buffer-handing behavior. I often ran into issues where a buffer created by a function from one package ended up in the wrong place due to popper. This is not a devastating problem as I could always just place the buffer where I want it manually, but that's the point, sort of. 
 I have a very large config, and adding anything that changes the fundamental experience of Emacs becomes a software project of its own with the involvement of design, and large refactors and whatnot. I wonder if that's the case with you guys.
 Does anyone else have the same experience? Is this something I just have to settle for and solve bottom-up by solving the problems as they arise? Am I holding it wrong? I'd love to know you guys' thoughts

 This is from an advent of code problem (2020, day 1). The goal is to take a list of integers and find a pair that sums to 2020. If no such pair exists, return 'Nothing'. If the pair is (x , y), return `Just (x , y)`. Here is the fuction I came up with:
 ```

 search_sum_to_2020 (x : y : xs) =

 It is with great pleasure to realise we won war against begin-end style boilerplate and "you can't use braceless with lambdas" pointless prejudices and now most of }}}}}}} alike eyesores can be purged with single scalafmt setting. 
 I cannot understand why "reviewing MR with braceless" is "harder" i mean, most of diff visualisers were able to provide unreadable diffs that would make you open both versions and compare them by eye, but aren't you review diff by imaging code which was there and how it changed? To add, diffs show spaces and, its like mostly obvious which indentation level it is. If it isn't, you have indent rainbow, which trivializes tracking.
 Same story with merge conflicts - sometimes you would be able to get braces mismatch regardless, and its harder to fix than indentation mismatch. 
 Well, now we have (), that are the second source of unpronouceable clutter, and [] which are, as well, in some places, yet not as common. I hope someday these would be optional as well.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Is there additional configuration needed when setting up lsp-mode with respect to the tab key for indenting?
 I've noticed that my indentations are always inconsistent. For example, when editing a React typescript component, if i just hit <TAB>, or create a new line, it indents 4 spaces from the last line. But if I highlight the region and hit <TAB> then it seems to indent based on LSP rules and indents it by 2.
 The same is true when I'm in C++ mode. While writing, and hitting tab when I'm on the line, I get the following header:
 #pragma once namespace some_name_space { class SomeClass { public: SomeClass() private: int someMember; } } 
 But if I highlight the buffer and hit <TAB>, or call lsp-format-region, then I end up with:
 #pragma once namespace some_name_space { class SomeClass { public: SomeClass(); private: int someMember; } } // namespace some_name_space 
 Which i assume is different because when I do that, it's calling clang-format (based on the fact that the endspace ending comment get added.)
 Is there a way to make it so that indentations will use lsp to formatting rules if lsp mode is enabled?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am trying to get better at Haskell by using it more in "anger" ... and Megaparsec is definitely making me angry.
 I am attempting to parse a NATS protocol message. I have two variants of the "message" one that indicates a reply subject and one that doesn't.
 With reply:
 MSG target.subject 1 reply.subject 500\r\n
 Without reply:
 MSG target.subject 1 500\r\n
 And now here are my parser functions. The problem I'm having is that no matter what I do, I can _either_ get it to parse the first form or the second form, but I can't get it to properly "fall back" to one or the other.
 pMsgMessage :: Parser ProtocolMessage pMsgMessage = do msgMessageWithReply <|> msgMessageWithoutReply msgMessageWithReply :: Parser ProtocolMessage msgMessageWithReply = do _ <- string "MSG" space1 subject <- validSubject space1 sid <- integer space1 reply <- validSubject space1 len <- integer _ <- crlf return $ MsgMessage subject (Just reply) sid len msgMessageWithoutReply :: Parser ProtocolMessage msgMessageWithoutReply = do _ <- string "MSG" space1 subject <- validSubject space1 sid <- integer space1 len <- integer _ <- crlf return $ MsgMessage subject Nothing sid len 
 If I change the order in which I check for alternatives, then I change which one I can parse and which one produces an error:
 ghci> parseTest parseMessage "MSG this.subject 1 120\r\n" 2:1: | 2 | <empty line> | ^ unexpected end of input expecting numeric character or white space 
 I'm sure I've just forgotten something dumb, but I can't for the life of me get these alternatives working and I've re-read "the" megaparsec tutorial over and over until it hurt.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 I'm trying to learn `haxl` library with servant. I'm having a custom reader monad stack which contains `Env`. Right now, I am using `runHaxl` function in the handler function to fetch the data. Something like this:
  
fetchUsersH :: (MonadIO m) => AppT m [Int] [User]
 fetchUsersH = do
 (env0 :: Env () [Int]) <- asks haxlEnv
 liftIO $ runHaxl env0 (dataFetch FetchUsers)
  
I saw a github code where scotty was being used, where the GenHaxl was added in the monad stack. Link of the scotty-haxl code
  
addTimeline :: (HasPSQL u, HasOtherEnv Cache u) => String -> ID -> GenHaxl u w ID
 addTimeline name aid =
 unCacheArticle aid $ unCacheCount ("timeline:" ++ name) $ RawAPI.addTimeline name aid
  
And it was getting converted into IO like this:
  
scottyOptsT opts (runIO u state) $ application [logStdout]
 where runIO :: (HasPSQL u, HasOtherEnv C.Cache u) => u -> StateStore -> GenHaxl u w b -> IO b
 runIO env s m = do
 env0 <- initEnv s env
 runHaxl env0 m
  
I want to do similar thing with servant, but I didn't find any example.
 Also, I want to know what would be the best practice for handling haxl
 data fetching? getting the env from the reader and calling runHaxl within
 the handler function or runHaxl should be called at the `hoistServer` level?

 I recently noticed that I don't get a preview of grep matches when I am using CONSULT-GREP on a directory on a remote machine. However, I do get previews when I execute CONSULT-GREP on the locale machine.
 Do you have any idea why this might be the case? Is there anything I can tweak to get it?
 Have a good day, fellows :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi folks,
 I've been searching for a package that enables the simple "one tab per project" workflow, so each project is isolated in its tab.
 I used tabspaces for some time but I faced several issues with it. Then, I switched to the more lightweight project-tab-groups which creates a "tab group" per project, but with some limitations. The latter was simple enough to inspire me to create the package I'm looking for, one-tab-per-project (or otpp).
 The idea is simple, install the package and its dependency unique-dir-name (another package of mine, created specifically for otpp), enable otpp-mode and you are good to go. Whenever you switched to a project project-switch-project (C-x p p), otpp will switch to a dedicated tab. And in case of conflicting projects names, otpp will resolve the conflict by renaming the similar tabs.

Looking for your feedback!

 Pulled down homebrew, then emacs, and...I'm just flummoxed.
 I'm about 40 years used to "alt/control" on both sides of the space bar being "meta/ctrl". 
 How? Can I remap those for use with emacs? I naively thought I could just "describe-key" to see what it thought those were natively, then reassign them in .emacs, but...no go.
 Point me, Obi Wan, to TFM that I may R it.
 Thanks.

 How can I reach that behaviour for my function?
 It is a pseudo haskell code
  runC :: (f a -> g b) -> f a -> g b runC :: (f a -> f b -> g c) -> f a -> f b -> g c runC :: (f a -> f b -> ... -> g n) -> f a -> f b -> ... -> g n 
 So a, b, ..., n are different types I need runC to be polymorphic like this

Is it possible to open a subrepl within the context of a given frame? This way I could look at the local variables and test out different changes to them. I have looked in the manual but all I could find was an eval in frame command, which is annoying for extensive probing.

 In my opinion, the best book for beginners is "Get Programming with Haskell" by Will Knut. Although it is a somewhat older book, it is written and structured in a much more comprehensible way than "Lern you a Haskell", for example, which I didn't get on with at all. Haskell in Depth" was also not a suitable introduction for me.
 Which book was the best introduction for you?

 In Haskell report 2010, section 1.3, it says: "An expression evaluates to a value and has a static type." In chapter 3, functions are not listed as expressions, only function applications. In section 4.4.3.1 it says: "A function binding binds a variable to a function value."
 If I understand correctly, a function is a value, therefore an expression. So why functions are not classified as expressions?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello emacs fellas.
 This is my second attempt at trying to switch to emacs. First time I tried System Crafters' emacs from scratch series, and it is good, but I just find navigating through his video playlist a bit too long and inconvenient, and because of that I could not find myself finishing that playlist.
 Are there any text oriented guides with a thorough explanation with something like code snippets and such if possible, to read through and end up with a reasonably good config to start the journey? It would also be good to see something like that but for elisp, once I get a good emacs config rolling.
 Many thanks for those who respond.
 EDIT: I came from vim environment, and it would be nice if a resource acommodated that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We used to have the language extensions OverlappingInstances and IncoherentInstances, and now they've been deprecated (but not removed) in favor of per-instance pragmas like
 instance {-# OVERLAPPING #-} Foo a => Foo [a] where ... 
 Could we do the same with UndecidableInstances, like
 instance {-# UNDECIDABLE #-} Foo a => Bar a where ... 
 ? That seems like it would be a small but significant improvement to me. I don't see any downsides or fundamental obstacles to doing it, but maybe I'm missing something.
 If it can be done, I'd have some interest in writing up a GHC proposal and if it gets accepted trying to implement it myself. I weakly guess I'd be able to do that mostly independently.
 (There's a similar question for UndecidableSuperClasses and maybe it would make sense to do them both at once? But I use that less often so my vague inclination is to keep scope small.)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone,
 I’m currently facing a decision between two job offers and would appreciate your insights, especially from those familiar with the Scala ecosystem.
 I’m based in Romania and relatively new to the industry, with a junior level of experience. Here are the details of the two offers:
 1. First Offer: This is a B2B position in a well-established outsourcing company focused on a betting project. The project is run out of Poland and involves working with Scala on a platform that is already up and running for a major client in the betting industry. The role offers about 50-60% higher compensation compared to the second option. The job provides a flexible work schedule, allowing for mid-day breaks like going to the gym. However, I have some ethical concerns regarding working in the betting industry. 2. Second Offer: This is a permanent employment (CIM) position at another outsourcing company, but on a project that is just about to start. The project involves Python and AWS, and the salary is lower. The work hours are strict, from 9 to 18, with little flexibility. 
 Given the market trends, I’m inclined towards the more stable option, even though stability sometimes seems illusory if the employer decides to let you go. I have experience with both Scala and Python and try to remain language-agnostic in my career.
 My question for you is:
 • Considering the current state and future of Scala in the industry, do you think the first offer has a significant advantage in terms of career development? 
 Thank you for your help!

When I use the Org exporter to convert files with such links to HTML, I want these file links converted just as a [[file:...]] link would be. Can someone knowledgable with Org internals explain which functions and sections of the functions I would have to adapt or what configurations I would have to change to make this work. Thank you. Of course, I would prefere if there were a workable solution without modifying the code but I expect that will be necessary.

I had sly open and I was editing a lisp file and then the emacs window just closed. When I launched emacs from a terminal all I got as an error was ` Job 1, 'emacs &' terminated by signal SIGSEGV (Address boundary error)`. I installed Fedora last night so I doubt there is anything on my system that I could have added to might be causing this problem. Since I am running sway, I do not have the .xsession-errors file. Journalctl just says `Jul 07 13:50:59 zenbook systemd-coredump[14384]: Process 2164 (emacs) of user 1000 terminated abnormally without generating a coredump.` How can I debug this?

 The main problem that i found with Cats Effect / ZIO libraries is that those are only the "effect libraries", if you want to do something you have to build it, i ended up building my own "micro-frameworks" for every (professional or hobby) project that i start and most of them are almost the same.
 Any good template or unknown framework suggestion is great!.
 PD: I want to do a Web Application, i already have the Tyrian app working for my front/mobile app but i'm okay working with templates too.

 Hello! I'm trying to get this repository to work on Mac OS and I'd like some help!
 The setup is that there is a C++ library with a C interface. It needs to link to the WebKit framework.
 I have made a haskell library which is bindings for the c++ library. In the cabal file, I reference that it needs the WebKit framework.
 The executable depends on the library, but the executable (or the library) does not seem to link to WebKit. As a result the executable breaks.
 Is this a bug in cabal/haskell? Does anyone know how to fix it?
 Thanks :)

 Please test it and let us know at the Stack repository if you run into any trouble. If all goes well, we hope to release the final version in a couple of weeks.
 Release notes:
  
The change in major version from 2.x to 3.1 marks the dropping of support for versions of GHC before 8.4, deprecated in Stack 2.15.1.
  
Changes since v2.15.7:
 Behavior changes:
  
Stack uses the version of the Cabal package that comes with the specified version of GHC. Stack no longer supports such Cabal versions before 2.2, which came with versions of GHC before 8.4. Consequently, the init command will not try LTS Haskell before 12.0.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey, I'm trying to write an LSP server for a project which uses json files. First thing I am doing is parsing the JSON files and validating the syntax. Something strange is happening with the published diagnostics. Eglot is showing the actual position of the diagnostic 1 line after and 1 character before the actual reported location of the error. Here's a screenshot of the file as well as the message from the server. The error is because the 2nd line is missing a comma. As can be seen in the event log, the server is publishing the right location for the error, which is line 3 character 4. But the error actually shows up in line 4 character 3. Other language server work just fine with my emacs so it is likely that I'm doing something wrong. Is this because of a mismatch of 1-based and 0-based indexing between the server and the client? Is there a setting that I need to tweak? I took a cursory look at the LSP spec but couldn't find anything about negotiation of indexing. Any help is appreciated.

For the second part of day 4, I'm using an STUArray to keep track of the ticket counts, and I want at least version 0.5.6 of the array package so I can use modifyArray'. However, when I try to build my solution, cabal is not able to resolve the dependencies (error message below). I know that cabal caches packages globally, and this caching seems to be the source of the issue. For example, the error message is saying that the deepseq-1.4.8.0 requires array==0.5.4.0, while the Hackage page says that it simply requires array >=0.4 && <0.6. I'm guessing this is because the cached version was built specifically with array-0.5.4.0, but I can't figure out how to fix this error. Any help is greatly appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm a late stage phd student in physics data analysis, doing some light numerical computation (mostly linear algebra, stats), training models with pytorch, and plotting various relevant combinations. I have made several bugs related to using numpy arrays incorrectly and modifying them inplace only to realize much later and fix them with hundreds of .copy() making everything ugly.
 I am interested in haskell to avoid making several objects, their interfaces, when in reality I can clearly see that my research is several composed functions of data. All the while ensuring that my data doesn't need .copy() everytime when handing over arrays from one class to another.
 I have some questions mainly regarding the current state of the libraries:
 1. is it easy/possible to natively think about xarray - n-dimensional arrays like numpy with named dimensions like pandas (essentially pandas multi-index) in haskell?
 2. is it easy/possible to achieve the various plotting routines in matplotlib, but mainly imshow, scatter, histogram2d, natively in haskell?
 3. Is it easy/possible to train pytorch models natively in haskell? 
 I imagine needing O(~months) to get up to speed and I would appreciate if that sunk time would be worth the benefits soon after.
 Optionally, I would also like to hear about your success stories in switching to haskell even if vaguely related to these ideas.

 I'm now trying to write a short IO loop where you can enter text to be either encoded or decoded, but I'm not sure how i can 'save' my mapping [(Letter,[Int])] to be carried over for decoding later (or if this even possible / normal in Haskell).
 Ideally I'd like to be able to save it somewhere so I have a loop like 
 main :: IO () main = do putStrLn "would you like encoding/decoding" c <- getLine case c of "E" -> encodeLoop >> main "D" -> decodeLoop >> main _ -> putStrLn "Character not recognised, please try again" >> main 
 and then after encoding, I could store the mapping created, and later on pass it to the decoder to use.
 If there is a better / more Haskelly way of doing this I'd be really glad to hear it 
 Thanks in advance

 Up until now, I extensively run (C-c C-c) code blocks in multiple org files, mainly for data fetching, cleaning, processing and in the end, the resulting data is exported to some other format (csv, spreadsheet, database, ...). Using orgmode for self documenting and structuring these blocks is wonderful. I can organize each block by its functionality, by client, etc, and also add some usage tips, or other useful info.
 These seems manageable when these blocks are simple, and just a couple of lines. But when they get bigger, and/or require other code from other blocks, it gets harder to maintain.
 For example, block A needs a function from block B, which in turn needs a class from block X and a function from block Y. I could solve with noweb references, but in terms of manageability is …]]></summary>

 I would love to use emacs and orgmode (have been hearing about it's capabilities for years) but this whole thing becomes moot for me if I can't sync a todo list on several devices and computers.
  
Is it doable in a way that won't make me feel like tearing my hair out?
 Bonus question: is there anyway to put simple password protection or encryption on the synced file? 
  
Thanks!

 I just had a problem where updating the global ESLint binary used with my editors caused no more linting, unless my project was on the specific newer version 9.x.x.
 I took inspiration on some old hacks I found (but none of they worked with me) to patch my on way to force flymake-eslint to use the LOCAL project eslint instead of the global one.
 If it is of any help I made this blog post explaining how to achieve this: https://www.rahuljuliato.com/posts/eslint-on-emacs

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Does anyone have advice on the best library for loading images from image files and processing them? The two options I've come across for loading images from files (for example, jpg files) are Juicy Pixels and Friday, more specifically, friday-devil. The issues are:
 1) Juicy Pixels can load images, but it seems to be quite slow. Loading an image representation from a jpg file runs substantially slower than doing the same thing in other compiled languages, like Go and Nim.
 2) Friday seems pretty far out-of-date, and I run into dependency conflicts when I try to use friday-devil.
 Can anyone suggest alternate possibilities? Or is there something more I could do with Juicy Pixels, to run it more efficiently? I tried adding ghc-options: -O2 in the executable stanza of my cabal file, but this didn't have any discernible effect.
 To further complicate things, ideally I'd like to find a solution that allows compiling the program as a static binary. I dunno if that will be an option if I use a solution (or develop my own) based on a C library.
 Thanks for any suggestions.

 I’m making a library and executable and having a tough time!
 In my library I have: ~~~ frameworks: WebKit ~~~ But the final executable that links to the library doesn’t link to WebKit. Is this a bug? Or am I doing something wrong?
 I’ve tried adding the framework to the executable as well, but it still won’t show up in otool.
 Edit: To further explain the situation. I have a c++ library (the source, I’m not linking to it) which presents a c interface which I add using cxx-sources in the cabal file. This uses the WebKit framework on Mac OS. I then have a hsc file which exposes the c functions to Haskell.
 I then use this Haskell library and it crashes because the framework isn’t linked.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to add LaTex support for my blog. I started out with this template which uses slick as opposed to Hakyll since it seemed less daunting. After looking through the codebase, I realised that I needed to modify the mdtoHTML function in app/Main.hs by adding writerExtensions which I found here to render the LaTex in the Markdown. This is the function after I've made my modifications:
 mdToHTML :: T.Text -> Action Value mdToHTML = markdownToHTMLWithOpts markdownOptions htmlOptions where markdownOptions :: ReaderOptions markdownOptions = def { readerExtensions = fold [ extensionsFromList [ Ext_yaml_metadata_block , Ext_fenced_code_attributes , Ext_auto_identifiers , Ext_footnotes , Ext_link_attributes , Ext_pipe_tables ] , githubMarkdownExtensions ] } htmlOptions = def { writerExtensions = fold [ extensionsFromList [ Ext_tex_math_dollars , Ext_tex_math_single_backslash , Ext_latex_macros , Ext_fenced_code_blocks , Ext_backtick_code_blocks , Ext_fenced_code_attributes ] ] } 
 However, after building and running the site, I noticed that anything enclosed in $..$, $$...$$ and \[...\] still down get rendered at all. I'm not sure what to do. Any suggestions?

Instead of seeing main frame through it, I see my desktop background. I wonder if this is even supported or if I'm doing something wrong. I'm in KDE plasma waylaynd and I have built emacs (couple days ago) from sources without PGTK (because with PGTK was very slow in my setup).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi there, I'm getting to know Quill and while I like its concepts and what it offers in comparison with other JDBC libraries, I'm still trying to assess its limitations. The documentation is very short and to be honest i feel like it doesn't cover even half of questions one can have while learning the library. There are only few examples for the most basic cases, then when it comes to the Contexts section there are almost none. I have no idea when to use "lazy val ctx = new PostgresJdbcContext(SnakeCase, "ctx")" and when to simply use "quill: Quill.Postgres[SnakeCase]" from the Getting Started section.
 There are 6 JDBC dialects provided by the library - H2Dialect, MySQLDialect, PostgresDialect, SqliteDialect, SQLServerDialect, OracleDialect. I wanted to ask if Quill can also be used for other databases maybe for some more generic queries, or is it better to choose a different tool for other RDB?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Let's define a simple record:
 data R = R { r :: Bool } 
 Now, with DataKinds and KindSignatures on, we can attempt to use it like this:
 data X (r :: R) = X type XR1 = X ('R True) type XR2 = X ('R { r = True }) 
 The definition of XR1 compiles without issues, but XR2 gives an error:
 app/Main.hs:12:22: error: parse error on input ‘=’ | 12 | type XR2 = X ('R { r = True }) | ^ 
 Something very similar happens when we try to pattern match at the type level. With TypeFamilies enabled:
 type family F (r :: R) where F ('R True) = () F ('R { r = True }) = () 
 The first equation works fine, but the second one results in an identical error message:
 app/Main.hs:16:15: error: parse error on input ‘=’ | 16 | F ('R { r = True }) = () | ^ 
 One final example (the error is still the same):
 type R1 = 'R True -- Ok type R2 = 'R { r = True } -- Error 
 What is going on here? When using records as values, the two ways to construct and pattern match on records are equivalent (as far as I know). Why are they treated so differently when used at the type level?

 "minibuffer-with-setup-hook" runs the function before the buffer is active so it's not possible to just "setq major-mode" inside of it.
 EDIT: I guess just changing the keymap temporarily will do the trick, since I just need the arrow keys to move the cursor in another window.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello. I am having issues with my parser combinators in this code: https://play.haskell.org/saved/WQpzwZAM (You can change the input binding to test out the parser) The issue is that I am unable to parse function application: when appP's left is defined like left <- absP, it errors with: hs ghci> parseTest (exprP <* eof) "let x = \\x -> x + 1 in x 1" 1:26: | 1 | let x = \x -> x + 1 in x 1 | ^ unexpected '1' expecting end of input, symbol, or white space  I believe the issue here is that left <- absP always expects an abstraction as the LHS of an application, while in this situation, it is a Var. I have tried to replace it with left <- parens absP <|> varP, but it errors in a different place here: hs ghci> parseTest (exprP <* eof) "let x = \\x -> x + 1 in x 1" 1:17: | 1 | let x = \x -> x + 1 in x 1 | ^^^^^ unexpected "+ 1 i" expecting "false", "let", "true", '"', '(', '\', alphanumeric character, integer, or white space  Seemingly because it parses x + 1 as an application, and it doesn't let the exprP do it's job of parsing operators? So I had the thought process of "maybe, if I make valP do ... <|> try appP <|> ... instead of ... <|> appP <|> ... so that it backtracks, exprP would get to the binary operators before appP," and I tried to change the code for that, but I think that's a dead end.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I know it sounds cryptic but I just happen to want to type Cyrillic on a spanish layout keyboard. I am able to do so by using this:
  (require 'quail) ;; Define a custom keyboard layout (setq quail-keyboard-layout-es "\ \ ºª1!2\"3·4$5%6&7/8(9)0='?¡¿ \ qQwWeErRtTyYuUiIoOpP`^+* \ aAsSdDfFgGhHjJkKlLñÑ´¨çÇ \ <>zZxXcCvVbBnNmM,;.:-_ \ " ) (add-to-list 'quail-keyboard-layout-alist `("pc105-es" . ,quail-keyboard-layout-es)) (quail-set-keyboard-layout "pc105-es") (add-hook 'after-change-major-mode-hook (lambda () (unless (or (minibufferp) (member (buffer-name) '("*scratch*" "*Messages*" "*Help*")) (derived-mode-p 'shell-mode 'eshell-mode 'term-mode 'dired-mode)) (set-input-method "russian-computer")))) 
 The problem is that characters `^ which should print cyrillic letter х and characters ´¨ which should print cyrillic character э are compound -> which means they are used for vocals like àâ áä through the use of use of dead keys (keys which are used to modify other characters and print not by themselves unless typed twice), however I'm into the problem that despite creating my own keyboard layout emacs still makes me type those dead characters twice and its annoying.
 Do you know how can I deactivate this behaviour?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello. I've looked around but I can't quite find a good guide to haskell for people with a background in agda. Forgive me if I missed something.
 I am very familiar with using agda as a proof assistant, but haven't used it too much as a programming language. I am interested in learning more about using agda as a programming language. A (somewhat distant goal) is being able to solve advent of code problems in agda.
 But, agda doesn't have that many existing libraries. So I'd like to learn haskell to get the feel for how one should write programs in a functional language. I figure learning haskell is useful for other reasons as well. So I want to give it an honest go. I'd like to be able to solve some advent of code problems in haskell.
 Does anybody know a good introduction to haskell for someone fairly familiar with agda, but who has only used agda for formal verification? I am very familiar with the lambda calculus and type systems, algebraic data type, inductive types, and pattern matching, etc. I mostly need a crash course in syntax, important functions, input and output, and whatever else I might be missing from the agda proof assistant side of things.
 Thanks in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I have recently switched to Emacs (& Org-Mode, probably not an uncommon sentence ya'll have heard :)) specifically for doing writing (non fiction & fiction.) Almost all of my use-cases work perfectly with the export: =C-c C-e l p= and I'm done. However, sometimes I am in need of just raw regular ascii text of the content.
 Here's the problem: I write using semantic line breaks, Headers, annotations with comments, etc. All the good org-mode stuff. So I just export it to ascii instead of trying to copy from the buffer. Unfortunately, in ascii export it breaks off each line at 72 characters.
 Now, I know there is a variable (org-ascii-text-width) but I tried setting it to a very large value and it just breaks. I can't adjust this value per export. Is there any way I can just turn off the hard-line wrapping feature of the ascii export? 
 Sorry for the long-winded explanation of a very simple problem, but after awhile searching I haven't found a very satisfactory answer (besides a mailing list response of 'No you can't, just write an elisp macro to undo it.)

 So I come from experience in .NET and I'm trying to learn Scala and functional programming paradigm. I got very interesting because it sounded completely different from OOP and maybe knowing both could enhance my skill set and problem solving.
 Anyway, I started learning, and immediately hit the wall with all 3rd party libraries and understanding what is useful, what is not. What libraries I should learn, which I should not. Seems that Scala without Cats is not pure FP. There is a akka library, which is so big and heavy, that I even consider If I want to touch that.
 In .NET you kinda have everything out of the box, most of the thing you want to achieve, you can by using standart library. And in Scala, seems that standart library is minimal on purpose.
 I would like to ask if anyone could share some tips or steps in understanding what should I learn in Scala. What are you actually using in your work environment. In real life scenarios.
 I feel like choice fatigue is starting to settle in me.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello All,
 I'm using the csl processor for my LaTeX export, which I think means that I'm using citeproc-el.
 Up until recently, this worked nicely for me. After an update, however, I'm getting some results and functionality that I don't prefer.
 What I'd like is simple and unlinked LaTeX like this:
 \footnote{Robert W. Snyder, \textit{The Voice of the City: Vaudeville and Popular Culture in New York} (New York: Oxford University Press, 1989), 12.}
 Instead, I'm now getting a much more complex output, which uses a "\cslbibitem" command defined in the preamble:
 \footnote{\cslbibitem{520}{Robert W. Snyder, \textit{The Voice of the City: Vaudeville and Popular Culture in New York} (New York: Oxford University Press, 1989), 12}.
 How do I get the simpler output?
 Thanks for any help!

 Previously I was using Sublime Text, the shortcut design of it felt very smooth and responsive, I even wrote many plugins for it. But as my customization requirements for editing became more and more personalized, I felt it was time to try other editors. Then, I had to choose between the Vim family and Emacs, and ultimately chose to systematically learn Emacs because I wanted to try Org-Mode.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi Everyone,
 I've been playing around with a parser exercise to try to understand applicatives and how they can be used to compose parsing functions together. I have a basic Parser type like this: (Full code Replit here)
 newtype Parser a = Parser {runParser :: String -> Either (String, Int) (a, String, Int)}
 The left side is a failure with the error message and char position, and the right side is a success with the value, the remaining string, and the char position.
 I made an Applicative instance for my parser type so that it would compose together and keep track of the char position in the original text as it moves along.
 instance Applicative Parser where pure :: a -> Parser a pure a = Parser g where g xs = Right (a, xs, 0) (<*>) :: Parser (a -> b) -> Parser a -> Parser b (Parser rp1) <*> (Parser rp2) = Parser f where f xs = case rp1 xs of Left (err, i) -> Left (err, i) Right (pf, s', i) -> g s' where g xs' = case rp2 xs' of Left (err, pos) -> Left (err, pos + i) Right (val, l, pos) -> Right (pf val, l, pos + i) 
 My problem is that the char position seems to work fine with single-level S-expressions:
 https://preview.redd.it/a2nipo5v8iad1.png?width=431&format=png&auto=webp&s=7bf1c9ccdbaa1038455de9a75e281a19da4bb812
 This wordks and it is exactly what I want it to do.
 But it does not work with embedded S-expressions! It just shows the error at the beginning of first embedding of an S-expression.

 The rest of the code can be found on this Replit link. Can anyone take a look at this code and help me out on my learning journey? Thanks so much!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone, I receive tons of logs everyday, and I store them in a separate directory 'tmp' with the hierarchy being based on the day's date %Y-%m-%d. I'd like to have the subdirectory corresponding to the day's date to be added as a bookmark (I am using bookmark-plus), but this must be updated everyday. - the new bookmark must be created and the old one must be removed.
 I am no dev, I tried to have something created with the help of Chatgpt... but it does not work. 
 A first bookmark was created, but the day after I received an error message (and the same everyday since then): "No such bookmark in bookmark list 'tmp-2024-07-04'"
 here is the code:
 ``` (require 'bookmark) (require 'time-date) 
 (defun my-create-date-based-bookmark () "Create a bookmark for the current date's directory and remove old date-based bookmarks." (interactive) (let* ((base-dir "~/tmp/") (date-str (format-time-string "%Y-%m-%d")) (date-dir (concat base-dir date-str)) (bookmark-name (concat "tmp-" date-str))) 
  ;; Ensure the directory exists (unless (file-directory-p date-dir) (make-directory date-dir t)) 
  ;; Add the new bookmark 
  (bookmark-set date-dir bookmark-name) (bookmark-prop-set bookmark-name 'filename date-dir) 
  ;; Remove old bookmarks matching the pattern (dolist (bm bookmark-alist) (let ((bm-name (car bm))) ```
 can someone help me with this function? thanks in advance

While react-native-svg has served React Native developers well for basic vector graphics, it often falls short when it comes to replicating the more complex effects seen in web applications. We’ll be integrating Skia for rendering sharp, efficient 2D graphics and Reanimated for creating fluid, responsive animations. Step-by-step, we’ll explore the setup, key coding techniques, and best practices to implement a dynamic image slider that is both smooth and visually stunning.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A question related to https://tyrian.indigoengine.io/ . Just curious, did anyone use tyrian to develop complicated forms? What would qualify as a complicated form? A form where you have fields that require front-end and back-end validation (and maybe back-end validation before the user submits the data), forms with drop-downs where the content of a drop-down depends on the selection in another field, forms with editable tables/grids or multiple read-only tables/grids whose data can be populated independently, forms where sections of a form are hidden or displayed based on other field values.
 I wonder if this pattern is conducive to developing such forms where the data can come from different sources. The examples I came across are simple forms and I am not sure what the code would look like if you have more complicated stuff.
 Thanks

I was worried about messing up my main base, but I want to use org-roam-node-find when I'm doing new research, both on old notes, and hot fresh new notes I just wrote down. I did it unprotected(no versioning or backup) sometimes ago and fucked that notebase up pretty bad that I abondanded it shortly after.
 I was thinking about writing a package specifically for this: creating a new org-roam-directory and combine search result of org-roam-node-find of the main one and the new one, but later I find out I would eventually want to merge the new one into the old one, which make it looks teriblly like a git dev branch.
 So my questions is has anyone tried something like this, to develop new node communitiy on a branch, and what are some probably caveats and watchouts for that?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been working on technicolor, an abstraction above the APIs that various custom themes and theme packs use to access the colors for the currently loaded theme in emacs (like doom-themes' doom-color and modus-themes' modus-themes-get-color-value).
 The impetus is straightforward: if you are a user of a variety of themes or theme packs and you want to use your current theme's color palette somewhere in elisp, but struggle to homogenize your code across all the possible themes you might have loaded at any given time, technicolor might be worth a look.
 It works by letting you define a "universal palette" of colors, which is a list of colors that can sensibly be accessed in a specified collection of themes, e.g. '(red green blue). You can then set rules for each theme (or group of themes) for exactly which color in the theme's palette the universal color accesses. You can set these rules on a per-theme basis within a theme pack as well.
 From there, accessing the current theme's color reduces to (technicolor-get-color 'color), where color is an element of your universal palette. Technicolor will dispatch the appropriate API function, which you might have to write yourself, depending on the theme. 
 It also provides some basic color manipulation wrapping the color library, with the same ethos that accessing the colors should be via the universal palette.

 Of course, not an easy data type, but a great way to learn more about inductive data types in practice. I have managed to implement everything up to appending trees, which is what this question is about. 
 Source code exists here. Because it was a lot of work trying to figure out exactly how to implement append, I reused the functions in the source code. In my version, however, I do not use a Measured (there is no value, this comes later in the paper). Apart from that, everything is the exact same. However, on every single function (appendDigits1, appendDigits2, appendTree1, etc.) there is the error described in the title whenever I use Node2 or Node3 as an input for any of the functions that expects a as an input. For example: 
 addDigits1 m1 (One a) b (One c) m2 = appendTree1 m1 (Node3 a b c) m2 
 causes the error in the title, where 
 appendTree1 :: FingerTree (Node a) -> a -> FingerTree (Node a) -> FingerTree (Node a) 
 This is of course strange, because in the source code, they use the exact same abstraction where they feed appendTree1 a Node type as second input, without trouble. When I edit all occurrences of a to Node a, the error simply moves to the Node type itself, saying that Node3 constructor cannot take Node a as an input and expects a, even though Node3 (Node2 a b) (Node2 c d) (Node2 e f) is a perfectly valid output. Also, a should be an abstraction from Node a as far as I know. 
 What is happening?

 Are there recent guides for automating CI testing of Haskell projects on GitLab.com?
 Specifically, setting up .gitlab-ci.yml files to run the tests in Haskell libraries with stack, against different LTS snapshots or different GHC versions?
 A few years ago I created one based on snippets I'd found in existing repositories. It used the fpco/stack-build:latest docker image:
 https://gitlab.com/robstewart57/gitlab-haskell/-/blob/master/.gitlab-ci.yml
 Alas, it no longer works:
 https://gitlab.com/robstewart57/gitlab-haskell/-/jobs/7250651651
 Any suggestions on getting a CI script, which runs this library's tests against multiple versions of LTS (or at least multiple GHC versions), would be much appreciated!

 I hope someone can help me. I am trying to work in emacs-jupter with REPL-client. I have set up and installed everything as recommended in emacs-jupyter and at first glance everything seems to work.
 If I run `M-x jupyter-run-repl` I can select one of the installed kernels and a new Ipython buffer opens:
 Launching org_test kernel...
 Starting org_test kernel process...done
 Launching org_test kernel...done
 Requesting kernel info...done
 However, if I then execute `M-x jupyter-interaction-mode` in the original buffer and then try to send code with `C-c C-c` I get: 
 "Wrong type argument: "Not a valid client", nil, jupyter-current-client"
 Interestingly, when I try to establish a connection with `M-x jupyter-rep-associate-buffer`, no client is recognised and a new one is opened into which I cannot write with the same error.
 When I select a connection file with `M-x jupyter-connect-repl` a new ipython buffer opens with Requesting kernel info...done When I try to transfer code, jupyter-current-client is still nil. (same error)
 When I work with org-mode code-blocks and select a kernel, emacs-jupyer works.
 Is there any information that can narrow down the problem?

 My current config is
 (setq org-super-agenda-groups '( (:name "In Progress" :todo "INPR" ) (:name "Todo" :todo "TODO" ) (:name "Waiting" :todo "WAIT" ))) 
 which displays the undated TODOs nicely below the time grid, grouped by their state. But the items with a date associated are not displayed correctly:
 https://i.sstatic.net/EDSXKLUZ.png
 Enhancing my groups definition by a time-grid selector:
 (setq org-super-agenda-groups '( (:time-grid t) (:name "In Progress" :todo "INPR" ) (:name "Todo" :todo "TODO" ) (:name "Waiting" :todo "WAIT" ))) 
 fixes the agenda view but makes the "Global list of TODO items" printed ungrouped.
 How can I have both, a time-grid with correctly placed icons for icons that have a date and a grouped global TODO list?
 An example org file:
 * TODO Today's item with time <2024-06-19 Mi 14:00> that does not apear on the time-grid, but below * TODO some non-dated item which appears correctly 
 Disclaimer: this is cross-post, but I received no reply at StackExchange and org-super-agenda GitHub.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been using Emacs for a very long time, but I've never done much beyond very basic tasks. Recently, I moved back to Linux on my desktop, and I'm using Emacs a lot more, so I started running Emacs as a user service systemctl --user enable emacs.service and aliased the Emacs command to emacsclient. 
 I'm having some trouble on a few items and was wondering if y'all could provide some advice:
  
Is there a way, from a shell cmdline, to start emacsclient in magit mode? I find myself either launching with an unnecessary dired buffer with emacsclient . or a useless scratch buffer if I use emacsclient -t. 
 
Let's say I have previous opened files A, B, C, D, and then quit out of emacsclient. If I run emacsclient E, if I C-x k on E, the client exits. However, if I C-x k on those other buffers, they're killed normally and the client continues running. Is there a way so that killing that "E" buffer doesn't exit the client?
 
I need some recommendations for packages that help me handle buffers. C-x b is getting way too annoying, especially combined with the previous point where if I kill the "launching file" it kicks me out of the client. I'm broadly thinking of some kind of tab bar or side frame that lists buffers (with some file path) that has good navigation. I do a lot of work that involves using the shell and manpages, and it's so obnoxious how those buffers use an asterisk...
 
 Thanks!

I want to either edit or completely rewrite this mode but I have some questions about how Elisa works.
  
Currently the mode is supposed to automatically format object code and this works with any object declared with the language’s Object or Class keywords but if you create a class called (for example) Room it won’t recognize that word as declaring an object and thus won’t format it correctly. Would it be possible upon opening an Inform 6 file to have the mode dynamically identify such objects and format them correctly, or is that impossible? Currently I’m having to add the names of new objects manually to the package just to get it to format code correctly, and honestly even without doing that the package seems to get confused fairly easily.
 
Are there any good tutorials on creating a language major mode from scratch? I am interested in learning some lisp anyway so will already be consulting the GNU documentation, but really any kind of quick primer to understand how Elisp “talks” to the rest of the editor might help speed things up a bit.

 I have read extensively on this issue, but I have not found a solution.
 I am running Emacs within a terminal on Linux. The terminal emulator I am using is "foot". The linked page has a section with information relevant to the issue, found here.
 When I use Emacs, the Backspace character correctly deletes a character before the point. When I press Control+Backspace (C-BackSpace), Emacs understands this input as "C-h". This behaviour is understandable, because upon invoking "C-h v term-file-aliases", I see that the "foot" type is associated with the "xterm" alias. I take this to mean that "foot" implements the "xterm" terminfo, which has a particular specification here, that explains something about ^H and the BackSpace key.
 The README.md for "foot" has a section about what is tran…]]></summary>

Check the calc section of the emacs manual. Any function available in calc is available in org-mode tables. Calc functions are named calcFun-<name>. They are meant to be used infix in org tables. You can also use describe-function and completion to find functions.
 
Many calcFunc-<name> functions take a vector as a parameter. Usually this vector is composed of strings (even if the function is numeric). The converstion from strings to numbers if done automatically.
 
You can define new functions for calc by defining a function using defun and naming it calcFun-<name>. I recommend you look at the definition of a function in the emacs source code.

Can Zettels be printed onto paper without programming or maestro? I record notes digitally and want to keep them in an A5 spiral binder for reference. I use both The Archive and ia Writer to make Zettels.


an I automatically update the format of all my Zettels so they're consistent? I've tried different templates and would like to remove the YAML formatting instead of a simplified design and one that doesn't hide tags and ID numbers when printed.


My current workflow involves using Zettels to take notes as I learn more about ADHD. Some of these Zettels contain strategies for coping with ADHD and include links to other Zettels that provide additional context and research.
I want to carry these notes in an A5 binder so that they are available when needed. Many of the programming solutions are over my head, but there could be an easy way to update Zettels to the same format and print them. I know iA Writer has an export template function, but I'm no coder. 
Thanks for any advice you can provide!]]></summary>

 I’ve been playing with a tiny major mode that I threw together. Seems to do the job, but wondering if there’s something already out there?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently implemented the jinx "enchanted spell checker" and am overall impressed with the performance and functionality of the package. My configuration below modifies the `jinx-include-faces` to only check comments; text in `org-mode` and `text-mode` are also checked.
 However, I noticed that jinx behaves different in org-mode and prog-mode. Specifically, spelling errors in a comment of a code block are only flagged when I open the `org-edit-special` buffer. The text properties for a given comment in an src-block is `(font-lock-comment org-block)`. When I add `(org-mode font-lock-comment-face)` to my definition of `jinx-include-faces` spell check is effectively turned off across my `org-mode` buffer (`jinx-mode` is still active). I am aware of `jinx-exclude-faces` and that many faces in `org-mode` are excluded by default. Yet when I remove faces like `org-block` from that list, the entire src-block including variable definitions and functions are flagged as misspelled.
 Has anyone implemented `jinx` in `org-mode` in this way?
 (use-package jinx :hook (org-mode text-mode prog-mode conf-mode) :custom (jinx-include-faces '((conf-mode font-lock-comment-face) (prog-mode font-lock-comment-face))))

I also tried to make it "production ready" by adding build and test tools e.g. it comes with simple Make targets and with unit and integration tests that use testcontainers to spin up the database and web application to test against.
 It uses PostgreSQL by default but can work with any database supported by the persistent ORM, and handles migrations, model creation and more.
 It's based on the awesome servant-persistant example by Matt Parsons (https://github.com/parsonsmatt/servant-persistent) and it's licensed under MIT.
 The template is available on Github here:

 Hope this is useful to someone! <3

I'd like to know more about the editor, it's a harder to find the specific capabilities of emacs bc everywhere I look people just say that it's "theoretically possible to do everything with it" but even if my editor is Turing Complete and can run doom or be an OS by itself I'd like to know what are the realistically achievable things that I can do with emacs without going through years of learning and configuration. I'd like to also keep nvim bc terminal but this is probably my second favorite code editor (or IDE). I think it would be nice to see what needs you had that emacs covered for you individually, I don't care how niche it is. Ty in advance.

 I start the emacs daemon automatically on login using the following command:

My worry is that I hear with large amount of data in tables and formulas it's slow... Would it be a paranoia to decide it doesn't fit my financing requirements on the basis of it being slow down the line or is it at the point where you can throw thousands of pieces of rows into it without a stutter?

 But when I press '[' I get additional logbook entries because this is bounded to the function org-agenda-manipulate-query-add.
 I am not sure what variable to change to change the face of these entries. Does anybody know?

But we noticed that over the years, large and badly compressed images take up a ton of space on our hosting provider 
So today (2024-07-01) we're introducing a size upload limit of 2000x2000 pixels, where larger images will be downscaled.
That should fit a whole screen's worth of a non-retina screenshot -- and retina ones should compress without much loss for the viewer, so every picture should look crisp enough for sharing/consumption here while not inflating our bills.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Posting this in case anyone else runs into the problem I'm seeing. When trying to install emacs-plus, either from a bottle or build, the clone attempt would fail repeatedly:
 Failure while executing; `/usr/bin/env git clone --branch emacs-30 --config advice.detachedHead=false --config core.fsmonitor=false https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs.git /.../emacs-plus@30--git` exited with 128. Here's the output: Cloning into '/.../Library/Caches/Homebrew/emacs-plus@30--git'... error: RPC failed; curl 56 Recv failure: Connection reset by peer error: 999 bytes of body are still expected fetch-pack: unexpected disconnect while reading sideband packet fatal: early EOF fatal: fetch-pack: invalid index-pack output 
 There are several "it might be your network connection, it could be something else" threads out and around. I've got a high speed fiber connection and traffic was light and latency was fine.
 What finally worked for me was to make some updates to my global git config:
 [core] packedGitLimit=512m packedGitWindowSize=512m [pack] deltaCacheSize=2047m packSizeLimit=2047m windowMemory=2047m 
 Upping the default for http.postBuffer to 4 gig was also suggested. If you do that, be sure to set it back to the default.
 Another suggestion was to change the core.compression to 9. I didn't mess with that. It was the inverse of the suggestion to turn off compression and do shallow clones manually ... I didn't want to get anywhere near that sort of approach.
 I have some questions about running with a daemon on Mac still, but I'll ask separately if I don't figure it out. Hope this saves someone some time.

In PDF software, this is accomplished by adding a Highlight Annotation (e.g. keyboard shortcut 5 in Okular). In LibreOffice, the keyboard shortcut is broken but one can use the menubar to add Character Highlighting (actually applies to more than one character, but this is the name used).
 How can I mark up small sections of inline text in my Org mode documents, so that when they are exported with Pandoc it will use real PDF Annotations or real LibreOffice Character Highlighting?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all!
 I've been using Emacs for a while so far, but there is a thing that bothers me quite a lot: dual-space CJK fonts and their alignment.
 CJK programming fonts usually provide both half-width characters (for Latin alphabets) and full-width characters (for CJK characters). Thus, when rendering, the width of a full-width characters must exactly equal to that of two half-width characters.
 This is where Emacs fails; even fonts like Sarasa Gothic (which I know that they line up nicely elsewhere) will not line up when I actually use them. This is especially annoying when editing tables on Org-mode or Markdown, since the columns don't line up.
 I've noticed for two Korean programming fonts I purchased (semteulche and hesalche) the characters line up if and only if the font height is set to exactly 110 and 120 respectively (or their integer multiples). I could repeat this process for all fonts, but in my HiDPI screen, I'd like to have my fonts taller than at least 130.
 Basically, what happens is below:
 \"hesalche\", height 120. They line up nicely.
 \"hesalche\", height 140 (which is my preferred font height). Columns start breaking up.
 \"hesalche\", height 240. 240 is an integer multiple of 120, so the columns are back straight.
 Is there a way to fix this problem?
 Here is the relevent section in my WIP configuration file.
 Thanks!

 #+NAME: factorial #+BEGIN_SRC haskell :results silent :exports code :var n=0 fac 0 = 1 fac n = n * fac (n-1) #+END_SRC 
 The :results silent :exports code :var n=0 part is the header arguments.
 I'm writing an exporter. I have a function that is exporting the source block, but I'm not sure how to access the header arguments.
 The purpose here is to have some custom header arguments. I see there are also switches, but I'm not sure the difference between switches and header arguments, except for that switches seem to need to be a single character long.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I left the language for a little while and I've been diving back in for the past few months. Around the time I left the standard way seemed to define all your effects through composing the various Monads provided by mtl. Towards the end of my time with Haskell however the consensus seemed to be forming that you really only need Reader over IO, using a sort of "God Object" like AppT or Env that holds all of your configurations and application state, and you would define more granular "XMonad, YMonad, ZMonad" types for particular effects, which the base AppT would then instance.
 Coming back I see a lot of buzz around algebraic effects, in particular polysemy seems to be the standout example. It seems pretty ergonomic, although I still have no clue how type level lists work or when they were introduced, so that's something I'll have to get up to speed on. Is this something that I should be using going forward, or is it still in research mode, and I should stick with the standard mtl for now?

 Goals: 
 * Most text is black with only key elements highlighted
 * Only one color used: goldenrod which matches the rest of my theme well. I'm still deciding if I need a darker variant for string/constants or not.
 * de-emphasize/distinguish comments

 * bold keywords

 I would like to have a keybinding to
  
copy the defun/function the point is in into the kill ring
 insert the current file+line of the point into the buffer of the 'other window'
  
The first one is to easily share a function with coworkers.
 The second one to easily write breakpoint locations into a debugger script file (gdb) that is open in the other window.
 Now, how can I determine the current function name the point is in, especially the "fully qualified name"? Example for C++:
 class C { int func() { // point here: I need "C::func", not "func" at this point } }; 
 I'm aware of which-function-mode, but that one reports "func" and not the fully qualified name "C::func".
 Any other ideas? :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 I hope this is okay to be posted here - this is a Haskell and Nix question. I have been trying to build a version of GHC that uses -fPIC with Nix. I have managed to do this and can use this version of GHC in a development shell, but I have had difficulty getting that version of GHC used when building the project with Nix. When running `nix build`, I get lots of linker errors to do with libraries not being built with -fPIC, but I can build the project just fine with `cabal build`.
 Here is my flake.nix file that I am using to build a shared library (it just exports one function that squares an int).
 Any advice on how to get `callCabal2nix` to use the custom GHC would be greatly appreciated!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I work with a lot of Org files which have several top-level headline, some of which have nested headlines 2 or 3 levels deep in the subtree. Recently, I've found that after working on one of these subtrees for a while and collapsing the heading, TAB no longer unfolds that particular subtree, while others can be unfolded. Visually,
 * Heading 1: won't unfold... * Heading 2: unfolds Blah Blah Blah 
 hitting TAB, or even C-c C-r (org-fold-reveal) has no effect on Heading 1. This sometimes occurs for higher level headlines in a subtree as well.
 Has anyone else noticed this behavior? (And hopefully found a fix?)
 This could be as a result of various settings I have in my init.el, including
 (setq org-support-shift-select 'always) (setq org-cycle-separator-lines 1) (setq org-cycle-emulate-tab t) 
 and the fact that I use EVIL key-bindings.
 I'm using Emacs 29.1, Org mode version 9.6.6.

 This works out of the box by specifying perspective-map in general-define-key:
  (general-define-key :prefix "SPC" "p" '(perspective-map :which-key "perspective") ... ) 
 Pressing SPC p opens up the minibuffer with all of the perspective commands!

Thanks to the Doom Emacs shipping, I knew of magit, projectile, LSPs and other utilities, but Emacs itself always came with wonderful "utilities" (e.g., M-x doctor, hanoi, calc, calendar, org ...) and just only to mention an example, I recently knew of M-x re-builder which I found awesome when doing M-x replace-regexp.
 In the end, I always feel like I'm not aware of a lot of functionalities in Emacs which are there, at my finger tips and thus the question, what are your favorite services/utilities/functions available in (Doom)Emacs?

However, my company is using kotlin and golang a lot and I want to understand the advantages of scala like type safe, correctness, compile-time error checking, etc. so that I can convince my company to use scala as well. Can you recommend any papers, blogs, videos, github repositories to learn these things? If there is a cost, I would be willing to pay.

In latest ellama release (already on MELPA) was added new command ellama-solve-reasoning-problem that implements Absctraction of Thought technique. It uses a chain of multiple messages to LLM and help it to provide much better answers on reasoning problems. Even small LLMs like phi3-mini provides much better results on reasoning tasks using AoT. I hope it can be useful. Also it can be reference implementation for your own chains.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I wanted to have a way to temporarily run a command without an alias in Eshell, which is command grep or \grep in bash. After many attempts, this seems to work (entered in Eshell; to put in alias file, remove both of the '):
 alias command 'export original=${alias | grep -h --color=never "^alias $1 " | head -n 1 | sed "s/alias $1 //"} && alias $1 && $1 ${cdr ${listify $*}}; alias $1 $original && unset original' 
 I have to set the grep color flags because I also have grep aliased.
 I just wanted to post this in case anybody else wants it, or if I'm stupid and there's a much better way to do this, or if it could be simplified/turned into elisp.
 Welcome to the Emacs shell ~ $ alias command 'export original=${alias | grep -h --color=never "^alias $1 " | head -n 1 | sed "s/alias $1 //"} && alias $1 && $1 ${cdr ${listify $*}}; alias $1 $original && unset original' ~ $ alias rm 'echo "no"' ~ $ rm test no ~ $ command rm test ~ $ cat test /usr/bin/cat: test: No such file or directory ~ $ rm whatever no

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I love to use emacs in batch mode for text manipulation. I have done it so much I started to enjoy it and started code golfing with elisp. Its great but there are a lot of long function names like "with-temp-buffer" that could be assigned to a single character. Also it should automatically output the current buffer to stdout and argv arguments could be easier to retrieve.
 Sure common lisp would probably be better for most answers but my brain has been trained to do things in a emacs buffer and by god thats how its gonna be!
 Long story short, lots of tweaks could be made to make elisp code shorter albeit harder to read. I considered byte compiling the code but it was actually more bytes! Maybe the solution is to use keyboard hotkeys? Or maybe the solution is a custom golfing language interpreted by elisp
 Would appreciate any questions or suggestions on this topic.

 I started with a couple functions to upload files, but then I wanted to list files...and a few days later I was putting it all in an independent package, yak shaving be blessed. 
 I hope someone else finds it useful! There are a few things to improve, but from my testing the last few days it works well. Probably the most glaring omission is recursive uploads/downloads. And maybe caching.

 from an emacs instance running inside the same container, everything works fine. But if I run that same code from an emacs instance running on my host outside the container, I just get
 [jsonrpc] Server exited with status 256 
 I have no clue what this error code is, I cannot find it in the docs. I am not sure why this is happening, given that I exposed the port and the code works fine from within the container.

It is really handy for rust, since the compiler is so thorough, and it makes refactoring much less tedious. Ultimately, I probably use less than a quarter of the tools and features in emacs and many of the packages I have, so I suspect that there are dozens of game-changing tools right under my nose. What are some of your favorites, and how do you like to use them?

In this part of the course, we discuss Haskell code with side effects, such as terminal input and output, disk access, networking, random numbers, global state, and more. We motivate and introduce the IO type that is being used for side-effecting expressions. We learn how to compose IO actions, do notation, and how to combine the functional programming techniques we have been using so far with the world of IO.

 Haskell has evolved a lot since the '98 standard with lots of awesome features that many of us feel like we can't live without. At the same time it has, in my opinion, become cluttered and inconsistent partially due to incremental nature of these developments and the need for compatibility.
 This leaves me to ask:
 What what you do differently if you were redesigning a Haskell-like language from the ground up?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After about 20 years of living in emacs, my left thumb has started to hurt badly, and it's because keyboards place the left Alt key so far to the left that I have to bend my thumb inwards to hit it.
 BTW, I used to hit CTRL by curling up my left pinky, but now I use mechanical keyboards which allow me to press it with the left side of my palm, so, no pinky stress anymore.
 Anyway, back to the Alt. I'm trying to rewire my brain to use ESC instead of the Alt. Or, in cases where I need it pressed continuously (e.g. M-b M-b M-b to keep going back a word), I try to use the right Alt key with my right thumb. (A key almost never used.) It's not easy, the muscle memory is strong, but I try.
 Do others here have the same problem? Any good suggestions?

 Right now running my/open-frame opens new frame as expected and shows my/transient at the bottom. Issues: 1) transient menu disappears the moment window loses focus. 2) if I exit this newly created window then going back to main instance of emacs will show this transient menu 3) transient menu not fullscreen. 
 This is how new created frame looks now https://i.imgur.com/lsVqIWx.png (shows currently opened buffer in my emacs and then shows my transient menu at the bottom)
 Ideal goal is something like doomemacs +org-capture/open-frame
 https://i.imgur.com/P76yrAd.png full height. Would love to be able to remove modeline too and show it afterwards doing refiling/capturing process. 
 Is there any packages or examples how I could achieve this?

 So I found it has a variable to enable recursing:

This should probably be disabled by default, because e.g. `org-directory' may include deeply nested directories of non-Org files, such as a \".git\" directory, Org attachments directories, etc, which would make it slow to list the `org-directory' files recursively." :type 'boolean) 
 I use doom, so I set it in my `doom.d/config.el`
 (setq org-ql-search-directories-files-recursive t) 
 Restarted emacs and it still doesn't recurse into the dirs. Did I configure it wrong?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sorry for the confusing title, but I'm having trouble describing my problem.
 I find window behavior in emacs is very difficult to understand. There are many commands that either create a new window or replace the current buffer with a "temporary" buffer (eg help window). And some commands simply replace the buffer in current window, some replace the buffer in the other window, still others create a new split. And when something takes over an existing window, sometimes when quitting it returns the previous buffer, and other times it removes the window altogether.
 So far I have not been able to discern a method to this madness and I am often surprised by what happens. A lot of winner-undo.
 First question: is there any underlying logic here I'm not seeing? Or is it just a free for all?
 Second question: how do you handle this? Memorize/internalize how each command will behave? Rely heavily on winner mode? Something else? 
 I recently stumbled on popper.el so was thinking to give that a try. Curious what others are doing.

I have a Docker file that’s on my Linux box which takes a very long time to build; I wanted to keep my monitor and keyboard connected to my mac so I could work on other stuff, so I just SSH’d into the Linux box in iTerm and ran docker build. When the build broke, I could switch to an Emacs buffer that was editing the Dockerfile on the Linux box, make edits, then re-run docker build. Once it finally worked, I fired up magit and it Just Worked™ and ran all the Git commands over SSH. So nice!
 What delights you about Emacs?

 cons: harder to navigate/reason about. May be daunting for other developers.
  
Divide into multiple files along sensible boundaries:
 Put common functionality in a main package.el file, and require it in all sub-files.
  
pros: clean division of concern.
 cons: supports one-way dependencies only: package.el cannot use capabilities of any of the sub-files without declaring them.
  
Require all sub-files in the main file:

I get contacted by recruiters occasionally but it seems I am never invited to an interview probably due to the fact that I have no professional job experiences in scala. I have been learning scara so far and practiced it, but I'm not sure what else I can do to have myself get a job in this new language. Would you be able to advise me? I am thinking of writing small libraries or participating in open source projects.

Competitive Programming in Haskell: sieving with mutable arrays by Brent Yorgey
This is one of those cases where for efficiency’s sake, we actually want to use an honest-to-goodness mutable array. Immutable arrays are not a good fit for sieving, and using something like a Map would introduce a lot of overhead that we would rather avoid. However, we only need the table to …]]></summary>

 The README for compile-multi was enough to get this to work; the meat of the code is reading the composer.json from the project path, selecting the "scripts" key and listing all available commands.
 Since not everyone is rocking Emacs with native JSON support, I wrapped everything in (json-available-p). That level of indentation makes me sad a bit :)
 It works as is, but tips are welcome:
  
Is there a way to check for JSON availability when wrapping this as a package/auto-loadable .el file?
 Do you have any code review suggestions? Like better combining (message ...) nil in the un-happy path?

Other than unit tests at an atomic level, every thing in the software development process is a kind of integration of pieces. This can be integration-in-the-small, like the integration of components, or it can be integration-in-the-large, such as the integration of services / APIs. While integration testing is essential, it is not without its challenges. In this blog post, we’ll explore the issues of speed, reliability, and maintenance that often plague integration testing processes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello guys, i'm new to emacs(started learning 2 days ago), i'm trying to swap ctrl key and meta using this:
 (setq x-ctrl-keysym 'meta)
 (setq x-meta-keysym 'ctrl)
 now it works fine under x11 but on wayland only ctrl key gets remapped and the meta doesn't get remapped so i end up with two meta keys (also i don't want WM level remapping). does anyone knows what should i do ? 
 thx in advance❤️

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey, I'm running Emacs on windows with C# for my job. Everyone else on my team uses Visual Studio (obviously) and the files are encoded with `UTF-8-BOM` or `utf-8-with-signature-dos` in Emacs speak. Emacs somehow wasn't reading these files properly and kept saying the encoding is ISO-LATIN-1 and would just print the BOM characters literally on the screen. I had no clue about all this except that I saw 3 weird characters every time I opened any file. So yesterday I decided to dig deep and gather whatever I can to fix this. After trying a few approaches what worked is `(prefer-coding-system 'utf-8-with-signature-dos)`. The files are read properly now and the language server is also happy. I use Sharper to build and run my project and it started failing after this change. It uses `shell-command-to-string` and others to run `dotnet` commands in the project. The commands fail with
 'ï»¿dotnet' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.
 The first 3 characters are BOM and windows command prompt cannot handle this encoding. Is there a way to fix this, either from Emacs side or from the windows command prompt side?
 EDIT: This is with GNU Emacs 29.1 on Windows 11.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There was a merge conflict in my configuration and now I'm getting an error when emacs loads my init.el. I think I understand the error but I'm unable to find the location. Here's the output from starting with --debug-init:
 Debugger entered--Lisp error: (invalid-read-syntax ")" 222 41) read(#<buffer *load*>) load-with-code-conversion("/home/brendan/.emacs.d/init.el" "/home/brendan/.emacs.d/init.el" t t) load("/home/brendan/.emacs.d/init" noerror nomessage) startup--load-user-init-file(#f(compiled-function () #<bytecode -0x145a64a60d8b432b>) #f(compiled-function () #<bytecode -0x1f3c61addc0b8a75>) t) command-line() normal-top-level() 
 I tried using goto-charto jump to 222 and 41. The first location is inside a simple setq and the other is a comment in the first line of the file. How can I get to the point where the extra, or missing parenthesis is causing the read error?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all
 I am using Eglot to connect to the typescript-language-server which is used for both ts and js. However, my project does not have TS, it's an older React project in plain JS.
 Now the problem is typescript-language-server will report type errors and throw the error on some JSX components that these cannot be used as JSX components which is really annoying. Is there any way to resolve this? In VSCode for example there is an option javascript.validate.enable": false to add to the editor config and it will not validate the JS files anymore, however, it will still provide code fix suggestions, like imports for example.
 If there is no way to do this, is there a way to at least somehow get the import fixes working or connect eglot to some eslint server if such exists instead of typescript-language-server?
 Thanks!
 EDIT: 
 The eglot code-actions do not work at all, I cannot fix imports anymore. Good thing is that I was able to get both eglot / eslint reports to show up in Flycheck, but code actions do not work and it still reports the type errors as well. Here's the current config that I have:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[i've been using anki-editor.el and i'm loving it. i use it alongside org-roam to build a network of knowledge, while at the same time, create flashcards. however, there are times that i cannot write a flashcard using org-mode. an example is when i use my phone / another person's computer, or when i write a card with image occlusion enhanced.
 when i create a card in anki, i want it to show up on a defined org file as an entry (so i could then use a refile command to choose where i want it to go). is it possible to do this with a python script? i've seen people online use python as an automation tool for anki, and i wonder if that can also be applied this? thanks
