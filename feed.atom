        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Is there an org agenda function that allows you to jump to the next date which matches a particular keyword, without leaving the agenda buffer?
 I'm thinking of something like org-agenda-goto-date, except that it queries for a regex that matches the headline text, and goes to the next chronological match.
 I often want to search forward in the agenda to see when a particular appointment is, and what else is going on that day. The nearest thing I've found is to call org-agenda, do a keyword search, find the entry I was looking for, and then call org-agenda again and jump to that date. I'm sure there's an easier way of doing this, but I haven't found it.
 Thanks in advance!

 It can decrypt any optic example, code, or tutorial. Works with more-or-less any website (such as GitHub or hackage). It’s not perfect, but it gets the job done – lets me focus on the content and not get distracted by random operators. 
 You can find the code on GitHub and the extension in the Google web store.

 But when I hit S-RET in the leftmost cell in the last row, the next row isn't started with 2023-01-21, but with 2024-01-20. 
 | 2023-01-18 | 18.035 | 22.579 | | 2023-01-19 | 18.056 | 22.603 | | 2023-01-20 | 18.046 | 22.592 | 
 How can I make org-table-copy-down work with the days instead of the years? The variable org-table-copy-increment was set to t, I tried setting it to 1, but that didn't help.
 Thank you for any advice!

# Web and Internet Are Different Terms

It is common to observe people using the terms _Web_ and _Internet_ in such a way that it appears that both define the same concept: a giant invisible network that interconnects people and realities. However, it is important to understand that both terms have different meanings, although they are connected.

The Internet is the medium through which all information travels between servers and users. This information, being very general, needed to be contained in standards so that all connected devices could understand and communicate with each other. Therefore, the Internet is made up of applications that exercise this function of regulating communication through protocols.

The Web is an Internet application. It allows users to interact with servers through websites: interactive pages that allow navigation between files and pages present on the server.

 I'm happy to announce the third part of a five part tutorial on property-based testing stateful systems in general, and distributed systems in particular:
 https://github.com/stevana/property-based-testing-stateful-systems-tutorial/blob/main/docs/Part03SMContractTesting.md#readme
 In the previous part we introduced concurrent state machine testing to test for race conditions using linearisability.
 In this part we will build upon the second part and show how to test bigger systems in a modular way. We introduce the property-based testing equivalent of fast and deterministic integration testing against fakes and show how to ensure that the fakes are faithful to the real components.
 I hope to announce part four on fault-injection next week.
 Any questions, comments or suggestions are most welcome!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm using straight.el to manage Emacs packages, however for some reason I have incorrect Tramp version, at least this is how Tramp reports it via tramp-version command. The reason I ask about this is Ivy stopped working with su:: if I use Tramp installed by straight.el.
 If I put this in my config, then tramp-version reports 2.5.1.1 and Ivy doesn't work when I type su:: prompting an error:
 (straight-use-package 'tramp) 
 If I remove this line, then Tramp reports a newer version (the one that comes with Emacs 28.2 which I use), then Ivy works correctly.
 I checked files manually at straight/repos/tramp and it seems that the Tramp version should be 2.6.0, but for some reason it isn't. I can't even find a string 2.5.1.1 in the whole repo of Tramp so I'm not sure where it's coming from.

 I want my captions (only for code blocks) to look like what is shown in the goal of this post (possibly also with the numbering suppressed and the label changed from Listing to Code).
 My hope would be that by either writing #+caption: or #+attr_latex: :name [] above the #+SRC block that the desired effect would be reflected in the .tex file and ultimately the PDF.

 If you have read both books, can you pick me one option from the following: 
  
Read SICP only - (my guess: it's a great book about FP so you don't need to read "Functional Programming in Scala" any more) 
 Read "Functional Programming in Scala" only - (my guess: This book covers most of the general FP concepts in depth so no need to read SICP any more)
 Read SICP then "Functional Programming in Scala" - (my guess: "Functional Programing in Scala" doesn't tell FP thoughts in an easy-to-understand way so you want to read SICP at first)
 Read "Functional Programming in Scala" then "SICP" - (my guess: "Functional Programming in Scala" is in depth enough, but it doesn't cover FP topics outside Scala. So you want to read SICP later)

 I'm not sure it's possible after thrashing on it a bit last night and some googling, but I'm trying to come up with a boolean query that looks for anything with a Start >= 2022-01-01 and where the Fin date is >= 2023-01-01 or where the Fin date is /not/ present.
 So, as pseudocode: (start >= 2022-01-01) AND ( Fin >= 2023-01-01 OR Fin ""))
 Something like:
 tags "Type={.}+Start>="<2022-09-23>"+{ Fin>="<2023-01-01" \| Fin = "" }"
 So, first off,
  
Not quite sure to ask for a second condition (ie. >= and !=) on a prop. I've only seen +Fin={this \| that} example-wise
 How is a NOT done (I had assumed it was !=) but that does not give (my =] ) expected output. Can you even query on the non-presence/no-value of a property?
 Also, not sure those queries honour math order of ops?
  
Is there a way to create that query with those 3 properties or do I need to add another prop like Done: false to get around the above issues? (ie. Start in 2022 AND (Fin since 2023 OR DONE=false) )

I understand it's possible to pass a table and some other data types into a python script, but I can't find anything about passing headlines or the content of org files. 
 So in short it'd be cool if I could pass an inline python script a headline :ID: (or its name in the worst case) literate-programming style and then access its child headlines (and maybe even its :PROPERTIES: tags) as a structure to generate a graph from. 
 Does anyone know if this is possible, or if there's a way to achieve something similar? Thanks.

 Alas, running org-protocol needs to be authorized in Firefox. However, it used to ask for permission "once and for all", but after I made a fresh OS install, now Firefox asks for permission on every site I want to run org-protocol in, which is certainly inconvenient.
 I'm not sure the newer OS got me a more recent Firefox version (current is 109.0) for which the policy changed, or if something in my settings was lost along the way. Does anyone else get the same behavior? Does anyone know how to tell Firefox to just run org-protocol whatever the site?

 I'm new to emacs, and still going through a lot of tutorials. I'm trying to make some shortcuts in dired, but I seem to be missing something basic:
 ​
 (define-key dired-mode-map (kbd "C-c gdl") '(find-alternate-file "~/downloads")) 
 ​
 When i run this I get an error "Wrong type argument: commandp".
 ​
 Does anyone know what I am doing wrong? Maybe it has something to do with interactive and non-interactive functions (I only do a little coding as a hobby so I haven't learnt about that yet)?
 ​
 Also, I'd rather not use C-c as a prefix, but just use 'g' as a prefix for jumping to shortcuts in dired. Is there a way to set that up?
 ​
 Thanks.

I am trying to figure out how I can format the results of the below counsel-rg to remove the date and replace the underscore with spaces so it becomes easier for me to read rather than just showing me the file name.

 I also came across this link where the video shows the user's buffer changing to the contents of the file their cursor is hovering over and they can just cycle through the results and see the contents of each automatically. Currently, I use counsel-rg and then I move my cursor to the results, and then press enter to see the contents. I wanted to replicate the effect in the link but I am unsure how to make that happen. The following is the function that I call when using counsel-rg:
 (defun local/org-roam-rg-search () (interactive) (counsel-rg "" org-roam-directory))

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all,
 I am wondering whether the following is possible in Scala:
  
Given some vector x = (x_1, x_2, ..., x_n) in R^n and a function f that maps R^n to R, I would like to replicate this concept in Scala. The idea of Scala's partial function/currying should hold here (i.e. when applying a single value x_i, return a function that is defined only for a subset of its input domain). For example, when n = 2 define f(x, y) = sin(x + y), then trivially, f(2, y) = sin(2 + y).
  
However, the dimension (n > 0) may vary from case to case and may even be provided in input. Partial application for n = 2 is:
 def leftPartialFunction(f: (Double, Double) => Double)(x: Double): Double => Double = f(x, _) 
 but how can this be generalized for arbitrary n?
 For example, how can I apply the function in position i?Something like this I assume would not work ...
 def partialFunction(f: IndexedSeq[Double] => Double)(xi: Double): IndexedSeq[Double] => Double = .... // cannot work well with indexed seq as they are not "disjoint"

 I'm making a project-specific shell each time I make a new project. An example being:  {pkgs ? import <nixpkgs> {}, ...}: let projGhc = pkgs.haskellPackages.ghcWithHoogle (hpkgs: with hpkgs; [ JuicyPixels massiv ]); in pkgs.mkShell { buildInputs = [ pkgs.haskell-language-server projGhc ]; }  I then autoload this shell with lorri/direnv and hls works perfectly with lsp-mode, displaying haddock docs for the packages. But the "Documentation" and "Source" buttons just open an empty buffer. The minibuffer says File not found and directory write-protected.
 For example, trying to get to the docs for massiv's makeArray function opens a buffer titled Data-Massiv-Core.html#v:makeArray, located somewhere in the nix store. Checking, the file Data-Massive-Core.html does exist. However the docs do not show. Is the idea that the docs open in an external browser, or in emacs?
 Thanks for any help :)

 Basically the title. When I execute the following code in a Julia repl, 
 a=[0 0.5 0.5;0.75 0 0.25;0.75 0.25 0]; print(map(x->getindex(a^3,x),[1,4,7])) 
 I the definition for a is empty, as I've silenced the output with the semicolon.
 However, when I run this code from within org-mode, I get the following output: 
  #+RESULTS: : 3×3 Matrix{Float64}: : 0.0 0.5 0.5 : 0.75 0.0 0.25 : 0.75 0.25 0.0 : [0.1875, 0.40625, 0.40625] 
 That last row is the one I actually wanted to print, whereas the Matrix definition output should definitely not be there.
 I assume one of two things is happening: either org-mode is ignoring the semicolon when it executes the src block, resulting in this error, or julia is wigging out in the org-minibuffer since it's not in a vterm (which apparently matters to julia for some reason).
 I've referred to the julia specific docs, as well as the org-mode evaluation of code blocks and results of code execution docs, with no solution. 
 Any help would be greatly appreciated.

To record timelapses of drawings, just use the camera with the left hand while you paint with the right and record a couple of seconds.
Paul Heaston (@paulheaston) shared on Instagram that he's not using tools to hold his camera while he's recording sketches most of the time instead of using a table mount.
Usually, he picks up the phone mid-sketch with the left hand, draws with the right, and records the drawing process for a couple of seconds only to capture something interesting on video. Finally, combine the clips into 1 video.]]></summary>

 (>>=?) :: Monad m => m (Maybe a) -> (a -> m (Maybe b)) -> m (Maybe b) xm >>=? f = xm >>= \case Just x -> f x Nothing -> pure Nothing 
 or use MaybeT like
 (>>=?) :: Monad m => m (Maybe a) -> (a -> m (Maybe b)) -> m (Maybe b) xm >>=? f = runMaybeT $ do x <- MaybeT xm MaybeT $ f x 
 but the pattern seems common enough that I feel like there would be a "best practice" or accepted way to do so, or some existing operator, that I'm unaware of. It also feels like there should be some way to generalize Maybe to any instance of MonadFail but I haven't been able to figure that out.
 Is there a less verbose way of doing this, or are the two options above what I should stick with, or are there existing implementation(s) somewhere in some library/libraries that are accepted as the idiomatic way to do this?

 $ echo '#include "Rts.h"' > foo.c $ /opt/ghc/_build/stage1/bin/js-unknown-ghcjs-ghc -c foo.c -v3 /usr/bin/gcc -x c -c foo.c -o foo.o.tmp -fno-PIC -Wimplicit -include /opt/ghc/_build/stage1/lib/../lib/js-ghcjs-ghc-9.7.20230119/rts-1.0.2/include/ghcversion.h -I/opt/ghc/_build/stage1/lib/../lib/js-ghcjs-ghc-9.7.20230119/base-4.18.0.0/include -I/opt/ghc/_build/stage1/lib/../lib/js-ghcjs-ghc-9.7.20230119/rts-1.0.2/include Created temporary directory: /tmp/ghc24_0 In file included from /opt/ghc/_build/stage1/lib/../lib/js-ghcjs-ghc-9.7.20230119/rts-1.0.2/include/Rts.h:38, from foo.c:1:0: error: /opt/ghc/_build/stage1/lib/../lib/js-ghcjs-ghc-9.7.20230119/rts-1.0.2/include/Stg.h:400:10: error: fatal error: stg/DLL.h: No such file or directory 400 | #include "stg/DLL.h" | ^~~~~~~~~~~

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was just looking at something I'd written earlier in the week and noticed that org-mode had (somehow) changed a source code block I'd created from having the emojis I'd had in it (quite a few, which is how I noticed), to escaped numeric codes. I am unsure why this may have happened (and the fact is, I can add in the emojis but the file is a bit broke at the moment.
 Eg. 🐧 to \360\237\220\247 
 Is there any particular reason why this would have happened, and more to the point, is there a way to prevent it? (I should point out I'm on OSX and these were default emoji from Apple's font.). It's the first time I've seen it happen in files (though I recently changed my config which, for example, removed the Apple emoji front from being defaulted.). I'm on emacs 29.0.60. Latest version of org-mode and using org-roam.

To be honest, I'm finding it has only one advantage over ALE + Vim + the now defunct Intero – namely, it offers auto-completion – and has a number of drawbacks (no way to get a variable's type, that I can see, and requires an entire Node.js installation). Is there some killer feature of HLS that I'm missing?
 tbh, most of what I'd want out of HLS can already be got from ghci (using the :type-at and :loc-at commands), so I'm thinking of writing a small Vim plugin to hook ghci into Vim similar to what Intero did.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm using eglot for coding c++, which is lightweight and provides just enough functionalities for me (Glad it's integrated into emacs 29!)
 One thing I'm not 100% satisfied is the diagnostics when the cursor is hovering on a symbol. By default it shows the information in the echo area through eldoc, which is not quite convenient because usually it's far from where the cursor is. A better solution is provided by eldoc-box, which shows information in a child frame, like this.
 As can be seen in the screenshot, the child frame blocks some part of the window. I'm wondering if possible to set the child frame transparent so that I can see the code below. I tried to set eldoc-box-frame-parameters with (alpha . 0.5) but it has no effect. What do I miss?
 Moreover, the eglot shows the information with some formatting. There is a long line separating different kinds of information, which is fine for the echo area, but in the child frame, it is wrapped into several pieces, occupying additional lines. I'm curious if there is a way to change the format. 
 Another question which is related is that the documentation is truncated. I'd rather to see a long child frame to show all the information, which is usually possible if there is no redundant things like the wrapped line. I cannot find an option in eglot to turn off the truncation. Is there any solution for this problem?
 Thanks for reading this long post!

 Does anyone have a setup like this? I found this, but I'm wondering if there's a solution that works per fragment instead of per line (and isn't a "quick and dirty proof of concept", as the author describes it).
 Thanks!

 But according to my experience, on my mediocre desktop, it probably takes less than 10 minutes for native compilation. And I wonder if I'm doing it in a correct way. I run `./configure --with-native-compilation` then `make -j$(nproc)`. I also tried `make NATIVE_FULL_AOT=1 -j$(nproc)` per EmacsWiki. But the compilation time is always very well under 10 minutes. After compilation, the evaluation of (native-comp-available-p) returns t.
 Am I doing it correctly or am I missing something?

 Here TxGVNN/guxti is my Guix channel to maintain packages and patches.
 Pros
  
Patches are centrally stored, easy to see what is patch and don't need to fork any source to modify.
 Reproducible, I can roll back any point (time traveling).
 It will be easy to install package need external libs like vterm, telega(Telegram client), tree-sitter,...
 Build your ELPA by elpa-mirror power tool. I exported to my giaelpa TxGVNN/giaelpa@master, so it still works well for my dotfiles without GUIX
 Keep working with use-package style.
 With guix pack --format=deb I can install all of them (emacs version, packages, 3rd libs) on debian machine without GUIX
 When cloud IDEs are using more (Gitpod, Codespace), it helps me to a certain uniform environment. I implement on my Gitpod dotfiles, you can have a look TxGVNN/gitpod@701546
  
Cons
  
Heavy and slow, I think

I want it to be a vertically-displayed completing-read menu over some sources (recent files, recent buffers, bookmarks, etc.). I can write the completion command easily enough (and I already use vertico, so I would get the standard vertical display), but I want the completion candidates to fill the a whole window, a bit like vertico-buffer does. Importantly, I only want this to happen for this one thing -- the dashboard -- I don't just want to enable vertico-buffer generally. If I switch to another buffer and invoke a minibuffer command, it should show up at the bottom like usual.
 It would be really great if invoking any minibuffer-using command while in the dashboard buffer would reuse the dashboard buffer for completion, but that might be a separate issue.

 I have two ideas to install this package:
  
git clone to one of the load-paths and just use-package. cons: I need install the dependencies first.
 use straight.el (maybe? I just start to read its long readme).
  
Then I find there is a ejira/ejira-pkg.el file in the repo, is that the package definations? Can I use this file directly to install the ejira with all its dependencies automaticly?

 manager' <- newManager defaultManagerSettings res <- runClientM (<object> :: ClientM Type) (mkClientEnv manager' <url>) 
 where <object> is some big tree like structure which needs many requests to build. The problem is that the lichess API is rate limited (here they say: only one request at a time and wait for a minute after receiving 429). Is there a way to slow down servant-client (or http-client) so that they obey these restrictions?
 I haven't found anything in the docs of servant-client or http-client, and googling only gives result for the server side part. servant-rate-limit has a client module, but when you look at the code you see that it doesn't do anything. managerConnCount and managerIdleConnectionCount don't help either.

 ie instead of being (a b c d e) I accidentally made it ((a b) a b c d e) and the problem was easily fixed by (setq savehist-additional-variables (cdr savehist-additional-variables)). However this was only possible because the(a b)` was the head of the list.
 The functions delete|remove, delq | remq remove an element from the list, with the former using equal to compare and the latter eq to compare.

eq
  
Return t if the two args are the same Lisp object.
  
(delete '(a b) ((a b) a b c d e) works and (delq '(a b) ((a b) a b c d e)) doesn't.
 Why do eq and equal treat the (a b)/'(a b) comparison differently?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello! For some time I've been developing a package to integrate the TMSU file tagging system with Emacs and dired. While I find TMSU great, I didn't really like its UI, so I've turned Emacs into a subjectively better one.
 https://github.com/vifon/tmsu.el
 While not a full replacement for more intricate TMSU CLI use cases, tmsu.el handles all the regular workflows such as tagging, tag modification and tag based queries (with results in dired, similar to M-x find-dired).
 It was one of my goals to integrate tmsu.el with the Emacs ecosystem as well as possible:
  
tag editing uses the standard completing-read-multiple (or any frontend to it, such as vertico)
 most dired features are usable in the query results
 the queries can be saved both with the Emacs-native bookmarks (C-x r m) and the org-mode links (M-x org-store-link)
  
Here is a screenshot of an example query made with M-x tmsu-dired-query:
 https://preview.redd.it/m3frsus24fda1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=1bbe0270074bf8186bb416fb86c6529d3ba4d866
 tmsu.el was usable for quite a while, but only recently I've published it as a separate project (previously it was just living in my ~/.emacs.d/) and consider its feature set relatively complete and stable. Hopefully someone else will find it as useful as I do!
 Any further input is very appreciated.

 In this post I’ll describe how to write a minimalistic Haskell persistence layer (on top of HDBC). My approach will rely heavily on Generics (Data.Data, Data.Typeable) and Reflection (Type.Reflection).
 The overall design goal is to avoid any boilerplate code for the API user.
 The library is by no means complete. Right now it’s just a proof of concept. But it shows that it is possible to use Generics to eliminate a lot of handwritten code for API users.
 I’m explicitely asking for your feedback here:
  
Do you regard such a persistence library as useful?
 Do you have any suggestions for improvements?
 Which feature would you like to see most urgently?
 Do you think it makes sense to extend this proof of concept to a full fledged solution, or are there already enough libraries out there that do the same?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I see that a lot of people have moved into org mode, and say org mode is amazing as task management solution. So I've been convinced org mode is the ideal task management tool for geek.
 Then I discover that org mode miss some essential basic feature for task management. For instance, I estimated the effort for a project. After finishing some tasks, I try to track the remaining effort to complete the project. I discover that there is no straightforward solution to do that in org column view, org column view can only display estimated effort. I should write a custom function for this basic and essential feature of task management. No built-in solution or elisp package exists for that. Only a advanced emacs user (who masters elisp) can do this basic and essential action. I suppose probably that it exists maybe other basic and essential feature aren't implemented in org mode.
 That make me to doubt when so many people says org mode is a amazing task management tool. Did they used really org mode in production for task management? I can't understand how people can survive in task management without such feature.
 Org mode is maybe a good platform to build a task management tool, but it isn't a mature task management tool.
 Fortunately,org can export to taskjuggler, I intent to explore the taskjuggler solution.

 tags "TODO=\"TODO\"+SCHEDULED<=\"<today>\"+PRIORITY=\"A\""
 Is bringing up Todos with priority A, but also those with no priority. I can filter those no priority ones out with an org-agenda-skip-entry-if command (notregexp to drop anything that’s not explicitly [#A]) but that seems like it should be unnecessary.
 And then, I can’t figure out how to show anything due today/overdue with no priority in a separate search. What’s the best command for that?
 Any thoughts for me?
 —-SORT OF SOLVED—-
 I set the default priority to “D” (which is not one of the priorities I cycle through) and set up a search for that priority. Not sure if that’s the orthodox solution, but it works.

 Also see the countdown package.
 I left some notes in the Elisp so you can figure out where to customize further.
 I'm also working on another "game" package that is similar to snow, but we will see if it's time time for this Lunar New Year or has to wait until next NYE.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am a mathematics graduate student who has been dabbling with Emacs for a little under a year, on and off. I have the following use case, and I've felt a little overwhelmed at the possible choices of packages, so I'd like some advice on how to set up something that works for me.
 In my studies I often find myself encountering problems and ideas that I had thought about a long time ago, but can no longer reconstruct. What I'd like to create is a system where I can dash off my summary of a theorem or proof technique that I encounter, and be able to link these documents to each other. More specifically, I'd like to have a big folder filled with LaTeX files (or org files) that are tagged somehow so I don't have to keep track of them myself. I want to be able to refer to specific theorems/definitions/equations in other files in the system, as I would in LaTeX. And, importantly, I want to be able to produce a nicely formatted PDF from a selection of these files, with all the internal links to equations, definitions etc. working properly. So for example if this semester I'm studying harmonic analysis, I want to produce notes on all the theorems and techniques I pick up, and by the end I should be able to stitch them together in a PDF. If next semester something I'm studying relies on one of those theorems, I want to still be able to point to the corresponding file and again include it in a different PDF. A nice plus would be the ability to smoothly manage citations and references to books, papers etc.
 There are packages in the so-called personal knowledge management ecosystem (org-roam, deft, org-brain, Zetteldeft etc.) that seem to do what I'm looking for. I'd appreciate anyone who's tried out a bunch of them giving their opinion on what makes the most sense to do. If anyone's done something similar, any advice, links or helpful blog posts describing your setup would be very appreciated.

 Since it's really easy to export your agenda to a file, what conky is doing now is just reading the file where I export my default agenda view of the week. But I've encountered a few problems:
  
I would like to make the days of the week different colored, but since conky is just reading the file it's not possible (at least I couldn't do it, please tell me I'm wrong)
 The TODO and priority levels are really annoying (this is easier to deal with, but still)
 I have multiple files for different tasks. While I do want all the tasks to be listed and, when I'm on agenda view, from which file they come from, again, is really annoying on conky
  
Have any of you guys dealt with this before? How would you implement that?

 When running as a script I used (file-name-directory load-file-name), but that is nil when running the file with eval-buffer etc.. So for those cases I use the default-directory variable. This is my current solution:
  (defun my/get-script-directory () (if (null load-file-name) (expand-file-name default-directory) (file-name-directory load-file-name)) 
 My main concern is that default-directory does not always point to the same directory that the file is in since it can be changed with cd. 
 Thanks in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi folks, been using emacs and Org Mode for a few years now. global-auto-revert-mode used to work fine -- if I changed a file remotely, the emacs process would pick it up and revert that file's buffer.
 Around 6 months or so ago it became only 'intermittently' working... maybe 1 out of 5 or 10 times, it will notice the file has changed and revert the buffer. Most of the time (almost always) it doesn't. I find myself now doing 'C-x x g' to revert by hand, before I start modifying my Org agenda, otherwise I'll have a conflict when I try to save.
 I have this in my .emacs:
 '(global-auto-revert-mode t)
 I have also tried it with '1' instead of 't' but made no difference.
 My setup is:
 - Fedora 37 as a Virtualbox VM (running under a Windows 10 host)
 - emacs version 28.2
 - file in question is being synchronized via Syncthing (the remote device is an Android phone, as my main use case is Orgzly)
 I've done some searching but haven't found an answer for this scenario so far. Can anyone give some pointers on what else I might look for, or any means of directly troubleshooting this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Macbook air with G9 second monitor, and opening emacs onto the center of the big monitor:
 (setq default-frame-alist '((top + -334) (left + -3769) (width . 230) (height . 75))) (set-frame-size (selected-frame) 230 75) 
 The result is it pops from the laptop to the main monitor, but the height is clipped to the height of the laptop. And the minibuffer and modeline are gone/hidden, like the bottom of the frame is truly clipped. Any meaningful interaction in this state, like expanding an org headline, results in a crash/core dump.
 I need to drag the bottom a bit with the mouse to snap emacs out of it and get the minibuffer back and leave the crash-ready state.
 Executing the set-frame works fine when the frame is already on the second monitor, but i can recreate the same issue by moving the window to the laptop and executing the size and then dragging the window back.
 Anyone experience this? Ideas for a fix? Thankyou for any info.

 There are a lot of articles or tips to beautify org-mode on emacs, but not much on markdown. Maybe other users are like me, so I share a tip to beautify markdown titles in emacs (Doom emacs actually):

 I would like to tell helm~ag to ignore showing files that have the extension ".org_archive", and probably later also ".html".
 Based off the sample configuration on the github readme...
 (custom-set-variables '(helm-ag-base-command "ag --nocolor --nogroup --ignore-case") '(helm-ag-command-option "--all-text") '(helm-ag-insert-at-point 'symbol) '(helm-ag-ignore-buffer-patterns '("\\.txt\\'" "\\.mkd\\'"))) 
 ... I figured that that would require me to add the following to my emacs init.el file:
 (custom-set-variables '(helm-ag-ignore-buffer-patterns '("\\.org_archive\\'" "\\.html\\'")) '(helm-ag-ignore-patterns '("\\.org_archive\\'" "\\.html\\'")) ) 
 I probably don't need both. However this doesn't seem to be true. I.E. it doesn't exclude those files, although I do see my customisations via customize-group.
 Can someone please tell me what I'm failing to understand?
 Thank you.

 I sometimes accidentally create new captures with wrong inputs by mistake or choose the wrong template. I then try to abort the capture process (C-c C-k or org-capture-kill). Unfortunately, this still creates an empty file for that capture and performs a find-file on it. 
 I added :no-save t to my templates (inspired by this thread), but this makes aborted captures' buffers to stay open. Adding :kill-buffer t somehow causes org-capture to write the file to disk on abort (ignoring :no-save t). 
 Is there a way to not create an empty file and to close the capture buffer when aborting an org-capture process?

 I'm looking for a Scala counterpart to Haskell's constructor sequential application, and it's surprisingly difficult to find a documentation page where this topic would be covered. Basically, I'm looking for a way to achieve this in Scala:
 ```haskell data Object = Object Int String deriving Show
 main = print object where object = Object <$> Just 1 <*> Just "one" ```
 If it isn't supported by the core language, I'd appreciate links to libraries implementing this functionality via FP primitives.

Since I employ Evil for everything, could I change to a <Leader>? based config to reduce stress on the finger joints. Ergonomics is very important to me. 
 I saw many plugins promising it, but I wondered what the right way of implementing this is.

 Or... it will show that I am weird for using some ancient editor and it's going to be too hard to blend me in a team of other developers using vscode and stuff.

 First of all: I want to say thanks for that whole thread, I really enjoyed reading some of the feedback. There were some recurring questions and comments there, so I decided it best for me to address them all in one place.
 There I was also visually adviced to write an elevator pitch to quickly explain the central point (thanks, u/tonicinhibition). You can read that here now: Project Mage: The Elevator Pitch.
 And if you want a more detailed discussion and motivation for structural editing, there's the Rune section here: The Power of Structure/Rune.

 Does M-x org-roam-capture-templates RET support to have a key to create directories?
 It would be good to have something like M-x org-roam-node-find RET p RET active RET paper RET, where p corresponds to some template and a projects directory.
 Now there is another problem, when one does
 mv projects/active/paper.org projects/done/paper.org 
 org-roam-node-find would not find paper.org. Edit: nevermind, had to org-roam-db-clear-all and org-roam-db-sync.
 TLDR how to have an org-roam-template choice with a recursive directory/filename choice? Found out, that I can move files in my org-roam-directory.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I was using neovim - but had some issues related to indentation that I couldn't fix, and the community also seemed to agree that it was a known issue, and so I moved to using doom emacs.
 ​
 So I moved to doom emacs - tested the indentation, and it was flawless, exactly how I wanted it to perform.
 ​
 What I want, which was working:
 - If I open a block, auto indent ready for typing based on where the block currently is
 - If I delete all indentation in front of a line, and hit tab, autoindent that line to it's correct indent level
 - If I have a line indented correctly, and hit backspace at the beginning of that line, remove 1 indentation (even if this would be incorrect to what is expected)
 - If I have a line indented correctly, and I tab at the beginning of the line, indent that line once (even if this would be incorrectly indented)
 ​
 This is pretty much exactly how VSCode handles indentation for PHP, it's very practical and flexible.
 ​
 I want to know how I can get back to this, because today after opening my emacs, if I hit tab, the editor will just check if the line is correctly indented, and fix it as per it's own opinion. 
 I do not want this aggressive style of controlling indentation, because it is not at all practical of what I actually need from emacs
 ​
 For context - I work on an eCommerce site, the entire project is 7 million lines of code, and not one single file has been well mantained - some of the files are 30 thousand lines long.
 ​
 Of course - one option would be to try and indent the entire file, but then I can't get my PRs approved on GitHub.
 ​
 Accepting the aggressive indentation is not an option for me, I need to be able to have flexible control over it.
 ​
 Can anyone suggest ideas for this?
 ​
 Currently, C-h k is set to c-indent-line-or-region

 many Emacs users don't use eshell very much.
 Many users of other shells, are not familiar with eshell's features and capabilities.
 On a Slovak Linux site a while ago I published an article about eshell, aimed at a wider audience who don't use Emacs, and I mentioned some of the features that make it interesting and attractive.
 Maybe it makes sense for English-speaking users (of PC, Linux), so I made a translation of it (note: English is not my native language, so please forgive mistakes and awkward expressions).
 (BTW: I use eshell as a daily tool and I can't imagine going back to another shell. )

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm evaluating scala3 for the type of applications I do (business logic in logistics, e-commerce) and I'm looking to scratch an itch I've been having with other languages and their ecosystems.
 First some definitions
  
a clean domain model is a package/module/layer which does not depend on anything but the language and itself
 no external libraries, in-line annotations (eg javadoc) or off-line annotations (eg xml) are allowed in the domain model
 the domain model can provide contracts that other models/modules can implement in order to pass data into the domain model; data can also be injected by constructing model entities outside of the model and passing them as parameters to the model
  
With all this in mind, I landed at the first candidate: slick from https://scala-slick.org/ that you all probably know.
 Given my requirements, I have an issue with the example on their front page
  class Coffees(tag: Tag) extends Table[Coffee](tag, "COFFEES") { 
 because their abstraction requires me to pass into the model an abstraction specific to the library (a table), but I need to pass into the model the Coffee type defined above (supposedly defined in the domain model).
 Basically the extends gets in the way. I would envision my requirement being met if the slick abstractions would be mixins, and my class StorableCoffee would extend Coffee and mix into itself the storage features from slick.
 Then I would be able to pass into the domain model StorableCoffee, but to the model that would just be a Coffee.
 So since I've never coded in scala, my questions are:
  
is it possible to achieve my goal without convoluted scala3 artifacts and slick or another library?
 if not, what are the possible hacks I could employ?

 I have this class
 type DbQuery = Text

 getConfig :: m DbConfig
 My aim was with it to read data from db use the readDb method and return with any type.
 I would like to determine the exact type where I create the instance of that class.
 the implementation:
 data DbRow = DbRow Int Text deriving (Show)
 instance FromRow DbRow where
 fromRow = DbRow <$> field <*> field
 instance Db IO where
 readDb queryStr = do
 sqlitePath <- dbPath <$> getConfig
 conn <- open sqlitePath

 close conn
 return res
 I got this error:
 typecheck [-Wdeferred-type-errors]: • Couldn't match type ‘a’ with ‘DbRow’
 Expected: IO [a]
 Actual: IO [DbRow]
 ‘a’ is a rigid type variable bound by
 the type signature for:

 Please clarify what I dont' understand and why the DbRow is not Any type ...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello community,
 Of late, I do not know why, but the hard disk space on my Windows machine is close to being fully utilized. I notice that there are multiple apps that seem to be updating by default -- such as Acrobat reader, McAfee Software, Browser Updates, etc. 
 I am considering emacs and was wondering if emacs has this issue at all? I believe that there is a pdf reader built in, web browser built in, etc.
 So, hypothetically, if one were to install emacs, what other Windows applications can be removed -- Acrobat reader. Chrome / Microsoft Edge browser, etc.?
 What Windows applications are hard to replicate in emacs? Can people here tell me which Windows applications you still have to use after installing emacs?
 Thank you.

 Is it just me or are the official Emacs docs not at all instructive? Ex: Child Frames. After reading that doc, I still don't have the slightest idea how to create a child frame in elisp. I know all of the odd corner cases that might happen when trying though!
 Perhaps someone has a suggestion as to another resource which leans more heavily code and less heavily "All The Corner Cases!"

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It takes me about 20-30 minutes to create 1 Zettel sometimes because my linking process often involves sifting through my Slipbox to find the right note to place my note behind. As my Slipbox grows, it becomes cumbersome to keep this up.
I see plenty of posts share abstract advice for linking Zettels together and implementing Folgezettel.
Each link should create knowledge
Create a new Zettel when you're starting to branch into a second idea
"Find" Zettels that match your topic (but don't you dare use the Search function to do it!)
You need Folgezettel / you don't need Folgezettel (I personally like the structure, so I've chosen to keep it)
What I'd like to learn from experienced users is this: What are the PHYSICAL steps you take when you've completed a Zettel and you're linking it to your other Zettels?
By physical steps, I mean what you actually do, GTD-style Next Actions.
For instance, here's my physical action steps.
Search my index for the topic of interest
Look within that cluster to find a Zettel that's either a source of that idea or similar to that idea.
Number the new Zettel after the one I chose from #2.
Use the Obsidian search function for a few keywords within my Zettel to find relevant links, adding context phrases as I do so.
But the problem is that as my Slipbox grows, I'll slowly forget the Zettel clusters and may make less-than-ideal connections. Any guidance here would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!]]></summary>

Scholar and historian S.D. Goitein built and maintained a significant collection of over 27,000 notes in the form of a card index (or zettelkasten1) which he used to fuel his research and academic writing output in the mid to late twentieth century. The collection was arranged broadly by topical categories and followed in the commonplace book tradition though it was maintained on index cards. Uncommon to the space, his card index file was used by subsequent scholars for their own research and was ultimately digitized by the Princeton Geniza Project.
Introduction to S.D. Goitein and his work

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[NOTE: Please ignore the title. It is plain wrong
 I'm experimenting with defvar's and realized that because it is a special function the symbol parameter can't be computed.
 So I'm trying something like this in the scratch buffer:
  (defun that () "newvalue") `(defvar ,(make-symbol (that)) 10 "a docstring") 
 evaluation the second line results in
 (defvar newvalue 10 "anothername") 
 which I want to execute directly.
 What command should I wrap around the defvar to execute it directly?
 I'm also looking the eval function which seems to be the way to execute valid elisp like the generated defvar above after it has been converted to a string.
 Can the same thing be done in an eval way?
 PS. After scratching my head a bit and remembering a few things such print being what you had to do to read stuff and chancing across some old stuff this is what I have come up with.
 (defun my/eval-string (string) "Eval elisp code of STRING." (eval (car (read-from-string (format "(progn %s)" string))))) (my/eval-string (prin1-to-string `(defvar ,(make-symbol (that)) 10 "another name"))) 
 It works fine but isn't there a simpler way? This seems convoluted.
 It must be possible to execute the expansion of `(defvar ,(make-symbol (that)) 10 "another name") without converting it to string prefixed with progn, reading it and executing it again.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Here is my org-mode file foo.org:
 | Category | Points | |-----------+--------| | Minecraft | 13 | | Tetris | 6 | | Bricks | 1 | |-----------+--------| | | 20 | #+TBLFM: @>$2=vsum(@I..@II) | Game | No | |--------+----| | Mario | 1 | | Pacman | 1 | | Zork | 1 | |--------+----| | | 3 | #+TBLFM: @>$2=vcount(@I..@II) 
 I place the point somewhere inside the 1st table and press C-c *. Nothing happens. This is good.
 Then I place the point somewhere inside the 2nd table and press C-c *. It gets misaligned like this:
 | Category | Points | |-----------+--------| | Minecraft | 13 | | Tetris | 6 | | Bricks | 1 | |-----------+--------| | | 20 | #+TBLFM: @>$2=vsum(@I..@II) | Game | No | |--------+----| | Mario | 1 | | Pacman | 1 | | Zork | 1 | |--------+----| | | 3 | #+TBLFM: @>$2=vcount(@I..@II) 
 It looks like it mistakenly took a column width of 8 for the last row, 2nd column. I suspect that this column width of 8 has been mistakenly taken from the column width of the 2nd column of the first table which is also 8.
 Following my suspicion I try a different experiment now. I press TAB on the 2nd table to realign. Then I place point somewhere in the 1st table and type C-c * and now the 1st table gets misaligned like so:
 | Category | Points | |-----------+--------| | Minecraft | 13 | | Tetris | 6 | | Bricks | 1 | |-----------+--------| | | 20 | #+TBLFM: @>$2=vsum(@I..@II) | Game | No | |--------+----| | Mario | 1 | | Pacman | 1 | | Zork | 1 | |--------+----| | | 3 | #+TBLFM: @>$2=vcount(@I..@II) 
 You see it has incorrectly set the column width of last row, 2nd column to 4 which is also the column width of 2nd column of 1st table.
 Is this expected behavior? Or is this a bug? Any workarounds to prevent this kind of misalignment from happening?

 #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp (defun make-list () (list (list 10 20) (list 30 40) (list 50 60))) (make-list) #+END_SRC #+RESULTS: | 10 | 20 | | 30 | 40 | | 50 | 60 | * Some section Some text in this section 
 In the example above make-list produces a static list but in my actual org-mode file this function creates a dynamic list based on current date and other current data.
 I want to set up my org file such that whenever I visit this file, it executes (make-list). How can I do it?
 I read about #+STARTUP: but it does not support executing arbitrary elisp code. So how can I modify my org file such that it always runs (make-list) on startup.

 Recently I've created a simple guitar fretboard cheatsheet for Emacs. I don't know how many guitar beginners we have in the Emacs community, but maybe someone will find it useful. See the screenshot on Github to get the idea of what it does.
 Currently it depends on symbol-overlay.el for simplicity, but this dependency probably will be replaced with calls to highlight-regexp.
 Don't hesitate to say what additional functionality would make sense, assuming it wouldn't be too difficult to add.

 import Data.Aeson import Data.ByteString.Lazy (ByteString) encode :: ToJSON a => a -> ByteString 
 I read many articles specifying that lazy Text and lazy ByteString are not to be used or should be used in very few specific situations. So, what advantage does it bring for aeson to use lazy version?
 Also, as far as I know ByteString is binary data, so when aeson encodes the some record to a JSON string, how does it know that it should use UTF-8 instead of something else? Is it the default behavior? Is there some way I can specify the character encoding behavior when using aeson for decoding and encoding a record?

Maybe the idea is not well formulated. So I rewrote the post to better explain my idea.
 Core idea
 In org, The TODO keyword expresses an expectation (we want realize something); when it changes to DONE, the expectation is met. But the org mode does not have the concept of whether we have enough resources to achieve the expectation and how to consistently allocate them. In tasks management, I think budgeting a project, and analyzing its feasibility and cost, task allocation is essential.

This combined with the side window on the right (mostly taken from Rougier's task agenda) makes for a rather nice setup, I believe.

 on two of my systems simply starting emacs seens to have resulted in packages being updated and that resulted in in the "Invalid function: org-assert-version`, my installation is currently broken.
 The workaround seems to be to start emacs with -Q and reinstall org but I don't know how to do that.
 I have tried (with emacs -Q) to configure the melpa-client but when I then try to run (package-install 'org) it simply says "org is already installed".
 How to proceed?
 Many thanks!

 I'm a university student, and am out and about more than I am home, lately, and at times, when I want to play with an idea, or practice some concepts, I typically have to wait until I'm home to open up a project specifically for that purpose.
 I've looked around, but haven't found anything regarding whether or not it is possible to use codespaces for Haskell. 
 Does anyone know whether it is possible? Additionally, does anyone have a repo I can clone for this purpose, or a resource to explain the setup?
 Thanks, all!
 Edit: my main issue is that I require ghcup, and the extension in vscode doesn't work like it normally would out if the box.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[i’m apart of a pretty massive staff augmentation program for a Fortune 100 company, and we have so many w2 development long term contract positions (all with this company, over 200+). Many are hybrid all across the US (2-3 days) or 100% remote and multi-year. we often get Scala requests across the US, and we struggle to find these folks on job boards. if you or anyone recently laid off is looking (in really any dev tech as long they have 1-2 yrs hands on), please send a pm. 
 Rates - from $45/hr w2( VERY junior) up to $100/hr w2 depending on the seniority level of the role. 
 The projects are cool, a lot of one and done interviews, but so many fraudulent candidates out there its hard to find the folks actually in need of work right now online. 
 if not allowed, my bad!

that begets composable software which can be reasoned about and avails

Haskell, OCaml and Rust. However, it would be remiss of us to snub
languages that don’t enforce the same disciplines, but are nonetheless
popular choices in industry. Ivory towers are lonely places, after all.
Last time I wrote about how Python’s1 type system

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm working on a CLAP audio plugin host for Haskell and running into issues when trying to use the C FFI on Windows. The same code works on Linux, so I'm assuming this is a longstanding Windows issue given all the warnings I've seen about using Haskell on Windows. And the same thing happens on every GHC version I've tried (8.8.4, 8.10.7, 9.2.5, and 9.4.4).
 The error message is `Access violation in generated code when executing data at 0x7ffd3aa06366` with a stack trace that points to an invocation of a method inside a struct field. The weird thing is that if I call the same method in the same Haskell function that the struct is created, it works fine. Which makes it sound like the struct got destroyed or relocated in memory. But if I print the C struct's address and the address of all of its method field, they're exactly the same as when it was created.
 My first thought was that the garbage collector had freed up its space, but that shouldn't be possible since there is a persistent reference to the struct stored in an `IORef`. And using `StablePtr` didn't have any impact.
 Anyone run into something like this before, or have better ideas how to debug it? And if not, where would be a better place to report this issue?

 I would like to understand something about elisp that I have now struggled with for days and simpy cannot figure out - so I hope for some wizzard here...
 This is part of my configuration (it' about replacing the language-names of source-blocks with svgs - but that is not what this posting is about):
 (setq svg-tag-tags '( ("#\\+BEGIN_SRC \\(elisp\\)" . ((lambda (tag) (svg-tag-make tag :inverse t :radius 12)))) ("#\\+BEGIN_SRC \\(perl\\)" . ((lambda (tag) (svg-tag-make tag :inverse t :radius 12)))) ) ) 
 As you can see the lambda expression for the languages is exactly the same in both cases, so I wondered if it was possible to factor that out and try something like this:

  (fset #'mh/myl (lambda (tag) (svg-tag-make tag :inverse t :radius 12)) (setq svg-tag-tags '( ("#\\+BEGIN_SRC \\(elisp\\)" . ((lambda (tag) (svg-tag-make tag :inverse t :radius 12)))) ("#\\+BEGIN_SRC \\(perl\\)" . ((lambda (tag) (svg-tag-make tag :inverse t :radius 12)))) ("#\\+BEGIN_SRC \\(python\\)" . (#'mh/myl) ) ) 
 So the idea is to store the lambda in the function-slot of a symbol and then use that symbol instead of the lambda but for reasons that are beyond me it does not work. (If it worked for python you would of course use this approach for all the other languages as well and then would only need to update one place should you ever want to change the appearence of the svgs).
 I have tried every conceivable permutation of quoting (or not quoting), of sprinkling in some call to symbol-function etc but I cannot make it work. Some variations compile fine but in the end none of them work.
 And I wonder: Why does this not work? What is it that I do not understand about symbols and lambdas?
 And what would be the proper way to do that (provided it is possible at all)?
 Many thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Google Summer of Code is a long-running program by Google that supports Open Source projects. Haskell has taken part in this program almost since it's inception!
 It allows everyone (since 2022, before that it was only students) to contribute to projects for a stipend. However, in order to do that, we need to have some ideas of what to contribute to.
 In the past, this has led to many improvements for GHC, Cabal, HLS, Hasktorch... and it can include your project as well! This is a great way to find contributors for your project (even after the summer ends) -- many past participants have become involved long-term.
 You can find more info and instructions on how to participate here: https://summer.haskell.org/ideas.html.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, after working through "Haskell from First Principles", I felt confident enough to try writing a BF interpreter. I could implement most instructions, namely: 
 ``` < decrease memory pointer
 > increase memory pointer
 + increase cell value currently pointed at
 - decrease cell value currently pointed at
 , get char and write value to cell currently pointed at
 . print char from cell currently pointed at ```
 without problem, but when trying to implement the loops I got stuck, more specifically, when handling nested loops and the accumulated instructions (one-layer loops are executed correctly at the moment). 
 Basically what I did is the following (sorry if it is too much, thank you for reading this post):

 In node, we have "memoryjs" (https://www.npmjs.com/package/memoryjs) for example that does that rather easily (drop a package.json with one dependecy, and you are up and running !).
 Is there any librabry available that can do that in Scala (I've juste spent one hour searching on the net without success ...) ? Thanks ! :)

I am now interested in porting over some of my deep learning models from PyTorch. For this to work, I would want automatic differentiation and GPU execution. I've peeked at Hasktorch and the Tensorflow Haskell bindings, but I'm really interested in the slick interface of the backprop package. I'm not sure if it's a viable path given the repo has posted issues regarding GHC 9.0 and accelerate compatibility. Does anyone have recent experience with backprop and accelerate? Are there alternative recommendations for automatic differentiation?

My implementation following the other examples in the book:
 data Either e r = Left e | Right r instance Functor (Either e) where -- fmap :: (a -> b) -> f a -> f b fmap _ (Left x) = Left x fmap f (Right x) = Right (f x) instance Applicative (Either e) where -- pure :: a -> f a pure = Right -- (<*>) :: f (a -> b) -> f a -> f b Right f <*> Right x = Right (f x) _ <*> Left x = Left x instance Monad (Either e) where -- return :: a -> m a return = pure -- (>>=) :: m a -> (a -> m b) -> m b Right x >>= f = f x Left x >>= _ = Left x

But I find it really hard to avoid the increasing right indentation without making the code hard to understand because of runExceptT and the likes everywhere. To give you a bit more info before clicking the repository link: in the actual app, m would be the application monad (think ReaderT pattern), and so you might often see m (Maybe String) or m (Either String) being returned. It's then hard to compose two functions like that. I'm aware that you can do MonadPlus m and MonadError String m but I can't get this to work while still preserving the error messages depending on where I got a Nothing value.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I noticed on this post mention of Meta decommissioning Sigma, their spam fighting tool, which is written in Haskell.
 If true, this news is very bad, since it's an example of a major corporation we can no longer point to and say, 'See! Haskell is used in industry!' And it's quite likely I'll have to write more weakly typed PHP and JS code, as a result as clients will refuse to take Haskell seriously.
 So does anyone know if this is true? Does anyone have any links?
 Apologies for making a new post about this, I didn't get to comment on the other one in a timely manner.

 Until now, the Tour of Scala repo has always been open source (https://github.com/leobenkel/tour-of-scala) but only regarding the design. The articles were hosted on my own website and just displayed differently on Tour of Scala but not editable by anyone.
 As of today, all the content is also open source!
 💻 Every exercises can be edited by opening a PR on those files (https://github.com/leobenkel/tour-of-scala/tree/main/pages/scala)
 I am looking forward to seeing everyone involved in this community fixing minor mistakes that I could have let slip in, adding more content, adding exercises for Scala 3, for ZIO, and more challenges, and adding new features! 🎉
 As a reminder, the Tour of Scala website: https://tourofscala.com

 I'm happy to announce the second part of a five part tutorial on property-based testing stateful systems in general, and distributed systems in particular:
 https://github.com/stevana/property-based-testing-stateful-systems-tutorial/blob/main/docs/Part02ConcurrentSMTesting.md#readme
 In the previous part we introduced state machine testing building only upon QuickCheck.
 In this part we will build upon the first part and add concurrent state machine testing support and linearisability checking (same technique as used by Erlang's closed source quickcheck eqc and Jepsen.
 I hope to announce part three on integration and contract testing next week.
 Any questions, comments or suggestions are most welcome!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Xeft is a note searcher like Deft, with less features but much faster, especially for larger note collections. It uses a dynamic module to index your notes and provide search results.
 It has been around for a while now. I initially planned to extend Deft to use the dynamic module as a backend and keep Xeft to myself, but it turns out there are too many Deft features that I can't make to work with the dynamic module backend. I still think this is really cool and want to share it, so I made Xeft publicly available on ELPA.
 In particular, I think it'll work pretty well with Denote.
 I hope someone will find the dynamic module useful and come up with cool use cases for it beyond Xeft.
 Xeft: https://git.sr.ht/~casouri/xeft
 Dynamic module: https://git.sr.ht/~casouri/xapian-lite
 ​
 A demo
 Q: Why not org-roam/rg/etc?
 A: Because they don't fit my bill. If you use Deft but it lags, try Xeft, otherwise stick with what works for you.

 haskell instance Functor (Flip x) where fmap g s = case s of Flip (Left a) -> Flip (Left (g a)) Flip (Right x) -> Flip (Right x) 
 This is from A Type of Programming, and I know that this is only a stepping stone to introducing bimap and Bifunctor to achieve the same thing, but just can't wrap my head around it.
 I know that Flip has kind *->*->*, just as Either, but I also don't get how the flipping actually happens. Also, how do we even get that kind signature from this definition?
 haskell data Flip b a = Flip (Either a b) 
 I get that the type variables are flipped so should I simply imagine that (Right 7) :: (Either a Int) can be perceived as
  (something not chosen |) Right 7 
 and Flip (Right 7) :: (Flip Int a) as
  Right 7 (| something not chosen)  ?
 Probably overthinking this whole lot...

 I have learned to create svg programmatically in emacs and when you do that you get some sort of data-structure that represents the xml that a svg is made of and one can feed that into svg-tag-mode, fine.
 But what I cannot figure out is how to read an existing svg-file into an elisp-variable: I mean not as the raw xml-content but the parsed data-structure that is used to represent it.
 Is that possible? Does anybody know how? 
 I can't find any docs or examples...
 Many thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I am trying to get svg-tag-mode to use a previously created svg and can neither make sense of the documentation nor find example code anywhere...
 The documentation says:
 You need first to set svg-tag-tags that is a list of item here each item has the form (KEYWORD (TAG COMMAND HELP)) where: .... TAG is either a SVG image that will be displayed using the 'display property or a function that accepts a unique string argument (match-string 1) and returns an SVG image. 
 The second part about the function in TAG is clear and that is what all of the examples use.
 But what does " a SVG image that will be displayed using the 'display property" mean?
 Assuming mysvg is a variable holding an svg I would have guessed that it should be one of this variants but none work:
 (setq svg-tag-tags '( ("PATTERN1" . ((lambda (tag) (mysvg)))) ("PATTERN2" . ('display mysvg)) ("PATTERN3" . mysvg) ) ) 
 Here is the code for mysvg:
  (setq mysvg (svg-create 80 80 :stroke-width 5)) (svg-circle mysvg 40 40 25 :stroke-color "red") 
 So how is that supposed to work - does anybody understand this?
 Many thanks!

 Now, there's another thing I would like to do. As a masters student, it's important to always check a lot of websites from the government and research institutions to look for opportunities. There might be some useful notice about a financial support, or a important upcoming event etc. Looking for these, I have to manually check at least a couple dozen websites weekly, and I'm getting tired of doing all this work manually. It usually goes like this: copy a link from a list, paste into the browser, leading to a news page from some research institution, check if there's a new entry, go to the next link...
 Does anyone have a cool idea of how this could be done more easily? I thought about RSS feeds, but a lot of the websites don't have them. Also thought about doing some scripting with EWW, in a way that it goes jumping around a given list of websites so that at least I can speed up all the checking. It would also be really cool if there's a way to check if a given link has changed overtime, maybe by downloading the html's to a temp directory and comparing the files?
 Either way, it's something that would be really useful for years and years to come. Does anyone have a suggestion?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 many modes (let's take rainbow-mode as an example) can be toggeled by calling the function that turned it on again. So in M-x I can toggle rainbow by calling (rainbow-mode) again and again.
 Now let's say I want to do that via a keybinding.
 I have this function in my config:
 (defun mh/toggle () (interactive) (message "here") (rainbow-mode) ) 
 And have bound this function to a key. When I press the key I can see the message written - so it gets called, however the rainbow-mode is not toggeled. 
 I have also tried to run (rainbow-mode nil) to turn it off from the function but that does not work either. I have also tried some construction with "with-current-buffer", all to no avail...
 So why is that? What is the proper way to do such manipulations from a function?
 Please note that this is not about rainbow-mode as such (I just use it as an example) but it's about functions in elisp.
 Many thanks!

Kindelia, which was a currency-less p2p computer based on HVM that I never officially announced, has been paused to let me focus on HVM and Kind, but will be resumed in the future.
 I'm so positive and enthusiastic about the future of HVM that I believe it must have a much bigger team to thrive.

 Other videos and books I've been reading discuss FP fundamentals which are distinctly different than OOP practices and it would be helpful to see how "effects free" and "invariable data" would best be incorporated into that list of Best Practices.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm happy to announce the release of Kele 0.2.0. Changelog is viewable here.
 This release's marquee feature is kele-get, Kele's answer to kubectl get. With kele-get you can interactively specify the kind and name of the resource that you'd like to get and display its manifest in a separate buffer. What's more, it supports custom resources right out the gate -- a long-standing functionality gap in kubernetes-el (for which I'm a co-maintainer so pardon the candor).
 GIF time!
 See How-Tos > Usage > Working with Resources in the Kele documentation for more details. It's very much an MVP so there are some rough edges. Please open an issue for any peculiar behavior that you notice, or feel free to start a discussion if you wanna chat or throw ideas around.

 I have one of the following stanzas in my config:
 (use-package rainbow-mode :ensure t :hook org-mode) (use-package rainbow-mode :ensure t :hook (org-mode)) (use-package rainbow-mode :ensure t :hook (org-mode . rainbow-mode)) 
 As far as I understand the documentation they should all be equivalent and should turn rainbow-mode on in org. 
 But they don't. None of these versions work at the moment. No error, just no rainbow-mode (I can turn it on manually without problem).
 But here is my problem: They did work yesterday. 
 I have not changed anything about rainbow-mode but I must have changed something else that seems to have a side effect.
 This is driving me crazy now, I don't care about rainbow mode at all - all I want is to understand what is going on here...
 I am new to emacs and have no clue on how to attack this - does anyone have an idea?
 My config is an org-file that gets tangled when it's written but this mechanism seems to work ok, the generated el-file is in sync with the org...
 I would be grateful for every tip.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am trying to understand WAI and warp web server. I am going through this video by Michael Snoyman where he explains the problem.
 Initially, he presents the core data types here in the video. The Application type should be:
 type Application = Request -> IO Response 
 This feels intuitive but it is not especially when it streaming of the data using lazy bytes as explained here in the same video. And, then it concludes that the Application type is actually of:
 type Application = Request -> (Response -> IO ResponseReceived) -> IO ResponseReceived 
 What I don't understand is how lazy Bytestring works! Where the the back-pressure is in the lazy part? And, why does the file handle gets closed before sending the response? The sample code from the video is:
 type SimpleApp = Request -> IO Response simpleRun :: Int -> SimpleApp -> IO () main = simpleRun 8000 $ \request -> withBinaryFile "big-file.csv" ReadMode $ \h -> do lbs <- BL.hGetContents h pure $ responseLBS status200 [("Content-Type", "text/csv; charset=utf-8")] lbs 
 So, isn't the Bytestream being fed at lbs <- BL.hGetContents h line and then used at the very last line? The function withBinaryFile is being called in the callback function and that would wait till the response is sent at pure $ ... line, won't it?
 Any conceptual model I can imagine to better understand and visualize this?

 Right now, the buffer for org-roam-node-find lists only the title and tags. I'm trying to add the create date of the node to this list as well. After reading high and low, this is as close as I've gotten:
 (cl-defmethod org-roam-node-date ((node org-roam-node)) (org-roam-node-file-mtime node))
 (setq org-roam-node-display-template "${title:*} ${date} ${tags}")
 When I do this I get "wrong type argument: sequencep, xxxxx" when trying to find or insert a node.
 Any ideas on how I can make this work?
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been learning org mode and this year is the ear I want to fully dump my notion based system and migrate into org-mode. Most things I have figured out how to solve but I wanted to get a temperature check on how best to save myself duplicate data entry as I manage my daily/weekly/monthly/quarterly reviews. 
 The Goal
 Each day I will use org-roam daily capture template to generate a form with two main sections: 
  
Morning Stack
 Evening Stack
  
These will be largely data capture and routine outlines for myself. I'll likely utilize a 'metric' capture with gnuplot for things like my weight, sleep rating, mood etc. Direct links to my repeated routines i.e. mindset, gratitude type stuff. 
 In Notion I currently will use the relational database system to have each thing nested and rolled into each other so for example my weekly review has each of the 7 days of that week linked into it and I use a database roll up to grab the data entries for easy review that week. 
 In this at the end of each week I have a baseline of information of what happened that week ready to review, it also has some of its own higher level routines & processes built in there too. 
 I've considered using org-refile copy but its a little bit more of a manual process. I'm thinking some of that might be able to be automated either through some elisp or macros. However, before I go through doing all of that I figured I'd ask here for any insight since many of you are much more familiar with org and its tricks than I am.
 Ultimately I want to roll from daily into annual. (Daily -> Weekly -> Monthly -> Quarterly -> Annually)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Been reading through this article https://emacs.cafe/emacs/orgmode/gtd/2017/06/30/orgmode-gtd.html. It's not lost on me that it's a bit old but I've failed to figure out any solution to a question I had.
 ​
 I had to make an adjustment to the capture template as it was creating each new TODO in as a sub-level of tasks.
 (setq org-capture-templates '(("t" "Todo [inbox]" entry (file "~/org/gtd/inbox.org") "* TODO %i%?") ("T" "Tickler" entry (file+headline "~/org/gtd/tickler.org" "Tickler") "* %i%? \n %U"))) 
 Now I've working through refile and I've noticed that refile only allows me to move the current item to a sub-item in the existing defined file. This makes sense in some cases, however, I think it'd be more useful to be able to create new top level headings in the gtd.org file. Say a new project emerges is one case....
 ​
 I have tried change the max level setting, to no avail as well as setting 
 org-outline-path-complete-in-steps 
 which did appear to work at first, but this was unsuccessful as well. 
 ​
 So I'm curious, am I thinking about this the wrong way (as a general practice in org-mode... ) or have a messed up some settings here.
 ​
 I'll add that I'm completely open to advice in org mode and even my GTD process (I'm new to both.... although I read the book years ago)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I'm editing some non program files such as documentation for instance, there are times when I need completion for function names or variables of one language or the other.
 For example I many need completion for some functions and variables from some C or Lisp project I am editing, and I need to trigger it momentarily or temporarily for names from the project then turn it off after I get the names I want.
 It would be a good to have a some file-local variables that hold a list of project directories and file types that would provide the completion canditates then toggle them on and of when needed.
 One of my configurations had a completion that showed a list of groups that the completion at point could be based on, but it hasn't been coming up of late.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[According to the info, "The mode’s hook is called both when the mode is enabled and when it is disabled." 
 I would like my hook to behave in one way when the mode is enabled, and differently when it's disabled. What is the best approach for that? Is there any way to make the hook aware of its context?
 ​
 Some more info about my use-case: this is for my work-in-progress package sticky-shell, whose main purpose is to define a minor mode in a shell buffer, displaying a header with the latest prompt. This makes it easier to keep track of which command was run, even in cases where the command has many lines of output. I've noticed that, some times, the command can be quite long and not fit within a single header-line. For these cases, I've come up with `sticky-shell-shorten-header-mode', which is an additional mode shortening the header.
 I would like this additional mode to be "tied" to the sticky-shell-mode, so that when sticky-shell-mode is disabled, sticky-shell-shorten-header-mode is also automatically disabled. 
 I'd also like users to be able to turn on/off shorten-header-mode whenever they want, and choose whether to run a sticky-shell-mode hook to automatically enable the shorten-header-mode every time they enable sticky-shell-mode.
 In my mind, all of these features would be accomplished by keeping the two as separate modes, and constructing a hook for sticky-shell-mode that will be context-aware, so that when sticky-shell-mode is enabled the hook automatically enables shorten-header (if the user opts in to this feature), and when sticky-shell-mode is disabled, the hook automatically disables shorten-header.
 ​
 Does anybody have suggestions for this? Should I try a different approach instead?

 For the past I_do_not_know_how_many years, I have constantly been switching between Vim/NeoVim and Emacs. Recently, NeoVim was my editor of choice due to the blazing fast development pace. In a very short time, we gained a very powerful scripting language, tree-sitter support, LSP, etc.
 From the user's point of view, Emacs seemed stalled. Since I did not participate in the development, Emacs was just a colossal inertia going on in a uniform movement for me.
 However, things did change A LOT in the last few years. Emacs 29 is just amazing! We have tree-sitter support, LSP support, native compilation, etc. The community packages are fantastic (as always) and very well-integrated. The experience could not be better.
 I would like to thank all the devs for their amazing work.
 I also need to mention Doom emacs, which helped me with a fantastic set of sane default configurations.

 Does anyone have any idea why the authors just didn't implement something like:
 data Tuple4 a b c d = Tuple4 a b c d 
 This obviously removes the nesting. But it seems like since Data.Tuple.Nested is its own library there must have been a reason...
 Is this nesting better for some reason?

 The entire scenario boiled down to to planning the first turn correctly. I shudder to imagine doing so without Org-mode to reduce complexity.
  
First I iterated the list of operations by studying the map.
 Then I grasped the strategic plan of 4 main heroes each clearing a surface quadrant.
 Then I iterated the tactical logistics of turn 1 to transform a haphazard landing zone into a well-supported blitz.
  
The outline simplified the process of deduction in #1-2, allowing me to focus on execution with a clearly-defined goal in #3.
 This YouTube Org-mode demo video shows how I used a single outline to
  
study the map
 iterate operations and tactics
 publish my results
 follow up.

 Longer explanation: In my setup, I assign the TODO status while doing weekly review to tasks I intend to do this week. Thus, I do not want to add a TODO status to inbox items, since I would have to remove it in most occasions before I refile the task. Problem is: I also would like for inbox items to be shown in agenda, since I have to act (refile) on them. But agenda is for tasks only, as far as I understand. 
 Of course, I could assign some tag like ::INBOX:: to inbox items, but it makes no difference, since I would have to remove it later too, or write a custom refile function which removes it. 
 Is it possible to force agenda to display all not-scheduled, not-task items from a particular org-documents only?

Now every time I try to create a new entry in the journal, all carryover tasks are getting added.
 I also tried configuring  (setq org-journal-carryover-items "-carried")  but after adding this one, org-journal started to tag my non-todo items with that and include the non-todo items as carryover tasks which I don't want. This solved the issue of adding carryover tasks though.
 I just want only todo tasks to be carried over the next day once when I create new journal entry.
 If possible I want to mark the task as DONE for older entries also one I mark the carried over tasks as DONE in my current journal entry (:P)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all,
 I have been using Emacs for a while now, and had set it up very well to suit my old Ubuntu system (used Emacs 27.1). Now having switched to Mac, I am facing several issues. I am unsure whether it is due to the usage of the 28.2 Emacs version or the Mac that is causing these issues. I have listed them all below. Please provide any help you can for any of the issues.
  
When I do C-x 5 f , the new frame which is opened has the default settings of font and not what is on my ~/.emacs . However the theme (cobalt-blue) is as defined on my init file. The piece of code I use for font is (set-frame-font "Monospace Bold") . Is this sufficient to keep the font same across all buffers and frames I open on my Emacs? If not, how do I fix this issue? If you think there is something else that is overriding this command and leading to my problem, please let me know. I will provide more details from my init file.
 To open Emacs from terminal I followed the steps provided here. However, I am unable to open a specific Emacs file from my terminal. Whenever I try to do emacs file.py it opens the only the emacs GUI front page without loading the contents of file.py. It says on the terminal -bash: .emacs: Permission denied. How do I fix this issue and open the file.py on Emacs?
 The keyboard for Mac is different from the one I used for my Ubuntu system. The Command key plays the role of the Control key here, but has many more features. I added the line (setq mac-command-modifier 'control) to map my Command key to Emacs control key. However, this messes up everything because the fundamental operations using Command key (such as closing files using Command-q ) is not working. So is there a good key mapping (For Control and Meta keys) for Emacs for MacOS that someone can suggest?

 ​
 For those not familiar with the auto close tag / auto rename tag extension, it works like this:

 I type <b>

 I get <b></b> immediately, as soon as I type the trailing >.
 ​
 And if i edit the first <b> to be let's say <a>, then immediately the second </b> becomes a </a>.

 There are still many things that are better in org-mode, but unless we can give people a way to use it without telling them that they need to use emacs as well, we'll be fighting an uphill battle.
 I was thinking of something recently and wanted to pick the communities brains a bit:
 Is there something like a "command-line emacs translator" that can take an org-mode file, execute it and retrurn the HTML or PDF, or ...
 A bit like Quarto, but for org-mode. Does such a thing exist?
 Or is there an emacs version, that's fully set-up, so the user doesn't need to know anything about it to use it?
 I don't mean Doom Emacs. That's what my config is built on, but that's still too complex for most people.

 I really, really like many things I can do in orgmode, e. g. assigning many different todo states, filtering items for printing with the noexport tag, using refile for quick archiving etc.
 But for me, there is one seriously glaring weakness in its arsenal: It makes it sooo difficult to move multiple items around in an outline, it's not even funny.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is the first release that was executed via the new GitHub CI. Everything went smoothly, except for an unexpected packaging bug on windows due to text-2.0 linking against libstdc++ by default.
 If you're affected by this and have a defunct binary, simply run the installer again.
 We're also delighted to announce integration with errors.haskell.org, which already has a couple of GHCup codes documented, e.g. https://errors.haskell.org/messages/GHCup-00010/
 How to update/install
 Follow the instructions here: GHCup 
 Or run ghcup upgrade for existing installations.
 ChangeLog
  
restore proper support for FreeBSD and Linux armv7
 integrate with errors.haskell.org, wrt #434
 allow to overwrite distro detection via config wrt #421 
 this is particularly useful for e.g. Ubuntu derivates, where ghcup doesn't pick the optimal bindist, also see the GHCup documentation on overriding distro detection
 
 Add proper support for mirrors wrt #357
 fix a (harmless) bug in ghcup nuke on windows
 improvements to ghcup add-release-channel wrt #708
 fix building newer GHC from source wrt #433
 Fix ghcup install hls -u on windows
 Fix failure with --isolate=dir --force
 Add --metadata-fetching-mode arg, fixes #440
 Add content-length property to downloads
 Fix a grave bug on armv7 during installation wrt #415
 improve many warning/error messages (contributions by @taylorfausak)
 some minor optimization in ghcup whereis ghcup
 improve --keep=always to not clean up directories in certain circumstances
  
Not there yet
  
TUI on windows has a prototype, but it has performance issues that makes it of questionable usability... needs more investigation
 compiling HLS from within the TUI? This needs more discussion

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am looking for ways to split my configuration into multiple files that would work with byte and native compilation. For the past year, I have been using init-loader to load my el files. However, native compilation has always produced many errors like "Assignment/reference to free variable" or "function not know to be defined". I assume that's because each file is compiled separately and some files might depend on packages that are loaded in other files (in other words, I load them in order, but they are compiled separately).
 These warnings haven't bothered for the most part, but every once in a while I run into issues because a "function" is actually a macro and it needs to be expanded correctly for native compilation to produce the right results.
 What is the correct way to split configuration into multiple files while making sure that byte and native compilation works?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I've been learning Haskell for the past couple of months, and in order to solve a problem I am working on, I need to be able to calculate the diameter of a n-ary tree. However I feel like I've been banging my head against the wall these past few days as I cannot seem to get it to work.
 The tree is represented as a list of pairs that represent the edges of the tree: for example
 [(1,2),(1,3)] will be the following tree:
 1 
 / \
 2 3
 Is there a simple way to calculate the diameter of a tree in O(n)?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 newbie here.
 There are cases (eg. in svg-tag-tags) where you cannot specify (say) a background color, but instead you specify a face to use.
 Now my question is: What face do you use in such cases?
 What I currently do is use a face that is already defined but not used in my document (usually I use org-level-8) that I tweak with custom-set-faces.
 However I feel that this a bit of a hack and it would make more sense to define my own face (that however I don't yet know how to do).
 So should this be the way to do it: How would I define a new face that is based on an already existing face and only adjusts some attributes?
 I hope that was understandable....
 Many thanks!

 Recently I've been trying to understand how Erlang's bit syntax works, and in the process wrote a library which does something similar:
 https://github.com/stevana/bits-and-bobs#readme
 The readme is written a bit like a blog post, providing motivation, showing how to use the library and explaining how it's implemented. I'm especially interested in how we can go beyond what Erlang does when it comes working with binary data, I mention some ideas in the last part of "contributing" section.
 I hope you find it interesting, and please let me know if you got any feedback, questions or comments!

 #+BEGIN_SRC elisp (setq colors '("blue" "red")) (print colors) #+END_SRC #+RESULTS: | blue | red | #+BEGIN_SRC elisp (dolist (item '(1 2 3)) (print item)) #+END_SRC #+RESULTS: 
 ​
 Now what I don't understand here is that the first code block produces the expected output in the result-area, the second code block where I iterate over a list however produces no output.
 "Code block produced no output" is what emacs says - but why? Why don't I see 1 2 3?
 Please enlighten me here...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was reading through https://www.fpcomplete.com/blog/2018/04/async-exception-handling-haskell/ where the author claims it is never safe to recover from asynchronous exceptions. The safe-exceptions package also claims it.
 Now, I'm not sure what recovering means here, but if it really means catching an exception, doing something and not re-throwing it all the way until the program exits, it sounds extreme. One practical example is as follows: a chat application attempts to send a message to another user, but delivery times out asynchronously, i.e. a caller-imposed timeout. Or perhaps the user cancels the action by pressing a button. Whatever was trying to send the message should do its own cleanup and rethrow, via bracket. However, at some point the application is going to have to present an error gracefully to the user and ignore the exception, not just clean up and crash. Or maybe it wants to reattempt delivery at a later point.
 So, what does it really mean that recovering from async exceptions isn't safe? In the previous example, it's true that one might not trivially know whether the action completed, failed or did something inbetween, but recovery is still theoretically possible, e.g.: explicit state syncing or reporting back what step failed (did we receive an acknowledgement from the server or did we cancel before?). Perhaps it means that recovery cannot always happen locally and you might often need to propagate exceptions upwards. But taken to the extreme, it seems to imply that async exceptions must always result in a crash, albeit a safe one.

 I'm re-working some MS Azure Labs in powershell and bash to improve my understanding.
 Doing this in org-mode, be gentle, I've been using org for a while but babel not so much. I'm thinking of blogging my solutions.
 When I run some of the commands they echo things that I don't want the world to see. I want the text of the output but with some of the fields obfuscated.
 This needs to be as automated as possible and repeatable.
 example:
 When I log in to Azure I see something like the following. I'd like to edit the email address and the last part of the Tenant ID as I have done here 
  Account SubscriptionName TenantId Environment ------- ---------------- -------- ----------- email@outlook.com Azure subscription 1 29aa18ee-fdf4-49f7-b5f2-xxxxxxxxxxxx AzureCloud 
 I have a notion of running an emacs lisp code block over the output but have not come up with a way to achieve that. 
 Thanks
 Steven.

 ​
 The main impetus for this was having lots of icloud files, trying to open them from within Emacs, and Emacs opening the local ".icloud" file, causing me to have to open Finder and download the file from there.
 So I wrote up a quick package to help with these cases: automatically download an iCloud file when trying to open it, plus some additional utilities, like downloading a list of files or any file matching a regexp within a given directory. As far as I know these aren't easily achievable from Finder or the command line, so it's nice to have an Emacs interface for them.
 Sharing here in case people are interested: it needs some more work (see some of the TODOs in the code for example), but I could turn this into a proper package. Any feedback on the code is welcome.
 I'm also wondering if people can think of different ways to achieve this: Emacs has been around for a long time so I'm sure it has some functionalities to deal with remote files already. Maybe it'd be possible to use those built-ins for this purpose as well?

I'll share some behind the scenes with you. The notes on forgetting started as one note then I saw that they were about different aspects of forgetting. I had critiqued @ctietze's note and suggested explosion, so I eat my own dog food, as we say colloquially.
This morning a note in my review cycle stimulated the creation of a hub to bring the ideas about 'Prompts'  together in a bumper car fashion. Ideas around creating prompts and their use have cropped up in recent readings, and the note that kicked me in the butt was dated December 19, 2020. It seemed like I couldn't not make a hub. The 'Prompts' hub currently organizes 17 notes on the topic.
What I'm Working On
12 New Zettel in the Last 7 Days.
Titles and one-sentence summary/meaning of atomic zettel. These are the ideas I'm currently wrestling with. They represent a 7-day window of new notes.

 As it turns out, FP is apparently very popular with JSers, given that JS is a semi-functional language due to its inheritance from Scheme. There have actually been JSers who've said:

 https://www.zerotohero.dev/learn-haskell/
 ​
 Around some community Discord servers, I meet quite a few JS devs, and I think a few prominent Haskellers actually came in from JS.
 ​
 The problem is, well, the typical Haskell problem. People come in, learn some degree of Haskell, use pure Functional Programming to improve their baseline programming skills, then go back to whatever language they use, often taking concepts back to them in order to improve the language.

 In the JS case, though, is there any way …]]></summary>

 I have hard time actually understanding the internal documentation of emacs - a similar feeling I had with linux when I started. That made me realise how the most valuable resources for learning linux were community created guides and users explaining how they do things: and especially how they refer to documentation.
 Where can I find similar resources for emacs? I mainly am interested in personalising orgmode, like creating templates and macro commands. But also more fundamental things such as where to store work-files, and how to separate personal use of orgmode.

 flatten :: (??? t1, ??? t2) => t1 (t2 a) -> t1 a flatMap :: (??? t1, ??? t2) => (a -> t2 b) -> t1 a -> t1 b 
 where flatten is a generalized version of concat and catMaybes, and flatMap is a generalized version of concatMap and mapMaybe.
 And more generally, input lists can usually be replaced by Foldable, but how do you get rid of output lists? I know Traversable lets you repackage stuff back, but it’s the wrong way around for this case.
 Solved:
 flatten :: (Alternative m, Monad m, Foldable t) => m (t a) -> m a flatten = (>>= foldr append empty) where append = (<|>) . pure (.:) :: (c -> d) -> (a -> b -> c) -> a -> b -> d unary .: binary = (.) unary . binary infixr 8 .: flatMap :: (Alternative m, Monad m, Foldable t) => (a -> t b) -> m a -> m b flatMap = flatten .: fmap 
 Upd: Alternative versions if you just want an iterator instead of repackaging:
 flatMap :: (Foldable t1, Foldable t2) => (a -> t2 b) -> t1 a -> [b] flatMap f = concatMap $ toList . f flatten :: (Foldable t1, Foldable t2) => t1 (t2 b) -> [b] flatten = flatMap id

 Given an array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, return the maximum between the number of positive integers and of negative integers (0 is considered neither negative or positive). 
 The video presents a haskell solution iterates over the list twice:
 maximumCount xs = on max length pos neg where pos = filter (>0) xs neg = filter (<0) xs 
 and a commenter presents an optimisation using span and dropWhile. 
 Out of the presented solutions, only C++ used std::equal_range, which performs binary search to find the solution. In wondering if there was an elegant haskell alternative I found the linked article.
 Are there any other idiomatic ways to efficiently approach this problem in Haskell?

 I'll be writing code and it'll try to suggest completion. I don't have a good screenshot of this, but sometimes I want to complete something like: my_long_signal_name. I start typing and the suggestions and the completion company provides is my_loNG_SIGNAL_NAME. It doesn't appear to correctly maintain the case of the original it's retrieving the suggestion from. 
 I thought this was something to do with the dabbrev module, but honestly I thought I told it how to handle cases in the configuration and this clearly isn't helping.
 (message "---- Company") (use-package company :config (setq company-dabbrev-ignore-case 'keep-prefix) (setq company-dabbrev-downcase nil)) (use-package company-statistics :hook (after-init-hook . global-company-mode) (after-init-hook . company-statistics-mode)) 
 For awhile I just got rid of it. Emacs vhdl-mode has tab-completion that works pretty well, just doesn't provide the dropdown which is nice if there's some confusion as to selection.
 Anyone have a SANE company setup that preserves the case of the suggestion? I have thought maybe I ought to use the etags backend perhaps, and like I said, I've gotten rid of it for awhile, though I do like it's path name suggestions in other non-source code documents so I'd kind of like it back.
 Also open to other completion modules, company just is generally frequently recommended.
 Any ideas on how to properly setup company or another module for this behavior? Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There are specific solutions for eww and Firefox (see below), but I'd love a fully general solution that just transforms the clipboard content. Ideas on that?
  
For yanking from eww, there's the command org-eww-copy-for-org-mode (part of the module ol-eww), although it only preserves hyperlinks, no italics or anything else.
 
For Firefox there is the addon Org Capture -- but for me it just copies plaintext! I already wrote a quick setup guide, if you want to give it a spin, but it doesn't satisfy me:
 
  
Org Capture web extension
 Step 1. Add these init lines
 (require 'org-protocol) (server-start) 
 Step 2. Make sure you have a member of org-capture-templates that goes something like
 ("p" "Firefox capture" plain (file "/tmp/captures.org") "* %a\n%i%?") 
 Step 3. Run the appropriate one-time command found at https://github.com/sprig/org-capture-extension#register-emacsclient-as-the-org-protocol-handler -- it may look involved but most of it doesn't apply to you, just find the bit that does, and copy paste it into M-x shell.
 Done, now you can capture anything by clicking the toolbar button.

Currently in org-mode when I type this inline it is subscripting to $start_{date}$ which is, well... not great. 
 Is there a way to disable this behaviour (or better yet, enable it when I want it? ... like with markdown where inline math gets rendered as above denoted by single $ bracketed formulae? This is weirdly something markdown seems to get right over org-mode near as I can tell (as well as the ease of having inline code blocks. denoted by backticks in a line.
 Hunting in the docs I could not see a way to granularly control this without turning off prettier_entities completely which would impact a lot of niceties.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello people.
 I have a small annoyance when opening Emacs. I currently have a home brewed config that's simple enough for my usage that I don't need to rely on the daemon to speed up opening a frame. It should take less than a second but recently for some reason when I open Emacs on KDE the task bar shows the icon for Emacs that then closes to give place to what I think it's the Emacs Client simply because the title bar shows "Emacs (Client) *scratch\*" but every process monitor shows it's a regular Emacs instance.
 This didn't happen before. I've been using Emacs frequently and after about a month of continuous usage I began experiencing this behaviour. No matter how I start Emacs, from command line, from the apps menu, from a key combo shortcut. Always the same.
 I tried hiding the emacsclient.desktop file from my user's menu with no luck. This happens in KDE regardless of distro. I have an Arch, Manjaro, Garuda and openSUSE TW, all with KDE and all behaving the same. Even when I completely remove my customization files, the regular, old, white Emacs shows the same behaviour. None of these machines have used the daemon/emacsclient in their current installations so I know there's no lingering config from the past.
 Any idea where I can look and/or explain this behaviour.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Looking for suggestions for a good distributed job queue library: - Makes it easy to schedule a one-off job to execute at a specific time, and one worker will pick it up/execute it - Also supports cron style jobs (regularly scheduled jobs vs. one-offs) - Underlying queue persistence could be Redis or Postgres - Ideally it’s a Scala lib, but Java is OK too - Ideally reasonably popular/mature - FOSS
 Something like https://github.com/taskforcesh/bullmq , but for the JVM.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So a pretty fun video popped up on my feed 1 Problem, 24 Languages by code_report. In this video, the author solves a single LeetCode problem in 24 different programming languages (including Scala) and gives his thoughts on his likes/dislikes.
 I thought to share this with this forum because, on the slide where he compares runtime performance, Scala is the worst. Now, I had no expectations given the need for a JVM to start that Scala was going to be anywhere near the most performant languages, but I am kinda shocked it's literally in last place.
 The author does give caveats that these performance numbers come from the LeetCode editor and even suggests the entire section could be ignored. But I still thought this would be an interesting topic to discuss.

As the 2022 State of Haskell Survey highlighted, one of the most desired improvements to the whole ecosystem is better documentation and learning material.
That issue can only be addressed with great effort. For this reason, many contributions are necessary to tackle the problem from several angles.
In this post I’d like to summarise what Tweag is doing in this space. In particular, there are three projects we are working on to help make Haskell adoption and usage a little bit simpler and more straightforward:

This is not the traditional code folding method, which allows toggling visibility of multiple functions or classes at once.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I used to be a Scala dev, and I came back to my home country, Korea because of COVID situation.
 Now I'm thinking of working in abroad again, because I'm about 40, and it's 'RELATIVELY' old to find a DEV job in Korea. Surprisingly, age is a huge deal breaker when finding jobs, especially DEV jobs in Korea. And it's hard to find Scala jobs in my home country because only few people are using it, and I prefer to work in English environment.
 I would say my skill is in somewhere between beginner and mid level (hoping it's learning toward to mid). I have limited experience in Cats or IO like that, but I am happy to use it and learn it more. And I can do some front-end dev also.
 Is there any good countries to find Scala jobs more easily? In my view defining 'GOOD' is,
  
places where plenty of find jobs exists
 gives working visa easily
 decent salaries
  
I think 1 and 2 is most important, 3 is somewhat negotiable.
 I know economy is not good recently, but what else I can do, I need money.
 Thanks in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am not a good Elisp hacker. When I started using ChatGPT more often, I started experimenting with letting it write Elisp code. 
 I am completely blown away what it can do!
 Example Query
  
Write an Emacs Lisp function that will do two successive regular expression search and replace functions. First it should search for this regular expression ^- and replace by ##, next it should search for this regular expression: ^[ \t]+- and replace by -
  
Result
  
Here's an example function that performs the two search and replace operations you described:
  
 (defun my-search-replace () (interactive) (save-excursion (goto-char (point-min)) (while (re-search-forward "^- " nil t) (replace-match "## ")) (goto-char (point-min)) (while (re-search-forward "^[ \t]+-" nil t) (replace-match "- ")))) 
  
This function can be called with M-x my-search-replace, you can also assign it to a keybinding, like this (global-set-key (kbd "C-c s") 'my-search-replace)
  
It even EXPLAINS the answer! Wow!
 I'll start hacking more Elisp now that I have a patient teacher.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm working with a server that requires a password and one-time code to log in over ssh (no key-based login possible), and this does basically work with tramp after adding the OTP-prompt to `password-word-equivalents`.
 However, tramp is having trouble filling in the password automatically even though it does find a corresponding entry in `auth-sources` (I'm using the `pass` backend which works fine). I think the issue is that the server _first_ asks for the one-time code, and _then_ for the password.
 Thanks to the power of the recursive minibuffer, I'm able to call `password-store-otp-token-copy` and `password-store-copy` when tramp asks for one-time code and password, search for the right entry, then paste the code/password back to the prompt.
 Ideally, I would like to "teach" tramp to find the password on its own so I don't need to manually find and paste it every time. Is there a way of telling it which secret to use for which prompt? Alternatively, would it be possible somehow wrap the login process in an elisp function that automates the task?
 I'm asking here since I'm a little bit stuck on where / what to look for in the tramp / auth-source source code; I've read the manual pretty extensively but can't find much on the topic. Luckily it's not a huge issue since the ssh connection is re-used for subsequent logins so I only have to do this once or twice a day, but automating the login process would still be a nice improvement.
 Thanks in advance for the help!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am trying to get a Jupyter-like experience in org mode using org mode. I mostly followed the "Replacing Jupyter Notebook with Org Mode" blog post by sqrtminusone and added some additional config to have conda-environment-aware IDE features in Python mode. You can see my current config here: https://github.com/martibosch/snakemacs 
 The issue is that, although python-mode is activated within jupyter-python src blocks, I do not get proper indentation when I use the tab key. This is expected since org-src-tab-acts-natively is set to nil in my config (following the config by sqrtminusone. However, if I set it to t, everytime I use the RET and TAB keys (bound to org-return and org-cycle respectively) within jupyter-python src blocks, I get the switch-to-buffer behavior (e.g., conda environment activation from conda.el), which makes the editing slow and completely unpractical (tons of "Switched to conda environment" messages). 
 How can I get TAB indentation in my jupyter-python blocks without having this switch-to-buffer behavior? Thank you.

 By "VERY good", I mean ALL of the following are satisfied:
  
up to date
 
official or at least de fact standard
 
general syntax is fully described (variables, arrays, strings, class, functions, loops, etc)
 
it takes tens of hours to read through it (In other words, it should be much detailed than a simple "Getting Started" tutorial.)
 
 Currently, I can write more than 10 languages: Rust, Go, Java, C, C++, Python, JavaScript, TypeScript etc. And for many of them, there is a VERY good resource.
 Rust has the official the Book. TypeScript has the official Handbook. Go has the unofficial Learning Go - O'REILLY, which was released 1.5 years ago but almost up-to-date except for the generics support.
 How about Haskell? haskell.org lists some documentations but I can't tell if they satisfy the conditions above (especially for whether or not they are up-to-date).

 Kele (可乐, kě lè, or kə-ˈlə) (“Kubernetes Enablement Layer for Emacs”) is a Kubernetes cluster management package. It empowers you to perform operations as coarse or fine-grained as you need, fast, and get back to your work. 
 For a peek at what's currently possible, visit the documentation site, in particular the Usage section. For this initial release, it has feature parity with kubectx and kubens and that's about it, but there's lots of room for growth.
 It also comes with “batteries included,” containing several integrations with noteworthy packages, in particular Embark, that you can take advantage of for nimbly interacting with your configs and clusters.
 It's now on MELPA, so feel free to give it a try and leave your thoughts in the discussion board!

 I am new to emacs and just discovered emacsclient.
 What I would now like to have is a shell-alias that would run an emacsclient that automatically starts a server if there isn't one but I just cannot figure it out...
 This is what I have tried:
 emacsclient -c -a "emacs --daemon" emacsclient -c -a "" ALTERNATE_EDITOR="" emacsclient -c -a "" 
 In all these cases the client starts and the server gets started but the client does not connect to the server -it only prints "Waiting for emacs" to the console...
 So is there a way to have a command that simply always works - ie. if there is a server it simply connects, if there is no server it starts one and connects?
 Many thanks!

 I was wondering what is the intuition behind the .compile() method of fs2 streams in scala. One thing I notice from examples that some methods are enabled once .compile() is called, for example one could do .compile().count() to count the number of elements of streams. But what does the compile actually do ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all! I wanted to show off a project that I'm using to learn Haskell language: a "hello" web browser.
 https://github.com/acerion/hello
 The project is based on Dillo web browser (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dillo): it's an existing project with C and C++ code base, being slowly re-written by me in Haskell. The biggest part written in Haskell is responsible for parsing and matching of CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) but there are also other bits of code re-written in Haskell. This is just a side project that I do in spare time, so don't expect too much from it :)
 I decided to use an existing project (Dillo) and re-implement parts of it in Haskell because:
  
 I wanted to have a constant feedback on whether my code works or not (a web page either displays correctly or stops being displayed correctly),
 I wanted to see how much more compact Haskell code can be compared to original C and C++ code (so far code stats show no significant improvements in code size, probably due to my lack of knowledge of Haskell),
 I wanted to eventually end up with some "real world" program that has large parts of it in Haskell, and a web browser seemed "real world" enough.
  
​
 The project is hosted on GitHub: https://github.com/acerion/hello
 The Haskell code is in this sub-directory: https://github.com/acerion/hello/tree/master/src/Hello
 If you have any feedback or suggestions then I'm happy to hear them (just be aware that it will take a lot of time for me to take them in, this project is just a big experiment ran in spare time).

 Everything works in the debug session, it's just the error messages at the start that I'm concerned about.
 lldb-vscode is installed together with llvm using homebrew.

 Also eshell doesn't work outside emacs, so I cannot carry over my knowledge of eshell when I have to use some other terminal emulator. There should be an elisp interpreter outside of emacs so that I can write some small scripts within it instead of using python.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I'm trying to transition from imperative languages to functional ones, specifically Haskell, and started doing the challenges in HackerRank at the same time that I learn. It's a little hard when you come from imperative languages 😓.
 Currently, I'm struggling with the challenge Compare the Triplets. I've already spent some hours to have this:
 input = "5 6 7\n3 6 10" [a', b'] = map words $ lines input a = (map read a') :: [Int] b = (map read b') :: [Int] score :: (Num a, Ord a) => a -> a -> (a, a) score x y | x > y = (1, 0) | x < y = (0, 1) | otherwise = (0, 0) scores = zipWith score a b sum' :: Num a => [(a, a)] -> (a, a) sum' [] = (0, 0) sum' (x:xs) = (fst x + fst (sum' xs), snd x + snd (sum' xs)) main :: IO () main = print $ sum' scores 
 It works, but I'm stuck trying to get rid of input and use interactive instead to get the data. So my questions are:
  
May someone help me with the input part?
 I'm sure it can be done better, but I'm not able to figure out how, unless using an imperative approach. May someone point me to a more elegant/haskable way to solve it? (I'm planning to use a fold for the sum, for example).
  
Many thanks in advance.

Once you get used to it, going back to editing other languages feels terrifically slow and constraining. (Aside: I'm really hoping the tree-sitter era brings this kind of power to most languages.)
 But lispy is also highly opinionated, and at times quite intrusive. It takes a bit of the kitchen-sink approach, tuned to one specific workflow, touching all manner of capabilities beyond the basics. It overrides outline regexes, and adds cust…]]></summary>

 I'm happy to announce the first part of a five part tutorial on property-based testing stateful systems in general, and distributed systems in particular:
 https://github.com/stevana/property-based-testing-stateful-systems-tutorial#readme
 I think it's a resource that's missing, not just for Haskell but the larger (property-based) testing community. Given that I've tried to strike a balance between being general and abstract in the motivation and how it works sections so that people unfamiliar with Haskell can get something out of it, while being concrete in the (Haskell) code sections.
 I hope to announce part two on concurrent testing next week.

 When opening a Python file everything is unfolded.
  
I do evil-close-folds (<kbd>z</kbd> + <kbd>m</kbd>) to close all folds.
 Then I do evil-toggle-fold (<kbd>z</kbd> + <kbd>a</kbd>) to re-open the current fold (e.g. a class ...).
 And then I go in the next line and do M-x hs-hide-level.
  
The result may look like this:
 class Foobar: def folded_method():... def next_folded():... 
 I don't know how to reach that result with less keys presses. This isn't the focus of this question but maybe you have a hint? IMHO there is no vi-like "(un)fold-all-in-this-level" function.
 But I would like to add a vi-like (z plus something) shortcut to hs-hide-level also.
  
I'm not sure which shortcut I should use.
 I don't know how to configure vi-like shortcuts.

  (use-package evil :init (setq evil-want-integration t) (setq evil-want-keybinding nil) (setq evil-want-C-i-jump nil) :config (evil-mode 1) ;; Use visual line motions even outside of visual-line-mode buffers (evil-global-set-key 'motion "j" 'evil-next-visual-line) (evil-global-set-key 'motion "k" 'evil-previous-visual-line) ;; Set "normal" vi-mode in specific buffers (evil-set-initial-state 'messages-buffer-mode 'normal) (evil-set-initial-state 'dashboard-mode 'normal) )

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dear all,
 I'm very excited to announce release 3.13 of Copilot. Copilot is a stream-based DSL for writing and monitoring embedded C programs, with an emphasis on correctness and hard realtime requirements. Copilot is typically used as a high-level runtime verification framework, and supports temporal logic (LTL, PTLTL and MTL), clocks and voting algorithms.
 Among others, Copilot has been used at the Safety Critical Avionics Systems Branch of NASA Langley Research Center for monitoring test flights of drones. It also serves as a runtime monitoring backend for the requirements elicitation tool FRET (https://github.com/NASA-SW-VnV/fret/), via Ogma (https://github.com/nasa/ogma). These tools make it trivial to integrate Copilot monitors into other systems, by providing C modules with plain i…]]></summary>

 I have some org mode files containing denote notes for a bunch of papers that I would like to read, which each live in the root of my notes directory and have the tags _paper and _unread in their filenames.
 I would like to put a link in another org file (not a note) that would take me straight to a filtered dired view showing only these files.
 Has anyone achieved something like this, or do you have opinions about the best way to do it?

 (use-package eglot :bind (:map eglot-mode-map ("C-c a r" . #'eglot-rename)) :custom (eglot-autoshutdown t) (flymake-no-changes-timeout 5) ) (use-package python :ensure nil ; in-build! :hook (python-mode . eglot-ensure) :custom (python-shell-interpreter "python3") )

 I have no idea how to solve that in Emacs Lisp.

Intro: best game meets best editor
 Heroes of Might and Magic 3 is a turn-based strategy game released in 1999 that is still has an active multiplayer scene. It is the #1 turn-based strategy videogame of all time, according to Ranker.
 HoMM3 is a superb game for demonstrating iterative strategy refinement and documentation writing using Emacs Org Mode, because of HoMM3's ergonomic hotkeys and autosaves.
 HoMM3's hotkeys are honed by the multiplayer community, which plays timed turns, as in speed chess. The HD+ Launcher makes daily saves in tournament mode, allowing one to revert to any previous day. This is primitive version control for text, but excellent for a videogame.

 The top comments were about the problems at the PHP site, so please read past them.
 I just looked at the shortdocs examples in Emacs and I see how define-short-documentation-group can be a great help if shortdocs are developed and shared collaboratively.
 All you have to do is to visit the site, browse them, select those you want, download and incorporate them into your system, and add yours if you consider them superior.
 If there is some voting the best groups in each set rise to the top to make it easier.
 Is the FSF going provide some infrastructure for this, or will it have to be Github or Gitlab?

 I'd like to be able to review a list of tasks (buffer only or across multiple files) to determine the difference between when they were created, time to completion, and time active (in a certain state). I'd like to leverage :LOGBOOK: properties. 
 My goal is as part of a weekly review see where my time got chewed up, refine my estimates of effort and become more efficent with my planning. Ideally I'll extend this to include tags so I can add another layer like "how long is it taking me to get to items tagged :admin: on average". 
 I'm new to elisp and happy trying to work on it myself but some tips or starting points of the best way to address the problem would be appreciated! 
 Example:
 * DONE An important task CLOSED: [2022-05-22 Sun 20:00] :PROPERTIES: :Effort: 0:30 :END: :LOGBOOK: - State "DONE" from "TODO" [2022-05-22 Sun 20:00] CLOCK: [2022-05-20 Fri 10:00]--[2022-05-20 Fri 10:15] => 0:15 CLOCK: [2022-05-22 Sun 19:30]--[2022-05-22 Sun 20:00] => 0:30 - State "TODO" from [2022-05-15 Sun 20:00] :END: * Report | Task | Effort | Clocked | Missed | Lead Time | Cycle Time | |-------------------+--------+---------+--------+-----------+------------| | An important task | 0:30 | 0:45 | -00:15 | 7d | 1d |

#podcast #children #memorabilia
Make a podcast with kids: maybe share with the family, but not public.
Then you have memories to look back on later as the kids grow up. Meanwhile, the family has something to listen to once in a while without needing to visit. This could e.g. keep grandparents that don't live nearby in touch with their grandchildren, and a kind of conversation going. (Depends on the age of the child.)
Ideas for topics:
what questions (about life, the world) do you want answered?
what happened last week/month?
what are you playing right now?
just: what's on your mind? -- free form talk
Idea from this story:

  
When my daughter was 8 we made a six episode podcast together just talking about stuff. We didn't keep going, but revisiting the episodes is so nice. A couple of episodes had her 4 year old siblings too and hearing their tiny little voices and enthusiastic stuttering is bringing us joy.
I'm glad we did it, and I am now wishing we had more of these sorts of memories.

@nighthawk it was just at an age where they had heaps of questions and I could explain stuff to the best of my knowledge. We sat down and wrote down a bunch of questions on cards and then picked a card for each episode.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I thought folks around here might enjoy seeing how the chat gpt ai responded when I asked it describe a zettelkasten.  Here it is without modification.

  
Describe a zettelkasten.
The zettelkasten system was developed by the German sociologist and philosopher Niklas Luhmann, who used it to store and organize his notes and ideas as he wrote and researched. The name "zettelkasten" comes from the German word "zettel," which means "slip," and "kasten," which means "box."
In a zettelkasten, each note is given a unique identification number and can be linked to other notes through the use of cross-references. This allows for the creation of a web of interconnected ideas that can be easily navigated and explored.
The zettelkasten system has gained popularity in recent years as a tool for organizing and managing knowledge, particularly among writers and researchers. It is seen as a way to facilitate creative thinking and problem-solving by allowing for the easy access and retrieval of ideas and information.]]></summary>

 #+name: clean #+begin_src emacs-lisp :var in="" (flet ((clean (in) (if (listp in) (mapcar #'clean in) (if (stringp in) (replace-regexp-in-string "¦" "|" in) in)))) (clean in)) #+end_src #+name: regexps | first | (a¦b) | | second | (1¦2) | #+begin_src perl :var a=clean(in=regexps)[0,1] :var b=clean(in=regexps)[1,1] $a; $b; #+end_src #+name: : (1|2) 
 I've read flet is deprecated for being dynamic-global and not lexical -- or because cl is deprecated. Obviously, in the end it's just replacing ¦ for |, but how can this be redone for these "modern" lexical times? In general, where can I learn modern lexical, cl-* oriented elisp? Pre- and post-lexical is confusing.

 (scroll-left 10)
 would scroll left by 10 chars, but only if the current text scale is 0. If I zoom in with C-x + / (text-scale-adjust)), then the same command would scroll less than 10 chars.
 I might be terribly wrong, but from this I infer that scroll-left's argument is not the amount of characters. Indeed, the documentation says scroll-left's argument 
  
Value is the total amount of leftward horizontal scrolling in effect after the change.
  
This begs the question: how can I scroll left 10 chars, regardless the current text scale?
 I tried playing with text-scale-mode-amount and text-scale-mode-step, miserably failing.
 Any hint? Thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm perennially confused about use-package declarations and keywords, but what I want to do is the following:
  
  
Defer a package e.g. citar so that it doesn't load at init time (but the function definitions are known).
 When I do call the package, it loads the other packages as well, i.e. citar also loads citar-org-roam and the associated :config setup.
  
 
 Here is what I have now:
 (use-package citar :ensure t :defer t :custom ... ) (use-package citar-org-roam :ensure t :diminish t :after citar org-roam :no-require :custom (citar-org-roam-subdir nil) :config (citar-org-roam-mode) ...) 
  
 Is the right answer to use :requires citar-org-roam in the first citar macro?
  
  
 
 I am trying to speed up my init time, which was on the order of 20s, and now is around 9s, by deferring/lazy-loading some packages. I use Emacs in daemon/server-client mode anyway, so I don't need superfast init times, but small changes help.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[hi everybody, 
 I am learning Japanese and I am tired of having to switch input-method in the OS (linux and MacOS) and then switch back to be able to run any emacs command. As long as I am typing Japanese the OS method works well, but the moment I want to run a Ctrl- or M- command, the moment I have to swich OS input method.
 So I noticed that toggle-input-method seems allows japanese input while allowing romaji commands without switching.
 If you use emacs for Japanese, what is your recommendation regarding Japanese input? Should I stick with the OS one, or use one of the many Japanese input-methods?
 Basically, I am looking for advice from people who have to deal with Japanese within emacs.
 thank you in advance,

 I took just a couple minutes to scratch an itch I've had for a while now. I find my org agendas growing too large sometimes. I hesitate to remove things from my schedule because I don't want to forget them. But sometimes I just don't want to see it RIGHT NOW.
 Enter dired. I love dired-do-kill-lines to pare down my directory listings as I work on them.
 In the same spirit, I wrote the following (naive) function for getting rid of lines in the org-agenda.
 (defun alec-org-agenda-kill-line () "Kills a line from an org agenda, like `dired-kill-line'. It does so naively, so be careful using this!" (interactive) (read-only-mode -1) (delete-region (line-beginning-position) (line-end-position)) (delete-char 1) (read-only-mode 1)) (define-key org-agenda-keymap (kbd "M-k") #'alec-org-agenda-kill-line) 
 I've used it a bit and love it so far. For now I've just got this function for killing one line at a time. If I decide I want this to stay in my workflow, next comes more things "inspired" (copied) from dired like regexp marking and killing. Feedback welcome!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm still pretty new so maybe this is a dumb question - but I want to lmap over an ExceptT. Something like:
 lamp :: forall e e' m a . Functor m => (e -> e') -> ExceptT e m a -> ExceptT e' m a lamp f ex = ExceptT $ (lmap f) <$> runExceptT ex 
 Should I just leave it like this and use as a standalone function? Is it more normal to write the whole Bifunctor instance when you need it for a less common monad? Wouldn't I get an orphaned instance error if I tried to define this instance since I cannot add code to ExceptT nor Bifunctor libs?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've written a GHC plugin that lets you take things like the following code:
 main :: IO () main = do putStrLn "Which argument would you like to print?" index <- fmap read getLine arg <- fmap (!! index) getArgs putStrLn arg 
 and instead write this code:
 main :: IO () main = do putStrLn "Which argument would you like to print?" putStrLn $ !getArgs !! read !getLine 
 This is heavily inspired by Idris's !-notation, the main difference being that this plugin only allows you to use ! inside of existing do-blocks, whereas Idris will insert a do if it doesn't exist.
 It currently works with ghc 9.4. You can find it here:

 To be more specific, I periodically do a package list refresh and reload and my underyling package tech is straight.el. Even with the git commits for each repo limited to only 3 the process of pulling and applying updates locks up my emacs session for several minutes at a time. ( Let's not talk about the complexity of my .emacs, mkay? ;) ) I'm hoping that I can defun a local function that might wrap that process up in some form of concurrency so I don't have to go make coffee when I'm doing an Emacs package update.
 I've looked at just scheduling the refresh via midnight-mode but I don't really want to make updates that frequently. I've also looked at idle timers but I don't see a way to make the straight.el pulls pre-emptible and once the timer trips you are then along for the ride until the process completes. Lastly, I've looked into aio but I'm not good enough with elisp/maybe not smart enough to understand that API.
 Thoughts? Advice?

 I have been using eglot (built-in LSP client implementation) for a long time now, but recently have started to think about DAP, the debugger protocol. My workflow at work would be to write most if not all my code in Emacs, but when debugging, I would turn to Intellij.
 This is mostly because there is no built-in implementation of the DAP protocol in Emacs. Yes, there's dap-mode, but it's so strongly connected to lsp-mode that there have been multiple instances in time where people have shown interest in having DAP connected to eglot, the efforts have gone nowhere. 
 I'm not interested in starting a war between lsp-mode and eglot users, but as an eglot user myself, I would love to see these two communities work together to have a working and built-in solution. 
 Thank you all!

 I got type M s = ReaderT (PuzzleState s) (ST s), and a function canSolve :: Int -> Int -> Int -> M s Bool. In that function:
 case () of _ | assigned -> if sumDigit == i then canSolve 0 (col + 1) (carry `div` 10) else return False 
 The above works, but this doesn't:
 fmap (sumDigit == i &&) $ canSolve 0 (col + 1) (carry `div` 10) 
 This doesn't work either.
 pure (sumDigit == i &&) <*> canSolve 0 (col + 1) (carry `div` 10) 
 Both the expressions produce wrong recursion result. Why?

 in Scala cats effect, lets say I have a function that takes an integer and returns its double. I want to write a functional program that calls this function and prints to the console the return value. More precisely I have the following simple code:
 def f(x: Int): Int = 2 * x def program: IO[Unit] = { val y = f(2) // 4 IO(println(s"result is $y")) // println has side effects } 
 My goal is make the program as generic as possible like the following:
 def program[F[_]]: F[Unit] = { val y = f(2) F(println(s"result is $y")) } // won't compile, what is F? 
 however of course this will not compile because is generic and we do not now what is F(something). How can specify some behavior on F and what should that be behavior be ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am looking for a PostgreSQL only database library that can be easily used by Haskell beginner. It is not for me specifically but few of the college undergraduate students I intend to mentor. They would be building a typical multi-tenancy system, so you can expect typical, `tenant`, `user`, `emails`, `clients`, etc. kind of models/tables. And of course, the application domain entities.
 Avoiding the cost of learning EDSL that many Haskell DB libraries provide, I found out that only postgresql-typed and postgresql-simple allow to write only raw SQL queries easily. As I extensively use pgtyped for production Node.js application, I am thinking about using postgresql-typed. While I could find many resources for postgresql-simple, the same cannot be said try for postgresql-typed.
 I was able to get running with postgresql-typed and execute typical CRUD operations, but I fear that it may not support few of the important PostgreSQL constructs down the line. Also, the database must exist at the time of compilation of the project which is different from pgtyped as it generates TypeScript files at development time which we commit in the repository. I also get the feeling that after a while compilation time could increase exponentially as more queries gets added. I am already counting 50+ queries (Good thing is that the queries are not dynamic).
 So, my questions are:
  
Are my concerns valid about using postgresql-typed? (Slow compilations, need for DB at compile time, etc.)
 Lack of literature/articles around it? (Building own connection pool abstraction, etc.)
 Or any other recommendation? (Sticking to plain SQL and not EDSL)
  
​
 P.S - Kindly redirect me to right forum if this is not a right place. I am just a trespasser in a Haskell community :D

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello guys,
 I am struggling connecting to Libera chat server using VPN.
 Without VPN, I can log in automatically but if VPN is running, connexion is denied and I get an sasl error:
 -copper.libera.chat- *** Notice -- SASL authentication to a NickServ account with a verified email address is required to connect from your current network. Please seehttps://libera.chat/guides/sasl for configuration assistance.
 ==> ERROR from irc.libera.chat: Closing Link: gateway/vpn/protonvpn/account (SASL
 authentication to a NickServ account with a verified email address is required
 to connect from your current network. Please see https://libera.chat/guides/sasl
 for configuration assistance.)
 Connection failed! Re-establishing connection...
 So I read the specified Libera page but since I am using Doom Emacs, I really don't to make this works.
 If I try to use the '(require erc-sasl), I got an error: file not found.
 Anyone can guide me through the right process, please?

"treesit-install-language-grammar" calls "treesit--install-language-grammar-1" which says that it creates the "tree-sitter" directory under the user's emacs configuration directory if it doesn't exist. However I didn't see it do that, and I can't see the code where it allegedly does that.
 Is this a bug? How can I report it?

 I wonder how you guys think intuitively about fs2 streams with an effect F of the form fs2.Stream[F, Int]. From my understanding, F could be the IO monad of cats effect. But I can't make sense of how IO is related to the stream.

With VSCode it's only a couple mouse clicks, but when I run dap-debug-edit-template it give me this strange struct
 (dap-register-debug-template "Test function" (list :type "go" :request "launch" :name "Test function" :mode "test" :program nil :args nil :env nil)) 
 I have no idea what all these properties means and where are no documentation or examples about them. I was no able to find articles in medium or youtube videos, like this how to debug go tests in emacs with dap mode. My working project has very strange, legacy structure and dap give me Warning (emacs): Initialize request failed: Failed to launch error message.
 Please share your configuration or at least explain what all these properties means.

I have been following a course offered by the university of helsinki which uses stack for mostly running standalone programs. I am now undertaking my first project on haskell and wanted to know which package manager I should start with - stack or cabal. Since I am starting out, I want to do it right. I am also interested in being a cardano developer and they mostly use cabal and nix (not sure what nix is) as far as I know therefore, would like to think about that too. Please tell me which is better as a beginner.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've a strange problem. I modified some code with a continuation (where the input parameter is a class), but the code now forces the type within the continuation. And it doesn't work anymore.
 My example reduces to (this is not the real example)
 ​
 oldFunction :: Num n => (n -> Int) -> n -> Int oldFunction f n = f (n + 1) 
 compiles
 newFunction :: Num n => (n -> Int) -> n -> Int newFunction f n = f (floor n + 1 :: Int) 
 Doesn't.
 It wants f to be of type Int -> Int. I am surprised. I though the callee decided on the instance of the typeclass. If a f can take a Num it could take a Int . What am I missing ?

        <updated>2023-01-07T09:15:30.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have released a slightly updated version of labrat, a simple command-line program for printing labels with little cermony and that can be invoked from within Emacs or from a shell.
 You can read about it and how to install it on github here.
 This is from the README:
 
  
Motivation
  
I need to print labels. And in my case, mostly I need file folder labels. I typically want to print to a Dymo LabelWriter, of which I own several variants. The problem is that I work almost entirely in Linux, but the simple task of printing a file folder label has required opening a GUI application, such as the very fine glabels, or worse, switching to a machine running Windows or to a Mac to run Dymo’s proprietary GUI. The Dymo GUI is particularly irksome because it takes a long time to start up and demands that you register every time you open it.
 I wanted a way to print a file label from the command line, or even better, from within my editor, Emacs. After giving up looking for such a thing without success, I decided to write my own. Hence labrat. With it—after due configuration—printing a file folder label is as simple as:
 $ labrat 'First Line of Label-->And the Second Line'
 Or, you can preview the label in your previewer of choice (mine is qpdfview) by adding the -V flag:
 $ labrat -V 'First Line of Label-->And the Second Line'
 Even better, I have included with labrat an elisp file (labrat.el) that will invoke labrat to form a label with the text of the paragraph at or before point. So within Emacs, you can bind keys to the commands, labrat-print and labrat-view to print or view the current or prior paragraph as your default label. Thus, in Emacs, I have C-z C-l C-l bound to labrat-print and C-z C-l C-v to labrat-view, and I can type a label in any buffer and get it generated with very little ceremony.

And I cannot wait😁 To me any form of organization of stuff I recorded (notes, zettels) seemed futile, at least brittle. At least for long term use.
But I‘m sure, AI will help. It‘s a great area of application. Mem is already trying. More will follow.
Until then I‘ll just patiently record in a simple way whatever I find valuable. The current tool is not important, eg Roam or Obsidian or Mem or Notion. In the end the content can be either used across tools or exported so the AI can process it.]]></summary>

 I am experienced in typescript and new to haskell. Had this thought today. Perhaps satisfies wouldn't serve much use in haskell without subtyping, although maybe there are cases where type classes include each other and this could be useful. Interested to learn.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am trying to setup a note-making system with Emacs+org-mode. 
 I have already set up a MediaWiki installation for note-making. Here is a view of categories, subcategories and wiki page. It's very easy to navigate to any page I want by traversing the category tree. Organically, the categories and subcategories evolve over time. A wiki page can be under multiple (sub) categories.
 Category Tree in MediaWiki
 But installing MediaWiki means I need webserver+php+mysql stack, which I want to avoid if possible. If I have to backup, replicate, migrate, and update MediaWiki to a new machine it's not going to be easy. On top of this MediaWiki wiki syntax also sucks. Despite all these headaches, I still see this setup as valuable for providing me with category tree navigation and knowledge hierarchy.
 I know there is org-roam but it's not providing me these kind of dynamic category trees and allow a page to have multiple parents. For me these category hierarchies are more important than back links.
 I can use projectile + nested folders but I want the ability to one sub category available under multiple parent category. Creating and managing symlinks may work but it won't scale if I have 300+ wiki pages which should be filed under multiple parent categories.
 MediaWiki also provides a breadcrumb of clickable category links like below:
 Wiki > Subjects > Computer Science > Programming Languages > Clojure
 Is it possible to achieve 
  
similar Category hierarchy, 
 navigable dynamic category tree and
 multi-parent subcategories (i.e a category or page can belong to multiple parent categories)
  
any ideas/pointers to solve this with Emacs?

 Where is the point of intersection usually? At the 6 month mark? 1 year? 2? Certainly it may be subjective depending on what one finds difficult or tedious but aiming for a generalization here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all!
 ​
 Edit: I tried solving this by adding an autoload to `smudge-connect-player-status` which seems to have possibly fixed THIS issue, but there is another problem with Oauth that makes the whole thing hang and I'm not sure.
 I'm using Pop! OS, with Emacs installed from terminal, emacs 27.1.
 I posted a few months ago about getting Vuiet set up. I liked it a lot, but it was very minimalistic. Really only good for mindlessly playing a handful of tracks, and at that, you kinda had to know who you were looking for. It also had a few weaknesses, like constantly throwing up my debugger every time a particular song's lyrics couldn't be found.
 I finally gave in and switched to Spotify from YT Music since my partner uses it, and also I discovered Smudge, which looks awesome!
 ​
 Thing is, it doesn't actually work, because some functions are not defined yet. Something something spacemacs lazy loading. I'm not sure how to fix this but I know Spacemacs has some behavior which causes packages to not be completely loaded if they're not invoked - I think somehow this is what's causing the issue.
 So, I try to run: `global-smudge-remote-mode`
 This is the output:
 `smudge-connect-player-status` not defined.
 Any attempt to run another smudge function then causes emacs to hang indefinitely and it must be killed (That's dangerous!!!)
 I also noticed that when I first launch emacs, I only have access to functions which are defined in `smudge.el`, not ANY of the dozen or so other .el files included with this repository.
 Only smudge.el functions on startup.
 So I'm hoping this is a relatively simple configuration change I need to make in order to load this package properly and prevent the crashes. Thanks everyone!!!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 I think state machines of the type Input -> State -> (State, Output) are great. They are easy to reason about, and if run on a separate thread with access to a queue of Inputs they perform well too.
 Sometimes the state machine might need to do some blocking I/O before producing the output though, this slows down the processing of inputs.
 I've recently implemented and documented an experimental way of how we can write the state machine as if the I/O is blocking, but actually it's non-blocking and inputs can continue to be processes while we wait for the I/O action to complete:

 Any feedback, comments or suggestions are most welcome!

In every case, the buffer names of this sub-emacs process is "E: <BUFFER-NAME>", where that BUFFER-NAME is changes to whatever buffer is being visited in the sub-emacs at this time.
 Now, my goal is to have a key that will switch-buffer to that sub-emacs process whatever it is running, optionally starting the process if it hasn't begun yet. What is the best way to switch to my "E:.*" buffer?

Window 1 - Emacs
 Window 2 - Kitty Terminal with Tmux
  
In my Emacs frame. It is split into 3. On the left I have 2 panes with code and on the right I have the repl.
 This setup is fixed. As in, it doesnt really change much. 
 I use the terminal heavily for a bunch of coding and non-coding things while I am coding. Having the terminal on a separate window is very quick for me to switch and do something.
 I am curious what other peoples terminal workflow is. How do you integrate the terminal into your workflow? If you use term or v-term, how do you make switching easy and seemless?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I have not used orgmode for some time, but one of my new year's resolutions is to orgmodify my life.
 As I have recently started to get into android/wearos programming, I need to collect a lot kotlin code-snippets, each possibly with extra-information on what to put into gradle-files and what sdk-version to use etc etc.
 Any tips on how to best organize that?
 Many thanks!

 When I set the web-mode engine to php it only works if I use the "<?php" tags.

 Do you guys run Emacs on Android? And I don't mean just in terminal. I want a full-blown GUI that supports all the things Emacs 29 has - sqlite, etc. Is that possible or I just want too much?

 "Why did the Emacs user switch to Vim? Because they wanted to be able to exit the editor."
 "Why was the Emacs user upset when they lost their cursor? Because they couldn't find their point."
 "Why was the Emacs user excited about the new release of their editor? Because it had a cut and paste feature."
 "Why was the Emacs user upset when their editor crashed? Because they lost all their parenthesis."
 I hope these jokes bring a smile to your friend's face! Just be sure to keep in mind that everyone has different senses of humor, so it's important to be mindful of your friend's feelings and to not overstep any boundaries.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This has annoyed me for quite some time now and I've never found any solutions for it online. I'm using lsp-mode for C/C++, and I have some dependencies specified in a CMakeLists.txt.
 The problem: Emacs keeps complaining (I think it's the language-server who is complaining about this?) about c-headers for the dependencies specified in CMakeLists.txt not being found.
 The solution I've been using so far is to manually put the include paths to these dependencies in a compile_flags.txt file. For example:
 ``` -std=gnu99 -I/usr/local/include -I/usr/include -I./include
 Deps produced by cmake
 -I./build/_deps/webp-src/src -I./build/_deps/vec3_static-src/include -I./build/_deps/cglm-src/include ```
 However, it's kind of annoying to keep fiddling with these files all the time. Is there anyway to configure lsp-mode or whoever is complaining about missing C-headers to actually look inside the _deps folder created by cmake, without using a compile_flags.txt?
 Like a global system-wide compile_flags.txt ?
 Thanks!

 I don't care if there is a running process there - in fact I probably want it to run to update my email. I assume that's what it is doing.
 /shrug. 
 I mostly ignore it, but from time to time it grabs focus when I'm typing in another buffer and I need to re-focus the other buffer which is very annoying. The only way to make it go away is to quit and re-start emacs entirely, and to not run mu4e anymore.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone,
 I'm new to emacs and I've just started using org-agenda and I have a question for you.
 Let's suppose I've courses every Tuesday and Fridays from 10:00 to 12:00, starting on January 30, 2023, and up to march 18, 2023. I'm trying to enter this so that it shows in my org-agenda. I've done this in the following way:
 * TODO Biology class <2023-01-31 Tue 10:00-12:00 +1w> :PROPERTIES: :LAST_REPEAT: [2023-03-18 Sat 0:00] :END: * TODO Biology class <2023-02-03 Tue 10:00-12:00 +1w> :PROPERTIES: :LAST_REPEAT: [2023-03-18 Sat 0:00] :END: 
 When I activate the agenda view and go to yearly view (via the command org-agenda-year-view) I see the entries every Tuesday and Friday at the right time, but I also see them appear well beyond the LAST_REPEAT date that I fixed inside the PROPERTIES section.
 So my question is: am I understanding wrong the usage of LAST_REPEAT? Is this the expected behavior? What should I do to make those entries not show beyond a given day (i.e., once my courses are over)?
 Besides my particular question, I'm open to any suggestions as to how I could be doing this in a better/more practical way. I'm reading the manual online and this is what I've came up with, but it might be far from optimal.
 Thanks in advance for all your help.

 I usually update my OS before I turn off the computer. Started computer today and Emacs refused to start due to lbtiff.so.5 not found.
 Quick
 $ sudo ln -s /usr/lib/libtiff.so.6.0.0 /usr/lib/libtiff.so.5 
 (or recompile Emacs :)) fixes the problem; if anyone is experiencing the same issue.

 People say 'Learning Scala' by Jason Swartz is good but way too outdated as it is from 2015.
 Others say 'Programming Scala' by Dwan Wampler os too difficult to begginers and uses Scala 3.0, which is not widely used yet.
 And some say 'Scala Cookbook' by Alvin Alexander is good but misses fundamentals as it contains only recipes and assumes you already know the basics.
 Anything I'm missing here? Any recommendations?

 We are looking for anything that you think might be interesting for a wider audience and that is Scala related:
 ✨ Maybe you are using Scala in a novel way? 
 🧑‍💻 Or you wrote an interesting open-source library? 
 🦾 Or you have a use case to share from a project you are working on? 
 ⚙️ Or maybe you just want to show what can be done with the Scala language and existing Scala tools?
 Our main goal is to start some interesting discussions during the breaks and the after party, and inspire people to explore Scala and the Scala ecosystem later at home 💭
 Hence we are aiming at 30-minute presentations. We expect the audience to be familiar with the Scala language and its basic concepts. You don't need to have any previous speaking experience 👶

 I've been using AucTex for awhile.
 I really like it for the most part, but I'm betting indentation issues that are becoming a bit unbearable.
 I'm getting way too much indentation on most environments, which breaks my yasnippets and hurts readability.
 https://preview.redd.it/4g9lehqwk6aa1.png?width=1158&format=png&auto=webp&s=c9212e2a868ec488b41f9c9885e68284a9221d94
 And this is honestly something I could live with, but sometimes it just breaks altogether and decides to put 8 indents in the main scope and break everything.
 ​

 I'm wondering if there's a proper solution for this. I even tried turning off indentation all together, and that didn't work.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I use org-mode to create many of the documents I produce for both latex and html. However, I am having an issue that is the fault of the University's content management system, and I am hoping there is a quick option in org-mode (though reading through the docs and source, I don't see it).
 Basically, the CMS system first runs the HTML file through its own XML validator, which is rather stupid. There are two errors that prevent it from serving my ox-html output.
 First, the default ox-html mathjax declaration uses:
 <script id="MathJax-script" async src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mathjax@3/es5/tex-mml-chtml.js"> </script> 
 But, technically, the async should be a keyword/value pair, async="1" (value doesn't matter). I can fix that by customizing org-html-mathjax-template.
 Second, the default ox-html mathjax converter leaves the ampersand & character untouched. This is valid and fine, except when one has to go through a stupid XML validator, which says that & is the HTML start of a character code.
 Is there an option to enable ox-html to also convert & to &amp; in mathjax formatting? Obviously, ox-html does that already for text. I can do it after the publish with some elisp, but that seems like a PITA (one I am willing to do though).
 Any suggestions are welcome!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[More and more I've become enamored of the idea that Emacs could be an interesting front-end for systems/infrastructure management via tooling like magit's transient, hydras, consult-*, etc. The scenarios around Infrastructure-as-code, CM, CI/CD/orchestration tooling, and API interactions, well, it's just a reformulation of the original use case for Emacs ... manipulating streams of text programmatically
 I've been playing around with API interactions via elisp specifically and, though I'm not a Lisp expert by any stretch, I can already see where elisp might not be as robust of choice for integrating with external systems as another Lisp variant (ex: Scheme? Common Lisp?). Particularly as it relates to concurrent operations, error-handling, and automated testing. I'm guessing it will eventually be beneficial to reach into tools written in Rust and Golang and other languages via methods other than stdout/stderr/stdin but that's down the road a bit.
 So...the ask...any Lisp experts out there have insight as to which Lisp variant might be particularly good for:
 1) tight integration with Emacs and elisp
 2) integrating with other third-party APIs and particularly SaaS REST APIs
 3) ability to leverage non-Lisp ecosystem tooling with a level of effectiveness similar to, say, Python's glue extensions 
 Note: Yes, Python is quite effective at this sort of thing itself and I did consider exploring how I could graft Python to elisp for this task. For now, I think I would like to stick with Lisps. If my motivation were purely practical I would probably skip straight to the Python route.

Sane defaults, where I can easily change some editor options like theme, font, font size, etc.
 
How to remap key bindings.
 
Plugin manager that does lazy loading and loads the config of each plugin from a separate file.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Once upon a purely functional time,
 There was a language that shone so sublime.
 Its syntax, a study in elegance and grace,
 Was a delight to the most discerning codebase.
 This language was Haskell, a work of art,
 Whose powers of abstraction were second to none.
 It offered a refuge from the mundane and the coarse,
 A place where programmers could unleash their force.
 With Haskell, the horrors of side effects were laid to rest,
 As code was lifted up to a realm of the blest.
 No longer were we slaves to the whims of state,
 But masters of our domain, no longer irate.
 Yet Haskell was not for the faint of heart,
 For it demanded a level of discipline from the start.
 But for those who persevered, the rewards were great,
 As they soared through the skies, their code first rate.
 So if you seek a language that's pure and true,
 One that will elevate your code to something new,
 Then look no further, for Haskell is the one,
 A language that will surely have your code on the run.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am currently hitting the very disappointing reality of Template Haskell. Given a Haskell function I want to generate a second one that is slightly different, for example:
 foo i [] = [] foo i (x:xs) = i : foo xs 
 should allow me to generate
 foo' i [] = 1 foo' i (x:xs) = 1 + foo' xs 
 that mirrors the recursive structure of the function. I CAN'T change the original function foo to use something like recursion schemes.
 My initial idea was to use TemplateHaskell, get the name of the function, lookup its definition and then change it accordingly. But as the documentation states
  
The Maybe Dec field contains Just the declaration which defined the variable - including the RHS of the declaration - or else Nothing, in the case where the RHS is unavailable to the compiler. At present, this value is always Nothing: returning the RHS has not yet been implemented because of lack of interest.
  
So my second guess was to use write a QuasiQuoter and surround the original function with it. I can use ghc-exactprint to parse the function, but that gives me a HsSyn AST, not a template haskell AST. I started writing a conversion function, but this very tedious.
 Is there a better way to achieve this? Is there such a function already?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Another piece of fallout from Advent of Code. One of the problems was a cellular-automata-like problem. I initially used a Set to represent the items in the grid, but it had a runtime of about 6 minutes. I swapped out the underlying representation to be an Array of Maybe Automaton, and dropped the runtime to about 7 seconds.
 The bad news is that the code is even more imperative in style than it was before.
 Writeup on my blog. I think it serves as an example of how you can do imperative, state-mutating code in Haskell, and as a fuller worked example than some of the tutorials online.
 Anyone have any thoughts?

. EPUB 3 added as an output format, selected with --epub3
  
Which means that you can now convert .texi into .epub. So you can now convert Emacs Manual, the ELisp reference and others to .epub, load them on your e-book reader of choice and go to the beach, the forest, or wherever.
 The process is quite easy, if you have Texinfo >= 7.0 installed (texi2any --version):
  
Download the Texinfo source of the manual you want to convert like the Emacs Manual
 Ask texi2any to convert it:
  
 TEXINPUTS=".:.:" MAKEINFO="makeinfo --force --enable-encoding -I ." texi2any --epub3 emacs.texi 
 Replace emacs.texi with the name of the root .texi file of the manual you are interested in.
 The results are quite good, I've been reading the Emacs Manual again this way.
 The FSF publishes manuals for most GNU projects along with manuals related to Emacs though Texinfo sources are not published for all of them, you'll need to grab the release then.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What is the simplest way to perform a HTTP call from Outwatch that would conform to the architecture of this framework? Please treat this question as ELIP (Explain Like I’m a Pythonista with very limited understanding of functional concepts).
 The outwatch documentation shows how I can display dynamic contents based on Observables. The examples, however, show only observables that change their state via user action or timer ticks.
 I think I need to somehow create an Observable that would represent the query, so that when the query succeeds/fails the content of the page gets updated accordingly. I was thinking about using http4s library as this is what I use on the backend, but the documentation for http4s describes only very simple case of client code, where the calls are represented by IO[String] values that are synchronously executed. I also tried to search in Outwatch and colibri documentation, to no avail.
 I will be glad for both examples and theoretical explanations.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am watching this great talk by Daniel Spiewak motivating effects. In particular, there is a point where he mentions that you can't do retries with Future, but you can with effects. Of course you literally can do retries with futures (e.g. here), but you risk repeating side-effects that aren't properly contained in a transaction. Why is this not the case for effects?
 Example: say I want to log a statement then read a value from a database. In the case of a future retry, suppose the first attempt logs successfully then fails to read. The retry logs the statement again then reads from the database (successfully), resulting in two logs instead of 1. Why would an effects implementation only log once, supposing the same scenario?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Most mutable things in Haskell (IORef, STRef, TVar, etc.) share a common interface, which we can describe with a small typeclass:
  class Ref f m where readRef :: f a -> m a writeRef :: f a -> a -> m () 
 There are some (seemingly) obvious laws:
  
(writeRef ref x >> readRef ref) == pure x
 (readRef ref >>= writeRef ref) == pure ()
 (writeRef ref x >> readRef ref') == readRef ref' if ref and ref' are disjoint
  
It's often convenient to package up a curried Ref dictionary:
 data Var m a = Var { readVar :: m a , writeVar :: a -> m () } instance Ref (Var m) m where readRef = readVar writeRef = writeVar refToVar :: Ref f m => f a -> Var m a refToVar ref = Var (readRef ref) (writeRef ref)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The documentation for Data.Compact claims that:
  
Pinned ByteArray# objects cannot be compacted. This is for a good reason: the memory is pinned so that it can be referenced by address (the address might be stored in a C data structure, for example), so we can't make a copy of it to store in the Compact.
  
ByteArray# is the memory form of Text and ShortByteString, meaning you can't create a Compact of any datatype that contains Text or ShortByteString - including FastString. 
 But it's not clear to me why that's the case. We have a ByteArray#. It's pinned, so we can pass that to a C program through the FFI. From my perspective, copying the ByteArray# to a new pinned location in the compact region seems like it should be fine?
 What if GHC did decide to copy the data? What sorts of warnings and errors could happen instead?

 Here, I've asked it to describe to me what a function does. (This is code that I wrote myself.)

 It does a pretty good job! It even guesses that I might be matching against ~ because I'm looking for backup files.
 So elisp isn't my main language; maybe I could be doing things better.

 I have been using Corfu completion for quite some time now and one thing that annoys me so much is the beep on the first time the dropdown shows, no beeps after. I have already digged into corfu source code and it looks like the beep comes from somewhere else but somehow related to corfu. I have already test default completion-at-point and company and no beeps.
 Anyone have experienced similar issue and managed to silence it? ChatGPT suggested me to (setq corfu-beep-p nil) which is ridiculous. 
 Here's part of my config: ```lisp (customize-set-variable 'ring-bell-function 'ignore)
 (use-package corfu :straight (corfu :files (:defaults "extensions/*") :includes (corfu-history)) :custom (corfu-cycle t) (corfu-auto t) (corfu-auto-prefix 2) (corfu-auto-delay 0.0) (corfu-quit-at-boundary 'separator) (corfu-preview-current 'insert) (corfu-preselect-first nil) (corfu-on-exact-match nil) (corfu-min-width 80) (corfu-count 14) (corfu-scroll-margin 4) (corfu-popupinfo-delay t) :init (global-corfu-mode) (corfu-history-mode) (corfu-popupinfo-mode) (add-to-list 'savehist-additional-variables 'corfu-history)) ```
 I am using emacs-plus@28 on mac.
 EDIT: Simply (use-package corfu) also beeps on C-M-i.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have managed to build emacs-30.0.5 from source on a RHEL8 system. This took a lot of effort and compiling of other libraries to make it work.
 ​
 Emacs GUI comes up and many of my packages start and run. The issue is, the font I want is not being picked up. I want to use Fira Code as a font. The ttf files are installed in my ~/.local/share/fonts directory. I ran fc-cache for the system to detect them. fc-cache says there are 10 fonts in my ~/.local/share/fonts directory. The desktop font selection tool sees them and is able to use them for other GUI elements. 
 ​
 When I use Options->Set Default Font it pops up a small GUI that only knows a few fonts. It does not start the system font selection tool. My home PC does bring up the system font selection tool.
 ​
 In my custom-vars.el, which is loaded by init.el I have the following:
 (custom-set-faces
 ;; custom-set-faces was added by Custom.
 ;; If you edit it by hand, you could mess it up, so be careful.
 ;; Your init file should contain only one such instance.
 ;; If there is more than one, they won't work right.
 '(default ((t (:family "Fira Code" :foundry "CTDB" :slant normal :weight medium :height 113 :width normal)))))
 ​
 This works on my PC at home, but not my RHEL8 computer. There are no messages in the *Messages* buffer and there is no *Warnings* buffer. The GUI comes up and runs with some horrible default font that is hard to read. 
 ​
 Any ideas on what I am missing or doing wrong? Is it something I missed in compiling emacs? Something I am not setting up in my environment?

Does that fill your heart with joy and just a little bit of cringe when you know they're going to be looking at stock Emacs with a blinding white background and non-standard discoverability? Do you jump in and say, "here take this config file to help make things easier" or the like?
 This little project was born out of that frustration.
 Presenting, Emacs Bedrock
 Yes, I am an Emacs evangelist, and all around me know it. (Sorry guys.) I vacillate between giving people too much help or too little, I think. The ideal is to encourage new folks just enough to get over the initial hump and get them figuring out what they need to customize to get Emacs to work for their specific needs.
 This is just a little side project for me. I've had the ideas for this bubbling ever since Emacs 29 packed in so many nice features I wondered just how many of my 3rd-party packages I really needed. (Answer: I still have over 100 installed!)
 This package doesn't focus on setting a nice theme (though it does use modus-vivendi) or doing fancy package customization stuff. This aims to be brutally simple so that new users can inspect it and try it out.
 I'd love to get some feedback. Feel free to leave comments here or on the SourceHut issue tracker.
 (There is also a GitHub mirror if SourceHut doesn't work for you for some reason.)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Happy New Year!
 SimpleX Chat is developed in Haskell - without huge support from Haskell community and help from u/angerman it would not be possible.
 We will be hiring soon – let me know if you are interested!
 Some Haskell-specific challenges we need to solve:
  
reliability/security of Cryptonite
 memory leaks in networking stack
 compilation for the web
 and many more!
  
Version 4.4 added:
  
disappearing messages – the most frequent request from the users. To use them both conversation parties should agree to it, unlike in most other messengers that allow to send disappearing messages without recipients' agreement.
 connection security code verification – it allows to confirm that the connection keys/addresses were not substituted (man-in-the-middle attack).
 "live" messages – they update to all recipients as you type them, every several seconds.
 French language interface - thanks to users community and Weblate!
  
See more details in this post and download the apps via the links here.
 Please ask any questions about SimpleX Chat in the comments! Some common questions:
 Why user IDs are bad for privacy?
 How SimpleX delivers messages without user profile IDs?
 How SimpleX is different from Session, Matrix, Signal, etc.?

 A couple weeks ago I started building my own using conduit-audio and the Haskell wrapper for the WebRTC VAD, and the OpenAI Whisper model.
 https://gitlab.com/ludflu/vad-audio
 I'm getting ready to package it up and upload to hackage. Besides adding a demo video & unit tests, are there any recommended changes people have that would make adoption/contributions easier?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, I am using emacs 24.4.1 on a virtual machine on which I cannot install any additional packages so my configuration is very simple. I often have to work with very large files, a few hundred Megabytes and I find isearch to be really really slow to the point it is unusable. The files are opened with Fundamental mode, I tried disabling the Hi minor mode, I also tried to set the lazy-highlight variable to nil from a post I found on the internet as suggestion to speed isearch up, but there is no noticeable change. When searching the same files with vim/gvim the search is super fast and I am able to quickly jump through the file and find all patterns matching the string. Why is there such a huge difference between emacs and vim search? Is there a way to speed up emacs when working with big files?

 R1: h k p = snd p > k
 R2: filter _ [] = []
 R3: filter p (x:xs) = if p x then x:ys else ys
 where
 ys = Main.filter p xs
 ​
 R4: zip [] _ = []
 R5: zip _ [] = []
 R6: zip (x:xs) (y:ys) = (x,y) : Main.zip xs ys
 R7: zip _ _ = error "ouch!!"
 ​
 When I call it with " Main.filter (h '3') (Main.zip (error "ERR":"1") ['a'..]) " i have an error. 
 I get the error that I pass to the map function. Execution returns the "ERR" error because it compiles: R2 -> R3 which brings me to R4 because there is "if p x". And I am interested in what is inside the map, so I go to R4 (fail matching pattern), R5 (fail matching pattern), R6 and inside R6 I find the error as x. 
 Is the execution correct?
 Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to write my own helm source that is alist. I'm looking at the documentation here https://wikemacs.org/wiki/How_to_write_helm_extensions#Separate_candidates.27_sets_for_searching_and_for_actions
 but it does not work for me. The differences in my case are:
  
I'm using function instead of static set. The function returns alist as in the example, but I receive/can get only the car of the selected item, don't see the alist
 I'm using helm-comp-read, if this makes any difference
  
The docstring says
  
- COLLECTION can be a list, alist, vector, obarray or hash-table. 
 For alists and hash-tables their car are use as real value of 
 candidate unless ALISTP is non-nil. 
 It can be also a function that receives three arguments: 
 the values string, predicate and t. See `all-completions' for more details.
  
looking at `all-completions` docstring does not make it clearer to me.
 edit:
 `helm-comp-read-get-candidates` has hint:
  
ALISTP when non--nil will not use `all-completions' to collect 
 candidates because it doesn't handle alists correctly for helm. 
 i.e In `all-completions' the car of each pair is used as value. 
 In helm we want to use the cdr instead like (display . real), 
 so we return the alist as it is with no transformation by 
 `all-completions'.

  com.wbillingsley %%% veautiful % 0.3-M5 
  com.wbillingsley %%% doctacular % 0.3-M5 
 The highlight for this one is probably moving the little router from the "templates" package into core (and adding some documentation) so that there is a little router included in the vanilla version. The syntax for the d3-like component has also been improved, along with a few other tweaks
 Release notes here https://github.com/wbillingsley/veautiful/releases/tag/v0.3-M5
 0.3-M6 is likely to be out soon (at least before the 18th). That one might also get called "0.3.0".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sometimes it is annoying to wait for emacs to send a larger email (potentially over a slower connection). Using async it is possible to send email asynchronously, but you may loose your email if something goes wrong. Emacs now has built-in support for sqlite which can be used as a safe and simple mechanism (sqlite supports accessing a DB using multiple processes) for inter-process communication between the main emacs process and the emacs process that async spawns and to persistently store emails to be send and errors that occur during sending. This also enables retrying to send an email that failed to be send. Furthermore, for queued emails we can flush them in parallel. 
 I've now put this into a package on github that tries to load mu4e, but does not fail if the user is not using mu4e, but gnus. This should work on Emacs 29 (sqlite support) for any email client that uses the gnus and smtpmail functions to send email. However, since this queues emails in sqlite anything that displays queue sizes would have to be adviced to use async-email-sending--num-queued-emails instead.

 (setq-default py-split-window-on-execute nil)
 in my dotemacs. I'm keeping the post for anyone else who finds this.
 Using 't' instead of 'nil' would create a new window, but only if the relevant window wasn't already up.
 __________________________________________
 ORIGINAL:
 I tend to code by having a python shell in one window, and the code in the other window, typically with a vertical divider between them. If I choose a region in the code window, and run py-execute-region ("C-c |"), it's insanely annoying that a new window gets created each time, below the two existing windows, with the same code buffer in it.
 How do I save my sanity? Expected operation would be that the region gets executed in the python buffer, without creating any new windows.
 I'm not sure if I'm using python-mode.el or python.el. Is there any easy way to tell? Is there an easy way to choose one or the other at runtime? I don't see any python-mode.el in my dotemacs, I'm not sure where any non-default version would be loaded.
 I'm running Emacs 25.2.2.
 I found this but wasn't able to solve the problem, sharing it as a starting point for anyone else: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24119221/customize-window-splitting-in-emacs-python-mode

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Greetings fellow Haskellers,
 I've decided 2023 is the year I'm going to learn and become productive in Haskell. I installed everything I think I need through GHCup. I can make my own projects with `stack new` and everything works _okay_. HLS seems to need restarts from time to time, though. But in any case, I am working through Haskell in Depth and I can't really work with the example repo at all. When I open the directory in VSCode, I get this fairly inscrutable error at the top of any file I open:
 <command line>: cannot satisfy -package z-hid-examples-z-contexts (use -v for more information) 
 Any call to \`stack build\` fails with a bunch of constraint violations. The output appears to be complaining about which GHC I am using. In short, I am wondering whether there is any up-to-date, authoritative guide I can follow to fix my configuration so I can work through this stuff. Examples on the web seem to be mostly a bit old and piecemeal.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've used TickTick for years but it's bloated in comparison to what I've seen with the Orgzly app on Android. I'm a non-coder. Do you think I'm going to run into problems using this app for task and project management without having coding knowledge? I also was wondering if there is a way to embed Orgzly into Notion. Eventually I'd like to learn something like Org Mode but for the time being I'm going to use Notion due to life being busy.

While I was never able to get it working well for me I kept checking in on it because I so wanted faster latex previews in org. This morning I found that Karthink had a new repo org-preview which is amazing. It is super fast, worked for me out of the box, and centers display math! Plus it works with org-fragtog which I also love. 
 Repo says its still in very early development (seems to only be a week or so old) but figured I would share my enthusiasm about it. 
 (Thank you u/karthink!)

 The following code works, but I'm wondering if there is a way to filter out the composite numbers without unfreezing the vector. My attempt to do so using forM and guard didn't compile.
 Signature of primesUpTo is determined by the exercise and can't be modified.

        <updated>2023-01-01T22:24:23.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently discovered that the xdg-basedir library on Hackage only covered a very limited part of the XDG Basedir Specification, namely just reading the environment variables and returning paths for directories and files, and only for the categories or config, data and cache.
 But the XDG Basedir is so much more!
 First, there are other categories, state and runtime. Second, there's a whole logic to what files should be read: either you want to read only one file, and the application should try each directory for the category and give you the content of the first file that is available, or you want all available files merged together. Also, relative paths in the environment variables should be ignored.
 So I created xdg-basedir-compliant. It was fun to create because thanks to Polysemy, I could easily do TDD with non-IO interpreters.
 I hope the API is practical. I do hope people will use the library and I would very much welcome feedback on its use!

Right now it only supports Texas hold'em. I won't go too much into the rules of poker, nor does it matter much, but say you have 2 cards and you want to calculate the odds of winning against any two cards.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey ... and happy New Year. Instead of going to an all night party this year I opted to release another update video about Game :: Dangerous, a game engine written in Haskell that I've been working on since August 2015. Since I last posted about it I've migrated the project to Haskell Stack and GHC 9.x, so the newer hybrid garbage collector is now utilised (and should bring noticeable performance improvements). In this video I explain a bit about the map development server I'm working on and give a brief demonstration.
 Following feedback from the community I've done a fair bit of refactoring. The code will probably still look pretty crazy in places but I've tried to tame the worst of the craziness somewhat. If anyone wants to give feedback I'd be interested in what you think of the recursive control structure in module HandleInput. Anyway, take it easy.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[10 years ago I learned that no, I couldn't just "skip learning about Git" and use timestamped zip files instead just because I'm only 1 developer. This shouldn't surprise anyone here. The benefits of Git speak for themselves, even for just 1 developer.
 Today, I had a strange experience. For a while I've believed that if you're just 1 developer, only cabal is enough. However I came across a concrete use case where it's not enough! Here's what happened:
  
I wanted to checkout an old commit of my personal project and run it.
 BOOM. Everything went out of whack because another personal project on my local machine was now at the wrong commit! These two different projects were no longer in sync!
  
My friends. Doesn't this prove the necessity of Nix, even for 1 developer? Just wanted to confirm with you before I go any further.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm new to emacs, I decided to go with doom emacs to get something sort of ready made. But I just don't understand why my copy paste commands are so messed up. And they don't work either. I used F10 to get a visual on what the commands where supposed to be, since C-w, M-w and C-y did nothing. I don't understand what S-delete means, shift-S-delete? Doesn't work. And I note M-w is the normal key binding but it does not work either.
 If I turn on CUA mode and use C-x / C-c / C-v then it works with key commands, otherwise nothing really works. Incredibly frustrating. I was trying to get used to the normal emacs commands but turns out they where not even there. Might there be some addon in doom emacs causing this?

Life is experienced moment-to-moment, like an old fashioned tickertape.  This is how we receive information.  Reading, lectures, podcasts, speeches, these are sequences of words.  Music is sequences of sounds.  Movies are sequences of pictures.  All of these represent bits of information that come in one at a [[time]].
Similarly, reasoning seems to be a series of logical steps that take us from idea to idea to idea until we reach a conclusion.
In contrast, our [[brain]]s seem to operate as an interlinking network.  At the lowest level it's a web of interconnected synapses.  At a higher level our thoughts seem like a web of associations, similar to a [[mind map]].
Question: Since our experiences are sequential, but the organization of our thoughts is more of a network or web of associations, how to we integrate these concepts?

 ​
 Why it can't be

 I have installed tree-sitter cli from rust cargo, but when I try to call it from eshell, it said it cannot find the executable. It's fine in the iTerm2.
 I have installed package exec-path-from-shell to copy shell's environment PATH for Emacs to use.
 And I have checked the $PATH in the eshell which contains cargo binary directory and I can call tree-sitter cli using the absolute path.
 Any idea why eshell cannot find the executable? (I have also tried to add the directory to 'exec-path but it still cannot find it.

Understanding the content of a text and absorbing the knowledge present in it only happens during the active stage of reading, which is taking notes and writing about the ideas that the text presents. In a passive reading, where the text is just read, the information is retained for a much smaller amount and time, in addition to the fact that the main ideas are not worked through the reader's knowledge.

Annotations allow ideas to flow and solidify in the reader's mind, allowing them to retain longer and be able to question them to lead to new questions and answers. Writing allows the connections of ideas to be transmitted in words to paper or document so that others can read, understand and process these ideas so that new connections are established.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone! 
 Can someone please explain to me how I can "style" a (custom or built in) link properly? 
 What I want to achieve is basically some similar look, to what you can do with e.g. the :before element in CSS, where you e.g. display a little link icon in front the actual link.
 The icons can come from a font like e.g. Fontawesome and/or svg source.
 With the following code I managed to show an icon from all-the-icons, which I replaced with the letter M here for better readability. The problem with this is however, that it does not only change the word menu to an M inside the link only.
 (org-deflink menu "Style and export for menu links" [:face '(:box "gray60" :background "gray95" :foreground "purple")]) (setq prettify-symbols-alist '(("menu" . "M"))) (prettify-symbols-mode 1) 
 The plain text looks like:
 Plain Text
 and the "styled" version of that input looks like:
 Styled Text

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm getting to the point in working with my ZK that I have re-visited certain zettels several times - whether that is just to read the zettel or to "finish" it (if it was still in rough form, having the tag "#unfinished"), or to add information from new sources.  There could be numerous reasons.
My point, though, is that I don't always want to update (or "refactor") a zettel; sometimes I just want to (legitimately) expand it.  I've started adding dates to the new material and some zettels now appear as:
Date 1 (UUID) with original material.
Date 2 with new material.
Date 3 with even newer material.
This approach has an added advantage in that it allows me to see a progression in an idea - what did I write initially and what are my thoughts now?
Has anyone else implemented this practice?  If so, what is your experience with it?  Whether you have or not, do you see any potential benefits from doing this?  Any drawbacks?]]></summary>

For the 2D part it uses the gloss package which I built and ran without any problems. However, for the 3D part it uses the package not-gloss which seems to not be maintained anymore. When I try to build it using cabal I get the following error:

 I tried enable FlexibleContexts in my .cabal file but nothing changed. I am not sure where to go from here and any help would be greatly appreciated!

 I don't think eglot has the ability to show code lenses (unless I'm missing something obvious). So another package would have to take over, but I can't find one other than the ones integrated for lsp-mode.
 Has anyone been able to have some kind of code lens with eglot? I'm open to suggestions!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I tend to program with Rust/Ocaml/Python/PHP etc. But I just love the Haskell Language.
 The only thing that has been a deal killer for me so far has been laziness.
 Reading https://www.tweag.io/blog/2022-05-12-strict-vs-lazy/ further convinced me that laziness just causes too much grief.
 I am eager to write strict Haskell. I understand the the -XStrict and Unlifted datatypes help with this. Actually it is interesting that -XStrict does not really cut it, we need unlifted datatypes..
 However, I want to be able to use libraries and preludes that assume everything is strict and/or unlifted.
 Is it possible in 2022 to write Haskell as it if it was a strict language like, say, OCaml? However, where are the strict monad transformer libraries, strict by default preludes etc. Every notable library seems to be lazy...
 I like Purescript -- a dialect of Haskell that is pure and strict. However, Purescript does not have such a lively ecosystem, mature tooling etc. like Haskell.
 I would love to be writing Haskell with Purescript like semantics. Any suggestions?

 I seem to recall coming across a package that put coordinates into a property value and then could display the headings in a corkboard or desktop type view.
 It may have been a brainstorming package, or maybe a plotting package, but I can’t seem to find it, does anyone know of a package with a feature like this?

 I have created my own config from scratch after having used Doom briefly and Prelude extensively. This is working far better, and it's teaching me a lot.
 On a side note, I would really appreciate feedback into how this config can be improved, best practices, better choices, etc.
 See my config here: https://github.com/averageflow/dotfiles/tree/master/joeTumbleweedIKEADell/emacs
 I use a variety of packages, including consult, marginalia, vertico, corfu and orderless, use-package with straight.
 I love orderless, and when I manually enable it, works wonderful, but for some reason, it doesn't get properly activated in my setup (init.el) when following the documentation:
 (use-package orderless :custom (setq completion-styles '(orderless basic) completion-category-overrides '((file (styles basic partial-completion)))) ) 
 When I do (print completion-styles) it gives me just (basic). Somehow it gets overriden I think ?
 I've also tried to change that :custom by :config and to use the setq outside the use-package block, to no avail.
 So I have had to resort to
 (custom-set-variables '(completion-styles '(orderless basic)) ) 
 And this seems to work. But how can I / should I get rid of it this way? 
 Why doesn't it work in the use-package declaration? Thanks!

 So what databases are the most natural to use in Haskell?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi r/scala, I would like to ask if any of you have encountered this problem before
 While programming in Scala, whenever I encounter certain types of situations that would have thrown an exception while programming in Java don't seem to be throwing any exceptions in Scala.
 A very simple example that doesn't throw an exception for me is:
 val list = (0 to 5).toList println(list(10)) 
 Surely this should generate an IndexOutOfBoundsException?
 Another example:
 val mappy = Map("a" -> 5) println(mappy("b")) 
 This also does not throw any exceptions.
 My Scala version is 3.2.1, and my intellij version is IntelliJ IDEA Edu 2022.2.2 using the Scala plugin, and my project type is an SBT project generated by intellij, incase any of that is relevant.
 I have also tried messing with the intellij settings, turning on stuff like "prohibited exception thrown" since I saw online that something like that might help, but I haven't seen any changes yet. I'm thinking about trying to throw out my entire scala plugin & installs and try again from scratch, but I figured I'd ask here first.
 ​
 Thank you very much

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 Recently I posted how could I figure out the face variable for LSP breadcrumbs. I solved it.
 I hope the following is helpful.
 TL;DR
  
Even non-elisp hackers can understand elisp. Don't be intimidated.
 Thank you /u/CorysInTheHouse69 for the nudge.
  
Details
 /u/CorysInTheHouse69, politely, repeatedly mentioned I should consult the underlying code. They were right, that's the right approach. Even for a non-elisp hacker, one can see patterns!
 I found the pattern in the doom theme (doom-themes-base.el) base code and saw the line (header-line :inherit 'mode-line) That is, the header line is matching my mode line. That's not what I wanted! Boom!
 Walking up the code, I see the following comment:
 ;;; Code: ;; These are used as a basis for every Doom theme defined with `def-doom-theme', ;; as a set of reasonble defaults. They are intended to be overidden where it ;; makes sense to. 
 operative word overridden!
 In my init.el I override (header-line and now, I have what I want. \o/
 Here's an example of my unit test:
 (custom-set-faces ;; custom-set-faces was added by Custom. ;; If you edit it by hand, you could mess it up, so be careful. ;; Your init file should contain only one such instance. ;; If there is more than one, they won't work right. ... '(header-line ((t (:background "blue" :foreground "black")))) ...) 
 Go forth and hack!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[https://github.com/anticomputer/age.el
 Since I'm starting to purge gpg out of my life, but do depend on it heavily for keeping my org notes and authinfo encrypted, I needed an epa/epg-style transparent encryption support for age (https://github.com/FiloSottile/age). As such I ported the relevant epa/epg code and reworked it to work with age. 
 age.el provides transparent encryption and decryption support for .age files in Emacs, much like epa/epg support .gpg files. That means you can do all the things with .age files you're used to doing with .gpg files in Emacs now.
 Like most of my packages, this is mostly written to support my personal use cases, but I've seen some other folks mention that they wanted to start using age over gpg, so have a look if this seems useful to you.

 Main changes from 0.9.12:
  
Implemented support for returning clause inside an async block: https://rssh.github.io/dotty-cps-async/ReturningClause.html
 Few bug fixes and workarounds against the 3.2.1 compiler behavior.
  
Also, support for probability monad (https://github.com/jliszka/probability-monad ) is added to cps-async-connect. Now it is possible to do probabilistic programming in scala with direct style: https://github.com/rssh/cps-async-connect/blob/master/probability-monad/src/test/scala/cps/monads/probability/ProbabilityExamplesSuite.scala )

 I use defvar declarations in order not to get assignment to free variable errors and I wouldn't want the existing values to be reset.
 I can't find the exact post where I read this but if this is what I think it means it may cause me some problems.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I decided to upgrade to ghc 9.2.5 now that hls 1.9.0.0 is out, however I'm having an extremely difficult time figuring out what exactly I need to change in my current project to make it work. 
 The project builds correctly when I have 8.10.7 set as default with ghcup as well as when I swap back to it after trying to get 9.2.5 to work. When I set the default to 9.2.5 and start VSCode with the project folder, hls errors and says that it can't determine what compiler version should be used, which is fair I guess, but again I have no idea what I need to change because there isn't any information in the .cabal file about what compiler version to use.
 When I try to build the project, I get this error
 cabal-3.6.2.0.exe: ghc-pkg dump failed: dieVerbatim: user error (cabal-3.6.2.0.exe: 'C:\ghcup\bin\ghc-pkg.exe' exited with an error: ghc-pkg-9.2.5.exe: C:\\cabal\\store\\ghc-9.2.5\\package.db\package.cache: withBinaryFile: inappropriate type (not enough bytes) 
 and almost all of the solutions/advice I've been able to find online for dealing with that have to do with stack which I'm not using. The one that wasn't about stack said to delete the project folder and clone it again from github but doing that didn't work.
 Any help would be deeply appreciated. If the solution is to just uninstall everything including ghcup and reinstall with only 9.2.5, is there something I should change about the .cabal file in the project before I do that to make sure it works correctly after reinstalling?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I know that the *> operator is pronounced as "then". For example, Just 10 *> Just 20 would be read as "just 10 then just 20". However, I couldn't find a definitive source on how to pronounce the <* operator. Personally, I've been pronouncing it as "after". For example, Just 10 <* Just 20 would be read as "just 10 after just 20". But, I'm not satisfied with the semantics of this pronunciation. It doesn't match the meaning of the <* operator. How do you pronounce the <* operator?
 Edit: The reason I want to know this is because I want to implement these operators in an object-oriented language. So, Just 10 *> Just 20 would become Just(10).then(Just(20)). Similarly, I want a name for Just 10 <* Just 20. Hence, not pronouncing them or using the same name to pronounce them is not an option.

 I have a long persisting issue I'd rather get rid of if anyone can point me in the right direction. When I first start Emacs (whether directly or as a client) my screen is extremely compressed (screenshot below). If I reload configuration it displays normally.
 I am currently on 28.2 but this has persisted from 27.x. You can probably just make out in the screenshot that this is Doom emacs just in case that has any relevance.
 Here is the screenshot:

 Searches do not yield any help that I've found and I'm honestly not sure where to look.
 Thanks in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi.
 Is there an emacs distribution, which upon startup would present itself as a full-featured organizer?
 What I'm looking for is something opinionated, not necessarily easily configurable even, but something that works and does the job¹ out of the box.
 ¹ the job I define as something done by conventional organizers (todoist, ticktick), namely:
 - manage todo tasks
 - attach text notes to tasks
 - set date on tasks
 - set tags on tasks
 - agenda view
 - calendar view
 - maybe something like org-gcal?
 - preferably evil mode
 I'm willing to invest only minimal effort into learning this opinionated way of using org-mode. I'm not interested in the endless feature-set emacs can offer. I may decide to tinker with the setup later. But I don't want to do all the learning upfront.
 Does a distribution like this exist?

It's unclear to me how to productively capture this framework & begin developing out within my Zettelkasten.  I've kept my ZK for ~6 months now, so I'm familiar with the framework (both from notes workflow & ideas workflow perspectives).
Currently, I'm considering this method:
Create a note that contains the flowchart itself.
Branch off of this note by creating a new note for each Phase & each document.
Dive into the methodologies & techniques required at each Phase from there.
Am I on the right track?  Is there anything obvious that I'm missing here?]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So for my previous year, I used LibreOffice Writer which sufficed well enough for using symbols as well as sub and super script but since then I’ve discovered my dearest Doom Emacs and kinda fell in love with Org Mode; y’know how the story goes. My current problem mostly is I’d really love to use Org Mode for my Math Notes but I don’t know how to insert symbols or structure things like larger division statements, or anything with how to insert functions.
 I’ve heard things about LaTeX being the optimal way to get this done; seemingly Emacs should have some integration with this but I don’t entirely know where to start with that and I don’t actually know a thing about LaTeX so I was wondering if anyone could offer me guidance on how to achieve the optimal note-taking Emacs setup, and just how you lovely lads would go about this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a little puzzle for the Haskell community.
 Lately I've been experimenting with tagless final encodings (or object algebras in other languages) to build ASTs where previously I would have used a recursive ADT.
 This works great if you have a simple untyped AST. New terms can be added to the AST by adding a new typeclass that extends the base one. 
 However, what you have an AST presented with a GADT, with the types of your language encoded as a data-kinded parameter? You can still encode your AST in a tagless final way by using a higher-kinded type as the carrier, and this (as before) let's us extend the terms of the language, but what if we want to extend the types?
 For instance, if we have a base AST for a simply typed lambda calculus, and we want to add products, we need both a new type constructor, and some new terms of our AST itself.
 Yet (as far as I know), it's not possible to use something like a tagless final encoding at the type level.
 Has anyone thought about solving this kind of problem? My only thought was that this might be easier to do in something like Agda or Idris, but I'm curious what a solution to this in Haskell might look like.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I tried to write a function that calculate log safely (exercise in Haskell Wikibook). Here's what I came up with:
 safeLog :: (Floating a, Ord a) => a -> Maybe a safeLog x = log x <$ guard (x > 0) 
 Then I tried to rewrite it in point-free style. After some tinkering, I came up with this version:
 safeLog :: (Floating a, Ord a) => a -> Maybe a safeLog = ap ((<$) . log) (guard . (> 0)) 
 The function works correctly; however, I don't understand how it works (specifically the concrete type of ap). Haskell language server showed that the concrete type of ap is:
 _ :: (a -> Maybe () -> Maybe a) -> (a -> Maybe ()) -> a -> Maybe a 
 The generalized type of ap is:
 forall (m :: * -> *) a b. Monad m => m (a -> b) -> m a -> m b 
 As I understand it, ap requires a function, a type a and b all wrapped in Monad m. For example, if I have this function:
 foo = ap (Just (+ 1)) (Just 2) 
 I understand that the concrete type of Monad m here is Maybe, and the concrete type of a and b is Integer. i.e.:
 _ :: Maybe (Integer -> Integer) -> Maybe Integer -> Maybe Integer 
 But in the case of ap inside safeLog:
 _ :: (a -> Maybe () -> Maybe a) -> (a -> Maybe ()) -> a -> Maybe a 
 I cannot figure out what is the concrete type of Monad m, a and b.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm reading about arrays (Data.Array). 1D array construction is easy.  a = listArray (4, 8) [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]  creates an array with minimum index 4, maximum index 8, a ! 4 = 2, and so on.
 But I came across the following code for constructing a 2D array, and having a hard time understanding it.  xss = [ [9, 8, 7] , [5, 3, 2] , [6, 6, 7] ] matrix = listArray ((1, 1), (3, 3)) (concat xss) 
 What is the (1, 1) for? I can see how nine integers can be split into 3 rows and 3 columns without needing the (1, 1).
 The only material even discussing 2D array type is this, and sadly it doesn't answer my question.

 I have a use case where I'd like to link an image inside an org document for viewing inline, but would also like it to be suppressed upon export to PDF. 
 I'm aware of two solutions that are unsatisfactory: linking the image in a #+begin_comment #+end_comment block, or adding the image under a subheading with the :noexport: tag.
 The first is not enough since placing an image link inside a comment block prevents org recognizing it to be viewed inline, while the second is unsatisfactory because it would mess with the formatting of the document. I.e. I would have to escape the noexport subheading for every image (I confess I don't know how to do this if there is a method). Is there any way to get the desired behavior?

 This is my MWE:
 #+title: Testing org-cite \LaTeX export #+latex_header: \usepackage{natbib} #+bibliography: r4h2o.bib #+options: toc:nil #+cite_export: natbib Hello World! This is a citation: [cite:@alghamdi_2022_clas] #+print_bibliography: +end_export 
 I get an error message: "Unknown processor natbib"
 Exporting with the basic exporter works fine. CSL is also problematic.
 The Org Mode manual is a bit cryptic on this functionality.
 Anyone can help fixing this issue?
 P.S: I used a clean Emacs instance (emacs -q), no config.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Edit: Apologies for posting in this sub, as it is only partly Haskell-related. I'm not sure where else to discuss such things.
 One of my interests in programming is the analysis of techniques used to employ better coding practices. For example, in OOP you have design patterns that adhere to design principles such as SOLID. To further the example, you can design a factory with SOLID practices considered to create code that is "clean", allowing for code reusability, and flexibility. In short, with minimal code smell.
 I am currently reading Refactoring - Improving the Design of Existing Code by Martin Fowler to get a better understanding of things I've come to learn from practice and experience in a more well-presented context.
 I am wondering if some similar texts or resources focus on the functional style of code refactoring and reusability. I understand that many topics and techniques are simple enough to work in all contexts, but I also know that FP languages have their smells and without getting various kinds of experience (which may be difficult to do), I was hoping that I can learn of such topics.
 FP is naturally an abstract paradigm, going miles more than most OOP languages, and I want to be able to strongly analyse such topics in depth. I have moderate experience with Haskell, but due to university studies and life, I don't have the opportunity to focus more effort than I do, learning the various libraries and tools available to build a repertoire of skills from applied experience.
 Thank you very much

Configured direnv and my .bashrc as normal.
 Configured nix-direnv on NixOS by modifying configuration.nix as normal.
 Configured emacs' configuration for emacs-direnv as normal.
  
Now consider I have:
  
Make some directory /tmp/xyz, made a shell.nix or flake.nix file, and done either echo "use nix" >> .envrc && direnv allow or echo "use flake" >> .envrc && direnv allow as appropriate.
  
Then, every time I open a file, emacs-direnv direnvs in its direnv way, successfully, much to my happiness. I vterm and cd to my file and direnv also direnvs successfully.
 Let us now say I do M-x cd /tmp/xyz, wherein I have stored some .envrc and shell.nix (or flake.nix or whatever) files. Opening a file direnvs successfully. However, opening a vterm sometimes does nothing, whereupon I must first cd out of my directory and cd back into my directory.
 For some reason this happens inconsistently. Does anyone else have this problem? It seems only to occur with flake.nix files and not shell.nix files.

 My current setup is Linux + neovim (using the built in LSP) + GHC 9.2.5 + cabal 3.6.2.0 + HLS 1.9.0.0 + stack 2.7.3.
 The issue that I'm having is that while I'm in my editor, HLS will not show me compiler warnings. Other than that HLS pretty works entirely fine, I'm getting hlint hints, I can rename variables, jump to definitions, and I get code completions etc. Just no compiler warnings.
 I have verified that the server is running, and that my editor is connecting properly. I have an explicit hie.yaml. I am having this issue on all of the Haskell code I open. I have used GHCup to reinstall and build HLS from source. At this point I am at a dead end, so any leads would be greatly appreciated.

 Is there a way to make certain abbreviations straightforward, without the use of extra keys? Here's an approximation: ``` (defun abbrev-or-insert () (interactive) (self-insert-command 1) (expand-abbrev))
 (define-abbrev-table 'global-abbrev-table '( ("HH" "---~" nil :case-fixed t :count 0) ("LL" "\ldots{}" nil :case-fixed t :count 0) ("ДД" "\ldots{}" nil :case-fixed t :count 0) ))
 (global-set-key (kbd "Д") 'abbrev-or-insert) (global-set-key (kbd "H") 'abbrev-or-insert) (global-set-key (kbd "L") 'abbrev-or-insert)  It works as desired; well, almost:  \ldots{}\ldots{}арпДД \ldots{}\ldots{} \ldots{}abaLL \ldots{}\ldots{}booLL ``` Somehow, any input after the expansion of the abbreviation is disruptive. It takes a space to make it work again. Is there a way to get rid of that space?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As far as I know there is no way to implement a mutual (or "duplicate") constructor for two different data types in Haskell.
 For example, this hypothetical code will not work:
 ```haskell data family Prim data family (a ~~> b)
 data instance Prim where Lit :: Int -> Prim
 data instance a ~~> b where Plus :: Prim ~~> Prim ~~> Prim
 -- A hypothetical data instance where either t is Prim, OR, t is (a > b) data instance (t ~ Prim | t ~ (a ~~> b)) => t where -- Apply is a mutual constructor for both Prim and (>), -- The result type depends on the type of the first constructor argument Apply :: (x ~~> t) -> x -> t ```
 The best alternative I can come up with is 
 ```haskell data Prim where Lit :: Int -> Prim CastToPrim :: Apply Prim -> Prim -- "UnApply" the type constructor, so to speak
 data a ~~> b where Plus :: Prim ~~> Prim ~~> Prim CastToArrow :: Apply (a ~~> b) -> (a ~~> b)
 data Apply t where Apply :: (x ~~> t) -> x -> Apply t ```
 Possibly with some pattern synonyms for convenience... (but this doesn't help much) 
 ```haskell pattern ApplyPartial f x = CastToArrow (Apply f x) pattern ApplyFinal f x = CastToPrim (Apply f x)
 two :: Prim two = ApplyFinal (ApplyPartial Plus (Lit 1)) (Lit 2) ```
 I was wondering if anyone has alternative ideas for this sort of thing (or knows of examples in other languages).

 Let me say up front: I do not have a job to offer, and am not even in a position to do so. But I would like to gauge potential interest in working professionally with Haskell in the company where I am employed. They currently develop mainly in .Net, C#, but a couple of years ago I was allowed to build a backend application in F# with a small team (kind of as a compromise for developing in a functional programming language but still using the .Net framework).
 For performance reasons, maintainability and ease of bug fixing, I recently suggested we look into migrating that application to Haskell. But with me being the only person currently who knows the language, my manager sees the low bus factor as a (very understandable) risk.
 We don't want to post a vacancy for Haskell developers at the moment, as a decision to use the language has not been made. But I would like to show by numbers how many developers we could potentially attract /if/ we were to do so. Or at least: how many people would be interested in working with Haskell in our reasonably direct surroundings.
 So my question is: are you, or do you know, a developer in the province of Limburg in The Netherlands, who would be interested in working with Haskell professionally? Or is there a better place to ask this question? If you don't want to disclose your location publicly in this subreddit, you can always DM me, of course.
 If nothing else, we might just find out how many we are, and could form a local user group out of this.
 Thanks for your time reading this!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[i wanted to try effectful however it doesn't have integration with haskell gi and i do not want to use IO in all my code, so i am creating an effect for haskell gi. 
 Upon starting doing so i noticed a pattern when wrapping a monadic function, it has the same type with some changes ,in the context instead of MonadIO it has GI :> es and the return type is Eff es a instead of m a , and in the term level it is also simple it uses all arguments from the original calls the original and then unsafeEff_s it like so function a b c = unsafeEff_ $ Original.function a b c. 
 Naturally i tried to automate it as this is quite simple in pseudocode, i first thought
 about using typefamilies and functions however although i probably could do a lifting function i can't create new top-level declarations with only typefamilies so i tried to use some template haskell.
 However traversing a template haskell syntax tree is absolute hell, i tried to combine it with typefamilies to generate the types more comfortably and it mostly worked until i needed to do the pattern for the clause, to apply the type families i would need a splice to turn my syntax tree in types, however i can't splice from the same module so i gave up on template haskell if there isn't an alternative i probably will come back eventually but i absolutely hated the experience.
 i hated the experience so much that i am considering forking haskell gi to create the functions already wrapped

 And just to narrow down the discussion, I'm looking just into the text editing part. The whole kitchen sink thing is not my vibe.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I love vterm 99% of the time, but there are a few things that are annoying
 - If I need to use brew install, I can't do it in emacs. It just says `brew not found`. So I have to switch into iterm and then brew install from there. I don't use brew much at all, but when I need it it's annoying that vterm or any of emacs' shell tools can't find it. 
 - Vterm doesn't have access to the kill ring. If I try to M-y anything from the kill ring vterm says `Buffer is read only`, which it certainly isn't. 
 - Using the universal modifier to include a string of digits doesn't work: C-u 12 C-u 0 should insert 12 "0"s, but it just inserts 1. 
 There are other gripes but these are the three top of mind. I'm not sure if there's something I'm missing about vterm, but I can't find any way to correct these issues which frustrates me since I'm now so used to everything working seamlessly everywhere else. If anyone has ideas for solutions to these problems, I'm all ears :)

There is a lisp package: https://github.com/dvush/cl-secp256k1 which provides the ability to create keys and sign messages. I would like to be able to define some functions in my elisp file that would call certain methods from this package, say to create a private key. My question is really how to do this... is it even worth doing it this way, or just force the user to install a C implementation of the package and then get elisp to run that.

 You guys have probably gotten tons of people asking this same question but I'm gonna ask once more, since no matter what example I'm using it always loses me. 
 Running a simple expression as the one above gives me a parse error everytime. I've used different example expressions as this one, mostly ones from Philipp Hagenlocher's Haskell for Imperative Programmers tutorial. It's an excellent tutorial, but the examples from the tutorials always give me compile errors about common syntax like '=' sign & the '|' sign. Most commonly, I get this error: 
 Main.hs:6:28: error: parse error on input ‘=’ Perhaps you need a 'let' in a 'do' block? e.g. 'let x = 5' instead of 'x = 5' 
 I've tried different examples outside the tutorial, some stack overflow corrections of other people's code who've had similar errors to me. There was only one time where I did NOT get a parse error on compile time. Everything else has been a parse error on '=', '|' or something else. Why does the compiler punish me for using simple syntax like this? Is this a software issue I'm having or am I really doing something wrong? Cuz this is driving me nuts.

 Is there a way to get the face variable without inspecting the underlying elisp code?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My comment:
The issue of creating fiction into the system is that you deligate an ability to an external system that can and should be a skill of the person, you prevent the development of this skill. That decreases or perhaps even inhibits the training effect working with a ZK has or could have.
Folgezettel is a very valid and perhaps necessary technique that makes working as if you have a project you are working on. However, the most important counter-argument against the validity of Folgezettel is that you can achieve this with a better technique which is the structure note. Folgezettel allows to code for two different directions: lateral and horizontal. That means that you can't map meaning on Folgezettel or are limited to two (or four if you count the opposite directions) categories of meaning. Structure notes on the other hand allow for as much of connection as you are able to produce on the canvas you use. What would been a cluster of Folgezettel can be a single drawn image on a Structure Note. Even when using a analog Zettelkaten my recommendation is the heavy use of Structure Notes since they pull together thoughts and their relationships on one single canvas.
In theory, the "good enough relations" are awesome. But in practice, from what I see, the good enough is mostly an in the moment idiosyncratic idea that you will forget in the future. When the future is now, many people have quite some difficulties to understand the relation or to see a relation at all. That is intrinsic to the concept of "most what you produce is garbage". This includes the connections, direct and via Folgezettel. If you actually make it a point to get a grasp on the nature of connection you'll build more robust (even antifragile) edges in your network.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Currently working on an assignment and struggling a bit with my runtime analysis.
  data GTree a = GNil | GNode a [GTree a] deriving Show testGTree :: (Num a) => GTree a testGTree = GNode 4 [GNode 5 [GNode 3 [], GNode 51 []], GNode 6 [GNode 10 []], GNode 7 [GNode 12 [GNode 4124 []]]] postOrderG :: GTree a -> [a] postOrderG (GNode x []) = [x] postOrderG (GNode a (t:ts)) = postOrderG t ++ help ts ++ [a] where help [] = [] help ts = help (drop 1 ts) ++ postOrderG (head ts) 
 As you can see the function is supposed to traverse a tree with any number of children in postorder (which it hopefully does). Im struggling how i can get a O Notation. I thought id calculate with each node having a set number of children m (which is the max number of children in the tree) as a worst case. But how do I deal with the subfunction help calling on the main function (postOrderG (head ts))?
 postOrderG t runs with c' (c = runtime of postOrderG (GNode x []) = [x]) + runtime of help rest of list + runtime of postorder first child. But now we have postorder again ! 
 I dont want the answer but any tips would be welcome! And oc happy christmas to you all.
