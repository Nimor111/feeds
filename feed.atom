        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With every start of Emacs 29, native comp starts compiling the files cl-loaddefs.el and tramp-loaddefs.el, but I can't find corresponding *.eln files in (all) native-lisp directories. (Native compiling other (internal & extra) packages works, it is not an issue with access rights.)
 What is the use of that behavior?
 I could disable that native jit compiling, by putting following line in my early-init.el
 (setq native-comp-jit-compilation-deny-list '(".*-loaddefs.el.gz")) 
 Would that break some facilities within Emacs, if I do so?

Vertico, however, didn't include execute-extended-command as a repeatable session by default. You can be seen it by examining vertico-repeat-filter variable. So I have to customize it like this in Doom Emacs:
 ```elisp
 (after! vertico-repeat (setq vertico-repeat-filter (remove 'execute-extended-command vertico-repeat-filter))) ```
 The question is execute-extended-command seems to be a reasonable default completing session, why does vertico excludes it?

 I am a rust developer with a passion for cryptography, security and backend development. My first post is one about just that. 
 Since I'm not using a static site generator every time I create a new post I have to update the html of my homepage to include a link to that post but later on I'd like to add orgs sitemap functionality to handle that for me. If anyone has experience with elisp maybe you could help me write the function to do so.

 I've been digging around to see if there's a package for this but the closest I've found is expand-region and that's not quite it...
 Take the indent level and block at the line where the point currently sits and set the mark region to the end of the current block + indent level. I hope that explanation is clear.
 This seems very much in the wheelhouse of Emacs and I'm guessing it exists -- maybe even in core as opposed to a package -- and I'm just not looking in the right place.
 thx

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm considering switching from Gmail to Fastmail, not necessarily due to privacy concerns but because I'm bothered by the fact that I need extra hacks and additional settings on both the Gmail and Emacs side to use their service properly with mbsync and mu4e. Also, I have the impression that Google will complicate access to IMAP in the future. They're already starting with things like passkey. I might be talking nonsense, but that's how I see things. Not long ago, they started detecting ad blockers in the browser while browsing YouTube, so as a company, they can change whatever they want overnight.
 I want to emphasize that I don't have a lot of money to spare, and I'm taking this step more for my peace of mind, to make sure I won't have any issues in the future. However, I would still like to ask for your advice, are you satisfied with Fastmail, have you had any problems with their service while using Mu4e and Emacs?
 I've noticed that they also support a feature called 'masked mail' and an option to add additional emails. If, for example, I want to display an email address on my CV that isn't my primary address and I'd like to deactivate it at some point, would it be better to use the option to add a new address or the "masked mail" option instead? Also, this separate mail or masked mail need a separate Mu4e context?
 I would be grateful for any suggestions. Thank you.

I want to be able to run them within org-babel itself. I use mostly python and bash. I have two laptops one personal and one for work and a desktop. Mostly I want my laptop and desktop in sync so that I can work in either of them depending upon the need. When I want to install or update any of the tools I use in one system I want that to be replicated in the other, not automatically.
 I also need to version the literate scripts, in the sense with history visible in the org file itself. I want the org file to capture my thought flow and the evolution of the code so that I can understand it later by just looking through the file not by meddling with git.
 Does any have similar need and a workflow I can copy?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello Emacs Community!, 
 As everyone on this community, I'm an Emacs power user and have several niceties configured, gnus for Email, Doom Emacs, and I heavily use org mode, I recently used it for a 'Incident Playbook' which was basically making an incident and responding to it following certain steps, more of a Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR) work. 
 So, I made a server in Ansible, made a test malware that will be ran in this server (delete a log file idk), and proceeded to do everything directly in org-mode, running every command via tramp to the server, getting any info from the disk and getting a dd and such. Finally I made a whole document with full details on the server in that point in time, which was pretty interesting as I could have this as a template for future incidents and have certain commands saved for this.
 And I got the idea, wouldn't it be interesting to have org mode files like these but for testing specific vulnerabilities?, even using a tool like NixOS or Guix to make commands that will get the old version x.x.x of nginx and I could test a vulnerability there, so it is also reproducible and everyone can use the org file and test this vulnerability?, basically more of a study and proof of concept rather than something more 'heavy' as in business related.
 ​
 Does anyone have a similar use case?, I would love to hear for them as I want to go into the DFIR route.
 ​
 TLDR. Not specific to an emacs programming or library question, but much more of a broader question about a cybersecurity workflow.

 Still learning Emacs but happy with it so far. One thing i'm trying to find out is this. I'm OK with Emacs creating recovery files from which i can, well, recover my work after emacs is closed. However, if I save my files, I have no need for these #filename# or filename~ files that populate my folders. Is there a way to make emacs keep creating these recovery files, but deleting them if I *save* my actual files?

 There are no updates in "software update" except safari which I'm guessing will not help this.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are hiring! My team (Plutus Core at IOG) is looking for up to two compiler engineers. Plutus Core is a smart contract language for the Cardano blockchain.
 The main responsibility of the role is to work with a team of experienced engineers and researchers in designing and implementing missing features in Cardano smart contract languages, compilers and runtime systems, and writing documentation for users of the languages.
 We love statically typed functional languages, and we are committed to building a friendly, welcoming, and diverse community of Cardano smart contract developers.

Job posting: https://apply.workable.com/io-global/j/3F1AAE5F43/. Note that the Location section, which currently says "US only", is inaccurate, and I'm working to get it updated. We are certainly also hiring from Europe (in fact that would be preferred as most of the current team members reside in Europe, and most of the meetings occur in afternoons of European time), and we also have some flexibility to hire from other parts of the world.
 Codebase: https://github.com/input-output-hk/plutus. The main components include four languages (Plutus Tx, Plutus IR, Typed Plutus Core, Untyped Plutus Core), compilers from one to the next, the Untyped Plutus Core interpreter, and Agda formalization.
 Doc: https://plutus.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html

 I use orgmode links extensively. In particular, I have hundreds (our thousands) of links to emails (in notmuch). I would very much like to add a tag to any email that is being referenced from org.
 So, what I need to do first is be able to find all matches of a regular expression in all my org files. Non-interactively.
 I have been playing around with xref-matches-in-directory but that would not cover when multiple emails are mentioned in the same line...
 I have been looking and looking but everything I find missed the non-interactive part. 
 So: What is the function to "search for this REGEX in FILES in DIR and return the first capture group"? (the regex has a capture group for the msgid)
 The regex:  (rx-to-string (rx "notmuch:id:" (group (1+ (not "]")))))

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[hi everyone, I am working in IT support, and occur (and even more multi-occur-in-matching-buffer) ist my tool of choice.
 But I would like it to do more (because why not?) I would like to be able to ignore matches, if terms (let's name them excludees) are found in the next 5 lines from the search string match or within a number of lines defined by a variable.
 It would allow to save excludees as a list, and ignore certain matches when for instance the "ERROR" relates to a known bug, and we do not want to see it in occur searches any longer.
 Ideally, this could be triggered by a keymap in occur-mode-map, (toggle-ignore-excludees), so that it is up to the user to activate it or not.
 is there already a similar function that does it? How would you proceed to achieve this?
 thanks for your feedback

 I see that there are still frequent commits to the repo, but no release since May 2023. Releases were quite regular and frequent before that.
 Also, the docs seem inconsistent, switching versions from a page to another.
 I ask because I am considering a little side projet with zio, zio-http, zio-quill,... But I am wondering if the choice will stand the test of time. I am coming from Akka/pekko and I am doing this project also to learn zio and see if it is worth it.
 Thanks in advance ! ;)

So much so that I clearly wanted to start using Emacs as my window manager.
 I really like having a statusbar, so since I had been using dwm (also, if you want dwm-like window management, Edwina is the package for you), I figured it was finally time to set Polybar up. I did, but as many people experienced, Polybar had the issue of workspaces being off by one with the standard EMWH module. I looked around, and wasn't able to find the solution anywhere else, so I'll post my solution.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been using Rene's Sublimeless Zettelkasten for a few years, building up a note archive that uses datetime ID links. I think The Archive follows the same convention.
For example, if I create a note called "Test note" now, the text file will have the name 202310191918 Test note.md, and the link inside the software will look like this: [[202310191918]] Test note.
It would be interesting to try an alternative app/software at some point. I've looked around quite a bit, and I'm surprised about how few there are who supports this link ID syntax. Most software like Obsidian, Roam, and the like, uses the "[[full title inside the brackets]]" style, making them unable to parse my note link syntax. Some allows for choosing slightly different ID types, but usually never this specific one which I thought was one of the simpler ones.
For example, clicking the "test note" link in Obsidian would just result in the software creating a blank note called 202310191918.md. The only software I'm aware of can parses the datetime link ID type, are these two:
1Writer for iOS mobile phone
The Archive for MacOS
I haven't found anything that supports the datetime link ID for neither Android nor Windows. Are any of you aware of any software I've missed that can be used? All platforms are interesting, from iOS/Android to Windows/Linux/Mac. I'm aware it's a possibility to edit all of my notes using a Python script or similar to make them compatible, but that would break compatibility with the software I use today. Happy for any tips. Cheers]]></summary>

  and it seems to work well, but whenever i open an individual java file to test it, i get a prompt that this file is not a project file, and gives me options  test.java is not part of any project.
 i ==> Import project root /home/maksatr/Documents/ I ==> Import project by selecting root directory interactively . ==> Import project at current directory /home/maksatr/Documents/ d ==> Do not ask again for the current project by adding /home/maksatr/Documents/ to lsp-session-folders-blocklist D ==> Do not ask again for the current project by selecting ignore path interactively n ==> Do nothing: ask again when opening other files from the current project
 Select action: ``` is there a way to set it up so that it works with just a java file as well, instead of working only with large projects? I tried eglot, and it seems to work well as a linter, but for some reason it does not have autocomplete.

 The author talked about implementing a custom map function. I thought to implement it with the little knowledge I had and then compare it with author. I used the list comprehension and the author used the recursion. Same as the standard library 
 map1:me map2:author
 Why is recursion chosen above list comprehension? is it more performant ?

 I have been using org-mode for a while. I use it mostly for academic-writing, but I plan to explore more possibilities. 
 If I posted this a year ago, probably I would say that I wanted some people's settings and just borrowed them. But the more I use org-mode (and Emacs), the more I appreciate the space for personalized settings. So, I decide to start building up my own settings as a rookie.
 Here is my question. I feel that I understand some basics of org-mode, but I am not familiar with "how powerful" it is--with all the great things I can do in org-mode. So, I am looking for a comprehensive introduction or settings of org-mode. It does not have to be for beginners, but I would like to see how a powerful org-mode environment looks like, probably with many useful packages.
 Suggestions? Thank you.

 Also, I had autogroup that breaks undo every 4 seconds.
 Basically, this configuration breaks undo on almost every possible type command, every Spacebar, Enter, comma, bracket, moving up, down, everything. This is because I hate when undo deletes the whole screen of text.
 How do I replicate this in Emacs? I read this, but it doesn't say what is considered a "recent change".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I had a very great setup using app-specific password till now. But now want to move to oauth2 because app-specific passwords will not work any more. So I changed my settings as follows,
 ;; older setting ;; ... (nnimap "gmail" (nnimap-address "imap.gmail.com") (nnimap-inbox "INBOX") (nnimap-expunge immediately) (nnimap-stream ssl)) ;; ... 
 I looked for a solution, or rather asked ChatGPT about the oauth2.el thing. And it suggested the following,
 ;; new settings ;; ... (nnimap "gml" (nnimap-address "imap.gmail.com") (nnimap-inbox "INBOX") (nnimap-expunge immediately) (nnimap-stream ssl) (nnimap-authenticator oauth2) (nnimap-oauth2-client-id "client-id") (nnimap-oauth2-client-secret "client-secret") (nnimap-oauth2-credentials "~/.emacs.d/.gmail.oauth2-token")) ;; ... 
 I created a new project in Google Cloud Console, enabled Gmail API and generated client-id and client-secret for the above. But this doesn't seem to be working. When I launch Gnus (M-x gnus), it is stuck at "Openning connection to imap.gmail.com via tls...". Default browser is not launched for the oauth2 workflow.
 I have tested the following code. It launches the default browser and works just fine,
 (require 'oauth2) (defvar my-oauth2-token (oauth2-auth-and-store "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth" "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/token" "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.email" "client-id" "client-secret")) 
 Has anyone here done this kind of configuration - gnus+gmail+oauth2?

Background
Nickel is a configuration language being developed at Tweag. You can get some deep dives into its design from previous blog posts. I’ll summarize it here as JSON, plus functions, plus types and contracts. One of its main use-cases is generating JSON configurations for other programs (Terraform, GitHub actions, etc). Functions allow you to generate large configurations without repeating information; types and contracts help detect problems early when the configuration is malformed and determine where the problem is.
In the JSON world, the role of contracts is served by JSON Schemas, which likewise specify the form that some JSON-encoded data should have. It’s very natural…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I use pdf-tools for reading and recently started using bookmark+ and dired+ for navigating. Unfortunately these two great packages seems to conflict. 
 One of the issues I noticed was that the bookmark+ command for bookmarking a pdf location in a pdf-tools buffer didn't work; it gave an empty buffer warning. Turns out bookmark+ creator Drew Adams had already suggested a workaround which I discovered here: https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/72786/bookmark-plus-and-pdf-tools-pdf-view-error
 So that solved or at least patched that issue. But then I noticed that with dired+ installed and any fairly large pdf opened in pdf-tools, emacs will freeze if you attempt to do dired-jump or helm-find-files. Dired-jump without dired+ is not affected by the size of the pdf at all and just opens the underlying directory immediately. But with dired+ anything above about 1mb or so hangs it for quite a while, anything around 10mb or more just freezes it for minutes on end to the point that unless you want to go make yourself lunch and coffee, you will have to force kill emacs to keep working.
 As a noob, non-techie, non-developer, I just wanted to ask, what is the right way of asking about possibly getting this issue fixed, because I love these two packages and would love to have both in working order, but obviously don't have the coding know how to do it myself. Of course if anybody knows of a fix that's already out there for this issue, I'd love to know about that as well.

 I found code here dnd images into auxtex. I am using the excellent Zotra package. I modified the dnd to auctex code to allow drag and drop pdf files into bibtex. My attempt below works.

However, it would be nice if I could add the following functionality: change the path of the uri to the directory citar-library-paths, change the file-name (excl ext) to the bib-key, move the file to the new path and then sets the file field. This will be useful when one has to manually add files to the bibtex database (in case where the Zotero translation server doesn't find the file.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The org agenda can warn you about upcoming deadlines and scheduled items. It would be useful to optionally have warnings about other sorts of events. Birthdays are an obvious case but this should also include non-repeating events (e.g. a friend's concert). Has anyone achieved this?
 As suggested here, you can use diary-remind for this. But this is an awkard general solution, as it requires these entries to use a different syntax to normal agenda items. I'm just wondering if anyone's got a more integrated approach by now? I imagine this might use something like -7d in the timestamp, or a WARNING_PERIOD property.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have recently approached the world of Emacs, which I find great... The problem though is that I feel I'm wasting too much time trying to have it running in order to do the real work (and I've seen, there are several memes about it), so I was wondering what are the must-have extensions to quickly fire something functional (similar to vscode... Don't make me get back to that please) for development.
 By the way, I've seen several configurations scattered around the web, and something tells me that I've ended up in another anarchic realm (which is, something I both hate and love), as if that of distros -being the same except for one thing- wasn't enough.
 Of interest are: Python, Go, Bash, Clojure, Elixir, yaml (Docker, Terraform, Ansible), json, csv
 I would also appreciate the general must-have extensions, currently I'm getting lost navigating Doom Emacs and Melpa packages.
 Thank you!

 Anyone aware of any package/code snipped that could replicate the paste behavior of vs code? To elaborate what I mean by that. When I copy image in file manager and paste it in a markdown file in vscode it automatically converts it into relative path from the current file. Alternatively is there a way to auto complete in the `C-c C-i` mini buffer?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, redditors. Haskell beginner here. So I tried to solve this problem on codewars. And this was the best I could do
 ​
 module CalculatingWithFunctions (plus, minus, times, dividedBy, zero, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine) where plus, minus, times, dividedBy :: Int -> Int -> Int plus = (+) minus = (-) times = (*) dividedBy = div zero, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine :: (a -> Int) zero _ = 0 one _ = 1 two _ = 2 three _ = 3 four _ = 4 five _ = 5 six _ = 6 seven _ = 7 eight _ = 8 nine _ = 9 
 When I try the following unit test:
 (one $ plus $ one) `shouldBe` (2 :: Int) 
 I get the following error message
 test/CalculatingWithFunctionsSpec.hs:9:19: error: • Couldn't match expected type ‘Int’ with actual type ‘a0 -> Int’ • Probable cause: ‘one’ is applied to too few arguments In the second argument of ‘($)’, namely ‘one’ In the second argument of ‘($)’, namely ‘plus $ one’ In the first argument of ‘shouldBe’, namely ‘(one $ plus $ one)’ | 9 | (one $ plus $ one) `shouldBe` (2 :: Int) 
 If I understand correctly, `one` expects some argument, but obviously nothing is provided. I'm just lost can't figure out what to do next. Please help.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am not skilled in drawing, but after trying PlantUML, I found that I can create visual representations directly using code. This has greatly aided my spatial imagination. 
 Take, for example, the usecases diagram:
 @startuml :user: -right-> (Right) :user: -up-> (Up) @enduml 
 https://preview.redd.it/1bx7h7sa7vub1.png?width=152&format=png&auto=webp&s=6271256f6855b88a93a62abf63569f1bc542ded5
 With the use of directional terms like "up" and "right," you can intuitively draw the diagram as shown. it lowers barrier for non-artists - no drawing ability needed and focuses thought process on structural elements and relationships. 
 When immersed in text, our spatial imagination can often become less active. For example, when trying to imagine the hierarchical structure of an article such as org-mode, our mental representation tends to be more like a bullet structure in an editor, rather than a graphical tree structure. 
 PlantUML addresses the challenge of limited spatial imagination by providing an intuitive text-graph syntax. One notable feature is the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) functionality.
 Consider the following example:
 @startwbs !theme mono Emamcs ** Texting Editing ** Note taking ** File Manager ** Literature Programming @endwbs 
 https://preview.redd.it/95b2mg6w9vub1.png?width=567&format=png&auto=webp&s=2e0f00c54e4d411ec731eba7b23a46a665ed78fc
 The WBS feature in PlantUML facilitates the effortless transformation of a vertical structure into a horizontal representation. This allows me to mentally interpret and visualize the PlantUML code, automatically converting the vertical structure into a spatially-oriented horizontal structure in mind. Consequently, it effectively resolves the issue of my limited visual imagination and improving it continually.

 So I've been working with PostgreSQL and the JVM for very long now, and I've always been frustrated with the experience. The tedious manual writing, the ease with which you can break things, and the difficulty of testing have all been constant irritations.
 Some months back I started working towards my dream integration layer, with focus on type-safety and developer experience. Powered by cutting-edge code generation.
 I am excited to announce the first version of Typo, and invite you to have a look at what it can do. Through introduction and documentation at https://oyvindberg.github.io/typo/docs/ .
 Github repo with issues for future work here https://github.com/oyvindberg/typo . 
 Curious to hear thoughts on the direction this is headed in :)

 type Cont :: Type -> Type -> Type newtype Cont res a where Cont :: ((a -> res) -> res) -> Cont res a 
 produces an equivalent definition using an existential Functor w. It does so by abstracting a -> .. into a functor application w .., then adding an extra argument of type w a.
 type Cont' :: Type -> Type -> Type data Cont' res a where Cont' :: Functor w => w a -> (w res -> res) -> Cont' res a 
 Doesn't this look weird? Basically translating from Cont ~~> Cont' we decide what existential functor we want, and we instantiate w ~ (a ->).
  Cont' @(a ->) :: (a -> a) -> ((a -> res) -> res) -> Cont' res a

 Question
 In the context of having bigger hierarchical organizations of your files (around topic, context, purpose, whatever), how do you organize your org files specifically? 
 Background
 What I have now is shown below (edited for privacy and compactness).
 ​
  
I have one Git repository ("academics") which is organized by projects and employers and topics, with .org files scattered kind of willy-nilly, the same way any other kind of file might be. This organization isn't structured around taking advantage of org-mode's inter/multi-file features at all.
 Within "academics" I have two directories that are (kind …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Look at the following Haskell code:
 data Holder = Holder {object :: Object} holderLength :: Holder -> Int holderLength holder = length object where object = object holder -- Uh Oh 
 Uh oh! We named both the variable and the field accessor function the same thing. We have two options:
  
Rename the variable
  data Holder = Holder {object :: Object} holderLength :: Holder -> Int holderLength holder = length o where o = object holder 
 
Rename the field accessor function
  data Holder = Holder {hObject :: Object} holderLength :: Holder -> Int holderLength holder = length object where object = hObject holder 
 
 I know this is depends a lot on preference. Normally, when using other languages, I start functions with uppercase, and variables with lowercase, but I can't do this here.
 What do you prefer?

How well EXWM performs nowadays?
 Is it resource heavy compared to other tiling window managers?
 Is it still an issue EXWM not being multi-threaded?
  
My daily tasks involves just opening chrome, telegram and/or slack, watching movies and coding of course. Would it be a good fit for my needs?
 I'd love to know your thoughts if you use or have some previous experience with EXWM. Thank you in advance!

 Maybe I'm just missing something obvious, but I'm a little bit confused as to how eat-eshell-mode works. If I, for example, fire up Eshell with Eat installed:
 emacs-lisp (elpaca-test :interactive t :init (elpaca eat (eat-eshell-mode)) (eshell)) 
 Then I try running e.g. top, I'd expect top to open in an Eat buffer, but it's not doing that for me right now: it just opens in plain ol' dumpy Term mode.
 What am I missing? Is this not what Eshell integration is supposed to do? How do you use Eshell and Eat together?

 I write walls of text so it becomes chaotic to know which is useful. I write useful notes next to useless notes because these notes share the same context. Example:
 * My first day at PizzaLLC
 ** The manager was my high school classmate! (layer 5 - archive/journal)
 ** I would potentially start my own PizzaLLC (layer 1 - idea)
 *** Hiring good employees is essential (layer 2)
 *** Can call my bank for a loan (layer 1 - todo)
 ** Don't touch hot oven (layer 0)
 The layers are effectively a way to prioritize more important information. I want to be able to:
  
Only view certain layers at a time and hide the unimportant layers (e.g. hide layer <=4). 
 Sort "ideas", "journal", "todos" separately. I suppose the best way to do that would be to use tags?

 I read that emacs can report on keyboard usage (I think from xahlee's posts). Can it be repurposed to monitor which extensions are used often in users setup and they can share that report if they wish to public say via melpa like services. I suppose that melpa downloads can be used as a measure of usage.

I have an idea of what I will configure; maximum of two windows per frame, and if is my portrait frame split horizontally and split vertically for my landscape frame, plus some additional config for Magit. Before I take the plunge, I wanted to quickly reach out to see what other people have done for their configs to get some ideas. Figure might also be good to collect a few different configurations of window configs for people interested.
 Some configs I have found on the way and will update with any suggestions people have:
 *Edit - I will add some more here as I find them/people suggest them
  
Karthink's config, good integration with the popper package
 emacs-pure - has some display-buffer-alist settings for magit which are of interest to me, as the built in magit methods for handling new frames isn't exactly what I want.
 Sacha's config using set-window-configuration and current-window-configuration more than display-buffer-alist. The Ediff settings stick out to me
 burly.el by u/alphapapa - might be an easier way to approach the current-window-configuration/set-window-configuration that Sacha has implemented
 Prot's window config - A lot of custom functions to help tailor the window management experience to his liking. 
 eyebrowse - package to make Emacs be like i3. Example config from Karl Voit and the use of eyebrowse-restore to help make the configurations stick around.

 Any recommendations, please feel free to share them.

 I have a pretty solid workflow now based loosely on GTD with TODO tasks in categories, projects and NEXT tasks, weekly and monthly reviews etc.. I have a good org-super-agenda config that I've been using happily for months.
 The issue I have is that out of the myriad of tasks I have available to work on at any one point, I am not good at just picking one and getting on with it. Almost like flicking through Netflix and never actually deciding what to watch.
 Might be more of a behavioral problem, but I wondered if anyone has a function or utility for picking a task at random from a given org buffer and highlighting it in a new buffer, or similar. Idea being this would force selection from a set of tasks you know you could progress.
 Or has anyone got good suggestions on how to tackle picking a next task on which to spend time? I don't think it's necessarily bad task definition, and it's also not that they should be someday/maybe tasks to which I'm not firmly committed.
 Thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I just tried out eglot today, and I must say that I am very very impressed. However, like all software, the julia language server has a few quirks that need to be worked around. Long story short, I have two folders (not nested or anything):
  
folder1 - A git repository of a large julia project that I cloned. Starting eglot here only works partially. Anything imported from other packages is a missing reference.
 
folder2 - A folder I created with various scripts that I wrote for the project in folder1. It contains a Project.toml detailing the necessary julia environment for those scripts to work. Starting eglot here works flawlessly. Both functions defined in folder1 as well as the other packages folder1 relies upon are referenced correctly.
 
 Is there a way for me to start eglot in folder2 but have it work as if I have started it in folder1? 
 I believe one potential solution might be to tell Project.el that the git repository in folder1 belongs to the project in folder2, but I couldn't find a command for doing so.
 Alternatively, can I tell eglot in folder1 to connect to the language server that was started by eglot in folder2?
 edit: Hope the question makes sense, and apologies if not everything is phrased in the correct language. I'm pretty new to both eglot and project.el. Many thanks in advance for any help or hints!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everybody, first time poster here.
 I've been using Emacs for a while now, but just recently starting toying with configs, experiencing new packages, learning some elisp so I can customize my emacs experience and overall making it my own.
 A while back I noticed I needed some sort of dark mode functionality to change the theme to a darker one when there is less sunlight. After searching for some packages, I found none that really suited me.
 So I decided to write my own: https://github.com/pedroangelo/theme-rotation.el
 Check it out and tell me what you guys think. I've also included a sort of related work section in the README that discusses similar packages, and why I didn't found them to my taste. 
 PS: I wrote this package for my personal use. But if more people find it useful, I'd be quite satisfied with myself.
 Also, do you think I should work towards getting it published in MELPA? I don't mind the work if it something that potentially many people might enjoy using.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I believe this is a bug, but I want to make sure I'm not missing something obvious. 
 I know I can kill entire trees by folding them and then calling org-kill-line with point at the beginning of the line where the heading is. I do this all the time (though I have set org-ctrl-k-protect-subtrees to t to avoid accidents). 
 However, if visual-line-mode is on and the heading text continues to a second visual line, this stops working as expected. 
 Take for example the following two trees: 
 * Heading This is some text * This is a heading on the longer side for an example This is some text 
 Now, using emacs -Q, evaluate the following code (I set the frame size as narrow as I did so that the second heading only wraps around to a second visual line): 
 (org-mode) (visual-line-mode) (set-frame-size (selected-frame) 30 50) (org-overview) 
 With point on the first heading, call kill-line. The entire subtree will be killed. 
 With point on the second heading, now, call kill-line. Only the first visual line occupied by that heading will be killed. 
 Am I missing something?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have an issue where I cannot authenticate with Haskell, but it works fine from Mongo express or Mongo Compass.
 I have the following docker setup:
 version: '3' services: mongo: image: mongo environment: - MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME=${MONGO_ROOT_USER} - MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD=${MONGO_ROOT_PASSWORD} - MONGO_INITDB_DATABASE=badminton ports: - "27017:27017" mongo-express: image: mongo-express environment: - ME_CONFIG_MONGODB_SERVER=mongo - ME_CONFIG_MONGODB_PORT=27017 - ME_CONFIG_MONGODB_ENABLE_ADMIN=true - ME_CONFIG_MONGODB_AUTH_DATABASE=admin - ME_CONFIG_MONGODB_AUTH_USERNAME=${MONGO_ROOT_USER} - ME_CONFIG_MONGODB_AUTH_PASSWORD=${MONGO_ROOT_PASSWORD} - ME_CONFIG_BASICAUTH_USERNAME=${MONGOEXPRESS_LOGIN} - ME_CONFIG_BASICAUTH_PASSWORD=${MONGOEXPRESS_PASSWORD} depends_on: - mongo ports: - "8888:8081" ENV: MONGO_ROOT_USER=devroot MONGO_ROOT_PASSWORD=devroot MONGOEXPRESS_LOGIN=dev MONGOEXPRESS_PASSWORD=dev 
 And then this simple example:
 import Database.MongoDB mongo :: IO () mongo = do pipe <- connect (host "127.0.0.1") closed <- isClosed pipe print $ "Closed? " <> show closed is_auth <- access pipe master "badminton" $ auth "devroot" "devroot" print $ "AUTH: " <> show is_auth dbs <- access pipe master "badminton" allDatabases print dbs close pipe 
 Which prints:
 "Closed? False" "AUTH: False" ingest-exe.EXE: expected ("databases" :: [[Field]]) in [ ok: 0.0, errmsg: "Command find requires authentication", code: 13, codeName: "Unauthorized"] CallStack (from HasCallStack): error, called at .\Data\Bson.hs:113:10 in bson-0.4.0.1-5H36pPFgi2uLQl05dXyxb6:Data.Bson 
 I am sorry to just throw this code dump, but I have no idea what I am missing. I have tried "
 setLocaleEncoding utf and ascii".
 EDIT:
 I just tried with version 3.6 of mongodb, and then it works. So it seems the library is not up to date with latest version of mongodb.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While a for-loop is a straightforward construct in other programming languages, the loop macro, despite its power, can present challenges due to its intricacy. I find myself frustrated by its complexity.
 However, its conceptual abstractions are intriguing. Take, for example, the following code snippet:
 (loop for i below 10 sum i) 
 The utilization of the term "below" in this context is particularly striking. Contrastingly, in languages like JavaScript, I typically read "i < 10" as "i less than 10," pronouncing the two words "less than" in order to read the "<" symbol.
 The act of reading "<" as "less than" momentarily interrupts my cognitive flow between the two words. The loop macro condenses it as a single word, "below," allowing me to pronounce "i < 10" more succinctly and smoothly, without interruption. Another viable alternative could be "under."
 Moreover, the expression `1 < i < 10` can be read as "from 1 to 10."
 (loop for i from 1 to 10 sum i) 
 It enhance code readability mentally and streamline cognitive processing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all,
 I am pretty familiar with OOP & imperative languages in general, and so my thought process is perhaps completely wrong, in the context of Haskell, when it comes to solving this :
 How would you go about managing an interface-implementation type of pattern?
 Let me give you a concrete example to illustrate : I have written two Window management abstractions for my application using GLFW & SDL2, which are just defined as 'Window'
 data Engine = Engine { window :: Window } 
 Both of my implementations have the same function signatures and so for the moment I can decide which variant to use in my 'Engine' / program by which module I end up importing ; obviously given they share the same function names, I can only import & use one at a time.
 What I would like to do is be able to choose at runtime/dynamically or at least through a parameter.
 Now with my meager experience with Haskell & functional programming in general, I can see two ways to achieve this :
  
Using typeclasses, i.e. have a class Window, which defines my 'interface' 
 Then declare an instance for both my GLFW & SDL2 version
 
 Or an abstract data-type which uses record-syntax to list the functions of that interface. 
 Then create a new value our of this datatype & pipe the respective function implementations.
 
  
I realise the above probably makes more sense in an OOP kind of way, so I would be interested to know how this sort of pattern would typically be achieved the Haskell way?
 Thanks in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I want to define the config for all the programs I use in emacs org-mode. One thing I need to be able to do, is to change the colorscheme of my system. I define a set of variables, that then get updated in the config of various different programs.
 For example, I have this code block:
 #+begin_src css :tangle ~/test.css .test_class { background: $color } #+end_src 
 I would like to be able to define the color variable, be it in the org-document, or somewhere else, and then when org babel tangles it, the resulting file should have the variable changed.
 So, if color="#ffffff, then test.css should look like:
 .test_class { background: #ffffff } 
 Since I need to do this for many different programs, it needs to be language agnostic. Org babel simply needs to treat the code block as a piece of text, and replace the variables.
 What is the easiest way to achieve this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to make my Emacs configuration more reproducible, in part by creating variables with paths to packages, directories which depend on what machine I'm on:
 (if my/laptop-p (progn ... (defvar my/mu4e-dir "/usr/share/emacs/site-lisp/mu4e" "Location of local `mu4e' files installed by system package manager") ... )) 
  
 Here, my/laptop-p tests if (equal (system-name) "my-thinkpad").
 This system works well, so that for the relevant example of mu4e (which is apparently quite tricky to set up in straight.el ) I can use:
 (use-package mu4e :straight (:local-repo my/mu4e-dir :type built-in) ... ) 
  
 The package loads and the configuration works fine.
 But doing straight-freeze-versions gives:
 straight--dir: Wrong type argument: stringp, my/mu4e-dir 
 This can be fixed by replacing my/mu4e-dir with the string "/usr/share/emacs/site-lisp/mu4e", but I'd like to avoid this if I can.
   Is there a way I can keep using my defined variable my/mu4e-dir instead of the full path name?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Once I saw nil or 'nil from some (setq ..), it usually worried me.
 The barely nil appears to be a variable name no more than `foo bar zoo` and there shoud be a value it points to.The quoted 'nil seems to be a data or a value in data mode and there might exist a name it is given.it looks no difference with symbols as 'nilll 'nilllllll or 'nillllllllll as data.
 Every time see them, I find myself hesitating, uncertain and disturbing.
 This picture tells they are identical and comfort me to get an insight that lisp is much more pragmatic in evovling by patching up.
 As a result, I stop worring its theoretical consistency and confidently proceed with using `nil`.
 4 disguises of nil
 The wizard book SICP states it as:
  
Lisp was not the product of a concerted design effort. Instead, it evolved informally in an experimental manner in response to users' needs and to pragmatic implementation considerations.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm pleased to announce an even newer release of stan, a static analysis tool for Haskell. This release extends last week's release by adding support for 9.6, extending the supported range to 8.8-9.6.
 About stan
 Stan is a command-line tool for analysing Haskell projects. It discovers which parts of the code can potentially be improved, and offers suggestions on how to do so. Read more about stan in its README.
 Installation
 I recommend obtaining stan from Hackage by following the installation instructions in the README.
 https://hackage.haskell.org/package/stan-0.1.0.0
 Help wanted
 stan lacks active maintainers and is currently in essential maintainance only mode. I am helping out to make sure stan can continue to build with newer GHCs. I would welcome assistance, particularly on the following issues:
  
Supporting GHC 9.8
 Prospective support for GHC 9.10
 Fixing caching on Github Actions
  
If you would like to contribute to Stan please create an issue on the Github repository.
  
[1] Some point releases are excluded because the GHC API doesn't seem to provide enough type information, notably the later releases in the 9.2 series.

 I am currently learning functional programming and I am unsure how to implement this while following the paradigm. The problem I am facing is that I want to implement a function that stores an arbitrary large string (e.g. a sentence) by appending it to the data structure such that the system is building a text. The only operations that will be used is append and clear the data structure. 
 I have thought about implementing a rope data structure but I am afraid that it is overkill for this purpose. What do you think?

Denote is a wonderful package that I use to organize my notes, and having the possibility to have a code block with links to specific notes works well with my workflow (having rx conditions is great in Denote 2.0!). However, things would be perfect if there would be a way to have all the content of those links files (sans the front matter) in an org-mode buffer (or an org file). Can this be done? It's Emacs, so I'm sure it can, but what would be the most elegant approach to this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello to all,
 I recently stumbled upon the setopt function introduced in emacs 29.
  
defmacro setopt (&rest pairs)
 Set VARIABLE/VALUE pairs, and return the final VALUE. This is like 'setq', but is meant for user options instead of plain variables. This means that 'setopt' will execute any 'custom-set' form associated with VARIABLE.
  
So basically it looks like a customize-set-variable but shorter. Indeed, both are defined almost next to each other, with most of the interesting bits duplicated.
 After reading its source code, I have the impression that its only major difference with customize-set-variable (besides the fact that customize-set-variable is also a user command) is related to user theme.
 I am not sure about the impact of using one over the user, do you guys have an opinion about this ? Cheers

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ok, I'm quite new to Emacs and have a hard time fighting the learning curve. I'm using Spacemacs now because documentation is good, although stability is abysmal. But I kind of managed to configure it to an extent.
 Here's a problem. I need a tool that does basically this: I type a search phrase (name) and it shows every entry in an org file that contains this name, and if there's no entry with this name (i.e. heading with this name), automatically creates it.
 So it's basically deft, but deft works on multiple files which I find extremely inconvenient. I read the docs, but found no way to configure it to work on a single file.
 I believe it is possible to do with a simple org-capture using a custom function that checks if there is a heading in an org file and creates it if there is not. But elisp is high above my knowledge level right now and I don't want to invent the bicycle given how simple my problem is.
 I am extremely overwhelmed with options, but I think there must be some simple way to do this that does not require writing some custom code and (preferably) installing more plugins than I already have.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of useful properties of IO monad is that it is lazy: functions return not a result but wrapper that can be evaluated later and, more importantly, altered in builder style:
 doSomething().handle { case e: Exception => "oops"}.timeout(10.seconds) 
 What's interesting this behavior can be reimplemented on contextual functions, without syntactic and runtime overhead
 // contextual functions without context are not supported // so we have to add something here trait CanLazy // looks like eager evaluation but in fact it is not, like by-name parameter def doSomething(): CanLazy ?=> String = throw Exception("my error") extension[A](v: CanLazy ?=> A) // classical error handling for IO monad but without IO monad def handle(f: Throwable => A)(using CanLazy): A = try v catch case e => f(e) given CanLazy = new CanLazy {} // handle will correctly wrap doSomething() invocation // prints "my error" to the console println(doSomething().handle(_.getMessage)) 
 In addition:
  
handle will not compile on "totally eager" functions like println()
 handle will work on context functions of several arguments.
 def foo: (CanLazy, Context, CanThrow[MyError]) ?=> Result. Doesn't it look familiar?
  
As for overhead:
  
CanLazy parameter can be eliminated by erased definition (experimental)
 inlining handle together with erased reduces overhead to single val proxy = () -> doSomething()
 I believe compiler could be fixed to reduce overhead to zero
  
I find this fascinating and is wondering whether can new programming style emerge from this? To combine power of lazy evaluation and simplicity of eager functions.

 The first field is highlighted and when I start typing I replace the content of the placeholder with my code, but how can I move to the next one? or what's the best way to deal with this situation if this is not possible? 
 Thanks!

 Emacs just looks so damn thin for my poor eyes. I can probably just increase the weight, but I'm wondering if there's a better approach.

 I'm not happy with the default completion behavior in find-file, which selects the first candidate instead of just completing what is common to all candidates like the default emacs behavior.
 
 Lets suppose I have a directory with the following files inside: myfile1 myfile2 and myotherfile.
 With vertico, when I use find-fille in this directory, if I press my then TAB then myfile1 will be added to the minibuffer prompt.
 What I want is the default behavior of emacs (emacs -q):
  
if I press my then TAB, nothing should happen, then I add f and the completion should be myfile.
 if I press myo then TAB, myotherfile should be added to the minibuffer.
  
 
Do someone know how I can achieve this ?

 Previously I set c-file-style in dir-locals-set-class-variables depending on the directory and it all worked fine. With c++-ts-mode I have changed that to set c-ts-mode-indent-style instead, but it doesn't seem the take effect (well, the variable gets set correctly for the buffer, but the indentation style isn't applied). Only after using c-ts-mode-set-style in that buffer to set the style, indentation is set up correctly.
 Any idea how I can get this working?

 Eg:
 (I) Repeat a task on every Monday, Tuesday and Thursday without having to add repeaters and then mark as complete every time I want the task to move forward (similar to how Google calendar or tasks.org can do it)
 (II) Configure in such a way that anything marked with specific tags (or a cluster of tags) should appear on a specific day/s of the week, such as all the tasks tagged with 'backup', 'upkeep', 'repairs' and 'meta', appearing on Sunday
 (III) Add dates that denote 'from' and 'to' dates, and configure so that they appear that way on the agenda/schedule
 etc.
 If Orgzly does not support that, is there any other way I can do it? Another app maybe?
 Also, I am not super tech-savvy. I can read a documentation and understand stuff. I have done basic programming, but nothing with near-low-level type languages. As of right now, I know nothing about Lisp. So Orgmode enthusiasts, would you say that this is feasible.

 I tried to get this into Melpa, but was rejected because it's a smart-compile fork. I have extended its functionality so much it may as well its own project.
 I've been using this for many years, with enhancements along the way, like it,for example, being able to find the root of your github project to run compiles from there.
 You will need to manually install this, but that should be no effort for most Emacs users.

Once he hears or reads an idea, it seems so naturally intuitive. He thinks, "I've heard that before." He's unsure if capturing the idea in a note or writing it into the world makes a difference.
As soon as Will makes such a declaration, Will finds a truckload of notes that don't exactly fit the self-improvement line of ideas. Notes on ideas from Python, materials engineering, atmospheric science, architecture, self-driving cars, dog training, uji, vision, and many others. These others only make up a fraction of Will's ZK.
Will is hunting for interesting things to take notes on that are not philosophically based on self-improvement.
This evolving process is happening from the bottom up. He is finding it to be quite enjoyable and is training his mind, enjoying the journey rather than just the end result.
Is Will off base? Is this a thing? How do you view the mix of the content of your zettels?
He presently processed a self-help article 1 that pointed out three "hobbies worth pursuing."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi !
 I made Horn, an org parsen written in typescript.
 I needed a js org parser for one of my PWA related project and I wasn't happy with the ones I found (couldn't parse large files, failed to understand /bold italic/, written in an alien-to-my-eyes js...). 
 I decided to build it myself; it is right now available on npm and github. It can parse 10mB files within 1-2 seconds, and it has a good support of org features.
 You can reach me here if you have some suggestion. I hope it may be useful to the community !
 npm : https://www.npmjs.com/package/org-horn-parser

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello friends,
 I recently tried installing kde-plasma-desktop with sddm on an Ubuntu 22.04 installation with GNOME. I didn't try it in a vm first and thought I could just get away with having both on my machine with no problems. Stupid, I know. I ended up removing KDE and reinstalling gdm, but now I'm missing all of my GTK icons when I start up Emacs.
 https://i.imgur.com/fRdlr8o.png
 The strange part is, that only sometimes the usual GTK icons will show up, and it's always when I least expect it. I suspect that some of the config changes that happened when I installed KDE conflicted with my GTK and my QT themes.
 I've tried removing gtk3.0 and gtk4.0 folders from my ~/.config directory, removing ~/.local/share/icons, and inspecting ~/.themes, but I see nothing related to icons there. I'm just wondering what could be causing this behavior, and if it's conflicting with other applications on my system I haven't discovered yet. GNOME tweaks says I'm using Yaru-magenta-dark, which appears to be working everywhere except for Emacs.
 Interested what people's thoughts are on this. I don't care much for the icons in the first place, but I thought this behavior was strange. Thank you

They both try to auto-detect the root folder for a project, depending on if there's some specific files present, or if the folder contains a git repository.
 I don't like this. Why does it work like that? What I want about these packages is to let me define what folder is a project, explicitely. I want to tell them, "hey, this folder is a project", even if its empty, and I never want them to automatically add any project.
 Is this possible?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, im new to the emacs space and am looking to dig deeper into modding emacs.
 I'm a web developer working a lot with typescript in the frontend and backend.
 I started off with some basic packages like projectile, LSP, magit and evil. However I'm getting kind of annoyed using evil mode, because i have to consider stuff like deactivating certain keys wenn i'm in another buffer (e.g xref buffer) or undos that dont work out of the box properly.
 Furthermore I would also like start learning more elisp, for which reason I'm doubting if i should even use vim bindings, because paredit seems to be a thing that i cant get working with vim bindings.
 However I also dont want to leave my vim skills behind and would rather prefer a professional emacs config that is tailored around evil, if thats possible.
 Can someone recommend a lightweight emacs config repository for ergonomic evil usage? Something thats really small and easy to understand and extend (So no spacemacs or doom).
 ​
 Thanks a lot!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 Seeing this post explain how to install and use Emacs on Android (native build), I wanted to share a tip on how to have a unified init.el file which can be synced across both Android and Linux so you don't have to change anything manually.
 Here is an example for my org notes:
 ;; Setting the base directory for org files (setq org-directory (cond ((eq system-type 'gnu/linux) "~/Notes") ((eq system-type 'android) "/storage/emulated/0/Notes") (t "~/Notes"))) 
 Essentially, for each part of the init.el file which is different based on the system it runs on, you can detect the appropriate system and do a different configuration.
 This will resolve any of your Android specific changes you need to implement, like I have with my org notes location in the presented example.
 With this, you can have the same init.el file and simply sync it across your systems.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm pleased to announce a new release of stan, a static analysis tool for Haskell. stan now supports GHCs in the range 8.8-9.4[1].
 About stan
 Stan is a command-line tool for analysing Haskell projects. It discovers which parts of the code can potentially be improved, and offers suggestions on how to do so. Read more about stan in its README.
 Installation
 I recommend obtaining stan from Hackage by following the installation instructions in the README.
 https://hackage.haskell.org/package/stan-0.1.0.0
 Help wanted
 stan lacks active maintainers and is currently in essential maintainance only mode. I am helping out to make sure stan can continue to build with newer GHCs. I would welcome assistance, particularly on the following issues:
  
Supporting GHC 9.6
 Supporting GHC 9.8
 Prospective support for GHC 9.10
 Fixing caching on Github Actions
  
If you would like to contribute to Stan please create an issue on the Github repository.
 Credits
 Thanks to the Kowainik team for creating stan in the first place. Thanks to Veronika Romashkina for accepting me as a new maintainer for the project.
  
[1] Some point releases are excluded because the GHC API doesn't seem to provide enough type information, notably the later releases in the 9.2 series.

 My question is, can you use this for code review? I'd like to be able to view all of the code changes that a Pull Request (my team uses Github) contains and I'd like to be able be able to add comments to changed lines in the PR. I can't figure out how to do that with Magit and Forge. Is this a workflow that's possible and do you have any pointers on how I can achieve this?

 Anyone has good experience with both to share this stuff?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm exporting an org file with images to html, and using the #+ATTR_HTML attribute to resize the image. That's having no effect, because the Emacs I'm using doesn't have ImageMagick enabled.
 Yes, I can rebuild from source and enable it, but presumably the emacs devs disabled it by default for a reason. Furthermore, I'm finding that multiple sources that I might get a prepackaged Emacs from have this feature disabled. Rebuilding from source feels like I'm punching open a hole someone intentionally closed.
 Is there a workaround for what I'm trying to do? The best I can come with (other than rebuilding Emacs from source) is to use an external program to resize my image to the size I want it to be. That's fairly cumbersome, and it will clutter my directory with various image sizes as I experiment and figure out what i want. Any suggestions?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm having a very strange bug when using emacs remotely. Currently my .emacs file is commented out except the lines defining the theme:
 When i start editing a file, i experience a severe display bug that prevents me from reading an edited line until i quit and reload the file, It is difficult to explain, but i've attached a screenshot of a line of text before and after typing the string "bannana bannana bannana bannana" at the start of the line (and pressing no other keys). I can start emacs with the -q flag to avoid this error, but I would prefer not to as I very much like having the theme set. I've also tried enabling a theme after starting with -q (in case there is a typo in my emacs file), and I get the same errant behavior.
 Has anyone here encountered a bug like this before?

 WOndering if anyone has a workflow that gets you from org-mode text to Google Slides quickly and painlessly? I am not talking about anything fancy, and I'm also not talking about org-reveal or org-re-reveal -- just somehow getting to the point of having one slide per headline, with text. And I can apply templates and formats & add pictures after I have a draft up.

I'm a long time emacs user, and use rust, lsp-mode, magit and projectile heavily. The remote experience with tramp just isn't very good. I've had to work around several bugs that lead to hangs, and even though I'm only ~20millis away from my remote machine performance is pretty bad. I believe I've already done everything I can to make it fast (ssh control master, etc.), and I'm still not happy. On the other hand, VSCode (which I'm not familiar with) or IntelliJ make remote development a breeze. I really like how they hide latency, and handle reconnects well. I've also tried terminal emacs on the remote machine, but I just can't deal with the input lag.
 It's remarkable how emacs has been able to adapt over the years, and so I'm interested to hear about some ideas to keep emacs relevant for this usecase.

My main concern is whether it will be difficult to set up Emacs after such a long-term investment in my init files. I would love to hear from others who have made the same transition -- was it hard? Do you have tips to make it easier? 
 Thanks in advance!

There was this feeling that I need to learn Emacs way of doing things. Because all documentation or tutorials I get have Emacs keys. Virtually none of them tell how to do same things in Evil. Always felt like an outsider. Jokes like C-x M-c M-butterfly made me feel like I am not in on the joke because I use Evil. I wanted to learn the Emacs way.

 I recently did "something" in an emacs buffer and lost a bunch of text in different places, and I was unable to undo the deletions. I tried to use ediff (I guess I should have used ediff-backup?) to recover the lost text but not being competent I mixed up buffers "A" and "B" and ended up copying the deletions to the backup file and couldn't recover from there .... :-).
 Now I am curious if there are recent 'best practices' to 
  
Avoid doing 'something' that causes text to disappear

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi! Seaman Emacs is my attempt at a literate, modular (module-layer), extensible Emacs configuration.
 Seaman makes it easy to add new packages or combinations of packages to your config and safely test them out, as well as phasing out unused packages and remove bloat from your config. Lastly, all source code is easily navigable and documented, with a single .org file in charge of running the show.
 If you use Emacs 29 it's super easy to try it out with --init-directory !
 I'd appreciate any feedback/suggestions/contributions a lot :)
 https://github.com/alopezrivera/Seaman-Emacs/
 Design choices:
  
Source: seaman.org contains is the source of all modules and layers. All source files are asynchronously tangled when saving. config.org contains the source code of your (in this case my) config. All blocks inside are asynchronously tangled to init.el when saving
 Package manager: straight.el
 Key bindings: Emacs + custom
  
Out of the box:
  
Clean UI
 Homescreen
 Easy theme switching (light/dark)
 "Full pack" Org Mode with org-agenda, org-calendar, org-roam etc.
 "Full pack" PDF support with pdf-tools (highlighting, etc.)
 Magit for VC
  
Example config:
 My personal config built with Seaman is here:

Like the title says, I'm mainly targeting scientific applications -- nothing fancy right now, mostly just diagonalizing some matrices and numerical integration -- and I'm looking for some good libraries to use.
 I've already done a bit of searching on Hackage, but I'm mainly interested here in what people would recommend for N-dimensional arrays and matrix diagonalization. What's the general feeling on HMatrix?
 I guess I should also mention that I'm coming from a Python+Rust background, where my workflow was to do all the heavy lifting in Rust, serialize the data to a npy/npz file, and then do all the plotting in Python with matplotlib. One thing I haven't found on Hackage is something to handle the serialization step -- ideally, I'd like to take an HMatrix object (or some other equivalent) and just call a function to write it to a file. Does anyone know of a good solution for that? Otherwise, what are some nice, ergonomic (preferably matplotlib-like) plotting libraries?
 Thanks in advance!

 I have two projects in mind. One is to build a user friendly app on the web for general budgeting, and for more advanced cases; financial modelling and business use. This is a product idea, but my heart is really in number theory and various applied areas of mathematics. So second idea is to build a function library for a similar calculator catering to that. I know there’s good stuff out there but partly it is to develop my skills and understanding. 
 Is Haskell suitable for this? Would it be unwise to try hit two birds at once and just have a common library? Or should I keep the product idea seperate and use a more commonly understood language like python? Much thanks in advance!

In this blog post,
we will learn how to include Bayesian machine learning in a reactive rhine application.
Imagine a program that reacts in real time to a sensor input:
It might be a robot, an app using GPS data on a phone,
or a device to track an object’s location.
Also assume that we have some prior knowledge about how this data is produced,
so it makes sense to express this knowledge as a Bayesian model,
and use Bayesian machine learning to infer the best estimate of the state of the robot, phone, or object.
Then our program should be able to react continuously in real time to this estimate.
There exist numerous libraries for Bayesian modelling and inference, such as Stan, PyMC, and (in Haskell) monad-bayes,

 I tried downloading the latest eglot (rather than using the one that comes with Emacs 29) and setting 'eglot-prefer-plaintext' to 't', but this got rid of all syntax highlighting.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In my quest to create a personalized note-taking system, I chose to use Emacs. While I'm aware of various existing packages like roam, zk, and org-journal, I wanted a solution that precisely catered to my needs, without unnecessary features or the loss of essential ones. This drove me back to Emacs from Logseq, as I realized I only required a simple system for taking daily notes.
 With that in mind, I crafted a configuration to facilitate note-taking and accomplished a feature I had long desired: integration with Raindrop to fetch my bookmarks. Surprisingly, it was a straightforward process.
 This experience has reaffirmed my belief in the versatility of Emacs, allowing it to be tailored to meet one's unique requirements. I'm now fully immersed in the world of Emacs.
 Feel free to take a look at my configuration and offer any tips, code suggestions, or ideas on how to further enhance, simplify, or expand it. You can find the configuration here:

 `elgot-reconnect` fixes it, but it's really not a solution to call `eglot-reconnect` every 10 minutes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey friends! I'm using Doom Emacs and have vc-gutter enabled. When I make changes, a single character (for example = pops up on the left side of the line numbers. This has the effect of shifting the line numbers and all content of the buffer to the right. Ideally, I'd just like the column to ALWAYS be present even if there are no changes. I tried modifying multiple variables, but I believe all the fringe ones are for graphical. Does anyone have guidance? Thanks! 
 Update: git-gutter:hide-gutter is already set to nil and it doesn't seem to preserve that column.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello to all, As some of you probably did, i jumped on the treesitter train with emacs 29.1.
 I replaced my major modes by their ts counterparts, and gave it a try. For the keywords colors, it was mostly fine, and at first I only checked that and was content with it. 
 Things went a bit sour when I starting writing code, in particular the indent-rules. I have used mainly the following so far : - cmake-ts-mode - c++-ts-mode - yaml-ts-mode
 Over the past two weeks there has not been a work day where I did not have to complete or "fix" indentation rules to my liking.
 On the one hand it is much easier than before to tweak things, where either there was a customizable variable, either you were screwed. Now you can add rich rules, kind of easily
 On the other hand, the out of the box experience was much worse, barely usable indentation especially for the c++ mode which, despites its 4 presets, lacks the many quick toggles from cc-mode. 
 I do commend maintainers though for their amazing core implementation, the api + utilities make debugging tree sitter rules a breeze. 
 How has your treesitter Journey been so far ?

 I have found an old project on github from Mineo regarding Musicbrainzm but I was expecting more.
 Is there any reason for this lack of solutions?
 I am no developer, I am not complaining, but I am surprised, this is probably the first domain where I can not find a good solution for my needs with emacs (I may also have poorly searched, would it be the case, please show me the path to the truth!!!!) 
 Any idea why? Thx for your insights!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi ! 
 I am looking for a working example of an import of a package from Github Packages Maven repository using scala-cli. 
 My use case would be to import libs shared internally in my company org. And if I get it working for private packages, then it should work for public ones too ! 
 Currently I have :
 scala-cli config --dump
 ```json
 { "repositories": { "credentials": [{"host":"https://maven.pkg.github.com/MY_ORG","user":"value:PrivateToken","password":"env:GITHUB_TOKEN","matchHost":true}]
 } }
 ```
 and the following using directives 
 ``` //> using repository "https://maven.pkg.github.com/MY_ORG" //> using lib "my.org::my-lib:0.1.0"
 ```
 which yields an unauthorized error on import.
 I also tried setting the repositories.credential.host to maven.pkg.github.com and maven.pkg.github.com/MY_ORG without success. 
 As for the repository in the using directive I have also tried ( not sure if I tried every combination of both ): - https://maven.pkg.github.com/MY_ORG/_ - https://maven.pkg.github.com/MY_ORG/REPO_OF_MY_LIB
 I am sure the token works. The unauthorized error seem to indicate either the crednetials are not passed or I am targeting the wrong URLs. Any idea on what's wrong with my setup ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Slipped in between paragraphs about being worried that her family's hiding place will be discovered by a new building owner and the fairness of rationing butter, Anne Frank mentions being gifted a zettelkasten to track her reading:

  
Father emptied a card file for Margot and me and filled it with index cards that are blank on one side. This is to become our reading file, in which Margot and I are supposed to note down the books we’ve read, the author and the date.


Niklas Luhmann (December 8, 1927-1998), famous for his own 90,000+ slip reading file, was a year and a half older than Anne Frank (June 12, 1929-1945) who received her first card index file in February 1943 (likely between the 27th, the date of her diary entry mentioning it and the prior diary entry on February 5th). It was given to her by her father at the age of 13. As would have been commonplace, she was intended to use it as a "reading file" to note down the books she'd read along with the author and the date.
One can only wonder at how many entries she would have made over the span of her life had it not come to such an abrupt end.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It would be really nice to have everything in org mode, but I continually find myself coming back to planning with paper for all but the toy cases.
 It would be really nice, as a Computer Person, to have all of my notes and project management in a computer system. For instance, I have to manage my work sprints using Linear. But I find that org mode, and to some extent emacs, has too much friction for my liking.
 In the first place, it is not trivial to use with a mobile phone. Right now I have an emacs instance running inside termux, and notes have to be ported over with Syncthing. This necessitates (at least ideally) running a spare machine 24/7 to sync with. Not to mention that using my smartphone probably increases my risk of cancer at least slightly.
 If I have to write something down, I'm reluctant to open a new emacs window, navigate to my buffer, and then write down the point.
 Also, the default org-agenda views are much inferior to the typical calendar or timetable.
 Sorry for the emotional nature of this post. I'd be interested to hear if anybody was in a similar place, and where they ended up going.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Some context: I'm a Java programmer, but I don't like it. I have a background in mathematics so naturally I am interested in (pure) functional programming. At my dayjob, I have expressed my feelings towards Java and expressed I would like to do something more "mathematically motivated" and coined Scala and their effect systems as examples. My teamlead, who himself is a developer, wanted me to give him a bit more of an explanation of what I meant by this, so I set out to gather some information I can present to him.
 But
 I am confused as to how I can unite the following two descriptions of effects:
  
Rob Norris in his talk 'Functional Programming with Effects' talks about mathematical functions and then talks about effects as basically ways to be able to do the stuff we're used to in programming like functions not being total, mutability, ... He then talks about the 6 most known 'effects' and wants to be able to compose them, then concludes that basically an effect is an `F[_]` which is a Monad.
 Cats-Effect, from the docs says that their typeclass hierarchy describe, fundamentally, what it means to be a functional effect. But their typeclass hierarchy is for their specific runtime and focusses almost exclusively on asynchrony, parallelism and concurrency. I don't see `Option` or `Either` fitting in here.
  
So what gives? I am really confused at this point, but I would really appreciate if someone could shed some light on this. 
 Bonus question: In the same talk, Rob Norris says that there are a lot of other effects out there. How do I find them? This sounds silly, but does he just mean like "custom monads" that we might define in our business which are only applicable in our custom business environment, or does he mean more powerful abstractions which are just more complex than the ones he showed?

 One of my examples:

 Because seeing a list of candidates as you type and being able to choose from it with meaningful key-bindings is way more convenient and efficient than the tab-completion-system (I think this claim is backed by the way all those external packages work; helm, ivy, vertico). This is especially suited for a default because you can still use the tab-completion-system with it. So nobody needs to change habits.

 I just fired up magit to merge my dev branch into master, and somehow the keys have changed or are not working. I used to hit "b l" to checkout a local branch (in this case master) where I'd then merge dev into it, push it to github, and then checkout out dev again.
 I get this message:-
 ​
  
"transient-setup: Suffix magit-branch.<branch>.merge/remote is not defined or autoloaded as a command"
  
Hopefully someone here has recently done the slog and can save this lazy individual some time. What changed? I havent touched my magit setup for literally years.
 (magit-checkout from minibuffer works fine).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I periodically run an emacs batch command using (org-store-agenda-views) to generate plain text and html versions of my org-agenda. This process works fine generally.
 However, some of my TODO headlines contain org-formatted links (i.e. within the headline). In both the .txt and .html generated files, these links appear with the full text of the org link - i.e. with [[link destination][link title]] visible in the generated/viewed file - rather than just 'link title'.
 Is this expected behaviour? Are there any settings that affect this behaviour? I would prefer not to see the full org link source in the generated files.
 (I'm currently running org version 9.6.10 and emacs 29.1 on Linux. When I first started generating these agenda files, the links in headlines exported correctly. I suspect that the current behaviour began after an org version upgrade, but I cannot remember which one, and have just been living with it since.)

 UPDATE
 I realize now this is a quoting mechanism to prevent confusion inside an org document, and that this should not be removed. Instead is there a good way to font lock these commas so that they are barely visible?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In deadgrep, I'm having a hard time using the glob option to exclude files. Using rg globs, I can do something like rg Foo -g '!gtest*cpp' to exclude all of my gtest files.
 In deadgrep, the same glob filter, !gtest*cpp returns NO results. If I remove the exclude, !, I ONLY get gtest*cpp results.
 Does deadgrep handle excluding glob patterns differently?

 I have Msys64 installed, fzf works in my terminal. I also have bash.exe working fine.
 In emacs, I have modified these variables in order to have bash.exe called instead of /bin/sh
  
sh-shell is set to bash
 sh-shell-file is set to the path to bash.exe
  
I have also search for mentions of /bin/sh using deadgrep... nothing useful. I do not know what to do.
 please help me fix this problem. thx

 I am a big user of GMail's "Scheduled Send" feature. It allows me to reply at my pace and make sure the thread does not become a ping-pong match and replies won't come back earlier than expected.
 How to do that "on my own"? I use notmuch + msmtp (within emacs) to handle most of my email but like half of it I have to manage via Gmail's web interface because of the scheduling needs.
 I know about msmtp-queue but it is a all or nothing solution. I would love to be able to schedule my emails, either at Emacs level or SMTP level, with some header or something.
 Any ideas?

Ideas I'm thinking about:
Atmospheric Chemical Kinetics
OpenAI's ChatGPT as writing tutor
Should I quit? It would free me to switch to a more worthy, interesting opportunity. Something more in line with my goals.
Do I know what it means to write for the benefit of others?
Interstitial Journaling
The Indian Monk Tilopa's Six Nails and how they relate to mindfulness.
I'm thinking about the tension between what is easy, fun, and comfortable and what adds value to my life.
How do I physically review my ZK notes and journal entries? How do I make sense of this process? How do I connect with what is valuable in this process?
The ephemerality of thought.
Self-mentoring.
Things I'm reading:
Lispector, Clarice and Costa, Margaret Jull and Patterson, Robin and Valente, Paulo Gurgel. Too much of life: the complete crônicas. 2022.
Emerson, Hannah and Martin, Chris and Nisinzweig, Aviv. The kissing of kissing: poems. 2022.
Davis, Lydia. Essays one. 2020.
Chabon, Michael. The Yiddish Policemen's Union. 2008.
Music I'm listening to:
SUSS
Jazz for Study
Jeff Oster - howling loon
★★★★★
The "My rolling ten-day zettel production" is produced by a script for attachment to my daily journaling template. I do my journaling in Bear to keep personal journaling separate from my knowledge work.
Let me know if you would like to discuss any of these notes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Has anyone been able to get xwidget-webkit to work under Wayland? I saw that support for pgtk was added a couple of years ago so I decided to give it a whirl. Compiled emacs 29.1 on Linux x86_64 with webkit2gtk-2.42.1 and the configure options `--with-xwidgets` and `--with-pgtk`. I tried opening a url with `xwidget-webkit-browse-url`, but emacs crashed with the error:
 "ERROR **: 12:43:15.326: GDK is not able to create a GL context: The current backend does not support OpenGL."
 which is weird, because `eglinfo` does not report anything out of the ordinary. 
 xwidgets has always been finicky for me and there's very little information available on the internet so I'd be interested in knowing if others have got it to work and it's just a problem with my setup.

This is a story of how I recently had a problem and I came up with a cool way to solve it using dired, registers, regex, and macros. In particular, I realized I could maintain state during macro execution using a register. IMO I found a cool solution and I'm proud of myself.
 My problem: I've been attending a class and downloaded all the lectures. Unfortunately, each lecture is in a folder named [lecture-xyz], and its subtitle twin is [lecture-xyz]_subtitles. It was annoying to find the current lecture because nothing was sorted. I decided to prefix each folder with a number so they would sort correctly in my file manager (and dired).
 The Initial Approach: I'd jump between the course website and my file manager, renaming folders one by one. It was a tedio…]]></summary>

 In this post I will show how to significantly improve the performance of combinator based reducers by using a alternative abstraction algorithms. These algorithms are based on the paper λ to SKI, Semantically by Oleg Kiselyov and closely follow Ben Lynn’s implementation of Kiselyov’s ideas.
 I will also give detailed comparisons of the different approaches regarding emitted code size and execution performance on different reducers.

 In particular, I need the following functionality:
  
Automatic newline when | is typed; and
 Indent and newline when [ is typed.
  
I have been looking into different ways of doing this, and I have come up with the following:
  
Using electric-layout-mode, e.g. (add-to-list 'electric-layout-rules '(?| . before)); and
 Using electric-indent-mode, e.g. (setq-local electric-indent-chars (append electric-indent-chars '(?\[))).
  
I have also read about the electric-pairs-mode which might be more appropriate for the latter. There are also more manual ways of doing this, with hooks (post self insert hooks?).
 However, I am struggling to find any documentation on any electric functions, and different other major modes do these kind of things in different ways. My question is: what is the best way to do what I am after? If there is one function that I can bundle both of these features in, then that might be better. But maybe it's best that I keep these separate in case the user wants to enable, for example, layout mode but not pairs mode.
 I'd love to hear from developers of major modes with experience implementing such a feature!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[TL;DR: New to Haskell and looking for an existing tool that can automatically insert traceShow statements for debugging. Also open to alternative suggestions or better ways to debug. Thanks in advance! 
 Hello, Haskell enthusiasts! 👋
 I'm new to Haskell and I've been exploring the language through a project I'm working on. To debug my code, I've been manually inserting `traceShow` statements from the Debug.Trace module. While I find this method effective, it's also quite time-consuming.
 Problem Statement:
 I'm wondering if there's an existing tool that can automate the insertion of `traceShow` statements into Haskell code at key points. This would significantly streamline my debugging process.
 haskell
 -- Example: Original Code getMiddle2 :: String -> String getMiddle2 sourceString | isOddLength = takeMiddle 1 | otherwise = takeMiddle 2 where sourceLength = length sourceString ... 
 What I Would Like the Tool to Produce:
 haskell
 -- Example: With traceShow statements getMiddle2 :: String -> String getMiddle2 sourceString | traceShow ("Checking isOddLength:", isOddLength) isOddLength = traceShow ("Taking middle 1:", takeMiddle 1) takeMiddle 1 | otherwise = traceShow ("Taking middle 2:", takeMiddle 2) takeMiddle 2 where sourceLength = traceShow ("Source Length:", sourceLength) length sourceString ... 
 What I've Considered:
 I've thought about crafting a tool myself that involves parsing the Haskell source code into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) and then traversing this tree to insert `traceShow` statements. But before going down that rabbit hole, I wanted to consult the community. Is there already a tool out there that can help me with this?
 Open to Suggestions:
 Being new to Haskell, I'm also open to any advice or alternative approaches for debugging or learning the language. If there's a better way to do things, I'm all ears! 🐰
 Thank you for any recommendations, experiences, or advice you can share. I appreciate it! 🙏

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone,
 I am delving into the development of a turn-based card game and exploring technology stack options. Considering the essential need for distributed, fault-tolerant, and high-availability systems in the game, I am leaning towards utilizing Scala and Akka. The revenue scope of the project stays within the bounds making Akka usage free. 
 Here are a few points I'm pondering upon:
  
How effective is Akka in managing distributed systems for a gaming application, especially concerning fault tolerance and high availability?
 
For a turn-based card game, does Scala (along with Akka) provide a viable and efficient development pathway, or should I be looking at different languages/libraries?
 
If you have experience using Scala/Akka in game development, are there any pitfalls or challenges that you encountered which might be insightful for a beginner in this stack?
 
 Any insights, alternative suggestions, or experiences shared will be incredibly valuable. Thank you!

 Quick question: why no colons in extension methods? Object and class declarations use colons to group things neatly (methods, fields), but extension methods don't. What's the rationale behind this syntax difference? Is it just a stylistic choice or something more?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[OK, first of all, I've tried the orgmode and I think it's awesome. I like a lot of the advantages that emacs provides not being restricted to being a terminal app. However, despite it's huge potential, I don't know how people use it productively, I mean afaik it's as potent as an OS so you can do crazy things like "making a script to get code from anywhere" so... Basically I want to ask you about the features that you like the most. I'm not a guy who is going to use just ONE editor tho, I have to use VSCode for several stuff, I use orgmode for... well documenting, organizing (I should use the code features that it provides, which blew my mind) and oc I use nvim. I want to know what are the things that people do that boosted their productivity in emacs vs other editors, I think each one has their strengths and weaknesses. Ty in advance.

 Some searching showed me some really hacky things like creating two windows at the top and bottom, abusing faces, and other things.
 This seems like a trivial thing. Is this really not built in? I can play pong, run a terminal, manage X windows, browse the web, but I can't add top and bottom margin without hacks?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Projectile seems intent on sub-dividing my npm-based monorepo despite having placed this defun specifying that it should only consider a project root if it's a vc-root-dir:
 ;; we need this wrapper to match Projectile's API (defun projectile-vc-root-dir (dir) "Retrieve the root directory of the project at DIR using `vc-root-dir'." (let ((default-directory dir)) (vc-root-dir))) (setq projectile-project-root-functions '(projectile-vc-root-dir)) 
 That was taken line-for-line from the Projectile docs. Despite this, and despite nuking all of my Projectile projects/caches (to be 100% sure), anytime I open a library directory within my monorepo; Projectile will consider that a new project and act accordingly (i.e. I can no longer search outside of that library's directory). To put it more explicitly:
 / monorepo-root | |--libraryA |--libraryB 
 ... when I initially enter my project and search for a file, I can see that Projectile is correctly searching through all directories. However, when I then enter into, say, libraryA and again try to search for files in the monorepo, Projectile is only searching under libraryA (I understand it as being seen as a different project in Projectile's eyes).
 Am I missing something?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When doing some functions like (shell-command) or (project-compile) the minibuffer has control of the cursor meaning the text can be manipulated using the various text editing commands. 
 When in I-search though the cursor only flashes to the minibuffer and then returns to the buffer so whenever I do the text editing commands it edits the actual buffer and not the I-search target phrase.
 Is there a way to make I-search take control of the cursor in a similar way to the others? I tried swiper which takes control but it is very slow for me when search large files ~3000 lines.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 now that the Matrix bridge for libera.chat is closed, I'm trying to use irc the proper way with an irc client.
 I've a ZNC server running and it expects username and password in this format username:password , but ERC expects it in two seperate fields, one for each.
 This is what I currently have in my config:
 ;; C-c erc, keybinding will start erc (global-set-key "\C-cerc" (lambda () (interactive) (erc-ssl :server "zncserver.org" :port "6697" :nick "nickiename" :password "password123"))) 
 and this is the format ZNC server instruction page has:
 /server zncserver.org 6697 username:password 
 When I try the above ERC config, connection to the ZNC server fails.
 Then I tried using :nick "nickiename:password123" format in above ERC config, then connection was sucessful however ERC doesn't recognize the second half as password and uses the whole as nick and ZNC server asks for the password again.
 How can I resolve this issue?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was recently looking through someone's .emacs repo and saw they were using use-package chords for avy. I decided to give it a try. I can see the potential but it seems too slow. I'm forced to pause typing for a moment to allow it to register the chord before I can choose the char to go-to.
 I attached a gif below first showing what it looks like with a pause and then what happens when I type all the necessary commands in sequence. (in my case jw for avy-got-word and then o to go to words beginning with 'o')
 my setup is shown below
 (use-package avy
 :chords
 ("jw" . avy-goto-word-1))
 Is there anything i can do to make it more smooth and reliable?

 I recently hopped on the Emacs train and I came across an article where this screenshot was shared. I really liked the colors, fonts and the way it just looked. I was wondering if that was an available theme to download and if anyone could point me to it. I tried image searching, looking maybe the Doom Emacs themes, but could not find something that resembles it.

 I wanted to share a new emacs package I've been working on, which is built on top of another project I created ~6 years ago. I let vzi bitrot for too long. I live inside emacs to the extent that I can, but one of the areas I've long been frustrated in is the ability to visualize data controlled from an emacs buffer. I've lately been enjoying deno, and got inspired and decided to finally rewrite vzi using it. Of course, I needed to be able to control it all from emacs with a few keystrokes, and hence vzi.el was born. If you are like me, you might appreciate these packages.
 The rough architecture of vzi is that it controls the browser remotely using the chrome devtools protocol, and pipes data to a host page from stdin. A final html report…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A tip and questions about org-table formulas.
 I often use the bottom of a table to calculate some statistics (here in this example it is always just the sum of the column). To easily deduce, what was calculated, I like to add a simple string to the result (in this example it is always "Sum:"). 
 Now here is an example with the various methods I know to achieve this:
 | just append | it fails | utilize calc | plain elisp | |-------------+----------+--------------+-------------| | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | | 3 | - | - | - | | 4 | 4 | 4 | 4 | | 5 | 5 | 5 | 5 | |-------------+----------+--------------+-------------| | 6 | 6 | 6 | 6 | | 7 | 7 | 7 | 7 | | 8 | - | - | - | | 9 | 9 | 9 | 9 | | 10 | 10 | 10 | 10 | |-------------+----------+--------------+-------------| | 55 Sum | m | Sum: 44 | Sum: 44 | #+TBLFM: @>$1=vsum(@I$1..@III$1) Sum #+TBLFM: @>$2=vsum(@I$2..@III$2);N Sum #+TBLFM: @>$3='(format "Sum: %s" (calcFunc-vsum @I$3..@III$3));N #+TBLFM: @>$4='(format "Sum: %i" (apply #'+ (mapcar #'string-to-number '(@I$4..@III$4)))) 
 As you can see, the first method fails in the second column, due to not all data are numbers.
 Now my question(s): How do you deal with calculating some column statistical data and what do you do to identify the results later? Have you maybe written a nice wrapper around those methods to make them easier to write/use them as table formulas?

The cabal project has been making great use of theirs (#hackage on Libera IRC), but it seemed to me that there was no equivalent for stack users and devs. I did some digging and discovered four stack-related chat rooms:
  
#stack-users and #stack-collaborators on the Haskell Foundation slack (the current maintainer is there)
 #haskell-stack on Libera IRC
 #haskell-stack:matrix.org on Matrix (created in 2018; was bridged to Libera for a while; the past and current maintainers are there)
  
All of these are currently low activity, but the Matrix room in particular has recently been spruced up and I'd like to invite you there to get and give help. Stack users, stack developers, stackage curators, haskell package maintainers, interested spectators - all are welcome. Hope to see you there!

 There's a lot of calendar/appointment options for org-mode, but I am not an org user, and was intrigued by the built in diary/calendar pair. After experimenting with them for a bit, and finding out there are built ins for:
 1. converting ics files to dairy-mode entries

Convenience in the Haskell ecosystem by bradrn
My motivation yesterday was wanting to do a spot of data analysis. Nothing complicated: essentially, I just needed to plot some fields from a JSON file.
Episode 34 – Lindsey Kuper by The Haskell Interlude
In this episode Niki Vazou and Wouter Swierstra chat with Lindsey Kuper, Assistant Professor at University of California, Santa Cruz. They discuss what to do when your data center gets hit by a tornado, life in academia versus life in industry, and what is choreographic programming.

This is not done for any other day -- not for yesterday or for next month, when it shows only the agenda items that are active for that day or spanning that day. There are obvious performance reasons for this, and it is usually what I want -- except for when I am doing my daily journaling, when it would be massively useful to pull up the agenda AS IF I were on a previous day (usually "yesterday"). I only need this to be done once, for when I am journaling. How can I make a "view as today" command for my orgmode agenda?

Command line interface (CLI) tools have a reputation for being difficult
to use.

Whilst powerful once mastered, a CLI inherently lacks a litany of user
interface “nice-to-haves”, simply by virtue of its medium:
Simplicity: Common tasks should be easy to perform. This is often
not the case, but worse is when tasks can be tweaked in myriad ways,
leading to a combinatorial explosion of flags, options and modifiers.
Memorability: How does one remember all those different options?
It’s not realistic, which is why we so often resort to double-checking
the usage text, man pages, or search engine/generative AI du jour.
Discoverability: Reminding ourselves how to perform what we know
(or assume) can be done isn’t the same as guiding us towards the full

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Looking for a comfortable way to use emacs for ssh-ing to the servers of our company, but still having issues. Non solution is ideal. I have to use a proxy command to login as a user and after logged in can use sudo to get root.
 My preferred solution in emacs would be eshells cd /ssh: way. With this I also have the default directory synchronized and can easily use C-x C-f to edit files. Tab completion works too, as long I do not sudo -i .
 If I do - completions will break, which is not ideal because I have several scripts in the root path which I need to complete.
 If I leave the eshell way and use mx-shell oder eat-shell etc. I will have tab completion everywhere but the directory is not synched.
 I know I can just type C-x C-f /ssh:user@host|sudo::/file
 But the hostnames we are using are quite long and generic. So this would be a bit of a hazzle.
 Does anyone has a hint for me how I could come around this?
 My last idea would be a small function which gets the hostname from the eat buffer and triggers find-files with the correct path. But maybe there is something better and yes - I would prefer eshell for the whole thing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey folks, I created a toy clone of git using Haskell. I have been on and off learning Haskell for a while but never really did anything practical using it. Most resources (that I encountered) just teach you what monads are and that's about it. I had the hang of monads for a while but never really had the confidence to make something practical using Haskell.
 Recently I decided to change that by doing some practical stuff using Haskell. So I present to you Hagit: A git clone written in Haskell. It is fairly limited but if you really try you can actually do version control using it (at least locally). It can also clone a repo.
 I have also extensively documented what I have done. As for how my experience was, I really enjoyed it, baring a few annoyances. The code is probably not idiomatic, as this is more or less my first attempt at making something practical with Haskell. If you have some time at your hand and want to dive into git internals please give it a read (the readme has links to 3 articles that have the details) and if possible please suggest what I could have done better.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hej fellows,
 through work, I have discovered TimeTimers some years ago. I have found it easy to work with, which is why I've bought one for myself. However, I've been meaning to have something like this in emacs, because I've noticed that no matter the package (be it built-in or tmr), I am missing the convenience that a TimeTimer provides.
 First off, I'd like to know if any of you know a package that does this or something like this: conveniently display (in the modeline, maybe?) a bar or clock that shows the passage of time in a continuous fashion, i.e. showing a graphic representation (like a bar going from full to empty or a pie chart going from full to empty) instead of changing numbers (the customary form of representing a timer in my experience).
 If that's not a thing -- and I'd be flabbergasted about that to be frank --, I'd love to get some tips on how to implement this. If I were to choose, I'd preferably have a timetimer implemented as a decreasing progress bar in the mode line. The width would be depending upon the "available space" (dunno if there is a way to find that out for different configurations of modelines), the progress bar would be recalculated in regular intervals and the (pseudo-)continuous steps would be calculated depending on the time input when setting the timer. Maybe, the progress bar could "blink" (i.e. disappear and reappear) an amount of times to be set by a variable. For graphical representation, I am eyeing the SVG-LIB by Nicolas Rougier.
 I am grateful for tips and pointers, I am a bit at a loss as to where to start.
 Have a good day!

But that's not true! I can't give you a Haskell library package, not even in source form, and have it be usable in your environment!
 Cabal packages can only reference other packages in one of three cases:
  
If the package is available on Hackage.
 If both packages are part of the same directory structure.
 If the referencing package hardcodes the exact path to the referenced package.
  
None of those is suitable for third-party distribution of packages outside of Hackage!
 How is a package usable on another computer if it hard-codes the exact location of every dependency it has?
 C has an include path. Java has an include path. Why does Haskell require a .cabal file to hard code the path to all of its dependencies?!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone! Last week I released version 0.4 of ekg, which is an extensible tag-based, sqlite-backed note taking application for emacs.
 This version has been in the works for months, and has notable improvements:
 Drafts! You can now save (with C-x C-s) long notes and they will be tagged with "draft" and not show in other places until you commit the note.
 Magic tags! You can now have tags that automatically execute some elisp, useful for special notes that need some different editing. The standard example is setting your input method for notes with a tag indicating it's in a different language.
 LLM integration! Now you can have LLMs response to your notes inline, with prompts configured based on your tags. We use the new GNU ELPA llm package, so we support whatever it supports (right now Open AI and Google Cloud Vertex's APIs)
 File notes! Just like you can have notes on URLS, can you now have notes on files! It's basically a way to annotate any file. And because of how our prompt, template, and prefixing rules work, the directory structure can control the templates and prompts for any LLM integration you have.
 Also, here's a video demonstrating these features!
 Thanks to everyone who contributed to this release, notably Jay Rajput, Umar Ahmad and Qingshui Zheng!

 VSCode doesn't recognize implicit returns so you have to unindent manually when you move to the beginning of the next line if youre starting a new function and indent manually when you start a function. Scalafmt doesn't recognize bad indentation either.
 Intellij Idea object MyProgram: def abs(n: Int): Int = if n < 0 then -n else n private def formatAbs(x: Int) = <-- val msg = "The absolute value of %d is %d" <-- Metals doesn't indent msg.format(x, abs(x)) <--Metals doesn't indent @ main def hello: Unit = println(formatAbs(-42)) 
 I tried Idea and their support is even worse it wouldn't even let me unindent the private which defaulted to the indentation level of the `else` statement in the abs function. 
 How can I get VSCode to behave correctly? I don't really want to manually adjust indentation on every line every time that just seems tedious.
 Edit: from my research I can just use curly braces after the = in definitions and this will enforce the indentation rules. https://docs.scala-lang.org/scala3/reference/other-new-features/indentation.html
 Is this safe/reasonable to do? I imagine it’s not idiomatic, but having to do this manually will drive me nuts. 
 I want to learn FP but this is really I convenient if this isn’t viable I’ll probably just opt to learn Ocaml instead.

 tree-sitter doesn't recognize FOOPTY_API since it's a dllexport, and I think it's probably a windows-only construct. How would I go about making sure it parses that part properly?
 Also, the GENERATED_BODY() specifier is an Unreal-ism, and I don't think it causes any trouble, but it would be nice if I could add it (and other Unreal specific identifiers) to a list for specific highlighting and/or indentation instructions. 
 Where's a good place to start with these sort of small-scale tweaks? I've seen some links to posts with titles like, "Let's write a major mode" but I'm really just trying to tweak the existing C++ mode to handle a couple weirdo special cases. (Though I think maybe the dllexport thing MIGHT be big enough that it should be included, so maybe I should file a bug?)

 newtype F x = F x instance Functor F where fmap f (F x) = F $ f x newtype G x = G x instance Functor G where fmap f (G x) = G $ f x 
 Then the following is a Natural transformation
 eta :: F a -> G a eta (F a) = G a 
 Which can be seen (though not proved, as it would require singletons) by providing the definition for the legs of the natural transformation.
 etaLeg1 :: (a -> b) -> F a -> G b etaLeg1 f = eta . fmap f etaLeg2 :: (a -> b) -> F a -> G b etaLeg2 f = fmap f . eta 
 Now, let the following be functors (The following does not type check. Or I don't know how to make it type check.)
 newtype Monoid x => F' x = F' x instance Functor F' where fmap f (F' x) = F' $ f x newtype Monoid x => G' x = G' x instance Functor G' where fmap f (G' x) = G' $ f x 
 In both instances, f is a monoid homomorphism. The above can be seen to make sense by defining the following, which are basically restricted fmap's:
 fmapF' :: (Monoid a, Monoid b) => (a -> b) -> F' a -> F' b fmapF' f (F' x) = F' $ f x fmapG' :: (Monoid a, Monoid b) => (a -> b) -> G' a -> G' b fmapG' f (G' x) = G' $ f x 
 Would, then, the following be a "Restricted" Natural Transformation?
 phi :: Monoid a => F' a -> G' a phi (F' a) = G' a phiLeg1 :: (Monoid a, Monoid b) => (a -> b) -> F' a -> G' b phiLeg1 f = phi . fmapF' f phiLeg2 :: (Monoid a, Monoid b) => (a -> b) -> F' a -> G' b phiLeg2 f = fmapG' f . phi 
 It seems to be obvious that phi is a natural transformation, but I can't shake the feeling that something could be wrong.

That's fair enough, but it has it's problems. When an imported library changes the only sensible way to deal with it is to stop the python process and start another one. (That's because in Python the built in "import" statement doesn't reload the file. You could reload each library with reload, but that would be tricky.)
 For that reason, I would like to use M-x compile. It's suitable for that kind of thing and I've used it for running programs written in other languages. (I think this is a fairly well known Emacs trick).
 The problem is Venvs. My projects use venv. If I just start a fresh python using M-x compile then it won't be in the right venv. I've thought about writing a batch file to solve this problem. I expect though, someone has already written a package to solve this?
 Is there such a package?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A variation of this question have been asked before, unfortunately, I am not bright enough to understand them. So I am asking this question to hopefully get a more concrete answer from a particularly generous haskeller.
 When I researched the type of IO in haskell, I get this from ghci info:
 (GHC.Prim.State# GHC.Prim.RealWorld -> (# GHC.Prim.State# GHC.Prim.RealWorld, a #))
 I am not quite sure what any of this means, but from what I gather, this abstracts to something like this: IO _ := (RealWorld -> (RealWorld, _ )). This looks like the state monad, which has type: [W, W × _ ], for a choice of state handling type W. The StateT monad I see in documentation is a little different since it has monad composition StateT (s -> m (a, s)), so I guess I should say that we require the monad m to be the idenitity monad. 
 My question is, why do we need to use these primitive types? Somehow, this makes it possible for IO functions to interact with the outside environment, like call other programs or writing to the file system. But how does that happen exactly? 
 Second, what is this RealWorld? Is it a bitestring? An integer? A constant? When updating the state, what actually happens? 
 Lastly, the ST monad, which has definition: ST s a. This type allows us to perform mutations to inside variables but it does not allow effects. From what I gather, this does in fact mutate memory. It also has a function to "escape" the ST wrapper, called runST. Obviously, this makes practical sense, but what is stopping up from simply writing a function runIO that escapes the IO. That would most certainly be a bug, but what is preventing us from doing it?

 I heard the Haskell online community was supportive so I decided to look for some help.
 For context: I have never touched Haskell or Prolong
 I just started a Haskell class last week and this is insanely difficult (for me). I don't understand the Syntax of this language. Worst part is my exam is all code and i have 9 weeks to prepare :(
 Any good resources?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been trying for the past three days to get elfeed to display desktop notifications. It was suggested that elfeed-new-entry-hook can be used and it works, but parsing it is a painful trial and error.
 I've added https://lorem-rss.herokuapp.com/feed?unit=second&interval=10 feed to be able to test it.
 This works for example:
 (add-hook 'elfeed-new-entry-hook (lambda (entry) (alert (elfeed-deref (elfeed-entry-content entry)) :title (concat (elfeed-deref (elfeed-entry-title entry)) " -_ " (elfeed-deref (elfeed-entry-title entry)) ) :severity 'high ))) 
 But changing elfeed-entry-title (on the 5th line) to elfeed-entry-tags or `elfeed-entry-feed makes it fail (no notifications appear anymore).
 Does anyone have any idea why?
 UPDATE: Solved it (defun created for debugging):
 (defun elfeed-desktop-notifications (entry) "Parse and display new feeds as desktop notifications." (alert (elfeed-deref (elfeed-entry-content entry)) :title (concat (elfeed-feed-title (elfeed-deref (elfeed-entry-feed entry))) "\n" (elfeed-deref (elfeed-entry-title entry)) ) :severity 'high )) (add-hook 'elfeed-new-entry-hook #'elfeed-desktop-notifications)

 I use it quite often for other programs, but emacs ignores it (vanilla emacs 29.1, launched without init.el (-Q option).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all. I've recently made another video about my 3D game engine project Game :: Dangerous (written in Haskell), which can be found as follows.
 Project repos: https://github.com/Mushy-pea
 Video: https://youtu.be/wOSQ1cYoZXM?si=bF2UtM_zr8OYOPHi
 I'm interested in what people think about some of the design choices I've made. One of the most interesting things to me about software development is how design and implementation interact. So briefly, the engine is not a development framework such as Unity or Unreal (nor anywhere near that complex) but more similar to GZDoom for example. It's a program that loads a text file, within which is encoded environment geometry, game logic scripting and references to asset files. The game logic scripting is implemented through a virtual machine in the engine that runs a bytecode form of the engine's custom scripting language.
 I spent a long time deciding how to implement a map editor, when I probably should have decided early on and developed it in parallel. What I eventually decided to do (in June 2022) was to write a local web server that loaded the same map files as the engine, allowed their state to be queried and modified through API requests from a client and could save that state back to the same text file format. That server now makes up about 20% of the Haskell code in the main repo and shares some static libraries with the engine. I've also started writing the web client that provides a UI for the map editor, a prototype of which is shown in the video.
 Anyway, thanks for reading and looking forward to feedback if anyone feels like it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is a general question, though it comes up because I've started using Emacs 29 and tree-sitter.
 There are 4 presets listed for tree-sitter, with a few more for the standard C(++) modes:
  
Gnu
 BSD
 Linux
 K&R
  
Where in any of the emacs documentation are these indentation styles explained? I eventually found them on wikipedia, but that's frankly a terrible cop-out on the documentation side. The manual helpfully gives shrug-emoji style descriptions like this, for the BSD style: "Also known as “Allman style” after Eric Allman." 
 Moreover, I'd like to know what exactly emacs (or tree-sitter) thinks these styles mean. Just because there's a definition on wikipedia doesn't mean that's what's being adhered to.
 But even better is if I could just use the clang-format style in real time, rather than waiting for it to clean up after me. Is there anything that already does that?

 What formatters does Haskell have that are similar to them? ormolu and fourmolu look like good options with sensible defaults.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Does anyone else have the same problem?
 If I run sage-shell:run-sage to get a SageMath shell in Emacs, and run help(), I get the standard help message, which starts with "Welcome to Sage 10.1!".
 But if I try help(diff) or any other specific function, Emacs hangs. Doing C-g allows me to use Emacs again, but the SageMath session is no longer responsive: trying to enter any other command results in hanging. Even C-c C-d no longer works, I have to try C-c C-\ and wait for the SageMath kernel to crash, or do M-x kill-process.
 This all seemed to work before I upgraded Emacs and changed my package manager to straight.el.
 I'm on Emacs 29.1, using sage-shell-mode v0.3.
 I've covnfigured it as follows:
 (use-package sage-shell-mode :straight t :defer t :custom (sage-shell:sage-executable (executable-find "sage")) (sage-shell:set-ipython-version-on-startup nil) (sage-shell:check-ipython-version-on-startup nil) (sage-shell:use-prompt-toolkit nil) (sage-shell:use-simple-prompt nil) ) 
 (However, I find that the custom settings aren't being respected either ...)
 I also use ob-sagemath, which allows me to use SageMath in org-src-blocks, which works fine as far as I can tell.

Lets say I want to catch up on the GPT agents of generative AI and prompt engineering. I google the topic in EWW and just read with a org file open on the side buffer. I want to take notes and capture quotes into a that org file. when I select text from EWW, and intiate capture I want to insert text into the org file on the side where the point (cursor) is or even at the end of the file. How can I configure org-capture for this?
 EDIT:
 Think of it like this. I want to have a org file each reading session and I have have multiple reading sessions in parallel (session don't mean single chunk of time). How can i configure org-capture so that I can create a new org file for each reading session. or org-capture is not the right tool for this? Some other workflow?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi!
 I just stumbled upon a difference between the Scala 2 and Scala 3 compilers that originated in at least one bug in the form of NullPointerExceptions, that we didn't have to worry about before.
 It's super simple to reproduce, given a REPL:Scala 3.3.1
 scala> val test: String = test val test: String = null 
 Scala 2.13.11
 scala> val test: String = test ^ warning: value test does nothing other than call itself recursively val test: String = null 
 That warning is the difference between knowing that you are doing something weird or not. Although I'm not sure why this is even a warning and not an error, when would you ever want to initialize a variable by assigning to itself?Is this something that should be fixed in the Scala 3 compiler? 
 EDIT: this is already a known issue https://github.com/lampepfl/dotty/issues/14429

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dotty-cps-async 0.9.19 ( https://github.com/rssh/dotty-cps-async ) is on Maven Central.
 New in this release:
  
Optional loom support for JDK-21. With the help of Loom, we can transform arguments of high-order functions without requiring a shifted variant of this function to be available.
  
​
 def topScored[A](c:Iterable[A], n: Int)(score: A=>Double) = c.map(a=>(a,score(a)).sortBy(- _._2).take(n) ... val top100 = topScore(c,100)(a => await(fetchScore(a.id)) 
 Note that this also works for effect monads.
  
Direct context encoding: it's still under experimental annotation but much closer to full functionality. Now we can call a direct-encoded function over G[_] in the context of F[_] if the inclusion of G in F. This can be a foundation for the natural encoding of monadic effect stacks:
 type IOResource = [X]=>>Resource[IO,X]
 def open(name: Path, options: OpenOption*)(using CpsDirect[IOResource]): AsynchronousFileChannel =
 .....
 def read(input: AsynchronousFileChannel, bufSize: Int)(using CpsDirect[IO]): ByteBuffer =
 ....
 //Then later inside asyncScope[IO]:
 val channel = open(name, READ)
 val data = read(input, BUF_SIZE) 
 ....
 
A few bug fixes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello Emacs users, I'm currently trying to re-do my own emacs configuration but after facing thousands of issues, indenting buffers is the one thing that's going to turn me bald in a matter of hours.
 I'm trying to work with multiple languages, Go, Rust, Python, JS/TS, etc. The one thing I haven't figured out correctly is proper indentation without having to do keyboard gymnastics. I know that Emacs is more of a DIY thing, so any light shed here would be of great help. 
 I've already tried (add-hook …), using the :config section in my (use-package go-mode) declarations and more but none of them are having any visible effect. 
 Furthermore, I saw this issue with Go and I heavily suspect other programming languages won't come out as clean as I think. 
 Every time I edit a Go file, when adding a new line to anything that needs indentation (e.g: a function body, if, for, etc.) Two “4 spaces” tabs are inserted no matter what. Even when I press the <TAB> key I have to backspace ALWAYS, also some closing delimiters like }) don't align properly, but I suspect that's another issue maybe fixed by puni.
 ​
 The “best” thing I could do to prevent newlines from getting messed up on creation was turning off electric-indent, I've heard mixed opinions on that, some say it's great, some say it's terrible, I don't really know. Without electric-indent I don't have to backspace two tabs on a newline, but TAB still creates those two tabs, even when my modeline reports (TABx4). Here is a snippet of the important stuff in my configuration file. 
 (setq-default c-basic-offset 4 tab-width 4 indent-tabs-mode t standard-indent 4) ;; jsjsjsjs (electric-pair-mode 1) ;; Disable electric-indent messing up my code >:( (setq electric-indent-inhibit t electric-indent-mode nil) 
 If any of you could spare your elisp-fu powers to me, I would be extremely thankful. Thanks for your time in advance. :)

 Does anyone know how I can forse C-c C-a to run Biber as well as the other commands? 
 My config is pretty vanilla and for AUCTeX is as follows: ``` ;; Auctex (require 'package) (unless (package-installed-p 'auctex) (package-install 'auctex))
 (require 'tex)
 (push (list 'output-pdf "Skim") TeX-view-program-selection) ```
 I'm running Emacs 29.1 downloaded from MacPorts on a MacBook Air m1.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As far as I understand function with class constraints are transformed into a function with an extra parameter being the typeclass dictionary. This allows the function to not have to be specialized and only decide at runtime what to do exactly (sorry for the bad explanation). In short Show a => a -> String is transform internally to Dict a -> a -> String.
 I have a discussion on discourse where people consider this extra parameter as part of the function: Show a -> a -> String has TWO parameters.
 My intuition is that this extra parameter is only the result of an implementtaion choice. An hypotetical compiler could work back from the main an instantiate all functions with required types. Therefore passing a class dictionaly might be needed for practical reason but not in theory.
 Am I right or is dictionary passin the only way to implement typeclass in Haskell ?

 I tried the junos-mode but it behaved rather weirdly.
 Is there a programming language mode that will be suitable for this format?
 If not, is there a mode which can do the following, or something close to these?
  
Backspace at whitespace indents properly with previous block
 Ability to collapse and expand blocks depending on indent level or matching brace
 spell check using words already used in the buffer

 These 3 dots; I want to be able to click them to open/close the code. I searched quite a bit and found nothing about having them open/close with mouse. If they can be opened/closed with keyboard as well even better, but mainly I want to with mouse.
 The language I use is python.

So far I’ve been coding in the scratch buffer and executing blocks, but that seems really inefficient, I’m sure there is another way, more so in the case of writing long packages. 
 I’m used to coding in Python in emacs using the repl which includes a python interactive console, but I cannot find the equivalent for emacs lisp.
 I would be grateful if you could point me in the right direction. Thanks in advance for your help.

 conf { content } 
 I am aware that I need to setup indent-line-function to make this work, but I don't know enough Elisp to write a function to parse the file and make the proper indentation. A hack I thought of is use to use another's mode indent function like nginx's nginx-indent-line. I could also copy the function and use it by itself, not requiring to load the mode, but I don't know if this is the most appropriate way to handle this problem.
 EDIT: I already use Alexander-Miller/i3wm-Config-Mode which only improves the syntax highlighting.

They are quite slow too. Here's the link to my config file. How can I improve the completions? I would also like it to highlight unused imports (flycheck isn't doing it, idk why). Just this much would suffice :) I don't need anything else from a code-editor (although Emacs is so much more than that).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello!
 I'm new to emacs and so far it's really easy to use and it's very effective. One annoying thing however is that every time I edit the code I'm writing, I have to quit() in the interpreter, close the window (Ctrl-x + 0), restart the interpreter (Ctrl-c + Ctrl-p) and reimport the code.
 I edit the code and then just write "import *script*" but the changes don't appear unless I do it as mentioned above.
 Even if I just quit(), I can't just (Ctrl-c + Ctrl-p) again because I have to close the buffer for it to start again.
 Is it supposed to be like this? Or am I doing something wrong?
 Thanks in advance!

 (short to-the-point question under)
 I'm quite new to emacs, ubuntu and all those stuff; I'm studying computer science, I'm a first year and we're using Linux and (I'm using) emacs. On the school computers we have to input given commands in the Linux console to get access to the "import cv2", but I do most of my work home and I have a windows.
 I was then wondering how I can download (?) and make it so I can import "cv2" and use it's commands like "cv2.imread('plane.jpg')" and so on. I've searched on google but found nothing useful.
 I'm kind of just starting out so I don't understand what it means to "mix"/"import" OpenCV into emacs and such things. I have downloaded OpenCV (I think) but I couldn't just start emacs and start using the functions from "import cv2".
 ​
 Short question: How can I use the "import cv2" on emacs and start working with pictures? As beginner friendly as possible.
 Thank you in advance!

I am not interested in neovim as they have removed a critical feature to my work (cscope) and I feel that they do not value the kind of stability and support for working with older tools and languages that I need.
 I mainly work on real time kernels for embedded systems, boot loaders, etc. written in C. I also frequently write in Make, Bash, Rust, Python, and Go. I use a very minimal set of Vim plugins, primarily ALE for linting and LSP support and fzf for finding files, symbols (with ripgrep) etc. Frequently, LSPs are not a perfect fit for my work because of the large index size and the need to switch between different workin…]]></summary>

 Wondering if there's module that highlights the current syntax tree branch (or de-emphasizes the rest) in the editor like this:

 statement 1
 statement 2

 sub branch
 some code
 sub branch 2
 
 
  
I imagine such feature would be very useful for multiple if-else, case(s), and other nested code with lots of leafs

 But there are reasons why I would like to stick to markdown for my general note-taking.
 So I was wondering if it's possible to: 1. Make org-mode recognise.md files (I know this is YES). 2. Make org-mode pick-up TODO states from org-mode headings appearing in .md files with otherwise md syntax (*** TODO Read this, somewhere in md file) and show it in agenda. 3. Or even make org-mode recognise some md elements (headings or Obsidian-style checkboxes) with TODO states.
 I know 1 is possible, though not sure who uses this for what. I think 2 might be possible? And would probably be exactly what I need. Option 3 smells like somethink no-one should ever attempt, yet I'm not sure why (not).
 Thanks!!

 each case class shares the definition for "update" methods that use the copy function that they get from being case classes. Since the methods are all the same I want to declare them once in the trait definition but can't because it would require using copy() which is automatically generated for case classes. 
 I'm new to Scala but this seems like an issue that would come up often unless I am not writing in the best Scala style or it's not that big of an inconvenience.
 are case classes syntactic sugar for normal classes that inherit or extend a special class or trait that I exploit?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I started using emacs this week and have been interested in using org. I went for a modular config and attached my very simple org module below.
 From what I've read so far there isn't necessarily a "correct" way to configure emacs but I'm asking for a critique on anything in this module. Whether that be my use of use-package (especially as I've found its documentation somewhat unclear), my custom function, code style, or anything. I would appreciate any two cents or bits of wisdom as I begin my journey configuring emacs.

Another installment of the What Are You Working On? thread. Add to this thread by telling us what is happening in and around your ZK journey. Join the community and enlighten us about your knowledge path trajectory. I do this for selfish reasons. It helps me clarify my goals and visualize my thinking. And sometimes, a conversation sparks an idea worth exploring.
Ideas I'm thinking about:
My life is slowly imploding.
How I can be compassionate to myself. Let the breath coddle, hug, nurture, and fill me with wonder.
The tutoring possibilities of OpenAI's ChatGPT.
Blogging my notes.
Things I'm reading:
Lispector, Clarice and Costa, Margaret Jull and Patterson, Robin and Valente, Paulo Gurgel. Too much of life: the complete crônicas. 2022.
Music I'm listening to:

 However loading it by default with straight package manager doesn't work:
 (package! elfeed-notifier :recipe (:host github :repo "flocks/elfeed-notifier")) 
 Nothing happens, no function or variables are available.
 Does anyone know what's the standard procedure for loading such packages? I assume that it has something to do with use-package?

 (fset #'jsonrpc--log-event #'ignore) remove laggy typing it probably reduces chatty json from lsp to eglot i guess
 (setq eglot-events-buffer-size 0) disabling event logging in eglot
 (setq eglot-sync-connect nil) disabling elgot freeze the UI for up to 3s when you open file maybe large one
 install gcmh package to increase the gc value when necessary and decrease it. nice package btw
 (add-hook 'focus-out-hook 'garbage-collect) optional, if you don't want to use gcmh package
 (setq eglot-connect-timeout nil) optional "my code actually"
 set this values on company package or
 (setq company-idle-delay 0) how long to wait for company mode to wait after it got completion obviously you don't want to wait so just set it to 0
 (setq company-minimum-prefix-length 1) how many characters you want to type before popping up the completion UI obviously 1 right
 if there is anything that i am missing pls let me know guys, am new to Emacs i want to learn from you all. i would love to see your config too to learn how to configure mine too

 ./configure --with-native-compilation --with-pgtk --with-modules --with-cairo --with-x-toolkit=no
 When I open a PDF and enable pdf-tools with pdf-tools-install the performance is initially great. However, after I resize with +,- the performance dramatically drops, scrolling becomes extremely laggy to the point of being unusable. Resetting the buffer restores the performance. Running the profiler didn't illuminate anything useful.
 I've eliminated there being something in my configuration since the issue persists even when I run emacs with the -Q flag. Of note for my system I'm running on wayland. I'll post an update when I'm able to test on Xorg.
 Are there some packages that I might be missing on my system? Or some configuration options I might be missing?
 Thanks a million for the help!
 update issue appears on the same machine running xorg.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Based on my understanding, compile it without sudo might be a safer option. I recall that when I used the sudo installation of Emacs, the old binaries remained even after I removed Emacs with sudo make uninstall, make clean and make distclean.
 This is the way I compile Emacs right now: (Notice, I'm using sudo make install)
 $ ./autogen.sh $ ./configure --without-compress-install --with-native-compilation --with-json --with-mailutils --with-tree-sitter CC=gcc-12 $ make -j 4 $ sudo make install 
 If I were able to compile it in the home folder, I believe it would be safer in the sense that it wouldn't interfere with any system libraries, right? And it would be easier to uninstall, correct?

 When I use the mouse to close a tab on the tab-line, all works as expected. The context menu choice "Close" removes the tab from the tab-line and buries the buffer. 
 However, when I call tab-line-close-tab() with M-x, or from a keybinding, or by evaluating it in *scratch*, this error is returned: (args-out-of-range 0 0). 
 Here's the relevant part of the backtrace: 
  
Debugger entered--Lisp error: (args-out-of-range 0 0) 
 tab-line--get-tab-property(tab nil) 
 tab-line-close-tab() 
 elisp--eval-last-sexp(t)
  
The Elisp for tab-line-close-tab() shows that it takes an optional argument, EVENT. I'm wondering this: if I provided an argument to EVENT, an argument to indicate something other than a mouse click, would the function then work?

I'm also finding Voice control and dictation software to be severely lacking. But I do feel like with the right Emacs set up I should be able to do more with less)
 Has anyone had success using emacs to help deal with their RSI? On a basic level I'm thinking of things like auto capitalizing sentences after. Or some kind of English friendly hippie expand to auto complete words using context. In the dream version maybe you can occasionally dictate words and then feed that through Local LLM to fix up the inevitable problems. Also, personally, something like a super abbreviation module that was great at auto completing words or guessing it words only using the left side of a split keyboard.
 The ultimate irony here is I'd love to take on some of these projects myself, but I can't effectively type anymore. Sad panda. After a few days of rest I'm able to test new keyboard, I got excited for a few hours, and then spend the rest of the day watching the pain in my right forearm intensify. I'm hoping to get up to some base level of functionality using existing tools that I can use the bootstrap my own development.
 Anyway, if there's anything you know of or directions you can put me in I greatly appreciate it.
 (if my current depression is coming through this post please excuse me, chronic pain is just a bitch and AA so when you can't do any of the things that you would normally do to take your mind off it. I guess I should be happy voice control works on this iPad at all, I just wish it was better and hooked up to a local LLM. Peace)

 Stan is a static analysis tool for Haskell. Its maintainers seem to have stopped supporting it after the GHC 8.x series because the GHC API changed too frequently for them to want to keep making adjustments.
 Last year I did quite a lot of work to bring Stan and its dependencies up to 9.4. I made a PR to the Stan Github repo last month:
 https://github.com/kowainik/stan/pull/506
 I haven’t heard anything from the maintainers.
 The only maintainer I know of is Veronika Romashkina. I’ve sent her a private email about this but had no response. Does anyone know how I can get in contact with Veronika or another Stan maintainer, if there is one?
 I would be willing to be a comaintainer for Stan and the rest of the Kowainik ecosystem (if only to make sure they continue to work with future GHCs).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi ... absolute emacs fan here (using emacs solely to write prose) and now that I updated to 29 (macOS) I encounter a strange problem in org-mode: return doesn't work at the end of an org-headline when folded, it's just stuck. Normally placing point behind ellipsis and then hitting return would just place point at the beginning of the line below the headline (while it stays collapsed).
 Now point is stuck behind the ellipsis! Why?!
 Removed my complete config to test emacs out of the box and the problem ist still there and googled around but could not find anything about this problem.
 Is this a bug or something new that I don't understand?
 Would be very thankful if somebody could tell me something about this.
 Thanks for reading.
 Many greetz

I've previously used `Amazonka`, the Haskell library for interacting with AWS services, and found it quite useful. The main services used are EC2, S3, Secrets Manager, SES (via Amazonka).
 I'm trying to port the above (working) Haskell-based backend to work in Azure.
 I'm curious if anyone has experience using Haskell to work with Azure services in a production (or test) environment. Specifically, I'm interested in hearing about:
  
Your experiences or challenges faced while integrating Azure services with Haskell
 Recommendations on Haskell libraries or tools that you found effective for interacting with Azure services, similar to how Amazonka is used for AWS.
  
Thanks in advance for your input! 😊

Or should I go into more detailed title like which flour should I buy or how do I use the oven? If I need to go to the detailed titles, does it mean I need to create a separate note for each title?

This theme has been discussed previously, but I'm approaching it from the perspective of knowledge work and research. What are your personal views on AI, specifically ChatGPT and related models, in relation to how we engage with knowledge and conduct research?
Recently, I had the opportunity to work with ChatGPT-4. I've been inputting numerous academic papers for analysis and summarization. From my perspective, this is one of its most valuable applications. I'm exploring worlds of CFS and Fibromyalgia, and as someone who isn't currently in academia (though I have past experience), ChatGPT has empowered me to undertake my own research. I believe I can do so reliably, evaluating various sources to draw practical, science-based conclusions. It has also allowed me to simplify complex topics by explaining concepts in clear, jargon-free language.
A couple of additional questions: Are there any drawbacks to this approach? How do you engage with these models, if at all?]]></summary>

 I am trying to find a way to archive todo tasks in to a separate todo-archive.org file, but preserve the sub tree structure above, so for example if I archive Task 5, it will be archived in the following way, showing both the level 1 and 2 sub trees:
 * Project 1 ** Sub Project 2 *** DONE Task 5 
 I already tried adding another :ARCHIVE: property like this:
  :PROPERTIES: :ARCHIVE: todo-archive.txt::* Project 1/Sub Project 2 :END: 
 However this doesn't work.
 Does anyone know of a solution?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Using Doom Emacs. My modifications basically include
  
Adding packages to packages.el and
 I have defined my org directory in config.el
 I have defined custom todo keywords in config.el
 additionally I have created functions within my config.el to create org-ql queries which are relatively straight forward - basically sorting the above defined custom keywords in a view.
  
Configuration:
 GNU Emacs v29.1 nil
 Doom core v3.0.0-pre HEAD -> master 844a82c4 2023-09-22 23:18:31 +0200
 Doom modules v23.09.0-pre HEAD -> master 844a82c4 2023-09-22 23:18:31 +0200
 Issue:
 This whole setup was working wonderfully till about 2 weeks ago when I am not if I modified something by mistake or if it was because I ran doom upgrade.
 Now every time I try to call the function, I get : Error running timer ‘org-reveal’: (error "‘org-element-at-point’ cannot be used in non-Org buffer #<buffer \*doom\*> (+doom-dashboard-mode)") [19 times]
 I have nuked my doom directory and reinstalled, yet I still get the same error. I furthermore tried starting emacs with "emacs -Q" and then inserting ":org-mode" but that also gives me the same error. What am I missing here?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As part of my ongoing quest to incorporate functionality from Excel-like programs into Org tables, I made company-org-table, a completion backend for Org table cells that mimics the auto-complete behavior of spreadsheet programs like Excel, LibreOffice, and Google Sheets: 
 https://github.com/shankar2k/company-org-table
 By default, the completion candidates are the contents of other cells in the same table column, but company-org-table can also be configured to dynamically generate candidates based on the table name and column header.
 The animation below illustrates company-org-table in action:
 Auto-completion in an Org table using company-org-table. Completion candidates in the first two columns are predefined lists, but in the second two columns are other table cells in the same column.
 I hope some of you find this useful!

 The thing is, I’m having a couple of type issues with the library, and I don’t really understand much about what the functions should get as input, or what they return… So, I thought that maybe a more statically typed programming language might help, hopefully, my favorite one :).
 I’m looking for library recommendations that:
  
Allows me to write a simple CNN at first (like LeNET) and then maybe jump into other architectures (AlexNet maybe?)
 
Can run on an AMD Radeon GPU
 
Runs on windows? (not mandatory, but desirable since my it’s my tutors OS)
 
 Thanks in advanced

Since im an advanced genius, my project uses java preview features. LSP correctly sets this up (due to it being specified in my pom.xml, I assume).
 When I try to start the debug using M-x dap-java-debug however, it wont run due to the missing --enable-preview-features flag.
 So i wrote a custom debug template that should fix this - only problem is, since I have already picked a debug template the first time I launched the debugger, I can't figure out how to now switch to my new template. If it matters: im using doom.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all. It's been a long time coming, but I recently released Orgro 1.33.3 with simple editing support.
 At the moment you can:
  
Toggle list item checkboxes
 Cycle the TODO status on headlines
 Undo/redo changes
 Auto-save the edited document back to the original file, or if permissions don't allow, then you will be prompted to share or discard the document
  
I've added lots of other improvements as well; see the changelog for details.
 I'm still thinking about other kinds of editing operations and how they can be exposed comfortably in a mobile UI (especially one that tries to mimic the "native" appearance of an Org Mode doc in Emacs). If you have ideas, suggestions, or other feedback, please feel free to open an issue or start a discussion.
 A final thing to mention is that I'm still a bit worried about Orgro making unwanted changes to files when saving them. I tried hard to be able to write files back verbatim (modulo edits), but if you notice any incidental changes then please report them.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Can anyone give an overview of how to install treesitter for org-mode? I attempted via this package (https://github.com/milisims/tree-sitter-org) but it seems to be oriented towards Neovim, and I'm not sure what the actual process would be for installing a non-standard treesitter grammar. 
 I'm open to other ideas or avenues as well, this just seemed like the most complete option. Thanks in advance!

Now that the foundations are laid out, we decided to publish our work-in-progress specification. However, much remains to be done. In the coming months, we will integrate the missing pieces we mentioned at the beginning of this post.
 In the meantime, this specification can already serve as a reference for many core aspects of Scala 3.

 I've just installed GHC 9.6.2 with `stack --resolver nightly-2023-09-26`.
 Previously, the GHC docs were installed along with GHC, but this doesn't seem the case anymore: I can't find the "users_guide" docs anywhere on my disk now. I did find the docs for the libraries and also for base, but the users guide seems to be absent.
 Has it not been packaged with the new GHC version, or am I missing a setting for stack? :)
 Could I download the docs separately from somewhere else? I can only find an online version and don't want to use some kind of crawler.
 Regards,
 Hai

 Unfortunately, I cannot use emacs-jupyter because I am working on an assignment that uses animations. I tried ein but it does not produce animations. I am using Firenvim + neovim right now and while very useful I have issues with the editor size and position in the browser page. 
 I think that the best thing would be to have Emacs keybindings in the text areas. Is there any way to setup this in a reliable way? Some of the shortcuts are reserved by Firefox, such as Ctrl-a, Ctrl-e, Ctrl-f etc.
 I am using Sway, so emacs-everywhere does not work.
 Thank you for any suggestion or pointers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to use dependent types to make my code more typesafe and concise, while also being able to express precise invariants for it. One problem, though, is that I want, at some point, to read a list, which was previously saved to a files, that has it's type parameterized to a Dependent Sum. The following example closely resembles code I'm writing at the moment (as this is an example, I don't know if all pragmas need to compile the following are included in here. Please shout me out if corrections are needed):
 {-# LANGUAGE DataKinds #-} {-# LANGUAGE ExistentialQuantification #-} {-# LANGUAGE TypeApplications #-} {-# LANGUAGE TypeFamilies #-} import Data.Kind (Type) import Numeric.Natural (Natural) type Alt :: FooType -> a -> b type family Alt a b where Alt 'Foo1 a = a Alt 'Foo2 a = () data FooType = Foo1 | Foo2 deriving (Show, Read) data SFooType :: FooType -> Type where SFoo1 :: SFooType 'Foo1 SFoo2 :: SFooType 'Foo2 data Bar :: FooType -> Type where Bar :: forall (s :: FooType). {a :: Alt s Integer, b :: Alt s Natural} -> Bar s deriving instance Show (Bar 'Foo1) deriving instance Show (Bar 'Foo2) deriving instance Read (Bar 'Foo1) deriving instance Read (Bar 'Foo2) data SomeBar :: Type where SomeBar :: forall (s :: FooType). SFooType s -> Bar s -> SomeBar instance Show SomeBar where show (SomeBar s b) = case s of SFoo1 -> show @(Bar 'Foo1) b SFoo2 -> show @(Bar 'Foo2) b 
 As you can see, I could figure out how to write show instances for a dependent sum. Read instances, though, are not as straight forward. I've tried, without success, to write an instance for it on my own.
 Now I want to hear from you. Am I approaching this from the wrong angle? If not, what would you suggest I do to make this possible?
 Thanks in advance, guys.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi there, I just had a question I wonder if someone could help me with.
 I recently came across The Guardian newspaper's style guide checker, and thought something similar could be really useful to me in my work. The code for the project is open source on Github, so in theory it should be doable. However, apparently most of it is in Scala, and my programming experience is already very limited to basically only some beginner Python.
 How doable would it be to use The Guardian's code as a base to create something similar myself, given this background? I'm willing to invest time and learning into it, but just wanted to ascertain the scale of the undertaking before committing to that.
 I'd appreciate any opinions or advice on this. Thank you very much!

 I'm currently using org-icalendar-combine-agenda-files to export the TODOs from all my agenda files. I don't want to reschedule the TODOs to today, as many of them are recurring items and I don't want the next repeat time to be based on today when I do mark them as DONE.

 (global-set-key (kbd "C-.") 'scroll-up-line)
 (global-set-key (kbd "C-,") 'scroll-down-line)
 C-. and C-, feel pretty natural, and they aren't bound by default. scroll-up-line and scroll-down-line aren't bound by default either, and they're nice cause they move the screen up or down a line instead of an entire page.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I don't think my title explains this well. Basically, what I mean is that, as also the case with jupyter notebooks, if I am doing an analysis and I run a cell which updates a variable itself in a self-referential way, without forgetting to run the cell where it was initialized, I get the wrong output. Is there a way to make sure one if I run an src block that depends on another src block, that the dependent src block will run before the one that I am currently running. I realize, I would need to manually tie these together. I feel like something could be done w/ the preamble attribute and writing an elisp function that just runs another src block, but I don't know how that elisp function would look. As an MWE, I imagine the functionality kind of looking like...
 #+name: initialize #+begin_src python x = 5 #+end_src #+begin_src python :preamble (call_src "initialize") x+=1 #+end_src 
 I tried...
 (defun call_src (name) (org-babel-goto-named-src-block name) (org-babel-execute-src-block)) 
 but it seemed not to load the variables before running the cell (possibly because I am using Jupyter-Emacs w/ asynchronous src blocks). 
 Any help is appreciated. Thanks.

 also the official ones don't mention in the description what version they cover. 
 Is this about ZIO2? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsTIcHxJMeQ&t=1s

C-n, C-p, C-a, C-e, C-f, C-b etc. 
 I have absolutely no clue why this should be the case, what I may have installed and forgot about, or how to go about finding out what's going on. I assume there is an embarrassing and simple explanation that is hiding in plain sight? Thanks in advance for the pointers!

 I am newcomer to both Emacs and C++ so please be patient. I am trying to set up eglot + clangd. I have this in my config:
 (require 'eglot)
 (add-to-list 'eglot-server-programs '((c++-mode c-mode) "clangd"))
 (add-hook 'c-mode-hook 'eglot-ensure)
 (add-hook 'c++-mode-hook 'eglot-ensure)
 and I have followed the instructions at https://clangd.llvm.org/installation and have version 12.0.1-19ubuntu3 of clangd installed.
 The project I am working on right now is compiled using CMake so I have also created "compile_commands.json" succesfully using cmake -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=1 which should be loaded correctly as the *Eglot stderr* buffer gives me "Loaded compilation database from ...."
 However, several definitions using xref are not working, I just get "No definitions found for: LSP identifier at point", and when I try to eglot-rename a variable I get "jsonrpc-error: "request id=85 failed:", (jsonrpc-error-code . -32001), (jsonrpc-error-message . "Cannot rename symbol: there is no symbol at the given location"), (jsonrpc-error-data)". 
 Can somebody guide me in how to properly set up eglot + clangd or help me figuring out what is wrong?
 Thanks a bunch!

Now I have a problem with the header line: the line is far longer than what my screen allows to display, and I do not want the line to be continued as a second visual line, since it makes the align function useless.
 Instead I want to have to scroll right, in order to see the fields on the right.
 I guess I have to play with a kind of ~fill-column~ or ~auto-fill-mode~ but I do not understand the many finesses of these options.
 is there any visual post (with Screenshots and examples) explaining how to set this right?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey fellow org-mode enthusiasts,
 I'm currently working on customizing my org-mode setup, and I've run into a little snag with Treemacs. I would like to have Treemacs display the #+title:property of my org files instead of the file name in the directory tree.
 I've scoured the documentation and tried various configurations, but I haven't been able to achieve this. Has anyone successfully done this before or has any ideas on how to accomplish it?
 Here's an example of what I mean:
 org code:
 #+TITLE: Project XYZ * My Awesome Project ** Task 1 ** Task 2 
 In Treemacs, instead of seeing "My_Project.org," I would like it to display "Project XYZ" for that entry.
 The reason that i ask for this is that i am using OrgRoam and the file names start with a pretty large id.
 Any guidance, tips, or even pointing me in the right direction would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance!

This deserves to be imitated by scholars. First it should be entered in a book in which I record everything as I see it or as it is given to me in my thoughts; then it may be entered in another book in which the material is more separated and ordered, and the ledger might then contain, in an ordered expression, the connection sand explanations of the material that flow from it.…]]></summary>

This is part of a package I'm writing, so I'm talking about doing this programmatically, in code. My instinct is to use forward-line inside a call to with-current-buffer. My code didn't work and I've isolated the problem -- my call to `forward-line' doesn't do anything. I've tested outside the program and the same thing happens. Try the following code in a buffer other than scratch:
 (with-current-buffer "*scratch*" (forward-line)) 
 It should switch temporarily to scratch, call forward-line and switch back. It doesn't do anything on my machine, even with emacs -q (no personal config file).

2.12: https://tpolecat.github.io/2017/04/25/scalac-flags.html
 
2.13: https://nathankleyn.com/2019/05/13/recommended-scalac-flags-for-2-13/
 
 Has anyone published a list of flags for Scala 3? (Scala 3.3).
 Last time I used Scala 3 (3.0), a lot of options were missing. Has Scala 3.3 bridge the gap?
 I'm planning to try to upgrade one of our projects at work but looking for feedbacks on this before. A lot of these flags are mandatory to get the full power/safety of Scala IMHO.

 I spent few hours checking the job market for Scala jobs in Data Engineering (I'm a Data Engineer). But daaaaaaamn I really thought Scala/Spark was way more a thing! It's really all PySpark now. What a disappointment 😢 Especially with Scala 3, honestly any data engineer who knows Python could easily write Spark job in Scala. 
 Hard to find the motivation to keep learning FP in Scala when the Scala opportunities are so limited. I guess it will teach me FP so that's good. But there's a depressing vibe to it.
 I guess only very big tech companies or banks or companies still relying on a on-premise infra may still use Scala.

It turns out to be quite complicated, so i decided that i would rather invest that time and effort in something like emacs. I tried doom for a few days, but i couldn't get anything near the experience i had in Vim. i couldn't even enable syntax highlighting for the different programming languages i use, so i would like to ask for any helpful resources about how to configure emacs as an IDE, videos, articles, books, well documented configs would be helpful Thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm wondering if it's possible to use dir-locals, projectile, or some other scheme in order to map major modes to certain file types conditionally. Specifically, when working on static site generator projects, I routinely need markdown files to not only use web-mode (which I wouldn't normally use for markdown), but I need web-mode to set its templating language to something specific. I'm not quite sure how to do this. With dir-locals, I'm afraid modifying the auto-mode-alist would leave it in a bad state if and when I move onto a different repo. Meanwhile, projectile doesn't seem to have a clean way to hook into changing project types (unless you do it manually). Any suggestions?

 I realize I can use org-agenda-custom-commands to create canned commands of items in a certain todo state, but I'd like to be able to do it dynamically.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A few days ago my package llm was added to GNU ELPA. This package isn't for end-users, it's for others who are writing llm-based functionality to do so in a way that is agnostic of the llm backend. That way the user can use the LLM they have access to. LLMs are "large language models", very large systems that are able to deal with natural language with surprising naturalness.
 To start, we provide functionality for creating embeddings, and for LLM chat, in both sync and async versions. There are only two providers to start with: Open AI and Google Cloud Vertex. There's obviously more that are possible, such as Anthropic's API, or Llama 2.
 The difficulties with providing an interface to Llama 2, by the way, is that there seem to be a lot of different ways to install and use it, so it isn't clear that there's a good interface I could provide that would be widely useful. But it's pretty easy to write your own, and maybe I'll provide an interface that just goes to some command-line utility and executes it.
 If you are an author of a package that does something with LLMs, I'd encourage you to use this package, so your users can have some control of what backend they are using. And if you want to help expand the number of LLMs we have access to, please send a pull request if you have FSF papers. This is a GNU project, so FSF papers are required for substantial contributions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[MisTTY is a major mode for Emacs 29.1 and up that runs a shell inside of a buffer. It is built on top of term.el. It is available on MELPA. Check out its project page at https://github.com/szermatt/mistty.
 Such a buffer feels very much like comint mode: you can move around freely and run any Emacs command you want - until you press TAB and end up with the native completion or notice the shell autosuggestions. With MisTTY you have access to both Emacs and the shell commands and editing tools.
 Additionally, commands that take over the entire screen, such as less or vi also work, temporarily taking over the window, while scrollback remains available in another buffer.
 MisTTY works well with Bash and ZSH, but it is especially well suited to running the Fish shell; you get autosuggestions, and completions in full colors.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[hello guys, its me ya boi again 
 I'm new to Haskell and this subreddit. I was reading Learn You a Haskell and stumbled across this operator -: here, 
  
Haskell ghci> landLeft 2 (landRight 1 (landLeft 1 (0,0))) (3,1)  When we apply the function landLeft 1 to (0,0) we get (1,0). Then, we land a bird on the right side, resulting in (1,1). Finally two birds land on the left side, resulting in (3,1). We apply a function to something by first writing the function and then writing its parameter, but here it would be better if the pole went first and then the landing function. If we make a function like this: haskell x -: f = f x  We can apply functions by first writing the parameter and then the function: haskell ghci> 100 -: (*3) 300 ghci> True -: not False ghci> (0,0) -: landLeft 2 (2,0)  By using this, we can repeatedly land birds on the pole in a more readable manner: haskell ghci> (0,0) -: landLeft 1 -: landRight 1 -: landLeft 2 (3,1) 
  
according to my expert research at this point in time there was no pipe operator in Haskell, so I looked up and found this page.
 here two operators are mentioned -: and :-, used together, could allow us also use expression in infix notation, instead of just functions.
 I checked in ghci and there are no such operators available. are these old operators that were removed? what's their story?

Dark them with black background
 Predominantly white text
 Fairly high contrast, but with a subtle colour palette
  
I find a lot of dark themes are either low contrast, or the colour palette is mainly based on simple bright primary colours which I personally dislike.
 Anyone use a theme that sounds like it might fit the bill?

 I was using GHC and a Makefile to compile and run and making a new file for every "day". Eventually I wanted to use splitOn so I made a cabal project. Then I found out it automatically loads your modules into the repl with cabal repl which is sick. 
 Unfortunately I'm trying to work in modules/day3.hs and import rund3 to Main.hs and run it. However Cabal can't see my non exported functions inside modules/day3.hs. this is a bit unfortunate.
 Solution I can think of is working inside Main then transferring to a different file when I'm done but maybe there's a totally different set up that works better?

 I have a Java and Python background.
 I used Scala before to develop Spark jobs. That being said I haven't dug too deep into the FP aspects of Scala.
 I'm planning to learn more in-depth about FP in Scala.
 After I understand the FP basics, would you recommend I dive into cats or perhaps it's advisable to have some experience with "native" Scala first before digging into Cats or ZIO?
 I have no clue how overwhelming those libraries can be for a developer with very limited experience with FP. 
 Thanks again!

 It uses a PPX macro which reads the raw SQL string before compilation and asks Postgres server for the data type which will be returned when the SQL would actually be executed. This way OCaml knows the return type of each SQL query even if they are just pure SQL.
 Is there anything similar for Scala? I searched quickly for Scala SQL libraries but they don't seem to provide both raw SQL usage and high type safety.

 About 75% of my configuration was plain sailing. Most of the remaining 25% is related to completions. 
 One massive problem I have is the *completions* minibuffer. I hate it. 
 I don't want a minibuffer for completions. I'm trying to bend company to my needs. But the *completions* minibuffer pops up anyway. And when it does, it is very intrusive. It changes the layout of my frames. And when I make it go away, the buffer that I'm working in is repositioned. 
 At the moment, it is the bane of my workflow. I'm working on a complex set of problems that require a lot of focus. And having my frames re-arranged unpredictably messes with my head. 
 My understanding is that the *completions* minifbuffer can't be removed. Is there a way to prevent it from being invoked?
