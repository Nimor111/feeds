 I've been working through "Haskell Programing from First Principles" for the last few months. I'm about half way through the book and I Just finished my first real program. I just wanted to say thank you to the community for being so helpful and maybe get some feedback on my code. I'm sure I could clean up a lot of things.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I understand this might be an odd question, I am just trying to research the idea that if a blockchain (e.g Cardano) uses Haskell in building its Dapps, would the Haskell community, language syntax and its libraries allow an average joe programmer to build blockchain Dapps easily and in a short time ? So my question is since I have used Laravel framework before, does Haskell have some tools/frameworks for start ups that abstracts the background work into easy to do steps to set up for example authentication, Database, etc.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In several projects, I've needed a way to implement remote procedure calls. What do people use for this, or is this something that's mostly missing in the community? Hackage has a variety of libraries but they're either very old or seemingly unmaintained. The only one I see that's maintained is grpc-haskell.
 Anyway, grpc-haskell uses proto3-wire instead of proto-lens (which the community seems to have settled on as the best solution). This leads to its own confusion.
 I could use something like warp + servant (or warp + wai to reinvent the wheel), but servant is missing some major functionality for this purpose. Namely, servant is focused on REST, which means the transfer of an entire object state. One of the things I want from an RPC system is the ability to stream data in a type-safe manner (like gRPC does). 
 Any thoughts? I'd prefer something standardized.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[2022-02-12  I haven't touched Booker's current book Seven Basic Plots for a few weeks because I wanted to concentrate fully on the second edition of the notebook method. Today, I sat down to the book again. In doing so, it took me about 2h to get back into the subject matter enough to reach my usual level of productivity.
 That's two hours I didn't work at "optimal operating temperature".
 The reason it took me so long is related to the depth of the material. But there are additional requirements beyond the book. I have to orient myself in the appropriate section of the notebook and load peripheral knowledge into my working memory. Also, I've been working in a completely different mode for a few weeks: Seven Basic Plots is a blend of science, psychology, and spirituality. The subject of the slip box, on the other hand, is merely factual and aimed primarily at immediate use.
 In some distant future, I would like to conduct an empirical study on this issue. (Do you know some empirical knowledge?)]]></summary>

 then we can call this with nZipWith nat2 (+) [1,2,3] [4,5,6].

"TAB in new empty entry: In a new entry with no text yet, TAB cycles through reasonable levels." 
  
Is that different than the normal tab cycling? I can't find that TAB does anything different anywhere, other than normal cycling to me, but maybe I don't understand the context ("in a new entry with no text") or my org file is still too simple to demonstrate this function?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to write an implementation of the tabu search algorithm. Basically local search with a tabu list of recently visited states.
 To do this I need to mess around with parts of Haskell I have never touched before. Type classes.
 I want to generalise the algorithm to the point that the data that the algorithm operates on is completely invisible to the algorithm itself. Like a java interface I want something I can attach to an object type and say "this object is now compatible with this search algorithm".
 class TabuSt a where evaluate:: a -> Int type ST = (Int, [Int]) instance TabuSt ST where evaluate x = 0 
 That's a toy implementation. I define the type class TabuSt. I define a type alias ST. And I define the instance of the type class. I also define a function evaluate that takes a state and returns an integer evaluation of the state. Note that it does not compile.
 This is the error message "tabu.hs:12:10: error: • Illegal instance declaration for ‘TabuSt ST’ (All instance types must be of the form (T t1 ... tn) where T is not a synonym. Use TypeSynonymInstances if you want to disable this.) • In the instance declaration for ‘TabuSt ST’"
 Why does this not work?

automatically adds paragraph indents to new lines when I press Enter but doesn't indent the entire text block (like in Scrivener, word, etc.)
 Formats it nicely like a fiction novel when I export it to pdf
  
I would like it to look like Composition mode in Scrivener or in Manuskript (I tried Manuskript but found it very slow, so I moved over to Emacs). I've tried almost every built-in paragraph/indent mode, Olivetti, and Writeroom Mode, but none of them seem to work.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all,
 I'm new here and to emacs, so sorry if I'm asking a repeated question or something just not acceptable for some reason.
 I've used vim for many years and then neovim for about two years. I am/was very happy with neovim's current state of plugins, ecosystem, lua configuration and vi's philosophy on editing text.
 However I've reached a point where I 
 A) have become very interested in lisp languages and
 B) realized that I would like a much more flexible and complete computing environment that goes beyond my text editor. 
 Funnily enough this problem was solved many years ago by the dark side (just a joke 🤣). So I'm pretty excited to dive into Emacs, learn all about it and I know today its exactly the tool Id like for the rest of my computing career.
 I wanted to ask however to other emacs users, especially ex-Vimmers if readily slapping evil on emacs to make myself comfortable (at least on the text editing side) can hinder me from learning all the ins and outs of emacs?
 I have grown very accustomed to vim's text editing experience. Its so precise and short. I'm very used to changing text with up to 3 or 4 keystrokes to a precision that is very hard to get out of. I mean this in the best of ways, I really like Emacs and am having a lot of fun learning it. I'm just asking to better understand how I should go about this. I'd imagine that the text editing part is such a minor attribute of the power of Emacs and what its capable of that maybe it wouldn't make a difference how one chooses to edit text.
 Thanks in advance 👍

 The second section shows 10 "basic" examples using lexical-binding, lambda, defun, let, lexical-let, setq and defvar.
 And the third section shows a more advanced example using lambda, let, dolist and defun.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Greetings,
 I'm using Emacs-IPython-Notebook with Elpy. It was a struggle to find the right documentation to get an initial setup up and running, but, I finally got these tools working, and I'm very happy now that I can develop Jupyter Notebooks in Emacs.
 Anyways, my question has to do with being able to run Python/JavaScript Widgets in Emacs, specifically in Emacs-IPython-Notebook(and emacs-jupyter as well). I did try last year to run pywidgets in EIN, but it did not work. Anyways, I was reading a article in r/emacs a while back(I can't find it anymore, lol) about Emacs now being able run browser widgets. So that'd be great to get that working, so that I can run browser Widgets in Emacs.
 Could any of you enlighten me on this issue?
 Thanks in advance for the help.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have started using org mode to author my site, and it most works without a hitch, except I miss a few things from HTML, mainly
 I would like a way to define folds, In html, Its:
 <details> <summary>Fold Title</summary> Thing to be folded </details> 
 But I don't know how to achieve that in org, as far I know I need to define my own markup and then tell org how to export to html? but I dont know elisp or org all that well, I only started using emacs a few weeks ago 
 and another is being able to <mark>Content</mark> to highlight it, like with drawing a box or using a highlighter on paper 
 If anyone could help, that would be much appreciated, This is on emacs 29 and org 9.5

 Running M-x grep and then changing that command to use git grep instead of regular grep works for displaying the results, but when I do wgrep-change-to-wgrep-mode, it won't let me modify and save the results.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
I'm new on the forum but been reading the articles and the forum since I discovered ZK not long ago. I love it and it already changed my life and the way I work and the way I see what I do. I find the philosophy of it life changing.
Anyway, I have a question I can't find the answer too.
Quite some times I read articles that provide a step by step for something, and acronym immediately useful. I don't see how I can "put it in my own words". I could but I feel like it's spending time on stuff I really do understand and use. It's more like reminders of processes than "knowledge". The subject fits already into my train of thoughts and the stuff I'm working on.
What do you do with that kind of notes ? Do they go into the permanent folder ? Do they stay as some kind of literature notes ? How one would find those reminders / process / short tips in a ZK ?
Thanks]]></summary>

 Hi! I upgraded to org-roam v2 about two months ago after using v1 for a few months before that. I felt org-roam-server quite useful primarily for visualizing which ideas link to which others. However, I haven't felt the same introauitiveness with org-roam-ui (the server counterpart for v2). And the graph always seems too cluttered and rather difficult to use for purposes of idea-link visualization. Has anyone else felt this? Is it just a matter of getting used to?
 PS: org-roam-ui certainly is useful for checking nodes and obtaining a visually appealing overview of the personal knowledge base. But something feels off. I wonder if it is related to different coloring algorithms, wherein org-roam-server seems to color "daughter" nodes close to the parent node, especially if the parent node is a "hub", whereas org-roam-ui seems to use no such heuristic. Just a guess!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Using Manjaro Cinnamon.
 So a few weeks ago, I built Emacs with support for background-only transparency (it's awesome btw). The build was a little buggy, but after building, I decided to install it using 'make install' - having followed some comments on this sub and elsewhere that the side-by-side install would work, since the default directory would be my 'local', separate to where Arch puts pacman packages (where my normal Emacs is) - for safety I used the prefix option and called it 'TRANemacs'.
 But the background-only transparency emacs remained a bit buggy so I decided to uninstall using 'make uninstall'. Upon running my normal emacs, everything seemed to work normally except that the Cinnamon task bar shows an empty icon where the Emacs logo should be. Further digging shows that emacs has a logo, but emacs-client (which I guess is what gets started) doesn't. I reinstalled emacs with pacman but there is no change.
 Further to that, worth noting that it seems like 'make uninstall' did not cleanly remove everything related to TRANemacs, but I don't think the files left behind (e.g. the site-lisp folder) are very important.
 I'm not great at solving this sort of problem. Might anyone know how can I return the logo to emacs? And how do I prevent multiple emacs installations from clobbering each other in future?

 ​
 I have a number of latex export classes defined in my init file like so:
 ``` (add-to-list 'org-latex-classes '("my-landscape" "\input{/home/user/.config/emacs/tex/class-my-landscape.tex} [NO-DEFAULT-PACKAGES] " ("\section{%s}" . "\section{%s}") ("\subsection{%s}" . "\subsection{%s}")))
 ``` As you can see, I include another tex file as a preamble and that works quite well.
 However, I would like to get to work on a landscape A4 multiple column class and for this it is suggested one uses \usepackage{multicols} in the preamble, easy enough added to the .tex file. 
 And here is where it gets tricky, one needs to add the line \begin{multicols}{3} after \begin{document} and \end{multicols*} before \end\document}. This is proving to be not trivial to set up for me.
 Does anybody have tips and or suggestions on how to tackle this issue ?
 thx S

This correspondence is known as the Curry-Howard-Lambek correspondence and relates:
  
Haskell types with objects of the category
 
Terms of type A→B with morphisms f:A→B (note the similar notations)
 
Algebraic datatypes with initial objects
 
Type constructors with functors
 
etc
 
  
What are algebraic datatypes in Haskell? (I thought all types, including those types defined by datatype, newtype, or type, and/or those types provided by the language and by the standard library modules, are algebraic datatypes. So I think I was wrong.)
 Is the concept "abstract datatype" the same to all the programming languages?
 How are algebraic datatypes related with initial objects?
 Thanks.

Short scenes of individuals doing crazy complicated physical, artful, skillful /r/nextlevel kind of stuff, interspersed with crazy text on a screen moving around (typical org mode stuff, LaTeX editing, etc.), matrix looking stuff, more individuals performing high precision things, etc. Building up, and then ending with a finale and "Emacs" with logo on the screen. Fade to black. 
 I've read a few posts here and there about the need to get more people into Emacs. They usually focus on "how to change emacs to appeal to a wider audience". I'm not going to touch that subject, but simple marketing can be powerful. When I search google for "Emacs Commercial" I get a grand total of 20 results (none of which is a commercial). Youtube returns zero.
 Surely there's some skillful people out there, passionate about Emacs, who would also like to work on or collaborate on a few commercials? I could see another commercial that has testimonials from people.
 FYI, I'm an emacs newbie, and am excited about learning it. Apologies in advance if this isn't a good idea or if this kind of post doesn't belong here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello.
 I often need to act with Embark not on the symbol or plain value, but rather on the result of its evaluation. For example I'd like to be able to open the value of user-emacs-directory by using embark-act on this symbol. Is there some trick I've missed?
 I tried using M-: after embark-act as it could work as a workaround, but I didn't find a way to make it ask me to edit the resulting expression either.
 Could someone nudge me in the right direction? An info how to force embark to show me an interactive prompt for some commands (like it already does OOTB for some) would be a nice bonus.
 EDIT: It seems the latter is possible by customizing embark-target-injection-hooks (link). I correctly remembered there was a variable directly controlling this behavior but it was removed since then, hence why I couldn't find it anymore.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[People seemed interested in the dnd evironment that i had setup for myself. So, I decided to separated it from my personal config and move it into separate repos. 
 The org file SRD
 The dnd-mode
 The documentation in these is lacking still, but I plan on adding more information about usage. Until then, if anyone would like to try it out they are welcome to ask questions to get up and running. Right now the mode has a dependency on 'org-mode' and 'yasnippet'. It is also expecting that the repos be cloned to your '~' directory by default (you can change it if you want).
 I do not currently have an examaple of a campaign, because I only have paid for campaigns setup for my personal. If anyone wants to provide a small campaign they made I would add it as an example, I sadly don't have one at the ready right now, however. 
 Again, I am happy to answer questions if anyone wants to try it.

 It seems that if you want Org to parse the date you type you cannot interact with the calendar pop up at all, which I find a little frustrating. Is there an easy way to tell Org "forget I scrolled the calendar a bit, use the date I'm typing?".

 It needs to be compatible with the following
  The type of the max_count function should be compatible with one of the following: max_count :: [(a1, [a2])] -> (a1, Int) max_count :: Foldable t => [(a1, t a2)] -> (a1, Int) 
 So far, I have attempted the following code
  max_count [] = error "bad" max_count [x] = x max_count (x:xs) = x max_helper (max_count xs) where max_helper (a,b) (a',b') | length b > length b' = (a, length b) | otherwise = (a', length b') 
 This has not worked in the slightest, and I am at a blank for what to do. Any help is appreciated.

 I am trying to minimize reliance on Rosetta, since I've read nasty things happen when combining x86 and ARM toolchains.

Eventually, I'd like to migrate this project to Cabal, because HLS and Stack don't play well together in test files.

It makes use of the parser of GHC itself, so as to prevent parsing issues that unfortunately some other Haskell formatters have.
Alexander Esgen detailed several improvements he made to Ormolu during his internship in a previous blog post. In turn, this blog post will be focusing on the challenge of formatting infix operator chains in Haskell, which is notoriously difficult and has been my primary goal for the last two months.

Operator chains
Almost all programming languages allow the use of infix operators, especially for the four basic numeric operators, +, -, * and /. Moreover, most of the time, these operators can be “chained” together without parenthe…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[UPDATED: I have modified the example to remove any dependency on external packages.
 I must be misunderstanding something quite basic here, so I'll ask this question in the hopes that someone can spot the error. I may have to dig deeper otherwise, but I'm somehow thinking the issue is fairly superficial and I'm just not seeing it. 
 Consider the following function: 
  (defun my/test-let-fun () (interactive) (let* ((var "Hello")) (print var) (if (bound-and-true-p var) (print "Yes.") (print "No.")))) 
 I add this to my config, and the following happens when I call the function.
  
In the minibuffer, I see "Hello." followed by "No."
  
What I take from this is that (bound-and-true-p var) must be returning nil, since otherwise I should see "Yes." So, I conclude: 
  
The variable var must either be unbound or have a nil value during the evaluation of the body of the let* expression.
 The variable var is bound to a non-nil value, since otherwise, I couldn't get something other than nil as the output of (print var).
  
But these two things cannot be true together!
 Am I misinterpreting what's going on? 
 If I am not, how can this be? Is there some other way to check if the value of a variable is non-nil? 
 Puzzlingly, if I define the function after starting Emacs (by calling eval-last-sexp, say), it works as I expect. (I see "Hello" followed by "Yes.")

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I would appreciate advice about the following. I am currently using Embark, Consult, Orderless (and Marginalia).
 Desired action: I have a current buffer open that is 'A'. I want to switch to a different buffer 'B' (which may be anywhere), but I actually want to search buffer B and maybe copy some results over to the current buffer. This could be using consult-line or occur.
 How I am going about the above: 
  
switch buffer (consult-buffer) 
 
Hit embark-act on the desired buffer (bound to C-. as default)
 
Choose either C-s (embark-isearch) or C and l for consult-line 
 
However - the search chosen above always takes place on the current buffer A. I want to act on Buffer B that I chose in the minibuffer.
 
 My config for these packages is pretty vanilla, mostly borrowed off the README's of these packages with some functions stolen from the authors of the packages.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'd like to have my packages be 'fixed' to a specific version, and furthermore available via cloning my emacs git repository. The latter is a function of the fact that I sometimes work in (Windows) environments where emacs will seemingly not work under the proxy no matter what I try. That's fine, in those environments I don't really need emacs connecting to the internet.
 But then, what package strategy to use? The only one that seems to somewhat fit the bill is Borg: however,
  
It uses submodules, and I reaaaaally don't want submodules. I'd much rather use subtrees to commit in particular packages.
 There is no dependency management via this route whatsoever. I've played around with epkg, but there doesn't seem to be a particularly good way of managing dependencies-of-dependencies, unless I'm missing something obvious?
  
Does anyone else have a subtree leveraging workflow and have a relatively sane way of figuring out package dependencies?

The idea behind the fork is to enable a way to submit and incorporate suggestions for edits and updates for LYAH from the community as Haskell evolves and changes.

 I just want to be able to look at my org-mode files from my phone or tablet. I don't, right now, need to sync my agenda or anything like that -- mostly I just want to check my class notes and syllabus before I start reading to prep for lecture or seminar. 
 All my work files are synced via dropbox, so ideally it would be just a simple file reader that I can set so that org files "open with" that app from the dropbox app. Orgzly doesn't seem to be able to do that, though it's true that I can sync specific dropbox folders and access them from there. But mostly I'm going to be clicking on links, etc, rather than editing, and orgzly isn't ideal for that. 
 So: anyone have a good solution? Thanks!

My only emacs experience was an assembly course that I took many many years back that for some reason required it. Just over a year ago, I think, I started making a move to using org-mode for my to do lists. I started using templates and creating journal entries all in org. Then I moved into using org-roam for my notes at work and that morphed into using org-dailies and time tracking. With org-mode, I started moving all my ideas and things I wanted to remember, lists of books I'm reading or want to read. It goes on and on and it's all organized in one nice neat (well, a little messy but relatively neat) little package. 
 Just wanted to share my appreciation for org-mode (and org-roam!) and for the community!

I'm lately getting ^M characters before the line feed whenever I paste (that is, yank) from certain applications. I especially notice gnome-terminal, and pdf text content copied from evince. Google suggests it's a text encoding issue, but I created a new buffer, confirmed that buffer-file-coding-system is set to utf-8-unix, and also checked that gnome-terminal encoding is set to utf-8 (don't know how to check in evince).The problem still persists. Yank is of course written in C so I can't run edebug on it, and anyway I wouldn't really know what to look for. 
  
Any suggestions for how to track this down? It is relatively new, but I am not sure *exactly* how long it's been going on.
 If I can't fix it, shouldn't I be able to somehow filter the text in the kill-ring so that the "M" characters are removed before being inserted?
  
Thanks everyone!

 So, if I search for "apple banana", I want to find a file where "banana" is on line 1 and "apple" is on line 15. Since pretty much all search tools are line-oriented and/or keep the order of the terms and/or use 'OR' matching instead of 'AND' matching, I came up with a way to do what I want via a series of pipes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My working method is similar to what @pgrhowarth has described here: In short, I always have to refer back to the original sources, in addition to my own ideas and conclusions. And this is not a personal choice, but a requirement of my profession.  But the "output" of a Zettelkasten, as far as I understand it, is a chain of associations of my own ideas, not some kind of source Wiki.
But I need both and more: on the one hand, I need to relate my sources to each other, i.e. "who quoted whom", "who learned from whom", "who wrote letters with whom", etc and all based on the originals. On the other hand, I want to process my ideas and thoughts on quotations, excerpts, themes, etc. in a Zettelkasten. But beyond that, I need to make sure that my Zettel always refer to the sources from which they are inspired.
The question I have is: what is the best way to do this? Do I need two "boxes", one for the verbatim quotes with sources and a proper Zettelkasten for my ideas? If so, how do I connect the two boxes? Or should I do "double bookkeeping" and always write the original quote and source on each Zettel?
To reiterate: I know how a wiki works, and I think I also know how to set up a Zettelkasten; what is not yet clear to me is how to connect these two systems.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I currently develop a little tool in which I would like to provide a temporarily visible help buffer containing cheat-sheet like content. And that content might be actually huge, so the user should be able to navigate the buffer.
 I plan to provide user options how and where that cheat-sheet might be shown (own frame, single windows with restoring current-window-configuration after close, side window left, right, top, bottom). My personal preference would be to open a new bottom window, as which-key does this for keybindings.
 The cheat-sheet mode would org, probably with a minor mode so that it is read only and can be closed with a single keystroke. I even think about using org-view-mode...
 Now my question is, what would be the best way to create and place the buffer? Shall I do it manually using basically split-window? Or is there something usable, probably the *Help*-buffers functionality as an official api? Or is it better to just create and show the buffer and let the user configure how to place it via display-buffer-alist?

 i have started using wucuo for spell checking. my configuration is pretty straightforward
 (use-package wucuo :ensure t :config ;; ------------------------------------------------------------------------- ;; spell checking via `aspell' (setq ispell-program-name "aspell") (setq ispell-extra-args '("--sug-mode=ultra" "--lang=en_US" "--run-together" "--run-together-limit=16")) ;; ------------------------------------------------------------------------- ;; disable spell checking in some major-modes (setq wucuo-spell-check-buffer-predicate (lambda () (not (memq major-mode '(dired-mode log-edit-mode compilation-mode help-mode profiler-report-mode speedbar-mode gud-mode calc-mode Info-mode))))) :hook (prog-mode . wucuo-start) (text-mode . wucuo-start) ) 
 this starts the spell checking as expected, and that works too. however, for source code buffers, i would like to run spell checker on comments only and not on the code itself. how do i do that ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just started learning emacs (macport) about 10 days ago, Avy is the first package I've installed. So I have some questions.
 FIRST QUESTION Was there a particular reason for Oleh Krehel to suggest binding avy-goto-char to C-: instead of C-;? Since C-; doesn't require the shift key, that would be seem to be a preferred binding for frequent navigation. (Perhaps colon C-; conflicts with some other popular binding?)
 SECOND ISSUE He suggests (from https://github.com/abo-abo/avy) possibly setting up default bindings using 
  
(avy-setup-default) 
  
But that doesn't seem to work for me. C-h b C-x o C-s avy fails to find anything.
 THIRD ISSUE [EDIT: ISSUE RESOLVED, THIS IS USED TO INTEGRATE AVY WITHIN AN ISEARCH.] Here's a snippet from the documentation, I don't understand this:
  
(global-set-key (kbd "C-c C-j") 'avy-resume)
 It will bind, for example, avy-isearch to C-' in isearch-mode-map, so that you can select one of the currently visible isearch candidates using avy.
  
How does binding to C-c C-j do anything to C-'? And what is isearch-mode-map? That function doesn't seem to exist in my beginner level emacs. What does avy-resume do? I don't understand any of this.
 FYI This is what I finally put into my .init.el file to get Avy to work:
 ;;; AVY BINDINGS https://github.com/abo-abo/avy ;; doesn't seem to work ;;(avy-setup-default) ;; not sure what this does ;;(global-set-key (kbd "C-c C-j") 'avy-resume) ;; Suggested bindings from avy github docs (global-set-key (kbd "C-:") 'avy-goto-char) (global-set-key (kbd "C-'") 'avy-goto-char-2) (global-set-key (kbd "M-g f") 'avy-goto-line) (global-set-key (kbd "M-g w") 'avy-goto-word-1) (global-set-key (kbd "M-g e") 'avy-goto-word-0)

Since I wanna become proficient in it and eventually work coding in Haskell I want to ask you: - Is there any material you recommend for me to read/watch for making the transition from beginner to intermediate? - I'm mainly interested in data science and I learned about the existence of dhHaskell but I didn't found any beginer friendly project for me to test. Is there any reository of examples to tinker and learn? (I'm painfully non creative when it comes to finding a project) (Edit posted this from my phone and mistakenly post it empty!)

 I'd like to remove comments in a minified css stylesheet, and to do so, I'm curling the stylesheet and trying to regex replace the comments with \/\*(.|\n)*?\*\/; however, while it works with a regex tester, it doesn't work in replace-regexp-in-string. I've noticed that I have to escape the \*, the brackets, and the newline character, but is there any way to escape whatever is needed, without me having to remember to translate a regular regexp to an elisp regexp?
 Thank you kindly for the help!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Background: I'm fairly new to Haskell, I can use the language but I am very unfamiliar with the overall build tooling. I largely just use what is recommended in my work project.
 So I got a new M1Pro. I'm the second on my team to do so. They were able to build everything just fine after some minor adjustments, but I have had problem after problem... and I'm stumped, so I'm turning to you for help.
 The project I'm trying to build is open source (https://github.com/fossas/fossa-cli). When I got this new system set up, I ran the instructions on our HACKING.md page and immediately tried to build. This failed because I didn't have llvm installed, so I brew install llvm'd, symlinked into $PATH, and tried again. This failed due to:
 install_name_tool: error: unsupported load command (cmd=0x80000034) `install_name_tool' failed in phase `Install Name Tool'. (Exit code: 1) 
 My teammate who has the M1 already and I compared notes, and he found that he had installed llvm@12. So I removed llvm and its $PATH symlink, installed llvm@12, installed its symlink, and now it compiles! Yay!
 ... But I can't link. I'm now failing on this:
 Building library for byteorder-1.0.4.. [1 of 1] Compiling System.ByteOrder ( System/ByteOrder.hs, dist/build/System/ByteOrder.o, dist/build/System/ByteOrder.dyn_o ) ar: @/dist/build/objs-29886/ar29886-2.rsp: No such file or directory 
 We found a post where someone had a similar issue (here), but the fix in that issue doesn't help: using ar from binutils causes link errors like this instead:
 Linking dist/build/hspec-discover/hspec-discover ... ld: warning: ignoring file /Users/kit/.cabal/store/ghc-8.10.7/hspc-dscvr-2.8.5-ab243a40/lib/libHShspc-dscvr-2.8.5-ab243a40.a, building for macOS-arm64 but attempting to link with file built for macOS-arm64 
 So I'm kinda lost at this point and hoping someone has tips. If you read this far, thanks for your time!

Does it mean that an instance of Monad is also an instance of Applicative? I was wondering how to see an instance of Monad is an instance of Applicative? Can <*> of Applicative be rewritten in terms of >>= and return of Monad?
 
Is an instance of Monad also an instance of Functor? Can fmap of Functor be rewritten in terms of >>= and return of Monad?
 
 Thanks.

 Although most posts about "cabal hell" seem to be almost a decade old I can't really find if anything has changed to abolish it. The closest I've read is someone somewhere mentioning Nix as an alternative to Cabal; is that Nix as in NixOS? Are people really using a system package manager to manage their Haskell packages, or have I completely missed the point? Separate from Nix, is Cabal good now or should I stay away?

 (package-install 'use-package))
  
currently i have this... but in this, (package-refresh-contents) will basically only ran once EVER - during the initial setup, since that's the only time the system will not have use-package installed. should i perhaps place that line before (unless (package-installed-p 'use-package)? so that it is run everytime when i start up emacs? there's pros and cons to this right? the pro is that, the package cache/info will be up to date everytime and i can just install packages right away through the commands as the package repos will be all up to date already... the cons is that, i doing so, it will dramatically slow down the startup time 'cuz emacs will spend a lot of time updating the package cache right? and this is probably not worth it since we typically want to run package-list-package interactively anyway when we want to look for packages interactively and it will update the cache at that time anyway

 I thought before I set myself into the indentation rabbit hole, maybe someone knows a package or a sipmle setting to set. Up to now I have been using from time to time haskell-indentation-mode but sometimes it screws some other indentation in the relevant programming language and I would really only "need it" for some comma separated special cases.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I read here that defvar only sets the value of a variable if it doesn't already have a value. 
 Then I tried to test it in scratch buffer, but could not verify that. defvar always sets the value no matter what. 
 Did some googling, found some stackover flow answers stating the same. 
 Got quite confused for quite some time. 
 Then decided to read elisp mannal, found this: 
  When you evaluate a top-level ‘defvar’ form with ‘C-M-x’ (‘eval-defun’) or with ‘C-x C-e’ (‘eval-last-sexp’) in Emacs Lisp mode, a special feature of these two commands arranges to set the variable unconditionally, without testing whether its value is void. 
 relieved. Isn't this a bit strange? That it doesn't work the same way when you want to test it out by C-x C-e

 All of these projects come with quaterly reports I have to write up. They include presentations and workshops or conferences. I can delegate some of the stuff, but I have to keep the overview at all times.
 Oh, and I have to keep track of the time i spend with each subtask. 
 So, I am actually trying to do this in orgmode. Has anybody done something similar and can share their insights, experiences or a template?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've recently started playing more DnD and convinced a co-worker to join me in both that and emacs. As a result of this I thought it would be fun to try to create a robust and interactive DnD environment inside of emacs.
 I have been working on my environment for a about three weeks now and have come up with a pretty good org file character sheet layout that uses table formulas to auto calculate everything based of the abilities that are defined.
 I have also been creating function to toggle my session target (a campaign or a character) to switch where my org-agenda and org-captures point so that I can leverage the searching and quick note taking that those provide.
 In addition to that I have been converting the SRD docs that I can find into ORG files that I can also search via org-agenda. Leveraging tags and properties to create queryable resources.
 ​
 I plan on creating a demo of this environment and sharing it, but that will require a decent amount of work. So, I was wondering what the interest would be in this crossover tool, or if people have solutions that they have developed for this.
 ​
 EDIT 1: Screen Capture of Character Creation
 ​
 Sorry, I noticed i missed the mini-buffer on the recording. The only relevant part was the dice roll at the end though for it. I also forgot to show the proficiency bonus column adds the PB as well. 
 ​
 EDIT 2: Searching the org file SRDs
 Sorry for the little windows. The tool I'm using for recording doesn't give me many pixels :|

You should replace the system-name values with what you get when you evaluate (system-name) in your copy of Emacs. 
  
Whats the best way to do that? Use C-h v? Is there another way? 
 Regardless, one thing I'd like to be able to do (just to know if it's possible) is highlight that web text, copy to the MacOS cut-and-past buffer, then in emacs, C-h v and it prompts me Describe Variable:. Is there a way to just paste/yank the name at that point? C-y didn't work before, but now it does, so this use-case is solved.
 In another use-case, suppose I might have the variable name in my emacs buffer/window, with point on the variable name. Is there a way to "send" what's under the point to C-h v for quick inspection?
 Or another way to "evaluate" the variable so that I can see what it is?
 I'm currently using Ido, if that matters. I'm also very new to emacs!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I wrote a program to find the nth prime number between 1 and 100,005, using the Sieve of Eratosthenes. For example, the first prime number is 1, the second is 2, and the third is 3.
 Here's my program:
 -- Get a range of list of numbers from begin to end, inclusive.range :: Integer -> Integer -> [Integer]range begin end | end == 0 = [begin] | begin >= end = [end] | otherwise = begin : range (begin + 1) endcheckNotMultiple :: Integral a => a -> a -> BoolcheckNotMultiple a b = r > 0 || q < 2where (q, r) = divMod b aeliminateMultiplesOfP :: Integral a => [a] -> a -> [a]eliminateMultiplesOfP list p = filter (checkNotMultiple p) listeliminateMultiples :: Integral a1 => [a1] -> [a1]eliminateMultiples list | length list > 1 = head list : eliminateMultiples (eliminateMultiplesOfP (tail list) (head list)) | otherwise = list-- Sieve of EratosthenesgetNthPrime :: Int -> IntegergetNthPrime n = (1 : eliminateMultiples (range 2 100005)) !! (n-1)
 As n increases, so does the time the program takes to access the nth element of the list. Why, and what can I do to make this not true?
 Hazarding a guess: Maybe GHC is smart enough to realize that it shouldn't run eliminateMultiples on the entire list, despite what the code says, because I really only care about one element of the resulting array.
 EDIT: I should clarify that I don't count a number as a multiple of itself.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi haskell folk, thought I'd share this with you.
 For a workshop I am planning I want to ensure that everyone has a quick haskell development setup available, so I created a simple docker image based on haskell's official image. This one includes code-server as a vs-code web IDE.
 The image can be found on docker hub and launched like so, assuming $PWD/code is where your haskell projects are: docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 -v $PWD/code:/exercises arnemcnuggets/hs-workshop Notice that the default directory (currently /exercises) can be adjusted by changing the entry-point cmd (currently it's code-server --auth none --bind-addr 0.0.0.0:8080 --user-data-dir /data /exercises).
 You can then navigate your browser to localhost:8080 and start programming haskell with linting, type hints and formatting.
 The environment is, of course, by no means to be used in production but rather for education.
 This is kind of the first docker contribution I made so feedback is welcome!
 Edit: it comes with dark-theme (my eyes) and the haskell vs-code extension preinstalled for extra little configuration.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just playing around with a tiny project, I've found that using HSpec with cabal repl would be really really nice. You could call main to run all the tests, or call hspec XyzSpec.spec to run just the tests you currently care about.
 Problem is that GHCi can only load one component at a time. That means I can't do :r to reload code changes that aren't in the test component. If I'm changing library code, then restarting the repl from Cabal all the time isn't convenient as it is slow.
 As a hacky solution, if I add the library's src dir to my test's hs-source-dirs then it works really nicely. Things reload very quickly. But once you start needing build dependencies in the library, you also need to add them to the test project. This starts to feel a bit messy, build tools for other languages don't require hacks like this.
 Is there a better way to do this? I know there's stack test --file-watch but this is very slow. I'm looking to to make tiny changes rapidly, and the time it makes you wait while it builds the project over and over is inconvenient when compared to the instant reloading in GHCi.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is the first production release of Scalqa project. 
 Scalqa was first introduced on Reddit last summer with the "Scala3 Quick API" post. Few more discussions followed:
  
Perfect Int Loop
 Perfect Time Library
 Boost data processing speed with heavy ops
  Void Request Pattern
  GUI Could Be Easy
  Creating New Numerical Types
  
So the feature set was pretty much complete long time ago and it took many months to refactor, refactor, and refactor. At this stage there are no good ideas on how the project can be improved any more, so it is time to stabilize the code base. From now on the future releases will be binary compatible with version 1.0 and any large changes will be rejected unless absolutely necessary.
 Maintenance wise, based on experience, I expect to spend from 1 to 4 hours a week to fix any incoming bugs and make a new release every 1-3 months. Otherwise, I will move on to invest/trade markets full time, using Scalqa as enabling technology. But, I am standing by to devote all my energy back to Scalqa if needed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, 
 I'm using LSP-mode for C++ and I can't find how to pass arguments to clang-tidy. It's annoying because I'd like to use C++17 functionalities which flycheck flags as illegal (though they are not). 
 My config does have (lsp-clients-clangd-args '("--clang-tidy")) but I don't know how to pass arguments to clang-tidy, through clangd.
 Any combination I could think of, of '("--clang-tidy --std=c++17"), '("--clang-tidy" "--std=c++17"), '("--clang-tidy -extra-arg=-std=c++17"),... failed. 
 I thought about using a .clang-tidy file instead but there's no example of such a file in the clang-tidy docs. 
 Any help would be appreciated! 
 P.S: This issue can be reproduced with any post C++17 feature, such as std::optional.

 Here is my summary. Video is of 15 minutes.
 Button is a metaphor for shortcuts. You always wanted a big red button to launch something based on the context. Hyperbole makes that possible. Buttons are both for novice and experts. And probably helps novice to become experts by learning more about Emacs.
 Buttons can be created in personal button file (~/.hyperb/HYPB), directory specific button file (HYPB), in the current buffer (org, python, any other). Location of the button defines how they can be accessed. For exampl…]]></summary>

 We have IO, which encapsulates IO operations like read, write, open, close on the filesystem or network layer, but it would be nice to have something similar to resource management and deterministic memory allocation tactics.
 Rust goes in that direction, but is further away from the functional paradigm.

 Today such surprise was the podcast "God's Programming Language" with Philip Wadler. https://corecursive.com/021-gods-programming-language-with-philip-wadler/# 
 To my surprise around the 32nd minute, they talk about types. There I learn that the types used in functional programming, despite the same word being used, are not the same as types used in languages that inherit from Fortran. 
 Do you think that tutorials that start with Strings and Integers lead you down the wrong path? How can I tell what is executed at the compilation stage and what is executed at the runtime stage?
 If I were to have another go would I be able to find a tutorial that explains and builds on correct principles?

I have seen helm-occur and it looks great, but from what I've seen it only works on open buffers. So what I'm looking for is helm-occur results for all files in a specified directory.
 I got this working on Dired...well someone else did and yes, I copied it. I'm hoping to replicate the same functionality with Helm...

Unfortunately, it is far from academic literature research which seems to be the classic application of Zettelkasten.
I manage reliability test of semiconductor products. I deal with a lot of interconnected information for product reference and project tracking. For example, a product is made using a certain technology and may have several part numbers using different package types. The same package types or technologies can be used for other products.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've discovered the rather awesome Hydra package, and I like all things about it, except one: I want hydras to function only on keys defined. Easy-peasy... EXCEPT, mouse scrolling should work too, and here I've run into the fact that I don't really know how emacs works. I've seen this is a question on the issue tracker without resolution:
 https://github.com/abo-abo/hydra/issues/390
 I see that as I scroll the mouse, or more accurately touchpad, I get wheel-down/double-wheel-down/triple-wheel-down (or up) and these are all mapped to the same (Mac specific?) event: mac-mwheel-scroll but as expected, mapping all the various mouse events I see in lossage to mac-mwheel-scroll doesn't work. In fact, mapping them even to normal scroll events only SORT of works.
 Anyone have any hints? My temporary "solution" is to just use the hydra that allows for other keys, but that is causing some serious OCD. I was thinking of defining a pre command hook that detects whether I am in a hydra and what the command is, but that seems like a hack if there ever was one. Any suggestions?

(1) What are d1, d2, s, and n in
 d1 (D1 i) = 42 d2 (D2 i) = 42 s i = 42 n (N i) = 42

I've used NameMangler to add unique IDs (based on file creation time) to the start of all the files, so a group of files that looks like this...
Adobe Audition.txt
... gets turned into this...
2020-02-15 083059 Adobe Audition.txt
I then drop this list – thousands of files – into a text document called "UNSORTED FILES.txt" . Then with a grep-based search and replace in BBEdit, the list gets transformed into this...
[[2020-02-15 083059]] Adobe Audition.txt
Now I've got a document I can open and edit in TheArchive, and everything is nicely linked.
But I don't know what's inside Sketch.txt and I'd like to add more details. If I click on the link, the file opens up and I can see it's a comedy sketch I was writing about an inept iPad user. I'd like to add that information to the description in the UNSORTED FILES document, but how do I get back to where I came from? I can see UNSORTED FILES in the search results list, but if I click on it, I have to hunt for the filename I was editing, because there's no cursor.
After clicking a bracketed link, is there a way to return to the originating document, with an active cursor in its previous position?


OR, is it possible to click on a bracketed link inside a document and open it in a new window or external editor?


OR is there another solution for quickly viewing the content of a bracketed link?

 In this post I present an alternative approach to combinator-based implementations that is significantly faster than classical graph-reduction based solutions.
 As this approach makes use of combinators directly implemented as Haskell functions, it is also much simpler and smaller in size than explicit graph-reduction.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've spent a lot of time grappling with the seemingly hard combinatorial problem of working out what combination of bang patterns, INLINE/INLINABLE pragmas, worker/wrapper transformations, compiler options, etc. I need to use to speed up performance-critical parts of my Haskell projects (I mostly write CPU-bound work, e.g. mathematical software). While it's always a relief when I stumble across a combination that gives a massive speedup, it's often not clear to me why certain things make a big difference in some contexts but not in others (especially bang patterns and INLINE/INLINABLE pragmas). This makes me worry that I may just be overfitting my code to the quirks of the GHC version that I'm currently using (currently 8.10.7 on a 64-bit Ubuntu 20.04 machine), and that some of the fruits of my labour will be lost in future when I upgrade. So my questions are: 
  
Has anyone measured and publicly reported the amount of work that it took them to maintain the speed of high-performance Haskell libraries across GHC versions?
 Is there any guidance anywhere on what kinds of performance optimisations are likely to remain beneficial across GHC versions?
  
In case a concrete example would help, I've written a generic foldl' function for linear data structures (lists, pairs of lists, etc.). In a benchmark that I've written for a Wordle solver that I'm working on, I found that I can improve its performance by about 10% by unrolling one recursive call. I then tried unrolling two recursive calls, and the performance was about 8 times worse! So I tried adding INLINE, and the performance was about 16% faster than the original unrolled version. Here's the code for the different versions: GenericFoldl.hs. Is there any good reason for me to think that future GHC versions will continue to make similar decisions about what to inline, so that the performance of unroll2_genericFoldl' won't suddenly plummet after an upgrade?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So today I've found that when displaying a particular window (for what it's worth, it belongs to helpful) I am repeatedly getting an error message:
  Invalid face attribute :family nil 
 There is nothing obviously untoward actually happening, but the error message pops up constantly while I'm navigating in this window, so it's extremely annoying, and I'd love to at least understand what's going on. Especially considering that the likelihood of the bug actually being in helpful is not very high, it's more probable that it's somewhere else in my config -- I've seen it before, just less often.
 By digging through Emacs source, I've been able to find that the actual source of the message is face-attributes-as-vector, a function defined in xfaces.c. Deep in the C code. That's the only place anywhere I can find this error message text.
 Now I'm trying to trace the calls to it to find out just where and what resulted in the nil :family and nothing seems to work, neither trace.el nor Edebug -- it just prints the message and goes off on its merry way. Manually advising it with something to the tune of (defun trace-face-attrs (a-plist) (message "Tracing: %s" a-plist)) (advice-add 'face-attributes-as-vector :before #'trace-face-attrs) doesn't result in advice function getting called either.
 It's like the function isn't actually getting called at all.
 How do I get at the root of this damned thing?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Okay, I can't know what you are looking for, but I myself just wanted a simple way to store email addresses and insert them with completion when composing new messages. BBDB and the like are way too fancy for me.
 It turns out BBDB has a poor cousin, called 'ecomplete'. To activate it, you just need to
 (setq message-mail-alias-type 'ecomplete) 
 Alternatively, if you prefer to use the standard completion-at-point instead of ecomplete's handicrafted UI (works well with Orderless or flex completion styles) you can use the following:
 (ecomplete-setup) (add-hook 'message-sent-hook 'message-put-addresses-in-ecomplete) (setq message-mail-alias-type nil message-expand-name-standard-ui t) 
 (I wish the above was less hacky to get working, but alas).
 This is ridiculously obscure stuff. I could only find ecomplete after imagining the feature and starting to study the places you need to understand to implement it... So I hope this is a helpful hint for some people :-).

 ​
 My ipython console is getting super slow when the buffer is longer than ~10 000 lines (for example when I accidentally print a very long variable). 
 I know C-c M-o runs the command comint-clear-buffer (found in inferior-python-mode-map), which is an interactive compiled Lisp function. And running it manually solves my problem. Now, I would like to have it to run automatically when the *Python* buffer is longer than X lines, but can't find how to do it. 
 One related issue is that I shouldn't run into a long buffer limitation than quickly, i.e. I should prevent very long variables (e.g. long lists) from being entirely printed in the buffer. For instance, when print() is called, I would like to only print the first and last 10 entries of a variable if it is longer than e.g. 100 lines. However, here again, I can't find how to do it...
 ​
 Any help would be much appreciated, thank you a lot in advance! :)

 I wanted to read in a csv file, and convert that into a dataset to perform linear regression on. The condition is that the case class must make X a Spark vector, and Y a double.
 I've been trying a few methods so far, but I cannot figure out how I convert the Int type data in X to Spark vectors.
 I'd appreciate if someone could point me in the right direction.
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The manual for instrumenting macros states that part of the spec can be a symbol:
  
Any other symbol in a specification list may be a predicate or an indirect specification.
 If the symbol has an Edebug specification, this indirect specification should be either a list specification that is used in place of the symbol, or a function that is called to process the arguments. The specification may be defined with def-edebug-spec just as for macros. See the defun example.
 Otherwise, the symbol should be a predicate. The predicate is called with the argument, and if the predicate returns nil, the specification fails and the argument is not instrumented.
 Some suitable predicates include symbolp, integerp, stringp, vectorp, and atom. 
  
From this, it's not clear to me what it means for a function to "process" the arguments. For example, I would like to see if the arguments match one of several specs. Something like
 (cl-dolist (spec my-specs) (when (edebug-apply spec args) (cl-return t))) 
 Is this possible?

 I see I cannot obtain from org as default a behavior quite useful for big files,coming from the mind map world I am quite deluded if cannot find a solution.
 what I would expect:
 Basically imagine I have a huge complex org file with 10 levels of indentation/nesting/nodes. as user I would like to go to an item <XYZ> on let's say level 7, and make gradually expand the item at the 8 level(only from children of <XYZ> not all the org) , then 9 and 10 so that I can have a peek of what information is under that specific part, then go back from 9, to 8 and back to 7, to the original place where i was.
 ​
 What (delusionally) I get:
 is with shift+tab an iteration not useful at all collapsing all the items(?), then back when I am, then expand all the thousands of items I have in my huge org files.
 A remark: I know that few people recommend to make shorter org files separated files, but at the moment I have these huge files( as coming from the mind map world)

I'm sure this is a very common way of working, and surely how TheArchive is designed to work.
But what's the best way to take a group of paragraphs and a heading, and replace them with concise link?
Right now, I follow these steps. 
It works, but I'm wondering if there's a faster approach built into TheArchive, and what methods work to streamline the creation of child documents. Mine seems to take more steps than I would expect, and the Cut operation makes it a bit precarious. A lot of the time, I miss step 7 and paste the text into the search bar. I also worry that I might make a second Copy operation and lose my cut text.
Is there a way to click on a link and force the creation of a new document, rather than  having to search for a nonexistent document then hit Enter to create it?
Is there a safer way to move a block of text into a new document, rather than cut, change documents, paste?]]></summary>

 I am currently setting up Org-Roam and I like to have a note with contact information for people I interact with regularly that I can then link to in every Task that is somehow connected to this person. 
 The linking itself works without any issues, but if I completed a task I tend to archive the task to a *.org_archive file to avoid clutter in my todo-lists. I would still like to see the backlinks to the archived tasks when I look at the note with the contact information, but unfortunately, org roam does not show the task anymore afterwards. 
 Is it possible to configure roam in such a way that it does not only look at the "normal" *.org files but also the *.org_archive files? 
 ​
 Thanks very much in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been using ansi-term for a while, and I recently tried switching to vterm. It looks and works pretty well, but I'm having a problem with how vterm cycles through your command history. In zsh, if you type something and press the up arrow key, you get the last command you used that starts with what you've already typed. This works fine in ansi-term, but in vterm, it just cycles to the last command that was used in that vterm session. I was wondering if anyone knew if there was any configuring that I need to do on either end to get this to behave the same way in vterm as it does in ansi-term.
 ---EDIT--- Editing to clarify that it's specifically the matching of the already typed command that's not working. I can cycle through the history without issue, but sometimes I'm sshing onto a machine, or doing a repetitive task, and prefer to have zsh search for the right command for me.

 I would like to find a file to open, but... 
  
it is in my home directory somewhere, but I don't know where
 I have only a vague recollection of its name and the name of the directory in which it resides.
  
If I were in my terminal emulator, I would navigate to ~, then emacs (or similar) then do a ~fzf~ search for the filename, while mashing in some of the directory name which I can remember. I'd then select the file from the list of suspects.
 What is the best way to get something like this happening with my vertico setup? 
 I like the way the ~ suffix works, I would just like it to go recursive, basically. I can't use helm or ivy, as a package I have to use is incompatible.
 Hopefully this is super simple and I'm just missing something obvious.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In Bird's book on algorithms in Haskell:
  
3.3 Arrays
 One of the main differences between functional and procedural algorithms is that the former rely on lists as the basic carrier of information while the latter rely on arrays. In functional algorithms input usually consists of a list of values, whereas in procedural algorithms input values are usually assumed to be presented as the elements of an array. For a procedural programmer array updates are destructive: once an array is updated by changing the value at a particular index, the old array is lost. In functional programming, data structures are persistent because any named structure may be referred to at some other point in the computation and therefore has to continue to exist. Consequently, any update operation, even at a single index, has to be implemented by making a new copy of the whole array. Because they cannot be changed but only copied, purely functional arrays are known as immutable arrays. It is possible to get round this problem and allow mutable structures by encapsulating the operations in a suitable monad, but we will not introduce monads in this book.
 Wholesale or monolithic updates, on the other hand, are ﬁne. Changing all or some of the entries at one go involves copying the array only once. Haskell provides a number of such wholesale operations in the library Data . Array. The purpose of this section is simply to describe the main functions in this library.
  
What does "wholesale or monolithic update" mean? Does it mean exactly "any update operation, even at a single index, has to be implemented by making a new copy of the whole array"?
 Is a data structure with "wholesale or monolithic update" a mutable or immutable one?
 Does library Data . Array provide mutable or immutable arrays?
 Thanks.

 I have compiled and installed Emacs 28 pgtk.
 When I start Emacs it changes the background color three times.
 First it starts gray, then it turns white and then finally my theme color, which is a dark gray (from Nord color palette).
 My previous version, Emacs 27, honored the .Xresources and would start with the same color of my theme.
 I have tried running 'xrdb -merge .Xresources' before running Emacs. It did not help.
 I am running Emacs inside i3wm, which uses xorg. Everything else runs fine.
 Is it possible that Emacs-pgtk does not honor the .Xresources anymore?
 Do you think it is a bug?

 The documentation explains that it's off by default, but can be enabled. I changed my configuration accordingly
  (use-package org-roam :custom (org-roam-directory (file-truename "~/Dropbox/OrgRoam")) (org-roam-completion-everywhere t) (org-roam-mode-section-functions (list #'org-roam-backlinks-section #'org-roam-reflinks-section #'org-roam-unlinked-references-section )) :bind ( ("C-c n f" . org-roam-node-find) ("C-c n i" . org-roam-node-insert) ("C-c n l" . org-roam-buffer-toggle) ("C-c n s" . org-roam-db-sync) ;; in case you delete a file outside emacs :map org-mode-map ("C-M-i" . completion-at-point) ) :config (org-roam-setup) (org-roam-db-autosync-mode) ) 
 and describe-variable agrees it is configured
 org-roam-mode-section-functions’s value is (org-roam-backlinks-section org-roam-reflinks-section org-roam-unlinked-references-section) 
 but that section never shows up. To test, I made nodes "Scheme", "Emacs Lisp", and "Programming Languages" that explicitly link to each other. I then made another node and wrote sentences including those titles. I tried variations on capitalizations and spacing to see if I misunderstood what would be counted as an unlinked reference. The unlinked references section has never shown up in the roam buffer.
 I saw that it doesn't work in windows, but I'm on mac. I saw several mentions to ripgrep, so I installed it. I tried restarting Emacs a few times, just because. I referenced other people's configuration that have this working.
 It feels like I'm missing something obvious. Do you know what I need to do to get unlinked references to work?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm using Doom Emacs (pretty much vanilla with a few packages) and whenever I save a file, Emacs automatically changes the indentation.
 For example, if I'm editing a C++ file like this:
 application icoFoam; startFrom startTime; startTime 0; stopAt endTime; endTime 20; deltaT 0.05; writeControl runTime; 
 Whenever I save it, Doom Emacs changes the format like this:
 application icoFoam; startFrom startTime; startTime 0; stopAt endTime; endTime 20; deltaT 0.05; writeControl runTime; 
 I tried disabling electric-indent-mode, but it did not work.
 Anydoby knows how can I modify this behaviour? I just want to mantain the original format when saving a file.
 Thanks in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I want to start experimenting a little bit with Scala. I'm a Java developer and I'm using Intellij Idea Ultimate.
 Usually, I use asdf for managing different versions of java, elixir, etc... What is a recommended tool in the Scala world? I see that there is a CLI called coursier. Or should I continue working with asdf? I'm asking this because it seems to me that coursier gives us the option to install additional tools like scalafmt? 
 Also, should I pick Intellij Idea for Scala 3? Any first-hand experience here - I saw a couple of posts over here, but they are a couple of months old, so I'm wondering if the situation is better now, or maybe to try with Neovim + native LSP + Metals?
 ​
 To be honest, I expected that tooling will be much more mature for Scala because it is almost mainstream language :)
 ​
 Thanks in advance for your suggestions.

I have tried excluding packages but nothing helps. Maybe I am doing it wrong. Could someone please help me.
 ​
 here is the complete build.sbt in which i tried excluding the org.slf4j. I believe it is due to this dependency having more loggers. I am sorry for the screenshots but whenever i encapsulate the text in code block it gets all messed up when I post it.

Email Links
I sometimes start a zettel from an idea sparked by an email. I've struggled with citing the email without importing it into Zotero, my reference manager. I recently stumbled on a solution. Using Applescript and Keyboard Maestro, I can now highlight a mail message, execute the trigger, and voila. A properly formed markdown link is placed in the system copy buffer in the appropriate zettel.
They look in markdown like:
[Listen To Your Listening](message://%3c20210906224833.1.344b41185d81efc9b6af0983@mg2.substack.com%3e)
In preview mode or as exported, they look like:

In brief, Trustix is a verification system for binary cache providers, and a tool that allows you to compare those software binaries across independent providers to ensure you’re getting the correct software, but without trusting a single binary cache.
In this post we look at the situation where providers disagree on the correct binaries, and how to aggregate those opinions and decide which output to trust.
This problem comes up in many kinds of decentralized systems, and different solutions have arisen for each use-cases.
We’ll discuss some of these solutions and see that, unfortunately, none of them would work for Trustix.

But, I still feel from time to time as if I am going to end up with another mess full of useless tidbits...
So, my questions are, how do you decide what is important? And, how do you keep from cluttering your ZK?

 Quick description of what's going on: I use LSP and am learning Java right now. Am trying lsp-java (which brings dap-java). LSP works fine with the jdtls server. However, when running any flavor of dab-debug in any Java project I get the following:  Error: LinkageError occurred while loading main class sol.TestRunner java.lang.UnsupportedClassVersionError: Preview features are not enabled for sol/TestRunner (class file version 61.65535). Try running with '--enable-preview' 
 I've changed lsp-java-java-path and dap-java-java-command to another version Java and added the "--enable-preview" argument to lsp-java-vmargs and dap-java-args to no avail.
 As far as I can tell everything related to java is updated to the latest version. Any tips for troubleshooting?

 I just god Eglot working with Company, but, I was wondering if Eglot has equivalent functionality to LSP-UI, like a popup-menu, documentation, and so forth?
 Or will I need enable some extra company feature to get this type of functionality with Eglot?
 https://github.com/company-mode/company-quickhelp
 ^ This extra company-quickhelp package looks useful, but I want to check if Eglot has it's own built-in UI functionality to implement stuff like this?
 Note: I'm transitioning from lsp-mode/lsp-ui to Eglot, so there's a lot I don't know and Eglot is still lacking in the documentation area. Eglot itself seems similar to lsp-mode, but I'm not sure what's the best way to get lsp-ui like functionality working with Eglot?
 I'm confused about this, so I figured I'd ask here.
 Thanks in advance for the help.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a list of type [Integer], called "ints"
 I'm trying to compute the highest integer, that is less than the first element of "ints" divided by some other number "limit"
 For example, if the first number is 20 and "limit" is 2, then the result should be 9, because it is the greatest integer less than 10. If the first number is 21 and the "limit" is 2, then the result should be the greatest integer less than 2.5, which is 2.
 To compute that, I use this expression:
 ceiling (head ints / 2)
 However, doing this gives me this error:
 "No instance for (RealFrac Integer) arising from a use of 'ceiling.'"
 "ceiling" expects a RealFrac, and head ints / 2 returns a Fractional.
 My understanding is that I ought to cast "head ints / 2" to a type that GHC knows how to perform the "ceiling" function on.
 What I'm wondering is, what do I do now?
 As always, thank you in advance for your assistance.

 Error in stage [akka.stream.scaladsl.MergeHub$$anon$2$$anon$3]: Upstream producer failed with exception, removing from MergeHub now 
 In general this error indicates that some exception occurred further upstream in the graph, but there's no indication of what or where in our logs. In particular I found through step-debugging that some TCP connection was reset, but again there isn't enough contextual information to determine where, what or how. It's not even clear if the source is production code or framework code.
 I'm also considering rewriting this without Akka Streams since this is almost impossible to troubleshoot, so I am interested in learning more about alternative frameworks for processing events.

Hopefully the images below help to explain the issue.
 I think I'm using the same language server that vscode uses -- mine is tsserver 0.9.5, from what I can tell vscode uses the same one.
 Any hints? Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So an important part of a lisp is knowing whether any thing is an atom (symbol, number, or empty list).
 However, my parser is being fed a string, so it returns strings. What I need to be able to do is, given a string, determine whether the value it contains can be expressed as an Int, a Double, or just a string, then return the value as that type.
 For example, if my atom function is fed a "3", it should return 3 as an Int. If it gets a "three", it should return "three".
 Is this even possible in haskell? The implementation I'm working off of is in Python, which is dynamically typed, so it's very easy to implement this. However, Python is slow, and I wanted a challenge.

 It was until last year that I've switched from "keeping frequently used link targets on top of each Orgdown file" to "using bookmark.el to store and retrieve frequently used headings".
 Unfortunately, bookmark.el does use bookmark definitions that do often break when the absolute position within an Orgdown file is changed. That happens mostly when I add a substantial number of lines before the bookmark position. When I did get it correctly, this is because its absolute position is changed and the bookmark points to a wrong spot because the context-strings of the definition files can't help any more to fix the exact position.
 There are things like bookmark+ which extend the functionality and versatility. I don't know if they do use a different and more robust bookmark definition.

I know functional programming concepts such as type classes, folds, monads, etc. from programming in Haskell but not sure how to map these onto Scala. What is a good resource for learning about how to use these functional concepts in Scala? I find the docs of the Typelevel libraries to be a bit lacking in explaining what the reasoning is behind design decisions. Ideally something which explains the functional programming theory and then how it gets mapped onto these libraries would be great.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve been learning Haskell for a little bit now and I’ve been slowly understanding functional programming and how to solve problems functionally. I’ve done this mainly by solving problems on exercism.io and reading Learn You A Haskell for Great Good. How can I move on from doing exercises and start doing projects? What are good projects to take on as a beginner Haskeller? I’m only up to the IO section in LYAH so do I need to learn about Monads or something before I can do anything useful? Not really sure what the best path would be. Hoping someone can help me out. Thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[From the outside, it looks like these two libraries do similar things in roughly similar ways. Do people know of important differences? Semi-relevant context: I've been using MemoTrie to write a HasTrie instance for 
 FreeT f m Void 
 This worked, with:
 ​
 ```haskell
 instance (HasTrie (f b), HasTrie a) => HasTrie (FreeF f a b) where
 newtype (FreeF f a b :->: c) = FreeFTrie (Either (f b) a :->: c)
 trie f = FreeFTrie (trie (f . either Free Pure))
 untrie (FreeFTrie f) = untrie f . (\case Free x -> Left x; Pure y -> Right y)
 instance (forall a. HasTrie a => HasTrie (f a)) => HasTrie (FreeT f [] Void) where
 newtype (FreeT f [] Void :->: b) = FreeTrie ([FreeF f Void (FreeT f [] Void)] :->: b)
 trie f = FreeTrie (trie (f . FreeT))
 untrie (FreeTrie f) = untrie f . runFreeT
 ``` 
 but in the process I started to wonder if generics could derive this, maybe using representable-tries, or if there was some other advantage to be gleaned from that library.

Years ago, someone copied a version of melpa into a local directory on the air-gapped server. In my init.el, I setq package-archive to something like (("local-melpa" .

I would like to update my packages on this air-gapped network. I am able to copy files onto the system from a less restricted workstation with internet access. Is it just a matter of unzipping the melpa repo and pointing package-archive to the fresh melpa directory?

 Quick question,
 What is the correct way to add python-mode to company-backends, so that Eglot can find python-lsp-server?
 Note: I'm using use-package.
 Also, when Eglot attempts to load python-lsp-server, a module pkgs_resources error is thrown?
 I'm not sure if this has to do with the company-backends issue?
 Thanks in advance for the help

 I’ve notice in my place of employment there is even a rule that we’re not allowed to use IOC Containers for dependency management because it’s not the “functional way”
 Is this a common mentality? There are always parts of a large enterprise code base where being strictly functional is impractical in my opinion, hence why scala enables object oriented solutions in these cases. 
 Is this sentiment wide spread? Is that why no one has adapted a Java IOC framework for Scala natively (or implemented their own)?

 Right now, I have a config file to display my Exams,
 https://i.imgur.com/UpS58M1.jpg
 (setq org-todo-keywords
 '((sequence "TODO" "EXAM" "|" "DONE" "CANCELLED")))
 ​
 (setq org-agenda-custom-commands
 '(("c" "Show IST EXAMs "
 ((todo "EXAM")
 (agenda "" ((org-agenda-span 31)))))))
 ​
 I would like to have the first part of buffer (ie. Global List of TODO items of type EXAM), sorted by timestamp/schedule.
 And displaying each date accordingly.
 I have tried to change the columns variable, but the result I got was a row on the top, without altering the rest of the buffer.
 ​
 BTW, what is the difference between just adding a timestamp, and adding a SCHEDULED ?
 I have read the org docs about this difference but I do not understand it...
 ​
 Thanks in advance.
 Sorry for my poor English.

 I've setup zone-mode to trigger after some minutes adding 
 (require 'zone) (zone-when-idle 120) 
 to the init file, and it works sweetly to obscure the text and prevent casual snooping... most of the time. Some of the zone modes are quite readable, or very slow to become obfuscated. Is there a way I can setup zone so that it'll always run the same program (for instance, zone-pgm-jitter) or, even betterm, a list of programs I choose?
 I've googled around but I didn't find any pointers to that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello! Is there a list of all the different concepts to learn, required or recommended, to understand Haskell code? My guess is that we can do a lot, including using most libraries, knowing "only":
 ​
  
basic Haskell syntax (functions, lambdas, pattern matching, guards, case, where, let)
 data types (sum, product, algebraic, recursive, polymorphic, records, type synonyms)
 type classes
 referential transparency, high order functions, function composition, currying
 laziness, memoization, tail recursion elimination, strictness, inlining
 module (import and export)
 some actual types (Bool, Text, Int, Float, String) and data structures (List, Maybe, Either)
 some type classes (Ord, Eq, Num, Show, Read, Functor, Applicative, Alternative, Monad, IO, Foldable, Semigroup, Monoid)
 some functions (map, fold, sort, head-tail-init-last, scan, zip, and a few other functions for list manipulation)
 monad transformers
  
​
 What do you think? What's missing?
 ​
 There are so much more, it's overwhelming. Let's see, just from the top of my head:
  
tagless final
 phantom type
 generalized algebraic data types
 arrows
 free monads
 comonads
 lenses (btw, 109 operators in the module… it's never enough apparently)
 continuations
  
And I guess I've only scratch the surface here. I didn't even talked much about the different modules since I don't know them yet. It's been months that I learn Haskell, and each time I learn something, I find another concept. I didn't even take the time to read modules doing actual stuff. What's the minimum to be comfortable writing efficient, idiomatic code?
 Thanks!

a banner image on top of centered text in a buffer (a la certain Notion notes like this), which I thought (in my limited elisp experience) might be achievable via (put-image) and somehow not centering only the first line of the buffer.
 centering quotes or LaTeX align blocks inside Org documents
  
I'm curious as to whether this is even possible, although I'm entirely open to any other ways of trying to implement this that don't involve varying margin lengths throughout a buffer.

 I am a new user of Emacs (Following system crafters stuff no less). I am trying to use Emacs for writing fantasy books / Novels. However all the information ive seen has been so disparate that I cant find anything good on how to actually do it.
 ​
 I know ORG-mode is the go to mode for this but I haven't seen much on how to actually convert said mode into epub or mobi or etc. So far Ive only really read ramblings on what you "could" do and not how to do it.
 ​
 Does anyone have any specific website I may be able to look at? Am honestly unsure which subreddit this is supposed to be under
 ​
 Tl:dr Assistance on how to use emacs to actually write with. My eyes are going blind from googlefu.
 ​
 Post post - Compiled list of stuff:
 One can use Pandoc to convert from Org to Markdown and then fix that towards a good pandoc for E-books (no information on how to do that well on this thread nor is it emacs specific)
 https://github.com/kawabata/ox-pandoc can be useful for going org to other associated
 Using Org and Latex is another way (most likely the best for conversion)

I know TheArchive uses Markdown, which treats indented text as a code block. But I would like to indent paragraphs to show a hierarchy of ideas. Paragraphs often contain tags (either web links or TheArchive's own bracketed links), and if the paragraph is indented, the links stop being active. (As a writer, code blocks have very little use to me.)
Is there a way of turning off the default "code block" formatting when indenting a paragraph with tabs?

I've been using it for about two weeks now I found its far from what Intellij Idea offers as of now. So many things won't work in VS code especially with Scala 3 for example,
  
Metals frequently hangs and so is the compilation, run button on test classes disappears etc. 
 Cannot evaluate any expression in debug mode (see here), this is an extremely important feature I use in Idea (especially given that Scala has a very compact syntax structure)
 Autocomplete won't work for Scala 3
 No shortcuts for creating Test class stub from the main class (Intellij idea does it quite nicely, even creating necessary packages under 'test' directory) 
 No option to run test cases at an individual level (currently only at a class level its supported)
  
etc. 
 If all issues like above gets fixed then I guess the VS Code would rock

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to embrace the literate programming lifestyle for everything, especially for my dotfiles. So far, I have successfully managed to convert all my configuration files and custom shell scripts into Org files that tangle into the proper file formats, but I have been unsuccessful in doing so for my custom snippets. I have several snippets meant for Org-mode, an example being a file with its content being the following:
 # -*- mode: snippet -*- # name: user-config # key: uc # -- #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle user-config.el $1 #+END_SRC 
 The snippet will create a source block that will tangle its contents into `user-config.el'. The problem with this is that I cannot get such a file out just by doing what I normally do to tangle files. I tried the following:
 #+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle test.sh # -*- mode: snippet -*- # name: user-config # key: uc # -- #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle user-config.el $1 #+END_SRC #+end_src 
 I tried to distinguish the real source block from the one that I wish to be exported literally by using indents and different capitalisation but the file I get by tangling this is
  # -*- mode: snippet -*- # name: user-config # key: uc # -- #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle user-config.el $1 
 It clearly cuts off at the first #+END_SRC block. It's not a crippling issue but seeing how I have a whole directory of non-Org files in a repository of only Org files is quite uncomfortable. Does anybody have an idea how I can go about this awkward limitation?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm using these two amazing packages for my completion set-up. Here's my config for them:
 (setq corfu-auto t corfu-quit-no-match t corfu-quit-at-boundary t) (setq completion-styles '(orderless) completion-category-defaults nil orderless-component-separator "*") (add-hook 'minibuffer-setup-hook (lambda () (setq-local orderless-component-separator " "))) 
 Basically this means that for in-buffer completion, the * character is used as separator for substrings, and for minibuffer completion this character is SPC instead.
 I really cannot understand how anyone would keep corfu-quit-at-boundry to nil, plus SPC as the default component separator. Writing code like this is hell, every time I press space after defining a new variable, corfu keeps searching for an existing variable instead.
 The problem with my configuration is that * is sometimes (e.g. in php-mode) seen as a non-word character and therefore completion stops after inputting it. Is there a way to add * to the character list considered to be a word? For example, this setup does work in shell-mode.
 Thanks a lot in advance!

        <updated>2022-01-31T09:30:33.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello Zettelkasten friends,
I've made a few packages for working with my archive in Emacs, and thought you might like to take a look.
The general package, "zk," is a basic set of functions for working with notes -- creating new notes, creating links, finding backlinks, renaming, searching, etc. It uses only built-in features of Emacs --- so no external dependencies. And it can be extended and modified in all the ways that Emacs can be extended and modified. My thought is that it could provide a baseline for people to fork and craft a set of functions to their own liking.
It just became available on Melpa and you can see a demonstration here: https://youtu.be/BixlUK4QTNk
The other package is called "zk-index," offers two additional interfaces for browsing your notes.
The "ZK-Index" interface is a persistent listing of notes, in a dedicated buffer, that can be sorted (by date of modification or creation) and narrowed down by title or note contents.
The other interface, called "ZK-Desktop" (included in "zk-index"), offers a way of working with smaller selections of notes, for specific projects for example. You can select notes from the index to "send to the desktop," where you can arrange them however you want, add commentary about the arrangements, etc. Like working with notecards on a desktop.
You can see a demontration of the index and desktop features here: https://youtu.be/7qNT87dphiA


Note that "zk-index" is still a work in progress, so it's only available in the dev branch of the zk repository. But it's been working for me, so if you give it a shot and have some notes, please let me know, either here or in Github Issues!
On compatibility, "zk" is fairly configurable, so it should be able to work with your current archive, maybe with a little configuring. I started my own note-taking using "The Archive," and the format of my notes and hasn't changed at all, so these packages should (I hope!) work with your existing archive.
Let me know what you think!]]></summary>

 I understand the imperative languages require explicit "control flow", which is "the order in which individual statements, instructions or function calls of an imperative program are executed or evaluated." (wiki)
 However, the central axiom of category theory is compositionality of morphisms, but then more subtly the associativity of composition. In other words, order doesn't matter. You can compose all these functions without worrying about which order they need to be glued together.
 Is that what makes FP so special?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm pleased to announce cleff, a new extensible effects library for Haskell: https://github.com/re-xyr/cleff.
 These are some key features of this library:
  
It has an API similar to polysemy and freer-simple, i.e. you can write effect interpreters as simple case-splitting functions. This means effects are low-boilerplate, easy to understand, and that users of similar libraries can easily get along with cleff.
 It supports higher-order effects implementation, and provides a set of easy-to-use combinators for that. The expressiveness of these combinators are on par with polysemy's Tactics language, and also harder to use incorrectly.
 It uses a ReaderT IO monad as the underlying Eff monad implementation, instead of free monads. 
 Therefore, the overhead of effects is reduced greatly (and gives pretty impressive microbenchmark results).
 IO-based effect implementations provides good interaction with exceptions and concurrency (no more losing changes to State due to exceptions).
 
  
The library and documentation are already available on Hackage: https://hackage.haskell.org/package/cleff.

What is Luck?
[[202110172020]] 
#Luck    #Determination    #Preparation
I’ve heard luck defined as simply being well prepared (through hard work of various types) when opportunity comes knocking. I like and believe that definition, particularly because it removes luck from the realm of the mystical.
So then, you might ask, isn’t it just luck when opportunity comes along?  The simple fact is that opportunities always come along. One just needs to be prepared, then patient and persistent (even tenacious), and finally discerning to recognize the right opportunity.  So, you see, luck isn’t the first step nor is it the driving force - it’s rather t…]]></summary>

 I have installed Microsoft’s python-language-server on NixOS, by adding python-language-server to configuration.nix.
 Then I try to integrate it into Emacs. I copy the following into ~/.emacs.d/init.el:
 ;; Include lsp-python-ms in the configuration file: (require 'lsp-python-ms) (setq lsp-python-ms-auto-install-server t) (add-hook 'python-mode-hook #'lsp) ; or lsp-deferred ;; initialization (use-package lsp-python-ms :ensure t :hook (python-mode . (lambda () (require 'lsp-python-ms) (lsp))) :init (setq lsp-python-ms-executable (executable-find "python-language-server"))) 
 (1) I don't want to restart emacs for reloading the above added code in ~/.emacs.d/init.el, because I don't want to kill the programs run from a shell inside emacs. Can I select the above added code region , and hit C-x C-e? 
 (2) When I did that, I saw in the Backtrace buffer:
 Debugger entered--Lisp error: (void-function use-package) (use-package lsp-python-ms :ensure t :hook (python-mode lambda nil (require 'lsp-python-ms) (lsp)) :init (setq lsp-python-ms-executable (executable-find "python-language-server"))) eval((use-package lsp-python-ms :ensure t :hook (python-mode lambda nil (require 'lsp-python-ms) (lsp)) :init (setq lsp-python-ms-executable (executable-find "python-language-server"))) nil) elisp--eval-last-sexp(nil) eval-last-sexp(nil) funcall-interactively(eval-last-sexp nil) call-interactively(eval-last-sexp nil nil) command-execute(eval-last-sexp) 
 I was wondering if there is something wrong by Debugger entered--Lisp error? How shall I make the lsp work in emacs?
 Thanks.

 I have global-company-mode set to t in my init.el file. 
 After restarting, if I run M-x global-company-mode the minibuffer responds "global company mode disabled" 
 Then when I run M-x global-company-mode again the minibuffer responds "global company mode enabled" which seems to indicate global-company-mode is enabled when I restart Emacs, but it just doesn't give completions. 
 Once company-mode is restarted, then it runs exactly as expected.
 This isn't a big deal because I don't restart Emacs that often, but it's annoying, and I can't figure out what is wrong. 
 Any suggestions?
 Below are the relevant parts of my init.el file. The entire file can be found here.
 Edit: This is fixed now.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I use emacs for everything from taking notes, OS level tasks like organizing the file system and calculating dinner costs, to programming in a variety of languages. Ido mode helps me in opening files and switching buffers without having to remember the exact filenames. I also use tab bar mode that rolled out with emacs 27 to quickly assess which files are open in a glance. For switching between tabs, I use the tab-bar-switch-to-tab command. While it works well, sometimes I do not remember the exact filename(or the case specific name). It breaks the flow of my thoughts when I have to think about the exact filename. That's why I'm looking for an ido mode equivalent for the tab-bar-switch-to-tab command.
 I am happy with the tab bar mode and I do not want to start using other packages just for this additional functionality. Is there any way to customize the tab-bar-switch-to-tab command to have an ido like completion? If not, is it something that can be implemented and how could I go about implementing that - asking for pointers to start with.

 On top of that I think it's got an active background process running or something, because I can't delete the folder which vscode is open in it's parent.
 I'm just learning scala, but I'm not ALWAYS working in scala, so it's been bothering me so much I just disable the extension, but then it's such a pain whenever I want to use scala.
 ​
 TLDR: Is there any way to disable the auto import? I prefer to do it manually.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone,
 I'm a writer who lives in Germany (12 published novels with Random House), and I started using emacs a year ago and am falling in love more and more. It is perfect for organizing material for my novels, and I even use Mu4e for e-mails by now.
 I would be happy to try to write my next novel with emacs. But there is one thing that just drives me crazy writing prose in emacs, and I wonder whether there is a solution to it. (Olivetti Mode or Writeroom mode do not solve this, regrettably.)
 When writing prose, I don't want to have a blank line between each paragraph, but to have them indented instead. It just looks awkard to me, to have lines of dialogue like this:
 "I met another woman", he said.
 .
 "Who is it?"
 .
 "You don't know her."
 .
 She gave him a furious stare.
 ​
 ​
 It reather should look like this:
 ​
 "I met another woman", he said.
 ..... "Who is it?"
 ..... "You don't know her."
 ..... She gave him a furious stare.
 ​
 (Reddit deletes blank space, I had to put dots there.)
 But the indentation shouldn't be Tabs or Spaces, it should just be how emacs displays the buffer.
 Is there a way to make this possible, a way to write prose without blank lines between the paragraphs and to have the first line of each paragraph indented?
 Formatted text properties like "indent more" insert spaces. Maybe this is the way emacs is made, and there is no way to just visually indent (like in a word processor) without putting characters in the document.
 Thank you so much for any help on this!

 I found this often the case with doc-strings, where conventions such as #123 to reference a bug-report or tags such as FIX, TODO, etc ... make sense to highlight in documentation, but not in regular strings, where only minimal highlighting is useful (escape characters for e.g.).
 The package also has presets for C/Python & Lua (opt-in), so you can have highlighting for Python's escape sequences without having to come up with the regex for this yourself.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Greetings,
 I'm using emmet-mode for web development in Emacs which is going good, but I'm trying to figure out how to add these 2 pieces of functionality:
  
drop-down-menu-list(I already have yasnippet and hippie-expand enabled and combined with my emmet-mode config), But, I have no idea why a drop down menu is not appearing when I start typing while emmet-mode is enabled?
 For example, when I type: html and then press the ctrl-j keybinding, it automatically creates an opening and closing tag and inserts the the cursor between the tag, but most of the time, after doing this I press: Enter to move the closing tag to the next line, then I manually move the cursor at the end of the opening tag and press: Enter again, which creates a gap in-between the closing and opening tag and automatically places the cursor in the gap, correctly indented. So I was wondering if there's a way that I could add this extra functionality to automate this for me, that way I just have to type the name of the tag like: html, then press Enter on an emmet code snippet in the drop-down-menu-list, which will then create the tags, but with the ending tag 2 lines below the starting tag with the cursor indented in between the gap. I hope that I explained this well enough.
 Functionality to be able and press tab to move the cursor between things like tags and strings in html.
  
Example:
  
type: html
 choose emmet snippet from drop-down-menu-list
 automatically expands like this:
  
<html> 
 | (indented cursor automatically placed in-between opening and closing tags)
 </html> 
 Thanks in advance for the help.

 Some notes:
  
Link to repo
 main logic for checking if a candidate word matches a previous guess-and-colors
 some tests for the main logic
 Colors are specified with numebrs: 
 Green: 2
 Yellow: 1
 Black: 0
 
  
Updates (chronological):
  
I learned about hlint and fixed the warnings, thanks to u/sunnyata
 I'm going through the commits in a PR by and thanks to Zij-IT
 Merged the first PR (using foldl, foldr and zip), thanks to Zij-IT
 Enabled Github actions to run the tests on push!
 In progress: Next I will be trying to define a custom union type instead of Char, as inspired by u/r3dnaz's comments. Let me know if you have any suggestions.

 The mathematical operations on them as separate methods, do in principle it should be possible to have numbers of arbitrary length and infinite precision, as Mathematica has it.
 In Mathematica an integer can have a million digits. That would be hard to scroll, so say 10 thousand or 100 thousand digits. Would that be possible in Scala or Java with BigInt or BigInteger?

 When publishing a library to a central location do you publish a fat JAR including your dependencies or just the JAR of your source code?
 If just the source code, when someone integrates the library into their sbt project, does sbt automatically download/resolve the library's dependencies or do you need to do something else to make this happen?
 In python you have a setup.py file where you specify your library dependencies that pip will install with your source code with the "depends_on" parameter when pip installs your library.

I thought I might introduce myself with an open-ended question. I recently transitioned from writing paper notes to using Zettlr. (Zettlr + Git just works for me.) One thing I really miss about my old paper ZK is being able to thumb through notes and stumble on things that way. In my new computerized system, I have to explicitly write links and do searches. There is no rifling aspect, and that seems like a bummer to me. Anyone have any similar thoughts? Or recommendations? I'm still working on how to organize things to capture that inherent structure that my old paper ZK had by the mere fact of two slips being near each other. I can type in 1200 slips, but that structure is essentially gone now.]]></summary>

I have a lot of experience recently in distributed computing using Spark or Flink and I really like how these frameworks solve many issues that could go wrong in reality (offering automatic node failure recovery, effectively-once semantics etc).
 I started exploring ZIO and Akka Streams lately and I feel like there would be a lot of burden to run distributed computation using either of those. Especially to solve the issues I mentioned earlier. For me both of these focus mostly on single-node applications that would not scale in reality. I see that by the use of Fibers I can achieve high resource utilization on a single node. I can imagine buildin…]]></summary>

It seems that given the constraint (1 <= n), it should be able to deduce this. Obviously you can give that (1 <= n +1) but then it complains about (1 <= (n + 1) + 1). Is there a way of writing this as an inductive proof or something similar? My guess that there would be some way of using coercions to achieve this but am struggling to find any resources that are helpful. Thanks in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[is there a great resource, book or library‍ on classic Algorithms and Data Structures in Scala, e.g. similar in scope and quality to Sedgewick Algorithms in Java https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/home/ I found a very helpful section on algorithms implementation in /u/lihaoyi superb Hand-On Scala Programming book , but unfortunately it's only a few pages (p.107-121). And most other books provide algorithms just an illustration for some neat language feature. The thing is, to get a job as Scala developer these days (in competitive firms) one needs to be a competitive programmer, master of Leetcode, and Scala doesn't seem to have strong ecosystem in that regard as Java, Python or C++. Edit: in DIY spirit and as a learning exercise i'm thinking of translating Sedgewick Algorithms from Java to idiomatic functional Scala, if anyone wants to join this effort or aware of similar ones please let me know Edit 2 (in regards to comments on 'reinventing the wheel' below): if Scala is so great as a language and functional programming flagship, where are all the libraries of functionally implemented algorithms replacing conventional CLRS style imperative/mutable implementations?

 But because I work with many academic researches, I collect lots of PDFs and I need to find text inside of them.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My need is simple. I want to be able to read and reply to google mails in Emacs. I'm trying to build emacs 29 now. So my first question is:
 1. Should I use --with-mailutils while building emacs (Or not) for that ?
 I raised this query on IRC emacs and many people mentioned it's not required, but didn't explain clearly why. If it's not required, and If I can setup a client by just adding some mail handling packages later on, then,
 2. I'm wondering what is the use of --with-mailutils, while building ?
 Now that's not the only confusion. I've went through the MailUtils page (assuming that's what emacs will be building, if I specify the option). It mentions that it provides rich set of utilities for mail handling, so why would anyone say not to use it. Does it make Emacs bulky or anything. Idk. I'm just assuming (since they said no). Can anyone please explain me these things to clear the confusion.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Greetings,
 In Emacs I'm using Eglot as a language server, and it now supports HTML, CSS, and JavaScript really well. The only thing that I'm missing, is how to setup Emmet in Emacs to work alongside Eglot. Having nice scripts will make it easier for me, like when writing HTML templates.
 Attached below is my config passed to VSCode's settings.json file(different syntax but close):
 `
 userSettings =
 {
 "emmet.triggerExpansionOnTab" = true;
 "emmet.showSuggestionsAsSnippets" = true;
 "emmet.showExpandedAbbreviation" = "always";
 "editor.snippetSuggestions" = "top";
 "files.associations" =
 {
 "*html" = "html";
 };
 "emmet.includeLanguages" = 
 {
 "javascript" = "html";
 "django-html" = "html";
 };
 };
 `
 So what Emacs packages and use-package/ELisp configurations will I need to get this equivalent Emmet functionality in Emacs.
 Thanks in advance for the help.

 If you could paste a link to good documentation specific to this, or paste some snippets below, I use the emacs package use-package, so I understand that the most.

 It won't ignore words from a dictionary file, even when I put it in the .vscode directory that the ltex-ls docs indicate it looks for automatically
 It won't add words to the dictionary, even with the "add words" code action.
  
Has anyone got their emacs.d file where they've got lsp-ltex configured with any/all of these solved? Or is it just not really ready to be used?
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Time for a new and exciting hls release:
  
It includes three brand new plugins: 
 Alternate number literals thanks to @drsooch
 Qualify imported names thanks to @eddiemundo
 New plugin to support selection range (aka double click text selection) thanks to @kokobd
 
 Finally hls supports ghc 9.2.1 
 Including core features and many plugins
 Thanks to a great collective effort coordinated by @pepeiborra and with the help of @wz1000, @mpickering and @alanz among others
 
 Hls now also supports ghc 9.0.2 with all plugins but the stylish-haskell formatter 
 Including the wingman plugin thanks to @isovector and @anka-213
 
 And many many fixes and performance improvements, thanks to all contributors!
  
Deprecation notice for 1.6.0
  
As we noted in the previous release we have dropped support for ghc versions 8.10.5 and 8.8.3 in this release 
 We recommend upgrading ghc to the last minor version: 8.8.4 or 8.10.7
 You can read more about ghc deprecation policy and schedule here
 
 After this release: 
 We will remove all project stack.yaml's but two: one for last lts and other for nightly. Temporary we could keep one more stack yaml when nightly upgrades the ghc version, to help in the transition
 We will remove the install script which lives here
 If you want to install hls from source we recommend using ghcup. Download it and run ghcup compile hls --help to get more info about.

 I also do things like map FLT_MAX to the infinity symbol, "alpha" to the alpha symbol, etc.
 I would like to have it that when I use the delete or backspace key on such a symbol, that rather than deleting one character of the underlying ascii text, it would delete the whole region of text that has that display attribute. 
 So, for instance, if I type "FLT_MAX" and it maps to the unicode infinity symbol, backspace wouldn't delete the 'X' at the end of that string, but rather the whole word "FLT_MAX".
 I think I can code something like that myself possibly, by looking at the display attribute of the text before the cursor, but was wondering if someone had already done this.
 Thanks for any help!

 I'm converting my work flow entirely to emacs. I normally use tmux to ssh to a machine, and most of the time there are commands that I run that output plain text on the terminal. Most of the time the output I need to copy and paste but only some sections of it. This is where tmux's copy mode comes in handy, because I can now select/copy only portions of the contents(very similar to vim's visual mode). 
 Is this possible to do in emacs? 
 Requirements:
  
multiple windows(tabbed like tmux)
 ssh from emacs
 while in that ssh session enter into a mode very similar to vim's normal/visual mode, so I can copy portions of text as well as search through the shell output.
  
Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Suppose we want to compare the length of two lists.
 The intuitive approach would be to just compute the length of both lists and then check whether that number is equal for both lists.
 However, if one list is much longer than the other, that this would cause unnecessary work.
 The faster approach would be to use a function like this:
 eqLength :: [a] -> [b] -> Bool eqLength (_:xs) (_:ys) = eqLength xs ys eqLength [] [] = True eqLength _ _ = False 
 This has complexity O(min(n,m)) where n and m are the lengths, as opposed to O(n + m).
 So a rewrite rule in GHC that rewrites (length xs == length ys) -> eqLength xs ys might seem to make sense performance wise. 
 But there is an issue: For lists that have infinite length, computing the length loops indefinitely, where as the eqLength function does not.
 The behavior of the program would therefore be different.
 Do you think such optimizations are sane for the compiler to do?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I am trying to setup a org-roam-capture-new-node-hook, that will add a property to a daily/journal file automatically. while skipping other types of notes.
 here's the function I have
 (defun my/org-roam-dailies--daily-note-p (file) "Return t if FILE is an Org-roam daily-note, nil otherwise. If FILE is not specified, use the current buffer's file-path." (when-let ((path (expand-file-name file)) (directory (expand-file-name org-roam-dailies-directory org-roam-directory))) (setq path (expand-file-name path)) (f-descendant-of-p path directory))) 
 When I call this normally, I get expected response.
 (when (my/org-roam-dailies--daily-note-p "/path/to/org/roam/daily/2022-01-26.org") "Cool") : Cool 
 But when I call this from the custom hook function,
 (defun my/add-auto-props-to-org-roam-dailies () "Add properties to org-roam daily entry automatically" (unless (file-exists-p (buffer-file-name)) (when (my/org-roam-dailies--daily-note-p (buffer-file-name)) (unless (org-find-property "header-args:ledger") (org-roam-add-property (concat (file-name-as-directory (ledger-path-relative-to-org)) (file-name-base (buffer-file-name)) ".ledger") "header-args:ledger") (org-roam-add-property ":tangle" "header-args:ledger"))))) (add-hook! 'org-roam-capture-new-node-hook #'my/add-auto-props-to-org-roam-dailies) 
 This does not seem to work as expected. The call to my/org-roam-dailies--daily-note-p seem to return nil for all files. Am I missing something here?
 if I remove the check (call for my/org-roam-dailies--daily-note-p), the property gets added correctly for all files, so rest of the code is working as intended.
 P.S. ledger-path-relative-to-org is a custom function that returns a relative path to where I expect the ledger files to get tangled.

I consider the library to be highly experimental; the load module in particular is likely to undergo significant changes, error messages and documentation are to be improved.

 ​
 I've used Doom Emacs for a few months now, and from what I've seen, it is EXTREMELY powerful, so I *want* to use it. But here's the problem for me. Some other programs, like VS Code are less powerful, but far, far easier for beginners. For instance the wide array of tutorial videos on YouTube, the way you change keybindings, or the way you download extra packages.
 I think that Emacs can be far more powerful than VS Code, provided you have the proper knowledge about how it works. A great example of this is dired, it's so good that for a while I used it as my main file-manager. What's the best way to go about learning Emacs though? Should I just stop using Doom Emacs, download GNU Emacs and learn that way?

 My work changed its anti-virus software, and my native-comp Emacs init time increased from ~2 seconds to ~15 seconds, because the libraries are now all native code and the virus-scanner goes to work on every one of them.
 Subsequent starts were fast (2-3 seconds) while the scanner had things cached, but later on they will be slow again.
 If you mostly only run Emacs once per session, that's probably not an issue; otherwise it's another thing to consider.
 If you're using a native-comp build and loading libraries seems slow, this is a potential reason for that.

But the brew installation framework is confusing as hell to me. After some research, it seems like I should use something like one of the following to install emacs:
  
brew tap railwaycat/emacsmacport
 brew install emacs-mac
  
OR
  
brew tap railwaycat/emacsmacport
 brew install --cask emacs-mac. 
  
What's the difference? Also, are there any other options that I should include when installing? (Also note that I want to learn org-mode.)
 A couple people on another thread suggested I install like one of these:
  
brew install emacs-mac --with-rsvg --with-natural-title-bar --with-starter --with-mac-metal --with-glib --with-imagemagick
 
https://github.com/mclear-tools/build-emacs-macos

We users of a Zettelkasten strive for a set of ideals: that we don't only collect knowledge but integrate it and use it in the service of our own knowledge work; that use of a Zettelkasten generates new connections and insights for us in that work (as Luhmann said, as a conversation partner); that our organization of notes allows for clear thinking and organized ideas.
At least those are the ideals I had in mind when I commenced my thesis research. Truthfully, I adopted the ZK method precisely because I want…]]></summary>

 Its close (see current config below, notably the ivy-height of 1 and keybinds.) already, with very little tweaking, yet gets some extra features. Love it!
 C-s and enter 'foo bar' to search kicks swiper off, and then C-s and C-r to cycle through searches.
 I'm used to using point movement such as C-a or C-n to exit isearch; I'm okay with C-a/etc staying in the minibuf to edit the search criteria. Using enter to complete the search can be okay, though ivy/swiper sometimes gets into this 'need a match!' loop where enter just stays in there... fine.
 But I'm thinking that C-s/C-r cycle the matches, why also does…]]></summary>

While monitoring network and software data can be used to discover anomalies and detect early signs of attacks, expanding to monitor the status of physical variables, such as temperature and sounds can indicate unusual activity. Early detection of an attack in the ICS environment could minimize the potential impact of an attack as it could be used to pivot [[20210908145033 Simplified Attack Vector OT IT]] into other parts of the network (like the enterprise network) [[20220120110715 Incident Response in ICS - Detection]].

 Ever wondered - what if multimedia editing were as simple as text manipulation? Simple cut, copy and paste operations. Thanks to VLC and FFMPEG, now you can use GNU Emacs for simple multimedia editing tasks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi there, apologies in advance if it's a weird post, but with org-mode and Emacs in general I often end up at a stage where I need someone to explain things to me step by step.
 So, I already use the base org-mode under doom emacs for my drafts for scientific articles and PhD thesis, but I often end up having to switch to Word for referencing. I saw org-ref and helm-bibtex might work for me, since they both offer the possibility of inserting article links to a .bib file, that I would export from my reference manager. I even found a post that explains how to set up something similar, but I find that workflow overwhelming to implement as there is A LOT MORE going on.
 I think the best way for me to overcome this would be to add those things one step at a time to understand how they work.
 All I would need at this stage is to
  
Write things with headers and basic formatting
 Add citations and some piece of content (formulas, images, code, etc.)
 Export to pdf
  
so question would be: can I make a barebone workflow that can integrate all these pieces and make something somewhat functional? 
 My idea would be to try and implement something like org-noter for my PDFs at a later point, while having some minimal functioning setting at first.
 Thank you all in advance, any help is much appreciated.

 I've started using org-habit this week. I can set my habits and see the nice colored consistency graph to track visually my habits.
 However, I would like to have a numeric record of this. For example, something for each habit, I am imagining something like the statistics cookies:
 Number of repetitions done / Number of repetitions scheduled Percent of repetitions done % 
 Or even better, have some stats about how many repetitions I have done a habit in a row (similar to "don't break the chain").
 I was wondering if it's possible to do it directly with the org-habit module or if something else is necessary. 
 Thanks.

#proofing #economics 
Student Loan Forgiveness is Regressive
Subatomic: Knock on effects of across-the-board loan forgiveness.
Surprising second order effects (Trophic cascade [[201901171252]]) of student loan forgiveness. More children of families in the middle and upper tiers of society go to university and take out loans to pay for it. These families can handle the loan burden. They tend to get larger loans to pay for education. That education lands them high paying jobs where they can afford to pay back the loan. Loan forgiveness favors these upper income people to a larger extent and with a larger amount of money than those less fortunate. This increases rather than decreases the economic gap between social classes.
B-The Other [[202102012019]]

  
Across-the-board forgiveness is therefore a costly and ineffective way to reduce economic gaps by race or socioeconomic status. 1
…Accounting correctly for both human capital and effect of subsidies in student lending plans, almost a third of all student debt is owed by the wealthiest 20 percent of households and only 8 percent by the bottom 20 percent. Across-the-board student loan forgiveness is regressive measured by income, family affluence, educational attainment—and also wealth.1

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This post may belong better on the KM or AppleScript forums, but I thought I'd ask here first mainly because I bet someone will have a far easier process than I'm trying to build.
After writing a Zettel in The Archive, I want to remind myself to review it in a day, and after that, remind myself for a few days later.  A progressive review kind of thing.
I have a KM macro that:
Prompts me for the number of days, from a pre-made list.
Writes a tag (#ReviewXDays, where X is the number of days) to an inserted 2nd line on the Zettel
Copies the Zettel's h1 (from the 3rd character to the end of the line)
Creates an Apple reminder "Review such-and-such Zettel" with a due date of the number of days out
It all works except the calculated Reminders date at the very end.  I think it must be either a variable type problem, or a syntax problem in the AppleScript.  I have a temporary KM Action before the last step that displays the date I'm trying to use.  If I simply copy that (correct-looking) result and paste it as a constant string in the final KM action, it works.  It just won't accept the variable version of that date.
The error is some variation of "execution error: reminders got an error: can't get date (1/27/2022)", depending on the tweaks I've tried in the script syntax.
Has anyone
created some kind of progressive review automation for themselves that's better than this
worked with pushing a due date to Reminders via AppleScript
The image is of the last few actions, where the "make new reminder" line in the AppleScript is where I fail.

...and here is my KM macro (1st time sharing, hope I do this right):
Add Review Tag

Or does anyone know if FSF actually does offer the most recent version as a hard copy?
 ​
 This is 1337 pages, so it would likely be hardback (but that's not a requirement on my part - I think some print on demand companies I've used in the past had a requirement that anything above a certain amount of pages had to be hardback, though).

It would mean going to a Windows or Mac machine, spinning up the very slow Dymo label making software, getting the GUI designer right, inserting the label text, printing, and wash-rinse-repeat.
 I wrote a gem to provide a simple command-line program to print labels from a shell. As a bonus, it includes some simple elisp to provide printing the current paragraph from within an emacs buffer as a label.
 This is a bit of a hobby project, written as a Ruby gem, but it eliminated a big hassle for me.
 Here is the link: labrat or install the ruby gem labrat.

 https://github.com/ir33k/tb-keycast
 Created as alternative to keycast package that does the same thing in mode-line. I was trying this original package but found that it doesn't behave exactly like I wanted so I created my own from scratch.
 Originally it was also integrated with mode-line but since I'm on newer Emacs version I took the opportunity to move it to tab-bar. I think it's much better that way.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Most developers choose the path of least resistance. Effect systems are not low resistance and its very hard for experienced functional programmers to explain why its so great. Even ZIO that makes it a little bit more straight forward is still a huge leap from where most programmers are. 
 Compare this to say Rust. Rust requires more from the programmers but the rules around borrowing and lifetimes are relativly easy to understand it takes a while to learn fully. But the motivation is there because its performance and its measurable. Do you want your programms to be 2x+ fast then writ it in Rust.
 Effects systems are very abstract concepts. First that you are describing a program in a program. Then the notion that non purity is bad. Monads, functors etc. There is alot to understand because in the long run you need to understand them.
 I'm currently learning and I like it. Not that I'm fully aware of all benefits but I like learning. 
 When I look at the majority of programmers that I have worked with. They like their job and they program in whatever language they happened to end up with and very few wants to invest in learning a whole new paradigm. It's so hard to get developers to let go of Java 8 some times. Most Java developers have probably never used records in Java. 
 So what am I getting to. I don't know actually :-D just something I have been thinking about. 
 What do you think. Can effect systems ever be mainstream? I can't really see it ever happening if most developers doesn't suddenly become super interested in learning new stuff.
 Also if you believe it can go mainstream how us it going to happen?

The problem is that there are so many features that I'm afraid of missing out on some of the most useful ones simply due to the sheer amount of commands available.
 For example, I had no idea that you could move text up or down a line by holding down alt and then the up or down arrow keys, or that you could navigate through paragraphs with the curly brackets. These are all incredible features that could save me hours of time.

In my experience, dogs respond when people have built a strong persona. It is no different with us humans. People who have a strong persona come across to us as dishonest, insincere, insecure and/or generally untrustworthy.
However, we humans have a special tolerance for people with strong personas because we usually have a personas ourselves. In a sense, we humans play a kind of social poker game and are familiar with the rules. We are, in a sense, talented and skilled at interacting with untrustworthy people. We have the security of being practiced.
Dogs, on the other hand, have no persona. The difference between a publicly displayed mask (persona) and a self hidden behind it is not understandable by them. What t…]]></summary>

 Hello everyone, I am rewriting my dotfiles with org mode. I created this files in my HOME:
 ├── .config
 │ └── shell
 │ ├── aliases.sh
 │ ├── env_vars.sh
 │ ├── functions.sh
 │ └── myrc.sh
 ├── .docs
 │ ├── hooks.org
 │ ├── setups.org
 │ └── shell.org
 └── README.org
 The shell folder have the result of the shell.org tangled blocks.
 README.org will be my master index for all others in docs. In this file I want it to be something like this:
 Here I was able to use the :toc: header arg, but it only worked for the current file.
  
Table of contents (TOC) (README.org) 
 ...
 
 SHELL (here I want to display the shell.org file TOC) 
 aliases (other file link; in the * ALIASES position)
 env_vars (like aliases)
 function (like aliases)
 myrc (like aliases)
 
 HOOKs (TOC of hooks.org)
 ...
 SETUPS (TOC of hooks.org)
 ...
  
-----------------------------------------------------
 I tried including the shell.org summary like this:
  
SHELL 
 #+INCLUDE "./.docs/shell.org::*TOC"
 
  
But this creates a local link with this extructe: [[#header][header]]. I can't click and they don't work on github. I also have to export the file I'm editing so they show up in the current buffer, it would be nice if they show up after I write the changes like :toc: does (if anyone knows how to do this it would be great).
 Manually I can write the links that work as TOC like this:
  
SHELL 
 [file:./.docs/shell.org#ALIASES][aliases]]
 ...
 
  
I could do this manually, but it would be a lot of work and if I updated or modified external files the README.org would not be updated.

It is inconvenient to construct states suitable for testing by hand. An

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lately, since switching to using Emacs 28 (using the emacs-plus build), I run into the following issue: when simply trying to open a file, Emacs freezes for a few seconds before doing so. 
 Now: 
  
I've had this happen multiple times when opening a single .el file while visiting a buffer with a different .el file on, so there should be no delay coming from running any mode-related hooks etc, at least as far as I understand these things. 
 I've had this happen long after starting an Emacs session, so any package being loaded with a :defer n call (via use-package) should have been loaded. 
  
I've been trying to use the one tool I sort of knew of for this, explain-pause-mode, but something appears to be wrong with the package but for some reason the package isn't working anymore. I've now had the profiler start by default and tried to look at the profiler report right after I notice the lag, but that hasn't given me any clues. 
 I'm thinking of resetting the profiler every few seconds or so to see if that helps, but I'm wondering if anyone here knows of another way to figure out what's going on. 
 I've been reluctant to bisect my init since as I said before sometimes hours go by without running into this problem.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's just a short snippet in case you need to browse an SQL dump. It makes the dump more readable by adding field names as comments which can be helpful with tables having lots of fields. It needs to be a dump which contains field names too.
 Here's an example with a trivial table. 
 The original dump:
 INSERT INTO `student` (`id`, `name`, `class`, `mark`, `gender`) VALUES (1, 'John Deo', 'Four', 75, 'female'), (2, 'Max Ruin', 'Three', 85, 'male'), (3, 'Arnold', 'Three', 55, 'male'), ... 
 the converted dump:
 INSERT INTO `student` (`id`, `name`, `class`, `mark`, `gender`) VALUES ( /* id */ 1, /* name */ 'John Deo', /* class */ 'Four', /* mark */ 75, /* gender */ 'female'), ( /* id */ 2, /* name */ 'Max Ruin', /* class */ 'Three', /* mark */ 85, /* gender */ 'male'), ( /* id */ 3, /* name */ 'Arnold', /* class */ 'Three', /* mark */ 55, /* gender */ 'male'), ... 
 The code:
 (save-excursion (goto-char (point-min)) (while (re-search-forward ") VALUES" nil t) (beginning-of-line) (search-forward "(") (let ((start (point)) fields) (while (not (eq ?\) (char-after))) (forward-sexp) (push (buffer-substring-no-properties start (point)) fields) (skip-syntax-forward ". ") (setq start (point))) (setq fields (mapcar (lambda (field) (substring field 1 -1)) (reverse fields))) (while (progn (search-forward "(") (let ((fields fields)) ;; make a copy (while (not (eq ?\) (char-after))) (insert (concat " /* " (pop fields) " */ ")) (forward-sexp) (if (looking-at ",") (forward-char 1)) (skip-syntax-forward " "))) (looking-at "),"))))))

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I read the emails in my Gmail account in Gnus but I don't store the emails locally, and instead use Gnus's nnimap backend to fetch them. I occasionally want to link to an email from an Org file and want to know how to do it in a robust way. Linking to an email that is still in my INBOX works, but as soon as it expires the link is dead. I thought using gnus-cache-enter-article (bound to *) would instruct Gnus to keep the email around so the link would continue to work, but it doesn't: oddly Gnus still shows the starred email in my INBOX even if it is marked as expired, but the Org link stops working.
 I don't delete any email from my Gmail account so in principle I could have long-lasting links to emails there. I bet somebody has already figured out what to do. I can think of a few possibilities:
  
Maybe there's a way to process the links to point to [Gmail]/All Mail instead, which seem to last longer, but I believe the also stop working after a while (I'm not sure they do, but I have a vague recollection of testing this once, maybe the Gmail IMAP implementation is responsible for the impermanence).
 
Maybe * doesn't keep the links working, but Gnus has several other ways of marking messages to be kept and one of those methods works (I'm no expert on Gnus!).
 
Maybe there's a convenient way to keep locally copies of the messages in another Gnus backend? Like maybe I can copy a message to some other account which I only use for local storage, and link to that copy instead?
 
 Does anyone have a good method for this, using any of those ideas or a different better one?

However, this seems to be almost all of my installed packages.
 Is this a known issue/conflict with Melpa packages/use-package/something else, or is it offering to remove the older versions, or is something messed up?
 It's not a huge issue as I can just.... not answer y to package-autoremove.... but it shouldn't be considering everything unneeded. Plus I guess it prevents me from later removing actually unneeded stuff...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi All,
 Inspired by Emacs From Scratch I decided to upend my IDE functionality in my config for lsp-mode. LSP starts and is functional, but lsp-ui is shoddy. The sideline functionality and the header breadcrumbs do not work. For me this is not a big deal, but what is bothering me is that lsp-ui-flycheck-list does not work. I need to manually run M-x load-library lsp-ui-flycheck and only then will lsp-ui-flycheck-list show me the list of errors on the page. This leads me to believe there is a loading issue somewhere.
 the relevant init section is this:
 ``` (use-package lsp-mode :straight t :commands lsp :hook ((typescript-mode js2-mode web-mode python-mode) . lsp) :bind (:map lsp-mode-map ("TAB" . completion-at-point)) :custom (lsp-headerline-breadcrumb-enable nil))
 (use-package lsp-ui :straight t :hook (lsp-mode . lsp-ui-mode) :config (setq lsp-ui-sideline-enable t) (setq lsp-ui-sideline-show-hover nil) (setq lsp-ui-doc-position 'bottom) (lsp-ui-doc-show))
 (use-package lsp-treemacs :after lsp)
 ```
 After startup I do see a few relevant error messages:
 ``` ... File mode specification error: (error The connected server(s) does not support method textDocument/hover. To find out what capabilities support your server use ‘M-x lsp-describe-session’ and expand the capabilities section) Error running timer: (error "The connected server(s) does not support method textDocument/hover. To find out what capabilities support your server use ‘M-x lsp-describe-session’ and expand the capabilities section") LSP :: pylsp:11352 initialized successfully in folders: ...
 ``` Can this be the source of the problem ?
 thx. S

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[​
 I have org files with lots of sections of all sorts (markdown, plain text, code, calculations, directory trees, etc., etc.), some of them within babel #+begin and #+end delimiters, some not. All these sections have some implicit foldable structure. Some have exisiting appropriate language modes, some do not.
 My question is, in coding up custom folding commands for these sections, should I try and base the commands on extending the folding functions provided by org-mode, or should I choose my preferred folding library (of which there are many) and extend it, potentially clashing with org-mode in some way?
 I think I like stateful/persistent folding as in "vimish-fold". I prefer staying within the org-mode buffer rather escaping to a dedicated buffer and returning.
 Any pointers to discussions much appreciated.

 I'm on a quest. I've been travelling for a while. And I might be closing on its end, I feel. With Emacs.
 I have MIDI devices connected to a Macbook. I need Emacs to listen to their MIDI events and insert as text. Simple. Just letters or numbers.
 Google has brought me to these ways:
 - emacswiki, emaccordion, midimacs, midi-kbd : based on ALSA (linux), unavailable in Mac OS X.
 - (make-serial-port) : MIDI devices are generally USB, not serial.
 ​
 Could someone point me in the right direction?

 What I've tried so far:
  
c-mode-hook with lsp-disconnect, lsp-ui, global-flycheck-mode toggle
 with-eval-after-load 'c-mode. The same as above
  
Neither work.
 lsp-disconnect is not available when I call it in my .emacs config for hooking c-mode (but it is for with-eval-after-load, although that still doesn't work).
 Global-flycheck-mode is apparently toggled on even if i turn it off by something.
 I thought, Maybe Lsp is toggling it on? I tried (setq lsp-diagnostics-provider :none) which doesn't seem to make a difference for flychek.
 Even when I disable lsp manually by lsp-disconnect for that buffer, it seems to always come back somehow and re-enable itself even while i just stay editing that single buffer.
 Anyone know how I can have these two disabled at startup but toggleable when needed?

 I start my day by creating a new daily note (with org-roam). Right now it looks like so:
  
[ ] write a journal
 [ ] check slack
 [ ] check important tasks etc
  
What I would like to do is insert various steps based on criteria. For example:
  
at the end of the month, insert - [ ] month review
 at the beginning of the month, - [ ] review personal tasks
  
If for whatever reason I miss the "beginning of the mont" or "end of the month", I want this check list item to appear still. Is there a package out there that does something like this? I'm sure I can come up with custom elisp, but I thought I'd check in before I do that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As react is now the most popular FE framework by a mile (and I and countless others work in it daily), it drives me crazy there's no major-mode for it. I've done a ton of googling and tried a lot of solutions people put online, and I did have some that worked decently well, but none are perfect and the one I was just using broke after an update (like many I've tried before have). I feel like the best solution would be to just write a major-mode for it, it would help keep a lot of web devs on emacs who like the extensibility but are frustrated by the amount of work it takes to just get jsx/tsx to be supported like they are in every other major editor (maybe vim aside, I never use it so I can't say).
 I have some basic emacs experience, I've been using it daily for about 3 years and have fiddled around with some packages and gone through elisp tutorials and even built some dumb programs to play around (like a tic-tac-toe game), but I honestly don't know the first thing about writing a major mode, and while I've read some tutorials on doing so I know people who have experience doing this have a much better idea of what would need to be done, how to break down the work required, and what modern tools (thinking treesitter) could be used to make the syntax parsing, etc much easier.
 I do work full time and am also doing my MBA, but I'd be more than happy to dedicate a night or two a week to get this moving. Unless there's something else out there or someone has started on something, I'd be more than happy to contribute, I just need some guidance on getting up to speed on everything required for a fully-functional major mode. Hopefully this isn't some pipe dream, I feel like with tree-sitter and lsp (and the foundational work already done for other js modes) we could come up with something really solid. Let me know your thoughts, appreciated!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I use nvm to manage node versions. When I inspect exec-path, it contains a version of node that I no longer have installed, i.e. ~/.nvm/versions/node/v17.3.0/bin is in my exec-path, but I only have the most recent stable and lts versions installed (v17.4 and v.16.3.2, respectively).
 So, two questions:
 1 - Naturally, how can I fix this? I've tried using (setenv NODE_PATH ...), but that didn't work. I tried (setq exec-path (append exec-path (file-name-directory (shell-command-to-string "which node")))) but that didn't do the trick either.
 2 - How might this have happened, so I can stop it from happening again in the future?
 Thanks very much.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, 
 I am currently working through a purescript book and really enjoying everything I’m learning! I’m currently working through implementing stock Prelude functions. Apply and flip were easy enough to understand:
 apply :: forall a b. (a -> b) -> a -> b apply f x = f x
 flip :: forall a b c. (a -> b -> c) -> b -> a -> c flip f x y = f y x
 Now, for the implementation of applyFlipped, the book implements it as:
 applyFlipped :: forall a b. a -> (a -> b) -> b applyFlipped = flip apply
 So from my understanding, applyFlipped accepts two arguments: a parameter of type a, and a function that accepts a parameter of type a and returns a parameter of type b. Because purescript is implicitly right-associative, that would mean that the function with explicit parameters would read:
 applyFlipped x f = (flip (apply x f))
 My question is: why does the compiler interpret this as flip with parameters apply, x, and f, rather than interpreting it as apply with parameters x and f (which wouldn’t compile), whose result is a parameter for flip?

 It's not a package since most likely you have to adjust it to fit your system and I don't have the capability to make it works for everyone. Also, it has a major drawback that I will mention at the end.
 When you call this command it asks for an input command exactly like Evil. The only difference is that the evaluation of the command is done by vim. This has both advantages and disadvantages.
 Advantages:
  
It understands more ex commands than evil.

 Firm #1 (smaller) decided that it's too hard to hire people who knows Scala, and it was hard for other non-FP engineers to understand Scala code.
 Firm #2 (larger) prototyped, then deployed, a trading system in Scala. Once volume picked up, the decision was made to rewrite to C++ for performance reasons. It was blamed on "idiomatic" Scala which I presume was heavy on immutable data structures.
 So I just wanted to get a lay of the land, have ya'll seen this happen at your companies? Is it common for a rewrite to happen at a certain point in a project's maturity, or have I just been unlucky?

 The error message: AttributeError: module 'pandas' has no attribute 'read_csv'

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone,
 There is a version 0.4 out for the dtache package. The short description of the package is that it provides the possibility to run commands that are detached from Emacs. To read more see the README here https://gitlab.com/niklaseklund/dtache. The major changes compared to the last release is:
  
dtache now integrates with the built in notifications library and this is used as default now for all users
 dtache now uses filenotify to monitor the decoupled processes. This is done for both local and remote commands.
 dtache now fully supports users on macOS
 dtache now is pre-configured with bindings in its minor/major-modes in order to simplify configurations for the users
 dtache is now available on ELPA, MELPA and as a Guix package

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I'm using doom emacs on macos and trying to define a keybinding to do following using embark and vertico:
  
Say I'm scrolling through a file list (find-file, org-roam-node-find etc).
 I find a file that I may need, I press C-; v and it opens in a new vertical window.
  
Essentially C-x 4 C-f but in reverse order. I want to select the file first and then open it in a vertical or horizontal window (same frame).
 This is what I have so far:
 (map! :map embark-file-map :desc "Open file in v-split" "v" (lambda () (interactive) (+evil/window-vsplit-and-follow) (find-file (embark--vertico-selected))) :desc "Open file in h-split" "h" (lambda () (interactive) (+evil/window-split-and-follow) (find-file (embark--vertico-selected)))) 
 I expected this to let me select and file and then decide weather to open in vertical/horizontal window.
 But I get this error: embark PCH: (wrong-type-argument stringp nil). I understand the error, but don't know how to pass the file name to the find-file function.
 Also is this the correct way to define an embark mapping for doom?
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm going through "Category Theory for Programmers" and I'm trying to make sense of the author's description of the type Void.
 An excerpt:
  
It’s a type that’s not inhabited by any values. You can define a function that takes Void, but you can never call it. To call it, you would have to provide a value of the type Void, and there just aren’t any. As for what this function can return, there are no restrictions whatsoever. It can return any type (although it never will, because it can’t be called).
  
Then it proceeds to explain that a singleton set is actually type ()
 This doesn't make sense to me - why isn't a function that is the equivalent of { return 32 } the same as a morphism mapping an empty set to a non-empty set? And why can't you call a function whose argument is the equivalent of an empty set? And finally, how is () the equivalent of a set with a single member?
 UPDATE: While typing this, I think it finally clicked - still looking for confirmation. An Empty set can only map to an Empty set because there are no elements to transform. Which is why () is some universal element because it implies that you can map a set with one thing to any one other thing. Is this right?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, 
 Rather recently, I am getting into integrating emacs shell into my workflow. I found that shell works best for me. I tried e-shell but it did not render very well (am I missing something here).
 I would like to improve my shell experience and I was hoping for some help on that front. Specifically. 
  
Using, something like ls in my default shell color codes the directories and files. But shell in emacs doesn't do that. (I am using zsh shell default.) 
 
The shell quotes every command. So typing ls will first print ls then the output. I will like to avoid that. 
 
Somewhat asinine of me, but I tried to invoke nano in side emacs shell. But then I couldn't terminate the process and had to kill the shell. Is there a way around it? 
 
Is it advisable to run tmux in the shell?
 
 Thank you very much for your time and any suggestions towards shell customization is welcome!

 repo/web: https://git.sr.ht/~mplscorwin/emacs-w64
 tl;dr: emacs 28 binary downloads as Installer or ZIP
 The "latest-greatest" is in the "with-native-compilation" folder. Those match what I expect will be Available Soon™ from alpha.gnu.org. 
 These support the native compiler provided a working msys2 installation (with libgccjit, GCC) in PATH. The rest of the dependencies (rsvg, libxml, jansson, ...) are included (unless you grab a "no-deps" version).
 NOTE: the full repo is >5GB; it's likely best to visit the link in a browser, then use the "tree" tab to drill down to and download the file(s) of interest. Full emacs sources are pushed as emacs-28.0.91-src.zip.
 TIA for any feedback and especially reports of breakage, doubly so if you can take the time to send minimal reproducers starting from emacs -Q using ```M-x report-emacs-bug.

 I just want those features that I already have in the vscodium, i love Emacs and the way that it's extensible! (sorry ,English is not my mother tongue).

 So I managed to get majority of what I think my emacs config should look like up and running. Still tweaking things for modern web development (react, ts, etc etc)..
 One thing I miss the most about vim/neovim was telescope and fuzzy finding. Is there a way to have this functionality in emacs? I messed around with counsel-fzf but what I got was fuzzy-finding in the current directory rather than the entire project.. 
 I am trying out helm now and I keep running into this annoying issue when trying to use helm-fuzzy-find. Am I doing things right? Any suggestions on getting fuzzy finding working in emacs where whenever I trigger it, it searches the root project directory??
 ​
 THANKS!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So for the purposes of my final year project I'm writing a non-deterministic language by Haskell for the purposes of learning Haskell and to understand language design! Non-determinism in the language arises in the presence of control flow for example : n := 0 Do (n < 10)-> if P.x -> S [] Q.x -> R fi Od So if any of the guards (P.x,Q.x) are True then their statements S,R can be carried out. The caveat here however is that both of the guards could be evaluated to True which means both statements have to be executed. The branch taken that finishes first however is the branch which ultimately gives the final result so for example if the two guards where checking if n is an even number and if n was less than say five then both branches would have to be taken. ​ After just completing a class on Parallel Computing, my first thought was to use threads but then I came across numerous articles and blogs about how the List Monad can handle non-determinism. ​ So my two approaches where to either use threads which I do have some experience with or to see if the List Monad could actually work. I'm inclined to use threads given that each branch obtains its own instance of the program therefore it would make sense to use them but I am quite aware that Haskell‍ is more or less magic so I figured there's probably another way to achieve the effect I desire. ​ Could something along the lines Lisp's amb be of any use? I found the Haskell implementation https://wiki.haskell.org/Amb but it appears to generally be used for more trivial programs than anything else. ​ My apologies if this post isn't allowed, was just looking to rubberduck a bit

 I have the following lines in my .emacs file and the second package doesn't work.

 However, if I switch the order of them
 (add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/extensions/canvas-emacs-master") (require 'canvas-utils) (setq canvas-baseurl "my-uni") (setq canvas-token "your-canvas-token") (add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/extensions/emacs-nav-49") (require 'nav) (nav-disable-overeager-window-splitting) (require 'package) (add-to-list 'package-archives '("melpa" .

 nav stops working, so I assume that something is wrong with the code regarding the second package. Can somebody who is more experienced see if I'm doing anything wrong or does the fault lie with the package itself?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I was looking at functional programming for months, and I was studying haskell in particular. I can see how preventing mutation and side effects helps increasing the correctness of the program especially in parallel and concurrent programming. But I wonder how this affects the performance of the program in terms of space and time?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dear Haskellers, there's some neat behavior of GHCI that I've discovered by accident and I've grown to take advantage of it quite a bit and I realized that it's probably not common knowledge, since I don't ever remember anyone mentioning it, so I've decided to mention it myself.
 As you know, when you :reload in GHCI, it only reloads the modules that have changed (themselves or their dependecies, modulo unnecessary TemplateHaskell reloads) since the last :reload. What I've noticed is that when a module doesn't get reloaded, it gets to keep the value of any top-level IORefs too (the value of anything really)!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Since I switched my persistant scratch to org-mode, my emacs startup time went from less than 1 second to more than 5 seconds.
 With benchmark-init, I found out that the problem comes from org-modules, mostly ol-gnus that takes more than 3 seconds to load.
 Knowing that, as I don't use and don't plan to ever use gnus, eww, or most of the other ol-* things loaded, I want to disable all of them.
 I tried to customize-variable org-modules or (setq org-modules nil) with use-package in :init, :config, :preface, :custom, each separatly or all at the same time, but nothing does the job, I alway have the same default org-modules loaded including ol-gnus and all the others. I also tried with (setq org-modules (delq 'org-gnus org-modules)) as I found in someone's config, or setting a minimal list with (setq org-modules '(org-id ol-info org-protocol)), 
 Do somebody have an idea of how to disable some or all org-modules to load ? Thanks.
 I'm using emacs 27.2 with build-in org 9.4.4.
 Just to prevent some answers, I don't want to use emacsclient or doom to speedup my startup time, I just want to understand why I can't set org-modules the way I want.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Title. I'm not really sure that Comonad is the answer, because it's dual on how layers can be transformed. F.e. Monad's (join :: Monad m => m (m a) -> m a) ,opposed to comonad's (duplicate :: Comonad w => w a -> w (w a)) and (return :: Monad m => a -> m a) opposed to (extract :: Comonad w => w a -> a). Alas, it's not about whether the value is stored, like in a covariant functor, or is it consumed, like in a contravariant functor.
 Is there any typeclass that allowes this: cobind :: Contramonad c => c b -> (a -> c b) -> c a ?
 And is (would have been) it usefull? I'm asking from theoretical point of view + I'm curious (mostly curious, I don't know much category theory).
 UPD: upon writing this, I wrote the following piece of code, that typechecks
 (>>~) :: (Contravariant w, Comonad w) => w b -> (a -> w b) -> w a wb >>~ f = contramap f $ duplicate wb 
 My own question answered by myself, I guess? The answer is (Comonad + Contravariant).
 UPD: as the wise man in the comments said, no type constructor, that is both Comonad and Contravariant, is inhabited, so my solution is kinda useless.

 Helloo. I am terribly sorry if this is a common knowledge, but I have been unable to find an answer to this question of mine. What I want to achieve is stopping infinite recursion started by a thread, on a timeout. I tried using System.Timeout.timeout, too, and it didn't help. After a bit of googling I found out that recursion can be optimized in such a way that thread in question never yields, so I tried compiling with -fno-omit-yields, and it didn't do anything. I also am compiling with -threaded.
 ```Main.hs module Main where
 import Control.Concurrent (killThread, forkIO, threadDelay) import Control.Concurrent.MVar (newEmptyMVar, putMVar, takeMVar)
 runWithTimeout :: IO (Maybe String) runWithTimeout = do mvar <- newEmptyMVar threadId <- forkIO $ do let res = Just $ show (f 5) putMVar mvar res
 threadKiller <- forkIO $ do threadDelay $ 2 * (10^6) -- 2 seconds killThread threadId putMVar mvar Nothing res <- takeMVar mvar killThread threadKiller return res 
 f :: Int -> Int f n = n * f(n - 1)
 main :: IO () main = do res <- runWithTimeout mapM_ putStrLn res ```
 This is what my cabal file has: .cabal executable test main-is: Main.hs ghc-options: -threaded -fno-omit-yields build-depends: base ^>=4.14.3.0 hs-source-dirs: app default-language: Haskell2010

 Questions:
 Does tagless final even make sense in a reactive application where you're mostly using the stream/observable types and not an IO? Since there is no standard type class like Cats IO for streaming, I'm guessing not?
 How does writing a reactive app in ZIO vs Monix compare? What are the abstractions in ZIO for reactive and how do they compare to the observable?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have been coding Haskell for years but (I am very ashamed to admit) I still don't quite get what's so great about laziness.
 I look at laziness only as a nice-to-have trick where I occasionally do something like indexedBoom = zip boom [0..], but that's it. I don't quite get what's so PROFOUND about laziness.
 I'm sure there are many things in Haskell that I use all the time that not only utilize laziness but simply would not be possible at all without laziness, but I don't quite grasp what those things are.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am trying to create buttons in a pos-tip window, created with the function pos-tip-show-no-propertize.
 This should be possible, as company-quickhelp is using exactly this function to display the temporary help, and in its popup window, I can select text, click buttons, and so on. On the other hand, when trying to replicate this behaviour, its as if the pos-tip window was "floating" above the rest, and I am not able to interact with it. The text is correctly fontified as far as colours, weight, slant ... are concerned, but I can't seem to get my mouse to "interact" with it. 
 As an example, here is a (toy) example that does not work (i.e. I can't click on the links) while using company+company-quickhelp and completing the symbol while shows exactly the same text ... except that the buttons actually are clickable: 
 (let* ((help-buffer (describe-symbol 'while)) (text (with-current-buffer "*Help*" (buffer-string)))) (pos-tip-show-no-propertize text nil nil nil 5 600 600)) 
 I've spent quite some time reading the company-quickhelp and company-capf documentation, and I can't understand what they are doing that I am not doing.

 Who should apply?
 Anyone who meets the following criteria should apply:
  
 Candidates should have enough bandwidth to review merge requests to base on a semi-frequent basis (2 to 3 per month), and sustain this for their 3 years term in a healthy manner.
  Candidates should be able to contribute opinions and analysis to issues raised by the community as a part of the CLC proposal process on a semi-frequent basis (2 to 3 per month).
  Candidates should be good communicators, and at least be able to articulate to the CLC team when they will be available vs. unavailable.
  Candidates should be productive, and be able to follow through on merge requests and conversations to their completion in a diligent and timely manner.
  
We encourage any and all who satisfy these requirements to apply. Please note that we are not looking for the biggest galaxy brain in the room - quite the opposite. We are looking for productive, motivated individuals who want to help support the ecosystem that we love. As such, we hope to build a broad sample of the community.
 Candidates, who stand for CLC Elections back in September, are most welcome to apply again.
 How can I apply?
 To apply for one of these positions, send an email to core-libraries-committee@haskell.org that consists of the following data:
  
 The header "CLC Election January 2022 - {your name}".
  Why you think you’re a good fit given the above criteria.
  If applicable, please point us to some code you’ve written.
  
Please apply before Feb 1.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Over the years of being a middlingly-talented web developer, I've learned a dislike of spaces in file names.  I know they are valid in filenames, and are at least addressed in URLs/URIs, but they seem to add just a little fragility to what is otherwise pretty solid without spaces.
I'm about to embrace wholeheartedly the community's recommendation of a unique ID in the filename, followed by the plain English name.  I see the automation benefits of having the (Markdown) h1 in the Zettel being the same as the file name, so that leans me towards accepting spaces.  But one of my goals here is a pretty rigorous future proofing, portability, and stability.
Have you all given this some thought and decided that spaces in file names are just not a problem at all?  If so, my set of files are still small enough that I can swap strategies.
Thank you for any advice you can give.]]></summary>

 (2) highlight the current cell (defined now with "#%%" boundaries) in which the cursor is in, with a different color than background
 I'm unfortunately stuck for those two tasks and would much appreciate any tips... Thank you a lot in advance for your help!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been using Emacs + org-roam for a year. But I recently tried logseq for two weeks. Both are great softwares, and have their strengths and weaknesses.
 I'd like to share my thoughts, and see what you think.
 ​
 Pro for Emacs:
  
Unparalleled editing experience.
 Great support for tables, org-babel, etc.
 Highly customizable. Writing an elisp function is a lot faster than writing a plugin.
 A long history, a strong community. I'm really impressed how many great changes happen every year.
  
Cons for Emacs:
  
Bad support for multimedia, and I see little hope that this will be solved. (eaf might be a solution but I use macOS instead of Linux)
 Had to write many configs myself. Although I've made it comfortable for myself now, I think I'd have to throw more effort at it in the future.
  
​
 Pros for Logseq:
  
Modern UI (it is not a clear win compared to emacs though)
 User-friendly note-taking. And I don't have to maintain my config. For example, using [[page]] to reference or create another page, viewing all journals in one page, etc.
 More note-taking related functions. For example, Zotero support, taking notes with, NLP (not yet, but in their roadmap), etc.
 FLOSS!
  
Cons for Logseq:
  
Hard to migrate. The format is too customized. But I think it is a common problem for doubly-linked note systems.
 Org-mode support is not that great. Inter-operatability is not as good as expected.
  
​
 There are also different considerations w.r.t. note taking:
  
When pressing enter, Logseq insert a new node as default instead of a newline as in Emacs.
  
​
 To me, Logseq seems to be a very modern and promising note system, while Emacs remains a lot more reliable. It is really hard to choose between those two.

But recently i gave notion a try. While I am not at the level of those who make YouTube videos on how they use notion and I think that it is a little too extremist I have come to like the ability view/edit/add notes from multiple devices. Usually I used to use org only on my laptop but recently I have acquired quite a few devices and I want the ability to be on sync with devices. 
 I am curious how people sync/view/add notes or org between laptop/tablet/iPhone? Also anyone who converted from Org to Notion or vice versa what are your thoughs? Thanks

 Currently I'm specializing in Python web development, and I resigned from my job a couple of months ago to become a freelancer, but, I was just curious, currently as of 2022 what is the state of Haskell in industry?
 Is there more Haskell job openings?
 Are companies looking to hire Haskell freelancers?
 Any statistical graphs to show if Haskell is growing or not?
 Anyways, I was just wondering. I'm going to learn Haskell and do a bunch of personal Haskell projects as a hobby for now, but it would be motivator for me to learn even more Haskell if more Haskell jobs opened up in industry.
 Currently, languages like Python have a lot of job openings, that's why I'm spending most of my time with Python, but I'm also very interesting in getting back into pure lazy functional programming.
 Thanks in advance!
 Cheers!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently started using org-gcal and I had noted two things about its current functionality that were bothering me and wondered if there was already a solution implemented:
 1) It seems that the only way I can send my scheduled task from my org mode file to google calendar is to use org-gcal-post-at-point at a specific header in the org file. This works for individual tasks in the org file, but this is quite cumbersome if I wanted to upload my entire org file's scheduled tasks. I tried org-gcal-sync-buffer when I was in the org file, but it only uploaded the individual tasks that already had the org-gcal property to the calendar and ignored the other scheduled tasks. Is there a solution to upload everything in the org file at once?
 2) I was wondering if a solution had already been implemented for dealing with recurring tasks in org mode and being implemented into the calendar yet? It seems like this is something others had wanted but I did not see any solutions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This has started to happen occasionally and I haven't been able to find a reliable way to reproduce it, but I'm hoping someone here might have a clue as to what's going on.
 Sometimes, my agenda view shows a series of question marks where usually I'd see the name of the org file the item comes from. Just now, I was viewing my agenda and noticed that items coming from one of the files in my `org-agenda-files shows these question marks at the beginning:

 I can call org-agenda-switch-to from that item and I'm sent to the right file. Something appears to be corrupt, but I do not know what that is. 
 Any clues?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My browser extension BrainTool uses .org format to store bookmark and notes data. Users can exchange curated knowledge resources via .org files. I'm adding the ability to import from any browser accessible org-mode file (eg a url like https://braintool.org/topicTrees/PersonalProductivity.org ) however I'm finding that there are .org ending urls such as https://gitlab.com/publicvoit/orgdown/-/blob/master/doc/Tool-Support.org which are html documents generated from org, rather than plain text org, so I can't parse them.
 Am I safe just adding special case handling for github and gitlab? Any thoughts on some other way to handle this?

It's a normal part of my work -- during extensive find-replace sessions, I move brackets to their own lines to give me space (eg for rectangle operations and macros). I then manually go through my file and put them all back on their own lines as a final clean-up. It's this last bit that I'd like to automate, but searching online and investigating the likely libraries like Smart Parens, I don't see exactly this. Does anyone know a library, or have a handy function, that can automate this cleanup step?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just as the standard Monad laws look simpler from another angle, it seems that the Applicative laws do too. I don't think I can be the first person to notice this formulation. Does anyone know where it was written down before? Specifically, the standard Monad laws are
 return a >>= k = k a m >>= return = m m >>= (\x -> k x >>= h) = (m >>= k) >>= h 
 and the simpler formulation is
 return >=> f = f f >=> return = f (f >=> g) >=> h = f >=> (g >=> h) 
 The standard Applicative laws are
 pure id <*> v = v u <*> pure y = pure ($ y) <*> u pure (.) <*> u <*> v <*> w = u <*> (v <*> w) pure f <*> pure x = pure (f x) 
 and the simpler formulation is
 pure id <.> f = f f <.> pure id = f f <.> (g <.> h) = (f <.> g) <.> h pure f <.> pure g = pure (f . g) where (<.>) = liftA2 (.) 
 (I'm skeptical whether the last law (the "homomorphism law") is actually needed. Feels like it should be derivable from the others, but that's an investigation for another day.)

 data Int = ... | -1 | 0 | 1 | 2 ... 
 instead I see Int defined as
 data {-# CTYPE "HsInt" #-} Int = I# Int# 
 which must somehow be creating `Int as above "virtually." Or am I wrong about that? In any event can someone give me some details? Here's a statement that got me on this trail
 ​
  
The first step to realise is that all literal numbers in Haskell are constructors that construct some instance of the Num typeclass.

 So what now? Is there a way builtin to solve this? If not, I will try to hack it. But I don't want to hack the code base either.. any advice?

 I use Emacs on two computers - my main MacBook Pro and a "server" Mac that I connect to via mosh from my iPhone and iPad. I keep my org files on iCloud Drive and the sync works.
 global-auto-revert-mode also works - if I keep the same file open on both computers, I can see the changes appear on one machine when saved on another, so it obviously works.
 However, it doesn't seem to update inactive buffers in the background. So, if I refresh my agenda, the changes do not get reflected unless I switch to the buffer with the changed file and then rebuild the agenda.
 Maybe Emacs doesn't auto-revert inactive buffers unless you switch to them? If that's the case, is there any quick way to force org-agenda to reopen all org buffers on refresh?
 I tried to google it but haven't found anything useful. Am I missing something obvious?

 I have block of text similar to this:

 And i want to replace all "KC____" with "_____,"
 This regex should work "KC.{7}", and online tester shows 9 matches, but it does not work in emacs. I tried "KC.{7}", "/KC.{7}/", "/KC.{7}/gm"- 0 matches.
 What am i doing wrong?
  
UPDATE: As per cazzipropri's advice used re-builder and solved with "KC......."
 It might be good idea to switch to https://github.com/benma/visual-regexp-steroids.el/ for emacs regex.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello! I have two different emacs configurations in my home directory. I'm using chemacs (not chemacs2) to switch between them, with emacs 28.0.90:
  
~/.noivy-emacs.d/ -- The one I mainly use.
 ~/.beginemacs.d/ -- A new one, that I'm hoping to turn into a simple configuration and tutorial combination for beginners.
  
My problem is that there is now a third emacs directory, ~/.emacs.d/, which contains folders, belonging to a mixture of the two configurations:
  
~/.emacs.d/auto-save-list/ has auto-save lists from both configurations. I found a problem in the variable auto-save-list-file-prefix. Here's a snippet from C-h v. I don't know why it's getting changed away from emacs-user-directory towards .emacs.d.
  
``` auto-save-list-file-prefix is a variable defined in ‘startup.el’.
 Its value is "~/.emacs.d/auto-save-list/.saves-" Original value was "~/.noivy-emacs.d/auto-save-list/.saves-" ```
  
~/.emacs.d/elpa/ has packages installed using package.el using the ~/.beginemacs.d/ configuration. (The other config uses straight.el which puts packages in the right place.) They were also changed somehow away from emacs-user-directory towards .emacs.d.
  
``` package-user-dir is a variable defined in ‘package.el’.
 Its value is "~/.emacs.d/elpa" Original value was "~/.beginemacs.d/elpa" ```
  
~/.emacs.d/eln-cache/ has the eln-cache for both configurations. This one seems to be set by C source code to have nothing to do with emacs-user-directory. Any ideas how to change this?
  
``` native-comp-eln-load-path is a variable defined in ‘src/comp.c’.
 Its value is ("/home/ben/.emacs.d/eln-cache/" "/usr/lib/emacs/28.0.90/native-lisp/") ```
 I would like each configuration to be completely contained in its directory, because this is a mess. Any ideas?

 I want to upgrade one project to Scala 3.1, but I'm using the macro heavy chimney (https://github.com/scalalandio/chimney) to reduce the boilerplate, which is not available for Scala 3 yet. My idea was to copy and paste the code that chimney generates on 2.13, and after that uncomment the uses of chimney for now.
 Is it possible to get the code which is generated by chimney in a runnable form instead of IR (ValDef, TermTree etc.) like when using -Ymacro-debug-lite? Idealy only for a single file? The output of -Ymacro-debug-lite was gigantic.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello fellow Haskellers,
 today I released new version of headroom, this release (release notes) brings support for managing license/copyright headers in Dart, Kotlin and PHP source code files. Also it fixes annoying issue in copyright year updater feature and finally makes headroom fully compilable with GHC 9 (9.0.2 or newer).
 In case you never heard of headroom - it's small command line utility that manages license/copyright headers in your source code files. All needed is to create Markdown templates for license/copyright, fill-in some variables and that's it. It can also do some nice stuff like above mentioned feature that updates years in copyrights for you. Also some languages have extended support, where for example in Java/Scala/Kotlin files you can use class package name as template variable, and in Haskell it can even extract and reuse variables from whole Haddock module header. This release also automatically checks for new versions once per week and notifies user to command line (using this GitHub REST API) - no data collection or telemetry bullshit is happening), but if you don't like it, it can be easily disabled in configuration.
 Headroom is already few years out, but I'm always happy to hear ideas about new features or improvements, feel free to open new issue or PR in such case.

 The reason of this: I want to get inspiration on usage of Monad implementations that actually require for correctness, for example, associativity of bind. 
 The simple examples I can think of don’t strictly require monad properties. Maybe something along the lines of monad transformers or effects, but I still can’t clearly see the need. Maybe the sequence function? Or maybe this is more of theoretic interest to prove function properties/uniqueness? I’d love to read your insight on this.

 I can't remember where I found this config, but so far it works with zero problems for me. I just added my templates to it.
 ​
 So here is a quick overview of how I set it up (I don't know if all the steps are necessary, but they worked for me):
  
I created a git repo for my notes and cloned it to my machine at /home/user/Documents/roam.
 Inside the roam folder, I created my subdirectories; for this example, lets say we would like 2 roam folders: work and study.
 Inside each of those 2 folders I put a templates folder, so now the file tree looks like this: 
 roam/work/templates;
 roam/study/templates;
 
 Inside the templates folders I put all of my org templates for my notes.
 And at last …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello --
 I have a huge org-mode file (over 10K lines) and now I find that org-mode frequently writes to disc, to the point of causing a lag in the prompt availability. 1s adds up!
 I've tweaked the auto-save-interval variable (it's now 600) but this doesn't seem to influence this behavior. 
 write-region-inhibit-fsync is set no nil (default) because the manual says it safer?
 Any tips?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I'm trying to use Vollkorn as the variable-pitch-font, and it shows but I can't change boldness or size, no matter what keywords I try. For example:
 (setq doom-font (font-spec :family "JetBrains Mono" :subfamily 10.0) doom-variable-pitch-font (font-spec :family "Vollkorn" :height 100.0)) 
 :height does not seem to change anything, I similarly tried with :size. I also tried :weight 'normal but it's still some kind of bold/semibold default value. 
 I also tried describe-font on the default Vollkorn settings, which I found to be "Vollkorn:pixelsize=24:foundry=NONE:weight=normal:slant=normal:width=normal:scalable=true" I figured that this was what I was looking for, and tried
 (setq doom-font (font-spec :family "JetBrains Mono" :subfamily 10.0) doom-variable-pitch-font "Vollkorn:pixelsize=50:foundry=NONE:weight=normal:slant=normal:width=normal:scalable=true") 
 To try to increase the font size, but no change. How do you figure these things out? Fonts in emacs have always been a major source of confusion for me. Keywords that work for one font do nothing for another.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have been using org-roam for some time now and have a collection of multiple org files which are org-roam nodes stored in a folder called ~/Roamnotes. While capturing notes, I have setup org-roam to directly write to *.org.gpg files so that they get encrypted upon creation. Emacs uses EasyPG Assistant to encrypt and decrypt files automatically. So during my routine org-roam-node-find operation where I am trying to open one of the org-roam nodes (or files), EasyPG starts automatically decrypting all the nodes in my org-roam folder. This is normal and logical.
 My problem: The process of decryption is quite slow and I think could be handled by multi-processing the decryption of nodes via an external program or if possible in an async way.
 ​
 Is there a way to do this better? My roam notes collection is growing bigger and bigger and I fear that there might come a point where I might have to start the org-file decryption, take a nap and come back to it once I am awake.
 It is important for me to store my roam notes encrypted as I use them on my work and my personal computer (synced via syncthing) and it contains some quite sensitive information. One option I thought was to only encrypt files with sensitive information and keep the rest open, but this adds an overhead of always keeping in mind what I want to encrypt and what not.

 (let ((point-pos (point)) (my-complex-function) (goto-char point-pos)) 
 does work, and wrapping it in a macro
 (defmacro my-save-excursion (&rest body) `(let ((point-pos (point))) ,@body (goto-char point-pos))) 
 seems to work fine as well. How is this different from save-excursion, and is there a more idiomatic or built-in way of handling this?

 I use show-paren-mode to highlight matching parentheses, which works perfectly in all programming modes. However, for some reason, in org-mode, ( is also matched with >. This really messes things up in src-blocks as the matching is totally de-synced. Any helps/tips/comments on how to approach this weirdness will be very welcome!

I have no idea how that happened, but manually changing the encoding to utf-8 (I had to use vi for that, since I could not figure out how to do this in Emacs) fixed the issue. I leave the question below in case anyone is in a similar position, but I'll mark it as 'Solved'.
 ​
 I'm having a very hard time figuring out what the culprit here is, so please bear with me.
 I start emacs by calling emacs -q --no-site-lisp, set the value of org-agenda-files to what I normally have it set to, add an item with a special character scheduled for today to one of the agenda files, and then call org-agenda. As expected, I see the item displayed on the agenda with the special characters, say:

 If I mark the item as done on the Wednesday, the items increment to the below:

 As you can see, both the Wednesday and the Saturday entries increment by a week.
 How can I have it so that marking the item as done on Wednesday increments only Wednesday's entry and not also Saturday? (and vice-versa)
 I know I can make two separate events -- one for each day -- but that feels a little inelegant.

 TLDR: what is the command to add another tag to a heading that already has one or more tags?
 ​
 TL: the command org-set-tags-command (C-c or C-q as expressed in the manual in https://orgmode.org/manual/Setting-Tags.html) adds a tag to a heading. 
 However, when you already have tag(s), this command replaces them with the new selected one instead of adding it. 
 I didn't customize anything that may seem related, nor I found anything in the documentation or web about a command to add a new tag to a set of existing ones. Surely I'm approaching it with a non-adequate approach or keywords... 
 Can anyone point me to the documentation, or examples about how to add tags preserving existing ones? 
 As always, thanks a lot for sharing your time and attention. :)
 Best...

 n = 10^8 -- Arbitrary big number let (a,b) = partition even [0..] in (a!!n,b!!n) (\(a,b) -> (a!!n, b!!n)) (partition even 0..) 
 In theory, it seems like lines 2 and 3 should function the same way. However, there is a difference. 
 Executing line 2 uses virtually no additional memory, but a and b are computed separately (there is a noticeable delay between the first value being printed and the second value being printed).
 Executing line 3 computes a and b at the same time, but has a memory overhead proportional to n. For sufficiently large n, the process runs out of memory and terminates.
 What is the explanation for the observed difference in behavior between let-in and function application?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For my case, i recently re-implemented an old Go code of an event gateway rest API with Scala + Akka HTTP. The reason is that we are a data engineering team, and none of us are familiar with Golang stack. We re-code it to improve maintainability.
 The logic is extremely simple, the HTTP server just listens for POST requests, based on the extract the payload in raw bytes and forward to Kafka. There are mappings of 1:1 between the URI and Kafka topic so that we know where to forward the events, something like https://blah.com/api/v1/app_events -> app_events Kafka topic. These mappings are fixed and provisioned from a config file.
 Previously, with the Go (Gin) version, with 1 Core, we are able to reach 2.5K RPS. Now, with the Akka HTTP version, we could not go higher than 1.1K RPS.
 The Akka HTTP version is 10.2.7.
 Initially, we thought It could be the Kafka producer that slows the server down, but it wasn't, without the Kafka producer, RPS did not improve.
 Is this a valid outcome? That we have to accept that Go(Gin) is >2x faster than Akka HTTP?
 ==== Updated =====
 I was just performed another loadtest because I suspected at my usage of optionalHeaderValueByName directive. This time, I held down the CCU setting from Locust side to 500 as I wanted to see how much CPU it cost in each case.
  
With optionalHeaderValueByName: cost ~ 380m CPU.
 Without optionalHeaderValueByName: cost ~ 270m CPU.
  
This turned out the header extraction directive contributes significantly to CPU cost.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What are your thoughts on a „Zippable“ typeclass?
 Motivation: Many functions previously only defined on lists are being moved into typeclasses. For example, since base 4.8.0, we have elem and length in Foldable.
 There is also a discussion around moving Foldable1 into base to generalize foldl1, foldr1 and the strict versions thereof.
 I think zip and zipWith would also be great candidates for doing this.
 Many containers already define there own version of these functions, so I think adding this new typeclass in base would generalize the definition of some functions using zip to work for other containers without importing conflicting definitions.
 The definition should probably look something like this:
 class Functor f => Zippable f where zip :: f a -> f b -> f (a, b) zip = zipWith (,) zipWith :: (a -> b -> c) -> f a -> f b -> f c zipWith f a b = fmap (uncurry f) (zip a b) zip3 :: f a -> f b -> f c -> f (a, b, c) zip3 a b c = zipWith ($) (zipWith (,,) a b) c unzip :: f (a, b) -> (f a, f b) 
 Note: This code is missing some functions. zipN up to N=7 should probably be included. Also unzipN and zipWithN.
 Would love to hear your opinions on this.

I don't know how to reproduce this either, it just works when it wants to.

 EDIT: I'm running Org version 9.5.2, and Emacs version 29.0.50, the latest build from Master
 EDIT 2: I uninstalled the compiled version, reinstalled Emacs 27 from the Frdora repos, and <s TAB worked fine. It was expanded to #+BEGIN_SRC and #+END_SRC. I then uninstalled it, reinstalled the compiled version with sudo make install, and it worked. I didn't change anything. I'm not sure how to debug or reproduce this, as it seems to be finicky.

steadily innovated with language extensions and abstractions. To mention
a few, we had the IO monad, all flavors of type classes and constraints,
Template Haskell, generalized algebraic data types (GADTs), data kinds, etc.
Then we had to deal with the programs resulting from all this innovation,
which eventually sprang feelings that ranged from sticking to
Simple Haskell to supporting full motion towards
Dependent Haskell.
There seems to be two design goals at conflict in current discussions.
On the one hand, we want our programs to be easy to maintain. For
instance, changes to one part of the code shouldn’t propagate to many
others, and the meaning of a piece of code should remain reasonably
deducible from the text.

 I thought I'd try to make a nice HTML content type for servant using mustache templates.
 I have a version that works.... but it uses unsafePerformIO because it has to load the templates from disk.
 The mustache library provides a way to load templates at compile time, which I like the idea of! But I can't seem to be able to pass the template file name to the ExpQ function (I get it as a known symbol).
 Both options have made me hit my knowledge limit. I have no idea how to grab a known symbol as a string in template haskell, nor do I know if my unsafePerformIO will screw me in the future.
 Can anyone shed some light on these two points?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Learning scala and I like a lot of its syntax choices, but I don't really understand the utility of placeholder syntax in functions.
 Instead of val increment = (x: Int) => x + 1
 Apparently you could write val increment = (_: Int) + 1
 Or even more cryptically can apparently use a similar syntax for multiple variables like:
 val add: (Int, Int) => Int = (x1, x2) => x1 + x2 
 To something like:
 val add: (Int, Int) => Int = _ + _
 I can't really imagine what advantage there is to placeholder variables. Any opinions or best practices on what this language feature is used for?

But anyway, any improvement obtained "for free", by just changing the application used to build Emacs with is OK for me :).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I have an app with a Scala backend and a Scala.js frontend. They communicate via autowire, later changed to sloth for better ergonomics. (For those unfamiliar, macros generate code which takes care of serializing/unserializing arguments using upickle or boopickle or whatnot, and gives you a nice typesafe API to call back into your app without the usual ajax boilerplate).
 I would like to upgrade to Scala 3 and it seems the blockers for me are these heavily macro-based autowiring libraries. Boopickle seems to support Scala 3 by now (though not chameleon which sloth uses to abstract away boopickle).
 Since Scala 3 should enable this kind of functionality without the headache inducing macro code required on 2.x, what would people recommend as a Scala 3 solution for client-service communications, with as little boilerplate as possible, and ideally using boopickle (it's much smaller than the equivalent json and I like the obfuscation) ?
 It's all Scala front-to-back, no need to care about any other language or format, and I'm not opposed to switching it all out in order to move to Scala 3.
 Thank you for any suggestions.

It exists in every other modern IDE, GUI Application and is so extremely efficient. Even more if you can use it to look up key chords and function-names through it. 
 Which-key and helm even with "helpful" activated does not provide the discoverability that a context-menu can provide. Both offer functionality from a root node that is not narrowed down and you have to already know a function name or key chord as a intro to start. 
 A hierarchical context menu provides narrowing based on functionality in a dwim style. It is like the menu bar but in a specialized /narrowed context.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've just recently read about STM's and wanted to seek advice on correctness and good practices.
 Suppose we have a ChatSession defined as below:
 type Message = (UUID, Text) data ChatSession = ChatSession { sessionID :: UUID , clientConns :: Map UUID WS.Connection , chatHistory :: Seq Message , ... -- some more fields } 
 My question concerns modifying chatHistory a sequence of all messages sent within a ChatSession. If we were to use TVar on chatHistory, we have the following:
 updateChatHistory :: TVar (Seq Message) -> Message -> STM () 
 But what if we wanted to operate on ChatSession itself? Then we could have
 updateChatHistory :: TVar ChatSession -> Message -> STM () 
 Where inside it, the actually appending of a Message to the chatHistory remains a pure operation on Seq.
 Which of the two makes more sense? To make a more general question, I guess, should I split my data structure among multiple TVar's, or have the entire data structure be a TVar where mutations to individual fields remain pure?
 I'm still a beginner, so please let me know if I'm not using correct terminologies here and there. Thanks so much in advance!

For every new character until n characters, no completion
 At the n-th character, asynchronously query function for completion candidates
 For every subsequent key such that the first n characters have not changed, narrow completion candidates
 When the first n characters have changed, asynchronously query function again
 
When the number of characters goes below n characters, no completion
 This should be similar to grep; is there a simpler example that I can follow?

 Usually, helm and tramp work together without any additional configuration. But there is one (very common) instance where they fail me:
 For simplicity, say I have a file, /foo, on a server called remotehost. I also have a symlink /bar -> /foo on the same server. I now do an M-x helm-find-files RET /ssh:remotehost:, at which point I am prompted for credentials.
 Helm now opens the root directory of remotehost, and I type bar. The helm buffer correctly selects the only available candidate.
 I now type RET (or C-j) and am greeted by a system beep and the message:
 Trying to exit with no candidates
 The file does not open.
 All three other combinations work – opening remotehost:/foo directly in helm, opening remotehost:/bar via tramp without helm, and opening local symlinks in helm are all fine.
 Am I the only one seeing this error? I am on emacs 27.2 on GNU/Linux.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to specialize cl-defmethod on a string=, but am having a hard time understanding how to write a specializer method. Does anyone know how to structure these things? I imagine it's just a wrapper around string=, but the built in specializers are a bit more complex than that.
 Edit: Here's what I am hoping to achieve with methods:
 (cl-defmethod print-if-hello-world ((string (equal "hello world"))) (format string)) 
 Evaluating this gives Unknown specializer (equal "hello world")
 So I would like to add the specializer to cl-defmethod

 Example:
  
level 1
 default line spacing (5) 
 spacing above should be 7
 spacing above is 5
 
  
I want items on the same level to have the default line spacing (5), but want items on different indentation levels to have some extra space between them. Currently I'm achieving a similar effect by adding a new line between indentation levels.
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I'm using files in a directory with org files, I have a bunch of backup I think files that show up with weird names mirroring my open files. I don't see this for non-org files (or maybe I'm not looking hard enough since I mostly use emacs for org). The /org directory is mounted from my NAS and I'm on Linux. Here's what the files look like, where I only want the normal .org files:
 helm-find-files
 [?] .#inbox.org [?] .scratch.org inbox.org scratch.org 
 Dired
 ?????????? ? ? ? .#inbox.org -rw-rw-rw- 1 137K Jan 17 06:01 inbox.org 
 ls -ltrah
 ls: cannot access '.#inbox.org': No such file or directory ls: cannot access '.#scratch.org': No such file or directory total 1.7M ?????????? ? ? ? ? ? .#scratch.org ?????????? ? ? ? ? ? .#inbox.org -rw-rw-rw- 1 owner owner 137K Jan 17 06:01 inbox.org -rw-rw-rw- 1 owner owner 94K Jan 17 13:42 scratch.org 
 edit: on my NAS, the files show like this:
 lrwxrwxrwx 30 owner 3 Jan 14:11 .#scratch.org -> owner@laptop.1131587:1240922021 
 Do you have any idea what's causing those files or how to stop it? Or at least how, in helm-find-files and dired how to remove/filter them so I don't see them?

 I have been running emacs-jupyter (link) for a while now with no problems whatsoever. Yesterday, I moved to a daemon-client setup with the same config, and emacs-jupyter does not load at all. I have submitted a more detailed issue here. I am also asking on here to ensure that I am not doing something blatantly silly, and for which I do not need to bother the awesome package-dev.
 The relevant part of my configuration is:
 (use-package jupyter :ensure t :after org) (with-eval-after-load 'org (org-babel-do-load-languages 'org-babel-load-languages '((emacs-lisp . t) (python . t) (jupyter . t)))) 
 Has anyone faced a similar problem at some point? Any tips/comments/suggestions are very welcome! Thanks.

 Has anyone gotten this working? I tried googling and everyone seem to not have this issue since I found no answers (might also be my googling that is terrible)

 do you have any solution to see the magit regions well in the doom-theme ?
 What I mean is that there is no good readable header in the active section and the highlighted line is become a highlighted text. I think the not active section is more readable then the active one.
 It is in the status page when you check the differencies.

auto completion (while lsp works, I've found it to be "heavy" and bloated, I just need simple autocompletion)
 auto indent after return
 compiling and running files with a single stroke
 vim keybinds (evil works perfectly – no extra config needed)
 linting (i think flycheck is light enough but not sure)
 something like ivy/helm for C- and M-x completions (both are too heavy for the purpose) \n\n
  
Please recommend packages/resources for the above, the focus should be on speed and efficiency since I already have a full doom config.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello there, I'm trying to understand how to use the logict https://hackage.haskell.org/package/logict
 I understand the examples and how it works with basic variables, but I don't manage to use it with a more complex model.
 I'm trying to apply it on a Sudoku-like model, first applying the constraint on the rows :
 ```haskell import Data.Map ((!)) import Data.Map.Strict (Map) import qualified Data.Map.Strict as Map import qualified Data.Set as Set
 type Pos = (Int, Int)
 type Sudoku a = Map Pos a
 numbers :: [Int] numbers = [1 .. 9]
 newSudoku :: Sudoku (Logic Int) newSudoku = Map.fromList [((r, c), choose numbers) | r <- numbers, c <- numbers]
 rows :: [[Pos]] rows = [ [(r, c) | c <- numbers] | r <- numbers]
 getAll :: Ord k => Map k v -> [k] -> [v] getAll m ks = [m ! k | k <- ks ]
 problem :: Sudoku (Logic Int) -> Logic (Sudoku Int) problem s = do s' <- sequenceA s guard $ and (allDiff . getAll s' <$> rows) pure s'
 allDiff :: [Int] -> Bool allDiff xs = length xs == (Set.size . Set.fromList) xs
 showSudoku :: Sudoku Int -> String showSudoku s = unlines [unwords [show (s ! (r, c)) | c <- numbers] | r <- numbers]
 choose :: [a] -> Logic a choose = foldMap pure
 main :: IO () main = (putStrLn . showSudoku) $ observe (problem newSudoku)
 ```
 This usage is probably naive, the program runs forever. I'm not convinced about the sequenceA usage, put it there to typecheck and be able to write my constraint.
 I also tried another approach where I traverse the Map, trying to put a constraint on each cell, but I don't manage to insert a variable into the different 3 constraints (rows, columns, square).
 My conclusion is I don't understand the library usage, how would you solve this kind of problem?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've read in multiple places that the Haskell FFI is particularly fast. For example, this blog post on BigInt benchmarks points out:
  
Finally, GHC uses GMP, and its performance is nothing short of extraordinary. GHC is clearly tuned to call into GMP with extremely low overheads.
  
If you look at the numbers in the FFI overhead benchmarks, Haskell's overhead is almost the same as other systems languages, and much lower than other GCed languages.
 What's the secret sauce behind this result?
 I've started reading Extending the Haskell foreign function interface with concurrency; do y'all have any reading recommendations, such as parts of the source code, apart from this one?

 Hello everyone, this is my first Emacs package, a just for fun project I created for improving my elisp knowledge. Used it at your own risk.
 Enime is a sort-of elisp re-implementation of ani-cli using the same video scrapping methods but featuring a transient based TUI, because, subjectively, transient is a better UI than a CLI.

However, it appears that because of it, when I press the Tab key at the beginning of the lines, then don't indent. Instead, the cursor just goes to the beginning of the next word. Is there a way to use Tab for indenting lines (by inserting chosen number of spaces in the setting before the line beginning), while using cdlatex? 
 Thank you.

 I tried reading the paper (The Essence of Dependent Object Types) and watched the "Rock the JVM" talk about it. The basic example I see over and over is something like this:
 trait Record { type Key } def getIdentifier(r: Record): r.Key 
 What makes that better than
 trait Record[Key] { } def getIdentifier[Key](r: Record[Key]): Key 
 ? 
 I could see an argument that option 2 is clearer to someone who understands generics/comes from a Java background. 
 Would also appreciate any other examples where path dependent types do cool things!

 Typically, I just use my 'dotfiles' repo, and pull it down to a ~/home/(username)/hub folder, and then use 'GNU Stow' to just stow each folder with:
 stow -t ~ (name of dotfile folder)
 I wish I knew how to do this recursively, since its a bit tedious, but I do like how stow works in relation to dotfiles since I can't find anything just as useful. 
 Also, I use a one-way mindset meaning only one single computer has access to changing dotfiles so I don't mess anything up locally and have to go through git hell to figure out branches or to nuke, etc.
 Main Question:
  
What is everyone using to deploy dotfiles with?
 Do you do it through Emacs via Org Mode and babel? 
  
​
 Would be curious to see everyone's setup.
 ​
 Thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'd like to get pandoc into the browser. I've done some emscripten work (C++ to browser) but know nothing about compiling Haskell to the wasm+js. This could be a contract gig, the goal is an open source repo with the same license as Pandoc that can do a build of Pandoc for the browser that can run lua filters. What I'm worried about is getting emscripten to compile the C code (including the lua vm), getting Asterius or ghcjs to compile the Haskell, and getting these linked up somehow.
 Hopefully work in a fork could be upstreamed, but I think having a proof of concept would make that more likely.
 related work:
  
https://github.com/y-taka-23/wasm-pandoc (works, but no lua filters)
 https://github.com/tweag/asterius/issues/851 (asterius has a demo, but no source, and I -assume no lua filter support)
  
I'm also looking for free advice. How should I deal with the C pieces? Turn things into dylibs, something something linking? Does ghcjs have a way to link output from emscripten? Presumably I should not compile the lua vm separately and inject a JS shim for Pandoc communicating with it, although this would be more in my comfort zone?

 ​
 I am looking for alternatives for the "Algorithm W" for type interference.
 I saw another way to implement this in Stephen Diehls book : http://dev.stephendiehl.com/fun/006_hindley_milner.html 
 I like the idea of splitting up the generation of constraints and solving these constraints.
 But I don't know where this algorithm is from and if there are better algorithms/implementations for type interference. 
 Can you please help me about that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What I want to do
 My goal is to have a way to determine (in org mode) how much time has passed since a timestamp at point. For example, if my cursor is on a timestamp like this: [2022-01-13 Thu 18:34], I want to run the function and have it echo the amount of time between that timestamp and the current date and time.
 My solution
 I put together a function to do exactly that:
 (defun my-org-time-since () "Print the amount of time between the timestamp at point and the current date and time." (interactive) (unless (org-at-timestamp-p 'lax) (user-error "Not at timestamp")) (save-mark-and-excursion (unless (member (char-before) '(?\] ?>)) (re-search-forward "[\]>]")) (push-mark) (re-search-backward "[\[<]") (kill-ring-save (point) (mark)) (with-temp-buffer (insert (current-kill 0)) (insert "--") (org-time-stamp '(16)) (org-evaluate-time-range)) (rotate-yank-pointer 1))) 
 (edit: updated to use with-temp-buffer)
 My question
 I'm relatively new to elisp, so I'm wondering: is there a better way to do this? Or if not, how can I improve my solution?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 I recently changed my org install to address this message "IMPORTANT: please install Org from GNU ELPA as Org ELPA will close before Org 9.6" and now I can't get org-agenda to work. When I run org-agenda, I get the message org-agenda-get-day-entries: Invalid function: (date date) . When I make the value of org-agenda-files blank, then I don't get that error, but then obviously nothing shows up in the agenda files. I tried adding in the agenda files via customize rather than using setq , but the error shows up with both methods. 
 I found this reddit thread, but the solution to do a doom clean and build does not apply to me since I am not using doom. 
 Any assistance would be appreciated. Thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone,
 I just wanted to announce that there is a new version of the dtache package available :). The package integrates the program dtach into Emacs in order to provide detached shell commands.
 The additions to the package provided in this version are:
  
dtache comes with built in support for macOS. A timer based solution is used to issue notification
 dtache now supports eshell through the dtache-eshell.el
 dtache integration with consult is provided through dtache-consult.el
 dtache-shell-command has been majorly improved and is now an alternative to running async-shell-command
 dtache integration with compile is provided through dtache-compile.el
 dtache now has a unified dtache-detach-dwim command which is supposed to be used to detach from a session in all supported modes
 dtache now features an enhanced dtache-open-session command
 dtache now features versioning of the sessions that are persistently stored and will automatically detect when the database contains outdated session objects
 dtache now uses filenotify for both local and remote sessions, this provides an improved experience for remote sessions. Currently this is only provided on Linux based distributions
  
The package is available at https://gitlab.com/niklaseklund/dtache

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello there, entered the realm of emacs two days ago. So far it's been tears and agony. Not because I'm trying to learn a completely new keyboard system but because of the exact opposite of that; My laziness. Long story short I instantly jumped into Ergoemacs. In fact, that was the reason I found the courage in myself to try Emacs however it turned out to be a nightmare.
 I'm sorry I'm taking a bit too much let's get to the point Ergoemacs doesn't have the best guide that humankind has ever seen. The dev was talking about customization and two things specifically caught my attention; The sentence "These keys are defined in the ergoemacs-keymap" and the word "ergoemacs-layout-us.el" I been trying to locate these two things for the past five hours. I checked every little bit of creators Github I check every file that came with the package I checked every command related to Ergoemacs.
 Now I am aware that I can just write them one by one into my M-x as in the guide but I want to see the available ones and edit them. Or I can write them in my init.el using global keys but I have a slight order problem, I want things to go in one place ergoemacs-layout-us.el to be exact.
 This is probably got longer than it should be but cut me a slack will ya I've been sitting here for two days with 5 hours of sleep, talking to no one, and trying to tame the majestic beast that is Emacs.
 Thank you for listening my rant... I mean question. Your answers mean a lot.

 Some arguments in favour of committing
  
People who fork my library will be able to build it exactly the way I did, possibly simplifying bug reports
 I'll be able to build it in the same way on a different machine, or when cloning
  
Some arguments against committing
  
The freeze file pins base, and thus the major GHC version, but on CI I want to test multiple GHC versions, so I need to disregard the freeze file there.
  
None of these are crucial reasons to do one or the other. I'm wondering whether I've missed any important other reasons, since I have little experience with freeze files yet.

 But I also understand that when it comes to SQL, esqueleto seems to have a great reputation as a library. Should I stick with what I've already learned, or should I jump ship?

 basically I use for all but lisp xah-fly-mode, so it could be something like that. I am not into vi. I have some shortcuts setup manually to more sane things like I can org-edit-special and finish with Menu + d + d, similar to C-c C-c, but I don't like to do that for all the 1mio org-mode commands, and I don't want to use the crazy memonic default emacs commands.
 But I would be willing to something org-mode specific if it would be somewhat efficiant and or ergonomic, like paredit is. Paredit is not compatible really to xah-fly-keys or don't fit in with the logic behind fly keys, non the less it's very intuitive and efficiant.
 And again I would prefer to not invent a own key-binding for org that makes sense and set it up afterwards.
 There are btw a ton of frameworks that become more and more popular that view or edit org files in some sort of wiki / brain style, but inside the file you are still screwed and there seems to be only 1 way to do all the things one key binding, I don't think that is a good thing, as some people use other packages than paredit to edit lisp files.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dear friends,
After about a year of personal experiments, I present you the "Zettel Composer", a script for combining Zettelkasten notes in a variety of situations: browsing annotations, publishing a book or a paper, assembling a handout for lectures or conferences etc.
Among the nice features, the ability to "watch" files for changes and Marked 2 preview:

The experiments led me to extend the (already not universally accepted standard of) wiki link notation. This was mainly because, first, of the need to differentiate between "public" and "private" notes; and then to provide for some special behaviour depending on the different use-cases. I came to invent things like § [[1234]] to denote a "public" reference to a note to be printed; > [[1234]] for the insertion of notes containing quotes or fragments; > [[1234]] :: [[1235]] for parallel, bilingual texts. I tried my best to give appropriate documentation of these features in the project's README.
Please excuse the fact that the code is a bit messy. This is not only the result of a long process of back-and-forth experimentation but because this project was also the personal attempt to learn some Python of someone inexperienced with the language.
This project had some of its initial inspiration in books like this (V. Goldschmit's Le système stoïcien et l'idée de temps. Paris, 1953):


You may clone the project or copy the script from GitHub.]]></summary>

 I am getting an error that ox-extra appears to use a deprecated library (cl instead of cl-lib). 
 My primary issue is without it :ignore: tags in the heading don't seem to work as intended, i.e. exporting the contents of a section without the header itself. :noexport: is working fine fwiw.
 Pretty much every solution I found online says to install ox-extra though—agh!
 Could anyone point me to an up-to-date way of configuring this functionality with org export? Primarily used for latex and html if that matters. Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey friends,
 Does anyone here use Emacs LSP with SASS files? I've just started using the lsp-css package and it works great on CSS files. The problem is that on SASS files it lints the buffer as if it was CSS. Also, I don't have any in-buffer completion in SASS buffers. The title of that Emacs-LSP site says CSS/LessCSS/SASS/SCSS, but since it doesn't work OOTB and I can't find any mention of SASS in the docs nor in any variable, maybe it doesn't support SASS? In that case, what do you guys use for SASS linting and SASS in-buffer completion?
 I'm using the built-ins flymake and CAPF for interactive linting and in-buffer completion (i.e. as front-ends to LSP). The value of completion-at-point-functions in SASS buffers is (tags-completion-at-point-function). Since LSP doesn't include syntax highlighting, I also use sass-mode for that.
 Thanks a lot in advance

 I've read different posts on this, the "learn emacs in 1 year" gnus manual (which us great) just tells you to use C-u M-g (which works) but I'm looking for a way to put it into my .emacs so that it's the default behavior.
 Anyone had any luck with this? All samples for code I found in other posts were untested and finally didn't work.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, 
 I'm currently in a situation where I use templating engines (jinja2, handlebars, etc) fairly extensive. By the looks of things, web-mode attempts to implement these things, but I'm not developing templates for HTML. To make matters worse, I cannot indent within templating engine code blocks (white space has meaning). Think code which generates python code.
 What I'm currently looking for is a minor mode which highlights not only syntax (e.g. {% if foo %}Do stuff{% endif %} - but also clearly marks the background of the code block, e.g.
  {% if foo %} do stuff {% if bar %} Do Other Things {% endif %} more stuff {% endif %} 
 Where the entire text block for do stuff and more stuff has a background color of red, then Do Other Things being an inner code block has a color of green (and additional nested blocks get new colors). Obviously red/green are examples and real world colors would be more aesthetic ;). 
 rainbow-delimiters ( https://github.com/Fanael/rainbow-delimiters/ ) does this for parenthesis/braces etc but is somewhat bound to the syntax tree of whatever major mode is currently in use, it also scans on a per-character basis, where I'd need to scan for regex. 
 I've had a go using font-lock-add-keywords with regex, and while it would work for unnested code, I have no idea how to sanely deal with inner conditionals (e.g. in the above example, currently it will regex start the first if statement, but end before 'more stuff' as the lazy end terminates there. 
 Can anyone provide advice on how to achieve this, or if somebody has implemented it in the past? It would save me many headaches.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I wrote my first Emacs extension, following another discussion from reddit.
 It shows a popup with accented characters when the key combination is pressed on a valid letter. Useful for who, like me, use Emacs for writing in foreign languages with diacritics.
 Hope is useful for someone and code review/contributions are welcome! I'm still an Emacs newbie...
