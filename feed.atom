        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone. I have to run some C and Fortran programs over SSH, and need to edit the source files on the shell. I think Emacs is the right tool for such a task, and it was preinstalled on the server. Though when I open a Fortran file in emacs, I find the syntax highlighting to be really weird (dark blue text over black background - completely illegible). Now I can change the theme by M-x customize-themes or M-x load-theme, but I have to do it each time I start emacs from the terminal. For instance if I make a small modification to the source, return to shell to compile, and come back to make another small modification (say correct an error) to my source file, I have to change themes twice over.
 Hence my question is basically: Where do I configure emacs to load a particular theme every time it is opened in the terminal?
 The server has GNU Emacs 24.3.1, and runs CentOS Linux release 7.1.1503 (Core). 
 Thank you.
 Edit: It would be really helpful if someone could point me to a tutorial aimed at beginner for running emacs on the terminal. I know little about how this application works beyond the basic commands to navigate, cut-paste and save.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With this config, if I do C-x C-f upon first entering Emacs, I can navigate up and down the options ivy/counsel provides using C-n and C-p in the insert state, as expected (courtesy of evil-collection). However, every time I do C-x C-f thereafter, the bindings set in evil-collection don't work until I first enter the normal state. It seems like this is a result of this known issue; however, doing (add-hook 'ivy-mode-hook 'evil-normalize-keymaps) in counsel's :init block doesn't seem to work. Does anyone know how to ensure that I can access evil-collection's keybindings immediately upon entering the minibuffer with ivy instead of having to switch to the normal state and back first?

 Also, I did an example of how to create your own testcontainer in case when you don't have a predefined one. Example testcontainer is an Aerospike server that you can use in your test suites.
 Hope this helps!

 I am a bit confused on the following generic class behavior 
 Consider the following code in scala where I see error in https://scastie.scala-lang.org/
  import scala.concurrent._ import concurrent.ExecutionContext.Implicits.global class MySuper[Event <: Any] (myParam: String) { def produceMessage(message: Event): Future[Unit] = Future { println(message) } } class MySub[Int] (myParam: String) extends MySuper(myParam: String) { } object MySub { def apply(param1: String, param2: Int): Future[Unit] = { val self = new MySub[Int](param1) self.produceMessage(param2) } } 
 I have two questions 
  
Why produceMessage requires Nothing when the generic type is declare as Int in the subsclass in new MySub[Int](param1), I expected that the generic param type needed is Int identical to the class generic type
 Found: (param2 : Int) Required: Nothing 
 
When I changed the generic type from Int to String and param2 to String why do i get error that it requires String2 
 
 EDIT: RESOLVED turns out I am declaring the generic of my subclass incorrectly, the proper way is 
  class MySub(myParam: String) extends MySuper[Int](myParam) 
 instead of 
  class MySub[Int] (myParam: String) extends MySuper(myParam: String) {

 I'm a little lost on what's going on. Unless I'm completely mistaken (nth 2 color) is a string (I've checked via (stringp (nth 2 color))). Any pointers would be great.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone, 
 I know there is a lot of references to learn Scala in the subreddit but I'm still confused about what would be the best platform to do it. 
 I started learning the language yesterday (directly with Scala 3) and I came across a lot of information that were contradictory (sometimes even from the Scala website). For example, I still don't understand what should be the best way the compile and then run a program on the windows terminal. I'm not a programmer even though I can't say that I'm a beginner in computer science and I'm not used to all the compilation things on the cmd terminal (in general I use IDEs bc it is easier for me).
 I wrote a "test.scala" program printing the classic "hello, world !". On the windows terminal I wrote "scala3-compiler test.scala" and it compiled without problems. Then, because it seems to be impossible to run it with something like "scala3-run test.scala", I tried using the "scalac" and "scala" keywords but "scalac test.scala" didn't compile...
 I'm thinking about just loading the files in the repl to use the functions. However, I'm following scala.zone courses and they proceed in a different way to compile and run so I'm lost.
 Well I disgressed a bit from my original question : should I keep following the scala.zone courses for Scala 3 or should I try another online course ?

 free works just fine.
 (defun memory-usage () "Display Memory Usage" (interactive) (shell-command "/usr/bin/free -h . display-message-or-buffer")) 
 However, Im having trouble with mpstat. Its complaining about wrong argument.
 (defun mpstat () "Display CPU Usage" (interactive) (shell-command "/usr/bin/mpstat . display-message-or-buffer")) 
 mpstat read "." as argument :/ Weird free does not. Obviously, I have no coding skills. Anyhow, I'd appreciate learning the good syntax to fix this problem im having.

 In the last few months I have been receiving constant "JSON Readtable error :69" when using org-export to any format. I did not have this problem when using version 26.x.
 It happens with an INCLUDE statement. The file itself is straightforward org-mode text, no images,tables etc.
 #+INCLUDE: "d:/draft1/F08-Introduction.org" :minlevel 1 
 If I replace the INCLUDE statement with the actual text of the file, it works properly.
 Is there something different in Emacs 27.x that would cause this? I have updated all my packages but it did not eliminate this issue. Its rendered my Emacs installation useless for formatted output when using INCLUDE.
 If you have had this problem, JSON errors, how did you fix your problem?
 Thanks. Any help appreciated.

 After waiting for some time ...while it is saying ..."wrote to some file..." and I press $ to get a buffer and it saying

 Kinda bemused. Kindly shed some light.
 Emacs version :27.0.2
 OS: Gentoo, Arch,Slackware,Debian,Tumbleweed
 My wild guess I missed some basic configuration for magit...wondering what is that? By looking at error buffer it is certainly looking for a buffer where it can operate on, which is not invoking,
 I have stumbled over two packages "git-commit" and "with-editor" , and I have installed those ...but no avail . Wondering!
 PS : gpg ssh key added to the agent .
 Heck ....it is failing me .....the whole point boiled down , how could I sign commit if it is not prompting for passphrase??

 I want each node of the tree to have 1 or more keyboard keys that can activate an associated function.
 I looked into tree-widget.el a bit for this, but playing around with it, it either doesn't seem to be what I want, or I completely misunderstood how to use it.
 I'm pretty familiar with Lisp, but less familiar with Emacs: could anyone give me some Emacs terminology I can use to help me find what I'm looking for? Can I use Org Mode's trees?
 Edit: The resulting file might look something like this:
 + Root + Parent - Expanded Parent + Sub Parent Leafy-leaf^ 
 when the cursor (denoted by ^) is on Leafy-leaf, I could press something like j and it would run a command associated with Leafy-leaf and j.

 I’m new to org mode. Is it possible to have multiple directories for org files and org-roam?
 I would like to have my personal org files and notes for org-roam synced with my private Dropbox and all work related org-files and org-roam notes synced with my work iCloud. 
 Can this be done and preferably in a way so that if I would exclude the work org file directory, all my personal notes and todos stay the same. 
 I know that I can define multiple paths for org-agenda-files but I’m unsure of org-roam files.

 Been an emacs user for a while and started to notice my emacs feel generally laggy. I use the GUI emacs on mac. It improved after i increased the gc-threshold, but some commands that i used frequently eg, windmove for moving around windows had ~1-2 sec lag which was not normal. So i started debugging and realized that if i invoked the function from M-x rather than the keybinding it was instantaneous. Then, i changed the keybinding of windmove from 'C-c b' to 'C-c C-b' and the lag was gone. After that i noticed this is happening for a lot of my commands (swiper/ ivy switch buffer etc). 
 ​
 Why is one particular keybinding inducing noticeable lag, but the other keybinding on the same function is super fast. I've never seen anything like this and found nothing on google search. M-x profiler is also not helpful. Ideally I'd like to keep the same keybindings i have but not have this lag. Can anyone help me figure out what is going on here. Thanks.

 Solved: The thing is, dap just recognize the ~/.emacs.d/.lsp-session-v1 In my case I tried: lsp-save-vscode-workspace, edit the file then load it. When you load this file, edits the lsp-session-v1 file. After this, dap recognize the root project where I want.
 I almost get the complete C++ IDE in emacs :D, I am just get this issue with dap:
  
dap recognize project root as the .cpp dir and not the projectile dir. With this issue I need to create a new launch.json file in the same dir as the .cpp dir.
 In Vs Code in launch.json I have this variable: ${command:cmake.getLaunchTargetPath} 
 In Emacs Is there something similar?

 I have two questions;
 How do you search for the below problem?
 And how to solve it without writing out the implicit param by name, or without an inner extractor?

 You can write classes like this; case class MainState[S: State](subState: S) 
 How could you extract the State[S] evidence if you want to use it in a function, if you can't or don't want to modify the case class definition?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 When I'm looking for a file (C-x C-f) I can autocomplete. Tab is the key for completion. Now when I use a completion display package such as Vertico, I tend to use "enter" to validate my choice in the visual list. If I use "enter", it "activates" the choice: if I choose a file it opens it; if I choose a directory it explores it with dired.
 I don't like that. When I choose a directory, I actually want to go inside it to continue my search of r a file; I don't want to open a directory (I almost never used dired). So is there a way to tell find-file or the completion frameworks = "hitting enter on a directory names should be interpreted as hitting tab on the directory name".
 I know I could fix my muscle memory, but using "enter on a list" is so universal that well, I'd prefer my emacs to be set up my way.
 The closest find I found is : (setq find-file-run-dired nil). But it just makes an error instead of changing its behavior.
 Thanks.

So I thought I would crowdsource this to the Emacs community to see what people are doing in 2021. 
 How do you guys manage your ssh passwords such that they are integrated with Emacs? Ideally, I'd like to not have to use external packages to achieve this. I'm just tired of entering my ssh password every time I push to a remote repository.

GADTs
 existentials, constraints
 arbitrary kinds
 (I also like the Code representation of generics-sop)
  
Currently Generic is limited to ADTs, and only for Types and unary type constructors. This allows us to derive generic implementations like Monoid and Applicative via Generically and Generically1 respectively but with a heavier emphasis on fancy types and a growing number of type classes that don't fit this mold¹ I think it's due for an upgrade.
 One solution exists in the super powerful kind-generics library. Ryan Scott discussed a possible path for GHC.Generics. Maybe some changes are planned already? I'm curious about your thoughts
  
¹ More than I can list: Bifunctor, Biapplicative hierarchy, the Category/Arrow/Profunctor hierarchy, MonadTrans/ComonadTrans/IxMonadTrans, higher-order Monad and Comonad, lifted classes like Eq2, the indexed IxFunctor hierarchy and an n-ary Functor hierarchy.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi!
 New to Scala3, and curious what the best practices might be for strictly controlling data for class instances?
 Concretely - I want to model data coming in from a stream in a class as set-on-instantiation (but otherwise immutable) - where the values are bounded in some way - such that an instance cannot exist with values outside those ranges.
 My first instinct is a case class with a companion object and an apply method that performs validation. (Ideally returning an Option or Result - but also potentially just throwing an Exception). Does that seem idiomatic for Scala3? Or is it simpler to just have a class with a constructor and private "val" members?
 Warm thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm using org-msg like this (great package btw, doesn't get enough attention if you ask me):
 (use-package org-msg :config (setq org-msg-options "html-postamble:nil num:nil ^:{} toc:nil author:nil email:nil" ...more setq's...) (org-msg-mode 1)) 
 I have this in my gnus-specific init.el, and until today it's worked fine. I decided I wanted to use a custom attachment function, so I defined it did:
 (use-package org-msg :config (setq org-msg-options "html-postamble:nil num:nil ^:{} toc:nil author:nil email:nil" ...more setq's...) (org-msg-mode 1) :bind (:map org-msg-edit-mode-map ("C-c C-a" . my/function))) 
 This doesn't work at all. org-msg just doesn't load in message buffers (which is the expected behaviour). What's wierd is that defining the binding with define-key works fine---org-msg loads properly, and the key is bound as expected. This works with the define-key form inside the use-package form (in :config or :init) or outside it.
 I have used :bind (with :map) so many times before perfectly happily and I just can't make any headway with this. I know I could just use define-key, but I really like the organization of keeping everything in use-package.
 Some things I have tried, to no avail:
  
putting it all in my standard/top-level emacsinit.el (with all my other config)
 removing everything in the :config section except (org-msg-mode)
 putting the :bind first
 putting the function's defun before or after use-package.
 binding a different key sequence, or to a different function, or both.
  
I simply can't understand why this is happening. What is going on?

 Emacs newbie and Doom user here. I'm trying out Helm instead of Ivy and I am unable to find a function or setting that replicates Ivy's +ivy-buffer-preview. I really like seeing a preview of the buffer as I scroll by it in the buffer list.
 Is there a helm equivalent? I'm not good with elisp, so I'm not sure if there's a way to do this myself or not. 
 Any help is appreciated!

 I have ran numerous profiles which resulted in me disabling doom-modeline, lsp diagnostics modeline, and bumping gc-cons-threshold - which has made a difference, but still has the noticeable lag. 
 Meanwhile neovim runs smoothly popping up suggestions immediately and no input lag at all. Is it just reality that lua > elisp from a speed standpoint and this is one of the tradeoffs that comes to using emacs? 
 Also worth noting that I am on MacOS which i know has multiple reports of display related slowdowns.

 Here's a demo of what it allows you to do:
 Scala val first = Person("The First", 1) val second = first.having(_.name = "The Second") // copied, first remains the same val third = second.having(_.age = 50) val error = second.having(_ => first.name = "FirstMutated") // ^^^^^ Object (first : sgl.util.Person) is past it's rebuilding phase.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm working on keeping some documents that have a single content.org file, and is included in two separate files (slides.org for beamer export and notes.org for latex export).
 I'm running into image sizing issues. For example, in Beamer I'm fine with the default 0.9\textwidth or may like to specify something to fill a slide with the full \textwidth. However, in the LaTeX export, I'm using something based on the article class and a 0.9\textwidth is massive.
 In my beamer export, org-beamer-export-to-pdf from ox-beamer, it seems to be ignoring the line
 #+attr_beamer: :width .5\textwidth 
 and keeping the default. However it will change if I use
 #+attr_latex: :width .5\textwidth 
 But of course, then the article export for my notes (org-latex-export-to-pdf) will then have a large image.
 Right now, I can specify about 3.5in and it sort of works for both, but I'm not understanding why beamer is ignoring my attr_beamer keywords. I feel like I'm missing something basic, so any articles or files to read is appreciated.
 I had tried to follow something like [[ https://orgmode.org/worg/exporters/beamer/beamer-dual-format.html ][this setup]] and can throw together a MWE later today if that helps.

I've been doing my research with these libraries for the duration, but I now feel that they're well-developed and feature rich enough that they might be of wider interest.
 Goal is essentially my attempt at doing type-safe numerical optimization, with types based on information geometry, which is the combination of Riemannian geometry with probability theory, exponential families, and statistics. Some features include:

That script requires connecting to an Oracle DB on Linux, however, and I'm not sure how to get started.
 Python and Java have cx_Oracle and JDBC/Spring (respectively) offering plenty support out of the box. From a user perspective, their respective APIs take a database name (from which, I believe, the database is resolved via. $TNS_ADMIN and tnsnames.ora) and password. I couldn't find any mention/examples that straight forward with Haskell.
 The only related post I could find doesn't offer much in terms of a solution. Do people use Haskell on OracleDB? Could I get some pointers?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I have these Org properties that I'd like to re-use for multiple headlines. The properties always stay the same and in same order.
 :PROPERTIES: :Genre: :Barcode: :Label: :CatalogNumber: :ReleaseCountry: :ReleaseDate: :SourceMedia: :END: 
 At the moment for each headline I need to type out the same block of properties which is time consuming.
 * First Headline :PROPERTIES: type out all the properties :END: * Second Headline :PROPERTIES: type out all the properties :END: ... so on 
 The best I can do is copy and paste the properties. However, I was wondering if there is a way to automatically insert the property block above just by typing something short then pressing TAB, just like a snippet.
 I know there is org-capture however I would like the template to be inserted inside the document while actually working inside the document.

 Sorry for the shitty formatting. I'm completely new to programming so I don't really know what any of this means or what to do. I tried looking for solutions but it seems many of the answers are very outdated. I did manage to install stack, could I use stack to install ghc?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have on and off used Haskell a bit and have convinced myself to use it. I just got what Monads and the like actually do and mean. I can look at Haskell code and properly understand it, but as soon as I get to actually do some excersises or anything. I put down some code and it NEVER WORKS! It's been like 6 months and I can't write basic code. For the record I can and have coded applications (and guis) in other functional programming languages but can never wrap my head around how haskell wants me to think!
 Can anyone give me any advice on how to improve or what to think when coding in Haskell?
 Thanks in advance.
 CLARITY: I like the GHC compiler but can't get the result I am looking for. I have read the "Learn you a haskell for the great good" book. I am currently going through 99 problems in haskell. The real problem i think i am having is recursion. I can only really code in (and have only properly tried) FP Languages like Lisp especially Common Lisp.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been experimenting with sidebar as a child frame that is displayed on the left side of a regular frame and can be used to display any kind of information. I used it mostly to display a mue4e dashboard (https://github.com/rougier/mu4e-dashboard). I did not find how to have per-frame theme and I ended up exploiting the dark/light mode frame settings. Any theme that includes the two modes should work. I used it in conjunction with nano-theme (https://github.com/rougier/nano-theme) and the sidebar uses the dark version.
 Code is available at https://github.com/rougier/nano-sidebar but I only tested it on OSX and I don't know if it works on other systems.

 So if I am on localhost:9000/A/B/C/D and I click back, the URL will change to localhost:9000/A/B/C but the webpage remains the same. I checked the network in browser console and no request is being sent to the router/backend. On reloading the page, the webpage expected from a particular URL loaded.
 To solve this issue I added a javascript file which listens to the event popstate and everytime I press back(The URL chanegs) and it reloads the page from the URL.
 By doing this a request is sent via the Router and which is expected to be seen gets loaded. This however is causing me problem. When I do this, the front button of the browsers gets greyed out. window.history.forward(1) gives me undefined. Similar is the case with window.history.back(-1).What should I do? Please help.

 In short: there is no right way.
 If you don't agree or if you doubt my statement, you really should read the article. My blog tells me that the average reader should not spend more than four minutes for reading it.
 It's my new go-to URL for Org mode beginners who are trying to get how to use Org mode properly. You might feel the same.
 Have fun.

My current elisp effort is to toggle an emacs face value between a new value and back again to its original value, whatever it is. This is the way I came up with by utilizing bound-and-true-p with or, but I realize there might be a function I am missing or an idiom I haven't observed for this use case. Suggestions are welcome.

 Meanwhile Show is extensible, but not customizable. It can render user-defined types, but there's only one way it's going to render anything. (I suppose showsPrec means it's a bit more than one, but close enough.)
 A thing I think I'd find useful for debugging is something that's both extensible and customizable, letting the top-level caller control how much of a data structure to see. Let's call it gist, and assume it's implemented by a typeclass Gist. It might be that the instance for Gist a => Gist [a] by default works much like show, with gistDefault …]]></summary>

( On that note I wonder if there should be a better arrangement of features not as a list but as a category- say conciseness, interop with java, advanced type stuff, quick repl usage, maintainable enterprise software dev etc ) . Also, I'm not going to lie, some of my interest was indeed dampened by the earlier FUD, and might have checked it out earlier. I would suggest the marketing team starts calling it scala 3 right now and pushes this as a beta to help renew interest.

This weekend I decided to see if I could get it in a working state as I have to write a lot of PHP in the near future.
 My problem with LSP mode and php language servers has been that they try to parse and cache every single file in your entire project. I have had php-language-server die on me with memory leaks from indexing an enterprise application with 1000s of classes and trying to keep it all in memory. phpinspect.el only parses files on an as-needed basis, kind of like the php autoloader, and keeps its cache in a global variable which you can unset to purge it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been running PureGTK emacs for some time on my laptop and very happy with it - so I installed the same package (emacs-28.0.50-1.20210814.git92bc69e.fc34.x86_64) on another machine but there is a bit of a mystery about the "Options->Set Default Font..." menu item.
 On my old laptop (where I've been running pureGTK for some time) that menu item invokes a GTK dialog to pick the font:
 ​
 result of pgtk-popup-font-panel
 On the new machine, I get an ugly-arse menu selector:
 ​
 ​
 result of mouse-select-font
 Digging into it, I find that the menu button invokes "x-select-font" if it exists, otherwise "mouse-select-font" which is the ugly one. On the old laptop (where "x-select-font" is working) I have:
 x-select-font is a function alias and interactive for pgtk-popup-font-panel, defined in C source code. 
 On the new machine, there is no such alias or function as "x-select-font" - although pgtk-popup-font-panel _does_ exist.
 I can't see where "x-select-font" is aliased in my ~/.emacs.d or /usr/share/emacs - except for a mention in the DOC file and /usr/share/emacs/28.0.50/lisp/term/pgtk-win.el.gz - why would this latter file be ignored?
 I can do the aliasing manually:
 (defalias 'x-select-font 'pgtk-popup-font-panel "Pop up the font panel. This function has been overloaded in Nextstep.") 
 ... and it works like the old machine. But why is that not done for me automatically in the new machine? Any idea what's going on here?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, Emacs newbie here.
 I'm trying out dart lsp-mode with company and there seems to be a bug; Anytime i use the dropdown completion feature for a method with arguments, instead of making the arguments tabbable (highlight the first argument, <TAB> goes to the next, S-<TAB> to the previous), just like with yasnippet and company + irony, it rather inserts the arguments as raw text and puts the point after the closing bracket, <TAB> does nothing.
 ​
 The argument is tinted a bit, as if it tries to support it, but it something went wrong
 is the problem with company/lsp-mode/lsp-dart/emacs? Is there any way I can fix it? or should I open an issue on github?
 BTW any tips to make lsp-mode faster would be appreciated. I'm using widows 10 and the experience isn't as smooth compared to vscode

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So ideally, I would like to generate a list of N 0.0%-100.0% elements with 0.1 as step, however 0 to 1000 with 1 as a step may be eaiser since I don't have to deal with floats. I had no idea how to generate this in haskell so I ended up just making a bunch of lists with random numbers that sum to 1. See below for code:
 ``` type Weight = Float
 nWeights :: Int -> IO ([Weight]) nWeights n = replicateM n $ randomRIO (0.0,100.0)
 balancedWeights :: [Weight] -> [Weight] balancedWeights ws = map (\x -> x / (sum ws)) ws
 portfolioWeights :: Int -> Int -> IO [[Weight]] portfolioWeights sim n = replicateM sim $ fmap balancedWeights (nWeights n) ```
 However, of course this will only really work if I create a REALLY large list and becuase of the distribution, alot of lists will be "duplicates". Since the normal distribution would would for example create [0.33,0.33,0.33] where N=3
 Im really stumped as to how i would generate this list in a recursive manner? Any help/hints is very appreciated!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have been trying to investigate why mu4e sub-processes (such as mu4e-proc and mu4e-update) after exiting stick around as zombies. (They show in list-processes and process-attributes show them with zombie status. This ends up causing problems with launching subsequent sync operations).
 After doing some further testing, it seems this is the case for all sub-processes launched in emacs with my setup. For example, launching a simple process that just sleeps for 20 and exits:
 (start-process "my-process" "foo" "sleep" "20") 
 This process continues to show under list-processes well after it has exited. It's attributes also show that it is a zombie process. 
 Digging in further, the docs say that the variable delete-exited-processes controls whether or not these get cleaned up. It is set to t. So I would assume these should be getting cleaned. Yet looking further into the list-processes function, it seems to clean up processes that have a state of exit, signal or closed, which makes sense. 
 Yet in my testing above with the sleep process, it is showing with a state of run (despite that fact the the process has exited and the attributes show it as a zombie).
 So it seems that even when processes are exiting normally, they never switch into the exit or closed state, become zombies, and never get cleaned up by emacs. 
 A bit in the weeds here, but was curious if someone has any insight into what is happening?

Links aren't always bidirectional. E.g.: Let's say I have an overview Zettel on Maria Popova's note-taking method. From this Zettel, I may link to a Zettel explaining how she uses sticky tab notes. But, the latter Zettel might not link to the former.
Another thing to note is that the item in the bottom of the image may link to further details. This might happen when you break down a Zettel that violates the Principle of Atomicity. E.g.:
Topic-based overview: "Maria Popova's note-taking system."
Idea relevant to the overview: "Idea index definition."
A detail of the idea: "Reading is about identifying patterns."
A detail of the detail: "Pattern definition."
I based my diagram on what's been discussed in the Zettelkasten blog, so others' Zettelkasten might look different.
Questions for the reader:
What would you change of my diagram?
How does your Zettelkasten look like?]]></summary>

I'm an 20-year-old female. I have a bunch of mental issues that are either inherent or results of life experience. I love reading - the only thing that keeps me from continuing to read is mental fatigue, lack of sleep. To me reading is a way of escape.
When I acquire new knowledge, I find myself a little more free from all the mental stuff. Sometimes I find myself doing things in slow motion because my brain is reserving energy for processing information.
However I'm not so happy with the amount of info I retain so I have been looking for a way to take better notes and Zettelkasten sounds like what I need! I have been reading about it yesterday evening but I'm still not able to fully grasp this method (I find myself in slow motion again).
But anyways, nice to meet you, everyone!]]></summary>

  (add-hook 'this-mode-hook 'lambda () (local-set-key (kbd "<f9>") #'specific-function) (local-set-key (kbd "<M-up>") 'another-function))) 
 Now the F9 keybinding works fine, but the M-up always returns an error when I enter that mode:
 M- must prefix a single character, not up
 I've tried using various combinations: "M-<up>", "\M-<up>" but the same error is returned. Clearly there's something very elementary I'm missing here - but I can't find what it is. 
 I should add that this is Emacs in Windows: GNU Emacs 26.3 (build 1, x86_64-w64-mingw32).
 Thanks!

 'sed -n l' now shows anything on tmux pane switch so I can't map key sequence to anything too.
 Why that happens on how is right way to dealing with that?

 I'd really like to be able to do this in Scala, but my skills in Scala.JS and Firebase are too humble to figure this out from scratch given how fast I want to iterate on this app. I Googled for an example project but couldn't find one. The Scala.JS website suggests it should be quite possible.
 Have you built/have a working example of a Scala.JS app that uses the Firebase SDK?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I use org-expiry to expire old tasks. I really like this functionality, but I don't like manually expiring. I'm looking for either via a script I can schedule with run-at-time or something I can add to before-save-hook that automatically expires applicable entries. 
 I'm not good at elisp yet so maybe I'm going in the wrong direction, but I tried a function like this:
 (defun expire "" (interactive "r") (org-expiry-process-entries (0 1000) ) 
 The arguments for org-expiry-process-entries is beg and end per the source file, and the function will "Process all expired entries between BEG and END.
 I can take the interactive part out to run as a script, but with that in for testing, it says: wrong number of arguments (lambda nil "" (interactive "r") (org-expiry-process-entries (0 1000))), 2 on a file that has >1000 lines - let alone it's better to use something like (org-expiry-process-entries ((beginning-of-buffer) (end-of-buffer))), which also fails with the same message.
 The closest other script I can find out there is this post by John Wiegley about auto archiving done entries, but this code is way above my head and it seems like org-expiry-process-entries does what I want, just interactively.
 Does anyone have a process like this or suggestions on how I can make this process work?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, I am creating an Org mode template for a koma letter. All works well. This is the org file:
 #+LATEX_CLASS: my-letter #+DATE: \today #+AUTHOR: Sender name #+SUBJECT: A simple letter #+FROM_ADDRESS: Sender address #+FROM_ADDRESS: Sender city #+TO_ADDRESS: Receiver #+TO_ADDRESS: Receiver address #+TO_ADDRESS: Receiver city #+OPENING: Dear John, #+CLOSING: Yours truly, #+SIGNATURE: Jane #+LANGUAGE: en #+LATEX_HEADER_EXTRA: \setplength{toaddrhpos}{-100mm} Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur. Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum. 
 There is a tiny hiccup: in order to adjust the horizontal position of the TO address, I need to modify the variable toaddrhpos. In nomal LaTex file, I can do this with: \setplength{toaddrhpos}{-100mm} to move the addressee field 100mm to the left. I tested this in normal .tex file and it works. How do I set it in an Org file? As you can see, I tried to put that field in the #+LATEX_HEADER_EXTRA, it doesnt work. I also tried to put it in #+LATEX_HEADER_EXTRA and it doesnt work. Last but not least, I also tried to just write out \setplength{toaddrhpos}{-100mm}, and still it doesnt work. How do I go about to set this variable?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[use-package's :after causes the configuration of a package to be wrapped in an eval-after-load block, and it's causing some unexpected timing issues with which package has its configuration done first. Notably, if I do:
 (use-package evil-org :after org ... ;;config for evil-org ) (use-package evil-org-agenda :after (org evil-org) ... ;;config for evil-org-agenda ) (use-package org-agenda :after (org evil-org evil-org-agenda) ... ;;config for org-agenda ) 
 ... and then call org-agenda, the order of configuration is 1. org-agenda, 2. evil-org-agenda, 3. evil-org - the opposite order of what I'd expect.
 Here's a pastebin of my config with the use-package macros expanded and cleaned up a bit, so if someone would be willing to help me understand the life cycle, I'd really appreciate it. I think I understand the beginning:
  
I call org-agenda using C-c a
 org-agenda requires org and triggers org's loading
 The eval-after-load 'org block in evil-org's block is triggered and does its setup of hooks. At this point, evil-org isn't truly loaded yet, since its config block inside an eval-after-load 'evil-org doesn't run.
  
However, after this point I'm lost. We've just established that evil-org isn't loaded, but the next thing to run is the stuff inside org-agenda's config block, which requires (org evil-org evil-org-agenda) to be loaded - which implies we skipped both the eval-after-load 'evil-org mentioned above as well as evil-org-agenda's config block, which only required (org evil-org).
 The documentation for eval-after-load specifies that if FILE is loaded, the body is evaluated immediately afterwards. How then is it possible for org, evil-org, and evil-org-agenda to go from unloaded to loaded without triggering the stuff inside (use-package 'evil-org ...) or (use-package 'evil-org-agenda ...) first?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi. Couple days ago I saw a video on youtube about EXWM, that blew my mind. So I thought to switch from dwm to EXWM, but I never used emacs, I'm learning it now, that's quite easy. The thing that most impressed me besides emacs in itself was the Lisp language, such a cool language!
 I switched from Windows to Linux because it is more flexible and it lets you customize a lot of things. I wish to have a Dynamic OS, but with Tilling Window Manager like dwm It is a tough task to achieve, so maybe EXWM + Emacs can do what I want.
 But before I dive into the emacs world I have a few questions:
 Can I have a statusbar integrated with modeline likes this:
 https://preview.redd.it/s6wkhsea65k71.png?width=1047&format=png&auto=webp&s=7d4846e51146409e7d25a78866773027c67e44e2
 Can I have custom mini-buffers that does stuff like show a playlist of music/videos and support custom formatting style and images?
 Can I have an image frame in different workspaces as background and still be able to write text? Its similar to the concept of setting a wallpaper with feh or hsetroot and make emacs transparent, but on emacs buffers instead on the X11 thing. There are some DEs that allow you to have different wallpapers per workspace.
 I know I can intercept a function call and adds other funcionality, like change the wallpaper with hsetroot. But doing like that I would see my wallpapers behind the emacs, I want to see like if I had spawned sxiv in a buffer with EXWM.
 Since emacs is a GUI application, I believe all of this is possible. I don't care If I will have to write 1000 lines of e-lisp or more, if this is possible, I will do my best to accomplish it.

 I have a bigger program that I am trying to understand (and will likely post at some point), but I have isolated a small piece that I can ask an intelligent question of.
 I have this script:
 ```haskell
 !/usr/bin/env stack

 I have a data-build process that I run as a compilation, and the error checking matches a time stamp as an error, and tries to open a file based on it, which is a pain. I could find the exact pattern that's doing the match and remove it—it's likely that I don't need it for anything I'm doing anyway—but honestly, there are zero times when I want that buffer parsed for errors. I just want to shut them off while the compilation is running, and then I'll turn them back on after.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello Haskell!
 I've recently started working on a project that allows the creation of IQ files that can be plaid back through SDRs (code here). Heavily influenced by GNURadio, this project allows easy modulation/synthesis of data on the command line and it makes use of the Pipes library, keeping the runtime memory footprint as low as possible.
 I'm looking to extend this by adding:
  
More modulation types
 Demodulation
 A set of components that can be composed together at runtime.
  
That last point is an interesting one. I'm aware that Pipes speed mainly comes from fusion optimisation. I was thinking that it would be nice to have something similar to gcc's libgccjit, allowing JIT optimisation of a composed pipeline, increasing performance. Another nice side-effect of this approach is that by using the type system, you could have runtime typechecking of the pipeline, preventing uncomposable components to be connected. I couldn't find anything in GHC that facilities this unfortunately.
 Feedback appreciated!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I just read through part of the transcript of the latest podcast[1] of Haskell Weekly, "Dependent types with Vladislav Zavialov", until they were (I think) done talking about sigma and pi types. Still confused, I bounced to Wikipedia[2]. At this point I think I understand what they are, and how they differ.
 Suppose A is a type in some collection of types U, and B is a type family from A to U. That is, an input to B is some member of the type A, and an output from B is an entire type from U. Then:
 (1) Sigma [x:A] B(x) is the collection of pairs (x,y) for x:A and y:B(x).
 (2) Pi [x:A] B(x) is the collection of function-like things mapping every input x:A to some y:B(x).
 (3) Therefore, every element of a pi type can be seen as a cross section of the corresponding sigma type.
 If (3) is correct, then the title of this post is wrong -- the title suggests that the pi type itself, rather than each of its members, is a cross section of the corresponding sigma type.
 Have I understood?

a widely known Haskell solution to the expression problem, is to lift all constructors to the type level, and use type classes to implement cases where you'd normally use pattern matching. The solution presented in this paper essentially makes this the canonical method of pattern matching, ie. pattern matching is reduced to dictionary dispatch. The connections to OO vtables is obvious I hope.
  
I decided to give it a try and implement a simple interpreter that doesn't have an Expression Problem (which means that both types and operations can be added without modifying existing code).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'll give a quick example of what I am talking about, first.
 You have a product type:
  data MyProduct = MyProduct { productFoo :: Foo , productBar :: Bar , productBaz :: Baz } 
 and some way to isolate each "piece" of that product type:
  data SomePiece = PieceFoo Foo | PieceBar Bar | PieceBaz Baz 
 With this example in mind, imagine you have a (possibly infinite) list of SomePiece, and you would like to construct a MyProduct as soon as possible. Perhaps, this means that whenever you encounter a piece in your list, you hold onto it and ignore future pieces of that type, or you possibly drop the old piece in favor of the new piece of the same type, or perform some kind of combining function on the pieces. Whenever you have all the pieces needed to construct a MyProduct, you do so and stop pulling off the list.
 Of course, you also have to take into account the possibility that the list terminates before we receive all the required pieces, so we wrap the return type in Maybe:
  constructMyProduct :: [SomePiece] -> Maybe MyProduct constructMyProduct = undefined 
 What are some good solutions to this problem? Are there any general solutions, that will work for other product types with different numbers of arguments? A library or portion of a library that focuses on this would be ideal.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If I wanted to define a type Foo such that Foo is really an Int with values expected within a range - is there a way to do this without needing to wrap the value (and instead behave more like a primitive type)?
 So instead of:
 val x = Foo(value=20) if (x.value > 10) ... 
 You could instead do:
 val x: Foo = 20 if (x > 10) ... 
 and so on.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I use timeblocking to plan my days one week at a time. I used to use thunderbird, and with the lightning extension I got a very clear, graphical interface for planning out my week (synced using a google calendar) and adjusting the time-blocks dynamically during the week.
 I recently moved to mu4e and in terms of emails, it is absolutely and utterly fantastic. However, I have not been able to find a good planning replacement. I know and use org-gcal which is very good in terms of syncing with google calendar. However, I really miss the ease with which I could view my time-blocks. org-gcal has a weekly view mode, but it does not have any way of showing 'blocks' of time - every event is just a single line (which often doesn't fit in the column).
 I know the emacs universe is too vast for any one person to know and try all the packages. So, I would like to ask for tips and suggestions from people on here. If you time-block using emacs and would like to share how you go about doing it, I'd be very interested to know.
 Cheers

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone! We got back to working on "Magical Haskell" book, finished the first 5 chapters (about 5 more are coming up), and would very much appreciate the feedback of the community.
 The book has a goal of teaching Haskell gently, using lots of visuals and pictures, but from the first principles - so NO imperative patterns, but functional thinking, Types, building up powerful abstractions naturally to develop intuition. We have by now invented a Functor as well as a Bifunctor, Applicative and Monad are coming up :)
 The book is available here: https://leanpub.com/magicalhaskell
 Any feedback / comments / suggestions are highly appreciated!

I also want to make my .emacs.d more portable and have all the packages I used installed manually so I can take it with me wherever I go. I downloaded and unzipped the git repo for expand-region into a folder called ~/.emacs.d/offline-packages and I added this to my init.el file
 ```
 (add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/offline-packages/")
 (load 'expand-region)
 (require 'expand-region)

 (global-set-key (kbd "C-=") 'er/expand-region)
 ```
 but when I reload my init.el file I get this error
 ```
 Wrong type argument: stringp, expand-region
 ```
 Does anyone know what this means?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Is this book still a good intro to parallel and concurrency in Haskell? Are there any notable supplementary resources for the topic?
 I ask because I myself am trying to design an application that needs to be heavily concurrent (e.g., scanning client emails to do text analysis for malicious content) and the concurrent section of the book seems to be a nice survey of the various strategies (like STM or actor).

I am constantly surprised at how simple it is, once you've wrapped your head around evaluation, algebras, and higher-order functions. The more I learn, the more I am aghast at how messy the OOP paradigm can be. Haskell has types and typeclasses, and that's it! No need for interfaces, sub/super classes, constructors, scoped variables, none of that stuff.
 I love Haskell!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Let's say I'm a teacher and I want to explain the superiority of typed Haskell over, say, C++. C++ has structures, has enumerated things, has, above all, objects. Let's say for example we want to model the standard astronomical measurement for a star in the sky. It's made up of two parts, i.e., a right ascension α and a declination δ. How could I create a Haskell type for a star location out of these two? How would it be preferable to anything C++ might do, object or structure-wise? And how could I build in the allowable angle ranges of 0 ≤ α ≤ 360 ◦ and −90 ◦ ≤ δ ≤ 90 ◦ respectively. In SQL I can restrict a field to certain allowed values, ranges. How to do this in Haskell? So my audience is a math class that has heard of C++ but not Haskell and is thinking of a language for numerical analysis of, say, Calculus.

And even that might not prevent the shenanigans. This is not fun at all, although scala itself would be. And for what, spending 2x as much time in peer review than in development, making zero progress that would actually move my employer forward?
 I'm really tired of it. It's not even nitpicking, not like pointing out typos, more like
 "I don't like this, I like my version better, therefore go spend an hour redoing it. Multiply by number of team members and code length / complexity times some factor f.
 Like it wasn't good enough in its original version. It's not like I put a var in. It's not like I broke referential transparency so you have to make it a showstopper. So I used a feature more heavily than you'd like. I still like it, how about you mind your own buiness? So I didn't use this technique you like, so what? So I used a technique you disliked, so what? Etc.
 Maybe I would put up with it if metrics by which I'm judged would have anything to do with code quality, but even then, at some point actually getting things done would be nice.
 Is it like this everywhere? Or in all more functionally oriented teams? It sucks so much I'm considering leaving the language because of this. I've seen other stuff, I know it doesn't have to be like this (even if you have garden variety nitpickers and similar team members everywhere, but it's usually not this pervasive). Using typeclasses and all the other cool stuff is very cool indeed, but not really worth it if I have to put up with this.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I defined the following trait in Scala 3
 trait A[T <: Tuple] 
 using Scala 3 macros i then create objects of this trait performing further checks on the actual types of the tuple T; in particular I want to check that all the types (T_1, ..., T_n) of the tuple T are subtypes of another given type - B:
 trait B private def allSubtypesOfB[T <: Tuple: Type](using quotes: Quotes): Boolean = { import quotes.reflect.* case '[Nothing] => false // I don't want nothing to be in T case '[head *: tail] if TypeRepr.of[head] <:< TypeRepr.of[B] => allSubtypesOfB[tail] case '[EmptyTuple] => true case _ => false } inline def createA[T <: Tuple] = ${ createAImpl[T] } private def createAImpl[T <: Tuple: Type](using quotes: Quotes): Expr[A[T]] = { import quotes.reflect.* if !allSubtypesOfB[T] then report.error("All types in T must be subtypes of B") // ... create instance of A } 
 the problem is that later I need to call, for each type in the tuple type T, a method that has the following signature:
 def doSomethingWithBSubtype[T <: B] = ??? // Do something with type T 
 so the code would look something like this:
 private def createAImpl[T <: Tuple: Type](using quotes: Quotes): Expr[A[T]] = { import quotes.reflect.* if !allSubtypesOfB[T] then report.error("All types in T must be subtypes of B") Type.of[T] match { case '[head *: tail] => doSomethingWithBSubtype[head] case '[EmptyTuple] => ??? } // ... create instance of A } 
 This code won't compile as the compiler says that head must be a subtype of B to be used in the method doSomethingWithBSubtype. However, with the if preceding the match case I already ensured that all types inside T are subtypes of B. Is there a way to force the compiler to recognise head as a subtype of B?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This seems like something that should be easy but I can't for the life of me figure out how to do it.
 I have a heading, with a subheading inside it that has some text. I would like then to add more text but at the level of the first heading and not the second but I can't find how to get the text to be considered part of the parent heading without adding a new top level header. 
 The source file looks something like:
 * Heading Paragraph of heading level. ** Subheading Paragraph of subheader text. Paragraph that I want at Heading level but is at subheading level. 
 How can I tell org mode that the last paragraph isn't under subheading but is in fact under heading again or are you stuck inside a bullet list until you add a new heading to get you out?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Edit: I now see my title maybe isn't clear. The emphasis is on you, I'd like to hear how you make presentations.
 My go-to way of making presentations right now is Org-mode exporting to Beamer. Howerver, I do like to mess with commands like pause, onslide, only, and alert<n> which just is a big pain to do in Org-mode. I have come to the point that if a slide is even remotely complex I just only write the heading in Org-mode itself and then BEGIN_EXPORT latex the rest inside latex. It works, but it is far from ideal. For example, setting up columns in Org-mode is really cumbersome.
 Anything that works better? I need the Tex Math, but any other tool that can render my Tex equations would be nice. The only thing I really miss about WYSIWYG editing like powerpoint is adding annotations such as arrows; it is just a big pain having to define these coordinates vs the drag and drop.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've just started using emacs with systemd (so using the client/server system) but for some reason this is not setting the font properly. The relevant part of my init.el is
 (set-face-font `default "Jetbrains Mono-16") (set-face-font `variable-pitch "Cantarell-16") (copy-face `default `fixed-pitch) 
 It does work fine though when launching with emacs
 I'm guessing it's something to do with emacs not loading fonts until the first frame appears, but I have no idea how to wait for the first frame to set it.
 Anyone know how to do this? (I'm also quite new to emacs lisp, I recently moved from neovim)

 controllers.ViewController.person

And then it goes to the HTML file which renders the page.I want to be able to go back and forth using the buttons on the back and forward buttons on the browser. What should be the approach and what are possible solutions? I am just stuck on it and all Scala play tutorials are manually changing the URI so I do not know how to utilise the back/front button.
 Edit: I am trying to debug a project and learning scala/play as I go. I am having this issue and just do not understand on why I am having it. I am looking for an approach on how do you get your scala project to be compatible/work with the back/forward buttons.
 How to I load the cached version of the page through back button?
 Edit 2: Adding more info
 ​
 What is happening:
 URI: http://localhost:9000/person/height/78478
 ​
 On clicking back URI changes to
 > URI: http://localhost:9000/person/height
 But the webpage remains same.
 ​
 On clicking back again:
 > URI: http://localhost:9000
 But webpage is still same.
 ​
 On clicking forward:
 > URI: http://localhost:9000/person/height
 and webpage is still same

These notes follow Noon, Arnaud, and Richard through their day at ICFP,
roughly in order.
Noon — On Continuation-Passing Transformations and Expected Cost Analysis
Discussion of the difficulty of costing probabilistic algorithms (i.e. you don’t know what it will do.)
Turns out using continuations makes it a bit easier to reason about (I didn’t quite follow the trick that makes it true),
But, it gives a way to think compute average-cost analysis, which seems pretty useful!

 I want to modify the modeline to display only what I need: the buffer name, the point line and column number and the number of characters and lines in the region when it is active. I am using evil.
 From what I understood, the default modeline can provide the buffer name and the point line and column number. If I want the number of characters and lines in a region, modeline-posn.el is one of the solutions.
  
My 1st problem is that when I use modeline-posn.el, it looks like (setq column-number-indicator-zero-based nil) is not taken into account anymore. Indeed, when I put the point in the 1st column, I expect to see in the modeline that the point is in column 1 but I see 0.
 
My second problem (I do not know if it is related to the 1st one) is that when I enter the evil visual state, …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm curious if anyone has experience with a dual-zettelkasten format.  So far, it hasn't caused any (major) problems.
If I write a "good" zettle diligently and feel too lazy to rewrite the full note in digital form, particularly a note with lots of diagrams (mathematics, etc) I'll resort to the following...
Workflow: Physical to Digital
Scan the zettle making sure its readable
Create a zettle with the same id and title in digital form
Insert the scan as a large image
Write the header in digital form (using a physical-scan-template) this is quick
Write any links in digital form
Write a one-sentence summary in digital form.
Liberally use NON-hashed tags for keywords in the scanned text for easy searching.
Keep the physical copy and add to physical slipbox
At some point, if I get around to it, I will slowly convert notes that have been post-semi-digitized per the above into purely digital form.
I find the above most helpful when doing mathematics: the diagrams of category theory can take lots of time to write in latex. So if you have a particularly well-formed note with lots of notation, then I've found this method can work out fine in the short-term.  The most important items -- by trial and error -- from above are 5 6 and 7 so as to preserve the ability to search, link, and see a short summary.
Workflow: Digital to Physical (perhaps this is a bit obsessive)
At the end of each day collect the digitally created zettels from that day (easy with timestamp ID)
Print them out 2-per page and cut in half
Add to physical slipbox
Always maintain a printed copy of any index or structure notes.
Now you have a synchronized digital and physical slipbox. Its not perfect but sometimes the good enough, is.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I would like to increase the amount of indentation when I'm coding by 1.5-2x, or something along those lines. Actually setting the indentation width to more space characters would make all formatters and other programmers upset. I also think that formatting according to my preference on file open, then formatting back to the default on commit, could lead to unwanted whitespace changes and, again, make other programmers upset. Is there a way to fake increase the indentation width? I use spaces, so is there a way to only increase the width of spaces when I'm coding, that is efficient enough to deal with the large number of spaces that tend to exist in most files?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have had a realisation.
 For the OO programmer, one can think of monads as a general case of optional chaining.
 This may be a mathematical over-simplification, however, it's an easy way to think of monads.
 Like optionals in swift:
  if let johnsStreet = john.residence?.address?.street { print("John's street name is \(johnsStreet).") } else { print("Unable to retrieve the address.") } // Prints "Unable to retrieve the address." 
 Just 20 >>= half >>= half >>= half ... Nothing 
 I guess the extra piece is that monads allow one to specify specific rules for "progress" to continue rather than just being nil/nothing, but its pretty close right?
 Whatcha think?

 I'm currently using Emacs 27.2 with built-in Org mode (9.4.4) and so far, I am quite satisfied with my patch-work org citation solution. And yes, that is without using the newly introduced org cite framework **exited NPC noises** (see tecosaur's July digest).
 Currently my setup (simplified for the sake of argument) involves the addition of a org-link-parameter:
 (add-to-list 'org-link-parameters '("cite" :follow embark-act)) 
 and following B. D'Arcus' suggested bibtex-actions configuration I add an action-keymap pair to embark:
 (add-to-list 'embark-keymap-alist '(bib-reference . bibtex-actions-map)) 
 BUT, since this is not Org 9.5 with all its' tremendous linking support, I am not able to connect my custom org-link parameter to the embark action, which is unfortunate...
 I have tried it with the :keymap keyword (in org-link-parameters), but I think I'm at the wrong place. I guess I'll have to extend the :follow part, but somehow I have difficulties to connect the dots.
 Any help would be greatly appreciated and let me know if you need more information!

 Here's a trivial example:

 Now, I can't figure out two things:
 1) How can I chain the data through multiple blocks? e.g.:
 #+name: names #+begin_example json ["David", "Anna", "Stephen", "Bob", "Alice"] #+end_example #+name: words_and_names #+begin_example json :var names-data=names {"words": ["Mauris", "felis", "velit", "tristique", "imperdiet"], "names": ${names-data}} #+end_example #+begin_src sh :var data=words_and_names :results verbatim echo ${data} #+end_src #+RESULTS: : {"words": ["Mauris", "felis", "velit", "tristique", "imperdiet"], "names": ${names-data}} 
 As you can see, that sadly doesn't work. Is that even possible?
 2) Also, is it possible to load something into a var from a file, instead of another block?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm pretty new to Haskell and asking myself how to solve the following problem. I have a simple data structre like this: 
 data Document = Document { title :: String, content :: [String], wordCount :: Int } 
 I want to have besides the default constructor where I have to provide a title and the content another one where I just have to provide the title and the content or just the title. And I also want to have a constructor function that creates out of a completely different data structure a Document. 
 I find it pretty nasty to name all these constructor functions differently. Especially since I encountered this problem with a lot of different data structures. So I decided to use ad-hoc polymorphism provided by a generic type-class: 
 class Factory a b where create :: a -> b 
 Which I use like this: 
 instance Factory String ([String] -> Document) where create title words = Document { title = title, words = words, wordCount = 0 } instance Factory String Document where create title = Document { title = title, words = [], wordCount = 0 } instance Factory RawDocument Document where create RawDocument{..} = create title (splitOn " " content) 
 Now I can use simply the create function everywhere with the defined input types. And it scales nicely with all my data structures. 
 Do you see any problems with this approach? I'm really not sure if I'm missing something. 
 I'm just facing one problem:
 - Either I define the factories in the same module as the data structure, but then I need to live with the name shadowing warnings for values like title and words (I would hate to name them differently since they describe the same thing)
 - Or I have a separate Factory-Module but then I have to live with the orphan instance warnings. Which is also pretty nasty 
 What do you recommend?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm writing a package for interacting with emacs-w3m with ivy. I want functions like ivy-w3m-switch-buffer to inherit the settings -- especially the actions -- of their standard counterparts, so that for example ivy-w3m-switch-buffer should have the same actions available as ivy-switch-buffer does (or perhaps counsel-switch-buffer).
 This is for two reasons:
  
Don't duplicate code! The vast majority of the two functions will be the same, better to inherit if possible (and track/inherit bug fixes and improvements as they come along) than to write it twice.
 If the user has defined their own specific settings for the parent function -- like a custom action for ivy-switch-buffer, they shouldn't have to add them again to the new function. User shouldn't have to duplicate either.
  
Is there a standard way to do this? Or perhaps just a standard way of getting these settings for a given function, so that I could just interpolate them into my definition of the new one?
 TIA!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For example, C-x C-; (comment-line) works perfectly fine when using emacs insdie xterm/uxterm, but not inside any other terminal I have tried (gnome-terminal, rxvt, kitty etc). In all of the others, emacs seems to think that I'm pressing C-x ; instead.
 Do you guys understand why this happens? This tends to annoy me a bit on the rare occasion that I have to use emacs inside a terminal since many of the shortcuts I am habituated to aren't available.
 My guess is that xterm sends extra escape codes that other terminals that emacs is able to detect and support, but I would love to know if someone knows for sure. Also, do you know of other terminals that have these extra xterm capabilities (perhaps hidden under some settings)?

 import scala.collection class CustomCollection[K, V] { type UnderlyingMap[K, V] <: Map[K, V] = K match { case Long => immutable.LongMap[V] case AnyRefK <: AnyRef => immutable.AnyRefMap[AnyRefK, V] case _ => immutable.Map[K, V] } ... } val a = CustomCollection[Long, String] // UnderlyingMap is a immutable.LongMap[String] val b = CustomCollection[String, String] // UnderlyingMap is a immutable.AnyRefMap[String, String] val c = CustomCollection[Char, String] // UnderlyingMap is a immutable.Map[Char, String]

 I am planning to use scala refined types to validate JSON configuration files. I was wondering if anyone is using them, and how has been there experience. More specifically, I am concerned about if it adds lots of boiler plate as we are in a much mature stage of application. I tried value classes and new types macros but nothing seems to be as robust/ efficient as refined types for my current work. 
 Thanks

You might be able to imagine that I struggle a bit with wrapping my mind around Haskell. I'd appreciate it if someone could tell me how the following would be approached in idiomatic Haskell.
 I want to check data for a bunch of conditions, collect the met conditions in a list, and once everything is done, I want them to be output to the console one by one. In Ruby I do it like this, pound sign is comments:
 # Here'd be a bunch of variables, mostly true/false toggles for storing states relevant to multiple conditions, and a map (i.e. a key-value list) which serves as storage for input data met_conditions = [] if [some condition] met_conditions << "name of the condition" # Append string to list end # This repeats two dozen time with pretty complex if-trees met_conditions.each {|i| puts i} # Print each item individually with newline

 In another language, I might often use an enum to represent some class of objects (let's say types of fruit for sake of argument), then work with arrays of that enum type. I'm writing a depth-first search for a single-player puzzle game and I'd like to encode the types of squares on a board in this way, but I'd also like to use unboxed arrays for the performance. Is it possible (with reasonable simplicity) to add an instance of UArray for a simple sum type like data Fruit = Apple | Orange | ..., or am I stuck working with an undesirable layer of translation from a primitive type to my abstracted representation?

 Edit: After not being able to reproduce this with other packages, I looked in counsel's code and found that it does a require for dired. Replacing (use-package counsel) with (require 'dired) also worked - but why? Shouldn't my use of use-package and general already load dired and define keybindings? Why do my bindings get overwritten if I don't require dired before its use-package block?

 This is what I pride myself with, the back-end. As I'm technically a full stack dev with Angular but I'm not that much into the front-end past writing services/components.
 After discovering cryptocurrencies, in particular Cardano, and seeing what amount of brainpower goes into developing such a ecosystem I've deep-dived into Haskell.

 - I've started a list in org-mode. I pressed RET to make a newline within the current item. - I pressed M-RET to create a new item. Now I'm done with the list. What do I do to exit the list and go on writing something else? (C-o C-n would work but be damned if there isn't a single combo for this ...) 
 Couldn't find the answer in the docs.
 Edit: The described behavior of RET - creating a new indented line when list item is at point - was added recently. I'm currently experiencing it in org-mode 9.4.6 - and I was just surprised that there's no intuitive way to make a newline that's neither indented nor a new list item.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Looking for advice on some Hakyll customization.
 I have a Hakyll site that includes .lhs files. I'm trying to insert links from my pandoc-compiled lhs pages to the raw lhs. The natural way to do that is to have a context field that gives the URL to the raw version.
 To accomplish that, I thought it would be good to define a new type of field. I was aiming for something like urlField. Here's what I ended up with, which is working:
 -- | Create a field that is the URL to the given version of the current item -- or non-existent (suitable for use in @$if(...)$@) if there is no such -- version. versionedUrlField :: String -- ^ version -> String -- ^ key -> Context a versionedUrlField version key = field key $ \i -> let empty' = fail $ "Cannot find routed \"" ++ version ++ "\" version for item " ++ show (itemIdentifier i) lhsFilePathCompiler = (getUnderlying >>= (load . setVersion (Just version) :: Identifier -> Compiler (Item String)) >>= getRoute . itemIdentifier) in maybe empty' toUrl <$> lhsFilePathCompiler 
 The strange part of this is the explicit type given to load . setVersion (Just version). I'd like this code to work regardless of how the resource I'm loading was compiled, but ghci does not seem to be able to give me the appropriate type make this polymorphic, and I'm not sure what it is, either, if it's even feasible.
 Alternatively, I'm very open to "here's a much better way to accomplish the same than your versionedUrlField function" :)
 (If anyone wants to use this as is, feel free. However, if you're using a copyFileCompiler or the like for your versioned file, you will either want to change the explicit type above or replace just copyFileCompiler with copyFileCompiler >>= getResourceString, both of which feel gross.)
 Thanks!

 But this will;
 trait Wrapper2[A] { type myA = A val a: myA def fun(a: myA): String } val s = new Wrapper2[String]{ val a = "String" def fun(a: myA): String = a } val i = new Wrapper2[Int]{ val a = 1 def fun(a: myA): String = a.toString } Seq(s,i).foreach{ w => println(w.fun(w.a)) } 
 In the first case, the A-s are the same and we know that. In the second case, we just know that with extra steps. In both cases the Seq will be a Seq[Wrapper[_>:String with Int]] 
 I wanted to encapsulate the instances with its typeclasses, but this seems super boilerplaty. 
 Also, I totally understand why this won't work (but still we should know that we can call the fun with a no matter what "object" is a, the compiler guarded us at the callsite);

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Obviously in most cases it is necessary or desirable to call up embark-act before you execute an Embark command. However, there are some commands I want to use so frequently (e.g., pulling up Help documentation for a command I’m considering using under M-x) that I want to have a dedicated keybinding to execute the Embark action on the selected target without having to pull up the Embark menu first. So in my example, I would hit a keybinding that immediately brings up the Help doc for the selected M-x candidate while still keeping the minibuffer open (instead of having to first press embark-act-noquit and then h to send describe-symbol).
 Maybe this is a question specifically for u/oantolin, but I’m not entirely sure how to go about programming this after reading through the Embark wiki. Is it possible to do in a simple manner?

Several Tweagers all agreed to gather notes here about our
ICFP (International Conference on Functional
Programming) experiences. We plan to publish these notes every evening.
Day 1 - Monday
These notes follow Noon, Arnaud, and Richard through their day at ICFP,
roughly in order.
Richard — Calculating Dependently-Typed Compilers (Functional
Pearl)
Started my day at 6:30am in order to attend the Q&A for Calculating
Dependently-Typed Compilers (Functional Pearl), by Mitchell Pickard and
Graham Hutton, of the University of Nottingham. (I watched the video itself
last night.) This is a very cool paper about a technique for deriving a
proved-correct compiler by construction. The main example in the talk was
about compiling a simple expression language to a stack machine. The

 Let me know any other improvements and features missing. I think it'd be really cool to have a centralised and simple, single action.
 (Actually, it'd be awesome to put this under the official Scala umbrella like scala/setup-everything-scala and just have an org with a few members to maintain it over time, with me (@japgolly) just being a democratic maintainer.)
 Any FYI & enjoy!

 ​
 I'm trying again to read the famous scala with cats book, and I'm confused about a point in the introduction. The book talks about
 ​
  
typeclasses - in scala, traits with at least a type argument, such as JsonWriter[A]
 typeclasses instances - concrete, implicit implementations of the above for specific types, e.g. JsonWriter[String]
 Usage of typeclasses - methods that use typeclasses instances as implicit parameters
 Difference between Interface Objects (e.g. Json.toJson("my string")) and extension syntax ("my string".toJson)
  
That much is pretty clear and the examples on point.
 It also says that you don't have to define instances for every possible type, but instead those can be constructed by known instances. For example, if you have an instance for A, B and C, and you…]]></summary>

 I like using bitmap fonts, they're significantly clearer to me, but they're generally pretty small. The typing latency in emacs is already pretty poor, but with small fonts it becomes almost unbearable, comparable to working over SSH.
 Originally I thought it was syntax highlighting & other plugins, but if i open emacs in the terminal it runs great... which implies it's the font rendering???
 How is the font rendering implemented? Is it possible to write my own, and connect it to emacs running as a server? I have no idea wtf the gui is doing to make it so slow:/

 main: 7:30-10:30 TASK 1
 8:00...... ----------------
 10:00...... ----------------
 main: 10:30-12:30 TASK 2
 12:00...... ----------------
 14:00...... ----------------
 I want to hide the "8:00 ; 10:00 and 12:30" marks, since these times are filled with TASK1 and TASK2 respectively. How can i achieve this? Also i do would like to view the tasks in "time blocks" if possible. (like google calendar for example)
 Sorry, im not english native and this was pretty difficult to explain. Thanks

I think this is a brute force approach to a very solvable problem because I once found implicits intimidating but I am comfortable with them now.
 What are some ways, courses, training materials, exercises that can help boost comfort of using implicits in Scala?
 Are there alternatives to writing Scala free of implicits? how tenable is it?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm just getting started with encrypting my org files and have a use case that I can't figure out. I want to archive subheadings from time to time but I want those to remain encrypted.
 How to encrypt gpg_archive files?
 If I have foo.gpg and archive a subheading, it automatically creates foo.gpg_archive. It does not automatically added the # -*- mode:org; epa-file-encrypt-to: ("me@me.com") -*- header, so I add that. But then I close and reopen foo.gpg_archive and I do not get prompted for a passphrase, as I do with foo.gpg. What do I need to do to encrypt foo.gpg_archive?
 Alternatively, how to exclude :ARCHIVE: tags from being searched?
 I would prefer a solution to the above problem, but if that's not possible (I'm fairly certain it is) I'd be ok with a solution to excluding headings with an :ARCHIVE: tag from search (I use swiper and evil mode search so preferably both, if they aren't the same thing under the hood).

 I understand FP is quite different thought, but I am learning by mapping between concrete examples and FP concepts. Any recommended docs or books that I should read? I read a some info e.g. Applicative[2]. That seems to me a good way to model tasks. But I am not sure about other parts such as task progress, and so on. I could totally go to the wrong direction; therefore I appreciate any suggestions. Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey r/emacs!
 How do I turn off the font-lock mode at point? This is for org-mode files. Basically, I want the italics, links, strong or other decorations to text appear plain text, so they are easily editable, whenever I put cursor on them.
 Is there a good way to do it? Or, is there are better/other way to achieve editing these entities quickly and universally?
 Thanks in advance!
 Update: Thanks to u/gusbrs for pointing out https://github.com/awth13/org-appear
 This works:
  (use-package org-appear :custom (org-appear-autolinks t) (org-appear-submarkers t) :hook (org-mode . org-appear-mode))

 I know that this might be a dumb question, as the existence of such a function would be problematic in many applications, however, in my case it might prove to be very useful.
 Is there a function in Haskell such that:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[TLDR: What's the easiest way of tracking the value of an org statistics cookie through a git commit tree?
 Background
 I use org-mode and git to track my reading habits. I have a document tree with a heading for each book, and three possible todo states: TBR, Read and DNF. The document is thus structured as follows:
 * Books [X/Y] ** TBR Title 1 ** Read Title 2 ** DNF Title 3 
 The value of X is the count of how many titles below it are marked Read, while the value of Y is the count of how many values are marked either Read or TBR. DNFs don't enter into the statistics at all.
 With this document, I sometimes add new books to be read, and when I've read a book, I switch the todo status from TBR to Read. If I try the book and don't want to finish for one reason or another, I mark it DNF.
 The document is version controlled, so I can go back and see how the list has changed with time. I thought it might be fun to try and plot how the size of the list of books has changed with time, but I don't know how to automatically extract the statistics cookie for each commit.
 Any suggestions?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I did this code that allows me to download an elfeed entry as audio or video, but as I am a beginner in elisp I'd like to see some ideas and advices on how to improve it:
 ; Download entry as a 1080p video in directory defined i.e "~/vids" (defun dl-video () (interactive) (let ((default-directory "/media/offline")) (async-shell-command (format "youtube-dl --format 'best[height<=1080]' '%s'" link)))) ; Download entry as audio in directory defined i.e "~/mux" (defun dl-music () (interactive) (let ((default-directory "~/mux")) (async-shell-command (format "youtube-dl -x -f bestaudio '%s'" link)))) ; Prompt to select the format of the download (defun option () (interactive) (let* ((choices '(("Video 1080p" . dl-video) ("Music" . dl-music))) (choice (completing-read "Download as: " choices))) (call-interactively (cdr (assoc choice choices))))) ; Main function that copy the entry link and call the prompt function to download (defun elfeed-yt-dl () (interactive) (dolist (entry (elfeed-search-selected)) (when-let* ((link (elfeed-entry-link entry))) (with-temp-buffer (insert link) (clipboard-kill-ring-save (point-min) (point-max)) (option)) ))) 
 And a question too, the youtube-dl command to customize the output has this type of argument 
  -o "%(title)s.%(ext)s" 
 So if I use %s to pick the link variable as string, the code doesn't work. Any idea of how could I pick the variable without using %s

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My question is in the title. I know it's a bit vague, but I recently learned about org-attach. I'm intrigued by the possibility of being able to organize my files - my current Documents folder - with org-mode. I'd much prefer searching through org nodes to find the file I need (typically PDFs or saved HTML files, in my case).
 However, I've found the default ID generation a bit strange. I realize I can use relative directories, but it seems I would need a directory per file if I wanted only one file attached to a node. I'm just a bit hesitant to not use relative directories and continue to name my files in human-readable format since it makes me a bit more "locked-in" (in a sense) to org-attach, otherwise.
 So...I guess I'm just looking for ideas and inspiration. If you are, how are you using org-attach, exactly?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I may have an opportunity coming up to drive more FP adoption at work and I am particularly interested in showing how ZIO can help us be more productive and avoid entire classes of bugs I have seen pop up often (e.g., resource leaks and OOMs). 
 A big question I foresee being asked is what happens if there is a bug in the runtime engine. ZIO is still quite new and changing fast. Someone posted a video of a bug they found in Cats Effect 3 related to memory that I can't find right now but that is to say it's possible for there to be bugs in the runtime engine itself. It would be a legitimate question for my team to ask: what happens if there is a bug in the core of the runtime that we can't architect around? Is there a risk that we have to refactor a whole codebase in the future out of ZIO?
 Basically, how do I assure my team that it's stable enough to use in production? 
 I know this question would come up (or should) with every dependency added to the codebase, but this is a big one. If you're using a third party JSON parsing library (e.g.) and encounter a serious bug, you have more options s.a. using a different library, writing a small library that only addresses your use case (or even just the use case where the dependency has the bug), architecting around it so the bug is not on the execution path anymore, or forking the library and fixing it if you can. With a library like ZIO where the whole app runs on top of it, you may have no choice but refactor the whole thing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am using both visual-line-mode and org-indent -mode (with evil-respect-visual-line-mode).
 In an org-mode buffer when trying to move around any block of text that is indented, moving up or down lines makes the cursor jump between columns. I believe this is an issue of moving not respecting org-indent-mode but instead moving based on what the columns would look like if the buffer was unindented.
 ​
 Here is a gif demonstrating the problem.
 Here I am just moving up and down lines (no left or right commands) in an org-mode buffer with org-indent-mode on. 
 Does anyone have a solution for this? Also, should I report this as a bug or is this intended behavior?
 ​
 EDIT: 
 I found this post from 4 years ago describing a similar issue. It sounds like this was a bug then but not sure if anyone has made headway with it or reported it since. (Also if it is a bug is this a bug in org-mode or something related to visual-line-mode?)

 I need help.
  
Is there an equivalent of SPC . in Spacemacs other than C-x d? (to bring up dired preview). If not, can you bind it in the config?
 How do you reload the config? The equivalent of doom's, SPC h r r or ~/.emacs.d/bin/doom sync?
  
I may get more questions as I go along, but here are my first ones.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm looking into sequences. I start with the typically obtuse Wikipedia page on sequences here, then I try to imagine how all this might look in Haskell. I want to stay away from series for the time being, i.e., keep them separate.
 Here's one Haskell sequence (with a bit of example here), and here's another. These seem to be completely different. I'm looking at Tom Apostol's Calculus and his short bit on sequences, also SICP, and both have examples of limits of sequences, i.e., long sequences. This seems to be about streams, so I'm guessing the second Data.Containers.Sequence is more germane?
 Somewhere I found this:
 A geometric sequence (or progression) is a sequence of elements from an ordered,numeric type (i.e., a member of both classes Ord and Num) such that consecutive elements have a fixed ratio.
 geometric :: (Ord a, Num a) => a -> a -> a -> [a] geometric r m n | m > n = [] | otherwise = m : geometric r (m*r) n 
 So this isn't trying to be fancy at all, it's just using lists. But then this talks about Cauchy sequences
 data Real = Cauchy { modulus :: Nat -> Nat , sequence :: Nat -> Rational } 
 So this isn't list-land anymore, although I don't know what it is for or how to use it. If anyone has any wisdom or tips or insights, I'd appreciate. In general, I find the world of Haskell and numerical analysis very fragmented, hit-and-miss, like a scavenger hunt. It seems Haskell can bring a lot to the numerical analysis table, though.

 What would you suggest me to do. Ofcourse i want to have a good impression on my employers but learning and getting comfortable with Scala and Spark is much more important to me then this Job. I want to be confident in my skills,
 I can't make proper sense from the documentation and i don't usually find solutions to my problems easily on google.
 I am weak in Logic building and coding too.

Also, what's the difference between citations and references and where/how do they go into a paper? Do you put them in place or down at the bottom of a page as footnotes? So yeah, what's the difference between citations, references, and footnotes? And is there an automatic bibliography maker app?

I understand that I need to put the ATTR_LATEX part before my BEGIN_SRC.

By global, I mean somehow put the option at the top of the document.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Scalqa has a special void request type \/ with a singleton object implementation, which is also named \/. It is used to request a void instance of any type (where supported) in concise and readable manner. 
 For example:
 import scalqa.{*, given} // Scala val v: Vector[Long] = \/ // vs. Vector.empty val v: Seq[Float] = \/ // vs. Seq.empty val j: java.util.List[String] = \/ val f: (Int,String) => Unit = \/ // vs. (_,_) => () val l: List[String] = \/ // vs. Nil val o: Option[Int] = \/ // vs. None val s: String = \/ // vs. "" // Scalqa val c: Collection[Double] = \/ val o: Opt[String] = \/ val v: ~[Double] = \/ val b: Byte.Collection = \/ val i: Int.Opt = \/ val k: Long.>< = \/ 
 Generally, if we create a type with void implementation, then we must define implicit void request mapping.
 class Foo object Foo: private object Void extends Foo implicit inline def implicitFrom(v: \/): Foo = Void // now it works: val f: Foo = \/ 
 Due to the fact that def impliciteFrom is inlined, the \/ resolution is a zero cost call.
 Take a look at real life usage examples: code1, code2, code3, code4, code5.
 \/ is by far the most used Scalqa general request, but there are many others.

 Basically, I'm an evil user who's been writing functions for org-agenda and using general to bind them. I switched from my literate config to just a plain init.el because I found it simpler and wanted to modularize my config, and to my surprise the org-agenda bindings I'd declared using general suddenly became overridden by stuff in the evil-org package.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I decided to archive and rip all my Audio CDs to FLAC. I have all the necessary metadata in the FLAC files such as disc number, label, catalog number, etc.. but I would love to have all the information stored in an Org document as well because I believe that it is easier to navigate an Org file.
 Even though FLAC files can contain any metadata, the Vorbis specification allows that, most modern music players are unable to display tags such as catalog number so If I ever need that information I need to open each album in a separate tag viewer software which is more cumbersome than having all the information in an Org file.
 Here is an image, the way I organize the albums in Org mode: https://ibb.co/c1H6Rmd
 I was just wondering if there is a way to do a search like: display all headings that contain the name "Atlantic" in the "LABEL" tag.
 So, my question is basically if is there a way to take advantage of those drawer properties somehow in searching. It is not something very important for me but it would be cool if it's possible.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It seems that Play Framework is not actively developed anymore. There has been no release in the past months, and commits are rare (just Scala steward). It even lacks Scala 3 support. Anyone willing to provide some background why such drop in activity? I am actually very sad, since I loved play a lot (although it was a bit bloated with the final jar).
 I know akka-http is not a proper web framework, but it might work for me, since all connections to my server are done via websockets.
 However, I think these things will still be needed:
  
Sessions (jwt)
 Routing and reverse routing
 Assets and asset fingerprinting
 Handling websockets with an Actor
  
Did anyone attempt such a migration, and how did you fill these gaps? Is there a way to do migration gradually, rather than all at once?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've always wanted to navigate pdf files using the keyboard like other Emacs buffers -- so I wrote a minor mode for pdf-tools that allows this. See here.
 Since this is my first major piece of elisp code, I'd welcome any kind of suggestions on coding style, bad practices to avoid, and other improvements. 
 Also, the whole thing has a major Achilles' heel: To display the cursor it is added as a highlight into the pdf page object, which is then rendered as an image together with the rest of the page and displayed in Emacs. Each update of the cursor position hence requires a full re-rendering of the pdf page, which is quite slow at high resolutions. If anyone knows of a better way to do this, that would be fantastic!

 I've been using Orgzly on Android for some time and really like the simplicity. I didn't know about org mode before that. Although I admire the idea of a pure text based approach, I personally do need some kind of GUI, like Orgzly.

 You have a monad containing a tuple. One element is the value of the monad, the other is the environment:
 State (val, env)
 Since the value of State is the first element of the tuple, >>= should return the first element of the tuple, like so:
 m >>= f = (\State (x, _) -> f x) m
 This is not what's said in the book; it's just what i understand from what i know about monads. Maybe I'm wrong. And I'm certainly am, because >>= and return are defined in the book like so:
  
instance Monad (State s) where
  return x = State $ \s -> (x,s) 
  (State h) >>= f = State $ \s -> let (a, newState) = h s 
  (State g) = f a

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 I have an issue with my recursive function - I built it as a List function (i.e. "returns" a List) but now I need to turn it into a function that returns a Set.
 My custom data is:
 data Exp = Const Int | Comp String [Exp] deriving (Show) 
 Using this data I can do the following:
 let x = Comp "a" [Const 1, Comp "b" [], Comp "c" [Comp "d" [], Const 2]] 
 My List function looks like this:
 collection :: Exp -> [String] collection (Const n) = [] collection (Comp n args) | Data.List.null args = [n] | otherwise = union [n] (concat (fmap collection args)) 
 ​
 Running on GHCi, my output is:
 *Main> let x = Comp "a" [Const 1, Comp "b" [], Comp "c" [Comp "d" [], Const 2]] *Main> let w = collection x *Main> w ["a","b","c","d"] *Main> :t w w :: [String] 
 What I now need is something like this:
 *Main> let v = fromList w *Main> :t v v :: Set String 
 ​
 My failed attempt looks like this:
 collection :: Exp -> Set String collection (Const n) = empty collection (Comp n args) | Data.List.null args = Data.Set.singleton n | otherwise = fromList (union [n] (concat (fmap collection args))) 
 ​
 Obviously, this isn't working as I'm passing a [a] into a Set [a] function but I don't know how to work this one out.
 ​
 Thanks,
 Asian Guy

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sorry if the title doesn't convey what I'm asking properly enough, I'll expand it below.
 Lets say I have two blocks, one src and one export. The src block contains the code below, in this example. When exported as html with C-c C-e h o it becomes a code block and shows the src block literally as expected.
 #+name: test #+begin_src html <img alt="Trulli" src="https://www.w3schools.com/html/pic_trulli.jpg" width="500" height="333"> #+end_src 
 If you use the same block content as above, but put it in a export block instead, it exports the result of the code as one would expect when running C-c C-e h o, however, if you include the src block as below, it is exported literally.
 #+name: export-test #+begin_export html :noweb yes <<test>> #+end_export 
 I'm quite certain that this is due to me missing something, but I've tried looking through the docs and search for a while now, so thought I might as well ask since I'm clearly missing something.
 I'm using a setupfile, so the appearance is a bit different, but makes no difference on the result here. I've tested to make sure, but aside from appearance, there's little difference. Here's a little screenshot of the code in the buffer, it is otherwise empty.
 I want to export it like you would if you had the code in the export block as html directly, as shown earlier. As far as I've found, you can't use src blocks to export the code non-literally, and I'm messing with changing the values of some code using variables, macros and the like on export. Tangling is not relevant in this case, otherwise I'd be able to do that with a src block.
 Hopefully I've explained well enough, but please do ask if you need more information! I'd appreciate any help or insight into the situation :)

 In Haskell, a top-level function and a lambda function which do the same thing have the same type. How can this be, when the lambda might capture some aspects of its environment? I'd imagine a regular function is just a pointer, like in other languages, but that can't be all it is. Do lambdas dynamically allocate space for their captures, and store a pointer with the function objects, so that every function is really a function pointer plus a capture pointer, which would be null in the case of non-capturing functions? Am I wrong to even think of Haskell objects in terms of physical memory?

 Can I group properly with org-agenda? I am using zaen view and the groups are basically this repeated: 
  (:name "Faculdade" :tag "fac" :order 3) 
 I thought abour using org-ql, but I don't know how to have the timestamps in items and in todays view. I hate doing this kinda of posts as I prefer try to read and figure out but it is been frustrating trying to have an agenda and not accomplishing what I want x_x. If you have a light or any directions I can take please let me know. Thanks for taking the time to read my issue =)

I did a Flutter code lab called startup name generator that lazily generated an infinite list of word pairs and now my boss told me to learn built_values library for immutability. Then there was the "?", "??", "!" syntax for null safety. Also chaining method calls and methods like take seem like they ware taken from Haskell or other functional languages. I am only a novice in both Haskell and Dartlang but can some intermediate ~ experts weigh in here?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm a college student going for CS degree. We were taught the basics of programming/OOP with Java, and therefore most of our generalized CS classes had Java support.
 I've always hated scripting languages, loose typing, and manual memory allocation so it was hard to pick another language to try to learn (and C# is just close enough to understand but just different enough to drive me nuts). I love what I've learned of Scala so far, and want to make sure I don't get anything wrong.
 I've been successful in following a number of tutorials in Java and converting their code to Scala because I don't save many projects of my own. Everything runs and is great but I feel like I'm probably making some noob mistakes.
 What are some tips for a new Java-to-Scala dev student who very strongly leans towards OOP and away from functional programing?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
How are you all taking reading notes? I have been using a notebook (a bit smaller than A5 size) to take mine. Usually I jot down things in bullet points as I read with a text. But this has been causing some issues. The actual writing takes a bit, and can be enough to get me out of the flow of reading. This usually leads to frustration as I try to write as fast as I am thinking, resulting in a barely legible scrawl. Either that or I take very few notes as I try to stay engaged with the reading material So, I wonder, am I taking notes too often? Should I wait until I am done with a certain section before jotting down ideas? The mental block I have there is that I will forget what I wanted to write down by the time I get to a stopping point.
Maybe it is not the frequency of notes, but the medium. Or maybe both. I have tried using a computer, and that does help with speed somewhat. However, that works best with digital texts, and I mostly read printed ones. Another approach I have thought of is using index cards. That does make processing later a bit easier, and you can group notes freely to see relations, but it can also get messy. What are your thoughts on using a computer for notes? Index cards?
My goal is to have a system where I can read fluidly while writing down things I would like to process later. How are you accomplishing this?]]></summary>

When I run org-noter I get this message "not enabling jit-lock: it does not work in indirect buffer" in the minibuffer when the new frame opens. Additionally, none of the org-noter keybindings work, which I'm guessing is related.
 A quick google search returns this stackoverflow post suggesting org-goto wasn't working because of multiple org installations. I'm not sure how to assess my own org installations in case it's the same problem. 
 I'm using doom and enabling org through the init.el file. As far as I'm aware this is the only org installation I have. 
 Does anyone have any ideas? Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Context: I am looking to leverage literate programming in org-mode to create crash courses on tools for my company's KB and also create playbooks/runbooks as org files that can be executed as needed.
 My current issue is I want to define a yaml file in an org file src block and then use that yaml file later.
 What I'd like to do is something to the effect of...
 #+NAME: docker-compose.yml #+BEGIN_SRC yaml ... #+END_SRC #+BEGIN_SRC sh docker-compose up -d #+END_SRC 
 In order for this to work org/babel would need to save the `docker-compose.yml` block as the `NAME` and then execute the shell src block. Ideally I wouldn't want this to clog up my directory, so I'd want to avoid keeping that `docker-compose.yml` file around after we're finished.

 Just trying to link up my backend with a really simple web frontend here, I need to be able to respond to individual key presses in a html input element inside a monad that has State and Effect (or Affect). 
 I found purescript-hareactive in a previous thread, but I don't know if this is still maintained. Not a huge deal or anything, but I'm wondering if there's a better way to do this now?
 If not, it looks like maybe something with coroutines will do the trick. I saw a forum post by Jordan Martinez on the topic, but people there suggested to use a dedicated frp library. 
 Any thoughts appreciated!

I've been trying to structure my procrastination. I call it positive directional procrastination. These are some of the results.
@thomasteepe has got me thinking about tools for idea creation. Even though this one is specifically a digital one, I still want to credit Thomas. Maybe he'd rather I not mention him, but oh well. Also, @bradfordfournier's idea of a label for zettel that lives on the edge of more than one graph is intriguing. You have to find them before you can label them. This is hard to do when you have 2237 zettel.
At a point in the thread Multi-edges / Named Links / Sub-graph: a means of capturing fluid associations I got excited about the idea of discovering what connections intersect at the edges of thought maps.

I see that org has a countdown timer feature, but can I get it to play a sound when the timer expires?
 If so, I'll also want to start both timers at once. Obviously that's a trivial function to write, but does that already exist in the code?
 (I've been using org for years, but in a pretty basic way; just getting in to the more sophisticated features!)

 All I can find is getting the total of a column or row range, but I can't figure out how to base the range on field values, like a date.
 Sounds simple enough, but I'm completely new to this, so I could use some help.

Sönke Ahrens recommends putting Literature Notes (summaries of texts read) in a reference manager like Zotero. What are the advantages of doing this as opposed to putting it in the main Zettelkasten software? Disadvantages seem to be that links, backlinks, and searching are not possible in Zotero notes. I cannot see any clear advantages, but maybe I am missing something?]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm curious, do those of you who are mindful with your notes and links make sure to only link to "previous" notes (those with a lower ID) when creating a link.
Clearly when first creating a note this is the only option, a new note is, well...new, and thus all other notes to which you might choose to link are older and thus you are pointing to previous work.
Suppose at time 1 you link 123 -> 121
Fast forward into your future: what happens if you are editing 121 , and find the urge to reference something in 123, do you let yourself do this? You will now have two links (bidirectional) 123 <-> 121.
Does this contradict the ZK principle? If you don't let this happen, I can imagine there being a lot of link maintenance that must go on to prevent yourself from accidentally creating a link which is already a back-link into a regular link?
Thoughts appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Based on this question I asked here I've started using org-roam more often recently, and I use LaTeX a lot in my workflow.
 What I want to do is this:
  
Create a table in an org file with some LaTeX math symbols, using the org-mode table handler, e.g.
 #+ATTR_LATEX: :environment longtable |-----|-----| | A | B | |-----|-----| | $x$ |$\mu$| |-----|-----| 
 
Export just the table to a .png or .pdf file in the directory
 
Insert the .png or .pdf image into the org-file to use as a preview.
 
 At the moment I can do this via C-c C-e C-l L and get a LaTeX buffer that I can paste into a new source block but I was thinking of something along the lines of a python source block to create a matplotlib plot as a .png. 
 Is there something I can do with the export tags, or with #+BEGIN_SCR latex?
 Or is there a way I can directly convert
 #+ATTR_LATEX: :environment longtable |-----|-----| | A | B | |-----|-----| | $x$ |$\mu$| |-----|-----| 
 to LaTeX source, which is output into #+RESULTS, without having to use C-c C-e?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I use A7 paper slips for my reading notes, and I know that others Zettlers use a similar approach too. But, I haven't seen much discussion about tracking related reading notes around here.
Either way, I thought of an idea that might possibly make life a little easier for us lovers of standardized reading notes. Here it goes.
We can take inspiration in Luhmann's numbering system to manage standardized reading notes, such as A7 paper slips:
The first note gets the address "1."
If you need to postfix a new character, alternate between numbers and letters from the alphabet.
If you want to add content to a note, grab a new note, take the address of the first note, and postfix a new character in the new note.
If you want to create a note about something else, increase the first character of the …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is a little insight that came to that I think might be helpful for some. Please let me know what you think.
If you have a Zettelkasten, you need to constantly create Zettels so it grows to give you richer connections. A day in a Zettler usually looks like this:
Create Zettels and make connections.
Read sources.
Proofread Zettels.
However, you need to manage the overall process so working with a Zettelkasten doesn't become all you do everyday. E.g.: In the worst case scenario, you'd spend the entire morning, afternoon, and evening creating Zettels, reading, and proofreading respectively. That gives you no time for anything else!
The part of the process to manage is reading time because everything else depends on it. E.g.: If you don't read, you can't create Zettels, and without Zettels, there's nothing to proofread.
I think that we can manage reading time in the same way that we adapt the routine of short knowledge cycles:
Start with 1 hour of reading.
Read, create Zettels, and proofread. Keep track of the time spent on each activity.
Reflect on the overall process.
Based on your reflection, change the time alloted for reading.
Repeat steps 2 through 4 until you reach a point where you are satisfied with the work you do for your Zettelkasten, and don't lose time for other things in your day.]]></summary>

 First of all, there is a toList located in Data.List.NonEmpty and another located in Data.List.Types with the same type signature and I'm not sure which one I need. In general, I run into this sometimes; what do you do in these situations? Do you look at the source code and sort of figure out what you need?
 Second, I have tried with both and I get the same error for both - "Could not match type NonEmpty List with type NonEmptyList". What does this mean and what do I need to do?
 Basically, my expectation would be that I can create foo = NonEmpty 1 (2:3:4:Nil), then run toList foo and I guess I am supposed to get (1:2:3:4:Nil)? (I'm not really sure about the output which is why I'm trying to test it)

 I am trying to run purescript on doom emacs, I uncommented purescript from the init.el so purescript mode is working I get syntax highlight.
 ​
 I have the purescript compiler installed inside the node_modules and also spago. spago builds fine. 
 I am trying to get psc-ide-emacs to work with doom emacs but failing. when I use psc-ide-server-start it says it can find the executable no matter if I go to the folder itself where purs.bin is located. 
 I am using Linux.
 This is my config.el file ```lisp
 (use-package! psc-ide)
 (add-hook 'purescript-mode-hook (lambda () (psc-ide-mode) (company-mode) (flycheck-mode) (turn-on-purescript-indentation)))
 (setq! psc-ide-purs-executable "./node_modules/purescript/purs.bin") ```
 This is my packages.el file
 list (package! psc-ide) 
 Any idea? I am new to purescript and emacs so this is getting out of hand fast

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi there, 
 I'm currently learning e/macs and have discovered org-mode and have workflow question. Currently I do all my task, project management and timelog planning through Toggl and Evernote. I use Evernote as a filing cabinet, storing important documents like contracts, tax documents etc, for quick retrieval. However I would like to get away from Evernote, due to its lack of privacy and encryption features. 
 Ideally, I would like to have everything in org-mode, that is: 
  
Notes (I'm quite ok with plain text notes)
 Files (like a plain text note such as tax agreement, which then links to the actual document)
 Time tracking for tasks and calendar apointments
 Maybe an Agile Results (a productivity system) workflow
 How can I get my tasks in org-mode etc. on my phone on iOS?
  
Is this possible to achieve in org-mode and if so, could you suggest a possible workflow? I have also looked at Joplin as a possible candidate, but it's time tracking and todo features are insufficient for me. 
 Thanks, in advance 
 Best regards, 
 ​
 David

And I don't have any colleagues or developers around to discuss the idioms or Haskell/PureScript way to code. I'm solving the AoC puzzles to learn and try to get used to it. I think the AoC 2020 d4 puzzle is the one of the best puzzles to practice how to parse and process the data after parsing. Here is my code. Can I have a code review for the idioms or a better way to use this language?

A Brief Intro to Monad Transformers by Solomon Bothwell

A brief intro to MTL by Jappie Klooster
That blogpost inspired me to write this, because I can’t find a succinct description on how to use MTL. I learned MTL by staring at reflex for days, if not weeks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On my quest to start a Zettelkasten, I found that most Zettelkasten tools (listed here and on reddit) have no support for hierarchies. With that I mean, methods for promoting/demoting notes in a hierarchy or folding a lower level to reduce distraction.
In Luhmann's paper, this aspect seemed really important to him. And I can see how adding lower-level notes helps to keep notes simple and atomic. (Example: notes on cities are listed under notes for countries.)
As I am just starting with the Zettelkasten, I am worried that a non-hiearchical note list will become very confusing quickly. So, how are more experienced people handling this? Did you find software that does handle hierarchies well? Or, do you use summary notes and then link the individual parts?
Would be great to have your insight!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Got annoyed by copy and pasting dates and times from web articles, then having to clean the copied stuff up (some websites make it hard to select the date without activating a link, so you end up with the author name or whatever, too).
Here's a simple one-liner to clean things up, requiring any Ruby installed:
ruby -e 'require "date"; print Date.parse(ARGF.read).iso8601

It's simpler than my previous attempts with a Python script that parses date and time, e.g. from a Zettel ID.
This reads from standard input, looks for a date inside, then prints the 2021-08-11 form of the date.
Here's how you can test it by piping static text to the command:
echo "Nassim Taleb Jun 14, 2020 · 5 min read" | ruby -e 'require "date"; print Date.parse(ARGF.read).iso8601'

You can use Keyboard Maestro, too, for this:]]></summary>

I'm afraid I have to disagree. There is a difference, a sliding scale, a spectrum in ZK work focused on literature, just as there is a spectrum of other types of "X-driven ZK work." Moving my skills "up" the scales is a goal, and it is always possible to move on the scale. I have to be vigilant that I don't backslide. Thinking and writing about the processes used in ZK work help clarify meaning. Some processes are counterproductive to our goals and there is a good chance we are blind to this - from @Will comment here


How would you rank the different tasks in terms of their utility to your zettelkasten? Here is my current ranking from top (highest utility) to bottom
Creating Combinations of Ideas
Creating Variations of Ideas
Creating Nonobvious Connections (e.g. conceptual connections)
Reformulating Ideas from Literature
Adding Notes to a Structure Note
Creating Connections based on Keywords (Obvious Connections)
Copying and Pasting Ideas from Literature
Unsure: 
* Creating Metacognitive Knowledge not for yourself, but for the zettelkasten
* Clarifying Notes
* Organizing Old Notes]]></summary>

I'm learning about functional dependency and working around overlapping instance problems. I don't get how purescript decides which of the two instances of Decapitate to run the decapitate function for the call within genericTail.
 Say you run genericTail "hello"; collection binds to type String. I get that. But nowhere within genericTail am I specifying whether element is type Char or CodePoint.
 So then how does purescript know which definition of decapitate to run? Thank you.

The error I'm getting

 the error is a little cryptic for me at the moment, not sure how to fix. Suggestions please? Thanks

The editor now recognized Markdown better. Less unhandled edge cases. Less styling surprises.
But since applying theme styles is different, there are the occasional visual quirks, like the bracket colors in link definitions being color of links instead of being the color of link definitions.
