        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm currently working on taking more effective notes using the Zettelkasten method and have encountered a challenge when dealing with claims attributed to secondary sources.
For example, academic articles typically contain numerous references to outside sources. Many of the claims discussed are not original but rather derived from these secondary sources.
My struggle is with how to properly document these secondary claims in my notes when I'm unfamiliar with the sources being referenced. I feel uncomfortable directly citing them. However, these claims are often relevant and interesting, and I want to include them in my Zettelkasten for future reference.
Here are some questions I have:
How do you approach taking notes on claims that are attributed to secondary sources when using the Zettelkasten method?
Do you cite the original source, the secondary source, or both in your notes?
How do you ensure accuracy and avoid misinterpretation when you're not directly familiar with the primary source?
Any strategies for efficiently exploring the primary sources when they seem particularly crucial to your understanding of the topic?
I’d appreciate any advice or strategies that have worked for you when navigating this aspect of academic note-taking. Thanks in advance!]]></summary>

 If this is simply not plausible in nano then I'm also up for alternative splash screen that can do this.

After a bit of trying out different configs I got it working with the OAuth 2.0 setup of my employer. 
 Now I'm trying to actually use it, but I find it somewhat unexpected; perhaps that's because I have used org-gcal for a while and was expecting something similar, i.e. synchronizing of the calendar entries into an org file which can be linked to my org-agenda (and calfw).
 For example, a very frequent occurrence is to schedule meetings with other people (in person). This generally works by everybody looking at their calendar to find a spot in e.g. the next week where all of us are available. Is this possible with Excorporate? To me it seems it's only possible to check the calendar entries for a given day (via M-x calendar, moving to the date, pressing d or e), but not get a list of all the events, or all the events in a week/month. 
 Furthermore, creating events seems to be possible via the API (https://github.com/emacsmirror/excorporate/blob/master/excorporate.info, chapter 6 API Usage), but this functionality is not exposed as an interactive function. Does that mean I have to write my own helper functions here? Has anybody done so already?
 Does anybody have experiences with excorporate for these use cases?

I like this workflow but, since I'm a subpar programmer, I often end up with giant and disorganized scripts which are difficult to navigate. I eventually delete the cruft and refactor but I still end up spending a lot of time in this disorganized state. To improve navigation through the spaghetti, I thought maybe a table of contents could be made from the code-cell headers (i.e. "# %% Imports"). Does something like this already exist? Is there some other quick solution involving, e.g., code folding, bookmarks, imenu, etc.? 
 If there's no easy solution I thought this might be a good excuse to start playing with elisp and try implementing it myself. Any suggestions with respect to how to begin would be much appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I'm reading <Get Programming with Haskell> book on Manning MEAP website and have difficulties in understanding its chapter 21, titled "Hello World! - introducing IO types". In my opinion, it seems to give wrong information. Below is an example:
 "If main isn't a function, it should follow that neither is putStrLn. ... As you can see, the return type of putStrLn is IO(). Like main, putStrLn is an IO action because it violates our rule that function must return values."
 The author seemed to think "IO ()" isn't a value, which I don't agree with. So I googled and found the following on Haskell wiki https://wiki.haskell.org/Introduction_to_Haskell_IO/Actions:
 "PutStrLn takes an argument, but it is not an action. It is a function that takes one argument (a string) and returns an action of type IO (). So putStrLn is not an action, but putStrLn "hello" is."
 So I think the author is completely wrong on that, isn't it? On the other hand, however, I read lots of good reviews on the book on Amazon website. Am I misunderstanding something? Thanks for any confirmation or explanation.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Howdy. 
 I'm trying to write a util function to clean up org-agenda items. Specifically, if an agenda item has a SCHEDULED and DEADLINE with matching date+time I would like to remove the SCHEDULED property. Here's what I've come up with but though the messages indicate my logic is fine the changes are not being reflected in org-agenda view nor in the file where an item lives. Perhaps there's some save function I'm not calling to persist the changes?
 (defun local/org-remove-schedule-if-deadline-matches () "Remove SCHEDULED from agenda item if DEADLINE exists and matches." (interactive) (org-map-entries (lambda () (let ((scheduled (org-entry-get nil "SCHEDULED")) (deadline (org-entry-get nil "DEADLINE"))) (when (and deadline scheduled) (let ((scheduled-day (org-time-string-to-absolute scheduled)) (deadline-day (org-time-string-to-absolute deadline))) (when (= scheduled-day deadline-day) (message "removing SCHEDULED from task: \"%s\" in file %s" (org-get-heading t t t t) buffer-file-name) (org-entry-delete nil "SCHEDULED") (save-buffer)))))) nil 'agenda))

 https://gitlab.com/perikov/scala-bundles
 I tried this before ( https://github.com/p-pavel/osgi-scala ) wrapping every jar into a bundle, but I finally gave up.
 Everything is badly broken (split packages is the main problem).
 So I just taken a route on bundling releases ("everything related to org.typelevel/cats/n").
 I also have Karaf features with dependencies. 
 For it lets me to just type `feature:install myApp` and have relevant libraries from cats ecosystem (and also elastic4s and others) just install transparently from maven. 
 and `feature:uninstall` just unloads everything.
 I'm not sure if I have to put all this on maven (maven central requires packaging sources with jars, and my jars are just bundles containing relevant libs).
 Is there any interest on this topic?

Purely dropbox like which means it can sync files even if I open the files or not.
 Pull/merge when I open the file.

 My question is what "flavor" of emacs should i use that best fits my needs?
 All i ask is rich text, image viewing support, linking to other notes/files, hierarchical notes and optionally a GUI.
 I don't mind steep learning curves nor the specific type of rich text.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In Scala 2.13, and play-json, I used the following pattern to serialize/de-serialize between case classes and Json:
 import play.api.libs.json.{Format, Json} object WelcomeResult { implicit val format = Json.format[WelcomeResult] } case class WelcomeResult(service: String) 
 defining implicit formatin the companion object of the case class, made it easily visible from outside, so the following code worked without even requiring an extra import:
 val welcome = WelcomeResult("test") val json = Json.toJson(welcome) 
 In Scala 3 I saw the type class derivation feature and though I could take advantage of it by a. making the code more compact. b. defining such a default formatting only once in a generic way in the type class.
 This is the implementation I have in mind:
 case class WelcomeResult(service: String) derives JsonFormat
 And then something like this in JsonFormat:
 import play.api.libs.json.{Format, Json} trait JsonFormat[T] { val format: Format[T] } object JsonFormat { def derived[T](using scala.deriving.Mirror.Of[T]): JsonFormat[T] = { new JsonFormat[T]: override val format: Format[T] = Json.format[T] } } 
 But Json.format[T] fails with some "Instance not found: 'Conversion[T, _ <: Product]'" error. I guess, from other examples that I need a macro to implement the desired behavior, but not sure how.
 Any help appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm untrained in music, but every bit of music theory I learn really increases my enjoyment of it. I wanted to learn to compose a bit, and the traditional method is counterpoint. So I did what any barely musically literate nerd would do: I started to write a program to verify that a counterpoint composition follows the rules when played against a given melody. Frankly it was an uphill battle. But finally, this weekend, I got it working.
 https://github.com/ludflu/counterpointer-report
 The main thing that stymied my earlier efforts was that I didn't understand the nature of musical intervals in a formal way. Every explanation I learned described it as a mathematically naive music student might require, which makes sense if I were trying to play the oboe or whatnot. Or, things would be explained in DSP terms, explaining how overtones work, etc. And that also makes sense, but....
 But what I really needed, was for someone to tell me that musical intervals are calculated using integers mod 12. Which actually makes a ton of sense when you think about how human's perceive relative pitch. Did you know that humans are the only animals we know of that perceive relative pitch? I'm pretty sure I learned that from David Huron's excellent book.
 Eventually I thought to ask someone over in /r/musictheory and things mostly worked out from there since I could use the Haskell modular-arithmetic library for the intervals, and Euterpea for representing notes and playing them via MIDI.
 Finally I had to hack around some broken stuff because Euterpea, though its a marvelous library, is not actively maintained and so needed some work to get it to run with modern Cabal. AND PortMIDI-haskell doesn't agree with Clang on OSX. But I was able to patch all those things locally to get everything running, and I submitted PRs to try and fix them up for everyone else.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello fellow Emacs enthusiasts!
 I've noticed an interesting behavior difference between fill-paragraph in text-mode and org-fill-paragraph in org-mode, particularly when working with selected regions.
 Here's what I've observed:
  
In text-mode, fill-paragraph respects the selected region and only operates within it.
 In org-mode, org-fill-paragraph doesn't seem to respect the selected region and operates on the entire paragraph.
  
I've created a GIF to illustrate this difference:
 https://i.redd.it/7trbpcthrqgd1.gif
 I initially thought this was a bug and submitted a report, but it was determined not to be one.
 I'd like to open this up for community discussion to get your thoughts and insights.
 In org-mode, the behavior remains the same whether a region is selected or not. When no region is selected, I believe this behavior is appropriate.
 However, the issue arises when a user explicitly selects a region, expecting the fill operation to be limited to that selection.
 I think org-fill-paragraph should respect the selected region, similar to how fill-paragraph works in text-mode.
 What do you think about this behavior?
  
Update: Now that I've reviewed the org-fill-paragraph function documentation again, I understand the current behavior.
  
The REGION argument is non-nil if called interactively; in that
 case, if Transient Mark mode is enabled and the mark is active,
 fill each of the elements in the active region, instead of just
 filling the current element."
  
Unlike text-mode's fill-paragraph, org-fill-paragraph is designed to "fill each of the elements in the active region."
 The current behavior seems to be explained by this information.
 Thank you for your opinions!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fellow PKM enthusiasts,
I find myself caught in what seems to be a cyclical dilemma in the world of personal knowledge management, and I'm curious if others are experiencing the same.
My journey began with enthusiasm for local-first environments like Obsidian and Logseq. The promise of data ownership and flexibility was alluring. However, as time passed, I found myself gravitating back to cloud-based solutions.
Now, I'm feeling the pull towards local files and Markdown again. It's as if I'm caught in a perpetual swing between the convenience of the cloud and the freedom of local storage.
This pattern has me wondering:
Is this back-and-forth between local-first and cloud-based systems common in the PKM community?
For those who've made multiple switches, what ultimately made you settle on one approach (if you have)?
Are there solutions that effectively bridge this gap, offering the best of both worlds?
How do others manage the trade-offs between sync convenience and data sovereignty?
I'm starting to think this isn't just a fleeting concern, but a fundamental tension in how we approach PKM. The desire for true ownership of our data and the freedom to use multiple tools seems to persist, even after trying various solutions.
Has anyone else found themselves in this PKM pendulum? How have you reconciled these competing needs in your own systems?]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone, sorry I couldn't find a proper title for what I was looking for. what I want is a way for consult completion candidates to show a certain string when I'm selecting from the minibuffer but when the candidate is selected it should be the original form string.
 for example:
 ;; I have this list of paths that I want to select from (defvar paths '("/dir1/dir2/p1" "dir1/dir2/p2" "/dir1/dir2/p3")) ;; I want to parse those paths to only show the filename ;; in the minibuffer (consult--read (--map (file-name-nondirectory it) paths)) ;; the completion is supposed to be p1, p2, p3 ;; but when when I select I want the original path to be selected ;; for example /dir1/dir2/p1 
 I would do it using a hashmap or alist to map between the candidates and the selection.
 is there an easier way around this without using annotate function or marginalia ??

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This question is mostly to those of you, who love or enjoy Scala (or not, but still visit this sub) but don't get to use it at work, or use it only for Spark.
 Imagine that you're given a task of creating a mission critical component of your company's product. It would have to be a project deployed to the cloud, scalable, reliable, performant (but not extremely performant - jvm performance is fine). It will have to be maintained for years to come - by you, your team and your successors.
 Whatever you choose, you will have to recruit a team or train your coworkers - let's assume that they are mostly java users, good old spring booters, but they are not against the idea of learning a new language and paradigm.
 Would you choose Scala for such a project if given a choice? Do you feel confident that you'd be able to sell this idea to your manager? Do you believe that with Scala it would be cheaper to maintain or more profitable than with other languages? When would it become profitable - the recruitment / trainings would be more expensive surely, so would benefits of Scala become visible after weeks, months, years of maintaining the product, or never at all?

 I get that everyone has their own opinions about coding, but flinging insults like that? That’s just not right.
 Can we please cut the negative rhetoric and start being more welcoming to EVERYONE, regardless of their skill level or coding style?
 The /r/scala subreddit should be a safe space for every Scala user. Labeling other people's code as "trash" is not okay.
 That comment also fails to meet this community's rules of "decency" and "politeness." I'm very surprised that it received 20 upvotes.
 And can we please make full use of all the tools that reddit puts at our disposal? And let’s not turn a blind eye to this kind of behavior, we need to call it out. We can definitely do better. Thanks.

 I am writing this so it doesn't just exist on my laptop and is documented somewhere. Maybe this is common knowledge, I did not find it anywhere.
 Basically, update from my end on the direction Monoidal -> Traversing is that there's a way to write
 monoidalToTraversing :: (Choice p, Monoidal p, Traversable f) => p a b -> p (f a) (f b) 
 we use a variation of Alexis King's construction
 data Traversal a r b = Done b | Yield a !(Traversal a r (r -> b)) deriving Functor instance Applicative (Traversal a r) where pure = Done Done f <*> a = f <$> a Yield a rToTf <*> ta = Yield a ((\ f b x -> f x b) <$> rToTf <*> ta) traversal :: Traversable t => t a -> Traversal a b (t b) traversal = traverse (\ a -> Yield a (Done id)) unTraversal :: (a -> b) -> Traversal a b tb -> tb unTraversal _ (Done tb) = tb unTraversal morph (Yield a fab) = unTraversal morph (fmap ($ morph a) fab) traversalP :: (Choice p, Monoidal p) => p a b -> p (Traversal a b x) (Traversal b b x) traversalP = dimap toEither fromEither . right' . (both <$> id <*> traversalP) where toEither :: Traversal a r b -> Either b (a, Traversal a r (r -> b)) toEither (Done x ) = Left x toEither (Yield a resume) = Right (a, resume) fromEither :: Either b (a, Traversal a r (r -> b)) -> Traversal a r b fromEither (Left x ) = Done x fromEither (Right (a, resume)) = Yield a resume monoidalToTraversing :: (Choice p, Monoidal p, Traversable f) => p a b -> p (f a) (f b) monoidalToTraversing = dimap traversal (unTraversal id) . traversalP 
 (I call both :: p a b -> p c d -> p (a,c) (b,d) to Monoidal's idiomatic class function) the other direction (Traversing -> Monoidal) needs some other kind of ideas which I am not having so far.
 Remaining questions:
  
What about the other direction?
 How to do this for Traversing1? It shouldn't use Choice, because Either a is not a Traversable1
 What are the implications?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Two dummy examples, both Scala 2.12. 
 First example - sequence of Foo[t <: T], and I want some function to use that t somehow. Pseudocode-ish:
 ``` type A <: T type B <: T
 trait Foo[t <: T]
 object Foo1 extends Foo[A]
 objet Foo2 extends Foo[B]
 def someFunc[t <: T](foo: Foo[t]): Unit = { somethingThatKnowsHowToTakeTypes[t].foobar }
 Seq( Foo1, Foo2 ).map(someFunc) ```
 This leads to type erasure concerns, even though to me it seems obvious that that Sequence is of a type where each object inside is a Foo of some concrete type that fits the constraints. I can get around it by introducing some wrapper case class that I can stick Foo1 and Foo2 into, which retains it's type as an explicit member. And then inside someFunc I have to manually use that type member explicitly. Feels clunky and it feels like something I'm tricking the compiler into doing. Not to mention at some point I did get it to compile, only to fail at runtime if I didn't create the correct implicit typetag in scope.
 Second example:
 Sequence of (Foo[t <: T], Bar[t <: T]), and Bar/Foo have methods that operate on or return t <: T. I store in a 2-tuple because inside a lambda I want to do something like Foo.read(...).map(Bar.transform) where Foo.read returns something typed by t and Bar.transform takes something subtyped by t. I assume since I pair them up in a 2-tuple, the Seq of these such objects could recognize that it's some paired object, but instead the compiler complains about expected vs supplied types.

 How can I enable copy/yank from some text from my Mac browser into emacs buffer on the terminal and also vice versa. 
 I tried clipetty and it works when I yank something from emacs buffer and paste on Mac but not the other way around. Also it does not work at all when using tmux. 
 Appreciate any suggestions!!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I need to find the nth prime number. This is what I have so far:
 module Prime (nth) where nth :: Int -> Maybe Integer nth n | n < 1 = Nothing | otherwise = Just ([x | x <- [2..n], isPrime x] !! (n-1)) isPrime :: Int -> Bool isPrime 2 = True isPrime n | n < 2 = False |otherwise = all (map (\x -> n `mod` x /= 0)) [2..root] where root = (floor . sqrt . fromIntegral) n 
 Some of the errors I get are (seems that both functions are wrong):
 Couldn't match expected type ‘Integer’ with actual type ‘Int’ • In the expression: x In the first argument of ‘(!!)’, namely ‘[x | x <- [2 .. n], isPrime x]’ In the first argument of ‘Just’, namely ‘([x | x <- [2 .. n], isPrime x] !! (n - 1))’Couldn't match expected type Couldn't match type ‘[Bool]’ with ‘Bool’ Expected: [Int] -> Bool Actual: [Int] -> [Bool] • In the first argument of ‘all’, namely ‘(map (\ x -> n `mod` x /= 0))’Couldn't match type ‘[Bool]’ with ‘Bool’ Expected: [Int] -> Bool Actual: [Int] -> [Bool] • In the first argument of ‘all’, namely ‘(map (\ x -> n `mod` x /= 0))’ 
 The second error is not really clear for me, I thought that all returns Bool (a -> Bool) -> [a] -> Bool), why would it be [Bool]? Also, any hint for the first function? Thank you.
 EDIT:
 Correct solution:
 module Prime (nth) where nth :: Int -> Maybe Integer nth n | n < 1 = Nothing | otherwise = Just (toInteger ([x | x <- [2..], isPrime x] !! (n-1))) isPrime :: Int -> Bool isPrime n = null [x | x <- [2..n-1], n `mod` x == 0]

 Both ways, the python:getting command in ubuntu are highlighted with org-document-title face, so I think (I could be wrong) that org-mode parses both way alright(or is it font-lock and parser behave differently?). but the space will make that huge difference to org-roam-find-node
 Why?

 I have not a clue how the function definition would even look like. It would only save few lines, but it got me fascinated if there is some deeper scala magic I'm not aware of yet.

 In my case GHCi only shows "ghci>" as prompt. Has this changed recently or am I doing something wrong here?

I am attempting to use org-ql-defpred with org-ql-query, and because I do not quite have a handle on what I am doing yet (I am far from an elisp expert, but don't mind stretching my boundaries), I am trying to stick pretty close to the Org QL Custom Predicates Tutorial for now.
 Something that works exactly as I want, but lacks the flexibility of the predicate-based approach, is the following (with org-super-agenda):
  (setq org-agenda-custom-commands '(("A" . "Agendas") ("Aj" "John" ((org-ql-block '(tags "#John") ((org-ql-block-header "John")))))

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My main gripe are
  
I'm not always logged into reddit, and when I click a reddit link, it produces some fake security error, and tells me I'm not logged in or I should use my developer token. I'm not sure why reddit has started to do this, but does it have something to do a desire to monetize it it more, and may even have something to do with AI. It seems reddit has also signed some exclusive deal with Google allowing only Google to index it.
 
The way Reddit know handles blocking by other users. Sometime ago I began to notice that so many responses had some error like deleted and unavailable. Something I remarked on in this thread - Why do some reddit users especially on r/emacs keep messing up threads their involved by deleting their posts or making them unavailable? I don't see why some people should disrupt a technical discussion by blocking some participants who can't see what is going. It is not as though this Twitter or Facebook, this is simply a technical forum and the discussions don't often veer into the political. What kind of mindset does it take to block someone because you don't want them to read your views on technical issues, and it is not as though the person blocked cannot login using another account to see the thread?
 
 These two issues are making this forum less appealing. Perhaps I should use stackexchange more instead.

I run my own little branding & design agency, and when I decided to start writing blog posts I found myself falling down rabbit holes of psychology, Jung, archetypes, consciousness, and on. I realized that I needed a better way to hold on to and integrate all the new ideas I was finding — which led me to a new rabbit hole of Zettelkasten and trying to understand the philosophies and processes behind it.
Many of my web searches would lead me to thoughtful discussions on this forum, so I thought I'd tag along and try to absorb your collective knowledge!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For years (I use AoC as way to get familiar with new languages I add to my trophy collection), I've been used to that naive solutions for AoC2015/4 (iterate over numbers, conver to string, concatenate with prefix, hash, convert to hex, check n zero prefix, repeat) take 'too long'.
 The first optimization was to figure out how to pre-hash the prefix (in some languages/libs, copying the state is not as straightforward as calling a method).
 Second was not converting a number to string, but incrementing a byte array (or mutable string) representation of the number.
 The last is to re-use a buffer for the resulting hash, ideally not converted to hex, and to directly check the first few bytes (and perhaps 4 bits) to be zero.
 Usually, all this got me a speed-up of at least 10x.
 What totally shocked me was that the naive implementation finished in less then five seconds (I expected roughly a minute), and that further optimizations got it down only to under three seconds.

 I'm trying to compile a cabal project using the ghc-wasm-meta 9.8 compiler, but I'm getting the following error:

 my cabal.project and each name.cabal have the following ghc-options:
 program options/library ghc-options: -no-hs-main -optl-mexec-model=reactor "-optl-Wl" 
 something I noticed is that if I run build using --verbose , the call to wasm32-wasi-ghc doesn't have any of the ghc-options I've set. Maybe it's got something to do with the `Setup.hs`? but that file just has the usual:

 Anybody got an idea of what might be happening?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone,
 recently I've had some trouble with Doom Emacs crashing unexpectedly and I've been trying to troubleshoot today with research and chatgpt.
 I found on r/DoomEmacs a similar thread where an Arch user was experiencing the same thing while editing C++ files while mine was mostly happening when editing Rust files. I don't have much to go on but my assumption was that when the rust-analyzer was working or Rust LSP was communicating it was causing it to panic and crash but this was just an assumption and I was having trouble getting much out of --debug-init. This user was able to downgrade to version 29.3 and it solved their problems.
 Recently I've completely uninstalled rust, emacs and doom emacs and found wayland-emacs on the aur which I didn't notice last time. I've reinstalled Rust and now I'm going to attempt to install this AUR package and go from there. Another issue I was having was opening Fish shell in Doom Emacs with Term which wasn't an issue before until installing Rust.
 It's also important to note that I've had this Arch + Hyprland install for about 2 weeks and Doom Emacs hasn't given any issues what so ever until installing rust and rust-analyzer but also I upgraded around the same time and I know there was an upgrade 2 days ago. Thanks for reading, I wanted to try and be thorough so I apologize for the length of this.
 P.S The user on Arch I was talking about with a similar issue was using X11
 EDIT: solved, I use the pacaman package manager to uninstall emacs-wayland and installed emacs instead. So far rust hasn't crashed when editing or coding rs files in doom and rust-analayzer is working. Must install with rustup component add rust-analyzer though, not your package manager. and using vterm this time with no issues.. yet ;)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm new to Scala. I'm writing some performance-sensitive code for processing objects on several axes. My actual code is more complicated and handles more axes, but it's structured like this:
 class Processor: xData: Data yData: Data zData: Data def process(axis: Axis) = axis match case X => doStuff(xData) case Y => doStuff(yData) case Z => doStuff(zData) 
 But it is a bit repetitive, and it's easy to make a typo and use the wrong data object. Ideally, I'd like to write something like this
 class Processor: data: HashMap[Axis, Data] def process(axis: Axis) = doStuff(data(axis)) 
 Unfortunately, this code has different performance and correctness characteristics:
  
It's possible for me to forget to initialize Data for some of the axes. In a language like TypeScript I could type the field as Record<Axis, Data>, which would check at compile time that keys for all axes are initialized. But I'm not sure if it's possible in Scala.
 Accessing the map requires some hashing and dispatching. However fast they may be, my code runs millions of times per second, so I want to avoid this and really get the same performance as accessing the field directly.
  
Is it possible to do something like this in Scala?
 Thanks!

In general, this works great; the exception is org. 
 Any kind of :ensure form doesn't work with installing the latest revision of org (afaik), because the pre-installed version shadows it; use-package uses package-installed-p to decide if a package isn't installed and needs to be downloaded, and since org is always installed, no download will ever trigger. This is fine, up until you want something from a later version of org.

 The first one, and most commn I think, is the **finish-to-finish dependency** which is the one I believe is covered by org-mode; this is also the easiest to enforce (again imho) programatically with orgmode tools. Task A cannot be marked as `DONE` before task B and C are.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I've been diving into the world of algebraic effects systems as an alternative to mtl-style classes for granular effect tracking. One thing I haven't quite figured out yet is how to handle errors in the middle of a computation that uses a custom effect type. For example, let's say I have an effect for talking to the database:
  data DB :: Effect where DBWrite :: Item -> DB m () DBRead :: Key -> DB m (Maybe Item) 
 and types for errors and the database environment
 ``` data DBError = DeadLockError | ConnectionError
 data DBEnv = DBEnv Connection ```
 and let's say I have the interpreter:
  runDBIO :: (IOE :> es, Error DBError :> es) => DBEnv -> Eff (DB : es) a -> Eff es a runDBIO env = interpret \_ -> \case ... do handling here ... 
 Now the recommended way to instrument all of this is to wire up all of your effect handlers at the start of your program:
  main = do env <- getDbEnv result <- runEff . runError @DBError . runDBIO env $ program case result of Left -> ... do something ... Right -> ... do something ... 
 This all makes sense. But what if I want to handle the error at a deeper level in the program and not at the very top level? The Error DBError effect doesn't manifest in the type list until the runDBIO interpreter is applied. For example,
  tryWriteDBOrSendEmailPage :: Item -> Eff [Email, DB] () tryWriteDBOrSendEmailPage item = do catchError (dbWrite item) $ \_ e -> emailPage $ "Something went wrong: " ++ (show e) return () 
 This doesn't work here because the type signature doesn't contain Error DBError, but the underlying implementation of DB uses it. If I add Error DBError to the effect list, wouldn't that be a totally separate effect from DB, so it wouldn't be able to throw and catch in the same context? Should I manually expose effects for TryDBWrite and TryDBRead that return an Either? Not exactly sure what to do here.

Maintain a list of companies and the contacts in each of them

 Keep email communications for each opportunity attached to the lead and the company / contact

 My code is something like this

 I am clueless why is it so? I tried searching everything.

I find it more convenient than the HTML versions.
 This is done by running make pdf.
 However, these PDFs don't have hyperlinks or clickable TOC.
 Only the major manuals released here, like the GNU Emacs Manual, the GNU Emacs Lisp Reference Manual and An Introduction to Programming in Emacs Lisp seem to offer that functionality.
 Any idea how to get it done for all the other manuals?
 EDIT:
 Problem solved. I overlooked that the hyperlinks work fine. They're just not highlighted.

 I have a somewhat weird scenario. I have been invited for a code review interview round with a company that works primarily on scala and a bit on Java. I am a Java resource and have never worked on scala before but they have told me that they are okay to hire people with Java knowledge as they have a pretty decent upskilling plan. However the code review is on a scala code. My question is as a senior Java dev how can I deal with this. I was thinking I will brush up on a few core concepts of functional programming and monads. Anything else you guys suggest. The recruiter said that they ofcourse know that I have never worked on scala so I will be judged accordingly but I am sure there will still be some stuff that I can do.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[SOLVED: eshell-highlight-prompt being set to nil caused the behavior. Setting to true fixes the issue, which makes me wonder why the setting is used in the repository at all.
 I am excited to start using Eshell after reading about it on Mastering Emacs. Since I wasn't happy with default prompt, I installed the eshell-prompt-extras package like the article recommended. However, if I continue pressing backspace, my prompt and previous shell output can be deleted, which is not the correct behavior.
 I understand eshell-prompt-regexp has to match the prompt and I think it does because C-a takes me to the correct place after the prompt. Since Eshell doesn't use comint-mode, I don't know of a function to make the prompt read-only. Is there any way to achieve the desired behavior?
 My Eshell prompt customization settings are copied and pasted from https://github.com/zwild/eshell-prompt-extras:
 (with-eval-after-load "esh-opt" (autoload 'epe-theme-lambda "eshell-prompt-extras") (setq eshell-highlight-prompt nil eshell-prompt-function 'epe-theme-lambda))

I'm not actually sure how the popularity metric is derived, but I think it's based on users who indicated that they had "done extensive development work in over the past year". Scala is at 2.6% of all respondents, slightly down from 2.77% last year. Among respondents who are professional developers it's 2.9%, down from 3.21% last year. Among those still learning to code it's 1.7%, way up from 0.77% last year.
 If I had to put some flavor on these numbers I'd say Scala is still at the top of the long tail of languages. It comes in about 20th among programming languages (ie. I ignored SQL, HTML, bash, etc.) so certainly still relevant. Movement from last year is negligible except for new developers, which is very cool.

Before I read a new book, I'm interested in how it relates to the books I've read so far. To get an initial overview, I simply create a new Reference Note for the book in my Zettelkasten. It consists of a brief description of the book and a few references to existing notes.
When I quickly look through the bibliography, I find these references. They are links to books that I have already read or to books that are on my reading list. These are simply added to link the Reference Note. The graphical overview is generated automatically by the Zettelkasten tool.

The resulting literature map helps to provide an initial overview. By adding a few details, the map becomes somewhat easier to read as a concept map.

The concept map will be refined further. Quotations and ideas from the existing 'Reference Notes' make the 'Bibliographic Map' easier to read. It now offers a good overview that facilitates the overall understanding of this bibliographic network.

 https://hackage.haskell.org/package/htmx
 This is roughly based on `lucid-htmx`, but is different enough that I think it can be considered stand alone and not a fork. Notable differences:
  
Not using the old `data` based tags
 New type-safe interfaces for various htmx enumerations
 Module structure tries to follow some htmx concepts (like core and extra attributes)
 Significant documentation
 Additional attributes that didn't exist in `lucid-htmx`
  
I am going to try and stay active on the issue tracker, and keep this package up to date with new GHC indexes. Hope this is useful to some of you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In my notes collection I use org-publish to create a nice personal website out of org-roam files. I have an index file that programmatically lists posts in categories, with tags, or in alphabetical indices. I do this via macros that expand into dynamic blocks and run all dynamic blocks during export via a source block near the bottom of the page.
 It's slow. Real slow. I do all the post link lookups using org-roam, so I assume that's just sqlite db queries. Then I use very minimal org syntax to turn it into links.
 I realised recently that I could probably do the same thing via exported source code block results, since I only need all this stuff during export.
 Is there a noticeable performance difference between org-babel exporting the results of some Lisp code, and that same Lisp code being used via dynamic blocks?

How does scala fare in that department?
 Thanks in advance for your response.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Given a frame with various windows in it, I want to be able to write text into them without them being associated with a file, and I don't want to spam buffers into the buffer list. I was thinking that having a single "log buffer" into which the messages would be written would prevent buffer spamming, and then I could just show the operator a different particular message in each window. Playing around with different things, trying to use indirect buffers with some sort of region narrowing seemed to be a good possible option.
 I didn't have much luck with this though:
  (let ((org-dates (list "2020-04-05" "2023-08-02" "2021-09-08" "2019-08-04"))) (delete-other-windows) (split-window-right) (split-window-right) (split-window-right) (balance-windows) (dolist (earlier-journal-entry org-dates) (pop-to-buffer (make-indirect-buffer (get-buffer-create "*Org Roam Daily Reflection Log*") (generate-new-buffer-name "*indirect*"))) (let* ((start (point)) (org-msg (concat "\n\n* No daily journal entry for " earlier-journal-entry "."))) (insert org-msg) ;; (org-mode) (narrow-to-region start (point))))) 
 In particular, the narrowing doesn't seem to work right. How should I be doing narrowing?
 (If this is at all the right sort of approach to this task.)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Me again! after removing some libraries, my project now depends on:
  
containers
 mtl
 transformers
 singletons
 singletons-base
 parsec
  
Nevertheless, since I'm using ghc-wasm-meta, I cannot really include the singletons-base package (since it depends on th-orphans and the WASM backend doesn't support TH yet).
 I might be able to patch things up, if I can just expand the TH definitions in the singletons-base package, but I don't really know how to do this without just forking the repo, running cabal build with -ddump-splices -ddump-to-file flags, and manually deleting the _XXXX identifiers.
 Is there a better way to do this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have tried doing
 (setq-default indent-tabs-mode t)
 (setq-default tab-width 4)
 (defvaralias 'c-basic-offset 'tab-width)
 (setq ruby-indent-tabs-mode t)
 (defvaralias 'ruby-indent-level 'tab-width)
 (defvaralias 'sgml-basic-offset 'tab-width)
 But it doesn't work. This leads to tabs just being composed of 4 spaces, not one tab. Similar to the neovim editor, I want tabs to be just tabs. One large block, instead of being packed with several tiny spaces. I need this for indentation. Relying on tabs to be just full of spaces is impossible for me. Can anyone help. I have tried several solutions, but they all are just solutions which means tabs will be filled with 'x' no of spaces. not tabs with TABS. I am new to Emacs, and I have heard this whole tab business is not very straightforward. So please do explain if I got something wrong
 EDIT - I got the solution from this kind soul on stackoverflow https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6471803/making-emacs-tabs-behave-exactly-like-vims
 (eval-after-load "cc-mode" '(define-key c-mode-map (kbd "TAB") 'self-insert-command)) (global-set-key (kbd "DEL") 'backward-delete-char) (setq c-backspace-function 'backward-delete-char) 
 This treats tabs as one large tab. You can have the same control as neovim. It also deletes the entire tabs via the single backspace. I am not sure if this is gonna work with javascript. But I hope this post will help others
 This is all I have put in my init.el file related to tabs
 (setq-default indent-tabs-mode t) (setq-default tab-width 4) (defvaralias 'c-basic-offset 'tab-width) (setq ruby-indent-tabs-mode t) (defvaralias 'ruby-indent-level 'tab-width) (defvaralias 'sgml-basic-offset 'tab-width) (eval-after-load "cc-mode" '(define-key c-mode-map (kbd "TAB") 'self-insert-command)) (global-set-key (kbd "DEL") 'backward-delete-char) (setq c-backspace-function 'backward-delete-char)

 I'm connecting to a remote machine via SSH and Tramp, and I can edit files normally. But when I try to stage a file, emacs just hangs until I press Ctrl+G. If I stage through the command line and try to commit, *Messages* displays "condition-case: Wrong number of arguments: transient--emergency-exit, 1" and nothing happens in Magit.
 How do I start debugging this one?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Greetings,
 I am trying to make use of the "wuss" secure websockets library, at https://hackage.haskell.org/package/wuss. This adds TLS to the underlying websockets library.
 I can build and install the library fine with GHC 9.8.2, and the sample client at https://github.com/tfausak/wuss also builds fine. However, when I go to run it, it fails as follows:
 dyld[44192]: missing symbol called
 In this case, 44192 is just the PID. I tried using otool to see if there is a missing dynamic library, but I believe this shows that there is no missing library as such. Most likely, the "missing symbol" means that the library that is used, doesn't have something that is called. However, the error doesn't specify the issue there.

 haskell data Recur t a = Val a -- ^ A stored value | Hop t -- ^ A jump-to-binding statement | Seq [Recur t a] -- ^ A sequence of 'Recur' statements | Opt [Recur t a] -- ^ A choice of 'Recur' statements | Bnd t (Recur t a) (Recur t a) -- ^ An introduce-binding statement deriving Eq makeBaseFunctor ''Recur 
 Then I can define recursive sequences like this:
 ```haskell type R = Recur Text Int
 x12, x34 :: R x12 = Seq [Val 1, Val 2] x34 = Seq [Val 3, Val 4]
 n1, n2, n3 :: R n1 = Opt [x12, x34] n2 = Seq [n1, n1] n3 = Bnd "x" n1 (Seq [Hop "x", H…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've seen some pretty and complex large code bases written in C++ for image manipulation and color space conversions and to the untrained eye they look like having a set of unrelated bunch of source code with same functionality spread between different files, but usually it makes sense due to the chosen of a complex architecture fitting to critical processing and low level access. It can take months to understand what its being done and the process usually feels like trying to take some random file reading it, trying to look its dependencies back and forth until you finally make some sense out of those. Could this process be eased if every file was accompanied by some org file? And could a master org file tell "Hey this is how you should begin reading the source code"

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm looking for project ideas for a final assignment in a college course using a functional language. We primarily used Haskell, but we're open to other functional languages if the project is interesting.
 The project should take around two weeks for two advanced software engineering students, so it should have some complexity (but not too much). Preferably it should use a monadic strategy to solve a problem.
 I've already built a compiler in a previous course, so I'd prefer not to go that route again. I was considering creating a SAT solver, but one of our teachers mentioned it involves a lot of state management, so I'm unsure if it's the best fit.
 Any suggestions or advice would be greatly appreciated!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have quite a few projects and meeting and i keep track of them by using columnview dynamic block to show them in the project (each meeting has a property which points to the project and :match searches for the property). Columview has an option to add Links (so i just need to click on it and see what has been discussed). But this link feature doesnt work if the item are in a different file. 
 So when capturing a meeting with org-capture i just created another property like:
 :LINK: [[file:~/org/meetings.org::*%\1][%\1]]
 which is essentially a link to itself, where %\1 is the Meeting Title and the org headline and add this Property to the columnview. That way i can click on it form a project and see what the meeting was about.
 Now the Problem: the headline might not be unique (e.g. weekly repeating meeting) and there for i thought it might be a better idea to use a custom_id for example. So i tried to use a capture template like this:
 * %^{Meeting}
 :PROPERTIES:
 :PROJECT:
 :ATTENDEE:
 :LINK: [[file:~/org/meetings.org::*%\1][%\1]
 :CUSTOM_ID: %<%Y%m%d%H%M%S>-%(string-replace " " "-" "%\\1")
 :LINK2: [[id:%<%Y%m%d%H%M%S>-%(replace-regexp-in-string "\s" "-" "%\\1")][%\1]]
 :ID: %(org-id-new)
 :END:
 I try to replace the whitespace in the headline as this would be no valid ID. But that doesnt work it gets evaluated but the whitespaces are not replaced. i could reuse :ID: aswell but dont know how in a capture template. Ideas??

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been working on a project, and I've recently hit a devops-ish kind of issue: after getting ghc-wasm through nix flakes, I'm trying to compile the project by: wasm32-wasi-cabal build WASM --flags="wasm", but I get errors building happy and th-orphans.
 happy error:
  Configuring executable 'happy' for happy-1.20.1.1... Preprocessing executable 'happy' for happy-1.20.1.1...

 th-orphans error:

 <no location info>: error: Couldn't find a target code interpreter. Try with -fexternal-interpreter ```
 Regarding the happy error, although there is no unlit executable in that folder, there is one called wasm32-wasi-unlit, so I believe some sort of symlink can solve this, but I have no idea on how to include this in the flakes.nix file.
 Regarding the th-orphans error, I'm totally clueless.
 P.D: don't mind too much about stack in the flakes, it's there because I wanted to make sure that the other executable compiles normally.

 I have a very long list, with many subnested lists (think of it as a tree), and as of now it's currently 6000 ish elements.
 before you say why such a big list it's stuff I want to buy, it's a way to autocontrol..
 whenever I C-c C-c on anything, that be a checkbox or a counting box (the [/], idk the proper name), it takes a lot, like a good two minutes at least.
 i tried to profiling, and it seems taht org-element--list-struct in memory section is the biggest one, with match-data in cpu, but the latter it's only a 6%. I can post the full profiling if it can help, but from my (poor) understanding of the profiling reoprt, these two are what takes longer. is there a way i can improve the performance? or do I have to split it down into smaller lists? i have such giant single list because I like to have at the top two boxes that one is the percentage and the other one is the counting one. if there is a way to divide the list into the various categories, maybe with *s, while keeping an overall "completion" on the top, that would solve the issue.
 tl;dr i have a giant list. can i improve the performance? I just chronometered it, and it clocked it at around five minutes. or, if I break it down to more smaller lists, is there a way I can keep track of the overall progress?

 Release notes:
  
The change in major version from 2.x to 3.1 marks the dropping of support for versions of GHC before 8.4, deprecated in Stack 2.15.1.
  
Changes since v2.15.7:
 Behavior changes:
  
Stack uses the version of the Cabal package that comes with the specified version of GHC. Stack no longer supports such Cabal versions before 2.2, which came with versions of GHC before 8.4. Consequently, the init command will not try LTS Haskell before 12.0.
 The init command initialises stack.yaml with a snapshot key rather than a resolver key.
 After installing GHC or another tool, Stack deletes the archive file which provided the tool.

 I am struggling to find the relevant documentation to get emacs to work with debugpy remotely.
 I have an app locally in docker, debug server running inside the docker, exposing port for connection.
 It seems I need to set up an lsp-docker.yml file but I cannot find a single reference specific to debugpy (which is a relatively common debugger - it's a ms product designed for vscode - I would change it to pdb but team project and not possible)
 Anyone has experience working with this?

 Elfeed with date column
 However, when I run my elfeed search screen in Spacemacs, I don't see the date listed.
 Elfeed without date column
 Is there a specific configuration variable that I need to change? I looked through the elfeed docs, but I did not find any references to this.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I have a pretty good working setup for completions, but there is one annoyance that I haven't figured out how to change. I'm writing both python and rust, and my issue is that when I select a completion for a function name or class, it always puts opening and closing parenthesis after it, automatically. Meaning, I type:
 my_obj.beginning_of_metho
 and it (corfu) gives me the option:
 beginning_of_method
 I select it, and what it inserts is:
 my_obj.beginning_of_method(argname1, argname2)
 Which is right 80% of the time, and infuriating that 20% of the time that I needed to pass that bare function somewhere. Its more annoying with class names, it puts parens in when I'm just trying to make a type hint. 
 I've seen this behavior with rust-analyzer, jedi-language-server and pyright, so I don't think its server specific, and I've seen it with lsp-mode and eglot so I don't think its specific to those modes. I'm using corfu, but I haven't figured out a switch in corfu to change this behavior.
 The ideal behavior in my opinion would be when I select the method name, it inserts just that:
 my_obj.beginning_of_method
 And then if I type an open paren
 my_obj.beginning_of_method(
 At that point it would insert the args with the closing paren.
 my_obj.beginning_of_method(argname1, argname2)
 Has anyone else figured out how to do this? I can't be the only person annoyed by this behavior.

I have some complex objects in my code, by complex I mean that they describe “actions” and they have an impact, may have preconditions, and may have incompatibilities. All these elements are maps from the same set of keys to to integer values. And these values may be 0, 1… or max-1, max (where max is maximum value) They are now described in my Scala code, but would like to give some SME, non programmers, the ability to modify them. I must say that the I find the Scala code reasonably easy to read, but probably will be error prone. From a usability perspective do you have any experience on what would work better? - Teach some Scala (case classes mostly) - Build a DSL - Provide a GUI

 ```
 transient--exit-and-debug(error (file-missing "Setting current directory" "No such file or directory"
 ```
 When I try same with `git worktree add -f ../new-work-tree main` is it able to create directory and checkout just fine.
 Am I missing anything here? 
 Also side-note: I see these "file missing" errors also when using other modes. Wondering if there any variables I can set to make it default behavior everywhere. 
 Thanks in advance :)

 However, there was no need to use the State monad. Just mconcating endomorphisms s -> s is the appropriate way to solve the problem https://stackoverflow.com/a/3411461.
 Can someone suggest a toy programming puzzle where you actually need to use the computation result a in the State monad s -> (s, a)

 How would you debug cases like this? 
 Typically, in java, I just add a breakpoint or at least add logs. I'm not sure how to do this in scala.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am relatively new to using `elfeed`. I used it years ago, then I forgot about it for a while, and recently came back.
 So I was wondering about the current best way to filter the posts by tags, so that I can focus on specific groups of posts instead of the entire stream. I was looking at Mike Zemansky's approach to filter the posts using a hydra and a macro. It looks pretty good, and I was working towards that. However, I realized that this approach was 7 years old. 
 Hence, I was wondering if there are any better or improved ways to filter posts today, that were not referenced in Mike Zemansky's post? I believe in his code, emacs looks for all unique tags in the total feed, defines shortcut or hydra keys, and finally creates a hydra that the user can use to search for those posts. So it seems simple and nice. 
 But as I said, I was not sure if there was a package to do this now, or do I have to write that code myself in my `.spacemacs` file. Any suggestions are welcome.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I frequently use magit refs buffer to switch between branches. However, for a large repository that I am currently using, switching between branches or refreshing the magit refs buffer takes a minute or more on a modern macbook, and emacs gets hung up for a long time. The output after magit-toggle-verbose-refresh shows the largest time consuming operation
 magit-insert-tags 50.73 
 I tried to disable it with
 (remove-hook 'magit-status-sections-hook 'magit-insert-tags) 
 in init.el however I get a completely blank magit refs buffer after that, and plus I don't want to disable it for all repositories. I also tried including
 ((magit-status-mode . ((eval . (magit-disable-section-inserter 'magit-insert-tags))))) ((magit-refs-mode . ((eval . (magit-disable-section-inserter 'magit-insert-tags))))) 
 in the .dir-locals.el file but that didn't have any effect.
 I am wondering how I could disable magit-insert-tags while also displaying the branches. I am inclined towards repository specific rather than an init.el solution.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to move away from using bespoke query building logic in a Haskell service at work. My impression from surveying some of the popular options (Beam, Persistent, Opaleye...) is that while they have tools to pull schemas and synchronize with your database, they still require you to manually declare types corresponding to tables. 
 This Haskell service is however one of many accessing the database and the schema changes somewhat frequently, so manually keeping types in sync isn't ideal. In the parts of our codebase that are written in TypeScript we use libraries like prisma and prisma-kysely to generate type definitions and the experience has been pretty good. 
 Is there anything like this in the Haskell space? My hope is that I wouldn't need to manually edit type definitions if someone else at the company adds a table or changes a column somewhere in the DB.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Basically, I've stayed at my job for 6 years. In my country there were at some point max 3 - 4 companies using Scala, even not full time, and now it is even rarer. When I got my first interview for a international remote job I had about 1.5 years of Scala experience, but 4 years total experience. I went pretty far but didn't get it because lack of experience. After that, I've had up to a dozen of these kinds of interviews, for a remote international team, but I never managed to get a job. Now finally I have found a new job but it is not a great project and not what I want.
 I am not the most enthusiastic person when it comes always being up to date and reading blogs and stuff and also for the past years, I have not been a person who got assigned to the more complex stuff in my company. Otherwise I have a pretty good basis for algorithms and coding challenges (although I failed the last one which was live coding using lots of Scala generics).
 Now, it seems to me that when recruiting for a remote team, especially for a senior position, the stands for a Scala developer are pretty high and the projects are not simple (relatively, like more distributed stuff).
 Does anyone have more insights how this compares to other languages. A lot of people that I know which I wold think were at my level as a developer or even sub, got remote jobs or jobs away from my country, and I am feeling stuck. I keep wondering if it would have been easier to find this kind of remote job if i stayed with C# or moved to Java, and not due to lack of opportunities in the Scala world....

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm pretty new to Haskell, enjoying developing a web app using Scotty, but I'm struggling to figure out how I can launch (background) async IO operations.
 For example, let's say I have a handle function:
 ```haskell longBackgroundIOStuff :: IO () ...
 handleSomething :: ActionM () handleSomething conn = do my_param :: String <- pathParam "my_param" -- I want to start this running liftIO $ longBackgroundIOStuff -- and then immediately respond to the client a redirect redirect "/" ```
 But then it has to wait for the longBackgroundIOStuff before redirect. If I put the redirect before the IO operation the IO operation never runs. I've also tried craziness like.
 ``` import Control.Concurrent.Async (concurrently_)
 handleSomething :: ActionM () handleSomething conn = do liftIO $ concurrently_ (liftIO $ longBackgroundIOStuff) (return (redirect "/")) ```
 But then the redirect never gets back to the client.
 I don't need to return anything related to the longBackgroundIOStuff, I just want it to start running in the background and keep running until it's done. 
 Using express with node I could just do something like this:
 js app.get('/', (req, res) => { longAsyncIOFunction(); res.redirect('/') }); 
 What would be the best way to accomplish this with Scotty? Thanks so much and sorry if this isn't the best forum for these kinds of questions.

 I was wondering if it is possible to achieve the following:
 ``` class C t where type D t transform :: t -> D t -> [D t]
 funGeneric :: (C t) => t -> D t -> [D t] funGeneric t initial = _ {-# NOINLINE funGeneric #-}
 funSpecialized :: (C t, Int ~ D t) => t -> Int -> [Int] funSpecialized t initial = _
 instance C () where type D () = Int transform _ i = _
 {-# RULES "specialize\Int" forall x y. funGeneric x y = funSpecialized x y #-} ```
 and then, for instance:
  someFun :: Int -> IO () someFun initial = print $ funGeneric () initial 
 where I'd expect funGeneric to be re-written to funSpecialized The rule itself type-checks, but no matter what I try, it never fires due to:
  
==================== Rule check ==================== 
 Rule check results: 
 Expression: funGeneric
 ($ctransform `cast` <Co:3> :: (() -> D () -> [D ()]) ~R# C ()) () (initial `cast` <Co:3> :: Int ~R# D ()) 
 Rule "specialize\Int": arguments [4] do not match (1-indexing)

 In Scala 2.13 we were using the TypeCase from Shapeless library to overcome type erasure in pattern matching. demonstration:
 private val `Seq[AlertEntity]` = TypeCase[Seq[AlertEntity]] def onGetAlerts(arg: Any): Unit = arg match { case `Seq[AlertEntity]`(alerts) => () } 
 It was pretty convenient.
 Now upgrading to Scala 3 and checking if there a new canonical way to do it or if I should best stay with the current implementation.
 Saw TypeTest but wasn't sure how to use it even for this simple example.

Announcing ghciwatch 1.0 by Rebecca Turner
At Mercury, we’ve developed a file-watching recompiler for Haskell projects called ghciwatch, which loads a GHCi session (a Haskell REPL) and instructs it to reload or add modules when files in your project change. Ghciwatch is very similar in design to Neil Mitchell’s excellent ghcid, but with a few new tricks up its sleeve.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm using emacs to write Common Lisp code, and paredit doesn't respect the syntax of read macros. So, for example, when I write #P or #C or any other dispatch read macro(like my lovely home-brew λ)and open parenthesis or double quotes, it will insert a space before inserting the pair, and I have to double back to erase it. It's a really minor inconvenience, but I'm wondering if there's already a good solution to this problem or if anyone would be interested in improvement to paredit to correct this.
 You can just disable the behavior by adding to your .emacs, or whenever after paredit is loaded, 
 (defun paredit-space-for-delimiter-p (endp delimiter) nil) 
 But obviously this is a bit of a hack, and though I might try this out for now because I haven't ever noticed the space-adding behavior to be useful, I might find I'll miss it when it's gone, and want a more syntax aware paredit. 
 I noticed there's also a paredit-space-for-delimiter-predicates variable which you could use(or just use to disable the behavior in a less hacky way), but I would need to somehow query slime/swank to to robustly find out what the active read macros are(and I don't know how to do that at the moment), as well as actually parse them(which is messy but doable).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi folks,
 This is a package (early WIP, but usable for now) that enables formatting code in buffers via text properties.
 Long story short, it allows you to use any formatting function/command (like format-all-buffer or apheleia-format-buffer) to visually format the code in the buffer without actually modifying it. This is acheived by changing the text properties of the code with the spaces taken from the formatted code.
 This can be useful when working in a team and the codebase is poorly formatted, or when you don't like the coding style and you want to view the code in the style you like.
 This can be seen as an ~equivalent~ to Resharper's Virtual Formatter, which I just heard about when I started working on this package, but never used it actually.
 The current implementation requires treesit, so you will need Emacs 29+ with Tree Sitter support.

 So I'm considering just removing the habit style and just setting them up as recurring scheduled TODOs but I want to confirm there aren't other beneficial features to keeping it as a habit that I might not be aware of.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I’m currently having issues running emacs on mobaxterm. I tried by downloading and installing the necessary eMacs packages from mobaxterm package list and then in the terminal when I’m trying to invoke eMacs or even emacs —version it say that I should use install emacs and is opening the moba text editor instead. And when I’m trying to install emacs (with the apt-get..command)…it says the package already exits. How can I rectify this issue ? Any help is highly appreciated

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I run many Elisp scripts on my org-node zettelkasten, which is 2000+ Org files. So I've had plenty of situations where I hit this old nugget:
  File mode specification error: (file-error Cannot open load file Too many open files debug) 
 Now I'm wondering why. I take care to kill the buffer on each iteration, but it doesn't seem to matter. But! If I let a function process only 500 files, then finish, then run it again for the next 500 and so on, it works out. Is the call stack holding on to all file descriptors opened by children?
 Anyway, a problem I cannot solve: I have no insight into the org-publish codebase, and recently I found that the count of files I want to publish has exceeded 1024. So now I cannot publish. Has anyone worked around that? My publish code.
 Root of the issue 
 On Linux you might think the issue is ulimit -n which defaults to 1024 (on Debian at least), but it turns out that even if you increase that then Emacs will just die. The base problem sounds like a compiled-in FD_SETSIZE value of 1024.
 Last year it seems someone tried to patch it: https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2022-05/msg00115.html but this person says it just made Emacs unresponsive.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have just had this idea and I think it'd be pretty useful. Knowing emacs, there's a good change that either it's already a package or a snippet exists online. 
 The idea is this. After entering a command, say M-x compile <long compiler query>, I decide that I want it to be easily repeatable. So I then invoke a hypothetical M-x bind-last-command-to and it prompts for a key, say I now press <f5>. Now that compile command is bound to <f5>.
 I guess this is kind of like macros, but you bind it after the fact. And it is for a single command (even if it only worked for the last M-x compile it'd still be useful).
 Anyone know if it exists before I start trying to implement it myself? Thanks.

 src/foo.c 226:void foo(struct bar *bar) src/foo.h 1:void foo(struct bar *bar); 
 Are there any elisp magicians who know how to make it automatically prefer the C file in this case and jump to it directly without opening a buffer with the choices, and maybe also display a message "both .c and .h files found; using the .c" or similar?
 Or anyone could point me to the docs for this kind of thing, I'm a bit lost.
 Thanks!

 If I start typing, it gives me autocomplete options for all functions from any package it knows about -- awesome.
 But if I do
 import qualified Data.ByteString as B B.p 
 The B.p will give completion options for all functions starting with the letter p from any package, rather than only showing functions from Data.ByteString.
 Is this how it's supposed to work? Are there any workarounds/customizations that will make it useable? There's no point in autocomplete if I have to type out the whole function name to eliminate irrelevant functions.

 I’ve managed to setup lsp-mode with Omnisharp and enabled decompilation, so I am able to use “go to definition” on .NET system types and external class libraries that are referred to in my project as nuget packages. 
 However if I have a class A in an external nuget package, and let’s say it refers to another type in another nuget package or a .NET system type, then I can’t go to definition from within class A to these types. 
 Rider allows me to do this, but Omnisharp can’t and this is one of the most useful features I use in Rider when debugging or trying to understand the code, and is the one thing that prevents me from going full Emacs for my C# development. 
 Is this a limitation in Omnisharp or can somebody share how to set this up, so I can decompile also referenced code from within a referenced nuget package?

It's easy to use, automatic history and off device. But how do you deal with Personal Information in your Notes? Some of it might not be particularly interesting, but when you start using Due Dates and make Tasks on where to go, or whome you interact with, this could be different. Maybe you take a reminder to pick up some medication specific to a Illness you have.
 This might be even more of a problem if you use Org notes at work. Certainly most companies wouldn't want you to commit customer data to github/lab.
 So, how do you deal with this? So far the obvious thing is to keep Notes that are work related in their own folder and either not sync that or keep it on our own hosted gitlab instance.
 With personal notes this is a tougher call. I want them on two PCs and my phone. My experience with Syncthing over three devices in the past has been less than stelar. Any other recommendations that work reliably so i can finally leave google keep and todoist behind? (And yes, i know it's a bit ironic to care about personal information in org files in a git repo, when it's currently all on google and todoist servers. But i want to improve things ;) )

A while ago I was reading the following post:
https://forum.zettelkasten.de/discussion/1574/just-started-already-lost-in-clutter-how-do-you-prevent-to-get-lost-in-so-many-notes-and-links/p1
From the feedback it is clear that you should split your note taking into different steps, by using some sort of workflow.
I'm not arguing against this, but I would like to know how this community spreads this over time. Like for example do you have daily or weekly reviews or something entirely different?
The reason I ask is because most of the time at work, like most of you :-), my day is pretty full and I'm trying to figure out how to organize my day and/or week to incorporate this workflow.
Thank you]]></summary>

I am retouching my section on the Zettelkasten (within my Zettelkasten), and I am having a hard time finding the source for the following claim, which is that Luhmann stopped using his Zettelkasten in his late years and instead focused on churning out manuscripts as fast as he could, perhaps given that he knew his life was coming to an end due to his illnesses. I cannot for the life of me find the source to this claim (which conveys my inability to properly execute the ZK method, as the claim, without its source, is noted down in one of my notes). But, anyway, I would really appreciate it if someone familiar with this could point me to a direction. I am also starting to believe that I made this up in my mind and convinced myself that I heard or read it somewhere, haha, even though I find it more probable that I heard about this in a podcast.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Disclaimer: noob. I use org-mode and evil-mode extensively for notes and generally want text to wrapped at say 80 lines (easier readability, better use of screen-real estate when you're using a tiling window manager or a terminal multiplexer). For those who do something similar, looking for some advice:
  
For wrapping text, can someone share a binding to toggle using text width of 80 and/off? Also useful to visually select text and set that to wrap at text width of 80 if you don't want the all text wrapped in the file. For the latter, I often visually select the text and use a binding for fill-region-as-paragraph but this joins paragraphs separated by a line. 
 
This:
  
This is some notes blah blah blah
 
  
looks better than this
 - This is some notes blah blah blah 
 , right? I find myself needing to manually adjust for the former--how to have it be done automatically?
  
Do you have wrap at column 80 for everything? I feel like if you have text at several indents deep, those lines are too short because they still get wrapped at column 80. I'm wondering if perhaps wrapping at 80 characters starting from first non-space character to the last character on the line might be better, but I'm not sure of any editors that allow for this behavior by default and in this case it would be better to stick with consistent behavior vs. some custom solution that might not cover all edge cases.
  
Much appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I'm upgrading a project from Scala 2.13 to Scala 3.
 In the project we have many enums implemented using traits and case objects such as:
 sealed trait ClientRole object ClientRole extends EnumExtender[ClientRole] { case object User extends ClientRole case object Device extends ClientRole } 
 in the base class, EnumExtender, the values method is implemented using TypeTag in the following way:
 abstract class EnumExtender[ENUM_BASE: TypeTag : ClassTag] { ... private val typesMap = allTypes final def values: List[ENUM_BASE] = typesMap.values.toList private def allTypes = { val tpe = ru.typeOf[ENUM_BASE] val clazz = tpe.typeSymbol.asClass val mirror = runtimeMirror(classTag[ENUM_BASE].runtimeClass.getClassLoader) if (!clazz.isSealed || (!clazz.isTrait && !clazz.isAbstract)) { throw new NoSuchElementException(...) } getSubclasses(clazz).filter(_.isModuleClass).map(t => { val module = mirror.staticModule(t.fullName) val i = mirror.reflectModule(module).instance.asInstanceOf[ENUM_BASE] i.toString -> i }).toMap } private def getSubclasses(symbol: Symbol): Seq[Symbol] = { def children = symbol.asClass.knownDirectSubclasses.flatMap(getSubclasses) symbol match { case s if s.isModuleClass => Seq(s) case s if s.isClass => Seq(s) ++ children } } } 
 TypeTag is no longer supported, so I'm looking for a way to achieve the same functionality, i.e. implementation for the values method.
 I can freely make changes to the EnumExtender base class, but I would like to avoid forcing changes on the actual enum subclasses.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have two Linux computers and a Windows computer. I use Emacs on all of them. 
 I've been looking for at handy way to share the Emacs configuration file between the computers. The basic step consists in letting the .emacs file on each computer load a common configuration file from a shared directory in Dropbox. With this in place, if I make a customization change on one computer, it is automatically available to the others.
 At least in theory.
 The challenge is that this sharing of a configuration file causes a lot of problems, because in many cases I want different configurations on the three computers. For example:
  
Path names to files will be different on my Linux and Windows computer.
 Font names are different.
 I have some project-specific configuration for a project that exists on one computer, but not on the others.
  
Also, if I install a new Emacs package on one computer, it will not get automatically installed on the others, and this may cause configuration problems.
 All of this can be solved by a very strict discipline about what goes where in various configuration files. But what I'd really like to know is this: Has any of you successfully created such a setup that actually works very well? If so, what insight can you share?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone!
 I am looking for inspiration/ideas for my master's thesis. I will have a year to do it and I am familiar with Haskell, FP and PL theory (with a little bit of language-based security). I don't mind doing front-end GUI stuff either.
 I would love to pick your brains' imagination on something that would be interesting and useful to work on (implementation in Haskell of course :)). Or if you could point me to papers that contain ideas that can be explored in a Master's thesis.

 I'm trying to export org files to pdf using LaTeX's beamer presentation. I'd like to use the async option to export my presentation but I get the error `Initializing asynchronous export process Process 'org-export-process' exited abnormally' I read the [documentation](https://orgmode.org/manual/The-Export-Dispatcher.html) and says I should configure an init file and set the variable `org-export-async-init-file'. I don't have much expirience with lisp-emacs and would appreciate your help.
 Thanks in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently built Emacs from scratch and have been using Xwidgets. However, I can’t get edit mode or videos to work. 
 I have tried “e” to enable it, as well as M-x xwidget-webkit-edit-mode, as well as (add-hook ‘xwidget-webkit-mode ‘xwidget-webkit-edit-mode). Nothing seems to work; none of my key presses register and they seem to still execute commands. I thought it might be evil-mode, but disabling that doesn’t help (now everything echoes <k> is undefined). Does anyone know what the problem might be?
 As well, videos infinitely load. I know this is a known bug but it seemed as though it might have gotten fixed; I’m wondering if I’m missing some packages, I’m on alpine so a relatively minimal set of packages out of the box. 
 Thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi
 I ran into a problem with configuration, caused by a malformed database path for a certain package. This causes a problem in emacsql, because it tries to treat the folder name as a file, but the error message is not descriptive at all.
 The more generic question is, how exactly should the user configuration be validated, i.e. I can of course add a check at the beginning of a function that uses it and it works fine, but I'm sure I'm not the first one who thinks about it and there is likely a more elegant/standard way of doing it and maybe some guidelines?
 Current, not very informative error:
 ⛔ Error (use-package): org-roam/:init: EmacSQL had an unhandled condition: sqlitep, nil
 A primitive check:
 (if (file-directory-p org-roam-db-location) (error (format "org-roam-db-location %S should be file, not folder " org-roam-db-location)))

 Have you experimented with it? If so, what are your thoughts about it? In which things do you think Lean4 can not overpass Haskell?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello! I am running Spacemacs on Emacs 29.4 and Ubuntu 24.04. I installed elcord, but the thing in the title keeps happening.
 Two people have already reported issues on Windows on the repo, but the difference is that they were on the native build (which works perfectly fine for me w.r.t. elcord). I made an issue, but I suppose the owner abandoned the repo, so I am asking the community for some help. Is anyone in my situation?
 My suspicion is that the sock isn't being created properly and as such elcord keeps trying to reconnect, which it will never success because the sock won't be created.

I was looking for tutorials to learn Emacs, but decided to learn Neovim first because it has easy-to-follow tutorials on YouTube. Although Emacs has the best beginner-friendly documentation, it is extensive and overwhelming. I need guidance on how to navigate these documents and where to start. I found a YouTuber with an Emacs playlist, but I have trouble understanding his content. 
 I only have an hour a day to learn, but I need to get my work done. Please advise on how to learn Org mode to start taking notes.

 Can this be done in emacs? I know that i could write a new function that makes the new window for me before running find-file, but that way i'd have two "find-file" functions depending on wether i want a new window or not, which is more mental overhead. I also couldn't figure out what function is run when hitting Return on a find-file entry in the minibuffer.
 Any way to set up a bind/function that does what i'm looking for?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi! persp-project bridges perspective mode to the built-in project.el library. The idea is to create a separate perspective when switching projects. A perspective is an independent workspace for Emacs, similar to multiple desktops in Gnome and MacOS. This integration allows you to easily know which project you're currently in, and focus on files that only belong to the current project when switching buffers.
 ⚠️ NOTE: This package has come to life adapting the great package persp-projectile by Bozhidar Batsov with ChatGPT. I didn't write a single line of code. What inspired me to create this package is my recent effort to avoid most third party packages, specially if they prefer a newly defined interface over the built-in Emacs interface.
 Also special shutout to Natalie Weizenbaum for making such a great package!
 I would appreciate any feedback, I'll try to submit the package to MELPA next.

 And no completions show up.
 Auto-completion works with elisp (which comes by default I suppose), but not with c/c++.
 Also when I do M-x company-diag It says:

 I am using Linux Mint with Emacs version 27.1. I also tried to use Emacs 29 but it doesn't work there either, It gives an error saying:

 Did anyone have this issue and is it worth solving it or should I just use auto-complete?

 I worked in win, mac, gentoo, debian, redhat and for every circumstance i used different prebuilt ide like eclipse, visual studio and jetbrains, and vim with minimum knowledge for server management (copy, delete, regex replace... and i really hate counting!!!!)
 Now i use VSCode that is perfect for all my needs : project managements, rust developing, integrated terminal, docker and k8s integration.
 The only problem is that it becomes a ram eating machine and since i am non confident with websites like "downloadmoreram.com", i would like to switch to another editor.
 The lack of an integrated terminal will not be a problem but a tree on the side is fundamental.
 Did you suggest me to start from scratch with the emacs manual or a prebuilt env like doom?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've posted about the ekg notetaking app for emacs before. After a brief hiatus, I'm back working on it, and I'm pretty excited about the latest changes.
 A few weeks ago I also put out a new version of llm with a new module, llm-prompt, which allows templatized prompts that have easy and effective context filling, something that hasn't existed yet in any emacs module, AFAIK. The new version of ekg uses this new feature.
 Previously, the ekg-llm library would send the contents of the note, along with instructions to the LLM, which would then append to the note. Now, we also send the latest notes with the same tags, and similar notes, as part of the llm request context. This turns out to be a really important enhancement to the quality of the llm responses, and now using ekg is, IMHO, the best way to interact with LLMs. You can also edit the responses before you save them into a note (or just not save them at all). This is something else that can help improve the response quality. At times, the responses I'm getting are really magical - it really is what many people call a "second brain", but for real. I find myself using it constantly as a default way to interact with LLMs.
 I give an intro to ekg and talk about using it as a "second brain" in this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC_h3syRKro
 The other improvements to this version of ekg are primarily Markdown improvements (using markdown instead of org-mode is kind of necessary if you are using it to talk to llms), fixing issues and getting inline links to work.

 There are various ways to frame this problem:
  
finding a way to "compose" serveWithContext
 passing data from one combinator to another

Does anyone know if it is actually possible as I've run into a bit of a wall.

 https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/emacs/windows/emacs-29/
 I started configuring it and the first thing I did is install evil-mode, so I can have nice Vim keybindings.
 I installed it with ELPA, and the installation seemed to work without any issues. The error shows up when I try to use the evil-mode package, with:
 M-x evil-mode
 , or with:
 (require 'evil) (evil-mode 1) 
 directly in my config file.
 This is the error Emacs prompts me:
 Warning (comp): evil-vars.el:561:25: Warning: the function `evil-delete-backward-word' is not known to be defined. 
 This seems to be an error from the evil package source code, as it is referring to the file evil-vars.el which can be found in the following directory:

Is there any consensus in community how to tackle problem of auth? I found some abandoned JWT libs, and the ones that are maintained are fairly unpopular. I guess this is the problem when you want to use well known and battle tested solution so using some Java libs seems like a no brainer. On the other hand using Java libs sacrifices a little bit of pure FP approach. What are you using on production with Typelevel stack to implement auth these days?

 Some fonts have alternative characters behind character variants (cv), stylistic sets (ss), or other (onum, zero), and it would be very nice not to have to use an external tool to modify the fonts by hand to use them.
 It is almost a requirement to use certain fonts: their g and r are just weird, but FiraCode with the default @ and & is unusable :P
 It is supported in LaTeX (maybe only LuaLaTeX's fontspec?), and by the enemy...

 I'm working with C#, TypeScript (nodejs, react, etc), Python.
 It seems that TypeScript support is enabled gracefully with js and lsp module in init.el
 But C#... I can't understand. Anyone been able to enable it?
 EDIT: for people coming here in the future: (csharp +lsp) in init.el will enable lsp auto start in csharp files. BUT you need a language server. First time opening .cs file do M-x lsp, it will suggest you to install language server. Roslyn (csharp-roslyn) did NOT work for me, so I installed omnisharp. It worked :D

 I wish to sort directories before files, within the Completions buffer. This buffer is shown when executing C-x C-f TAB TAB, and should be done within a directory that contains directories and folders.
 The ls command has the option --group-directories-first, which is the behaviour I would like to achieve within the Completions buffer.
 Any insight is appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm encountering a peculiar issue with cursor behavior in Emacs, and I'm hoping someone can help me resolve it:
  
When the cursor is on Hebrew text, it becomes completely invisible.
 This only occurs with the cursor type set to 'bar'.
 The 'box' cursor type works without issues.
 There's a similar, but slightly different issue with Arabic text.
  
I use Emacs 29.3 for Mac. Changing font and bidi settings haven't solved the issue. Now I have no clue where to look for solution 
 Here is a short video to illustrate the problem.

 "doom eamcs recent files when i change dir of my file i want recent file to remove the old location entry"
 chatGPT gave me the code
 ```
 ;; Function to remove old file path from recentf list (defun remove-recentf-entry-if-moved (oldpath newpath) "Remove OLD-PATH from recentf-list if file is moved to NEWPATH." (recentf-edit-list) (setq recentf-list (cl-delete-if (lambda (path) (string-equal path oldpath)) recentf-list)) (recentf-save-list))
 ;; Hook the function to after-save-hook to update recentf list after saving a file (add-hook 'after-save-hook (lambda () (let ((buffer-file-name (buffer-file-name))) (when buffer-file-name (remove-recentf-entry-if-moved buffer-file-name (file-truename buffer-file-name))))))
 ```
 adding this code to me config file gave me the following unneeded behaviour
  
whenever i try to quit recentf-edit-list opens
 whenever i save a file the saved file is removed from recent file
  
I didn't want that so i just removed the code ran doom/reload yet the issue remained. The config file is clearly devoid of the code provided to me by chatGPT .
 After that failed i ran doom sync and then doom/reload still no change.
 I thought f#ck it and just reverted back to my previous commit and the issue still remains.
 Now i dont know what to do anymore.
 Please help as i just started getting into emacs 3 days ago and not good enough yet to deal with this myself.
 This is the value of my after-save-hook
 ```
 (diff-hl-update +emacs-lisp-non-package-mode flycheck-handle-save t ws-butler-after-save) Original value was nil Local in buffer config.el; global value is (doom-modeline-update-vcs doom-modeline-update-buffer-file-name #f(compiled-function () #<bytecode 0x96b404426f0cb9f>) +evil-display-vimlike-save-message-h doom-auto-revert-buffers-h doom-guess-mode-h)

 ANY HELP IS VERY MUCH APPRECIATED

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I appreciate all the dev work that's gone into making HLS possible. It's capabilities are way beyond what I experienced back when I was last writing Haskell and has made it so much easier to quickly look up documentation and get autocomplete without having to scroll through hackage documentation for all of the functions and types that I forget.
 However, my experience using it with neovim has been less than stellar. I seem to have nothing but issues with it, and I can't tell if it's a neovim problem or an HLS problem. I'm using the haskell-tools.nvim plugin with the standard nvim-cmp and lspconfig plugins. Most other language servers work reasonably well, but this one seems particularly finicky and I can't figure out why.
 I'm currently having an issue where if I type anything for about 4-6 seconds after opening the first haskell file in the editor (while the language server is starting) it causes HLS to completely hang and become unresponsive. I'm also having issues with nvim-cmp screaming at me about misplaced dollar signs in snippets (I'm assuming because the haskell suggestions contain things like $ and $!).
 I decided to temporarily install vscode to see if that would do it. Everything worked completely flawlessly out of the box, absolutely no issues. The problem is, I would really rather not use vscode if I don't absolutely have to.
 Has anyone been able to get a working config for haskell in neovim that plays nice? I'm thinking of maybe scrapping haskell-tools and configuring things directly to see if that helps, otherwise I've spent so much time fiddling with the editor that I may have to leave it and come back later when things improve.

This coming year, I will have to complete a programming project as part of my qualification as a student. I have taken to the idea of using Haskell for this task, but I have gotten stuck on any ideas for the project. I'm aware of the nature of Haskell and how it's used in production, but am still stuck for ideas. Could anyone give me any project ideas? What have you personally developed in Haskell? What other Haskell projects do you use/find interesting? What aspects of Haskell do you find interesting to work with yourself? What sort of projects should I avoid?
 I am sorry if you have seen these types of posts frequently, but I could not find anything that was particularly useful to me. 
 Thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So my understanding of how API calls work in Haskell is something like this — The API request data that comes over the network is just a string(correct me if I'm wrong) and it gets converted into haskell record types by Aeson, that we can use in our applications.
 Now, Aeson uses instance declarations like below to convert the data to the record types.
 instance FromJSON MyType where parseJSON = ... 
 I can see from hoogle that the type of parseJSON is parseJSON :: Value -> Parser a, so the string that came over the network seems to have already been converted into a Value type.
 My question is how does the string type gets converted into Value type and where? If I want to do some transformation or validation on this string value, how can I go about it?

 Whenever I star Emacs and open any org-file with #+startup: overview for the first time, I can't expand any headings. And I can't figure out why. Executing normal-mode or org-mode with the same buffer has no effect. I have to close it and re-open it again. 
 I'm using Doom, but I rolled my own module, I'm not using the "official" Org module. Maybe this is an issue with straight.el? I don't know, I'm trying to manually call the commands - org-fold-reveal, org-cycle, and even org-reload (that reloads all of org.el Lisp files) etc. Nothing's working.
 Does anyone else have the same problem? Can anyone give any suggestions how to troubleshoot this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello! I’ve started work on a QML library for Haskell!
 I had this idea of a kind of MVVC interface for a UI library in Haskell. A very very terribly written alpha is now here:
 https://github.com/yobson/qml-hs
 Is definitely isn’t fully implemented, and probably has memory leaks
 But it would be great if I could get feedback on the interface. There are no docs, so you will find the interface in the example (test/Main.hs)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What is effect? I asked ChatGPT and it gave me various answers:
  
Effect types are any types of kind Type -> Type.
 Effect types are types of kind Type -> Type that have an instance of Functor.
 Effect types are types of kind Type -> Type that have an instance of Applicative.
  
Sometimes it insists that a computation f a (where f is a functor) does not have an effect, only a context. To have a computational effect, there must be function application involved, so it uses terms like functorial context, applicative effect and monadic effect. However, it confuses me because the functor (->) a represents function application, as with State s and Reader r.
 Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, I've been playing a bit with the ideas from the trees that grow paper, and I've stumbled into something I don't quite get.
 Consider the following silly existential:
 type family SomeX (tag :: Type ) (x :: Type) :: Type data Some tag x where Some :: SomeX tag x -> x -> Some tag () 
 If we let:
 -- Proof carries a prof for `psi a` data Proof (psi :: k -> Constraint) (a :: k) where P :: psi a => Proof psi a 
 Then we can "inject" constraints by:
 data Foo type instance SomeX Foo x = (Proof Show x) 
 But, if I try to make a pattern, it throws a compilation error:
 -- Doesn't work 'x' does not unify with 'x1' pattern SomeFoo :: (Show x) => x -> Some Foo () pattern SomeFoo x = Some P x 
 I thought that this unidirectional pattern is supposed to work as an ordinary (possibly smart) constructor. If i "downgrade" it to an ordinary function, it compiles as expected:
 someFoo :: (Show x) => x -> Some Foo () someFoo x = Some P x

(I feel fairly confident in calling the idea that this improves performance a myth given that Emacs maintainers have frowned upon this practice on this sub)
 Also, are there any other common emacs myths that still go around that should be debunked? I think the idea that using tool-bar-mode or menu-bar-mode hampers your learning of the keyboard shortcuts is unfair and fewer "Intro to Emacs" guides should ask newcomers to turn them off.

 I'm happy to announce the new cognitive-complexity package, it is basically a port of codemetrics (based on tree-sitter) to the built-in treesit in Emacs 29+.
 https://github.com/abougouffa/cognitive-complexity
 The package implements the Cognitive Complexity metric for code, allowing it to calculate a score that describes the understandability of a piece of code.
 It is basically an implementation of Cognitive Complexity - A new way of measuring understandability.
 The original codemetrics package is based on the tree-sitter library, I forked it to port it to treesit so it can be used with Emacs 29+. I tried also to simplify the fork by removing some dependencies like dash and s.
 Looking forward for your feedback!

 I'd like the layout to look something like this: https://imgur.com/a/5NS7Es4
 But I'm completely lost.
 I understand that I need to set dedicated windows, but I am unable to figure out how Treemacs fits into that.
 If someone could help with the basic layout, I can probably figure out the dedicated buffers/windows configuration. Please help!
 Edited to add: After reading Micky Peterson's guide "Demystifying Emacs' Window Manager" I think I understand the display-buffer-alist better now. I also tried saving a layout to .emacs.desktop and I'm reading through that, too. I think what is causing issues for me is the Treemacs sidebar window is special and doesn't use a window. This is definitely a big ol' can of worms!

I didn't know with which tool I had installed specific parts of the Haskell tool chain (Haskell-plattform, Chocolatte, ghcup, ... etc)
  
So how it went:
  
uninstallation of stack went smooth
 uninstallation of ghcup went smooth
 uninstallation of chocolatte went smooth
  
remark: I allso purged the env-variables of stack/ghcup/chocolatte
  
I'm not sure how I get rid of cabal/ghc(i) whenn using cabal --version in terminal the output is:cabal --versioncabal-install version 3.4.0.0 compiled using version 3.4.0.0 of the Cabal library
  
when using ghc --version in terminal the output is:
 ghc --version //ghci --version has the same output The Glorious Glasgow Haskell Compilation System, version 8.10.7 
 using where.exe in power shell yields:
 where.exe ghci C:\tools\ghc-8.10.7\bin\ghci.exe C:\ProgramData\chocolatey\bin\ghci.exe C:\tools\ghc-9.2.1\bin\ghci.exe where.exe ghc C:\tools\ghc-8.10.7\bin\ghc.exe C:\ProgramData\chocolatey\bin\ghc.exe C:\tools\ghc-9.2.1\bin\ghc.exe where.exe cabal C:\Users\ -censored- \AppData\Roaming\cabal\bin\cabal.exe 
 So:
 would it be sufficient to just simply purge those folders?

Competitive Programming in Haskell: tree path decomposition, part I by Brent Yorgey
In a previous post I challenged you to solve Factor-Full Tree. In this problem, we are given an unlabelled rooted tree, and asked to create a divisor labelling. That is, we must label the vertices with positive integers in such a way that v is an ancestor of u if and only if v’s label evenly divides u’s label.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey guys, I've been a pure Scala engineer for around 6 years now. The stack I've been working with was the typelevel with tagless final so 90% of our code was in the functional style. I got an offer from one of my previous employers for a Senior Java role and as usual they are using the Java Spring enterprise stack. 
 I'm considering the switch because of the better work-life balance, increased pay and more remote friendly. But what's making me doubt is Java. I haven't used Java (or any OOP language) in an production setting before and mainly throughout my career only used functional languages. Has anyone done a similar shift? Like moving from purely functional scala to Java EE style? And if so how was the adjustment? 
 I did a quick read through some Spring code bases and it just seems like most of the work is just using the spring annotations correctly, which I don't really like since it's seems like doing "config" instead of actual coding.
 So anyone with any experience on making a similar switch and how that went?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Greetings, I'm working on my computer science master's thesis and I'm having trouble finding open-source standalone tools or Intellij/VS code plugins that would provide me with code quality metrics through static analysis on package, class, and/or method levels. Most of what I've found were refactoring or lining tools, and a few paid tools/services that would give me somewhat useful metrics. 
 I reckon I could cobble something together that I could use but it would be a significant time investment. So, I figured I could ask the Scala community for recommendations before I start doing it myself. Any suggestions?
 P.S. The list of metrics that I'm interested in isn't that strict, but generally, it should be at least one of these metric sets: Maintainability Index, Halstead metrics, QMOOD metrics, MOOD metrics, and a few others.
 P.P.S. "MetricsTree" would be an ideal tool if it weren't capable of handling only Java source code. I thought about compiling scala code and then decompiling class files into Java source code but that can skew the metrics too much.

 As I'm using Ivy, I thought, and somehow expected, to be able to achieve the same result. So I tried mu u i. Ivy suggested many mu4e commands, but mu4e-update-index was not near the top.
 As I've learned since, completion-styles, set to (basic partial-completion emacs22), explains how mu-u-i matches.
 Ivy uses its own "completion styles" that are different from the default ones. The default is ivy--regex-plus.
 Now, it's not like Ivy is not matching the command, but it's definitely not in the top results. Thus, using it requires more keys.
 Question: Is it possible to make Ivy matcher work closer to partial-completion or initials completion styles?

 Now, Emacs is never going to be as fast as simpler editors. However, most of the time you shouldn't be able to notice any slowness. All this suggests to me that lots of people are doing things sub-optimally. I have used Emacs for more a very long time. Here I'll give some advice on speed. I haven't deliberately optimized my Emacs setup for speed, but I have avoided things that make it slow.
 Firstly, there are some things that you can't really change....

It seems to be an endless journey to improve my personal knowledge management system. By chance, I discovered "Wardley Mapping" by Simon Wardley [1]. It's a method for understanding how to develop your strategies. My first idea to learn more about this visual tool was to apply it to my Zettelkasten strategy.
Let's take a closer look. A Wardley map allows us to visualize the **Evolution **of business components over time. It starts from the unstable beginnings to more stable, standardized components. These components fall into four stages: genesis, custom, product, and commodity.
First: Genesis components are novel and new. Second: Custom components exist for a specific use case with some proof of value. Third: P…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developing a Wardley Map for using a Zettelkasten in my personal knowledge management involves outlining several components to understand and strategize my approach effectively:
Purpose: Efficiently manage and leverage personal knowledge for continuous learning and productivity.
Scope: Digital note-taking, linking ideas, research support, excluding team collaboration.
User: Primarily self.
User Needs: Quick note capture, efficient organization with tagging and linking, easy retrieval.
Value Chain: From user to Zettelkasten.
Wardley Map: Helps to visualize the different components and their current state in the evolution, guiding where to focus efforts to improve my personal knowledge management system.
And here is my story: I started my changes to improve my personal knowledge management system by moving from OneNote to Obsidian two years ago (1). The major change was my first contact with the Zettelkasten framework (2). It was hard for me to change my personal organization from thinking in "folders" to "tagging" (3). My current challenge is to use analytical reading to improve my notes (4).
What will the next steps be? What are your recommendations?

 I work as a sysadmin and it is a common occurrence that I have to execute a command on a number of hosts (or a number of files) simultanously. What I currently do is have several buffers open at once and then switch to each buffer, make my change, go to the next buffer -- which, you can guess, is very tedious.
 After searching for a bit, I found the wonderful BROADCAST-MODE which allows you to do this for visible buffers. And indeed, it works just fine for regular text buffers. However, I was saddened to find out it doesn't seem to work with VTERM, my terminal emulator of choice within emacs.
 Is there another mode I have failed to find? Is there a configuration settings I forgot to tweak? I'd love to hear your suggestions.
 Have a good day, fellows :)

 I cloned the Emacs and Tree-sitter repos and decided to build the latest version of each on Fedora 37. While attempting to compile Emacs, I ran into several very frustrating build issues.
 My first issue was that while running ./configure --with-tree-sitter --with-native-compilation I kept getting an error saying that tree-sitter could not be found. The version that was available from dnf was too old, so I decided to clone the tree-sitter repo and compile it myself. In spite of tree-sitter building without issue, it was still failing to register with the Emacs configure script.
 The solution ended up being to first runldconfig after tree-sitter is done compiling:
 sudo ldconfig /usr/local/lib
 Then, to ensure that the emacs configure script finds it, export the path:
 export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig
 Then you can runmake && sudo make installand everything should work.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to figure out a nice way to express arrays of composite values, like (a, b, c). For a variety of reasons I want to represent this with a composite of simple arrays, so for example an array of (a, b, c) would actually be structured as (array a, array b, array c). This is nice because zip- and unzip- like operations essentially become free. As I understand it, Data.Vector.Unboxed does something like this, although I don't get quite how it works. For this particular application Data.Vector.Unboxed is not suitable however as I'm making this array library specifically for an FFI which requires pinned memory.
 What I want to do is define composite types in a simliar way to how a value level list might be,
 comp = a:b:c:[] 
 so that it can be transformed by applying a type level function to each element
 map f (a:b:c:[]) == f a:f b:f c:[] 
 My current thinking is that it might be possible to express this type of transform on the type level somehow, but It's not clear to me how.
 The purpose of this would be to have a neat way to relate the element type to the array type, so I'd have something like
 CompArray (a <:> b <:> c <:> ()) ~ Array a <:> Array b <:> Array c <:> () 
 Any ideas on how to express this, or is it not possible to do this kind of type level programming in Haskell?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So my employer is forcing us to not use Intellij, we HAVE to use VS Code now. They will even scan our computers to make sure we don't have intellij installed... yeah. 
 So thing is that we are on sbt 13.18. We got a lot going on right now and upgrading sbt is not something we want to do in the next month (we have 2 months to transition to VS Code). 
 From what I understand, to get any kind of useful IDE features in VS Code, you need to use Scala Metals, but Scala metals only works with sbt 1.0+? 
 I tried running some basic metals commands and they don't seem to exist for my version of sbt. Is there any sub 1.0+ version that supports metals? What is my best option here? 
 Or am I just making stuff up and I have no idea what I'm talking about?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently I switched from vim to emacs, and I'm building my configuration as I go. I configured most of the editor as I needed it. but there are some custom actions that I don't know how to achieve in emacs. 
 Basically I had custom functions for fuzzy finder (in my case it was fzf) to call an external program for list of data (i.e. the stdout lines) and select the line using the fuzzy finder then pass it to another external program which returned the path of the file and then I could use edit command to open that file in a new buffer.
 I want to do the same thing in emacs mini-buffer but I don't know where to start. I've read the chapter about completion in the emacs manual but could not understand anything...
 It worth mentioning that I use vertico, marginalia and ordderless packages and It would be nice to use the marginalia to show more information about the items / files.

 Started getting into emacs, and trying to get mu4e to work nicely with my university email, which unfortunately is provided by google. So far I've managed to get the receiving part working by invoking oama, but I can't get the smtp part working. Using this configuration:
  (make-mu4e-context :name "EMTA" :match-func (lambda (msg) (when msg (string-prefix-p "/emta"(mu4e-message-field msg :maildir)))) :vars '((user-mail-address . "myemail@uni.ee") (user-full-name . "Kenneth Flak") (smtpmail-smtp-server . "smtp.gmail.com") (smtpmail-auth-credentials . (secrets-get-secret "Default keyring" "oama - myemail@gmail.com")) (smtpmail-stream-type . ssl) (smtpmail-smtp-service . 465) ... etc...  I am pretty sure the culprit is the smtpmail-auth-credentials part, but I don't know enough elisp yet to debug.
 Any help much appreciated!

The variable system-configuration-options has the value "--with-json --with-xwidgets --with-tree-sitter". So I pulled from the repo, and checked out master (I checked this had worked and the last commit in my local repo is from three hours ago). I ran make clean to clean the repo, then ./autogen.sh, and then ./configure --with-json --with-xwidgets --with-tree-sitter, literally just copying in the flags that my current emacs tells me I used to configure the build last time. ./configure runs, but the first and lines of the output say configure: WARNING: unrecognized options: --with-json.
 I'm not sure what to do about this. I want to build with proper json support like I currently have. I can't find anything in NEWS or the changelogs about this build option being deprecated, and searching the devel list archives doesn't bring up anything.
 Questions: - why is this option not recogized? - how should I configure my build to get proper json support?
 TIA!

I've been using Emacs and web-mode since 2020, and have never experienced any issues; however just recently I found that whenever I open a PHP file, web-mode will highlight the syntax of whatever HTML is in the file, but completely ignore PHP code.
 My web-mode configuration. And a link to my personal configuration 
 (use-package web-mode :ensure t :config (setq web-mode-enable-auto-quoting t) (setq web-mode-css-indent-offset 4) (setq web-mode-indent-style 4) (setq web-mode-markup-indent-offset 4) (setq web-mode-code-indent-offset 4) (setq web-mode-enable-current-element-highlight t) (setq web-mode-enable-auto-pairing t) (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.php\\'" . web-mode)) (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.phtml\\'" . web-mode)) (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.blade\\'" . web-mode)) (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.tpl\\'" . web-mode)) (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.[agj]sp\\'" . web-mode)) (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.as[cp]x\\'" . web-mode)) (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.erb\\'" . web-mode)) (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.mustache\\'" . web-mode)) (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.djhtml\\'" . web-mode)) (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.html?\\'" . web-mode)) (setq web-mode-engines-alist '(("blade" .

 I have an org file that tangle to a Bash shell script. In the resulting tangled file, I was to add comment lines at the top. Inserted of just including these comment lines in the org file source blocks, I want to write the comments in a text file and include the file so that when the org file is tangled, the comment file is pretended to the tangled file.
 I tried to use the following:
 #+INCLUDE: "~/comments"
 #+BEGIN_SRC sh
 #!/usr/bin/env bash
 ...do something
 #+END_SRC
 But, the contents of the comments file is not showing up in the tangled file. 
 Any ideas are welcome.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I'm trying to build a major mode, the functionality is not really that important for the question, but for the curious it is something akin to org-roam.
 I'm not new to programming, or even lisp, but new to emacs lisp.
 I'm not sure how to approach a first working prototype, as the resources I found seem to focus only on syntax highlighting and indentation, but I would like to prototype something like when I open a file of this new major mode, that two windows open side by side, one with the source file and another one with a graphical representation based on the contents of the file.
 If anyone can point me in the right direction I would greatly appreciate it. Thanks!
 PD: To anyone who might say it might be silly to start on this if I'm new to elisp, it's the way I like to learn, doing and improving as I go, most often times it works pretty well, but in this case I'm lost as to where to start.
 Edit: I'm looking for resources, other than the Elisp manual, which is the only thing I'm currently reading but I don't know if reading the manual top to bottom will point me in the right direction, thanks!

 The Diagrams library has the most elegant API I've ever worked with. A bunch of years ago I went to a Haskell hackathon, and Brent Yorgey very patiently helped me make a PR for a simple feature, explained to me about affine transformations, partial vs total functions and the like. It left a lasting impression, really made me want to do more FP. Thanks Brent, whereever you are!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I have been trying, and so far not completely succeeding, in setting up mu4e to access Outlook365 email. This setup involves:
  
davmail
 mbsync
 mu/mu4e
  
As I don't want to litter the initial message with a ton of configuration, which I can provide later when needed, I will jump to questions.
 Reading the mu4e manual I have learned about the 2 operations: move and refile.
  
Is it correct to think of Refile as what is currently found in email services like Gmail or Outlook365 under the name Archive?
 
what configuration is needed or what actions do I need to apply for email to be actually moved to the target mailbox when using move or refile?
 
 With my current setup, I have noticed the emails being copied (or duplicated) to the target directory while they continue to appear in the Inbox when using the Outlook app. On mu4e, the initial emails are not available anymore (as I was thinking that maybe I could delete them).
 This behavior is surprising to me and I'm thinking that 1) either it is a misconfiguration; or 2) it involves a different set of actions to lead to the result I intend.
 thank you for helping a mu4e newbie

New member here, hello :-)
I've been reading a lot about Zettelkasten lately and I would like to try it out.
The site https://zettelkasten.de/ has been a great place to start. I still have a couple of questions, but most of them will become clear while I'm using ZK I guess.
Still 1 thing is not very clear to me. I know a note initially starts as a concept, but I'm wondering when you add more context to your existing note, what do you do with the original text, do you keep it or rewrite the whole note into something new?
Sorry if my question is not clear.
Thank you]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This question can be worded a lot better but I'm honestly drawing a blank. The premise is this, I'm thinking of building an upgraded GUI for Emacs (for no reason other than fun). I have two options: 1. building the GUI from scratch and bridging to the Emacs functionality then have the custom GUI render all the events from Emacs OR 2. maybe I can just edit the already existing source code for the GUI and add features or change it entirely. I just want to know what files to start digging. I could be going about this all wrong entirely, but that's my plan so far. I know frame.c and window.c manages outputs and stuff I'm just trying to be thorough and see if there is maybe something else I can look at in the source code.

 here are steps I did to build emacs maybe there is something wrong with them:
  
clone emacs from github 
 
take a snapshot of emacs 29 using: archive origin/emacs-29 | tar -x -C ../emacs-29
 
go to emacs-29 dir and run autogen[.]sh 
 
run ./configure --with-gif --with-gnutls=ifavailable --with-json --with-modules --with-xwidgets --with-rsvg it only complains about mail being unecrypted no warning or anything about svg.
 
make && sudo make install
 
run emacs 
 
 when finished I run (image-type-available-p 'svg) it returns nil (also tested with emacs -Q ).
 I tried this multiple times no matter how I did it, it won't build with svg.
 I also tried to build with native compilation but gcc failed to compile the test ( when I tested the test file it resulted in an error with segmentation fault )
 my system:
 os: ubuntu-18.04( I know it is old but I have a gpu problem that prevent any recent version to run properly)
 gcc: gcc (Ubuntu 7.5.0-3ubuntu1~18.04) 7.5.0

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Despite my best efforts, I haven't been able to get my normal emacs configuration to render the left and right quotes (u+201C and u+201d: "“”"). Instead, I just the get the ASCII quote symbols highlighted in blue to indicate that they're actually not the ASCII quote character. The same applies to left and right single quotes.
 As implied by my post title, this problem only applies when running emacs in daemon mode. if instead of launching emacsclient I run /usr/bin/emacs from a graphical environment, I get a frame where the quote characters work fine. I'm inferring that there's some variable somewhere that determines whether or not quote characters should be substituted, and it's being set to false when emacs runs daemonized because there's no graphical environment, but I'm unsure what variable that would be and where it would be set.
 I am using emacs 29.4 with pgtk enabled, on Arch Linux. My WM is Sway, which means I am running under wayland. The font I am using is Terminus 16.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to figure out the recommend workflow for writing a standalone haskell program. Say I want to write a single program in a file 'test.hs' that depends on modules not in the prelude. And I want to compile this into an executable. So I cannot simply complie this with `ghc test.hs`, since I will get the complaint that ghc cannot find the module I need.
 So what is the recommended work around? I know you can use cabal or stack to build a project and the specify dependencies in the .cabal file. But this seems heavy duty for a single haskell file. Specifically, using `cabal init` will create a directory `app`, the file `CHANGELOG.md`, and the .cabal file, just for this single haskell file. Further `cabal init` asks quite a lot, including asking about which license to use, leading me to believe `cabal init` is meant for much more heavy duty projects.
 Using stack has a similar amount of, if not more, overhead.
 tldr; Is using `cabal init` or `stack new` the best way to create a stand alone `.hs` file depend on hidden packages? What is the recommended way?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to find some YT videos I've seen before, on writing technical docs using org-mode. I already have some System Crafters ones, and also those from spudlyo but while useful, they're not the specific one(s) I'm thinking of. I think the presenter had either an Australian (or maybe Kiwi/Tassie) or South African accent.
 Any suggestions?
 Incidentally, I did ask ChatGPT for its input. And while I have to acknowledge that accent is not a perfect predictor of nationality, I reckon it's still often a good one. And so I have my doubts over ChatGPT's three suggestions. The first was David Wilson, who doesn't sound very Australian. The second was System Crafters, but that Just Is David Wilson. The third reply was the charm though, and makes me think ChatGPT must be having a particularly bad day, hallucinations-wise, because it said:
  
...another prominent Australian YouTuber who focuses on Emacs and Org mode is 'Protesilaos Stavrou'
  
Again, I know accent doesn't map perfectly to nationality, but clearly Prot doesn't sound remotely Australian. Thing is, ChatGPT actually seemed to be "aware" of the issue, because it went on to say:
  
While not exclusively Australian, his content is highly relevant and valuable for Emacs and Org mode users.
  
So there you go, Prot. If you're reading this you'll be glad to know that ChatGPT acknowledges that you are not "exclusively" Australian. Fair dinkum.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I need to change the color of the modified lines in my git-gutter. I found this code online and I put it in my config.el
  (custom-set-faces `(git-gutter-fr:added ((t (:foreground "#00ff00")))) ;; green `(git-gutter-fr:modified ((t (:foreground "#ffff00")))) ;; yellow `(git-gutter-fr:deleted ((t (:foreground "#ff0000")))) ;; red ) ) 
 But it doesn't seem to do anything and there are no errors.
 I need to change the color of git blame line (from why-this package). The README file says I need to add:
 (set-face-background 'why-this-annotate-heat-map-cold "#203448") (set-face-background 'why-this-annotate-heat-map-warm "#382f27") 
 I put this also in my config.el and this no effect at all either. I have already tried restarting Emacs and everything and none of my settings have any effect.
 Is it just me or did everyone else also start with so much of frustration when they got started with Emacs? I did not expect something like just changing a color to be so complicated.
 UPDATE:
 Fixed the first issue based on this thread: https://github.com/doomemacs/themes/issues/268
 (custom-set-faces
 '(diff-hl-insert ((t (:foreground "#00ff00"))))
 '(diff-hl-change ((t (:foreground "#ffff00"))))
 '(diff-hl-delete ((t (:foreground "#ff0000"))))
 )
 Still struggling with the why-this package.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m on a bit of an FFI discovery journey, trying to make some bindings to openCV (it’s mostly to get better at FFI writing, less for publishing)
 OpenCV is a really interesting library because it’s Mat data type handles memory really well.
 It reference counts the actual matrix data. You can have several openCV transformations that use several Mats, but open CV will maybe do everything in place.
 The question is, how best to do this in Haskell? It feels like a job for the ST monad?
 So my questions: Is there a way of using c++ class destructors in Haskell? Calling them when values go out of scope? I worry about this because using Cont would lead to space leaks with loops(?)
 Even though I have storable instances, I seem to only be able to work with pointers to Mats, not the types themselves
 Can I use the ST monad? Is there any reason I shouldn’t?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I'm trying to setup emacs for python. Here is my current configuration:
 (setq major-mode-remap-alist '((python-mode . python-ts-mode))) (use-package eglot :ensure t :hook (python-mode . eglot-ensure) :config (add-to-list 'eglot-server-programs '(python-mode .

 This has multiple problems. First, when writing import ... I don't get completions. Second, if I have import numpy as np then later np. doesn't get completed to anything correct. I'm not sure which package is in charged of this and would love help in this regard.

 https://github.com/plokhotnyuk/jsoniter-scala/compare/v2.30.3...v2.30.6
 The main operations that contributed on time/battery spends happened to be divisions of `Long` values on some constants during serialization of `BigDecimal`, `BigInt`, `Long`, `Float`, `Double`, `java.time.Duration` and `java.time.Instant` values.
 Here are final results measured on different browsers:

 I want to keyboard-macro search in dired buffer for a file name of the form ‘fuu[0-9]’. When playing macro, As long as there is a file name in the dired buffer of the form fuu[0-9]+, I’m good, keyboard macro continues playing after finding the file name. However, if dired buffer only contains file name ‘fuu’, macro terminates prematurely with failed regexp search when ‘]’ char is played, before ‘’ char is played. Any ideas?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm working my way through the excellent Crafting Interpreters book and decided to do the first part in Haskell instead of Java. Everything has been going swimmingly until we got to closures, which introduced a subtle problem involving variable shadowing. To fix this, the book introduces a semantic analysis pass where all the variables get resolved to their proper scope before any actual interpreting happens.
 This analysis pass uses a Map Expression Int, mapping from an expression to a location in the stack of scopes of the program where the variable can be found. In Java, because `Expression` is a separate object with its own object ID, this works out fine. In my Haskell version I have implemented Expression something like the following:
 data Expression = Grouping Expression
 | Unary UnaryOperation Expression
 | Binary BinaryOperation Expression Expression
 | Literal LiteralContents
 | Variable String
 | Assignment String Expression
 -- etc
 deriving (Show,Eq,Ord)
 This has worked very well so far, however it does introduce a problem with regards to the Map Expression Int: Any Variable "abc" will be considered equal, even if they come from very different nodes in the AST. The derived functions for Eq will not do here.
 What is the recommended way to solve this? So far I've come up with:
  
Try and fake the Java way of object equality by using `StablePtr` and friends, though that may not work too well with the (hash)map.
 Add a unique integer to every node in the AST to disambiguate them.
 Add the original source location to every Expression, so that different references to the same variable would be disambiguated by their source location. This feels a bit dirty though, since it would bleed implementation details from the scanner/parser into the interpreter.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Few days ago I happened to stumble upon an interesting read and link on SX, about a calendar library in Common Lisp. I actually ordered a book to the local library (we can distance-borrow in Sweden), and I found an interesting statement in Preface:
 "Our initial motivation was an effort by one of us (E.M.R.) to create Emacs-Lisp code that would provide calendar and diary features for GNU Emacs ( ... ) A deluge of inquiries from around the globe soon made it clear to us that there was keen interest in an explanation that would go beyond the code itself"
 Ha! Looking at the calendar.el, indeed, the author is one of the authors of the book in question (Calendrical Calculations).
 Basically, what they say, Emacs and Emacs community inspired them to gather together information and write probably the most authoritative book on the subject yet. How cool is that!

 Is there a way to implement something like this? I want the keymap to be repeatable but I want a key to exit the keymap.
 I tried to use "q" #'ignore :repeat (:exit ("ignore")), but that did not work.

 (use-package flycheck ;; Flycheck base package :ensure t :commands global-flycheck-mode :config (setq flycheck-global-modes '(not org-mode)) :init (setq flycheck-emacs-lisp-load-path 'inherit) (add-hook 'after-init-hook #'global-flycheck-mode)) 
 Note the sixth line, it tells global-flycheck-mode not to apply in org.
 On my Linux machine, this works. On my MacOS MacBook, it doesn't. Both machines use the same config files (managed in a GitHub repo), and both are running Emacs 29.4 (Linux is custom-built, Mac is a Homebrew cask).
 Yesterday (when I noticed this while doing some heavy editing of an org file on the Mac) I tried a number of different things to get FC to not be on for org, but every time I restarted Emacs the org buffers had FC enabled.
 Does this sound familiar to anyone here?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am entering my senior year of my BSc. in Data Science (primarily use R and python). I first learned about Emacs my freshman year and was intrigued by the potential -- keyboard-focused, modularity, customization, etc. I started using and configuring vanilla Emacs as my "daily driver" about 18mo ago. Within the last 6mo I have used `org-agenda` to organize my schedule, Jupyter notebooks for class assignments, and record most* of my notes using `denote` (*need to spend some time configuring latex for math notes). 
 This summer, I completed a Data Science internship at a medium-ish sized tech company. Although most of my classwork is in Jupyter notebooks, the dev team discourages the use of notebooks. Experiments are mostly organized in python files but it does seem that others still use Jupyter notebooks to tinker with code snippets or intermediate plotting. All development is done remotely across a number of servers and docker containers.
 Needless to say, my "little" Emacs configuration was not up to the task. The jump from using Emacs for my homework assignments to fleshing out a reliable IDE that I can be used on the job is overwhelming. I struggle to envision how I would make that jump. I am aware of `tramp` and `lsp-bridge`, for example, but have read a lot of complaints about latency or `magit` being slow. Alternatively, one could install Emacs on given server ... but how common is it that companies allow you to do that? 
 For those that use Emacs professionally: How do you use Emacs at your company? Do you run Emacs locally but develop over tramp, what is that experience like? If not, does your company allow you to install Emacs on a server?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Is there a neat way of handling configuration data in Haskell that doesn't involve threading the configuration all the way through the compution?
 What I mean by "constant" configuration is stuff that will not change throughout the lifetime of the program, so you could embed it in code as a simple function, but where it would be generally good software engineering practice to keep it in an updatable file, rather than embdedding it in code.
 A few examples of what I mean:
  
A collection of units and their conversions, it would be useful to have a file of this data and have it read when the program starts, so that additional units can be added or values corrected without recompiling, plus some functions to get units by name, etc.
 Calendars giving things like the (notoriously difficult) dates of Easter
 Message files
 Locale information, such as Basque days of the week
  
The default, as far as I can see, is to embed the data directly into the program, possibly using template haskell or just as code. For example, I can see how Yesod handles messages and keeps type safety. But not being able to add a new language or reword things without recompilng is more than a bit meh to my eye.
 In my current application, I'm looking at calendar definitions. I'd like to be able to have a file saying "Pentecost is the 50th day after Easter Sunday. Easter Sunday is supposed to have a definition but it got messed up and it's now effectively an arbitary list of dates. Australia Day is on the 26th of January." etc. etc. and then, if I'm reading JSON and there is a named calendar, just get the calendar defintiion. Threading stuff through the compution looks both incredibly awkward and just a bit tacky.
 Does anyone have any pointers to a good technique?

 Anybody have any advice on how to debug this?
  
EDIT1: This Emacs is 30.x from the Guix emacs-next pacakge. TIL that you can guix install emacs-next --with-debug-info=emacs-next and Guix will recompile the package with debug symbols. Now how long is THAT going to take? ;)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Consider the following:
 ``` type role M nominal data M a -- .. a has a nominal role
 type role N representational data N a where N :: (Coercible b a) => M b -> N a ```
 Now if M is a functor, N is a functor, like so:
  instance Functor N where fmap f (N m) = N (fmap (f . coerce) m) 
 But less say I have: 
  class MakeM a where makeM :: M a 
 Then I can't say:
 ``` class MakeM a where makeM :: M a
 newtype MyM a = MyM a deriving newtype (MakeM) ```
 Because a has a nominal role in M.
 But I can say: 
 ``` class MakeN a where makeN :: N a
 newtype MyN a = MyN a deriving newtype (MakeN) ```
 Because a has a representative role in N.
 But it's my understanding that the Coercible dictionary is still included in the datatype as a field at runtime (see here and here): 
 Why?
 Is this just an optimisation GHC could make but it hasn't got around to?
 It seems to me if that any calls to coerce are eliminated at runtime, you should be able to drop the pointer to the Coercible dictionary. You're never going to use it anyway.
 Furthermore, in this particular case, I can't see why we just make N a newtype of M:
  newtype N a where N :: (Coercible b a) => M b -> N a 
 As once we get rid of the dictionary we've just got an indirection, could we just get rid of it (I'm not as sure about this though).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In my previous post which was answered and I learned a ton from (thank you all!), I was trying to write a megaparsec parser for the NATS protocol messages.
 I got my message parser down to something that I like and is somewhat readable:
 ```haskell pMsgMessage :: Parser ProtocolMessage pMsgMessage = do _ <- string "MSG" <* hspace1 subject <- validSubject <* hspace1 sid <- many alphaNumChar <* hspace1 reply <- try (fmap Just validSubject <* hspace1) <|> return Nothing len <- integer <* crlf
 return $ MsgMessage {..} ```
 This covers a message like:  MSG hello.world s1 reply.to.me 50\r\n  What needs to follow on this message type and a bunch of others is the optional payload. This payload is a string of bytes, and the number of bytes is indicated by the len variable.
 I've tried combinations of takeP and count and some other stuff, but I'm at a loss. Yes, I know I need to learn more (and hitting these walls is how I learn), and I know I lack experience with general purpose combinators.
 So all I'm looking for is a Nothing when len is 0, and a Just ByteString for when it's not.
 The psuedocode I was hoping I could write was something like:
 haskell payload <- try (fmap Just $ take len <* crlf) <|> return Nothing

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I was recently fiddling with programmed completion and want to document it for posterity. There's no example snippet like this in the manual, and it'd have got me started much more easily.
 (defvar my-coll '("foo" "fnord" "baz")) (defun my-programmable-coll (str pred flag) (let ((coll my-coll)) (cond ((eq flag nil) (try-completion str coll pred)) ((eq flag t) (all-completions str coll pred)) ((eq flag 'lambda) (test-completion str coll pred)) ((consp flag) (completion-boundaries str coll pred (cdr flag))) ((eq flag 'metadata) (completion-metadata str coll pred))))) ;; These are equivalent! (completing-read "Pick: " my-coll) (completing-read "Pick: " #'my-programmable-coll) 
 My use-case: now I can hardcode an affixation-function in the metadata, so that I do not need to let-bind completion-extra-properties every time I write a call to completing-read.

Now, when I installed the default version of GNU emacs (v29.3) via sudo apt install emacs, I got a peculiar problem. When I run emacs as the end user, I got the following error shown in the minibuffer:
 Symbol’s function definition is void: eieio-defclass
 When I run it with -q option, it works, but clearly my ~/.emacs.d/init.el file is not loaded. So, when I run: emacs -q --load ~/.emacs.d/init.el it works as usual. So, what is wrong here? Does GNU emacs by default first load and check some files before loading my ~/.emacs.d/init.el file? Thanks a lot for your help!!

@Andy — A big thank you for suggesting this book and hinting that IBIS has some use in research and note-taking. Your suggestion started me documenting questions each idea asks or solves.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have installed Haskell on Ubuntu 22.04 via ghcup (curl command).
 Everything is installed and seems to work, at least as far as I tested. But in the ghcup tui all tools are marked with a grey check mark (with a little "1"), if I try to set a tool as default. I would expect two green check marks.
 On my Laptop everything works as expected. I don't know why it in not working on my PC. Any idea?
 Edit: I completely removed .ghcup and .cabal folders from my home directory and installed everything from scratch. With the same result.
 I can install everything and get a green check mark, but if I try to set it with "s" I get the single grey check mark with a "1"
 I think I found the answer. The problem is the font I use in the terminal. The check marks change depending on the font I use. If I use DejaVu Sans Mono I see two green check marks. Some other fonts show two grey check marks. I assume that what I thought was a "1" is actually a cut-off second hook.

If you want to create a simple settings dashboard, you can use the thearchive:// URL scheme in one of your notes inside of The Archive. There, you can click the links to change settings -- no terminal needed.
For example, try to paste these into a note:
Pasted image filename without spaces: thearchive://preference/pastedImageFilename/set/yyyyMMdd'_image'
Pasted image filename without date: thearchive://preference/pastedImageFilename/set/'pasted-image'
Pasted image filename reset: thearchive://preference/pastedImageFilename/delete

ID's accurate to seconds: thearchive://preference/identifierDateFormat/set/yyyyMMddHHmmss
ID's accurate to minutes: thearchive://preference/identifierDateFormat/set/yyyyMMddHHmm  (original)
ID's accurate to days: thearchive://preference/identifierDateFormat/set/yyyyMMdd

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently I found out that Emacs can deal with so-called noncontiguous regions. I cannot find very much information about these on the internet, the Emacs manual or the Emacs help system. But I'm curious about these noncontiguous regions and want to see if I can use them for something. As an example, something I want to do is to narrow to a noncontiguous region. But to be clear, narrowing to a noncontiguous region is not the problem I want solved here. I just want to learn how to use noncontiguous regions. 
 I'll try to define a clear question. If I want to create a noncontiguous region that contains the columns 4 to 7 on rows 1 and 2 then I can do this using a rectangular region(at least interactively, but I imagine I can recreate that in elisp too). But what if I want to create a noncontiguous region containing columns 4 to 7 on lines 1 and 3 but not line 2. Then I cannot use rectangular regions(as far as I know). Is there a way to do this? I'm not necessarily asking for an interactive way to do it. An elisp solution is fine and even prefered. 
 I've found the variable region-extract-function that perhaps could be useful, but I'm not sure how to use it. In particular, I don't know when the function that this variable is bound to is called. 
 I also found the library zones.el. But from the documentation it seems like it doesn't actually define noncontiguous regions, just something that looks and feels like noncontiguous regions. So this doesn't really satisfy my curiosity. And I'm mainly interested in learning the builtin functionality, so a third party package like this isn't really what I'm looking for.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I understand the title may be vague or nonsensical. But I had to make one, and that was the best I could come up with. A longer version of my question follows.
 I am an amateur Emacsist. I've got a solid understanding of all things *nix, lisp, and configuring a text editor (from prior vim experience). I've been eagerly building up a very comfortable .emacs for the past few months, and have been loving the experience in general. However, there is one thing that bothers me which I don't believe bothers others as much, if not at all: When I try to use some package that adds to or modifies the fundamental Emacs experience — something that modifies things like buffer management, text editing or whatnot — it often clashes with my own previous customizations or even default Emacs behavior. 
 For instance, If I were to use a modal editing package like Evil mode, I'd need to rebind keys to work correctly for every package I added. Think Magit for instance. Another time I faced a similar issue was when I tried popper.el. It's a great package, but It's job is to augment default buffer-handing behavior. I often ran into issues where a buffer created by a function from one package ended up in the wrong place due to popper. This is not a devastating problem as I could always just place the buffer where I want it manually, but that's the point, sort of. 
 I have a very large config, and adding anything that changes the fundamental experience of Emacs becomes a software project of its own with the involvement of design, and large refactors and whatnot. I wonder if that's the case with you guys.
 Does anyone else have the same experience? Is this something I just have to settle for and solve bottom-up by solving the problems as they arise? Am I holding it wrong? I'd love to know you guys' thoughts

 It is with great pleasure to realise we won war against begin-end style boilerplate and "you can't use braceless with lambdas" pointless prejudices and now most of }}}}}}} alike eyesores can be purged with single scalafmt setting. 
 I cannot understand why "reviewing MR with braceless" is "harder" i mean, most of diff visualisers were able to provide unreadable diffs that would make you open both versions and compare them by eye, but aren't you review diff by imaging code which was there and how it changed? To add, diffs show spaces and, its like mostly obvious which indentation level it is. If it isn't, you have indent rainbow, which trivializes tracking.
 Same story with merge conflicts - sometimes you would be able to get braces mismatch regardless, and its harder to fix than indentation mismatch. 
 Well, now we have (), that are the second source of unpronouceable clutter, and [] which are, as well, in some places, yet not as common. I hope someday these would be optional as well.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Is there additional configuration needed when setting up lsp-mode with respect to the tab key for indenting?
 I've noticed that my indentations are always inconsistent. For example, when editing a React typescript component, if i just hit <TAB>, or create a new line, it indents 4 spaces from the last line. But if I highlight the region and hit <TAB> then it seems to indent based on LSP rules and indents it by 2.
 The same is true when I'm in C++ mode. While writing, and hitting tab when I'm on the line, I get the following header:
 #pragma once namespace some_name_space { class SomeClass { public: SomeClass() private: int someMember; } } 
 But if I highlight the buffer and hit <TAB>, or call lsp-format-region, then I end up with:
 #pragma once namespace some_name_space { class SomeClass { public: SomeClass(); private: int someMember; } } // namespace some_name_space 
 Which i assume is different because when I do that, it's calling clang-format (based on the fact that the endspace ending comment get added.)
 Is there a way to make it so that indentations will use lsp to formatting rules if lsp mode is enabled?

 I am attempting to parse a NATS protocol message. I have two variants of the "message" one that indicates a reply subject and one that doesn't.
 With reply:
 MSG target.subject 1 reply.subject 500\r\n
 Without reply:
 MSG target.subject 1 500\r\n
 And now here are my parser functions. The problem I'm having is that no matter what I do, I can _either_ get it to parse the first form or the second form, but I can't get it to properly "fall back" to one or the other.
 pMsgMessage :: Parser ProtocolMessage pMsgMessage = do msgMessageWithReply <|> msgMessageWithoutReply msgMessageWithReply :: Parser ProtocolMessage msgMessageWithReply = do _ <- string "MSG" space1 subject <- validSubject space1 sid <- integer space1 reply <- validSubject space1 len <- integer _ <- crlf return $ MsgMessage subject (Just reply) sid len msgMessageWithoutReply :: Parser ProtocolMessage msgMessageWithoutReply = do _ <- string "MSG" space1 subject <- validSubject space1 sid <- integer space1 len <- integer _ <- crlf return $ MsgMessage subject Nothing sid len 
 If I change the order in which I check for alternatives, then I change which one I can parse and which one produces an error:
 ghci> parseTest parseMessage "MSG this.subject 1 120\r\n" 2:1: | 2 | <empty line> | ^ unexpected end of input expecting numeric character or white space 
 I'm sure I've just forgotten something dumb, but I can't for the life of me get these alternatives working and I've re-read "the" megaparsec tutorial over and over until it hurt.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 I'm trying to learn `haxl` library with servant. I'm having a custom reader monad stack which contains `Env`. Right now, I am using `runHaxl` function in the handler function to fetch the data. Something like this:
  
fetchUsersH :: (MonadIO m) => AppT m [Int] [User]
 fetchUsersH = do
 (env0 :: Env () [Int]) <- asks haxlEnv
 liftIO $ runHaxl env0 (dataFetch FetchUsers)
  
I saw a github code where scotty was being used, where the GenHaxl was added in the monad stack. Link of the scotty-haxl code
  
addTimeline :: (HasPSQL u, HasOtherEnv Cache u) => String -> ID -> GenHaxl u w ID
 addTimeline name aid =
 unCacheArticle aid $ unCacheCount ("timeline:" ++ name) $ RawAPI.addTimeline name aid
  
And it was getting converted into IO like this:
  
scottyOptsT opts (runIO u state) $ application [logStdout]
 where runIO :: (HasPSQL u, HasOtherEnv C.Cache u) => u -> StateStore -> GenHaxl u w b -> IO b
 runIO env s m = do
 env0 <- initEnv s env
 runHaxl env0 m
  
I want to do similar thing with servant, but I didn't find any example.
 Also, I want to know what would be the best practice for handling haxl
 data fetching? getting the env from the reader and calling runHaxl within
 the handler function or runHaxl should be called at the `hoistServer` level?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi folks,
 I've been searching for a package that enables the simple "one tab per project" workflow, so each project is isolated in its tab.
 I used tabspaces for some time but I faced several issues with it. Then, I switched to the more lightweight project-tab-groups which creates a "tab group" per project, but with some limitations. The latter was simple enough to inspire me to create the package I'm looking for, one-tab-per-project (or otpp).
 The idea is simple, install the package and its dependency unique-dir-name (another package of mine, created specifically for otpp), enable otpp-mode and you are good to go. Whenever you switched to a project project-switch-project (C-x p p), otpp will switch to a dedicated tab. And in case of conflicting projects names, otpp will resolve the conflict by renaming the similar tabs.

Looking for your feedback!

 Pulled down homebrew, then emacs, and...I'm just flummoxed.
 I'm about 40 years used to "alt/control" on both sides of the space bar being "meta/ctrl". 
 How? Can I remap those for use with emacs? I naively thought I could just "describe-key" to see what it thought those were natively, then reassign them in .emacs, but...no go.
 Point me, Obi Wan, to TFM that I may R it.
 Thanks.

 How can I reach that behaviour for my function?
 It is a pseudo haskell code

 So a, b, ..., n are different types I need runC to be polymorphic like this

I have looked in the manual but all I could find was an eval in frame command, which is annoying for extensive probing.

 In my opinion, the best book for beginners is "Get Programming with Haskell" by Will Knut. Although it is a somewhat older book, it is written and structured in a much more comprehensible way than "Lern you a Haskell", for example, which I didn't get on with at all. Haskell in Depth" was also not a suitable introduction for me.
 Which book was the best introduction for you?

 In Haskell report 2010, section 1.3, it says: "An expression evaluates to a value and has a static type." In chapter 3, functions are not listed as expressions, only function applications. In section 4.4.3.1 it says: "A function binding binds a variable to a function value."
 If I understand correctly, a function is a value, therefore an expression. So why functions are not classified as expressions?

 You can open any media file (audio or video) from dired and start playing. With repeat turned on, it’ll keep playing all files in directory and loop over.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello emacs fellas.
 This is my second attempt at trying to switch to emacs. First time I tried System Crafters' emacs from scratch series, and it is good, but I just find navigating through his video playlist a bit too long and inconvenient, and because of that I could not find myself finishing that playlist.
 Are there any text oriented guides with a thorough explanation with something like code snippets and such if possible, to read through and end up with a reasonably good config to start the journey? It would also be good to see something like that but for elisp, once I get a good emacs config rolling.
 Many thanks for those who respond.
 EDIT: I came from vim environment, and it would be nice if a resource acommodated that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We used to have the language extensions OverlappingInstances and IncoherentInstances, and now they've been deprecated (but not removed) in favor of per-instance pragmas like
 instance {-# OVERLAPPING #-} Foo a => Foo [a] where ... 
 Could we do the same with UndecidableInstances, like
 instance {-# UNDECIDABLE #-} Foo a => Bar a where ... 
 ? That seems like it would be a small but significant improvement to me. I don't see any downsides or fundamental obstacles to doing it, but maybe I'm missing something.
 If it can be done, I'd have some interest in writing up a GHC proposal and if it gets accepted trying to implement it myself. I weakly guess I'd be able to do that mostly independently.
 (There's a similar question for UndecidableSuperClasses and maybe it would make sense to do them both at once? But I use that less often so my vague inclination is to keep scope small.)
