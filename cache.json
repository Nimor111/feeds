(In fact, they should mostly work even on text-only browsers.)\n Most \"single page apps\" (SPAs) could easily be ordinary websites that mostly work without JS enabled.\n Most SPAs therefore suck (because of the fact that they are SPAs to begin with).\n Calling Haskell functions it not possible from the standard JS/DOM on an ad-hoc basis, is it? (Only in this way is it possible to enrich a website that mostly works without JS enabled, with certain features in cases where JS is enabled.) Note: Rumors of one or two individuals doing it with some obscure trickery does not count. It should be supported by the ecosystem as a fully fledged feature.\n Therefore, you are confined to SPAs when using Haskell/JS.\n Therefore, Haskell is simply not a suitable language for web development in general and that's just the way it is. (Apps that are legitimately SPAs only are a rare minority and that's not what I'm talking about here.)\n This is precisely where PureScript shines.\n  \nSomeone please debunk the above, because I really would love to be wrong so I could use Haskell for everything.\n    submitted by    /u/NixOverSlicedBread  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi /r/haskell. Almost ten years ago, I wrote a version of the boardgame Yinsh in Haskell. The project included a web-based frontend and a backend for the computer opponent. Everything was running just fine (on my website) until a few weeks ago when Heroku shut down its free tier, where I was hosting the backend.\n Since then, I made multiple unsuccessful attempts to resurrect the game somehow (for example: compiling either the frontend or the backend). The main problem is that I have been developing in other programming languages and ecosystems since then and I'm not familiar with the modern Haskell stack anymore. But it would be sad to rewrite the project in another language. Haskell was actually a really nice fit for this project.\n Back then, I was using Haste to compile Haskell to JavaScript for the frontend part. But now I fail to properly restore the environment to make the hastec call work. Also, I'm not sure if Haste is still actively maintained.\n The backend was 'plain' Haskell, but I have trouble setting up an environment where I can use ghc to compile the backend. I have an old .cabal file that I was apparently using to deploy the backend to Heroku, but it seems that too many things have changed since then.\n I could probably try harder to restore that old state somehow, but I think what the project really needs is some kind of ecosystem modernization. I would be very glad to hear your suggestions on how to move on. If someone is interested in the project itself, I would also love to take contributions on https://github.com/sharkdp/yinsh.\n Yinsh, by the way, is a really fun abstract board game (two player, zero sum, perfect information) which is similar to Gomoku/\"Five-in-a-row\". As far as I know, there is no other implementation of Yinsh out there that features an 'AI' opponent (my implementation uses a classical minimax-style search in the game tree).\n    submitted by    /u/sharkdp  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi all\n As my previous post stated, I am in the process of learning Haskell (mainly from learnyouahaskell.com at the moment).\n I've played around with folds a little in the past when learning Scala, and the learnyouahaskell site is currently introducing them.\n One example it gives is an implementation of the elem function (omitting type declaration):\n  elem' y ys = foldl (\\acc x -> if x == y then True else acc) False ys \n I have implemented it as a pattern matching function (whether from a previous example on the site or just to try it I can't remember):\n  elem' _ [] = False elem' e (x:xs) | e == x = True | otherwise = e `elem'` xs \n I can understand the foldl version no problem, but my question is regarding performance on large lists. Is the foldl version a worse performer if there exists a matching element early in a long list?\n Would it run forever on an infinite list?\n The pattern matching version obviously terminates as soon as it hits a matching element. But the foldl version appears to just \"note\" that there exists an element, but continue checking the rest of the list anyway.\n I understand this is just an example to understand how folds work, and behind the scenes is probably not how the elem function is implemented. I just want to make sure my understanding is correct regarding this fold example. That is, that there is no way to terminate the fold process early.\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/porl  \n [link]   [comments]",

So I'll resume it as:\n I have this constructor:\n data Fruit = Apple {quantity :: Int, price :: Double} | Banana {quantity :: Int, price :: Double} | Grapes {quantity :: Int, price :: Double} \n I have this list of lists:\n [[\"apple\", \"2\", \"1.50\"], [\"banana\", \"5\", \"2.15\"], [\"grapes\", \"4\", \"1.00\"]] \n I'm trying to build a function that iterates through the list of lists and that leverages the constructor above to access the second and third item in order to compute a total:\n total :: [[String]] -> [[Double]] \n The result would be a list of lists of doubles:\n [[3.00], [10.75], [4.00]] \n Questions\n Is something like this below valid or am I going in the wrong direction and should use instead some list comprehension or the map function, etc ?\n Notes:\n  \nqty = quantity\n p = price\n I assume I'll have to convert my list of lists to match the constructor types, or change my constructor to all String, and then convert right before computing numbers.\n  \nWhat I want it to do:\n  \nGrab first list.\n If \"apple\" is in the first list, then use getters to access the quantity and price.\n Call some function to compute the two numbers and add the result to first list of lists.\n Recursive call on the rest, which should be the next to lists with banana and grapes\n  \n​\n total :: [[String]] -> [[Double]] total (x : xs) | \"apple\" 'elem' x = computeFunction(qty, p) : total(xs) | \"banana\" 'elem' x = computeFunction(qty, p) : total(xs) | \"grapes\" 'elem' x = computeFunction(qty, p) : total(xs) \n Something like this behavior --> [3.00] : [10.75] : [4.00] : []\n ​\n Thank you\n    submitted by    /u/LeCapitaine007  \n [link]   [comments]",

I understand that this puts me in mathematical domain (I did some intermediate maths in my higher college but mostly centered around physics - calculus, linear algebra, etc.).\n After endlessly trying to search for right starting point, I found myself stuck in Discrete Mathematics, Lambda Calculus, Set Theory, Category Theory and Abstract Algebra. I am vaguely familiar with these branches but absolutely have no clue how they or which one connects the dots with Haskell. I saw some introductory category theory video but it is just too abstract to understand at this stage.\n To reiterate, the goal is to get better understanding of Haskell concepts from more theoretical perspective and build a better mental model.

It works fine, but I'm not a Haskell expert, and I'm wondering how others would do it. So, how would you write this and/or do you have any comments on my code?

I'm still learning. \n I think I understood what a monad is, even that knowledge helped me in oop way of programming. And now I'm learning about monad transformers. I have read a few blogs and pages about them but they are still not that clear to me. \n Could anyone please explain those to me? Maybe with examples or comparisons to oop. \n Because such questions always have answers out there but they are usually either so high level therefore only the ones who have experience in the field can understand or so basic examples and information that no one can properly understand the \"needs\" and the importance of it so it becomes useless.

          "description": "I have been attempting to define two sum types and then compose them into a single type. I view this operation as defining two type constructors, each with a set of data constructors of cardinality greater than one, and attempting to form a new set that is their union. I thought this would be fairly straightforward.\n Here is a distilled version of my attempt:\n data As = A1 | A2 | A3 data Bs = B1 | B2 | B3 type A = As type B = Bs \n And then, despite the appearance of various syntactic innovations, I've had no success. Essentially, I'd like to do something of the sort: type C = A | B, but that does not work.\n So my questions are:\n  \nIf there is a way to properly do this, how to do so?\n \nIf there is not -- why not? Haskell is very well thought out and so there must be some reason for disallowing such action. Perhaps it's not so much that the action is itself problematic, but that it would interfere with other language semantics. In any case, I'm curious what the reason is. \n \n Edited: As an aside: the project I'm working on involves parsing. As such, I wanted to create a simple parse tree for a basic 'arithmetic grammar', as in \"3 + 2 - 5\", etc. To start off, I wanted to create a binary tree and within that tree I wanted the nodes to be able to hold types that were either binary operations or numbers. I don't think this is optimal, but it was what was driving the original attempt. The project is in large part for learning as well. So upon trying to do something like: type NodeVal = Op | Val, errors arise. I'm adding this aside for some context.\n Thank you.\n    submitted by    /u/Ellipsoider  \n [link]   [comments]",

I think I figured it out, but I need confirmation from actual qualified people:\n  \nWe have the category of endofunctors, which in the context of Set/Hask are just all functors (because we’re limited to a single category).\n For any m <= Monad m, we take all morphisms of type Identity a -> m b (natural transformations between functors Identity and m) and make them a separate category.\n That category is a monoid, with (<>) = (>=>) :: (Identity a -> m b) -> (Identity b -> m c) -> Identity a -> m c (Kleisli composition), and mempty = return :: (Identity a) -> m a, where the Identity monad is simply elided for out convenience.\n  \nDid I get it all right?

Is there some killer feature of HLS that I'm missing?\n tbh, most of what I'd want out of HLS can already be got from ghci (using the :type-at and :loc-at commands), so I'm thinking of writing a small Vim plugin to hook ghci into Vim similar to what Intero did.\n    submitted by    /u/phlummox  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi\n So one year ago I started learning Scala. Because it's a challenge and also because I want to get to know functional programming without hopping immediately into something like Haskell. Keep in mind that my current job and all my skills are within full-stack typescript development. So Scala is definitely something else and that's also why I am so intrigued by the language. \n But now my question is, I kinda want to move away from typescript and go the Scala way. Because I think Scala has much bigger problems to solve and the language is more mature (also because of pay).\n I am hoping to do this one year from now. I am currently learning Cats and have been reading a lot after my working hours. I recently purchased \"The definitive guide\" for Spark, in order to maybe spark an interest in data engineering (see what I did there).\n A lot of co-workers look weird at me when I say I have been learning scala. And they ask me why. And they think it's a waste of time (because \"java is bad\")\n I have been looking at jobs, and I don't see a lot of remote junior scala positions (I will be working from Belgium). As I don't have any JVM experience, I do have a passion for learning. Does this seem possible to all of you or is this a stupid idea? \n Nevertheless, learning this language has never been a stupid idea since it has taught me so much.\n But just wanna get an opinion from some of the pros.\n    submitted by    /u/FuzzCod  \n [link]   [comments]",

I tried to setup a basic environment project: I've installed metals as a vscode extensions, and I've installed scala and sbt from coursier like official scala docs. \n Metals create lot of directories which I don't know what the are used for. Sbt also do that when creating a project with it. It was a bit overwhelming, so I just flush those and tried to start with the simplest dev environment I could get. \n Well, I couldn't resolve a single custom package, so I just reset the regular way metals and sbt wanted it to be. Still can't resolve custom packages, unless the file is at the project root. \n Is it \"normal\" to feel lost with the dev environment, or am I missing some point ?

          "description": "Lately, I have been thinking of playing with desktop GUI in Scala (I know that \"desktop is dead\", but I am not a fan of Electron and have always been fond of reading about native GUI, so I want to try it out). There are already tools like Skija and JWM which provide a good starting point, but I miss an important feature that a GUI framework should have: the ability to hot reload code, so changes can be seen on the screen quickly.\n I have come across three alternatives so far:\n  \nGoing with a markup language: I could create my own XML-like language or use a template engine to parse the UI and generate components. This approach is used by Gtk, WPF, JavaFX, Avalonia, and others. While this solution is good for simple projects, it becomes annoying for more complex UIs that need to be dynamic. It also seems burdensome to connect all events and signals.\n \nEmbedding an interpreted language, like Graal-js and interoperating with Scala for non-UI code. The downside of this approach is that most of the code would likely be written in JavaScript, kind of defeating the purpose of having a Scala GUI.\n \nJoining forces with other projects like HumbleUI, which already achieves this goal, and bridging them to Scala. The downside again is that HumbleUI is written in Clojure, not Scala. I like the idea of contributing to the success of other projects, but I am not sure if most people will want to deal with a Lisp.\n \n I am wondering how I can achieve this feature. Is a Scalajs-Graaljs-Scala combo worth the complexity? Should I go with a templating engine? Would it be possible to do some Scala hot reloading of the view with Ammonite, and if so, how? Are there any other ways I am missing? I have been asking myself these questions for some time now, but I cannot find the answers on my own.\n Maybe I am spoiled by web development, and hot reloading is not that necessary. What would you like to see in a modern GUI framework to make desktop apps that can compete with Electron ones?\n    submitted by    /u/jmcavanillas  \n [link]   [comments]",

I am hoping this thread be a transparent forum for us to set the agenda going forward, and offer some suggestions to get the discussion going:\n - Let’s not re-invent the wheel. I propose we start with Ensime:TNG. This project is the seminal work of one of the most respected men in our community. The obvious alternative would be Metals, but let’s be real: Metals has made their bed with Scala Center, and Scala Center has proven to value Political Correctness over Commercial Success.\n - Minimize Distractions and Getting Stuff Done. I propose after this thread conclude we band together under a private github organization. This will prevent bad-faith actors from sabotaging our work, and it will protect you from being canceled for being a collaborator. I have already squatted some github orgs and domain names that could be used. Since I am the owner of these I will obviously benevolently administrate them.\n - Market the IDE. I’ve offered enough suggestions and I HATE marketing. Maybe others have an idea about how we do this. Perhaps a conference CFP? Does anyone know of any conferences happening later this year that will soon be accepting proposals?\n Looking forward to a fearless future with a grade “A” Scala IDE, long live Scala!\n    submitted by    /u/ScalaFoundation  \n [link]   [comments]",

As we get closer to the new (Australian) academic year, my focus tends to shift from updating the library to updating my educational sites / OERs that use it. So, it will probably make sense to give this version the 0.3.0 moniker as several sites with materials will move to it.\n The most noticeable change is that DeckBuilder and Challenge are now in the doctacular package. Rather than having to, somewhat undocumented, import veautiful.templates.\n Some additional methods were also added to make it very quick to write and publish a single slide deck (e.g. from a scala-cli script). Roughly\n import com.wbillingsley.veautiful.html.* import com.wbillingsley.veautiful.doctacular.* import installers.* val root = mountToBody(<.p(\"loading\")) given root.installMarked() DeckBuilder(1920, 1080) .markdownSlides(\"*Markdown text*\") .veautifulSlide(<.div(\"Some components\")) .mountToRoot(root) \n Naturally, you can also install marked via webpack or any other means (as many of my sites do), but root.installMarked() which is available as an extension method in doctacular.installers provides a very short way to get a markdown parser in if you're just trying to publish a single deck from a script.\n Release notes here https://github.com/wbillingsley/veautiful/releases/tag/v0.3-M6\n API docs are on javadoc.io\n Documentation on https://www.wbillingsley.com/veautiful/ is slowly improving.\n Another example of something built with Veautiful is also up: the hour of code session run as part of the \"Science Experience\" outreach in Armidale on Jan 18th. Go on, see if you can win at Cards of Doom, or land your lander on the Moon.\n https://www.wbillingsley.com/lavamaze/#/challenges/snobot-lava-maze\n    submitted by    /u/lecturerIncognito  \n [link]   [comments]",

The idea of Scala's partial function/currying should hold here (i.e. when applying a single value x_i, return a function that is defined only for a subset of its input domain). For example, when n = 2 define f(x, y) = sin(x + y), then trivially, f(2, y) = sin(2 + y).\n  \nHowever, the dimension (n > 0) may vary from case to case and may even be provided in input. Partial application for n = 2 is:\n def leftPartialFunction(f: (Double, Double) => Double)(x: Double): Double => Double = f(x, _) \n but how can this be generalized for arbitrary n?\n For example, how can I apply the function in position i?Something like this I assume would not work ...\n def partialFunction(f: IndexedSeq[Double] => Double)(xi: Double): IndexedSeq[Double] => Double = .... // cannot work well with indexed seq as they are not \"disjoint\" \n ​\n    submitted by    /u/dns281784  \n [link]   [comments]",

I would envision my requirement being met if the slick abstractions would be mixins, and my class StorableCoffee would extend Coffee and mix into itself the storage features from slick.\n Then I would be able to pass into the domain model StorableCoffee, but to the model that would just be a Coffee.\n So since I've never coded in scala, my questions are:\n  \nis it possible to achieve my goal without convoluted scala3 artifacts and slick or another library?\n if not, what are the possible hacks I could employ?\n  \n   submitted by    /u/flavius-as  \n [link]   [comments]",

As of version 9.5.5 this is working fine for me, as it always has. \n However, I remember a discussion on the Org developer list some months back that the developers planned to remove this feature at some point in the future. I cannot, however, locate the thread where I read that. A search of this Reddit forum does not mention this matter either. \n So, I thought I'd ask specifically: Is it true that the Agenda is going to lose its ability to act upon active timestamps in the :PROPERTIES: drawer?\n If true, that would be very unfortunate for me. But I want to be prepared if it happens. I see nothing about this matter in the Release Notes for Org 9.6, so I surmise it's safe for me to upgrade -- for now. \n Many thanks for reading, and to all the Org developers for Org mode, which is a work of genius.\n    submitted by    /u/tdavey  \n [link]   [comments]",

These headings are spread across files, and may even be children of each other.\n What I’d like is the ability to add headings to a group (possibly named) and then be able to either switch between them (like ido-switch-buffer) or open up all of them at once (in indirect buffers), or search within just those headings.\n You could go through and tag all of the headings, but this seems cumbersome, and it feels wrong to modify the heading rather than just pointing to it.\n All of my headings have ids, so I’m not worried about ambiguous references.\n I’ve seen packages that work in similar ways for collections of files, or buffers.

I'm focused right now on transferring my literature notes, which are notes on one article, book, or chapter. Should I use properties instead of tags? \n Would anyone be willing to share how they structure their literature notes (or anything similar)?

          "description": "Nothing but anecdotal data, but when a newcomer is faced with a choice between Emacs or Vscode, they will very likely choose Vscode, one of the reasons being that Emacs has a rightful reputation of having a steep learning curve. The idea of having to install a dozen packages to get modern IDE-like features and write Elisp right away in order to customize them can be daunting and overwhelming. Personally, it took me a couple of years before I even bothered to start learning Elisp to become a more advanced user.\n By providing a more streamlined and user-friendly way to customize Emacs, we can help make the platform more approachable and welcoming to new users.\n One approach could be to provide a series of customizable templates or configurations that new users could choose from when first setting up Emacs. These templates could be designed for different use cases (e.g., programming, writing, project management, etc.), and could include pre-installed packages, keybindings, and other customizations that are tailored to the user's needs. This would allow new users to get started with a powerful and customized Emacs setup without having to dive too deeply into the details of Elisp code.\n Another approach could be to provide a more user-friendly interface for customizing Emacs, such as a graphical user interface (GUI) or a set of interactive prompts that guide users through the customization process. This would make it easier for users to discover and experiment with different customization options, and would help them feel more confident and in control of their Emacs setup.\n I think we need to put some work and effort on this.\n    submitted by    /u/80286  \n [link]   [comments]",

This means a Babel, in order to be useful, must be able in one code block to add new facts to the REPL, then give answers to a code block acting as a query. Just the normal prolog-mode will only allow you to write out a database of facts in a buffer, then pose the queries in the the running REPL -- not both together.

These are all that google finds for me, given a range of search terms about lightweight emacs.\n  \nQ: Does there exist a true emacs (not work-alike) distribution that is made lighter through the separation of formerly default package into add-on libraries? For example, for my usecase, terminal-only core with python and comint and shell modes would be all I need, so I'd like to apt-get install emacs-core emacs-shell emacs-python and avoid all org-mode, mail, gnus, ... and also the graphical UI code.\n    submitted by    /u/jojohohanon  \n [link]   [comments]",

I love vim keybindings, but emacs is not just a text editor, and that's kind of the appeal of it, and emacs is built around its own keybindings, so trying to force vim ones on it just makes a mess really...\n So how usable is emacs as a text editor with the default ones? Having to reach for control all the time sounds annoying, although I guess I could replace caps lock for control, since that's far more reachable. How fast are you editing text with it?

          "description": "Over the last couple weeks while putting the treesit-auto package together it gained adoption much faster than I had expected. While I'm incredibly happy others found it useful, that also means that many assumptions in my hacky code were quickly blown apart. Also, in no small part due to my poor documentation, it was confusing to figure out exactly how/what would be supported when trying to add a new language.\n The key learning since I first tried to launch this package is that there's no reason for the grammar name in grammar.js to match the Emacs major mode, and there's a possibility that there are many \"fallback\" modes that should upgrade to the tree-sitter version, rather than just one. For these reasons and more, I needed to adjust the structure of how these modes are described internally alongside their grammars. As a consequence to that, some of the public functions/variables have been changed or removed. \n I am sorry to anyone who has already picked up the package and started tweaking it. However, I think the changes will make the package more maintainable down the line, and it’s better to do this sooner rather than later. Most folks will probably not notice a difference if all you have set is treesit-auto-install and global-treesit-auto-mode. \n Hopefully this is the last post I will need/want to to make about the package!\n TL;DR\n treesit-auto-fallback-alist no longer has any affect. If you want another language to be supported by treesit-auto, there is now a guide for contributing recipes\n    submitted by    /u/renzmann  \n [link]   [comments]",

I did run into something today that was a puzzle--I knew I'd taken a note on a topic, couldn't find it easily and didn't have access to my home machine. My thought: I'd be fine if I could search everything for the word 'awk'.\n I'm thinking the following would be elegant:\n  \nIndex the notes generated by org-publish using sqlite's FTS5 capability.\n Add a search field to the generated sitemap.\n Update the publishing script to copy the indexed database along with the notes.\n Write a CGI to handle the searches and link to search results.\n  \nMinus the CGI part it was stupidly easy to get indexing with stemming working:\n #!/bin/sh sqlite3 t.db<<EOF CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE notes USING FTS5(title, body, tokenize=porter); EOF for file in $(ls *html | grep -v sitemap) do data=$(cat $file | sed \"s/'/''/g\") sqlite3 t.db<<EOF INSERT INTO notes(title, body) VALUES('$file','$data'); EOF done \n I did run into one ugly that I need an elegant idea to help solve--indexing the generated HTML leads to poor search results (e.g. searching for `awk' finds every note due to the export language boilerplate). I've had the following thoughts:\n  \nindex the org files. Downside: this will pickup the #* lines which works poorly for some searches (e.g. session).\n use an HTML parser (e.g. Beautiful Soup) and carve content out of the generated files. Intuitively, this seems like it would be brittle.\n publish to text as well, index those and associate the results with its HTML counterpart.\n use some combinations of org-export filters to index the content.\n  \nAs an aside, I realize there are services for this but there's no fun in that.\n    submitted by    /u/fragbot2  \n [link]   [comments]",

I've found the minibuffer-line-mode package and this displays my global-mode-string in the minibuffer area, which is great in 95% of the time. However, sometimes there is important information displayed in the minibuffer that is too fast overridden by minibuffer-line-mode. The cases are rare enough, that I don't have an example right now. But when it happens, it's super annoying.\n So using the minibuffer is maybe not the best option here. So I'm wondering if it's possible to display global-mode-string right-aligned in the menu bar?

I'm just never getting past the early pain and I'd like something with more menus and more mouse driven support, but still all the features and extensibility of Emacs.\n I'm not looking to switch from my IDE for the heavier stuff, although that would probably help me get over the learning pain, but I've already done that with the IDE and don't want to give that up.\n I did see mousemacs and I really hoped it would be the solution I was looking for, but it seems a little buggy and actually makes things more complicated to use - not less.\n Can anyone suggest either an Emacs alike that fits my needs or a simple way to setup Emacs in this way?\n Edit: Specifically, what I want to be able to do is much of the every day stuff via menus.

As a matter of fact, the message appears even before that when the region gets expanded to the first non-ASCII character and the later kill-ring-save is failing when kill-new is invoked within its definition.\n Good case: I mark a region like \"foo bar\" and am able to push it into the clipboard by invoking M-w as usual. Perfect. No issue with marking the region or pushing to the clipboard.\n Error case: However, when I try to create a region with \"foo€\" or \"fooä\" or \"fooß\" or \"foo¼\" I get the weird behavior described above as soon as the first non-ASCII character gets added to the region and the clipboard doesn't get any new content pushed to when I do try to kill.\n I'm not sure if this is related: when the region gets defined by pressing C-SPC and then expanded by right-char I also get \"Replaced 0 occurrences\" with every new invocation. This is suspicious as well. Maybe they both are related? \n With emacs -q, there is always normal behavior (good case) without the error message. So it has to be related to my configuration.\n The same configuration using Emacs 27.1 also does not have this weird behavior. \n How can I debug this? Does this sound familiar to you? Do you have an idea what that might cause? \n My config is rather hard to impossible to bi-sect with a sane effort. :-(\n    submitted by    /u/publicvoit  \n [link]   [comments]",

I've got projectile with persp-projectile, and that seems to give me what I need for project navigation (#2 probably, still not 100%). I get some help in my mode line for project focus (#3, partially).\n But I'm rethinking about my approach, as tab-bar-mode would give me nice visual help (#3), and it seems difficult to recover a perspective using perspective, and persp-mode may be a better fit in that sense (#4). The Treemacs integration isn't working for me either, and I get the same list of file trees for all perspectives -- I'm pretty sure I'm doing something stupid, but this was handled nicely with Doom Emacs's workspace support (#5). But perspective seems to work best for segregated buffer list (#1).\n ​\n I would probably have to tweak and customise more to get my setup exactly to my likings, but I'd appreciate if experts here can shed some light into how they manage multiple projects!\n    submitted by    /u/rytswd  \n [link]   [comments]",

However, it doesn't work; I keep getting notifications about new messages in that thread afterwards.\n Is it possible to stop getting notifications about particular threads? If so, how?\n    submitted by    /u/sauntcartas  \n [link]   [comments]",

It loads the .envrc, build the flake input and export. It just looks like the path does not work afterwards.\n So I've configured Emacs to run as a services using services.emacs.enable = true. For my shell I added programs.zsh.shellInit = ''emulate zsh -c \"$(direnv hook zsh)\", but I've also tried eval \"$(direnv hook zsh)\".\n Direnv is installed using the nix-direnv installation instructions under \"Via configuration.nix in NixOS\".I read some recommendations that envrc.el is a better alternative then direnv.el, and after some testing I have to agree.(envrc-global-mode) is enabled in my config. This works perfectly with a normal emacs instance.\n For some reason it just does not seem to work with the emacsclient.Starting emacs --daemon specifically with a emulated zsh shell does not seems to work.Executing envrc-reload and direnv-update-directory-environment also don't seem to solve it.\n I honestly don't know why this does not work. That's also why I'm posting here and not in a github repo, since I'm not sure where the issue is occurring from.

Since then, I've spent some time refining the package, getting it on MELPA, and adding a couple features that I felt were missing. In particular, I wanted Emacs to install and use a grammar as soon as I visit a file that has a tree-sitter version available. treesit-auto 0.3 introduced the treesit-auto-install variable, which can be nil, t, or 'prompt. I like to set it to 'prompt, in case my internet connection isn't great. This is what it looks like when I visit a Rust file without the grammar. If treesit-auto-install is t, it will skip the prompt and install the grammar right away. \n Otherwise, when this variable is nil (the default), it will try to fall back to one of the original major modes, such as python-mode, js-mode, or rust-mode. The exact details on how it finds a fallback are documented in the README on GitHub.\n Thank you to all who have contributed so far!

The said buffer is filled with a Guile script that should write to a file how many tests have been run with a SRFI 64 test suite.\n All of this is part of an ERT test that finally reads from the written file a number to compare to the expected.\n Unfortunately, my script does not seems to write anything to a file.\n If my explanations are not that clear, here is the script I am working on :\n https://framagit.org/Jeko/emacs-srfi64/-/raw/master/srfi64-test.el\n And here is the command line I use to run the ERT test :\n emacs -batch -l ert -l srfi64-test.el -f ert-run-tests-batch-and-exit \n Thank you for anything you could bring to my attention !\n    submitted by    /u/rednosehacker  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I recently switched from Helm to Vertico+Consult+Marginalia, and so far I love almost everything about it. The one thing I really miss is having things set up so that when I execute a command that asks for a file, the completion defaults to a file at point.\n I know I can use M-n or PgDn to get to the next item in future history, which may be the eligible thing at point. But I orchestrate a lot of my work from an org file which has bare filenames in it, and it's handy to be able to do C-x C-f RET and open one of these files. Or C-x g (magit-status) RET and go straight to a git repository listed in the file.\n That said, I always had a little trouble when I tried one of these commands and point was on something I didn't want suggested, and I could never remember how to get back to whatever things would be like if it weren't. So maybe I should just deal with this. But more often than not, immediately suggesting the thing at point is what I want.\n I also tried Embark, and it immediately gave me errors, so I turned it off. Plus, I think I'd like to keep doing this in an action-suggest-enter mode rather than what Embark allows.\n Any suggestions for how to do what I want efficiently?\n    submitted by    /u/michaelhoffman  \n [link]   [comments]",

It’s a false dichotomy. Emacs can do a lot on its own and be combined usefully with other programs. \n run‑command makes the combination convenient through a simple configuration format and an interaction flow that stays out of your way. Instead of reaching for a shell or a specialized major mode, you give run‑command a simple “recipe” and you get a contextual command palette where you can browse, select, and run commands without leaving Emacs.\n  \nDemo:\n https://i.redd.it/aufb2k4q2dfa1.gif\n I use this daily for compilers/linters in watch mode (think npm test:watch, cargo watch -x run, etc), development servers, and some one-off's (e.g. looking up the word at point in wordnet).

That seems awkward.\n Or is it preferable simply to use lazy-completion-table to define a table, and then to define a custom completion function try-my-list which searches that table? Or does that depend on completion.el, which is the wrong thing to use in the textual context of org-mode?\n Basically, I'm confused by the variety of existing autocompletion and template technologies: abbrev, dabbrev, hippie-expand, skeleton, tempel, yasnippet, corfu, cape, etc..

          "description": "For consult users (or the consult curious) minad just added a wonderful new feature to consult: consult-info. I bind it to M-s i. You can choose one or more info manuals to search (comma separated), and then it acts much like consult-grep and friends, searching over the info nodes. \n Really great for quickly peeking at some topic without the usual rigamarole of entering Info. It's also simple to bind a key to a command to go right to searching your most used info nodes.\n If you add embark into the mix, the power amplifies again: you can narrow down to just the search terms you want using the regular consult \"two stage\" filtering (e.g #process#async), then embark-export these live filtered results to a Collections buffer, effectively building your own clickable custom index (or three) for the topic(s) you are investigating.\n Clearly the fastest way to RTFM.

          "description": "I am confused by the Tramp documentation regarding the auto save feature. According to the documentation (emphasis mine):\n  \n4.20 Auto-save, File Lock and Backup configuration \n To avoid TRAMP from saving backup files owned by ‘root’ to locations accessible to others, default backup settings in backup-directory-alist have to be altered. \n Here’s a scenario where files could be inadvertently exposed. Emacs by default writes backup files to the same directory as the original files unless changed to another location, such as ~/.emacs.d/backups/. Such a directory will also be used by default by TRAMP when using, say, a restricted file /su:root@localhost:/etc/secretfile. The backup file of the secretfile is now owned by the user logged in from TRAMP and not ‘root’. \n When backup-directory-alist is nil (the default), such problems do not occur. \n  \nFirst, it states that the default value of backup-directory-alist must be changed to avoid saving root files as a normal user in a local directory.\n But then, it says that it does not happen with the default value.\n When running Emacs (both -q and -Q, master from Dec 4th), it behaves like the first paragraph: when opening a file using su (or remote ssh+su), it warns about writing a local backup and aborts opening if you say no. Therefore, it looks like the last sentence \"When backup-directory-alist is nil (the default), such problems do not occur. \" is wrong.\n Is it actually wrong, or am I misunderstanding it?\n    submitted by    /u/noi-gai  \n [link]   [comments]",

This makes it easier to keep tracks of prompts because you'll always see the prompt associated with every line of output currently visible in the buffer.

I am not a power user of Emacs with C++, but for what I understood LSP with clangd is now pretty mature. Moreover, IIUC, LSP provides code navigation via Emacs' xref.\n Historically the usual way to explore code was using a tag utility, like ctags, etags, rtags or gtags. I've tried searching online, but the resources I found are pretty outdated, and I suspect they are not even aware of LSP.\n So the question is:\n  \nwould you say an external program is still the best way to explore C++'s code on Emacs, or is clangd + xref enough? Is it becoming the de facto standard? Is there something that a tag program can do but clangd can't (or viceversa)?\n \nI have heard that C++ code can be quite difficult to index, due to complex include nests, preprocessor directives and what else (because C++!). Is this problem still relevant in 2023? If yes, what solution handles it best?\n \n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/alessandrobertulli  \n [link]   [comments]",

By default it shows the information in the echo area through eldoc, which is not quite convenient because usually it's far from where the cursor is. A better solution is provided by eldoc-box, which shows information in a child frame, like this.\n As can be seen in the screenshot, the child frame blocks some part of the window. I'm wondering if possible to set the child frame transparent so that I can see the code below. I tried to set eldoc-box-frame-parameters with (alpha . 0.5) but it has no effect. What do I miss?\n Moreover, the eglot shows the information with some formatting. There is a long line separating different kinds of information, which is fine for the echo area, but in the child frame, it is wrapped into several pieces, occupying additional lines. I'm curious if there is a way to change the format. \n Another question which is related is that the documentation is truncated. I'd rather to see a long child frame to show all the information, which is usually possible if there is no redundant things like the wrapped line. I cannot find an option in eglot to turn off the truncation. Is there any solution for this problem?\n Thanks for reading this long post!\n    submitted by    /u/linwaytin  \n [link]   [comments]",

More specifically, I'd like to have a big folder filled with LaTeX files (or org files) that are tagged somehow so I don't have to keep track of them myself. I want to be able to refer to specific theorems/definitions/equations in other files in the system, as I would in LaTeX. And, importantly, I want to be able to produce a nicely formatted PDF from a selection of these files, with all the internal links to equations, definitions etc. working properly. So for example if this semester I'm studying harmonic analysis, I want to produce notes on all the theorems and techniques I pick up, and by the end I should be able to stitch them together in a PDF. If next semester something I'm studying relies on one of those theorems, I want to still be able to point to the corresponding file and again include it in a different PDF. A nice plus would be the ability to smoothly manage citations and references to books, papers etc.\n There are packages in the so-called personal knowledge management ecosystem (org-roam, deft, org-brain, Zetteldeft etc.) that seem to do what I'm looking for. I'd appreciate anyone who's tried out a bunch of them giving their opinion on what makes the most sense to do. If anyone's done something similar, any advice, links or helpful blog posts describing your setup would be very appreciated.\n    submitted by    /u/gerretsen  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "In \"How to Take Smart Notes\", Ahrens states that before you add a slip to your slipbox, you should:\n\"Make sure it can be found from the index; add an entry in the index if necessary or refer to it from a note that is connected to the index.\" (p. 104)\nOriginally, I thought it was just important that no slip gets orphaned and is connected to some thread of notes, but this statement gives me the impression that every slip must be no more than 1 degree of separation away from the Index. But once your slipbox grows a significant amount, this will cause your index to get cluttered, which runs counter to what he says later:\n\"[Keywords in the index] should be chosen carefully and sparsely. Luhmann would add the number of one or two (rarely more) notes next to a keyword in the index.\" (p. 106)\nHow do you interpret this for Zettelkasten? Is it crucial that there's no more than 1 degree of separation from your index? Or is it just important that it's eventually connected (e.g. with potentially 2, 5, 10, or more notes between the Index and the new slip)?",

My first concept is \"Dominated Strategies\". I don't have any slips in my ZK that touch this subject. I use Folgezettel because I like its structure, and my next available number at the \"end\" of my ZK is 35.0.\nShould I:\nNow a few things:\nPlease let me know which option you'd choose and what your thinking is behind why. Thanks!",

I've come up with this note about the difference about the Web and Internet terms and would like some advices on how could I improve it? Maybe I can create specific notes about the definition of Internet and Web and link them? Create a note about the relationship between those two terms? Help me make it better!   \n**Date:** 01/24/2023 (11:21)\n**Tags:** #web #internet\n\n---\n\n# Web and Internet Are Different Terms\n\nIt is common to observe people using the terms _Web_ and _Internet_ in such a way that it appears that both define the same concept: a giant invisible network that interconnects people and realities. However, it is important to understand that both terms have different meanings, although they are connected.\n\nThe Internet is the medium through which all information travels between servers and users. This information, being very general, needed to be contained in standards so that all connected devices could understand and communicate with each other. Therefore, the Internet is made up of applications that exercise this function of regulating communication through protocols.\n\nThe Web is an Internet application. It allows users to interact with servers through websites: interactive pages that allow navigation between files and pages present on the server.\n\n\n## References\n---\nW3Cx. **Introduction to Web Accessibility**: Course Information, Time to practice. edX.\n\nCiriaco, D. **Qual a diferença entre Internet e World Wide Web?** Canaltech.
