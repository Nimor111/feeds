          "description": "One of the things that amazes me about Haskell is the rabbit holes I'm ceaselessly cascading down. For example, what I thought was an innocent question turned out to be my latest rabbit hole, i.e. apparently Haskell doesn't have real recursive types. Apparently, what I thought was a recursive type, e.g.\n data Peano = Zero | Succ Peano \n is not really a recursive type, although I'm not sure why. My previous question about what turned out to be the omega combinator brought up the true nature of Haskell recursive types and the mysterious newtype \"workaround\". So this talks about a real natural number recursive type (as does my previous question)\n MyNat = One :+: MyNat \n MyList a = One :+: (a :*: MyList a)\n I can't truly fathom what's being done/said here, e.g., no idea what is meant first paragraph in by a typed tagless-final interpreter. Simple blind acceptance, which is just hand-waving, isn't my style. And the logic programming course it references is, well, my latest rabbit hole. Can somebody give me some intro material to this whole issue of what really is a recursive type. This all started, BTW, with trying to understand what a type equation meant. Can you guess how many pdfs and web pages I've opened since then? Fazit: Somebody (me?) needs to pull all these threads together into one big Haskell-Omni textbook. The existing beginner texts are too handwavy, IMHO. There's a kiddie version of Haskell and a grownup's version. The kiddie version is pretty much useless, again, IMHO, unless it's to spur you on to the bigger stuff.\n    submitted by    /u/teilchen010  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Sorry for the wall of text, but I've been reading a lot of guides and not really getting the answer I need. If anyone wants to help a complete newcomer, I could really use it.\n I've read some monad tutorials/lectures and I think I have a beginner's understanding. Basically what I took away was \"without unsafePerformIO, which you should not use, Monad types like M a can't be converted to a. Instead you compose your Monad functions with pure functions using operators like <$> or >>=.\" I also think I understand this distinction between \"pure\" and \"monad\" functions helps the haskell compiler be extremely cool.\n That sounds really good, but I'm having trouble understanding how to structure an application around this. I'm trying to teach myself Haskell by writing an interactive fiction game. So far I have an RPG-style dice roller written, but it's deterministic. I'm creating a seed from the system time inside of a do, using the <- operator. I then use (basically) randomRs (_,_) (mkStdGen seed). Because I used do and I wasn't sure what to do after that though, so I tried using unsafePerformIO and I'm almost certain this is why my dice roller rolls the same numbers every time.\n Do I have to make all my roll-processing functions and the entire skill system speak IO Int and pass up and down an updated stdGen? I am pretty sure the answer is \"no,\" since I can use bind to invoke pure functions. But if that's true, I'm not sure how to apply that while designing a whole application.\n I guess what I'm unsure of is how to structure something larger than a few functions around all of this. Does anyone have any favorite guides or wisdom about the big-picture structure of an application written in Haskell?\n    submitted by    /u/fdc_willard  \n [link]   [comments]",

To do so, I intend to prepare a minimal case that reproduces the issue on the compiler version that the GHC developers would most prefer. I'm having trouble doing that though:\n 1) Which is the GHC version that would be the most useful for GHC developers? 8.10.7, the one the majority of the users currently use (me included)? 9.2.1 which is the latest stable release? Or GHC HEAD? \n 2) Unless the answer to (1) above is GHC 8.10.7, what's the easiest way to obtain that GHC version, very preferably without polluting my system globally? I've built GHC HEAD using the great nix-shell provided by https://github.com/alpmestan/ghc.nix, which allowed me to build it without installing any system dependencies globally. But I can't figure out how to run the resulting GHC, I have ./inplace/bin/runghc which I can use to interpret .hs files and I have ./inplace/bin/ghc-stage2, but that one results in a billion linker errors when I try to compile anything. I've also tried installing GHC versions via ghcup, but that one also fails because I think I'm supposed to install some system dependencies, but I really don't like doing that if at all possible.\n It might be a good idea to update the report a bug page in the GHC wiki with this information. This subreddit is probably not the best place to ask these questions, but I'm also not sure where best to engage with the GHC developers.\n Thanks for any pointers!\n    submitted by    /u/enobayram  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello everyone, as a means to learn Haskell I've decided to write a very basic Web3 implementation in it, everything has been great so far but I'm having a really hard time trying to encode integers that are greater than 8 bytes because of the data types. I've come across some useful libraries but settled on using Data.Binary. Here's an example of something I want to do in Elixir:\n ```elixir\n This just gives you a 32 bytes representation of that number\n <<3214000000000000000000::signed-256>>\n  \n<<0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 174, 59,\n  \n53, 195, 127, 137, 120, 0, 0>>\n ```\n On Haskell I've tried and it works with smaller numbers (Whatever fits into Int64), but with bigger ones:\n ```haskell\n B64.encode $ BL.toStrict $ runPut $ putInt64be 3214000000000000000000\n <interactive>:61:48: warning: [-Woverflowed-literals]\n Literal 3214000000000000000000 is out of the Int range -9223372036854775808..9223372036854775807\n \"AAB4iX/DNTs=\"\n ```\n Which does not give me the correct representation since the value is out of bounds (I think the number it sticks with is 4266531174538018816 (maxBound :: Int64) rather than the one I passed)\n ​\n So, I wanted to ask, what are my options to encode these numbers in the same way I can do on the first Elixir example? Is there a technique I'm missing?\n    submitted by    /u/Aguxez  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "During last five years it was twice that I had to figure out how parse JSON in streaming fashion. I figured that I release a library, so I don't have to figure it out again some years in the future. I suspect this library might be useful to others too, since it is likely that I am not the only who ran into such problem. In my particular situation use cases were:\n  \nParse a very large JSON file, contents of which was one very big top level dictionary with millions of key value pairs. My requirement was that I needed to modify each individual key/value pair without affecting memory overheaad.\n Continuously parse an infinite stream of log entries from a service called logentries.com where each entry was formatted as JSON and delimited by a newline.\n  \nconduit-aeson is capable of handling both of these use cases and probably others as well.

And even though there is a wide variety of lens packages (lens, optics, microlens, etc.) such a function is likely to work with most of them.\n This is all preamble to my actual question: how can a library do the same for streams? There are a number of streaming libraries out there (conduit, pipes, streaming, streamly, etc.) and a hypothetical library author would might like to provide streams or stream combinators to users that are compatible with as many of them as possible, but don't explicitly rely on those libraries. Does anyone have any information about what this could look like (assuming its even possible)?\n    submitted by    /u/sccrstud92  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "TL;DR: Game made with apecs and gloss crashes when trying to read input from Nintendo Switch.\n Inspired by this post, I am recreating the Unity 2D tutorial in Haskell using apecs and apecs-gloss. I am nearly done: The graphics are rendered correctly, the levels are generated appropriately, the player responds to keyboard input, etc.\n As an extra, I want to be able to control the game with the Nintendo Switch joy cons. I have successfully connected the joy cons and I'm reading the input in the stepping function (6th argument of play - called periodically) instead of the event handling function (5th argument), as the latter only recognizes keyboard and mouse input. Here is an excerpt of what I'm doing in the step function, the full details of handleSwitch can be seen here (essentially read input if the buttons are pressed when the stepping function is called, interpret the input and update the scene).\n stepGame :: Float -> C.System' () stepGame dT = do ... ASTM.forkSys (Switch.handleSwitch dT) ... \n Unfortunately, the player may respond to the first few inputs but then the game crashes. I thought it was a race hazard so I wrapped handleSwitch in forkSys (creates a new thread for switch input) but the issue persists.\n Any ideas on what might be going wrong and how to fix this?

I then proceeded to create an 'hello world' project - - stack downloaded GHC 8.10 and created a cabal file (very confused between cabal and stack differences but, I'll go with the flow). \n The machine behaves well with other programing platforms. however, with Haskell/stack it seems very slow... I'm running stack build and stack test and it takes up to 1 minute in both cases if there is any change to compile (without recompilation, still takes about 30 secs).\n Was just wondering if this slowness is expected? I remember using it on a Ubuntu machine and didn't notice it being so slow. Maybe it has to do with the underlying C compiler arch?\n (edit: formatting)\n    submitted by    /u/JustADirtyLurker  \n [link]   [comments]",

We have tests for lib now (with lib listed under test `dependencies:`), and exe depends on lib in the same way, but there is an aspect of the exe I'd like to test.\n I have tried to use `verbatim` in my package.yaml to get hpack to pass along `build-tool-depends`:, which should allow me to reference a `project:executable`. I do see it does include it at the bottom of that `test-suite` in the generated Cabal output, but I still get a `Could not find module` in the test file itself (what I am importing there is listed in the `executable` section `other-modules:`) when running `stack test`.\n I have also tried referencing the exe in the new test with `build-tools:`. It makes it into the cabal file, but without the project name prefix I originally included, and does not seem to help either.\n Any possible things I am missing or should try instead? It generates a cabal file with what I thought should work, but it does not seem to be exposing the module I am trying to import from exe in the test. Thanks so much! \n Versions: * Stack resolver: lts-18.15 * Cabal: Cabal-3.2.1.0 * Running on a M1 Mac 12.1 in a Rosetta terminal (should not be ARM related, as it builds/tests just fine without the above attempt, just giving for context)\n ==== QUOTE END ====\n Remark from me (u/Martinsos): We also read that one solution is to move all the exe code to the lib and then exe just becomes an extremely thin wrapper. However, I love having this separation between exe and lib, on one hand to make sure that lib doesn't in any way depend on exe, and also because external/hackage dependencies are nicely separated, so I would rather avoid that if there is a nicer way to do it.\n    submitted by    /u/Martinsos  \n [link]   [comments]",

Can anyone offer any suggestions, or suggest other forums to ask?\n I note that opt is definitely in the path:  % which opt /opt/homebrew/opt/llvm/bin/opt \n    submitted by    /u/rifasaurous  \n [link]   [comments]",

So then i tried to cabal install gloss but it outputs the following error message:\n cabal: Missing dependency on a foreign library: * Missing (or bad) C library: GL This problem can usually be solved by installing the system package that provides this library (you may need the \"-dev\" version). If the library is already installed but in a non-standard location then you can use the flags --extra-include-dirs= and --extra-lib-dirs= to specify where it is.If the library file does exist, it may contain errors that are caught by the C compiler at the preprocessing stage. In this case you can re-run configure with the verbosity flag -v3 to see the error messages. cabal: Failed to build OpenGLRaw-3.3.4.1 (which is required by gloss-1.13.2.1). See the build log above for details. \n So naturally i tried to install the library with cabal, OpenGlRaw but that gave the same error message except the gloss part. I tried to find information about this library but couldn't find anything useful for me, I am using nixos but the error appears on a secondary computer with fedora as well. I have opengl installed through my NixOS configuration and i have tried several c compilers or other openGL packages. This may not have to do with haskell but i assume i will get just as much help here as on r/NixOS \n I am glad for anyone taking their time to help me.\n    submitted by    /u/The_Ek_  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "List comprehension is a very appealing feature in Haskell. It could support a form of non-deterministic computation. \n For example,\n  [[x,y] | x <- [0..2], y <- [10..12]] -- [[0,10],[0,11],[0,12], -- [1,10],[1,11],[1,12], -- [2,10],[2,11],[2,12]] \n However, this construct is too static. I mean that these two generators (x <- [0..2] and y <- [0..2]) are solidified in the code. If the number of generators is unknown (e.g. List of generators as input), there is no way to use the List comprehension gracefully. \n One way to solve the problem is using Traversable:\n  sequenceA [[0..2], [10..12]] -- [[0,10],[0,11],[0,12], -- [1,10],[1,11],[1,12], -- [2,10],[2,11],[2,12]] \n Now we have a List of generators. So far so good.\n The drawback of this approach is that it cannot handle the variables' references in a generator's body.\n For example, \n  [[x,y] | x <- [0..2], y <- [10*x..10*x+2]] \n We cannot represent [10*x..10*x+2] in sequenceA.\n Question:\n Is there any general way to do this job in Haskell? Maybe something like sequenceA, but can handle variables' references. Or do we have to write a small interpreter?\n Thanks\n  \nEdit:\n Some one possibly misunderstand my question.\n For example, if we just using List comprehension (or do-notation), how do we represent the following pattern in general way?\n ``` [[x1] | x1 <- [0..2]]\n [[x1,x2] | x1 <- [0..2], x2 <- [10x1..10x1+2]]\n [[x1,x2,x3] | x1 <- [0..2], x2 <- [10x1..10x1+2], x3 <- [100x2..100x2+2]]\n [[x1,x2,x3,x4] | x1 <- [0..2], x2 <- [10x1..10x1+2], x3 <- [100x2..100x2+2], x4 <- [1000x3..1000x3+2]]\n -- and so on ```\n It could be solved by code generation and interpreter pattern, but I hope a better way.

I work as a professional programmer and do Python all day long.\n I started the \"Learn you a Haskell\" book to tease my brain and learn to approach problems from a different angle. And I have learned a lot and I think my Python code has benefited from it.\n But I got stuck at the Monad chapter and lost interest. But it's still in the back of my mind to get back to it.\n However, the biggest roadblock I am facing is that I can't seem to find something useful to do with Haskell. Probably due to the lack of my knowledge/experience in that language.\n But I can't bring myself to write Haskell at work as I would be the only one being able to maintain the code (no other Haskellers around).\n So I am turning to you folks: Do you have any ideas of writing something that will end up being something useful? Maybe some starters for implementing a HTTP/REST layer between a JS-Frontend and a database? Or something else I would love to play around with (but I'm not sure whether it's even possible): Writing a Python extension in Haskell, or, if that's not doable, a .so shared library which could be called from other code so I could use Python's ctypes module (not sure if that is even possible either).\n Any ideas?

          "description": "Hey all. I'm a Haskell dev, but I use Kotlin in my day job. \n For those not familiar, Jetpack Compose is a compiler plugin for Kotlin which allows for a declarative React/VDOM style of UI programming by composing so-called \"composable functions\" (which is funny to me as a Haskell dev, because what is a function if not composable?) to build up the UI.\n The kicker is, at compile-time, these composable functions are eliminated -- and (as I understand it) compiled to some imperative code that updates the UI appropriately in a reactive manner as it's inputs change.\n Svelte works similarly, but for JavaScript.\n So in other words, you get something that looks a lot like a VDOM/React style UI -- but without the overhead of an actual VDOM!\n This is a fascinating idea to me, and I'd love to learn more about how such approaches work -- but at least in terms of compiler/DSL/PL-type features (basically anything that manipulates an AST), I find Haskell far easier to understand and read. So I was wondering if anyone has implemented anything similar in Haskell (or even a related language like Purescript).\n I know there's gi-gtk-declarative and Halogen (on the Purescript side) -- and while these are both excellent libraries for declarative UI programming, as far as I know, both of them are implemented via a VDOM -- not with a compilation step.\n Does anyone know of anyone who's attempted such a compile-time approach to declarative UIs in Haskell?\n    submitted by    /u/sintrastes  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "This is a post introducing the new changes of Iron v1.2.0.\n What is Iron ?\n Iron is a type constraints (or type refinement) library for Scala 3. It uses Dotty's inline and opaque types to evaluate constraints at compile-time.\n Here is a simple example: ```scala def log(x: Double > 0d): Refined[Double] = x.map(Math.log)\n log(-1d) //Compile-time error ```\n Features of 1.2.0\n Release 1.2.0 brings two key features: an imperative-styled DSL and constraints relations/consequences.\n Imperative DSL\n Iron brings a new imperative-styled DSL directly inspired by Martin Odersky's Representing Monad with Capabilities (HOPE 2021).\n Here is the \"imperative\" form of our log(x) method presented above: scala def log(x: Double > 0d): Raw[Double] = refined { Math.log(x) }  In this example, x is automatically unboxed via an implicit conversion only available inside refined and Math.log(x) is automatically boxed into a new Constrained.\n Capabilities work for other kind of monads. If you want to use capabilities in your project, I highly suggest you to watch the talk linked above.\n Consequences\n A consequence has basically a definition analoguous to logical implication => (do not confuse it with Scala's functions). It is used to convert a Constrained value to another Constrained.\n While a default implementation exists for all conversions, this new typeclass allows you to define specific relations (like transitivity, reflexivity etc...) that have two major benefits: - Check some conversions at compile-time where (for example, we know that a constrained value A / B can't be converted to A / Not[B]). - Avoid unnecessary evaluations at runtime.\n Note that Consequences are not exclusive to mathematical/numerical values.\n That's all for this release. For further information, check the release on Github.\n Happy new year!\n    submitted by    /u/Il_totore  \n [link]   [comments]",

At this point I have working versions of two of the more useful of their tools, the justification- and assumption-based truth maintenance systems (JTMS and ATMS).\n Truth maintenance systems track the relationships among possible beliefs, reasoning rules, incompatible/contradictory beliefs, and the conclusions we might draw from them. The JTMS stores a single context of which beliefs we might adopt; the ATMS tracks all of the various environments which might support the possible beliefs without contradiction. TMSes can guide search in reasoning engines, or can directly serve as models for program domains.\n The JTMS and ATMS code here are simple translations of F&dK's implementation, translated with minimal changes into Scala.

We can represent a list of numbers using List(1,2,3). So is list a kind ? Or is list a type constructor ?. we are not constructing any new type here using type constructor which is list or may be I really need to see from differ perspectives inorder to understand it.

To give you some context, I never professionally worked with Scala so I have a lot of assumptions which certainly aren't applicable.\n My first question would be about Tagless Final and ZIO. Because ZIO embeds its own Error type as ZIO[R, E, A], if using ZIO as a Tagless Final, it becomes possible to abstract and hide away one layer or Errors. So I have been trying to separate System errors from Business errors in the sake of having a Domain layer curated of error handling for the System errors.\n System error would be, what I qualify as lower level and environmental errors, as network connection drop, remote service being unreachable, etc. Business erro…",

Then I do: var new_df = list1.toDF(\"list1_column\") and I was thinking I could just use withColumn to add the other 2 lists as additional columns, one by one.

          "description": "This is probably a super basic beginner question, but I'm struggling a bit to figure it out. I'm trying to make a simple web app to learn frontend development, and wanted some functionality supporting dropping files into the app, but I can't seem to figure out how to get the literal contents of the file dropped to send it over to Haskell. My Haskell server is set up with Servant, and the Purescript side with Payload, and I'm looking at the documentation for Web.File.File, but the types are all abstract, and I don't see how to get the actual contents of the file. I'm assuming it's stored as a Blob, but there aren't any functions for consuming blobs and Payload can't transmit them.\n So I thought maybe I need to use the Javascript FFI, and was looking at this page, but I see there are quite a few different ways to consume the files, and I'm not sure what the difference is, or what Purescript types they would translate to. I'm assuming the problem isn't actually super complex, but I'm just not quite sure what to try, as I seem to spend the majority of my development time trying to debug issues with the Haskell/Purescript sides communicating with one another, so I'm hoping someone might be able to point me in the right direction to avoid wasting any more.\n Basically I'm looking for something File -> ByteString, so that the server can save/retrieve the file for later, without knowing the Purescript equivalent of ByteString.\n Alternatively, I mostly intend to have both the server and application running on the same machine, so if I can get the full filepath then I can just transmit that, and have the server read the file directly, but I can only seem to get the filename, and some googling seems to suggest the directory simply isn't stored in a DragEvent.\n Is there any easy way to do what I'm trying?\n    submitted by    /u/ablygo  \n [link]   [comments]",

Easy tasks like displaying a table of all D&D sessions is achievable with the column mode, but how about more complex aggreagations? For my studies, I created tiddlers for every subject including information for CP, semester, and category. In my overview, each semester is listed as seperate heading with the subjects being displayed by category as description lists and the CP summed up for each category. Please refer to the screenshot.\n In TiddlyWiki I can use filter expressions to select any tiddler (entry) from the wiki and extract data from it. This data can be transformed into arbitrary HTML, which is rendered when the article is visited. This query and transformation is done in the Wiki's own syntax, which is a part of the reason I wanted to switch to Emacs.\n How would I recreate this in OrgMode?

I heavily rely on tags to organize the notes and a feature that I wasn't able to find in org-roam is the possibility to have a list of all the tags I created, so that I can select a tag from this list and obtain a list of files with that tag. I know I can use org-roam-node-find, type the name of a tag and filter the files with that tag. However, given the large amount of tags I'm using, it's very hard to memorize all of them and I don't always know the exact name of the tag I'm looking for. Therefore, having a complete list with all the tags would be very helpful for me.

I very much dislike the idea of maintaining the same text in multiple files (fix a typo or re-word something in one, will I remember to propagate those changes throughout?), however the text required for the papers needs to be somewhat more concise than what appears in the thesis. So far I have handled this by having org files containing the core text for a section, which appears in both the thesis and the paper, and another org file that expands on the core and appears in the thesis only. \n This approach works well enough, but falls down when I want to interleave concise text and extended text. I could use the line number option for the include command to achieve this, however the text is changing too often for this to be practical. The natural conclusion seems to be to break things down even further, and to have separate org files per paragraph of text, and to construct larger documents out of these. \n Does anyone here have any experience of something like this (maybe there are packages which could help?), or perhaps better ideas (i.e. am I being a lunatic)?\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/ForsakenMachinery  \n [link]   [comments]",

I need a solution to prevent all file reference in my org-agenda-files are broken.\n My current solution to prevent the issue is to use hardlink in org-agenda-files ```\n assume I want add /a/b/c.org into emacs variable org-agenda-files\n mkdir ~/.emacs.d/org-agenda-files\n create hardlink of c.org in dir org-agenda-files\n ln /a/b/c.org ~/.emacs.d/org-agenda-files/c.org \n add ~/.emacs.d/org-agenda-files/c.org to emacs variable org-agenda-files\n ```\n However, this solution has some limit. For instance, - the absolute path of \"c.org\" become ~/.emacs.d/org-agenda-files/c.org. So its relative link are broken.\n LinkTek propose a much better solution: https://linktek.com/do-this-one-trick-and-never-worry-about-broken-file-links-again/\n  \nLinkTek creates an additional association between the parent file and each of its child files. LinkFixer Advanced uses that secondary association to quickly and automatically fix all the links that get broken by whatever changes someone makes to your files.\n  \nWhat solution you use for the problem of broken link?

How do I set up init.el so that Emacs will load a theme that is needed first, but then configure properly afterward?\n My example: Starting from scratch, I want to load monokai-theme from melpa and set it:\n (require 'package) (add-to-list 'package-archives '(\"melpa\" . \"https://melpa.org/packages/\") t) (custom-set-variables '(custom-enabled-themes '(monokai)) '(custom-safe-themes '(\"d9646b131c4aa37f01f909fbdd5a9099389518eb68f25277ed19ba99adeb7279\" default)) '(package-selected-packages '(monokai-theme))) (custom-set-faces ) \n If monokai-theme is already downloaded, this works fine. But I want to have emacs download the package automatically if not already present. I use the following block:\n (when (not package-archive-contents) (package-refresh-contents) (package-install-selected-packages) ) \n If I add this below the customize variables, it installs monokai-theme but doesn't load it. I need to restart emacs. If I add this above the customize variables, it doesn't work because package-selected-packages is not loaded yet.\n There's a catch-22 here since each piece needs the other to run first.\n I want to see if I can configure most things in customize, but maybe customize is not right for this job?

Since I don't want to potentially run into errors on a daily basis or anything like that.\n Should I go for the latest tag possible, i.e. emacs-28.0.90?

At some point in the future, I hope to write Lisp code to stream TDA data using the API and make trading decisions from within Emacs. For the near foreseeable future, however, I'll be relying upon watching the Thinkorswim desktop application to make decisions to buy/sell. Screen real estate is precious, as I need to see the charts, studies, order flow, etc.\n In a nutshell, I only need to tell Emacs: 50.35 RET and then perhaps 15 seconds later 51.25 RET. I have installed KeyboardMaestro, for systemwide keyboard shortcuts offering a variety of options, including executing scripts and so forth.\n I have two (2) Emacs options for order submission, either calling the curl executable, or running url-retrieve-synchronously.\n Any ideas regarding how to do this Emacs order entry quickly and save screen real estate would be greatly appreciated.\n BACKGROUND: There are certain custom orders available through TDA that cannot be executed programmatically from within Thinkorswim, but that should be possible through the API. Speed is the key as I am interested in momentum trades with high volatility.\n    submitted by    /u/lawlist  \n [link]   [comments]",

Now, there is one piece missing: whenever I push to my git repository, mini-frame-mode opens to prompt me for my git auth data. I don't want mini-frame-mode to handle this; instead, I want the password prompt to appear in the original mini buffer on the bottom.\n I know of the mini-frame-ignore-commands variable. However, I don't know which program is evoked by emacs to ask me for the password. I tried skimming the Messages Buffer for it, but adding magit-process-username-prompt and magit-process-password-prompt to the list didn't change anything, and I was unable to find a reference to another function in the packages' code.\n Thus: can you tell me which function emacs invokes to ask for auth data?\n Have a good day, folks :)\n    submitted by    /u/olivuser  \n [link]   [comments]",

Hopefully someone here knows what I am doing wrong.\n The situation: I am in my home directory. I want to add a note to the file ~/work/notes/todo.org.\n What I currently do: I enter \"wo C-j not C-j do <Enter>\", which is basically bash-style completion with C-j instead of the tab key and does not feel very helm-y.\n What the internet tells me to do: I have seen multiple posts of users claiming that I should be able to do this the helm way, e.g. entering \"todo\" first, then remembering the folder and narrowing with \"work\". However, this does not work for me. Even if I remove all my custom init settings, helm-find-files just doesn't do that.\n So what am I doing wrong? Is there a setting I need to enable?\n Other things I am aware of: I know there is also helm-find, but that a) is not fuzzy and b) takes upwards of 60 seconds (!) to find a file in my home directory even if I enter the complete file name, which is clearly not acceptable.There is also helm-projects-find-files, which seems to be for individual software projects and wants me to set up a project tree.\n I am aware that without some form of indexing, finding a file by name might just not be feasible. In that case, it would suffice if I could look for \"notes\", find nothing, then add a space and \"work\" and helm would be smart enough to expand those directories in reverse order. It feels like that is what the helm project page advertises anyway, but it just doesn't happen when I try it.\n Thanks in advance!\n    submitted by    /u/BettaGeorge  \n [link]   [comments]",

What usually works is looking in recently accessed files, be it recentf or just searching mini-buffer history.\n Finding file in a project usually works the best (Projectile), but it would probably work even better if it could just search the entire system.\n If I'm certain I have had this file open this session and haven't killed it yet, I can try switching between buffers (C-x b), but that usually only works on short trips and is rarely ergonomic.\n So if I'm not sure if the buffer is still alive, and if what I'm looking it belongs in the same project as what I'm looking for. recentf and history don't really land themselves well to exploratory navigation. \n What we're left with is find-file which looks and works amazingly with ivy, counsel, or even ido. But I often find myself frustrated, when changing a buffer takes more effort than you'd think it'd be necessary.\n Then I end up wishing I'd have mixed results, including recent files, input history, maybe project files, and so you could switch between them. ivy has different actions and that's cool, but can it change the data source on the fly?\n    submitted by    /u/CtrlAltCool  \n [link]   [comments]",

Couldn't be happier with my productivity, and the community is great! Tons of tutorials, terrific documentation on almost all the packages I need, and just generally cool, helpful folks. I've followed the community's advice on a whole lot of matters, including keybindings: I read people saying that CUA bindings would interfere with the bindings of many Emacs packages, that made sense to me, so I've learned and ingrained Emacs bindings into my brain. It's great! Until those terrible, dark times when...I need to leave Emacs.\n And discover that Emacs has trashed my muscle memory.\n Whenever I'm in a browser (can't use EWW for everything...right??), I find myself constantly closing tabs when I meant to cut text. I save files when I mean to search. If I use another app for long enough, I eventually do adapt back to CUA, but if I'm rapidly switching back-and-forth between Emacs and anything else, I start making mistakes the moment I relax into autopilot.\n How do y'all handle this? Do you extend Emacs bindings out to the rest of your system (and does that work across platforms)? Do you suck it up and tread carefully outside Emacs? What do you do when you face an app that can't be easily brought into the Emacs ecosystem?\n    submitted by    /u/chaiale  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I have been a happy Gnus user for years. Recently, though, it was persuasively brought to my attention that threads are fundamental to how emails work, so I have introduced some redundancy to my system in order to make the threads work. Now I find myself conflicted about how to resolve these three constraints:\n  \nMake \"sent\" messages visible anywhere, as sometimes I use a different computer at a different location. For this, I've made an email account which has the sole purpose of receiving BCC of all emails I send, and so I subscribe to this SENT inbox to get those messages.\n \nI use the GCC field to store a local version of my email upon sending, which has the advantage of storing the BCC recipients that are omitted from my SENT emails (especially useful when I send an \"undisclosed recipients\" email).\n \nI wish to see things in both my Sent folder and in-thread in my usual inbox location. This is working except that I end up with duplicates of message I've sent. I expect one in my sent folder and another in my inbox, but I am receiving two in my inbox, and (gnus-summary-ignore-duplicates t) doesn't seem to make any noticeable difference, even though one of the messages I end up with in my inbox states \"this is a duplicate\".\n Any improvements or alternatives that meet the needs of synchronizing mail across machines, maintaining a \"sent\" box, and allowing email threading in my inbox?\n \n    submitted by    /u/WorldsEndless  \n [link]   [comments]",

The problem is when i type too fast, for some reason this auto complete lags behind and actually affects the characters i input. So if i start typing sudo like below, if i am fast enough it will end up ignoring some of my input characters and i end up with suo or sdo sometimes. This placeholder is nice, to see but i dont want it to affect my actual keyboard input because it is slower than my type speed.\n https://preview.redd.it/uqy54hfckx581.png?width=151&format=png&auto=webp&s=e233620cda49876c919470b09d6f8f4867205329\n EDIT: The issue did not seem to be related to the tooltip, nonetheless the answers below offer a perfectly good solution to replacing the tooltip with either nothing or the default company auto complete box (with only one suggestion). The problem was for some reason related to only typing the character \"t\" (for some reason) and the binding to (tab) i used to trigger auto complete in addition to enter (<return>). \n (define-key company-active-map (kbd \"tab\") #'company-complete-selection) \n This above was causing the character \"t\", when typed in the buffer while company was filtering, to somehow lose focus from the buffer and stop typing in it.\n (define-key company-active-map [tab] #'company-complete-selection) \n This however works fine, and tab also does what it is supposed to be doing - completing the marked suggestion. \n    submitted by    /u/asmodeus812  \n [link]   [comments]",

This package makes it possible to run, and interact, with shell commands that are run completely detached from Emacs. The name of the package comes from dtach, which is the program that makes this package possible. \n As a user you start shell commands in dedicated sessions using dtache. Here is a list of some of the features that these sessions offer:\n - The user have access to all of the output from a session\n - The user gets a notification when a session has finished\n - Sessions are automatically labeled success or failure\n - Sessions can be started on remote hosts\n - The user can easily rerun a session\n - Sessions can be opened in a compile mode, which effectively makes it mimics M-x compile\n For a more thorough walk through of the package, and how to use it, you can watch this video which I have created: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=if1W58SrClk\n And the package itself you can find at https://gitlab.com/niklaseklund/dtache\n    submitted by    /u/squirelpower  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have in as an org extension so I get the benefit of being able to hide/show contents while retaining the functionality of hyperbole/hyrolo (I believe, correct me if I'm wrong).\n However, there's one thing that really annoys me, and I would like to know how to change that. Whenever I come out of a hyrolo-fgrep query, my hyrolo file is in read-only mode. Which means that I have to change out of it every time I made an edit. I C-s'ed through the Hyperbole manual but couldn't find it mentioned anywhere.\n Since I am not yet very proficient with the inner workings of my kitchen-si *ahem* batteries-included computing environment I don't even have a good idea on how to debug it. Thus, any more or less general considerations are also warmly welcomed!\n Have a good day, fellows :)\n    submitted by    /u/olivuser  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "For a while I've been lurking on the development of cell-mode [1], an Emacs mode created by David O'Toole. The blurb says:\n  \nCell-mode is an object-oriented spreadsheet control for GNU Emacs. It provides a major mode for spreadsheet-based user interfaces; it can be further extended by defining application-specific Emacs Lisp minor modes which supply new cell and spreadsheet classes via Emacs’ included object system, EIEIO.\n  \nI decided to create this post because I am not sure how widely known this mode is, and I'd like to raise attention to it. Personally, I think it is an amazing idea - a magit or org-mode-like \"killer app\" for Emacs. It may sound like I'm exaggerating (and perhaps I am), but just off the top of my head I can think of a few really interesting use cases:\n  \nintegrate it with org-mode as a table editor. You could edit the table in cell-mode and then see the ascii representation.\n integrate it with modes such as SQL mode and the like, so that you could visualise the table output as a cell-mode spreadsheet.\n as just a plain old spreadsheet. Most of my use cases for excel would probably go away with it plus Emacs lisp.\n easy CSV (etc) editing.\n derived modes (see mosaic [2] by the same author).\n  \nI'm sure many more use cases would quickly emerge by integrating it with other modes. If you use cell-mode or know of similar modes in this space do let me know on the comments.\n Disclaimer: I have no affiliation with David O'Toole or cell-mode development, just a regular Emacs user.\n ​\n https://preview.redd.it/sfq42fmt8j581.png?width=760&format=png&auto=webp&s=276ef95ea7ecccc910ebca23905ba1bfc9a178fc\n [1] https://gitlab.com/dto/cell-mode \n [2] https://gitlab.com/dto/mosaic-el\n    submitted by    /u/marco_craveiro  \n [link]   [comments]",

It seems that lsp does understand scopes, looking through the source i found out that faces such as lsp-face-highlight-write/read/textual - which do actually highlight the variable when i hover over it with the cursor. Now i am looking at doing the same but make it permanent, not only when you hover over the symbol. Trying to do that for both member variables and function argument variables. Lsp has lsp-face-semhl-member & lsp-face-semhl-parameter which are only coloured at the point of declaration.\n In the example below, crude, but member variables are purple, while the ones passed as function arguments are underlined-pink.

In particular I want my setup to support a relatively old version of emacs (26.3) which I can find or easily install on random machines.\n As a result, I'd like to upgrade my packages but only when they are compatible with this maximum allowed version of emacs itself.\n I can hit \"U\" in the package list to mark all packages which can be upgraded up to my current emacs version. What I do now is manually inspect the upgrade list, checking the dependencies of each marked package, and removing items which require a too advanced version of emacs. But this is cumbersome.\n Is there a command or a programmatic way to restrict this list to show only the upgrades which are compatible with the maximum allowed emacs version? I can't find any commands for this. I looked for package functions for querying a package's dependencies by package name, but it seems like most of the functions in package.el need a package-desc as input, and I'm not sure how to get that struct only from a package name and for available rather than installed versions.\n    submitted by    /u/algalgal  \n [link]   [comments]",

I want to avoid hooks for buffer switches to use the remapping, and preferably have this in my config, execute once, override the faces and be done at that point.\n What I am trying to achieve is force a few packages, which use custom face attributes (i.e helm-rg) to use the default attributes of my theme (i.e make the helm-rg-preview-line-highlight face force inherit/override itself from my mode-line face styles etc.).

          "description": "Inspired by recent, well-known articles on Embark and on Avy, I've started testing Embark over the past few days - and it's already turning into the interface I always wanted and only sort of knew I needed. While it's extremely useful out-of-the-box, I've already found a few cases where I would want to use it but can't, because it doesn't understand the construct at point. Examples:\n  \nOrg mode timestamps - to provide operations like activate/inactivate, change, pop calendar to that date, bump by repeater, etc.\n \nOrg mode headlines - pretty much everything you can do on those, that Org mode has bound to countless weird keys. Including \"speed commands\", most of which could work without quitting the Embark \"prompter\", the way e.g. navigating to next/prev symbol works.\n \nOrg mode tables - embark-cycle could be able to switch between cell, row, column, whole table (perhaps also stopping at \"rowgroup\", \"column group\" and \"subtable\", which would be rectangular areas that are bound by hlines and column group markers) - each of those would have its own contextual commands available. For example, \"eval formula\", so one doesn't have to remember reference syntax and how many times to press C-u before pressing C-c =.\n \nSyntactic elements and expressions in programming language modes, allowing for e.g. language-specific actions.\n \n From the looks of it, it's not that hard to write any - the tricky bit being target classifiers. I'm going to take a stab at adding some classifiers and action keymaps for things I commonly interact with - but I'd like to avoid repeating work that might already be done better. Hence my question: are there any \"extension packages\" that enable Embark to recognize more target types? Or, are any of you already using hand-written ones (and if yes, can you share them)?\n    submitted by    /u/TeMPOraL_PL  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "We have all seen Emacs be described as so many different things: a text editor, not just a text editor, an operating system, a Lisp interpreter, and a *million other things.\n Describing what Emacs is can be super difficult, as it is different things to different people. Some use it for programming or general writing, some for organisation, project management, email, web browsing, controlling media, and a **million more things. Basically, people use Emacs for whatever they want, which is fantastic! \n This makes it difficult to describe what exactly Emacs is to people outside our friendly little circle. Other editors can be described nearly completely with a short familiar phrase. Vim is an efficient text editor, VSCode is a powerful modern IDE, Vi is a last resort. But Emacs doesn't have a consistent and universally agreeable short description. \n My question is, what is Emacs to you? How would you describe it succinctly to someone who has heard about it, but not sure what all the fuss is about? \n My humble submission would be: \"the whatever you want text interface.\"\n *Mild exaggeration, but you get the picture\n ** Under exaggeration :)\n    submitted by    /u/azfrak  \n [link]   [comments]",

I can also easily navigate buffers without a pointing device; I am uncomfortable with pointing devices (mouses and touchpads), despite using them for 11 years. Pointing devices seem to really mess with me and I can't control them as well (as I can with a keyboard).\n EDIT: My only complaint is that I wish I could display images in CLI emacs, like running viu on links to images after eww finishes loading.

          "description": "I'm working on my \"adulting.\" I'm reviewing and setting habits to help guide me in times of lower clarity. Looking at ideas for creating a tool for thinking, I came up with a tool that prompts me to refine the edits to zettel titles and 'summary relevance.'\nThis 'tool for thinking' results from a python program tied to Keyboard Maestro that prompts me to review titles and summaries of the last ten days of newly created zettel. As an anchor, it is tied to my practice of morning journaling. It reminds me and makes it convenient to examine each zettel title and the one-sentence 'relevance' statement to see if it makes sense and stands up to scrutiny. This is added to the bottom of that template. (pictured below) Automatic, easy peasy, the cognitive load of the initiating behavior habit off-loaded to the computer. This is not an excuse for not editing the body of each zettel. A new zettel will be on the list for ten days. That means ten opportunities for giving the zettel some love.\nI'm unsettled on the format. In its current form it is a bit hard to read. I will make changes for readability.\nIf you're interested in how this is done, have questions about my use-case, or just want to chat let me know.\nBelow are pictured titles and a one-sentence summary/meaning of the zettel I'm working on. These are the ideas I'm currently wrestling with. They represent a ten-day window of new zettel.\nThis is generated with nothing held back. I would love to talk to you about anything on this list. If any of this is of interest to you, please start a thread here, DM me, or get in touch via email.",

          "description": "Dear friends,\nI'm releasing phi-notes, an emacs package implementing a minor mode to work with a flavour of the Zettelkasten system I've been using for some years now.  It has the following characteristics:\nNotes are identified by unique, sequential numbers (0001, 0002 etc.).\nNotes may be linked using the wikilink syntax ([[0001]]).\nNotes may have \"parent\" and \"descendant\" notes; they may also be linked to project notes.\nBibliographical annotation is supported with BibTeX references.\nNotes may have tags (identified by #hashtags).\nNotes have a YAML(ish) frontmatter to keep metadata and are (preferably, but not necessarily) written in Markdown.\nThe aim of this project is to develop features to ease the creation, navigation and linking of notes in one or multiple note repositories.\nA sidebar functionality makes the minor-mode particularly useful for working with structure notes:\n\nOther functionalities include: creating descendant notes, integration with helm, helm-ag and helm-bibtex; \"killing\" and \"yanking\" to notes, searching for tags and backlinks; navigation commands for visiting the parent, following links.\nSome details of the implementation might be too personal, but the code may at least be useful as a starting point. I'm calling it a phi minor mode because this is how I named my system long ago.\nMore information and a setup guide are available on the GitHub project documentation.\nMerry Christmas! 🎄",

          "description": "Greetings from Canada 🙂\nI was using nvAlt and Simplenote together for about 10 years and recently migrated to my own app, Hyperdraft, which I consider a web remake of Notational Velocity; my app is not based on files, but it supports markdown and you can own your data.\nI'm interested in the idea of 'turning your text notes into a website' and have been cultivating a digital garden / personal wiki for about a year now, inspired by Andy Matuschak; in the same place as my private notes, I have other ones that are 'public', and they appear as pages on this website (wiki links become public URLs).\nLearning about Zettelkasten over the last few years, it feels like I've been practicing it with todos and building projects, but not as much with 'knowledge'—my notes about the work of others 'slip away' because they are not interconnected and I don't put them in my note taking app. (I'm looking for an app that approximates manual sorting of index cards).\nThe 'searchable left-list' pattern is quite functional for me, and so I tend to incorporate it into all of my apps in some way. If you're interested to know more, check out my presentation called Wetware of writing and doing, where I also go into how I use Hyperdraft to make things happen.\nHope to hang out here more often as I have more to learn about Zettelkasten and maybe some apps to make 😉.",
