What's the general feeling on HMatrix?\n I guess I should also mention that I'm coming from a Python+Rust background, where my workflow was to do all the heavy lifting in Rust, serialize the data to a npy/npz file, and then do all the plotting in Python with matplotlib. One thing I haven't found on Hackage is something to handle the serialization step -- ideally, I'd like to take an HMatrix object (or some other equivalent) and just call a function to write it to a file. Does anyone know of a good solution for that? Otherwise, what are some nice, ergonomic (preferably matplotlib-like) plotting libraries?\n Thanks in advance!\n    submitted by    /u/wuzup11  \n [link]   [comments]",

Thanks in advance! \n Hello, Haskell enthusiasts! 👋\n I'm new to Haskell and I've been exploring the language through a project I'm working on. To debug my code, I've been manually inserting `traceShow` statements from the Debug.Trace module. While I find this method effective, it's also quite time-consuming.\n Problem Statement:\n I'm wondering if there's an existing tool that can automate the insertion of `traceShow` statements into Haskell code at key points. This would significantly streamline my debugging process.\n haskell\n -- Example: Original Code getMiddle2 :: String -> String getMiddle2 sourceString | isOddLength = takeMiddle 1 | otherwise = takeMiddle 2 where sourceLength = length sourceString ... \n What I Would Like the Tool to Produce:\n haskell\n -- Example: With traceShow statements getMiddle2 :: String -> String getMiddle2 sourceString | traceShow (\"Checking isOddLength:\", isOddLength) isOddLength = traceShow (\"Taking middle 1:\", takeMiddle 1) takeMiddle 1 | otherwise = traceShow (\"Taking middle 2:\", takeMiddle 2) takeMiddle 2 where sourceLength = traceShow (\"Source Length:\", sourceLength) length sourceString ... \n What I've Considered:\n I've thought about crafting a tool myself that involves parsing the Haskell source code into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) and then traversing this tree to insert `traceShow` statements. But before going down that rabbit hole, I wanted to consult the community. Is there already a tool out there that can help me with this?\n Open to Suggestions:\n Being new to Haskell, I'm also open to any advice or alternative approaches for debugging or learning the language. If there's a better way to do things, I'm all ears! 🐰\n Thank you for any recommendations, experiences, or advice you can share.

Most resources (that I encountered) just teach you what monads are and that's about it. I had the hang of monads for a while but never really had the confidence to make something practical using Haskell.\n Recently I decided to change that by doing some practical stuff using Haskell. So I present to you Hagit: A git clone written in Haskell. It is fairly limited but if you really try you can actually do version control using it (at least locally). It can also clone a repo.\n I have also extensively documented what I have done. As for how my experience was, I really enjoyed it, baring a few annoyances. The code is probably not idiomatic, as this is more or less my first attempt at making something practical with Haskell. If you have some time at your hand and want to dive into git internals please give it a read (the readme has links to 3 articles that have the details) and if possible please suggest what I could have done better.\n    submitted by    /u/shrekcoffeepig  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "A variation of this question have been asked before, unfortunately, I am not bright enough to understand them. So I am asking this question to hopefully get a more concrete answer from a particularly generous haskeller.\n When I researched the type of IO in haskell, I get this from ghci info:\n (GHC.Prim.State# GHC.Prim.RealWorld -> (# GHC.Prim.State# GHC.Prim.RealWorld, a #))\n I am not quite sure what any of this means, but from what I gather, this abstracts to something like this: IO _ := (RealWorld -> (RealWorld, _ )). This looks like the state monad, which has type: [W, W × _ ], for a choice of state handling type W. The StateT monad I see in documentation is a little different since it has monad composition StateT (s -> m (a, s)), so I guess I should say that we require the monad m to be the idenitity monad. \n My question is, why do we need to use these primitive types? Somehow, this makes it possible for IO functions to interact with the outside environment, like call other programs or writing to the file system. But how does that happen exactly? \n Second, what is this RealWorld? Is it a bitestring? An integer? A constant? When updating the state, what actually happens? \n Lastly, the ST monad, which has definition: ST s a. This type allows us to perform mutations to inside variables but it does not allow effects. From what I gather, this does in fact mutate memory. It also has a function to \"escape\" the ST wrapper, called runST. Obviously, this makes practical sense, but what is stopping up from simply writing a function runIO that escapes the IO. That would most certainly be a bug, but what is preventing us from doing it?\n    submitted by    /u/Alternative_Bug_5096  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello all. I've recently made another video about my 3D game engine project Game :: Dangerous (written in Haskell), which can be found as follows.\n Project repos: https://github.com/Mushy-pea\n Video: https://youtu.be/wOSQ1cYoZXM?si=bF2UtM_zr8OYOPHi\n I'm interested in what people think about some of the design choices I've made. One of the most interesting things to me about software development is how design and implementation interact. So briefly, the engine is not a development framework such as Unity or Unreal (nor anywhere near that complex) but more similar to GZDoom for example. It's a program that loads a text file, within which is encoded environment geometry, game logic scripting and references to asset files. The game logic scripting is implemented through a virtual machine in the engine that runs a bytecode form of the engine's custom scripting language.\n I spent a long time deciding how to implement a map editor, when I probably should have decided early on and developed it in parallel. What I eventually decided to do (in June 2022) was to write a local web server that loaded the same map files as the engine, allowed their state to be queried and modified through API requests from a client and could save that state back to the same text file format. That server now makes up about 20% of the Haskell code in the main repo and shares some static libraries with the engine. I've also started writing the web client that provides a UI for the map editor, a prototype of which is shown in the video.\n Anyway, thanks for reading and looking forward to feedback if anyone feels like it.\n    submitted by    /u/Mushy-pea  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I am writing a big calculator. This calculator has many, many inputs and many, many outputs. My fundamental type is a Partner. Conceptually it makes sense to associate both inputs and outputs with a Partner. Also, some of the outputs are both important on their own and as inputs to later parts of the calculation.\n My question is: how do I architect this in Haskell? I can imagine having a big Partner record type that has a field for each input and each output. The downside of this is I'd have to initialize it with empty values for all the outputs. Would I then make those a Maybe type? That might get annoying.\n Do I instead define a separate type for each new output as it's calculated? Say we start with just a PartnerInput object that only holds the inputs. Then we calculate the first output and put the result in a PartnerInputAndFirstOutput object. I.e. the first function has type PartnerInput -> PartnerInputAndFirstOutput. Then the next function has type PartnerInputAndFirstOutput -> PartnerInputAndSecondOutput, and so on. Intuitively this feels silly.\n Like any good Haskeller I want to use the type system to help guarantee the correctness of my code, but I can't figure out how in this case.

Consider the following example: \n {-# LANGUAGE GADTSyntax #-} import Data.Kind (Type) data Foo :: Type where Bar1 :: {f :: String, g :: Integer} -> Foo Bar2 :: {f :: String, g :: Integer, h :: Double, l :: Double} -> Foo deriving (Eq) \n ​\n Bar1 and Bar2 have a common \"core\" (f and g), but Bar2 extends on it by adding the fields h and l. In the way I see it, it makes functions that deal with Foo a little more of a hassle to write, since the fields f and h wouldn't be total for all values of Foo, making me resort to the Either and/or Maybe monads. \n One way to avoid this would be turning Foo into a typeclass that abstract the common features of Bar1 and Bar2 and turning Bar1 and Bar2 themselves into types.\n The downside would be that I wouldn't be able to use pattern matching as easily and it would be harder to rely on the compiler to tell me when functions don't deal with all the possible values in the domain of Foo. Also, things that I could do to both constructors at once (like deriving an Ord instance for both of them) would be alot more verbose to do. And, if I decided to collect them in some sort of list, I would have to deal with heterogeneously typed lists.\n ​\n Anyway, maybe this is too much of a beginner question, but I'd like to hear from you possible ideas to solve this.\n    submitted by    /u/ComunistCapybara  \n [link]   [comments]",

This gave me chills, so I wanted to try this way of reasoning with a theorem for natural numbers, but I'm stuck. In particular, I would like to prove that given two natural numbers m,n the GCD of m,n is the same as the GCD of (m mod n) and n. Again, here there is an equality so I think I would have to show there is an isomorphism between the two things.

          "description": "I'm currently reading the book written by Bird & Wadler and trying to solve some exercises about foldl, foldr, etc.. I ran into a problem 3.5.6 that I don't know how to solve. The problem is as follows:\n Given a list xs = [x_1, x_2, ..., x_n] of numbers, the sequence of successive maxima (ssm xs) is the longest subsequence [x_j_1 , x_j_2 , . . . , x_j_m] such that j_1 = 1 and x_j < x_j_k for j < j_k. For example, the sequence of successive maxima of [3, 1, 3, 4, 9, 2, 10, 7] is [3, 4, 9, 10]. Define ssm in terms of foldl.\n I wonder how to solve this? The authors in this chapter mention many identities with foldl, foldr, map (the three duality theorems about foldl and foldr are mentioned), but I don't know how to use it in solving this problem.

I'd like to thank everyone that has given their thoughts so far, and the proposal has been updated in turn to reflect that :)\n  \nIncreased prominence of deliverable items (esp unit tests) in proposal\n Performance benefit section has been added to Problem Statement\n Test vectors for algorithms (esp CAVP / FIPS / NIST) added to Optional Deliverables\n  \nToday I am happy to announce the final draft of the Botan / Cryptography Community Project Proposal. Barring any changes, I plan to officially submit the proposal to the Haskell Foundation on Monday, and I am now asking for any last feedback, opinions, thoughts, and criticisms that anyone might want to sneak in at the last moment.\n  \nProject update\n In addition to the proposal itself, we have the following updates to the libraries themselves as well:\n  \nGood progress has been made on Botan.Low.Cipher, which is now properly complete\n Unit tests for Botan.Low.Cipher\n Unit tests revealed that botan_cipher_output_length is inaccurate / flawed\n Corrected buffer estimate functions have been implemented to replace it\n Implemented offline / one-shot and online / incremental encryption\n Online encryption should be much more performant since you can stream the data instead of having to load it all at once\n Some cipher algorithms (SIV, CCM) are not online-capable, and their unit tests fail for the moment, but that is expected behavior (better organized unit tests will fix this)\n  \n You can follow the project devlog on discourse!\n    submitted by    /u/ApothecaLabs  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Some context: I'm a Java programmer, but I don't like it. I have a background in mathematics so naturally I am interested in (pure) functional programming. At my dayjob, I have expressed my feelings towards Java and expressed I would like to do something more \"mathematically motivated\" and coined Scala and their effect systems as examples. My teamlead, who himself is a developer, wanted me to give him a bit more of an explanation of what I meant by this, so I set out to gather some information I can present to him.\n But\n I am confused as to how I can unite the following two descriptions of effects:\n  \nRob Norris in his talk 'Functional Programming with Effects' talks about mathematical functions and then talks about effects as basically ways to be able to do the stuff we're used to in programming like functions not being total, mutability, ... He then talks about the 6 most known 'effects' and wants to be able to compose them, then concludes that basically an effect is an `F[_]` which is a Monad.\n Cats-Effect, from the docs says that their typeclass hierarchy describe, fundamentally, what it means to be a functional effect. But their typeclass hierarchy is for their specific runtime and focusses almost exclusively on asynchrony, parallelism and concurrency. I don't see `Option` or `Either` fitting in here.\n  \nSo what gives? I am really confused at this point, but I would really appreciate if someone could shed some light on this. \n Bonus question: In the same talk, Rob Norris says that there are a lot of other effects out there. How do I find them? This sounds silly, but does he just mean like \"custom monads\" that we might define in our business which are only applicable in our custom business environment, or does he mean more powerful abstractions which are just more complex than the ones he showed?\n    submitted by    /u/Migeil  \n [link]   [comments]",

Scalafmt doesn't recognize bad indentation either.\n Intellij Idea object MyProgram: def abs(n: Int): Int = if n < 0 then -n else n private def formatAbs(x: Int) = <-- val msg = \"The absolute value of %d is %d\" <-- Metals doesn't indent msg.format(x, abs(x)) <--Metals doesn't indent @ main def hello: Unit = println(formatAbs(-42)) \n I tried Idea and their support is even worse it wouldn't even let me unindent the private which defaulted to the indentation level of the `else` statement in the abs function. \n How can I get VSCode to behave correctly? I don't really want to manually adjust indentation on every line every time that just seems tedious.\n Edit: from my research I can just use curly braces after the = in definitions and this will enforce the indentation rules. https://docs.scala-lang.org/scala3/reference/other-new-features/indentation.html\n Is this safe/reasonable to do?

It's really all PySpark now. What a disappointment 😢 Especially with Scala 3, honestly any data engineer who knows Python could easily write Spark job in Scala. \n Hard to find the motivation to keep learning FP in Scala when the Scala opportunities are so limited. I guess it will teach me FP so that's good.

This way OCaml knows the return type of each SQL query even if they are just pure SQL.\n Is there anything similar for Scala?

Make org-mode recognise.md files (I know this is YES). 2. Make org-mode pick-up TODO states from org-mode headings appearing in .md files with otherwise md syntax (*** TODO Read this, somewhere in md file) and show it in agenda. 3. Or even make org-mode recognise some md elements (headings or Obsidian-style checkboxes) with TODO states.\n I know 1 is possible, though not sure who uses this for what. I think 2 might be possible? And would probably be exactly what I need. Option 3 smells like somethink no-one should ever attempt, yet I'm not sure why (not).\n Thanks!!\n    submitted by    /u/mira_dadadada  \n [link]   [comments]",

Prior to this when I was on windows I used obsidian for that purpose. \n I really liked the philosophy behind obsidian and bidirectional linking. However, ever since I started using Linux I feel the need of avoiding closed source applications. I've seen people use OrgMode and I believe I really like the extensibility. I also like the TODO/scheduling features of OrgMode and the Android app that syncs with it. For that I use calcurse atm. \n I want to use Emacs solely for the purpose of using OrgRoam alone. That's it. I don't want to go down another rabbit hole of configuration and tinkering (the previous ones being neovim, sway, kitty and gnome in order of recency). I need vim keybinds, a decent syntax highlighting for orgmode, git version control and a dark low contrast colouscheme. I believe OrgMode can already do what markdown does and probably better, so no worries there. \n What is the best plan of action for this? Thanks a lot for helping me out and I apologise if this sounds too stuck up/opinionated but I really cannot afford to go down that rabbit hole and I am looking for a (relatively) quick solution (preferably doable within a day).

          "description": "Hello friends,\n I recently tried installing kde-plasma-desktop with sddm on an Ubuntu 22.04 installation with GNOME. I didn't try it in a vm first and thought I could just get away with having both on my machine with no problems. Stupid, I know. I ended up removing KDE and reinstalling gdm, but now I'm missing all of my GTK icons when I start up Emacs.\n https://i.imgur.com/fRdlr8o.png\n The strange part is, that only sometimes the usual GTK icons will show up, and it's always when I least expect it. I suspect that some of the config changes that happened when I installed KDE conflicted with my GTK and my QT themes.\n I've tried removing gtk3.0 and gtk4.0 folders from my ~/.config directory, removing ~/.local/share/icons, and inspecting ~/.themes, but I see nothing related to icons there. I'm just wondering what could be causing this behavior, and if it's conflicting with other applications on my system I haven't discovered yet.

Lastly, all source code is easily navigable and documented, with a single .org file in charge of running the show.\n If you use Emacs 29 it's super easy to try it out with --init-directory !\n I'd appreciate any feedback/suggestions/contributions a lot :)\n https://github.com/alopezrivera/Seaman-Emacs/\n Design choices:\n  \nSource: seaman.org contains is the source of all modules and layers. All source files are asynchronously tangled when saving. config.org contains the source code of your (in this case my) config. All blocks inside are asynchronously tangled to init.el when saving\n Package manager: straight.el\n Key bindings: Emacs + custom\n  \nOut of the box:\n  \nClean UI\n Homescreen\n Easy theme switching (light/dark)\n \"Full pack\" Org Mode with org-agenda, org-calendar, org-roam etc.\n \"Full pack\" PDF support with pdf-tools (highlighting, etc.)\n Magit for VC\n  \nExample config:\n My personal config built with Seaman is here:\n https://github.com/alopezrivera/Seaman-Emacs/blob/main/config.org\n    submitted by    /u/No-Jackfruit3921  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "In my quest to create a personalized note-taking system, I chose to use Emacs. While I'm aware of various existing packages like roam, zk, and org-journal, I wanted a solution that precisely catered to my needs, without unnecessary features or the loss of essential ones. This drove me back to Emacs from Logseq, as I realized I only required a simple system for taking daily notes.\n With that in mind, I crafted a configuration to facilitate note-taking and accomplished a feature I had long desired: integration with Raindrop to fetch my bookmarks. Surprisingly, it was a straightforward process.\n This experience has reaffirmed my belief in the versatility of Emacs, allowing it to be tailored to meet one's unique requirements. I'm now fully immersed in the world of Emacs.\n Feel free to take a look at my configuration and offer any tips, code suggestions, or ideas on how to further enhance, simplify, or expand it.

For the keywords colors, it was mostly fine, and at first I only checked that and was content with it. \n Things went a bit sour when I starting writing code, in particular the indent-rules. I have used mainly the following so far : - cmake-ts-mode - c++-ts-mode - yaml-ts-mode\n Over the past two weeks there has not been a work day where I did not have to complete or \"fix\" indentation rules to my liking.\n On the one hand it is much easier than before to tweak things, where either there was a customizable variable, either you were screwed. Now you can add rich rules, kind of easily\n On the other hand, the out of the box experience was much worse, barely usable indentation especially for the c++ mode which, despites its 4 presets, lacks the many quick toggles from cc-mode. \n I do commend maintainers though for their amazing core implementation, the api + utilities make debugging tree sitter rules a breeze. \n How has your treesitter Journey been so far ?\n    submitted by    /u/Horrih  \n [link]   [comments]",

My question is: what is the best way to do what I am after? If there is one function that I can bundle both of these features in, then that might be better.

Tab completion works too, as long I do not sudo -i .\n If I do - completions will break, which is not ideal because I have several scripts in the root path which I need to complete.\n If I leave the eshell way and use mx-shell oder eat-shell etc. I will have tab completion everywhere but the directory is not synched.\n I know I can just type C-x C-f /ssh:user@host|sudo::/file\n But the hostnames we are using are quite long and generic.

          "description": "Hej fellows,\n through work, I have discovered TimeTimers some years ago. I have found it easy to work with, which is why I've bought one for myself. However, I've been meaning to have something like this in emacs, because I've noticed that no matter the package (be it built-in or tmr), I am missing the convenience that a TimeTimer provides.\n First off, I'd like to know if any of you know a package that does this or something like this: conveniently display (in the modeline, maybe?) a bar or clock that shows the passage of time in a continuous fashion, i.e. showing a graphic representation (like a bar going from full to empty or a pie chart going from full to empty) instead of changing numbers (the customary form of representing a timer in my experience).\n If that's not a thing -- and I'd be flabbergasted about that to be frank --, I'd love to get some tips on how to implement this. If I were to choose, I'd preferably have a timetimer implemented as a decreasing progress bar in the mode line. The width would be depending upon the \"available space\" (dunno if there is a way to find that out for different configurations of modelines), the progress bar would be recalculated in regular intervals and the (pseudo-)continuous steps would be calculated depending on the time input when setting the timer. Maybe, the progress bar could \"blink\" (i.e. disappear and reappear) an amount of times to be set by a variable. For graphical representation, I am eyeing the SVG-LIB by Nicolas Rougier.\n I am grateful for tips and pointers, I am a bit at a loss as to where to start.\n Have a good day!\n    submitted by    /u/olivuser  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi everyone! Last week I released version 0.4 of ekg, which is an extensible tag-based, sqlite-backed note taking application for emacs.\n This version has been in the works for months, and has notable improvements:\n Drafts! You can now save (with C-x C-s) long notes and they will be tagged with \"draft\" and not show in other places until you commit the note.\n Magic tags! You can now have tags that automatically execute some elisp, useful for special notes that need some different editing. The standard example is setting your input method for notes with a tag indicating it's in a different language.\n LLM integration! Now you can have LLMs response to your notes inline, with prompts configured based on your tags. We use the new GNU ELPA llm package, so we support whatever it supports (right now Open AI and Google Cloud Vertex's APIs)\n File notes! Just like you can have notes on URLS, can you now have notes on files! It's basically a way to annotate any file. And because of how our prompt, template, and prefixing rules work, the directory structure can control the templates and prompts for any LLM integration you have.\n Also, here's a video demonstrating these features!\n Thanks to everyone who contributed to this release, notably Jay Rajput, Umar Ahmad and Qingshui Zheng!\n ​\n    submitted by    /u/ahyatt  \n [link]   [comments]",

When an imported library changes the only sensible way to deal with it is to stop the python process and start another one. (That's because in Python the built in \"import\" statement doesn't reload the file. You could reload each library with reload, but that would be tricky.)\n For that reason, I would like to use M-x compile. It's suitable for that kind of thing and I've used it for running programs written in other languages. (I think this is a fairly well known Emacs trick).\n The problem is Venvs. My projects use venv. If I just start a fresh python using M-x compile then it won't be in the right venv. I've thought about writing a batch file to solve this problem.

          "description": "Hello Emacs users, I'm currently trying to re-do my own emacs configuration but after facing thousands of issues, indenting buffers is the one thing that's going to turn me bald in a matter of hours.\n I'm trying to work with multiple languages, Go, Rust, Python, JS/TS, etc. The one thing I haven't figured out correctly is proper indentation without having to do keyboard gymnastics. I know that Emacs is more of a DIY thing, so any light shed here would be of great help. \n I've already tried (add-hook …), using the :config section in my (use-package go-mode) declarations and more but none of them are having any visible effect. \n Furthermore, I saw this issue with Go and I heavily suspect other programming languages won't come out as clean as I think. \n Every time I edit a Go file, when adding a new line to anything that needs indentation (e.g: a function body, if, for, etc.) Two “4 spaces” tabs are inserted no matter what. Even when I press the <TAB> key I have to backspace ALWAYS, also some closing delimiters like }) don't align properly, but I suspect that's another issue maybe fixed by puni.\n ​\n The “best” thing I could do to prevent newlines from getting messed up on creation was turning off electric-indent, I've heard mixed opinions on that, some say it's great, some say it's terrible, I don't really know. Without electric-indent I don't have to backspace two tabs on a newline, but TAB still creates those two tabs, even when my modeline reports (TABx4). Here is a snippet of the important stuff in my configuration file. \n (setq-default c-basic-offset 4 tab-width 4 indent-tabs-mode t standard-indent 4) ;; jsjsjsjs (electric-pair-mode 1) ;; Disable electric-indent messing up my code >:( (setq electric-indent-inhibit t electric-indent-mode nil) \n If any of you could spare your elisp-fu powers to me, I would be extremely thankful. Thanks for your time in advance. :)\n    submitted by    /u/VentGrey  \n [link]   [comments]",

Just this much would suffice :) I don't need anything else from a code-editor (although Emacs is so much more than that).\n    submitted by    /u/haxguru  \n [link]   [comments]",

One annoying thing however is that every time I edit the code I'm writing, I have to quit() in the interpreter, close the window (Ctrl-x + 0), restart the interpreter (Ctrl-c + Ctrl-p) and reimport the code.\n I edit the code and then just write \"import *script*\" but the changes don't appear unless I do it as mentioned above.\n Even if I just quit(), I can't just (Ctrl-c + Ctrl-p) again because I have to close the buffer for it to start again.\n Is it supposed to be like this?

On the school computers we have to input given commands in the Linux console to get access to the \"import cv2\", but I do most of my work home and I have a windows.\n I was then wondering how I can download (?) and make it so I can import \"cv2\" and use it's commands like \"cv2.imread('plane.jpg')\" and so on. I've searched on google but found nothing useful.\n I'm kind of just starting out so I don't understand what it means to \"mix\"/\"import\" OpenCV into emacs and such things. I have downloaded OpenCV (I think) but I couldn't just start emacs and start using the functions from \"import cv2\".\n ​\n Short question: How can I use the \"import cv2\" on emacs and start working with pictures?

But I do feel like with the right Emacs set up I should be able to do more with less)\n Has anyone had success using emacs to help deal with their RSI? On a basic level I'm thinking of things like auto capitalizing sentences after. Or some kind of English friendly hippie expand to auto complete words using context. In the dream version maybe you can occasionally dictate words and then feed that through Local LLM to fix up the inevitable problems. Also, personally, something like a super abbreviation module that was great at auto completing words or guessing it words only using the left side of a split keyboard.\n The ultimate irony here is I'd love to take on some of these projects myself, but I can't effectively type anymore. Sad panda. After a few days of rest I'm able to test new keyboard, I got excited for a few hours, and then spend the rest of the day watching the pain in my right forearm intensify. I'm hoping to get up to some base level of functionality using existing tools that I can use the bootstrap my own development.\n Anyway, if there's anything you know of or directions you can put me in I greatly appreciate it.\n (if my current depression is coming through this post please excuse me, chronic pain is just a bitch and AA so when you can't do any of the things that you would normally do to take your mind off it.

Basically, what I mean is that, as also the case with jupyter notebooks, if I am doing an analysis and I run a cell which updates a variable itself in a self-referential way, without forgetting to run the cell where it was initialized, I get the wrong output. Is there a way to make sure one if I run an src block that depends on another src block, that the dependent src block will run before the one that I am currently running. I realize, I would need to manually tie these together. I feel like something could be done w/ the preamble attribute and writing an elisp function that just runs another src block, but I don't know how that elisp function would look. As an MWE, I imagine the functionality kind of looking like...\n #+name: initialize #+begin_src python x = 5 #+end_src #+begin_src python :preamble (call_src \"initialize\") x+=1 #+end_src \n I tried...\n (defun call_src (name) (org-babel-goto-named-src-block name) (org-babel-execute-src-block)) \n but it seemed not to load the variables before running the cell (possibly because I am using Jupyter-Emacs w/ asynchronous src blocks). \n Any help is appreciated.

This package isn't for end-users, it's for others who are writing llm-based functionality to do so in a way that is agnostic of the llm backend. That way the user can use the LLM they have access to. LLMs are \"large language models\", very large systems that are able to deal with natural language with surprising naturalness.\n To start, we provide functionality for creating embeddings, and for LLM chat, in both sync and async versions. There are only two providers to start with: Open AI and Google Cloud Vertex. There's obviously more that are possible, such as Anthropic's API, or Llama 2.\n The difficulties with providing an interface to Llama 2, by the way, is that there seem to be a lot of different ways to install and use it, so it isn't clear that there's a good interface I could provide that would be widely useful. But it's pretty easy to write your own, and maybe I'll provide an interface that just goes to some command-line utility and executes it.\n If you are an author of a package that does something with LLMs, I'd encourage you to use this package, so your users can have some control of what backend they are using. And if you want to help expand the number of LLMs we have access to, please send a pull request if you have FSF papers. This is a GNU project, so FSF papers are required for substantial contributions.\n    submitted by    /u/ahyatt  \n [link]   [comments]",

Check out its project page at https://github.com/szermatt/mistty.\n Such a buffer feels very much like comint mode: you can move around freely and run any Emacs command you want - until you press TAB and end up with the native completion or notice the shell autosuggestions. With MisTTY you have access to both Emacs and the shell commands and editing tools.\n Additionally, commands that take over the entire screen, such as less or vi also work, temporarily taking over the window, while scrollback remains available in another buffer.\n MisTTY works well with Bash and ZSH, but it is especially well suited to running the Fish shell; you get autosuggestions, and completions in full colors. \n    submitted by    /u/DangerTadpole  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm trying to bend company to my needs. But the *completions* minibuffer pops up anyway. And when it does, it is very intrusive. It changes the layout of my frames.

He uses xterm to start other applications such as firefox.\n I use Emacs with Sway, but I was wondering if anybody here is using Emacs as a window manager without EXWM or in some deeper synergy with some other minimal window manager. I have used EXWM and I already know what are the good and what are the bad parts. So I am interested in alternative ways in which Emacs can be used as a window manager.\n Another cool concept is here: http://perma-curious.eu/repo-ewx/\n Another window manager that could integrate well with Emacs, and perhaps even re-create the EXWM experience by writing some glue code in Elisp, could be river: https://github.com/riverwm/river\n I am collecting ideas so please feel free to share how Emacs integrates or controls your window manager.\n Thank you.\n    submitted by    /u/AkiNoHotoke  \n [link]   [comments]",

Trying to follow someone else's work I figured I could create a function that changes the theme when launching org-present.

Interestingly, this applies only to 1st level menus, 2nd level menus are always rendered properly.\n Is there anything I can do to fix this issue?\n Screenshot showing the issue: https://imgur.com/a/EDodgK1 You can see that the 1st level menu is blurry while the 2nd level menu is as crisp as potato chips.\n    submitted by    /u/Shhhh_Peaceful  \n [link]   [comments]",

Afterwards I noticed the value in the brackets didn't matter, and could actually be left empty, like so:\n \"[]#000000\"\n Different themes will have different names for the main background.

          "description": "TL;DR: beOrg \"sync\"d with a workingfolder folder keeps around items from files that have been \"removed\", appears not to actually work from the data in the linked folder. (removed is in quotes because beOrg doesn't use filenames but file titles in the UI).\n More info/tests: (this may be a bug report, but hoping for a workaround)\n - Changing the /title/ of an org files results in massive dupes in the agenda. beOrg uses the title and not the filename, and it appears to screw with some local caching.\n - Unlinking the working folder doesn't change the data at all, so it's clearly operating from a separate cache. (and can't sync to remove files since you can't sync without a linked dir). So don't see a way to delete the old data and then just reparse the liked folder.\n - Can't just delete the file in question from beOrgs files (and then readd) since then it wants to remove it from the repo also. Using titles to operate on files is a really bad idea it appears.\n - Syncing doesn't seem to sync, it just adds. \n - Since the issue is with the title and not filename I have no clue how to remove the old refs, since you can't delete the old file or anything.\n - I would anticipate similar problems with any reorg/refiling of items across files since it seems a totally non-destructive sync.\n ​\n So, does anyone have any ideas if there is a setting hidden somewhere? The next step would be uninstall/kill cache and see how it goes, but that's really no good since I like to be able to (re)organize my data. Just archiving seems like it would make beOrg break.\n Thanks for any tips or help.

I dread and procrastinate working with other tools, no matter how good otherwise.

I don't do well with video learning. Scanning back and forth in a video to review info is like hunting around for menus and dialog boxes; it wears me out.

This is to become our reading file, in which Margot and I are supposed to note down the books we’ve read, the author and the date.\n\n\nNiklas Luhmann (December 8, 1927-1998), famous for his own 90,000+ slip reading file, was a year and a half older than Anne Frank (June 12, 1929-1945) who received her first card index file in February 1943 (likely between the 27th, the date of her diary entry mentioning it and the prior diary entry on February 5th). It was given to her by her father at the age of 13. As would have been commonplace, she was intended to use it as a \"reading file\" to note down the books she'd read along with the author and the date.\nOne can only wonder at how many entries she would have made over the span of her life had it not come to such an abrupt end.\nFrank, Anne.

What are your personal views on AI, specifically ChatGPT and related models, in relation to how we engage with knowledge and conduct research?\nRecently, I had the opportunity to work with ChatGPT-4. I've been inputting numerous academic papers for analysis and summarization. From my perspective, this is one of its most valuable applications. I'm exploring worlds of CFS and Fibromyalgia, and as someone who isn't currently in academia (though I have past experience), ChatGPT has empowered me to undertake my own research. I believe I can do so reliably, evaluating various sources to draw practical, science-based conclusions.

This deserves to be imitated by scholars. First it should be entered in a book in which I record everything as I see it or as it is given to me in my thoughts; then it may be entered in another book in which the material is more separated and ordered, and the ledger might then contain, in an ordered expression, the connection sand explanations of the material that flow from it.…",
