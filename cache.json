I'm wondering whether I should keep the event handling functions (most importantly onTick) pure, or if I should allow the users to execute some effects in them (by placing onTick into some kind of monad, probably IO). \n I think an effect-less onTick will do most of the time, but I wouldn't like to limit the users of my library (my students) too much. I wonder what the design best practices regarding this are.\n EDIT: So far the best option I could think of is to make my own monad — probably a derivative of state, given that the event handlers are basically just state functions — so that I will be able to add functionality to it should the need arise.

Let me try to explain it with an example.\n Let's say I typed following via ghci:\n Prelude> double x = x + x Prelude> double 10 20 Prelude> 10 * 5 50 \n Now, when I press up arrow key I should see and I do see\n Prelude> 10 * 5 \n But if I press up arrow key once more I should see\n Prelude> double 10 \n but what I actually see is following\n Prelude> 10 * double 10 \n if I press up arrow key once more, this is what I get\n Prelude> 10 * double 1x = x + x \n It seems like ghci only remove last character but it should remove whole previous command when pressing arrow keys. It does however computes the correct code. If I press (ctrl + L) it does show correct code. (For last example it shows double x = x + x)\n Is there a fix for this? I removed and reinstalled cabal and ghc multiple times but having the same problem. I don't have same problem using stack repl.\n    submitted by    /u/adamsClonks  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I'll give a quick example of what I am talking about, first.\n You have a product type:\n  data MyProduct = MyProduct { productFoo :: Foo , productBar :: Bar , productBaz :: Baz } \n and some way to isolate each \"piece\" of that product type:\n  data SomePiece = PieceFoo Foo | PieceBar Bar | PieceBaz Baz \n With this example in mind, imagine you have a (possibly infinite) list of SomePiece, and you would like to construct a MyProduct as soon as possible. Perhaps, this means that whenever you encounter a piece in your list, you hold onto it and ignore future pieces of that type, or you possibly drop the old piece in favor of the new piece of the same type, or perform some kind of combining function on the pieces. Whenever you have all the pieces needed to construct a MyProduct, you do so and stop pulling off the list.\n Of course, you also have to take into account the possibility that the list terminates before we receive all the required pieces, so we wrap the return type in Maybe:\n  constructMyProduct :: [SomePiece] -> Maybe MyProduct constructMyProduct = undefined \n What are some good solutions to this problem? Are there any general solutions, that will work for other product types with different numbers of arguments? A library or portion of a library that focuses on this would be ideal.\n    submitted by    /u/hololeap  \n [link]   [comments]",

How could I create a Haskell type for a star location out of these two? How would it be preferable to anything C++ might do, object or structure-wise? And how could I build in the allowable angle ranges of 0 ≤ α ≤ 360 ◦ and −90 ◦ ≤ δ ≤ 90 ◦ respectively. In SQL I can restrict a field to certain allowed values, ranges. How to do this in Haskell?

          "description": "I'm pretty new to Haskell and asking myself how to solve the following problem. I have a simple data structre like this: \n data Document = Document { title :: String, content :: [String], wordCount :: Int } \n I want to have besides the default constructor where I have to provide a title and the content another one where I just have to provide the title and the content or just the title. And I also want to have a constructor function that creates out of a completely different data structure a Document. \n I find it pretty nasty to name all these constructor functions differently. Especially since I encountered this problem with a lot of different data structures. So I decided to use ad-hoc polymorphism provided by a generic type-class: \n class Factory a b where create :: a -> b \n Which I use like this: \n instance Factory String ([String] -> Document) where create title words = Document { title = title, words = words, wordCount = 0 } instance Factory String Document where create title = Document { title = title, words = [], wordCount = 0 } instance Factory RawDocument Document where create RawDocument{..} = create title (splitOn \" \" content) \n Now I can use simply the create function everywhere with the defined input types. And it scales nicely with all my data structures. \n Do you see any problems with this approach? I'm really not sure if I'm missing something. \n I'm just facing one problem:\n - Either I define the factories in the same module as the data structure, but then I need to live with the name shadowing warnings for values like title and words (I would hate to name them differently since they describe the same thing)\n - Or I have a separate Factory-Module but then I have to live with the orphan instance warnings. Which is also pretty nasty \n What do you recommend?\n    submitted by    /u/thebt995  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm trying to insert links from my pandoc-compiled lhs pages to the raw lhs. The natural way to do that is to have a context field that gives the URL to the raw version.\n To accomplish that, I thought it would be good to define a new type of field. I was aiming for something like urlField. Here's what I ended up with, which is working:\n -- | Create a field that is the URL to the given version of the current item -- or non-existent (suitable for use in @$if(...)$@) if there is no such -- version. versionedUrlField :: String -- ^ version -> String -- ^ key -> Context a versionedUrlField version key = field key $ \\i -> let empty' = fail $ \"Cannot find routed \\\"\" ++ version ++ \"\\\" version for item \" ++ show (itemIdentifier i) lhsFilePathCompiler = (getUnderlying >>= (load . setVersion (Just version) :: Identifier -> Compiler (Item String)) >>= getRoute . itemIdentifier) in maybe empty' toUrl <$> lhsFilePathCompiler \n The strange part of this is the explicit type given to load . setVersion (Just version). I'd like this code to work regardless of how the resource I'm loading was compiled, but ghci does not seem to be able to give me the appropriate type make this polymorphic, and I'm not sure what it is, either, if it's even feasible.\n Alternatively, I'm very open to \"here's a much better way to accomplish the same than your versionedUrlField function\" :)\n (If anyone wants to use this as is, feel free. However, if you're using a copyFileCompiler or the like for your versioned file, you will either want to change the explicit type above or replace just copyFileCompiler with copyFileCompiler >>= getResourceString, both of which feel gross.)\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/steve_wolfman  \n [link]   [comments]",

I want to stay away from series for the time being, i.e., keep them separate.\n Here's one Haskell sequence (with a bit of example here), and here's another. These seem to be completely different. I'm looking at Tom Apostol's Calculus and his short bit on sequences, also SICP, and both have examples of limits of sequences, i.e., long sequences. This seems to be about streams, so I'm guessing the second Data.Containers.Sequence is more germane?\n Somewhere I found this:\n A geometric sequence (or progression) is a sequence of elements from an ordered,numeric type (i.e., a member of both classes Ord and Num) such that consecutive elements have a fixed ratio.\n geometric :: (Ord a, Num a) => a -> a -> a -> [a] geometric r m n | m > n = [] | otherwise = m : geometric r (m*r) n \n So this isn't trying to be fancy at all, it's just using lists. But then this talks about Cauchy sequences\n data Real = Cauchy { modulus :: Nat -> Nat , sequence :: Nat -> Rational } \n So this isn't list-land anymore, although I don't know what it is for or how to use it. If anyone has any wisdom or tips or insights, I'd appreciate. In general, I find the world of Haskell and numerical analysis very fragmented, hit-and-miss, like a scavenger hunt.

One element is the value of the monad, the other is the environment:\n State (val, env)\n Since the value of State is the first element of the tuple, >>= should return the first element of the tuple, like so:\n m >>= f = (\\State (x, _) -> f x) m\n This is not what's said in the book; it's just what i understand from what i know about monads. Maybe I'm wrong. And I'm certainly am, because >>= and return are defined in the book like so:\n  \ninstance Monad (State s) where\n  return x = State $ \\s -> (x,s) \n  (State h) >>= f = State $ \\s -> let (a, newState) = h s \n  (State g) = f a \n in g newState \n  \nFirst, what is that return?

How can this be, when the lambda might capture some aspects of its environment? I'd imagine a regular function is just a pointer, like in other languages, but that can't be all it is. Do lambdas dynamically allocate space for their captures, and store a pointer with the function objects, so that every function is really a function pointer plus a capture pointer, which would be null in the case of non-capturing functions?

For example, I still don't understand what should be the best way the compile and then run a program on the windows terminal. I'm not a programmer even though I can't say that I'm a beginner in computer science and I'm not used to all the compilation things on the cmd terminal (in general I use IDEs bc it is easier for me).\n I wrote a \"test.scala\" program printing the classic \"hello, world !\". On the windows terminal I wrote \"scala3-compiler test.scala\" and it compiled without problems. Then, because it seems to be impossible to run it with something like \"scala3-run test.scala\", I tried using the \"scalac\" and \"scala\" keywords but \"scalac test.scala\" didn't compile...\n I'm thinking about just loading the files in the repl to use the functions. However, I'm following scala.zone courses and they proceed in a different way to compile and run so I'm lost.\n Well I disgressed a bit from my original question : should I keep following the scala.zone courses for Scala 3 or should I try another online course ?\n    submitted by    /u/Escanargent  \n [link]   [comments]",

(Ideally returning an Option or Result - but also potentially just throwing an Exception). Does that seem idiomatic for Scala3?

Multiply by number of team members and code length / complexity times some factor f.\n Like it wasn't good enough in its original version. It's not like I put a var in.

So I didn't use this technique you like, so what? So I used a technique you disliked, so what? Etc.\n Maybe I would put up with it if metrics by which I'm judged would have anything to do with code quality, but even then, at some point actually getting things done would be nice.\n Is it like this everywhere? Or in all more functionally oriented teams? It sucks so much I'm considering leaving the language because of this. I've seen other stuff, I know it doesn't have to be like this (even if you have garden variety nitpickers and similar team members everywhere, but it's usually not this pervasive).

ZIO is still quite new and changing fast. Someone posted a video of a bug they found in Cats Effect 3 related to memory that I can't find right now but that is to say it's possible for there to be bugs in the runtime engine itself. It would be a legitimate question for my team to ask: what happens if there is a bug in the core of the runtime that we can't architect around? Is there a risk that we have to refactor a whole codebase in the future out of ZIO?\n Basically, how do I assure my team that it's stable enough to use in production? \n I know this question would come up (or should) with every dependency added to the codebase, but this is a big one. If you're using a third party JSON parsing library (e.g.) and encounter a serious bug, you have more options s.a. using a different library, writing a small library that only addresses your use case (or even just the use case where the dependency has the bug), architecting around it so the bug is not on the execution path anymore, or forking the library and fixing it if you can. With a library like ZIO where the whole app runs on top of it, you may have no choice but refactor the whole thing.\n    submitted by    /u/crpleasethanks  \n [link]   [comments]",

The src block contains the code below, in this example. When exported as html with C-c C-e h o it becomes a code block and shows the src block literally as expected.\n #+name: test #+begin_src html <img alt=\"Trulli\" src=\"https://www.w3schools.com/html/pic_trulli.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"333\"> #+end_src \n If you use the same block content as above, but put it in a export block instead, it exports the result of the code as one would expect when running C-c C-e h o, however, if you include the src block as below, it is exported literally.\n #+name: export-test #+begin_export html :noweb yes <<test>> #+end_export \n I'm quite certain that this is due to me missing something, but I've tried looking through the docs and search for a while now, so thought I might as well ask since I'm clearly missing something.\n I'm using a setupfile, so the appearance is a bit different, but makes no difference on the result here. I've tested to make sure, but aside from appearance, there's little difference. Here's a little screenshot of the code in the buffer, it is otherwise empty.\n I want to export it like you would if you had the code in the export block as html directly, as shown earlier. As far as I've found, you can't use src blocks to export the code non-literally, and I'm messing with changing the values of some code using variables, macros and the like on export. Tangling is not relevant in this case, otherwise I'd be able to do that with a src block.\n Hopefully I've explained well enough, but please do ask if you need more information!

Some of the notes are about math, others about music, others are about metalearning, and others are just technical (mostly programming and frameworks).\n So there is a great variety in the notes. They are in separated files.\n The biggest notes are the math notes. I read books and then I take notes in org format with latex math notation. Math notes also have a lot of screenshots from the book.\n The structure of my org directory is flat. The only exception is the org/img directory where I store the screenshots. Every other note is in the org/ directory.\n I would like to start using org-agenda and todo and I was wondering if I should create a separate directory for agenda such as org/agenda and keep there my todo entries.\n What do you think of this approach?\n What is your approach on structuring the org directory?\n Do you keep everything flat or you have classified your files in org sub-directories?\n Do you use separate files for each note or you have all notes in one or two files?\n I am currently using deft. Do you think org-roam is better and why?\n    submitted by    /u/kamui78  \n [link]   [comments]",

This table is filled with hundreds of words for which I've defined abbreviations and associated expansions—so many that I can't remember them all, hence this desired feature. hippie-exp.el does have the function try-expand-all-abbrevs, but this tries to expand based on typed text matching ABBREV strings in the global-abbrev-table, not the full EXPANSION strings as I desire.\n I know abbrev tables are obarrays and that try-expand-all-abbrevs works by calling abbrev-expansion to get the symbol value (i.e., the expansion) associated with the abbrev that the user typed in the buffer. How do I programatically try to match against the table's EXPANSIONS values instead of its ABBREV symbols? Is it possible to quickly create a new abbrev table from the existing global one that swaps the global one's symbols and values? Or is there another obvious function that a lisp noob like me hasn't learned?\n Thank you so much!\n EDIT: I was assuming that keeping the obarray approach was better than moving all the expansions from the abbrev table into a list, because I’ve heard lists are slower to search against than obarrays.

I think Emacs is the right tool for such a task, and it was preinstalled on the server. Though when I open a Fortran file in emacs, I find the syntax highlighting to be really weird (dark blue text over black background - completely illegible). Now I can change the theme by M-x customize-themes or M-x load-theme, but I have to do it each time I start emacs from the terminal. For instance if I make a small modification to the source, return to shell to compile, and come back to make another small modification (say correct an error) to my source file, I have to change themes twice over.\n Hence my question is basically: Where do I configure emacs to load a particular theme every time it is opened in the terminal?\n The server has GNU Emacs 24.3.1, and runs CentOS Linux release 7.1.1503 (Core). \n Thank you.\n Edit: It would be really helpful if someone could point me to a tutorial aimed at beginner for running emacs on the terminal.

          "description": "Hi all,\n Been an emacs user for a while and started to notice my emacs feel generally laggy. I use the GUI emacs on mac. It improved after i increased the gc-threshold, but some commands that i used frequently eg, windmove for moving around windows had ~1-2 sec lag which was not normal. So i started debugging and realized that if i invoked the function from M-x rather than the keybinding it was instantaneous. Then, i changed the keybinding of windmove from 'C-c b' to 'C-c C-b' and the lag was gone. After that i noticed this is happening for a lot of my commands (swiper/ ivy switch buffer etc). \n ​\n Why is one particular keybinding inducing noticeable lag, but the other keybinding on the same function is super fast. I've never seen anything like this and found nothing on google search. M-x profiler is also not helpful. Ideally I'd like to keep the same keybindings i have but not have this lag. Can anyone help me figure out what is going on here. Thanks.\n    submitted by    /u/stocky_stockinder  \n [link]   [comments]",

Now when I use a completion display package such as Vertico, I tend to use \"enter\" to validate my choice in the visual list. If I use \"enter\", it \"activates\" the choice: if I choose a file it opens it; if I choose a directory it explores it with dired.\n I don't like that. When I choose a directory, I actually want to go inside it to continue my search of r a file; I don't want to open a directory (I almost never used dired). So is there a way to tell find-file or the completion frameworks = \"hitting enter on a directory names should be interpreted as hitting tab on the directory name\".\n I know I could fix my muscle memory, but using \"enter on a list\" is so universal that well, I'd prefer my emacs to be set up my way.\n The closest find I found is : (setq find-file-run-dired nil).

(They show in list-processes and process-attributes show them with zombie status. This ends up causing problems with launching subsequent sync operations).\n After doing some further testing, it seems this is the case for all sub-processes launched in emacs with my setup. For example, launching a simple process that just sleeps for 20 and exits:\n (start-process \"my-process\" \"foo\" \"sleep\" \"20\") \n This process continues to show under list-processes well after it has exited. It's attributes also show that it is a zombie process. \n Digging in further, the docs say that the variable delete-exited-processes controls whether or not these get cleaned up. It is set to t. So I would assume these should be getting cleaned. Yet looking further into the list-processes function, it seems to clean up processes that have a state of exit, signal or closed, which makes sense. \n Yet in my testing above with the sleep process, it is showing with a state of run (despite that fact the the process has exited and the attributes show it as a zombie).\n So it seems that even when processes are exiting normally, they never switch into the exit or closed state, become zombies, and never get cleaned up by emacs. \n A bit in the weeds here, but was curious if someone has any insight into what is happening? \n Emacs: 28.0.50, 2021-08-28\n Linux 5.13.12\n    submitted by    /u/gdr3941  \n [link]   [comments]",

So I thought to switch from dwm to EXWM, but I never used emacs, I'm learning it now, that's quite easy. The thing that most impressed me besides emacs in itself was the Lisp language, such a cool language!\n I switched from Windows to Linux because it is more flexible and it lets you customize a lot of things. I wish to have a Dynamic OS, but with Tilling Window Manager like dwm It is a tough task to achieve, so maybe EXWM + Emacs can do what I want.\n But before I dive into the emacs world I have a few questions:\n Can I have a statusbar integrated with modeline likes this:\n https://preview.redd.it/s6wkhsea65k71.png?width=1047&format=png&auto=webp&s=7d4846e51146409e7d25a78866773027c67e44e2\n Can I have custom mini-buffers that does stuff like show a playlist of music/videos and support custom formatting style and images?\n Can I have an image frame in different workspaces as background and still be able to write text? Its similar to the concept of setting a wallpaper with feh or hsetroot and make emacs transparent, but on emacs buffers instead on the X11 thing. There are some DEs that allow you to have different wallpapers per workspace.\n I know I can intercept a function call and adds other funcionality, like change the wallpaper with hsetroot. But doing like that I would see my wallpapers behind the emacs, I want to see like if I had spawned sxiv in a buffer with EXWM.\n Since emacs is a GUI application, I believe all of this is possible. I don't care If I will have to write 1000 lines of e-lisp or more, if this is possible, I will do my best to accomplish it.\n    submitted by    /u/Inphynithus  \n [link]   [comments]",

I used to use thunderbird, and with the lightning extension I got a very clear, graphical interface for planning out my week (synced using a google calendar) and adjusting the time-blocks dynamically during the week.\n I recently moved to mu4e and in terms of emails, it is absolutely and utterly fantastic. However, I have not been able to find a good planning replacement. I know and use org-gcal which is very good in terms of syncing with google calendar. However, I really miss the ease with which I could view my time-blocks. org-gcal has a weekly view mode, but it does not have any way of showing 'blocks' of time - every event is just a single line (which often doesn't fit in the column).\n I know the emacs universe is too vast for any one person to know and try all the packages. So, I would like to ask for tips and suggestions from people on here. If you time-block using emacs and would like to share how you go about doing it, I'd be very interested to know.\n Cheers\n    submitted by    /u/MrEyff  \n [link]   [comments]",

The emphasis is on you, I'd like to hear how you make presentations.\n My go-to way of making presentations right now is Org-mode exporting to Beamer. Howerver, I do like to mess with commands like pause, onslide, only, and alert<n> which just is a big pain to do in Org-mode. I have come to the point that if a slide is even remotely complex I just only write the heading in Org-mode itself and then BEGIN_EXPORT latex the rest inside latex. It works, but it is far from ideal. For example, setting up columns in Org-mode is really cumbersome.\n Anything that works better? I need the Tex Math, but any other tool that can render my Tex equations would be nice. The only thing I really miss about WYSIWYG editing like powerpoint is adding annotations such as arrows; it is just a big pain having to define these coordinates vs the drag and drop.\n    submitted by    /u/Dank-memes-here  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "TLDR: What's the easiest way of tracking the value of an org statistics cookie through a git commit tree?\n Background\n I use org-mode and git to track my reading habits. I have a document tree with a heading for each book, and three possible todo states: TBR, Read and DNF. The document is thus structured as follows:\n * Books [X/Y] ** TBR Title 1 ** Read Title 2 ** DNF Title 3 \n The value of X is the count of how many titles below it are marked Read, while the value of Y is the count of how many values are marked either Read or TBR. DNFs don't enter into the statistics at all.\n With this document, I sometimes add new books to be read, and when I've read a book, I switch the todo status from TBR to Read. If I try the book and don't want to finish for one reason or another, I mark it DNF.\n The document is version controlled, so I can go back and see how the list has changed with time. I thought it might be fun to try and plot how the size of the list of books has changed with time, but I don't know how to automatically extract the statistics cookie for each commit.\n Any suggestions?\n    submitted by    /u/CutOnBumInBandHere9  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'd like to extend this to relations (i.e., no restriction that a single arrow departs a particular domain element).\nWorking with math in my zettelkasten has been interesting. The only difficulty has been with diagrams etc.  I've found that working mainly physically and scanning the images and cleaning the text digitally has been a nice process without much overhead.\nProofs and particularly the elements of subproofs are natural since linking can double as both relation and implication; likewise examination of backlinks can be useful for examining assumptions / presuppositions.\nIn summary, its working reasonably well, I just need to work physically first, then transfer to digital.\nAny shared experiences re mathematics research in your zettelkasten would be great.\nFor anyone with a combinatorial or number-theoretic bent, here is a newly discovered sequence of numbers generated by the main algorithm of my paper at the encyclopedia of integer sequences. https://oeis.org/A335725",

So if you have a particularly well-formed note with lots of notation, then I've found this method can work out fine in the short-term.  The most important items -- by trial and error -- from above are 5 6 and 7 so as to preserve the ability to search, link, and see a short summary.\nWorkflow: Digital to Physical (perhaps this is a bit obsessive)\nAt the end of each day collect the digitally created zettels from that day (easy with timestamp ID)\nPrint them out 2-per page and cut in half\nAdd to physical slipbox\nAlways maintain a printed copy of any index or structure notes.\nNow you have a synchronized digital and physical slipbox.

Usually I jot down things in bullet points as I read with a text. But this has been causing some issues. The actual writing takes a bit, and can be enough to get me out of the flow of reading. This usually leads to frustration as I try to write as fast as I am thinking, resulting in a barely legible scrawl. Either that or I take very few notes as I try to stay engaged with the reading material So, I wonder, am I taking notes too often? Should I wait until I am done with a certain section before jotting down ideas? The mental block I have there is that I will forget what I wanted to write down by the time I get to a stopping point.\nMaybe it is not the frequency of notes, but the medium. Or maybe both. I have tried using a computer, and that does help with speed somewhat. However, that works best with digital texts, and I mostly read printed ones. Another approach I have thought of is using index cards. That does make processing later a bit easier, and you can group notes freely to see relations, but it can also get messy. What are your thoughts on using a computer for notes? Index cards?\nMy goal is to have a system where I can read fluidly while writing down things I would like to process later.

          "description": "This is a little insight that came to that I think might be helpful for some. Please let me know what you think.\nIf you have a Zettelkasten, you need to constantly create Zettels so it grows to give you richer connections. A day in a Zettler usually looks like this:\nCreate Zettels and make connections.\nRead sources.\nProofread Zettels.\nHowever, you need to manage the overall process so working with a Zettelkasten doesn't become all you do everyday. E.g.: In the worst case scenario, you'd spend the entire morning, afternoon, and evening creating Zettels, reading, and proofreading respectively. That gives you no time for anything else!\nThe part of the process to manage is reading time because everything else depends on it. E.g.: If you don't read, you can't create Zettels, and without Zettels, there's nothing to proofread.\nI think that we can manage reading time in the same way that we adapt the routine of short knowledge cycles:\nStart with 1 hour of reading.\nRead, create Zettels, and proofread. Keep track of the time spent on each activity.\nReflect on the overall process.\nBased on your reflection, change the time alloted for reading.\nRepeat steps 2 through 4 until you reach a point where you are satisfied with the work you do for your Zettelkasten, and don't lose time for other things in your day.",

          "description": "On my quest to start a Zettelkasten, I found that most Zettelkasten tools (listed here and on reddit) have no support for hierarchies. With that I mean, methods for promoting/demoting notes in a hierarchy or folding a lower level to reduce distraction.\nIn Luhmann's paper, this aspect seemed really important to him. And I can see how adding lower-level notes helps to keep notes simple and atomic. (Example: notes on cities are listed under notes for countries.)\nAs I am just starting with the Zettelkasten, I am worried that a non-hiearchical note list will become very confusing quickly. So, how are more experienced people handling this? Did you find software that does handle hierarchies well? Or, do you use summary notes and then link the individual parts?\nWould be great to have your insight!",

There is a difference, a sliding scale, a spectrum in ZK work focused on literature, just as there is a spectrum of other types of \"X-driven ZK work.\" Moving my skills \"up\" the scales is a goal, and it is always possible to move on the scale. I have to be vigilant that I don't backslide. Thinking and writing about the processes used in ZK work help clarify meaning. Some processes are counterproductive to our goals and there is a good chance we are blind to this - from @Will comment here\n\n\nHow would you rank the different tasks in terms of their utility to your zettelkasten? Here is my current ranking from top (highest utility) to bottom\nCreating Combinations of Ideas\nCreating Variations of Ideas\nCreating Nonobvious Connections (e.g. conceptual connections)\nReformulating Ideas from Literature\nAdding Notes to a Structure Note\nCreating Connections based on Keywords (Obvious Connections)\nCopying and Pasting Ideas from Literature\nUnsure: \n* Creating Metacognitive Knowledge not for yourself, but for the zettelkasten\n* Clarifying Notes\n* Organizing Old Notes",
