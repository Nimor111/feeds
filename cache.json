In short Show a => a -> String is transform internally to Dict a -> a -> String.\n I have a discussion on discourse where people consider this extra parameter as part of the function: Show a -> a -> String has TWO parameters.\n My intuition is that this extra parameter is only the result of an implementtaion choice. An hypotetical compiler could work back from the main an instantiate all functions with required types. Therefore passing a class dictionaly might be needed for practical reason but not in theory.\n Am I right or is dictionary passin the only way to implement typeclass in Haskell ?\n    submitted by    /u/maxigit  \n [link]   [comments]",

Conceptually it makes sense to associate both inputs and outputs with a Partner. Also, some of the outputs are both important on their own and as inputs to later parts of the calculation.\n My question is: how do I architect this in Haskell? I can imagine having a big Partner record type that has a field for each input and each output. The downside of this is I'd have to initialize it with empty values for all the outputs. Would I then make those a Maybe type? That might get annoying.\n Do I instead define a separate type for each new output as it's calculated? Say we start with just a PartnerInput object that only holds the inputs. Then we calculate the first output and put the result in a PartnerInputAndFirstOutput object. I.e. the first function has type PartnerInput -> PartnerInputAndFirstOutput. Then the next function has type PartnerInputAndFirstOutput -> PartnerInputAndSecondOutput, and so on. Intuitively this feels silly.\n Like any good Haskeller I want to use the type system to help guarantee the correctness of my code, but I can't figure out how in this case.

Consider the following example: \n {-# LANGUAGE GADTSyntax #-} import Data.Kind (Type) data Foo :: Type where Bar1 :: {f :: String, g :: Integer} -> Foo Bar2 :: {f :: String, g :: Integer, h :: Double, l :: Double} -> Foo deriving (Eq) \n ​\n Bar1 and Bar2 have a common \"core\" (f and g), but Bar2 extends on it by adding the fields h and l. In the way I see it, it makes functions that deal with Foo a little more of a hassle to write, since the fields f and h wouldn't be total for all values of Foo, making me resort to the Either and/or Maybe monads. \n One way to avoid this would be turning Foo into a typeclass that abstract the common features of Bar1 and Bar2 and turning Bar1 and Bar2 themselves into types.\n The downside would be that I wouldn't be able to use pattern matching as easily and it would be harder to rely on the compiler to tell me when functions don't deal with all the possible values in the domain of Foo. Also, things that I could do to both constructors at once (like deriving an Ord instance for both of them) would be alot more verbose to do. And, if I decided to collect them in some sort of list, I would have to deal with heterogeneously typed lists.\n ​\n Anyway, maybe this is too much of a beginner question, but I'd like to hear from you possible ideas to solve this.\n    submitted by    /u/ComunistCapybara  \n [link]   [comments]",

In particular, the Curry-Howard isomorphism really caught my interest, but I need help to know if I'm getting it correctly. What I've understood is that we can prove mathematical theorems through CH, for example to prove that a * 1 = a we just need to show that there is an isomorphism (hence, 2 functions that are one the inverse of the other) between (a, ()) and a. This gave me chills, so I wanted to try this way of reasoning with a theorem for natural numbers, but I'm stuck. In particular, I would like to prove that given two natural numbers m,n the GCD of m,n is the same as the GCD of (m mod n) and n. Again, here there is an equality so I think I would have to show there is an isomorphism between the two things. But I can't really imagine how to translate something like that in Haskell, and I'm not even sure if this is actually possible.\n P.S. As a side note, I also wanted to prove that there is no isomorphism between a set X and its power set, but imagining to prove that something doesn't exist with CH is even more complicated for me.\n    submitted by    /u/asshole_books_nerd  \n [link]   [comments]",

Barring any changes, I plan to officially submit the proposal to the Haskell Foundation on Monday, and I am now asking for any last feedback, opinions, thoughts, and criticisms that anyone might want to sneak in at the last moment.\n  \nProject update\n In addition to the proposal itself, we have the following updates to the libraries themselves as well:\n  \nGood progress has been made on Botan.Low.Cipher, which is now properly complete\n Unit tests for Botan.Low.Cipher\n Unit tests revealed that botan_cipher_output_length is inaccurate / flawed\n Corrected buffer estimate functions have been implemented to replace it\n Implemented offline / one-shot and online / incremental encryption\n Online encryption should be much more performant since you can stream the data instead of having to load it all at once\n Some cipher algorithms (SIV, CCM) are not online-capable, and their unit tests fail for the moment, but that is expected behavior (better organized unit tests will fix this)\n  \n You can follow the project devlog on discourse!\n    submitted by    /u/ApothecaLabs  \n [link]   [comments]",

I've completed two or three beginner-level books, but I still find it challenging to write full-fledged Haskell apps. Simultaneously, I've been dabbling a bit with Rust.\n My dilemma is that I lack sufficient experience and a deep understanding of the philosophies of these two languages to make an informed choice on where to invest my time. I've tried both, but I feel that I won't be able to make an effective comparison without creating a larger project in each (for which currently I have no time unfortunately).\n I'm love Haskell's purity, abstractions, and expressiveness and at the same time I find memory management in Rust to be a bit of a pain. However I've noticed many people transitioning from Haskell to Rust, and that Rust ecosystem is much more lively and it's causing me to wonder if Haskell is slowly falling out of favor.\n The response I've seen several times is that Haskell is worth it for it's educational aspect, but I'm interested in more practical side of things. Is there anybody who thinks that Haskell is better then Rust for real world applications?\n From my current perspective, Rust doesn't seem like a direct replacement for Haskell. I'm not sure how to incorporate the functional style I love into Rust. Could this just be a lack of expertise on my part? Would I eventually be able to write Rust in a way that captures what I like about Haskell?\n I'm aware this topic has been discussed many times in various forums, but I still can't shake the feeling that focusing on Haskell might not be a worthwhile investment. Would it be more reasonable to spend time gaining a deeper understanding of Rust?\n Any insights from those with broader experience in both languages would be greatly appreciated.\n    submitted by    /u/Only-Stable-3126  \n [link]   [comments]",

Asking on this sub because it has lots of people who probably know a lot about type theory.\n It seems to me that in Smalltalk, Common Lisp, and other languages that treats classes as objects at runtime, we basically get all three things one can get in lambda cube. A message to create a subclass is a type dependent on type; all generic functions/messages are terms dependent on type; to achieve type dependent on term we basically just write a method that calls type constructors based on input term. Essentially, by treating types (classes) as runtime values (objects), we basically make them first class and get everything from reflection. If one doesn't like nominal subtyping, we can also achieve similar expressive power by supporting \"algebraic classes\" at runtime.\n Given that there are so many research into making more expressive type systems, I suppose that there’s probably a lot of other things that I haven’t thought about. Other than guaranteeing termination or improving performance of programs, what are some benefits of a powerful static type system over the runtime first class type approach I mentioned above?\n    submitted by    /u/ghc--  \n [link]   [comments]",

It is performing (implicit?) recursion on the left and right nodes and getting the max depth. I have come to realize that in python or other languages, depth Leaf = 0 would basically just be an if-statement which is a base case.\n But in Haskell, in this context, it is referred to as pattern matching as far as I'm concerned. So what is pattern matching really? And how does this code differ from me writing a simple if-statement?\n In Haskell does \"=\" have more meaning than just defining a value? Does it represent anything else?\n My interpretation of the code above is.\n // takes in a BinTree object depth :: BinTree a -> Int // If the BinTree so happens to be a leaf, return 0 depth Leaf = 0 // Else perform recursion on left and right depth (Node _ left right) = max (depth left) (depth right) \n So what really is Pattern Matching doing here?\n    submitted by    /u/Alarming_Ad_9103  \n [link]   [comments]",

The assignment is to render a variety of shapes through mouse and keyboard interaction in CodeWorld API. For example, one of the shapes is a \"Line\" which requires the user to draw a line in CodeWorld by \"clicking\" the screen to set the initial point and \" releasing \" the mouse to set the final point, and drawing a line between those 2 points.\n I have succeeded in rendering the shapes in CodeWorld, but the final element requires some more complex elements that I have no idea how to approach. The final functions require a user to press the arrow buttons on a keyboard to change the rotation and 'stretch' of a semiCircle and an ellipse. The rules are as following:\n ↑ (key) Rotates sem…",

However, apparently most of it is in Scala, and my programming experience is already very limited to basically only some beginner Python.\n How doable would it be to use The Guardian's code as a base to create something similar myself, given this background?

Even once I found a 3rd party library it wasn't 1-to-1 compatible tojava.time (for example had a different set of ZoneIds). It took some digging and trial and error (and testing stuff in run-time because these were Java dependencies).\n This experience got me thinking what else is in common use that should become part of the Scala API to be JVM agnostic? There's a sentiment lately that Scala shouldn't rely strictly on the JVM (can be seen here and there in the comments, JdG wrote about it) so perhaps making a standard for common APIs would help porters target only Scala and not create Java shims to the entire Java API.\n    submitted by    /u/codecatmitzi  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I would like to collect opinions from fellow Scala users.\n Given my experience in Scala it would be unfair not to provide my point of view so here it is:\n ​\n killer features:\n - domain modelling and processing: sealed hierarchies, type aliases, opaque types, pattern matching (Kotlin and especially Java falls behind)\n - contextual abstractions (unrivaled however there is little public knowledge on how to cook them properly)\n - DSLs (custom operators and occasional macro only, smart interpolation is landing in Java while Kotlin has functions with receiver type)\n - Innovations and other unique features (cool but hard to sell for commercial development)\n ​\n no-longer-killer features:\n - collections: Kotlin does it well, maybe even better (simpler hierarchy, faster, more helper methods on collections)\n - asynchronous/scalable code: project Loom does it better (however there are no established practices/usage patterns/libraries yet)\n - functional programming: practical parts have been absorbed by other languages, impractical are still plaguing Scala codebases.\n ​\n other stuff:\n - cats/ZIO/TF: imo requires too much effort with little gain unless writing complicated fiber interactions.\n - typeclasses: good for adapt-for-everything libraries, rarely seen in production code where abstracting over single specific type usually adds more complexity instead of reducing it.\n - HKT: GADTs? Never seen them in production code.\n - compile-time code generation: controversial. Can be enabler for unique code features (e.g. logging without org.slf4j.Logger instances or smart asserts) but is nightmare to develop, test and support.

          "description": "Hello, I learned about Scala around 2 years ago and started actively learning it 1 year ago. Reading books, watching talks from Daniel Spiewak, John De Goes, and Rock the JVM.\n In my current job, I write Golang and Typescript, both on a massive microservices architecture that serves 7-digit devices, and have around 2 years of experience. I know the typelevel stack and can write/read Scala without a problem. Played around with Spark, Actors, and Akka HTTP too, so I guess I can orient myself in the ecosystem on what does what. I also have a bachelor's degree in tech/design.\n I read here that you shouldn't learn Scala because finding a job is very unlikely in some countries. So I knew beforehand, anyways I started my job hunt in Belgium. It has to be a permanent job and not too far away (1 hour 20min drive will do) or fully remote.\n So far I have found 3 companies: one paused the hiring, the other one only had one backend developer with 2 years of experience, and the last one I received no email, but they did view my LinkedIn.\n Either I become a data engineer and maybe I'll have another 5 companies I can apply to and will probably get no answer since I don't have a relevant master's degree or relevant experience. Or I start doing something else.\n Scala made me a better developer and taught me a lot so no regrets there. But what's the next best step forward? Should I get a job in Java (never written Java before) which will in the future improve my chances of landing a Scala position? Or should I hop on the Golang hype train? Of course, this greatly depends on the country. Here in my country, it is mainly .NET, Java, and Typescript. \n There surely have been others of you that experienced this, What did you do?\n    submitted by    /u/FuzzCod  \n [link]   [comments]",

Make org-mode pick-up TODO states from org-mode headings appearing in .md files with otherwise md syntax (*** TODO Read this, somewhere in md file) and show it in agenda. 3.

Prior to this when I was on windows I used obsidian for that purpose. \n I really liked the philosophy behind obsidian and bidirectional linking. However, ever since I started using Linux I feel the need of avoiding closed source applications. I've seen people use OrgMode and I believe I really like the extensibility. I also like the TODO/scheduling features of OrgMode and the Android app that syncs with it. For that I use calcurse atm. \n I want to use Emacs solely for the purpose of using OrgRoam alone. That's it. I don't want to go down another rabbit hole of configuration and tinkering (the previous ones being neovim, sway, kitty and gnome in order of recency). I need vim keybinds, a decent syntax highlighting for orgmode, git version control and a dark low contrast colouscheme. I believe OrgMode can already do what markdown does and probably better, so no worries there. \n What is the best plan of action for this?

          "description": "Crosspost of:\n https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/16gzmmi/orgwindowhabit_an_alternative_habit_system_based/?sort=new\n I've always found that the built in habit tracking provided by org-mode that is based on repeaters is less than ideal for capturing anything other than the notion of repeating something at some fixed interval (typically daily).\n The way that I think most people think about non-daily habits is that they ought to be completed some number of times within a certain window. For example, you might set the goal of doing some form of cardiovascular exercise at least 4 times a week.\n org-window-habit Allows you to do exactly this. Instead of relying on org repeaters (or even the habit flavored org repeaters), it uses properties from the org drawer to understand the constraints the user would like to have around their habit. To explain how this is useful, I'll return to the 4 days a week example from above. If you wanted to give yourself some leeway within an individual week (life happens), but still wanted to ensure that in the long term you are conforming to your goal of 4 repetitions a week, you might do something like specify a short term window where 3 repetitions are required in a single week, but 16 repetitions are required within any 4 week period. This would allow you to require that you're never completely falling off the wagon with your habit, but also that you can do a bit of makeup/slowdown, as long as you are roughly hitting your goal when you zoom out enough.\n For more details, take a look at the README, but also be aware that even more customization is available (take a look at the source code if you are so inclined). If it seems that people in the community are interested in this sort of habit tracking I'm happy to document even more details about how this package works, but at this point, I want to evaluate whether or not people are interested in using it before I put more work into it.\n    submitted by    /u/IvanMalison  \n [link]   [comments]",

Ideally, I would just replace the text of the title, and leave the other properties (todo, priority, tags) in place. \n The code below instead rebuilds the whole headline by first gathering the properties, building a new title string, and then re-inserting it in the buffer.\n I am wondering if there is a simpler/smarter way\n  (save-excursion (org-back-to-heading t) (let* ((point (point)) (todo (org-entry-get point \"TODO\")) (priority (org-entry-get point \"PRIORITY\")) (tags (org-entry-get point \"TAGS\")) (title (concat (make-string (org-outline-level) ?*) \" \" (cl-destructuring-bind (title-comps title-format) (mv/org-get-title-info) (mv/format-section-title title-format (mv/org-collect-section-properties% title-comps point)))))) (delete-region (point) (line-end-position)) (insert title) (when tags (org-set-tags tags)) (when todo (let ((current-prefix-arg 0)) (org-todo todo))) (unless (char-equal (aref priority 0) org-default-priority) (org-priority priority)))) \n What the code is doing, is as follows\n  \nExtract todo, priority, tag info\n Build the new title along with leading `*` \n Delete the title line, and insert the new one\n Re-assign todo, priority and tags.\n  \nIt is working so-so. Still has rough edges.\n My question is: Does org.el have code that will allow me to replace the title in place? I could define my own regexp to do it.

          "description": "When using the %\\N escape code in a capture template, is it possible to modify the value prior to having it inserted into the capture buffer?\n My use case is the creation of a headline where I prompt once for a person's name, but then insert it twice: once into the main headline text, and once as a tag. Something like this:\n (\"m\" \"meeting\" entry (file+olp \"~/org/logbook.org\" \"MEETINGS\") \"* MEETING with %^{Person?}\\t:%\\\\1:meeting:\\n%?\" ) \n And that's fine if I respond to the \"Person?\" prompt with just the person's first name. So responding \"John\" gives me something like this:\n * MEETING with John :John:meeting: \n The problem is, the person's name is usually two space-separated words, and spaces aren't allowed in tags. So if I respond to the \"Person?\" prompt with \"John Smith\", I get something like this:\n * MEETING with John :John Smith:meeting: \n with the tags being broken.\n At the moment I have a kludgy workaround where I simply prompt for the name a second time, and I respond to that with a tag-acceptable version. Something like:\n (\"m\" \"meeting\" entry (file+olp \"~/org/logbook.org\" \"MEETINGS\") \"* MEETING with %^{Person?}\\t:%^{PersonAsTag?}:meeting:\\n%?\" ) \n So when prompted for \"PersonAsTag?\" I'll respond with \"john_smith\" (but \"JohnSmith\" would work just as well) to get:\n * MEETING with John Smith :john_smith:meeting: \n But it is, as I say, kludgy. So, is there any way to munge what I get from %\\1 prior to it being dropped in as a tag?\n    submitted by    /u/TeeMcBee  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello Emacs users, I'm currently trying to re-do my own emacs configuration but after facing thousands of issues, indenting buffers is the one thing that's going to turn me bald in a matter of hours.\n I'm trying to work with multiple languages, Go, Rust, Python, JS/TS, etc. The one thing I haven't figured out correctly is proper indentation without having to do keyboard gymnastics. I know that Emacs is more of a DIY thing, so any light shed here would be of great help. \n I've already tried (add-hook …), using the :config section in my (use-package go-mode) declarations and more but none of them are having any visible effect. \n Furthermore, I saw this issue with Go and I heavily suspect other programming languages won't come out as clean as I think. \n Every time I edit a Go file, when adding a new line to anything that needs indentation (e.g: a function body, if, for, etc.) Two “4 spaces” tabs are inserted no matter what. Even when I press the <TAB> key I have to backspace ALWAYS, also some closing delimiters like }) don't align properly, but I suspect that's another issue maybe fixed by puni.\n ​\n The “best” thing I could do to prevent newlines from getting messed up on creation was turning off electric-indent, I've heard mixed opinions on that, some say it's great, some say it's terrible, I don't really know. Without electric-indent I don't have to backspace two tabs on a newline, but TAB still creates those two tabs, even when my modeline reports (TABx4). Here is a snippet of the important stuff in my configuration file. \n (setq-default c-basic-offset 4 tab-width 4 indent-tabs-mode t standard-indent 4) ;; jsjsjsjs (electric-pair-mode 1) ;; Disable electric-indent messing up my code >:( (setq electric-indent-inhibit t electric-indent-mode nil) \n If any of you could spare your elisp-fu powers to me, I would be extremely thankful.

On a basic level I'm thinking of things like auto capitalizing sentences after. Or some kind of English friendly hippie expand to auto complete words using context. In the dream version maybe you can occasionally dictate words and then feed that through Local LLM to fix up the inevitable problems. Also, personally, something like a super abbreviation module that was great at auto completing words or guessing it words only using the left side of a split keyboard.\n The ultimate irony here is I'd love to take on some of these projects myself, but I can't effectively type anymore. Sad panda. After a few days of rest I'm able to test new keyboard, I got excited for a few hours, and then spend the rest of the day watching the pain in my right forearm intensify.

          "description": "Hey fellow org-mode enthusiasts,\n I'm currently working on customizing my org-mode setup, and I've run into a little snag with Treemacs. I would like to have Treemacs display the #+title:property of my org files instead of the file name in the directory tree.\n I've scoured the documentation and tried various configurations, but I haven't been able to achieve this. Has anyone successfully done this before or has any ideas on how to accomplish it?\n Here's an example of what I mean:\n org code:\n #+TITLE: Project XYZ * My Awesome Project ** Task 1 ** Task 2 \n In Treemacs, instead of seeing \"My_Project.org,\" I would like it to display \"Project XYZ\" for that entry.\n The reason that i ask for this is that i am using OrgRoam and the file names start with a pretty large id.\n Any guidance, tips, or even pointing me in the right direction would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance!\n    submitted by    /u/Silarium  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "A few days ago my package llm was added to GNU ELPA. This package isn't for end-users, it's for others who are writing llm-based functionality to do so in a way that is agnostic of the llm backend. That way the user can use the LLM they have access to. LLMs are \"large language models\", very large systems that are able to deal with natural language with surprising naturalness.\n To start, we provide functionality for creating embeddings, and for LLM chat, in both sync and async versions. There are only two providers to start with: Open AI and Google Cloud Vertex. There's obviously more that are possible, such as Anthropic's API, or Llama 2.\n The difficulties with providing an interface to Llama 2, by the way, is that there seem to be a lot of different ways to install and use it, so it isn't clear that there's a good interface I could provide that would be widely useful. But it's pretty easy to write your own, and maybe I'll provide an interface that just goes to some command-line utility and executes it.\n If you are an author of a package that does something with LLMs, I'd encourage you to use this package, so your users can have some control of what backend they are using. And if you want to help expand the number of LLMs we have access to, please send a pull request if you have FSF papers. This is a GNU project, so FSF papers are required for substantial contributions.\n    submitted by    /u/ahyatt  \n [link]   [comments]",

I am trying to use emacs for my personal note writing, but also I'd like to use some of those notes as slides for a presentation with org-present. I want to customize how the presentation mode looks. Trying to follow someone else's work I figured I could create a function that changes the theme when launching org-present. When writing the notes, I use leuven theme (I selected it in customize-themes, and saved to use it by default). This is nice. Now, when I do org-present, my function is called. It just does:\n (defun my_slides () (load-theme 'some_theme)) \n And effectively the background and most colors for text change, except for the headings. They are still in leuven theme. If I manually do customize-themes, then pick the theme I want to use, THEN, do org-present, then the headings appear in the theme I picked. So, what's the difference between load-theme and customize-themes-->pick one theme? How can I effectively change the theme to enter in org-present?\n Thanks in advance, any help appreciated.\n EDIT: Solved.\n u/Nawrbit's hint worked perfectly.

However, I have a minor but annoying issue with some GUI elements (namely, menus and tooltips) being blurry. They kinda look like they have been shrunk and then stretched again, if it makes any sense. Interestingly, this applies only to 1st level menus, 2nd level menus are always rendered properly.\n Is there anything I can do to fix this issue?\n Screenshot showing the issue: https://imgur.com/a/EDodgK1 You can see that the 1st level menu is blurry while the 2nd level menu is as crisp as potato chips.\n    submitted by    /u/Shhhh_Peaceful  \n [link]   [comments]",

I found the only theme that respected the terminal's background opacity was the default one, except when using kitty, so I guess you're good if you're a kitty user.\n On a whim, I opened up the theme.el for the theme I'm using, and added a value in brackets at the beginning of the rgb value for the background, like setting the alpha value for urxvt's background in ~/.Xdefaults. Afterwards I noticed the value in the brackets didn't matter, and could actually be left empty, like so:\n \"[]#000000\"\n Different themes will have different names for the main background. Luckily it was labeled \"bg-main\" on mine.\n P.S.: You have to edit the system-wide theme.el. Changing the one in ~/.local didn't work for me. Also, emacs will use whatever transparency value you have set for your terminal (like I said, the value in the brackets above does not matter).

(and can't sync to remove files since you can't sync without a linked dir). So don't see a way to delete the old data and then just reparse the liked folder.\n - Can't just delete the file in question from beOrgs files (and then readd) since then it wants to remove it from the repo also. Using titles to operate on files is a really bad idea it appears.\n - Syncing doesn't seem to sync, it just adds. \n - Since the issue is with the title and not filename I have no clue how to remove the old refs, since you can't delete the old file or anything.\n - I would anticipate similar problems with any reorg/refiling of items across files since it seems a totally non-destructive sync.\n ​\n So, does anyone have any ideas if there is a setting hidden somewhere? The next step would be uninstall/kill cache and see how it goes, but that's really no good since I like to be able to (re)organize my data.

Previously, I could do a basic password to sent SMTP. Now, I need to use oauth2 with SMTP and use the access token generated by a python script in M365-imap. (I just put this token in my .authinfo file as the password for the server and specify oauth2 as the authentication method). Problem is, this access token only works once or twice before I have to regenerate it.\n The M365-imap page gives an example sendmail configuration where the passwordeval option is used to fetch a password from the output of the access token script. I need to do the same kind of thing in my authinfo configuration, but I don't see an equivalent option. Is this possible?\n    submitted by    /u/lykwydchykyn  \n [link]   [comments]",

At one point (possibly after adding a lot of packages to my init), I noticed that every time I restart Emacs, it reverts back to ido-mode style autocomplete. I need to turn off ido-mode explicitly every time I start Emacs, to get back to Vertico style.\n I don't know when that started happening, so I can't pinpoint after which package that is. Init is a bit extensive so I will not post it here. \n Off the tops of your heads, do you maybe know any familiar package that does this under the hood? I have not enabled ido-mode explicitly anywhere in my init. It must be some package that does it.\n Also, is there a package that can act as a debugger for emacs? So I can track the order of command executions and trace where ido-mode is enabled and in which package?

The LaTeX LSP is working fine, and when I compile a document that needs pdflatex, it works.\n When I compile a document that requires LuaLatex, it asks me if I want to use the LuaTex engine. And when I click yes, it says this: LaTeX: problems after [0] pages and does not compile at all. I am able to compile the document by compiling it in the terminal, so the document is not the problem.\n Any ideas on how to get this working? I am not able to use XeLatex either. The distro I am using is Pop!_OS 22.04. \n EDIT: More details! I press M-x and run LaTex-command-selection. When I select LaTex option from the menu, I get asked if I want to use LuaTex, and when I press y I get the issue. The same thing when I select the LatexMk option. I have a .latexmkrc file in the project directory as well with the contents: $pdflatex = 'lualatex';\n Thanks for the help!\n    submitted by    /u/ThingyBob8055  \n [link]   [comments]",

Uninstall it. Also, and this may be inconvenient for lots of people, if you have and are using Termux, you should uninstall that too. That's because the optimal way to use the GUI-based, Android-native version of Emacs is in tandem with a custom fork of Termux which shares a developer ID with Emacs so that they can cooperate.

For example, yas-recompile-all is now replacing yas/recompile-all. I see such conventions followed for other libraries, too. Personally, no doubt because I'm a Clojure programmer, I like the slash over the dash. It is more distinctive, knowing \"this isn't just a core function with that name, but an actual NS (ish).\" I guess it might be more honest to elisp not to indicate there is a true namespace and it's all just a naming convention, but is this really the reason? Or is it something about compatibility (maybe with terminal users? Do terminals dislike the /?), or about interop (maybe libraries like yasnippet are also being ported to other things, like VIM or VSCode, that might have an opinion?)

Rewriting my configuration, combined with the aid I've gotten here, has kicked it back up several notches! So, thanks!)\n I'm almost completely happy with my new config. I have only one thing I need to address:\n When I add a new package (via use-package, generally) to the config, it almost always fails to download the next time I restart emacs. This is because of the package contents data being stale. I was manually running (package-refresh-contents) and restarting a subsequent time, but that was getting old. Especially given that I was experimenting with a variety of different packages.\n So I added that command to the start of my init.el, right after (package-initialize). And that added several seconds to my start-up.\n What do the rest of you do, to address this? Just accept that adding a new package means you have to refresh contents before restarting?

          "description": "I've always found that the built in habit tracking provided by org-mode that is based on repeaters is less than ideal for capturing anything other than the notion of repeating something at some fixed interval (typically daily).\n The way that I think most people think about non-daily habits is that they ought to be completed some number of times within a certain window. For example, you might set the goal of doing some form of cardiovascular exercise at least 4 times a week.\n org-window-habit Allows you to do exactly this. Instead of relying on org repeaters (or even the habit flavored org repeaters), it uses properties from the org drawer to understand the constraints the user would like to have around their habit. To explain how this is useful, I'll return to the 4 days a week example from above. If you wanted to give yourself some leeway within an individual week (life happens), but still wanted to ensure that in the long term you are conforming to your goal of 4 repetitions a week, you might do something like specify a short term window where 3 repetitions are required in a single week, but 16 repetitions are required within any 4 week period. This would allow you to require that you're never completely falling off the wagon with your habit, but also that you can do a bit of makeup/slowdown, as long as you are roughly hitting your goal when you zoom out enough.\n For more details, take a look at the README, but also be aware that even more customization is available (take a look at the source code if you are so inclined). If it seems that people in the community are interested in this sort of habit tracking I'm happy to document even more details about how this package works, but at this point, I want to evaluate whether or not people are interested in using it before I put more work into it.\n    submitted by    /u/IvanMalison  \n [link]   [comments]",

When elpaca-suggest mode is enabled and a fundamental mode buffer is visited, the database is checked to see if an appropriate mode can be installed.

          "description": "I use subdirectories in my org-directory that also serves as org-roam-directory. This means that to place a new file in the proper subdirectory, I either need to update/expand my capture templates each time when I add a subdirectory or that I need to refile or manually move the file after creating it.\n This is not a completely unsolved problem, fortunately, but most solutions are more complex than mine and require significant tailoring to one's own setup. So I set out to write something simpler using the ${foo} construct from Org-roam's template expansion.\n Quite happy with the solution that is also the first bit of elisp that I fully wrote myself (while of course being inspired by the examples on the web). I first set up a function to (recursively) collect all subdirectories below the org-directory. The resulting list is then used in a completing-read. Because ${foo} gets the file argument passed by Org-roam's capture system, the pl/ask-para-location needs to get accept this input although it doesn't actually use it.\n Together this enables interactively drilling down a directory structure or (even) to create a new (sub) directory by entering a new string instead of selecting a directory from the list provided by/to completing-read.\n  (defun pl/org-roam-directories () (let ((files (mapcar (lambda (f) (file-relative-name f org-roam-directory)) (directory-files-recursively org-roam-directory \"\\\\.org$\")))) (mapcar (lambda (f) (file-name-directory f)) files))) (defun pl/ask-para-location (ARG) (completing-read \"Choose org file :target : \" (pl/org-roam-directories))) (setq org-roam-capture-templates (quote ( (\"d\" \"Default\" plain \"%?\" :target (file+head \"${pl/ask-para-location}/${slug}.org\" \"#+title: ${title}\\n\") :unnarrowed t )))) \n Proud of this little snippet!\n (edit: small font locking improvements)\n    submitted by    /u/lappie75  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I was getting super excited about beOrg plus workingcopy on my iPhone. Got everything \"working\" and then started a simple test.\n Test 1: I went into a large personal.org file and changed the status of something from NEXT to DONE. Hit the back arrow since I think it just saves. Go to workingcopy and it shows the file has changed, great. And then do a diff... and it's several hundred changes, all of which look identical in the diff. Maybe its a word wrap (can't tell on the phone), sometimes a space. Just a bunch of green and red highlighted sections of the same content. I didn't notice a pattern.\n Test 2: I just went into the same file in basic text mode and added \"test save\" text at the top. Do the diff in working copy and the entire file isn't mangled, it just show test save as new text. BUT there is also an added block at the bottom of the file #+BEGIN_SRC scheme / blank line / #+END_SRC. How totally random?!?! (I've never made a scheme block in my life)\n ​\n So, is beOrg just doa or what am I doing wrong? It didn't parse the SEQ_TODO block at the top of my file so I added my states in the settings, but other than that it's entirely vanilla setup. I'm so bummed I had finally got this all up and working and it just seems non-functional. I'm hoping someone can point me in the right direction and I'm doing something stupid. Maybe there is a setting to not add a bunch of invis ctrl characters somewhere?\n Thanks again for any and all help.\n    submitted by    /u/ImportanceFit1412  \n [link]   [comments]",

For instance, when I'm reading a book, and creating notes about the book, I have some mashup of the book's title and author as a headline; and notes are in sub-headings underneath that. I just informally made this up as the need arose for various kinds of thing.\n It would be nice to regularize this, so that I could later write code that has a sense of what a \"book\" is, and its fields (author, publication date, ...) and to check for the inclusion of those fields, or integrity check them, or whatever. I'm only just beginning to think about this because I have only recently come to want it based on the way I've been using org-mode, but I'm sure this has been discussed many times, and maybe there's even a package or a method that's well-understood. Some of the new-fangled PKM tools have versions of this (e.g., Logseq, Tana) but they're undesirable for other ways (mainly, in my case, their editors suck so hard).\n Could anyone suggest existing thinking on this topic, or proposed packages, or reasons why it's a terrible idea?\n    submitted by    /u/metaham  \n [link]   [comments]",

However, I struggled with the lack of mobile apps that fully supported org-mode a few years ago. So, several years ago, I decided to develop an android app that would allow users to use org-mode on mobile devices just like in Emacs. At that time, Notion didn't have the influence it does now, and Obsidian and Logseq hadn't been released yet. Later on, Notion became valued at billions, and Obsidian and Logseq secured investments. However, I found that they all had various limitations and couldn't provide the complete org-mode experience. This strengthened my determination to bring…",

          "description": "I would like to set the keybindings for minor modes in their respective keymaps using the minor-mode hook. Using local-set-key, the same operation for MAJOR modes is easy. However, it appears that I must name the minor-mode keymap in every define-key expression, e.g.:\n (defun my/add-tab-bar-history-keys () \n \"Specify more convenient keybindings for the functions that traverse the history of the tab-bar window configurations. This function is added to the mode hook for tab-bar-history-mode.\" \n (define-key tab-bar-history-mode-map (kbd \"C-q b\") 'tab-bar-history-back)\n (define-key tab-bar-history-mode-map (kbd \"C-q f\") 'tab-bar-history-forward))\n I could use map() to eliminate the redundancy, I guess, but something like local-set-key() would be more convenient and robust. \n After scouring the Web, I found this StackOverflow question from 10 years ago, viewed 1k times, \"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19308390/how-to-define-keymap-for-minor-mode-correctly, but it doesn't deal with this aspect of minor-mode keymaps. \n Perhaps a more recent technique has emerged?

          "description": "I'm getting a weird shifting of the line numbers when using (setq-default display-line-numbers 'visual).\n When moving through rows of text, the whole buffer will shift to the right by (what looks like) 1 column. The row that this happens on isn't consistent either. Moving back up the lines of text will shift it back to the left.\n In org-roam it's usually between lines 6 and 7 that I get the shift. With emacs -q it happens between lines 1 and 2. With emacs -Q it happens between lines 9 and 10. I've seen it happen for lines above 40 even.\n I can stop it from happening by disabling the absolute numbering with (setq display-line-numbers-current-absolute nil), but then I loose absolute numbering; and that's not a solution.\n This doesn't happen when using relative numbering; only with visual.\n I've tried using both (setq display-line-numbers-width-start t) and (setq display-line-numbers-grow-only t) but neither appear to change anything. (As suggested in this post)\n I'm using emacs version 28.1. I'm fairly new to emacs too.\n Steps to reproduce:\n  \nStart emacs without config: emacs -Q\n Show line numbers: M-x display-line-numbers-mode RET\n Set visual line numbers: M-x set-variable RET display-line-numbers RET visual RET\n Press enter a few times until all text shifts right by 1 column.

With 24 lines visible, the shifting gets pushed out to line 66/67. It is not affected by where in the window those lines are though.Fiddling with the window size, It looks like the shift position happens according to (# visible lines + cursor line # = 90).\n ie. 31 visible lines, shift between line 59/60.\n 24 visible lines, shift between line 66/67.\n    submitted by    /u/CasualtyOfCuriosity  \n [link]   [comments]",

Pressing return on the dir in untracked files doesn't go into it (i thought maybe I could just add the files, but no joy). What gives?\n When I committed/pushed the wc-mode/ I staged I expected it to just add the subdir, but instead it went into creating a submodule (no experience with that term as far as VC goes) and added to the history that I merged a pull request from the git repo the dir originally came from (don't know where it grabed that info from). It was all very new, and pulling from my other machine just got me an empty dir. So I backed it all out manually by killing my .gitmodules file (newly created i think) and my .emacs.d/.git/modules/wc-mode (also newly created). Checked in the .gitmodules removal, but now looking for the way to just add a dir to my repo.\n I found a .git dir under wc-mode/ (don't think it was there before) and mv'd it to a bak. Now pressing return on wc-mode brings me up to .emacs.d in dired mode. Sooo confused now.\n (While I am curious about what how submodules work, and how it knew about the original github... I'd also really like to know just how to add a directory of files, since that seems very common.)\n ​\n Thanks for any and all help. I know this is a bit of a shit post from a debug perspective, but if you could point me toward the right info/book/etc that would be great. The magit info seems a bit obtuse at times, it's great for explaining low-level functions but not so much at explaining the designed workflow for things like this.\n ​\n    submitted by    /u/ImportanceFit1412  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I have a weird issue that I do not know how to debug. I am using sway and when I start my session sometimes the http links do not trigger the browser.\n In the sway configuration I export the browser variable:\n export BROWSER=firefox \n I am trying to open the links from an emacsclient, but this also happens with a regular emacs session. The only way I can make it work, once it stops working, is to restart emacs. After I do that the links start triggering the browser again and everything works as intended.\n Could you please help me to debug this issue? I don't know how to proceed in this case, but I have found out that browse-url seems to be the resposible one. If I position the cursor on the URL and do M-x browse-url it does not work. Of course, after the emacs restart it starts working again. So, I think that this is the function that is failing.\n SOLVED: It is possible to add a handler and set the default browser with the browse-url-text-browser variable and then set the browse-url-browser-function as browse-url-firefox. This block of code solves my issue:\n (setq browse-url-text-browser \"firefox\") (setq browse-url-browser-function 'browse-url-firefox browse-url-new-window-flag t browse-url-firefox-new-window-is-tab t) \n    submitted by    /u/G0k1bur1  \n [link]   [comments]",

This was a great learning experience and really gave me a brand new appreciation for the customizability of Emacs. \n This package currently includes the following features:\n  \nDetailed syntax highlighting (variables, cmdlets, keywords, .NET types, strings, single- and multi-line comments, docstrings)\n Code indentation \n Auto-complete for built-in and user-defined variables and cmdlets, built-in cmdlet parameters, and .NET types and members\n Spawning and sending code to an inferior shell process\n Support for PowerShell in Windows, *nix, and MacOS\n  \nI kind of hacked together the company backend, so it may not be as efficient as it could be. There may also be some bugs I missed (I haven’t figured out how to do company completion for multiple periods yet for the .NET types, for example), but I have been using it for writing PowerShell scripts at work and it’s been working well. \n Feedback is always appreciated and pull requests are always welcome.

So recently (and probably foolishly) I did list-packages and let it update everything. Doing this kind of broke doom-modeline for me. I was getting weird ISO characters in the modeline, and with some research discovered that it had switched to nerd-icons at some point in the past. Previously it was working fine with all-the-icons. \n Well I got nerd-icons installed and that fixed things up pretty much though the character is still quite small in comparison. However I discovered that the little icon doom-modeline uses for VHDL files is different from the one treemacs and all-the-icons uses for VHDL files. So this got me looking around for some definition of what file suffix gets associated with what icon.\n And that's where I got stuck. I can't find any option or list anywhere that sets that up. It's not that I need them to be the same (though I do prefer the one in all-the-icons) but now I'm just puzzled as to how this is assigned. Clearly it's got to be in the elisp somewhere, but... nothing so far.\n Does anyone know where it lists a character hex value and a file type list?\n    submitted by    /u/remillard  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "As an active Emacs user and package developer, I've been contemplating the structure of tabulated-list-mode in Emacs Lisp, particularly its use of vectors. While vectors are efficient for indexed access, they present challenges when dealing with complex data structures or transformations.\n Much of my work involves parsing data from JSON API responses, which naturally form alist, plist, or hash-table structures. In the current iteration of tabulated-list-mode, a two-stage process is necessary: first, normalization into vector format (I find it hard to imagine a structure where the entry format (ID [DESC1 ... DESCN]) could originate from), followed by rendering through tabulated-list-print. This process can introduce performance inefficiencies.\n In real-world scenarios where normalization to the tabulated-list's vector format is unavoidable, the efficiency advantage of vectors is somewhat negated, and can even result in an overall performance loss due to the extra conversion step.\n I'd propose using lists instead of vectors in tabulated-list-format and tabulated-list-entries. This change could potentially allow for greater flexibility and better alignment with common data inputs. However, I understand that historical decisions and compatibility concerns may limit the feasibility of such changes.\n In the interim, I suggest enabling tabulated-list-print to act as a transducer, reducing the need for multiple iteration passes. This could significantly streamline the rendering of non-vector-compatible data while preserving compatibility and performance.\n I've noted that some libraries also struggle with this issue, resorting to workarounds and hacks, as evidenced in the magit-repolist-columns documentation string.\n I welcome your thoughts, advice, and any potential solutions or alternatives. If there are potential pitfalls I've overlooked, I'm keen to learn about them too.\n    submitted by    /u/elgrekoo  \n [link]   [comments]",

I got into it through Niklas Luhmann, but not originally through his Zettelkasten, but his work as a sociologist and systems theory. \nI am looking forward to the conversations here in the forum.\nMarcus",

I have tried searching the forum before asking the question and found some related material, but the answer is not entirely clear to me.  This is the question: can someone just confirm or explain what The Archive does when you click on a link such as [[202309091054]]?\nWhat I think I have read elsewhere in the forum is that The Archive takes the information inside the set of double brackets and searches both the names and the content of all files in your Zettelkasten directory, and returns the name of any file where a match is found.  Is that correct?  If not, please enlighten me \nAlso, is the information within that set of double brackets limited to 12 characters or can it be any length of characters?\nI'm just trying to understand how the linking functions.",
