Thankfully, the GHC specialiser is extremely good at removing that cost. We can therefore write high-level, polymorphic programs and be confident that GHC will compile them into very efficient, monomorphised code. In this episode, we’ll demystify the seemingly magical things that GHC is doing to achieve this.\nCore Inspection by Oleg Grenrus\nLuckily, relatively recently, GHC got a feature to include all Core bindings in the interface files.

For example perhaps you’re writing a logger and want to call a function log. That’s a problem because the Prelude also defines a function called log. You can’t use either one without disambiguating. Usually you will disambiguate by qualifying the identifier like MyLogger.log. This is fine but it is a little annoying because it duplicates the name of the module.

But there's one single function that perpetually stumps me and I can't seem to understand how it works, and that's fix.\n The definition is\n fix f = let x = f x in x\n Trying to read through some stackoverflow answers explaining this function the closest I could get to understanding it is that the f passed into fix is infinitely composed with itself like so:\n  x = f . f $ x -- or x = f (f x) x = f . f . f $ x -- or x = f (f (f x)) x = f . f . f . f . f . f . f . f . f . f . f $ x -- etc. \n Given this explanation my question is, if a function is infinitely composed with itself, even if we were to have lazy evaluation here, how could it ever possibly terminate? The documentation says something about how fix produces the least fixed point of a function, looking that up I see something about domain theory and don't get any closer to understanding it.

          "description": "I've started a Cabal project which consists of an executable and a single test-suite. In the test-suite I call the executable in a subprocess using System.Process.callProcess. \n I've found that cabal test does not automatically rebuild the executable after its Main.hs has been modified. Hence tests were failing simply because the executable was out-of-date.\n It took me a while to figure out how to fix this so I'm recording the fix here. The Cabal file should look something like this:\n name: foo executable: bar main-is: Main.hs hs-source-dirs: app test-suite: tests type: exitcode-stdio-1.0 main-is: test.hs hs-source-dirs: tests build-tool-depends: foo:bar \n The build-tool-depends line ensures that the executable bar in project foo gets built every time the test-suite is run.\n The comments on this Github issue suggest that this is the official way of ensuring that an executable is built before a test-suite is run. And this open issue is requesting the addition of a run-tool-depends field which would create a distinction between executables used when building a component and those used to running a component.\n Is there a better way of directly testing an executable with Cabal?\n    submitted by    /u/ljbw_online  \n [link]   [comments]",

I've been coding in Haskell for some time now mostly for toy projects. I really love coding in Haskell, but one thing I was missing is to easily share my work in a straightforward, cost-effective way to friends/colleagues. This setup, combining Haskell with Docker and Cloud Run, might not be ideal for a production-grade service but is great for demos and learning experiences - all for free.\n Project Overview:\n The project, cloud-run-hs-demo, is a basic Haskell application that uses the Scotty web framework to set up a simple API. This demo showcases how you can containerize a Haskell application using Docker and deploy it to Google Cloud Run, a managed platform that automatically scales your stateless containers.\n I am aware that the setup lacks many essential features like rate limiting, authentication mechanisms, and DDoS protection. Also, there are many options for web frameworks, such as servant, yesod etc. and many database libraries. These are critical for production-grade services to ensure security and manageability. This project serves as a demonstration on how easy it is to get started.\n Features:\n  \nSimple Haskell API using Scotty.\n SQLite readonly database using sqlite-simple project.\n Docker integration for Cloud Run deployment.\n Static webpage as frontend for the API.\n  \nI'd love to hear your thoughts, feedback, or any experiences with similar technologies.

          "description": "My question is a bit more general this, but help me understand the best way to namespace some code:\n I work for the National Solar Observatory. We are NSF funded, and my team processes data from the DKIST solar telescope. I'm excited to build tools for this in Haskell.\n FITS is the digital format used for telescope images. I've been contributing to the fits-parse package, which uses Data.Fits as a namespace, but my needs are growing beyond the scope of that package. I need to add support for the ASDF file format (containing metadata for many FITS images) and for the World Coordinate System (WCS), among other things.\n So I'd like to make a new package containing all the tools one might need to work with astronomical images from modern telescopes/observatories. How should it be namespaced?\n There's an existing package that uses the Data.Astro namespace: https://hackage.haskell.org/package/astro. The fits-parse package uses Data.Fits\n Let's assume that I create a single package for this, and name it telescope. Should the code be namespaced under Data or not? If yes, should I use a different namespace than the Data.Astro that the astro package uses?\n Option 1: Pick my own Top-level Namespace\n import Telescope.Fits import Telescope.Asdf import Telescope.Wcs \n Option 2: Add packages to existing namespaces like `Data.Astro`, which is used by the `astro` package\n Note that the `astro` package deals with calculating the position of celestial bodies, which is every bit as as valid a use of the word astronomy, but has a very different focus from my work to process astronomical observations.\n -- from this package! import Data.Astro.Fits import Data.Astro.Wcs -- from `astro` package import Data.Astro.Sun \n Option 3: Pick a new namespace under `Data` to differentiate from the other packages\n import Data.Telescope.Fits import Data.Telescope.Wcs \n What's the right approach here?\n    submitted by    /u/embwbam  \n [link]   [comments]",

This API allows you to construct an input interface based on a data type of your choice. Each input in the form corresponds to a field in your data type.

Suppose the following structure:\n Text.JSON.Format ├── Text.JSON.Format.Object └── Text.JSON.Format.Array \n Where the outermost Text.JSON.Format exports ppValue to prettyprint a JSON Value which in turn uses ppObject and ppArray from respective internal modules.\n The problem is, when prettyprinting an object or an array, you would need to refer to ppValue to prettyprint the values inside the object or array, which cannot be done without creating a cyclic dependency.\n If that's unclear, here's the simplified project:\n ```haskell module Text.JSON.Format (ppValue) where\n import qualified Data.Aeson as Aeson import Prettyprinter\n import Text.JSON.Format.Object (ppObject) import Text.JSON.Format.Array (ppArray)\n ppValue :: Int -> Aeson.Value -> Doc ann ppValue nesting = \\case Aeson.Object obj -> ppObject nesting obj Aeson.Array arr -> ppArray nesting arr other -> ppByteStringLazy $ Aeson.encode other ```\n  \n```haskell module Text.JSON.Format.Object (ppObject) where\n import qualified Data.Aeson as Aeson import Text.JSON.Format (ppValue) -- error!\n ppObject :: Int -> Aeson.Object -> Doc ann ppObject nesting obj = ... -- uses ppValue ```\n  \n```haskell module Text.JSON.Format.Array (ppArray) where\n import qualified Data.Aeson as Aeson import Text.JSON.Format (ppValue) -- error!\n ppArray :: Int -> Aeson.Array -> Doc ann ppArray nesting arr = ... -- uses ppValue ```\n There would be no problem when ppObject and ppArray are defined in the same module as ppValue, had their implementations not been too bulky and complex; sadly they are, thus it would be better to separate them.

Until recently, however, I didn't have a compelling enough project for me to grit my teeth and work through all the issues associated with learning to program in a language properly.\n Last year, my wfie and I walked the Camino Santigo and, since I had plenty of time to think and not much else to do, I started to think about how to better plan the daily stages. It takes 30-40 days to complete and guidebooks tend to give stages for a \"normal\" pilgrim; we discovered that we started flagging at about 25km or so.\n So building a Camino planner that optimises the stages for the entire journey, based on people's preferences in terms of distance, time, accommodation etc. became that project.\n You can give the result a spin at https://de-calixtinus.org It's a yesod website that uses dynamic programming to plan out the route. The source code is at https://github.com/charvolant/de-calixtinus\n I'm painfully aware that this has been a learning project. You can see traces of it where, for example, I've become comfortable with something like applicative programming but haven't got around to rethinking previous stuff in the light of my new knowledge. Yesod is a bugger to learn and the scaffolding makes it wilfully obscure, so you can see where I've been going through things in a step-wise fashion, slowly pulling stuff in from the scaffolding once I've understood what's going on. The fields work, but there's obviously more stuff needed. The configuration is trapped partway between where it was a stand-alone program and where it became a web application. And so on.\n If any kind soul wanted to look over the code and suggest improvements or completely better ways of looking at things, I'd be most grateful.\n    submitted by    /u/orlock  \n [link]   [comments]",

Then exceptions should be thrown only in rare circumstances as they are a side effect?\n If that’s correct then:\n  \nHow do you evaluate that the circumstance is right for an exception to be thrown?\n \nWhat are the alternative values you provide instead of an exception that can keep the program running?\n \n    submitted by    /u/el527  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I am upgrading a lot of Scala 2.13 services up to Scala 3, and have encountered some codebases where reflection was used in unit tests to examine all the subclasses of a trait.\n For example, in 2.x the way to make enumerations was with a sealed trait and case object subclasses. We would often make a collection listing all types, similar to Java enum .values. In our unit tests we would want to make sure no subtypes were accidentally omitted from that collection, and we would use reflection for that.\n ```scala import scala.reflect.runtime.universe\n val classType = universe.typeOf[Branding] val subclasses = classType.typeSymbol.asClass.knownDirectSubclasses ```\n This is gone in Scala 3 and I'm wondering if there is a simple alternative. I would love to spend a day or two learning the new Scala macro syntax but I don't have the time right now to devote to that, just for this simple 2-line expression.\n One might also suggest just updating our 2-style enums to Scala 3 proper enums. That will solve some of our scenarios but we use this \"find subclass types\" in tests for other classes as well, not just enums. For example we might occasionally have a trait with many subclasses and we want to make sure we have written a certain kind of test for each of the concrete subclasses, and reflection can come in handy as a sanity check here.\n gzoller/scala-reflection seems popular but I don't see any documentation.\n    submitted by    /u/jim_mccabe  \n [link]   [comments]",

It is possible when the ho function does not store functional arguments in variables but only invokes (as in map). This is the work of Olena Kravchenko during her GSoC-2023 project. More details can be found in Olena-s presentation: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1H5rIQlqeektpZAnC547YnlPoXChrH99UOLMy4kY-pRQ/edit?usp=sharing and GitHub discussion: https://github.com/rssh/dotty-cps-async/discussions/79.\n Added compile-time checks for attempts to use direct syntax when the compiler plugin is not enabled. It is possible to freely mix code compiled with and without a plugin, if you accidentally forget the plugin when it was needed, you will receive a compile-time error.\n  \nLogic module:\n  \nExtend API, add a few examples in tests, and an implementation of CpsLogicMonad over LazyList.\n  \nURL: https://github.com/rssh/dotty-cps-async \n    submitted by    /u/rssh1  \n [link]   [comments]",

The code would be perhaps harder to read. Sometimes less efficient as well. \n What are your thoughts on this? Would you say FP and immutability make sense for some more or less complex algorithms? \n Also, once again I'm no FP expert but I'd tend to think it's okay to have mutable state if the method do not produce any real side effects. As long as no class instance variables or global variables are mutated by a method, having some \"var\" inside a method can be an okay choice if it makes the code more readable and efficient. Why would it be so bad to have a \"var\" inside a pure method? \n I'd love to hear your thoughts. \n Thanks in advance!\n    submitted by    /u/yinshangyi  \n [link]   [comments]",

Can someone help me if I'm taking it in wrong way.... and sorry for such a noob question but it is something which disturb me sometimes \n YOE: 3\n Edit: Thank you to the community for the comments, they are really helpful. I will strengthen and learn more about Scala language, as ppl are already loving it 🙌\n    submitted by    /u/username_is_takennnn  \n [link]   [comments]",

Is it worth it? I don't feel that my code is better and more secure when I use Cats Effect compared to my FP+OOP Scala mix.\n I am used to Akka stack for backend - mostly classic actors, cluster, Akka Streams for data processing (like IoT management system for example), and just Scala for internal tools and game development. I don't see what is the benefit of dropping my current way of using Scala and use Cats Effect/Zio instead.\n The worst thing is - that pure functional programming with Cats Effect or Zio is so popular in Scala world, that I can't find any job not mentioning it (well, maybe some big data ones).\n Do you have any suggestions that could help me find answers for my question?

          "description": "As my first Halogen application has just surpassed 3K lines of Purescript code, and contains several components that communicate with and through each other, -I am starting to wish that I had some sort of visual 'map' to navigate the relationship between my components.\n This is where I got the idea that what if we could simply invoke a function on the 'root' component and then the function would output something like 'plantUML' which then can be compiled to a diagram. In theory all the required information to generate the diagram is contained in the type information for all the Halogen components.\n Being relatively new to Purescript, I don't have any clear idea how this could be achieved. But roughly I am thinking that since Purescript is quite weak on the metaprogramming side of things, one would probably have to exploit some FFI and JS to extract the information required to generate the diagram.\n For now I will probably just manually create my visual 'map' with plantUML since I am busy on my own project, however I just wanted to throw the idea out there. Perhaps I will work on it in the future, or perhaps someone else will like the idea and work on it.\n In any case it would be cool to hear from more experienced Purescript programmers whether or not this is possible and how it could be accomplished.

I don't know much programming so hoping someone has found a solution for this.\n I also looked into activities.el but it looks like each \"activity\" is a frame/tab, but for my workflow with a tiling window manager I find it more suitable to liberally create and destroy frames from my window manager's workspaces and for now at least am just looking for a way to restore all buffers/frames/window configuration without the need to create and switch projects. Actually activities.el might be suitable if an activity includes a set a frames. I prefer dealing with frames than Emac's window management because I often work with at least a browser alongside in a window manager workspace and it's just less cognitive overhead to treat each buffer as a frame when the rest of your applications are also managed by the window manager.\n    submitted by    /u/exquisitesunshine  \n [link]   [comments]",

Instead of showing a proper superscripted citation, the generated ODT document shows the underlying org shorthand (e.g., ^{1}). Using a (relatively) minimal example:\n  \n#+TITLE: Manuscript Title \n #+OPTIONS: author:nil toc:nil num:nil \n #+CITE_EXPORT: csl ~/path/to/CSL/styles/american-medical-association.csl \n * Testing \n This is a test sentence with a citation.[cite:@somecitekey] \n This is standard superscript.^{1} \n #+PRINT_BIBLIOGRAPHY:\n  \nThe first sentence will render as (^{1}), and the second sentence will render with appropriate superscript (1). The bibliography will render appropriately according to the CSL style, as expected.\n Interestingly, when I export to other formats such as HTML, the superscripted citations render appropriately—it's only ODT that has issues. Also, unsurprisingly, this isn't an issue for CSL formats that do not require superscript for in-text citations.\n For reference, I'm using citeproc-el and the advanced org-mode-ox-odt fork to export org files to ODT, although I don't know how much of a difference this makes.\n Any help or insight would be greatly appreciated!\n    submitted by    /u/Mortal_Scum  \n [link]   [comments]",

I’m studying engineering, so I’m seriously eyeing the inline LaTeX rendering capabilities of org-mode for notetaking. I first downloaded MiKTeX and installed it with the provided installer (it seems like dvipng is included in MiKTeX) then tried configuring org-mode to render with dvipng, by adding the following to my init.el file:\n (setq org-preview-latex-default-process 'dvipng) (setq org-latex-create-formula-image-program 'dvipng) (setq org-preview-latex-process-alist '((dvipng :programs (\"latex\" \"dvipng\") :description \"dvi > png\" :message \"you need to install the programs: latex and dvipng.\" :image-input-type \"dvi\" :image-output-type \"png\" :image-size-adjust (1.0 . 1.0) :latex-compiler (\"latex -interaction nonstopmode -output-directory %o %f\") :image-converter (\"dvipng -fg %F bg %B -D %D -T tight -o %O %f\")) )) \n However, if I type some inline LaTeX in an org-mode file and try to compile it with C-c C-x C-l, I get the following message: \n Creating LaTeX previews in region... org-compile-file: File \"c:/Users/USERNAME/AppData/Local/Temp/orgtexTelk2W.dvi\" wasn’t produced. Please adjust ‘dvipng’ part of ‘org-preview-latex-process-alist’. \n Does anyone know what I might have done wrong? I read this post, but no log files seem to have been generated for me. If I run \"latex c:/Users/USERNAME/AppData/Local/Temp/orgtexTelk2W.tex\" in the command line it generates a dvi file of the same name; running \"dvipng c:/Users/USERNAME/AppData/Local/Temp/orgtexTelk2W.dvi\" seems to also generate a proper png image with the same name.

I come from the relational database world where the instinct is not to crowd everything into one table, rather create a new table to normalize. But is that \"best practice\" with org-agenda?

          "description": "I've been an org mode user for around 3 years now, I use it for practically everything task- and note-oriented. I'm in it and emacs most of the day.\n However, the one aspect I have never quite understood is why TODOs seem the same as headings. My natural expectation is that when taking notes, especially with meetings, I want to slot in a TODO based on the context of the notes at that time. But with a TODO being a heading, all the plain text notes below it come under that heading. So I tend to have a heading at the bottom of the notes section called Tasks or something under which I enter the TODOs for that meeting, but that approach does lose the context location from the full notes--not a major issue, but flipping about to record TODOs does disrupt flow.\n So, what am I missing? I did search on this a bit and think identified that some people just use headings for the full notes, and any plain text under a heading is just brief explanation or extra detail for that heading but may be omitted altogether. However, the way headings are formatted by default with bold doesn't feel natural for note-taking (I use Prot's Modus themes, and then a mixture of formatting from System Crafters videos).\n Or maybe I have missed something really obvious. Whatever, any thoughts and guidance appreciated. Thanks.\n    submitted by    /u/redoakprof  \n [link]   [comments]",

For example, if I have a journal entry that talked about a philosophical topic in application to my life, I want it to link to one of my studies of that topic that is part of the philosophy category. Essentially, I want to map my brain. \n In order to keep my files organized, I was planning on keeping my files for each topic in a completely separate directories from the Org-roam directory. I would have an org file in the Org-roam directory that links to that particular file and if there is a relationship, I would just link the org files in the Org-roam directory. In other words, the org files in the Org-roam directory simply contains links to the actual files in my file system and serves as the linker. \n To organize my files in my file system, I plan on using the denote package for its file naming scheme.\n How does this setup sound? Are there any better setup designs that you can recommend? I was thinking about just using denote, but I like the org-roam-ui and I would like to keep everything in separate dirs. However, if this setup is not feasible then I might do that instead.\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/victorian_cross  \n [link]   [comments]",

What I tried was to create a custom minor mode that would change the keybindings to what I want. From my understanding, since this mode is more recently added to minor-mode-alist and minor-mode-map-alist, the bindings in my-isearch-mode-map should take higher precedence than isearch-mode-map. However, when I define it and activate it, isearch bindings still function like the default.\n Here is the link to my code. Be warned, it is not pretty as this is my first time writing a minor mode.\n What am I missing? Is there a better way to do this? I want to avoid hacky solutions to the best of my ability and I don't want to have to go down to route of trying (and probably failing) to remake isearch just to get this one thing to work.\n I am open to suggestions on other packages as well.

I don't know much programming so hoping someone has found a solution for this.\n I also looked into activities.el but it looks like each \"activity\" is a frame/tab, but for my workflow with a tiling window manager I find it more suitable to liberally create and destroy frames from my window manager's workspaces and for now at least am just looking for a way to restore all buffers/frames/window configuration without the need to create and switch projects. Actually activities.el might be suitable if an activity includes a set a frames. I prefer dealing with frames than Emac's window management because I often work with at least a browser alongside in a window manager workspace and it's just less cognitive overhead to treat each buffer as a frame when the rest of your applications are also managed by the window manager.\n    submitted by    /u/exquisitesunshine  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello, I've been trying to setup emacs for the first time and it's been pretty easy and straightforward apart from a couple issues. I'm setting it up on a NixOS Virtual Machine using home-manager: I have two files a default.nix where I say which packages to install and a config.el where I write the configs. Here are the relevant parts from the files:\n default.nix:\n { pkgs , ... } { programs.emacs = { enable = true; package = pkgs.emacs; extraConfig = builtins.readFile ./config.el; extraPackages = epkgs: with epkgs; [ evil evil-collection treesit-auto ]; }; } \n config.el:\n (setq evil-want-keybinding nil) (require 'evil) (require 'evil-collection) (evil-collection-init) (evil-mode 1) (require 'treesit-auto) (global-treesit-auto-mode) \n The issues are:\n When I run home-manager switch I get two issues. The first one is assignment to free variable 'evil-want-keybinding' followed by a reminder to set evil-want-keybinding to nil before loading evil and evil collection (even if I am doing it).\n The second one is that it gives the error cannot open load file: no such file or directory, treesit.\n I've tested and the issues are disconnected from one another. I've been googling around for a day now and I wasn't able to find a fix to either. If any of you may know how to fix I'd be grateful.\n EDIT: Regarding the treesitter problem, I'm just a moron. The default pkgs.emacs is version 28. Changing it to pkgs.emacs29 it works. It does compile and works, but it does still give me issues about evil-want-keybinding.\n    submitted by    /u/Elq3  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I've been looking at trying out treesitter support again (specifically, c-ts-mode), and one thing that's got me stuck is how to modify the rules that are used to highlight the text. c-ts-mode makes some baffling decisions where it deviates from cc-mode in how certain things get highlighted, and I'd like to change this.\n I haven't been able to see anything about how to modify the highlighting so far. c-ts-mode doesn't offer anything like c-ts-mode-indent-style for modifying indentation, and the general treesitter documentation for font lock stuff doesn't really help. The closest I've figured so far is that maybe you can write a mode hook that adds entries to the treesit-font-lock-settings list, but there's no indication if this would actually work, and if so how.\n I'm worried that the only \"solution\" right now is to copy-paste the font lock rules in c-ts-mode and manually maintain a separate copy just to change a couple things, which would obviously be unacceptable. And I can't sidestep the issue by, say, modifying font faces to look better, because the issues I want to fix have to do with poorly-chosen generic font faces for some of these rules.\n If modifying syntax highlighting isn't possible right now, then I'll make a feature request and go back to waiting for treesitter support to be usable. I'm just not sure what part of emacs would be responsible for the new feature. I get the impression that the font lock rule system as it is now makes it really difficult for a major mode to let you extend its rules, so I'm leaning towards it being a treesitter feature request (as opposed to a c-ts-mode feature request).\n    submitted by    /u/ShimmerFairy  \n [link]   [comments]",

Or is the intention that everything should be in a silo, rather than in the default `denote-directory`?\n Either way, I think things could get complicated working in different silos (assuming the goal is to keep them separate). Perhaps what is needed is some indication prepended to buffer-name of the silo - e.g. if the silo is in ~/Orgs/Silo1 and the #+title is \"My plain title\", the buffer name would be \"Silo1:My plain title\". If we were in the default `denote-directory` , buffer-name would just be \"My plain title\".\n Thanks\n Nick\n    submitted by    /u/N1ck_B  \n [link]   [comments]",

I just want to start coding but I can't because I can't even get this editor set up.\n ​\n Edit: I woke up with renewed vigor and I am going to try again when I get home from some obligatory human activities which unfortunately detract me from my goal of being a data spirit of some kind.

          "description": "I'll preface by stating that I use project.el, and not projectile. Any solutions involving the latter won't do for me.\n In most other editors, you can create a file at the project root (or some other predefined path) that specifies settings and, among other things, launch commands.\n These commands are for anything related to the project, be it running, compiling, testing, debugging, whatever.\n I want something like this for emacs. So, I've been investigating possible ways to do it.\n I created a .dir-locals.el file on the project root. Emacs automatically loads this file. In it, I defined numerous variables with commands. I defined compile-command and created my own, like run-command and test-command.\n I would then need to create functions that read these variables and run their values, similar to how compile-command is handled. This would work just fine, but there's an issue.\n Since the variables I'm creating are unknown to emacs, it marks them as risky. So, what ends up happening is that every time you open a file where these variables would apply, you get a prompt asking you if you want to apply the variables.\n I managed to fix this by setting these variables as safe when giving them strings like this:\n (put 'compile-and-run-command 'safe-local-variable #'stringp) (put 'run-command 'safe-local-variable #'stringp) (put 'test-command 'safe-local-variable #'stringp) \n And while this works, it irks me the wrong way, since this file would obviously be bundled with the project. So, if anyone else downloads this project and opens it with emacs, they won't have this extra config and they will be bugged by it, and for no good reason since they won't have the functions that use these variables anyway so it's of no use to them.\n So, I'm looking for a way to:\n  \nDefine an arbitrary amount of commands to run on a project.\n Have this configuration loaded automatically.\n Not be a nuisance to third parties.\n  \nAny ideas?\n    submitted by    /u/SnooPets20  \n [link]   [comments]",

Changelog is available here.\n This release integrates Kele with the menu bar. With this initial integration, you can switch Kubernetes contexts and default namespaces from within the menu bar. Kele presents your available contexts and namespaces as dynamic sub-menus, freeing you from the need to remember exact names and typing them in by hand (similar to kubectx and kubens on the terminal).\n https://preview.redd.it/lhzkprkuk9uc1.png?width=1512&format=png&auto=webp&s=8662d3e5c17ef2b864a8089b52dbd33c5641eb32\n With this release, Kele is now also integrated with doom-modeline. By adding the k8s segment to your doom-modeline configuration, you'll see current context and namespace information directly on the modeline. By clicking the segment, you can also access the menu bar, for the (menu-bar-mode -1) crowd.\n https://preview.redd.it/sx90o1w4k9uc1.png?width=820&format=png&auto=webp&s=8be6f1ceac15d87628b00d5ff9e4d95a224bf0cb\n https://preview.redd.it/nhtff5ink9uc1.png?width=1214&format=png&auto=webp&s=361736c62d4b83173a7e9f94aeadbd621692cf57\n For more details, see the Kele documentation.

          "description": "Hello emacs community, no matter how hard i try i cannot seem to wrap my head around the idea of using hooks in emacs. I have two examples to provide. The one working and the other one not, although i've seen both in the documentation.\n First example: Defining a function and then passing in to the hook.\n ```emacs-lisp (defun my-c-mode-hook () (setq c-basic-offset 4 indent-tabs-mode nil electric-indent-mode nil) (message \"C-mode hook loaded successfully\"))\n (add-hook 'c-mode-common-hook 'my-c-mode-hook) ``` Even though the message prints, the variables don't seem to get the values.\n Second example:\n emacs-lisp (add-hook 'c-mode-common-hook (lambda () (setq c-basic-offset 4 indent-tabs-mode nil electric-indent-mode nil) (message \"C-mode hook loaded successfully\" ))) \n The second one, passing a lambda to the hook works. It also is the same for my latex-mode hooks.\n So my question is, what is the difference between the two methods and what am i missing here. If anyone wants to share a resource for working with emacs hooks it will also be really appreciated.\n On the note of hooks, i have a more general question. When using the setq-default it will set the variable globally if it can. tab-width for example if set with `setq-default does not apply to all buffers. But if it is passed with a hook it works. Correct me if i'm wrong but does that happen because the settings get overwritten by the major mode? That's why you need the hook to overwrite the major mode defaults perhaps???\n Thank you in advance.\n    submitted by    /u/CrispyBoye  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm basically hoping to improve the following aspects:\n  \nTyping jsx/tsx forms\n Folding\n Structural editing\n  \n \nFor the first thing I probably can still use Emmet mode. Or maybe there's something better now?\n \nSince I'm already using treesitter, for folding I tried: emacs-tree-sitter/ts-fold, but because I'm using Emacs 30, I had to use this fork: abougouffa/treesit-fold, see emacs-tree-sitter/ts-fold#48 for details. That though still didn't get me the desired outcome. If I have a component such as:\n export default function Home() { return ( <main> <div> <p> ... \n \n and I try folding around <p>, it folds the entire function body. Not sure why. In general, I'm not sure what to use for folding to make it work with treesitter - ts-fold/treesit-fold, hideshow, evil-fold, origami, bicycle, yafolding, evil-vimish-fold, or something else?\n  \nFor structural editing I'm not even sure what would be helpful here. I'm thinking of trying evil-matchit, to quickly jump to beginning/end of an element, because evil's % keybinding doesn't support html tags by default, but that's just one aspect. There are probably a few other things to consider?\n  \nWhat are your thoughts? In general, do you know of any other Emacs packages you'd recommend for web-development? Also, I noticed that not all the features of emacs-tree-sitter/elisp-tree-sitter went into core (again, I'm using Emacs 30), do you think it's worth loading the package instead of relying on what's already in the core?\n    submitted by    /u/ilemming  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "New to emacs, not sure if this is a bug with the windows version or I'm missing something. Using version 29.3\n Very simple init.el:\n (add-to-list 'load-path \"path/to/evil\") (require 'evil) (evil-mode 1) \n But it still isn't enabled on startup. I can enable it manually, but interestingly, I have to enter the command twice. If I remove (evil-mode 1), I just have to execute the command once. Other commands in my init.el get executed as expected.\n It works as expected when running emacs through WSL. I've also tried installing with package.el and elpaca but same thing. I was also able to install general.el without issue, and I'm a solid 4 hours in at this point, so I'm not sure where else to look. It just seems like (evil-mode 1) in my init.el doesn't work for some reason\n Edit: Just added hooks to enable evil-mode to work around this\n    submitted by    /u/big_joplinK_3x  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Based on valuable feedback and the challenges many of us face during online coding interviews or sessions, I've pushed a significant update to the Chrome-Emacs extension that extends its compatibility to more environments.\n This includes experimental support for vscode.dev, codesandbox.com, GitHub Codespaces, and other online Monaco-based editors where direct API access is unavailable.\n The update relies on simulating user interactions to achieve real-time synchronization from Emacs to the browser. Given the complexity of these platforms, the feature primarily supports synchronization from Emacs to the browser, with additional nuances due to the simulation approach.\n Important to Note:\n This experimental feature heavily relies on the presence of some default keyboard shortcuts within these web editors. These shortcuts are essential for simulating actions such as selection, deletion, and text navigation.\n For a detailed explanation and the full list of these shortcuts, please refer to our documentation on experimental Monaco support.\n I also primarily tested it on Linux. Although I have translated shortcuts to be Mac-compatible too, I haven't tested it extensively.\n Try It Out: If you’re interested in testing this feature or want to see how Chrome-Emacs can enhance your coding sessions, visit the Chrome Web Store. Source code and installation instructions are available in this repository.\n https://i.redd.it/gk0m90kpl1sc1.gif\n    submitted by    /u/elgrekoo  \n [link]   [comments]",

Leave the productivity hamster wheel to the AIs.\n Let the lean times begin. We are stripping down our software as we do our souls. You are all invited to help us build Emins. Emins will run only on 8086 processors attached to VT52 terminals, eliminating all that overhead of window systems, multitasking OSes and all that #ifdefed C code. Lisp will be replaced with the direct control and numeric accuracy of the native instruction set. Key bindings will be limited to standard ones on C-a to C-z. Although this will make writing hard, it will save a lot of work and compositions that, let’s face it, are often written but not read. With all that extra time, we could finish the HURD, embed Scheme everywhere and write tools in simple languages to support all the complex languages people actually use.\n Come join us as we build Emins and keep a lid on the software complexity that only graybeards can handle.\n    submitted by    /u/rswgnu  \n [link]   [comments]",

I want to configure $EDITOR so that the instance of emacs running the terminal emulator is also used as $EDITOR on the server, when I'm sshed into it. Ideally, I'd like to set it up so that if I ssh from a terminal which isn't running in emacs, a different program (one local to the server, e.g. nano) will be used, but that's a later question.\n How can I do this? I've read a cursory explanation here, but that seems to require a shared filesystem, and it's pretty brief -- I'm new to any kind of networking.

For a while I've been mostly successfully being able to use Emacs in Termux for org-roam on my mobile phone. \n However, in the past few months any org-roam 'look-up' operations, like org-roam-node-insert, org-roam-node-find, &c. have become slower and slower. Worse, in the past couple of months, after doing one or two such operations it seems to get stuck indefinitely, and trying to cancel out with C-g does nothing the first time, and kills Emacs the second time.\n I'm not sure whether the issue is that my org-roam file library has continued to grow or whether it's to do with changes to Android (there have been a few Android OS updates in that time period). Or whether the issue is with accessing a larger sqlite database or whether it's to do with the actual file-lookup operations (more org-roam files over time).\n Is anyone in a similar situation? Any ideas of how to resolve this? Maybe at the Termux level?

It's org-brain and I can't really figure out where/what the first function call is. org-brain works by having a set of org files and the headings in org files to be ID'ed (UUID in a PROPERTIES drawer) then create a quasi-graph view of the org files and heading hierarchies in a graph/network-like child, parent, friend relationships between files and headings. So I'm trying to figure out how this whole thing starts. My guess is it takes org-element to parse out the ID attached to a file or headings, then creates some graph store cache. Or maybe not...\n Investigations found a use of org-refile here that will gather up all the headings in a designated directory, and, yes, org-brain does utilize org-refile, but just for actual refiling. Dead end. The org-brain author, who wants to not maintain anymore did say this:\n  \nThe entries are cached and stored in memory after the first \"scan\" of a session. I think there are ways to store the cache to disk.\n  \nbut I can't find how this is being done. AFAICT, org-brain simply starts with some location entry, a file or heading, and simply works-crawls in whatever direction from there, i.e., there is no cache in memory or hash table. That is, org-brain is nothing but the visualization and not a graph database management app. There is something referring to .org-id-locations, but I don't believe this is used in org-brain to create a cache.

If you're running this on Windows 11, running emacs & from a command line will launch Weston and Emacs.\n    submitted by    /u/regeya  \n [link]   [comments]",

Similar in look to line-blame or such. I use this, to add custom reminders/todos/notes to a bunch of code files at once.\n An example usecase: I work with 50 or so Ansible Environments. All of which share common Group and Hostvars. Sometimes, Variables change, get deprecated or we change how certain things work. In those cases, i add a note that get's displayed next to that variable. That way, when i'm working with an environments Group Vars, i can see when there's \"stuff to do\", changes to make or such. Having this done this way, allows me to make that note once and have it work across all my files.\n Does a package like that already exist?

If there are any interested experts here, I'd love to learn how to do something like this; especially the customization of how separator characters are displayed in the editor.\n Thank you all!\n    submitted by    /u/ykonstant  \n [link]   [comments]",

Was using NValt some time ago, but it's become grossly outdated and unstable.\nI love the idea behind The Archive and its implementation is both visually and conceptually appealing. However, I've discovered a couple of issues with it:\nThe most annoying one is when I get past one page of writing text in a note - in a particularly long paragraph, the frame starts jolting every time I press \"Space\" - scrolling quickly down and up, until I start a new paragraph, and then this behaviour disappears. It might be that this problem has already been reported, but I could not find it in the forum - perhaps I was using wrong keywords.\nAnother issue is with the displaying of the Cyrillic letter \"и\" (which roughly corresponds to the Latin \"i\" as in the word \"Tim\") - for some reason, occasionally it starts to be displayed with a different background to the rest of the text - as if there was a rectangle behind it. I didn't have enough play with different fonts and themes (using PrettyFunctional with Dark mode and the UbuntuMono-Regular 20.0 pt. at the moment)\nI hope someone can advise me on how to overcome the above issues, thank you!",

          "description": "As a polyglot software engineer by day (and by night, and in the morning, too), I'm always keen to tweak editors I use via any scripting language available. (I'm that weird guy in the dark corner of the room who likes BOTH Emacs AND Vim precisely because they are so extensible.)\nIn fact, org-roam for Emacs is what turned me onto Zettelkasten, but I (so far) like the system you've evolved for managing the Zettels better, which is why I went ahead and purchased The Archive. My only complaint is that The Archive limited to Mac OS X, because I work on Windoze and Linux as well.\nSo, any info about what you're planning that feature to entail would be of great interest to me.\nER",

Add to this discussion by telling us about your zettelkasten journey. Share with us what you're learning. Sharing helps me and, hopefully, you, too. It helps us clarify our goals and visualize our thinking. And sometimes, a conversation sparks a magical moment where we can dive into an idea worth exploring. We'd love to hear more from you.   🫵🏼\nIdeas I'm exploring with my ZK:\nI'm thinking a lot about metaphors and how they shape language. How they are used to communicate ideas. How they are used in ideation.\nI'm reexamining how I can refactor my structure notes, transforming them into thinking tools. What does this mean, and how can I formalize this for myself?\nI am integrating the project-driven areas of my life into my ZK. This week, my attention turned to melding my Samu Practice into my ZK, hoping for some serendipitical magic.\nTime slicing\nBooks I'm reading:\nSertillanges, A. G. and Ryan, Mary.
