If there's a more appropriate place for asking questions like this, please let me know.\n I'm very inexperienced with statically typed language (haven't used one in years), but I work in a research lab where we use Clojure, and as a thought experiment, I'm trying to work out how our core Clojure system would be implemented in Haskell. The key challenge seems to be that Haskell doesn't allow polymorphic lists--or I saw someone call them heterogeneous lists?--with more than one concrete type. That's gonna cause a big problem for me, unless I'm missing something.\n So we have this set of \"components.\" These are clojure objects that all have the same core functions defined on them (like a haskell typeclass), but they all do something different. Essentially, they each take in as input a list of elements, and then produce as output a new list of elements. These elements, like the components, are heterogeneous. They're implemented as Clojure hashmaps that essentially map from a keyword to anything. They could be implemented statically as records, but there would be many different records, and they'd all need to go into the same list (or set).\n So that's the challenge. We have a heterogenous set of components that we'd want to represent in a single list/set, and these produce a hetereogeneous set of elements that we'd want to represent in a single list/set. There might be maybe 30-40 of each of these, so representing every component in a single disjunctive data type doesn't seem feasible.\n Does that question make sense? I'm curious if there's a reasonable solution in Haskell that I'm missing. Thanks.\n    submitted by    /u/mister_drgn  \n [link]   [comments]",

However, after examining the code, it will still run separate transactions unless you call withTransaction and run everything in TransactionM.\n I thought about using some thread local state to store the current SqlBackend and use that if it's available, but I'm not sure if it's the right approach.\n How is this generally handled? We just want to have a single transaction per request, ideally with the ability to commit it and/or start a new one.\n    submitted by    /u/Standard-Function-44  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Lean 4 has a very cool feature that allows monadic do-blocks to contain imperative loops and mutable variables. This paper provides the motivation and theoretical underpinning.\n Since the concept is portable to any purely functional language supporting monad transformers, I thought it would be a fun experiment to implement it as a GHC plugin. The resulting plugin, donuts, allows for writing imperative style code such as this:\n guessPass :: IO Bool guessPass = do let Mut guesses = [] let Mut n = 1 :: Int whileL (n < 5) $ do putStrLn $ \"Enter guess #\" <> show n input <- getLine guesses := input : guesses when (input == \"secret123\") $ earlyReturn True n := n + 1 putStrLn $ \"All wrong: \" <> intercalate \", \" guesses pure False \n which the plugin desugars to monad transformer applications: ExceptT for control flow and StateT for mutable variables. Note that this works for any monadic do-block, not just IO.\n The imperativity is local in the sense that mutable variables are only mutable within the confines of the enclosing do-block's body statements as well as the bodies of loops occurring in that block. Similar restrictions apply for control flow commands such as earlyReturn, breakL, and continueL.\n    submitted by    /u/aaron-allen  \n [link]   [comments]",

Here is an example in JS:\n /**\n * Reduces a sequence of names to initials.\n * u/function makeInitials\n * u/param {String} authors A comma-delimited list of authors.\n * u/param {String} sep A period separating the initials.\n * u/param {String} trail A period ending the initials.\n * u/param {String} hyph A hyphen separating double-barrelled names.\n * u/return {String} Properly formatted initials.\n */\n function makeInitials(authors, sep = \".\", trail = \".\", hyph = \"-\") {\n const rDot = new RegExp(`[\\\\s${sep}]+`);\n return authors\n .replace(/\\\"(?:\\\\.|[^\\\"\\\\])*\\\"/g, \" \")\n .replaceAll('\"', \" \")\n .split(\",\")\n .filter((author) => author.replaceAll(sep, \"\").replaceAll(hyph, \"\").trim())\n .map(\n (author) =>\n author\n .split(hyph)\n .filter((barrel) => barrel.replaceAll(sep, \"\").trim())\n .map((barrel) =>\n barrel\n .split(rDot)\n .filter((name) => name)\n .map((name) => name[0])\n .join(sep)\n .toUpperCase(),\n )\n .join(hyph) + trail,\n )\n .join(\",\");\n }\n This kind of stuff looks pretty much the same in Dart, Kotlin, PHP, Rust, etc. Somehow I can't figure out how to structure it in Haskell. There must be a way to keep uniformity and readability in Haskell; autoformat should like it, too.\n PS I still can't figure out how to make code snippets readable.

          "description": "I've just switched over to ghcup and away from exclusively stack. I'm also trying to use Emacs' org-mode Babel, which is Jupyter notebook-style literate programming with more functionality than the Jupyter, IMHO. The going is not smooth getting the code blocks in the org-mode text to work, as they are run in a ghci session -- with all the restrictions such as multiple line versus single line to deal with. So when working with Haskell on org-mode, I first start a project with cabal init inside a directory, e.g., .../myproj. This will just be a skeleton, since I will throw my org-mode Babel files in this directory too. Next, I want to install Hackage packages, so I add them to the myproj.cabal build-depends section and do cabal run. Now, since org-mode's Babel is sending my Haskell code blocks to ghci, can that ghci session see and use the packages of myproj? If I do :show paths in the ghci buffer it reports .../myproj so no need to do a :cd <myprojdir> Very well. But my question is, does the ghci session see, can use my included packages from the project? As I understand, packages are installed per project (ergo per directory). But is there a global way with ghcup to install a package for all projects to use? For example, if I want QuickCheck globally and not have to include it per project, is this possible? Similarly, if I want to open a ghci REPL anywhere, how can I access packages?\n    submitted by    /u/teilchen010  \n [link]   [comments]",

Through the NASA tool Ogma [1] (also written in Haskell), Copilot also serves as a runtime monitoring backend for NASA's Core Flight System, Robot Operating System (ROS2), and FPrime (the software framework used in the Mars Helicopter) applications.\n This release drastically increases the test coverage of copilot-core.

It relies on the wonderful hs-opentelemetry project by Ian Duncan for all open telemetry functionality.\n  \ngithub\n hackage\n  \nThis is being used in production at my work and has provided useful insights around performance bottlenecks, exception context, and overall visibility into code execution.\n The plugin makes it so that you do not need to manually insert instrumentation code into function definitions, improving maintainability and reducing noise. By defining rules in a config file, you can specify which functions to instrument based on their return type or constraint context. This gives you control over whether you want the blanket approach of targeting your application's primary monad/constraint or a more conservative approach of defining a type that explicitly indicates that it will be instrumented.\n A MonadUnliftIO instance must be available for a function to be instrumentable. In particular, pure functions are not eligible.\n    submitted by    /u/aaron-allen  \n [link]   [comments]",

I can see why it works. But until yesterday I did not know that this method had a formal name - \"church encoding\".\n My question is\n  \nWhy does church encoding improve the performance of parser combinators? Surely it avoids the \"wrapping\"/\"unwrapping\" data into/out of constructors. So the abstraction and application of lambdas must be cheaper, right?\n And how much?

I've been searching for a new job for nearly 8 months, but I have been unemployed for almost 13. This job market has been absolutely brutal for me. My interviewing skills have gotten much stronger, but I haven't gotten any new tech screens for months. Just rejection after rejection. Needless to say, I'm branching out.\n F# is pretty much a no-go at this point. At any given time, it is entirely possible that there is not a single public job posting for an F# position. The positions that do pop up aren't often particularly good ones. Even so, I apply and get rejected without a tech screen.\n I'm currently examining Scala as an option, since many companies use it as a functional language. This would be very similar to my experience using C# as a functional language, and my direct FP experience in F#.\n I'd like to know what I would have to do to successfully make that transition to Scala. Specifically, what is the minimum that I'd have to learn about Scala to talk my way in? Or, is there a way I can sell myself such that I don't have to do any additional learning before I start a role as a Scala engineer?\n Thus far, I've gotten all rejections without tech screens for Scala positions just like everything else. But it's not clear to me that the companies using Scala recognize the connection between Scala and my current F#/C# experience. \n    submitted by    /u/TyphonExpanse  \n [link]   [comments]",

But I have found its template system confusing.\n I think there are two use cases:\n  \nCreating a new node (for this the templates work well)\n \nAdding data to an already existing node.\n \n The templates are also used when the user runs org-roam-node-find and the selected node-title does not exist. This is probably whey templates in org-roam behave very different than org templates.\n Last weekend I finally spent time and address some of these issues. The commits are here:\n https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam/compare/main...dmgerman:org-roam:main\n for example.The first template will only work when creating a new file (see :create-file). It will ask for the node-title and use it to create the file (the slug).\n  (add-to-list 'org-roam-capture-templates `(\"A\" \"area\" plain \"%?\" :target (file+head ,(eval (dmg-roam-build-path \"areas/${slug}.org\")) ,(eval (dmg-roam-template \"plain.txt\"))) :create-file yes :unnarrowed t)) \n If the path is provided, the user will not be asked for the destination. if the template has :create-file no, and the file does not exist, the capture will be aborted.\n In contrast, this template will ask for a node id, and then search for the \"Tasks\" header. node and node+olp will not create a new file.\n  (add-to-list 'org-roam-capture-templates `(\"t\" \"todo\" entry \"*** TODO %?\\n%t\\n%a\\n\\n%i\" :target (node+olp nil (\"Tasks\")) :unnarrowed t)) \n If the node id is provided, the user will NOT be asked for the node id.\n    submitted by    /u/dm_g  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "After recently discovering Org-Roam, I’m looking to migrate to a full Emacs setup, but there’s one non-negotiable feature I need to transfer: block references.\n Block references are links in one file to a block of text in another file by means of a uuid. The text is transcluded so you can preview the contents in any file it’s referenced and you can even see the number of backlinks to the original reference. There’s only one plugin that offers at least the uuid-based text block transclusion feature: Roam Block.\n So far, the solutions involved migrating everything from Logseq or Roam to Emacs Org-Mode, but losing block references by imputing the original referenced text in its place. I suspect the solution might look like obtaining the SQL or database file where all block uuids are referenced and somehow transfer this mapping to have the same uuid transcluded the same content. \n If anyone has some ideas as to how to achieve this, I’m more than either to start a conversation on the how. Please understand that I’m trying to keep block references, and cannot leave them out of the solution. So far I’ve found org-transclusion, two org-Logseq scripts on Awesome Logseq, and a roam-migration script, but none of these solutions seem to migrate the block references.\n This really seems like a no-brainer to solve, but I don’t know how would the solution look like. I’m open to any solution whether migrating from Logseq or Roam, as long as block references are migrated :)\n    submitted by    /u/marco_camilo  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Some URIs can contain URI fragments, e.g. foo.bar/baz#locator where locator is the fragment. See RFC 5147. Is there a way to reliably handle these in emacs?\n Here's my usecase: I use ebib, which lets me store a PDF filepath in a bibtex entry, then open the file at the filepath with a command when I'm viewing that entry. One problem with this is that often (in my discipline at least) the bibtex entry doesn't relate to a file, it relates to some part of a file (e.g. where the entry is for a paper published in a collection, and my file is a PDF of the whole collection). The obvious way to get around this is to store a URI with a fragment in the bibtex file field (e.g. path/to/my.pdf#page=210 for a paper which starts on page 210 of the collection). \n However, as far as I can tell, emacs doesn't support using URI fragments in finding files. Am I right/wrong? Is there a good known solution?\n To be clear, I know I could write a custom file handler function for ebib specifically, but that seems a bit too specific. I'd rather have a general way of handling this, so that ebib doesn't have to do anything unusual. That way, other applications which deal with the same cases (e.g. citar, in the case above) will inherit the same functionality.\n TIA!\n    submitted by    /u/Jack-o-tall-tales  \n [link]   [comments]",

One is invoking sudo directly, which requires entering my password each time I use it. The other is using tramp; if I try to use it, then in order to terminate the ability to use sudo without a password, I need to terminate the created tramp sudo connection. I could probably solve it by closing such a connection automatically after a certain period, but I can't even find a function that lists all active tramp connections. I saw a discussion on the internet suggesting:\n (setq eshell-prefer-lisp-variables t)\n (setq password-cache t)\n (setq password-cache-expiry 10)\n But it doesn't do anything for my case.There's a command called 'tramp-cleanup-connection'. If I use it on a buffer where I opened a sudo connection, I see something like '/sudo:root@archlinux:', and choosing this connection to close doesn't do anything.

I have an idea for a note-taking program that's as nice-looking, performant and friendly as logseq or obsidian, but is fully backed by emacs and org-mode. I need features like tags, transclusion and backlinks, but also want all of Emacs: keyboard macros, eval'ed source blocks, LSP mode, etc. -- but over it all I want a smooth modern UI. I know some folks here will tell me how it's possible in emacs; believe me, I've looked into the options for some years now (org-roam, org-logseq, org-transclusion, org-roam-ui and more) and the ones I've seen are slow or fragile or never bore fruit, so just bear with me and see if we can explore this idea.\n What I'd like is to run emacs in a headless way and sync, in realtime, a set of buffers to a modern UI (maybe electron, who knows). Let's say we have a page in the UI, composed of a set of buffers (a buffer per block, maybe with sub-\"buffers\" transcluded into the UI), and the UI knows which emacs buffer corresponds to each block of text. My idea is the UI forwards keyboard & mouse events to emacs and receives buffer updates (including text props & overlays etc.), which it then displays in an integrated nice way. Could such a thing even be done? I don't want to scrape the emacs pixels -- I want to \"export\" the meaningful contents of the buffer for display over a socket protocol. Text, properties, overlays, images, etc. with their semantics. \n It seems like such a thing could be useful for other purposes as well, like using emacs to edit any text field in any app. Possibly even emacs could then run as an http service as the back end of a web app to run on Android or iOS. I'm sure I'm not the first to think of doing this; has anyone tried it before? What was learned?\n    submitted by    /u/simplex5d  \n [link]   [comments]",

I also use a custom user.js and UBlock Origin to enhance privacy and security. Pages load very fast. Minimal strain on cpu and enhanced battery life.\n Vimium: Far from perfect, as many standard emacs keybindings like M-> for (end-of-buffer), cannot be implemented. Setting ui.accelKey to 18, ui.key.chromeAccess to 0 and devtools.editor.keymap to \"emacs\" helped.\n GTK2/3: Setting gtk-theme-name = \"Emacs\" really helps and makes editing input fields feel great. Unfortunately this won't be supported anymore once firefox migrates from GTK3 to GTK4.\n  \nMaybe my standards are too high and I should just be happy with what I have.\n But so far I am not willing to give up on it, as my browsing experience is really the last puzzle piece missing to an otherwise perfect workflow.\n Alternative:\n Out of all the alternatives I like Nyxt by far the most.\n It truly supports emacs keybindings and I love the minibuffer. It is a joy to move around.\n If it only was possible to have extensions like UBlock Origin and maybe even swap out WebkitGTK in favor of Firefox's Gecko Engine, I'd make Nyxt my daily driver immediately and never look back. It would be a dream come true.\n I'd really appreciate if some of you guys with requirements similar to mine (vanilla keys, ad-blocking, security and privacy concerns) could share their workflow.\n Although a student on a very tight budget, I'll probably have to start donating regularly to Nyxt to keep my hopes alive.\n    submitted by    /u/schwinghmmr  \n [link]   [comments]",

For instance, if I try and use C-h r, Emacs reports \"C-h C-r is undefined\"; I don't get why this is the case, because I am holding down the CTRL key, then pressing h, then pressing r, then releasing CTRL, but it seems like Emacs is reading 2 separate presses of CTRL?.

I know I can use C-x C-f to find a file, but it autofills c:/Program Files/Emacs; is this normal? I thought the init.el is in ~/<USERNAME>/AppData/Roaming/.emacs.d/init.el/?

(Upcoming changes from Google will disable Manifest V2 extensions in Chrome by June 2024.)\n Text, Scroll, & Selection Sync: Provides real-time text, cursor, and selection synchronization between Emacs and the browser.\n Enhanced File Management and Auto Major Mode Detection: Offers improved handling for a smoother experience, supporting features like linting and auto-completion.\n Editable Area Navigation: Quickly switch between editable fields in complex web pages with hints.\n  \nCompatibility Note: These enhancements are in a fork, requiring an accompanying fork of the atomic-chrome.el package for full benefits. They still work with the original package for basic functionalities, though.\n Collaboration over Competition: I admire the original atomic-chrome.el project and intend this fork as a contribution, not a replacement. My goal is to merge these improvements back into the original to benefit everyone. I also admire the original atomic-chrome extension.\n Difference from Other Extensions:\n  \nVs. GhostEditor: While a fantastic tool for bidirectional editing, it lacks real-time cursor and selection sync and is still based on Manifest V2.\n Vs. Edit with Emacs: Applies changes but not in live mode and isn’t bidirectional. It also doesn’t cater to online editors, operating on Manifest V2.\n  \nI'm eager to hear feedback, suggestions, and welcome contributions.\n The link to the extension in the Chrome Web Store is here.\n    submitted by    /u/elgrekoo  \n [link]   [comments]",

Please feel free to roast my config and poke holes in it and suggest some improvements :)\n Currently I have 2 folders core/ (for emacs internal stuff) and modules/ (for packages) where core/core-init.el is sourced (required) from my init.el and it in turn sources the rest of core/ and all from modules/. Previously, what I have done for modules is that I've put the (elpaca-wait) command in each module, so that after each module is read elpaca processes the queue immediately and activates the package (at least that's what I thought it did from how I understood it before).\n Since then, I've come to learn that elpaca processes the packages queue after reading the init file, so that made me think that it's enough to call (elpaca-wait) only once at the end of my init.el after all the modules have been read -- which is what I did, however, now on startup I get warnings about bunch of packages that says:\n  \nef-themes loaded before Elpaca activation (analogously for the others) and all of those packages are inactive and some of my settings for the font, theme, orderless, consult etc. aren't respected.\n  \nBefore I go ahead and refactor and fix everything, is my understanding correct that it is enough to write all package configs and then call (elpaca-wait) once at the end of my init.el for it to process and load all my package configs? If not, when should I call (elpaca-wait)?\n What is \"the best\" (a good, optimal) way of making as much use of Elpaca's async powers as possible?

          "description": "Hey guys, I have jumped back to Emacs after using regular editors (for quite a while). I've been using avy and the likes to accelerate my navigations. And they are awesome! The one big problem I have with emacs is the scrolling. When it scrolls the whole screen changes, including the point, which loses all points of reference. I have tried using ways like scrolling only half a screen, smooth scrolling, or resorting to using my mouse (which sucks btw). In the end, I've settled down with good-scroll for full-screen scrolls, and repeated C-u C-n/C-u C-ps. And there's that.\n Except it isn't. Because now the problem becomes horizontal scrolling. For example, the code in the header image. If I were to, say, scroll down while reading the code, I don't really have a friendly way to scroll horizontally and back. Like, there's always this violent skip which makes me think \"oh where was I again?\" If I was using regular code editors like Kate, I can scroll horizontally using the mouse, and the scrolling will be smooth so I can conveniently track and read the code. But for hscroll, there's only C-e and M-m in emacs (at least to my knowledge). I guess there's M-f etc as well, but they move too slowly so it's not as efficient.\n So what I am looking for? Well something like C-l that places the point in the center, except this time it's horizontally centered as well. The other thing is during these horizontal scrolls and I move the point down, and the next line is not as long as the previous one, it skips back to the left and when the next line length is long enough, it skips back again. If there's something that can preserve horizontal point offset during these scrolls it'll be awesome. But not something like scroll-left because I have to manually scroll-right to get back.\n    submitted by    /u/42yeah  \n [link]   [comments]",

Unsurprisingly, I belong in the same boat: using (neo)vim for the past 5 years and have setup a window-manager setup with bindings all very akin to vim (heck I even have a firefox addon to emulate vim inside my browser for moving around).\n Now, I don't wish to learn emacs the vim-way and would like to learn it with default keybindings (makes it easier to follow docs, works well with other packages, etc.) but I'm afraid that'll make me \"unlearn\" the bindings I have in place that are more vim like. Heck, I'm scared I might unlearn vim itself.\n What I want to know is if it's possible to use emacs bindings inside emacs and my custom (vim) bindings outside it? Has anyone encountered this and made it work? Thanks in advance!\n    submitted by    /u/kn0xchad  \n [link]   [comments]",

Hopefully you have some ideas!\n The tl;dr is that I'm keen to find a way to edit files on remote Windows hosts using ssh as the protocol from a Linux host.\n I'm a Linux user through-and-through but have to manage Windows boxen sometimes. Modern Windows can run sshd, though, and combined with powershell, managing remote Windows hosts is actually bearable. However, I'd prefer to edit files within my local emacs session rather than through a terminal running ssh. The challenge is finding the right C-x C-f path spec to connect to a remote ssh host that works when that target is running Windows (with all those caveats).\n Some considerations:\n  \nI know that I can connect to Windows hosts remotely via ssh correctly and passwordless. I can edit the login shell, I've tinkered with both cmd.exe and pwsh.exe without much success.\n I do have the ability to target sh.exe or bash.exe, although I haven't managed to make that work either (by changing TRAMP connection properties for the remote host)\n I assume there may be something I need to set to make the connection \"aware\" that the remote is Windows despite connecting over ssh, though I'm not sure what that setting might be (for example, changing a line ending setting)\n  \nI'd love any ideas or help with this.\n    submitted by    /u/leothrix  \n [link]   [comments]",

It just says that it cannot find vterm-mode. vterm works, so the mode is there but nope - vterm keeps on scrolling down to the prompt, making going through logs or things like that impossible - LSP seems to be unable to find my .venv and use the pyright inside, even when I start it from the shell\n It is possible that I am 'holding it the wrong way' but I am not ready to change my full workflow for this.\n This is not a complain, just a post so people see what it is if you are not an expert - Google shows no solutions to these issues, no matter what I do and I don't have the time to fix them. I understand that Emacs is more of a 'here are the parts, put them together in any way you want' but that same approach, while mitigated by distributions like Spacemacs, make it way harder for people who need to get things done now, if you happen to hit any issues.\n    submitted by    /u/g_tb  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "This is something that has bothered me for many years now, but I was always too lazy to dig in. Well, this time I'm at least not too lazy to ask:\n Is there a way to make Emacs buffer ordering be per-window and remembered separately for each window?\n The way I work is using eyebrowse to create \"screens\" or \"workspaces\" (I used escreen before eyebrowse, a long time ago). Each of these is usually further separated into windows. That means that certain buffers naturally end up \"belonging\" in certain workspaces. For example, my Clojure REPL always lives in screen 4.\n This setup is great, but the way buffer switching works doesn't play nice with it. If I jump from screen 1 to screen 4 and back to 1, my previous buffer will be my REPL, which is not what I want. Screen 1, and more specifically, the window in that screen that I'm working in, should remember which buffers were used in it recently, so that I can use previous-buffer/next-buffer predictably.\n I think I would expect all other buffers (ones not visited in that window) to be appended at the end, as I don't want to limit myself. I might want to switch to some of those some day.\n Does something like this exist? Is it possible at all?\n    submitted by    /u/jwr  \n [link]   [comments]",

The idea is to pretend company-complete has been called from inside a \\ref.\n This is a simple example\n  (defun f1 () (interactive) (insert \"\\\\ref{}\") (backward-char) (company-complete) ;; now choose the completion, etc (backward-char 4) (insert \"i_used_to_be_a_\")) \n If the above worked, I'd be using company-completeas if it was being called from a \\ref, but then I'd modify the \\ref to, in this example, \\i_used_to_be_a_ref.\n The problem is that the above immediately modifies \\ref, but I never get to choose the completions . I've tried variations of the above, like call-interactively, without success. I think I am missing something very obvious (emacs lisp novice here).\n Why do I want to do this? Because I want to use company-complete for arbitrary macros in latex as if they were \\ref. I can do this modifying company-reftex's company-reftex-labels-regexp, but ideally I'd like to do it without modifying that variable, or when company-reftex is not called, for example when using LSP.\n    submitted by    /u/rdiaz02  \n [link]   [comments]",

I will open a tmux session in my terminal emulator and keep a window open for whatever number of the projects I'm working with on. Typically I will use an alias to open a project in a new window, open neovim, and open a vertical split with a shell for running the project.\n The thing I like about this is it's super easy to switch between projects and they all keep whatever pane layout I have set up. I can also spawn new windows for any other work I need to do.\n I'm not really getting how I can do this in emacs. I have set up dashboard.el and projectile.el and can open a project, but I have to then open another emacs frame if I want to open another project.

          "description": "Suppose I call completing-read-multiple with the following list of candidates: \n (\"1\" \"2,3\" \"4,5,6\") \n If the value of crm-separator is [ \\t]*,[ \\t]*, selecting the second candidate will result in the list (\"2\" \"3\"), and not (as one might have expected) (\"2, 3\"). This is not very surprising of course, and if you are building your own completion tables for use with completing-read-multiple, the problem can be avoided by keeping the value of crm-separator in mind. The problem is that sometimes the completion table is generated on the basis of input the user may have no control over. \n For example, in mu4e there's a function mu4e-view-save-attachments which does what the name suggests: it lists all attachments in a given message for the user to choose (possibly more than one) and then saves the selected attachments in a specific directory. If you are dealing with a message with files whose names contain a comma, selecting one of those files will lead to trouble. \n Now, I can just define a little function that will temporarily change the value of crm-separator to handle these cases, e.g.: \n (defun my/toggle-crm-separator () (interactive) (let ((original-separator \"[ \\t]*,[ \\t]*\")) (if (string= crm-separator original-separator) (let ((separator (completing-read \"Select one of the following options\" '(\";\" \",,\" \"-\")))) (setq crm-separator (replace-regexp-in-string \",\" separator crm-separator))) (setq crm-separator original-separator)))) \n Still, I wonder if there's a smarter solution out there. Off the cuff, I can imagine scanning the completion candidates to ensure none of them contain an instance of the value of crm-separator and, if they do, at least alerting the user of the need to pick a different value for crm-separator? But I don't know if there's a better way to handle this situation. \n Thoughts?\n    submitted by    /u/graduale  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Greetings everyone,\n I wanted to share a function that I've found incredibly useful while conducting qualitative data analysis of interviews. During this type of research, structuring my interview data and maintaining a clear overview is crucial. To assist with this, I've developed a function in Emacs Lisp that uses tags to extract specific headlines into a new buffer.\n This function, extract-headlines-by-tag, prompts the user to enter a tag. The function then scans the entire buffer, and for each headline that contains the specified tag, it extracts not only the headline but also its content. These extracted parts are then transferred into a new buffer. I've made the new buffer pop up for immediate review after the extraction process.\n Here's the piece of code:\n (defun extract-headlines-by-tag (tag) \"Extract headlines and their content from current buffer by TAG.\" (interactive \"sEnter tag: \") (save-excursion (let ((result-buffer (generate-new-buffer (concat \"/Extracted Headlines \" tag \"*\")))) (with-current-buffer result-buffer (org-mode) (insert \"* Extracted Headlines by Tag: \" tag \" *\\n\\n\")) (org-element-map (org-element-parse-buffer) 'headline (lambda (headline) (when (member tag (org-element-property :tags headline)) (with-current-buffer result-buffer (insert (org-element-interpret-data headline) \"\\n\"))))) (pop-to-buffer result-buffer)))) \n This has greatly improved the way I manage and analyze my qualitative interview data.

          "description": "I implemented a custom JSON parser for emacs. Instead of using a library which creates an intermediary JSON representation which is then converted to Lisp objects, my solution creates Lisps objects from the JSON stream without any intermediary steps.\n Measured by ~1 MB of clang LSP messages, it works ~8x faster than the current emacs JSON parser. Maybe it can be helpful for people whose LSP works slowly, as an alternative solution to emacs-lsp-booster (I didn't do any comparisons).\n You can check out the faster-json-parsing branch here: https://github.com/geza-herman/emacs/tree/faster-json-parsing. Is it based on master, but I think it can be easily applied to any recent version of Emacs (it's just one commit).\n This JSON parser misses some error handling, like for example it doesn't check for utf-8 encoding errors. So please consider it as a proof of concept, not as a production quality thing. But I've been using it for a while, it works for me with clangd perfectly.\n    submitted by    /u/geza42  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I created an emacs extension named org-linker that allows users to link a file in org-mode (the attachment is identified as a UUID), offering a secure and flexible method for referring to other files in org-mode. Try it out!\n Comparison with org-attach\n org-linker differs from org-attach in its approach to file attachment. \n org-attach uses an org heading as a basic storing unit, which can lead to issues if not managed carefully (e.g. refiling or adding shadowing subtrees). \n On the other hand, org-linker assigns a unique UUID to each attached file, ensuring a more robust linkage system. By treating individual files as the fundamental unit, org-linker provides a safer and more flexible approach to handling attachments in org-mode documents. For example, this allows easy movement and copying of links across various org files and headings.\n Both tools have their strengths and are suitable for different use cases. However, if you prioritize a secure and straightforward attachment system, org-linker might be the preferred choice.\n Example\n For instance, if the root is /tmp/org-linker/, and the UUID for the transaction is 20240101-235959, and the file is readme.md, the file will be copied to /tmp/org-linker/20240101-235959/readme.md with the transaction recorded in /tmp/org-linker/db.tx. And an org-link [[linker:20240101-235959/readme.md]] is inserted at point.\n You can customize the uuid generator. In particular, you don't have to use timestamp.\n You can also remove the uuid easily by fuzzy searching with M-x org-linker/trash-folder-uuid, or just remove the uuid at point with M-x org-linker/trash-folder-at-point. The trashing function is customizable too.\n Contributions\n Feel free to contribute by submitting pull requests, raising issues, or sharing your ideas!\n    submitted by    /u/jin-cg  \n [link]   [comments]",

After trying it frustratingly, I manage to get back to the mode where I can actually start typing.\n Even having to check the statusbar every time before I need to do something does not seem correct to me. Is this what everybody does or am I missing something fundamental?\n ​\n ​\n    submitted by    /u/sunshine-and-sorrow  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Okay, I've finally gotten around to setting up emacs-lsp-booster, and my first impression is: it works. And it works really well. I already liked LSP-Mode in general, but it was too slow for my very large Unreal project. I'd get constant timeouts, suggestions and completions just outright wouldn't work, and it was a very disappointing experience.\n I switched to LSP-Bridge because it promised better performance, and that was 100% true. It did completions where LSP-Mode and Eglot would choke, but it was a bit of a hassle to set up. I'm on a Windows machine and that always makes things a little more complicated for me. I had to make sure to write a project-root-finding-function or it wouldn't understand my project setup (devs: not everyone uses git, stop assuming that we do), etc.\n Ultimately, I'm switching back to LSP-Mode because it integrates with xref and helm and various other things a lot better. The LSP-Bridge built-in completion is adequate, but it worked in ways that I wasn't expecting/didn't like (the lsp-bridge-find-references function, for example, would split the buffer, and when I quit it, sometimes it would kill the buffer I'd been visiting as well. User error? A bug? Don't know.) You just end up having more flexibility with lsp-mode.\n What I can tell you is that no matter how you slice it, for a project of moderate to large size, you should be using something like lsp-bridge or emacs-lsp-booster. (For reference, based on my compile-commands.json file, there are about 17000 files in my project.)\n Also, it seems that the root of this problem is emacs' ability (or lack thereof) to parse JSON efficiently. That really should be looked at; emacs-lsp-booster is a project that shouldn't have to exist, but I'm grateful that it does.\n    submitted by    /u/vjgoh  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi, I have a feature in mind that I can't find, but am also struggling to articulate, so I'm still not sure if it exists or not!\n I'm thinking of something like literate programming, but without tangling, as the source code lives in files separately from the text. Instead of source blocks containing code in the literate document, the literate document instead specifies \"views\" into the source files. The views would be specified by a file name and a line number range, and that range of lines would be visible in the literate buffer as if that was where the text lived, but it actually lives in its own source file.\n So on-disk this \"view src block\" might look like this:\n ```\n +begin_view :file src/main.rs :lines 120-124\n +end_view\n ```\n Whereas in the emacs buffer it might look like this:\n ```\n +begin_view :file src/main.rs :lines 120-124\n let rectangle = Rectangle { length: 3.0, height: 4.0 }; let triangle = Triangle { length: 3.0, height: 4.0 }; print_debug(&rectangle); println!(\"Area: {}\", area(&rectangle));\n +end_view\n ```\n Editing text within this view would be propagated back to the source file, and adding a newline at the end of the view would increment the end of the line range.\n The motivations for this would be avoiding problems with eglot/lsp in an org document for example, or a document explaining some bits of code in detail, without committing to the full literate workflow.\n Does this have a name and does anyone know of any implementations of something similar to this?

To do this I had to install several packages and also add some elisp to my .emacs as mentioned on the websites of those packages.\n If i need to replicate this configuration later, maybe on another machine, how can I do it easily without having to go Googling again? Like is there some code to ensure that if a particular package is not found it will be installed automatically by Emacs, so the elisp in the .emacs that deals with this package wont throw an error? I do keep a record of my .emacs in my GitHub\n I don't know how to put this in a better way, but I just want to be able to replicate this configuration with another emacs installation without the same amount of effort.\n    submitted by    /u/redditisinmyheart  \n [link]   [comments]",

I asked ChatGPT about this and it says this enables deep integration between the shell and emacs. But, what does that even mean?

So what kind of integration are we talking about?\n I'm coming from the vim world and just been using Emacs since a few days. So I'm trying to understand it. I'm really curious what people actually do in Eshell that the other shells can't do.\n EDIT: Got some great, insightful answers. I'm glad I asked this. Clearly there's a lot for me to learn.

          "description": "Hi, everyone. I wanted to post a quick tip to help other noobs like myself. I love org-capture, but I sometimes want to make a completely new file out of quick note, rather than append it to an existing org-mode file. I searched and only found outdated or kind of hard-to-understand answers. So here is a quick snippet to put into your init.el and capture templates to enable creating a new file. \n (defun jj/open-new-project-file () (let ((fpath (read-file-name \"File name: \" \"~/Sync/inbox/\" nil nil nil))) \n As prescribed in the org docs, this creates a new function that will prompt you for a file name to create, starting in the directory you specify in the function. Then, in your org-capture templates add:\n (\"i\" \"New note in Inbox\" plain (function jj/open-new-project-file) \"#+title: %?\") \n This will use your function to create the file and set your cursor ready to type the title in your new org file.\n ​\n I hope this helps someone. I know most people would probably just append to an inbox.org file or similar. I was doing the same thing, but after reading Building a Second Brain, I'm trying to separate the notes into files that can be dragged-and-dropped via Treemacs into the PARA setup I've made. It's a little simpler than trying to use org-refile because in the PARA method, your directories are constantly changing and moving.\n ​\n This solution was heavily inspired by this post: https://www.jesseevers.com/org-capture-function/\n I just modified it to fit my own use case and thought someone searching on Google in the future might appreciate it.

The problem is that reftex-citation takes you to RefTeX's mechanism for choosing the bibliographic reference, which is not company-reftex.\n So I am now doing this:\n  ;; From my reftex-cite-format; for real, this is a longer list (defvar my-cite-options '(\"\\\\cite[][]{}\" \"\\\\citep[][]{}\" \"\\\\citealp[][]{}\" \"\\\\citep[][p.~]{}\")) (defun my-cite-menu () \"Insert citation based on user choice.\" (interactive) (insert (completing-read \"Choose citation type: \" my-cite-options)) (backward-char) (company-complete)) ;; Preserve muscle memory (bind-key (kbd \"C-c [\") 'my-cite-menu reftex-mode-map) \n (Same comments apply to reftex-reference, where I reuse my reftex-ref-style-alist, and create a my-reference-menu).\n This seems to me like the obvious solution because: a) it preserves muscle memory; b) I can reuse my lists of citation options and reference styles, and if I wanted to go back to a pure-reftex solution it would be simple; c) I can continue easily choosing structure; d) I use company-reftex; e) it seems simple enough.\n But I have not found anything similar when searching for it.

Instead, it prompts for normal (non-backup) buffers.\n I don't know *why* it continually updates the backup files if I have a [/] in the header, but it does.

Anyways, your gptel package is just what I need in order to have gpt4all working smoothly in emacs.

Currently, the way I start the daemon is with systemd. I enable and start the service as the documentation shows.\n The issue has to do with where the daemon creates the socket. Sometimes when I boot up my machine, everything works exactly as I expect it to: I can simply run `emacsclient -nc` and it pops right up. I can also set my shell environment variable EDITOR to emacsclient and open files easily that way. When things are working right, I note that the socket is in /run/user/userID/emacs/server.\n Probably half the time I boot up, the socket is in ~/.emacs.d/server/server, which means I have to pass the path to the socket to emacsclient for it to work. This means I have to change the scripts bound to my keybindings, etc., every time this happens. Pain in the butt. And for some reason I don't understand, setting EDITOR=emacsclient -cn -s /path/to/server doesn't work the way I want it to. It opens up a new frame, but does not open a buffer with the current file.\n So my questions more broadly are\n  \nHow does Emacs determine where it creates the socket? You would think it just looks at server-socket-dir, but there's obviously more to it than that, because it changes it up on me regardless of whether I explicitly set that variable.\n And does anybody have any hunches as to what could be causing it to seemingly randomly flip back and forth between socket locations?\n  \n   submitted by    /u/Exact_Willingness_25  \n [link]   [comments]",

These notes are spread over a lot of directories on my system and in different formats (.txt, .md, .doc). Migration to org-roam will make navigating through all of my notes much more comfortable and I already migrated most of my notes.\n The last notes I want to migrate have a \"directory context\". For instance holiday notes in my pictures directory. I am considering to copy/paste these files to org-roam and add a tag to the directory and delete the old note. The downside is that this is kinda an org-roam lock in, because migrating these notes back could be a PITA. If I use a special tag in the roam-note to the original directory then it is possible to migrate the files back with a simple elisp script I guess but could break when directories are renamed in the future. Hopefully I am making myself clear .\n Just before sending this to Reddit a light bulb went off. I could copy/paste the original note in the org-roam note in a code block and tangle it to this directory. I would prefer to not use a code block but something like this seems to be the way.\n How are you guys dealing with old \"directory context\" notes?\n    submitted by    /u/kolerezooi  \n [link]   [comments]",

Here comes a lot of bla-bla, just skip to the Itaic part: I summarised the introduction to the Zettelkasten (this -> °Link°) to get an overview etc. and used 1700 words, but i think thats to much especially if I took a look at the Luhmanns Archive. I worked like with a Word document, so I made different headings and summarised different chapters of the text under them. (I copied a lot although you're not supposed to do that)\nSo: how long should the different note types (literature and permanent) be, what should they contain and how many should I make on a certain topic or source? (no bla-bla anymore)\nIt would be nice if you could take a look at the first 2 or 3 \"chapters\" (link above) and tell me what your Zettel would look like.\ncheers.",

Since then I always want to have a systematic study on how to prevent complications, plan my diet and exercises.\nI just need to figure out where to begin all this.\nMy current plan is to use the DK's Diabete's Handbook as a lead-in, which I hope could give me a systematic overview, and then I plan to add more articles and books to each part of the topic.\nThen I start my plan last week by reading the handbook,  but I notice I have no idea how to read a book. I admit it indeed sounds silly. I was a good student when I was in the college. Now I'm not. I don't know what to do when I go through each line, paragraph on the page.\nSo I'm wondering if anyone could share a realistic approach to read a book/books/article. By realistic, I mean I really hope it's not some theory education with really confused vocabularies. Think me like a 12 year old student, not some top scientists.\nThank you and wish you all well.",

          "description": "Hello!\nYesterday, I experienced a situation that I'm surprised I didn't notice before.\nWhen we use object tags, we seek to identify the objects interacting in a note's main argument. However, there are times when those objects may refer to qualities one may or may not have.\nFor example, let's imagine I have two different notes where I explain the following ideas:\n(1) Being too strict causes problems\nIn note (1), we could identify the object tag #strict. While in note (2), we could identify #relaxed as an object tag. However, the important point is that this decision is arbitrary. I could perfectly well have written the notes as follows:\n(1a) Being too strict causes problems\nor\n(1b) Being not enough relaxed causes problems\nIn notes (1a) and (2a), I would have identified #strict. In notes (1b) and (2b), I would have identified #relaxed. However, all notes talk about the same object idea: there is a right amount of strictness/relaxation that avoids problems.\nSo, my question is the following:\nHow would you handle this situation?\nDo I accept this arbitrariness and continue using both object tags?\nOr, do I try to find a way to avoid this arbitrariness?\n\nThe example I showed is a simplification of a text I am processing about Semantic Versioning: https://semver.org/\nThe paragraph that provoked this situation was the following:\n\n  \nIf the dependency specifications are too tight, you are in danger of version lock (the inability to upgrade a package without having to release new versions of every dependent package). If dependencies are specified too loosely, you will inevitably be bitten by version promiscuity (assuming compatibility with more future versions than is reasonable)\n\n\nUsing too tight or too loosely dependency specifications casues problems :-)",

Specifically, in the video above, it seems that elaborative encoding might not be as effective without the schema being represented well to the learner first when they are a novice.\nIt seems that a lot of the ideas around ZKM or just Zettelkasten more generally are heavily founded upon deep processing or elaborative encoding from a more constructivist flavor.\nI was wondering if there was more of a need for worked examples as one develops knowledge within their ZK and even as one works on getting better at the method itself (ZKM).\nWould love to hear if any others have thoughts on this.\nNote: I know that Math is focused on this video. But, it seems to me that zettling is a practice/skill. And, even a lot of what we develop within the ZK should be able to used in some skill. So, worked examples seems relevant.

This alone is a fine-tuned game-changer. If the GPT had a persona, it would be a smart, but not snarky, it would be patient, but not hold back, it would act with my best interests in mind. The GPT doesn't have a persona. It is a huge algorithm of 'linked knowledge,' and the benefit comes from its ability to pull out appropriate threads and apply them to the case at hand.\nMy role in this shindig is to be honest when reviewing the critique. I dream of \"What Would Richard Feynman Do?\" Maybe I should get this tattooed on my wrist. W.W.R.F.D. This would be a great slogan to go along with zettelkasting.  Try to be responsible and not give up independence to the machine. That doesn't mean that the GPT is wrong in its critique, it means the it should be viewed like any tutorial, describing best practices while leaving open the opportunities to think in ways that support your individual style and goals.",

          "description": "20240306154602 The algorithm of Neocortex\n #map #neuro #intelligence\nIn science existence of many constraints make it harder to find a model that fits. However, after an eureka moment all constraints seem harmonious.\nIn his book A Thousand Brains Hawkins look for a uniform algorithm implemented by cortical columns, the neural unit of neocortex.\nMechanism\nBrain constantly tries to predict its inputs. When there is a mismatch between predictions and an input, the system immediately notices. Our model of the world being inaccurate deserves evolutionary attention.\nThe model we construct is not separate from our body. Neocortex, not being a simple I/O circuit stores data in reference frames  Meaning, we encode the location of a cup relative to our hand for instance.\nThe reasoning goes for abstract knowledge too. There are no \"is\" statements in the world.\nI'm trying to go through a paradigm-shift in my understanding of Zettling, from \"PKM\" to keeping a ZK. Here is a simple structure note I created to dive deep into a topic, short because I haven't split it into parts yet to work deeply. But I don't know how to proceed. Any help is much appreciated.",

          "description": "Hello! :-)\nIt is good practice to keep the titles of a Zettel short:\nOn the one hand, the task of writing a short title helps the learning process.\nOn the other hand, the visualization of the notes is better if the title is short.\nHowever, my question is, do you know if there is a sweet spot for the length of a title?\nIn my case, I try to write titles of 80 characters or less (with the UUID included). I selected this quantity due to my background in programming, where it is recommended to limit code lines to 80 characters. In my experience, this length is a good challenge that helps both objectives (1) and (2).\nBut I am considering increasing it a bit: maybe 100 characters.\nWhat maximum length for titles do you use?",
