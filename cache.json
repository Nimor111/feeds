I can't get enough of it.\n I'm finding the language difficult at times. Not because the language itself is difficult - it isn't - but for a few other reasons:\n 1) Learning resources are far more limited than for other languages. Resources for learning on mobile, in particular, seem almost non-existent. Does anyone have any they'd recommend?\n 2) When my code doesn't work, I find Haskell's error messages very hard to interpret. Does this get easier?\n 3) Input/output seems trickier than elsewhere. Anyone have anything I can read that might make them click? I've been mainly solving Codewars problems so I can bypass my input/output block.\n    submitted by    /u/tb5841  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "One of Haskell's arguably most important and interesting features is lazy evaluation.\n As a novice / intermediate (I started learning Haskell about a year ago and am really enjoying it!), I still can't explain the advantages of lazy evaluation in real world applications. \n After a bit of duckduckgoing, the first benefit that is often mentioned is the ability to create infinite data structures. While that is certainly interesting and fun to work with, it feels somewhat gimmicky to me. As mentioned, I am a novice, so I wonder, are infinite data structures a feature you regularly use in real world applications, and are they important in these applications? By that I mean that they are clearly better to use in that position than code without the infinite data structure?\n Another benefit that is often mentioned is the possibility to define control structures in normal code. To my understanding, this is the case for many monad combinators such as when or replicateM, and so on. Again I wonder how relevant this is in real applications, as most programming languages suffice with a few basic control structures.\n Furthermore, it seems that the monadic control structures still require the do notation to be useful, which is not defined in normal code, and when defining control structures for a new type class (such as arrows), new syntax defined outside of normal code is still required, as arrows seem to have their own special variant of do notation.\n Finally, there seems to be a performance trade off with haskells lazy evaluation, as lazy evaluation inherently has overhead, but might avoid unnecessary calculations. I wonder if these unnecessary calculations could not be avoided by better programming?\n All in all, how useful is haskells lazy evaluation, and is it a feature that should be adopted by other (new) programming languages? Or maybe is that a question that is still being researched / explored?\n    submitted by    /u/gluesniffer187  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm currently learning Haskell, and I'm practicing doing the Advent of Code 2023.\n I'm a bit struggling with the performance of my solution for 2023 day 6, part 2.\n At first, here's the solution I did a month ago in Go: main.go. Basically, I iterate from 1 to raceTime, and count the number of times where applying a function is bigger than a specific value. Note that raceTime can be pretty big (in my case it's 55826490). The result is executed in a few milliseconds.\n I did the same in Haskell: Main.hs:\n ``` numberOfWays :: Int -> Int -> Int numberOfWays time distance = foldl' (\\acc i -> acc + (travelDistance i time distance)) 0 [1 .. (time - 1)]\n travelDistance :: Int -> Int -> Int -> Int travelDistance hold raceTime distance = if (raceTime - hold) * hold > distance then 1 else 0 ```\n At first, I used fold and I had a stack overflow. I read here and there what the issue was so I switched to foldl'. Yet, this version runs in more than 20 seconds compared to only a few milliseconds in Go.\n I'm not at all comparing Haskell and Go, but I'm trying to understand what makes my solution so slow and how to improve it. Note that I have seen versions in O(1), fair enough but I don't want to implement a solution with better time complexity. I'd like to stick with an O(n) solution for now, to understand what I'm doing wrong.\n Thanks for the help.\n    submitted by    /u/teivah  \n [link]   [comments]",

Monads in Clean are therefore just a helpful tool to facilitate sequences of computations. In Haskell, however, monads like IO seem a bit hacky with their lots of magic in the background, where only the compiler developers themselves probably know how they actually work. This magic has always irritated me and distorted the idea of monads.\n This brings to mind the idea of creating a resource like a file completely referentially transparent as a mere program object, and manipulating it, just as you can do with numbers or other simple values, without actually causing anything outside of the programming. You're just describing the transformations. And only when you actually want to perform all these operations in the real world you add “*World” and continue working with an unique object standing for an entity in the real world.\n    submitted by    /u/ThyringerBratwurst  \n [link]   [comments]",

The downside is that we basically need to reimplement everything that already exists in established DB libraries from scratch.

This is the simplest choice, but results in similar-looking boilerplate code. \n Same as above but using the State monad.\n Model a search problem as a tuple of (start value, expanding frontier function, terminating condition), and provide implementations of the 2nd and 3rd items for each algorithm. This model is shown here and looks promising in reducing boilerplate.\n Read a novel academic paper, like Structuring Depth-First Search Algorithms in Haskell or Backtracking, Interleaving, and Terminating Monad Transformers and come up with an implementation. FWIW, it seems like the Data.Graph library implementation is based on the former paper (but for the purposes of the exercise I shouldn't use).\n Logic and Continuation: This option is mentioned in passing in some places but there is exactly zero online literature available as far as any practical examples go. None whatsoever. I don't even know why would I choose this option, other than it potentially reducing boilerplate. The H-99 problems aren't for infinite graphs, and ask for all answers, not the first one, so, fairness/interleaving isn't really a concern.\n  \nA somewhat related question had been asked before, although it focussed on a specific advent of code problem and lacked the research I've laid out above.

I love the idea of doing it in Haskell and also doing it properly™ (i.e. overengineering the hell outta it lol).\n I already have a program (involuntarily written in Java) to store/output the board state and determine whether someone won.\\ What I intend to create is the following: 1. a protocol between the Java program and 2. (see below)\\ this will contain things like \"NEWGAME\", \"TURN xy\", \"RESPONSE zw\", etc. 2. a Haskell program that implements that protocol to actually generate a good next move and send it back to the Java application, which 3. I will modify to be able to talk to my \"engine\"\n So what is your folks' opinion on how to structure the Haskell code / protocol?\\ I came up with this: - CECP-/UCI-like protocol: one move sent at a time, my program would need to store that somehow\\ however, I don't have any idea on how to elegantly do this in Haskell and wonder whether it can even be done idiomatically - get the complete board state as input each time and output the next move / new state; as easy as it gets and seems to fit really well with the functional paradigm BUT extremely inefficient and not what I would do if I was programming it in another language (also apparently not how most protocols work…)\n Dear, epic, most valued, mathematically blessed computer scientists, can you bestow some advice upon me, so I can maybe become worthy of joining your ranks one day?\n Thanks in advance and happy holidays! :)\n    submitted by    /u/TheKiller36_real  \n [link]   [comments]",

Although somewhat long, I show my code below.\n // KeyValueStore.scala trait KeyValueStore[F[_, _]]: def put[K, V](f: F[K, V])(k: K, v: V): F[K, V] def get[K, V](f: F[K, V])(k: K): Option[V] def getOrElse[K, V](f: F[K, V])(k: K, default: V): V = get(f)(k).getOrElse(default) def values[K, V](f: F[K, V]): List[V] object KeyValueStore: given KeyValueStore[Map] with def put[K, V](f: Map[K, V])(k: K, v: V): Map[K, V] = f + (…",

Long story short was: he created the users with their password so he knew their authentication infos and was able to login in order to \"see what they can see\", \"check for missing features directly on their account\", \"test out that some specific features would really work for them\" in production, etc.\n But! I changed the way users are created, mainly because the passwords he created were way too easy to guess (without even having to brute force, litteraly everyone could guess the passwords, that's why he could remember them in the first place).\n So he can't login as other users anymore, and he would like to be able to \"do it again\". I already worked on a platform that allowed user impersonation for administrators out of the box but I can't find anything on the internet regarding this subject on the Play framework and Scala documentations or their communities...\n So my questions for you are: have you ever had to deal with an impersonation feature request using silhouette + play framework + scala and if you haven't, do you have any advice to provide on the subject anyway? =D\n Thanks very much for those who take the time to respond!\n EDIT: added essential politeness to my post\n    submitted by    /u/DespicableHarpoon  \n [link]   [comments]",

I allocated max. 12GB to the VM running IntelliJ\n What I am experiencing?\n When I edit scala files in a small size Scala project (roughly 40 files, scala source code + few files generated from the play framework) using playframework 3 & anorm, basically IntelliJ goes nuts, i.e. the CPU usage goes up, the fans rpm go to the maximum (I run TG Pro) to the point where I cannot type continuously - I keep typing, and the characters don't show up for a few fractions of second, then they all appear at once. Clicking anywhere in the editor or in the user interface has a lag. I am using the default JDK that comes with IntelliJ. Cmd+Tab doesn't respond immediately, or it is frozen for a moment then the selection moves quickly a few more icons to right.\n I tried VS Codium + Metals to edit the same project and it is more responsive but I don't like it as much as IntelliJ.\n I also run a Windows 10 VM in desktop parallels and, believe it or not, I installed the same version of IntelliJ and it is more responsive than the mac version. I think I am going to continue on windows in the short term.\n I am just curious about few things if you don't mind sharing your experience:\n  \ndo you use Intellij on Linux and if yes, what is the performance like, assuming that you don't run it on apple hardware?\n if you run IntelliJ on a newer mac with the apple CPU, what is the performance like?\n any suggestions/recommendations on how to improve the performance of IntelliJ on the mac?\n  \nAnd just a side note, because I read the MBP 2019 16\" intel has some problems handling external monitors, I should mention I do use an external 4K Dell monitor, but I do not experience the problems described in this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlUmnVYPcKM .\n Thank you\n ​\n ​\n    submitted by    /u/0110001001101100  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I observed lately that there is a lot of division in Scala community. There are multiple groups of users, some more vocal than others.\n This is counterproductive as people have different requirements, tastes, styles, and backgrounds.\n In my view, this goes against what Scala stands for, a Scalable language:\n \"A programming language designed to adapt to the evolving needs of its users.\"\n However, not all users have the same requirements. There is no one solution for everyone.\n Is there a way in 2024 to make the Scala community more inclusive and accept that every group has its pros and cons for the technical choices they make?\n Here are some groups I observed, mainly around async handling:\n  \nPeople who try to write everything with IO.\n People who keep using Scala Future.\n People who use plain threads / scala-async / project Loom / direct style.\n  \nWhile you may have a preference for one group, we should all agree that there is nothing wrong with choosing one or another. It's just a matter of personal preference and the overall requirements and trade-offs.\n It's essential to recognise that outside the Scala community, some of these paradigms represent the majority.\n For example, Scala Future behave the same as the Kotlin CompletableFuture, the Java CompletableFuture, the NodeJS Promise.\n What's nice about each group is that people coming from Haskell/familiar with IO monad may be at home in group 1.\n People coming from Java/Kotlin/Javascript will be at home in groups 3 and 2.\n People coming from Python will be at home in group 3.\n So, instead of being consumed by division. Can the community be joined by the diversity and cooperation instead?\n It's a Scalable language where everyone can be at home. We all have to win with Scala being a multi-purpose language as it was intended.\n Much love to each of the groups, have a wonderful day!\n    submitted by    /u/Previous_Pop6815  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "(Not trying to upset anyone. Happy to be proved wrong)\n Scala can be an advanced version of Java. It is more expressive. You can write neat code. All this comes with an acceptable learning curve. Valid choice.\n If you use Scala+Cats, it means you want to do advanced FP. Then why not just use Haskell? Instead of using a tool to turn stones into gold, you can just pick gold...\n And Cats can't make pure gold for you, because there is no linting tool in Scala to enforce the purity. Your teammate can still write functions that have side effects. A mix of pure + impure code is confusing and error-prone.\n    submitted by    /u/shaunyip  \n [link]   [comments]",

I would really like to use org-roam for maintaining my notes in medicine however I find that there to be a few parts of my workflow that are stopping me from just using Emacs and orgmode:\n  \nWhen I go to placement, I often like to just use the computers that are there. These hospital computers as you can imagine are locked pretty securely and so its impractical for me to setup Emacs on these computers or run anything from a USB. I have previously used something web based like notion.so but the experience was far from satisfactory.\n I unfortunately fell into the trap of buying an iPad for medical school and I want to make the most use of it. I will ocassionally bring this to placement and would like to be also take notes on my iPad.\n I do often have to look or reference my notes while on my phone. So quick offline access to my notes synced through syncthing is ideal.\n  \nI am currently considering using obsidian.md which uses markdown files. I can then sync these files with my phone and iPad and use the obsidian apps on either device. On my own computer I am thinking of using Emacs with https://github.com/licht1stein/obsidian.el. On computers at placement I am considering having my org files in a private repo on gitlab or github and then using the built in text editor on thos platforms.\n My question therefore is: is there a better alternative for my workflow/use-case that mainly uses org mode files as opposed to using obsidian?\n EDIT: I am open to also using pandoc to convert org and md files as long as the process can be somewhat automated.\n    submitted by    /u/sabikewl  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have about 17 separate topics in it, each one ranging from 5-6 lines of text to the largest being about a full page by itself. Would you folks be more inclined to have a single file (a la the original TiddlyWiki), or break each topic into its own sub-file?\n I realize that org is going to be capable of jumping around a large file as easily as it can jump between files, at least that's the impression I've gotten.

I am a noob, so please do forgive me if I don't come across as competent with orgmode\n If I run a python script on my .org files which creates a new .org file with all TODOs that meet certain property conditions (i.e. all TODOs with the property 'Category: Work')--will emacs consider these TODOs in the new .org file the same as, or different to, the TODOs that were originally copied?\n So, if I had a TODO in .org file 1, and python copied it to .org file 2, would emacs view these as separate TODOs? Basically, if a dynamic block called all TODOs with the property 'Category: Work', would this TODO appear twice?\n I ask because my specific workflow will likely require me to do something like this, and I am wondering if there is a way to do so without emacs thinking they are different. Might one way of doing this be to assign each TODO a unique identifier (UID) so that when I copy a TODO, the UID is copied too? Would this solve the issue of emacs possibly viewing both items as separate rather than the same?\n Any help is much appreciated.

          "description": "Hello,\n I know this question has been asked over and over again, but after reading many articles on this topic, as well as blog posts, orgmode tutorials, and trying a bit on my own, I'm still not sure orgmode fits my needs. Since the orgmode learning curve comes up a lot, I want to make sure it's worth my time. \n I'm a graduate student in applied mathematics. I'm just starting my master's degree, so I'm looking to set up my workflow for classes, research and personal projects. I'd like to be able to quickly and easily create notes on articles, or textbooks, keeping a journal, organize files into projects, create to-do lists and roadmaps (much like orgmode does perfectly if I've understood what I've read correctly).\n I've never used emacs in my life and I don't come from a computer science background --> I find it very difficult to learn and I have the impression that it will be a long time before I can start using it for real. \n People keep saying that it's worth learning emacs and orgmode nonetheless because of the unlimited customization possibilities. What are your thoughts on this? \n Should I be patient and learn to use emacs and orgmode to set up my workflow, or should I just start using Notion or any other simple organization and note-taking app? \n Note that I don't want a complex setup in the long run, just something minimalist that allows me to concentrate on what's important while having a clear vision of my work.\n    submitted by    /u/Pretty-Habit9628  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hej fellows,\n I am using Org Mode while learning about Guix via the fabulous Dissecting Guix series, employing Code blocks to visualize what it is I am talking about. However, I noticed two things that REALLY bug me out.\n First off, when I load the org file containing said source blocks, it is slow to the point of unusability UNLESS I first start GEISER-CONNECT with an instance of GUIX REPL hooked up. This leads me to believe that it is independent of org mode and has to do with the fact that it searches for the code to which the blocks reference. Nonetheless, input on this is highly appreciated\n Second, when I use TAB (for org-cycle), I am asked for the currently used scheme implementation - despite the fact that both related geiser variables, geiser-active-implementation and geiser-default-implementation only contain guile. When I choose guile, then the source block contents become read-only, and all subsequent editing needs to happen in a separate Org Src buffer. I have no clue why this is the case.\n I have come to the point where I commented out all code blocks to not have to deal with it, which is obviously not acceptable in the long run. Thus, any input is appreciated :)\n Have a good day, fellows!\n EDIT/SOLVED: I found out the source of the problem. At one point I had opened a lot of files related to Guix and then saved the Desktop file. Then, loading the file would load all those other files including all modes related. For some reason I don't quite understand this literally ground emacs to a halt performance-wise.\n    submitted by    /u/olivuser  \n [link]   [comments]",

Originally I was writing in LaTeX, now I write in org mode.\n I've found org mode to be a great tool for writing but I'm pretty new to it. I'm curious how other writers incorporate the task functionality of org mode into the writing process.\n So far, I've kept things separate. So I have my document I'm writing in (say a chapter) and I have a separate outline in a different document that I add my TODO tags to (see image).\n However, with this method, if I make changes to the writing document outline (which happens a lot), I have to update my tasks document. Is there a way to have the TODO tags in my writing document and be able to see those headlines in a separate buffer?\n Or is the another way you use TODO tags to keep track of writing tasks?\n All advice is welcome.\n ETA: I should also say that I use narrow/widen quite a bit, which I can do with a separate tasks file. Would be interested if other methods can similarly narrow in.\n ​\n Separate writing and tasks org files\n    submitted by    /u/encomun  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi all,\n I've been using org-roam for a while now, but I recently started to go a bit deeper with customization and wanted your opinion on my current workflow and possible ways to automate and improve it.\n Basically, I'm trying to use org-roam as an issue tracker with issue, task and time management, similarly to tools like redmine.\n Currently my workflow is as follows:\n  \nI have an issues.org file containing all issues and their state (TODO, STRT, etc.)\n Every time a new issue comes in, I add it to that file and assign an id with `org-id-get-create`\n For that new issue, I also create a new org file specific to that issue to track description, comments, etc. and roam-link the original TODO item to it\n I use org-roam-dailies to then reference the TODO item from issues.org, clock spent time and add tasks as sub items.\n  \nThis is working mostly fine for me, I'm able to build precise monthly reports over the issues I've been working on, however, there's a bit of a \"disconnection\" between dailies and the overall issues file.\n As the issue state is only recorded in issues.org, the agenda never shows the actual state of the issue when I clock-in, as that's only a roam-link to the original issue. Conversely, time tracking only happens at the daily-level and it's never reflected back to the original issue. Also, having tasks as sub-items in the dailies makes it easy to track all tasks by searching for roam back references, but at the same time it creates a lot of duplication because sub tasks are not carried over to the next day for example.\n Here I'm asking for your opinion, because I'm not sure if I'm just using org and roam the \"wrong way\" and I'm not supposed to try to achieve any of this, or if it's a somewhat valid approach and I just need to automate it.\n Thank you all!\n ​\n ​\n    submitted by    /u/zuegg  \n [link]   [comments]",

(I can understand that pandoc makdown conversion should not know to convert :eval no to #| eval: false in the code block but that is secondary).\n I could write a post-text-processing script to handle this but I wonder if there is a more direct way to at least get the language specification to be {python} instead of python or {.python ...}.

In all this time, I am very aware of the fact that I've never used any significant part of its power.\n Around the release of 29.1 with tree-sitter, I chose to wholly re-write my config. I tossed almost everything I had, and pulled things back in piece-wise as I found I needed them. I also took the opportunity to add in a few things I had always heard great enthusiasm for (counsel, ivy, company, swiper to name a few).\n And now... I'm barely using any of the new stuff. Maybe I tried to add too much too quickly? How do others integrate all these truly useful packages into your daily flow?\n    submitted by    /u/rjray  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I would like to contribute my little story. I started using Emacs with the Spacemacs distro (great distro!). I used it for a year and realized that the amount of things to learn is much greater. I learned Vim keybindings, Spacemacs keybindings, modal editing. I also learned the concepts of Emacs, Org Mode, Magit. I realized that some things don't happen so quickly, and I also started to get tired of modal editing and only using the keyboard to perform actions. So, I decided to try vanilla Emacs. I noticed that the contents of the main menu, the button menu and the modeline change according to the position of the pointer, that is, the GUI presents the options in a contextual way. Now I can work effectively using the keyboard and mouse and receiving feedback from the interface regarding commands and key combinations that I always forget. And finally, I gave up on maintaining a configuration file (for now), I learned to use 'customize'. I'm really amazed at what you can do with absolutely no configuration initially! Some advice for beginners (I still am): - Enable CUA mode at the very beginning and migrate to default over time - Learn the concepts (Emacs is a platform!) - Learn how GUI behaves - Learn the key combinations - Learn Org Mode (this is f****** awesome!) - Have a good time!\n    submitted by    /u/Due_Olive_9728  \n [link]   [comments]",

For context, right now I use kitty+tmux and neovim to do most of my note taking and general linux stuff. This includes compiling and writing in LaTeX, script writing, etc.\n For context: I've used emacs in the past and like emacsclient + the other useful tools emacs has to offer out of the box, but it hasn't seemed really sensible to me. DistroTube recently came out with his series on building a sensible config from scratch which I've played with for a bit, but I don't want to fully commit if what I want isn't possible.\n What I am looking for: - ability to act as a terminal - pdf viewing with latex editing side by side - being able to navigate to other workspaces to view pdfs and navigate through them with vim-like binds - extensible (which emacs is) - ability to integrate zettelkasten with a pdf open in another pane/split within the same program\n The general idea I want is it do everything I need to do school/productivity wise within emacs, and nothing else. My current setup works, but I like seeing what else is out there. Let me know how doable this would be.\n Please go easy on me I know there's probably a post like this on here once a week. :')\n    submitted by    /u/paltamunoz  \n [link]   [comments]",

I can jump to the definition of an identifier with xref-find-definitions, and I can see the type of the binding with eldoc or with inlays.\n However, I don't know how to quickly jump to the type of an identifier?\n Rust uses type inference a lot, so the concrete type is often not spelled out in the source code. This means that I don't have the type to use as a starting point. An example:\n rust let foo = build_me_a_foo(); \n Here I would like to be able to jump to the Foo type which build_me_a_foo presumably returns. Today I do this by jumping to the definition of build_me_a_foo and then jump further from the function signature.\n Reading the Emacs manual, I see that I could use C-u M-. to get a prompt for the identifier to jump to. The very large list presented to me does contain what I need, but I need to spell it out based on what eldoc showed me in the mode line.\n Has anybody written the code to look up the type and then feed it directly into C-u M-.?\n    submitted by    /u/mgeisler  \n [link]   [comments]",

For instance, the \"section\" symbol does not create a section in the document.\n It looks like it might have something to do with the input method for TeX, since I can find the symbols as \"translations\" of the keywords when I look there. Please see screenshot.\n I don't encounter this problem when using emacs -Q but I also cannot find a LaTeX related culprit in my config, so I'm at a loss. I experience the behaviour both on my personal Linux computer and on my work Mac.\n Does anyone know what might cause this behaviour and how I can disable it?\n In case you think there might be something in my config and want to help me out by having a look, it's available here.\n EDIT:\n Thank you for the help!

I am a noob, so please do forgive me if I don't come across as competent with orgmode\n If I run a python script on my .org files which creates a new .org file with all TODOs that meet certain property conditions (i.e. all TODOs with the property 'Category: Work')--will emacs consider these TODOs in the new .org file the same as, or different to, the TODOs that were originally copied?\n So, if I had a TODO in .org file 1, and python copied it to .org file 2, would emacs view these as separate TODOs? Basically, if a dynamic block called all TODOs with the property 'Category: Work', would this TODO appear twice?\n I ask because my specific workflow will likely require me to do something like this, and I am wondering if there is a way to do so without emacs thinking they are different. Might one way of doing this be to assign each TODO a unique identifier (UID) so that when I copy a TODO, the UID is copied too? Would this solve the issue of emacs possibly viewing both items as separate rather than the same?\n Any help is much appreciated.

After running C-x C-e after the function (unlike without interactive) I can use M-x double-param but after hitting return it does not wait for input for the parameter. It simply exits with nothing in the echo area. Similarly I cannot use C-u 3 M-x double-param to send it the parameter. However, it still works if I call it with (double-param 3) for example I'll see 6 *#o6, #x6, ?\\C-f) in the echo area.\n What am I doing wrong?

It could perhaps be of interest for some people here. While the Emacs keymap in IntelliJ is actually pretty good, there's enough differences that my Emacs-marinated fingers stumble too often while using IntelliJ. So the plugin is meant to be an extension of the existing Emacs functionality, offering around 40 commands that either modify existing IntelliJ commands to be closer to Emacs, or are pure additions to the IntelliJ commands.\n The plugin only makes these commands available, and you can use whichever ones you find useful, either by adding keybindings one-by-one, or by using the EmacsJ keymap installed by the plugin which is an extension of the Emacs keymap and activates all the commands at once.\n The main features are:\n  \nIncremental search modelled on Emacs' Isearch, with text and regexp search.\n Query-replace as in Emacs with text or regexps, with a very light-weight interface.\n Word commands: transpose, upper-case, lower-case, capitalize, move, delete.\n Rectangle commands: copy, open, clear, paste.\n Whitespace commands: delete space around point, delete empty lines.\n Easy access to clipboard history à la Emacs (kill ring).\n A mark history with ability to pop mark (mark ring), and exchange point and mark.\n Duplicate and comment regions and lines.\n Recenter and relocate caret.\n Zap to character.\n  \n​\n The plugin is of course free and open source.\n https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/23181-emacsj\n https://github.com/strindberg/emacsj\n ​\n    submitted by    /u/Stindberg  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have spent some time customizing and slowly get the hang of how minor/major modes work.\n From what I saw, a major mode defines syntax rules for highlighting (similar to treesitter), on-the-fly error checking with flycheck (similar to LSP) and some setup, such as indentation, etc.\n I understand that TS + LSP are still being actively developed and integrated into Emacs and so I accept that the experience using these tools might not yet match that of established major modes. So I am mostly curious about the future.\n If you were to start coding in a new language in Emacs, what would your setup look like? My thinking is to install the treesitter grammar and the LSP plus minor modes for navigation and editing (e.g., lispy for elisp). Would TS + LSP be used instead of the language major mode or in conjunction with said major mode?\n    submitted by    /u/progyam  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I've started using lsp-bridge after months of fighting with eglot and lsp-mode. Both eglot and lsp-mode are great projects, but they have their quirks, and for me, most of them revolve around how slow and how prone to timing out they are, as well as the massive memory footprint that they cause (I've had both of them spawn clangd processes that end up consuming 20-30GB, and so far lsp-bridge is keeping under 10GB, which is fine). This isn't their fault per se--I'm working on an Unreal Engine project and there is just so much going on all the time, and I can easily believe that parsing JSON is the bottleneck. (I know there's a new-ish project that tries to solve that problem for lsp-mode, and I will definitely try that one day if this experiment with lsp-bridge doesn't work out.)\n So, two questions:\n  \nCan I jump to the (header) file under the cursor, or like lsp-mode, cause that header to become a link to the file?\n I have some functions and classes that seem inaccessible because they're wrapped up in a namespace. This isn't true of everything in a namespace, just a few things. That means I can't jump to classes/functions defined in that namespace, and I also get no completion information back. This wasn't the case with eglot or lsp-mode, so I don't think it's a fundamental limitation of clangd.\n  \nOther than that, so far, I'm pretty impressed. I'll work out some keybindings and wrapper functions to see if I can get the functionality that I'm missing, but for jumping around the code, it's significantly more performant.\n    submitted by    /u/vjgoh  \n [link]   [comments]",

I can't seem to translate what I have in my head into code, which is an unusual and frustrating experience for me.\n What I'd like to do is, when I'm specifically working on a Python project, have my frame set up so that there's a main window with the buffer I'm working on, then to the right is a python REPL, and to the left is a switchable choice between an xrefs list and a directory tree. What I'd like to do is set up the position and sizing of all of these by mouse-dragging them to how I want them, then saving that configuration somehow. Then, crucially, having this configuration and sizing be entered when I visit a python buffer and python-mode launches, and exited back to \"normal\" emacs when I leave python-mode except in a couple of instances.\n Has anyone done something like this? If so, could you share your config?

Since my package directory is versioned, I git restore it, and it does not help, neither does deleting the ELN cache.\n Then I wipe my package directory and install user selected packages one by one, and everything goes fine until I get to helm-org. Install it, and Emacs fails to start. Restore an older copy of package directory (not using git restore) which does not have it, Emacs starts. This package has been installed for ages without any issues before.\n What is this I don't even. Of course for now I fixed my setup with helm-org removed, but how do I get to the bottom of the issue?\n    submitted by    /u/kastauyra  \n [link]   [comments]",

I also opted to use a simple indentation based heuristic for figuring out the context as a default. There's customization options to specify different kinds of context functions depending on the major mode. I've included a simple one for org-mode using headings. \n In the future, I might try to add some tree-sitter support when I get a chance to dig into it.\n I named it window-stool cause it acts like a little stool that you can use to glimpse the contents above what your window can normally see.\n I've been using it for a little while, ironing out kinks along the way so hopefully there aren't too many issues with others using it, but I'd appreciate any feedback for problems that crop up.

Now, when I try to change something, it starts accumulating contradictory information and randomly selecting which one to pick.\n I want to clean up my config file, possibly try literate configuration.

          "description": "Over the past decade, pixel density of displays has increased significantly. On Mac, the \"Retina\" display concept represents a doubling of display density, from ~100 to ~200ppi. On HDPI Retina displays, applications are presented with and work in \"virtual\" pixels of 2x2 physical screen pixels, so that font sizes, icons, etc. remain \"normal\". Then raster, vector and font drawing can make use of all the tiny pixels, for higher quality. My question is, how does Emacs on different systems handle HDPI display?\n My build (emacs-mac) provides some limited support for varying DPI. You can provide parallel high-res versions of image files named like file@2x.ext which are substituted for low-DPI images (without the @2x) automatically. You can similarly embed the text property :data-2x in generated image data. But standalone high density images (like Retina screenshots) must be scaled appropriately (often by 0.5x) to \"light all the pixels\" and not appear overly large.\n What do other ports do to accommodate high-DPI? Nothing? Do you just select very large font sizes? What if you have multiple displays with significantly different pixel density connected? How is image display handled? This seems like an area where some coherent treatment and documentation would be very helpful. But perhaps the underlying OS/display systems vary so greatly in their treatment of HDPI it limits this kind of progress?\n    submitted by    /u/JDRiverRun  \n [link]   [comments]",

As the toolkit scrollbars in Emacs are nevertheless handy, I tinkered a bit to solve both problems: * 1: on-demand-scroll-bar-mode is an alternative to scroll-bar-mode that shows vertical scroll bars only when needed https://github.com/florommel/on-demand-scroll-bar * 2: custom-css allows to load arbitrary CSS snippets to style Emacs's GTK widgets. It comes with a dedicated mode to change the scrollbar visuals, as this requires special care. However, you can also adapt all other GTK widgets inside Emacs (menu bar, tool bar, context menus). The package requires a C module to be built and loaded and works only with GTK builds of Emacs. https://github.com/florommel/custom-css\n Both packages are experimental. Of course, they can be used independently from each other.\n    submitted by    /u/florommel  \n [link]   [comments]",

Either because I managed to configure something and someone needed help (like typescript on a React environment) or I needed help doing something and I was \"afraid\" of sharing it.\n Unfortunately my dotfile (yes, it was a ~/.emacs file) was ugly, old, slow and full of personal stuff.\n I managed to make it faster (0.6 seconds loadtime with ~95 packages on Linux), somewhat organized and (I hope) free of personal stuff.\n This config focuses on having the SAME (or close) user experience on both TUI and GUI. \n Nowadays you can do things on tmux, for example, and you want to use Emacs as a sole editor with `emacs -nw` (the same fashion Neovim users do), others times you may want Emacs also as your terminal emulator and project organizer, you may want to start several instances of Emacs for gnus, ERC or other stuff, on either TUI or GUI. This config aims this situations, so nothing should be missing from GUI to TUI. You can even start it as a daemon and use at the same time on terminal and GUI without breaking anything.\n On this screenshot we have TUI (left) and GUI (right):\n https://preview.redd.it/esot9k1zw89c1.png?width=2880&format=png&auto=webp&s=c338016527f3c76f235c6e848d6db63759f5202f\n It is made in a single file, using as much of default Emacs as possible, so you can fork it, customize or get inspired. It is not, by any means an \"Emacs Distro\".\n I'd love some nice feedbacks (preferably on Github issues so we can track and reuse issues).\n Github: https://github.com/LionyxML/lemacs\n Install instructions on Readme.org\n ​\n    submitted by    /u/LionyxML  \n [link]   [comments]",

I understand they are different, but I'm not getting why the one is able to be displayed and the other is not.\n I've read every article I could find on this sub and google about Emojis in Emacs on Windows, but most articles are either 2+ year old, or have some broken links and succeeded to fix this issue.\n I'm running native Emacs on Windows, I'm not using WSL. I'm using Emacs 28.2.\n I have installed all-the-icons. I also have installed \"Noto Color Emoji\" and put this in my ~/.emacs:\n (set-fontset-font t 'symbol \"Noto Color Emoji\")\n And evaluated. I've also tried with \"native\" windows emoji font: Segoe UI Emoji, but same story.\n I'm getting the emoji in the buffer, but it's invisible. If I copy it from, say, emojipedia and CTRL + y in a buffer, the cursor moves as if something was inserted, but nothing is shown as if I inserted a SPC.\n However if I CTRL+a CTRL+k and then paste it in, say, my browser, I get all the emojis I've inserted in the buffer.\n My question is - Has the Windows API changed(that is the reason, allegedly, why it didn't work in the past as I've read about this issue on this sub) or is there some other way to display emojis in Emacs buffer on Windows 10 that bypasses this API problem or whichever other problem there is.\n On my Linux machine everything works fine, however, unfortunately, sometimes I'm forced to use Windows and thus want to make it work here as well.\n    submitted by    /u/aqua_cap  \n [link]   [comments]",

To support this, I’ve developed a customized terminal experience on kitty. Basically, if I open a new tab, it will clone my current environment, including the container/remote, current directory, and current bashrc. And it also color-codes tabs based on the type of environment I’m in. \n I’m curious if it would be possible/interesting/desirable to recreate this setup in emacs, with the ultimate goal of using emacs as a customized ide + terminal emulator. \n Does anyone have thoughts on this? The first issue that I see is that so far, I haven’t found a tab bar for emacs that supports customizing the colors of the tabs. I’m sure this is possible, but I’m too new to emacs to know how difficult it would be (I have experience coding in multiple lisp dialects, so needing to code in order to customize is not a drawback). Thanks.\n (EDIT: I guess this is partly a question about customizing emacs and partly a question about using emacs as my primary terminal emulator.)\n    submitted by    /u/mister_drgn  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Two days ago I wrote a small experiment that lets me include Lisp as a template placeholders. It looks something like this:\n 1 + 2 = {{ 3 }} 1 + 2 = {{ (+ 1 2) }} 1 + 2 = {{! escaped }} \n I used Mustache-like syntax, to basically just delimit Lisp region from the rest of the text. However, due to Lisp paranthesized syntax it is possible to simplify it. I have now re-written it so it just needs one marker to mark which expression is to be evaluated as Lisp:\n 1 + 2 = %%3 1 + 2 = %%(+ 1 2) 1 + 2 = %%!escaped \n Due to Emacs being a text processing toolkit and a Lisp repl/environment, that basically let us use Emacs Lisp as a template language in text files. The intended use is file and code generators.\n The simplified syntax turnes out to be slightly harder to process than the one with start and end delimiters, however I think it might be worth, so here is an experiment to test the idea.\n Download and details about the usage details are in online repo.\n I appreciate critique and discussion, especially if you find a bug or some fundamental problem.\n    submitted by    /u/arthurno1  \n [link]   [comments]",

So far I'm largely filling it with ideas I've been turning over in my mind for a while rather than the product of new reading. I've come to the conclusion that these ideas should be sat on for a while before they turn into permanent notes and so a zettelkasten would be unsuitable for learning a new field or subfield, which would be better served by a sort of lab manual or similar (not being an academic, I don't particularly need to preserve citations). Like an accounting system that uses a memorandum sheet, a journal, and then a ledger, with the zettelkasten being analogous to the last.\nI got into this from Scheper's book, but I'm not a purist and I found his approach a little too dogmatic. But what I don't recall from his book or Luhmann's zettelkasten is recording the date each card was written. I don't know if that information is useful, but I've been including it on each card.",

(You can have a badly translated version of my last article here)\nI am building an inventory of training stimuli for that. I am doing something similar like a factor analysis. For many years, for example, my aerobic endurance (roughly, what you normally associate with endurance if you are not into sports science) training was distributed over many different other training sessions that you'd normally not associate with aerobic endurance. Like that I could skip long sessions of running, biking etc. and use that freed up time and energy for other training while still having a solid aerobic base (for recovery between bouts of intensity and between exercise sessions).\nI thought that I'd create something similar for knowledge work. Examples are items like reading physical books, attributes like screen time (to highlight a benefit of physical books over ebooks) or requirements like daily empty time slots (like my dog walks in which I do nothing, but just listen to the sound of the world).\nSo, what should be considered?\nLive long and prosper\nSascha",

But I don't know if this is good practice. The other options I could use are:\nuse two tags: \"#good #technician\".\nuse only the core of the idea: \"#technician\".\nWhat do you recommend me to do?\nBecause in this note, I just want to refer to good technicians (I don't want to talk about technicians in general).

But I could be wrong :^)\n# 202401060957 Turning a good technician into a mediocre boss destroys human capital\n#good-technician #mediocre-boss #human-capital\n\nIn companies (public or private), one way to progress economically is to\nacquire responsibility for the work of others: to move from being a technician\nto being a boss.\n\nHowever, the skills that define a good technician are different from those of\na good boss.\n\nThis causes many good technicians (motivated by economic incentives) to become\nmediocre bosses: they do not have the skills needed to be good bosses.\n\nFor the company, this situation destroys human capital value: we have turned\na good technician into a mediocre boss.",

I'm not seeing any English translations at present. I suspect it has material on using card indexes as databases and may be focused on business use, but may also have some connections to note taking practices of the time. I've also found several references to Porstmann's work and that of George Christoph Lichtenberg which makes me even more curious about the potential note taking connections.\nPorstmann, Walter.

But that would also raise a conundrum. I'm into photography, and I'm into art history, so those two topics could be in one slip box. But then I'm also into history in general, so should art history be a part of the box with history or photography? Again, this is just an example, not an actual dilemma.\nI'm going through Ahrens' book but I don't know if it will touch on this particular topic. He does mention that Luhmann wrote on all sorts of subjects, which seems to indiciate he had a single slip box system for everything.\nHas anyone here dealt with this?",

          "description": "In the documentary Kevin Hart & Chris Rock: Headliners Only (Netflix, 2023) while preparing for a portion of their tour, Kevin Hart admires a portion of Chris Rock's stand up comedy method and calls it \"a science\". Chris Rock writes headlines for his jokes on slips of paper and then arranges them on either tables or small bulletin boards to outline his set list for presenting jokes for his performances.\n\n\nIf there are interesting contemporaneous news items which appear, he'll include a newspaper or other material to represent the related joke for inclusion into his set. This makes a fascinating means of outlining his material and seems to fall within the realm of my search for zettelkasten output processes. Even if Rock doesn't use index cards to write or store his jokes like comedians in the past have, he's using a slip-based method for outlining and arranging them as part of his output process.\n\nKevin Hart: Chris, I'm so... I'm so, uh blown away by what I'm discovering that is your process.\nChris Rock: My process.\nKevin Hart: This all your shit?\n\n\nChris Rock: Well, this here would be, uh, bullet points for tonight. Every card represents a joke or a reference that I choose. I don't wanna forget. You know what I mean? Like, you can remember all your jokes, but some nights, I'm like, 'ehhh, I'm not gonna close with this one. I'm gonna close with that one'.\nKevin Hart: You have it down to a science where you can bullet point the time.\nChris Rock: You can. And by the way, sometimes, something happens in the news.\nKevin Hart: You got jokes on the bench.\nChris Rock: I have jokes on the bench.\n\nKevin Hart: I'm going to tell you I'm not only impressed by that, but I'm disappointed in myself. Because, uh, whatever I got, got to to fly.\n(Original post can be found at: https://boffosocko.com/2023/12/27/chris-rocks-zettelkasten-output-process/)",

          "description": "We are in the company of friends.\nThe time between the solstice and the new year is a time for introspection, reflection, and gratitude. It's a time to look back on the year that has passed and think about what we have learned and achieved. And more importantly, it's a time to look forward to the new year and set intentions for ourselves.\nI am grateful for the inspiration I receive from your posts and comments and for seeing what you are studying. We can brainstorm, debate, and explore new ideas together. By doing so, we can push the boundaries of our thinking and gain a deeper understanding of the world around us.\nA forum post can be the starting point for a stream of ideas.\nThank you, everyone.

          "description": "i have been training for a job in the medical field (maybe a bit of an understatement in regards to the cost and mental toil, but saying i'm in med school has its implications because i'm really not.) and about two-and-a-bit months ago, i decided to start a zettelkasten. i learned all about it and wrote notes about the underlying philosophy in the zettelkasten itself, and things started off fantastic! MOCs and hub notes feel like a dream for my personal organization. higher-order learning seemed extremely necessary. disregarding the idea of separate disciplines in lieu of an understanding rooted in existing knowledge seemed very helpful.\nnow it's been a couple months and my zettelkasten contains over 100 zettels; i'd say about 20 regarding personal knowledge management and then about 80 medical notes. that is the problem, though. i look at other notemakers' obsidian graphs and they're one big ideaverse of notes radiating from the center. my notes, conversely, are separated into blobs by discipline or level of abstraction from reality. (e.g. anatomy [tangible] vs. study concepts [intangible]) in essence, i want to keep watching my zettelkasten grow--it is helping me retain information--but i'm a bit scared that i'm not implementing higher-order learning correctly.\nthis is making me unsure whether a traditional, luhmann-esque zettelkasten is the best idea for medical study. what do you think? does anyone else have trouble connecting tangible, business-related zettels to more abstract zettels?",
