          "description": "Data.Vector.Unboxed essentially gives a Structure of Arrays representation - Vector (a,b) can be stored as (Vector a, Vector b). \n This has some minor issues - deriving doesn't really work, writing the typeclass by hand is really annoying, GHC cannot optimize away dead reads if you only use one field - but overall it's a reasonably nice and composable abstraction.\n I'm currently playing with some code which accepts messages and must store them efficiently before they get batch-executed. To make this extensible I'd like some freer monads, more extensible effects style interface, composing the command enum like Either Op1 Op2.\n But my usecase could be seen as a mildly wonky Op-Based CRDT which means the operations commute and order doesn't matter. It would be really nice if internally I could store everything as (MVector Op1, MVector Op2)behind the scenes.\n This lead me to a number of questions:\n  \nIs there an array-of-sums representation that stores Vector (Either Op1 Op2) as (Vector Op1, Vector Op2)?\n Is there a better way to derive unboxed vector boilerplate? I have seen https://hackage.haskell.org/package/vector-th-unbox-0.2.2/docs/Data-Vector-Unboxed-Deriving.html before but it feels like DerivingVia should be able to handle it if the monad was constrained to be representational\n Are there interface ideas to manipulate unboxed vectors structurally? Say, lift projection functions like Vector (a,b) -> Vector a? In my case also things like pop one Op1 value, or take all Op2 values\n Is there an approach to structurally manipulate types in Haskell? Most code in Haskell only folds over the generic representation but e.g. StrictCheck has some tooling to add a functor at each level of a type, typescript has a bunch of tools for this like\n  \n \ntype ExtractPII<Type> = { [Property in keyof Type]: Type[Property] extends { pii: true } ? true : false; }; \n If people have ideas to any of these points I'd really like to hear about them!\n    submitted by    /u/Tarmen  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have designed a C pseudo code for the extraction function, and this what I have written so far for the extraction function in Haskell-\n In C :\n extractBits (unsigned int x, int t, int n) mask = ((1<<n)-1)<<t; unsigned int extractedBits = x & mask;\n In Haskell :\n extractBits :: Word 128 -> Integer -> Integer -> Word128 extractBits x t n = x .&.

(shiftL 1 n-1)) t\n Not quite sure however I think the function above does not seem to be logically the same as my implementation? They are giving different results for some values. Does it have something to do with how overflow is handled by each if these functions? \n Additionally, I am having trouble thinking about the reverse of this function and how it can be implemented.

Additionally, the target directory of the code generated by Copilot can now be customized. Release 3.6 also includes a battery of unit tests for the library copilot-core. This release introduces other fixes in the code and in the documentation, and deprecates definitions that have been superseded or that were largely unused.\n Current emphasis is on facilitating the use with other systems, and improving the codebase in terms of stability and test coverage.

Imagine something like initializing user-scoped sqlite file in the filesystem where the haskell web server binary is running (so no external \"job runner\" service) - The actions should run in separate thread (async?) - For any user, there should be at most 1 parallel copy of that action running at any given time (i.e. if user triggers 2nd copy of that action while the first is still running, the 2nd action should be skipped)\n My idea about solution so far includes: - some data structure (?) for managing bunch of locks, addressed by integers (user ids) - ensure locks are released both when the async action fails or succeeds\n Here's a dirty prototype (most likely not bug free) demonstrating what I'd like to achieve https://gist.github.com/jhrcek/5123bc0ad42522dff837be5580e9766e\n Is anyone aware of some libraries that would make this kind of thing possible?\n    submitted by    /u/JackSchpeck  \n [link]   [comments]",

It states in this capter (http://learnyouahaskell.com/for-a-few-monads-more) that there are some functions that do the same as the functions on Functors. But specifically written for Monads (e.g. liftM and fmap; ap and <*>).\n  \nWhich ones are you using?\n Is there a rule of thumb?\n Perhaps something like \"always liftM when the value is an instance of Monad and only fmap when it is an instance of Applicative and not of Monad?\"\n  \n​\n 2) There is a small task to do this tightrope walker example (http://learnyouahaskell.com/a-fistful-of-monads) with the Either type instead of the Maybe type.Thats what I did here and wondered if I could use the state Monad in combination with the Either Monad to clean up the code by avoiding all these ```first <- landLeft start second <- landLeft first etc..```\n  \nIs this possible?

I have been considering writing several applications in haskell that are somewhat performance dependent and as previously mentioned, I would rather have them be written in haskell than not if the performance is not strongly affected by this.\n Does haskell have good graphics libraries? If so, what is the performance disadvantage it has compared to languages like C/C++? I am interested in working with something similar to Inigo Quilez work.\n What is the current status of AI research in haskell? From my very simple searching, I noticed that it's not a popular programming language in the field of AI and I am honestly confused about why that is. Perhaps someone more knowledgable about this can explain to me why a language closer to mathematics is somehow further away from the mathematical research environment.\n  \nOther than that, I would like to thank you all for keeping this subreddit alive for newcomers like me to explore & learn from!\n    submitted by    /u/Target_Organic  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "For the last two-three days, I have been trying to wrap my head around functional reactive programming. I came across threepenny-gui while I have been trying to understand the concept.\n My understanding is that the difference between reactive programming as opposed to event-driven programming is that in reactive programming, one describes the behavior of the UI as a time varying function rather than how it behaves when certain events are triggerred. For example, Spreadsheet allow for reactive programming since we can say that a certain cell is related to some other cell in terms of a certain formula -- instead of having to say [When those cells update, change this cell according to this formula]. \n When I look at the different examples included with threepenny-gui, I get the impression that they have not designed their programs reactively. For instance, if you see Mouse.hs, you see that they are saying\n  on UI.mousemove wrap $ \\xy -> element out # set text (\"Coordinates: \" ++ show xy) on UI.keydown wrap $ \\c -> element out # set text (\"Keycode: \" ++ show c) \n which binds the \\c -> element out # set text ... handler to the events. This looks like event driven programming to me, instead of reactive programming. In a reactive program, one would just say that certain fields are bound to the coordinates of the mouse.\n I have also looked at Reactive.Threepenny and I think I understand the combinators but I do not understand how to use them to actually write reactive code.\n Is my understanding correct?\n If you have suggestions on how to phrase my code as reactively as possible in threpenny-gui, that would be welcome.

          "description": "We are trying to get a working Haskell dev environment on MacOS M1, and are having various problems with the different approaches we have taken.\n Our project currently uses an older nixpkgs that comes with ghc[js]-8.6.5, but this unsurprisingly does not work and is likely a wontfix.\n The obvious choice was upgrading nixpkgs to a new version. However it seems like entering a nix-shell with ghc does not work, even for a very simple project. It complains about a broken compiler-rt-libc, and allowing for broken packages leads to a failing build of compiler-rt-libc.\n Surprisingly nix-build does work for ghc, however our project is too large for nix-build to be practical for development, as build times are on the order of an hour.\n Another problem with newer nixpkgs is that ghcjs doesn't work at all, again even on simple projects. It errors out with a complaint about the happy test suite failing.\n Yet one more problem is that while newer ghcjs on non-M1 MacOS does work, it is massively slower, taking on the order of a day to build our project, occasionally requiring restarts due to running out of file handles.\n There are also problems with running newer ghcjs versions on Ubuntu, as our project deterministically fails with an Data.Binary.Get.runGet at position 0: not enough bytes error.\n Due to the above we have been instead focusing on getting ghc-8.6.5 working on MacOS M1 without nix via Rosetta.\n However this has been very difficult due to C dependencies. We have uninstalled and reinstalled the necessary brew libraries in x86 arch mode, but cabal does not seem to be able to find them either way.\n So what I was more or less wondering was what other people have gotten working on MacOS M1, in case there is anything we can learn from that to get our project building on it.\n    submitted by    /u/Tysonzero  \n [link]   [comments]",

Jordan provides abstract and inspectable JSON parsing and serialization, using the Applicative (for parsing) and Divisible (for serializing) typeclasses.\n Jordan has you define ToJSON and FromJSON classes in terms of instructions, such as \"serialize a string\" or \"parse an object with these fields\". These instructions are then evaluated by various interpreters, which actually do the work of parsing or serializing. This has a few benefits:\n  \nIntermediate structures are entirely avoided: there is no Map.Map Text JSONValue anywhere in the library, and JSON fields are directly parsed using permutation parsers. This also means that we can always serialize a JSON directly to a bytestring, avoiding the need for anything like toEncoding from Aeson\n Since JSON interaction is kept abstract, you can generate documentation for parsers and serializers, directly from their definitions. This is provided in jordan-openapi.\n This library provides a fun excuse to use contravariant functors, so you can feel like a super small functional programmer\n  \nThe github page for this project is located here.

But having implemented the core transport protocol in dart, I do have some doubts...\n Having come through all the options, I've read that people use Swift across all platforms (iOS/Android/Mac/Windows) for applications logic, as Swift is an LLVM compiler, so it produces very fast binaries that run on Android without JVM.\n So, I am now thinking, wait a second - Haskell GHC is also an LLVM compiler. A short google search shows that people do compile Haskell code to both iOS and Android. And we already have most of the protocol logic implemented in Haskell - people use our SimpleX chat via terminal...\n While this all seems doable, the compiler configuration and low level bindings are a bit over my head - I am an application developer, so lots to learn here. Would anybody here who has the experience with Haskell on iOS / Android be interested to join the project (terms TBD) to at least help us set it all up, if not get involved longer term?\n    submitted by    /u/epoberezkin  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Errata: This is a repost with a different title of a post I just deleted, since the old title \"Is Haskell a better Python?\" created substantial confusion, and Reddit does not allow the changing of post titles. The original post-thread can be found here: https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/qbvfsh/beginning_programmer_here_is_haskell_a_better/\n ​\n I'm just a noob with a copy of \"Haskell From The Very Beginning\", but I'd like to ask:\n ​\n Is Haskell a better Python? As in, Python is a deliberate attempt to make a very accessible programming language, but guess what? The textbook I just bought has 127 functional pages (albeit extremely concise ones).\n ​\n I'm wondering if Haskell might be a better Python for people beginning to code; i.e, people complain about Monads this,\n https://preview.redd.it/kqvdmwedanu71.png?width=892&format=png&auto=webp&s=4165714f28e616ac30685a8095ca34fcb68427c1\n that, but a lot of it comes down to people starting with imperative paradigms.\n ​\n The benefits, likewise, are substantial. Haskell, in comparison in other programming languages, is very hard to make bad code in (because it simply won't compile). For non-programmers coming into programming, Haskell is a way to learn to code but also to produce a relatively high-quality of code, whereas Python etc might be easier to learn, but it's far easier to produce spaghetti code in other languages. Moreover, selling Haskell as \"a better Python\" to non-programmers also helps enlarge the Haskell community, leading to better library, compiler, and other forms of support, while making it so that many future programmers start from a functional paradigm instead of an imperative paradigm.\n ​\n Edit: I did contact Haskell Foundation about this subject, but I'd like to message them permission to post e-mail contents first, and I'd rather finish a few Haskell textbooks beforehand so I don't feel like a poser before I do so.\n    submitted by    /u/Instrume  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I lately grokked that Haskell just reveals the very nature of imperative program, or sequential code, that a thread of execution (by machine, as well as reasoning by human), is essentially single item (thus monadic) data dependencies chained together.\n IO has a phantom (yet magical) RealWorld item in the chain (though only at type level, not present at value level), you can imagine every IO step receives a new version of the RealWorld from the previous step. While ST has an even more general abstraction of it.\n Human brains seem to take single threaded reasoning for granted, so procedural code would appear more \"natural\" to humans. But data dependency is inherently \"multi-threaded\", thus how referential transparency is more \"natural\" to the physical nature.\n We human perceive a single RealWorld despite multiple versions of it along the temporal axis. But thinking the data dependency way, no such single RealWorld actually exists at all, just as in Haskell (at value level).\n Then we have real difficulties in reasoning about effects (mutation done to the \"world\") applied, if not sequentially organized. How \"unnatural\" we human are. Anyhow, imperative programs reflect this bug/feature of our cognitive workings, including monadic Haskell.\n    submitted by    /u/complyue  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Lists in Haskell are often used as persistent generators rather than data structures. This usually works very well, but can result in massive space leaks. Consider the contrived example below:\n main = print leak list = enumFrom <$> [0..] bigNumber = 10000000 leak = map (\\n -> list !! n !! bigNumber) [1..100] \n I reworked this example to avoid space leaks by defining a Gen typeclass which supports generators of infinite lists:\n {-# LANGUAGE FunctionalDependencies #-} module Main where main = print noleak genlist = EnumFrom <$> [0..] noleak = map(\\n -> gens !! n `idx` bigNumber) [1..100] bigNumber = 10000000 -- For potentially terminating generators, val :: a -> Maybe b and next :: a -> Maybe a class Gen a b | a -> b where val :: a -> b next :: a -> a newtype EnumFrom = EnumFrom {value :: Int} instance Gen EnumFrom Int where val = value next = EnumFrom . (+1) . value idx :: Gen a b => a -> Int -> b idx a n = val $ iterate next a !! n \n Although this approach works, simply being able to use a list would be far more convenient.\n My question: is there a way to make lists not leak space, or is there at least a solid library for non-memoizing iterators and generators?\n Edit: Thank you for the answers given so far!

I had written the entire thing (still rather small here) using the normal string (or [Char]) type. Though after reading up on how I could make a strip function I found out using Text is apparently a lot better overall and already has a strip function built-in (tho no replace from to). So I ported my program to using Text and noticed that some functionality just flies out the window which I did use quite a lot (Pattern matching for example), or is rather cumbersome to use (Concatenation, especially to normal strings; comparing with normal hard coded strings (less so than concat))\n So how should I replace such things when using Text? Constantly writing T. (as the package says one should) isn't really all that nice either, though I mind that less. I'm mostly missing the pattern-matching/recursion stuff and being able to easily compare/concat a Text to a hardcoded string. The constant T.append (T.pack \"my string\") myText just feels really verbose and unwieldly compared to \"my string\" ++ myText... The program does a lot of string (or well... text) manipulation, using pattern matching and concatenation quite a lot\n I'm currently on ghc 9.0.1\n    submitted by    /u/nevatalysa  \n [link]   [comments]",

I noticed in the library documentation that (at least according to package naming scheme), this library also seems to have an encoding of type families in Java. This seems to be backed up by the fact that one of the linked papers in the readme of the project also uses type families. \n This is more surprising to me. I know Java generics are Turing complete, but as far as I know, there are no academic results that would lead me to believe that type families can be emulated in Java (as I remember, the paper essentially uses an encoding of grammars as a kind of fluent interface in the proof of Turing completeness).\n Does anyone know anything about this seeming emulation of type families in Java?

          "description": "I have been working with Scala (Functional) and Clojure for the last ~ 4 years but I still can't give a proper brief answer whenever someone asks me \"Hey, what is FP and why should I use it?\" \n I generally start with concepts like immutability, local reasoning, referential transparency, functions as first class citizens, currying etc. But I soon find myself going all over the place. For example, I find myself giving unconvincing arguments when someone asks me \"what practical benefit does referential transparency actually provide to the developer?\"\n There are arguments like imperative programming depends on the order of execution of statements, while FP is declarative. But FP also depends on the order of execution (you insert into database and then read, you can't do vice-versa). Sure, you can say that \"ordering\" that we are talking about here is in the context of mutating global state. There isn't any global state in FP. But at the core of it ordering does matter right?\n Then there is the argument that immutability allows use of different cores in parallel. But I have never seen this happening in any business application, i.e, immutability used to parallelize processing. Sure, making a value immutable makes it thread safe (since no one can change it). But most real life scenarios require mutability. So we model them as Atomic, Ref etc and make them thread safe. But these things exist in imperative languages as well. So, what exactly is the connection between immutability and parallel processing & thread safety.?\n Then we have the lazy evaluation of IO which provides referential transparency. I have used IO and I love it. But I can't seem to find practical/objective points as to what benefits it provides. So when I say that all my DB operations and external API calls are an IO, I again find myself giving unconvincing answers about their benefits.\n    submitted by    /u/reflections_deams  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I've recently reached an initial milestone in the development of SLinC (Scala Link to C), a library in the vein of Java Native Access and Java Native Runtime. I'm designing SLinC to use cats' `Free` monad for a native effect type called NativeIO, and it's powered by Scala 3's macros and Java 17's foreign incubator.\n An example usage of SLinC is binding to stdlib.h's div method:\n C representation\n struct div_t { int quot; int rem; }; div_t div(int numerator, int denominator); \n Scala 3 binding and usage\n //scala representation of div_t struct type div_t = Struct { val quot: int val rem: int } //method binding for c stdlib's div val div = NativeIO[(Int, Int) => div_t](\"div\") //usage of our binding //Struct returns require native memory allocation, so an allocation scope is needed Native.scope( for result <- div(5,2) quot = result.quot.get rem = result.rem.get yield println(s\"quotient: $quot, remainder: $rem\") ) //natively allocated data is freed after this point .foldMap(NativeIO.impureCompiler) //compiles and runs the native kernel we just defined, prints \"quotient: 2, remainder: 1\" \n The library is still in development, so it's not as fully featured as JNA or JNR, but I'm hoping to improve it in the coming month. It's also very promising performance-wise: despite me not putting much of any effort into optimization, it's already rivaling JNR in performance, and resoundingly beats JNA.\n    submitted by    /u/markehammons  \n [link]   [comments]",

Alternatively, what's the best approach in tackling this problem with Scala?\n ​\n Disclaimer: I don't have a CS or IT background and have very little experience with pure Scala, I mostly use Spark and Python daily, but I wanted to start filling my skills gaps within the data engineering realm for a long-term goal. I think I know the difference between SAX and DOM parsing, so I was looking for something to implement the former (amirite? :D)\n ​\n Disclaimer 2: this question stems from an interview assignment that required something like this plus other features (streaming solution, JSON output), but after spending too much time just on learning the different parsing approaches I told them I wouldn't proceed: even though it's something easy for the average programmer, it clearly shows my huge gaps in knowledge and programming skills.

Is the thread handing the operation off to the os and saying \"tell me when it's done\"? If so, how does the os not get jammed up in the same way as our blocking/5-thread app?

          "description": "Hi ! \n I've started learning and practicing Scala less than a year ago for my current job, and so far I love it. I learned following the Coursera course from the wonderful Martin Odersky, but I quickly realised that my company was still in the middle of its transition from Java to Scala, with most of our code base looking more like scalaified Java than pure FP Scala like I learned at the beginning.\n I like functional programming, I've liked it from the first moment I learned common Lisp even thou the language felt antiquated, and, well, I wouldn't say I cried, but I was somewhat moved by the....purety ? Mathematicality ? of scala ( don't judge, IK my sense of esthetic is somewhat weird ). \n Things seem to be somewhat moving in this direction at work, and I wanted to accompany this, and satisfy my own curiosity, by learning the move fp-extremist stuff I could find in Scala. \n I could easily find resources on cats and the rest of the typelevel ecosystem, but then I discovered ZIO and that became my latest obsession. I like the project, I like how ZIO code looks and what the whole obsessive typing of everything thingy brings to me as a Dev.\n And then I tried to learn Zio 2.0 ( because why start with the old one when the next one is almost there ? ) but I have a hard time finding learning resources.\n Which bring me to my question ( thanks for reading my life story if you did ) : is the Zionomicon, and Zio in general, worth the time and money I would invest ?\n \n TLDR : weirdo ranting on his new fp zealotry wants to know if paying 50+ bucks for the Zionomicon is worth it\n    submitted by    /u/WiIzaaa  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have good scripting knowledge in a few high-level languages (PowerShell mainly, plus Python and general Bash/awk scripting), and I'd like to break into a more rigorous programming paradigm. Another potential plus is that my company product is written in Java. I don't implement any code, but I do handle its technical implementation and design augmentations for customers. I may find an opportunity to leverage Scala in the JVM for some side projects to help me practice. \n At any rate, my motivation for learning Scala is that it seems well-aligned with my goals and circumstances for entering a more programmatic world.\n  \nBooks\n After looking around, I've picked out 3 books:\n  \nProgramming in Scala Fifth Edition\n \nHands-on Scala Programming: Learn Scala in a Practical, Project-Based Way \n \nProgramming Scala: Scalability = Functional Programming + Objects\n \n I saw a lot of good things about Programming in Scala Fourth Edition, and being that it's written by Martin Odersky, it seems like a solid choice. However, the Fifth Edition claims to have been overhauled for Scala 3, and it's too new for me to find any reviews on how this overhauled edition has turned out.\n Hands-on Scala Programming has good reviews and seems like it might be oriented toward a beginner specifically with its \"project-based\" approach. However being published in 2020, I'd expect it to have been written for Scala 2. I figured if I am jumping into Scala, I should go for a Scala 3 book.\n The book by Dean Wampler seems like a solid book, but I can't find much info on it in terms of reviews.\n Does anyone have experience with any of these books and could provide their 2 cents on it?\n Thank you!\n    submitted by    /u/OPconfused  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "This is a post introducing the new changes of Iron v1.1.2.\n What is Iron ?\n Iron is a type constraints (or type refinement) library for Scala 3. It uses Dotty's inline and opaque types to evaluate constraints at compile-time.\n Here is a simple example: ```scala def log(x: Double > 0d): Refined[Double] = x.map(Math.log)\n log(-1d) //Compile-time error ```\n New features of 1.1.2\n Mathematics\n This release make Iron closer to mathematics by providing two features: - A new A / B alias which has the same meaning than x € A / B(x) in mathematics. The old A ==> B alias is kept but deprecated for retrocompatibility reasons.\n  \nA new algebraic system allowing the user to write their constraint like a mathematical equation: ```scala\n  \ndef acos(x: Double / (-1d <= ?? <= 1d)): Refined[Double] = x.map(Math.acos) acos(1d) //Right(0) acos(1.5) //Error ```\n Check this page for further information.\n Compile-time evaluation support for composed constraints\n Before 1.1.2, constraints like And, Or, Not etc... Weren't evaluable at compile-time. They were evaluated at runtime only. This update now allows you evaluate complex/composed constraints at compile-time: scala def acos(x: Double / (Greater[-1d] && Less[1d])): Refined[Double] = x.map(Math.acos) acos(1.2) //Compile-time error \n Note: Compile-time evaluation is also supported by the new algebra system.\n Links\n  \nGithub\n Release\n An interactive example on Scastie\n  \nFeel free to ask here if you have a question or a review.\n    submitted by    /u/Il_totore  \n [link]   [comments]",

Basically, I need this test to pass:\n scala val testValue: Seq[Byte] = ??? assert(method(testValue))(approximatelyEquals(Coordinate(azi1, ele1))) //values from spec catalog correlating byte sequences to expected Coordinate values \n The signature of approximatelyEquals is\n scala def approximatelyEquals[A: Numeric](reference: A, tolerance: A): Assertion[A] \n I am unsure of how to make this work with the Coordinate class. I need an instance of Numeric for Coordinate, but it doesn't make much sense, since for example it's not possible to order points on a globe.\n Basically what I need is to make sure that the elevation and azimuth values are close to the azimuth and elevation values that are expected.

I'm interested in building an Scala 3 extensible app, whose behavior could be extended, customized via plugins. Bonus points if those plugins could be loaded/unloaded on runtime and their clients be notified accordingly.\n Possible solutions I've thinking about so far:\n  \nOverriding DefaultPluginManager from https://pf4j.org/ so the class can be aware of sbt generated classes (may not work with bloop/metals generated random name directories). But have trouble with Akka classloader, so I 'm not sure if it'll ever would work.\n Use https://github.com/moditect/layrry which is based on Java Modules. Not tried yet. Sbt does not recognize module-info.java which is essential for it to work. Possible solution is implement an Sbt Plugin. But, I don't know if at the end this would work in development mode which is important.\n Mess with an OSGI runtime and spend 3 months figuring out how to make it work with Scala ecosystem.\n Implement the application around https://github.com/softwaremill/macwire and hope the wiredInModule feature (which support dynamic loading) would be ported to Scala 3 soon.\n Building a sort of dynamic bundler that compiles the application along with extensions using Scala 3's given/implicits feature. (although technically that would not be a plug-gable architecture)\n distage-extension-plugins looks very promising but it's no ported to Scala 3 yet.\n Using a DI framework like Airframe, but it doesn't support dynamic loading.\n Using Guice? :-(\n  \nIs there any more Scala principled way of achieving that? or another paradigm that helps building a dynamic app ecosystem through plugins/extensions in Scala? or another long-term software management strategy or architecture that could work?\n PD: The reason I really really need Scala 3 is because I want to make it around new ADT implementation and use type-class derivation from them.\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/josemanuelp2  \n [link]   [comments]",

If I run the block in :session mode that gives me IndentationError: Unexpected Indent. If I remove the indents and re-run I get SyntaxError: return outside function.

When you are surfing on the web, and you come across a tutorial that you were looking for hours, and you consider that tutorial or parts of it a piece of gold to avoid boilerplate and save tons of hours of re-googling, how do you store that information using org-mode? \n Technically speaking, we are talking about non-actionable information that could be used potentially in the future. Do you use org-roam for this kind of stuff or what? And how do you organize the files, independent from your GTD workflow (if you have)? \n Would love to hear your methods, since I have a lot of tabs temporarily saved in bookmark on Firefox but I know that I would like to store that information filtered and processed by me.

          "description": "Hello /r/emacs,\n recently I've been working a lot with tables (with text rather than numbers), and for the first time in years I came to the conclusion that Emacs is not the best tool for a task (especially one it could in principle be good at), and thus for now I'm doing my tables in Google Docs. \n table.el is in principle suitable, but \n  \nit is not snappy,\n having multiple lines per cell requires empty lines between them, otherwise they will be collapsed into a single line (since I need multiple lines per cell I can't use the org-mode table editor)\n it has its own separate mode which doesn't work well with org-mode (particularly I'm missing lists and org-ref links)\n it is easy to mess up the table structure by accidentally typing on the lines,\n it cannot temporarily hide rows or columns (a Google Sheets feature I didn't expect to be so handy) and\n both navigating around and repositioning columns and rows is rather tedious.\n  \nOf course it is still a great piece of software, but I think it can be improved. I'll start to tinker with it soon-ish, but my elisp knowledge isn't the greatest, so I thought I'd ask here if anybody has ideas where to start. In particular, I have the hunch that child frames can be used to address the lack of snappiness, the empty lines issue and the lack of org-mode integration, but I haven't used them much myself, so perhaps someone with more experience has thoughts about their appropriateness. Also if there are other ideas how to improve editing text tables I'd love to hear them.\n Cheers!\n    submitted by    /u/swhalemwo  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi folks,\n Yesterday, I finished up putting my first custom keyboard together. It comes with a lot of extra keys, a couple of which are bound to 'Hyper' by default. 'Hyper' is a 'modifier' provided by QMK (the firmware that powers this board) that maps to pressing 'Control-Alt-Super-Shift' all together. Because there are no default mappings in the Hyper space, it seems like a good place to put some global Emacs shortcut keys that will absolutely-for-sure not ever get clobbered.\n While it would be easier to bind C-M-s-<foo> instead of H-<foo> and get more or less the same effect, I would like to be able to utilize C-x @ h (event-apply-hyper-modifier) as an option to 'gracefully degrade' on computers where I don't have my keyboard (for example: the Chromebook I occasionally play with Emacs on). That way those global binds can stay available and reasonably within reach. It doesn't seem possible to chain C-x @ mod application functions together, but even if it were possible, chaining 4 of them together would get really old really quickly.\n I would prefer for this to get handled by Emacs instead of getting handled by the OS, just for that extra level of 'don't need to account for some random specific machine configuration', but I'm open to suggestions on what to do there if no good options exist on the Emacs level. My main machine (the one the keyboard lives at) runs mostly Fedora Workstation, and sometimes Windows 10 Pro (though I almost never use Emacs in Windows).\n Thanks, all.\n    submitted by    /u/SoraFirestorm  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "[SOLVED] Thank you all!\n I am attempting to create a custom theme using ThemeCreator, but this problem also appears for other custom themes that aren't installed in bare Emacs, but come from the color-theme-modern package.\n For these themes, and the one I created and installed from a local file, the colors appear to be broken in my terminal (bash via GNOME terminal on Manjaro + GNOME). Using TERM=\"xterm-256color\" changes nothing, and in fact using TERM=\"xterm\" is slightly better (in the sense that it's closer to the original theme).\n I suspect something fishy is happening though, as the real issues set in after I agree to run the Lisp from these themes. For example, let's say I'm running wombat theme but want to switch to taylor. Everything looks fine (or what I consider fine) in wombat, I navigate up to taylor and hit enter, the colors change to something that looks nice but probably isn't Taylor (maybe some previous selection that isn't wombat), but then as soon as I allow the Lisp from Taylor to run, I get an absolutely horrible scheme that is almost unreadable.\n All appears well in GUI Emacs, but I am not interested in using that unfortunately.\n I have also tried other, more esoteric settings for the TERM variable, but to no avail. Any help would be greatly appreciated!\n    submitted by    /u/Buildout  \n [link]   [comments]",

It should be easy to make the background circular or squircular for those of you that prefer so.\n - I further smoothed the curves by removing extra degrees of freedom.\n - The logo shadow is now blurry and less opaque.\n - There is a subtle radial gradient that spotlights the logo and turns darker near the edges.\n - The upper and lower halves of the logo are slightly more proportionate.\n I've learned the basics of Inkspace and, against my expectations, I actually enjoyed using it :)\n I'm sharing a png image and its svg source (not permalinks, sorry, I promise to keep them online for some weeks at least).\n - png: https://drive.google.com/file/d/14BDnwlGa17ds0CZI1kNBNghqt4TSqVEl/view?usp=sharing\n - svg: https://drive.google.com/file/d/14L_roGCSD9dMnhL4Cq3w2_sfP4vvlk0_/view?usp=sharing\n Hope you like it.\n ​\n https://preview.redd.it/pqs4wh1n05z71.png?width=2048&format=png&auto=webp&s=d524e936fa57d86656b0e49444cf6b369da6e46c\n    submitted by    /u/nnenneplex  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello! I am a new user of emacs, and really exploring the configuration options around. But I just found some very annoying aspects that are driving me crazy.\n First:\n How on earth can I just use tabs in a sane way?\n In VSCode I found tabs pretty smart. Press the key once, and it dropped you on the correct indentation level for the line, press it more times and it inserted spaces to your liking. In emacs apparently the default behavior stops at the first part, but for example, in PHP I'm writing a SQL string and to avoid wraping I press enter, but then it goes to the beginning of the line and if I press tab it just won't work because it thinks it is still at the correct level of indentation. and to correct the string I have to press space for doing so. I have no idea how to search for this in google, and the few posts I found give no solution whatsoever, and some say \"just get used to it\".\n Second:\n Are modes always \"wonky\"? For example, I am writing PHP at the moment, and web mode is pretty deficient for it, inserting a \">\" character when I write \"<\" in a comparison because it thinks I'm writing an html tag. For that I installed PHP-mode, and now... formatting the file is impossible because it says that clang-formatter is not found. For web mode I installed Apheleia, and it works fine, but now I can't use it with PHP-mode. So how can I configure it so it works?\n And when I was just using web-mode, it suddenly, and apparently at random, just go back to fundamental mode. And had to enable web-mode manually several times. This is what made me install PHP-mode in the first place.\n I hope someone has an idea of how to fix this stuff, or at least point me in the right direction.

Ideally, I want the ability to export to a nice-looking format. Package tips, programming suggestions, everything welcome. Thanks :)\n I have a somewhat unconventional taste of music - at least when compared to my friends. I rarely play music I enjoy personally other than some beat tapes which are simply lit when hangin' out together.\n Now, I have been asked by one friend of mine to compile a list of music that I have enjoyed throughought the year. Since I actually enjoy sharing/discussing music, I agreed. So I compiled a list of songs - free form, no format etc. \n However, I've been wondering: I might be doing this every year from now on. First off, it was a bit tedious to do the freeform entry. Secondly, and more important, I don't want to manually search for duplicates when compiling my 2022 list. Finally, it would be nice if I could have this list (or a subset of such a list) exported either in a nice-looking pdf or in some other conventient form. \n Then, I thought to myself: well, since you can do practically everything with emacs, why shouldn't it be able to help me out this time?\n Thus, I'd love to hear your thoughts on the matter. It might be some kind of database thingy that is able (programmably) to detect duplicates. It might be a program that does EXACTLY what I want. It might be a hint on how to do autonumbering on an unformatted file. It might be a tip on how to automate the \"finding duplicates\" process. Anything, really :)\n Thanks a bunch, have a good day, fellows! :)\n    submitted by    /u/olivuser  \n [link]   [comments]",

I understand that trying to do the opposite (i.e., running a function in the middle of another function after exiting the minibuffer) can be tricky, as explained here, but I'm not sure if abo-abo's solution can be adapted to my case.\n I'd like to avoid using the minibuffer-setup-hook for simplicity's sake. The simple functionality I'm after is inserting the text at point as the first minibuffer text for the yas-insert-snippet command, but I can foresee needing similar functionality in more complex circumstances.

I removed the icon. I then went into Applications and launched an instance of Emacs. It worked. I added it to the favorites in the dock. I closed the instance. I then went to click the icon again. It opened a weird Emacsclient instance, which didn't split the frame into three windows like it always does at startup (I have this written in .emacs).\n To summarize, whenever I launch from the applications, I can start a \"normal\" Emacs version. As soon as I add its icon to the dock, the icon begins launching Emacs(client) version.\n In the applications, I have three icons: Emacs, Emacs(client), Emacs(Terminal).\n Any help on figuring out what is going on is appreciated. For one, I would love to learn what this client thing is as I have never seen nor used it. It would also be great to get to the usual behavior of just getting good old Emacs after clicking the icon in the dock. If there is reason to this client madness and it can be beneficial in this case, I am all ears.\n    submitted by    /u/rawlimerick  \n [link]   [comments]",

I can start the node server but I cannot connect to it. I'm not sure it starts the node server correctly; in the documentation it says that you can start the node server manually and then connect to it, but the code says otherwise (it always asks if you want to close the previous connection, doing nothing if you chose `no`, starting a new server if you choose `yes`)\n Evaluating TypeScript code leads to errors, even though the documentation and the discussions that I've seen lead to the impression that evaluating TypeScript should be no different than evaluating JavaScript code.\n Async functions cannot be evaluated with `indium-eval-last-node` since it only evaluates the code after the `function` token, ignoring the `async` token, which leads to the error that `await` cannot be used in non-async functions.\n The Indium setup documentation references functions that are no longer available, like `M-x indium-connect-to-nodejs`\n the last commit is from March 2021 and there are still open issues from 2017 and no responses from the developer\n  \nDeveloping such a huge and nice package is surely overwhelming.

Surely, using nativecomp is a new experience and everything felt very fast as compared to Emacs 27. But yesterday, I was facing Emacs freeze while editing a simple dockerfile which is hardly 100 lines ig and I inspected it in Htop and found that Emacs using 100% CPU. Then I killed emacs and run another instance and profiled it while editing same dockerfile but again I left with freezed Emacs. Again I tried same and found in profiler that evil (especially evil-ex command), timer.el(IDK what it is) and selectrum(precisely selectrum--update) using CPU. Then I removed evil packages from my init.el and replaced selectrum with vertico. Now, Emacs is usable. But it still lags (not freezes) in between and its due to native compilation turned on. \n Is this only happening to me or anyone else facing same issue?

          "description": "Are there good options for automatically adjusting text size for a frame based on the current display?\n I didn't find anything so I made a small package textsize that currently fits my needs quite well. It automatically chooses a font point size for the default face for the current frame, based on:\n  \nmonitor resolution: if it's lower res, typically want a smaller point size\n pixel pitch: higher point size on finer pitch screens\n manual per-frame adjustment available to shift the calculated value\n  \nFor me there is one current omission where automatic adjustment is fired via window-size-change-functions, which does not fire if the resolution is unchanged. e.g. Going from my 1080p laptop to a 1080p external. The only options I've seen for that require polling, which feels kind of distasteful. Anyone know of triggers I might catch for that?\n I could add rules around monitor size and/or frame size, though personally I haven't particularly wanted it. The manual adjustment is available for transient needs.\n I'd welcome comments both on the functionality, how I achieved it.\n  \nIs this reinventing another wheel I didn't find? This EmacsWiki page outlines some details but I didn't see automatic adjustment.\n \nI feel like my coding of 'thresholds' is clunky and a little obtuse - are the Elisp examples of something similar that's cleaner and clearer?\n \nMy default pixel pitch thresholds are guesses, as my day-to-day doesn't have a lot of variation on that.\n \n If you want to try it, load textsize.el and run (textsize-setup), and move things between disparate monitors (providing their resolution isn't the same!). Tweak the customizations and let me know if you think the defaults could be better or if you would want other rules.\n I can put it on MELPA if there's interest, but I feel like it could do with a bit more depth.\n    submitted by    /u/wjcferguson  \n [link]   [comments]",

I.e. specify this in my init.el file? For instance, this method in the worg tutorials is often suggested, but it seems to be for org-mode < v8.0.\n An alternative I've tried is to use #+SETUPFILE:~/my_template.org, which is a file that contains various #+LATEX_HEADER:\\usepackage{} lines.

I couldn't find another comprehensive resource for this.\n To make a start, here are some I'm aware of:\n  \nmagit-section: Create a ui like magit\n Taxy: Uses magit-section but in some cases makes it even more convenient and fast to put data into a buffer\n Tabulated List Mode: Not to forget the built-ins, tabulated list mode can also help setting up a buffer really fast if a tabulated list is all one needs\n Hierarchy: Put hierarchical data into a buffer with several convenience functions to display, query and action callbacks. Seems to be merged to emacs and even though the library is there, there is not documentation in the Elisp or Emacs manuals, so the git repo README is still useful for documentation.\n tree-widget.el: There seems to be a tree-widget.el in emacs core, seems this also can be used to build trees in buffers but I haven't used it and there seems to be no documentation in the Elisp or Emacs manuals about it so I don't really know how useful it is.\n  \n   submitted by    /u/editar  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "org-depend is nice, but it feels clunky to me - I use org-capture to add tasks to my to-do list whenever they occur to me, so I often end up with something like:\n * TODO Task 1 * WAIT Task 2 * WAIT Task 1.5 \n ...where I forgot there was a task that needed to be done between 1 and 2, and have to add it in later. In this situation, the \"chain-siblings\" trigger keyword to move tasks from \"WAIT\" to \"TODO\" doesn't really work out - plus, what about situations where Task 1 is a blocker for multiple other tasks, not all of which need to be completed in sequence?\n The trigger that works based on IDs seems more generally useful, but also even less ergonomic. If you want Task 1.5 to be enabled automatically after Task 1 is done, you have to create a UUID for 1.5, copy it, navigate to Task 1, and create a trigger property for it with the copied UUID value - which would certainly be a pain in the ass to do from e.g. the agenda.\n Something like org-linker-edna would be nice, but its functionality is tied pretty closely to Helm (I'm an Ivy user). Is ergonomic dependency creation (that is, with completion) something I'm gonna have to script up myself, or are there existing developments in this space?\n    submitted by    /u/summetria  \n [link]   [comments]",

If anyone has any idea what I'm going on about, please let me know!\n EDIT: I believe what I was looking for was use-package emacs and storing Emacs settings like (setq inhibit-startup-screen t) there, as raised in this post, found by u/graduale and u/scbagley. From other comments, it sounds like you can also configure built-in packages like dired using use-package as well, so that's helpful.

It seems that in my v28.0.60 if I open a tramp connection to a remote server that is behind a VPN, if the VPN connection is killed, emacs completely freezes. (to test, I just open a dired remote directory, and sever the connection. Instant beachballing.) I've tried setting tramp verbose mode to 10 and sending SIGUSR2, but am having trouble getting useful information (for me). Once the freezing happens, I can't recover and its becoming extremely frustrating. SIGUSR2 can at least let me get back into emacs, but in a debug mode. The only message I could see was about a premature ending and Forbiddent reentrant tramp. (I don't have the exact messages right now, but could get them.)\n I do have a copy of my v26 emacs, and it does not have the same problem. When the VPN/remote connection is killed, emacs locks up for a few seconds, before it simply times out, and I can keep going. Annoying, but not a show-stopper.\n In each case, I am starting with emacs -Q option and the only extra command I'm using before opening files is ido-mode.\n I did stumble on  this issue  which mentions that start-file-process-shell-command was changed between v26 and v28. Is what I am noticing something related to that?\n The behavior is very different between versions on the same computer (and ssh configuration), and I am loading things with the \"-Q\" option for no init file.

In my current job, I do a lot of investigation into our production issues. org-mode is a huge part of my daily workflow, and I wanted something that would make it easier to save NewRelic queries (and their results) in org-mode as I typically will export an org-mode heading to html to format the text in a way that is easy to share between many different services (Confluence/Jira/Github/ect.). \n If there are any other NewRelic and Emacs users out there hopefully this is useful! Also, I'd love some feedback elisp wise as it's my first serious attempt at writing a package for Emacs. A lot is still pretty rudimentary like error handling, but if you have interest in something like this let me know as it currently meets my needs, and I'm wondering if I should take it further. \n https://github.com/mack1070101/nrql.el\n    submitted by    /u/mack1070  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi guys, I'm sharing a minimal recipe to build emacs with native compilation in macOS. More precisely, to add native compilation to your already working build procedure. I've found that it's extremely simple nowadays but also that instructions are scattered around the web, often outdated, sometimes hit-and-miss, sometimes buried deep inside complex build scripts that do a bunch of other things. So I wanted to get an up-to-date minimal working recipe and actually understand what I was doing instead of blindly copy&pasting code. The outcome gladly surprised me as trivial.\n Assuming you have brew installed and have checked out emacs-28:\n  brew install gcc brew install libgccjit ... ./configure --with-native-compilation ... \n Remarks:\n  \ngcc is not the compiler used during the traditional build. Instead, the clang installed alongside your macOS command line tools will be picked as usual. But gcc will be the one compiling elisp to native code (please correct me here if I'm wrong).\n \n--with-native-compilation flag is not required (it's already the default!) but by adding it you ensure that any issue while enabling native compilation gets reported loud and clear. If there is any problem, try this in order to diagnose it: https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/jit/intro/tutorial01.html.\n \nBe prepared for long build times. Also, you might feel disappointed the first time you launch your new build of emacs. But this is likely because the JIT compiler is compiling your packages (you may see a bunch of compiler warnings in *Messages*, new files appearing in ~/.emacs.d/eln-cache and some processes burning your CPUs).\n \nI'm on Big Sur 11.6.\n \n EDIT: I've been using it for a while it's really, but really, snappy! Now that I'm typing in this reddit textarea it feels clunky as in 2 hours average latency.\n    submitted by    /u/nnenneplex  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I'm experimenting with using a clean build from straight.el in order to reproduce a bug I'm chasing down, but got sidetracked in this endeavor by experiencing some other weird behavior (a familiar story to all the members of the Church, I'm sure).\n I launch Emacs with emacs -Q -l ~/.emacs.d/straight/repos/straight.el/bootstrap.el, then evaluate the following buffer.\n (straight-use-package 'org) (require 'org) (with-eval-after-load 'org-agenda (setq org-agenda-files '(\"~/todo.org\"))) \n After this, I do M-x org-agenda t, move the cursor over an entry, and do C-c C-x e to assign an effort. If I then do e.g. \"0:15 RET\" though, I get a \"Symbol's function definition is void: org-duration-to-minutes\" error. Weirdly, this error goes away if I remove the line (require 'org) from the above config.\n I've checked, and the straight.el build files for org do have org-duration-to-minutes listed as an autoload in org-loaddefs.el. I feel like my brain is just mush after the work week. What am I missing?\n edit:\n I'm on GNU Emacs 27.2, with Arch Linux, Linux 5.10.64-1-lts x86_54, and the latest version of Org, 9.5-g531577.\n Doing M-x list-load-path-shadows yields the same results for both of these cases - after running org-agenda, 114 packages are shadowed (everything from the built-in org is shadowed by everything in straight/repos/org).\n The load history is a lot to parse through, but the only important thing I've found so far is that after I call org-agenda, org-loaddefs.el appears in the load-history of the version without a require statement, but not in the version with a require statement.\n edit2: Solved!

I tried installing v. 28, but the problem persisted.\n I then noticed that, if I loaded and evaluated the file org-compat.el (in org-mode's lisp directory), the problem didn't occur. The function referred to in the error message (org-file-name-concat) is defined in that file, and is conditional upon a specific version of Emacs.\n I discovered that the problem was caused by an incompatibility of sorts between the (old) version of org-mode installed with Emacs on my machines, and the (newest) version of org-roam installed by straight.\n Apparently, Emacs loads the old, default version of org-mode rather than the newer one installed later by straight (something which other users have noticed before).\n My fix consisted in deleting the old version from my machines.\n On Linux, I deleted the org directory on /usr/share/emacs/27.2/lisp/\n and on Mac, on /usr/local/Cellar/emacs-plus@27/27.2/share/emacs/27.2/lisp/\n I wanted to shared this information with other users who might be experiencing similar issues.\n    submitted by    /u/pailanderCO  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I've written a transient.el menu with enough columns of shortcuts that the text starts to wrap at the right part of the screen when viewing on a smaller laptop display. Is there a best practice to modify the size of a transient's window? Ideally I'd like to remove the wrapping continuation lines of the transient's buffer, as the wrapping disrupts the layout of all the text. I'd also like to limit the transient window's height, though I've been playing around with transient-display-buffer-action without luck. If I could limit the window height and width, I'm guessing transient-scroll-up and transient-scroll-down would allow me to see whatever parts of the transient buffer are hidden by making the window smaller...\n The only working solution I've found is to use the predicate keywords (e.g., :if, :if-nil) to change up my transient's column arrangement depending on which computer I'm on, for example:\n (transient-define-prefix my-transient () [\"MISC\" [:if (lambda () (string= system-name \"MY-LAPTOP\")) (\"R\" \"Avy Char in Line\" avy-goto-char-in-line) (\"P\" \"Pop Mark\" avy-pop-mark) (\"DEL\" \"Other Buffer\" other-window)] ] [\"Help\" [:if (lambda () (string= system-name \"MY-LAPTOP\")) (\"SPC\" \"Avy char\" avy-goto-char)] ]) \n But I would prefer the solutions in the first paragraph if possible.

Git-Modes provides three simple major modes for editing Git configuration files.\n Previously these modes were available from Melpa as three separate packages named gitattributes-mode, gitconfig-mode and gitignore-mode. These packages have been removed and you should remove them locally too and then install git-modes, but make sure that it is already available before you do. That can take a few hours.\n The motivation for merging the packages into just one is that while many users may only regularly edit .git/config and maybe .gitignore, it is not such a bad thing if a major mode is ready to go when they first open .gitattributes.\n More in the announcement.\n    submitted by    /u/tarsius_  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm looking to write a function that will return a hierarchical list of all open Org files as well as the headings inside of them, and allow me to insert a link to any one of them, without having to leave the current buffer to store a link, or enter the heading manually.\n You can kind of patch this together using counsel-org-goto-all, which provides an alist of all headings from all open Org files, with entries (HEADER . MARKER). Just write your own Ivy action that uses (concat \"file:\" (marker-buffer (cdr x)) \"::*\" (car x)) in order to build the destination of the link and pass it to org-insert-link, then call that action on a goto-all candidate.\n However, this feels pretty bootleg, and doesn't work when linking to files. I tried concatenating the results of calling counsel-outline-candidates and counsel-buffer-or-recentf-candidates, but this doesn't give a nice hierarchical structure, and you have to start doing a bunch of ugly conditional stuff to tell if you're dealing with a file or a heading inside the action.

(Maybe a theme problem of coloration?)\n ex: In Selectrum/marginalia/orderless if I hit find-file and start typing something, and the filter list is say 10 items long.. if the mouse _happens_ to be in the bottom couple inches of screen, well, Selectrum will show a full width highlight on the row the mouse is on; which can mean that as you're typing, you're seeing two highglight lines - the one that is targetted by seledtrum if you hit (say) return, and the one the mouse is over. Its annoying since they colour the same (maybe fixable in theme, I'll check.) \n Likewise, in buffer+ buffer listing, the mouse will highlight a row, as will the one I'm looking at with the keyboard.\n Changing themes (if a buffer supports a face for mouse at all) all over the place could be error prine and annoying.\n What I think I'm proposing is .. define (say) a minor mode that causes the mouse pointer to be ignored, hidden, or even blocked (don't let the mouse enter the confines of the window the mode is applied to?) ... then I could add some hooks on say prog-mode to add this minor mode (as well as minibuffer, say).

          "description": "I love these global minor modes like Helm, Ivy, Selectrum, or Vertico, which all display a list of completions in the minibuffer that filters and updates the display with every key press. But their user interfaces are always operated only from within the minibuffer.\n Are there any Emacs Lisp packages like these which could display almost exactly what you would see in the minibuffer, but in an actual buffer as a major mode instead, along the lines of ibuffer but for listing arbitrary strings and not just listing buffers?\n I would like a tool that works in Emacs sort of like how you would use \"dmenu\" to make a menu from text taken from STDIN. But for my use case, I would like to take an arbitrary newline-separated list of strings and make an interactive menu out of it in a separate Emacs buffer. Also it would be nice to have the ability to re-order list elements, the ability to mark elements (like you would do with files in Dired), and the ability to copy the list of marked items to the kill ring or else insert the list of items as a string into some other buffer, the same way that pressing \"Enter\" in Dmenu will dump the selected items to STDOUT.\n So for example, I would maybe select a region of my text buffer, press my key chord to turn that text it into a menu buffer in a new window, filter/rearrange/select elements, then press Enter and replace the region from whence it came.\n Does anyone know of a major mode like this, or a way of configuring something like Vertico to work in the way I described? Or alternatively, is it possible to use something like ibuffer or list-buffers for displaying arbitrary lists of strings rather than just buffers?\n    submitted by    /u/ramin-honary-xc  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I have made a minor « normal mode » for personal use, basically mapping navigation or editing commands to keys instead of self-insert-command. I mapped <escape> in prog-mode to switch to it and it's been serving me well.\n Recently, I had the idea of extending the normal mode bindings when a specific major mode is active. Specifically, I want <return> in my normal mode to call markdown-edit-code-block, but only when markdown-mode is active.\n I didn't want to add a binding that checks what the major mode is with cond and whatnot, as it didn't seem like a very clean or modular solution. Instead, I created a second minor mode with the one binding I need for markdown-mode and set it as a buffer-local variable. Now, when my normal mode activates, it checks whether the variable is non-nil, and calls it.\n It works, but since I don't know everything about emacs, I'm wondering if anyone has encountered this problem before and if there's an even simpler solution that I'm missing.\n    submitted by    /u/flora_best_maid  \n [link]   [comments]",

It happens quite often that while I'm writing a note I end up pressing ESC twice in a row (for example to cancel a search in the note, or the spelling box), and suddenly I lose the view of the note. While I can easily go back to the note, it still takes a bit of time to find the line I was at. Plus, there is an annoying break in the flow.\nI was wondering if others had a similar experience and if they have a solution. Maybe redefining ESC with Keyboard Maestro, in such a way that one can still use this to cancel the other boxes (find, spelling etc.)? I find the role of ESC to Reset Search more intuitive in the Omnibar (when it's active), rather than in the body of the note itself.",

For this to be possible, the method of storage must not place its own restraints on the information. This is why a \"web\" of notes with links (like references) between them is far more useful than a fixed hierarchical system. When describing a complex system, many people resort to diagrams with circles and arrows. Circles and arrows leave one free to describe the interrelationships between things in a way that tables, for example, do not. The system we need is like a diagram of circles and arrows, where circles and arrows can stand for anything.\n\n\nFrom Tim Berners-Lee's original proposal for the worldwide web.

These are the types of connections I know of yet:\nSo, do you think that having a personal typology of link types is helpful in making more meaningful connections between ideas?\n(P.S. Stupid me deleted my previous Zettelkästen because I wasn't satisfied with the connections I made.

It makes finding and drilling down things so much easier.\nOne can just type in 202109301009 and boom pdf or spreadsheet shows up in finder....it's like having an ISBN number for files. [I tend to use the format with periods.. e.g.  2021.0930.1009 since my brain reads this easier, and I can just type 2021.09 and find all files created in september of 2021]\nIf Gmail could do something like this automatic like The Archive, it would be so much better. \nMany Thanks,",

It struck me that this material would be an excellent source for people new to the Zettelkasten world, who might like to practice writing zettels from short and interesting (but not too demanding) essays.  It might even prove to be the source of some zettels that you want to include in your own ZK \nSee: https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/05/20/the-best-commencement-addresses-of-all-time/\nMy apologies that these seem to be US-centric, likely due to the predilections of the person preparing the compilation.
