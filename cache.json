The way I would solve this in an OO language is that I would add some fields to Token listing things like source file, column and line.\n So I tried something like:\n  data Position = Pos String Int Int \n and then\n  data Token = Lambda Position | Dot Position | LParen Position | RParen Position | Ident String Position deriving Show \n But this is just awful. Now, my parse function is broken because all my pattern matches are wrong. What's the \"right\" way to do this?

          "description": "Hi all,\n After trying a few effect systems (starting with monad transformers), it seems that most people consider the ReaderT eff IO pattern the most pragmatic way to handle extensible effects. This includes UnliftIO, which is considered \"the good way\" to do MonadBaseControl stuff, and some libraries even require UnliftIO instead of MonadBaseControl for unlifting IO.\n However, it seems that UnliftIO has zero support for Either-based error handling and ReaderT eff IO just assumes that you are using exceptions. Particularly after writing quite some Rust, I think that Either/Result is just a superior way to do error handling (specially with syntactic support or some abstractions to convert and generate error types). Unchecked exceptions in my opinion are bad, and feel like I'm back in Python-land where your program can crash at any time from anywhere without any guidance from type signatures.\n Are we supposed to forget about Either and typing and just embrace exceptions, or is there any hope in this regard? Can UnliftIO support this in any way? (I consider wrapping-throwing-catching-unwrapping Lefts more of a workaround)\n    submitted by    /u/xcv--  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I've made a small library with implementations of two truth maintenance systems (TMSs) available on Hackage and Github. They are translations of Forbus and de Kleer's justification-based and assumption-based (JTMS and ATMS) algorithms.\n TMS algorithms are classic AI approaches to reasoning about logical implication relationships. Code using a TMS defines nodes representing sentences or logical ideas, and how some nodes can be used to conclude other nodes. We can also identify \"nogood\" or contradictory sets of nodes. Some nodes are distinguished as assumptions, and the TMS lets us reason about how the belief or disbelief in each assumption impacts whether we should also believe or disbelieve other nodes.\n  \nIn the JTMS, the believe/disbelieve setting for each assumption is set directly, and the JTMS maintains the believe/disbelieve status of each node based on the current assumption beliefs.\n In the ATMS, there is no setting of \"current\" beliefs. Instead, the ATMS tracks the minimal consistent sets of assumptions which justify belief in each node.\n  \nPlease do not look for beautiful and pure functional algorithms here! At this point the implementations are direct translations of the original imperative Common Lisp implementations, implemented as a monad transformer, and using STT. A non-stateful re-implementation remains an interesting idea for the (non-short-term) future! I wrote this library to give myself a bit more insight into how these algorithms work on the inside, and some deeper practice with the state thread libraries than I'd had before, but I hope you find them interesting or useful.\n  \nThe Hackage page\n The Github repos\n Wikipedia entry on reason maintenance\n A standard reference on the subject, probably available at a library near you\n  \n[Edited for a typo.]\n    submitted by    /u/jpmrst  \n [link]   [comments]",

However I've only used oop-languages before, so I'm not sure whether I followed best practices when writing this. For example, I used data records to store the current state of the program in, and most functions operate on this data type. To me this seems kind of like reinventing oop-concepts in a functional language.\n The main logic of the program is found in app/TestState.hs, and app/UI.hs is responsible for drawing the tui. I sorted the functions by their usecase, exported functions coming first. I wrote a lot of internal functions for readability, and kept them pointfree when possible (is this sensible?)\n The code is available here.\n I'd appreciate any feedback on these points or on my code structure in general.

I'd be elated if someone manages to find an explanation for that.\n The code is here:\n https://github.com/stu214634/Chesskell\n Since this was a learning project the code quality varies greatly, still i hope it isn't too atrocious.\n Edit: Due to the way the transposition table is implemented building and running with multiple threads causes significant slow-down.\n    submitted by    /u/Kindredwastaken  \n [link]   [comments]",

Actually, profiling shows that 50% of runtime is spent in expression evaluation, so I'm keen to optimise this as much as possible.\n ​\n Here's an explicit example. Our expression has a simple data type definition.\n infixl 4 :+: infixl 5 :*: data Expr = Const Double | Var !Int | Exp !Expr | !Expr :*: !Expr | !Expr :+: !Expr deriving (Eq, Generic, NFData) \n Next, evaluation is done by plugging in a vector of parameters. Specific parameters are chosen by the Int in the Var constructor, which just acts as an index for the vector.\n type ParamState = Vector Double evalWith :: ParamState -> Expr -> Double evalWith params expr = case expr of Const c -> c Var x -> params ! x Exp a -> exp (evalWith params a) a :+: b -> evalWith params a + evalWith params b a :*: b -> evalWith params a * evalWith params b \n I can now define an equation of 6 variables as an expression, and evaluate with a vector of parameters. If I just write out the equation as a Haskell function, criterion says that it takes 9ns to run. The same equation in my Expr data type takes 70ns.\n This is by no means slow, but if half of my runtime is spent in evalWith, then every nanosecond counts!\n So, any ideas on improvements? Inlining evalWith seems to do nothing, I suppose due to the function being so simple already. Any help or insights would be appreciated :)\n    submitted by    /u/aramend  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Intuitively speaking, a foldable allows you to list all it's elements and a functor allows you to apply a function to all its elements. But if a foldable contains elements surely you can map over them! Well no... Sometimes you don't want to and sometimes you actually can't.\n Consider Set for example. Given a set you can turn it into a list. But since Set is implemented using some sort of balancing tree that makes use of the Ord instance to provide fast membership lookup, simply fmaping over it will destroy that carefully crafted structure. It is possible to write a Functor Set instance, but it would make it useless as a set.\n But these are just \"arbitrary\" rules that we impose on the data structure. Here is an example of a foldable for which no functor instance can be implemented:\n data OnlyInt b where OnlyInt ::Int -> OnlyInt Int instance Foldable OnlyInt where foldMap f (OnlyInt i) = f i \n I also see no laws for foldables that would forbid data WeirdBool a = WeirdBool a (a -> Bool) to be foldable.\n All three of these data types are foldables that aren't traversable, simply because they already fail to be functorial. What eludes me is, whether or not there are any foldable functors, that cannot have a traversable instance. If foldable+functor would be equivalent to traversable, then could you write sequenceF :: (Functor f, Foldable f, Applicative m) => f (m a) -> m (f a)? I sure as hell can't. But just because you cannot proof that equivalence in haskell doesn't mean it isn't true (I think Gödel's incompleteness theorem applies, but I only know the pop-science interpretation).\n However if they aren't equivalent, then there must be a data type that is foldable and functorial. But I have failed to find one so far...\n I think about it from time to time and would really like to know the answer.

When this comes up you can often work with a GADT that assigns a different tag to each constructor, and live with the pain of an existential wrapper when you don't know what constructor something will need to return. But doing this always has the cost of needing to introduce types to serve as the per-constructor tags, and I was wondering if I could do better.\n I realized that with DataKinds and PolyKinds, it was possible to refer to any constructor in the same type argument, so I decided to see what would happen if I tried it:\n {-# Language DataKinds, GADTs, StandaloneKindSignatures, PolyKinds #-} import GHC.Types type Foo :: forall k. k -> Type -> Type data Foo tag a where First :: a -> Foo 'First a Last :: Foo 'Last () \n And, well...\n :6:23: error: • Data constructor ‘First’ cannot be used here (it is defined and used in the same recursive group) • In the first argument of ‘Foo’, namely ‘'First’ In the type ‘Foo 'First a’ In the definition of data constructor ‘First’ | 6 | First :: a -> Foo 'First a | ^^^^^^ \n Is this restriction serving an important purpose?

I want to write a parser for a simple DSL using Megaparsec and for this I'm following the Megaparsec tutorial here. At the beginning of the tutorial the author provides the following example for constructing a parser for the string \"abc\": haskell -- Parsec as defined in the library is: -- type Parsec e s a = ParsecT e s Identity a type Parser = Parsec Void Text mySequence :: Parser (Char, Char, Char) mySequence = do a <- char 'a' b <- char 'b' c <- char 'c' return (a, b, c) Here is what I'm trying to understand, char has the signature: char :: (MonadParsec e s m,‏‏‎‏‏‎‏‏‎‏‏‎­Token s ~ Char) => Token s -> m (Token s) see docs here. In our case m is Identity and (Token s) is Char, so char 'a' should return Identity Char and therefore the do block in mySequence should resolve to value of type Identity (Char, Char, Char), or am I missing something? My question is, how can the type of mySequence be of type Parser (Char, Char, Char) instead of Identity (Char, Char, Char)? Is this some monad transformer magic in ParsecT that allows for this? Similarly later in the tutorial the author introduces the following example using <|>: haskell pScheme :: Parser Text pScheme = string \"data\" <|> string \"file\" <|> string \"ftp\" <|> string \"http\" <|> string \"https\" <|> string \"irc\" <|> string \"mailto\" Same thing here, string \"data\" <|> string \"file\" has the signature: haskell <|> :: Identity Text -> Identity Text -> Identity Text So how come that it can be resolved to Parser Text and not Identity Text?

          "description": "I came up with a cute method to turn a grammar into a parser, and I wondered if it was something that people have done before.\n Basically, the idea is you unfold the grammar into a set of all the trees it produces (using a data structure built with Free), and then fold this structure into a combinator parser. For the fold and unfold, I use the recursion-schemes library (which conveniently knows exactly how to unfold and fold Free structures).\n Here's the code of a simple version. In practice, I added a fancier recursion scheme (gchrono), more use of megaparsec, and a fancier grammar, but this is the core idea:\n ```\n import Text.Megaparsec.Char (string) import qualified Data.Text as T import Text.Megaparsec (ParsecT, runParserT, errorBundlePretty, many, (<|>)) import Data.Void (Void, absurd…",

Each constructor within designates a command subparser and its field type designates a record type containing all the options for this specific subparser.\n I'm generalizing/automating this pattern using generics-sop. The code is quite large so I'll post it in this gist.\n I'm curious whether that implementation could be simplified. By simplification, I'm mostly mean less noise. I'm curious whether there are utility functions, types and constraints provided by generics-sop already that invalidate the need for typeclasses like NSFrom and similar types I've handrolled there. I'd also be curious to know whether certain snippets could be improved in a general sense.\n    submitted by    /u/Phantom569  \n [link]   [comments]",

I think I'd need to add another typeclass as a constraint, but changing function's type doesn't seem right.\n Also I'm curious about other ways to implement mapConcurrently using mapConcurrently_.\n ```\n !/usr/bin/env stack\n -- stack --resolver lts-12.21 script {-# LANGUAGE NoImplicitPrelude #-} import RIO import Test.Hspec import Control.Concurrent.STM (check) import Data.List (sortBy) import Data.Ord (comparing) import Prelude (putStrLn)\n mapConc :: MonadUnliftIO m => (a -> m b) -> [a] -> m [b] mapConc action inputs = withRunInIO $ \\runInIO -> runInIO $ do lstTV <- newTVarIO [] flip mapConcurrently_ (inputs zip [0..]) $ (x, idx) -> do -- threadDelay ((10 - idx) * 1000 * 1000) y <- action x atomically $ modifyTVar lstTV $ \\lst -> ((idx, y) : lst) atomically $ do lst <- readTVar lstTV check $ length lst == length inputs return $ fmap snd $ sortBy (comparing fst) lst\n main :: IO () main = hspec $ it \"works\" $ do let action x = putStrLn (show x) >> return (show x) mapConc action [1..10] shouldReturn fmap show [1..10]\n ```\n    submitted by    /u/shiraeeshi  \n [link]   [comments]",

This means that you can set up things like parsers combinators that can be \"viewed\" as an abstract grammar, in addition to a parser.\n (An issue of course is that, when using arrows, you can't use the outputs of an arrow to determine what effects to imply.

          "description": "Edit: New example of using Servant with Okapi here. If anything, I think Okapi could make a nice prototyping tool for getting something out the door quickly. Read more about how to embed Okapi apps into Servant here.\n Hello Community,\n Over the past few weeks I've been working on a new server-side microframework called Okapi (I'm open to name suggestions).\n Okapi is a monadic parser, but for HTTP requests. It's inspired by F#'s Giraffe and the simplicity of web frameworks in other programming languages like Python and Ruby. It's meant to be a simple, idiomatic alternative to other frameworks in the Haskell ecosystem. A summary of what Okapi is can be found here.\n If you're interested in testing Okapi out, take a look at the documentation. I recommend going through the crash course (still finishing it) to get a feel for what you can do with this library.\n To see an example of what a web server built with Okapi looks like, take a look at this implementation of the realworld backend spec. You can use it to compare it to other implementations of the same spec. The Okapi implementation passes all the required tests and is a good idea of what you can expect from the framework.\n Okapi is still in the early experimental stage, so I would highly recommend NOT to use it for production projects or important side projects. The API is subject to major changes. The main reason why I want to show Okapi to the community this early in its' development is to get feedback as soon as possible to make sure this is something worth investing more time into. I'd love to hear opinions from Haskellers and non-Haskellers of all skill levels and backgrounds.\n If you'd like to open an issue or PR, the repo is here. Contributions are more than welcome.\n Here are some more interesting links:\n  \nMotivation behind Okapi\n Inspiration for Okapi\n Another example\n GitHub repo\n Edit: Servant+Okapi Example\n  \n   submitted by    /u/MonadicSystems  \n [link]   [comments]",

Examples: Foo(a: String, b: String), Bar(c: BigDecimal, d: Set, e: Option). And so on..\n \nI would like to have a \"rule\" or mechanism of some sort that would enforce compile time that for each companion object of these classes need to declare a corresponding val for each of it's companion class constructor parameters. \n \nLet's say I have a class ParamRules(rule1: String, rule2: String)\n \nNaive idea in my head looks like that:\n \n case class Foo(a: String, b:String)\n object Foo extends MagicMechanism(Foo) ( val a_rules = ParamRules(...) val b_rules = ParamRules(...) )\n And with that compiler is satisfied.\n If the object Foo doesn't implement a \"rule\" for one of there constructor params it fails compilation.\n  \nIt doesn't have to look like that it could be entirely different I just want to dynamically enforce this interface user to provide rule for each of the params in the class. \n  \nLet me know if I'm day dreaming, over engineering or simply having a stroke and if you need any more explanation.\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/yodlowy  \n [link]   [comments]",

The code base that supports the examples/discussion is written in scala. \n I wanted to experiment with scala and compare it to the scripting languages that I am more familiar with for this type of work (R, python, stata). Bottom line is that data science in scala is a bliss! I enjoyed mill to manage dependencies, ammonite to run investigative workflows, and smile to train/deploy statistical models. Also, writing data transforms, which is the bulk of most data science workflows, is so much easier in scala.\n I hope you will find the content interesting/useful, and I would welcome any type feedback.

I just started in a new job where I am able to decide what language to use for our new backend. I would love to use Scala, however, finding the appropriate libraries/frameworks for Scala seems like a hassle. For Java/Kotlin its a no brainer : Spring Boot.\n Because of this, I'm not sure if its worth to go for Scala even. \n I have been looking at:\n Rest api:\n Play - No support for Scala 3 yet?\n Http4s\n Cask\n Akka http\n DI:\n No library - Cake pattern (or any other way without any library)\n MacWire \n Datebase access:\n Quill\n Doobie\n Slick\n ScalikeJDBC \n Trying to find out what we should choose is giving me a headeache. In my earlier job we used\n Akka Http, Cake pattern and ScalikeJDBC, but I don't want to use this stack just because I have experience in it. For example, a quick google search has shown me that the cake pattern really is not a good way to do DI (although I personally didn't have any strong problems with it, although it did became a little bit messy when the code base grew big).

          "description": "I'm probably going to butcher this question.\n I have a trait being used as a variant type (for a dummy interpreter) with a bunch of Conversion methods. Here's a simple example:\n ```scala sealed trait Variant\n case class Fixnum(i: Int) extends Variant case class Flonum(f: Double) extends Variant case class Str(s: String) extends Variant\n // Variant <-> Int here, figure the others exist as well... given Conversion[Int, Variant] = Fixnum(_) given Conversion[Variant, Int] = _ match case Fixnum(i) => i case Flonum(f) => f.toInt case _ => throw Exception(\"type err\") ```\n Now, I can use the above to pass my Variant type to any function that takes an Int and it works as expected. However, what I can't seem to do is use an Int as a generic type parameter like so (shortened for clarity):\n ```scala // works fine.. def unaryIntPrim(f: Int => Variant)(xs: List[Variant]): List[Variant] = xs match case x :: xs => f(x) :: xs\n // doesn't compile.. def unaryPrim[A](f: A => Variant)(xs: List[Variant]): List[Variant] = xs match case x :: xs => f(x) :: xs ```\n I can understand why unaryPrim doesn't compile, but presumably there's a type constraint I can add to A to ensure \"can be implicitly converted from a Variant\" or an implicit argument I can add that ensures the conversion is possible?\n I can get rid of the compile error by matching against the type (x : A), but it warns that the type check cannot be performed at runtime, which makes me think that isn't going to work either.\n Any thoughts on how I might be able to accomplish the above would be great.

          "description": "Hello, \n I'm beginning to learn Scala via a project I got lined up in my work. I want to build SQL queries programmatically. As source I have an Excel file that I read into Databricks using Scala, e.g.\n val apoDF = spark.read .format(\"csv\") .option(\"header\", \"true\") //first line in file has headers .option(\"delimiter\",\";\") .option(\"mode\", \"PERMISSIVE\") .load(\"dbfs:/FileStore/shared_uploads/[MY_ACCOUNT]/[SOURCE_FILE].csv\") apoDF.createOrReplaceTempView(\"apo\") \n The Excel file contains all info I need to rebuild the SQL statements, like ids, source view (string), object ids...\n So, after reading the Excel file into Databricks I get a DataFrame.\n The data I need from this file as multidimensional array would look like this:\n ​\n https://preview.redd.it/hmcgc5xbuar81.png?width=934&format=png&auto=webp&s=8b0a5bca137992544b67ca9871e2fb14a8c65c1a\n Since I'm coming from webDev / php I still think in multidimensional arrays and the concept of DataFrames is new to me.\n What is best practice? Should I build a multidimensional array first and query afterwards the data I need from it? Something tells me that this wouldn't make that much sense since all data is available already in the dataFrame?\n What I am trying right now is to localize the data I need and store in a variable, e.g.\n val uViewName = spark.sql(\"SELECT View_Name FROM apo WHERE Param_Id = 2869169\") uViewName.show() \n This could be packed into a function .... or method of class?\n Thanks for any advice, much appreciated!\n    submitted by    /u/cptstoneee  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Most of us are familiar with tree-style thinking that org-mode seamlessly enables, where a parent node has an infinite amount of tree children. From a gardening perspective this works great if you're not breeding and instead just saving seed, as you can structure the data as follows, where each subheading is a genetic descendant of the parent:\n ​\n ** San Marzano Tomato\n :PROPERTIES:\n :WHATEVER: WHATEVER\n :END:\n *** Plant 1\n :ID: sjkjlfkjh\n :YIELD: Xlbs\n [inline image]\n notes\n *** Plant 2\n :ID: oijiohiuhi\n :YIELD: Ylbs\n [inline image]\n notes\n **** Plant 2, Gen 1\n etc\n ​\n So I use emacs and org-mode for everything (of course), and being able to snap pics and add properties on the fly would be AMAZING for organizing anything cultivation related with minimal friction/overhead. Where organization and documentation tends to be most important is in breeding, and I'm unsure how I'd represent say a San Marzano and Roma cross elegantly. Of course I could create a new tree for each cross, but I recall reading org having some functionality (probably using tags and unique ID's) to make this seamless or somehow superior, I believe it was presented as a sort of directed acyclic graph using tags. Using org-mode at all for this would be great since HTML exports would be a freebie.\n ​\n This isn't complicated, but I'm just wondering how you might organize something like this so I don't have an 'a-ha' moment later and decide to restructure everything (but who am I kidding.. that's half the fun). I'm sort of thinking a tree per cross may end up best, since it'll work most naturally with org-mode, and the top level node can include inline images of each parent in the cross, and properties like :ID-FATHER:, :ID-MOTHER: etc.\n    submitted by    /u/AphexPin  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I have been using org-noter to read epubs in org-mode, which works fine until recently. When it is a pdf file, everything still works as before. However, when it comes to an epub file, org-noter will not work. I'm not sure why this happened but didn't want to bother to dig into this issue because it is not the first time this package breaks down on me. Consequently, I need to think of a different way to read epubs and take notes in org-mode. Since I already use calibre to manage my ebooks, my new workflow simply combines using calibre links and xdg-open.\n The native ebook viewer in calibre allows us to export links to specific locations in the book. The link looks like \"calibre://view-book/someid/somefomat?open_at=somelocation\". Using xdg-open with this link opens the specified book at the exact location. The default viewer enables highlights and other annotation methods, which is also a plus. So all I need to do is to add a new link parameter for \"calibre\" in org mode and define a follow method. Below is a snippet.\n  \n(org-link-set-parameters \n \"calibre\" \n :follow 'my/calibre-follow \n ) \n (defun my/calibre-follow (path) \n (call-process \"xdg-open\" nil 0 nil (concat \"calibre:\" path)))\n  \nIt is a very simple implementation but it does the job.

Ideally such logic could be defined in emacs.el;\n  \n​\n Out of all these 2 and 3 are the most important, as my notes can be lengthy and I use ToC to quickly navigate. Having them as headers at the top isn't optimal as I'd always have to return to search again.As for #3, I'm having quite a few tables in my notes. At times, some columns are green, some are red. It's important as it helps differentiate.\n ​\n Can it be done? I'm looking for such orgmode examples, but can't quite find anything that fits the bill.\n    submitted by    /u/357951  \n [link]   [comments]",

The point of Emacs is to not have to move your hands off the home row, everything accessible at the fingertips... Not go back and forth between arrow keys and home row. It feels like org mode doesn't even fit Emacs, isn't useful, and I can't see how it does anything in a better way than TeX/LaTeX, Markdown, literal plain text, etc. Sorry about the rant, I just don't understand how anybody uses this...\n    submitted by    /u/MrTinyToes  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi, r/orgmode!\n Since citations in orgmode are now native (hurray!), I've come to wonder whether it is possible to use the same document as the source for the citations.\n Via org-babel blocks it is possible to write a bibliography in orgmode and tangle it to a bib-file. This mechanism is sufficient if you decide to use only one or two org documents for literature summaries, reading lists etc. like Gregory Stein does. But it becomes unwieldy, if you want to use a single file per book/article with self-contained bibliographic information, because you have to create a lot of single bibliographies, that clutter up the org-folder.\n The selfcontainment of bibliographic information seems very attractive for me because single files can be shared without thinking about needed supplementary files. Further, it would be possible to copy bibliographic entries between files and create project-specific bib-files for LaTeX use, without having a huge bibfile, of which the most part stays unused, and still have a consistent bib-key.\n As far as I can see Nicolas Rougier's org-bib-mode doesn't do that, but uses a corresponding bib-file.\n Do you know ways to achieve that or do you think it's a rather stupid idea, that brings a lot of hassle with it?\n Thank you!\n    submitted by    /u/Hero_D0t  \n [link]   [comments]",

However, I have taught myself Elisp and have gone down the rabbit hole of customizing Emacs extensively. \n It's my sense that the Emacs \"ecosystem\" is growing and innovating at a very healthy clip. The richness of ELPA, the frequency of new releases from the core developers, and the adoption of Emacs/Org in places like academia -- all these are examples.\n This appears to be happening in the world of professional coding too, despite very capable competitors like VS Code. Here's a recent quote from Jon Sander's blog, irreal.org: \"The fact — as evidenced by Org-mode and Magit — is that Emacs is at the forefront of editor/IDE development.\" \n Ponder that: \"at the forefront.\" \n I have no data on the actual number of Emacs users, or on the rate of production of new packages or counts of new lines of code, but it's my anecdotal sense that Emacs is modernizing and thriving. Not least, its reach is extending beyond the English-speaking world. \n Is this the golden age of Emacs? Was it ever better than now?\n    submitted by    /u/tdavey  \n [link]   [comments]",

Luckily projects are rarely nested, and not in the areas I work on. There is no discipline requiring file names be unique across projects, nor even within projects.

Each such directory must contain a suite_registration.cpp. \n Most often I work within a single project and want to navigate to files in the same project.

Unfortunately, there are ~400 siblings, though I very rarely visit more than 10. \n With recent attempts to work within Emacs' built-in tools, I wonder how I find files in this code base.

          "description": "I made a deep dive into Emacs, Orgmode, and Elisp in 2020 and migrated almost all of my writing, editing, and task-management tools to it. Spent a significant amount of time learning the ins and outs of it.\n At some point I was tempted by shiny tools like OmniFocus (a fantastic tool, no doubt), Nisus Writer, Roam Research, and some more.\n After some time I realized I have isolated islands of tools not inter-operating, and I have little to no control over these tools, at least not in a consistent way (JavaScript in Roam, Apple Script and JS in OmniFocus, etc).\n So again I came back to Emacs + Org two weeks ago, having left it for several months. Now, as if my mind has been digesting all the infos that I have accumulated the months before I left it, I suddenly feel like all pieces fall together, I am quickly hacking Emacs Lisp for my workflow automations, my fingers are flying over the keyboard (using Karabiner Elements and \"God Mode\" https://medium.com/@nikitavoloboev/karabiner-god-mode-7407a5ddc8f6) and I get sooo much more done in a way not possible by the other tools I used! Everything is connected to each other now: My writing, documenting, my task management, my text editing and every bit of a text tranformation. This is such a wonderful way to get things done.\n Thank you to all the maintainers of Emacs, Orgmode, and all the wonderful packages like ivy, counsel, org-ql, and many more!\n Also, I am very happy with this community, that has helped me get a better understanding of the ins and outs of Emacs and Elisp.\n    submitted by    /u/pragmat1c1  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello,\n Recently my Emacs got automatically updated from 27.1 to 28.1 (thanks Snap!) and oh boy am I regretting this.\n First, I had to re-install use-package because none of the packages seemed to work. Then I had to update all of the packages. Then Emacs almost took my system down with CPU usage because it was apparently recompiling packages without letting me know in either the messages or warnings buffers. Together with a bunch of stuff in between made this a fun adventure.\n Anyway, I'm lucky that people over at the Emacs Matrix room were able to help out, otherwise I'd be very much dead in the water. Especially considering my newness to Emacs.\n However, as the title says, there's still one issue remaining that irks me to no end. Emacs has lost the ability to collapse/expand headers of org-mode files. It could be a conflict between evil-mode and org-mode, but how do I tackle this? I have no idea.\n When I did C-h k <Tab> under an org file heading, I got this description:\n TAB (translated from <tab>) runs the command evil-jump-forward (found in evil-motion-state-map), which is an interactive native compiled Lisp function in ‘evil-commands.el’. It is bound to TAB. (evil-jump-forward &optional COUNT) Go to newer position in jump list. To go the other way, press C-o. \n I don't consider having a huge or complicated config, so I'm not sure why the breakage happened like it did. If you have suggestions for future-proofing my config so that above disasters don't happen (or at least the chance of them get minimized), then please do let me know. Here's my init.el\n Thanks in advance.\n Edit:\n Thanks to @yantar92:matrix.org I think I know the root cause: https://github.com/emacs-evil/evil/issues/1604 - Seems like Evil-mode is not yet fully adapted to work with Org-mode in Emacs v28.

I want to use format strings with custom expandos to represent points of key-value data (that is, I want to print a formatted string from a object which has keys and values, like a bibtex entry).\n Normally I could do this with format-spec, and associate certain keys in the original object with certain expando letters. But often the data I am formatting either has many fields (more than 26, so a format-spec gets unwieldy), or has a few core fields common to all data points, but could have any arbitrary fields beyond those (so it is impossible to assign expandos to all field names). Biblatex entries for example have a reference key, 133 defined field names, and facility for users to define and use whichever fields they want! Even expandos for a-z, A-Z and 0-9 wouldn't cover all that.\n On the assumption that the field names are always unique within a single object, a good solution to this might be somthing like format \"%(field-name-1) -- [%(field-name-2):%(field-name-3)]\", so as to print something like foo -- [a:b]. The idea is that the expando names (field-name-1, field-name-2, etc.) are programmatically checked against the entry (or against a list generated programatically from the entry), so there is no need for an explicit list of expandos like format-spec uses. I think I have seen a few packages do things like this before, but can't remember exactly where.\n Is there a standard way to do this?\n TIA!\n    submitted by    /u/Jack-o-tall-tales  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "This question might sound provocative but it isn't my intention. I'm genuinely curious why emacs has the concepts of \"major\" and \"minor\" modes. \n I'm no elisp guru but to me it seems that a minor mode can do everything a major mode can: they both have hooks, key bindings, custom variables, etc. The only real difference AFAIK is that major modes are mutually exclusive. And even the latter wouldn't be hard to implement for minor modes by adding something like a boolean variable is-mutually-exclusive or a parameter. Yet the separation increases code complexity by separating the two and adding little idiosyncrasies to each.\n Moreover, the distinction introduces undue cognitive overhead by having us think of a mode as being the \"main\" or \"most important\" one in any given context. Why is that? Why e.g. should I think of js-mode as being somehow more \"major\" than lsp-mode even though the latter is the main driver of my editing process? It feels like maybe major and minor modes were abstractions designed to guide the process of creating packages but nowadays I see that as doing more harm than good.\n So, why not treat them on an equal footing? Do away with major and minor, and just have modes. To me it would decrease code complexity and reduce the cognitive overhead. But I'm not the expert here so I'm really curious about what you think about all this.\n    submitted by    /u/M-x_  \n [link]   [comments]",

After looking around for a function that does that I couldn't find it, so I thought a good training might be to try to write it from sratch. I came up with:\n (defun inwit/replace-org-link-description (link new-description) (setq content-start-point (org-element-property :contents-begin link)) (setq content-end-point (org-element-property :contents-end link)) (setq len-thing-to-remove (- content-end-point content-start-point)) (setq len-thing-to-add (length new-description)) (setq offset-delta (- len-thing-to-add len-thing-to-remove)) (delete-region content-start-point content-end-point) (goto-char (+ content-start-point offset-delta)) (insert new-description) ) \n However, this doesn't quite work, especially if it is run sequentially over several links in a buffer, because the substitutions (both the deletions and the insertions) start missing the correct spots after the first replacement, which works fine. What is happening here? I know that delete-region leaves the point where it should, and I thought that also insert does place the point after the insertion. However, I don't see how sequential calls to this function in a map loop can miss the right spots after the first one. It's like the numbering of the positions in the buffer does not update with my substitutions.\n In other words, is there a way to update the buffer so the following calls to my function can refer to the actual positions of the already modified buffer? Or, am I missing the point and there is a much better way to approach this task?\n    submitted by    /u/inwit_  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Overview\n This is a new issue for me that started about a week ago.\n I started having issues with some git commands in when using magit and vterm recently. Specifically, git couldn't read my global config file. However, if I ran git from a non-Emacs terminal everything worked properly.\n I did a little research and learned that Emacs sets the following two environment vars:\n shell GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL=/dev/null GIT_CONFIG_NOSYSTEM=1 \n These settings make git ignore my global config. Hooray for a problem half solved! Now I need to figure out how to un-set these variables in an Magit-friendly way.\n What I've Tried\n  \nAfter unsetting these variable in a shell session in vterm I can use the git command again but magit is still broken. \n I also tried unsetting those environment vars in the script that I run to launch Doom but that didn't work.\n Finally, I also read in the FAQ that I should try exec-path-from-shell, which I am already using. I tried executing the exec-path-from-shell-initialize function interactively but that did not seem to help.\n  \nDoes anyone know how to configure magit to unset these variables?\n System Information\n  \nWSL 2\n Ubuntu 20.04\n Latest version of Doom (as of 4/4/22)\n Emacs 28.1\n  \n   submitted by    /u/tompurl  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi, one of the main challenges I have when writing elisp is that I can't use edebug effectively.\n I write python during the daytime, and as flawed as Python (and its debugger) is, I have managed to create a comfortable workflow with dap-mode:\n  \nSet a debug point\n Run the debugger until it hits the breakpoint.\n dap-hydra shows a bunch of useful keybinds\n dap-ui-repl pops up, which lets me interactively try out expressions, inspect variables, and more.\n  \nMeanwhile, the current state of my elisp debugging is:\n  \nedebug-defun and (optionally) set breakpoint. However, the breakpoint is not visible in the buffer, so it's easy to lose track of.\n Run the function until debugger stops the execution. At this point, a new keymap is introduced with binds I don't know, that overwrite many of my regular keybinds. They can be inspected with ?, it's just a bit... jarring to have half your keyboard change meaning.\n edebug-eval-expression can be used to open a minibuffer to evaluate expressions. It's kind of nice, but it's not a replacement for a proper window repl as it doesn't show history. I often want to evaluate an expression, and look at the result as I'm evaluating the next expression.\n  \nApparently ielm and running eval-defun is one way to get the workflow I want, but I'm having some issues there (probably related to my config). There is some discussion on it here: https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/36918/edebug-repl-ielm\n All of my issues can be solved, and I think ielm is the way to do it, but this just makes me wonder: How do experienced elisp programmers use edebug? It doesn't seem standard to rely on ielm.\n    submitted by    /u/ntwmbc  \n [link]   [comments]",

However, upon doing so, I received the following warning whenever Emacs attempted to compile any file:\n Warning (comp): C:\\Users\\<omitted>\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\\\libgccjit-554575/fake.s:4: Error: junk at end of line, first unrecognized character is `\"' Disable showing Disable logging Warning (comp): C:\\Users\\<omitted>\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\\\libgccjit-554575/fake.s:4: Error: file number less than one Disable showing Disable logging Warning (comp): c:\\emacs\\bin\\libgccjit-0.dll: error: error invoking gcc driver Disable showing Disable logging Warning (comp): <filename>: Error: Internal native compiler error failed to compile Disable showing Disable logging \n (Where <filename> is the name of each file Emacs attempted to compile, of course.)\n Curiously, when I launch Emacs from MSYS2 MinGW (64-bit), the errors disappear, and Emacs is successfully able to compile all files. What is going on here, and how may I fix it? All I know at this point is that the problem is probably unrelated to the dependencies to libgccjit.dll: using dumpbin libgccjit.dll /dependents revealed that Emacs’s bin folder already contains all dependencies of libgccjit.dll.\n    submitted by    /u/brdrcn  \n [link]   [comments]",

Reading the docs for org-startup-truncated, I expected this to make org mode respect the default.\n Does anyone know what might be causing this? \n I also noticed that the message shown after I run M-x toggle-truncate-lines seems to be backwards (i.e. it says that truncation has been enabled when it stops wrapping)\n Edit: I apparently had a hook that was enabling visual-line-mode in org mode, which was toggling truncate lines.

          "description": "Good evening!\n I recently installed lsp-mode for the Node TypeScript project (using ts-ls) I'm working on at the moment, mainly just because I wanted lsp-rename. The problem is, it only works within src: If I rename a variable, then all files in src get updated, but not in my test directory, tests.\n A lead: If I delete .lsp-session-v1, then open a file in the test dir, then start LSP (and thus import the project) from that buffer, then lsp-rename (on a file in src) will also affect that one file in the test directory, but not others. ~/.emacs.d/.lsp-session-v1 contains no mention of the test file or dir in this case. It also doesn't work any more if I restart Emacs after this.\n I thought lsp-workspace-folders-add sounded good, but it doesn't appear to do anything except make it so that the rename doesn't even work across the files in src any more either.\n Tried renaming test to tests, didn't work. The fact that it searches src even though .lsp-session-v1 only mentions the root directory indicates that it has some fixed folder mappings. Adding more of these would probably be the best solution. But how do I do this? I'm not very advanced with this package or Emacs in general.\n    submitted by    /u/LemongrabThree  \n [link]   [comments]",

Originally the Feynman technique involved with writing your thoughts, questions that you have and things that you learn in a notebook and review them later. Using a notebook is really inefficient to me coz it's hard for me to carry around one to take notes. I used to leave voice messages to myself via my phone and later on manually transcribe them and move them to an org file to organize them.\n Finally I spend a bit of time and created a bot that converts telegram (just because it was easier at the moment. Otherwise it would be easy enough to create backends for the bot to use matrix or whatever) voice messages to org-mode entries and store them in an org-file. It's trainable as well. So one can train it to be more precise. Therefore the more you use it the more precise it can get.It still is rough around the edges and I need to feature tune it, but it is usable and I use it all the time. I thought other people might have the same needs as I have so it might worth sharing.\n Heads up though, the bot is in golang (coz I wanted to finish it up fast, but I have plans to create a native Emacs module for it to replace the golang implementation)\n The repository is at: https://devheroes.codes/lxsameer/Orion\n Also it comes with a text to speech engine (Rigel dir in the same repo) as well that spins up a tcp server and reads out anything that it receives over the socket. This one is trainable as well. Since I use Emacs as my window manager (thank you folks who made EXWM) I wrote a simple client that reads any text that i want in any program for me. Refer to the read me for more info and you can find the elisp client at: https://devheroes.codes/FG42/FG42/src/branch/master/core/cubes/rigel/core.el\n Hope you find it useful and looking forward to your feedback :)\n    submitted by    /u/lxsameer  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Edit: I think I figured it out but I'm going to leave this in case it helps someone else. The \"dimness\" of the rendered face was coming from the italic property of the face (which is not set in the face customization). All italic strings just get dimmer with any TERM configuration that doesn't support italics (like xterm-256color or screen-256color). If I set $TERM to rxvt-unicode-256color, italics actually work!\n Due to issues with WSLg in Windows 11 (a long and disappointing story), I've switched back to using emacs in the terminal. Everything works as expected, except for a couple of face colors in Org Agenda.\n Though the attribute face sample in the customize facility looks correct, the actual face is always a dimmed version of that color (and that is how it appears in Org Agenda as well). This has the effect of making the text nearly illegible in most cases, and I refuse to choose an artificially bright color here because it appears correctly on other devices.\n I have cleared all other face attributes and still this odd issue persists. I've even inspected the face applied to the preview (\"sample\") text itself in customize and nothing seems out of the ordinary.\n Why is it not displaying the color that I have chosen??\n In this image, with foreground set to brightwhite, the face sample looks gray.\n In this image, with foreground set to color-82, the face sample look like a dark green.\n I've also fiddled with the color \"themes\" of my terminal, but those settings have no effect on Emacs, it seems that Emacs is displaying exactly the colors it wants to.\n Any ideas?\n    submitted by    /u/bakuretsu  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "There are at least two fundamental ways of reading email. The first, and the one I think is more common, is to open the inbox and choose an email to read from the list. Let's call it the random access method. The other method is to open an email, preferably the oldest unread one, and when you are done open the next one by pressing a \"next email\" button. Let's call it the linked list method. \n When I read email using the random access method I frequently ignore email I feel are annoying to deal with. I also get drained of energy by having to repeatedly choose which emails to read. The linked list method on the other hand side steps both issues: I only have to make the single decision to read email and then I read the entire inbox.\n This package was born from the realization that I like the linked list method, and that I would like to handle more things this way. So what el-secretario does is that it turns different sources (e.g. org-mode todo items or RSS feeds) into linked list-style inboxes. And it doesn't stop there, it can also link different lists together so that email, org-mode items and RSS feeds come under the same unified inbox.\n Package link: https://sr.ht/~zetagon/el-secretario/\n    submitted by    /u/Zetagone  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi all,\n It's been around a year since I jumped into Doom with no prior Emacs experience, so far I've become quite comfortable with using org mode (with evil) for writing reports.\n At this point I'm really interested in learning more about emacs, and possibly starting from scratch, as I've heard it's much better for learning than a pre-rolled config.\n Thing is, the few things that I've tried to do so far often ended up breaking my thesis setup, and I'm pretty hesitant to further experiment since \"I broke my text editor, so I didn't meet the deadline\" is really not a risk I want to take. \n My goal is to somehow have a separate vanilla emacs installation/configuration, that I can just tweak from scratch, but which is totally isolated from the installation/configuration that I use to write my thesis.\n What would be a good (important: foolproof) way to accomplish this?\n    submitted by    /u/manoftheking  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi All,\n I apologize for the possibly annoying question, but I'm struggling to get Emacs 28's nativecomp to work. There are plenty of guides/posts online about installing libgccjit with Homebrew to get it to work.\n But, I've been using MacPorts for a long time and really don't have any desire to use both MacPorts and Homebrew.\n When I install any of the usual suspect Emacs packages in MacPorts (emacs-app, emacs-mac-app, etc), I get the same issue when Emacs starts up: it floods the *Warnings* buffer with stuff like:\n  \nWarning (comp): collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status Disable showing Disable logging\n Warning (comp): libgccjit.so: error: error invoking gcc driver Disable showing Disable logging\n Warning (comp): /Applications/MacPorts/Emacs.app/Contents/Resources/lisp/outline.el.gz: Error: Internal native compiler error failed to compile Disable showing Disable logging\n  \nNow, this is totally normal when GCC and/or libgccjit are not present, and a web search of these errors will find several forums posts and bug reports, etc. The Homebrew crowd just installs some specific GCC package and all is well for them.\n I pretty quickly realized that macOS's clang is aliased (or soft-linked, or something- I didn't investigate) to gcc. So, I suspected that I needed to install the real GCC from MacPorts. Since my $PATH has my ports directory prepended, running gcc from a shell does in fact call the correct, true, GCC.\n However, I suspect that Emacs still doesn't see the correct GCC when it starts up. If you're familiar with macOS and Emacs, you might know what I'm talking about when I say that I do use the exec-path-from-shell Emacs package, but I assume that it does its thing too late in the start-up process to help me.\n Does anyone know a straight-forward way to either change the GCC path(s) for Emacs early enough to matter, or just some other way to get nativecomp working with only using stuff from MacPorts?\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/ragnese  \n [link]   [comments]",

I can click on any search result on it, view/edit the target file, while in the meantime the search panel doesn't disappear. But in counsel-ag, the bottom search panel disappears when I hit the Enter or Esc key on a search result.

To begin, I am not sure what the definition of 'completion' in the context of emacs is, so I am using the term quite vaguely. It is unfortunate, but is perhaps a good indication of where my emacs knowledge stands right now. \n I have figured out that packages like selectrum and vertico shape how minibuffer suggestions appear on the screen. From the vertico page, I then moved on to consult. My current understanding is that packages like ivy/helm/consult provide enhancements to emacs commands (and perhaps also introduce some new commands) for buffer selection, register selection etc., including algorithms and interfaces for showing sensible possible options for the minibuffer prompt. \n However, where I totally get lost is company. What does company do? I am experimenting with lsp-mode, and it suggests using company. Does company also do the same thing as consult? \n Any comments and suggestions like links to pages which explain this ecosystem would be awesome.\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/mmiri-ifuru  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "In the category \"things I wrote because I wanted them for my own use\", I released a pre-alpha of emacs-codeql\n CodeQL is GitHub's static analysis toolchain and its primary IDE support is targeted at VSCode, there also exists a neovim plugin which served as the primary inspiration for this package in terms of feature parity goals.\n emacs-codeql is fairly opinionated package that includes an emacs-tree-sitter based indentation and syntax highlighting mode for the QL language as well as a transient driven interface to interact with CodeQL databases, run partial or full queries, view ASTs, and other such activities. \n It provides a full xref backend for database archive source files and also works over TRAMP (2.5.x recommended). It comes with automagic point-synchronization between source file buffers and their AST buffers as well as a lot of other small quality-of-life features focused on making CodeQL query development a low-friction experience on emacs. \n For LSP support emacs-codeql recommends and cleanly integrates with eglot. It also depends on Projectile for project-root detection for eglot's new workspaceFolders initialization, which is required for the CodeQL language server to operate properly.\n Since the intersection between emacs users and emacs users that also use this one very specific static analysis toolchain is likely not that big, I don't expect this to be very popular. But I wanted to share it with the broader community to save someone else the hassle just in case.\n I'll be putting a lot of mileage on this package myself, so expect a pretty active feature churn in the coming months. As it stands emacs-codeql is ready to be used for most all general CodeQL use cases.\n    submitted by    /u/lispislife  \n [link]   [comments]",

What are compelling reasons NOT to use Evil in 2022? \n I actually have never tried it myself, but now isn't for a convincing reason -- I just built my muscle memory on vanilla bindings and a few years ago added God Mode and helpers like Transient, so my reasons are more momentum than actual recommendable wisdom. \n Is there a reason users, new and experienced, should decline to use Evil?\n EDIT I accidentally sparked the Holy War, which was not my intention. I should have explained where I was coming from with this. I have the opportunity to onboard college students to Emacs for work. It has been tempting to use one of the big dawg packages out there, Doom or Spacemacs, and I know that both of them use Evil. I have also had recommendations to use Evil pop up in discussions about ergonomics and my Planck keyboard. That bulk of recommendations are where the \"dominant popularity\" view came from.\n Perhaps I should have rephrased my question as to whether I should have my new developers use Evil bindings (a la one of the popular packages).\n Thanks for the bulk of the answers here; most have been insightful and useful data points.\n    submitted by    /u/WorldsEndless  \n [link]   [comments]",

And want to cultivate habit of it (my personal choice). I want to ask few question regarding how to achieve something that I am habituated to do with neovim + telescope? I am not trying to mimic but it is kind of ease of life improvement for me.\n  \nprojectile-find-file give me that bottom split window (hope window is correct term) to search file but I am missing fuzzy search, it is regex search by default. Can I make it fuzzy?\n C-x f gives me bottom split for find-file (like directory lookup) but again it is regex, is it possible to make it fuzzy. (if doesn't work that is fine, this is kind of curiosity question)\n In above both cases, projectile-find-file and C-x f how can I open file in vertical split of horizontal split directly. For example, in neovim + telescope I fuzzy find the file and pressing C+v or C+x would give me vertical and horizontal split respectively. Is it possible to achieve something like that behavior natively? I am open to use external packages as well.\n  \n​\n In .emacs.d config from purcell, there are some config regarding switch-to-buffer-other-window things but I not sure about it.\n (global-set-key [remap switch-to-buffer] 'consult-buffer) (global-set-key [remap switch-to-buffer-other-window] 'consult-buffer-other-window) (global-set-key [remap switch-to-buffer-other-frame] 'consult-buffer-other-frame) (global-set-key [remap goto-line] 'consult-goto-line) \n Any help would be great.

Has anyone been in the same situation? I started using emacs with version 26 so I'm not sure exactly what I'll be missing (other than the fact that certain packages already doesn't install, like use-package which I rely heavily on). Is there a way to build a newer emacs on this old CentOS?\n On my local machine I have to use Windows, but I can still install Emacs 28 so I'm trying to figure out how I could run emacs locally and use TRAMP or something else to edit and ideally also run things on the DSVM. Does this sound like a reasonable workflow? I'm new to TRAMP, but am trying to figure out the setup as we speak.\n To summarize:- Can I build a newer emacs than 24.3 for CentOS 7? I assume not as otherwise someone normally would have done it already (EDIT: MIght have been too fast to post https://justyn.io/til/compile-emacs-28-on-centos-7/)\n - Are there any obvious issue with the TRAMP workflow outlined above where only emacs is installed locally, but all libraries, Python etc. are installed on the virtual machine/remote that I'm SSH-ing into? Would something simple like running a python mode w/ LSP, Flycheck etc. where all the executables are also on the virtual machine work?\n    submitted by    /u/haakonhr  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi everyone,\n I have made an emacs package and I would appreciate any feedback.\n Its name is text-categories located here: https://github.com/Dspil/text-categories\n Its purpose is to make debugging easier, but it might have other use cases. It essentially introduces categories for text. Each character in the buffer belongs to a category. The user can change the current category and every character inserted from then on will belong to the new category. The user can store a category which deletes all of its characters but remembers their position so they can be restored later. A category can also be completely erased. Lastly, the categories can be visualized in a separate buffer and the user can navigate through them in this buffer.\n The main thing I use it for is adding all debugging extra code into a different category. I can switch to the main category and correct the bugs and when I am done, I can erase all the extra code as it all belongs to a different category.\n    submitted by    /u/pcorrectness  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Just tested out Emacs 29 on Arch today, and the pixel-scroll-precision-mode is really quite smooth! I'm very content with it until I noticed one big problem: \n If the scrolling doesn't stop exactly at full lines, that is, if the top of the frame is cutting the top half of some line, then as soon as the user starts editing with the cursor, the Emacs buffer will \"adjust\" itself such that the top of the frame is starting with a whole line, often through scrolling a few pixels up or down. This results in a visual jitter when the user is done scrolling (e.g. with the trackpad) and right after one starts using the keyboard to edit the text.\n I'm not sure if I've articulated the behavior clearly enough, but I'd love to know if others are facing the same issue, and whether there are workarounds for this. One potential solution that I could think of is to \"perform the pixel adjustment\" (if needed) right after the user \"stops\" scrolling. Because it's less distracting then than when the user starts typing.\n    submitted by    /u/yep808  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I have recently been playing around a bit with helm for my personal use and, though helm per se is absolutely great, i have found the lack of documentation to be extremely annoying. Now I get it, its open source etc. and just read the source code, but I have been unable to figure out quite a few things from the source.\n So, my first question: Can anybody point me towards some good helm documentation that is not the wiki(https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm/wiki), which is extremely lacking if you want to write your own sources instead of just using helm and that is not outdated (like this https://kitchingroup.cheme.cmu.edu/blog/2015/01/24/Anatomy-of-a-helm-source/).\n Then two more questions:\n  \nHow can you do multiple columns in a helm source? For example, helm-mini shows file size,name, absolute path etc., all in different columns.\n How can you show something, but not make it searchable. Say I have a special source for various user-defined commands, and I want to provide not only the name, but also a short description of it, or its keybindings etc, without including them in the filtering, like helm-M-x does.\n  \n​\n EDIT:Here the answer by the current helm maintainer (I think) -> https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm/discussions/2493 (Summary: Use :match-part to only match against parts of the options). Thanks a lot for the extremely fast answer. Also, there really needs to be a better helm documentation. It is such a great tool, but anything other than the most basic extensions requires you to dive into the source code/ask the maintainer, which is less than ideal, I think.\n    submitted by    /u/Kram33r  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hey r/emacs, long time Vim user here trying to make the switch to Emacs and get it to stick (this time). And one of the recommendations I've seen when it comes to successfully switching is to figure out your emacs workflow and patterns rather than trying to shove Vim into Emacs (evil-mode aside).\n One of the core parts of my Vim workflow was fuzzy finding a file (any file, anywhere) in a project. And I see that there's a way to get similar functionality with projectile or project.el. The problem I've found is on large projects it's too slow, and breaks my focus. But this got me thinking. I very rarely need to jump between many far flung regions of the project I'm working on. And actually, having to search through all files in the project (as quick as it may be) gets annoying in my Vim workflow where there are many files with the same or similar names. \n So instead, what I'm imagining would work well for me is to fuzzy search for all files in a sub directory of a project. I.e: in executing a custom project-find-file I would first get the option to find a subdir in the project, and then it would operate as regular project-find-file from that subdir.\n Being new to emacs/elisp are there any pointers for how to do this, I would imagine ideally with project.el? Or alternatively, how do you deal with navigating to files quickly (without breaking your focus/flow) in large projects with emacs?\n Thanks in advance! 🙏\n    submitted by    /u/joshleeb  \n [link]   [comments]",

Do you put the connections and links under a References header to separate in into different types of content?\nThe image below is an example of a note where I feel like I've managed to maintain the singular point of the note (what the concept of \"in process\" notes is in my system) fairly well but I can also see how paragraphs 2 and 3 could be seen as separate ideas to the main idea of the note. In that case, wouldn't it make sense to have that text appear as bullets under the Reference header?\nI know there's no one way to use a zettelkasten but your thoughts on the way of thinking about atomicity when linking would be helpful.\nTa!",

At a closer look, I find the whole content of a Zettel that wasn't linked to, spread 16 times thorough it. Unlike the other Zettels, the <!-- § --> part doesn't include its unique identifier. I checked my Zettelkasten to see if its unique identifier happened to be that of another Zettel, but it wasn't the case.

There is no restriction on the type of notes that a zettelkasten can contain.\nA wiki is a special kind of zettelkasten that only contains notes about objects. The links between notes are usually created automatically: a link is inserted whenever a term is mentioned that refers to an object on which there is a note in the wiki. A personal wiki would be a wiki on which only one person works, which is usually not intended for the public.\nIs that how other people use the terms as well? @ctietze's comment here suggests that that's not the case – curious as to what other people mean by it...",

As I understand it now, the best way to future-proof linking files is to enclose only the note ID in square brackets and put the title outside of it, instead of enclosing the whole title in brackets. I realize that by doing that I'm giving up easily linking whenever I go back to Obsidian, Zettlr, Bear or other note-taking apps, right? While this is of some concern to me, my main concern has to do with the seemingly immense work that would go into changing all the links in my Zettelkasten to this new format. I currently have around 700 notes and I don't even know how many links. To do this manually would take so much time and energy that I'm doubting if it's worth it. Does anyone maybe know of a way to do this efficiently, without having to manually change all the links?",

So I started to summarize one main aspect witch is important for a reader of Ahrens’ book to work with the Zettelkasten method. It’s the major workflow starting with filling the inbox till using the content of the growing slip-box to produce an output of higher value. I added the tools I’m using in this process and also the page numbers from the book as a reference for further reading and understanding the underlying method.\nYou are also working with Obsidian and Zettelkasten?

          "description": "Hey!\nFirst post here!\nI am newer to trying out note-taking within the set up the Archive and the Method as proposed on this website.\nAs I’m seeking to prioritize connections at the beginning, I’m seeing different opportunities. However, I’m finding it difficult in the prose. This makes establishing the connections difficult.\nFor example, today I was reading about deliberate  practice and how immediate feedback is necessary within the practice session. I thought about how I can make a connection to other notes within the archive. I had another note about failure as a teacher that came from my readings on Toyota and their leadership practices. However, I didn’t know a good way to write out a good connection.\nIf it would help for me to post the contents of those notes in here I’d be happy to.\nAny thoughts on how to do this naturally?",
