In the non-fp realm, I am a tech lead with a good amount of exp & industrial perspective. I'm still learning a lot in FP/Haskell (with the more advanced topics).\n As Erik, one of my favorite teacher used to say, \"you don't understand it deep enough until you start teaching it\". At the risk of being a cliché, I'm, ehem, starting a youtube channel:\n https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiaFQ7p683Dr-oXMdUGRLHA/videos\n The main idea of this channel is to teach FP/Haskell by analogy instead of first principle. I know it's controversial but I think this will help bring down the barrier to entry to the eco system. I believe in the idea of \"know one teach one\" and hope to get rid of the uncontrolled side effects in the world, one function at a time. I plan to upload every 2 weeks or so at this stage.\n I'm writing this to look for some initial help, particularly in the following areas.\n  \nI'm looking for people who comes from mainstream (non FP) language and are currently struggling with FP/Haskell to preview and/or suggest contents to ensure developer friendliness.\n I'm looking for people who uses FP in production and have a deep understanding of the topic to yell at me (in private) to ensure that I don't say the wrong thing and leading people down the wrong paths.\n  \nI'm after a handful of allies to start a micro community/learning group over email or discord. If this interests you, please drop me a comment here and/or send me a PM, specifying which group above you'd consider yourself to be in (newcomers or veterans), and I'll follow up.\n Toward a functional world!\n    submitted by    /u/thoaionline  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "For those of you who use VS Code and are interested in using Tailwind CSS in Haskell using Lucid I have figured out how to get the Tailwind extension working so that you get autocomplete and info tooltips. Here is a screenshot:\n https://imgur.com/a/EeN4vW9\n I would say that autocomplete is essential when authoring HTML with Tailwind because otherwise you have to keep referring to the cheat sheet, and if you make a typo or attempt a sizing that doesn't exist then there is no type safety to tell you.\n And info hovers are also useful for reading code because it shows you the actual CSS for each class (otherwise you again have to refer to the cheat sheet all the time or memorize all of the tailwind classes).\n Instructions:\n First install the tailwind extension for VS Code: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss\n Then you will need to create a tailwind.config.js file. You can use this:\n module.exports = { content: [\"./src/**/*.hs\"], theme: { extend: {}, }, plugins: [], }; \n In order for the VS Code extension to work, it seems that it needs a local/project install of tailwind and postcss, so you can run this:\n $ npm init $ npm install tailwindcss $ npm install postcss \n Finally, the crucial step: in your VS Code settings.json add these two settings to configure the extension:\n  \"tailwindCSS.includeLanguages\": { \"haskell\": \"html\" }, \"tailwindCSS.experimental.classRegex\": [ \"class_ \\\"([^\\\"]*)\" ], \n I believe that the above regex should also work if you are using blaze-html instead of Lucid (but I have not tested it).\n Good luck! \n Btw, here is an additional repo I found with info on Tailwind CSS in Haskell: https://github.com/obsidiansystems/obelisk-tailwind-example\n    submitted by    /u/bitconnor  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'd definitely appreciate if I could, say, dynamically compile and link these scripts for maximum performance, and have the scripting language just be Haskell. A core principal of this engine is that you may have multiple instances of a game being managed by the same process (for example, a server and client being run simultaneously, multiple servers, some of which might have different scripts, etc). A script could contain anything from a map file to a custom game mode, to say, admin commands, and I want these to have as much isolation from raw IO as I can.\n    submitted by    /u/VincyThePrincy  \n [link]   [comments]",

In Data.Vector a ton of functions is taking integer parameters, and I've checked only the analogs of functions from Data.List and they behave the same (indexing throws, while other functions have this \"wrap to 0\" behavior for negative values).\n Isn't it sweeping problems under the rug? Does this convention have other reason than historical one?\n On the related issue: what is the underflow and overflow semantics in (GHC) Haskell?\n    submitted by    /u/zarazek  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "One of the things that amazes me about Haskell is the rabbit holes I'm ceaselessly cascading down. For example, what I thought was an innocent question turned out to be my latest rabbit hole, i.e. apparently Haskell doesn't have real recursive types. Apparently, what I thought was a recursive type, e.g.\n data Peano = Zero | Succ Peano \n is not really a recursive type, although I'm not sure why. My previous question about what turned out to be the omega combinator brought up the true nature of Haskell recursive types and the mysterious newtype \"workaround\". So this talks about a real natural number recursive type (as does my previous question)\n MyNat = One :+: MyNat \n MyList a = One :+: (a :*: MyList a)\n I can't truly fathom what's being done/said here, e.g., no idea what is meant first paragraph in by a typed tagless-final interpreter. Simple blind acceptance, which is just hand-waving, isn't my style. And the logic programming course it references is, well, my latest rabbit hole. Can somebody give me some intro material to this whole issue of what really is a recursive type. This all started, BTW, with trying to understand what a type equation meant. Can you guess how many pdfs and web pages I've opened since then? Fazit: Somebody (me?) needs to pull all these threads together into one big Haskell-Omni textbook. The existing beginner texts are too handwavy, IMHO. There's a kiddie version of Haskell and a grownup's version. The kiddie version is pretty much useless, again, IMHO, unless it's to spur you on to the bigger stuff.\n    submitted by    /u/teilchen010  \n [link]   [comments]",

Then I waited for some time to forget everything and then I found that this puzzle is a bit more complex than I thought about it.\n So I decided to write some code (surely using Haskell) to solve it. And today I did it.\n Here is repository:\n https://github.com/DKurilo/crest-18-puzzle/\n But I have a question: is it possible to make it faster and not using so much memory?\n    submitted by    /u/YetAnotherChosenOne  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Sorry for the wall of text, but I've been reading a lot of guides and not really getting the answer I need. If anyone wants to help a complete newcomer, I could really use it.\n I've read some monad tutorials/lectures and I think I have a beginner's understanding. Basically what I took away was \"without unsafePerformIO, which you should not use, Monad types like M a can't be converted to a. Instead you compose your Monad functions with pure functions using operators like <$> or >>=.\" I also think I understand this distinction between \"pure\" and \"monad\" functions helps the haskell compiler be extremely cool.\n That sounds really good, but I'm having trouble understanding how to structure an application around this. I'm trying to teach myself Haskell by writing an interactive fiction game. So far I have an RPG-style dice roller written, but it's deterministic. I'm creating a seed from the system time inside of a do, using the <- operator. I then use (basically) randomRs (_,_) (mkStdGen seed). Because I used do and I wasn't sure what to do after that though, so I tried using unsafePerformIO and I'm almost certain this is why my dice roller rolls the same numbers every time.\n Do I have to make all my roll-processing functions and the entire skill system speak IO Int and pass up and down an updated stdGen? I am pretty sure the answer is \"no,\" since I can use bind to invoke pure functions. But if that's true, I'm not sure how to apply that while designing a whole application.\n I guess what I'm unsure of is how to structure something larger than a few functions around all of this. Does anyone have any favorite guides or wisdom about the big-picture structure of an application written in Haskell?\n    submitted by    /u/fdc_willard  \n [link]   [comments]",

To do so, I intend to prepare a minimal case that reproduces the issue on the compiler version that the GHC developers would most prefer. I'm having trouble doing that though:\n 1) Which is the GHC version that would be the most useful for GHC developers? 8.10.7, the one the majority of the users currently use (me included)? 9.2.1 which is the latest stable release? Or GHC HEAD? \n 2) Unless the answer to (1) above is GHC 8.10.7, what's the easiest way to obtain that GHC version, very preferably without polluting my system globally? I've built GHC HEAD using the great nix-shell provided by https://github.com/alpmestan/ghc.nix, which allowed me to build it without installing any system dependencies globally. But I can't figure out how to run the resulting GHC, I have ./inplace/bin/runghc which I can use to interpret .hs files and I have ./inplace/bin/ghc-stage2, but that one results in a billion linker errors when I try to compile anything. I've also tried installing GHC versions via ghcup, but that one also fails because I think I'm supposed to install some system dependencies, but I really don't like doing that if at all possible.\n It might be a good idea to update the report a bug page in the GHC wiki with this information. This subreddit is probably not the best place to ask these questions, but I'm also not sure where best to engage with the GHC developers.\n Thanks for any pointers!\n    submitted by    /u/enobayram  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello everyone, as a means to learn Haskell I've decided to write a very basic Web3 implementation in it, everything has been great so far but I'm having a really hard time trying to encode integers that are greater than 8 bytes because of the data types. I've come across some useful libraries but settled on using Data.Binary. Here's an example of something I want to do in Elixir:\n ```elixir\n This just gives you a 32 bytes representation of that number\n <<3214000000000000000000::signed-256>>\n  \n<<0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 174, 59,\n  \n53, 195, 127, 137, 120, 0, 0>>\n ```\n On Haskell I've tried and it works with smaller numbers (Whatever fits into Int64), but with bigger ones:\n ```haskell\n B64.encode $ BL.toStrict $ runPut $ putInt64be 3214000000000000000000\n <interactive>:61:48: warning: [-Woverflowed-literals]\n Literal 3214000000000000000000 is out of the Int range -9223372036854775808..9223372036854775807\n \"AAB4iX/DNTs=\"\n ```\n Which does not give me the correct representation since the value is out of bounds (I think the number it sticks with is 4266531174538018816 (maxBound :: Int64) rather than the one I passed)\n ​\n So, I wanted to ask, what are my options to encode these numbers in the same way I can do on the first Elixir example?

And even though there is a wide variety of lens packages (lens, optics, microlens, etc.) such a function is likely to work with most of them.\n This is all preamble to my actual question: how can a library do the same for streams? There are a number of streaming libraries out there (conduit, pipes, streaming, streamly, etc.) and a hypothetical library author would might like to provide streams or stream combinators to users that are compatible with as many of them as possible, but don't explicitly rely on those libraries.

I am nearly done: The graphics are rendered correctly, the levels are generated appropriately, the player responds to keyboard input, etc.\n As an extra, I want to be able to control the game with the Nintendo Switch joy cons. I have successfully connected the joy cons and I'm reading the input in the stepping function (6th argument of play - called periodically) instead of the event handling function (5th argument), as the latter only recognizes keyboard and mouse input. Here is an excerpt of what I'm doing in the step function, the full details of handleSwitch can be seen here (essentially read input if the buttons are pressed when the stepping function is called, interpret the input and update the scene).\n stepGame :: Float -> C.System' () stepGame dT = do ... ASTM.forkSys (Switch.handleSwitch dT) ... \n Unfortunately, the player may respond to the first few inputs but then the game crashes. I thought it was a race hazard so I wrapped handleSwitch in forkSys (creates a new thread for switch input) but the issue persists.\n Any ideas on what might be going wrong and how to fix this?

We have tests for lib now (with lib listed under test `dependencies:`), and exe depends on lib in the same way, but there is an aspect of the exe I'd like to test.\n I have tried to use `verbatim` in my package.yaml to get hpack to pass along `build-tool-depends`:, which should allow me to reference a `project:executable`. I do see it does include it at the bottom of that `test-suite` in the generated Cabal output, but I still get a `Could not find module` in the test file itself (what I am importing there is listed in the `executable` section `other-modules:`) when running `stack test`.\n I have also tried referencing the exe in the new test with `build-tools:`. It makes it into the cabal file, but without the project name prefix I originally included, and does not seem to help either.\n Any possible things I am missing or should try instead? It generates a cabal file with what I thought should work, but it does not seem to be exposing the module I am trying to import from exe in the test. Thanks so much! \n Versions: * Stack resolver: lts-18.15 * Cabal: Cabal-3.2.1.0 * Running on a M1 Mac 12.1 in a Rosetta terminal (should not be ARM related, as it builds/tests just fine without the above attempt, just giving for context)\n ==== QUOTE END ====\n Remark from me (u/Martinsos): We also read that one solution is to move all the exe code to the lib and then exe just becomes an extremely thin wrapper. However, I love having this separation between exe and lib, on one hand to make sure that lib doesn't in any way depend on exe, and also because external/hackage dependencies are nicely separated, so I would rather avoid that if there is a nicer way to do it.\n    submitted by    /u/Martinsos  \n [link]   [comments]",

So then i tried to cabal install gloss but it outputs the following error message:\n cabal: Missing dependency on a foreign library: * Missing (or bad) C library: GL This problem can usually be solved by installing the system package that provides this library (you may need the \"-dev\" version). If the library is already installed but in a non-standard location then you can use the flags --extra-include-dirs= and --extra-lib-dirs= to specify where it is.If the library file does exist, it may contain errors that are caught by the C compiler at the preprocessing stage. In this case you can re-run configure with the verbosity flag -v3 to see the error messages. cabal: Failed to build OpenGLRaw-3.3.4.1 (which is required by gloss-1.13.2.1). See the build log above for details. \n So naturally i tried to install the library with cabal, OpenGlRaw but that gave the same error message except the gloss part. I tried to find information about this library but couldn't find anything useful for me, I am using nixos but the error appears on a secondary computer with fedora as well. I have opengl installed through my NixOS configuration and i have tried several c compilers or other openGL packages.

          "description": "I've been going through the University of Finland MOOC course on haskell, and this example popped up:\n ​\n someLetters :: Gen String someLetters = do c <- elements \"xyzw\" n <- choose (1,10) return (replicate n c) *Examples.QuickCheck> sample someLetters \"yyyyyyyy\" \"zzzzzzzzz\" \"xxxxxxxxx\" \"yyyyyyy\" \"yyy\" \"ww\" \"xxxxxx\" \"yyy\" \"yyyyyyy\" \"xxxxxxxxxx\" \"y\" \n My question is how is this 'someletters' fn a pure fn? It will always return a List of strings, but the strings will always be different. If it was modified to pass in a starting string, it would still produce a list of random length strings, so the even if the parameter is the same, the results will be different almost all of the time.\n Or is it not a pure fn, and is it then fairly easy to write non-pure functions in Haskell?\n TIA\n ​\n    submitted by    /u/Mag_hockey  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "List comprehension is a very appealing feature in Haskell. It could support a form of non-deterministic computation. \n For example,\n  [[x,y] | x <- [0..2], y <- [10..12]] -- [[0,10],[0,11],[0,12], -- [1,10],[1,11],[1,12], -- [2,10],[2,11],[2,12]] \n However, this construct is too static. I mean that these two generators (x <- [0..2] and y <- [0..2]) are solidified in the code. If the number of generators is unknown (e.g. List of generators as input), there is no way to use the List comprehension gracefully. \n One way to solve the problem is using Traversable:\n  sequenceA [[0..2], [10..12]] -- [[0,10],[0,11],[0,12], -- [1,10],[1,11],[1,12], -- [2,10],[2,11],[2,12]] \n Now we have a List of generators. So far so good.\n The drawback of this approach is that it cannot handle the variables' references in a generator's body.\n For example, \n  [[x,y] | x <- [0..2], y <- [10*x..10*x+2]] \n We cannot represent [10*x..10*x+2] in sequenceA.\n Question:\n Is there any general way to do this job in Haskell? Maybe something like sequenceA, but can handle variables' references. Or do we have to write a small interpreter?\n Thanks\n  \nEdit:\n Some one possibly misunderstand my question.\n For example, if we just using List comprehension (or do-notation), how do we represent the following pattern in general way?\n ``` [[x1] | x1 <- [0..2]]\n [[x1,x2] | x1 <- [0..2], x2 <- [10x1..10x1+2]]\n [[x1,x2,x3] | x1 <- [0..2], x2 <- [10x1..10x1+2], x3 <- [100x2..100x2+2]]\n [[x1,x2,x3,x4] | x1 <- [0..2], x2 <- [10x1..10x1+2], x3 <- [100x2..100x2+2], x4 <- [1000x3..1000x3+2]]\n -- and so on ```\n It could be solved by code generation and interpreter pattern, but I hope a better way.

To demonstrate this, I took the http4s g8 template, set it up with Scala 3.1.0, added sbt native-image, started the nativeImageRunAgent and ran a single request against GET /joke. After stopping the server, the native-image run agent generated the reflective configs that are required for this path of execution. Comparing the generated Scala 2.13 with the Scala 3 configs yields a bloated version for Scala 3 that contains these additional rules:\n { \"name\":\"org.http4s.Header$Raw$\", \"fields\":[{\"name\":\"0bitmap$1\"}]} , { \"name…",

          "description": "So I see that Lightbend is investing heavily in Akka (and Akka Serverless). I also noticed the hype around Akka for .Net. However, my experience with Akka has been one of a somewhat struggle and I am curious to know if things have changed in the last few years.\n My (only) attempt with Akka was 3-4 years ago when I wrote a web-service based on it. I remember how some things that would have been trivial if carried out with Future/Cats-effect/ZIO required quite a lot of coding in Akka. Two examples that I can think of:\n Concurrent requests:\n Some requests to the service required gathering information from several different actors asynchronously before returning a response. This required me to follow the \"Aggregator Pattern\": Sending the requests to the relevant actors and then changing context to accumulate (and keep track of) the responses . If I wanted to add an optional timeout I also had to set a timer with a Timeout message and cancel it once all responses arrived. It felt to me like this could have been more easily carried out with a Future.sequence(...) (if timeout is not necessary) or with parTraverse(...)/foreachPar(...) (Cats-effect/ZIO) with an optional .timeout(...) setting.\n Asynchronous execution:\n I many cases I found out that some synchronous tasks took longer than I initially thought, hurting my actor's responsiveness. However - if I decided to make those tasks asynchronous I had to write a new actor specifically for them. Compare this with wrapping a synchronous piece of code with a Future/IO/ZIO and it seems like a lot of boiler-plate for a relatively-simple refactor.\n What's common to both of those cases is the sense that I had to personally take care of behaviors that could/should have been abstracted away for me... \n I was wondering if programming in Akka still feels so low-level...\n    submitted by    /u/TheOtherNoamC  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "This is a post introducing the new changes of Iron v1.2.0.\n What is Iron ?\n Iron is a type constraints (or type refinement) library for Scala 3. It uses Dotty's inline and opaque types to evaluate constraints at compile-time.\n Here is a simple example: ```scala def log(x: Double > 0d): Refined[Double] = x.map(Math.log)\n log(-1d) //Compile-time error ```\n Features of 1.2.0\n Release 1.2.0 brings two key features: an imperative-styled DSL and constraints relations/consequences.\n Imperative DSL\n Iron brings a new imperative-styled DSL directly inspired by Martin Odersky's Representing Monad with Capabilities (HOPE 2021).\n Here is the \"imperative\" form of our log(x) method presented above: scala def log(x: Double > 0d): Raw[Double] = refined { Math.log(x) }  In this example, x is automatically unboxed via an implicit conversion only available inside refined and Math.log(x) is automatically boxed into a new Constrained.\n Capabilities work for other kind of monads. If you want to use capabilities in your project, I highly suggest you to watch the talk linked above.\n Consequences\n A consequence has basically a definition analoguous to logical implication => (do not confuse it with Scala's functions). It is used to convert a Constrained value to another Constrained.\n While a default implementation exists for all conversions, this new typeclass allows you to define specific relations (like transitivity, reflexivity etc...) that have two major benefits: - Check some conversions at compile-time where (for example, we know that a constrained value A / B can't be converted to A / Not[B]). - Avoid unnecessary evaluations at runtime.\n Note that Consequences are not exclusive to mathematical/numerical values.\n That's all for this release. For further information, check the release on Github.\n Happy new year!\n    submitted by    /u/Il_totore  \n [link]   [comments]",

The JTMS stores a single context of which beliefs we might adopt; the ATMS tracks all of the various environments which might support the possible beliefs without contradiction. TMSes can guide search in reasoning engines, or can directly serve as models for program domains.\n The JTMS and ATMS code here are simple translations of F&dK's implementation, translated with minimal changes into Scala.

We can represent a list of numbers using List(1,2,3). So is list a kind ? Or is list a type constructor ?. we are not constructing any new type here using type constructor which is list or may be I really need to see from differ perspectives inorder to understand it. And moreover what is a higher kind Vs Kind. I’m learning advanced scala to understand how types and type level programming works . Please help me out understanding these words /vocabulary ?

To give you some context, I never professionally worked with Scala so I have a lot of assumptions which certainly aren't applicable.\n My first question would be about Tagless Final and ZIO. Because ZIO embeds its own Error type as ZIO[R, E, A], if using ZIO as a Tagless Final, it becomes possible to abstract and hide away one layer or Errors. So I have been trying to separate System errors from Business errors in the sake of having a Domain layer curated of error handling for the System errors.\n System error would be, what I qualify as lower level and environmental errors, as network connection drop, remote service being unreachable, etc. Business erro…",

          "description": "This is probably a super basic beginner question, but I'm struggling a bit to figure it out. I'm trying to make a simple web app to learn frontend development, and wanted some functionality supporting dropping files into the app, but I can't seem to figure out how to get the literal contents of the file dropped to send it over to Haskell. My Haskell server is set up with Servant, and the Purescript side with Payload, and I'm looking at the documentation for Web.File.File, but the types are all abstract, and I don't see how to get the actual contents of the file. I'm assuming it's stored as a Blob, but there aren't any functions for consuming blobs and Payload can't transmit them.\n So I thought maybe I need to use the Javascript FFI, and was looking at this page, but I see there are quite a few different ways to consume the files, and I'm not sure what the difference is, or what Purescript types they would translate to. I'm assuming the problem isn't actually super complex, but I'm just not quite sure what to try, as I seem to spend the majority of my development time trying to debug issues with the Haskell/Purescript sides communicating with one another, so I'm hoping someone might be able to point me in the right direction to avoid wasting any more.\n Basically I'm looking for something File -> ByteString, so that the server can save/retrieve the file for later, without knowing the Purescript equivalent of ByteString.\n Alternatively, I mostly intend to have both the server and application running on the same machine, so if I can get the full filepath then I can just transmit that, and have the server read the file directly, but I can only seem to get the filename, and some googling seems to suggest the directory simply isn't stored in a DragEvent.\n Is there any easy way to do what I'm trying?\n    submitted by    /u/ablygo  \n [link]   [comments]",

But there is one big thing im missing: \"dynamic aggregation\".\n In TiddlyWiki I can automatically query and format many information throughout the Wiki. Easy tasks like displaying a table of all D&D sessions is achievable with the column mode, but how about more complex aggreagations? For my studies, I created tiddlers for every subject including information for CP, semester, and category. In my overview, each semester is listed as seperate heading with the subjects being displayed by category as description lists and the CP summed up for each category. Please refer to the screenshot.\n In TiddlyWiki I can use filter expressions to select any tiddler (entry) from the wiki and extract data from it. This data can be transformed into arbitrary HTML, which is rendered when the article is visited. This query and transformation is done in the Wiki's own syntax, which is a part of the reason I wanted to switch to Emacs.\n How would I recreate this in OrgMode? I'm okay with having all information in one file and don't mind to learn elisp. What I would like to have is the information to be displayed inline (not in another buffer) and being able to use all or most of OrgModes usual formatting options.\n    submitted by    /u/neunzehnhundert97  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi, \n I'm currently writing up my PhD thesis using org-mode, and it is a joy in comparison to my past experiences writing raw LaTeX. \n I'm simultaneously attempting to write up some of the thesis chapters in paper form for publication, and have been creating the papers by selectively #+INCLUDE -ing the thesis chapter .org files. I very much dislike the idea of maintaining the same text in multiple files (fix a typo or re-word something in one, will I remember to propagate those changes throughout?), however the text required for the papers needs to be somewhat more concise than what appears in the thesis. So far I have handled this by having org files containing the core text for a section, which appears in both the thesis and the paper, and another org file that expands on the core and appears in the thesis only. \n This approach works well enough, but falls down when I want to interleave concise text and extended text. I could use the line number option for the include command to achieve this, however the text is changing too often for this to be practical. The natural conclusion seems to be to break things down even further, and to have separate org files per paragraph of text, and to construct larger documents out of these. \n Does anyone here have any experience of something like this (maybe there are packages which could help?), or perhaps better ideas (i.e. am I being a lunatic)?\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/ForsakenMachinery  \n [link]   [comments]",

The build for 28.0.90 took time as I was facing an issue (Bug#52376). \n This build enables native compilation. As it is not compiling all the .el files of Emacs ahead of time as of now, it will compile them as you start using Emacs. I plan to enable ahead of time compilation in the next build (Found that the 28.0.91 has just released, that will be the next build).\n Please give it a try, and let me know how the install/upgrade goes. If you face any issues, comment here or create an issue on the GitLab repository.\n How to install the pretest on Fedora\n ``` sudo dnf copr enable bhavin192/emacs-pretest sudo dnf update emacs \n or\n sudo dnf install emacs ```\n If you face any other issues, consider reporting them via M-x report-emacs-bug or respective package mailing list / bug tracking system.\n PS: I usually post about these pretest builds on Mastodon: - https://toots.dgplug.org/tags/emacs_pretest - https://toots.dgplug.org/@bhavin192\n    submitted by    /u/bhavin192  \n [link]   [comments]",

For functions which will potentially be used in multiple packages, using (with-)eval-after-load to defer their loading wouldn't really work, would it?\n What's your setup for this? I can only think of putting them all in the same file(s), generating the autoloads file for it (with update-file-autoloads), and then loading the generated file instead of the original. The problem with this is that it would then load all the functions in the file instead of only the requested one, wouldn't it? Also, I like to keep code tidy and those functions definitions make more sense if they are somewhere else in the code.\n Maybe I'm over-engineering my config. I was just wondering what would be the most optimal approach for this and what are you guys doing with your configs.\n Thanks a lot in advance!\n EDIT: I've specified more that I'm talking about my own defined code, not installed packages.\n    submitted by    /u/Desmesura  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi,\n Recently, I came up of an idea that we can practice natural language (for me, it's English) speaking using subtitle files, as they already have timestamps along with subtitle texts, so that we can loop over specific parts of a video file easily by taking advantage of those timestamps, instead of setting the start time and end time of the playback manually and then looping over it.\n And then I thought of a package, subed, which jumped into my eyes when I was wandering around Sacha Chua's blog (kudos to @sachac). And I found it was perfect for this idea after playing with it for ~10 minutes.\n Here are the steps: 1. Open a subtitle file, say foo.srt, subed will automatically open the accompany video file having the name foo.mp4/foo.mk4/foo.avi etc using mpv. 2. Then in the subtitle buffer, only these three key bindings will do the job: 1. C-c C-l toggles looping over the current subtitle By default, there is an extra second before and after the time span, as specified in the config subed-loop-seconds-before & subed-loop-seconds-after. 2. M-n moves the point to the next subtitle, and it automatically seek the playback to the corresponding timeline. 3. M-p moves the point to the previous subtitle and seek the playback to the right position of the timeline.\n Although the package is designed to be used to edit subtitles efficiently, it could also shine in language speaking/shadowing.\n If you're also learning foreign languages, I believe this workflow can help you.✌\n    submitted by    /u/whatacold  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "EDIT: After disabling the ligatures module in my doom emacs config altogether, turns out everything runs smooth again. While the auto-composition-mode is no longer guilty, my problem is still that ligatures have a very bad performance. I guess ligatures having bad performance in emacs are known, because they're mentioned in the doom FAQ.\n I recently installed emacs (doom) on a new manjaro installation and since I started using it I've been noticing that moving on a buffer and inserting text feels very laggy, and after a couple of minutes that becomes increasingly noticeable to the point where it's really hard to type, taking up to a couple of seconds to see the input being written on the screen.\n So I decided to investigate further into this, and tried disabling minor modes one by one, until I noticed the problem went away when I disabled the auto-composition-mode. I repeated the experiment disabling only that mode, just to be sure it wasn't because of some other mode that I failed to notice.\n I was wondering if there's something I could do about the performance of this mode. I know I could just disable it globally, but I would like to keep it enabled so the ligatures don't go away. I am using Fira Code.\n I'm using Emacs 29.0.5 (installed through the package emacs-git on AUR), with Harfbuzz.\n All help is very appreciated. Let me know if you need any more info.\n    submitted by    /u/JPYamamoto  \n [link]   [comments]",

It's not really an issue, but if that happens, I don't know if some real error happened or if it's just this.\n So I am wondering if somebody knows of any way how I could check if there are any changes to commit (whether there is any way of asking magit if there are any changes in git repository), so that I could run the commands only when there are some changes to commit.\n Code:\n (defun gitsync() \"synces git repository\" (interactive) (message \"Synchronizing git repository...\") (let ((default-directory \"/path/to/git/repo/\")) (magit-call-git \"add\" \"-A\" \".\") (magit-call-git \"commit\" \"-a\" \"-m\" \"\\\"commit msg\\\"\") (magit-call-git \"push\")) (message \"Synchronizing git repository... done\")) \n Edit: clarification\n    submitted by    /u/PureCryptographer584  \n [link]   [comments]",

Then I would ‏‏‎ like to create one note per title: - the name of the video becomes the file name - the note only contains a property #+Link: with link. Given that there are more than 800 videos, I would like to automate the process, but I do not know how to proceed. Could you please show me the way, and tell me how to create a script/macro in order to do it? I have started taking notes about my newly starting journey with the jazz guitar in org-roam, and I would like to be able to link my notes to the videos, and to search with deft. Any improvement /suggestions on the workflow is welcome! Thanks in advance for your help\n    submitted by    /u/trustingSalami7  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Phrasing a descriptive title was hard.\n I use ChkTeX as a flymake backend for checking my (La)TeX documents. ChkTeX is good, but sometimes gets things wrong (or makes suggestions which are not appropriate). Recognising this, it also reads a config file, and recognises certain magic comments, which can ignore warnings, or define new warning rules (it's a really amazing tool, check it out if you write TeX!).\n I recently had to write quite a few such magic comments, all in the same format, for ignoring different warnings (the comments are all very similar, just with a different diagnostic number in each). This quickly got boring, and this kind of programmatic text manipulation is exactly what emacs is good for. So I was about to write a set of functions like chktex-ignore-warning-at-pt and chktex-ignore-warning-at-pt-global (for writing to the config file).\n But then I thought that I can't be the first person to want to do this, and stuff like this (interacting with error information in configurable ways) surely can't be restricted to TeX. I thought there might something like a flymake-ignore-error-function variable, which I could set to my function, and there would be lots of flymake infrastructure for this -- but there isn't. Is there any such infrastructure already in emacs for interacting with errors in this way (ignoring, ignoring globally, finding docs etc. Of course, the specifics would have to be implemented in each specific backend)? I'm asking mostly because -- though it would be easy for me to just write my own functions and forget about it -- it seems like a useful general capability and if it doesn't exist yet, maybe it should? Would appreciate any thoughts.\n TIA.\n    submitted by    /u/Jack-o-tall-tales  \n [link]   [comments]",

With a little recent help from the emacs.stackexchange.com forum participants, I have written up a few Emacs functions to refresh the TD Ameritrade access token for its API, and to submit custom buy/sell orders for equities (although it could be for options trading too, but that's not my cup of tea). At some point in the future, I hope to write Lisp code to stream TDA data using the API and make trading decisions from within Emacs. For the near foreseeable future, however, I'll be relying upon watching the Thinkorswim desktop application to make decisions to buy/sell. Screen real estate is precious, as I need to see the charts, studies, order flow, etc.\n In a nutshell, I only need to tell Emacs: 50.35 RET and then perhaps 15 seconds later 51.25 RET. I have installed KeyboardMaestro, for systemwide keyboard shortcuts offering a variety of options, including executing scripts and so forth.\n I have two (2) Emacs options for order submission, either calling the curl executable, or running url-retrieve-synchronously.\n Any ideas regarding how to do this Emacs order entry quickly and save screen real estate would be greatly appreciated.\n BACKGROUND: There are certain custom orders available through TDA that cannot be executed programmatically from within Thinkorswim, but that should be possible through the API.

While I see the need to have a vertical display for functions and variable descriptions (marginalia ftw!), I have always been irritated by a new buffer appearing \"out of nowhere\" on the bottom of my screen, moving the modeline etc.\n So, I have adjusted the looks of mini-frame-mode to my liking. Now, there is one piece missing: whenever I push to my git repository, mini-frame-mode opens to prompt me for my git auth data. I don't want mini-frame-mode to handle this; instead, I want the password prompt to appear in the original mini buffer on the bottom.\n I know of the mini-frame-ignore-commands variable. However, I don't know which program is evoked by emacs to ask me for the password. I tried skimming the Messages Buffer for it, but adding magit-process-username-prompt and magit-process-password-prompt to the list didn't change anything, and I was unable to find a reference to another function in the packages' code.\n Thus: can you tell me which function emacs invokes to ask for auth data?\n Have a good day, folks :)\n    submitted by    /u/olivuser  \n [link]   [comments]",

Hopefully someone here knows what I am doing wrong.\n The situation: I am in my home directory. I want to add a note to the file ~/work/notes/todo.org.\n What I currently do: I enter \"wo C-j not C-j do <Enter>\", which is basically bash-style completion with C-j instead of the tab key and does not feel very helm-y.\n What the internet tells me to do: I have seen multiple posts of users claiming that I should be able to do this the helm way, e.g. entering \"todo\" first, then remembering the folder and narrowing with \"work\". However, this does not work for me. Even if I remove all my custom init settings, helm-find-files just doesn't do that.\n So what am I doing wrong? Is there a setting I need to enable?\n Other things I am aware of: I know there is also helm-find, but that a) is not fuzzy and b) takes upwards of 60 seconds (!) to find a file in my home directory even if I enter the complete file name, which is clearly not acceptable.There is also helm-projects-find-files, which seems to be for individual software projects and wants me to set up a project tree.\n I am aware that without some form of indexing, finding a file by name might just not be feasible. In that case, it would suffice if I could look for \"notes\", find nothing, then add a space and \"work\" and helm would be smart enough to expand those directories in reverse order.

          "description": "When I want to open a file, navigating a file system is probably the slowest. What usually works is looking in recently accessed files, be it recentf or just searching mini-buffer history.\n Finding file in a project usually works the best (Projectile), but it would probably work even better if it could just search the entire system.\n If I'm certain I have had this file open this session and haven't killed it yet, I can try switching between buffers (C-x b), but that usually only works on short trips and is rarely ergonomic.\n So if I'm not sure if the buffer is still alive, and if what I'm looking it belongs in the same project as what I'm looking for. recentf and history don't really land themselves well to exploratory navigation. \n What we're left with is find-file which looks and works amazingly with ivy, counsel, or even ido. But I often find myself frustrated, when changing a buffer takes more effort than you'd think it'd be necessary.\n Then I end up wishing I'd have mixed results, including recent files, input history, maybe project files, and so you could switch between them. ivy has different actions and that's cool, but can it change the data source on the fly?\n    submitted by    /u/CtrlAltCool  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I've been using Emacs for maybe six months now on both my Windows and Linux machines for all my programming, word processing, and personal organization. Couldn't be happier with my productivity, and the community is great! Tons of tutorials, terrific documentation on almost all the packages I need, and just generally cool, helpful folks. I've followed the community's advice on a whole lot of matters, including keybindings: I read people saying that CUA bindings would interfere with the bindings of many Emacs packages, that made sense to me, so I've learned and ingrained Emacs bindings into my brain. It's great! Until those terrible, dark times when...I need to leave Emacs.\n And discover that Emacs has trashed my muscle memory.\n Whenever I'm in a browser (can't use EWW for everything...right??), I find myself constantly closing tabs when I meant to cut text. I save files when I mean to search. If I use another app for long enough, I eventually do adapt back to CUA, but if I'm rapidly switching back-and-forth between Emacs and anything else, I start making mistakes the moment I relax into autopilot.\n How do y'all handle this? Do you extend Emacs bindings out to the rest of your system (and does that work across platforms)? Do you suck it up and tread carefully outside Emacs? What do you do when you face an app that can't be easily brought into the Emacs ecosystem?\n    submitted by    /u/chaiale  \n [link]   [comments]",

What were the barriers?\n And to those who have a better success rate than 0.00% at getting others to adopt Emacs, what is your secret?\n 1 What is even more bewildering, some of these programmers, who ended up choosing a different editor, have later told me that they wished that they could do with their editors the things that I can do with Emacs. (To hear them say such things one would think that they had had to settle for a less powerful editor, because Emacs had not been an option for them, somehow.)\n 2 My motivation here is not mere proselitism.

The only open source Linux alternative I've found is Braus, but I struggled to get it working. So, I let the matter drop - it wasn't important enough to me at the time. \n However, it's starting to feel a bit more necessary in Emacs (for me). My entire life is in org files - both personal and professional. I tend to use separate browsers for work and personal use, so I'd love if anyone has clever solutions for this every time I open a link in Emacs. I should add, there are also times when I just want to use eww if I'm just looking up some documentation or static content. \n I'm guessing I could either create some bindings for each browser function or I could manipulate the browser function to actually run a custom elisp function that opens a prompt.

For this, I've made an email account which has the sole purpose of receiving BCC of all emails I send, and so I subscribe to this SENT inbox to get those messages.\n \nI use the GCC field to store a local version of my email upon sending, which has the advantage of storing the BCC recipients that are omitted from my SENT emails (especially useful when I send an \"undisclosed recipients\" email).\n \nI wish to see things in both my Sent folder and in-thread in my usual inbox location. This is working except that I end up with duplicates of message I've sent. I expect one in my sent folder and another in my inbox, but I am receiving two in my inbox, and (gnus-summary-ignore-duplicates t) doesn't seem to make any noticeable difference, even though one of the messages I end up with in my inbox states \"this is a duplicate\".\n Any improvements or alternatives that meet the needs of synchronizing mail across machines, maintaining a \"sent\" box, and allowing email threading in my inbox?\n \n    submitted by    /u/WorldsEndless  \n [link]   [comments]",

This placeholder is nice, to see but i dont want it to affect my actual keyboard input because it is slower than my type speed.\n https://preview.redd.it/uqy54hfckx581.png?width=151&format=png&auto=webp&s=e233620cda49876c919470b09d6f8f4867205329\n EDIT: The issue did not seem to be related to the tooltip, nonetheless the answers below offer a perfectly good solution to replacing the tooltip with either nothing or the default company auto complete box (with only one suggestion). The problem was for some reason related to only typing the character \"t\" (for some reason) and the binding to (tab) i used to trigger auto complete in addition to enter (<return>). \n (define-key company-active-map (kbd \"tab\") #'company-complete-selection) \n This above was causing the character \"t\", when typed in the buffer while company was filtering, to somehow lose focus from the buffer and stop typing in it.\n (define-key company-active-map [tab] #'company-complete-selection) \n This however works fine, and tab also does what it is supposed to be doing - completing the marked suggestion. \n    submitted by    /u/asmodeus812  \n [link]   [comments]",

This package makes it possible to run, and interact, with shell commands that are run completely detached from Emacs. The name of the package comes from dtach, which is the program that makes this package possible. \n As a user you start shell commands in dedicated sessions using dtache. Here is a list of some of the features that these sessions offer:\n - The user have access to all of the output from a session\n - The user gets a notification when a session has finished\n - Sessions are automatically labeled success or failure\n - Sessions can be started on remote hosts\n - The user can easily rerun a session\n - Sessions can be opened in a compile mode, which effectively makes it mimics M-x compile\n For a more thorough walk through of the package, and how to use it, you can watch this video which I have created: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=if1W58SrClk\n And the package itself you can find at https://gitlab.com/niklaseklund/dtache\n    submitted by    /u/squirelpower  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "For a while I've been lurking on the development of cell-mode [1], an Emacs mode created by David O'Toole. The blurb says:\n  \nCell-mode is an object-oriented spreadsheet control for GNU Emacs. It provides a major mode for spreadsheet-based user interfaces; it can be further extended by defining application-specific Emacs Lisp minor modes which supply new cell and spreadsheet classes via Emacs’ included object system, EIEIO.\n  \nI decided to create this post because I am not sure how widely known this mode is, and I'd like to raise attention to it. Personally, I think it is an amazing idea - a magit or org-mode-like \"killer app\" for Emacs. It may sound like I'm exaggerating (and perhaps I am), but just off the top of my head I can think of a few really interesting use cases:\n  \nintegrate it with org-mode as a table editor. You could edit the table in cell-mode and then see the ascii representation.\n integrate it with modes such as SQL mode and the like, so that you could visualise the table output as a cell-mode spreadsheet.\n as just a plain old spreadsheet. Most of my use cases for excel would probably go away with it plus Emacs lisp.\n easy CSV (etc) editing.\n derived modes (see mosaic [2] by the same author).\n  \nI'm sure many more use cases would quickly emerge by integrating it with other modes. If you use cell-mode or know of similar modes in this space do let me know on the comments.\n Disclaimer: I have no affiliation with David O'Toole or cell-mode development, just a regular Emacs user.\n ​\n https://preview.redd.it/sfq42fmt8j581.png?width=760&format=png&auto=webp&s=276ef95ea7ecccc910ebca23905ba1bfc9a178fc\n [1] https://gitlab.com/dto/cell-mode \n [2] https://gitlab.com/dto/mosaic-el\n    submitted by    /u/marco_craveiro  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi, I am trying to play around with semantic highlighting in lsp, and what i was trying to do is properly highlight usages of a function's argument/parameter within a given scope (say, code block, function etc.), and not only at the declaration point. It seems that lsp does understand scopes, looking through the source i found out that faces such as lsp-face-highlight-write/read/textual - which do actually highlight the variable when i hover over it with the cursor. Now i am looking at doing the same but make it permanent, not only when you hover over the symbol. Trying to do that for both member variables and function argument variables. Lsp has lsp-face-semhl-member & lsp-face-semhl-parameter which are only coloured at the point of declaration.\n In the example below, crude, but member variables are purple, while the ones passed as function arguments are underlined-pink.

In particular I want my setup to support a relatively old version of emacs (26.3) which I can find or easily install on random machines.\n As a result, I'd like to upgrade my packages but only when they are compatible with this maximum allowed version of emacs itself.\n I can hit \"U\" in the package list to mark all packages which can be upgraded up to my current emacs version. What I do now is manually inspect the upgrade list, checking the dependencies of each marked package, and removing items which require a too advanced version of emacs. But this is cumbersome.\n Is there a command or a programmatic way to restrict this list to show only the upgrades which are compatible with the maximum allowed emacs version? I can't find any commands for this. I looked for package functions for querying a package's dependencies by package name, but it seems like most of the functions in package.el need a package-desc as input, and I'm not sure how to get that struct only from a package name and for available rather than installed versions.\n    submitted by    /u/algalgal  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "tl,dr\nI'm looking for an objective(-ish) measure of the one-thought-only measures. Any ideas?\na small background:\nRecently, I have been getting into learning programming, and I stumbled into Uncle Bob's lectures on clean coding (available on youtube, as of now). In there he outlines that there is this principle that a good function, is a function that does one thing, and does it well.\nHowever the one thing was up for interpretation. (for example It used to be a fuction that can fit into a screen. which is not really that well of a measure). He goes on to say that they came up with a good objective measure:  a function that no one can meaningfully extract another function from.\nIt seems like a very well solution for a definition problem.\nThe need for \"one thought\"\nThe same sort of definition problem is also present in the case of a zettel. Although assuming one thought per zettel might not be essential nor desireable for every type of zettelkasten, it can be useful for some, in order to make a synthesis of an unstructured body of knowledge and emerge with a structure.\nFor example, I might be trying to understand a school of though, this school may be offering argument A as a an argument for their belief.  However, argument A is made up of 5 parts, each part can be argued against, in seperate ways, and the arguments against may be challenged in different ways and so on. One might try to gather arguements againts and try to categorize them, summerize them, and essentially refactor them.  In this situation, if each zettel only contain one and only one thought, it would be much more of an elegant workflow to put them against each other.\nThe need for objectivity\nAn objective measure, can be extremely useful, in order to maintain the flow, and unload a cognitive load of \"is it too big or too small?\" \nThe matter\nWhat are your thoughts on this matter?",

He also seems to frequently produce high quality work (multiple best-selling books, consistent blog posts, articles for good publications, and a large number of academic papers).\nIn a recent podcast episode, Cal Newport made a distinction between proactive and reactive methods of information management.\nProactive information management attempts to takes information when first encountered and put it into some sort of knowledge management system (such as a Zettelkasten), maybe even before there is a specific \"need\" for it.  This information can then be retrieved at a later date, and new potentially novel connections can form between the information in the system.\nHe states his method of working is more reactive and project based, citing the overhead of inputting information to and maintaining such systems.\nReactive information management seems to be more on-demand and project based. When you are working on a particular project, you go out and find sources relevant to that article.\nHe also mentioned that over time (if you write enough) you will have been exposed to a lot of interesting ideas, and often when working on a project, a few potential starting points will come to mind which then you can follow to more relevant citations.\nhttps://overcast.fm/+b1V0JshqM/34:55\nOne question when using a reactive project based method is what projects to work on? This is where I can see the value of novel connections in a Zetellkasten in generating ideas.\nI'm curious what peoples' thoughts on this are?",

Looking at ideas for creating a tool for thinking, I came up with a tool that prompts me to refine the edits to zettel titles and 'summary relevance.'\nThis 'tool for thinking' results from a python program tied to Keyboard Maestro that prompts me to review titles and summaries of the last ten days of newly created zettel. As an anchor, it is tied to my practice of morning journaling. It reminds me and makes it convenient to examine each zettel title and the one-sentence 'relevance' statement to see if it makes sense and stands up to scrutiny. This is added to the bottom of that template. (pictured below) Automatic, easy peasy, the cognitive load of the initiating behavior habit off-loaded to the computer. This is not an excuse for not editing the body of each zettel. A new zettel will be on the list for ten days. That means ten opportunities for giving the zettel some love.\nI'm unsettled on the format. In its current form it is a bit hard to read. I will make changes for readability.\nIf you're interested in how this is done, have questions about my use-case, or just want to chat let me know.\nBelow are pictured titles and a one-sentence summary/meaning of the zettel I'm working on. These are the ideas I'm currently wrestling with. They represent a ten-day window of new zettel.\nThis is generated with nothing held back. I would love to talk to you about anything on this list.

It has the following characteristics:\nNotes are identified by unique, sequential numbers (0001, 0002 etc.).\nNotes may be linked using the wikilink syntax ([[0001]]).\nNotes may have \"parent\" and \"descendant\" notes; they may also be linked to project notes.\nBibliographical annotation is supported with BibTeX references.\nNotes may have tags (identified by #hashtags).\nNotes have a YAML(ish) frontmatter to keep metadata and are (preferably, but not necessarily) written in Markdown.\nThe aim of this project is to develop features to ease the creation, navigation and linking of notes in one or multiple note repositories.\nA sidebar functionality makes the minor-mode particularly useful for working with structure notes:\n\nOther functionalities include: creating descendant notes, integration with helm, helm-ag and helm-bibtex; \"killing\" and \"yanking\" to notes, searching for tags and backlinks; navigation commands for visiting the parent, following links.\nSome details of the implementation might be too personal, but the code may at least be useful as a starting point. I'm calling it a phi minor mode because this is how I named my system long ago.\nMore information and a setup guide are available on the GitHub project documentation.\nMerry Christmas! 🎄",

To make the series more whole, I thought to give you the chance to ask any questions you have.

          "description": "Greetings from Canada 🙂\nI was using nvAlt and Simplenote together for about 10 years and recently migrated to my own app, Hyperdraft, which I consider a web remake of Notational Velocity; my app is not based on files, but it supports markdown and you can own your data.\nI'm interested in the idea of 'turning your text notes into a website' and have been cultivating a digital garden / personal wiki for about a year now, inspired by Andy Matuschak; in the same place as my private notes, I have other ones that are 'public', and they appear as pages on this website (wiki links become public URLs).\nLearning about Zettelkasten over the last few years, it feels like I've been practicing it with todos and building projects, but not as much with 'knowledge'—my notes about the work of others 'slip away' because they are not interconnected and I don't put them in my note taking app. (I'm looking for an app that approximates manual sorting of index cards).\nThe 'searchable left-list' pattern is quite functional for me, and so I tend to incorporate it into all of my apps in some way. If you're interested to know more, check out my presentation called Wetware of writing and doing, where I also go into how I use Hyperdraft to make things happen.\nHope to hang out here more often as I have more to learn about Zettelkasten and maybe some apps to make 😉.",
