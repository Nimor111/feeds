That's all my experience with Haskell. And having experience working with Typescript, which has a lot of really cool typing features, I'm wondering if one can replicate them in Haskell. Specifically, my question is about type mappings and conditional types. In Typescript, one can define an interface (basically, a record type):\n ```ts interface Person { name: string; age: number; married: boolean; }\n interface Profile extends Person { friends: Array<Person>; job: { title: string; salary: number; onVacation: boolean; }; } ```\n And then it's possible to create a new type out of this one by recursively replacing all numbers and boolean with strings:\n ```ts // This type gets a type argument T and recursively replaces all its boolean and number fields with strings type AllStrings<T> = { [Key in keyof T]: T[Key] extends number ? string : T[Key] extends boolean ? string : AllStrings<T[Key]>; };\n function parseBadJSON(badJSON: AllStrings<Profile>): Profile { // mapping logic } ```\n Moreover, you can see record type inheritance with extends keyword.\n I had a task at my job where I needed to parse a JSON that stores all values as strings, and I needed to map it to a JSON with numbers and booleans, where they were supposed to be, so that's how I achieved the correct typings for my mapping function (parseBadJSON).

However, when I execute the b method with the input \" a\", it gets stuck in an endless loop.\n I suspect the issue has to do with the use of the \"many\" function in \"space\", which is causing the endless loop when b is executed.

I’ve never personally applied my Haskell knowledge after I graduated college or thought to.\n So this may seem like a dumb question, but I’m genuinely curious, what do all of you here use Haskell for in real life, not including for school/academics?\n    submitted by    /u/baker-blob  \n [link]   [comments]",

I had a really hard time setting everything up, but I think I finally have something that is somewhat working. I'm using a M1 Mac so I decided to install ghcup using brew. I then installed everything else haskell related using ghcup (stack, cabal, ghc, and hls). When I then started working on my assignment the code had some imports like Random and HUnit. So in order to get that to work I tried to install those using Cabal. At this point I noticed that I also needed llvm so I installed llvm@13 using brew and added the path to $PATH. I then did cabal install --lib random and it worked! However, I have found out that this is probably no the preferred way of using cabal and I wanted to switch to a stack project which leads me to my question.\n Is there a good way to remove this libraries that I installed? I have found that the files are installed in the .cabal/store/ghc-8.10.7. In this folder I have HUnt-1.6.2.0-18526221 and rndm-1.2.1.1-c70f7c08. Can I just remove those files? Or is there a better way to do it? I basically do not want random and HUnit to be installed for every Haskell projekt I'm working on moving forward. Some noteworthy things might be that when I do cabal list --installed they don't show, but I can compile the code without any issues.\n I hope I was able to explain my issue and appreciate any help I can get. If there are any issues with the way I installed llvm or haskell stuff that would also be extremely appreciated. It feels like I have spent way to much time on just setting stuff up and would need to start doing some actual programing...\n    submitted by    /u/Geeky_Swimmer  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Fourmolu is a formatter for Haskell source code. It is a fork of Ormolu, with upstream improvements continually merged.\n 0.12 comes with some pretty notable changes: * GHC 9.6 support * A new single-constraint-parens option for disabling the feature of adding parentheses to contexts with one constraint * A new column-limit option for breaking lines at a given length (as much as possible) * A new --print-defaults CLI flag for generating a default fourmolu.yaml config file\n With this release, we're also excited to announce a new website: https://fourmolu.github.io! The website contains a web app where you can paste in Haskell code, change configuration values, and see the result. It also contains docs for each of the configuration options with examples. As this is the first release of the web app, there are bound to be bugs and things that could be improved, so please write an issue for anything you find in the web app!\n    submitted by    /u/brandonchinn178  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "For my own reasons, I've come to use the di- prefix to mean half, in opposition to bi- meaning twice. This has affected me in that difunctor seems to be an older / alternative term with the same meaning as profunctor, as is evidenced by the Profunctor class itself:\n haskell class Profunctor p where dimap :: (a -> b) -> (c -> d) -> p b c -> p a d lmap :: (a -> b) -> p b c -> p a cw rmap :: (b -> c) -> p a b -> p a c \n It is actually quite awkward, this straddling of both pro- and di-. The type class name uses the pro- terminology (as in pre, and post), but the functions use the di-, l-, and r- terminology. This is unfortunate, as the Profunctor thus claims essential parts of both terminologies.\n For quite some time, I've actually thought of these in my head as promap, premap and postmap, as I have my own orthogonal use case for the di- nomenclature, having derived another dimap (and rmap, lmap) - but they clash in name with the existing profunctor functions, even though prodifunctor and prodimap in my nomenclature are actually sensible classes worth exploring. Privately I've been content with masking this, as I have alternative ways of deriving names, but I thought it was worth discussing with the community.\n What are your thoughts on the positives and consequences of changing the Profunctor nomenclature such that dimap = promap, lmap = premap, and rmap = postmap?\n    submitted by    /u/ApothecaLabs  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi community,\n as syntax is contentious a topic as ever, David (the main proposal author) and I would like to invite you to give your input on https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/pull/585, where we propose to change the syntax of the accepted proposal #522 introducing Or patterns. In particular, we'd like to know\n  \nWhether you like the syntax ((one of 1,2,3), 4) in the original proposal better than the amended one mirroring case of: (one of {1;2;3},4)\n \nWhether you like that it is subject to layout, similar to case of, e.g., \n f (one of 1 2 3) = 4\n Which looks kind of funny here, but perhaps has foreseen use cases.\n \nWhether you think it's good or bad to allow f (one of {}) (with layout just f (one of), even), and whether the semantics should be a strict match (mirroring case x of {}) or lazy (like case x of _ -> ...)\n \nIf you have experience with writing tools for GHC Haskell, whether mirroring case of syntax poses new problems for you, especially caused by it being subject to layout rules\n \n (Note that we understand that you might not like either syntax. That is fine, but the linked proposal thread is not the place to have that discussion. In all honesty, the syntactic appearance is not why we like Or patterns, rather the opposite.)\n Thank you!\n    submitted by    /u/sgraf812  \n [link]   [comments]",

I picked up python initially so I could \"show off\" to one of my friends, but I ended up getting hooked on writing C until about halfway through last year, in which I started learning Haskell. I'm firmly convinced that I won't leave Haskell anytime soon, as everything just feels superior to how I was doing stuff before, even if it was harder initially (and still, to a certain extent.) I want to eventually work in I.T, but I'm unsure of the availability of Haskell developer entry positions for once I could actually fathom getting a job working as a developer. I know I'm young and not locked into using any 1 language / stack, but I'm still kind of just wondering what I should consider doing for the future?

I had done this previously using hasql as can be seen here, which is quite ugly but did the trick.\n I can think of three approaches with persistent, one is to do something analogous to what I'm doing above: write the tags, collecting the ids and names in a mapping, do the same with the venues, then stitch all this together when inserting the events. This one I do not know how to do with persistent. The other would be to process the events one at a time, inserting the tags, then fetching them again, doing the same with the venue, and then inserting the event. This one I think I know how to do with persistent. The final one would be to write it all as raw sql and process it that way, which I'm really not fond of as an idea (and haven't looked into).\n Any pointers / help would be much appreciated.\n    submitted by    /u/gtf21  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi all. Long time lurker here but first time poster.\n I thought this community might be interested in my dissertation. It’s an evaluation of effect systems / design patterns in pure functional languages, from first principles. It operates at the intersection of the academic literature and real world software development. Haskell was the most obvious language for this task, so I used a small program involving four key effects: environment, state, errors and I/O.\n A lot of my time was spent trying to understand the history of the domain and drawing out the most important criteria for working programmers. In the end I settled on: expressiveness, modularity, extensibility, ergonomics and performance. These are the basis for the comparison.\n I don’t expect anyone to have the time to read the whole thing, so this post summarises some of the key take aways: https://www.dantb.dev/posts/dissertation\n I also compiled a list of my favourite resources (there should be a few familiar names from this subreddit… 🙂): https://www.dantb.dev/posts/effects-bibliography\n This evaluation may be useful for people wanting to understand the trade offs involved in selecting tools and techniques in pure functional languages. This was one of my personal goals for the project, as someone who has used pure FP in Scala for several years but never went deep on the theory before. I saw a bit of a gap in the literature regarding the application of these design patterns from the perspective of a software developer, which is what I’m most interested in.\n The structure is broadly chronological and a lot of it is probably old news for experienced Haskellers. With that in mind, I'd highlight Chapter 7 which contrasts extensible effects with the earlier approaches.\n Comments are open 🙂\n Dan\n    submitted by    /u/dantb  \n [link]   [comments]",

Many of the formulas are what you would expect like:\n sin (x:+y) = sin x * cosh y :+ cos x * sinh y \n But the instances make no sense at all:\n instance Monad Complex where a :+ b >>= f = realPart (f a) :+ imagPart (f b) instance Applicative Complex where pure a = a :+ a f :+ g <*> a :+ b = f a :+ g b \n I'm not seeing how the bind definition works at all. f is going to return a real and complex number when applied to both a and b so you are going to have to scramble. Moreover unless f is linear there is no reason to believe that f(a +ib) = f(a) + i*f(b). It would seem to me a much more reasonable assumption would be to use numerical methods and compute a Taylor expansion for real a and then extend to b. That's still highly questionable but at least don't fail for functions as simple as f x = x^2. Similarly the definition for pure makes no sense at all.\n Haskell normally doesn't get obvious math wrong so I'm assuming the fault lies with me.

I think the issue is that it's light. Not just verbose, but lacking in substance. Since it isn't entirely vapid and having paid money for it, I will finish the book. It's just anemic. And the capstone projects are fun.\n Two books which worked well for me are Manning's The Joy of Clojure 2nd Ed. and PragProg's Programming Clojure 3rd Ed. This is of particular significance since at least 90% of the first seven chapters of The Joy of Clojure are redundant with Programming Clojure, which I read first. I feel like I'm getting less from reading Get Programming with Haskell than I did reading content I had already covered in another book. The content just isn't there.\n (Also, it's worth noting that the code examples are kind of crappy. I'm finding myself refactoring this \"expert's\" code because it's ugly and horribly redundant. One thing I like about Haskell is that it's beautiful, with minimal boilerplate, and code I write in Haskell looks great to me. I don't like looking at unsightly code, and his code is mostly that. But for the sake of learning, I can look beyond that.)\n So, with this in mind, what might /r/Haskell recommend as a second Haskell book?\n Edit: I should probably mention (admit?) that I am not a programmer, and if you exclude my Numerical Analysis textbook from grad school, those two Clojure books are the only programming books I've read. I have been programming at some level for decades, but I don't have a typical CompSci background.

          "description": "Recently I've asked myself how much of linear logic can be done in linear Haskell. I'm pretty sure that pure Linear Haskell isn't enough. Let's define:\n type Not a = a %1 -> () \n This is the type of \"obligations for an a\" or \"slots for an a\". I don't think that there's a way to implement Not (Not a) %1 -> a, which is a requirement for linear logic. But looking through the linear-base library I found the following function:\n alloc :: Int -> (DArray a %1 -> ()) %1 -> Vector a \n In other words: \"Give me a way to fill an array with n elements and I'll give you an array with n elements\". This means that alloc 1 is already what we want!!! linear-base (maybe accidentally?) implies all of linear logic. Of course it's a bit cheaty, alloc uses unsafeDupablePerformIO internally, but if the linear-base authors have decided that it's fine I'm okay with it.\n I wrote up some basics of linear logic in Haskell (over here). Using double negation you can implement both of the missing monoidal operations (& and ⅋/Par, the other two already exist: ⊗=(,) ⊕=Either) and interpreting Ur as ! also gives you ?. I've also done some laws including (iso-)mix and both exponential isomorphisms.\n I think it's a bit surprising that it's actually doable. I would have expected that it's either already done or deliberately impossible. But I haven't found anyone talking about doing it, the closest is this library by Edward Kmett which uses some magic to embed linear logic inside of linear Haskell. Unlike this approach I don't think it gives you linear logic for all of LinHask, but only for some types.\n    submitted by    /u/ant-arctica  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi all,\n I was wondering a while ago how Haskell \"decides\" if a given recursive type definition should be given by the least or greatest fixed point. In particular, for a given type equation there are two canonical solutions given by the least and greatest fixed point respectively. But certain types \"feel\" more like one than the other. For example, lists or Peano numerals \"feel\" like least fixed points, whereas streams \"feel\" like greatest fixed points (and in fact the LFP solution is just the empty type, ignoring bottom). So then how does Haskell decide which form to take if the user never specifies?\n So this got me thinking: are Haskell recursive datatypes always given by greatest fixed points? This does seem to make sense mathematically, as for example gfp X. (1 + X) would give the naturals plus a point at infinity, and this translates in Haskell to\n data Nat = Z | S Nat zero = Z one = S Z two = S (S Z) ... inf = S inf \n (i.e. we can implement a term representing an infinite stack of successors)\n So is this actually the case? Does Haskell justify recursive datatypes by greatest fixed points? Or maybe does it not really care about any mathematical justification (i.e. you just get what you get by making a tagged union and putting pointers to the right types)?\n    submitted by    /u/AccomplishedAd3790  \n [link]   [comments]",

The \"Learn you a Haskell for Great Good!\" didn't quite resonate with me, so open to suggestions!\n    submitted by    /u/ksasaki83  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "This Release Candidate version of Indigo (a Scala 3 pixel art 2D game engine for Scala.js) is the result of six months work and will hopefully become a full release after undergoing a bit more testing. Feel free to take it for a spin! 🚀\n It contains a good number of general improvements that are based on real usage during the production of our biggest demo to date, hopefully coming soon-ish!\n The main bulk of the work is a total replacement of all GLSL based shaders in favour of programs written using Ultraviolet. Ultraviolet is a Scala 3 shader program writing library that is currently aimed at WebGL + GLSL. The purpose of this work is to begin to separate Indigo from Scala.js and WebGL, so that the project can look at supporting other rendering technologies (WebGPU is the next likely target), and one day, other platforms like the JVM and/or Native. Custom GLSL shaders will still be supported for the for the foreseeable future, but existing shaders will require very minor modification to be compatible.\n Indigo's website is slowly going through a necessary rebuild, so for now it's advisable to check out the release notes below if you decide to try this version out. Alternatively, do come and say hello on our Discord server if you need any help, or even just to show off what you're making. 😁\n https://github.com/PurpleKingdomGames/indigo/releases/tag/v0.15.0-RC1\n    submitted by    /u/davesmith00000  \n [link]   [comments]",

Is it the ugly red-headed step-child nobody wants to see or hear?\n I watched some videos on Scala-Native and saw that the Java libraries which are used to some extent by Scala for the JVM are NOT usable for Scala-Native. Does this mean some parts of them have to be rewritten in Scala? how else might their use in the JVM world be replaced for the Native world?\n Is this a project new people can join? I'd love to see some good compiler writers join the project to get it moving along quicker.\n    submitted by    /u/MarkHathaway1  \n [link]   [comments]",

I created it because I've been a Scala Engineer for the past 10 years and it's always been a pain finding jobs that actually use Scala. \n An example of why it's a pain: LinkedIn claims to have 30,000+ Scala jobs, but you click on most of them and they say \"Requires experience with languages like Python C#, C++, Java, Javascript, Rust, Go, Scala, or Kotlin\". They just use Scala as a keyword, and you'll never actually use Scala in that job.\n With FairJoin I review every job posting to ensure it has a high likelihood of actually using Scala. It's early stages, but some of the next features I plan on adding are filters for things like location and Scala specific attributes (i.e. Functional, Akka, Cats, Data Engineering), as well as more company info.\n ​\n I hope it's useful, and I'd love to hear your thoughts either here or email me at stephen@fairjoin.com\n    submitted by    /u/FairJoin  \n [link]   [comments]",

Its Android app was probably the biggest Scala project on Android in the world. I worked on it for five years, and extracting a small part of it to a separate library was one of the nicest and most productive tasks I remember from those days :)\n I released Signals3 1.0.0 two months ago. It was a direct rewrite of the old version from Scala 2.11 to Scala 3 (hence the name). The whole thing is an implementation of the observer pattern and in Wire, it helped a lot to connect different parts of the app, made it react quickly to events, and made the code pretty and readable.\n Say, you sent a request to t…",

Here's the code I have so far:\n object CSVImport extends App: println(\"Running CSVImport\") def run(path: String) /* : Array[String] */ = val bufferedSource = io.Source.fromResource(path) //val outputArr = new Array[String](5) for line <- bufferedSource.getLines.drop(1) do val outputArr = line.split(\",\").map(_.trim) bufferedSource.close //outputArr \n I'm attempting to call it in Main:\n @main def Main() = val arrayOutput = CSVImport.run(csvPath) \n I've tried to make the Object Def output to an Array[String], however I've been struggling with making the output work. When I execute the code as-is with the extra bits commented out, I get a nice Scala array which I can call individual columns using println(s\"${flightData(1)}\"), but when I uncomment the extra code the output becomes a mess, I think due to the Array format being from java. I get the output [Ljava.lang.String;@35f983a6.\n My question is, is it possible to export the outputArr without converting it to a java format, so I can keep the legibility and pass it through to other functions? and if not, how can I format the gibberish output into something usable?\n    submitted by    /u/PikaXeD  \n [link]   [comments]",

Nowadays, if I ask it \"Why do sharks eat elephant eggs\" it doesn't tell me that sharks rarely get a chance to do so cause elephant eggs are so large and on land, but rather that elephants do not lay eggs.\n Today I decided to test it by asking how one would use Scala 3 macros to get the types of the inputs and outputs of a method. It had some decent suggestions to do that for someone that is new to macros, but a lot of its answer was false, suggesting people use something called QuotesContext, not recognizing properly what extension methods are available for the Symbol type, and worst of all, trying to splice Type values into an Expr.\n If they can manage to get chatgpt to actually tell the truth consistently (like saying \"I don't know how to do that\" rather than just lying) I think it will be a nice resource for discovering how to do stuff you don't currently know how to do.

I'm particularly interested in hearing how others utilize org-roam in their workflows.\n I've developed a system where I create index pages for each major subject. These org-roam files are tagged with :index: and usually left empty. \n For instance, if I were learning Python, I'd create three index pages: Python, Theory, and Examples, with the last two having backlinks for the first one.\n When I take notes related to a particular subject, I create a new note and insert a backlink to the corresponding index page. This way, when I need to find a specific note, I can simply visit one of the index pages and review its backlinks, instead of trying to remember what name i gave to the specific note.\n While this method has been somewhat effective for me, I'm wondering if there might be a more efficient or more organized way to approach this. I'd love to hear about any tips, tricks, or workflows you use in org-roam when learning new topics.\n Thanks\n    submitted by    /u/jenescript  \n [link]   [comments]",

When I put links in Org-mode files they appear normally, i.e. the whole [[/link][caption]] thing is hidden and I just see the caption with an underline, can click on it, etc.\n I also have my Emacs configured (somehow) to color characters overflowing my fill-column something jarring, and I usually use auto-fill-mode and have no problems with that.\n For example if I have fill-column set to 3 and have a line abcde, de will be colored to mark they're over the line limit.\n However, it seems that whatever's coloring my isn't taking into account what Org-mode does to hide links. So if I have a link [[/link][caption]] which has 18 characters in its raw form but only 7 (caption) are getting displayed, those 7 characters count as 18 characters towards the line limit!\n For example if I have fill-column set to 20 and have a line [[/link][caption]] foo, I expected to see no characters marked as over the limit because I'm seeing just caption foo, but in fact the final oo are marked as over the limit because in that regard it counts as a 22-character line.\n Sorry for the verbose explanation.

          "description": "I’m just getting started with org-mode in Emacs and am looking at options for keeping my org files in sync between computers — specifically, between two Macs. A complication is that on one of the Macs I am limited in what software I can install, for work-related reasons (for example, syncthing might not be an option, Dropbox is probably OK, as is iCloud Drive).\n It’s most important to me that the syncing should be robust, reliable, and secure. I’d like to have files sync automatically in the background, rather than having to trigger a sync manually before leaving one machine or starting on the other. Similarly, it would be good if I don’t have to remember to close all buffers before I leave a machine (i.e. if conflicts and simultaneous editing aren’t a problem, or at least that resolving conflicts doesn’t risk losing data). Also in terms of avoiding data loss, I’d like to be able to make backups of the files, ideally with versioning in case I need to go back and fix something.\n End-to-end encryption would be desirable if it’s cloud storage (which might make iCloud Drive preferable to Dropbox). Being able to sync to an iOS app like Beorg would be nice too, but is less important.\n However, one concern I have about iCloud (apart from some suggestions that it's not always reliable) is that it seems like you can’t always guarantee that all files are really stored locally on the Mac, rather than only in the cloud, even if you don’t select “optimize storage\" (see for example https://eclecticlight.co/2022/02/21/can-you-back-up-icloud-documents/ ). So, it seems that backup solutions aren’t guaranteed to be able to see and backup the files stored in there (if they happen to be online only). Otherwise, I’d be happy to do my own backups of the directory with something like rsync to my NAS.\n Are there any solutions that fit my wishlist, or am I being too demanding in what I’m looking for? Any pointers would be very welcome!\n    submitted by    /u/argopenguin  \n [link]   [comments]",

The book (Turabian) said the utility of a storyboard versus an outline, is that you can easily move information around. This made me think of org mode, which I already use productively for outlining. \n So I know it already can do the basic task of storyboarding as is. However, I was curious about whether org mode could display information more like a \"storyboard.\" Either horizontally or (maybe better for not having to scroll so much) tiling.\n I imagine this would work with the top level heading defining a card / unit and then units would be displayed horizontally or in a grid, rather than a vertical list.\n Is this something that already exists?\n    submitted by    /u/encomun  \n [link]   [comments]",

This allows for arbitrary categories to be easily defined, built and search through. Some use cases for it would be cheatsheet files, easily accessible notes on cli tools ... generally static notes.\n Org-lectures. Now this one, even though it shares quite a lot of elements with KLP (it was developed almost simultaneously) allows for the easy creation and management of courses and lectures files. By assigning a couple of keybindings and complementing it with a package like CDLatex or Yasnippets, a really fun workflow was created that allows me to take (in real time) lecture notes for my university courses.\n  \nFeel free to try them!\n P.S. My experience in writing packages is limited, so any feedback would be more than welcome (this is the reason why I decided to post here after all, :P).

This is very dynamic - I might want to suddenly have another column in the table (or remove it, or resize it), to add more information, or to not have something clutter the view.\n So far, it seems the agenda is very \"set in stone\", and I am going to be unable to do things on-the-fly. Only possible to spend time preparing a view, then use and re-use it.\n Is orgmode really this unflexible?\n    submitted by    /u/financier1337  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello\n I am using org-mode and org-attach via doom emacs. Whenever I have made notes and tried to attach something using either org-download-screenshot or org-download-clipboard, by default the heading has an \"ATTACH\" tag signifying that there is an attachment in this heading. Example shown below.\n ​\n https://preview.redd.it/dcx9pfdb9esa1.png?width=744&format=png&auto=webp&s=4b453b1d160882ee09624e84c5598ec222c5f3ec\n Now when I try to export this to GFM using pandoc, this is what it does\n ​\n https://preview.redd.it/2keyfcri9esa1.png?width=1110&format=png&auto=webp&s=57aa82093888ea635644fcedc5be3eaf376f21f4\n Essentially it exports the ATTACH tag out. I have a couple of questions.\n  \nWhat's the purpose behind the \"ATTACH\" tag? The reason I ask this is because I can easily set org-attach-auto-tag to nil and this tag is not attached and therefore not exported. But does it have other consequences that I might not be aware of. Reading the documentation, it doesn't appear so, but I am then left to wonder why this would be the default behavior.\n Is there a way to keep the org-attach-auto-tag to the default value of \"ATTACH\" but not have it exported. I tried setting the EXPORT_EXCLUDE_TAGS to ATTACH but then of course the whole content doesn't get exported.\n  \nThanks for your help.\n    submitted by    /u/CautiousCartoonist  \n [link]   [comments]",

An unfortunate mechanism that can't be turned off saves over your file with re-done spacing -- blank lines are added between headlines automatically, which isn't Org specification nor everyone's style. This clogs git, if you're using version control, with changes that are just whitespace. One may notice a toggle to turn off adding blank lines between headlines, but that just means turning blank lines off entirely, forgetting ones that you may have added. Fundamentally, as of now, Orgzly's parser doesn't try to remember the blank lines in your notes that you may have added with purpose.\n Metanote A newcomer, but it has stayed proprietary.\n  \nI have more hopes about are full-fledged Emacs with termux or Emacs on F-Droid.

I'd like to be able to change the bg/fg colors dynamically based on the current DOOM theme. \n I've successfully written a function that changes the XML data to the new bg/fg color of the xml in-place, and hooked it to doom-load-theme-hook. However, xenops still renders a new preview for the exact same text.\n For example, say i have a xenops LaTeX snippet \n \\(S^1\\) \n generated for the theme doom-zenburn.\n I can change the theme, and the XML file for the associated to the above snippet has its colors updated. In fact, if the preview is visible inline, and I change the theme, the preview changes its colors. This is expected behavior.\n However, when I enter the LaTeX snippet and exit it again, xenops regenerates the snippet for the new theme. Is there a way to prevent this? I don't want to generate new snippets per theme as this would take up unnecessary disk space and compute resources.\n My gut tells me it's not possible. Xenops seems to generate svgs with random names, but I'm not sure how it decides to choose which svg to show in-buffer.

One of the warnings was not to use docker-tramp anymore due to the built in tramp-container.el\n At a quick glance of the .el and errors it produces, I'm getting the feeling that was designed around local containers (Docker running locally with the Emacs), but not for a remote container\n For example, I use Tramp via multi-hop, so that I can ssh to a server where the containers are running, and run the docker ps and open a shell within the images _over there_\n So a bookmark would look something like:\n /ssh:[foo@someserver.com](mailto:foo@someserver.com)|docker:bar@container:/path/within/docker\n tramp-container.el looks like the same syntax (/docker) as docker-tramp, but I wonder if it only works locally?\n I'll have to try docker-tramp again and see if remote still works there, or am I out of luck on this astoundingly handy behaviour. (or perhaps a local docker daemon can reach out to remote docker daemons, or I can run some ssh tunnels to pretend local is remote, or something..)\n edit: Looks like I had a defcustom override for the docker tramp so it was using 'sudo docker' on the target very old system; so I added a override tramp-docker-program for the new module, but still no dice.

          "description": "A literate org mode document that tangles, using noweb an org file into a theme file is a nice way of organizing themes by the files and sections they customize instead of by the sections needed by the file. See: https://gitlab.com/stefan.koch.micro/dotfiles/-/blob/master/emacs/stefan-theme-tangle.org\n Details:\n I spent the weekend setting up my own color theme. What I did not like about how this is done is that the color theme file is broken into sections by the need of the functions to define it. What I wanted to do was to setup the theme organized by the mode or functionality. Since others sharing has helped me in the past, I thought I would share this with the community. (See: The Proximity Principle at https://kula.blog/posts/proximity_principle/)\n I had been using the following techniques anyway, so I was most of the way there:\n  \nUsed GNU Stow to manage my dotfiles (Brandon Invergo' Using GNU Stow to manage your dotfiles: https://brandon.invergo.net/news/2012-05-26-using-gnu-stow-to-manage-your-dotfiles.html\n Used literate config file using org-babel. This lets you write an org file with emacs lisp source code blocks that are saved to an .el file when it is tangled.) See Literate Programming here: https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/intro.html#literate-programming\n  \nBut, this still made me sequence the code in the sections that the theme file required. I did not want that. So noweb came to the rescue. Using noweb, you can have a source block that will include references to source blocks defined in other areas of the org file. This allowed me to organize the file the way I wanted to. The top of the file is the skeleton for the theme file with the sections defined, and the sections below each add to the theme section as they need.\n In case you missed it above, see https://gitlab.com/stefan.koch.micro/dotfiles/-/blob/master/emacs/stefan-theme-tangle.org for the full details.\n    submitted by    /u/StefanKochMicro  \n [link]   [comments]",

I suspect that many users have themselves customized that variable to put all backup files in a single directory, in which case they would also be affected.)\n If you use emacs/emacsclient as EDITOR and an external tool opens an unencrypted file containing some sensitive data in a directory on a tmpfs file-system, then the backup file would by default be created in the same directory, so it would not hit a disk and be discarded after a reboot.\n Note that this only affects you, if the visited file is not encrypted. So if you, for example, visit ~/.authsource.gpg, then the backup file is also encrypted, regardless of where it resides.\n Please update to release 1.3.0 or snapshot 20230420 and delete all files ~/.config/emacs/var/backup/!tmp!... and ~/.config/emacs/var/backup/!dev!shm!....\n This gets you back to how Emacs behaves by default.\n  \nThe default isn't so great either. No backups are created for files in /tmp, but for files in /dev/shm backups are created. To prevent that you would have to use a custom backup-enable-predicate function. (If you don't do that, then the backup files sticks around until a reboot, but at least then they get discarded.)\n  \nThis issue was discovered a day ago (https://lonely.town/@wasamasa/110227701055899570) and was reported an hour ago (https://github.com/emacscollective/no-littering/issues/200).\n In the future, please report security issues privately.\n    submitted by    /u/tarsius_  \n [link]   [comments]",

I thought of an elisp form at the top of the file which will act like a button by evaluating with eval-last-sexp command.\n I also wanted this refiling thing for the files in Dropbox. Every file would refile to a specific file.\n I couldn't create those elisp forms that will act like buttons easily. It was harder than i thought. I found org-refile function hard to work with programmatically. \n After wasting so much time about this problem, i found a rather simpler and maybe even intuitive solution.\n I add local variables to each org file. An org-refile-targets and org-archive-location variable for every file. This solution doesn't give a one click way to refile all headings to a file, but it does give a simpler and focused way to refile and archive headings to specific org-files. \n I found this solution very satisfying for my workflow.

I looked through the org manual, and found C-u C-u C-c C-x C-s (https://orgmode.org/manual/Moving-subtrees.html) that will archive items under these circumstances.

I'm generally very pleased with the results, but there is one issue I don't know how to resolve, even after reading the manual and trying various searches online. The issue is pretty simple: I don't seem to be able to get elpaca to load updates to any use-package expression after Emacs has started.\n For example, let's say I want to set the value of the user option org-hide-emphasis-markers to t in my config file. I then add (setq org-hide-emphasis-markers t) to the use-package section of org-mode:\n elisp (use-package org :demand t :config (setq org-hide-emphasis-markers t)) \n (Assume for simplicity that I have no other org-mode customizations.)\n To test the effects of this change, I run eval-last-sexp with point at the end of the macro. However, nothing happens: the new value is not set.\n I thought this may be related to the asynchronous nature of how elpaca handles packages. But evaluating (elpaca-process-queues) has no effect.\n Apologies if I'm missing something obvious.\n    submitted by    /u/Benthamite  \n [link]   [comments]",

Seeing that he was left org-mode for a new tool, discouraged me from using Emacs and building my own config. It also encouraged me to try Logseq, which is one of the most popular PKM tools alongside Obsidian.\n He says in the tweet:\n  \nIt gives me a lot of what I've used Emacs org-mode for in the past, but with a less fussy interface and less temptation to tinker. (Moving from a system best described as Big Bag of Google Docs, per topic or person.)\n  \nFor me, it was the opposite. I was never as productive as when I was used Emacs. Logseq out of box is very powerful in some aspects, especially in handling multimedia. For example, you can embed a YouTube video and take notes based on …",

I'm looking to migrate to vanilla emacs, and I thought I'd kick things off by asking you all for advice.\n I'm terrible at emacs, but I've been managing to limp along with it as my primary driver for a good number of years now. I used vim for many years, but then I switched to spacemacs for some time and moved on to doom a little while back. I absolutely love the idea of a modal space menu, and the evil integrations have been fantastic for me.\n BUT. Even though they're great projects, I'd really like to be done with things like spacemacs and doom. They've been a great way for me to see what's out there, but all the built-in customization makes it really hard for someone like me to understand where various behaviors are actually coming from, and at least a few times I've discovered that after much hair-pulling what I thought were plugin bugs were actually problems with the customization layers. I feel like I always end up stripping away as many of the customizations as possible.\n My use case is essentially solid support for C++, maybe some python and glsl, and that's pretty much it. I know eglot & clangd/ccls work well for the c++ part, which i feel covers quite a bit of what I need. With eglot and things like use-package becoming a part of emacs in 29, I'm really getting the itch to just build things up from vanilla emacs, so that I know exactly what is custom and what isn't.\n External things I know I'd like:\n  \nspacemacs-style menu (is this a package?)\n magit\n ranger for file browsing\n evil integration everywhere possible\n  \nWhat major headaches do people see lurking here if I'm keeping things pretty minimal?\n    submitted by    /u/bluuurk  \n [link]   [comments]",

[and I’m not looking for anything fancy - 95% of the time I’m just doing basic editing of a config file or README.txt]\n I could have sworn there exists a lightweight terminal editor compatible with emacs bindings included with macOS now and I can’t find any reference to it so thought I’d wave the white flag and post here!\n    submitted by    /u/udance4ever  \n [link]   [comments]",

A few months into it, people started talking about using straight.el instead of package.el, so I moved my configuration over to using straight.el. However, now people are saying package.el is the best option and that people should not really use straight.el anymore. I have had good experience with straight.el since some packages I like are not on melpa. Additionally, I have tried downloading and using emacs-29, and it seems to run into issues when using straight which makes me lean more towards using package.el unless there is some way to fix this. Which package manager should I use, and why (I have also heard about elpaca which seems to have nice UI and fixes some issues that straight has, so what about that versus straight and use-package)?\n    submitted by    /u/Far-Anywhere2876  \n [link]   [comments]",

But once in a while it gets \"wedged\", where the region doesn't deactivate properly after something that should deactivate it. As a concrete example, if I mark a region and hit delete, the region is removed, but not deactivated. So if I move the point, it expands the region again, leaving the mark where it was. And if I just start typing, I only get the last letter, as each letter replaces the previous. The only way I've found to fix this is to exit emacs and restart it.\n Ideally, I'd like to figure out what setting gets \"bumped\" that makes this happen, and prevent it. Failing that, a way to correct it short of not using TMM would be nice.

          "description": "Emacs 29 has got new startup options: --init-directory. Here is how you can use it (for those daredevils who build their own Emacs, until 29 is finalized):\n In your shell, clone those repo(s) you would like to test:\n git clone https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs git clone https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude git clone https://github.com/jkitchin/scimax \n You can now run your Emacs from command line in respective directory:\n emacs --init-directory=~/spacemacs& emacs --init-directory=~/prelude& emacs --init-directory=~/scimax& \n Easy. \n I actually never tried anyone's setup before, but always had on my to-do to actually try those (+ Doom, but Doom seems to require slightly more fiddling). As a small review: Spacemacs and Prelude worked out of the box without any issues. Scimax is a bit older, and for some reason, it choked a bit during the installation. I had to press C-g once or twice to get it going. Also, every time Emacs starts, it is chewing on something until I press C-g. I haven't investigated on what. But other than that, despite all the warnings during the package installation, it seems to work quite well. I am impressed with the amount of polish and integration all three has done. I can certainly recommend any, especially Scimax for those of you who are doing lots of org, org-babel and who write scientific articles and reports. Spacemacs seems to be the most polished of them the three, visually and technically, while Scimax seems to be actually most useful, especially if you are an academic.\n If you are new to Emacs and learning, it is not worth spending hours chasing packages and configuring stuff. Install Emacs, and you can be going solidly in less than five minutes with any of those three. Probably Doom to, but can't be just cloned and auto-installed via provided init.el as those three guys.\n    submitted by    /u/arthurno1  \n [link]   [comments]",

On the other hand I also find it somewhat overwhelming. The keymaps are very large, and comprise numerous tasks which could potentially be performed through Embark. As a result, unless the binding is already part of muscle memory, having to resort to the embark-verbose-indicator is a time consuming step, because the list is so long it feels like finding a binding in C-h m. True, C-h offers completion, but at this point I'm already wondering if it wouldn't have been faster doing the task without using Embark.\n So, it works very well for bindings I know by heart. Which are a few. For others, I can't help but feel I'd prefer to have less alternatives. Thus, I'm considering adopting a \"bottom-up\" approach to Embark. The idea would be drastically reducing the available Embark bindings, and then adding the ones for which I feel the need. The question is: is there a \"proper\" way to go about this? I don't think nuking embark-keymap-alist to just a few maps is the way to go, since the keymaps put the bindings in the proper context. But, on the other hand, going around disabling each binding seems tedious. So, any advice on this?\n    submitted by    /u/gusbrs  \n [link]   [comments]",

Looking back, I have switched notebooks/editors 6 times in the past ~15 years for various reasons, either because I switched OS or the old tool could no longer satisfy my needs; it's just not sustainable and migrating contents ended up being a headache every time.\n It's only been a week, but so far, I like to think that I have found a forever home with Emacs.\n Here are some questions I have. I looked through some of the old threads but couldn't find the answer I need. Any relevant info is appreciated.\n  \nWhat are some suggested options for syncing Org-mode files across different OS platforms, preferably E2E encrypted? One combination appears to be file sync client + Cryptomator, though unsure if that'd prove to be problematic in the long term.\n \nHow do people keep their configs consistent across platforms (also backing them up)? Let's say that I carry around a Linux-powered laptop, but at home I switch between Windows and macOS for different purposes; each of them may have slightly different configs that correspond to the platform.\n \nIs there a built-in cheatsheet of sort, or a toggle reference tool that can be customized, for a beginner to use as a reference while learning common keystrokes and commands? I have been killing by searching with apropos and then yanking to a separate org file; it works, just somewhat clunky.

Eslint comes inside a .zip file and it seems emacs was trying to use the program \"unzip\" to ... well, unzip it. I didn't have unzip installed. So there it goes, if anyone has a similar problem, try installing unzip.\n    submitted by    /u/Skeleton237  \n [link]   [comments]",

Like the screen I was looking at was utterly uninteresting.\n So I went back to windows for a while, using VS Code, a graphical git client and so on and strangely there I felt the opposite, like the graphical density with so much on the screen was almost overwhelming after months without all that graphical clutter. That faded over a week or two and I found myself adding a few non-Emacs apps with more graphical elements alongside Emacs to mix things up.\n This was quite strange, I learned to program using VT terminals and actually worked in places where my daily computer was a vax system with a VT terminal and never felt anything like this.\n I'm not intending this as a slight against Emacs, but I found it was interesting that my brain just started to shut down a little due to the lack of stimulating stuff on the screen. I was wondering if anyone else has had a similar experience? I know some of you guys pretty much live in Emacs 24/7, do you find it overwhelming to use a very graphical application after that? Or people who do the opposite and work in a graphically intensive environment a lot, do you find it relaxing, or boring, or have any other reaction to switching to Emacs (or any other plain text environment) afterwards?\n    submitted by    /u/nnomae  \n [link]   [comments]",

As my fingers dance across the keyboard, conjuring powerful Emacs incantations with ease, I find myself unable to enjoy the mundane GUIs and simple apps that litter the software landscape. 🧹🖱️\n You see, dear friends, Emacs has spoiled me with its boundless customization, incredible extensibility, and mind-bending keybindings. Now, I dread the moments when I must use the pedestrian applications my company forces upon me. Oh, how I long for the sweet embrace of Emacs in those dark hours! 💔🕰️\n In my despair, I turn to you, my fellow Emacs magicians, for camaraderie and counsel:\n  \nHow do you cope when the world demands you to use lesser tools? 🛠️😢\n Are there secret spells to imbue these uninspired apps with even a fraction of Emacs' power? 🔮✨\n Can we petition the powers that be to make Emacs the one true editor, unifying the world in a harmonious symphony of keystrokes? 🌍🎼\n  \nI eagerly await your wisdom and insights. In the meantime, I'll be huddled in the corner, clutching my Emacs manual like a treasured tome, dreaming of the day when all software is as magically magnificent as our beloved editor. 📖💭\n Yours in Emacs enchantment, 🧙‍♂️\n    submitted by    /u/Passeride  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "So I was just going through my older journal entries and found the following entry: \n  \nI do not think that AI is the right choice for a lot of our things if the underlying problem of freeing humans always remains. It makes more sense to me to be a part of a group where the focus is on freeing our time through removal of shackling of our time than to build AIs that feed the capitalist to extract more wealth from underpaying humans and from keeping them subjugated to 8 hour work days no matter how advanced the AI is. Eventually, the AI is going to be a prime worker for the capitalist than for the betterment of humanity. \n I refuse to be a part of this process and that is why I am choosing not to get into those domains in any which way. \n Emacs therefore remains my stronghold that I would like to curate and build my freedom from. If one cannot free themselves from 8 hour senselessness, then they can build stuff to free up time and work from home and do other more productive and happiness, mental peace bringing things. Productive here means that doing what I really want to do and doing it rather than producing as much value for the capitalist who would rather discard me if there was a more productive person or an AI.\n  \nThis reminded me about one of the prime reasons why I wanted to use Emacs - it's extensibility that enabled me to build shortcuts and workflows that help me with shaving off sufficient amount of time which I spent on repetitive tasks. The trick however is to not to be vocal about your efficiency to your bosses because the time saved will be used against you to staff you with more work whether you want it or not. \n Go use the time saved to spend with your loved ones, yourself, exercise, learn something, do nothing or even just calm and rest.

As you see, mine are boring and you are probably doing more interesting stuff.\nTypical of when I'm in class, my note take is slowed. More accurately, my refactoring of notes into atomic-sized notes has slowed. I will add as many words to my ZK, but each note is bigger. Because of the speed of the class, I don't feel I have time to refactor the notes I've captured from reading, say, \"Read Hot Epic.\" I keep all the ideas captured from the story in a single note, hoping to atomize the note sometime. In the meantime, I have all the ideas, and because of my search skills, the ideas are not lost.\n@Sascha's article Why the Single Note Matters is a real eye opener. Care and attention must be paid to each and every note. The effort in this practice is what is called zettelkasting. The rewards are a supportive ZK partner. If you consider this a downside, the downside is that this activity siows time. You will naturally slow down. In a non-pressure environment, this is a good thing. Not so sure it works in a classroom setting with a schedule to keep up with.\nI've started a list in my journal of projects to advance once I've completed the food writing seminar. That way, they can be off my mind and safely on a list. (Classic GTD principle)\nI'm reading - Fisher, M. F. K..

          "description": "Hi Zettlers,\nthis is a new idea of mine that I don't understand well yet:\nThe value of a position in chess consists of its probability of victory for the player. Moves are evaluated according to how they affect this probability of victory.\nWe can apply this to our thinking: knowledge-based value creation consists of enriching data, information, and pre-existing knowledge with value-giving properties. Value-giving properties include: Accuracy/Completeness, Reliability, and Usefulness.\nAn evaluation of thinking would look like this:1\nsymb.\n  designation\n  comment\n\n\n\n\n  !!\n  Brilliant\n  Best idea, not easy to find\n\n\n  !\n  Great\n  Thought changes the course of the debate\n\n\n  \n  Best move\n  Theoretically best thought\n\n\n  Excellent\n  Almost as good as best thought\n  \n\n\n  Good\n  All right\n  \n\n\n  …",

          "description": "How has your week been? What are your plans for the coming week? Tell us about the state of you zettelkasting journey.\nMy week has been busy with medical issues that prevented me from making many new notes. I feel good now. \nI got my first two essays back from the professor in my food writing class, and I feel good about them. I am of a different generation than everyone else in the class, including the instructor. There are a couple of writers in the class that seem to be able to write a first draft of a 'writing prompt exercise' that is far more polished than my 'shitty first drafts'. They are modeling a skill that I aspire to.\nWhile journaling this morning, I found a gem in an entry from one year ago today. It's very meta, and this is all very circular.\n\n  \nZettelkasting and journaling are like workouts. You have a busy day ahead. Why journal? Journaling is not just another task. At first, you stumble with form.  Like when you are a beginner at weight training, you struggle with repeatedly getting to the gym. You think it will help your physical health, but at first, you feel sore, tight, and tired, not at all the pinnacle of health. Eventually, if you stick with it, you might find a coach that helps with form, you might set up your environment so going to the gym feels natural, you might start to feel strength building, and you've started progressing on the climb to physical health.\nAll these weight training actions can be applied to zettelkasting and journaling. They train your mental health in the same way exercise trains your physical health. It's a slow process at first. You can't see the improvements day to day or even week to week. Improvement only comes with consistency.\n\n\nI think I'll move this gem from my journal to my ZK. I have a couple of relevant notes on the mental health benefits of journaling.\n\nMy seven day zettel production",

I'm doing a literature review as part of a phd, so academic level critique needed.  The referencing I can easily cite at the end of the note so that isn't a concern. Does one research paper produce many notes, how does one title these notes please?  Is it the concept or the book etc.  thank you\nZoe",

          "description": "Hi,  newbie here.  I'm not overly confident or comfortable with notion, have seen hypernotes that seems easier for me, however I've been using Notion for a while.  I like notion as I can directly link out to a google doc.  I've sort of constructed the page to use notion and files embedded as if it were scrivener.  I digress.  I am writing a phd.  I do a lot of literature reviews etc.\nMy question here is there really much value in having a tool that presents a map of notes as per obsidian.  If I build my zettelkasten in notion which is basically a relational database is this not sufficient.  I do really want to concentrate on writing.  As notion supports my writing very well the idea of having the zettel database in the same tool is appealing to me.\nAny thoughts please?\nthank you Zoe",

I work in split screen mode all the time (PDF left and The Archive right) and need to fold the Sidebar constantly to have more space so the writing doesn't look crammed. However, using the mouse to fold the Sidebar away is slow and cumbersome, and the keyboard shortcut is written as ^+command+S.  What key does ^ imply me to press? I cannot get the shortcut to work, which is very annoying and embarrassing at the same time.\nPlease help!",
