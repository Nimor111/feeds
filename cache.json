Most serialisation formats are something like that.\n Think of it as a \"serialisation/deserialisation\" description AST.\n Indeed I would think if I had such a structure, I would think I'd be able to define \"ToJSON\", \"FromJSON\" and \"ToSwagger\" instances from it, and perhaps others in the future. If I get them right once, then I can provide APIs/docs in different formats and know they'll be in sync for all serialisation/deserialisation formats.\n Has this idea been attempted in a library?

For example, I want to only accept years like 1923, 1924, 1926, or 1930.\n Currently, I can achieve this using the Refined type as follows:\n type SomeYear = Refined (Or (Or (EqualTo 1923) (EqualTo 1924)) (Or (EqualTo 1926) (EqualTo 1930))) Int \n However, as you can see, this approach can get tedious and verbose when working with a larger set of allowed years. I was hoping to define a helper type that would allow me to specify a type-level list of allowed years, like so:\n type SomeYear = OneOf '[1923, 1933, 1926, 1930, ...] \n But I'm stuck on how to implement the OneOf type.

My idea is:\n  \nThe expression itself is a (not proper) subexpression\n The first lambda body extends over all the remaining symbols (?) meaning that we have an abstraction of the form λa.

I have worked already with it on my university's computers but want to install it on my own to practice more. I hope this question isn't too obvious and makes sense, but I saw the command needed to install said it must be done by a non-root/non-admin user. I use the main user on my own computer so I have admin permissions and would prefer to just install it there for practicality. So my questions mainly are, am I understanding the requirement right? Will I have to switch users to install it? What would happen if I just do it on my regular main user session? Would appreciate it if anyone can help. Thank you!\n For reference, I work on a Macbook with Ventura\n    submitted by    /u/seungscience  \n [link]   [comments]",

That's all my experience with Haskell. And having experience working with Typescript, which has a lot of really cool typing features, I'm wondering if one can replicate them in Haskell. Specifically, my question is about type mappings and conditional types. In Typescript, one can define an interface (basically, a record type):\n ```ts interface Person { name: string; age: number; married: boolean; }\n interface Profile extends Person { friends: Array<Person>; job: { title: string; salary: number; onVacation: boolean; }; } ```\n And then it's possible to create a new type out of this one by recursively replacing all numbers and boolean with strings:\n ```ts // This type gets a type argument T and recursively replaces all its boolean and number fields with strings type AllStrings<T> = { [Key in keyof T]: T[Key] extends number ? string : T[Key] extends boolean ? string : AllStrings<T[Key]>; };\n function parseBadJSON(badJSON: AllStrings<Profile>): Profile { // mapping logic } ```\n Moreover, you can see record type inheritance with extends keyword.\n I had a task at my job where I needed to parse a JSON that stores all values as strings, and I needed to map it to a JSON with numbers and booleans, where they were supposed to be, so that's how I achieved the correct typings for my mapping function (parseBadJSON).

I have two methods, a and b, both of which use the space function that accepts zero or more spaces. The a method works correctly by skipping over any spaces and then parsing the input \" a\". However, when I execute the b method with the input \" a\", it gets stuck in an endless loop.\n I suspect the issue has to do with the use of the \"many\" function in \"space\", which is causing the endless loop when b is executed. However, I'm not quite sure why this is happening.\n If anyone could shed some light on this issue and explain why the b method is causing an endless loop, I would greatly appreciate it.

I had a really hard time setting everything up, but I think I finally have something that is somewhat working. I'm using a M1 Mac so I decided to install ghcup using brew. I then installed everything else haskell related using ghcup (stack, cabal, ghc, and hls). When I then started working on my assignment the code had some imports like Random and HUnit. So in order to get that to work I tried to install those using Cabal. At this point I noticed that I also needed llvm so I installed llvm@13 using brew and added the path to $PATH. I then did cabal install --lib random and it worked! However, I have found out that this is probably no the preferred way of using cabal and I wanted to switch to a stack project which leads me to my question.\n Is there a good way to remove this libraries that I installed? I have found that the files are installed in the .cabal/store/ghc-8.10.7. In this folder I have HUnt-1.6.2.0-18526221 and rndm-1.2.1.1-c70f7c08. Can I just remove those files? Or is there a better way to do it? I basically do not want random and HUnit to be installed for every Haskell projekt I'm working on moving forward. Some noteworthy things might be that when I do cabal list --installed they don't show, but I can compile the code without any issues.\n I hope I was able to explain my issue and appreciate any help I can get.

The website contains a web app where you can paste in Haskell code, change configuration values, and see the result. It also contains docs for each of the configuration options with examples. As this is the first release of the web app, there are bound to be bugs and things that could be improved, so please write an issue for anything you find in the web app!\n    submitted by    /u/brandonchinn178  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "For my own reasons, I've come to use the di- prefix to mean half, in opposition to bi- meaning twice. This has affected me in that difunctor seems to be an older / alternative term with the same meaning as profunctor, as is evidenced by the Profunctor class itself:\n haskell class Profunctor p where dimap :: (a -> b) -> (c -> d) -> p b c -> p a d lmap :: (a -> b) -> p b c -> p a cw rmap :: (b -> c) -> p a b -> p a c \n It is actually quite awkward, this straddling of both pro- and di-. The type class name uses the pro- terminology (as in pre, and post), but the functions use the di-, l-, and r- terminology. This is unfortunate, as the Profunctor thus claims essential parts of both terminologies.\n For quite some time, I've actually thought of these in my head as promap, premap and postmap, as I have my own orthogonal use case for the di- nomenclature, having derived another dimap (and rmap, lmap) - but they clash in name with the existing profunctor functions, even though prodifunctor and prodimap in my nomenclature are actually sensible classes worth exploring. Privately I've been content with masking this, as I have alternative ways of deriving names, but I thought it was worth discussing with the community.\n What are your thoughts on the positives and consequences of changing the Profunctor nomenclature such that dimap = promap, lmap = premap, and rmap = postmap?\n    submitted by    /u/ApothecaLabs  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I've developed pure Haskell quicksort on mutable vectors while aiming to match performance of std::sort from C++. While not really hitting that bar, the result is within around 20% in sequential mode and is faster in parallel mode.\n In addition, the package exposes reasonable default sort for most users suitable for just importing and sorting without thinking twice what's going on under the hood.\n Parallelisation is implemented via both sparks and threads and the method is selectable. Unfortunately threads don't show much speedup but users can define ther own, hopefully faster, methods to parallelise. Sparks-based parallelisation is much faster but unfortunately will use all available capabilities at runtime so it's less controllable.\n The repository is https://github.com/sergv/vector-quicksort and the benchmarks are under https://github.com/sergv/vector-quicksort#benchmarks.\n    submitted by    /u/serg_foo  \n [link]   [comments]",

In particular, we'd like to know\n  \nWhether you like the syntax ((one of 1,2,3), 4) in the original proposal better than the amended one mirroring case of: (one of {1;2;3},4)\n \nWhether you like that it is subject to layout, similar to case of, e.g., \n f (one of 1 2 3) = 4\n Which looks kind of funny here, but perhaps has foreseen use cases.\n \nWhether you think it's good or bad to allow f (one of {}) (with layout just f (one of), even), and whether the semantics should be a strict match (mirroring case x of {}) or lazy (like case x of _ -> ...)\n \nIf you have experience with writing tools for GHC Haskell, whether mirroring case of syntax poses new problems for you, especially caused by it being subject to layout rules\n \n (Note that we understand that you might not like either syntax. That is fine, but the linked proposal thread is not the place to have that discussion.

They have \"good-beginner\" issues and are extremely nice in both the comments and in Discord, and are very active in helping newcomers. \n I'd like to not jump into projects that aren't able to allocate resources to helping beginner programmers on trivial problems. It would be a huge waste of their time and I assume disrupting their workflow. \n I'm mostly just wanting to find projects that mostly meet this criteria. Bonus points if there's an active discord/slack community. \n Any sector is fine, since I'm trying to branch out and learn what I like. Pretty much any subject goes. I'm more interested in the coding experience/learning the ropes than anything. It'll take time to find out what subject I really like. Right now, I have so much fun coding that the project itself rarely matters.\n My only limitation is that my math background is very poor, so a lot of research-based projects are probably too difficult for me.\n Any info would be really welcome. \n Thanks :)\n    submitted by    /u/line_78  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi all. Long time lurker here but first time poster.\n I thought this community might be interested in my dissertation. It’s an evaluation of effect systems / design patterns in pure functional languages, from first principles. It operates at the intersection of the academic literature and real world software development. Haskell was the most obvious language for this task, so I used a small program involving four key effects: environment, state, errors and I/O.\n A lot of my time was spent trying to understand the history of the domain and drawing out the most important criteria for working programmers. In the end I settled on: expressiveness, modularity, extensibility, ergonomics and performance. These are the basis for the comparison.\n I don’t expect anyone to have the time to read the whole thing, so this post summarises some of the key take aways: https://www.dantb.dev/posts/dissertation\n I also compiled a list of my favourite resources (there should be a few familiar names from this subreddit… 🙂): https://www.dantb.dev/posts/effects-bibliography\n This evaluation may be useful for people wanting to understand the trade offs involved in selecting tools and techniques in pure functional languages. This was one of my personal goals for the project, as someone who has used pure FP in Scala for several years but never went deep on the theory before. I saw a bit of a gap in the literature regarding the application of these design patterns from the perspective of a software developer, which is what I’m most interested in.\n The structure is broadly chronological and a lot of it is probably old news for experienced Haskellers. With that in mind, I'd highlight Chapter 7 which contrasts extensible effects with the earlier approaches.\n Comments are open 🙂\n Dan\n    submitted by    /u/dantb  \n [link]   [comments]",

I also do understand the answers when I’m doing questions but it’s just writing and coming up with the functions that is the hard part. \n Thank you in advance!\n    submitted by    /u/Affectionate_Rich815  \n [link]   [comments]",

All partners in your business, can you still apply for such job contracts. How does the interview process go now that you are more than one.\n Incase of b2b scala jobs on linkedin where do I show that this is my business, this is my crew, this is what I've done. Coz on linkedin it seems like an individual process not business.\n Once your employed can you subcontract the work.\n Sorry for the many questions. Hope there's a kind soul here who can clarify this whole b2b thing for me.\n    submitted by    /u/hkateu  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "This Release Candidate version of Indigo (a Scala 3 pixel art 2D game engine for Scala.js) is the result of six months work and will hopefully become a full release after undergoing a bit more testing. Feel free to take it for a spin! 🚀\n It contains a good number of general improvements that are based on real usage during the production of our biggest demo to date, hopefully coming soon-ish!\n The main bulk of the work is a total replacement of all GLSL based shaders in favour of programs written using Ultraviolet. Ultraviolet is a Scala 3 shader program writing library that is currently aimed at WebGL + GLSL. The purpose of this work is to begin to separate Indigo from Scala.js and WebGL, so that the project can look at supporting other rendering technologies (WebGPU is the next likely target), and one day, other platforms like the JVM and/or Native. Custom GLSL shaders will still be supported for the for the foreseeable future, but existing shaders will require very minor modification to be compatible.\n Indigo's website is slowly going through a necessary rebuild, so for now it's advisable to check out the release notes below if you decide to try this version out. Alternatively, do come and say hello on our Discord server if you need any help, or even just to show off what you're making. 😁\n https://github.com/PurpleKingdomGames/indigo/releases/tag/v0.15.0-RC1\n    submitted by    /u/davesmith00000  \n [link]   [comments]",

These constraints are evaluable at compile-time and/or at runtime:\n scala val x: Int :| Positive = 5 //OK val y: Int :| Positive = -4 //Compile-time error! val z: Int :| Positive = -4.refine //Runtime exception. Variants for `Option`, `Either` etc... exist \n Check the Github page for more information.\n Features of v2.1.0\n New error messages\n Iron now has enhanced compile-time errors, clearer and more explicit.\n ```scala def log(x: Double :| Positive): Double = Math.log(x)\n log(-1)  scala -- Constraint Error -------------------------------------------------------- Could not satisfy a constraint…",

Is it the ugly red-headed step-child nobody wants to see or hear?\n I watched some videos on Scala-Native and saw that the Java libraries which are used to some extent by Scala for the JVM are NOT usable for Scala-Native. Does this mean some parts of them have to be rewritten in Scala? how else might their use in the JVM world be replaced for the Native world?\n Is this a project new people can join?

I created it because I've been a Scala Engineer for the past 10 years and it's always been a pain finding jobs that actually use Scala. \n An example of why it's a pain: LinkedIn claims to have 30,000+ Scala jobs, but you click on most of them and they say \"Requires experience with languages like Python C#, C++, Java, Javascript, Rust, Go, Scala, or Kotlin\". They just use Scala as a keyword, and you'll never actually use Scala in that job.\n With FairJoin I review every job posting to ensure it has a high likelihood of actually using Scala. It's early stages, but some of the next features I plan on adding are filters for things like location and Scala specific attributes (i.e. Functional, Akka, Cats, Data Engineering), as well as more company info.\n ​\n I hope it's useful, and I'd love to hear your thoughts either here or email me at stephen@fairjoin.com\n    submitted by    /u/FairJoin  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm particularly interested in hearing how others utilize org-roam in their workflows.\n I've developed a system where I create index pages for each major subject. These org-roam files are tagged with :index: and usually left empty. \n For instance, if I were learning Python, I'd create three index pages: Python, Theory, and Examples, with the last two having backlinks for the first one.\n When I take notes related to a particular subject, I create a new note and insert a backlink to the corresponding index page. This way, when I need to find a specific note, I can simply visit one of the index pages and review its backlinks, instead of trying to remember what name i gave to the specific note.\n While this method has been somewhat effective for me, I'm wondering if there might be a more efficient or more organized way to approach this. I'd love to hear about any tips, tricks, or workflows you use in org-roam when learning new topics.\n Thanks\n    submitted by    /u/jenescript  \n [link]   [comments]",

When I put links in Org-mode files they appear normally, i.e. the whole [[/link][caption]] thing is hidden and I just see the caption with an underline, can click on it, etc.\n I also have my Emacs configured (somehow) to color characters overflowing my fill-column something jarring, and I usually use auto-fill-mode and have no problems with that.\n For example if I have fill-column set to 3 and have a line abcde, de will be colored to mark they're over the line limit.\n However, it seems that whatever's coloring my isn't taking into account what Org-mode does to hide links. So if I have a link [[/link][caption]] which has 18 characters in its raw form but only 7 (caption) are getting displayed, those 7 characters count as 18 characters towards the line limit!\n For example if I have fill-column set to 20 and have a line [[/link][caption]] foo, I expected to see no characters marked as over the limit because I'm seeing just caption foo, but in fact the final oo are marked as over the limit because in that regard it counts as a 22-character line.\n Sorry for the verbose explanation.

          "description": "I’m just getting started with org-mode in Emacs and am looking at options for keeping my org files in sync between computers — specifically, between two Macs. A complication is that on one of the Macs I am limited in what software I can install, for work-related reasons (for example, syncthing might not be an option, Dropbox is probably OK, as is iCloud Drive).\n It’s most important to me that the syncing should be robust, reliable, and secure. I’d like to have files sync automatically in the background, rather than having to trigger a sync manually before leaving one machine or starting on the other. Similarly, it would be good if I don’t have to remember to close all buffers before I leave a machine (i.e. if conflicts and simultaneous editing aren’t a problem, or at least that resolving conflicts doesn’t risk losing data). Also in terms of avoiding data loss, I’d like to be able to make backups of the files, ideally with versioning in case I need to go back and fix something.\n End-to-end encryption would be desirable if it’s cloud storage (which might make iCloud Drive preferable to Dropbox). Being able to sync to an iOS app like Beorg would be nice too, but is less important.\n However, one concern I have about iCloud (apart from some suggestions that it's not always reliable) is that it seems like you can’t always guarantee that all files are really stored locally on the Mac, rather than only in the cloud, even if you don’t select “optimize storage\" (see for example https://eclecticlight.co/2022/02/21/can-you-back-up-icloud-documents/ ). So, it seems that backup solutions aren’t guaranteed to be able to see and backup the files stored in there (if they happen to be online only). Otherwise, I’d be happy to do my own backups of the directory with something like rsync to my NAS.\n Are there any solutions that fit my wishlist, or am I being too demanding in what I’m looking for? Any pointers would be very welcome!\n    submitted by    /u/argopenguin  \n [link]   [comments]",

The book (Turabian) said the utility of a storyboard versus an outline, is that you can easily move information around. This made me think of org mode, which I already use productively for outlining. \n So I know it already can do the basic task of storyboarding as is. However, I was curious about whether org mode could display information more like a \"storyboard.\" Either horizontally or (maybe better for not having to scroll so much) tiling.\n I imagine this would work with the top level heading defining a card / unit and then units would be displayed horizontally or in a grid, rather than a vertical list.\n Is this something that already exists?\n    submitted by    /u/encomun  \n [link]   [comments]",

Having essentially used them for a rather long time, they have proven to be very useful to me and I wanted to share them with you.\n I did not want to write here when I published them, to try and fix any bugs or problems that would arise by their new bundled form, but they seem to be working properly so... here they are:\n  \nKLP is a general package, focusing solely on making the consistent naming as easy as possible, with a note_category_title.org, template. This allows for arbitrary categories to be easily defined, built and search through. Some use cases for it would be cheatsheet files, easily accessible notes on cli tools ... generally static notes.\n Org-lectures. Now this one, even though it shares quite a lot of elements with KLP (it was developed almost simultaneously) allows for the easy creation and management of courses and lectures files. By assigning a couple of keybindings and complementing it with a package like CDLatex or Yasnippets, a really fun workflow was created that allows me to take (in real time) lecture notes for my university courses.\n  \nFeel free to try them!\n P.S. My experience in writing packages is limited, so any feedback would be more than welcome (this is the reason why I decided to post here after all, :P). Literate programming files also exist in their respective repos, allowing for easier understanding of these simple packages.\n    submitted by    /u/chatziiola  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello\n I am using org-mode and org-attach via doom emacs. Whenever I have made notes and tried to attach something using either org-download-screenshot or org-download-clipboard, by default the heading has an \"ATTACH\" tag signifying that there is an attachment in this heading. Example shown below.\n ​\n https://preview.redd.it/dcx9pfdb9esa1.png?width=744&format=png&auto=webp&s=4b453b1d160882ee09624e84c5598ec222c5f3ec\n Now when I try to export this to GFM using pandoc, this is what it does\n ​\n https://preview.redd.it/2keyfcri9esa1.png?width=1110&format=png&auto=webp&s=57aa82093888ea635644fcedc5be3eaf376f21f4\n Essentially it exports the ATTACH tag out. I have a couple of questions.\n  \nWhat's the purpose behind the \"ATTACH\" tag? The reason I ask this is because I can easily set org-attach-auto-tag to nil and this tag is not attached and therefore not exported. But does it have other consequences that I might not be aware of. Reading the documentation, it doesn't appear so, but I am then left to wonder why this would be the default behavior.\n Is there a way to keep the org-attach-auto-tag to the default value of \"ATTACH\" but not have it exported. I tried setting the EXPORT_EXCLUDE_TAGS to ATTACH but then of course the whole content doesn't get exported.\n  \nThanks for your help.\n    submitted by    /u/CautiousCartoonist  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I was looking for a workflow where I'd paste images from clipboard all the time. I figured I could do it with the org-download package like so (with use-package):\n (use-package org-download :ensure t ;; this makes sure the thing is loaded if not present :init (setq org-download-method 'attach) :config (add-hook 'dired-mode-hook 'org-download-enable) :bind (\"C-y\" . org-download-clipboard)) \n Which works, until I try to paste text. Emacs freezes completely, and is unusable.\n I realized this also happens if I just call org-download-clipboard directly without a shortcut, when there is no pic in the immediate clipboard.\n So my question is: am I doing something wrong? Is there a simple solution here without having to use different shortcuts?\n Thanks in advance.\n    submitted by    /u/financier1337  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi there,\n I've been recently spending a lot of time inside docker containers (or Podman in my case), and because of this, project.el has picked up a project and stored it in the projects file. If Emacs reboots and the container is no longer there, project attempts to open the file in TRAMP, and TRAMP hangs until I press q to allow tramp to exit.\n I can think of two ways to hypothetically fix this:\n The first is by modifying the project-find-functions list. It's a list of functions which are ran in succession until one of them returns a truthy value. My current project-find-functions is (project-try-vc project-try-local). I believe in my case project-try-vc is returning t.\n The second is by telling TRAMP to move on after a failure, allowing the boot to complete even when some projects are not accessible. I'm thinking an advice might be necessary to achieve this.\n Are there any other options? Does anyone out there have a solution to this already?\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/FederalPirate2867  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'd like to be able to change the bg/fg colors dynamically based on the current DOOM theme. \n I've successfully written a function that changes the XML data to the new bg/fg color of the xml in-place, and hooked it to doom-load-theme-hook. However, xenops still renders a new preview for the exact same text.\n For example, say i have a xenops LaTeX snippet \n \\(S^1\\) \n generated for the theme doom-zenburn.\n I can change the theme, and the XML file for the associated to the above snippet has its colors updated. In fact, if the preview is visible inline, and I change the theme, the preview changes its colors. This is expected behavior.\n However, when I enter the LaTeX snippet and exit it again, xenops regenerates the snippet for the new theme. Is there a way to prevent this? I don't want to generate new snippets per theme as this would take up unnecessary disk space and compute resources.\n My gut tells me it's not possible.

          "description": "Thanks for reading folks!\n I've just updated to an experimental Emacs build (30.0.50) and prayed on first run .. but my existing massive .emacs came up pretty well, only a couple of gnits. One of the warnings was not to use docker-tramp anymore due to the built in tramp-container.el\n At a quick glance of the .el and errors it produces, I'm getting the feeling that was designed around local containers (Docker running locally with the Emacs), but not for a remote container\n For example, I use Tramp via multi-hop, so that I can ssh to a server where the containers are running, and run the docker ps and open a shell within the images _over there_\n So a bookmark would look something like:\n /ssh:[foo@someserver.com](mailto:foo@someserver.com)|docker:bar@container:/path/within/docker\n tramp-container.el looks like the same syntax (/docker) as docker-tramp, but I wonder if it only works locally?\n I'll have to try docker-tramp again and see if remote still works there, or am I out of luck on this astoundingly handy behaviour. (or perhaps a local docker daemon can reach out to remote docker daemons, or I can run some ssh tunnels to pretend local is remote, or something..)\n edit: Looks like I had a defcustom override for the docker tramp so it was using 'sudo docker' on the target very old system; so I added a override tramp-docker-program for the new module, but still no dice. (Currently experimenting with things like /ssh:foo@someserver.com|sudo::|docker:bar@containername:/path but still no dice)\n    submitted by    /u/FrozenOnPluto  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Just switched to elpaca and was pleasantly surprised how fast it was to spin up a new installation (minutes down to seconds). But I'm surprised to see how much faster startup time is. I had spent a lot of time tuning my config with use-package, and was pretty pleased with a seven second startup. I use emacsclient, so this only really mattered when tuning the config and restarting - but still acceptable.\n But with elpaca, my startup time is just over a second! (measured via time emacs --eval \"(save-buffers-kill-terminal)\" It's possible that some of this is due to no longer loading things that have been added into Emacs over the time that my configuration has grown (when was org-mode made native??) - and a side benefit of elpaca is that it complained about this and made me fix it.\n But does multi-threading improve both installation time AND start-up time?\n    submitted by    /u/kentrose  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "A literate org mode document that tangles, using noweb an org file into a theme file is a nice way of organizing themes by the files and sections they customize instead of by the sections needed by the file. See: https://gitlab.com/stefan.koch.micro/dotfiles/-/blob/master/emacs/stefan-theme-tangle.org\n Details:\n I spent the weekend setting up my own color theme. What I did not like about how this is done is that the color theme file is broken into sections by the need of the functions to define it. What I wanted to do was to setup the theme organized by the mode or functionality. Since others sharing has helped me in the past, I thought I would share this with the community. (See: The Proximity Principle at https://kula.blog/posts/proximity_principle/)\n I had been using the following techniques anyway, so I was most of the way there:\n  \nUsed GNU Stow to manage my dotfiles (Brandon Invergo' Using GNU Stow to manage your dotfiles: https://brandon.invergo.net/news/2012-05-26-using-gnu-stow-to-manage-your-dotfiles.html\n Used literate config file using org-babel. This lets you write an org file with emacs lisp source code blocks that are saved to an .el file when it is tangled.) See Literate Programming here: https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/intro.html#literate-programming\n  \nBut, this still made me sequence the code in the sections that the theme file required. I did not want that. So noweb came to the rescue. Using noweb, you can have a source block that will include references to source blocks defined in other areas of the org file. This allowed me to organize the file the way I wanted to. The top of the file is the skeleton for the theme file with the sections defined, and the sections below each add to the theme section as they need.\n In case you missed it above, see https://gitlab.com/stefan.koch.micro/dotfiles/-/blob/master/emacs/stefan-theme-tangle.org for the full details.\n    submitted by    /u/StefanKochMicro  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'd like to make sure some cleanup code is executed when leaving the transient, however that may happen, with transient-do-quit or with C-g, whatever. But I can't seem to find a way to do that. I even tried to create a suffix overriding C-g but couldn't get that to work. I also tried (desperate measures...) to advise the transient and wrapped it in unwind-protect itself, without success. So, is there a way to ensure some code is executed after the transient? \n The second is that I'd like to let bind a variable while the transient is active.

I suspect that many users have themselves customized that variable to put all backup files in a single directory, in which case they would also be affected.)\n If you use emacs/emacsclient as EDITOR and an external tool opens an unencrypted file containing some sensitive data in a directory on a tmpfs file-system, then the backup file would by default be created in the same directory, so it would not hit a disk and be discarded after a reboot.\n Note that this only affects you, if the visited file is not encrypted. So if you, for example, visit ~/.authsource.gpg, then the backup file is also encrypted, regardless of where it resides.\n Please update to release 1.3.0 or snapshot 20230420 and delete all files ~/.config/emacs/var/backup/!tmp!... and ~/.config/emacs/var/backup/!dev!shm!....\n This gets you back to how Emacs behaves by default.\n  \nThe default isn't so great either. No backups are created for files in /tmp, but for files in /dev/shm backups are created. To prevent that you would have to use a custom backup-enable-predicate function.

I have wanted an easy way to refile all headings from scratch.org file to files in dropbox. I thought of an elisp form at the top of the file which will act like a button by evaluating with eval-last-sexp command.\n I also wanted this refiling thing for the files in Dropbox. Every file would refile to a specific file.\n I couldn't create those elisp forms that will act like buttons easily. It was harder than i thought. I found org-refile function hard to work with programmatically. \n After wasting so much time about this problem, i found a rather simpler and maybe even intuitive solution.\n I add local variables to each org file. An org-refile-targets and org-archive-location variable for every file. This solution doesn't give a one click way to refile all headings to a file, but it does give a simpler and focused way to refile and archive headings to specific org-files. \n I found this solution very satisfying for my workflow.

So I want to try a new trick to improve things:\n  \nCapture someday-maybe items as entries with a date 2 weeks in the future\n I evaluate everything in that file every week. If I want to keep the item, I promote it by either moving it to another file, or removing its timestamp.\n For each item, if I haven't promoted it by the time its timestamp rolls around, then org-mode deletes the entry\n  \nThis means I want a plugin or a command or something that will delete items with expired timestamps. I looked through the org manual, and found C-u C-u C-c C-x C-s (https://orgmode.org/manual/Moving-subtrees.html) that will archive items under these circumstances. I want to delete them.\n I suppose I could set up the archive file to be /dev/null ! I'll try that and see what happens.\n [EDIT] I tried to set #+ARCHIVE: /dev/null::%s at the top of the file in question (someday.org), but when I archive using C-c C-x C-a it sends it to ./someday.org_archive instead.\n [EDIT2] I just made it re-read the file and tried again, this time I got the answer that /dev/null isn't going to work :( File exists, but cannot be read Copied: Subtree(s) with 19 characters funcall-interactively: Buffer is read-only: #<buffer null> \n [EDIT3] I've made peace that someday.org_archive is workable - I'll just think of it as landfill. So where I'm stuck currently, is to make org's capture template set a date 2 weeks in the future when I capture an item to someday.org. I looked through the org manual's entries on capture templates again, but it doesn't look like there's an answer for this.\n    submitted by    /u/EnoughUnit5  \n [link]   [comments]",

One inconvenience is that when I run `helm-find-files` under a Windows mount (e.g. /mnt/c/Users/me/Downloads) once, then I later add a file under that folder, and then I run `helm-find-files` again, the latter doesn't seem to update and show the latest files added. Dired and shell work correctly. Also regular files under ~/ work as expected. What could it be? And how could I have an up-to-date output with `helm-find-files` even in mounted dirs?

          "description": "I recently migrated from straight to elpaca. I'm generally very pleased with the results, but there is one issue I don't know how to resolve, even after reading the manual and trying various searches online. The issue is pretty simple: I don't seem to be able to get elpaca to load updates to any use-package expression after Emacs has started.\n For example, let's say I want to set the value of the user option org-hide-emphasis-markers to t in my config file. I then add (setq org-hide-emphasis-markers t) to the use-package section of org-mode:\n elisp (use-package org :demand t :config (setq org-hide-emphasis-markers t)) \n (Assume for simplicity that I have no other org-mode customizations.)\n To test the effects of this change, I run eval-last-sexp with point at the end of the macro. However, nothing happens: the new value is not set.\n I thought this may be related to the asynchronous nature of how elpaca handles packages. But evaluating (elpaca-process-queues) has no effect.\n Apologies if I'm missing something obvious.\n    submitted by    /u/Benthamite  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi! I'm looking to migrate to vanilla emacs, and I thought I'd kick things off by asking you all for advice.\n I'm terrible at emacs, but I've been managing to limp along with it as my primary driver for a good number of years now. I used vim for many years, but then I switched to spacemacs for some time and moved on to doom a little while back. I absolutely love the idea of a modal space menu, and the evil integrations have been fantastic for me.\n BUT. Even though they're great projects, I'd really like to be done with things like spacemacs and doom. They've been a great way for me to see what's out there, but all the built-in customization makes it really hard for someone like me to understand where various behaviors are actually coming from, and at least a few times I've discovered that after much hair-pulling what I thought were plugin bugs were actually problems with the customization layers. I feel like I always end up stripping away as many of the customizations as possible.\n My use case is essentially solid support for C++, maybe some python and glsl, and that's pretty much it. I know eglot & clangd/ccls work well for the c++ part, which i feel covers quite a bit of what I need. With eglot and things like use-package becoming a part of emacs in 29, I'm really getting the itch to just build things up from vanilla emacs, so that I know exactly what is custom and what isn't.\n External things I know I'd like:\n  \nspacemacs-style menu (is this a package?)\n magit\n ranger for file browsing\n evil integration everywhere possible\n  \nWhat major headaches do people see lurking here if I'm keeping things pretty minimal?\n    submitted by    /u/bluuurk  \n [link]   [comments]",

I’ve been focusing on using nano (in both Ubuntu and macOS) for about a year or two and I’ve discovered I can’t unlearn emacs bindings after using it for over 25 years - it takes *more* effort to slow down and translate what I want to do into a nano binding which just doesn’t seem efficient to me (not to mention all the times I’ve had to undo my mistakes!)\n I‘m well aware I can just install emacs through homebrew and just wondering what alternatives exist out there compatible with emacs bindings? [and I’m not looking for anything fancy - 95% of the time I’m just doing basic editing of a config file or README.txt]\n I could have sworn there exists a lightweight terminal editor compatible with emacs bindings included with macOS now and I can’t find any reference to it so thought I’d wave the white flag and post here!\n    submitted by    /u/udance4ever  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "This has been an issue for a while, and I hope someone can tell me what's really going on. I use transient-mark-mode and normally it works great. But once in a while it gets \"wedged\", where the region doesn't deactivate properly after something that should deactivate it. As a concrete example, if I mark a region and hit delete, the region is removed, but not deactivated. So if I move the point, it expands the region again, leaving the mark where it was. And if I just start typing, I only get the last letter, as each letter replaces the previous. The only way I've found to fix this is to exit emacs and restart it.\n Ideally, I'd like to figure out what setting gets \"bumped\" that makes this happen, and prevent it. Failing that, a way to correct it short of not using TMM would be nice. In the worst case, knowing what triggers it so I can maybe avoid it would be better than where I am now.\n    submitted by    /u/perkinslr  \n [link]   [comments]",

The issue is there for some packages and for some not. For example orderless functions have no such issue and the doc points to orderless.el as expected. php-mode is fine. Magit has the issue. \n Have you noticed anything like that in your setup? Is it native-comp related? Is there any way to guide Emacs so it knows where definitions are?

But for some reason it just points to wrong file. \n Just for some additional info: - I'm on MacOS - I use emacs-plus@29 compiled with brew - I use use-package with straight\n Any idea on how to solve it is highly appreciated.

Fine, but I also decided to use the vertico package. It also seems that rtags has a support for Helm, but from what I understand, Helm and and Vertico fall under the same category of packages and therefore I can only have one of them.\n I found this friendly tutorial on how to install cmake-ide and I'm pretty satisfied with the customization used in it. I thought that by omit the helm line in the config scope and by changing (setq rtags-display-result-backend 'helm) to vertico would workout with my configuration, but it failed.\n So my question is: is it possible to combine vertico and rtags to work simultaneously?\n    submitted by    /u/jjaneto  \n [link]   [comments]",

Since the Zettelkasten as life-long companion and comrade in the battle for and against knowledge is a long-term endeavor, it is crucial that you create notes and structures that will last a long time. The minimum goal should be that they last a lifetime, so they are optimally designed for yourself. Ideally, they last forever, so future generations can benefit from your work as well.\n\r\n                   \nRead the full story here",

For zettelkasten fans, you'll note that it has some familiar references and suggested readings including by our friends Markus Krajewski, Ann Blair, Iaian McGilchrist, Alex Wright, Anthony Grafton, Dennis Duncan, and Mortimer J. Adler to name but a few.\nMany are certain to know his award winning 1998 book The Professor and the Madman which was also transformed into the eponymous 2019 film starring Sean Penn. Though he didn't use the German word zettelkasten in the book, he tells the story of philologist James Murray's late 1800s collaborative 6 million+ slip box collection of words and sentences which when edited into a text is better known today as the Oxford English Dictionary.\nIf you need some additional motivation to check out his book, I'll use the fact that Winchester, as a writer, is one of the most talented non-linear storytellers I've ever come across, something which many who focus on zettelkasten output may have a keen interest in studying.",

As you see, mine are boring and you are probably doing more interesting stuff.\nTypical of when I'm in class, my note take is slowed. More accurately, my refactoring of notes into atomic-sized notes has slowed. I will add as many words to my ZK, but each note is bigger. Because of the speed of the class, I don't feel I have time to refactor the notes I've captured from reading, say, \"Read Hot Epic.\" I keep all the ideas captured from the story in a single note, hoping to atomize the note sometime. In the meantime, I have all the ideas, and because of my search skills, the ideas are not lost.\n@Sascha's article Why the Single Note Matters is a real eye opener. Care and attention must be paid to each and every note. The effort in this practice is what is called zettelkasting. The rewards are a supportive ZK partner. If you consider this a downside, the downside is that this activity siows time. You will naturally slow down. In a non-pressure environment, this is a good thing. Not so sure it works in a classroom setting with a schedule to keep up with.\nI've started a list in my journal of projects to advance once I've completed the food writing seminar.

Tell us about the state of you zettelkasting journey.\nMy week has been busy with medical issues that prevented me from making many new notes. I feel good now. \nI got my first two essays back from the professor in my food writing class, and I feel good about them. I am of a different generation than everyone else in the class, including the instructor. There are a couple of writers in the class that seem to be able to write a first draft of a 'writing prompt exercise' that is far more polished than my 'shitty first drafts'. They are modeling a skill that I aspire to.\nWhile journaling this morning, I found a gem in an entry from one year ago today. It's very meta, and this is all very circular.\n\n  \nZettelkasting and journaling are like workouts. You have a busy day ahead. Why journal? Journaling is not just another task. At first, you stumble with form.  Like when you are a beginner at weight training, you struggle with repeatedly getting to the gym. You think it will help your physical health, but at first, you feel sore, tight, and tired, not at all the pinnacle of health. Eventually, if you stick with it, you might find a coach that helps with form, you might set up your environment so going to the gym feels natural, you might start to feel strength building, and you've started progressing on the climb to physical health.\nAll these weight training actions can be applied to zettelkasting and journaling. They train your mental health in the same way exercise trains your physical health. It's a slow process at first. You can't see the improvements day to day or even week to week. Improvement only comes with consistency.\n\n\nI think I'll move this gem from my journal to my ZK. I have a couple of relevant notes on the mental health benefits of journaling.\n\nMy seven day zettel production",
