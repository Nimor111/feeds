          "description": "Hi folks, I'd appreciate some basic assistance. I'm playing around with sum types (or ADTs) of records, and I get this odd bit of behavior.\n  ghci> :set -XRecordWildCards ghci> data V = V{x :: Int, y :: Int} | W{a :: Int, b :: Int} deriving Show ghci> testq v@V{..} = v{x = 9} ghci> testq w@W{..} = w{a = 9} ghci> testq x = x ghci> :t testq testq :: p -> p ghci> testq V{x = 1, y = 1} V {x = 1, y = 1} \n First, I don't know why the type of the function is p -> p rather than V -> V. Second, I don't know why the function fails to change the x value to 9 on the last line. That might simply be my ignorance of how RecordWildCards works.\n In general, are sum types of records a terrible idea? Will things break if some of the records have fields with the same name? I suppose name clashes could be addressed by defining the records separately in their own namespaces, and then putting them all together in the sum type. Finally, if there's a particular reference that would be valuable for better understanding how records work in Haskell, I'd appreciate a pointer. But perhaps the manual is sufficient: https://ghc.gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/doc/users_guide/exts/records.html\n Thank you.\n EDIT: On a bit of investigation, it appears that you can use the same field in multiple records in a sum type. The bigger issue appears to be when a field is only in one record. You can write code that isn't type safe because it's calling a record selector that works on one record type on a different record type. Unless that's only ghci that lets you do that.\n    submitted by    /u/mister_drgn  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Recently, in my \"quest\" to understand Monads, people told me to study Functors, Applicatives, Semigroups and Monoids and understand how they work first. I did so and thought that I had finally reached an understanding with the whole thing... until I was told my understanding was wrong.\n Starting from the beginning: I went to study Functors, most places talking about them just talk about how fmap works, and I understood them as \"Anything that has a definition of fmap\". \n The other places talk about it's category theory definition: This, together with me reading that \"All Functors in Haskell are actually Endofunctors\", made me \"click\" this exact thought \"Wait, if the definition of an Endofunctor is when a category maps to itself, and fmap returns the same typeclass as the one it receives as input, therefore the typeclasses are the categories here and that's why they're called Endofunctors! I got it!\".\n So I went to ask people about how a \"non-Endo\" Functor would be... and that's when I was told that the explanation I came with was wrong: Typeclasses are not \"categories\" in this context, people say \"All Functors in Haskell are actually Endofunctors\" because the \"category\" here (Called Hask) is the set of all types in Haskell (And indeed, all mappings to a type in Haskell yield... a type in Haskell), but that simply destroyed the prior understanding I had and made the word \"Functor\" meaningless to em again.\n Given that the concept of fmap and Functor are so closely related, is the fact that fmap always returns the same structure as the one of the input it is given (e.g. a fmap with a List will always yield a List, a fmap with an IO monad will always yield an IO monad, a fmap with a Either Monad WON'T EVER yield a Maybe Monad) just a coincidence, having nothing to do with the definition of either a Functor or an Endofunctor?\n    submitted by    /u/Sky_Sumisu  \n [link]   [comments]",

I read about hsenv and how supposedly it is kinda the same (https://hackage.haskell.org/package/hsenv) so I guess I can use that and just cabal install --lib away there but havent tried it yet.\n How do you guys do this? How do you mess around and experiment with non-base modules after which you remove what is unnecessary leaving you with a clean system? I just want to write some basic scripts, maybe at some point write some larger applications. Every single time I get drawn back in again (it is all for my own benefit, i am not required to learn haskell) I am met with this exact same nonsense where I just blank out and ditch it because my global installation gets f*cked.

After trying to build the package for some time, I got an error:\n src/Data/Sexp.hs:4:14: warning: [-Wdeprecated-flags] -XOverlappingInstances is deprecated: instead use per-instance pragmas OVERLAPPING/OVERLAPPABLE/OVERLAPS | 4 | {-# LANGUAGE OverlappingInstances, ViewPatterns #-} | ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ [1 of 4] Compiling Data.Sexp ( src/Data/Sexp.hs, dist/build/Data/Sexp.o, dist/build/Data/Sexp.dyn_o ) src/Data/Sexp.hs:200:25: error: [GHC-76037] Not in scope: type constructor or class ‘NoSelector’ Suggested fix: Perhaps use ‘Selector’ (imported from GHC.Generics) | 200 | instance IsRecord (M1 S NoSelector f) False | ^^^^^^^^^^ Error: cabal: Failed to build sexp-0.7 (which is required by exe:sexp from sexp-0.7). See the build log above for details. \n More important than this particular error, I'm just trying to figure out if I'm doing the right thing. Can you just find a package on hackage and install it, or do you have to check for compatibility first? In this case, the package hasn't been updated in 7 years, but I was unable to learn that from hackage--I had to go look at its github page. I'm guessing the age is a problem, but I just don't have a sense of how to find packages and determine whether they'll be compatible with my setup.\n For reference, I'm running ghc version 9.6.5 in a nix develop shell.

To be clear, when I say \"defining\" I mean saying what a value is, as opposed to \"doing\", that is, going through the computational steps, procedural style. Anyway, here's my solution.\n type Peg = String type Move = (Peg, Peg) hanoi :: Integer -> Peg -> Peg -> Peg -> [Move] hanoi 0 _ _ _ = [] hanoi 1 a b _ = [(a, b)] hanoi x start goal temp = hanoi (x - 1) start temp goal ++ (start, goal) : hanoi (x - 1) temp goal start \n I'm sure there are problems with my solution, and this definitely isn't something that would be difficult to implement in a procedural style, but when I was first attempting this problem I was creating structures to keep track of where each disc was and what the size of each disc was, and seeing this solution I just got really excited, so I thought I'd share it :) thanks for reading all this if you did btw\n    submitted by    /u/sniffle_whistler  \n [link]   [comments]",

The ast is just an instance of a pretty big recursive data type.\n While developing the language, I've ended up needing to write a bunch of functions that all boil down to recursively modifying a couple of the constructors, while leaving the rest untouched. (Eg, turning every \"Implies a b\" into \"Or (Not a) b\" while leaving everything else untouched).\n Not every constructor has the same shape, so there isn't an easy way to use wildcards while keeping the function recursive, and so to avoid writing a bunch of nearly identical recursive calls (elimImp (Not a) = Not (elimImp a)) for every function, I wrote an operator Ive been calling $$ that threads a function through every recursive constructor, and then elimImp can just be a case statement that only does its job, and then is the identity otherwise, and doesnt have to worry about keeping the recursion going. \n This thingy, $$, isn't exactly map, and isn't exactly apply, even though it's clearly similar to both. I am assuming it's a fairly common operation to perform on recursive data structures, but I don't know what I would be called. What exactly have I written?

There's a lot of neat functionality buried in here - you can take two Records and diff them to produce a [Update record], you can apply that with updateRecord :: (Record rec) => rec -> [Update rec] -> rec. Fields can be serialized and deserialized, allowing a type like [Update rec] to be parsed out of a JSON response - now you can have your API clients send just a list of fields to update on the underlying record.\n One of those functions is tabulateEntityA, which allows you to specify an applicative action f for every field, and construct a record from that.\n tabulateEntityA :: (Record rec, Applicative f) => (forall ty. Field rec ty -> f ty) -> f rec \n Several folks have recognizes that the form Applicative f => (forall ty. Field rec ty -> f ty) is a concept on it's own: the ability to distribute the type constructor f across each field of rec. In other words: the power of Higher Kinded Data without needing to incur the complexity costs for operations that do not require it.\n There is one last concern: the name. We have the concept, we have many functions that operate on the concept, but none of the proposed names have stuck out to me.\n I've got a GitHub issue to discuss the matter here: https://github.com/parsonsmatt/prairie/issues/16\n And I'll back-link the Reddit discussion here to GitHub so we can keep everything correlated.\n    submitted by    /u/ephrion  \n [link]   [comments]",

Python :) At least in the spirit of its Zen: \"one and preferably only one obvious way to do it\", \"simple is better than complex\", \"readability counts\" etc, otherwise similar to Haskell (or PureScript even closer now) in semantics. It's just a specification for fun and I don't think it'll ever get to implementation, so below question is purely curiosity-driven you can unleash your imagination if you want.\n So, if you had a chance to embed an effect system in a modern FP language to avoid any boilerplate, syntax quirks and perhaps performance penalties or at least ship it in a stdlib, how would the system look like? Haskell has plenty of options implemented as libraries - I want to avoid this galore given the \"one way\" mantra. May it could be one of those libraries like polysemy, but as part of language spec? Maybe algebraic effects similar to what Unison has (I'm all for preserving referential transparency), maybe RIO (or thinking of Scala counterpart ZIO) as part of stdlib?\n    submitted by    /u/MysteriousGenius  \n [link]   [comments]",

There is a notion of when things happen that needs to be considered, and this often makes it hard to re-use code and leads to unexpected interactions. Haskell code, on the other hand, requires no notion of time. Haskell code is tenseless, inert. Haskell code doesn't do things. Haskell code merely means things.

Some examples:\n  \nDon't actually use String, use ByteString\n In fact don't use lists at all when performance counts.\n Except obviously for iteration, when fusion is applicable. \n which, I don't know when that is.\n \n sprinkle around strictness annotations and seq liberally. \n also not really sure when to do that.\n \n Of course if you are doing X, you will definitely use pragma Y.\n  \nI'm also interested to find out about the 3rd-party libraries \"everyone\" uses. e.g. in Python, requests is more or less the \"standard\" http client, rather than the one in the standard library. In OCaml, you use the Re package for regex, never the Str module in the standard library because it's not thread safe and is super stateful.\n I wish to know these kinds of things that \"real\" Haskell programmers know.

At first, I didn't like it too. I found it weird, since the first language that I had contact with was C and it is much different from Haskell. Besides, my teacher wasn't a good professor, so this made things worse. But instead of saying that this language is useless, I decided to give it a chance, since there might be a reason I'm supposed to learn it. After that, I end up enjoying Haskell and started viewing it as a new tool and a different approach to solve problems. I told my friends that I would continue to learn Haskell and read books about it during vacation time, and they laughed at me, told me that it is useless, that I'm just wasting my time, that Haskell has no real life application and that I should learn Java if I wanna get a job (we'll learn Java next semester). I felt discouraged because I DO wanna get a job. My mom works very hard so I can only study, and I want as soon as I can be able to financially help her (or at least help her a bit).

          "description": "Let's say I have a record type like\n data PosInt = PosInt { getInt :: Int } \n and I want to maintain some invariance about it. Here, that the wrapped Int is always positive (I know in this example I could also use a newtype but bear with me). So (I guess?) the standard approach would be to not expose the type constructor, so only the current module can construct instances of type PosInt. However, I still want to give read access to the wrapped Int, so I want to expose getInt. I might end up with something like:\n module Lib ( PosInt(getInt), setInt) where data PosInt = PosInt { getInt :: Int } setInt :: Int -> Maybe PosInt setInt x | x > 0 = Just (PosInt x) | otherwise = Nothing \n Now if I try to construct a PosInt outside this module, the type checker complains:\n import Lib ( PosInt(..) ) test1 :: PosInt test1 = PosInt (-3) -- type error \n So far so good. But given a PosInt I can actually violate my invariance using the getInt field:\n import Lib ( PosInt(..) ) test2 :: PosInt -> PosInt test2 x = x { getInt = -3 } -- no type error \n That caught me a bit off guard. It's not a problem if I define getInt \"manually\":\n data PosInt = PosInt Int getInt :: PosInt -> Int getInt (PosInt x) = x \n Maybe I misunderstood the role of record fields.

I am very interested in this language but unfortunately I have not been able to find a proper environment to develop scala projects. I have tried Eclipse and failed because as soon as I install the necessary plugin for scala, the IDE no longer launches, I have tried installing Metals on Vs code, and it just fails to connect with the build server apparently, I can't afford Intellij and I think using the online sites is not an option for my project(too many files parallel programming etc.) and using the command line is out of the question (too much hassle, will definitely have trouble debugging, writing the code). I would like to have a program for development instead. Can anyone please help me out here?\n    submitted by    /u/Tsantakis  \n [link]   [comments]",

This extension is an O/R mapper built on top of the ScalikeJDBC core library, drawing significant inspiration from Ruby on Rails' ActiveRecord library. For instance, you can run the following query just with simple CRUDMapper class/object definition:\n ...\n Thank you to all the contributors for this release! 👍\n * u/jchyb helped u/seratch resolve Scala 3 compilation errors for scalikejdbc-orm module (#1249)\n * u/kardapoltsev resolved missing tags in one-to-x queries (#2163)\n * u/xuwei-k did a substantial amount of work for refactoring and dependency management\n  \nWhat is ScalikeJDBC ?\n  \nThis library seamlessly wraps JDBC APIs, offering intuitive and highly flexible functionalities. With QueryDSL, your code becomes inherently type-safe and reusable.\n ScalikeJDBC is not just practical; it’s production-ready. Utilize this library confidently in your real-world projects.\n  \nCongratulations to the ScalalikeJDBC author and all other contributors for the new release ! 👏\n    submitted by    /u/Previous_Pop6815  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have previously worked as Java Developer in the industry and have around 4 years of experience working on Spring Boot framework. However, recently I changed my company and my new company uses Scala as their main language for developing backend applications using Play framework. I have joined as a Software Developer here (not Data Engineer) in hope for learning something new in the field of Software Engineering. I have gone through numerous articles on how Scala skills are considered to be niche skill and has scope mostly in Big Data and Data Engineering roles. I would like to get your valuable insights regarding following concerns :\n  \nDoes learning the FP way of designing applications will help me in longer run in SE industry?\n How much emphasis should be given to learning languages or say new paradigm (I am considering Scala to be more complex than Java, maybe because I'm new to FP) when one's goal is to become a good software engineer?\n Regarding the job market for Scala, I don't see much hope in my region (India) other than DE roles. I am still interested in Software engineering but afraid that investing time in it will be helpful in future or not?\n On the extreme side, should I go back to hone my skills on Java ecosystem (prepare for next switch) or focus in learning Scala language and its ecosystem for maybe next 1-2 years and see if I like it or not? \n  \nI tried to keep my doubts as clear as possible.

          "description": "Hiya, just released this package that I was working on these past two days..\n It is a readwise integration for org-mode that will sync your readwise highlights into a org-format buffer or file.\n I use readwise heavily for highlights in both physical books and ebooks and have during the past year started using readwise reader heavily to annotate webpages and got so tired of not having a proper way to sync the highlights and notes into emacs. So I decided to just roll my own solution!\n There are quite a few quirks with the package right now, the main one being that it currently cleans the buffer and then repopulates it with the newly synced entries.. I am working for a smarter fix for this where it actually respects the buffer contents and just adds new highlights or modifies changed highlights to the correct entries, but I need to make this perfomant enough to not be a pain in the bottom to use..\n Well, here is the code! https://github.com/CountGreven/org-readwise I hope this helps some of you!\n    submitted by    /u/Fit_Advice8313  \n [link]   [comments]",

Unfortunately siunitx v.3 is not supported by mathjax v.3, or even worse, siunitx.js for mathjax is no longer maintained ( https://github.com/burnpanck/MathJax-siunitx ). As a consequence, equations containing siunitx commands are not displayed using mathjax, e.g. you still see\n \\begin{equation}\n \\left[ L \\right] = \\unit{\\ohm\\second} = \\unit{\\henry} \n \\end{equation} \n when previewing.\n Does anybody has some ideas to circumvent the problem by defining some dummy routines substituting the siunitx stuff, e.g. the display could be\n [L] = \\ohm\\second = \\henry\n or just\n [L] = \n Maybe even a secret siunitx.js v.3 is arround...\n    submitted by    /u/badkey212  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "After reading many posts on r/emacs and r/orgmode I've realized that there are a lot of people who could benefit from using Org Mode but don't know where to start. Either they don't use Emacs at all and thus find the prospect too daunting or they find it too difficult to craft Org Mode into something useful. And this is a real shame because Org Mode is, in my opinion, one of the most useful features of Emacs. So, to help out new users I've created a tutorial geared towards people who are completely new to Org Mode and Emacs. I've included screenshots to show you what to expect as well as a configuration file you can drop in that will give you all the features described in the tutorial. Additionally, there is an org file with explanations of each element, so new users can more easily begin customizing their setup.\n I would encourage any new users to try it out and see if this helps you. For the Org Mode veterans in the crowd, I would appreciate any feedback you might have. \n You can find my tutorial on github here: Org Mode Better Defaults\n    submitted by    /u/he-who-greps  \n [link]   [comments]",

The problems still persisted.\n I removed the GC setting for quite some time, but the noticeable slowdown during editing made be return to GCMH.

I must admit, the division between my dailies and other notes is not well done... but it is how I am working now.\n I would like to have the possibility when the point is on a date (for instance 2024-05-22) to create a link in my dailies to the current heading, to the proper daily note if existing, or to a new daily note if not (under a predefined subheading)\n With the help of chatgpt (sorry, no dev here), I have this code:\n ``` (defun my-org-roam-dailies-goto-date-at-point () \"Create or open an Org-roam daily note for the date at point. If the daily note already exists, add a new heading.\" (interactive) (let ((date (or (thing-at-point 'date) (format-time-string \"%Y-%m-%d\" (org-read-date nil t))))) (if date (let ((parsed-date (org-read-date nil t date))) (org-roam-dailies-goto-date parsed-date) (when (derived-mode-p 'org-mode) (goto-char (point-max)) (unless (bolp) (insert \"\\n\")) (insert \"* \"))) (message \"No date found at point.\"))))\n (define-prefix-command 'org-roam-map) (global-set-key (kbd \"C-c n\") 'org-roam-map)\n (with-eval-after-load 'org-roam (define-key org-roam-map (kbd \"d\") 'my-org-roam-dailies-goto-date-at-point)) ```\n 2 problems I see: 1. I want to use a keybinding when the point is on a date to create the link ==> I am not sure the latest part for the creation is OK and that the proper keymap is chosen\n  \nSo far, instead of reading the date at point to create the daily note or insert the link into an existing one, it uses the function org-roam-dailies-goto-date which asks again for a date from the calendar. \n  \nhow would you improve this function? thanks for your ideas!\n    submitted by    /u/fmou67  \n [link]   [comments]",

However, one annoying point is that the keybinding styles of these two editors are inconsistent.\n For example, in VSCode:\n  \nCtrl-z -> undo\n Ctrl-x -> cut\n Ctrl-c -> copy\n Ctrl-v -> paste\n  \nWhile in Emacs, Ctrl-x and Ctrl-c keys are used as prefix keys (C-x, C-c) for most of Emacs' built-in commands.\n One way to keep they consistent is to use CUA-mode, but its implementation is quite tricky (e.g., cua-prefix-override-inhibit-delay = 0.2), so I'm not very keen on using it.\n Are there any alternatives to CUA-Mode?\n One possibility I can think of is the Windows Key. \n For example, \n  \nUse the Windows Key on the keyboard as Emacs' Control key, which means that the original C-x prefix can be pressed by the Windows Key (you might say that \"the prefix key C-x\" now is actually \"prefix key s-x\", but keep in mind it is handled underhood); \n At the same time, use the Ctrl key on the keyboard as Emacs' Super Key, which means I can bind custom commands to the Super Key.\n  \nIf this works, I can define a clean \"cut operation\" like: \n  (global-set-key (kbd \"s-x\") 'kill-region) ; Note here the `s` is actual Ctrl Key not Win Key (Super Key) on keyboard \n It won't affect prefix key such as C-x, because C-x is now driven by the Windows key.\n Is this possible in Emacs?

The important pieces from that are:\n ``` [Service] Type=notify ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/emacs --fg-daemon\n [Install] WantedBy=default.target ```\n Anyway, it's been great for a long time. I have gnome open up a emacsclient in a new frame when I want to open emacs and boom, it is up instantly.\n The one thing that I didn't realize might be related and I ignored for a long time... When I use xwidget-webkit-browse-url it shows a blank white screen. When I use emacs directly (instead of through an emacsclient from the instance started by systemd), it works properly.\n I get the following error when I do a systemctl --user status emacs:\n  May 18 21:30:31 work-dev emacs[3306]: ../../../../../gdk/x11/gdkwindow-x11.c:5653 drawable is not a native X11 window May 18 21:30:31 work-dev emacs[3306]: ../../../../../gdk/x11/gdkwindow-x11.c:5653 drawable is not a native X11 window May 18 21:30:31 work-dev WebKitWebProces[19150]: cannot open display: \n I assumed that maybe it was an issue where $DISPLAY wasn't set properly so I did M-x setenv and set DISPLAY to :1 (same as what I found from a terminal emulator) and no luck.

It isn't advanced enough to require parameters yet. It also executes successfully if I type ./my_lsp in a terminal. It produceses a log file to confirm this. Is that not the path it means? I tried adding it to my Linux path with a source command but it didn't change anything. \n Second, does the fact that it's in fundamental mode matter if I'm using the regex syntax to add to lsp-language-id-config?

However, I noticed that I can't find stuff if it is capitalised or in allcaps. This is not good, because I thus overlook stuff I'd want to find in a buffer.\n I tried tweaking ISEARCH-related variables, but to no apparent avail. I also tried delving into the source code, but I did not really understand how CONSULT-LINE produces its results.\n Can you tell me which variables I need to tweak for consult-line to be case-insensitive when searching?\n Have a good day, fellows :)\n    submitted by    /u/olivuser  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I wanted to make a package, mostly for myself, where I could have a bunch of org files that I would use as templates for projects.\n Let's say you want to create a C project. The org file would contain code blocks with a basic hello world file in the src folder, and a basic Makefile or something. The package could also be asked to create a git repo or whatever else you want. You would then call a function, select one of the project templates, be prompted for any optional argument the template may have (like libraries maybe) and create the project structure by tangling the source blocks.\n I managed to make this work, but I hit quite a bothersome snag in the road.\n Makefiles NEED tabs to work. And org discards tabs when tangling, replacing them with 4 spaces.\n I have no way to make this work seamlessly. I can set org-src-preserve-indentation but that makes it so the two space margin added to source block for styling is also included in the final file, so I need to make them all not have this margin, which sucks.\n It also means I need a way to set this variable not only when tangling, but also when editing so org doesn't discard the tab there as well. I made it a file local variable, but it's considered risky so you are prompted to apply it, which is annoying as hell.\n This thing just killed my idea, because I don't like the compromises just for ONE single file type.\n BTW I do know of skeletor's existence, but I think it tries to do too much and ends up being quite bothersome, constantly needing external tools, and not even using built in features like completing-read, and instead rolling its own.\n    submitted by    /u/Guiding2011  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Dear Emacs veterans,\n I encountered a situation like the following. I am working on a project and a tool is used when building the project. The tool requires me to add a line in my `.bashrc` which `source` a script file that does something and source another three files. This means without sourcing the file, that tool is not usable from command line and I can't build the project. Recently, I am learning to use \"compile\" command of Emacs to work on this project. I found because that tool needs that sourcing of the script, I can't simply make use of the tool with \"compile\" command.\n One possibility is to dig through all the scripts involved, figured out what they do, and somehow set them up manually in some fixed way, but this would be a tedious work, also, it'd be not reliable after I upgrade the tool in the future.\n Currently, my solution is that I use `bash -i -c 'the_tool params..'` instead of `the_tool params...`. Although this works for me for the case at the moment, it's not very handy, and I wonder what the better solutions out there that experienced Emacs users will do.\n It seems I can also make Emacs source my `.bashrc` when Emacs starts, but I am not sure if I want to source `.bashrc` every time my Emacs loads, because this tool is only needed for doing a particular type of project development.\n I wonder what would you guys do for this situation. Thanks in advance for you input.\n P. S. I didn't say the name of the tool with an intention that I want to know ways to deal with this as a general situation, instead of learning for example, that a package exists that is for this tool for this situation.\n    submitted by    /u/qiattsik  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I'm trying to figure out how to use org-mode and org-brain together as data management. The extension of the org-mode headings hierarchy into a graph (parent-child-friend) with org-brain is great for me. But now I'm needing something very data-intensive, in my case I need to create an inventory which will easily have thousands of items. I am working for an apartment complex and I need a way to inventory all the fixed and non-fixed assets. I don't want to just go with a relational database or even a spreadsheet. Yes, org-mode/brain is text- and file-based, so each inventory item will be a separate file or heading in a file, but I don't want even more separate files and/or headings for each inventory item's details. One idea I had was to create a lisp defvar symbol for each inventory item (e.g., screens, garden hose, picnic table, etc.) and have a list (a-/p-) assigned to the variable with additional info, e.g., '((size xxx) (count 10)...). But then I've got a huge amount of global variables going on in an Emacs session. This seems impractical, but, hey, I've seen crazy data management stuff done in Emacs lisp.\n Another idea is to do the items as org-mode/brain files or headings, then put item details in an org-mode table -- and rely on the whole org table ecosystem. Another idea is have item details in a custom drawer in a file or under a heading. Another is have very broad inventory categories as variables, then attach huge lists of lists of lists to each variable. (e.g., custom-set-variables in my init file with hundreds of lists.) In general, the Lisp world is wont to leverage the abstract syntax tree, and org-element is there to help with that.

A big benefit Emacs Org Mode seems to be the built in functionality for things like tasks and times, but that can be done in Obsidian with plugins like Dataview, for every other functionality Org Mode has like that can be done with an Obsidian plugin. I've also read a lot of comments that you can make your own Org Mode functionality using Elisp, Obsidian OTOH uses JS for plugins and code snippets, and I've written a handful of my own snippets. the JS library ecosystem is much larger.\n I get that Emacs has been around for much longer and the Lindy Effect where things that have lasted a long time are likely to last for much longer, however there seems to be far less support for Org outside of Emacs (besides Neorg). OTOH there are many Markdown editors and libraries, so if I decide I want to switch from Obsidian then I could and my Markdown Notes would render fine. I have many notes and don't have much proprietary Markdown in them. What if I became heavily invested in Emacs but in the future felt like using another editor? Or the slim possibility of Emacs development eventually stopping? A lot of Org Mode functionality seems to be specific to Emacs / Emacs' environment (same thing Obsidian JS really). I read one comment saying that implementations outside of Emacs are half baked, like support for Vim motions and features outside of Vim and Neovim.\n I've been spending lots of time setting up Neovim, and right now I'm thinking of using that with Obsidian for Markdown editing with Vim motions.

This leaves a massive papertrail on the machine which I'd like to avoid, instead staying connected for as long as I'd like.\n I already checked my SSH-settings and don't have these kinds of problems when I am connecting via SSH regularly, which leads me to believe that this is related to Emacs/TRAMP. I have tried to set the ssh session timeout to nil via `(add-to-list 'tramp-connection-properties '(\"/ssh:\" \"session-timeout\" nil))` but so far it does not seem to yield the desired result.\n The setup in which I work features a jump host, so that I connect via SSH twice (once to the jump host, than to my actual destination). I have adapted the SSH `ServerAliveInterval` accordingly on both machines, to no avail.\n Do you guys have another tip on how to configure TRAMP so as to make it work as desired?

          "description": "So, I'm an outsider: resident vim user. But more relevantly, I'm an online game developer. One thing I've just noticed is that unlike Emacs, the Vim community has a healthy collection of online vim games: VimAdventures, VimGolf, Vim-Racer (my personal favourite with lots of bias) etc.\n The idea just dawned on me that it would be a really low lift to add support for emacs in vim-racer. I'm curious if there would be any interest in an online game for emacs. The game is based around navigating code/text, and your speed determines where you place on the leaderboard.\n Is the lack of online games just a community culture difference i.e. Emacs users just aren't interested in emacs based games, or would you play a game like vim-racer if it had support for emacs?\n    submitted by    /u/Crippledupdown  \n [link]   [comments]",

I was wondering if there is an equivalent in emacs.\n On a related note, I want the same for URLs, similar to https://github.com/dequis/tmux-url-select \n I was thinking there might already be something in emacs, or perhaps I could achieve this with Hyperbole or some other plugin, but so far could not figure it out. It should not be too hard to script this (I guess you only need to search the buffer for certain regular expressions and then allow the user to select / act on them), but I do not want to reinvent the wheel here. Any ideas?\n Thanks\n    submitted by    /u/bullpup1337  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I write a lot of math heavy documents in org-mode and inline latex fragments really irritate my aesthetic sense. They aren't incorporated into the text smoothly like in a real latex document; when the math has sub and/or superscripts it gets a vertical offset relative to the main text and the font doesn't match the main text either. Equation environments are not as bad, the difference compared to the main text is less obvious there.\n I had the idea to solve this problem using unicode math. There are unicode symbols for basically everything math related, and they blend into the main text nicely, even the sub and superscripts. I managed to set up org-mode to latex export to work with unicode math using the answers in https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/20062/exporting-unicode-characters-to-pdf-using-latex-from-org-mode . The only remaining question is how to write unicode math efficiently.\n I have a nice latex setup that mostly relies on abbrevs and yasnippets. It is very straightforward to set up analogous abbrevs/snippets for common unicode math symbols in org-mode, problems only come when I try to implement sub and superscripts. These work in a completely different way in unicode. Instead of having to surround things with {} or _{}, there are separate sub and superscript versions of many symbols. Should I just make sub and superscript versions for each of my snippets + all the regular letters and numbers? There has to be a simpler way. I also came across the package https://github.com/astoff/unicode-math-input.el that seems to do somethings similar to what I want, however it does nothing about the sub/superscript problem.\n    submitted by    /u/acosmicjoke  \n [link]   [comments]",

It provides REPL driven development experience for Scala.\n It automatically detects the project root by simply searching for build.sbt or build.sc files in the current folder and its ancestors, till the root folder. When nothing is found, it will simply invoke scala-cli. The command to run when a project is (not) found is configurable.\n I have been using it myself for multiple weeks and am pretty satisfied with it.\n You are more than welcome to try it out and comment out any issues. :-)\n P.S. One thing I have not yet achieved is the ability to hot-reload the application like Common Lisp SLIME/SLY.

          "description": "I spent a lot of time reading and thinking about if I want to learn Emacs or Vim since they have very high learning curves, I went with Vim because I had been looking a way to better edit text. Vim's modal editing is very powerful, allowing me to make lots of changes to text with only a handful of keystrokes. I wonder if that's why most Vim and Neovim users chose it over Emacs and if that's why Vim is much more popular than Emacs.\n Emacs is a modeless editor and you need a third party emulation like Evil mode for modal editing, but that's not full Vim. You wouldn't be able to install Vim or Neovim plugin, especially ones that extend its modal editing capabilities like the Vim surround plugin. Perhaps it might be possible to use the headless Neovim backend for text editing in Emacs, like the VS Code Neovim extension or Firenvim Firefox addon does, but why do that when you could just use Neovim?\n I think that all the extensibility Emacs has to make it essentially an app platform alone isn't something that appeals to a lot of users, but what if Emacs had modal editing as good as Vi / Vim's from the start? It seems like Vi Vim and even Neovim never had the level of extensibility as Emacs does, so what if it was a matter of picking between a modal editor, and a modal editor with lots of extensibility? (an oversimplified hypothetical comparison but still).\n And by the way, what was the rationale for the decision of Emacs to be a modeless editor rather than a modal editor?\n    submitted by    /u/TheTwelveYearOld  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "When I met my husband 10 yrs ago, he was everything I ever wanted. We met on a freenode IRC channel. He was a Gentoo and Linux-from-scratch dual-booter who could install both systems with his eyes closed. We used to have long, romantic conversations well past midnight about tabs vs spaces and open source. Our first fight ever was about MIT vs GPL licensing. On our first date, we shared our tiling manager config files with each other (this was the first time I truly felt love for a man).\n However, lately he’s changed into a husk of the man he used to be. He migrated to Linux Mint, because, and I quote, he “just wants to get work done” and he “no longer has time to fiddle with [his] system”. Then, he started using GNOME for the same reason. This was already very suspicious. I mean, if he truly just wanted to start using a full DE, he could have at least picked KDE, right? Even Xfce I’d have been ok with.\n Then, the other day, our relationship hit a breaking point. Here I was, working on my 2012 NixOS thinkpad, and hubby calls me over to his office. He said he “wanted to show me something”. I sit down on his chair, and you can imagine my terror as he pulls up vim on his terminal. He had a weird smile on his face, as if something had taken him over. He spent the next few mins “showing off” a variety of vim tricks he’d just learned. I had to turn my face to the side so he wouldn’t see the tears drying on my cheeks. Let me be clear: This was NOT the man I married.\n Our relationship has had its ups and downs, but I never imagined my husband would stoop so low as to become a vim peasant. I don’t know what to do. Part me says I should just start divorce proceedings and get it over with, but the other part can’t help but wonder if perhaps my husband is being afflicted by some serious, undiagnosed mental illness.\n Please advise reddit, my whole life is in shambles and I don’t know what to do\n    submitted by    /u/gentoogirl  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm sorry not using it for more than those 2 things, please have mercy with me. \n So back to my idea. That email \"client\", well actually it is just a viewer, the receiving and sending part would have to be done with offlineimap, sendmail and friends:\n  \nthere are different orgmode files, e.g. ~/org/mail/inbox.org, ~/org/mail/sent.org, ~/org/mail/drafts.org and all of them contain headlines which actually are emails, but they are just rendered as headlines.\n The headline includes the subject, but could also include some state such as READ or SENT\n The body is the text of the email\n Attachments? Use org attachment to add them\n Maybe we could also use properties for recipients or use the tags, I'm unsure about this one \n a scheduler would iterate over those files every few minutes/hours and actually sends that email (headline) \n you can archive an email, which would actually just refile it, or you could also move things around like refiling\n I don't know if you can partially set some parts of the buffer to be read only, I don't know if it would make sense to set all those files to be read only, hmm\n use org capture templates to write a new email, depending on the cursor position it would either be a reply or new mail\n  \n   submitted by    /u/Valuable-Date-896  \n [link]   [comments]",

Tested with a Python code base and a C code base. In other consult cases, the narrowing feature works perfectly (consult-buffer, consult-org, consult-flymake). I don't know since when it does not work for consult-imenu because I discovered the narrowing feature in consult only a few months ago, and only got the opportunity to try the feature on a code base/consult-imenu since yesterday. Anyone else is having this behavior ?\n I can open an issue on Github if needed. I didn't do it yet because the code for consult-imenu has not changed for 4 months, and since I could not find any complaint about this, I suspect it might be related to my personal setup. So I wanted to probe the community first before bothering minad.\n My setup\n  \nEmacs 29.3, compiled by myself\n consult version 20240420.929, from Melpa\n  \nThe steps to reproduce the issue\n  \nopen a Python or C file in Emacs, with a lot of functions and variable\n hit M-x consult-imenu\n a nice, searchable, consult prompt shows up with all the functions/modules/variable tagged appropriately\n hit the narrow key (< in my case)\n  \nExpected result\n There should be either a which-key frame showing the next key to type, or, if I'm quick enough, either I should be able to type f, and according to the consult-imenu code, it should filter on the functions only.\n Actual result\n < or <f are taken literally, like a conventional search pattern.\n    submitted by    /u/tutux84  \n [link]   [comments]",

I used to write (too many) jupyter notebooks with VSCode but I find that I can organize my code & notes better with org documents and just simple Python files. I started using emacs-jupyter after reading Martí Bosch's blog on the topic. My current workflow is just opening up a python file (or write a new one), then running `jupyter-run-repl` and then `jupyter-repl-associate-buffer`. Then I do execute a region or execute line-by-line via `jupyter-eval-line-or-region` bound to `C-c C-c`. The thing with this workflow is that the jupyter REPL gets quite long as I'm tweaking little things about the graphs or visualization I'm working on. Is there a better workflow that people use for doing this kind of work? I also can't find a way to clear the jupyter REPL that I'm working on. \n    submitted by    /u/PlasmidPirate  \n [link]   [comments]",

But curious what other editors can also do this, and how they compare in abilities?\n 4) Amongst the variants of emacs, which is best for this? For my use case it needs to work just as well on Windows as Linux.\n 5) Also feel free to share any personal anecdotes on what discovering this paradigm meant to you personally. \n Including where you've seen big improvements in usability/efficiency etc\n And maybe also were there any specific use cases where you over-estimated how useful it would be?

          "description": "I am going through the Emacs Lisp Intro manual to consolidate my Elisp knowledge. In the \"More Complex\" section, the function \"copy-to-buffer\" is suggested as a case study. I will include it here for your reference:\n (defun copy-to-buffer (buffer start end) \"Copy to specified BUFFER the text of the region.\" (interactive \"BCopy to buffer: \\nr\") (let ((oldbuf (current-buffer))) (with-current-buffer (get-buffer-create buffer) (barf-if-buffer-read-only) (erase-buffer) (save-excursion (insert-buffer-substring oldbuf start end))))) \n Perhaps I do not understand well how the save-excursion works. But, since we are setting temporarily the current buffer to the \"buffer\" argument by using the \"with-current-buffer\", and we are erasing its contents with \"erase-buffer\", why do we use \"save-excursion\"?\n After we use \"erase-buffer\" don't we get point, point-min and point-max set to 1?\n It seems to me that it is just redundant to save the excursion inside the empty buffer when all the points have the value 1. Then why do we do that?\n Thank you very much.\n EDIT: I think that I understand the reason of save-excursion in this case. It is a user-friendly feature. It ensures that after pasting the text in the empty buffer, the point is set back to the value 1. I guess it is a just to avoid confusing the user by having the point set to point-max. When the user switches to the buffer where the selection was pasted, the users will see the beginning of the buffer instead of the end. Please feel free to correct me if you have a better explanation.\n    submitted by    /u/AkiNoHotoke  \n [link]   [comments]",

To simplify things, she has started to develop arthritis-like symptoms that will get progressively worse, and she will lose her vision over time. \n She's not very technical, but I know there are a lot of interesting ergonomics modes like xah-fly-keys, or even just spacemacs style bindings with a leader key. I'd love some recommendations for relatively easy to learn ergonomics systems that might be less intimidating to newer users. Right now I'm leaning towards spacemacs because that seems the easiest way for someone who would probably be pretty put off by editing an init.el right out of the gate. \n I also thought that over time she could augment this with speech to text as well as text to speech. I know that there are a number of emacs tools like emacsspeak, but I remember seeing a video on youtube where someone had some hooks into a google text to speech library, and was using ai to send audio clips to chat gpt.If that rings a bell for anyone, please let me know what they were using. I haven't been able to find it, but I'd love any other recommendations or thoughts there as well. \n Anyway, thanks in advance!\n    submitted by    /u/nickbernstein  \n [link]   [comments]",

If you've already upgraded tree-sitter, either a) roll back to v0.22.2, or b) rebuild Emacs. If you use a package manager, uninstalling and reinstalling Emacs should rebuild Emacs.\n The latest version of tree-sitter library is binary-incompatible with the previous version, but the ABI version remains unchanged. That means package managers will simply replace the old libtree-sitter.so file with the new one. Then when Emacs runs, this binary-incompatible libtree-sitter.so is loaded and crashes Emacs.\n What should've happened is for tree-sitter to bump the ABI version; then package managers would install the new libtree-sitter.so file alongside the old libtree-sitter.so, rather than replacing it. And Emacs will still load the old libtree-sitter.so. \n Rebuilding Emacs will resolve this issue since Emacs and tree-sitter remain compatible on the source level. Rebuild the Emacs binary and it'll be compatible with the new tree-sitter binary.\n Source: https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter/issues/3296\n (I'll note that please don't reply in the GitHub issue unless you have constructive things to add.)\n    submitted by    /u/casouri  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "TLDR: I'm trying to change the color of the cursor according to the enabled theme, but the color of the cursor don't change when I start Emacs.\n Just to give a little of context I'm a web dev an currently working with a lot of css code. Emacs has a css-mode that change the background of the face of color codes meaning a { background-color: #fff } will have the #fff with a white background (just like the rainbow-mode package does). \n The thins is that my cursor often get lost in certain color and I don't like that so I decided to write a little of elisp to fix this (realice that a white or black cursor does the job). Also forgot to mention that I switch a lot between dark and light themes so I figure that I need to change the cursor color according to that. Doing my research came across to this https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/modus-themes/A-theme_002dagnostic-hook-for-theme-loading.html and this helped me to do the part of calling the function to change the color when I change of theme. \n Everything work fine until I restart Emacs or open Emacs for the first time (like when I turn on my computer on my job) because the color of the cursor don't change when Emacs start so I'm a little lost here and I'm not sure if I missing something. \n Also I'm checking the *messages* buffers and appears that the function load correctly so.... \n Here is the code I'm using:\n (defvar after-enable-theme-hook nil \"Hook to run after enabling a theme.\") (defun run-after-enable-theme-hook (&rest _args) \"Run `after-enable-theme-hook'.\" (message \"executin hook after-enable-theme-hook\") (run-hooks 'after-enable-theme-hook) (let* ((color-mode (frame-parameter nil 'background-mode)) (cursor-color (if (eq color-mode 'dark) \"red\" nil))) (set-face-attribute 'cursor nil :background cursor-color))) (advice-add 'enable-theme :after #'run-after-enable-theme-hook) \n (load-theme 'gruvbox-dark-hard)\n ​\n    submitted by    /u/L-ui  \n [link]   [comments]",

But with Org-Mode, Roam/Denote, Magit, Dired and Terminal things, i'm not sure how many functions i want to bind to keybinds.\n Thing is, keybinds are only quicker, if you remember them. If you need to search through which-key, just `M-x` and searching is faster. So, do you tend to create keybinds for most things in the packages you use? Or just for the one or two things you use multiple times a day and search for the rest?\n Additionally, maybe someone can give me a hint if this is possible: Can i come up with a sort of \"custom Command Palette\"? So, like `M-x` but it should only contain commands is specifiy?

But first, I need to figure out the simple one. \n Why is it skipping the first step?\n  \nAdditional notes:\n er/mark-word and er/mark-paragraph are defined in expand-region code. er/mark-eol and er/mark-bol are my custom functions, and they seem to be working just fine, at least when they are called directly, and not via er/expand-region.

          "description": "Hi all,\n I am a new emacs user so please bear with me. I was setting up org-roam so I can have all my files from different categories linked if there is a relationship. For example, if I have a journal entry that talked about a philosophical topic in application to my life, I want it to link to one of my studies of that topic that is part of the philosophy category. Essentially, I want to map my brain. \n In order to keep my files organized, I was planning on keeping my files for each topic in a completely separate directories from the Org-roam directory. I would have an org file in the Org-roam directory that links to that particular file and if there is a relationship, I would just link the org files in the Org-roam directory. In other words, the org files in the Org-roam directory simply contains links to the actual files in my file system and serves as the linker. \n To organize my files in my file system, I plan on using the denote package for its file naming scheme.\n How does this setup sound? Are there any better setup designs that you can recommend? I was thinking about just using denote, but I like the org-roam-ui and I would like to keep everything in separate dirs. However, if this setup is not feasible then I might do that instead.\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/victorian_cross  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I read a lot about the 'Folgezettel' approach, and like it very much, especially because it emphasizes a structure that represents the chain and order of thought and reflection over a purely formal, taxonomic structure, as described for instance in Folgezettel is not an Outline.\nNevertheless, a formal, taxonomic dimension is, obviously, also not completely absent. When I branch of from 1a into 1a1, it also normally means, that 1a1 (and 1a2,...) provides analysis of greater details of 1a1, which now becomes the main context for all the children. It does not only mean that I got back to the topic of 1a later, while I had made notes about different topics in 1b and 1c in between. Thus, it seems to me there is a playful tension between a formal structure (topic, subtopic, detail and so forth) …",

I was intrigued, and spent some time reading and researching about it, but I just couldn't visualize how it actually worked.\nThen last fall I was helping my wife find a replacement for Evernote for her recipes, and discovered Obsidian. (It was more than she needed, she went with SimpleNote) but I was intrigued by the idea of linked notes. I downloaded it, watched some videos and started putting stuff in it. I had used various programs before, but they ended up just becoming archives of stuff, and not really useful for production of ideas. I'm working to not fall in that trap this time.\nProbably the two most helpful things for me have been Sonke Ahren's book and a few videos by Morgan Eau on YouTube. This is a great place to start \nI am going back to school after retiring, entering a doctorate program. That's a bit intimidating at 53. I've got a couple of masters, but it's been a while.

          "description": "Many note-taking apps like Obsidian provide the graph view functionality to visualize the relation of notes. But this kind of graph view only bases on linkages/references(incoming links and outgoing links) between notes. It is hard to recognize a specific long COT(chain of thoughts)——the starting point, the path and the end. Different COTs crossing in the graph view makes it more chaotic.\nLuhmann's zettelkasten is a \"combination of disorder and order, of clustering and unpredictable combinations emerging from ad hoc selection.\"\nThe graph view(generated by linkages/references) in some ways can represent the aspect of disorder of a zettelkasten. But what is the aspect of order?\n\"The absence of a fixed system of order and, in consequence, a table of contents turned the index into the key tool for using the file – how else should one be able to find certain notes again and thus gain access to the system of references? Not wanting to rely on pure chance requires being able to identify at least one point from which the respective web of references can be accessed. This is the purpose of the keyword index.\"\nBase on my understanding, the aspect of order in Luhmann's zettelkasten is composed of his note IDs and keyword index(register).\nAs so far, I don't find any note-taking apps provide the graph view functionality basing on Luhmann-style IDs and his keyword index——And this is why I created a new Obsidian plugin \"zettelkasten navigation\" recently. I think this plugin , in some ways, represents the real Luhmann way to retrive thoughts and navigate notes in a digital zettelkasten. The other note-taking apps should provide the similar functionality as well in future.\nShowcase:",
