I have a shell script that converts these into HTML files using Pandoc (because what kind of Haskell enthusiast would I be if I didn't use Pandoc!).\n I am using the Haskell library to make filters for my Pandoc, and I see I can use multiple instances of --filter but I would rather not and just have my one filter do everything I need. Lets say I wanted to do something to any Inline Str instance that starts with a @ and I also want to act on any Block Codeblock instance that is a $haskell type: ```haskell module Main where\n import qualified Data.Text as T import Text.Pandoc.JSON\n main :: IO () main = do -- toJSONFilter dollarHaskellBlock toJSONFilter linkToBlog return ()\n -- | Lets me act specially on codeblocks labeled '$haskell' dollarHaskellBlock :: Block -> Block dollarHaskellBlock (CodeBlock (identifier, cls:clss, keyValue) codeText) | cls == T.pack \"$haskell\" = CodeBlock (identifier, T.pack \"haskell\":clss, keyValue) newCodeText where newCodeText = codeText -- do something here dollarHaskellBlock x = x\n -- | adds a link to any blog with a word in the form @word linkToBlog :: Inline -> Inline linkToBlog (Str strText) | head strString == '@' = linkTo where strString = T.unpack strText linkTo = Link ( T.empty , [] , [] ) [ Underline [ Str (T.tail strText) ] ] ( T.pack (\"./\" ++ (tail . T.unpack . T.toLower) strText ++ \".html\") , T.empty ) linkToBlog x = x ```\n In this case I can use one or the other here and the executable will act as a filter, but I feel like I should be able to do one after the other, but just running both in the do block fails :(.\n Is there a solution here? Thanks. \n P.S. If you don't know what I am talking about here, IT IS GREAT, and you should totally check out Pandoc and Pandoc FIlters.\n    submitted by    /u/El__Robot  \n [link]   [comments]",

Of course, I am using current time just for the sake of the example; it can be any other function that the module does not need to know about.\n I know that Haskell allows that, but would warn about orphan instances. For that purpose, I followed the GHC compiler advice and used the wrapped type; although I liked the code better with orphan instance.\n I wonder—what would be the better way to implement such StopWatch?

          "description": "Sorry for verbose, detail is here.\n At first, I'm reading https://okmij.org/ftp/Haskell/extensible/more.pdf to understand \"Free monad\". I mean the word FFree in title is from this paper.\n And maybe I have been able to understand what is FFree in this paper. This paper says FFree is a data type which has two aspects Pure and Impure, especially Impure works as an action handler like monad's >>= and it presents fmap. I think that FFree seems very simple and reasonable.\n So I implemented FFree monad as written in the paper. ```haskell {-# LANGUAGE GADTs #-} import Control.Monad ((>=>)) data FFree f a where Pure :: a -> FFree f a Impure :: f x -> (x -> FFree f a) -> FFree f a\n instance Monad (FFree f) where Impure fx k' >>= k = Impure fx (k' >=> k) Pure a >>= k = k a ```\n And I need Functor and Applicative for Monad instance.\n ```haskell instance Functor (FFree f) where fmap f (Pure a) = Pure (f a) -- Continuous is here, impressible. fmap f (Impure fx k) = Impure fx (fmap f . k)\n instance Applicative (FFree f) where pure = Pure Pure f <> Pure a = Pure (f a) Pure f <> Impure fx k = Impure fx (fmap f . k) Impure fx f <> p@(Pure _) = Impure fx (\\x -> f x <> p) -- I have no idea how implement this pattern. Impure fx f <> Impure gx g = undefined `` I could writeFunctorwith no problem (maybe), but I couldn't write<>implementation betweenImpurecase. Here is my question again, how do I implementFFree` of Applicative?\n From the first, What does Applicative applying between Impure mean theoretically?\n P.S. No need to ensure what a compiler says, I know why I can't it. Left hand f x and right hand one are rigid types each other.\n    submitted by    /u/Unique-Staff-7593  \n [link]   [comments]",

During syntax analysis, it was easy to keep track of the line and column numbers where the parsing failed and report back what was expected and what the compiler needed. \n But if the parsing succeeds, the generated AST is passed on to check the semantics. However, my AST nodes do not store any positional (or spanning) information. So if I find a semantic error, I can only tell what the error is but cannot provide any line or column number information.\n The easiest way to solve this is to store the spanning information on most nodes I have defined, which is tedious and lengthy.

Coming from C++ background, I understand \"built-in\" as constructs recognizable by compiler without including external libraries. In Haskell however I see in many literature sources, types like Int|Num| Bool, are treated as \"built-in\", or core language features, though they can be easily \"excluded\", by disabling Prelude module, which in my understanding is just external \"library\" included by default. To add to confusion, some core language constructs, like guards will not even work without including Prelude. On other hand constructs like \n import Prelude() \n foo x = 1\n compiles well, but then what is the \"1\" type in this case (Isn't Num defined by including Prelude)?\n So I guess the question is - Where true (in C++ sense) bult-in language features can be found if at all. And should Prelude be understood as true external library or as \"grey area\" combining both traits of external library and compiler intrinsic syntax. \n    submitted by    /u/klazklaz  \n [link]   [comments]",

Error: cabal: Could not resolve dependencies: [__0] next goal: wlhs-bindings (user goal) [__0] rejecting: wlhs-bindings-0.1.0 (conflict: pkg-config package wayland-server-any, not found in the pkg-config database) [__0] fail (backjumping, conflict set: wlhs-bindings) After searching the rest of the dependency tree exhaustively, these were the goals I've had most trouble fulfilling: wlhs-bindings \n Despite the error message saying that wayland-server is ‘not found in the pkg-config database’, it clearly is present on my system:\n $ pkg-config --modversion wayland-server 1.22.0 \n What makes this strange is how suddenly it stopped working. Two days ago, I couldn’t build wlhs; the day before, I could. (Or at least, I have no memory of it failing before that.) Does anyone have any ideas around how to fix this problem?\n For reference, I’m using pkgconf-2.1.0. (Installed on December 7, so that hasn’t changed recently.) I have also tested several Cabal versions: it fails with 3.10.2.1 and 3.10.1.0, as well as current HEAD. It does succeed with cabal-3.6.2.0, but that version is unusable for me as it can’t handle my custom Setup.hs. I’m running EndeavourOS, which is a variant of Arch Linux.\n    submitted by    /u/brdrcn  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi, feel free to guide me out but I have a strong feeling Haskellers already have this figured out.\n I'm a python programmer coming from research background. I fell in love with programming and functional programming always had this allure for me. I have read quite a bit on functional programming, Bartoz Milewskis \"Category theory for programmers\" and doing the haskell.mooc.fi\n To learn the things actually, I started writing a simplified version of card game Dominion with python and trying to use pseudo-Haskell approach. Why? I'm more fluent in python for now (especially IO) and a game like Dominion is inherently stateful so I thought this would be a good practice.\n I have record (dataclass in python) called playerState which contains deck, hand, discarcd_pile i.e. things that model individual player. For now, I have a gameState that contains a list of playerStates and central_supply that is global for all players.\n All card effects are pure, often partial functions effect::playerState, someArg->playerState. For example draw::playerState -> num_cards -> playerState. Here is an example of a card that draws one card and gains one card: gainDraw = Card( name=\"Gain Victory point and draw 1 card\", card_type=\"Action\", cost=2, effects=[gain victoryCard, draw 1], ). Now the \"cool part\" is that I have a function play_card:: playerState -> Card -> playerState that simply composes all effects of a card to one single composite function and applies it to playerState. Playing one card is then one elegant transition from state1 to state2 with no intermediary assigments etc. So far so good.\n Now the problem: some card effects modify also the global gameState and not just fields in playerState. Essentially I have globalState containing localStates. What is a common solution in Haskell or in functional paradigm in general to handle nested states? A whole different architecture, lifting types? You can be harsh and say that my domain(ion, sorry had to) modeling is all wrong.\n    submitted by    /u/SkyrPudding  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "One of Haskell's arguably most important and interesting features is lazy evaluation.\n As a novice / intermediate (I started learning Haskell about a year ago and am really enjoying it!), I still can't explain the advantages of lazy evaluation in real world applications. \n After a bit of duckduckgoing, the first benefit that is often mentioned is the ability to create infinite data structures. While that is certainly interesting and fun to work with, it feels somewhat gimmicky to me. As mentioned, I am a novice, so I wonder, are infinite data structures a feature you regularly use in real world applications, and are they important in these applications? By that I mean that they are clearly better to use in that position than code without the infinite data structure?\n Another benefit that is often mentioned is the possibility to define control structures in normal code. To my understanding, this is the case for many monad combinators such as when or replicateM, and so on. Again I wonder how relevant this is in real applications, as most programming languages suffice with a few basic control structures.\n Furthermore, it seems that the monadic control structures still require the do notation to be useful, which is not defined in normal code, and when defining control structures for a new type class (such as arrows), new syntax defined outside of normal code is still required, as arrows seem to have their own special variant of do notation.\n Finally, there seems to be a performance trade off with haskells lazy evaluation, as lazy evaluation inherently has overhead, but might avoid unnecessary calculations. I wonder if these unnecessary calculations could not be avoided by better programming?\n All in all, how useful is haskells lazy evaluation, and is it a feature that should be adopted by other (new) programming languages?

I've written most of it so far but the main problem is that the actually execution of a program is very slow, roughly 10x slower than Python. When profiling the execution of the program, I noticed that most of the time is being spent simply getting the next byte or incrementing the instruction pointer. These operations are simply changing an Int in a StateT monad. Is Haskell simply the wrong language for writing a backend VM or are there optimizations that can be done to improve the performance. I should mention that I'm already running with -O2.

I'm looking to answer the following questions:\n Is there any standard practice/convention for putting test data files? For JVM projects following Maven directory structure, the location is src/test/resources, but AFAICT, there's no such convention in Haskell. So, putting the files inside the test directory, presumably under the same module path, makes sense to me.\n For example, If the code under test is in the module A.B, then putting the test data in the directory test/A/B is fine. If using HSpec, the test module is A.BSpec.\n How to read the test data files? There's no need to list these files in the cabal file, because these are't going to be shipped with the package. Simple readFile test/A/B/file.txt from the test works.\n Can anyone please confirm/correct the above statements?\n    submitted by    /u/sarkara1  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm currently learning Haskell, and I'm practicing doing the Advent of Code 2023.\n I'm a bit struggling with the performance of my solution for 2023 day 6, part 2.\n At first, here's the solution I did a month ago in Go: main.go. Basically, I iterate from 1 to raceTime, and count the number of times where applying a function is bigger than a specific value. Note that raceTime can be pretty big (in my case it's 55826490). The result is executed in a few milliseconds.\n I did the same in Haskell: Main.hs:\n ``` numberOfWays :: Int -> Int -> Int numberOfWays time distance = foldl' (\\acc i -> acc + (travelDistance i time distance)) 0 [1 .. (time - 1)]\n travelDistance :: Int -> Int -> Int -> Int travelDistance hold raceTime distance = if (raceTime - hold) * hold > distance then 1 else 0 ```\n At first, I used fold and I had a stack overflow. I read here and there what the issue was so I switched to foldl'. Yet, this version runs in more than 20 seconds compared to only a few milliseconds in Go.\n I'm not at all comparing Haskell and Go, but I'm trying to understand what makes my solution so slow and how to improve it. Note that I have seen versions in O(1), fair enough but I don't want to implement a solution with better time complexity. I'd like to stick with an O(n) solution for now, to understand what I'm doing wrong.\n Thanks for the help.\n    submitted by    /u/teivah  \n [link]   [comments]",

If so, what is the reason for this? Compile time annotations like @tailrec or @depreciation still work, and I also saw that a MacroAnnotation class was introduced under an experimental flag in Scala 3.3.0, but I'm not sure what is left to accomplish so that it could be merged into the latest Scala version.\n I appreciate any clarification on this topic!

          "description": "So, I finally picked Scala 3 for my new product and I'd like to share some experience. Overall, it's a tool for reservations. Involves a bunch of CRUD. Nothing special or particularly challenging. The stack was classic \"spartan\": Tapir, ZIO, Quill, Circe, Cats...\n The good:\n Tapir folks nailed it! That's pretty much all I can say about them. ZIO also worked flawlessly. Quill was a pleasant surprise since it was the spot where I expected most of the obstacles. Although, the general documentation of Quill could be improved. E.g. in the context of structure, more examples, etc. But in all fairness, well done.\n The bad:\n Some things do not work quite well with new Scala features. E.g. a lot of hacking around various encoders and decoders for opaque types or enums. Some libraries are still not supported which is bonkers. E.g. I miss Scalamock and Cornichon.\n The ugly:\n Tooling. The neverending story... Let's begin with Metals. Metals is like a... musket. Sometimes it fires, sometimes it misfires, and sometimes explodes straight to your face. In a lot of cases, I had to kill its Java process, remove the target dir., and reimport the project. Funny enough, IntelliJ worked okish. With, few error reports when there are no actual errors. However, the experience is kind of clunkier than with Scala 2. Also, I noticed that sometimes incremental compilation doesn't work quite well and you can end up with some weird behavior.\n The unnecessary: \n Indentation syntax. I don't want to start a rant... especially if I start asking questions about how much time and resources this feature required. Especially, since Scala has much greater \"burning issues\". In all fairness, I didn't see any benefit from having this.\n To conclude: \n The experience was ok, spiced with some rough edges. From a Scala beginner's perspective, I presume it would be quite nasty. Overall, there's still a lot of work to do.\n    submitted by    /u/rom_romeo  \n [link]   [comments]",

Long story short was: he created the users with their password so he knew their authentication infos and was able to login in order to \"see what they can see\", \"check for missing features directly on their account\", \"test out that some specific features would really work for them\" in production, etc.\n But! I changed the way users are created, mainly because the passwords he created were way too easy to guess (without even having to brute force, litteraly everyone could guess the passwords, that's why he could remember them in the first place).\n So he can't login as other users anymore, and he would like to be able to \"do it again\". I already worked on a platform that allowed user impersonation for administrators out of the box but I can't find anything on the internet regarding this subject on the Play framework and Scala documentations or their communities...\n So my questions for you are: have you ever had to deal with an impersonation feature request using silhouette + play framework + scala and if you haven't, do you have any advice to provide on the subject anyway? =D\n Thanks very much for those who take the time to respond!\n EDIT: added essential politeness to my post\n    submitted by    /u/DespicableHarpoon  \n [link]   [comments]",

Now I know that for a property I define -- MYPROP, say -- I can specify a set of allowed values by giving them as a list to the property MYPROP_ALL for example:\n #+PROPERTY: MYPROP_ALL Value1 Value2 Value3 \n Then if I use ‘C-c C-x p’ (‘org-set-property’) and answer \"MYPROP\" to its first prompt, the second prompt (which wants the value) forces me to stick to the list in MYPROP_ALL.[1] Also, both ‘S-<RIGHT>’ (‘org-property-next-allowed-value’) and ‘S-<LEFT>’ (‘org-property-previous-allowed-value’ respect the MYPTOP_ALL list as well.\n But when it comes to Special Properties that doesn't appear to work. So if I have:\n #+PROPERTY: CATEGORY_ALL Value1 Value2 Value3 \n then ‘C-c C-x p’ (‘org-set-property’) ignores the list in CATEGORY_ALL.[1] Furthermore, neither ‘S-<RIGHT>’ (‘org-property-next-allowed-value’) nor ‘S-<LEFT>’ (‘org-property-previous-allowed-value’ pay attention to it either. In fact both of them respond with \"Allowed values for this property have not been defined\".\n Is that the expected behavior, or am I doing something wrong?\n [1] Org may well give a completion list, but only if CATEGORY has already been given values elsewhere in the file, and then the list consists of all those values, and it still ignores CATEGORY_ALL. And that list of pre-used values is not enforced, the way an _ALL list is. It is merely a list of suggestions that can be ignored; brand new values can be entered without being trapped.\n    submitted by    /u/TruculentSwordfish  \n [link]   [comments]",

In it, I have future projects, current projects, and completed projects. I would like it if the completed projects (all of which have a tag \"Completed\" on their level-1 headline) were folded. I read in the manual that adding :VISIBILITY: folded to the properties drawer would do this, but it didn't work for me.

          "description": "I've been using org mode for many years, pretty much since I started using emacs, and for all this time I've kept my notes in a single org file that grows as I add more notes.\n Recently I discovered denote, a young and excellent package to organize notes in files, and I have to say that I'm really enjoying it. However, it requires me to reorganize my long org file (which is good, after so many years growing out of control).\n I would like to ask, first of all, somebody with similar experiences, why did you decided to switch to denote? Or to stay with a long org file?\n The long org file works for me in a way that I simply come to the file and search for a particular word, so I can easily access all the results and choose the one I want. I don't even use tags, everything is organized in sectons using headers. How do you make that search easy in denote? I know that using keywords is the best but, assuming that sometimes you are not even 100% sure about the exact word that you need and you type in a few to try.\n On the other hand, small files work better for my mobile (where I sync my notes), specially with zettel notes app, which has similar organization than denote. However, I wonder if somebody has a good experience with a long org file with some particular app for android.\n I'm still trying to decide if switching to denote or staying with my long org file.

A month comes up where I need to reschedule this task to the 18th. Once the task is complete, I then have to remember that it usually occurs on the 17th and manually set it back to that date. \n A similar issue comes up when I have to change just the time of day of daily task while organizing my day. I then have to remember to change the date back at the end of the day. \n Manually resetting daily tasks back to their normal time of day is a particularly tedious chore, because I have quite a few of them and their times are fairly intricate. \n Is there a less manual way to handle these use cases?

I figured the only way is to go through the source code (which is a huge blob of a file that I'm not sure how to navigate efficiently) and hack my way into it (which may end up being incompatible with future versionsk break features, etc)\n Another example:\n I'd like to collect some data across all my org files. I don't see any \"org\" way to grab all my files, convert them to some sort of objects, and grab some data I need.

          "description": "I'm starting to use column view, and one thing I'd like to see is a column showing when any given captured item was created. Any ideas how to do this? \n FWIW, here's what I've tried so far.\n I had hoped that the Special Property, TIMESTAMP_IA would give me what I'm after, but I can't get that to work. So far I've tried:\n  \nRelying on the fact that I usually clock-in when capturing, and so the datum I want is almost always already there for me, in the form of the start time for the earliest clock entry. But TIMESTAMP_IA appears to ignore timestamps that are part of clock entries. So this is no use.\n Having my capture templates create a property drawer into which gets inserted a new property called CREATED, with value of %u. That does allow me to see the value in column view, but it is under %CREATED, not under %TIMESTAMP_IA.\n Same as #3, but instead of having the CREATED property inserted into the property drawer, insert it into my logbook drawer. That does let me see the value under %TIMESTAMP_IA but bizarrely it then does not display it under %CREATED. \n  \nSo either #2 or #3 could work, but I consider them to be non-ideal. \n With #2, I don't get to use the built-inTIMESTAMP_IA which I get the feeling is really intended for the kind of thing I'm trying to do. \n And while with #3, I do get to use TIMESTAMP_IA, it is at the expense of having to insert my CREATED property into a non-property drawer, which something in the back of my mind says is ill-advised. \n And of course with both #2 and #3, unnecessary duplication is involved since, as I said, the date I want is already staring me in the face in the starting stamp of the first clock entry. Having to go around creating properties for the sole purpose of duplicating and making available an otherwise unavailable variable is, well, naff.\n ​\n    submitted by    /u/TeeMcBee  \n [link]   [comments]",

The settings on my NAS don't seem to be the issue either. I have gone over them, and, as mentioned, managed to connect with many other devices and services.\n My usual URL is something like this:\n https://[DDNS hostname].synology.me/webdav\n I have also tried the following:\n https://[DDNS hostname].synology.me/webdav\n https://[DDNS hostname].synology.me/webdav/[path to my .org folder]\n https://[DDNS hostname].synology.me/dav\n https://[DDNS hostname].synology.me/dav/[path to my .org folder]\n https://[DDNS hostname].synology.me:5006\n https://[DDNS hostname].synology.me:5005\n I have tried using http and smb as well.

I have about 17 separate topics in it, each one ranging from 5-6 lines of text to the largest being about a full page by itself. Would you folks be more inclined to have a single file (a la the original TiddlyWiki), or break each topic into its own sub-file?\n I realize that org is going to be capable of jumping around a large file as easily as it can jump between files, at least that's the impression I've gotten.

I am a noob, so please do forgive me if I don't come across as competent with orgmode\n If I run a python script on my .org files which creates a new .org file with all TODOs that meet certain property conditions (i.e. all TODOs with the property 'Category: Work')--will emacs consider these TODOs in the new .org file the same as, or different to, the TODOs that were originally copied?\n So, if I had a TODO in .org file 1, and python copied it to .org file 2, would emacs view these as separate TODOs? Basically, if a dynamic block called all TODOs with the property 'Category: Work', would this TODO appear twice?\n I ask because my specific workflow will likely require me to do something like this, and I am wondering if there is a way to do so without emacs thinking they are different. Might one way of doing this be to assign each TODO a unique identifier (UID) so that when I copy a TODO, the UID is copied too?

          "description": "Hello,\n I know this question has been asked over and over again, but after reading many articles on this topic, as well as blog posts, orgmode tutorials, and trying a bit on my own, I'm still not sure orgmode fits my needs. Since the orgmode learning curve comes up a lot, I want to make sure it's worth my time. \n I'm a graduate student in applied mathematics. I'm just starting my master's degree, so I'm looking to set up my workflow for classes, research and personal projects. I'd like to be able to quickly and easily create notes on articles, or textbooks, keeping a journal, organize files into projects, create to-do lists and roadmaps (much like orgmode does perfectly if I've understood what I've read correctly).\n I've never used emacs in my life and I don't come from a computer science background --> I find it very difficult to learn and I have the impression that it will be a long time before I can start using it for real. \n People keep saying that it's worth learning emacs and orgmode nonetheless because of the unlimited customization possibilities. What are your thoughts on this? \n Should I be patient and learn to use emacs and orgmode to set up my workflow, or should I just start using Notion or any other simple organization and note-taking app? \n Note that I don't want a complex setup in the long run, just something minimalist that allows me to concentrate on what's important while having a clear vision of my work.\n    submitted by    /u/Pretty-Habit9628  \n [link]   [comments]",

I think I could so something similar-ish by using org-transclusion, but it seems to go in the opposite direction (namely, that the separate documents are included into the big org file, but I would still need to edit them and export them from separate files).\n Any help would be greatly appreciated, and thank you for reading and for any tips in advance!\n    submitted by    /u/john_abs  \n [link]   [comments]",

And of course getting my thought process cut short is inevitable.\n Emacs makes it so much easier to stay focused on my project.\n    submitted by    /u/CJIsABusta  \n [link]   [comments]",

In my case I am leaning on built-ins and if possibly smaller packages. Which Gnus is not. And Rmail is the \"primary email reader\". \n I got the impression this setup could be less straightforward than the \"it just works\" approach of Gnus, but still. I installed movemail, made a backup copy with offlineimap in case I deleted all my messages by accident :) and then\n (setq rmail-primary-inbox-list '(\"imaps://my-user%40fastmail.com:the-password@imap.fastmail.com:993\")) \n It worked! Nice!. Except that I have a bunch of aliases (bills@mydomain.com, subscriptions@mydomain.com, etc.) and rules to redirect the messages to sub-directories of Inbox and I don't see a way to get those with movemail.\n I am guessing the config would be one mail file for each one of those directories? But still can't find how to set that up. \n I might try pointing Rmail to the Maildir back up too, but just like IMAP, it is a one way conversion so I figured I would ask in case I destroy that synced copy for nothing :) \n Thank you!\n PS: I would try Maildir as describe here: https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Other-Mailbox-Formats.html\n    submitted by    /u/sebhoagie  \n [link]   [comments]",

I would like something a little more in line with FOSS/Libre ideals.\n I've been on SourceHut for a while and I really like that there is 0 Javascript—it's fast, reliable, and has worked well so far. Trouble is, collaboration is a little trickier as it's all via mailing lists right now. I've appreciated learning about mailing lists and I have had some people collaborate with me on some software via email—so cool!—but I know this is a blocker for some people. Also, it's technically still in alpha; I know Prot recently left SourceHut due to some missing features, and I kind of look up to Prot's deliberate approach to all things development.\n An alternative I'm considering is Forgejo. (The Codeberg instance, specifically.) They seem to have similar goals in regards to free software and portability, but the workflow is much more PR-based, which is much more comfortable for many users.\n I'm curious to hear people's opinions on the two forges: where do you like developing software?

          "description": "ekg is a note taking package that is tag-based, and uses sqlite for storage. The new version 0.5.0 is out, featuring the following major changes:\n  \nInline tags! Now you can just add tags as you type, which I find very convenient. The tags are, in org-mode, turned into org-mode links, so those who like this style of having links in one note that enable \"backlinks\" will find this more familiar. The backlinks here are just the tag showing the notes that have the link to that tag.\n \nekg-auto-save, a module by Qingshui Zheng that let's you enable saving notes automatically as you write them, which works in a similar way to the emacs auto-save functionality. If you write longer notes, this should be useful.\n \nImprovements to org-mode notes. Because of the way our notes buffer works, it has metadata at the top which has read-only elements that interfere with org-mode. We now have some ability to narrow the buffer before the appropriate org-mode commands so that they work correctly. But this solution isn't perfect, and more work needs to be done. \n \nTrash simplification - I previously had the notion that trashing a note should trash the individual tags, prepending them all with \"trash/\". That idea never really panned out, and was adding too much complication, so now there's just a \"trash\" tag. If your note has that tag, it's in the trash.\n \nAborting a note. If you are capturing a note, save it as a draft, but then want to just abandon both the note and the draft, you can do that with C-c C-k. Also thanks to Qingshui Zheng!\n \nMany bug fixes.\n \n Demonstration: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKQB686SHQs\n    submitted by    /u/ahyatt  \n [link]   [comments]",

The first one seemed to have a homebrew service installed for the daemon, but it never worked for me, not sure why. I'm now trying to set up the daemon for emacs-macport.\n What I've gathered so far:\n - Opening emacs GUI and doing m-x start-server make the process be attached to that OS Window and, when it is closed, it all dies together.\n - running /opt/homebrew/opt/emacs-mac/Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS/Emacs --daemon gives me the terminal output I would expect when starting the daemon and a process, but when I try to emacsclient -cn, it opens a terminal emacs, not a GUI.\n Daemon start command output:\n Starting Doom Emacs in daemon mode! Initializing org-roam database... Clearing removed files... Clearing removed files...done Processing modified files... Processing modified files...done Copilot agent started. Starting Emacs daemon. Doom loaded 285 packages across 47 modules in 5.113s \n - when using the launchctl, as indicated in the wiki (with the modifications to emacs' path, and --fg-daemon), it starts the process with the same output as above. But, when trying to emacsclient -cn it gives me *ERROR*: Terminal type xterm-kitty is not defined. Doing export TERM=xterm does fix that, but it still opens a (rather very bugged) terminal frame.\n - Lastly, I tried creating an Emacs.app via Automator, but when invoked, it gives me the error could not get terminal name, which, I suppose, comes from the fact it is trying to open in a terminal, not GUI.\n TL;DR: It seems I've managed to open the server, but not to open a GUI frame.

I'm wondering if anyone has experience with these type of packages?\n Another one that works well is mini-echo which is free of errors, but the code is structured in an advanced lisp style that's hard for me to interpret, so I have not been able to customize it for different reasons.\n It would be good to fix the errors in awesome-tray and improve it. The errors I get are fairly simple:\n awesome-tray.el: Warning: Pattern t is deprecated. Use _ instead [2 times]\n Warning: setting attribute ‘:background’ of face ‘mode-line-buffer-id’: nil value is invalid, use ‘unspecified’ instead.\n Warning: setting attribute ‘:foreground’ of face ‘region’: nil value is invalid, use ‘unspecified’ instead.Unable to load color \"color\" [2 times]\n I've been able to override how awesome-tray displays major modes with a list of shorthand strings and change the time format, so it seems easy to customize. I suspect setq awesome-tray-mode-line-active-color doesn't work because of the above errors, but I'm not certain.\n Anyway are there any other packages that would be a good choice, or does anyone have some advice on how I might go about fixing or improving awesome-tray?

Emacs can of course bookmark specific locations in regular text files, but also several types of non-file buffers: dired, eshell, Man, eww, Info, help, image, vc-dir, doc-view, possibly others. Are there any others you'd like to be able to bookmark?\n Here are some ideas:\n  \noccur and grep buffers (jumping to the bookmark would rerun the search).\n \nREPLs. I can imagine this being useful: you bookmark a Python REPL and later jumping to the bookmark starts a new REPL and reruns all the import statements you had run before (or maybe just reruns everything?, or everything marked with a special comment?)\n \nshells. The eshell bookmarks are great, and that's what I use, but not everyone uses eshell. A shell bookmarker should preserve the current directory and whether you were ssh'ed into some other computer.\n \nShell command output buffers, the bookmarks should rerun the command. Same for compilation buffers (revert-buffer already knows how to rerun the compilation!).\n \n I'd love to see some more ideas for missing bookmark capabilities.\n    submitted by    /u/oantolin  \n [link]   [comments]",

But, if I execute my function by pressing <up> from line 3, (point) keeps returning back 1, the point of the beginning of line 1 rather than the point at the beginning of line 2.\n Is this expected behavior?

Also occurs when I try with (backward-char) and C-b: so long as it's the first line – at the top of the buffer – which is invisible, there's a difference between executing code by itself vs. via key commands (with the latter putting me at point 1, every time).\n    submitted by    /u/blah1998z  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hey everyone!\n Long-time Emacs user (this is my 8th year!) and lurker on this sub. I use Emacs for *nearly* everything. Coding, reading, writing, RSS, ToDos, knowledge base, website, music etc.\n So, I'm juggling Emacs on a bunch of different setups: a Linux machine with Ubuntu at home, a RHEL workstation and a node I ssh into at work, a MacOS laptop, a few Raspberry Pis. You see where this is going. Each has different uses, but some core things that I like to keep consistent.\n With the mix of OSX, Ubuntu, RHEL, plus the GUI and TTY variations, I need to change my Emacs config on every machine (even though a lot stays the same across the board).\n The real headache starts when I change something on one machine, and I want to apply that to all (or some) of the other machines. Yak shaving and all...\n Right now, my setup's built around an init.el that loads up a settings.org file, which has my literate config. The way I deal with some things (for example, remapping key bindings on MacOS) is by wrapping it up with conditionals. But it's looking quite ugly and is more annoying to maintain.\n I wonder what the best approach here is. Split my config into multiple files and load them as needed depending on where I am? Maybe mess around with Git branches for different setups? (And how would I even start with that?) Git submodules?\n Are there some tools that already deal with this? I am sure this is not an Emacs-only problem.\n Thanks in advance and would love to hear how you deal with this :)\n    submitted by    /u/I3lind5pot  \n [link]   [comments]",

Maybe some of can weigh in on which path is \"worth\" following.\n Basically, i come from vim and neovim. I've worked with emas and neovim in parallel for years now. I generally enjoy the \"regular\" emacs keybindings for UI stuff. But i feel like i'm lossing a LOT of editing power when leaving evil behind. Yet, getting it to work consistently is a bunch of work and it'll always be 99% at best.\n Now the relevant part. I'm pretty sure i've only scratched the surface of emacs native keybinds. What i find missing is \"simple\" stuff like \"delete between paranthesis\" or \"duplicate this line\". Is this something emacs can \"just do\" and i just haven't found it yet?\n I see 2 ways forward:\n  \nStick with evil and invest the time to create consistent remaps where evil-collection and others don't quite do it.\n Stick to emacs and remap/write functionality i'm missing from vim\n  \nNote that ergonomics are a secondary thought. I have a custom keyboard so arrow keys are still on hjkl and modifiers are on thumbkeys. I'm also not married to the idea of modal editing. In fact, i enjoy not having to worry about modes and just \"type away\". But deleting/changing a specified area is just something i haven't found a good solution in emacs to.\n So, thoughts?

          "description": "Probably it's been asked many times, still, I'm not sure which way should I go.\n I'm hungarian, and my solution to write hungarian in emacs (which I have barely done) was that I just simply typed \"auoeiuo\" instead of \"áúüű....\".\n Lately I started to have the need to write text for others, so using the correct vowels with \"umlauts\" became needed more and more often. It would be amazing if I could just simply switch layout and go on with my life not fighting with my muscle memory. Most often I still use us layout, not only because of the shortcuts, but also typing special characters like \\, [], etc... on hungarian layout really a pain in the ass. On hungarian layout I will almost never use any \"programming characters\", I'm pretty sure.\n The problem I have for example is that \"C-_\" is \"C-Ü\" or \"C-y\" is \"C-z\" on hungarian layout, which doesn't work anymore. I don't want to learn different combinations, neither fighting my muscle memory every time when once a week I want to write some longer hungarian text in emacs.\n I have a feeling that there could be a trick that any time i'm using a different layout, (and probably I should also put a condition that I'm in txt mode for not mess up things like dired or magit), emacs would interpret my keystrokes differently when I hold down C or M. So I would use the same key for typing a single \"ü\" and \"C-_\" for example.\n What could be the simplest way to set up emacs like that? Can you post me a link where it's already answered? I'm pretty sure it's been answered a couple of times, I'm just too stupid to find it.\n Thank you!\n    submitted by    /u/paadam94  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "When typing up some long-form text for entry into a website, I'll sometimes do it first in Org mode and then once I'm happy with it I'll copy-paste it into whatever I'm using. \n However, one issue is that of <NEWLINE>.\n On the one hand, web forms often want to handle line wrapping, and so it wants the user to insert <NEWLINE> characters only if really necessary; e.g. for between paragraphs, list items, and so on.\n But on the other hand, I have Org set up to auto-fill text input (and I'll also regularly give it a hand in that using M-q to run org-fill-paragraph), so I end up with <NEWLINE> characters all over the place.\n Now obviously I could just turn off emacs and Org's auto-fill for the purpose of these situations. But I don't want that. I actually *want* the Org text formatted with the auto-fills, just as it would be if I wasn't creating something for input on the web.\n So, is there a simple way (maybe using export? ) to have the newlines that are not needed (I'm thinking it's only newlines within a paragraph) replaced with what is almost certainly going to be a simple inter-word space? Note , though, that it isn't just going to be the newline that needs to go, but also any following indenting whitespace characters used to correctly position the next piece of text.\n For example, I'd like to have this:\n  1. A line of text 2. Another line of text but this one is long enough to need to be wrapped. And notice that this portion is indented.  converted to:  1. A line of text 2.

          "description": "Hi everyone, I've been trying for the past month or so to get Emacs working reliably and quickly on my High DPI linux machines, but have been struggling.\n Currently I am running into issues with a machine running Manjaro + GNOME (wayland) and the pgtk version of emacs 29.1. When I scale the frame to take up the entirety of my 4k display, I have noticeable input lag, likely in the 100s of ms. When I shrink the frame down, my input lag decreases significantly, and emacs feels snappy. The issue persists when I run emacs with emacs -q.\n At the moment I've resorted to running emacs 29.1 without pgtk, forcing it to run under XWayland. This causes emacs to render at a lower resolution to XWayland, resulting in blurry text when it's finally displayed on my monitor, but results in emacs staying snappy even at full screen.\n I've run into this issue across all my machines, across distros (namely Void, Arch, and Fedora), whenever I try to run Emacs full screen on a 4K monitor attached to a machine running Wayland. Switching to X isn't an option due to the excessive screen tearing that I get at high resolutions.\n Weirdly, compiling and running Emacs on my Windows work machine natively results in the best emacs experience I've had so far, with input feeling extremely snappy and fluid. I don't experience the scaling issues there. Emacs also is working fantastic on an old low resolution laptop that I have running Void with XFCE.\n I've tried adjusting the double buffering as mentioned in this post without success: https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/zgp6kw/gui_emacs_weird_the_bigger_the_frame_size_is_the/\n Any thoughts? Is this a thing that people are running into on high resolution displays with Wayland? Is XWayland the best bet right now?\n    submitted by    /u/sunmoi  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I've been using org mode for many years, pretty much since I started using emacs, and for all this time I've kept my notes in a single org file that grows as I add more notes.\n Recently I discovered denote, a young and excellent package to organize notes in files, and I have to say that I'm really enjoying it. However, it requires me to reorganize my long org file (which is good, after so many years growing out of control).\n I would like to ask, first of all, somebody with similar experiences, why did you decided to switch to denote? Or to stay with a long org file?\n The long org file works for me in a way that I simply come to the file and search for a particular word, so I can easily access all the results and choose the one I want. I don't even use tags, everything is organized in sectons using headers. How do you make that search easy in denote? I know that using keywords is the best but, assuming that sometimes you are not even 100% sure about the exact word that you need and you type in a few to try.\n On the other hand, small files work better for my mobile (where I sync my notes), specially with zettel notes app, which has similar organization than denote. However, I wonder if somebody has a good experience with a long org file with some particular app for android.\n I'm still trying to decide if switching to denote or staying with my long org file. Any comments would be appreciated.\n    submitted by    /u/teobin  \n [link]   [comments]",

My workflow\n is something like:\n  \nfor each person I regularly meet I have a top level bullet.\n every time I have a meeting with that person, I find the top level bullet, and create a new child bullet, with the date of the meeting and the topic - I have two usual topica, being \"catch up\" and\"review\".\n under that new bullet I type my notes from the meeting. These are usually transcribed from paper notes I make during the meeting.\n  \nE.g\n * Ann Onymous\n ** <2023-08-22 Thu> catchup\n Ann is having fun working on cold-fusion. Needs new peanut butter and\n mousetraps. Says warm weather is interfering with correct function of\n reverse osmosis proton macerator.\n Needs me to sort out climate and mousetraps.\n ** <2023-09-20 Wed> catchup\n new mousetraps have made life better. Climate still not good enough...\n ​\n Having watched (in bits, over a week or two admiteddly) Prot's 'tube explanations, and done a basic installation of Denote, I want to make it work for my note taking needs. I'm in no way wedded to the arrangement shown above. I'd happily have a file per person. But I think Denote wants me to have a file per meeting. But for me, a big part of the value is continuity. I.e. being able to see what happened in previous meetings so I can be sure to follow up on actions, and keep a proxixmate record of outstanding actions and conclusions.\n I think this means that I might use Denote by having a file per meeting, with keywords like \"talking_to_Ann_Onymous\" and then use a dynamic block to gather the rolling textual status. By playing with the frontmatter I could include the date of each meeting. Further, I think I would use the signature fucntions to ensure that the notes are displayed in calendar order.\n Has someone else solved this kind of problem?

          "description": "One of orgs big strengths is its ability to emit code. I use org-tangle for my literate emacs config, org-export for producing PDFs and HTML, and a variation of org-export MD for producing my Hugo blog posts. But I am unconfident about when org will skip lines. Is my understanding correct?\n  \n It seems that timestamps, including inactive timestamps, and DEADLINE and SCHEDULED are ALWAYS output. I wish this weren't so.\n  When tangling, COMMENT on a heading (shortcut key #) is skipped. I don't know if this omits things from org-agenda.\n  When marked with :ARCHIVE:, lines are skipped in org-agenda. I use this for optimizing long repeating sequences so that I only have one chunk (month, or school semester) at a time.\n  DEADLINES can have their visibility shortened with syntax like <span class=\"timestamp-wrapper\"><span class=\"timestamp\"><2024-01-25 Thu -2d></span></span>; however, the same seems to break stuff if put into SCHEDULED instead.\n \nTraditional syntax commenting with literal =# = at line start in an org file omits from all of the above, I think. But I'm not sure.\n Is this as confusing as I see, or is there a unifying principle here?\n \n    submitted by    /u/WorldsEndless  \n [link]   [comments]",

Loving it so far.\n However, one thing I wish I could change is the major modes for C, C++, Python, and Shell languages. I tend to get really overwhelmed by how many options are provided because of the maturity of these languages and it's hard for me to really learn their features even with which-key installed. Another sticking point is that they sometimes overwrite custom keybinds that I use frequently, especially c-mode.\n Is there such a thing as a general purpose coding major mode that just provides syntax highlighting with tree-sitter, code folding, and Eldoc info for each language? Maybe this is something that would be easy to hack up by extending prog-mode with only those features?\n Barring that, is there a way to help simplify the major modes like not overriding my global keymap?

My first issue was when the script that LSP runs to install jdtls failed to install due to cert issues. I was able to fix those, but I ran into error `java.security.InvalidAlgorithmParameterException: the trustAnchors parameter must be non-empty`. I tried fixing the cert store, but no luck.\n The next thing I tried was doing `brew install jdtls`. I tried setting `lsp-java-server-install-dir` to the install location of the jdtls binary; however, that also did not work. For some reason, LSP cannot find the `jdtls` in my path, even though it's available globally on my system. FWIW, I am using package exec-path-from-shell, and it's properly configured (other packages that depend on external tools work just fine). \n I was wondering if anyone has had any luck getting lsp-java to work on Mac, especially if you went the `brew install jdtls` route.

As a beginner, I want to do things at a relatively raw level, which is more comfortable because I don't feel blindly accepting things where I often confuse different parts and keep doing things the wrong way, and that blindness in my experience often prevents me from using a tool in the most efficient way (plus spacemacs' startup time is too long :( on my already not so powerful computer).\n So I liked it once I found the repo of Ashton. I tried the simplest version from the repository (called \"early-init.el\") and followed its comments carefully. Useful things I found in this file include\n  \nhow to install packages\n how to change the background colour (I didn't do though)\n Others like font face where the repository owner left it blank, but the related function names are there to guide me.\n  \n​\n --------\n Totally unrelated, the Emacs plugins have a very different flavour compared to their counterparts in Neovim/vim. They are structured quite differently. This is how I feel as someone who has tried to learn Vim for a while.

For some reason, when I eval the defun blocks in that file, the function fails to recognize the argument I pass to it (\"tagname\"), but when I copy the code into my scratch buffer and evaluate it there, it suddenly works. I am also able to add the line (defvar tagline \"Project\") and it works in that case as well.\n (defun cj/org-roam-filter-by-tag (tagname) (lambda (node) (member tagname (org-roam-node-tags node)))) (defun cj/org-roam-find-project () (interactive) ;; Select file to open, creating if necessary (org-roam-node-find nil nil (cj/org-roam-filter-by-tag \"Project\") nil :templates '((\"p\" \"project\" plain \"* Goal\\n\\n%?\\n\\n* Inbox\\n\\n** TODO Add initial tasks\\n\\n\" :if-new (file+head \"%<%Y%m%d%H%M%S>-${slug}.org\" \"#+title: ${title}\\n#+category: ${title}\\n#+filetags: Project\") :unnarrowed t)))) \n Essentially, the issue I'm having is I start emacs/load my init file, these functions are defined, and I run cj/org-roam-filter-by-tag. I get the error (void-variable tagname), which seems to come from the lambda function. At this point, if I run (cj/org-roam-filter-by-tag \"Project\"), it evaluates to (lambda (node) (member tagname (progn (or ... ...) (aref node 16)))), which I can then fix be either copying the (cj/org-roam-filter-by-tag) function to the scratch buffer and evaluating it there, or evaluating (defvar tagname \"Project\"). \n This code is taken almost exclusively from system crafters, and I don't really understand the lambda function and what it does. As far as I can tell this seems to be some sort of scoping issue, but since I'm directly calling the function with \"Project\" as an argument, I don't see why I'm getting the \"void-variable\" error. \n I'm a little lost with this issue, and I'd appreciate any help.

I used it for a year and realized that the amount of things to learn is much greater. I learned Vim keybindings, Spacemacs keybindings, modal editing. I also learned the concepts of Emacs, Org Mode, Magit. I realized that some things don't happen so quickly, and I also started to get tired of modal editing and only using the keyboard to perform actions. So, I decided to try vanilla Emacs. I noticed that the contents of the main menu, the button menu and the modeline change according to the position of the pointer, that is, the GUI presents the options in a contextual way. Now I can work effectively using the keyboard and mouse and receiving feedback from the interface regarding commands and key combinations that I always forget. And finally, I gave up on maintaining a configuration file (for now), I learned to use 'customize'. I'm really amazed at what you can do with absolutely no configuration initially! Some advice for beginners (I still am): - Enable CUA mode at the very beginning and migrate to default over time - Learn the concepts (Emacs is a platform!) - Learn how GUI behaves - Learn the key combinations - Learn Org Mode (this is f****** awesome!) - Have a good time!\n    submitted by    /u/Due_Olive_9728  \n [link]   [comments]",

DistroTube recently came out with his series on building a sensible config from scratch which I've played with for a bit, but I don't want to fully commit if what I want isn't possible.\n What I am looking for: - ability to act as a terminal - pdf viewing with latex editing side by side - being able to navigate to other workspaces to view pdfs and navigate through them with vim-like binds - extensible (which emacs is) - ability to integrate zettelkasten with a pdf open in another pane/split within the same program\n The general idea I want is it do everything I need to do school/productivity wise within emacs, and nothing else.

I can jump to the definition of an identifier with xref-find-definitions, and I can see the type of the binding with eldoc or with inlays.\n However, I don't know how to quickly jump to the type of an identifier?\n Rust uses type inference a lot, so the concrete type is often not spelled out in the source code. This means that I don't have the type to use as a starting point. An example:\n rust let foo = build_me_a_foo(); \n Here I would like to be able to jump to the Foo type which build_me_a_foo presumably returns. Today I do this by jumping to the definition of build_me_a_foo and then jump further from the function signature.\n Reading the Emacs manual, I see that I could use C-u M-. to get a prompt for the identifier to jump to. The very large list presented to me does contain what I need, but I need to spell it out based on what eldoc showed me in the mode line.\n Has anybody written the code to look up the type and then feed it directly into C-u M-.?\n    submitted by    /u/mgeisler  \n [link]   [comments]",

Please see the screenshot for examples.\n This behaviour could have been fine, except that they don't seem to function. For instance, the \"section\" symbol does not create a section in the document.\n It looks like it might have something to do with the input method for TeX, since I can find the symbols as \"translations\" of the keywords when I look there. Please see screenshot.\n I don't encounter this problem when using emacs -Q but I also cannot find a LaTeX related culprit in my config, so I'm at a loss. I experience the behaviour both on my personal Linux computer and on my work Mac.\n Does anyone know what might cause this behaviour and how I can disable it?\n In case you think there might be something in my config and want to help me out by having a look, it's available here.\n EDIT:\n Thank you for the help!

But each time I think I've pinpointed and resolved the issue, it unfortunately resurfaces.Most stack traces aren't very enlightening, often showing repeated calls to functions like 'mac_gui_loop', 'dispatch_semaphore_wait_slow', and 'redisplay_internal...'.\n Is there anyone who can run Emacs on macOS without experiencing these freezes for >1 day? If so, what hardware are you using? Did you use any special configurations or fixes?\n Does native-compilation or any other flag influences this?\n I plan writing an article about Emacs on macOS, aiming for a stable and consistent environment.

          "description": "Hi there! I am a noob, so please do forgive me if I don't come across as competent with orgmode\n If I run a python script on my .org files which creates a new .org file with all TODOs that meet certain property conditions (i.e. all TODOs with the property 'Category: Work')--will emacs consider these TODOs in the new .org file the same as, or different to, the TODOs that were originally copied?\n So, if I had a TODO in .org file 1, and python copied it to .org file 2, would emacs view these as separate TODOs? Basically, if a dynamic block called all TODOs with the property 'Category: Work', would this TODO appear twice?\n I ask because my specific workflow will likely require me to do something like this, and I am wondering if there is a way to do so without emacs thinking they are different. Might one way of doing this be to assign each TODO a unique identifier (UID) so that when I copy a TODO, the UID is copied too? Would this solve the issue of emacs possibly viewing both items as separate rather than the same?\n Any help is much appreciated.

After running C-x C-e after the function (unlike without interactive) I can use M-x double-param but after hitting return it does not wait for input for the parameter.

It could perhaps be of interest for some people here. While the Emacs keymap in IntelliJ is actually pretty good, there's enough differences that my Emacs-marinated fingers stumble too often while using IntelliJ. So the plugin is meant to be an extension of the existing Emacs functionality, offering around 40 commands that either modify existing IntelliJ commands to be closer to Emacs, or are pure additions to the IntelliJ commands.\n The plugin only makes these commands available, and you can use whichever ones you find useful, either by adding keybindings one-by-one, or by using the EmacsJ keymap installed by the plugin which is an extension of the Emacs keymap and activates all the commands at once.\n The main features are:\n  \nIncremental search modelled on Emacs' Isearch, with text and regexp search.\n Query-replace as in Emacs with text or regexps, with a very light-weight interface.\n Word commands: transpose, upper-case, lower-case, capitalize, move, delete.\n Rectangle commands: copy, open, clear, paste.\n Whitespace commands: delete space around point, delete empty lines.\n Easy access to clipboard history à la Emacs (kill ring).\n A mark history with ability to pop mark (mark ring), and exchange point and mark.\n Duplicate and comment regions and lines.\n Recenter and relocate caret.\n Zap to character.\n  \n​\n The plugin is of course free and open source.\n https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/23181-emacsj\n https://github.com/strindberg/emacsj\n ​\n    submitted by    /u/Stindberg  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello! As a new Emacs user, it seems that I have joined in exciting times with the adoption of treesitter + LSP (which also was my setup in neovim). I have spent some time customizing and slowly get the hang of how minor/major modes work.\n From what I saw, a major mode defines syntax rules for highlighting (similar to treesitter), on-the-fly error checking with flycheck (similar to LSP) and some setup, such as indentation, etc.\n I understand that TS + LSP are still being actively developed and integrated into Emacs and so I accept that the experience using these tools might not yet match that of established major modes. So I am mostly curious about the future.\n If you were to start coding in a new language in Emacs, what would your setup look like? My thinking is to install the treesitter grammar and the LSP plus minor modes for navigation and editing (e.g., lispy for elisp). Would TS + LSP be used instead of the language major mode or in conjunction with said major mode?\n    submitted by    /u/progyam  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I've started using lsp-bridge after months of fighting with eglot and lsp-mode. Both eglot and lsp-mode are great projects, but they have their quirks, and for me, most of them revolve around how slow and how prone to timing out they are, as well as the massive memory footprint that they cause (I've had both of them spawn clangd processes that end up consuming 20-30GB, and so far lsp-bridge is keeping under 10GB, which is fine). This isn't their fault per se--I'm working on an Unreal Engine project and there is just so much going on all the time, and I can easily believe that parsing JSON is the bottleneck. (I know there's a new-ish project that tries to solve that problem for lsp-mode, and I will definitely try that one day if this experiment with lsp-bridge doesn't work out.)\n So, two questions:\n  \nCan I jump to the (header) file under the cursor, or like lsp-mode, cause that header to become a link to the file?\n I have some functions and classes that seem inaccessible because they're wrapped up in a namespace. This isn't true of everything in a namespace, just a few things. That means I can't jump to classes/functions defined in that namespace, and I also get no completion information back. This wasn't the case with eglot or lsp-mode, so I don't think it's a fundamental limitation of clangd.\n  \nOther than that, so far, I'm pretty impressed. I'll work out some keybindings and wrapper functions to see if I can get the functionality that I'm missing, but for jumping around the code, it's significantly more performant.\n    submitted by    /u/vjgoh  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm a Software Engineer(web dev, full stack) by profession.\nI discovered Zettelkasten in 2020 when I started working on a rather large personal project called MindOS. I was trying to create content in the intersection of philosophy, psychology, programming and rationality. During the research phase, I understood that it was going to be impossible to keep all of this in my mind - even with the note taking method that I used at that stage. I needed a better system.\nThis search led me to Zettelkasten, and I immediately fell in love with it! Since then I have actively trying to encourage others to use it as well. To do this, I have written tutorials, videos, created a couple of tools, etc. But my biggest and most resent contribution is a book I wrote and published a few months back: Zettelkasten and the Art of Knowledge Management.\nMy Zettelkasten Process...\nI have 2 vaults. Everything I learn that is useful for others go into Obsidian - and I publish it as a Digital Garden at https://notes.binnyva.com\nAll my personal information goes into a Logseq graph. This includes...\nJournals\nProject Management\nFleeting notes\nand the kitchen sink ;-)",

So far I'm largely filling it with ideas I've been turning over in my mind for a while rather than the product of new reading. I've come to the conclusion that these ideas should be sat on for a while before they turn into permanent notes and so a zettelkasten would be unsuitable for learning a new field or subfield, which would be better served by a sort of lab manual or similar (not being an academic, I don't particularly need to preserve citations). Like an accounting system that uses a memorandum sheet, a journal, and then a ledger, with the zettelkasten being analogous to the last.\nI got into this from Scheper's book, but I'm not a purist and I found his approach a little too dogmatic. But what I don't recall from his book or Luhmann's zettelkasten is recording the date each card was written. I don't know if that information is useful, but I've been including it on each card.",
