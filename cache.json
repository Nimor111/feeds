          "description": "Hello all, I just finished a computational physics class at university. They used Python. We had a browser based program that used a VM to store our files, and we edited everything on jupyter notebook. I basically had everything setup for me in the class at school. I didn't initialize or setup any of the programs.\n ​\n The class inspired me to try and code more here at home, I just got a book, Learning Physics with Functional Programming. They use Haskell as the language. I've got a macbook, and I have no idea how to set anything up. I barely understand what I'm doing. Believe me I've been watching tutorial after tutorial, but there's always some error I get that these tutorials don't address. I'm trying to become code literate.\n ​\n In that case I thought maybe I could get help here? I went to Haskell.org, and used the terminal command from there to install GHcup. Afterwards, I opened up VScode and downloaded the Haskell extension. Then, I tried to start a new project and begin working along the book I bought. \n The problem is that anytime I set Haskell as my language for a new note in VScode, it gives the error that \"Project requires GHcup but it isn't installed. Source: Haskell (extension)\"\n ​\n I've tried going into my ~bash file to inspect the path of the GHcup file, but the terminal denies me access to it. I'm not even sure if that's what would help fix this either, but I saw a lot of reference to this on Haskell Troubleshooting forum links from VScode.\n ​\n Sorry for my incapability... this kinda makes me want to keep using my whiteboard for physics but I really want to be able to do bigger calculations on a computer, and not on Python.\n ​\n If I could get any help I'd appreciate it a lot\n    submitted by    /u/redflactober  \n [link]   [comments]",

Individual book opinions are welcomed too, or if you think I should take a look at another, non-mentioned book, feel free to share!\n Thank you in advance!\n PS: I am familiar with the book ‘Haskell Programming from First Principle’, which AFAIK covers not just the basics, but advanced topics as well.

          "description": "Dear Haskellers,\n I've been struggling with some really weird behavior for the last few hours now and I can't seem to figure it out, maybe that someone here can help? I've narrow the actual problem down to 2 very stripped down scenarios, 1 that works, and 1 that doesn't. Both are being run in exactly the same simple IO function that just grabs a lazy bytestring that is being generated from an evdev file and feeds it to the function and tries to print the result.\n works :: L.ByteString -> [ByteString] works = L.foldrChunks chomp [] where chomp b acc = b : acc doesnot :: L.ByteString -> [ByteString] doesnot = fst . L.foldrChunks chomp ([], []) where chomp b (acc, bcc) = (b : acc, b : bcc) test :: IO () test = do withEvdev \"/dev/input/by-id/usb-Technomancy_Atreus-event-kbd\" $ \\byts -> do mapM_ print $ works byts -- mapM_ print $ doesnot byts \n The first function works as expected, it returns a lazy list of strict bytestrings that accumulate as keyboard events are generated. And the testing function prints out data as it comes in. The second function simply will not ever run. I've covered it with trace statements and changed the accumulator to undefineds and the pattern matches to underscores. Doesn't change anything. Somehow changing the accumulator to a tuple seems to turn the whole handling of the loop strict?\n    submitted by    /u/janssen_dhj  \n [link]   [comments]",

So I came up with this, following this:\n listing = do i <- [0..10] let x = i * i guard (x > 20) return x \n I actually prefer removing the do sugar as well, like this:\n listing = [0..10] >>= (\\i -> let x = i * i in guard (x > 20) >> return x) \n This got me thinking, can I use do so that I can avoid >>= and >>, but also keep it a one liner. So I followed this, this and this and got the following to work:\n listing = do {i <- [0..10]; let {x = i * i} in do guard (x > 20); return x} \n But I was hoping for something like this, which did not work:\n listing = do {i <- [0..10]; let x = i * i; guard (x > 20); return x} \n I am not really sure why. But I figured it might be because of let. I tried to get rid of it but I wasn't able to, unless I just remove all sugar and have something like this:\n listing = [0..10] >>= (\\i -> (\\x -> guard (x > 20) >> return x) (i * i)) \n Which is, funnily enough, shorted then the do version. Long story short, I don't understand the rules of do and let. Can someone explain in simple terms? By the way, is let also sugar, it doesn't seem like it to me, because my lambda seems to make a dependency on the ordering of variables, but I'm not sure.

A maximal function that gives all maximal elements would be a straight forward generalization with the added benefit that it’s defined for the empty list. Then one could just have\n maximum = head . maximal \n On Hoogle I couldn’t find something like this. Neither in base nor any package. \n Very often when I think \"why is this not in base?\" it turns out that there actually is something and what I wanted is just a special case. Or you can trivially compose it out of other functions. Does this apply here?\n I also noticed, when I tried to define maximal for Foldable instead of lists, I did not know how to do it without specializing the return type (ie list). Is that possible?

Surprisingly, it was resolved by moving hs_init call to background thread - nothing in the docs suggested that it would made any difference, but it made the apps much more responsive on iOS (yet to test on Android).\n Does anybody know why it could have happened?\n We now use these RTS options that also help responsiveness and reduce memory usage by 10% (when the usage was large): - -A16m (chunk size for new allocations) - -H64m (initial heap size) - -xn (non-moving GC)\n Let me know if you have any comments on these!\n Thank you!\n    submitted by    /u/epoberezkin  \n [link]   [comments]",

So ideally what I would like is since vector is not available by default, is to install it where ghc and ghci is able to see it and import Data.Vector and :m Data.Vector just works and call it a day. Kind of like in c, where you sudo apt install <package>, and #include <package> works.\n Apparently for some reason it seems like a very difficult task to do. Every website/forum which I read suggest to set up a full fledged application with cabal init and then cabal install. \n I learned that cabal packages and ghc packages are two different things (cabal list --installed and ghc-pkg list). Both maintain their own package databases (installed packages) and ghc and ghci can only see and work with ghc packages. Theres this command cabal install --libs but people on github are saying it can cause some issues and suggest against it (with one person saying it outright \"evil\"). \n I couldn't find a straightforward solution to this except years old articles and tons of open issues on github with people having similar problems.\n Is there no simple way to achieve this than to manually download or cabal init?\n    submitted by    /u/Patzer26  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "As I get deeper into learning haskell I have noticed what seems to be \"Imperative Creep\" for the lack of a better term.\n It seems as the code gets more \"real world\" it becomes ever more imperative. In many examples across the web I see code very similar to the imperative style of a language like python. I'm not really understanding the point of all the great functional aspects of the language if you can't write functional code for real world use cases.\n I't's very confusing for a beginner to wrap their brains around the functional paradigm. Then, almost immediately after understanding this new programming concept you're hit with the Monad and all the educational literature starts you a new with imperative code - it's maddening. Every tutorial explains that \"do\" notation makes it easier to grok the monad by allowing a more imperative approach. WTF.\n I'm not changing any minds for certain. But, honestly I think this \"crutch\" has hampered my absorption of the learning material and perhaps increased the learning curve. Additionally this also makes the beautiful syntax of haskell look more like some JS crap with all the \"do\" \"if\" and \"case\", I mean really you can't use functors, applicatives or monads with \"pattern-matching\", \"guards\" and \"where\". Perhaps I have not learned anything of functional programming?\n I'm just ranting, apologies for the negative vibes.

With python for example you would probably create a virtual environment, install the package in it, import it in your source file and go.\n The analog to that solution would be sandboxes I assume, but as far as I understand those are depreciated these days.\n I used Haskell ~3 years ago, always installed packages globally, and then worked mainly with ghci. This was probably not ideal back then, but seems to not even work quite the same way today (cabal install <package> says <package> is not exposed or something along these lines).\n From what I read here, it seems that a \"python like workflow\" maybe works when working with nix (instead of cabal?).\n Can somebody help lift my confusion?

          "description": "I sometimes run into this slightly annoying situation when I'm building up a programme, in which I would like to eliminate, add, or swap arguments around in a function definition.\n I'm going to talk about this from the perspective of this simple set of definitions:\n ``` newtype Person = Person { name :: Text } data Lang = EN | FR\n hello :: Lang -> Text hello EN = \"hello\" hello FR = \"salut\"\n greet :: Person -> Lang -> Text greet person lang = hello lang <> \" \" <> name person ```\n Let's take the Helix editor (which I'm playing with as my daily driver). It's annoying because, even if I use the treesitter integration to, say, select the object, delete it, move to the other side of the arrow, and paste it in, I still have to go and write/delete a load of ->. Admittedly, this isn't a big deal, but I remember when I was playing with clojure many years ago in vim, and I sort of loved the ability, via vim-sexp, to move things around -- into lists, out of lists, forward and backwards within a list, etc..\n I was therefore thinking: \"I wonder if it's possibly to do this in my editor\", and wanted to start with something as simple as \"can I move the argument backwards / forwards\", by which I mean, with respect to the greet function defined above: \"can I swap the Person and Lang arguments so instead of greet myPerson EN I do greet EN myPerson?\"\n I thought maybe treesitter would be a nice way to achieve this, but I really have no idea where to start (and if there is a better way).

For now, I have a scope for the problem:\n The generator should be able to produce algorithms dealing with arrays and linear algebraic objects. Combining the right types from the vector-space and linear libraries, it should be possible to\n  \noperate on types like SquareMatrix, which get translated to an if condition with error on the start of the MATLAB function- evaluate linear functions, operators, maps and folds as imperative code from some basic building blocks.\n These computations will likely be in their own possibly monadic type and it should be possible to evaluate actions into either MATLAB code or direct execution as if it were a (almost) pure haskell function.\n Actions can be used to define MATLAB functions.

Many performance optimization can't be applied in graalvm.\n In Fury 0.4.0 version, Fury can run on GraalVM native image efficiently and is super easy-to-use. Neither reflection nor meta config are needed. Fury generates all code for Fury JIT framework and MethodHandle/LambdaMetafactory at graalvm native image build time. Then use those generated code for serialization at runtime without any extra cost, the performance is great.\n Compared to native JDK serialization, Fury can be 46x faster than JDK, and less than half of the serialized size.\n See https://github.com/alipay/fury/blob/main/docs/guide/graalvm_guide.md for example and benchmarks.\n This is a big step for jvm serialization, please give it a try and share us with your feedbacks.\n    submitted by    /u/Shawn-Yang25  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "author": null,
          "description": "For those who have reservations about the syntax of comprehensions, and there are a few, here's one possible alternative\n The approach is to extend an existing function to handle additional argument types, so that it replicates a comprehension via a single function call. For instance a function of two integers is among other things extended to also apply to two ranges of integers. There are some similarities with vectorization (see R, MATLAB, Julia and the like), although here you don't have to mix row vectors and column vectors.\n It's a kind of Polish notation for comprehensions: you're saying the same thing as before, but everything has been rearranged, and the main function comes first. Perhaps not unlike the original Polish notation, it takes some getting used to, and won't be to everyone's taste. But there are arguably a few advantages:\n  \nno need for specialized syntax: no on-the-fly variable bindings, so no left-arrows (or \"for\" or \"yield\")\n generally more concise notation that meshes well with Scala's use of underscores for lambda functions\n a direct style that can be used with effect handling, e.g. with Cats or ZIO\n a clear distinction between independent and dependent terms, determined by the static types\n  \nThis last property means that by default the library is a bit of a hybrid of David Turner's original list comprehension (which can handle any case, but always returns a sequence), and a more Julia-style array comprehension when things are \"rectangular\". This makes it straightforward to plot a function (via JavaScript and plotly). It also means an inherent distinction between the parallelizable and the sequential, i.e. applicatives and - the term was bound to crop up eventually - monads.\n Essentially it's a function-centric version of comprehensions, for those who would prefer not to use specialized syntax or macros, or maybe just want comprehensions in Java.\n    submitted by    /u/garlandus1  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "The FunFixture class looks like it works well when you have one or two indepenent items that need to be set up for the test. However, in my more complicated tests, I tend to have many things that need to be set up and which depend on each other.\n At the moment, using an ad-hoc set up like\n ​\n class MySuite extends munit.FunSuite: var foo: Foo = null var bar: Bar = null var quz: Quz = null var xyzzy: Xyzzy = null override def beforeEach(context: BeforeEach): Unit = foo = Foo() bar = Bar(foo) quz = bar.getQuz xyzzy = Xyzzy(foo, quz) widget = Widget(foo, bar) test(\"complicated\") { val results = widget.doStuff(xyzzy) assertEquals(results, xyzzy + foo.use(bar).use(quz)) } \n I'm not seeing a good way to write this with FunFixture My best guess is something like\n class MySuite extends munit.FunSuite: val foo = FunFixture[Foo](setup = _ => Foo()) val bar = FunFixture[Bar](setup = _ => Bar(howDoIGetTheValueOfFoo())) val quz = FunFixture[Quz](setup = _ => somehowGetBar().getQuz val xyzzy = FunFixture[Xyzzy](setup = _ => Xyzzy(getFoo(), getQuz()) val widget = FunFixture[Widget](setup = _ => Widget(getFoo(), getBar()) // Make everything into one fixture with some impressively ugly code val everything = FunFixture.map2(FunFixture.map2(foo, bar), FunFixture.map3(quz, xyzzy, widget)) // Run the test. Make sure you get the parentheses nesting right! everything.test(\"complicated) { ((f, b), (q, x, w)) => val results = w.doStuff(x) assertEquals(results, x + f.use(b).use(q)) } \n By this point, ad-hoc is looking simple and clean. And that's assuming that howDoIGetTheValueOfFoo can even be written and doesn't make it look even more complicated. And I'm not even certain you can unwrap the parameters like I did, so there may be more boilerplate just trying to get the actual values out.\n    submitted by    /u/Udalrich  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Apologies if the following seems dumb. I’m trying to figure something out with cats-effect-3 and scala. I have the following class structure:\n ``` trait Resource { def execute(): F[Output] }\n class A[F[_]] extends Resource { override def execute(): F[Output] = ??? }\n class B[F[_]](a: A[F]) extends Resource { override def execute(): F[Output] = { a.execute().flatMap(…) } } ```\n Each Resource type has an execute method whose output I want to memoize. So that dependent classes (there may be a third class C that can call a.execute) may call it multiple times in any order but they will all get the same value as a result. This would be pretty straightforward with scala’s Future (if I use It instead of F).\n I‘ve seen Async.memoize. However, that changes the signature to F[F[Output]] and I can only execute the “outer” flatMap once, or the results are re-calculated. In this case, I’m not sure how I would allow the dependent classes to use the memoized output.\n I’m relatively new to the Typelevel ecosystem, and I’m not sure if I’m thinking about this correctly. How would I modify the code such that my effect gets executed only once, no matter how many times I call it?\n Should I use the non-typelevel concurrency primitives to handle this outside the effect-system and then wrap it in F?\n I know I can probably orchestrate the “graph” of execution without having each dependent class doing this. But I need to chain the calls these way for the time being.\n ——\n UPDATE [2023/11/20]: For now, I’m going with an AtomicCell that wraps an Option value, and setting it to Some if it’s None (the initial value) using evalUpdateAndGet.

My IDE of choice is IntelliJ, so I tried to make it work there, but so far, not very successfully.\n The first attempt was \"the way I know\" - build using Maven and use the IntelliJ Scala plugin for everything. But there was basically no help from the IDE (no autocomplete etc.).\n So I tried doing it \"the Scala way\" - installed SBT, created a project using the official guide, imported as a BSP project into Intellij using this guide and everything seemed to work - I can run the thing at least :-)\n But when I try to Ctrl+Click something from the standard library (like Seq or max on an Iterable), the IDE navigates to sources of 2.13 instead of 3.3.1. I tried enabling the BSP logs and the classpath SBT is returning is something like\n [ \"file:~/IdeaProjects/my_project/target/scala-3.3.1/classes/\", \"file:~/IdeaProjects/my_project/target/scala-3.3.1/test-classes\", \"file:~/.cache/coursier/v1/https/repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/scala-lang/scala3-library_3/3.3.1/scala3-library_3-3.3.1.jar\", \"file:~/.cache/coursier/v1/https/repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/scala-lang/scala-library/2.13.10/scala-library-2.13.10.jar\" ] \n is it OK that it's sending both Scala 2 and 3 jars? How can I make IntelliJ go to the Scala 3 stdlib on Ctrl+click?\n I'm sure I must be doing a simple msitake somewhere, but I'm out of ideas what to try.

          "description": "Say I'm using Shardcake 2.1.1 which has a dependency on Caliban 2.4.0, which has zio-http 3.0.0-RC2 as a dependency.\n In the same app I want to also use zio-http 3.0.0-RC3 directly for an API, and want that version specifically because it has some features I really want (namely the new routes DSL). It's compiling just fine, but I'm getting run time errors:\n java.net.ConnectException: Connection refused: no further information: localhost/[0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1]:8087 \n Is there a way to handle this without having to fork and/or compile my own versions of Shardcake and Caliban locally until a release or snapshot is made with zio-http-RC3 (or some other future version that has the features I want)? I think I remember having a similar issue in the past because I wanted to use tapir with Caliban and each had a dependency on a different version of zio-http... I got it to compile and then run by breaking up the project into several sub-projects making sure there were no overlaps in dependencies, but this was kind of unwieldy considering it was a fairly small project, so I'd rather not do that again.\n Do correct me if I'm wrong, but from what I've read this isn't an Scala-only thing and also affects Java, so I'm wondering if there's a commonly known workaround for this that I don't know of (maybe some eviction policies in the sbt file, or in Java's case pom file?).\n    submitted by    /u/ToreroAfterOle  \n [link]   [comments]",

One solution might be to simply convert 100% of my org files over to org-roam and essentially use org-roam as a search / file open tool.\n But is there a way in more \"pure\" org-mode to quickly search through a whole mess of files and bring up only the ones with specific tags?\n    submitted by    /u/kryptonik  \n [link]   [comments]",

Even after someone asked him to add an image to his little demo and it took literally FIVE MINUTES and then he cant even format it or move it on the page.\n Every Youtube tutorial is the same - people typing and typing and tying for 20 minutes at a time to do what I can on my phone in literally 30 seconds. Endless Endless ENDLESS obscure shortcuts and menus inside menus beneath submenus - all with no intuitive or conceptual link to navigate between disconnected dumps of unformatted text.\n Even within a single page, theres never anything resembling a visual cue to explain what youre doing to what. And even when you do figure out what one peice of random highlighting means, you can't get anywhere without typing MORE obscure \"shortcuts\". HOW is this better than point and click? Who in their right mind would abandon ~30 years of interface progress for this demonstrably worse navigation method?\n I WOULD say it's the worst UX I've ever seen on any utility, ever - except there literally is not UX . All you end up with, everywhere, is a nigh-on-useless bricks of text, only clumsily navigated through with MORE STUPID SHORTCUTS . How anyone could be expected to manage anything with this is beyond all of us.\n Now he expects us to bring lesson summaries to the tute every week in this incomprehensible garbage, and literally NOBODY in the class has ANY idea how to organise anything in what as far as we can tell is just a glorified notepad, or why it even exits.\n What am I missing?\n EDIT: Well, from the look of the downvotes and cope in the comments, this is going to be one of THOSE \"open source\" communities.

          "description": "I tried looking at org-ql and found it to be a little overcomplicated for my more limited use cases.\n I felt like something simpler should exist, so I'm thinking of creating a mini query language that can be used to reference specific notes.\n Some examples:\n mynotes.org/0 -- grab first note in mynotes.org, a file in the current directory.\n /0/0 - grab first note of the first note of the current file.\n ../sibling note -- subnote of parent of current note with title \"sibling note\".\n /0/0/1 -- relative to current file, 2nd note of the first subnote of the first subnote.\n ./0/1 -- 2nd subnote of the first subnote relative to current note.\n ../0/0 -- 1st subnote of the first subnote relative to the \n The query function would have \"find one\" and \"find all\" functions. find one would fail if there were 0 or 2+ results.\n This query language would be focused around the following needs:\n  \nAbility to straightforwardly pass a reference to a note from one command line app that reads org mode to another.\n Ability to programmatically reference one note from another by relative or absolute location. There are some command line applications I'd like to build around org mode which would need something like this.\n Simplicity. I could add all sorts of bells and whistles to this but it would overburden it.\n  \nThe other idea I had was to just use xpath but apply it to org mode. xpath is well known but I think it's not so well liked, and the above queries would be possible but a lot more gnarly.\n Does this seem like a good idea? Bad idea?\n    submitted by    /u/hitchdev  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "tl;dr - see Question below\n Background / my setup\n So I've used a GTD-like setup in org-mode for a few years now. I'm very much still a noob.\n One thing I feel is slowing me down, particularly at weekly reveiw, is needing to duplicate project headings for tasks (or maybe I'm making a fundamental mistake in my workflow).\n For example, I'd write something like the below and need to type \"Big/Small Important Work Project\" a number of times with my big fat fingers:\n ``` ** Big Important Work Project\n *** TODO: email Amit for stats on Big Important Work Project :computer:\n *** TODO: book room on 5th floor for meeting about Big Important Work Project\n ** Small Important Work Project\n *** TODO: email Amit for stats on Small Important Work Project :computer:\n *** TODO: book room on 4th floor for meeting about Small Important Work Project\n ``` (Note, I don't actually use TODO keywords, except DONE)\n In org mode I can simply use folding to see what project the task is for, however, my reminders are either in Orgzly (agenda widget), or via tasker popups on my phone \n I therefore get tasks like \"call amit\" or \"book room\" a lot, devoid of context.\n Question:\n Is there a way the a project (X-level) heading can be inherited by its children? Maybe appended to them?\n I realise this is not nessecarily an Org, or emacs, problem but I hope I can solve it programatically in emacs.\n    submitted by    /u/thephatmaster  \n [link]   [comments]",

It acted as if it'd never been properly installed.\n  \nJust curious. The baked in DocView is adequate for my needs as if I were to print it properly, I'd use a full PDF viewer like Sumatra.

          "description": "Hello,\n I've switched from vim to emacs recently with evil mode. It's been a great experience so far however, I'm facing an issue with js2-mode syntax highlighting. I appreciate that web-mode is designed for mixed syntax files, if you're say working with templates for front-end web-dev, however I have found it provides far superior syntax highlighting than js2-mode. I haven't noticed any other difference between js2-mode and web-mode apart from this, I guess I've only scratched the surface. I primarily work with js and json files for node.js back-end development and only touch front-end, where I guess web-mode would be excellent a minority of the time. The error highlighting seems to be same for both, driven by lsp-mode. I haven't touched ESlint yet (been using ts-ls so far), only just installed it.\n I guess my questions boil down to:\n Why should I use 1 over the other especially given the syntax highlighting preference?\n How does flycheck / flymake play into this, what are the differences?\n Is it fine to run 2 language servers for lsp-mode / how does that work? Using lsp-describe-session shows both of them running?\n As a side-note does anyone have a config with lsp-ui and peek that they're willing share for some inspiration / things I've missed.\n I also have tern running is this required?\n Thank you in advance.\n ​\n    submitted by    /u/PracticalViking  \n [link]   [comments]",

The way to turn that off is to pass -header-insertion=never on its cmd line.\n In eglot with recent trunk emacs, the C-related modes are configured by default like this, in eglot-server-programs:  ((c-mode c-ts-mode c++-mode c++-ts-mode) . ,(eglot-alternatives '(\"clangd\" \"ccls\"))) \n So I could splice that out and replace it, for sure. But then I lose the alternative of using ccls if that's what's installed, and it seems fragile with all the ts- stuff happening these days. So my question is, is there a way to configure eglot to say \"when invoking clangd, always pass -header-insertion=never? And if not, would that be a useful addition?

I've been using Emacs for a few years now but please, treat me as a total beginner!\n Magit is one of the most incredible tools available but it is frustratingly slow on big git repos, especially when they're located on a slow file system. I very often find myself giving 2-3 commands in a row and only seeing the output in a few seconds.\n E.g. I'd type (1) f u to fetch all, then (2) r e to trigger rebase elsewhere and then start typing (3) /mast so the counsel wrapper can find origin/master and then I press Enter. I basically do all steps (1)-(3) and will only see any output >5s later.\n This definitely breaks the workflow and I would at least expect Emacs not to freeze between inputs (1), (2) and (3) and just give me clues that there's a process running in background.\n Is it something possible or should I try to use some optimisation tricks to do less on every magit operation?\n Thanks\n    submitted by    /u/tereshkd  \n [link]   [comments]",

You can find the analysis in my EmacsConf2023 presentation - https://emacsconf.org/2023/talks/gc/ and https://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10213384 (reproducible analysis).\n The key takeaways from the above analysis:\n For users:\n  \nEmacs freezes due to GC are real\n … but not for all users\n When GC does get Emacs slower, it is either \n slow startup ⇒ increase gc-cons-threshold to 20-80Mb check gc-elapsed after startup\n slow and frequent GC ⇒ increase gc-cons-percetage to 0.2-1.0 but watch Emacs RAM usage\n \n  \nFor Emacs devs:\n  \nGC problem is very real for many users (9% of GCs are both frequent and slow)\n It is worth bumping gc-cons-threshold temporarily during startup\n Ideally, we should switch from Mark&Sweep to something more performant\n May increase gc-cons-percetage, but need to get user data for optimal numbers\n  \nFurther plans:\n  \nWith the collected data we can hopefully continue emacs-devel discussion on changing GC defaults and get somewhere. https://yhetil.org/emacs-devel/20230310110747.4hytasakomvdyf7i@Ergus/\n \nemacs-gc-stats package has now served its purpose, but I think that it might still be useful for people who want to toy around GC settings. I plan to add some kind of \"session summary\" command that will display the key statistics of current user session. It should help understanding the effects of GC customization on the performance.\n \n    submitted by    /u/yantar92  \n [link]   [comments]",

Do folks have a way to do this in mu4e they could share? \n I can, using org-mime, compose HTML emails if I need to. I also can view HTML emails using xwidgets. And I can attach the HTML email to an outgoing message using mu4e-action-capture-message and mu4e-compose-attach-captured-message. But is there a way to make the HTML content of the original email so that it's rendered inline as it were? (Sorry, I'm not sure I got the terminology right here...)\n I tried looking at the raw message I capture with mu4e-action-capture-message, thinking I might be able to (a) open that file, (b) find the HTML content I need, and (c) insert it as an html part. But I didn't have much luck. (For one thing, the HTML bit of the raw email doesn't render the same as the original one somehow.) \n I'm close to a sort of working solution, by just replacing disposition=attachment with disposition=inline in the output of calling mu4e-compose-attach-captured-message. But I feel like I don't quite understand what I'm doing and would appreciate any pointers or suggestions.\n (I've searched around and found a few discussions of issues related to this, but nothing there seemed to help with my particular issue---there's an issue at the mu repo which prompted me to use the capture+attach workflow I mentioned above, but that's the closest I've got to an answer so far...)\n    submitted by    /u/graduale  \n [link]   [comments]",

If there is a way to indicate the status of the Caps Lock and Num Lock keys I'm yet to discover it.\n There are other similar types whose light patterns programmable, but on this one they appear to be permamently lit.\n It seems that the keyboard vendors charge a hefty premium for a \"gaming\" keyboard with a UK layout, and my view is that if I have to reprogram the keyboard whether UK or US then I might as well stick to the cheaper US one and reprogram it.\n I got this one for all of £7.99 in baby pink because I could use the color therapy and I love the tactile feedback. I'm not sure how it will last though because one of the keys came off easily.\n UK keyboards have a smaller Left-Shift key with the key for \\ and | next to it, before the Z, and on this keyboard \\ is activated by Alt-Shift - and | is activated by Alt-, below theESC` key.\n I want to use Alt-= for the | key to keep it closer. Currently pressing Alt-= produces nothing until it is pressed again after which it produces ¸, some kind of tiny right-angled character.\n I have read a few guides which are general and are targetted for Linux from bottom up, but I'd prefer something Emacsy if there is one, and if EXWM requires additional consideration.\n PS. I got another even smaller one in baby blue with 61 keys which I also need to program, but that may have to wait, and boy I never had a glimmer of what Emacs pinky could feel like until I tried to use the basic navigation keys which require the Function and Alt keys to activate them.\n    submitted by    /u/vfclists  \n [link]   [comments]",

For example, here is an obfuscated portion of the config:\n  (use-package gnus :ensure nil :custom (gnus-select-method '(nnnil nil)) (gnus-summary-exit-hook 'gnus-summary-expire-articles) (gnus-secondary-select-methods '((nnimap \"mymail\" (nnimap-address \"mail.mymail.com\") (nnimap-server-port \"imaps\") (nnimap-stream ssl) (nnir-search-engine imap) (nnmail-expiry-target \"nnimap+mymail:Trash\") (nnmail-expiry-wait immediate))) \n In particular I want messages to expire immediately and be moved into my Trash folder. When I am inside a group summary, I can manually mark messages as Expired with E. Then I could manually expire them with B e or M-x gnus-summary-expire-articles. When I exit the summary buffer the messages appear in the Trash folder as expected. However I also have the gnus-summary-exit-hook set to call the same function. This configuration is actually unnecessary since that is the default setting. When I just exit the summary buffer, I see Expiring articles...done . . . but they aren't moved to the Trash folder. \n I am pretty confused by this behavior as I see no difference between the two invocations of gnus-summary-expire-articles. My config is also almost a mirror of most recent GNUS guides/configurations so I feel like I must be missing something simple or everyone else would experience the same behavior.\n Has anyone else had this issue?\n    submitted by    /u/capenius  \n [link]   [comments]",

I don't have a link to the article, but even as a slightly seasoned Lisper I thought the fainter parenthesis improved readability. \n So I'm wondering if/how it's possible to achieve this effect in emacs.

          "description": "ultra-scroll-mac: scroll like lightning\n Emacs-mac is a beautiful port, and was the first to offer pixel-precise smooth scrolling nearly a decade ago. But with modern high-resolution trackpads and high density displays, I found its scrolling handlers just couldn't keep up. On large, full-screen buffers in a heavy mode, trackpad scrolling verged on painful, and, maddeningly, was much worse in one direction than the other. And no wonder: modern trackpads deliver scroll events >50⨉ per second! The other key problem with all known smooth scrolling packages is they tend to stutter and loop back as you try to scroll across images taller than the window.\n This package solves both of these problems:\n  \nScrolling performance has been increased 25-50⨉ — you move your fingers, the page responds, instantly.\n Large image handling has been worked around so you can scroll right across them without any hiccups.\n As a bonus, dumb mice get pretty good smooth(-ish) scrolling too.\n  \nI'll be contributing the core scrolling functions upstream, so hopefully pixel-precision-scroll-mode (which inspired this package, and is recommended on other builds) can make use of some of these improvements in the future.\n Finally, this was all (to me) surprisingly hard to achieve, which you can read all about if you are a glutton.\n    submitted by    /u/JDRiverRun  \n [link]   [comments]",

That makes sense, there's a slow network call somewhere in the works that's gumming things up.\n I'm using eglot for lsp and would expect that would be the source of a slow jsonrpc call, maybe eglot trying to get completion candidates on every keystroke through the LSP server?

          "description": "Hello fellow Emacs enthusiasts,\n I'm reaching out to see if there's anyone here who's successfully integrated a modern development environment within Emacs for Python programming. Specifically, I'm interested in a setup that incorporates eglot, tree-sitter and company.\n I've encountered a significant issue: whenever I enable python-ts-mode, Emacs consumes all my system's memory and crashes. While I've managed to use a more basic setup that limits tree-sitter to syntax highlighting only, I can't shake the feeling that I'm missing out on some great functionality.\n To help with investigation:\n  \nI am running on a Mac\n The bare minimum to reproduce this problem is on the following gist: https://gist.github.com/hnarayanan/a6397d6723fce19e2802d4305071e611\n I happen to use Emacs from MacPorts, but to double-check, I also attempted to download it from https://emacsformacosx.com and it crashed in the same way\n This seems to happen independent of the language server used in the backend. I intend on using python-lsp-server, but it fails even if I don't have it installed.\n  \nHas anyone faced a similar problem and found a solution? Perhaps I am doing something very wrong with my config? I'm eager to learn from your experiences and would greatly appreciate any advice or tips you can offer.\n Thank you!\n ⚠️Edit⚠️\n This appears to be something inherently broken with tree-sitter as installed by MacPorts (or the particular language grammar for Python). I decided to dig into this and built both tree-sitter and Emacs from scratch, and they work really well together without my memory problems.\n    submitted by    /u/copingbear  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi,\n I am not sure if many people are using alerts for the appointments, I do, I like the behavior where it brings Emacs to the front and shows a message in the mini buffer. However, when I am quickly writing in another application I sometimes end up writing in the active buffer. I am contemplating creating a function which puts the buffer in read only mode before showing switching to Emacs, if it was not already Read Only, and restores it when the reminder disappears. That should be enough to avoid accidental writing.\n Before I embark in that task I would like to know if anybody has done anything like that, or any other creative ideas to avoid contaminating the current buffer.\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/maufdez  \n [link]   [comments]",

Monaspace has a similar feature that it calls \"texture healing.\" Characters are moved around slightly, or swapped out for a slightly larger or smaller character to even out the spacing, for example, when a wide character like an 'm' is followed by a narrow character like an 'l'. \n The effect looks nice on their web sites. It worked in VSCode, but not in Emacs. The \"smart kerning\" / \"texture healing\" features did not seem to be activated when I tried the fonts in Emacs. \n How would I get this to work in Emacs? The Monaspace docs say you have to add \"'calt'\" to \"editor.ligatures\" in the VSCode Settings. Commit Mono just worked without changing the settings.\n I might end up hating the moving around, but I'd have to try it for a few hours to see.

          "description": "Hello r/emacs! First-time poster here!\n I recently wanted to visualise some data in org-mode using a Python source block to generate an image, which was then rendered directly in the buffer.\n It took my a couple of goes to work out how to do it. \n Given some data like this:\n ```org\n +begin_src bash :results output file :file data.njson\n echo '{\"name\": \"Spock\", \"editor\": \"Emacs\"} {\"name\": \"James Kirk\", \"editor\": \"Vim\"} {\"name\": \"Dr McCoy\", \"editor\": \"Vim\"} {\"name\": \"Scotty\", \"editor\": \"Emacs\"} {\"name\": \"Worf\", \"editor\": \"ed\"} {\"name\": \"Geordi LaForge\", \"editor\": \"Emacs\"} {\"name\": \"Data\", \"editor\": \"Emacs\"} {\"name\": \"Jean-luc Picard\", \"editor\": \"VS Code\"} {\"name\": \"Wesley Crusher\", \"editor\": \"VS Code\"} {\"name\": \"William Riker\", \"editor\": \"Vim\"} '\n +end_src\n ```\n A visualisation can be rendered as follows:\n ```org\n +begin_src python :results output file :file usage.png\n import pandas as pd import seaborn as sns import sys\n df = pd.read_json(\"data.njson\", lines=True) axes = sns.histplot(df, x=\"editor\") axes.get_figure().savefig(sys.stdout.buffer)\n +end_src\n ```\n The main trick here is to set the :results output file header argument to write the output to a file, and to save the figure to sys.stdout.buffer from Python.\n I've written about this on my blog too, where you can see the [unsurprising] results of the analysis!\n    submitted by    /u/akuszyk  \n [link]   [comments]",

I feel I'm missing something very basic here.\n I was using org-roam today in doom emacs and forgot how irritating adding a new node is while writing. \n It nestles nicely up to the text before it - with no space in between. After posting on r/orgroam a kind soul told me this might be a wider issue - at least related to org itself, and maybe doom.\n Does anyone know how to get a leading space before the node name / link? For example; my nodes come out looking like:\n something interesting is in thisNODENAME/LINK check it out\n For the love of RMS I want a space between this and NODENAME\n I'm clearly being dumb, but can't figure this out. Surely enough people use emacs / doom emacs / org mode, and they are not all adding links everywhere with no leading space?\n A suggestion on r/orgroam was put a double space before a link - is that it?\n    submitted by    /u/thephatmaster  \n [link]   [comments]",

A good option would be to fold the output when there are multiple matches, then I can use the Tab keep to expand the fold and scan through the previews and even edit them right away.\n \nThe search panel is modal. It doesn't create a result buffer which you can save and then return to later to continue to select files to edit. Once you lose focus it is gone. It doesn't even seem to retain the search term so you can use it later.\n \nIt would be nice to have a window that shows the actual CLI command passed to the search utility.

          "description": "Aside from new language sources that the community can contribute at any time, this package feels more or less feature complete now.\n v1.0.0 on GitHub\n For those who don't know, treesit-auto enables automatic detection, installation, and usage of tree-sitter grammars and modes in Emacs 29+. Vanilla Emacs exposes some variables and functions that facilitate this behavior, but without treesit-auto it's up to you to check when tree-sitter is available and configure how Emacs behaves when it is (or isn't). This package takes that work away from you and is designed to fit what the vast majority of users would expect from automatic use of tree-sitter in Emacs.\n This started out as just my own configuration to treesit-language-source-alist, major-mode-remap-alist, and auto-mode-alist, but now has a lot of features that didn't exist just under a year ago when I first announced it.\n  \nAutomatic detection and installation for built-in tree-sitter modes, such as rust-ts-mode, yaml-ts-mode, toml-ts-mode, typescript-ts-mode, and go-ts-mode. You can get this behavior through the treesit-auto-add-to-auto-mode-alist function (the name is too long...I know)\n Less buggy behavior overall, such as ensuring we switch to the tree-sitter mode after installing it\n Detecting and installing grammars required by the current mode, such as TypeScript and TSX requiring each other\n  \nThis package isn't perfect. It's honestly still a bit of a hack, and many parts of the code are too clever for my own liking. It does its job, though, and I've been a happy, daily user of it for the last 9 months or so.

Throughout that time there have been periods where I really leaned in to it and tried to use it for everything, and there have been periods where I only used it for org and/or magit, etc. I've learned lots of things about it and I've forgotten lots of things about it, but I've never been what I would call an \"expert\" or even a \"power user\". So, when I feel like something isn't working well in Emacs, I almost always default to the assumption that I'm doing something wrong or misunderstanding something, etc. \n So, it very well may be that I'm wrong/crazy in my recent conclusion that use-package might not be the ideal abstraction for managing Emacs packages.\n With that out of the way, I'll say that when I first saw use-packag…",

          "description": "Good morning,\n I recently have become enamored of Typst for document creation. It's fast, it's approachable, it's cross platform, and it's extremely capable even in preview beta. I never really got the swing of LaTeX with all the backslash/curlybrace mayhem. \n In any event, I find myself actually working on a long technical document in Typst in Emacs. There does exist typst-ts-mode so thanks tree-sitter and all those people who manage the grammar libraries for it. However I'm finding myself in need of a better way of navigating the huge document to get to sections I want to do.\n I looked into the baked-in bookmarks and I could probably use that capability, though I was hoping for more of an customizeable outline mode. Manually setting the bookmarks for an entire document seems tedious. I mainly just want to navigate by headings and that would be sufficient.\n What do people use for this sort of thing (possibly in the LaTeX world?) Just bookmarks with some sort of automated way of populating the bookmarks? I did check the typst-ts-mode and while there are some functions there for compiling, there don't seem to be any functions for navigating by semantic structures. Perhaps that's baked into tree-sitter itself?\n Anyhow, any help greatly appreciated here.\n    submitted by    /u/remillard  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Greetings,\nI come to you, specialists and sages of the Zettelkasten, in a quest to understand something I cannot wrap my head around… \nI've read How to Take Smart Notes, I've practiced the method successfully for writing fiction, but there is something I cannot yet figure (or maybe need validation to implement?).\nHow do you manage that which you know you do not know, or do not know enough, or realize you did not know? That is:\nHow do you manage questions, which can be ongoing on life? (\"How to be a good man in the 21st Century?\")\nHow do you navigate and evolve forming practices? (Like: the Zettelkasten method, which you hone in through practice, and evolve insight: \"this works for me, I should pay attention to that\")\nHow do you walk back on ideas that do not serve you anymore, or that you realize were false? (like an early 20st Century scientist witnessing the ether being disproved, meaning all theories and constructs pertaining to it become completely irrelevant apart from scientific history)\nI guess the underlying issue is \"transient\" content, which is a little bit at odds with the concept of permanent / evergreen note / Zettel. Now I know a Zettelkasten is personal, that truth is unattainable and everything is potentially transient – please bear with me here 🙂 I also know, in Luhmann's words, that the Zettelkasten is a \"septic tank\".\nAnd yet. What would be best practices for capturing accruing, unformed ideas and questions, which would free the user by knowing they will not pollute the system down the road if they turn out to be dead ends?\nIs it a simple matter of trusting that linking will isolate irrelevant content? Or should you prune links later, remove notes – but potentially destroying the path of thinking that led you to where you are now? Is it a much simpler matter of redirecting the energy of the system simply by altering the geometry of structure notes?\nAny insight and especially technical approaches would be hugely appreciated. Thank you!",

So far, the disadvantages outweigh the benefits, but the difference is getting closer to a tipping point.\nThings I'm reading:\nMorris, Mary. My ideal bookshelf. 2012.\nAttia, Peter. Outlive: the science & art of longevity. 2023.\nCalvino, Italo. The road to San Giovanni. 1994.\nCalvino, Italo. Difficult loves. 2017.\nManguel, Alberto. A history of reading. 2014.\nDavis, Lydia. Essays one. 2020.\nMusic I'm listening to:\nLofi Girl\nCarla Bley\nDarkside\nLive from Studio 52\n★★★★★\nThe \"My rolling ten-day zettel production\" is produced by a script for attachment to my daily journaling template. I do my journaling in Bear to keep personal journaling separate from my knowledge work.\nLet me know if you would like to discuss any of these notes.\n\nMy ten day zettel production",
