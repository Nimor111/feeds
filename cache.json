We do a bit of “deeper Haskell” and maintain a few OSS projects, but primarily we build stuff that serves our customers.\n The product is in the e-signing space and this is usually categorized as \"legaltech\". For me it is more \"get the world rid of paper\" and \"help people reach agreements over distance\".\n https://careers.scrive.com/jobs/996814-haskell-developer\n EU residency and work permit is required, as is fluency in English (Norway and Switzerland are fine, UK is not). This part sadly accounts for the majority of rejections we have had to communicate, but we really need these two things.\n We are “remote-first” for developers. I was recruited via this reddit 5 years ago and I am still full remote.\n We need more than 20 people over the next 12-18 months.

Instead, try creating a new cabal project, change directory to the \"app\" folder in it, and open \"Main.hs\" file with nvim. And for some reason, it's got to be the Main.hs file in app; if you don't HLS will still attach but theres still an annoying error message.\n I have no idea why this works, but at this point, I'm just happy that hls even attached.

          "description": "This is a hard question to ask, because people are used to taking machine integers as primitives, so they don't really get what I'm trying to say. The thing is, all hash functions are designed to be fast in conventional processors. But there are contexts where ints either don't exist, or aren't the most efficient option. For example, zk-snark circuits don't have the usual machine integers, and brainfuck has only inc/dec/if. If you wanted fast hash functions on these environments, it is unlikely that sha2/keccak/blake would perform better than something designed for them.\n I'm particularly looking for a hash function that is efficient on the pure untyped λ-calculus. Without native integers, our best bet is to λ-encode the data, thus, the most powerful primitive we have is pattern-matching. The performance of a hash function can thus be measured/approximated by the amount of pattern-matches it performs. The question is: what are simple hash functions that perform well on such context?\n I've asked this question on Stack Overflow, but it didn't receive attention, which is why I'm reposting here.

After hearing so much about haskell.nix and its cross compilation capabilities, I finally decided to give it a go and try cross compiling some of my projects to arm linux and android.\n Following the guides provided by haskell.nix, I was able to get my projects building with nix, and successfully built some static binaries that ran on my pinephone using the aarch64-unknown-musl target. Unfortunately, I have not had as much success with targeting android.\n I was wondering if anyone has had any success cross compiling their Haskell projects via nix (be it haskell.nix or otherwise) to run on Android. I know there is mobile haskell, and a couple of blog posts out there explaining how to build a cross-compiling GHC manually, but I really like the idea of using nix, as it seems like a more hands-off approach, kind of like Rust's cross It would be especially helpful if anyone had any projects doing this successfully already that I might be able to take a look at.\n Haskell.nix has worked really nicely for me so far otherwise, so ideally I'd use that. Is there perhaps some additional configuration I need to add to my default.nix to get my projects building correctly to target Android? I am still very much a nix noob, so I'm honestly not even sure what sorts of things I can try. Nothing on the haskell.nix documentation seemed particularly relevant to my situation.\n I'm fine with using any relatively recent version of GHC, but I've been trying to accomplish this with the GHC versions listed as supported by haskell.nix.\n    submitted by    /u/sintrastes  \n [link]   [comments]",

This corresponds to call by name evaluation and is the basis of the linearity via arrows approach linear haskell uses. The second way encodes a -> b into !(a -o b). This way corresponds to call by value evaluation and is the basis of linearity via kinds.\n Borrowing the syntax from the linear haskell paper, here's an encoding of the !(a -o b) embedding of intuitionistic logic.\n ​\n https://preview.redd.it/2h2k3rd7sim71.png?width=1490&format=png&auto=webp&s=45da1108dc562a8c09827f17bea89bb95ca6a567\n This system uses the same context multiplication that linear haskell uses except it places the multiplication on the lambda rather than the function call. This version of let! let here is limited to only work on functions; but it can be generalized to work with a kind based linearity system or a typeclass based linearity system.\n In linear haskell the multiplicity parameter of an arrow chooses between either !a -o b or a -o b. In this system the multiplicity parameter of an arrow choose between !(a -o b) and a -o b. This choose doesn't have to be mutually exclusive. Here's a system that supports both.\n ​\n ​\n https://preview.redd.it/fjwm4je8sim71.png?width=1538&format=png&auto=webp&s=281f08913785efe5f781bdd5d0b2599c4695591b\n Though I think this isn't worth the extra complexity.\n    submitted by    /u/superstar64  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi everyone! I think I have a challenging issue in front of me, but I might be wrong. The application I'm building needs to handle possibly non-terminating computations gracefully and remain responsive while running them. I thought most of the problem would be solved by running it in a separate thread, but it seems a bit more complicated than that. I want to abort a computation when it's memory usage hits a certain limit. I thought the -M RTS option would work fine for this, but when the program reaches it's memory limit, it just keeps going while memory usage remains more or less constant. However, it seems the application becomes effectively single-threaded for a while before a heap overflow exception is thrown, which makes it very slow to respond. I'm not able to reproduce it with a simple foldr (+) 0 [1..5000000] though, so it's something specific about the computation I'm running. I'm thinking the GC is trying very hard for a while to free enough memory for the computation to continue, which causes a time-frame where other threads are blocked a lot and don't have memory available for them.\n Ideally, I'd like to just keep the application from freezing for more than 100ms while the GC does it's work, because sometimes the memory-intensive computation does complete after entering the single-threaded time-frame and I'm getting the feeling that GHC is a bit lazy about garbage collection while it has enough space, but a way to prevent the unresponsiveness time frame by killing the thread early would also be okay.\n But if someone has a better idea of what's going on here that would be nice already. I can publish the full source if needed, but I think it would quite a bit of work to go through/install the application.\n Edit: Using GHC 8.6.5 (because of GHCJS) if that's relevant\n    submitted by    /u/cdfa98  \n [link]   [comments]",

It increases until the sum is printed and soon afterwards it prints \"post\".

I hope someone can explain.\n Edit: using GHC 8.6.5\n    submitted by    /u/cdfa98  \n [link]   [comments]",

In C# I could write something like\n  private static List<object> transformSomeElementFirstTimeItOccurs(List<object> list) { bool done = false; var result = new List<object>(); foreach (var elem in list) { if (!done && elem is SomeType) { result.Add(transformElement(elem)); done = true; } else { result.Add(elem); } } return result; } \n My naieve attempt at achieving this in PureScript currently looks as follows.\n  transformSomeElementFirstTimeItOccurs :: List ElemType -> List ElemType transformSomeElementFirstTimeItOccurs elems = reverse (loop elems).result where loop :: List ElemType -> { done :: Boolean , result :: List ElemType } loop = foldl (\\{ result, done } elem -> case elem of SomeValueConstructor t -> { result : SomeValueConstructor (if done then t else transformValue t):result , done : true } _ -> { result : elem:result, done }) { result : Nil, done : false } \n But it feels like it could use some improvement.

I'd rather not roll my own if I can help it :)\n Any help or advice you could provide would be appreciated.\n    submitted by    /u/RisingMaverick  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "HI, I am trying since few days org mode and have millions of lines of documents. The idea would be to read ONE document really long in 4 or 5 different columns. I noticed that if I open an emacs instance I do not need too much width, so I can exploit the height of my laptop enlarging vertically the file, but the height is limited to around 25 cms in a laptop. Because org does not wrap the content on default, I can open an instance vertically in 1/5 of the screen width, so 4/5 of the screen are not used at all! There is an option to open a subsection on the right of the first instance, but why not opening different columns and see all the long document or almost, so that in one single screen we may have an outline on 2-3- 4 or even 5 columns on almost all the document. So that we may scroll one column for instance the second and so the all the columns also scroll accordingly, so that we can see for instance almost all the chapters of a huge book , then could open some paragraphs title of chapter 33 and 56, and compare them together, move content in seconds etc. The simple idea is that people say mindmaps give more an helicopter vision of all the document(and in fact mind maps take all the screen), everyone in the org community debates if files should have links or stay in a single file.Why not giving to the users the possibility to open multiple columns with scrolling integration, so that the user can see huge documents with a glance, be more creative, modify things, search occurrences, it would be genial imo, because org supports different colors per level on default, and would be really easy to spot the structure and be more efficient, combine new ideas creatively, never miss the big picture, etc\n    submitted by    /u/ndrokky  \n [link]   [comments]",

I would like to constantly have it in view, but I'm not sure where to start with setting this up. I have a macbook pro and an iPad, but I would prefer not to use a separate app like BeOrg, since I'm very used to looking at the agenda as I've configured it.\n Thanks.\n    submitted by    /u/gollyned  \n [link]   [comments]",

I could do the same from within emacs I'm sure.\n I have one file per chapter, which is natural and works for me. I can maybe be dissuaded. I think every file wants a `#+TITLE:`, at least because pandoc requires it or complains. If I output \"one chapter\" (file), everything looks great. The (chapter) title looks just the way I like it.\n If I do the following with pandoc:\n pandoc -s *.org -o my_book.pdf \n The problem is that the titles of the chapters end up all mashed together at the top of the document.

The other windmove bindings do show up in C-h b though. When I'm in another buffer with a different mode all of my windmove bindings work fine.

I want to split this into the first occurrence, and the rest of the sequence.\n I've seen that you can do C-c C-t to use org-todo to mark a recurring event as done, but that seems to create a list-item, not an entire sub-tree.\n Is this possible?

But I noticed a strange behaviour with emacs, even the default one, without using my own init/settings file. Some of the code is not highlighted properly. For example in the picture below you can see that some of my function calls are properly colored in blue, while other function calls are not. What is even stranger is when i type a function call (a single call on one line) it is still not coloured, and is black font. The examples below are using the default emacs settings run like that -> \"C:\\Program Files\\Emacs\\x86_64\\bin\\runemacs.exe\" -q\n As you can see below, in two different function definitions, function calls in the first one are plain black, in the second one they are properly coloured blue. Even functions that do not exist. The file i am using is a standalone, i.e the includes are not valid for this file, i just copied it on my desktop to test emacs. (I hope its not because that)\n ​\n https://preview.redd.it/h4q6mtmgrho71.png?width=627&format=png&auto=webp&s=e4029e9a615376e706602da6c7e7f05fcd296a09\n ​\n https://preview.redd.it/0kt737xcrho71.png?width=547&format=png&auto=webp&s=17e26713af27c91395efd0c6498a669020195c7d\n    submitted by    /u/asmodeus812  \n [link]   [comments]",

Check out the get started docs to learn more!\n You can find the whole story about this new release here, but the gist is:\n  \nA lot of polishing of theming support, as well as the design of the default theme\n Some improvements for the blogging support, like fixing generating URLs, adding an RSS template to the default theme\n Many new features and bug fixes in templatel (the templating library)\n Lots of bug fixes\n  \nIf that sounded interesting to you, check out more about weblorg and templatel :)\n  \nwebsite: https://emacs.love/weblorg/\n github: https://github.com/emacs-love/weblorg\n templatel: https://github.com/clarete/templatel\n  \nI'd love to hear what you think,\n Cheers\n    submitted by    /u/clarete  \n [link]   [comments]",

Things that don't work for example:\n ​\n  \nMost themes have poor/non-existant support for terminal. Various things like diff mode etc look pretty bad out of box in some themes (bad as in point of making diff unreadable).\n Out of box for example, flycheck-mode errors don't show up in terminal mode until you hunt down and enable errors to be displayed in margin.\n Since we don't have fringes in terminal, since I was displying bookmarks in fringe, no visual bookmarks either.\n Things like dap-mode etc don't work properly. Again part of this is, lack of fringes in terminal mode.\n  \n​\n I think having some sort of fringe in terminal emacs will make it better but then it falls to individual mode writers (but I don't know if core emacs can somehow make it easier).\n    submitted by    /u/axiomatic_345  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Coming from a vim + tmux background, the way display-buffer chooses to pop-up or overwrite existing windows can be kind of annoying. At first, I just set display-buffer-base-action to prefer putting buffers in the current window. Then, I started thinking about e.g. help buffers - I actually did want them to pop up sometimes, because I didn't want to have to create a new window, switch to it, and then open help every time I wanted to look up a function. However, after spending an hour working on getting display-buffer-alist to demonstrate my desired behavior, I realized I had created a really similar configuration to the default display-buffer logic.\n At this point, I started to wonder if the problem was just with me - maybe my problem with windows is that I don't grok buffers. Maybe there's a Zen of window management where - when magit appears on top of the mu4e buffer with the commit hash your lead was telling you to look at, or help pops up and squishes the window with your code into a postage stamp - a more seasoned graybeard would react with equanimity, recognizing that carefully cultivated window configurations were ephemeral, but that their contents are everlasting, and be able to retrieve and reorder things without getting annoyed or losing flow.\n Or, maybe display-buffer just sucks.

I am both interested in why this happens but I also want to know how to properly debug this so I can figure out if this is a feature/bug or just a setting I can tweak.\n What I have found out so far is that it is happening whenever I open a node that is not already loaded into a buffer (e.g. if I re-visit a node it doesn't happen). So seems something is happening when 'org-roam-node-find' and later 'org-roam-node-file' ?\n This is not happening on my personal computer but only on my work computer (so far).

For example, inserting an org header \"* xyz\" in one might add a markdown header \"# xyz\" in the other.\n It was (in theory) extensible to use any 2 formats that can round-trip convert to one another I think it only supported one pair of formats currently, as a test. I also think it was from a few years ago, maybe 2017.\n The author worked in (computional?) low-level biology, I think DNA sequencing, or something related like blood research.

          "description": "Hej fellow 'macsers,\n TL:DR: I want to use query-replace in an open dired buffer, which considers the file-names of ALL directories and subdirectories present in said buffer. Is that possible? How?\n I am trying to get my music sorted using the beet music library manager. So far, it works quite well. However, I own some more or less obscure music for which there are no proper musicbrainz entries so that the proper tagging/renaming doesn't work.\n Now, I am tempted to simply ignore one source of error - a suffix such as \"(Original Mix)\" appended to the \"ARTIST - TITLE\" scheme. This way, I am able to get more tagging done and have less manual work to do afterwards.\n However, I want this problem fixed at a later stage, and I thought I might as well just open a dired buffer, and query-replace should have me covered (in combination with wdired). And it does - provided that I have opened one particular (sub-)directory to which query-replace is then applied. But since I don't know in which directory the \"bad\" file namings are to be found, I would have to open any and all subdirectories manually for this method to work. Unacceptable (think of Lemongrab in Adventure Time :D)\n Is there a possibility to make dired / query-replace behave in the way that I expect / want them to? Are there other utilities (in emacs or else) that can do what I want?\n Any tips / advice are very welcome. Have a good day, folks!\n EDIT: It seems like I've just been offered two probably working solutions. One includes invoking M-x find-dired RET RET, while the other consists in changing the subdir switch to include -R (in dired, C-u s, then -R). Will test both in due time, but so far, thanks a bunch, u/protesilaos and u/xenodium!\n EDIT2: I've settled with the solution suggested by u/protesilaos. I appreciate when I can stay within the dired interface, and changing the subdir switch seems more intuitive to me.\n Thanks a bunch, folks!\n    submitted by    /u/olivuser  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi Emacsers! I've been using some variant of this code for several months (I started writing it quite soon after I began using Emacs) and have found it extremely useful. Maybe you will too. From the readme:\n  \nAside is a package written with the aim of making it easy and convenient to use side windows for arbitrary sets of buffers. Specifically, Aside lets you specify a configuration for a window which determines which buffers are displayed in that window, where the window is located, specific customisations that window should have, and defines a ‘do-what-I-mean’ (DWIM) command for navigating to and toggling the visibility of the window, all in less than a dozen lines of code. Much of this flexibility springs directly from Emacs’ built-in ‘display-buffer-alist’ variable, however Aside can make it more convenient to define configurations for ‘display-buffer-alist’ that you can easily separate and use independently from one another, and Emacs does not come with any equivalent to the DWIM commands Aside can generate.\n  \nIt comes with several pre-made configurations, each of which I use extensively myself. Those configurations set up dedicated windows for browsing projects in Dired, making a Vterm terminal always accessible, and ensuring help, search, and compiler warning buffers always show up in the same place. Some of the configurations are a single call to aside-define-configuration, but the Vterm and especially the Dired configuration are a bit more complex. Please try it out if it sounds useful and let me know what you think. If people find this layer of functionality on top of buffer-display-alist valuable, I'm thinking of asking to have it added to ELPA.\n https://git.sr.ht/~mfa/aside/\n    submitted by    /u/Matt-Beshara  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi all!\n I have been working on PEL while learning Emacs, to help me remember commands, organize my Elisp code and to hopefully help new Emacs users get going. \n It comes with extensive set of topic oriented PDF quickcards, a manual and code that loads (relatively) fast, with init.el and early-init templates, canned customization files; it controls features through customization. Once a feature is identified by customization it will download it, install it and provide key bindings. No Elisp code writing required by users. \n PEL supports commands to activate package quickstart and implements a fast startup mode that extends package quickstart idea (by bundling packages into one mega package to reduce the load-path) but also available in Emacs 26. With it I have achieved 0.1 second startup for over 200 external packages (244 directories in load-path). More info on the Github page. I'll be adding support for new packages. PEL won't be for everyone but hopefully some people will find it useful. \n Feedback welcome.\n Cheers :-)\n    submitted by    /u/prouleau001  \n [link]   [comments]",

Basically, it's about discovering Joplin  and other software, along with different methods to manage information and organize in our daily lives. Among these methods is the Zettelkasten method; or, at least, what I understand of it.\n\nThe point of this post is two-fold: first, I hope that the workshop might make you discover some interesting things that you might use yourself. In particular, I found it interesting to articulate the P.A.R.A method and the Zettelkasten method together, and using open-source software to wrap it all together.\nSecond, I would really enjoy having your opinion on how the Zettelkasten method is presented in the workshop. I believe that you all know much more about it that I do, along with having much more experience with it. Therefore, if you feel like I've missed some things, or if you think that it could be explained in a better way (since the workshop is designed for people that have never heard of it), I'd be delighted to hear it. You can share it here, or indicate it as an issue on the GitHub repository of the workshop.\nI thank you all for all of your fascinating insights about the Zettelkasten method and your use of it; it has always been a pleasure to come here and read about your experience with it.\nHave a nice day !",

          "description": "The Collector's Fallacy, which Christian Tietze has written about, is an example of the Exploration-Exploitation Dilemma, also known as the multi-armed bandit problem.  From Wikipedia:\n\n  \nThe multi-armed bandit problem models an agent that simultaneously attempts to acquire new knowledge (called \"exploration\") and optimize their decisions based on existing knowledge (called \"exploitation\"). The agent attempts to balance these competing tasks in order to maximize their total value over the period of time considered.\n\n\nIn the case of the Collector, the \"agent\" explores indefinitely and adds to their collection but postpones making the decision to do something with it. Wikipedia gives a list of practical applications of the multi-armed bandit problem, but I can't resist pointing out that the problem of deciding which professor's class to take is almost never counted among such lists, perhaps because professors compile them. Someone choosing among Zettelkasten implementations without really settling on one is another.\nGiven that the multi-armed bandit problem has a name, has been extensively studied since at least the middle of the twentieth century and has been solved in important cases, one question is whether some of these solutions could guide the Collector toward more productive uses of their time.",

The only difficulty has been with diagrams etc.  I've found that working mainly physically and scanning the images and cleaning the text digitally has been a nice process without much overhead.\nProofs and particularly the elements of subproofs are natural since linking can double as both relation and implication; likewise examination of backlinks can be useful for examining assumptions / presuppositions.\nIn summary, its working reasonably well, I just need to work physically first, then transfer to digital.\nAny shared experiences re mathematics research in your zettelkasten would be great.\nFor anyone with a combinatorial or number-theoretic bent, here is a newly discovered sequence of numbers generated by the main algorithm of my paper at the encyclopedia of integer sequences. https://oeis.org/A335725",

          "description": "Following @sfast 's advice on object tags, I've increasingly transitioned to using zettels as claims which connect two or more tag objects, and away from using zettels to refer to objects themselves. For instance, a zettel might express the following:\n\n  \n. #HumanBehavior is driven by #MentalModels, which are enacted through #EmbodiedCognition\n\n\nHere, I'm using tags for objects, while the zettel itself embodies a specific claim. This practice has led to a proliferation of tags in my note system.\nHowever, I don't really like multi-word tags. And tagging seems like a distraction from a key human-focused aspect of intellectual work: naming things. \"Embodied Cognition\", for example, is a term that has a specific meaning in a particular field; #EmbodiedCognition does not.\nRather than create a t…",

E.g.: Let's say I have an overview Zettel on Maria Popova's note-taking method. From this Zettel, I may link to a Zettel explaining how she uses sticky tab notes. But, the latter Zettel might not link to the former.\nAnother thing to note is that the item in the bottom of the image may link to further details. This might happen when you break down a Zettel that violates the Principle of Atomicity. E.g.:\nTopic-based overview: \"Maria Popova's note-taking system.\"\nIdea relevant to the overview: \"Idea index definition.\"\nA detail of the idea: \"Reading is about identifying patterns.\"\nA detail of the detail: \"Pattern definition.\"\nI based my diagram on what's been discussed in the Zettelkasten blog, so others' Zettelkasten might look different.\nQuestions for the reader:\nWhat would you change of my diagram?\nHow does your Zettelkasten look like?",

I love reading - the only thing that keeps me from continuing to read is mental fatigue, lack of sleep. To me reading is a way of escape.\nWhen I acquire new knowledge, I find myself a little more free from all the mental stuff. Sometimes I find myself doing things in slow motion because my brain is reserving energy for processing information.\nHowever I'm not so happy with the amount of info I retain so I have been looking for a way to take better notes and Zettelkasten sounds like what I need! I have been reading about it yesterday evening but I'm still not able to fully grasp this method (I find myself in slow motion again).\nBut anyways, nice to meet you, everyone!",

So far, it hasn't caused any (major) problems.\nIf I write a \"good\" zettle diligently and feel too lazy to rewrite the full note in digital form, particularly a note with lots of diagrams (mathematics, etc) I'll resort to the following...\nWorkflow: Physical to Digital\nScan the zettle making sure its readable\nCreate a zettle with the same id and title in digital form\nInsert the scan as a large image\nWrite the header in digital form (using a physical-scan-template) this is quick\nWrite any links in digital form\nWrite a one-sentence summary in digital form.\nLiberally use NON-hashed tags for keywords in the scanned text for easy searching.\nKeep the physical copy and add to physical slipbox\nAt some point, if I get around to it, I will slowly convert notes that have been post-semi-digitized per the above into purely digital form.\nI find the above most helpful when doing mathematics: the diagrams of category theory can take lots of time to write in latex. So if you have a particularly well-formed note with lots of notation, then I've found this method can work out fine in the short-term.  The most important items -- by trial and error -- from above are 5 6 and 7 so as to preserve the ability to search, link, and see a short summary.\nWorkflow: Digital to Physical (perhaps this is a bit obsessive)\nAt the end of each day collect the digitally created zettels from that day (easy with timestamp ID)\nPrint them out 2-per page and cut in half\nAdd to physical slipbox\nAlways maintain a printed copy of any index or structure notes.\nNow you have a synchronized digital and physical slipbox.
