          "description": "See: https://github.com/haskell-perf/sequences.\n With chrisdone we just added DList & Acc & snoc benchmarks into comparison.\n I think it is useful for everyone to see \"if old folk DList recommendation to solve [] problems actually holds water\".\n Because there is a direct comparison with numbers now.\n To be sure I additionally checked with spl (DList author) in: https://github.com/spl/dlist/issues/102 & chrisdone of course holds the benchmarking repository.\n  \nWhere is no benchmarks for data types - it implies the library/data type authors consider operation counterproductive to structure & so those operations made not idiomatic (like for simple snocing the [] one needs to list <> [el] - [] does not provide snocing operation for reason of it being counterproductive) - it means the operation to be composite/requires conversion into other data type & so not showable in the benchmark\n  \nWould note that DList is not designed for strictness.\n DList data design relies on the leverage of Haskell laziness & function composition, please use DList as it is by default.\n  \nAn update:\n Acc claim still checks-out under conditions for purpose of the data type. For example - DList is created to be consumed partially & in a lazy fashion, while Acc is created to be a builder type that goes into full normalization to be converted into a storage type (like Vector or Seq). So every type has its own domain of application & haskell-perf/sequences currently has not enough benchmarks to show all particularities of types under different conditions of use.\n As I opened: 1. Please, make a traverse test: https://github.com/haskell-perf/sequences/issues/24 2. Please, add to/fromList conversion tests: https://github.com/haskell-perf/sequences/issues/26 3.

However, I find myself in a situation where I am relying on a third-party function that has no linear type. Is there some escape hatch that lets me take my argument in a a %1 -> b and give it to a function a -> b?\n I tried to google this and found some references that said there were no such hatch, but they were quite old so perhaps things changed since then. If I can not do this I am afraid I won't be able to use LT for a while.

          "description": "Hi, we were trying to figure out an ideal way to represent Semver. There are a few ways we've tried representing semver however each has its drawbacks. Here are the 3 possible implementations we've considered each of them have drawbacks:\n  \nSimple data type data Version Natural Natural Natural\n \nSum type data Version = Major0Minor1Patch0 | Major0Minor2Patch0 | Major1Minor0Patch0 | Major1Minor1Patch0\n \nUse a sum type on each major minor patch version. This is the approach we are currently taking: ```haskell data Patch = Patch0 deriving (Eq, Show, Generic, Enum, Bounded)\n \n data Minor = Minor0 | Minor1 deriving (Eq, Show, Generic, Enum, Bounded)\n data Major = Major0 deriving (Eq, Show, Generic, Enum, Bounded)\n data Version = Version { major :: Major , minor :: Minor , patch :: Patch } deriving (Generic, Eq, Show) ```\n Requirements:\n Serialization/deserialization via aeson\n Complicated pattern matching\n This is important with event sourcing as some consumers may not care about minor version changes only major version changes.\n If we have a new major version and we don't handle it then we want to fail to compile.\n 1: Wouldn't give us strong compile-time guarantees. I don't know all actual versions we have.\n 2: Forces us to handle all versions even if the consumer does not care. I don't have a way to say I only care about Major versions.\n 3: Lets us handle only major version changes, and we know all possible major versions. However, we are representing a product and can introduce versions that don't really exist. e.g. if we have 0.1.0, 1.0.0, 1.1.0 then if we create a 1.2.0 we are now also representing 0.2.0.\n I'm curious if anyone has an alternative representation that might be better.

So we imagine our List above a sort of disjoint union of Nil and Cons a (List a). Correct? What gets confusing is from a Wikipedia article on Algebraic data types :\n  \nIn set theory the equivalent of a sum type is a disjoint union, a set whose elements are pairs consisting of a tag (equivalent to a constructor) and an object of a type corresponding to the tag (equivalent to the constructor arguments).\n  \nThe disjoint union article was fairly understandable, but I'm not making the connection between my List above and this quote above about tags and constructors and constructor arguments.

To make this extensible I'd like some freer monads, more extensible effects style interface, composing the command enum like Either Op1 Op2.\n But my usecase could be seen as a mildly wonky Op-Based CRDT which means the operations commute and order doesn't matter. It would be really nice if internally I could store everything as (MVector Op1, MVector Op2)behind the scenes.\n This lead me to a number of questions:\n  \nIs there an array-of-sums representation that stores Vector (Either Op1 Op2) as (Vector Op1, Vector Op2)?\n Is there a better way to derive unboxed vector boilerplate? I have seen https://hackage.haskell.org/package/vector-th-unbox-0.2.2/docs/Data-Vector-Unboxed-Deriving.html before but it feels like DerivingVia should be able to handle it if the monad was constrained to be representational\n Are there interface ideas to manipulate unboxed vectors structurally? Say, lift projection functions like Vector (a,b) -> Vector a? In my case also things like pop one Op1 value, or take all Op2 values\n Is there an approach to structurally manipulate types in Haskell? Most code in Haskell only folds over the generic representation but e.g. StrictCheck has some tooling to add a functor at each level of a type, typescript has a bunch of tools for this like\n  \n \ntype ExtractPII<Type> = { [Property in keyof Type]: Type[Property] extends { pii: true } ? true : false; }; \n If people have ideas to any of these points I'd really like to hear about them!\n    submitted by    /u/Tarmen  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have designed a C pseudo code for the extraction function, and this what I have written so far for the extraction function in Haskell-\n In C :\n extractBits (unsigned int x, int t, int n) mask = ((1<<n)-1)<<t; unsigned int extractedBits = x & mask;\n In Haskell :\n extractBits :: Word 128 -> Integer -> Integer -> Word128 extractBits x t n = x .&.

(shiftL 1 n-1)) t\n Not quite sure however I think the function above does not seem to be logically the same as my implementation? They are giving different results for some values.

The structure would be something similar to this:\n haskell data NestedMap = M.Map Key1 (M.Map Key2 (M.Map Key3 [Item])) \n You can assume Key* and Item are simple Strings.\n I wanted to try using Lens to do it, but I'm having trouble understanding some concepts. For example, I have seen that to manipulate map-like structures in this way at should be used, as well as non to provide the keys when missing and continue operating. However, when looking at the docs for non I have found this:\n  &gt;&gt;&gt; Map.fromList [(\"hello\", 1)] &amp; at \"hello\" . non 0 +~ 2 fromList [(\"hello\",3)] &gt;&gt;&gt; Map.fromList [(\"hello\", 1)] &amp; at \"hello\" . non 0 -~ 1 fromList [] \n I don't understand the second result at all. Shouldn't the result be something like fromList [(\"hello\", 0)]? Why it's not the case?\n To be honest I'm also having trouble trying to think on how could I chain all the ^.s, ats, nons and ?~s into an expression to finally add a [Item] at the bottom of the nested map, but as I'm not understanding the non function I'll need to go step by step.\n Could someone please help me understand this better?

Additionally, the target directory of the code generated by Copilot can now be customized. Release 3.6 also includes a battery of unit tests for the library copilot-core. This release introduces other fixes in the code and in the documentation, and deprecates definitions that have been superseded or that were largely unused.\n Current emphasis is on facilitating the use with other systems, and improving the codebase in terms of stability and test coverage.

But specifically written for Monads (e.g. liftM and fmap; ap and <*>).\n  \nWhich ones are you using?\n Is there a rule of thumb?\n Perhaps something like \"always liftM when the value is an instance of Monad and only fmap when it is an instance of Applicative and not of Monad?\"\n  \n​\n 2) There is a small task to do this tightrope walker example (http://learnyouahaskell.com/a-fistful-of-monads) with the Either type instead of the Maybe type.Thats what I did here and wondered if I could use the state Monad in combination with the Either Monad to clean up the code by avoiding all these ```first <- landLeft start second <- landLeft first etc..```\n  \nIs this possible?

I have been considering writing several applications in haskell that are somewhat performance dependent and as previously mentioned, I would rather have them be written in haskell than not if the performance is not strongly affected by this.\n Does haskell have good graphics libraries?

That is to say, I'm generally in the dark about Haskell package install. I did a stack ghci --package diagrams which seemed finally to install diagrams (after nine stack.yaml extra-deps additions) and start up a REPL (8.10.4). IAC, I could get the basic starter code DiagramsTutorial.lhs to load from the ghci prompt -- after doing :set -package diagrams-lib and :set -package diagrams-svg as it errored on Could not load module ‘Diagrams.Prelude’ etc. All right, then I tried as the tutorial says, i.e., $ ghc --make DiagramsTutorial.lhs This, however, errored out just like the ghci load with \n diag1.hs:5:1: error: Could not load module ‘Diagrams.Prelude’ It is a member of the hidden package ‘diagrams-lib-1.4.3’. You can run ‘:set -package diagrams-lib’ to expose it. (Note: this unloads all the modules in the current scope.) Use -v (or `:set -v` in ghci) to see a list of the files searched for. \n and same for import Diagrams.Backend.SVG.CmdLine I'm confused over the whole stack versus cabal thing in general. BTW, what's the most popular IDE for Haskell? I've been using Emacs, trying to use the org-mode babel depending on a REPL session, which is iffy at best. Also, a $ ghc --version says 8.8.4.

          "description": "For the last two-three days, I have been trying to wrap my head around functional reactive programming. I came across threepenny-gui while I have been trying to understand the concept.\n My understanding is that the difference between reactive programming as opposed to event-driven programming is that in reactive programming, one describes the behavior of the UI as a time varying function rather than how it behaves when certain events are triggerred. For example, Spreadsheet allow for reactive programming since we can say that a certain cell is related to some other cell in terms of a certain formula -- instead of having to say [When those cells update, change this cell according to this formula]. \n When I look at the different examples included with threepenny-gui, I get the impression that they have not designed their programs reactively. For instance, if you see Mouse.hs, you see that they are saying\n  on UI.mousemove wrap $ \\xy -> element out # set text (\"Coordinates: \" ++ show xy) on UI.keydown wrap $ \\c -> element out # set text (\"Keycode: \" ++ show c) \n which binds the \\c -> element out # set text ... handler to the events. This looks like event driven programming to me, instead of reactive programming. In a reactive program, one would just say that certain fields are bound to the coordinates of the mouse.\n I have also looked at Reactive.Threepenny and I think I understand the combinators but I do not understand how to use them to actually write reactive code.\n Is my understanding correct?\n If you have suggestions on how to phrase my code as reactively as possible in threpenny-gui, that would be welcome. If this is not the correct library for this sort of programming, what would be a good way to exemplify these ideas?\n    submitted by    /u/agnishom  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "We are trying to get a working Haskell dev environment on MacOS M1, and are having various problems with the different approaches we have taken.\n Our project currently uses an older nixpkgs that comes with ghc[js]-8.6.5, but this unsurprisingly does not work and is likely a wontfix.\n The obvious choice was upgrading nixpkgs to a new version. However it seems like entering a nix-shell with ghc does not work, even for a very simple project. It complains about a broken compiler-rt-libc, and allowing for broken packages leads to a failing build of compiler-rt-libc.\n Surprisingly nix-build does work for ghc, however our project is too large for nix-build to be practical for development, as build times are on the order of an hour.\n Another problem with newer nixpkgs is that ghcjs doesn't work at all, again even on simple projects. It errors out with a complaint about the happy test suite failing.\n Yet one more problem is that while newer ghcjs on non-M1 MacOS does work, it is massively slower, taking on the order of a day to build our project, occasionally requiring restarts due to running out of file handles.\n There are also problems with running newer ghcjs versions on Ubuntu, as our project deterministically fails with an Data.Binary.Get.runGet at position 0: not enough bytes error.\n Due to the above we have been instead focusing on getting ghc-8.6.5 working on MacOS M1 without nix via Rosetta.\n However this has been very difficult due to C dependencies. We have uninstalled and reinstalled the necessary brew libraries in x86 arch mode, but cabal does not seem to be able to find them either way.\n So what I was more or less wondering was what other people have gotten working on MacOS M1, in case there is anything we can learn from that to get our project building on it.\n    submitted by    /u/Tysonzero  \n [link]   [comments]",

Jordan provides abstract and inspectable JSON parsing and serialization, using the Applicative (for parsing) and Divisible (for serializing) typeclasses.\n Jordan has you define ToJSON and FromJSON classes in terms of instructions, such as \"serialize a string\" or \"parse an object with these fields\". These instructions are then evaluated by various interpreters, which actually do the work of parsing or serializing. This has a few benefits:\n  \nIntermediate structures are entirely avoided: there is no Map.Map Text JSONValue anywhere in the library, and JSON fields are directly parsed using permutation parsers. This also means that we can always serialize a JSON directly to a bytestring, avoiding the need for anything like toEncoding from Aeson\n Since JSON interaction is kept abstract, you can generate documentation for parsers and serializers, directly from their definitions. This is provided in jordan-openapi.\n This library provides a fun excuse to use contravariant functors, so you can feel like a super small functional programmer\n  \nThe github page for this project is located here. While I'm not gunning to replace Aeson or anything, I would really appreciate any feedback anybody has to offer!\n    submitted by    /u/THeShinyHObbiest  \n [link]   [comments]",

Scala is declining in usage because Java is becoming better and Kotlin is getting pushed hard and is a smaller step for many Java developers. Personally I really love the Scala language over all the other languages I have tried. I have been following on Twitter and on Reddit and the only thing I feel is that I want to stay as far away from that mess as possible. I sugest the leaders in the comunity to travel somewhere and get a professional mediator and resolve all issues. You don't have to be friends after that but at least stop making Scala look more like daytime soap opera than an excellent comunity with smart people. You all want this to succeed. Perhaps it is more complicated and I'm being naive but from a bystanders perspective it looks pretty bad.\n The reason why I went to all the Scala conferences was because of all the smart people and the technology. Please bring back that focus and become that comunity again.\n As said before I don't have the details. I'm just describing how it looks from my perspective and others might feel different or that it's to complex to resolve these issues.\n    submitted by    /u/0OOO00000OO00O0O0OOO  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I have been working with Scala (Functional) and Clojure for the last ~ 4 years but I still can't give a proper brief answer whenever someone asks me \"Hey, what is FP and why should I use it?\" \n I generally start with concepts like immutability, local reasoning, referential transparency, functions as first class citizens, currying etc. But I soon find myself going all over the place. For example, I find myself giving unconvincing arguments when someone asks me \"what practical benefit does referential transparency actually provide to the developer?\"\n There are arguments like imperative programming depends on the order of execution of statements, while FP is declarative. But FP also depends on the order of execution (you insert into database and then read, you can't do vice-versa). Sure, you can say that \"ordering\" that we are talking about here is in the context of mutating global state. There isn't any global state in FP. But at the core of it ordering does matter right?\n Then there is the argument that immutability allows use of different cores in parallel. But I have never seen this happening in any business application, i.e, immutability used to parallelize processing. Sure, making a value immutable makes it thread safe (since no one can change it). But most real life scenarios require mutability. So we model them as Atomic, Ref etc and make them thread safe. But these things exist in imperative languages as well. So, what exactly is the connection between immutability and parallel processing & thread safety.?\n Then we have the lazy evaluation of IO which provides referential transparency. I have used IO and I love it. But I can't seem to find practical/objective points as to what benefits it provides. So when I say that all my DB operations and external API calls are an IO, I again find myself giving unconvincing answers about their benefits.\n    submitted by    /u/reflections_deams  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm designing SLinC to use cats' `Free` monad for a native effect type called NativeIO, and it's powered by Scala 3's macros and Java 17's foreign incubator.\n An example usage of SLinC is binding to stdlib.h's div method:\n C representation\n struct div_t { int quot; int rem; }; div_t div(int numerator, int denominator); \n Scala 3 binding and usage\n //scala representation of div_t struct type div_t = Struct { val quot: int val rem: int } //method binding for c stdlib's div val div = NativeIO[(Int, Int) => div_t](\"div\") //usage of our binding //Struct returns require native memory allocation, so an allocation scope is needed Native.scope( for result <- div(5,2) quot = result.quot.get rem = result.rem.get yield println(s\"quotient: $quot, remainder: $rem\") ) //natively allocated data is freed after this point .foldMap(NativeIO.impureCompiler) //compiles and runs the native kernel we just defined, prints \"quotient: 2, remainder: 1\" \n The library is still in development, so it's not as fully featured as JNA or JNR, but I'm hoping to improve it in the coming month. It's also very promising performance-wise: despite me not putting much of any effort into optimization, it's already rivaling JNR in performance, and resoundingly beats JNA.\n    submitted by    /u/markehammons  \n [link]   [comments]",

Alternatively, what's the best approach in tackling this problem with Scala?\n ​\n Disclaimer: I don't have a CS or IT background and have very little experience with pure Scala, I mostly use Spark and Python daily, but I wanted to start filling my skills gaps within the data engineering realm for a long-term goal. I think I know the difference between SAX and DOM parsing, so I was looking for something to implement the former (amirite? :D)\n ​\n Disclaimer 2: this question stems from an interview assignment that required something like this plus other features (streaming solution, JSON output), but after spending too much time just on learning the different parsing approaches I told them I wouldn't proceed: even though it's something easy for the average programmer, it clearly shows my huge gaps in knowledge and programming skills. But I still want to work on it in my own time.\n ​\n Thanks a lot in advance and sorry if it's a silly question. Cheers!\n    submitted by    /u/cyberZamp  \n [link]   [comments]",

I learned following the Coursera course from the wonderful Martin Odersky, but I quickly realised that my company was still in the middle of its transition from Java to Scala, with most of our code base looking more like scalaified Java than pure FP Scala like I learned at the beginning.\n I like functional programming, I've liked it from the first moment I learned common Lisp even thou the language felt antiquated, and, well, I wouldn't say I cried, but I was somewhat moved by the....purety ? Mathematicality ? of scala ( don't judge, IK my sense of esthetic is somewhat weird ). \n Things seem to be somewhat moving in this direction at work, and I wanted to accompany this, and satisfy my own curiosity, by learning the move fp-extremist stuff I could find in Scala. \n I could easily find resources on cats and the rest of the typelevel ecosystem, but then I discovered ZIO and that became my latest obsession. I like the project, I like how ZIO code looks and what the whole obsessive typing of everything thingy brings to me as a Dev.\n And then I tried to learn Zio 2.0 ( because why start with the old one when the next one is almost there ? ) but I have a hard time finding learning resources.\n Which bring me to my question ( thanks for reading my life story if you did ) : is the Zionomicon, and Zio in general, worth the time and money I would invest ?\n \n TLDR : weirdo ranting on his new fp zealotry wants to know if paying 50+ bucks for the Zionomicon is worth it\n    submitted by    /u/WiIzaaa  \n [link]   [comments]",

Another potential plus is that my company product is written in Java. I don't implement any code, but I do handle its technical implementation and design augmentations for customers. I may find an opportunity to leverage Scala in the JVM for some side projects to help me practice. \n At any rate, my motivation for learning Scala is that it seems well-aligned with my goals and circumstances for entering a more programmatic world.\n  \nBooks\n After looking around, I've picked out 3 books:\n  \nProgramming in Scala Fifth Edition\n \nHands-on Scala Programming: Learn Scala in a Practical, Project-Based Way \n \nProgramming Scala: Scalability = Functional Programming + Objects\n \n I saw a lot of good things about Programming in Scala Fourth Edition, and being that it's written by Martin Odersky, it seems like a solid choice.

But at the end of the day our code needs to run on actual\nmachines, and when our code is run it needs to be performant.

Even we use some plugin like org-edna/org-depend to express a dependant task of a headline h1 who isn't a descendant of h1, all functions on subtask can run only for descendant of a headline.\n For instance, what will happen if 2 projects p1 and p2 depend a same task t1. t1 is a descendant of p1. And we want know the progress of p2, the progress of t1 won't be integrated to calculation of progress of p2.\n To solve this problem, org mode should integrate the notion of symbolic link headline, like in tree based file system, we have file and symlink into a file. I don't think org mode will evolve into this direction, because it is designed to write documents. A document don't need this feature.\n What do you think about this limit of org mode to become the ideal task management?

          "description": "Hi there. I am a new Emacs user, trying it after using Vim for a year or so.I'd say it's ambitious, but I've started from scratch. I didn't want to go with Spacemacs or Doom Emacs. \n Configuring init.el file got me thinking - What are all those functions? I know that ELisp is a dialect of a programming language called LISP, but knowing many languages ELisp seems so strange. It's absolutely peculiar. \n You all know that Python has been considered a \"pseudo code\" language in which you almost tell in human English what do you want to achieve.I actually believe that ELisp falls under that description much better. \n I don't understand what all those functions are doing below the surface. It seems to me that if I'd want to make a AI Chess game by my own rules, that the only thing I'd need to write in ELisp, would be: \n  \n(setq AI-chess-my-own-rules t) \n  \nAnd that would be it.\n Can I see the implementation of each function I have put in my init.el?How does, for example: \n  \n(load theme 'doom-gruvbox) \n  \nwork? \n Can I see the implementation? Or (scroll-bar-mode -1)? How does that work? Does that tells the X to stop drawing the scroll-bar in Emacs? What is the language that those functions are written in, and where could I see, inside or outside of Emacs, the implementation of it? \n And how is it possible that I can type a name of any function written in ELisp and it will just work? Aren't there any libraries? How does that work? \n I believe these are trivial questions for you, but I am really new in this. I fell in love with the Org mode, but Emacs seems so strange. I got used to parenthesis, I get it - That's the syntax. Fine. I don't have a problem with it. But it's absolutely different than any other language I've ever used. \n Thanks in advance for replies. :)\n    submitted by    /u/aqua_cap  \n [link]   [comments]",

However after it appears to be done, the Emacs frame is just...stuck. It's a blank frame. No *scratch* buffer, just a blank GTK frame. I'm running Emacs with emacs --debug-init for now, and calling kill -USR2 [the emacs pid] will bring it back. Sort of. The GTK frame is still blank, but if I press a key, the scratch buffer appears. Granted, it just freezes up again. My best guess is that it's related to garbage collection, but I wouldn't be sure how to tell.\n Native compilation\n So while I was using Doom Emacs, native compilation did make Emacs perform a bit better. However having moved away from Doom, I don't have the benefit of the compilation process being printed out anywhere when packages are update. Doom has a bunch of functions to have a CLI program, but all I really want is to be able to see if and when there's a problem in the native compilation process. I'm wondering if there's a simple way to go about this.\n Thanks, and have a Happy Thanksgiving to my fellow Americans!\n    submitted by    /u/alecStewart1  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "First off, I want to thank this community for all the help I have gotten both through explicitly asking questions and just through watching others questoins. \n ​\n Main point: \n I recently switched to EXWM because its awesome. I found some rough edges that I have been trying to smooth out and wanted to share a particularly simple one. \n The EXWM wiki suggets merging framemove with windmove to move between workspaces on two different monitors. I found that framemove considers not just visible workspaces but also inactive (invisible) workspaces. Imagine the following setup\n Monitor 1: assigned workspaces 0 and 1; currently showing workspace 1\n Monitor 2: assigned workspaces 2; currently showing monitor 2. Focus is on workspace 2. \n Trying to move across frames using framemove could actually cause focus to not just switch to monitor 1 but also monitor 1 to change from showing workspace 1 to workspace 0. \n Turns out it was pretty simple to modify framemove to restrict to only considering currently active frames using the predicate function `exwm-workspace--active-p`. \n ​\n In case anyone else runs into this issue take a look at my forked version of framemove: https://github.com/jsilve24/framemove. \n ​\n Honestly, it seems rediculous that I forked this repo since my contribution is essentially nil. That said, I really wasn't sure a better way since the original library is on the emacswiki and also maintained by the emacsmirror github user. \n ​\n That said, hope this helps someone else.\n ​\n Cheers.\n    submitted by    /u/JustinSilverman  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I am annoyed that when I C-g out of my expand-region session my cursor does not return to its original location.\n In trying to resolve this annoyance I found that expand-region comes with a variable er/save-mode-excursion that is described as:\n  \nA function to save excursion state while expanding\n  \nI set this variable to (lambda (&rest body) () (save-excursion body)) and I found that this does not suit my needs for the following reasons.\n  \nThis variable does not seem to effect any er/ commands outside of er/expand-region. For example if I do er/mark-defun and then hit C-g my cursor position is not returned.\n I often use a key-chord bound to (lambda () (interactive) (execute-kbd-macro (read-kbd-macro \"\\C-g\"))). When I use this key-chord instead of actually hitting C-g my cursor position is not returned. I do not understand why this is.\n  \nNext I tried taking advantage of the deactivate-mark-hook to programatically hit C-u C-SPC.\n (add-hook 'deactivate-mark-hook #'(lambda () (let ((current-prefix-arg 4)) (call-interactively 'set-mark-command)))) \n This works great for my non expand-region region endeavours but when I try to use any er/ commands I get unpredictable behavior. I believe the problem is that expand-region resets the mark multiple times and therefore deactivate-mark-hook is called multiple times.\n My next idea is to make my own expand-region-minor-mode where I can probably solve this problem. Before I do this though I want to know if there are already existing solutions.\n    submitted by    /u/thirtySeven73  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "On Emacs 27.2 with emacs -q, calling calc-edit (bound to the ` key by default) with an element on the calc stack will bring up the *Calc Edit* buffer in place of the original calc buffer. When you're done editing the element, you can do C-c C-c to dismiss the *Calc Edit* buffer and the original calc buffer will now have your edited element on the stack.\n However, on a version of Emacs I built off the emacs-28 branch about a week ago, also with emacs -q, calling calc-edit will instead bring up the *Calc Edit* buffer in a separate window, while the original calc buffer is still visible. Then, after editing the element and doing C-c C-c, the window layout becomes messed up: the original calc buffer remains at the bottom, but now there's another calc buffer and *Calc Trail* buffer in the place of where the *Calc Edit* buffer was. I attached an image to show what this layout looks like.\n Since this happens with emacs -q, it seems like it could be a bug, but searching around online doesn't show anyone else bringing it up, so maybe it's either a recent bug, or could it just be me? Can anyone confirm this behavior?\n This is all on macOS, by the way.\n ​\n https://preview.redd.it/pm14mfu5bv081.png?width=2606&format=png&auto=webp&s=f22d20d275a62dce7bc268a58acb98fd2deec086\n    submitted by    /u/Comfortable-Bit3236  \n [link]   [comments]",

However, this approach starts to break down in more complicated scenarios, such as:\n (local-leader-def :keymaps 'org-mode-map \"a\" '(:ignore t :wk \"attachments\") \"a a\" 'org-attach \"a d\" '(:ignore t :wk \"deletion\") \"a d d\" 'org-attach-delete-one \"a d G\" 'org-attach-delete-all \"r\" '(:ignore t :wk \"refile\") \"r r\" 'org-refile) \n First, this is kind of ugly - Org has a ton of features, and I try to use a lot of them, so some of my key sequences can get pretty long. I end up retyping the same prefix many, many times, sometimes with multiple layers of the (:ignore t :wk \"foo\") trick (as seen above).\n Second, (and more annoyingly, IMO) doing it this way \"shadows\" the which-key description for modes which share a prefix. That is, if I'm in ledger mode and type \"SPC m\", it yields the suggestion \"r -> refile\" instead of \"r -> ledger-report\" as it should.\n I've been futzing around with general's \":prefix-command\" and related facilities to try and figure out a way of avoiding this second issue, but so far I haven't been able to get anything to work. Since my current strategy is ad hoc and not based on any best practices I'm aware of, I thought I'd ask here if there's a canonical/idiomatic way of using general's capabilities to define groups of similarly-prefixed commands without breaking which-key.\n (Also, why is there a distinction between :prefix-command and :prefix-map?

In my projects I make heavy use of Telescope within neovim and one of the major reasons that I love it is the ability to preview grep results from files in my project directory within a separate window. I like being able to get more context from the search without actually opening up a new buffer. I've set up Ivy and Counsel and was trying to get the same functionality working, but I'm having a heck of a time with previewing. The closest I've come is realizing that after using counsel-projectile-rg that I can use ivy-next-line-and-call functionality to move the current buffer through the search results with C-M n or C-M p, however, that actually opens the buffer and populates my buffer list. Does anyone know if there's some sort of functionality to open a new preview window and navigate through those search results in it by default with C-j (I'm using evil mode). Essentially I'd always like this type of preview whenever I'm doing searches. Also, I'm not attached to any particular completion or search framework, so if this is easier in something like Helm then I'd be open to solutions from that as well. I attached a gif of what I'm talking about working in Telescope\n https://i.redd.it/cp4ls2931m081.gif\n    submitted by    /u/Brojak  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I'm currently using General for leader-key bindings, and I have various categories of keybindings under different prefix keys like \"f\" for files, \"b\" for buffers, etc. I use SPC as my leader key, so to access my file related commands I would press \"SPC f\", where I would be presented with a list (via which-key) of my file related keybindings.\n Ok I'm sure many of you are with me so far. Here is my question: I'd like to create keybindings for language-specific commands, but I don't want to create a separate prefix key for each language. What's the best way to manage that?\n One idea I've thought of is to use \"l\" (for \"language\") as a prefix key for whatever language mode I'm in. So if I'm programming in Scheme, and I press \"SPC l\" it would bring up my scheme keybindings. But if I was in javascript, and I press \"SPC l\" it would bring up my javascript bindings.\n However I'm not sure how to implement that. I'm a bit of a emacs noob to be honest.\n Is there some other recommended way to deal with this? I'm open to other ways of organizing.\n Another idea I thought of is to create another level of prefix keys under \"l\" where each key would bring up the keybindings for a given language. So maybe \"SPC l j\" would bring up the javascript menu, and \"SPC l s\" would bring up the scheme menu. This is something I probably could do without too much trouble, but I prefer the first approach.\n Any help appreciated, thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/chillpenguin99  \n [link]   [comments]",

Specifically, I wanted to share my notes on a subject with a friend and I realized how annoying it is to select every note that points to an index and copy it to a folder which I can share with someone. The easiest solution I could find was to open the org-roam-dedicated-buffer of the index and slowly mark every file there in dired and finally copy them to a location. But that is really slow to do.\n So, since this is emacs, I decided that if a feature doesn't exist, you just create it yourself. Today I found the time to work on this and got a working result.

I'll start to tinker with it soon-ish, but my elisp knowledge isn't the greatest, so I thought I'd ask here if anybody has ideas where to start. In particular, I have the hunch that child frames can be used to address the lack of snappiness, the empty lines issue and the lack of org-mode integration, but I haven't used them much myself, so perhaps someone with more experience has thoughts about their appropriateness. Also if there are other ideas how to improve editing text tables I'd love to hear them.\n Cheers!\n    submitted by    /u/swhalemwo  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi folks,\n Yesterday, I finished up putting my first custom keyboard together. It comes with a lot of extra keys, a couple of which are bound to 'Hyper' by default. 'Hyper' is a 'modifier' provided by QMK (the firmware that powers this board) that maps to pressing 'Control-Alt-Super-Shift' all together. Because there are no default mappings in the Hyper space, it seems like a good place to put some global Emacs shortcut keys that will absolutely-for-sure not ever get clobbered.\n While it would be easier to bind C-M-s-<foo> instead of H-<foo> and get more or less the same effect, I would like to be able to utilize C-x @ h (event-apply-hyper-modifier) as an option to 'gracefully degrade' on computers where I don't have my keyboard (for example: the Chromebook I occasionally play with Emacs on). That way those global binds can stay available and reasonably within reach. It doesn't seem possible to chain C-x @ mod application functions together, but even if it were possible, chaining 4 of them together would get really old really quickly.\n I would prefer for this to get handled by Emacs instead of getting handled by the OS, just for that extra level of 'don't need to account for some random specific machine configuration', but I'm open to suggestions on what to do there if no good options exist on the Emacs level. My main machine (the one the keyboard lives at) runs mostly Fedora Workstation, and sometimes Windows 10 Pro (though I almost never use Emacs in Windows).\n Thanks, all.\n    submitted by    /u/SoraFirestorm  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "[SOLVED] Thank you all!\n I am attempting to create a custom theme using ThemeCreator, but this problem also appears for other custom themes that aren't installed in bare Emacs, but come from the color-theme-modern package.\n For these themes, and the one I created and installed from a local file, the colors appear to be broken in my terminal (bash via GNOME terminal on Manjaro + GNOME). Using TERM=\"xterm-256color\" changes nothing, and in fact using TERM=\"xterm\" is slightly better (in the sense that it's closer to the original theme).\n I suspect something fishy is happening though, as the real issues set in after I agree to run the Lisp from these themes. For example, let's say I'm running wombat theme but want to switch to taylor. Everything looks fine (or what I consider fine) in wombat, I navigate up to taylor and hit enter, the colors change to something that looks nice but probably isn't Taylor (maybe some previous selection that isn't wombat), but then as soon as I allow the Lisp from Taylor to run, I get an absolutely horrible scheme that is almost unreadable.\n All appears well in GUI Emacs, but I am not interested in using that unfortunately.\n I have also tried other, more esoteric settings for the TERM variable, but to no avail.

It should be easy to make the background circular or squircular for those of you that prefer so.\n - I further smoothed the curves by removing extra degrees of freedom.\n - The logo shadow is now blurry and less opaque.\n - There is a subtle radial gradient that spotlights the logo and turns darker near the edges.\n - The upper and lower halves of the logo are slightly more proportionate.\n I've learned the basics of Inkspace and, against my expectations, I actually enjoyed using it :)\n I'm sharing a png image and its svg source (not permalinks, sorry, I promise to keep them online for some weeks at least).\n - png: https://drive.google.com/file/d/14BDnwlGa17ds0CZI1kNBNghqt4TSqVEl/view?usp=sharing\n - svg: https://drive.google.com/file/d/14L_roGCSD9dMnhL4Cq3w2_sfP4vvlk0_/view?usp=sharing\n Hope you like it.\n ​\n https://preview.redd.it/pqs4wh1n05z71.png?width=2048&format=png&auto=webp&s=d524e936fa57d86656b0e49444cf6b369da6e46c\n    submitted by    /u/nnenneplex  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello! I am a new user of emacs, and really exploring the configuration options around. But I just found some very annoying aspects that are driving me crazy.\n First:\n How on earth can I just use tabs in a sane way?\n In VSCode I found tabs pretty smart. Press the key once, and it dropped you on the correct indentation level for the line, press it more times and it inserted spaces to your liking. In emacs apparently the default behavior stops at the first part, but for example, in PHP I'm writing a SQL string and to avoid wraping I press enter, but then it goes to the beginning of the line and if I press tab it just won't work because it thinks it is still at the correct level of indentation. and to correct the string I have to press space for doing so. I have no idea how to search for this in google, and the few posts I found give no solution whatsoever, and some say \"just get used to it\".\n Second:\n Are modes always \"wonky\"? For example, I am writing PHP at the moment, and web mode is pretty deficient for it, inserting a \">\" character when I write \"<\" in a comparison because it thinks I'm writing an html tag. For that I installed PHP-mode, and now... formatting the file is impossible because it says that clang-formatter is not found. For web mode I installed Apheleia, and it works fine, but now I can't use it with PHP-mode. So how can I configure it so it works?\n And when I was just using web-mode, it suddenly, and apparently at random, just go back to fundamental mode. And had to enable web-mode manually several times. This is what made me install PHP-mode in the first place.\n I hope someone has an idea of how to fix this stuff, or at least point me in the right direction.

Ideally, I want the ability to export to a nice-looking format. Package tips, programming suggestions, everything welcome. Thanks :)\n I have a somewhat unconventional taste of music - at least when compared to my friends. I rarely play music I enjoy personally other than some beat tapes which are simply lit when hangin' out together.\n Now, I have been asked by one friend of mine to compile a list of music that I have enjoyed throughought the year. Since I actually enjoy sharing/discussing music, I agreed. So I compiled a list of songs - free form, no format etc. \n However, I've been wondering: I might be doing this every year from now on. First off, it was a bit tedious to do the freeform entry. Secondly, and more important, I don't want to manually search for duplicates when compiling my 2022 list. Finally, it would be nice if I could have this list (or a subset of such a list) exported either in a nice-looking pdf or in some other conventient form. \n Then, I thought to myself: well, since you can do practically everything with emacs, why shouldn't it be able to help me out this time?\n Thus, I'd love to hear your thoughts on the matter. It might be some kind of database thingy that is able (programmably) to detect duplicates. It might be a program that does EXACTLY what I want. It might be a hint on how to do autonumbering on an unformatted file. It might be a tip on how to automate the \"finding duplicates\" process. Anything, really :)\n Thanks a bunch, have a good day, fellows! :)\n    submitted by    /u/olivuser  \n [link]   [comments]",

I removed the icon. I then went into Applications and launched an instance of Emacs. It worked. I added it to the favorites in the dock. I closed the instance. I then went to click the icon again. It opened a weird Emacsclient instance, which didn't split the frame into three windows like it always does at startup (I have this written in .emacs).\n To summarize, whenever I launch from the applications, I can start a \"normal\" Emacs version. As soon as I add its icon to the dock, the icon begins launching Emacs(client) version.\n In the applications, I have three icons: Emacs, Emacs(client), Emacs(Terminal).\n Any help on figuring out what is going on is appreciated. For one, I would love to learn what this client thing is as I have never seen nor used it. It would also be great to get to the usual behavior of just getting good old Emacs after clicking the icon in the dock. If there is reason to this client madness and it can be beneficial in this case, I am all ears.\n    submitted by    /u/rawlimerick  \n [link]   [comments]",

I can start the node server but I cannot connect to it. I'm not sure it starts the node server correctly; in the documentation it says that you can start the node server manually and then connect to it, but the code says otherwise (it always asks if you want to close the previous connection, doing nothing if you chose `no`, starting a new server if you choose `yes`)\n Evaluating TypeScript code leads to errors, even though the documentation and the discussions that I've seen lead to the impression that evaluating TypeScript should be no different than evaluating JavaScript code.\n Async functions cannot be evaluated with `indium-eval-last-node` since it only evaluates the code after the `function` token, ignoring the `async` token, which leads to the error that `await` cannot be used in non-async functions.\n The Indium setup documentation references functions that are no longer available, like `M-x indium-connect-to-nodejs`\n the last commit is from March 2021 and there are still open issues from 2017 and no responses from the developer\n  \nDeveloping such a huge and nice package is surely overwhelming.

Then I killed emacs and run another instance and profiled it while editing same dockerfile but again I left with freezed Emacs. Again I tried same and found in profiler that evil (especially evil-ex command), timer.el(IDK what it is) and selectrum(precisely selectrum--update) using CPU. Then I removed evil packages from my init.el and replaced selectrum with vertico. Now, Emacs is usable.

          "description": "Are there good options for automatically adjusting text size for a frame based on the current display?\n I didn't find anything so I made a small package textsize that currently fits my needs quite well. It automatically chooses a font point size for the default face for the current frame, based on:\n  \nmonitor resolution: if it's lower res, typically want a smaller point size\n pixel pitch: higher point size on finer pitch screens\n manual per-frame adjustment available to shift the calculated value\n  \nFor me there is one current omission where automatic adjustment is fired via window-size-change-functions, which does not fire if the resolution is unchanged. e.g. Going from my 1080p laptop to a 1080p external. The only options I've seen for that require polling, which feels kind of distasteful. Anyone know of triggers I might catch for that?\n I could add rules around monitor size and/or frame size, though personally I haven't particularly wanted it. The manual adjustment is available for transient needs.\n I'd welcome comments both on the functionality, how I achieved it.\n  \nIs this reinventing another wheel I didn't find? This EmacsWiki page outlines some details but I didn't see automatic adjustment.\n \nI feel like my coding of 'thresholds' is clunky and a little obtuse - are the Elisp examples of something similar that's cleaner and clearer?\n \nMy default pixel pitch thresholds are guesses, as my day-to-day doesn't have a lot of variation on that.\n \n If you want to try it, load textsize.el and run (textsize-setup), and move things between disparate monitors (providing their resolution isn't the same!). Tweak the customizations and let me know if you think the defaults could be better or if you would want other rules.\n I can put it on MELPA if there's interest, but I feel like it could do with a bit more depth.\n    submitted by    /u/wjcferguson  \n [link]   [comments]",

For instance, this method in the worg tutorials is often suggested, but it seems to be for org-mode < v8.0.\n An alternative I've tried is to use #+SETUPFILE:~/my_template.org, which is a file that contains various #+LATEX_HEADER:\\usepackage{} lines.

I couldn't find another comprehensive resource for this.\n To make a start, here are some I'm aware of:\n  \nmagit-section: Create a ui like magit\n Taxy: Uses magit-section but in some cases makes it even more convenient and fast to put data into a buffer\n Tabulated List Mode: Not to forget the built-ins, tabulated list mode can also help setting up a buffer really fast if a tabulated list is all one needs\n Hierarchy: Put hierarchical data into a buffer with several convenience functions to display, query and action callbacks. Seems to be merged to emacs and even though the library is there, there is not documentation in the Elisp or Emacs manuals, so the git repo README is still useful for documentation.\n tree-widget.el: There seems to be a tree-widget.el in emacs core, seems this also can be used to build trees in buffers but I haven't used it and there seems to be no documentation in the Elisp or Emacs manuals about it so I don't really know how useful it is.\n  \n   submitted by    /u/editar  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "org-depend is nice, but it feels clunky to me - I use org-capture to add tasks to my to-do list whenever they occur to me, so I often end up with something like:\n * TODO Task 1 * WAIT Task 2 * WAIT Task 1.5 \n ...where I forgot there was a task that needed to be done between 1 and 2, and have to add it in later. In this situation, the \"chain-siblings\" trigger keyword to move tasks from \"WAIT\" to \"TODO\" doesn't really work out - plus, what about situations where Task 1 is a blocker for multiple other tasks, not all of which need to be completed in sequence?\n The trigger that works based on IDs seems more generally useful, but also even less ergonomic. If you want Task 1.5 to be enabled automatically after Task 1 is done, you have to create a UUID for 1.5, copy it, navigate to Task 1, and create a trigger property for it with the copied UUID value - which would certainly be a pain in the ass to do from e.g. the agenda.\n Something like org-linker-edna would be nice, but its functionality is tied pretty closely to Helm (I'm an Ivy user).

If anyone has any idea what I'm going on about, please let me know!\n EDIT: I believe what I was looking for was use-package emacs and storing Emacs settings like (setq inhibit-startup-screen t) there, as raised in this post, found by u/graduale and u/scbagley.

          "description": "I've been working over the last week to read and process for my ZK a particular book.  It contains about 40 short articles by different authors with \"inspirational\" messages and discussions of life experiences.  I created a zettel for each article (these were fairly short, mostly one- or two-idea articles).  After a while, I created a structure note for the book, grouping and linking to each zettel/article.\nSo far, so good - normal use of a structure note.  The little \"aha\" moment came as follows...\nAt the end of each zettel, (because the zettel contained an inspirational idea), I added a \"What will I do?\" question.  I didn't want to just capture the idea, I wanted to see if I could incorporate it into my life in some useful manner.  The \"aha\" thought was to copy that question and its short answer from each zettel and paste that after the reference to the corresponding zettel on the structure note.  That way, I can simply scan down the structure note occasionally to remind myself of what I wanted to do, check my progress, pick out one item on which to focus for a few days, etc.\nSo the structure note became a way of reviewing my follow-up actions.  This is a simple addition that I've made to one structure note, and perhaps in retrospect, it is so evident as to be painfully obvious.  But it both simplifies and enhances the way that I interact with my ZK.  I have previously written zettels about various philosophies (regarding ethical behaviour) and have a few structure notes related to those.  If time permits, I may give them the same treatment.\nAs an aside, I did ask a question about this process before (of acting on ideas we bring into our ZK), which received a few interesting comments.

I use my Zettelkasten for maintaining references that are actually in use but Zotero holds lots of unused and unmaintained references (i.e. not in my ZK), especially webpages that i store offline just in case the source is changed or unavailable.\nIn Zotero it is easy to find duplicates which is the only maintenance i do. Zotero allows creating folders, tags to help with search but i find maintaining two separate systems is too much effort. I also don't worry much about unused references because i don't see them as backlog, they're just collecting dust. But i know there is good stuff in it and occasionally i'd simply like to dig into it and add something interesting to my Zettelkasten.\nI think what would be most helpful to me is a list of unused references sorted by creation date or in general allow communication between both systems for maintenance purpose only.\nIn previous discussions others mentioned that they use \"The Internet Archive\" to store webpages or don't store webpages in their RMS at all and instead paste the URL to the note1.

          "description": "I did a little searching on the forum and didn't find a whole lot about this idea. (the main thing I found was someone's setup for creating journal entries) A lot of new note-taking applications (e.g.: Roam, Craft) have the idea of creating a dedicated note for specific days of the year when you access the application. This allows for easy access to journaling, creating stuff that you'll see on specific days, idea entry that you can sort later, etc. which I personally find to be quite nice. I don't necessarily always have some specific title in mind for something I want to write about, or even links to other things.\nThis seems to be a bit at odds with how The Archive wants to nudge you into adding to your Zettelkasten. And just basically somewhat opposed to the idea of creating atomic notes that are heavily interlinked, since it's more of a scattered \"note\" that might just have thoughts about stuff on a specific day. But I also wouldn't want to give up the ability to link to things in my Zettelkasten (and have stuff in separate locations, because goodness knows I've used a lot of applications and have notes scattered everywhere), or searchability across everything, because I want to write stuff related to specific days. (I have made at least one note in the style of the linked post, using just YYYYmmdd, which maybe just solves the issue but I haven't done much with that idea yet so I'm not sure how it might work out long term)\nDoes anybody have experience working with \"Daily Notes\" in The Archive/Zettelkastens in general? Is there something specific you do to make it work well? Is this discouraged? etc.",

It happens quite often that while I'm writing a note I end up pressing ESC twice in a row (for example to cancel a search in the note, or the spelling box), and suddenly I lose the view of the note. While I can easily go back to the note, it still takes a bit of time to find the line I was at. Plus, there is an annoying break in the flow.\nI was wondering if others had a similar experience and if they have a solution. Maybe redefining ESC with Keyboard Maestro, in such a way that one can still use this to cancel the other boxes (find, spelling etc.)?

For this to be possible, the method of storage must not place its own restraints on the information. This is why a \"web\" of notes with links (like references) between them is far more useful than a fixed hierarchical system. When describing a complex system, many people resort to diagrams with circles and arrows. Circles and arrows leave one free to describe the interrelationships between things in a way that tables, for example, do not. The system we need is like a diagram of circles and arrows, where circles and arrows can stand for anything.\n\n\nFrom Tim Berners-Lee's original proposal for the worldwide web.
