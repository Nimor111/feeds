          "description": "In my Haskell phase I found that I had to think far too much about laziness versus strictness and space leaks, and I ended up writing code full of strictness annotations to get around this. Yet at the same time Haskell provides a certain power and way of thinking that very few other languages do. So what I am wondering is whether there are any languages like Haskell out there that provide both laziness and strictness, but instead of laziness being the default, strictness is instead. Sure, strict-by-default makes it harder to implement things such as infinite lists and foldr, but that seems to be a small loss compared to not having to worry about exhausting one's RAM because one forgot to put a ! somewhere.\n    submitted by    /u/tabemann  \n [link]   [comments]",

Python :) At least in the spirit of its Zen: \"one and preferably only one obvious way to do it\", \"simple is better than complex\", \"readability counts\" etc, otherwise similar to Haskell (or PureScript even closer now) in semantics. It's just a specification for fun and I don't think it'll ever get to implementation, so below question is purely curiosity-driven you can unleash your imagination if you want.\n So, if you had a chance to embed an effect system in a modern FP language to avoid any boilerplate, syntax quirks and perhaps performance penalties or at least ship it in a stdlib, how would the system look like? Haskell has plenty of options implemented as libraries - I want to avoid this galore given the \"one way\" mantra. May it could be one of those libraries like polysemy, but as part of language spec?

I'll explain why. Every other programming language forces the programmer to keep track of time in order to read and write the code. There is a notion of when things happen that needs to be considered, and this often makes it hard to re-use code and leads to unexpected interactions. Haskell code, on the other hand, requires no notion of time. Haskell code is tenseless, inert. Haskell code doesn't do things. Haskell code merely means things. That made it easier to learn, read, and write than other languages like Java or even Python and Javascript.\"\n This is the link to the comment -> https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/s/uhjWTq0rRb\n I was curious if there's any resource that helps you learn haskell the same way the commentor learned.

Besides, my teacher wasn't a good professor, so this made things worse. But instead of saying that this language is useless, I decided to give it a chance, since there might be a reason I'm supposed to learn it. After that, I end up enjoying Haskell and started viewing it as a new tool and a different approach to solve problems. I told my friends that I would continue to learn Haskell and read books about it during vacation time, and they laughed at me, told me that it is useless, that I'm just wasting my time, that Haskell has no real life application and that I should learn Java if I wanna get a job (we'll learn Java next semester).

          "description": "Let's say I have a record type like\n data PosInt = PosInt { getInt :: Int } \n and I want to maintain some invariance about it. Here, that the wrapped Int is always positive (I know in this example I could also use a newtype but bear with me). So (I guess?) the standard approach would be to not expose the type constructor, so only the current module can construct instances of type PosInt. However, I still want to give read access to the wrapped Int, so I want to expose getInt. I might end up with something like:\n module Lib ( PosInt(getInt), setInt) where data PosInt = PosInt { getInt :: Int } setInt :: Int -> Maybe PosInt setInt x | x > 0 = Just (PosInt x) | otherwise = Nothing \n Now if I try to construct a PosInt outside this module, the type checker complains:\n import Lib ( PosInt(..) ) test1 :: PosInt test1 = PosInt (-3) -- type error \n So far so good. But given a PosInt I can actually violate my invariance using the getInt field:\n import Lib ( PosInt(..) ) test2 :: PosInt -> PosInt test2 x = x { getInt = -3 } -- no type error \n That caught me a bit off guard. It's not a problem if I define getInt \"manually\":\n data PosInt = PosInt Int getInt :: PosInt -> Int getInt (PosInt x) = x \n Maybe I misunderstood the role of record fields. This convention of calling them getSomething gave me the impression that they only give read access.\n    submitted by    /u/ngruhn  \n [link]   [comments]",

But there's one single function that perpetually stumps me and I can't seem to understand how it works, and that's fix.\n The definition is\n fix f = let x = f x in x\n Trying to read through some stackoverflow answers explaining this function the closest I could get to understanding it is that the f passed into fix is infinitely composed with itself like so:\n  x = f . f $ x -- or x = f (f x) x = f . f . f $ x -- or x = f (f (f x)) x = f . f . f . f . f . f . f . f . f . f . f $ x -- etc. \n Given this explanation my question is, if a function is infinitely composed with itself, even if we were to have lazy evaluation here, how could it ever possibly terminate? The documentation says something about how fix produces the least fixed point of a function, looking that up I see something about domain theory and don't get any closer to understanding it.

          "description": "I've started a Cabal project which consists of an executable and a single test-suite. In the test-suite I call the executable in a subprocess using System.Process.callProcess. \n I've found that cabal test does not automatically rebuild the executable after its Main.hs has been modified. Hence tests were failing simply because the executable was out-of-date.\n It took me a while to figure out how to fix this so I'm recording the fix here. The Cabal file should look something like this:\n name: foo executable: bar main-is: Main.hs hs-source-dirs: app test-suite: tests type: exitcode-stdio-1.0 main-is: test.hs hs-source-dirs: tests build-tool-depends: foo:bar \n The build-tool-depends line ensures that the executable bar in project foo gets built every time the test-suite is run.\n The comments on this Github issue suggest that this is the official way of ensuring that an executable is built before a test-suite is run. And this open issue is requesting the addition of a run-tool-depends field which would create a distinction between executables used when building a component and those used to running a component.\n Is there a better way of directly testing an executable with Cabal?\n    submitted by    /u/ljbw_online  \n [link]   [comments]",

It's a simple API built with Haskell and Scotty, containerized with Docker for easy deployment.\n 🔗 Repo: https://github.com/mihassan/cloud-run-hs-demo\n Why This Project? I've been coding in Haskell for some time now mostly for toy projects. I really love coding in Haskell, but one thing I was missing is to easily share my work in a straightforward, cost-effective way to friends/colleagues. This setup, combining Haskell with Docker and Cloud Run, might not be ideal for a production-grade service but is great for demos and learning experiences - all for free.\n Project Overview:\n The project, cloud-run-hs-demo, is a basic Haskell application that uses the Scotty web framework to set up a simple API. This demo showcases how you can containerize a Haskell application using Docker and deploy it to Google Cloud Run, a managed platform that automatically scales your stateless containers.\n I am aware that the setup lacks many essential features like rate limiting, authentication mechanisms, and DDoS protection. Also, there are many options for web frameworks, such as servant, yesod etc. and many database libraries. These are critical for production-grade services to ensure security and manageability. This project serves as a demonstration on how easy it is to get started.\n Features:\n  \nSimple Haskell API using Scotty.\n SQLite readonly database using sqlite-simple project.\n Docker integration for Cloud Run deployment.\n Static webpage as frontend for the API.\n  \nI'd love to hear your thoughts, feedback, or any experiences with similar technologies.

          "description": "My question is a bit more general this, but help me understand the best way to namespace some code:\n I work for the National Solar Observatory. We are NSF funded, and my team processes data from the DKIST solar telescope. I'm excited to build tools for this in Haskell.\n FITS is the digital format used for telescope images. I've been contributing to the fits-parse package, which uses Data.Fits as a namespace, but my needs are growing beyond the scope of that package. I need to add support for the ASDF file format (containing metadata for many FITS images) and for the World Coordinate System (WCS), among other things.\n So I'd like to make a new package containing all the tools one might need to work with astronomical images from modern telescopes/observatories. How should it be namespaced?\n There's an existing package that uses the Data.Astro namespace: https://hackage.haskell.org/package/astro. The fits-parse package uses Data.Fits\n Let's assume that I create a single package for this, and name it telescope. Should the code be namespaced under Data or not? If yes, should I use a different namespace than the Data.Astro that the astro package uses?\n Option 1: Pick my own Top-level Namespace\n import Telescope.Fits import Telescope.Asdf import Telescope.Wcs \n Option 2: Add packages to existing namespaces like `Data.Astro`, which is used by the `astro` package\n Note that the `astro` package deals with calculating the position of celestial bodies, which is every bit as as valid a use of the word astronomy, but has a very different focus from my work to process astronomical observations.\n -- from this package! import Data.Astro.Fits import Data.Astro.Wcs -- from `astro` package import Data.Astro.Sun \n Option 3: Pick a new namespace under `Data` to differentiate from the other packages\n import Data.Telescope.Fits import Data.Telescope.Wcs \n What's the right approach here?\n    submitted by    /u/embwbam  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Specific question here for tracing in Scala\n In a CRUD webapp, let's say a client receives an http request with a trace header, calls some logic, spins out some new fibers/futures/what-ever and does a bunch of work off the back of this instigating thing that all should be traced.\n If you want flamegraphs etc in the tracing visualisation tool of your choice to show where time gets spent for all subsequent calls (jaeger, datadog, graphana tempo, what-have-you). \n In Java you'd have the option of instrumenting the JVM, and you'd get this without having to in code pass contexts nor record spans - basically, you instrument the JVM and you're done (unless you want to explicitly gain access to it to do something more specific) and your only (some asterisks here, but, mostly) code interaction is to extract the trace-headers from the incoming http request.\n Am I correct in saying that this is not possible in Scala currently - Scala cannot be instrumented in this manner, and we need to use libraries akin to Natchez and/or otel4s where you manually call Span.trace(or whatever the library uses) each call that you want traced? \n I guess a TL;DR - is it possible to instrument scala for tracing, or is it necessary to interact with libraries?\n    submitted by    /u/mostly_codes  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I am upgrading a lot of Scala 2.13 services up to Scala 3, and have encountered some codebases where reflection was used in unit tests to examine all the subclasses of a trait.\n For example, in 2.x the way to make enumerations was with a sealed trait and case object subclasses. We would often make a collection listing all types, similar to Java enum .values. In our unit tests we would want to make sure no subtypes were accidentally omitted from that collection, and we would use reflection for that.\n ```scala import scala.reflect.runtime.universe\n val classType = universe.typeOf[Branding] val subclasses = classType.typeSymbol.asClass.knownDirectSubclasses ```\n This is gone in Scala 3 and I'm wondering if there is a simple alternative. I would love to spend a day or two learning the new Scala macro syntax but I don't have the time right now to devote to that, just for this simple 2-line expression.\n One might also suggest just updating our 2-style enums to Scala 3 proper enums. That will solve some of our scenarios but we use this \"find subclass types\" in tests for other classes as well, not just enums. For example we might occasionally have a trait with many subclasses and we want to make sure we have written a certain kind of test for each of the concrete subclasses, and reflection can come in handy as a sanity check here.\n gzoller/scala-reflection seems popular but I don't see any documentation.\n    submitted by    /u/jim_mccabe  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "As my first Halogen application has just surpassed 3K lines of Purescript code, and contains several components that communicate with and through each other, -I am starting to wish that I had some sort of visual 'map' to navigate the relationship between my components.\n This is where I got the idea that what if we could simply invoke a function on the 'root' component and then the function would output something like 'plantUML' which then can be compiled to a diagram. In theory all the required information to generate the diagram is contained in the type information for all the Halogen components.\n Being relatively new to Purescript, I don't have any clear idea how this could be achieved. But roughly I am thinking that since Purescript is quite weak on the metaprogramming side of things, one would probably have to exploit some FFI and JS to extract the information required to generate the diagram.\n For now I will probably just manually create my visual 'map' with plantUML since I am busy on my own project, however I just wanted to throw the idea out there. Perhaps I will work on it in the future, or perhaps someone else will like the idea and work on it.\n In any case it would be cool to hear from more experienced Purescript programmers whether or not this is possible and how it could be accomplished. I personally think it would be quite awesome to be able to generate visual overviews like that.\n    submitted by    /u/Combination-Western  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'd like to start using org-mode to create meeting agendas for various status and tagup meetings I attend with my boss and other team-mates working on projects. To date, my LaTEX/PDF exports tend to look more like term papers with bullet lists instead of paragraphs of text, so I end up cutting/pasting into MS Word to get simple lists of topics and action items to status. \n Does anyone have a recommended template or workflow for preparing itemized lists of topics to discuss at meetings? I've found several templates for capturing meeting minutes, but my needs are slightly different than that. I'm looking for a titled document with a date and simple two-column bulleted lists - perhaps including a table, graphic, etc.?\n    submitted by    /u/misuseRexKwonDo  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have a giant org file (~3 megs) with tons of nested headlines, and every so often when I'm zooming around one of them won't expand. Other nearby headlines will still expand, but this one won't.\n I can get around the issue by deleting the collapsed headline and whatever subtree is underneath it, then yanking it back, right where it was. Once I do that, I can expand it just fine, and I won't have the problem again for days. I can't figure out any commonalities as to why this happens. I think it's happened across multiple versions of emacs (running 29.2 now) and org (9.6.25) but because I am a dumbass, I was not exhaustive in tracking the first appearance.\n I doubt anybody will be able to diagnose the issue from what I've written here, so diagnosis isn't what I'm after. What I'm after is this: could someone tell me how to get whatever contextual info would be most relevant to debug it properly, next time it happens?

In place of what should have been a buffer for org-agenda-list is a seemingly random buffer.\n Apparently desktop-buffer-mode-handlers can add support for Org Agenda buffers but I don't see an e.g. org-agenda-restore-buffer so I guess on would need to use a custom function? I don't know much programming so hoping someone has found a solution for this.\n I also looked into activities.el but it looks like each \"activity\" is a frame/tab, but for my workflow with a tiling window manager I find it more suitable to liberally create and destroy frames from my window manager's workspaces and for now at least am just looking for a way to restore all buffers/frames/window configuration without the need to create and switch projects. Actually activities.el might be suitable if an activity includes a set a frames. I prefer dealing with frames than Emac's window management because I often work with at least a browser alongside in a window manager workspace and it's just less cognitive overhead to treat each buffer as a frame when the rest of your applications are also managed by the window manager.\n    submitted by    /u/exquisitesunshine  \n [link]   [comments]",

Instead of showing a proper superscripted citation, the generated ODT document shows the underlying org shorthand (e.g., ^{1}). Using a (relatively) minimal example:\n  \n#+TITLE: Manuscript Title \n #+OPTIONS: author:nil toc:nil num:nil \n #+CITE_EXPORT: csl ~/path/to/CSL/styles/american-medical-association.csl \n * Testing \n This is a test sentence with a citation.[cite:@somecitekey] \n This is standard superscript.^{1} \n #+PRINT_BIBLIOGRAPHY:\n  \nThe first sentence will render as (^{1}), and the second sentence will render with appropriate superscript (1). The bibliography will render appropriately according to the CSL style, as expected.\n Interestingly, when I export to other formats such as HTML, the superscripted citations render appropriately—it's only ODT that has issues. Also, unsurprisingly, this isn't an issue for CSL formats that do not require superscript for in-text citations.\n For reference, I'm using citeproc-el and the advanced org-mode-ox-odt fork to export org files to ODT, although I don't know how much of a difference this makes.\n Any help or insight would be greatly appreciated!\n    submitted by    /u/Mortal_Scum  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I spent a lot of time reading and thinking about if I want to learn Emacs or Vim since they have very high learning curves, I went with Vim because I had been looking a way to better edit text. Vim's modal editing is very powerful, allowing me to make lots of changes to text with only a handful of keystrokes. I wonder if that's why most Vim and Neovim users chose it over Emacs and if that's why Vim is much more popular than Emacs.\n Emacs is a modeless editor and you need a third party emulation like Evil mode for modal editing, but that's not full Vim. You wouldn't be able to install Vim or Neovim plugin, especially ones that extend its modal editing capabilities like the Vim surround plugin. Perhaps it might be possible to use the headless Neovim backend for text editing in Emacs, like the VS Code Neovim extension or Firenvim Firefox addon does, but why do that when you could just use Neovim?\n I think that all the extensibility Emacs has to make it essentially an app platform alone isn't something that appeals to a lot of users, but what if Emacs had modal editing as good as Vi / Vim's from the start? It seems like Vi Vim and even Neovim never had the level of extensibility as Emacs does, so what if it was a matter of picking between a modal editor, and a modal editor with lots of extensibility? (an oversimplified hypothetical comparison but still).\n And by the way, what was the rationale for the decision of Emacs to be a modeless editor rather than a modal editor?\n    submitted by    /u/TheTwelveYearOld  \n [link]   [comments]",

I attempted to install Emacs and Org Mode using Homebrew --cask emacs and emacsformacosx, but encountered an error. So, I followed the tutorial on https://josephdubon.com/blog/how-to-install-doom-emacs-macbook-pro-2023, and it worked, but I don't want Doom, I only want Emacs and Org Mode. How can I achieve this? (I want to emphasize that I specifically need Emacs because I want to follow Reiner's Udemy course.) Please help me :(\n    submitted by    /u/Tough_Ad8746  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "When I met my husband 10 yrs ago, he was everything I ever wanted. We met on a freenode IRC channel. He was a Gentoo and Linux-from-scratch dual-booter who could install both systems with his eyes closed. We used to have long, romantic conversations well past midnight about tabs vs spaces and open source. Our first fight ever was about MIT vs GPL licensing. On our first date, we shared our tiling manager config files with each other (this was the first time I truly felt love for a man).\n However, lately he’s changed into a husk of the man he used to be. He migrated to Linux Mint, because, and I quote, he “just wants to get work done” and he “no longer has time to fiddle with [his] system”. Then, he started using GNOME for the same reason. This was already very suspicious. I mean, if he truly just wanted to start using a full DE, he could have at least picked KDE, right? Even Xfce I’d have been ok with.\n Then, the other day, our relationship hit a breaking point. Here I was, working on my 2012 NixOS thinkpad, and hubby calls me over to his office. He said he “wanted to show me something”. I sit down on his chair, and you can imagine my terror as he pulls up vim on his terminal. He had a weird smile on his face, as if something had taken him over. He spent the next few mins “showing off” a variety of vim tricks he’d just learned. I had to turn my face to the side so he wouldn’t see the tears drying on my cheeks. Let me be clear: This was NOT the man I married.\n Our relationship has had its ups and downs, but I never imagined my husband would stoop so low as to become a vim peasant. I don’t know what to do. Part me says I should just start divorce proceedings and get it over with, but the other part can’t help but wonder if perhaps my husband is being afflicted by some serious, undiagnosed mental illness.\n Please advise reddit, my whole life is in shambles and I don’t know what to do\n    submitted by    /u/gentoogirl  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Maybe you dont like it but that's fine, it is just an idea as of now as someone who is using emacs just for orgmode for years and recently started to use dired. I'm sorry not using it for more than those 2 things, please have mercy with me. \n So back to my idea. That email \"client\", well actually it is just a viewer, the receiving and sending part would have to be done with offlineimap, sendmail and friends:\n  \nthere are different orgmode files, e.g. ~/org/mail/inbox.org, ~/org/mail/sent.org, ~/org/mail/drafts.org and all of them contain headlines which actually are emails, but they are just rendered as headlines.\n The headline includes the subject, but could also include some state such as READ or SENT\n The body is the text of the email\n Attachments? Use org attachment to add them\n Maybe we could also use properties for recipients or use the tags, I'm unsure about this one \n a scheduler would iterate over those files every few minutes/hours and actually sends that email (headline) \n you can archive an email, which would actually just refile it, or you could also move things around like refiling\n I don't know if you can partially set some parts of the buffer to be read only, I don't know if it would make sense to set all those files to be read only, hmm\n use org capture templates to write a new email, depending on the cursor position it would either be a reply or new mail\n  \n   submitted by    /u/Valuable-Date-896  \n [link]   [comments]",

I used to write (too many) jupyter notebooks with VSCode but I find that I can organize my code & notes better with org documents and just simple Python files. I started using emacs-jupyter after reading Martí Bosch's blog on the topic. My current workflow is just opening up a python file (or write a new one), then running `jupyter-run-repl` and then `jupyter-repl-associate-buffer`. Then I do execute a region or execute line-by-line via `jupyter-eval-line-or-region` bound to `C-c C-c`. The thing with this workflow is that the jupyter REPL gets quite long as I'm tweaking little things about the graphs or visualization I'm working on. Is there a better workflow that people use for doing this kind of work?

So this probably doesn't help.\n  \nSome questions:\n  \n1) Are there any commonly used concise terms around this whole \"editor as an application interface\" concept in general? \n ...it could be either specific to emacs, or more broadly for other editors too.\n \ne.g. We have some pretty common terms like \"CLI, TUI, GUI, desktop-app, web-based, mobile-app\" etc that are used to quite clearly denote the all the common interfaces...\n So I'm hoping there's some easily-Google-searchable short term for this stuff too?\n \n 2) If you know of any specific guides/learning resources on the topic, please share a link (or name I can search).\n 3) I'm guessing that emacs is the #1 GOAT when it comes to how well it can do this stuff? But curious what other editors can also do this, and how they compare in abilities?\n 4) Amongst the variants of emacs, which is best for this? For my use case it needs to work just as well on Windows as Linux.\n 5) Also feel free to share any personal anecdotes on what discovering this paradigm meant to you personally. \n Including where you've seen big improvements in usability/efficiency etc\n And maybe also were there any specific use cases where you over-estimated how useful it would be? And you went back to the mainstream types of interface for something?\n \n  \n   submitted by    /u/r0ck0  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I am going through the Emacs Lisp Intro manual to consolidate my Elisp knowledge. In the \"More Complex\" section, the function \"copy-to-buffer\" is suggested as a case study. I will include it here for your reference:\n (defun copy-to-buffer (buffer start end) \"Copy to specified BUFFER the text of the region.\" (interactive \"BCopy to buffer: \\nr\") (let ((oldbuf (current-buffer))) (with-current-buffer (get-buffer-create buffer) (barf-if-buffer-read-only) (erase-buffer) (save-excursion (insert-buffer-substring oldbuf start end))))) \n Perhaps I do not understand well how the save-excursion works. But, since we are setting temporarily the current buffer to the \"buffer\" argument by using the \"with-current-buffer\", and we are erasing its contents with \"erase-buffer\", why do we use \"save-excursion\"?\n After we use \"erase-buffer\" don't we get point, point-min and point-max set to 1?\n It seems to me that it is just redundant to save the excursion inside the empty buffer when all the points have the value 1. Then why do we do that?\n Thank you very much.\n EDIT: I think that I understand the reason of save-excursion in this case. It is a user-friendly feature. It ensures that after pasting the text in the empty buffer, the point is set back to the value 1. I guess it is a just to avoid confusing the user by having the point set to point-max. When the user switches to the buffer where the selection was pasted, the users will see the beginning of the buffer instead of the end.

To simplify things, she has started to develop arthritis-like symptoms that will get progressively worse, and she will lose her vision over time. \n She's not very technical, but I know there are a lot of interesting ergonomics modes like xah-fly-keys, or even just spacemacs style bindings with a leader key. I'd love some recommendations for relatively easy to learn ergonomics systems that might be less intimidating to newer users. Right now I'm leaning towards spacemacs because that seems the easiest way for someone who would probably be pretty put off by editing an init.el right out of the gate. \n I also thought that over time she could augment this with speech to text as well as text to speech. I know that there are a number of emacs tools like emacsspeak, but I remember seeing a video on youtube where someone had some hooks into a google text to speech library, and was using ai to send audio clips to chat gpt.If that rings a bell for anyone, please let me know what they were using.

          "description": "tldr: Don't upgrade your tree-sitter library, otherwise Emacs will crash when loading it. If you've already upgraded tree-sitter, either a) roll back to v0.22.2, or b) rebuild Emacs. If you use a package manager, uninstalling and reinstalling Emacs should rebuild Emacs.\n The latest version of tree-sitter library is binary-incompatible with the previous version, but the ABI version remains unchanged. That means package managers will simply replace the old libtree-sitter.so file with the new one. Then when Emacs runs, this binary-incompatible libtree-sitter.so is loaded and crashes Emacs.\n What should've happened is for tree-sitter to bump the ABI version; then package managers would install the new libtree-sitter.so file alongside the old libtree-sitter.so, rather than replacing it. And Emacs will still load the old libtree-sitter.so. \n Rebuilding Emacs will resolve this issue since Emacs and tree-sitter remain compatible on the source level. Rebuild the Emacs binary and it'll be compatible with the new tree-sitter binary.\n Source: https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter/issues/3296\n (I'll note that please don't reply in the GitHub issue unless you have constructive things to add.)\n    submitted by    /u/casouri  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm realizing that i'm doing more and more things inside emacs and struggle to find a balance of what i want keybinds for. Some stuff is super obvious, like `project-find-file` or Window navigation. But with Org-Mode, Roam/Denote, Magit, Dired and Terminal things, i'm not sure how many functions i want to bind to keybinds.\n Thing is, keybinds are only quicker, if you remember them. If you need to search through which-key, just `M-x` and searching is faster. So, do you tend to create keybinds for most things in the packages you use? Or just for the one or two things you use multiple times a day and search for the rest?\n Additionally, maybe someone can give me a hint if this is possible: Can i come up with a sort of \"custom Command Palette\"? So, like `M-x` but it should only contain commands is specifiy? I find that with things like consult or other packages, searching `M-x` can be hard, when a package provides tens of interactive commands.\n    submitted by    /u/domsch1988  \n [link]   [comments]",

But first, I need to figure out the simple one. \n Why is it skipping the first step?\n  \nAdditional notes:\n er/mark-word and er/mark-paragraph are defined in expand-region code. er/mark-eol and er/mark-bol are my custom functions, and they seem to be working just fine, at least when they are called directly, and not via er/expand-region. Interestingly, er/mark-word is also doing what you expect, when called independently.

For example, if I have a journal entry that talked about a philosophical topic in application to my life, I want it to link to one of my studies of that topic that is part of the philosophy category. Essentially, I want to map my brain. \n In order to keep my files organized, I was planning on keeping my files for each topic in a completely separate directories from the Org-roam directory. I would have an org file in the Org-roam directory that links to that particular file and if there is a relationship, I would just link the org files in the Org-roam directory. In other words, the org files in the Org-roam directory simply contains links to the actual files in my file system and serves as the linker. \n To organize my files in my file system, I plan on using the denote package for its file naming scheme.\n How does this setup sound? Are there any better setup designs that you can recommend? I was thinking about just using denote, but I like the org-roam-ui and I would like to keep everything in separate dirs.

What I tried was to create a custom minor mode that would change the keybindings to what I want. From my understanding, since this mode is more recently added to minor-mode-alist and minor-mode-map-alist, the bindings in my-isearch-mode-map should take higher precedence than isearch-mode-map. However, when I define it and activate it, isearch bindings still function like the default.\n Here is the link to my code. Be warned, it is not pretty as this is my first time writing a minor mode.\n What am I missing? Is there a better way to do this? I want to avoid hacky solutions to the best of my ability and I don't want to have to go down to route of trying (and probably failing) to remake isearch just to get this one thing to work.\n I am open to suggestions on other packages as well.

I don't know much programming so hoping someone has found a solution for this.\n I also looked into activities.el but it looks like each \"activity\" is a frame/tab, but for my workflow with a tiling window manager I find it more suitable to liberally create and destroy frames from my window manager's workspaces and for now at least am just looking for a way to restore all buffers/frames/window configuration without the need to create and switch projects. Actually activities.el might be suitable if an activity includes a set a frames. I prefer dealing with frames than Emac's window management because I often work with at least a browser alongside in a window manager workspace and it's just less cognitive overhead to treat each buffer as a frame when the rest of your applications are also managed by the window manager.\n    submitted by    /u/exquisitesunshine  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello, I've been trying to setup emacs for the first time and it's been pretty easy and straightforward apart from a couple issues. I'm setting it up on a NixOS Virtual Machine using home-manager: I have two files a default.nix where I say which packages to install and a config.el where I write the configs. Here are the relevant parts from the files:\n default.nix:\n { pkgs , ... } { programs.emacs = { enable = true; package = pkgs.emacs; extraConfig = builtins.readFile ./config.el; extraPackages = epkgs: with epkgs; [ evil evil-collection treesit-auto ]; }; } \n config.el:\n (setq evil-want-keybinding nil) (require 'evil) (require 'evil-collection) (evil-collection-init) (evil-mode 1) (require 'treesit-auto) (global-treesit-auto-mode) \n The issues are:\n When I run home-manager switch I get two issues. The first one is assignment to free variable 'evil-want-keybinding' followed by a reminder to set evil-want-keybinding to nil before loading evil and evil collection (even if I am doing it).\n The second one is that it gives the error cannot open load file: no such file or directory, treesit.\n I've tested and the issues are disconnected from one another. I've been googling around for a day now and I wasn't able to find a fix to either. If any of you may know how to fix I'd be grateful.\n EDIT: Regarding the treesitter problem, I'm just a moron. The default pkgs.emacs is version 28. Changing it to pkgs.emacs29 it works. It does compile and works, but it does still give me issues about evil-want-keybinding.\n    submitted by    /u/Elq3  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I've been looking at trying out treesitter support again (specifically, c-ts-mode), and one thing that's got me stuck is how to modify the rules that are used to highlight the text. c-ts-mode makes some baffling decisions where it deviates from cc-mode in how certain things get highlighted, and I'd like to change this.\n I haven't been able to see anything about how to modify the highlighting so far. c-ts-mode doesn't offer anything like c-ts-mode-indent-style for modifying indentation, and the general treesitter documentation for font lock stuff doesn't really help. The closest I've figured so far is that maybe you can write a mode hook that adds entries to the treesit-font-lock-settings list, but there's no indication if this would actually work, and if so how.\n I'm worried that the only \"solution\" right now is to copy-paste the font lock rules in c-ts-mode and manually maintain a separate copy just to change a couple things, which would obviously be unacceptable. And I can't sidestep the issue by, say, modifying font faces to look better, because the issues I want to fix have to do with poorly-chosen generic font faces for some of these rules.\n If modifying syntax highlighting isn't possible right now, then I'll make a feature request and go back to waiting for treesitter support to be usable. I'm just not sure what part of emacs would be responsible for the new feature. I get the impression that the font lock rule system as it is now makes it really difficult for a major mode to let you extend its rules, so I'm leaning towards it being a treesitter feature request (as opposed to a c-ts-mode feature request).\n    submitted by    /u/ShimmerFairy  \n [link]   [comments]",

Or is the intention that everything should be in a silo, rather than in the default `denote-directory`?\n Either way, I think things could get complicated working in different silos (assuming the goal is to keep them separate). Perhaps what is needed is some indication prepended to buffer-name of the silo - e.g. if the silo is in ~/Orgs/Silo1 and the #+title is \"My plain title\", the buffer name would be \"Silo1:My plain title\". If we were in the default `denote-directory` , buffer-name would just be \"My plain title\".\n Thanks\n Nick\n    submitted by    /u/N1ck_B  \n [link]   [comments]",

I just want to start coding but I can't because I can't even get this editor set up.\n ​\n Edit: I woke up with renewed vigor and I am going to try again when I get home from some obligatory human activities which unfortunately detract me from my goal of being a data spirit of some kind.

          "description": "I'll preface by stating that I use project.el, and not projectile. Any solutions involving the latter won't do for me.\n In most other editors, you can create a file at the project root (or some other predefined path) that specifies settings and, among other things, launch commands.\n These commands are for anything related to the project, be it running, compiling, testing, debugging, whatever.\n I want something like this for emacs. So, I've been investigating possible ways to do it.\n I created a .dir-locals.el file on the project root. Emacs automatically loads this file. In it, I defined numerous variables with commands. I defined compile-command and created my own, like run-command and test-command.\n I would then need to create functions that read these variables and run their values, similar to how compile-command is handled. This would work just fine, but there's an issue.\n Since the variables I'm creating are unknown to emacs, it marks them as risky. So, what ends up happening is that every time you open a file where these variables would apply, you get a prompt asking you if you want to apply the variables.\n I managed to fix this by setting these variables as safe when giving them strings like this:\n (put 'compile-and-run-command 'safe-local-variable #'stringp) (put 'run-command 'safe-local-variable #'stringp) (put 'test-command 'safe-local-variable #'stringp) \n And while this works, it irks me the wrong way, since this file would obviously be bundled with the project. So, if anyone else downloads this project and opens it with emacs, they won't have this extra config and they will be bugged by it, and for no good reason since they won't have the functions that use these variables anyway so it's of no use to them.\n So, I'm looking for a way to:\n  \nDefine an arbitrary amount of commands to run on a project.\n Have this configuration loaded automatically.\n Not be a nuisance to third parties.\n  \nAny ideas?\n    submitted by    /u/SnooPets20  \n [link]   [comments]",

Changelog is available here.\n This release integrates Kele with the menu bar. With this initial integration, you can switch Kubernetes contexts and default namespaces from within the menu bar. Kele presents your available contexts and namespaces as dynamic sub-menus, freeing you from the need to remember exact names and typing them in by hand (similar to kubectx and kubens on the terminal).\n https://preview.redd.it/lhzkprkuk9uc1.png?width=1512&format=png&auto=webp&s=8662d3e5c17ef2b864a8089b52dbd33c5641eb32\n With this release, Kele is now also integrated with doom-modeline. By adding the k8s segment to your doom-modeline configuration, you'll see current context and namespace information directly on the modeline. By clicking the segment, you can also access the menu bar, for the (menu-bar-mode -1) crowd.\n https://preview.redd.it/sx90o1w4k9uc1.png?width=820&format=png&auto=webp&s=8be6f1ceac15d87628b00d5ff9e4d95a224bf0cb\n https://preview.redd.it/nhtff5ink9uc1.png?width=1214&format=png&auto=webp&s=361736c62d4b83173a7e9f94aeadbd621692cf57\n For more details, see the Kele documentation.

          "description": "Hello emacs community, no matter how hard i try i cannot seem to wrap my head around the idea of using hooks in emacs. I have two examples to provide. The one working and the other one not, although i've seen both in the documentation.\n First example: Defining a function and then passing in to the hook.\n ```emacs-lisp (defun my-c-mode-hook () (setq c-basic-offset 4 indent-tabs-mode nil electric-indent-mode nil) (message \"C-mode hook loaded successfully\"))\n (add-hook 'c-mode-common-hook 'my-c-mode-hook) ``` Even though the message prints, the variables don't seem to get the values.\n Second example:\n emacs-lisp (add-hook 'c-mode-common-hook (lambda () (setq c-basic-offset 4 indent-tabs-mode nil electric-indent-mode nil) (message \"C-mode hook loaded successfully\" ))) \n The second one, passing a lambda to the hook works. It also is the same for my latex-mode hooks.\n So my question is, what is the difference between the two methods and what am i missing here. If anyone wants to share a resource for working with emacs hooks it will also be really appreciated.\n On the note of hooks, i have a more general question. When using the setq-default it will set the variable globally if it can. tab-width for example if set with `setq-default does not apply to all buffers. But if it is passed with a hook it works. Correct me if i'm wrong but does that happen because the settings get overwritten by the major mode? That's why you need the hook to overwrite the major mode defaults perhaps???\n Thank you in advance.\n    submitted by    /u/CrispyBoye  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm basically hoping to improve the following aspects:\n  \nTyping jsx/tsx forms\n Folding\n Structural editing\n  \n \nFor the first thing I probably can still use Emmet mode. Or maybe there's something better now?\n \nSince I'm already using treesitter, for folding I tried: emacs-tree-sitter/ts-fold, but because I'm using Emacs 30, I had to use this fork: abougouffa/treesit-fold, see emacs-tree-sitter/ts-fold#48 for details. That though still didn't get me the desired outcome. If I have a component such as:\n export default function Home() { return ( <main> <div> <p> ... \n \n and I try folding around <p>, it folds the entire function body. Not sure why. In general, I'm not sure what to use for folding to make it work with treesitter - ts-fold/treesit-fold, hideshow, evil-fold, origami, bicycle, yafolding, evil-vimish-fold, or something else?\n  \nFor structural editing I'm not even sure what would be helpful here. I'm thinking of trying evil-matchit, to quickly jump to beginning/end of an element, because evil's % keybinding doesn't support html tags by default, but that's just one aspect. There are probably a few other things to consider?\n  \nWhat are your thoughts? In general, do you know of any other Emacs packages you'd recommend for web-development? Also, I noticed that not all the features of emacs-tree-sitter/elisp-tree-sitter went into core (again, I'm using Emacs 30), do you think it's worth loading the package instead of relying on what's already in the core?\n    submitted by    /u/ilemming  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "New to emacs, not sure if this is a bug with the windows version or I'm missing something. Using version 29.3\n Very simple init.el:\n (add-to-list 'load-path \"path/to/evil\") (require 'evil) (evil-mode 1) \n But it still isn't enabled on startup. I can enable it manually, but interestingly, I have to enter the command twice. If I remove (evil-mode 1), I just have to execute the command once. Other commands in my init.el get executed as expected.\n It works as expected when running emacs through WSL. I've also tried installing with package.el and elpaca but same thing. I was also able to install general.el without issue, and I'm a solid 4 hours in at this point, so I'm not sure where else to look. It just seems like (evil-mode 1) in my init.el doesn't work for some reason\n Edit: Just added hooks to enable evil-mode to work around this\n    submitted by    /u/big_joplinK_3x  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Many note-taking apps like Obsidian provide the graph view functionality to visualize the relation of notes. But this kind of graph view only bases on linkages/references(incoming links and outgoing links) between notes. It is hard to recognize a specific long COT(chain of thoughts)——the starting point, the path and the end. Different COTs crossing in the graph view makes it more chaotic.\nLuhmann's zettelkasten is a \"combination of disorder and order, of clustering and unpredictable combinations emerging from ad hoc selection.\"\nThe graph view(generated by linkages/references) in some ways can represent the aspect of disorder of a zettelkasten. But what is the aspect of order?\n\"The absence of a fixed system of order and, in consequence, a table of contents turned the index into the key tool for using the file – how else should one be able to find certain notes again and thus gain access to the system of references? Not wanting to rely on pure chance requires being able to identify at least one point from which the respective web of references can be accessed. This is the purpose of the keyword index.\"\nBase on my understanding, the aspect of order in Luhmann's zettelkasten is composed of his note IDs and keyword index(register).\nAs so far, I don't find any note-taking apps provide the graph view functionality basing on Luhmann-style IDs and his keyword index——And this is why I created a new Obsidian plugin \"zettelkasten navigation\" recently. I think this plugin , in some ways, represents the real Luhmann way to retrive thoughts and navigate notes in a digital zettelkasten. The other note-taking apps should provide the similar functionality as well in future.\nShowcase:",
