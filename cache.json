Surprisingly, it was resolved by moving hs_init call to background thread - nothing in the docs suggested that it would made any difference, but it made the apps much more responsive on iOS (yet to test on Android).\n Does anybody know why it could have happened?\n We now use these RTS options that also help responsiveness and reduce memory usage by 10% (when the usage was large): - -A16m (chunk size for new allocations) - -H64m (initial heap size) - -xn (non-moving GC)\n Let me know if you have any comments on these!\n Thank you!\n    submitted by    /u/epoberezkin  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "As I get deeper into learning haskell I have noticed what seems to be \"Imperative Creep\" for the lack of a better term.\n It seems as the code gets more \"real world\" it becomes ever more imperative. In many examples across the web I see code very similar to the imperative style of a language like python. I'm not really understanding the point of all the great functional aspects of the language if you can't write functional code for real world use cases.\n I't's very confusing for a beginner to wrap their brains around the functional paradigm. Then, almost immediately after understanding this new programming concept you're hit with the Monad and all the educational literature starts you a new with imperative code - it's maddening. Every tutorial explains that \"do\" notation makes it easier to grok the monad by allowing a more imperative approach. WTF.\n I'm not changing any minds for certain. But, honestly I think this \"crutch\" has hampered my absorption of the learning material and perhaps increased the learning curve. Additionally this also makes the beautiful syntax of haskell look more like some JS crap with all the \"do\" \"if\" and \"case\", I mean really you can't use functors, applicatives or monads with \"pattern-matching\", \"guards\" and \"where\". Perhaps I have not learned anything of functional programming?\n I'm just ranting, apologies for the negative vibes.

Shouldn't building a package be one of the last steps in a project?\n What do people do if they, say only want to try out a package? With python for example you would probably create a virtual environment, install the package in it, import it in your source file and go.\n The analog to that solution would be sandboxes I assume, but as far as I understand those are depreciated these days.\n I used Haskell ~3 years ago, always installed packages globally, and then worked mainly with ghci. This was probably not ideal back then, but seems to not even work quite the same way today (cabal install <package> says <package> is not exposed or something along these lines).\n From what I read here, it seems that a \"python like workflow\" maybe works when working with nix (instead of cabal?).\n Can somebody help lift my confusion?

I am curious if you know of any projects that deal with similar problems I could use for inspiration. For now, I have a scope for the problem:\n The generator should be able to produce algorithms dealing with arrays and linear algebraic objects. Combining the right types from the vector-space and linear libraries, it should be possible to\n  \noperate on types like SquareMatrix, which get translated to an if condition with error on the start of the MATLAB function- evaluate linear functions, operators, maps and folds as imperative code from some basic building blocks.\n These computations will likely be in their own possibly monadic type and it should be possible to evaluate actions into either MATLAB code or direct execution as if it were a (almost) pure haskell function.\n Actions can be used to define MATLAB functions. Code generated from computations using a defined function should not repeat code, but generate the correct call instead\n  \n   submitted by    /u/TheBro2112  \n [link]   [comments]",

The main focus of this release is the ability to serve Swagger UI from the server with ease and ability to create clients from the same code as servers. I'm happy to confirm that both goals are reached with this release. \n The tutorial for library was created.\n Also there are many other improvements:\n  \nOpenApi schema for servers\n swagger servers support (we can add swagger to server with one line of code: withSwagger def server )\n clients from the same code as servers\n redesign of internal types\n redesign of DSL for routes\n many ergonomic improvements\n packages for extra utils\n split of mig package to several packages: \n mig - core\n mig-wai - rendering servers to wai apps\n mig-client - clients\n mig-extra - extra utils\n mig-server - mig servers with batteries\n mig-swagger-ui - swagger ui server\n \n tutorial and quickstart guide on github pages\n CI for repo with formatter, build and tests and update of docs on github pages\n  \nThe internal type for Servers was redesigned so that we assemble handler function with API description at the same time. In the first release it was just handler function under the hood.\n As a refresher mig is a family of libraries to write lightweight, simple, type-safe and composable servers. It strives to be in the middle ground between scotty and servant. To be composable, flexible and type-safe as servant and simple and lightweight in concepts as scotty.\n Thanks to Ambros for contribution. Also I'd like to thank authors of packages servant, servant-swagger-ui and servant-openapi3 packages for inspiration for my work in this release. Many lines of code are influenced by those packages.\n Links: * github * tutorial * examples * mig on hackage also see packages mig-server and mig-client.\n    submitted by    /u/anton-kho  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi everyone,\n We are very excited to announce Copilot 3.17 [2]. Copilot is a stream-based EDSL in Haskell for writing and monitoring embedded C programs, with an emphasis on correctness and hard realtime requirements. Copilot is typically used as a high-level runtime verification framework, and supports temporal logic (LTL, PTLTL and MTL), clocks and voting algorithms.\n Copilot has been used at NASA in drone test flights. Through the NASA tool Ogma [1] (also written in Haskell), Copilot also serves as a runtime monitoring backend for NASA's Core Flight System, Robot Operating System (ROS2), and FPrime (the software framework used in the Mars Helicopter) applications.\n This release introduces compatibility with what4 versions up to 1.5.1, and replaces several functions in copilot-core. The second change is a breaking change: the functions replaced have been deprecated and new alternatives introduced instead.\n As always, we're releasing exactly 2 months since the last release. Our next release is scheduled for Jan 7th, 2024.\n In our last announcement, we mentioned that Copilot has received full approval for release as NASA Class D open-source software. Current emphasis is on increasing test coverage for the two remaining libraries without tests (copilot-libraries and copilot-theorem), removing unnecessary dependencies, hiding internal definitions, and formatting the code to meet our new coding standards. Users are encouraged to participate by opening issues and asking questions via our github repo [3].\n There have been many updates on the Copilot front in the last few months. We'll be able to announce more soon. Stay tuned. Happy Haskelling!\n Ivan\n [1] https://github.com/nasa/ogma\n [2] https://github.com/Copilot-Language/copilot/releases/tag/v3.17\n [3] https://github.com/Copilot-Language/copilot\n [4] https://hackage.haskell.org/package/copilot\n    submitted by    /u/ivanpd  \n [link]   [comments]",

In addition to more standard machine learning tools like Pytorch, we use an embedded domain specific language and compiler written in Haskell to describe distributed data flows involving machine learning processes and game engines. We also build front end software in Haskell using the Monomer library and backend GPU code using a related functional language, Futhark. M.V. is an established team of a dozen developers now in its third year of research with tangible results.\n We are currently seeking a Haskell-centric developer to join our compiler development team. The job involves working on with machine learning engineers, artists and other developers to produce novel machine learning processes that go from controlling physical camera systems to producing finished game assets. Interested candidates should have a deep knowledge of the structure and interpretation of functional languages as well as ample real world Haskell knowledge. \n Currently accepting resumes at manifoldvalley.com. The mail address begins with my name ian at-symbol. Competitive salary and benefits package.

          "description": "So, by Gödel's second incompleteness theorem no system of axioms whose theorems can be listed by an algorithm can provide a proof of it's own consistency. Knowing that set theory is one such system, I began to wonder whether it's possible to write a program, for which it's impossible to prove that it never stops. Such a program, I imagine, would be able to describe set-theoretic theorems as values of some data type, then, given a set of axioms, combine those axioms using logic to form all the theorems of set theory. Then traverse those theorems and check if any of them are equivalent to a negation of one of the axioms, thus proving that set theory is inconsistent and causing the program to halt. For a program like that, you can't show that it never stops, because that would require showing that set theory is consistent, which is impossible to do using set theory. The problem is, I have no idea how to write a program like that or where to even start. I thought haskell would be a good choice, because it's already pretty close to math.

          "description": "Some statically typed languages that have null provide null safety by having a nullable and non-nullable version of each type. The compiler will prevent you from using null when the non-nullable version of the type is expected. You can pass in the plain non-null version of the type into any function that takes in the nullable type. The nullable type is a union between the non-nullable type and null.\n Kotlin is a good example of a language like this. Typescript kinda mostly does it. I don't know C# very well but I think the latest version finally fixed the initial nightmare they started with.\n Haskell, on the other hand, has Maybe. Maybe is a sum type, rather than a union type. If a function takes in a Maybe String, then you can't pass a String into the function.\n One advantage nullable types have over Maybe is that it's backwards compatible to weaken preconditions and strengthen postconditions. \n If your library has a function\n fun doIt(foo: String): Int?\n Then in the next version, you can change the signature to\n fun doIt(foo: String?): Int\n In a backwards compatible way. In Haskell, changing\n doIt :: String -> Maybe Int\n To \n doIt :: Maybe String -> Int\n Is a breaking change.\n Is there an advantage to representing optionality as a unique sum type, rather than a nullable union type?\n    submitted by    /u/shrinking_dicklet  \n [link]   [comments]",

For years, many people in the Haskell community have requested Windows support in vty. Thanks to Chris and Timofey for the time and energy they put into this, and their patience as we worked out an approach! Thanks also to Eric Mertens and Kevin Quick for early feedback on the release.\n In this release, the core \"vty\" package was reorganized so that support for specific platforms now lives in platform-specific packages that need to be used alongside the core \"vty\" package. This release includes the release of three aditional new packages:\n  \nvty-unix (Unix terminal support previously provided by \"vty\")\n vty-windows (the Windows backend)\n vty-crossplatform (for when you want to support both)\n  \nThe core package still provides all of the important library functionality and is still a necessary dependency. Applications will need to depend on an additional package for the platform that they need to support. When in doubt, use vty-crossplatform!\n The release changelog update has a detailed listing of changes as well as instructions for how to update your application to work with Vty 6.\n To get help, please open an issue on the Vty repository.\n While I'm at it, Brick has been updated to use vty-crossplatform in version 2.0!\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/jtdaugherty  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "author": null,
          "description": "For those who have reservations about the syntax of comprehensions, and there are a few, here's one possible alternative\n The approach is to extend an existing function to handle additional argument types, so that it replicates a comprehension via a single function call. For instance a function of two integers is among other things extended to also apply to two ranges of integers. There are some similarities with vectorization (see R, MATLAB, Julia and the like), although here you don't have to mix row vectors and column vectors.\n It's a kind of Polish notation for comprehensions: you're saying the same thing as before, but everything has been rearranged, and the main function comes first. Perhaps not unlike the original Polish notation, it takes some getting used to, and won't be to everyone's taste. But there are arguably a few advantages:\n  \nno need for specialized syntax: no on-the-fly variable bindings, so no left-arrows (or \"for\" or \"yield\")\n generally more concise notation that meshes well with Scala's use of underscores for lambda functions\n a direct style that can be used with effect handling, e.g. with Cats or ZIO\n a clear distinction between independent and dependent terms, determined by the static types\n  \nThis last property means that by default the library is a bit of a hybrid of David Turner's original list comprehension (which can handle any case, but always returns a sequence), and a more Julia-style array comprehension when things are \"rectangular\". This makes it straightforward to plot a function (via JavaScript and plotly). It also means an inherent distinction between the parallelizable and the sequential, i.e. applicatives and - the term was bound to crop up eventually - monads.\n Essentially it's a function-centric version of comprehensions, for those who would prefer not to use specialized syntax or macros, or maybe just want comprehensions in Java.\n    submitted by    /u/garlandus1  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "The FunFixture class looks like it works well when you have one or two indepenent items that need to be set up for the test. However, in my more complicated tests, I tend to have many things that need to be set up and which depend on each other.\n At the moment, using an ad-hoc set up like\n ​\n class MySuite extends munit.FunSuite: var foo: Foo = null var bar: Bar = null var quz: Quz = null var xyzzy: Xyzzy = null override def beforeEach(context: BeforeEach): Unit = foo = Foo() bar = Bar(foo) quz = bar.getQuz xyzzy = Xyzzy(foo, quz) widget = Widget(foo, bar) test(\"complicated\") { val results = widget.doStuff(xyzzy) assertEquals(results, xyzzy + foo.use(bar).use(quz)) } \n I'm not seeing a good way to write this with FunFixture My best guess is something like\n class MySuite extends munit.FunSuite: val foo = FunFixture[Foo](setup = _ => Foo()) val bar = FunFixture[Bar](setup = _ => Bar(howDoIGetTheValueOfFoo())) val quz = FunFixture[Quz](setup = _ => somehowGetBar().getQuz val xyzzy = FunFixture[Xyzzy](setup = _ => Xyzzy(getFoo(), getQuz()) val widget = FunFixture[Widget](setup = _ => Widget(getFoo(), getBar()) // Make everything into one fixture with some impressively ugly code val everything = FunFixture.map2(FunFixture.map2(foo, bar), FunFixture.map3(quz, xyzzy, widget)) // Run the test. Make sure you get the parentheses nesting right! everything.test(\"complicated) { ((f, b), (q, x, w)) => val results = w.doStuff(x) assertEquals(results, x + f.use(b).use(q)) } \n By this point, ad-hoc is looking simple and clean. And that's assuming that howDoIGetTheValueOfFoo can even be written and doesn't make it look even more complicated. And I'm not even certain you can unwrap the parameters like I did, so there may be more boilerplate just trying to get the actual values out.\n    submitted by    /u/Udalrich  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Apologies if the following seems dumb. I’m trying to figure something out with cats-effect-3 and scala. I have the following class structure:\n ``` trait Resource { def execute(): F[Output] }\n class A[F[_]] extends Resource { override def execute(): F[Output] = ??? }\n class B[F[_]](a: A[F]) extends Resource { override def execute(): F[Output] = { a.execute().flatMap(…) } } ```\n Each Resource type has an execute method whose output I want to memoize. So that dependent classes (there may be a third class C that can call a.execute) may call it multiple times in any order but they will all get the same value as a result. This would be pretty straightforward with scala’s Future (if I use It instead of F).\n I‘ve seen Async.memoize. However, that changes the signature to F[F[Output]] and I can only execute the “outer” flatMap once, or the results are re-calculated. In this case, I’m not sure how I would allow the dependent classes to use the memoized output.\n I’m relatively new to the Typelevel ecosystem, and I’m not sure if I’m thinking about this correctly. How would I modify the code such that my effect gets executed only once, no matter how many times I call it?\n Should I use the non-typelevel concurrency primitives to handle this outside the effect-system and then wrap it in F?\n I know I can probably orchestrate the “graph” of execution without having each dependent class doing this. But I need to chain the calls these way for the time being.\n ——\n UPDATE [2023/11/20]: For now, I’m going with an AtomicCell that wraps an Option value, and setting it to Some if it’s None (the initial value) using evalUpdateAndGet. This doesn’t seem very elegant though.\n    submitted by    /u/bhashit  \n [link]   [comments]",

My IDE of choice is IntelliJ, so I tried to make it work there, but so far, not very successfully.\n The first attempt was \"the way I know\" - build using Maven and use the IntelliJ Scala plugin for everything. But there was basically no help from the IDE (no autocomplete etc.).\n So I tried doing it \"the Scala way\" - installed SBT, created a project using the official guide, imported as a BSP project into Intellij using this guide and everything seemed to work - I can run the thing at least :-)\n But when I try to Ctrl+Click something from the standard library (like Seq or max on an Iterable), the IDE navigates to sources of 2.13 instead of 3.3.1. I tried enabling the BSP logs and the classpath SBT is returning is something like\n [ \"file:~/IdeaProjects/my_project/target/scala-3.3.1/classes/\", \"file:~/IdeaProjects/my_project/target/scala-3.3.1/test-classes\", \"file:~/.cache/coursier/v1/https/repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/scala-lang/scala3-library_3/3.3.1/scala3-library_3-3.3.1.jar\", \"file:~/.cache/coursier/v1/https/repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/scala-lang/scala-library/2.13.10/scala-library-2.13.10.jar\" ] \n is it OK that it's sending both Scala 2 and 3 jars? How can I make IntelliJ go to the Scala 3 stdlib on Ctrl+click?\n I'm sure I must be doing a simple msitake somewhere, but I'm out of ideas what to try. I already tried creating a new project from scratch, updating Intellij to the latest version, reinstalling SBT, nothing helps...\n Thanks in advance for any help or pointers!\n    submitted by    /u/snugar_i  \n [link]   [comments]",

I think I remember having a similar issue in the past because I wanted to use tapir with Caliban and each had a dependency on a different version of zio-http... I got it to compile and then run by breaking up the project into several sub-projects making sure there were no overlaps in dependencies, but this was kind of unwieldy considering it was a fairly small project, so I'd rather not do that again.\n Do correct me if I'm wrong, but from what I've read this isn't an Scala-only thing and also affects Java, so I'm wondering if there's a commonly known workaround for this that I don't know of (maybe some eviction policies in the sbt file, or in Java's case pom file?).\n    submitted by    /u/ToreroAfterOle  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "A recent post got me thinking about how we might go about extracting nested optional values with the convenience of Kotlin and TypeScript, but while still leveraging Scala's rich monadic types. Odersky's comment on another post indicated a way to reproduce a version of the ? syntax using Scala's boundary/break. His example works only with A | Null values, however. I wanted to see if I could accomplish the same while:\n  \nSupporting ? on any optional/failable type,\n Preserving failure types by returning an Either and tracking any failure types encountered in the get chain, and\n Still avoid any intermediate allocations (only construct the Either at the end)\n  \nYou can see my attempt in this gist\n The syntax is:\n val result: Either[F1 | F2 | F3, A] = getEither(obj1.?.obj2.?.obj3) \n Where F1, F2, and F3 are the failure types of obj1, obj2, and obj3. Option fails with Unit, Try fails with Throwable, and Either fails with its left type.\n I'm doubtful I'd ever actually use this: having to a) import `getEither` and `?`, b) wrap the statement in `getEither`, and c) add a dot before each `?` seems like just a little more would make me skip the usual syntax, but it was fun and interesting to work out how to do it. I'd be curious to hear others' thoughts.\n ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n Along similar lines, it occurred to me that you could produce an implementation of Option that has no allocation overhead. You can check out my attempt at that here. It just uses A | Null under the hood as an opaque type. It's two limitations that I know of are:\n  \ntoString does not show None or Some(x) but null and x (this is just a limitation of opaque types)\n I can't figure out a way to implement exhaustive extractors. Instead, you can use the fold method (which I've been using more and more these days anyways)\n  \n   submitted by    /u/jivesishungry  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I am working through the red book and trying the examples and exercises in a folder on my computer. I created two files GettingStarted and List, both of which I selected as new Scala classes and then Objects in Intellij.\n  \nI've noticed that I can only have one main function. I can't put a main in both GettingStarted and List. The IDE only recognizes the one in GettingStarted. I'm thinking this entire folder is considered one project, and you can only have one entrypoint in main. Is this right?\n I put extends App in List, and then I could run and debug things in List. I guess extending the main function from GettingStarted, I can then run the List file on its own.\n  \nCan someone explain to me how I should be thinking about files interacting with each other? In python I would use a __name__ == \"__main__\" to run code in each file. In C, I could write an int main() in each file and run each separately. But it seems in Scala it's very specific in terms of how def main() can appear.\n https://preview.redd.it/wynjw7x48myb1.png?width=331&format=png&auto=webp&s=02fec652be47aa0e318d5a1ddbcbd7eaad81566e\n    submitted by    /u/maraskooknah  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi all,\n I'm learning Scala on Coursera, I'm getting frustrated with my current issue very early on. I get a compile error for this code \"Found: Unit - Required: Boolean\".\n I understand what the error means, basically I am returning void somewhere where I should be returning a Boolean. But I just don't see how I am. I've called out all the variables individually to check they all are the types I think they are, and everything just looks fine to me.\n I'm just counting a List[Char] has the same number of opening and closing braces, I'll add functionality to check they actually match later:\n def balance(chars: List[Char]): Boolean = checkChar(0, chars) def checkChar(openCount: Int, chars: List[Char]): Boolean = val openBrace = \"(\".toList.head val closeBrace = \")\".toList.head val success = openCount == 0 val newCount = if chars.head == openBrace then openCount + 1 else if chars.head == closeBrace then openCount -1 else openCount if chars.isEmpty then success else checkChar(newCount, chars.tail) // The error is highlighted here \n The val \"success\" is a Boolean, and the function checkChar, called recursively, returns a Boolean. Why is it complaining about a Unit?\n ​\n ​\n    submitted by    /u/Necessary_Weakness42  \n [link]   [comments]",

Even after someone asked him to add an image to his little demo and it took literally FIVE MINUTES and then he cant even format it or move it on the page.\n Every Youtube tutorial is the same - people typing and typing and tying for 20 minutes at a time to do what I can on my phone in literally 30 seconds. Endless Endless ENDLESS obscure shortcuts and menus inside menus beneath submenus - all with no intuitive or conceptual link to navigate between disconnected dumps of unformatted text.\n Even within a single page, theres never anything resembling a visual cue to explain what youre doing to what. And even when you do figure out what one peice of random highlighting means, you can't get anywhere without typing MORE obscure \"shortcuts\". HOW is this better than point and click? Who in their right mind would abandon ~30 years of interface progress for this demonstrably worse navigation method?\n I WOULD say it's the worst UX I've ever seen on any utility, ever - except there literally is not UX . All you end up with, everywhere, is a nigh-on-useless bricks of text, only clumsily navigated through with MORE STUPID SHORTCUTS . How anyone could be expected to manage anything with this is beyond all of us.\n Now he expects us to bring lesson summaries to the tute every week in this incomprehensible garbage, and literally NOBODY in the class has ANY idea how to organise anything in what as far as we can tell is just a glorified notepad, or why it even exits.\n What am I missing?\n EDIT: Well, from the look of the downvotes and cope in the comments, this is going to be one of THOSE \"open source\" communities.

          "description": "tl;dr - see Question below\n Background / my setup\n So I've used a GTD-like setup in org-mode for a few years now. I'm very much still a noob.\n One thing I feel is slowing me down, particularly at weekly reveiw, is needing to duplicate project headings for tasks (or maybe I'm making a fundamental mistake in my workflow).\n For example, I'd write something like the below and need to type \"Big/Small Important Work Project\" a number of times with my big fat fingers:\n ``` ** Big Important Work Project\n *** TODO: email Amit for stats on Big Important Work Project :computer:\n *** TODO: book room on 5th floor for meeting about Big Important Work Project\n ** Small Important Work Project\n *** TODO: email Amit for stats on Small Important Work Project :computer:\n *** TODO: book room on 4th floor for meeting about Small Important Work Project\n ``` (Note, I don't actually use TODO keywords, except DONE)\n In org mode I can simply use folding to see what project the task is for, however, my reminders are either in Orgzly (agenda widget), or via tasker popups on my phone \n I therefore get tasks like \"call amit\" or \"book room\" a lot, devoid of context.\n Question:\n Is there a way the a project (X-level) heading can be inherited by its children? Maybe appended to them?\n I realise this is not nessecarily an Org, or emacs, problem but I hope I can solve it programatically in emacs.\n    submitted by    /u/thephatmaster  \n [link]   [comments]",

I've found this makes it difficult to find what I'm looking for.\n Example, I forgot how to toggle list bullets. Using the help system, I found a command called org-cycle-list-bullet . Exactly what I was looking for! Unfortunately, according to help it's not bound to anything.\n Except actually it is: when on a list, org-ctrl-c-minus (C-c -) does the magic.\n I learned that by pulling up the docs. That's fine, but can be slow, and feels against-the-grain so to speak; for this kind of stuff (eg just looking for a keybinding), I prefer to use emacs' help system.\n Any suggestions on this? Maybe I'm not using help/search to its full potential. Or maybe going to the docs is the only way?\n ​\n EDIT: I think my post wasn't very clear. Maybe this is more clear:\n Given that I know that org-cycle-list-bullet does what I want, and that it is not bound, what is the most efficient way to find that it can be used from C-c -?\n    submitted by    /u/unduly-noted  \n [link]   [comments]",

I am trying to achieve something that I was able to do in org's Block agenda tags-todo views, and I have been largely successful, except ...\n ... In agenda views generated by org's block agenda, pressing < narrows the output to the category present under the cursor - meaning, only entries for that category are visible, the rest hidden.\n When I press the same key in blocks generated by org-ql-block, I get a message: org-agenda-filter-by-category: No category at point\n The error message makes sense because the output of org-ql-block does not include the category, whereas the output of tags-todo does.\n Here is an example of output from tags-todo:\n individual-competency-fy24:STARTED [#B] Download course transcript :ATTACH:ActiveTask:\n The leading individual-competency-fy24 is not showing in org-ql-block output.\n So, is another command needed, or do I need to configure org-ql-block to output the category.

          "description": "There is a little Org issue that has been bugging me for quite long. When using Org for task management, subheadings are typically used to define tasks, often grouped under one heading that defines a project. For instance:\n * Project 1 ** TODO Task a ** TODO Task b * Project 2 ** TODO Task c \n Org folds blank lines at the end of any subtree into the latest subheading. So, when I start unfolding Project 1, Task b shows as Task b..., i.e. it seems to have some hidden description which is misleading. I always go to see what is under `Task b...` only to find its empty.\n A compromise is to set org-cycle-separator-lines to 1. However, this prevents the user from writing descriptions that are well spaced, as this will introduce unwanted blank lines in the folded view. For example:\n * Project 1 ** TODO Task a - [ ] Subtask - [ ] Subtask ** TODO Task b \n The above code shows as:\n * Project 1 ** TODO Task a... ** TODO Task b \n ​\n    submitted by    /u/Desperate_Donut_7527  \n [link]   [comments]",

Out of the box, my configuration doesn't seem to be doing very well -- indentation is erratic (sometimes thrown off by JSX), no lsp-rename, and generally things are slow.\n Are there any generally recommended approaches for React development with Emacs? Language server, minor modes, tree-sitter, etc? There seem to be a lot of options and modes available.\n The codebase is currently JavaScript and JSX, but I'm considering Typescript and TSX down the line. Should I just default to the TypeScript tooling?\n    submitted by    /u/dwrz  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi guys, sometimes I try something new to compare with already used packages, this weekend I wanted to try Eglot, however, I ran into a number of problems. One of them is autocomplete.\n For example, when I write in vue, I want to autocomplete a watch function. This function is available in the following packages\n import { watch } from 'vue'; import { watch } from 'fs'; import { watch } from 'fs/promises' ... etc \n But when I use autocomplete in eglot I only see the first candidate - importing from the fs package. Is there any possibility or workaround to display all possible candidates?\n Example of autocomplete with eglot\n https://preview.redd.it/tlgtg5imw43c1.jpg?width=2930&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7f0cd2ff1b6733ec26021b77b6e5e392f26921df\n Example of autocomplete with lsp-mode\n https://preview.redd.it/rcntp2vow43c1.jpg?width=1224&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a246d790c47b4d48a3fba5e5f1cb361841eccc02\n ​\n I also know that lsp-mode in conjunction with corfu has a similar problem, but it is impossible to solve it there as the authors of both packages think that the problem is not on their side 😅 Is the situation with eglot the same?\n    submitted by    /u/darkawower  \n [link]   [comments]",

That makes sense, there's a slow network call somewhere in the works that's gumming things up.\n I'm using eglot for lsp and would expect that would be the source of a slow jsonrpc call, maybe eglot trying to get completion candidates on every keystroke through the LSP server?

          "description": "Hello fellow Emacs enthusiasts,\n I'm reaching out to see if there's anyone here who's successfully integrated a modern development environment within Emacs for Python programming. Specifically, I'm interested in a setup that incorporates eglot, tree-sitter and company.\n I've encountered a significant issue: whenever I enable python-ts-mode, Emacs consumes all my system's memory and crashes. While I've managed to use a more basic setup that limits tree-sitter to syntax highlighting only, I can't shake the feeling that I'm missing out on some great functionality.\n To help with investigation:\n  \nI am running on a Mac\n The bare minimum to reproduce this problem is on the following gist: https://gist.github.com/hnarayanan/a6397d6723fce19e2802d4305071e611\n I happen to use Emacs from MacPorts, but to double-check, I also attempted to download it from https://emacsformacosx.com and it crashed in the same way\n This seems to happen independent of the language server used in the backend. I intend on using python-lsp-server, but it fails even if I don't have it installed.\n  \nHas anyone faced a similar problem and found a solution? Perhaps I am doing something very wrong with my config? I'm eager to learn from your experiences and would greatly appreciate any advice or tips you can offer.\n Thank you!\n ⚠️Edit⚠️\n This appears to be something inherently broken with tree-sitter as installed by MacPorts (or the particular language grammar for Python). I decided to dig into this and built both tree-sitter and Emacs from scratch, and they work really well together without my memory problems.\n    submitted by    /u/copingbear  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi,\n I am not sure if many people are using alerts for the appointments, I do, I like the behavior where it brings Emacs to the front and shows a message in the mini buffer. However, when I am quickly writing in another application I sometimes end up writing in the active buffer. I am contemplating creating a function which puts the buffer in read only mode before showing switching to Emacs, if it was not already Read Only, and restores it when the reminder disappears. That should be enough to avoid accidental writing.\n Before I embark in that task I would like to know if anybody has done anything like that, or any other creative ideas to avoid contaminating the current buffer.\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/maufdez  \n [link]   [comments]",

Monaspace has a similar feature that it calls \"texture healing.\" Characters are moved around slightly, or swapped out for a slightly larger or smaller character to even out the spacing, for example, when a wide character like an 'm' is followed by a narrow character like an 'l'. \n The effect looks nice on their web sites. It worked in VSCode, but not in Emacs. The \"smart kerning\" / \"texture healing\" features did not seem to be activated when I tried the fonts in Emacs. \n How would I get this to work in Emacs? The Monaspace docs say you have to add \"'calt'\" to \"editor.ligatures\" in the VSCode Settings. Commit Mono just worked without changing the settings.\n I might end up hating the moving around, but I'd have to try it for a few hours to see.

          "description": "Hello r/emacs! First-time poster here!\n I recently wanted to visualise some data in org-mode using a Python source block to generate an image, which was then rendered directly in the buffer.\n It took my a couple of goes to work out how to do it. \n Given some data like this:\n ```org\n +begin_src bash :results output file :file data.njson\n echo '{\"name\": \"Spock\", \"editor\": \"Emacs\"} {\"name\": \"James Kirk\", \"editor\": \"Vim\"} {\"name\": \"Dr McCoy\", \"editor\": \"Vim\"} {\"name\": \"Scotty\", \"editor\": \"Emacs\"} {\"name\": \"Worf\", \"editor\": \"ed\"} {\"name\": \"Geordi LaForge\", \"editor\": \"Emacs\"} {\"name\": \"Data\", \"editor\": \"Emacs\"} {\"name\": \"Jean-luc Picard\", \"editor\": \"VS Code\"} {\"name\": \"Wesley Crusher\", \"editor\": \"VS Code\"} {\"name\": \"William Riker\", \"editor\": \"Vim\"} '\n +end_src\n ```\n A visualisation can be rendered as follows:\n ```org\n +begin_src python :results output file :file usage.png\n import pandas as pd import seaborn as sns import sys\n df = pd.read_json(\"data.njson\", lines=True) axes = sns.histplot(df, x=\"editor\") axes.get_figure().savefig(sys.stdout.buffer)\n +end_src\n ```\n The main trick here is to set the :results output file header argument to write the output to a file, and to save the figure to sys.stdout.buffer from Python.\n I've written about this on my blog too, where you can see the [unsurprising] results of the analysis!\n    submitted by    /u/akuszyk  \n [link]   [comments]",

I feel I'm missing something very basic here.\n I was using org-roam today in doom emacs and forgot how irritating adding a new node is while writing. \n It nestles nicely up to the text before it - with no space in between. After posting on r/orgroam a kind soul told me this might be a wider issue - at least related to org itself, and maybe doom.\n Does anyone know how to get a leading space before the node name / link? For example; my nodes come out looking like:\n something interesting is in thisNODENAME/LINK check it out\n For the love of RMS I want a space between this and NODENAME\n I'm clearly being dumb, but can't figure this out. Surely enough people use emacs / doom emacs / org mode, and they are not all adding links everywhere with no leading space?\n A suggestion on r/orgroam was put a double space before a link - is that it?\n    submitted by    /u/thephatmaster  \n [link]   [comments]",

Try it out !!!\n (I am using evil, but you can easily bind the keys with :\n (define-key dired-mode-map .... )\n code:\n ​\n (defun my/dired-jump (event)\n (interactive \"e\")\n (mouse-drag-region event)\n (dired-find-file))\n ​\n (defun my/dired-jump-close ()\n (interactive)\n (kill-current-buffer))\n ​\n (evil-global-set-key 'normal (kbd \"<mouse-3>\") 'my/dired-jump-close)\n ​\n (evil-define-key '(normal visual motion emacs) dired-mode-map\n (kbd \"<down-mouse-1>\") 'my/dired-jump)\n EDIT: CHECK OUT THIS DEMO\n https://imgur.com/a/G6K8JKO\n ​\n    submitted by    /u/schwanzuslongus23  \n [link]   [comments]",

A good option would be to fold the output when there are multiple matches, then I can use the Tab keep to expand the fold and scan through the previews and even edit them right away.\n \nThe search panel is modal. It doesn't create a result buffer which you can save and then return to later to continue to select files to edit. Once you lose focus it is gone. It doesn't even seem to retain the search term so you can use it later.\n \nIt would be nice to have a window that shows the actual CLI command passed to the search utility.

          "description": "Aside from new language sources that the community can contribute at any time, this package feels more or less feature complete now.\n v1.0.0 on GitHub\n For those who don't know, treesit-auto enables automatic detection, installation, and usage of tree-sitter grammars and modes in Emacs 29+. Vanilla Emacs exposes some variables and functions that facilitate this behavior, but without treesit-auto it's up to you to check when tree-sitter is available and configure how Emacs behaves when it is (or isn't). This package takes that work away from you and is designed to fit what the vast majority of users would expect from automatic use of tree-sitter in Emacs.\n This started out as just my own configuration to treesit-language-source-alist, major-mode-remap-alist, and auto-mode-alist, but now has a lot of features that didn't exist just under a year ago when I first announced it.\n  \nAutomatic detection and installation for built-in tree-sitter modes, such as rust-ts-mode, yaml-ts-mode, toml-ts-mode, typescript-ts-mode, and go-ts-mode. You can get this behavior through the treesit-auto-add-to-auto-mode-alist function (the name is too long...I know)\n Less buggy behavior overall, such as ensuring we switch to the tree-sitter mode after installing it\n Detecting and installing grammars required by the current mode, such as TypeScript and TSX requiring each other\n  \nThis package isn't perfect. It's honestly still a bit of a hack, and many parts of the code are too clever for my own liking. It does its job, though, and I've been a happy, daily user of it for the last 9 months or so.

Throughout that time there have been periods where I really leaned in to it and tried to use it for everything, and there have been periods where I only used it for org and/or magit, etc. I've learned lots of things about it and I've forgotten lots of things about it, but I've never been what I would call an \"expert\" or even a \"power user\". So, when I feel like something isn't working well in Emacs, I almost always default to the assumption that I'm doing something wrong or misunderstanding something, etc. \n So, it very well may be that I'm wrong/crazy in my recent conclusion that use-package might not be the ideal abstraction for managing Emacs packages.\n With that out of the way, I'll say that when I first saw use-packag…",

          "description": "Good morning,\n I recently have become enamored of Typst for document creation. It's fast, it's approachable, it's cross platform, and it's extremely capable even in preview beta. I never really got the swing of LaTeX with all the backslash/curlybrace mayhem. \n In any event, I find myself actually working on a long technical document in Typst in Emacs. There does exist typst-ts-mode so thanks tree-sitter and all those people who manage the grammar libraries for it. However I'm finding myself in need of a better way of navigating the huge document to get to sections I want to do.\n I looked into the baked-in bookmarks and I could probably use that capability, though I was hoping for more of an customizeable outline mode. Manually setting the bookmarks for an entire document seems tedious. I mainly just want to navigate by headings and that would be sufficient.\n What do people use for this sort of thing (possibly in the LaTeX world?) Just bookmarks with some sort of automated way of populating the bookmarks? I did check the typst-ts-mode and while there are some functions there for compiling, there don't seem to be any functions for navigating by semantic structures. Perhaps that's baked into tree-sitter itself?\n Anyhow, any help greatly appreciated here.\n    submitted by    /u/remillard  \n [link]   [comments]",

But this isnt working:\n (map! :after evil :n \"s\" 'avy-goto-char-2)\n I have similiar syntax with other binds and they work. I added \":after evil\" since that was a suggestion in another reddit thread i found\n Another binding i want to add is to make \"C-d\" act as \"C-d-z-z\" (I want to have the current functionality of vim/emacs, but center the text when i scroll) Any ideas on how i can achieve this?\n    submitted by    /u/NGB_UF  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I have been using Magit and Forge for several years, mainly with projects on self-hosted Gitlab instances. The experience has been great!\n One of the nice things that Forge did for me was showing the numbers of merge requests (in !123 form) in my magit-log views. Some time ago, however, this stopped working. Actually, this stopped working quite some time ago, maybe a year or more. I was too lazy to report it and too busy to investigate. IIRC it didn't stop working right away for all repos, so I guess it is not related to e.g. upgrading to Emacs 28 (and it was definitely before I upgraded to Emacs 29.1). \n To investigate this in more detail, I created new clones of several projects, but that didn't change anything. I also tried a simplified Emacs config in a new home directory to make sure that Forge's database was created from scratch. Same problem persists. \n On Forge's Github pages, I found some references to interactions of Forge with bug-reference-mode, so maybe it somehow has to do with that? On the other hand, given that I used a fresh Emacs config + new clones, I guess this isn't the cause of the issue either. \n Does anyone know how to get the MR numbers back in Magit's log view?\n    submitted by    /u/ph0t0nix  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "When I run emacs -nw (Emacs 29.1) in an iterm2 window on a MacBook Pro, it does a decent job of rendering the theme colors. But if in the same window (outside of emacs) I ssh to a server (that has an identical init.el) and run the same, the colors are way off. I'm looking for advice (beyond \"use TRAMP\") for how to get better theme colors over ssh.\n In both cases the value of $TERM is xterm-256color. The output of msgcat --color=test is the same in both shells. But in emacs the output of M-x list-color-display is quite different in the two cases: in the local window there are 556 colors with many descriptive names, but in the ssh context there are 256 colors with limited names (color-NNN for NNN in 16 through 255).\n    submitted by    /u/fredy  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hej fellows,\n the title already is quite specific, so I'll just try to explain a bit more.\n I use `text-mode-hook` to activate `darkroom-mode` when I am in an org-mode buffer. This approach works quite alright, but I am struggling to make it work with another recent addition to my workflow, `desktop.el`.\n I want to use `desktop` to save opened files, window and tab bar configurations. After some tinkering this also works out fine, however, when I use `desktop-read` on a constellation that contains org-mode buffers, it seems like darkroom-mode is applied twice, i.e. the font is even bigger than with normal `darkroom-mode` applied.\n I have tried to use `desktop-after-read-hook` to re-initialize `darkroom-mode`:\n ```\n (defun or/re-initialize-darkroom ()\n (progn\n (darkroom-mode -1)\n (darkroom-mode +1)))\n ```\n However, this does not seem to work, because the text still is oversized. If it were only for one tab or buffer where this is the case, I'd swallow that pill. However, it is the case in all org buffers, which is a tad too annoying with four tabs containing four different org files.\n Thus, I'd love to hear about your experiences, maybe you've got a tip or two for me?\n Have a good day!\n    submitted by    /u/olivuser  \n [link]   [comments]",

It is my favorite terminal emulator of the bunch (yes even over vterm) and has actually improved my workflow. It does not need an external C library to be downloaded and in my opinion has the best keybindings of any terminal emulator I have tried. It has 3 main modes to cycle between:\n  \nInput Mode (C-c C-e) = similar to vterm's copy mode the buffer becomes \"frozen\" for you to copy the text and scroll back and basically use all of emacs's nifty search features.\n Char Mode (C-c M-d) = One of my favorite modes where basically every input you make short of the keys C-M-m or M-RET will be sent to the terminal. This means I can open vim/nano/emacs -nw all within the terminal buffer (which I do a lot as I ssh into machines regulary) and it works absolutely perfectly. \n Semi-Char Mode: The default mode where most inputs will be sent to the terminal. This mode does 90% of the job but if sometimes you have a weird mix of alt and control input combinations to send then the Char Mode is there for you.\n  \nJust wanted to bring more attention to this pacakage and would recommend others to try it a bit.\n Thank you /u/AkibAzmain for creating and maintaining this package.\n https://codeberg.org/akib/emacs-eat\n    submitted by    /u/JoeKazama  \n [link]   [comments]",

The problem is that when I start R, it starts with version 3.6.1, which obviously is a big problem for me. I figure there's got to be some dot-file, environment variable, or something that points to the R interpreter which I can change, but I've had no luck in finding this documented. Can someone help?\n ​\n    submitted by    /u/BullCityPicker  \n [link]   [comments]",

This works well when I am cloning it in linux machines but when I clone it in windows machines, it doesn’t work.\n I have removed all the .elc files since those are not cross compatible but it still didn’t work and I realise that it’s because the generated autoload file is specified to be using unix style line endings (LF) but when I cloned it in the windows machine, the autoload files will have dos style line endings (CRLF) therefore causing the issue.\n Interestingly, the init file also uses CRLF and it still works presumably because it does not have the same specified coding as the generated autoload files.\n How should I get around this problem? I’m thinking of setting core.autocrlf to false on my windows machine. While that works, I will have to remember to create new files in my .emacs.d with only LF to keep the git repo clean and also presumably for it to work. I also thought about regenerating those autoloads after a clone but I’m not sure how to do so. Hence, I’m looking to see whether others have better solutions to this problem.\n Edit: I realise I can set core.autocrlf to input so that git will automatically convert any CRLF to LF on commit therefore resolving the issue.

          "description": "There is a little Org issue that has been bugging me for quite long. When using Org for task management, subheadings are typically used to define tasks, often grouped under one heading that defines a project. For instance:\n * Project 1 ** TODO Task a ** TODO Task b * Project 2 ** TODO Task c \n Org folds blank lines at the end of any subtree into the latest subheading. So, when I start unfolding Project 1, Task b shows as Task b..., i.e. it seems to have some hidden description which is misleading. I always go to see what is under Task b... only to find its empty.\n A compromise is to set org-cycle-separator-lines to 1. However, this prevents the user from writing descriptions that are well spaced, as this will introduce unwanted blank lines in the folded view. For example:\n * Project 1 ** TODO Task a - [ ] Subtask - [ ] Subtask ** TODO Task b \n The above code shows as:\n * Project 1 ** TODO Task a... ** TODO Task b \n Any better solutions?\n    submitted by    /u/Desperate_Donut_7527  \n [link]   [comments]",

For whatever reason, feeling some order in the midst to the chaos, seemed out of my grasp without spending a lot of time figuring things out. So, I thought to myself, \"What if I just started over, and tried out folgezettel even though I think @Sascha has convinced me it shouldn't be necessary?\"\nWell, I have to report early that, while I feel like someone that should be able to workout without the need for a personal trainer, I like the personal trainer... a lot.\nI don't know what it is! But, there is something about the id's and just needing to loosely relate one to the next one that helps to create focus and clarity.\nI'm sorry for this moment, leaving: 20231125055521 -- At least for now. Maybe one day, I'll be able to exercise without a personal trainer. But, today, I'm just happy I'm working out.",

It's basically line-by-line code execution to test algorithms and poke around things:\n\nThe top part is the actual script editing part and filled with a placeholder comment. Nothing to see there yet.\nSo here's a verified rumor -- the scripting language will be JavaScript by default. Reason for that is the excellent and secure environment Apple provides out of the box.
