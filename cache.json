          "description": "A few years ago I discovered Rust and I wanted to learn it. But I struggled until I learned that Rust is highly influenced by functional programing languages.\n I became curious about FP, but I struggled again. This time I struggled to find a good language. My first choice was Elm, but it is limited to the browser and needs things like nodejs and maybe even interop with JavaScript (I don't like JS).\n Another option was F#, but the compiler is horribly slow (I explain it in a moment).\n Also an option was Gleam, but this lacks good documentation and I wasn't able to install the compiler.\n I decided to reactivate my old Samsung N150 Netbook from 2010 and installed Endeavour OS (based on Arch Linux) with i3 as window manager. I like to minimize myself sometimes and nothing is better to use a computer that isn't able to play YouTube videos. Using a browser is possible, but not fun. This is one of the reasons I don't choose Elm.\n I also installed the .NET Toolchain, but the compiler is horribly slow on the N150 and the editor of choice, helix, has no support for F#, so I decided to ditch this too.\n Other languages on my list are Python and Julia, but they are not really helpful to learn FP.\n Finally I tried Haskell. Helix has good support, the LSP works well and the Compiler has an acceptable oerformance. Haskell is a general purpose language, pure functional, well documented and mature. Also I have a few ebooks about Haskell I can read on the N150 without the need for a browser. I don't even need internet connection, except I need to install something.\n So this is it, a short story of a long journey. Finally I'm going to learn Haskell. Or is it?\n No, maybe I come back to Elm and F# later, but now I will focus on THE pure functional language, Haskell.\n    submitted by    /u/Voxelman  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have almost two years of work experience as a backend programmer for Amazon working on Java code, but I was pretty bad at it. I was never able to learn that codebase that I worked on (for every task I needed to ask a more experienced engineer to point me to where in the codebase the particular code change needed to be made). I'm hoping that I will have a little bit of an easier time learning a Haskell codebase once I master the programming language (but I will definitely need to set up and use a debugger to learn said codebase because just reading code without running it line-by-line doesn't do anything for me). Haskell isn't too difficult for me because I programmed in Scala in my spare time for a couple years, so I'm familiar with the basic functional programming concepts like Monads and such. Sometimes I get confused when people go too deep into category theory and functional programming (like I don't know what is a Kleisli or a Bimonad). My biggest hurdle is just getting to the point where I am independent and useful, so I could use a mentor. Please comment or message me if you know of a codebase I should work on and would be willing to mentor me.\n    submitted by    /u/John-The-Bomb-2  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Over the years there's been several attempts to build systems providing templates for new Haskell projects: Stack has had templates for a long time, but as far as I can tell/remember, they're in a state of flux or were being deprecated in favour of something new; summoner(-tui) is excellent but doesn't seem to have been updated for a while and baulks at asking it to use newer GHCs. These are the only projects I've used, I'm probably missing many others.\n So what are the options these days? I don't tend to use stack any more as Cabal seems to offer most of the advantages it used to provide exclusively, and is more compatible.\n Off the top of my head, features I'd like to see are: either a way to add in \"features\" (choose a database library, web server/API library, custom prelude, etc.), or a rich ecosystem of common combinations of libraries, much like Stack does/used to.\n    submitted by    /u/Axman6  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I'm modelling a particular domain which has entities which can relate to each other:\n haskell type EID = Integer data Entity = Distribution EID | Organisation EID | Site EID \n This is how I'd initially consider declaring them as a data type. There are some hierarchical relationships I can declare:\n  \na distribution can own an organisation\n an organisation can own a site\n an organisation can own a distribution\n  \n(Sidenote: I don't want cycles in this graph, so an organisation cannot be a member of a distribution it owns. More strongly than that, in fact, organisations which own a distribution cannot be members of another distribution at all.)\n One way I could think of modelling these relations is with a simple function definition:\n haskell isMemberOf :: Entity -> Entity -> IO Bool isMemberOf (Distribution a) (Distribution b) = return False isMemberOf (Distribution a) (Organisation b) = -- do some lookup isMemberOf (Distribution a) (Site b) = return False isMemberOf (Organisation a) (Distribution b) = -- do some lookup isMemberOf (Organisation a) (Organisation b) = return False isMemberOf (Organisation a) (Site b) = return False isMemberOf (Site a) (Distribution b) = return False isMemberOf (Site a) (Organisation b) = -- do some lookup isMemberOf (Site a) (Site b) = return False \n This could be made more concise, but I'm being very explicit for the sake of clarity.\n The problem with this approach is that it doesn't tell you what the possible relations are at type level and therefore at compile time. Instead, you'll find out you made a mistake when asking \n (a :: Site) `isMemberOf` (b :: Site) \n at runtime, because you'll get False (wrapped in IO).\n Is there a nicer way to model this sort of graph of related entities which have specific rules about what types of entities are allowed to relate and how?\n    submitted by    /u/gtf21  \n [link]   [comments]",

As my functional programming exam looms I have reflected on my experience with Haskell.\n I unfortunately had a different expectation to what the module became. I picked the Advanced Functional Programming module voluntarily on the basis it would entail some quirky and interesting approaches to programming and may open doors to different careers. I in fact picked it over a C++ module.\n I fear I chose wrong as all I encountered was 'gotcha' solutions to baffling problems, and the headache of understanding the >>= and (*) functions in monadic programming. I, perhaps naively, expected Haskell to be very maths-oriented and provide capability in fintech. Instead I read now that Haskell's popularity lessens yearly and I wish I took C++ for a more applicable programming language understanding.\n Perhaps it is just my ineptitude however at times I am presented with sample problems, and when the solution is presented it is alien and completely unanticipated. For example, recreating basic games like sudoku within Haskell's constraints.\n Does anyone have any opinions on what Haskell can service in the industry? I'd like to see the silver lining of taking this otherwise awkward module.\n    submitted by    /u/qualitycancer  \n [link]   [comments]",

The workaround was to do stack new, go into that directory and add whatever packages to the package.yaml, then whatever extra-deps were necessary in that stack.yaml, then do my *.hs files at my leisure, ignoring the project skeleton from then on.\n What I had been doing (per some tutorial) was creating a minimal stack.yaml in a desired directory\n resolver: lts-19.8 packages: [] extra-deps: [] \n then run stack setup, then, in my latest case\n stack build Chart-diagrams hmatrix hmatrix-gsl hmatrix-gsl-stats \n then, upon failures, add the suggested lines to the extra-deps section of the stack.yaml. This seemed to work for me before, i.e., I could go to that directory, start up ghci and it would indeed be that 9.0.2 ghci... But then just lately I couldn't get the hmatrix stuff found. So is this method I just described actually creating a whole separate Haskell system in this directory? Or is it just doing something to my global ~/.stack/global-project/... ? In general, I really just want to do *.hs files (or org-mode files) along with a ghci. Can I just add packages to the global and have them be seen? In this hmatrix case, it was bombing.

Say I have something like this:\n TopMenuOption1 >TopMenuOption2< TopMenuOption3 SubMenuOption1 >SubMenuOption2< SubMenuOption3 SubSubMenuOption1 >SubSubMenuOption2< SubSubMenuOption3 \n Would I then need to check for every \"cell\" in [TopMenuOption1 .. SubSubMenuOption3] whether it is display of not, according to some global state? Is there a best practice to do this?\n 2) How would you handle animation? This is just a nice to have, but at least some fading-in/out would be great.\n 3) Assuming that I only develop in the frontend part of the obelisk project, then the dynamic stuff of the web app will happen in the clients' browser, resulting in a very low server load, right?\n  \nEdit 1: https://buildmedia.readthedocs.org/media/pdf/reflex-frp/latest/reflex-frp.pdf#section.2.1 is a great resource for how to build a reflex app!\n    submitted by    /u/WieseligerWurmWerfer  \n [link]   [comments]",

There are too many, and folks who know where they are get burned out reposting them. There have been many attempts to gather them, https://haskell.org/documentation being the most obvious, but none of them have fully succeeded. We could really do with some more systematic, scalable (crowd-sourced, lightweight) approach.\n  \nThen I experimented and set up https://haskell-links.org . This is version 1, providing:\n  \nA searchable read-only view of the Haskell links collected with lambdabot, the popular #haskell IRC bot.\n \nA redirector/link shortener/memory aid, for jumping to any of these links via their short ID. Eg: \n https://haskell-links.org/doc https://haskell-links.org/books https://haskell-links.org/ghc-guide\n \nCollected links to other Haskell search tools, making this a fast way to get to anywhere in Haskelldom.\n \n After contemplation and discussion on #haskell, I believe version 2 should allow web editing and use its own database. But I wanted to share this one as it's a nice simple setup. I hope you might find useful ! Help is welcome, see README.\n Best, -Simon\n    submitted by    /u/simonmic  \n [link]   [comments]",

As a step I tried to follow along with the official tutorial for client side (in Go, as my clients will be that - though it doesn't matter) and try matching server side with Haskell. So, for now I have this proto file (it might be important that eventually, I will need to use proto3):\n // The greeting service definition. service Greeter { // Sends a greeting rpc SayHello (HelloRequest) returns (HelloReply) {} } // The request message containing the user's name. message HelloRequest { string name = 1; } // The response message containing the greetings message HelloReply { string message = 1; } \n Using proto-lens I can generate nice lenses for HelloRequest and HelloReply by following this. However, it is not useful much. I would have to write a lot of boiler-plate for implementing SayHello.\n Therefore, my next best bet was proto3-suite (is that the right one?) Generating the code works nicely:\n stack exec -- compile-proto-file --proto proto/helloworld.proto --out lib \n Which will give me a very promising Proto.Helloworld with data Greeter = ..., but I simply cannot use it (with stack)..\n It seems that that repo is maybe outdated as the resolver is fairly old, and regardless there are always version conflicts.\n What is the way to go for gRPC with Haskell nowadays?

I'm looking mostly for experience, so money is not a big issue (as long as I can survive on it). I would appreciate any tips of where to look for the internships and if you know about any/work for companies that offer them I would greatly appreciate any links/contact informations. I can provide my cv and linked in if that would help. Thanks in advance ;)\n    submitted by    /u/Sielsky  \n [link]   [comments]",

My Idea is to use Haskell-Functions and Variables to have less work and reduce errors. \n ​\n I've read about tagless interpreters but I find it hard to convert a string into such an expression and I only saw that here: https://okmij.org/ftp/tagless-final/TypeCheck.hs\n ​\n That is quite old, so maybe there is a better way of doing it or a library, that is useful for that.\n ​\n I've also read Stitch from Richard A. Eisenberg https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3406088.3409015\n and I liked it very much. In this approach there is also a lot of work to do.\n ​\n I've found very short ways of evaluating typed ASTs here: https://gergo.erdi.hu/blog/2015-02-05-typed_embedding_of_stlc_into_haskell/ and here: https://github.com/shayan-najd/MiniFeldspar/blob/master/Philip/GADT.hs . But there is still a lot working in the conversion from simple ASTs or Strings to these expressions.\n ​\n Is there a even better and simpler way to do that, if the goal is to let Haskell to a lot of work and focus on features that I want to include in my language.\n ​\n Thank you very much for your answers.\n    submitted by    /u/rbrucesp  \n [link]   [comments]",

Meanwhile I always liked the concept of functional programming and I am remembering and learning more about it, but it is very important that I also do some projects to get more experience.\n I tried googling but I mostly just found books online, which I am already starting to read since I just finished looking through my university notes, but I want to get practical even if it's more simple things.\n So, any ideas on what would be interesting to work on?\n Any tips and advice are extremely welcome.\n    submitted by    /u/decubalNL  \n [link]   [comments]",

For some new features and improvements they want to make, they'll need a dedicated Haskell full-stack developer, for a fixed, one-year term only, based in NYC but otherwise remote-friendly.\n The position pays up to $75k based on experience and comes with full union healthcare. The ideal candidate is someone who has Haskell experience and who is interested in left politics.\n For more information, for questions, and to apply, see the posting here: https://jacobinmag.com/2022/05/jacobin-is-looking-for-a-programming-fellow/\n I have no affiliation; just sharing here to help out friends.

I'm not very close to Scala since the split between 2 and 3, so I'm sorry if those are some standard questions that everyone asks, but I wasn't able to find any meaningful answers for them.\n  \nAre there any plans for introducing nullable types in Scala3? I mean e.g.\n  \n val s: String = null \n This should not compile (with Nullable Types). I saw some forks of dotty that introduce this feature, but is there some kind of official statement of the devs about it? I'm sure someone has already talked about this stuff, as it's very popular today.\n  \nAs for Scala3 syntax, I know that when it has been introduced the blog posts were stating that nobody will force the new syntax on anyone. Has this changed? Some time has passed after introducing the new syntax, is it possible to state which one is more popular today for Scala3 code? Will \"old\" syntax be deprecated one day?\n  \nThanks for any answers.\n    submitted by    /u/suitable_character  \n [link]   [comments]",

For reference, I spend most of my regular time developing Lambdas and State Machines for a fitness application at work that uses TypeScript, to give some frame of reference.\n    submitted by    /u/TheRealKingofmice  \n [link]   [comments]",

Now for my question, I am a data engineer and have been to a couple of jobs where scala developers show this attitude about python as it is some sort of easy shallow langage. I just wanted to understand if this is a general trend in the industry that I must get used to. I get how scala can be smarter and more mathy etc. which is cool but what's with attitude ? Now with python becoming more and more popular, I have a hard time understanding where these people are‍ coming from... just a thought nothing personal\n    submitted by    /u/gloriagaseous  \n [link]   [comments]",

As far as I know, implementing green threads for Java today is made by changing the JVM. Meanwhile, in Scala and before Project Loom:\n from Cats Effects: Concurrency in IO is facilitated by fibers, which are lightweight, interruptible threads that are managed completely by the runtime.\n from ZIO: Powered by highly-scalable, non-blocking fibers that never waste or leak resources\n Well... how? JVM threads are backed by OS threads. Is the Scala compiler inserting context switch here and there in Cats/Monix code? do Scala language construct allow to create green-threads? Kotlin gets coroutines in the compiler, but Cats/Monix are libraries, not compilers. Or Scala libraries can alter the way the compiler work?\n I'm curious...\n    submitted by    /u/pgris  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello everyone ! First time posting, be nice with me please ;) \n Recently, I discovered org-attach, which allows to link files to org mode headlines. \n Moreover, the folders created to store these files respect a particular rule, which is the following: \n When you create a healine <-> file \"link\" with org-attach, a data folder will be created (if it isn't already). A uuid is given to the headline. Finally, a subfolder is created automatically in data with the following method: \n data/two first number of the uuid/ the rest of the number/ the files attached to a headline are here\n ​\n So here are my two questions, which follows from my question in the title: \n - can we store folders, not just files? I did the test, and it seems to work by manually inserting the folder (by testing the insertion of a link from a folder to an attachment for example). I guess there must be good reasons why it doesn't work... but why?\n - did you change the properties of the creation and storage in the data folder ?\n ​\n I find this system almost revolutionary with the use of org roam for example. This system could allow to detach from a classical storage system (folder of folder etc, forming a search tree) which forces the user to have two \"kind of storage\": one for resources (pdf, png, git project, etc) and one for notes (org roam here, but same for org). This would allow to link the two systems. What do you think about it?\n ​\n Thanks you in advance for your answers :)\n    submitted by    /u/Cletip  \n [link]   [comments]",

But the problems is that it syncs only between 1 file and 1 google account. I have one google account but I scatter my todos inside different files for different projects.

In particular, eMacs is a powerful way to edit it. \n Where I’m lost though is three major ways. \n How do I organize the data in terms of structure? Not like from a technical perspective but from an organizational one? I know different people will have different systems, but this is a little too much rope. Can anyone suggest a tutorial that broadly goes over how they structure their “life” (multiple types of todos. Calendar, goals, etc…) in org mode files?\n I’m also a little unclear and how to do something distributed without org mode. Do I manually have to sync files over GitHub? Can I edit my todos on my phone?\n The last major piece is integration with other apps. Can I integrate it tightly with iOS (get Siri to add something to my todo list) or get my stuff to sync with my work place google calendar?\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/FactoryReboot  \n [link]   [comments]",

I am reading through Bernt Hansen's \"Organize Your Life in Plain Text!\" document which has been extremely helpful. However it appears the document is somewhat outdated\n I'm pretty sure it hasn't been updated since 2015 (judging by the version). The screenshots are outdated. When I add the Lisp code under section 9.1 \"Clock setup\", then I go to clock in a task with \"C-c C-x C-i\", I receive the following message in the echo area:\n Symbol’s function definition is void: bh/is-task-p\n Anyways, I am just curious: does anybody know of any documents similar to this one that are more up to date? I am very grateful to Bernt Hansen for creating this document, as it's been an enormous help to me thus far. But I would just like to see if there's any other similar documents that are up to date.\n    submitted by    /u/Top-Spend-1589  \n [link]   [comments]",

I normally set my org-refile-targets as such:\n (setq org-refile-targets '((\"~/Dropbox/org/work.org\" :maxlevel . 2))) \n This works fine. So I tried to do the same in my org-capture templates. Here’s an example:\n (\"n\" \"CPB Note\" entry (file+headline \"~/Dropbox/org/cpb.org\" \"Refile\") \"** Note: %? @ %U\" :empty-lines 0 :refile-targets '(((\"~/Dropbox/org/work.org\" :maxlevel . 2)))) \n With this I get the error, “org-refile-get-location: Wrong type argument: listp, quote”.

          "description": "I've been writing my dissertation in orgmode using the new citation syntax and engine. For Word export, which my committee demands for revisions, it's been working great. But I want to submit the full diss in a nice pdf, for which Latex is the best option. However, I realized today that when I try to export to a Latex file, the citation gets fully parsed. \n So from this in the orgmode buffer:\n [cite:Asit Kumar Bandyopadhyay in the Preface of@nyayaratnaBangalaBhashaBangala1991;] \n I get this in the latex buffer:\n \\footnote{Asit Kumar Bandyopadhyay in the Preface of Rāmagati Nyāẏaratna, \\textit{Bāṅgālā Bhāshā O Bāṅgālā Sāhityabishaẏaka Prastāba}, Natuna saṃskaraṇa. (Kalikātā: Suprīma Buka Ḍisṭribiuṭārsa, 1991).} \n This is great for Word but in Latex I'd rather have a \\cite command, otherwise I won't get a bibliography with a \\printbibliography command in my main.tex document.\n I took a look at the Latex export page of the org manual, but couldn't see an option to change the export.

After reading the docs and https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/uomvik/org_mode_to_latex_using_a_cls_file/ , I realized that I could just configure org mode to find the cls file by creating a new entry in my emacs config and copying the cls file inside the emacs config dir. \n But I do not want to pollute my config with this. This is a single time to use this for a single conference. \n Is it possible to configure the org file to evaluate some lisp code to add the custom cls to the org-latex-class list and set its path?

One problem I always had was that to use the mail to groups functionality (where everyone with a particular tag, e.g. :family: in my contacts.org file would get added to an email \"to\" line) I had to disable helm-mode type \"+fam\" and <tab>, and then, if I remembered, re-enable helm-mode. I didn't have to do this a lot, but it was nice when I needed it. Now with the org-contacts from 6 June 2022 this no longer works. I get an error message because instead of a string of names and emails I am getting a function. For example, #(\"Father <fatherMadeUpAddress@family.ca>, Mother <motherMadeUpAddress@family.ca\" 0 9 (face org-level-1 fontified t) 31 48 (face org-level-1 fontified t)) \n The names and addresses are in there if I could just get them out of that function. I think there is a message-tab-function I could use. Any suggestions from people who have already solved this issue, or would like to give me suggestions for how I might try?

          "description": "I am using a custom function meant to take an entry in a .org document, and put it into a node, either a new one, or one that already existed. Org-roam-refile does not work if the node you want to put the text in doesn't already exist, and org-roam-extract-subtree doesn't work if you want to put the text into a pre-existing node. \n Heavily inspired by system-crafters, what I settled on doing was initiating the org-roam-capture process to guarantee that there's a node, then using org-refile to move the entry to the target document. It looks roughly like this. \n (defun my/org-roam-gtd-reference () (interactive) (let ( (org-refile-keep nil) ;; Set this to nil to delete the original! (org-roam-capture-templates '((\"k\" \"knowledge\" plain \"%?\" :if-new (file+head+olp \"pages/${slug}.org\" \"#+title: ${title}\\n\" (\"Knowledge\"))))) (org-after-refile-insert-hook #'save-buffer) nodefile position ) (save-window-excursion (org-roam-capture \"k\") (setq nodefile (buffer-file-name)) (setq position (point))) (org-refile nil nil (list \"Knowledge\" nodefile nil position))) (org-gtd-process-inbox)) \n The problem in this function seems to be in the \n  (save-window-excursion (org-roam-capture \"k\") (setq nodefile (buffer-file-name)) (setq position (point))) \n I cannot for the life of me figure this out. But buffer-file-name is returning nil, which causes nodefile to be defined as nil, which causes the eventual org-refile command to fail. Strangely, this block works fine if it uses the org-roam-dailies-capture-today command instead of org-roam-capture. Unfortunately, that wouldn't fit my workflow, since it would capture to dailies instead of the actual nodes.\n    submitted by    /u/gravygrowinggreen  \n [link]   [comments]",

Handwritten Note taking using stylus is a big part of my workflow and I’ve found windows machines to work best for it. Not a simple task to install BSD or Linux on surface devices. Also quite a lot of windows exclusive software for my use case)\n Also, is it possible to have eMacs display the custom variable names (like smileys, and latex symbols) available in Julia?\n I’m currently using this tutorial but even that is quite inconsistent : https://youtu.be/Iagbv974GlQ (the first step at 3.49 throws a warning on my pc, stating unnecessary call to package initialize at unit. Also at 3.35, how did he clear off the entire text quickly?)\n Apart from using for Coding for Julia programs, I am also curious about learning org mode in eMacs.

Apps using OOB in testing mode will not be affected. However, we strongly recommend you to migrate them to safer methods as these apps will be immediately blocked when switching to in production status.\n Note: New OOB usage has already been disallowed since February 28, 2022. \n Below are key dates for compliance\n September 5, 2022: A user-facing warning message may be displayed to\n non-compliant OAuth requests October 3, 2022: The OOB flow is blocked for all clients and users will see\n the error page.\n  \nIn fact, I've been getting an error saying OAuth token expired. Now trying to refresh-token. Received HTTP 401 for a couple of months now, so this tracks.\n Is there anything to be done at this point? org-gcal still works for me at the moment, but I'm guessing it won't come October.

On my Windows machine, I use hunspell, which has been the same v1.7.0. I am wondering what should be changed in my setup ~/.emacs.d/init.el for the ispell in v27.2 to work. Just as an experiment, if I replace /usr/share/emacs/27.2/lisp/textmodes/ispell.[el,elc] by those of 26.3, the ispell system works under v27.2. That means that some setting in the new ispell.el has changed. My current setup in ~/.emacs.d/init.el is the following, which I copied from the posting Tutorial: spellchecking with hunspell (1.7.0) for emacs (26.2) on Windows (10) : emacs (reddit.com)\n (autoload 'ispell-message \"ispell\" \"Check spelling of mail message or news post.\") (setq ispell-program-name \"hunspell\") (setq ispell-library-directory \"C:/ProgramData/dict-en\") (setq ispell-hunspell-dict-paths-alist '((\"en_US\" \"C:/ProgramData/dict-en/en_US.aff\"))) (setq ispell-local-dictionary \"en_US\") (setq ispell-local-dictionary-alist ;; Please note the list `(\"-d\" \"en_US\")` contains ACTUAL parameters passed to hunspell ;; You could use `(\"-d\" \"en_US,en_US-med\")` to check with multiple dictionaries '((\"en_US\" \"[[:alpha:]]\" \"[^[:alpha:]]\" \"[']\" nil (\"-d\" \"en_US\") nil utf-8))) ;; the following line won't make flyspell-mode enabled by default as you might think (setq ispell-personal-dictionary \"C:/Users/me/.hunspell_en_US\") (flyspell-mode 1) ;; ispell-word for showing correcting options of the current misspelled word ;(global-set-key (kbd \"M-\\\\\") 'ispell-word \n If I use the ispell.el of v27.2, I got the error message: ispell: Can’t find Hunspell dictionary with a .aff affix file\n Thanks a lot for your help!\n    submitted by    /u/BVPs  \n [link]   [comments]",

Just did some minor tweaking, so I thought I would let reddit-ers know.\n It's a pretty simple package, but I use it all the time. It inserts grouping commas into a number near the cursor, or all numbers in a region. If invoked on a number that already has grouping commas, it removes them. So, it toggles the commas on and off. It tries to avoid things that you don't want commas on, such as dates, or numbers with leading, or identifiers. It can also work with hex, octal, and binary numbers, each with their own grouping character, normally, '_'.\n I have it bound to the keychord ',,' which makes it easy to invoke and remember.\n It's on MELPA, so give it a try.\n    submitted by    /u/lstrang  \n [link]   [comments]",

I was in similar yet different situation where I was able to use packages from the a local repo mirror and I was not allowed to install any external ones. That made me think about how I would setup and use Emacs in those environments. I separated out my config (which is a literate org file) into Vanilla Emacs Configs and External Configs. When ever I'm the afore-mentioned environments I started to comment out the ```External Configs``` heading. I've also been hacking on the vanilla configs and I was pleasantly surprised. I miss certain things like hydra, magit, yasnippet and avy but I was surprised by how far I could go with Emacs's built in functions and my Spaghettified lisp config.

I'm still new to C#, so I want to know if what I'm writing will fail to compile or not without actually having to compile it. When editing a .c file I see like a check mark in the bottom right corner when there are no errors, but when I'm editing a .cs file there is nothing and it says \"Flycheck, no checker\"\n How do I adjust the volume of Emms? When I do 'M-x emms-volume-raise' it doesn't raise the volume at all and I can lower the volume to 0% but I can still hear the music. I'm using Gentoo with Pulseaudio.

          "description": "Rust people had a similar discussion a few years back when crates.io was starting to get a lot of derelict packages. Keeping individual authority over a hosted repo is generally bad for its health and the ecosystem health.\n Add someone to your Github repo\n Settings → Collaborators & Teams → Add people / teams\n If you don't have someone in mind, look for someone or some team who maintains other packages that you use and ask them if they are too busy. If you trust them in your software delivery pipeline already because you're using their packages, you might as well trust them to not accept junk into your package. I'm adopting software lately under the Positron org, so even get a hold of me and we can make an Emacs-specific team exactly this kind of redundancy.\n There's two big reason to do this. First, more often than not, a repo with an individual authority will become an unintentional name-squatter soaking up Google traffic, filling up with forks in its network but nothing going into the original repo. It is a local black hole for ecosystem momentum. Second, you will inadvertently build teams. Instead of the unwanted pressure of being a solo maintainer, you will have the mutual encouragement from the assurance that the project is going to live, not just sit there, even if you want to take a break.\n When you neglect a package, the contributions still arrive, but they show up in forks in your Github network graph. People are making changes, but they aren't bothering to PR because they don't think anyone is listening, so they're all just pushing changes just in case. Go check your network for commits in other forks. See if your package is still the branch leader. Dust off the PR's and make sure not to look abandoned. Comment on fork commits. If you want to abandon a project, add it to an organization or add some people to the admin roles. Let people know to go elsewhere for PR's and questions. Tell someone else how your package works.\n    submitted by    /u/Psionikus  \n [link]   [comments]",

I manually ported a set of English rules, but then I started working on conversion functions to do the rest of the languages that have rulesets programatically.\n i'm by no means an expert programmer, and my regex foo is middling. i was wondering if anyone might be able to take a look and suggest how to go about doing conversion reliably?\n one of the difficulties i have is in dealing with the different ways emacs displays strings, both for its own regexes and for the ICU regex strings that are to be converted.\n in the repo, segment-regexes.el contains some manually converted rules, segment-convert.el contains some very primitive/blind converting fumbling in the dark, and the ICU-formatted rules are in .srx files in subfolders. they're formatted as XML. some explanation of the unicode properties used by ICU regexes is in segment-unicode-properties-used-by-ICU-regexes.txt\n i started doing this to reliably segment text for translation in emacs, but then thought if it got done properly it could be useful for other packages also.\n the code in the repo is very green, btw.\n PS: let's not have a stoush about double spaces ending sentences. i have read those discussion, and i'm interested in segmenting files that i have not typed out myself.\n    submitted by    /u/martianh  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "When I'm editing an Org file using Doom Emacs in insert mode and my cursor is on the line of a heading, the Tab key seems to demote the heading while Shift-Tab seems to promote the heading. On the other hand, in my personal config the Tab key in insert mode on a heading line seems to have behavior that is context dependent. For instance, if I have a single heading and nothing else in my org document the tab key seems to do nothing in insert mode. On the other hand, if I have multiple headings the tab key seems to cycle through several different heading levels, from one deeper than my previous deepest level, all the way up to the outermost level.\n In both my personal config and my Doom config, tab seems to be bound to org-cycle in insert mode. The values for the variables org-cycle-level-after-item/entry-creation and org-cycle-emulate-tab are identical for both my personal session and my doom session. I don't really understand how to dig deeper into what might be causing this discrepancy in behavior between the two different sessions of Emacs. I really like Doom's tab behavior, and would like to replicate it in my personal config. If anyone has any ideas on how I should go about understanding this better and achieving my desired config I'd appreciate it.\n    submitted by    /u/dargscisyhp  \n [link]   [comments]",

This works well, but then I have many-other-vars in the closure resulting in unnecessary saving of values and the previously small lambda function becomes quite cumbersome to view in subsequent inspections.\n I then resort to the following solution: ``` (defun make-hook (var) (lambda nil (do-something var)))\n (let ((var value) (many-other-vars other-long-value)) (add-hook 'mode-hook (make-hook var))) ```\n which then has the desired effect of having only the variable var in the closure. But this is counterproductive as now I have to define a function for each lambda I need (defeating the goal of creating anonymous functions on the fly).\n Is there a way to limit the closure to specific variables?

On my Linux desktop, which was built in 2019, I have been using native compilation since the beginning, but I just freshly compiled from source without native compilation and found no obvious performance difference at all.\n And on my new macbook with M1Pro, the performance is similar, and no obvious power consumption difference. \n Without performance differences, the only thing native compilation brings is the large usage in disk space, although in today's standard, the disk space used by native compilation is far from being significant. \n I am curious how many people are using native compilation right now.

However, I've increasingly noticed many counterexamples, where each paragraph was a single long line of text. Some platforms like GitHub seem to encourage this practice, as newlines in comments are treated as newlines in the rendered page, contrary to vanilla Markdown.\n There seem to be some advantages to this approach. For example, writing prose with mixed-pitch-mode makes a lot more sense if lines are arbitrarily long, and I find it a lot more pleasant. But if I'm sharing a document with someone else, I wonder if generally they'd be annoyed at receiving a document without wrapping that requires them to enable visual-fill-column-mode and visual-line-mode, disable hl-line-mode, etc. I know I was at first before I discovered how to make the experience feel like I was using auto-fill-mode instead.\n I'm interested to hear /r/emacs 's thoughts on this!\n    submitted by    /u/elizadev  \n [link]   [comments]",

Hydra was great, but being able to toggle switches on and off quickly was something I always wanted to be able to do, and Transient makes it a lot easier--indeed, that seems to be its raison d'etre. \n I'm going through both the very dry and obtuse manual, but also the excellent writeups posted here and on github. However, I still have two questions that don't seem to have answers.\n  \nIs there any way to display information without providing a way to act on it? One of the things about hydra was it was possible to display the state of variables (and arbitrary text) as part of the formatting. I used this to give me information on the context I was operating in, like what the root directory was, or what the peforce root was. I don't actually want to change those values, I just need to know them. What I've done in the interim is define an empty interactive function. I still get the key as a weird little prefix, but my data is displayed.\n I'm making extensive use of transient-define-suffix that takes an argument and completes from a list. The description is a lambda that reads and propertizes the saved variable (shamelessly stolen and repurposed from /u/psionikus' examples posted here). However, when I set them, the display doesn't update. I found the undocumented function (so many undocumented things!) (transient--redisplay) but it feels like I'm doing something wrong if I have to put it at the end of every one of my suffixes.\n  \nI appreciate that the documentation is getting better over time, but I still find it frustrating that I can't, say, find a list of all the keyword-value pairs. They're scattered throughout the docs, so if you don't know or don't remember what you're looking for, it's nearly impossible to find.\n That said, I'm making progress. The best way to do it seems just to do it, and hack around until you find a solution.\n    submitted by    /u/vjgoh  \n [link]   [comments]",

I know how to make an elisp macro to find a specific file or to find one from a variable, but I was wondering if there's a way to incorporate patterns and interactive prompts like %^{PROMPT} into find-file.\n For my work I have to look at a variety of a given documents in multiple languages/editions, which are broken down into sub-books and chapters. For example, reading the Iliad in both Greek and English. However, this results in directories with hundreds of files each, sometimes more, and trying to find the same chapter in a different edition is a pain. For sake of example, let's use the Bible.\n All files have been systematically assigned a file name that follows the same exact pattern. Note: Edition is used as both the subdirectory and the first part of the filename.\n ./(Edition)/(Edition)_(Book_ID)_(Chapter)_read.txt \n Let's say I'm reading Genesis Chapter 1 in Greek. It's broken down by chapter at the following directory:\n ./grcbrent/grcbrent_002_GEN_01_read.txt ./grcbrent/grcbrent_002_GEN_02_read.txt ./grcbrent/grcbrent_003_EXO_01_read.txt \n But, now I want to compare it with Genesis Chapter 1 in Latin:\n ./latVUC/latVUC_002_GEN_01_read.txt \n So, is there an easy way to program a function that, while viewing ./grcbrent/grcbrent_002_GEN_01_read.txt, I don't know, reads buffer-file-name, replaces both the directory name and the first part of the filename until the first underscore with \"%^{Edition}\"(\"./%^{Edition}/%^{Edition}_002_GEN_01_read.txt\") to produce a minibuffer like the following:\n Edition: \n and after typing latVUC [RET] does (find-file \"./latVUC/latVUC_002_GEN_01_read.txt\") ?\n TLDR\n I want to be able to jump from version a of a file to version b, i.e. (./a/a_x_y.txt to ./b/b_x_y.txt) where b is typed in the minibuffer.\n I appreciate any help in figuring this out.

Say, I have a few lines of code:\n  (goto-char beg-line-point) (backward-kill-word 1)) \n If my cursor is at the beginning of backward-... and I start jumping or killing words backward, what I expect (and have in, say, my VSCode editor) is first jump to beginning of text ((), then to the beginning of line, then to the closing parenthesis on the previous line, then to the end of ...-point (after t) - and only then to before p. But what I get in emacs is it jumps to before p in ...-point immediately on first press.\n Can I somehow reconfigure emacs' word recognition for it to jump words more accurately? Maybe configure word beginning/ending regexp to add symbols/newline to them?\n    submitted by    /u/artyhedgehog  \n [link]   [comments]",

Currently, I have to deal with manually un-reordering and realigning all the other entries to the right of the text I want to manipulate.

The code is amply commented, and package configurations are as decoupled as possile. Perfect to learn how to write elisp and how to configure some of the more commonly-used packages.\n The system is pre-configured for python and Julia programming only.\n The config uses a customised leuven theme and embraces a colourful aesthetic.\n  \nGive it a go!

So… what am I missing that adds great functionality but is more than “it does it differently, but gets pretty much the same thing done). In other words, what development since 1990 has really made an improvement?\n    submitted by    /u/JayTheBookFan  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hiya!\n I've been using doom emacs for a while now and have been mostly happy with it. I've got a bit of spare time now, and have been trying to put together an emacs config from scratch. Not sure if I'm ultimately going to stick with this config or go back to doom for regular work, but I figure it'll at least be a good learning experience.\n Anyways, I've run into some baffling behavior with the general package for key binding. Specifically, once I set a new leader key, it acts in a \"sticky\" manner eternally. So if I rebind C-SPC as a leader and \"C-SPC h\" to help-command, it works in that \"C-SPC h\" works like \"C-h\". However, any time I use this, it disables the \"h\" key for the rest of the session. Whenever I type \"h\" alone, it behaves as though I pressed \"C-SPC h\". Same with spacebar. In a fresh session, both keys will work normally until I use them once with the leader. After that, the keys are broken until I restart emacs.\n Does anyone have any idea why this is happening and what should be done to correct it? Here's the relevant part of my init.el. Also, please ignore the specific rebindings; this is just an experiment to see what can be done with general and to figure out how it works.\n  (global-unset-key (kbd \"C-SPC\")) (use-package general :config (general-create-definer krm/global-leader :global-prefix \"C-SPC\") (krm/global-leader \"h\" 'help-command \"SPC\" 'set-mark-command)) \n    submitted by    /u/eatabagofbooger  \n [link]   [comments]",

Thank you very much to everyone who's filed issues against the GitHub repository (or reached out via email). It's wonderful to know that folks appreciate this effort, and I love being able to give something back to the community.\n Now: on to the good stuff!\n Packages are available for 18.04 LTS (\"bionic\"), 20.04 LTS (\"focal\"), 21.10 (\"impish\"), and 22.04 LTS (\"jammy\").\n Emacs 28 deprecates Xft and encourages using Cairo/HarfBuzz for font rendering; this build configuration is the one that my Emacs 27 packages were already using, so there should not be any changes there.\n The big new feature in Emacs 28 is native compilation, and as you might expect, these packages enable that feature. The only exceptions are the packages for 18.04 LTS (\"bionic\"); libgccjit packages aren't available for the version of GCC that ships with 18.04 LTS.\n The only packaging-related update I have to share is that the master branch of the packaging repository now has a README with release notes. I'm going to try to move more notes about the packaging process there over time.\n Enjoy, and please let me know if you have any trouble.\n    submitted by    /u/lunarsunrise  \n [link]   [comments]",

I am phrasing it like this because I don't want to limit ideas too soon and I don't really know the words to describe it more precisely.\n The goal is to not only read a document but to make its information more accessible by - for example - highlighting and linking internally and annotating (thoughts) . But I also stumbled upon concepts like transclusion in emacs. This would allow workflows where the document is included into the annotations, instead of the other way round. \n So my question is: Do you have a work flow to share that enables you to interact wit documents and record those interactions with the help of emacs?\n Some of my documents are in pdf format, others I have converted to org format.\n    submitted by    /u/smrndmusrnm  \n [link]   [comments]",

On this first run, even after a newer version of org has been installed, emacs continues to use the old version of org packaged with emacs (from the second run onwards the newer version is used).\n Is there any way to re-load org during that first run? It ends up causing errors and warning during org-roam installation as some of the functions introduced in newer versions of org (org-roam dependencies) do not load. \n I have found this, but it seems like a very ugly solution! Any suggestions how this can be better dealt with? \n Cheers\n    submitted by    /u/mmiri-ifuru  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "So, I recently realized that the git pre-commit hook does not ensure that only the chunks in the index are part of the worktree when the pre-commit hook runs. Hence, I set out and add some git stashing to my pre-commit hook to fix that myself.\n This is what I ended up with after some google-fu:\n ```sh\n #!/bin/sh # First, stash index and work dir, keeping only the # to-be-committed changes in the working directory. old_stash=$(git rev-parse -q --verify refs/stash) git stash push -q --keep-index --include-untracked new_stash=$(git rev-parse -q --verify refs/stash) # If there were no changes (e.g., `--amend` or `--allow-empty`) # then nothing was stashed, and we should skip everything, # including the tests themselves. (Presumably the tests passed # on the previous commit, so there is no need to re-run them.) if [ \"$old_stash\" = \"$new_stash\" ]; then echo \"pre-commit script: no changes to test\" exit 0 fi # Run lints/checks/tests/... script/check st=$? echo \"got status $st\" # Restore changes git reset --hard -q git stash pop --index -q # Exit with status from test-run: nonzero prevents commit exit $st \n ```\n Now, this works fine when I use it from the git-command line, however, I run into trouble when I commit via magit. It fails with the following error:\n ```\n error: pathspec ':/' did not match any file(s) known to git < normal testing output> error: could not restore untracked files from stash The stash entry is kept in case you need it again. \n ```\n Anyone have any idea what is causing the difference between git-cli and magit here?\n    submitted by    /u/Foo-jin  \n [link]   [comments]",

Typically I will google what I am trying to do, come across some posts on reddit or stackoverflow, find some sample code (ie. This is the function I wrote and bound to this key to do x and y), and incorporate that into my own emacs config. \n Here's a simple example, say I want to figure out how to copy the full path of the current filename into the buffer so I can later make a reference to it in my org notes. If I google that, I'll see a dozen different ways to do this and they mostly all work great, but in the spirit of doing everything inside emacs I can't help but wonder... there must be a better way? I feel like there must be some repository of very useful and common elisp code \"snippets\" where I could just search for \"get current filename\" and be presented with elisp code I can immediately use, and I feel like that could all be done directly inside my current document and just inserted as a code snippet!?

And then used like so $this->propertyName. \n The issue is that when I use * to search for a symbol at point (assume my point is on the property definition, the one with $ sign) the \"symbol\" to search for is $propertyName hence things like $this->propertyName aren't going to be found in the buffer. \n I'm not sure exactly where I should look for the fix. I tried to set evil-symbol-word-search to nil which will force evil to search for \"word\" at point but that's not that great and doesn't work for variables with underscore. That's maybe could be fixed with modify-syntax-entry function but it's all looks like a wrong path to do it. \n What can I do to tell Emacs (or evil) that a \"symbol\" excludes \"$\" sign?\n Thanks\n    submitted by    /u/reliktary  \n [link]   [comments]",

(This is a crossposting from r/antinet since I am into building a paperbased ZK/AntiNet since 6 weeks as an addition to my digital workhorse).\nIf it is OK with you, I would like to hear your opinions or get some more ideas:\nMy daughter is really fascinated by my work with the paper-based Zettelkasten. Which is a no-brainer since she can't watch me working with the digital one.\nSo I thought it might be a good idea to start one with her as well when she begins elementary school this summer.\nWhat I talked about with her is:\nShe gets her own AntiNet-Box - we start with just one in A7 (5 1/8 x 7)\n\n\nEveryday when she comes from school and learned something really interesting or has a question that fascinates her, we write that down, do research, write Bib-Cards and permanent notes of what she wants to keep.\n\n\nIn the evening we show us our cards that we produced that day and install the in our boxes.\n\n\n\nThe main idea is to get her interested in capturing her knowledge and what she learned, make it tangible and usable for her.\nSo that is roughly the idea.\nHere are some questions for you:\nWhat ideas come to mind when you think about an AntiNet for Kids?\nWhat would you put in there?\nHow would you categorize it? (Scott’s System might be a bit too complicated for a kid )\nWhat system to link the cards would be helpful?\nI have no idea if that works longterm but it might be worth a try.  If she keeps to it and builds up her personal knowledge box piece by piece and Zettel by Zettel that could be really valuable some day.\nThe project should not just be a collection of Flashcards or learning cards but should teach her the philosophy of building her very own thinking and knowledge tool.\nWhat do you think?",

          "description": "This video demonstrates navigating ideas using a structure note as a reference traversing the structure without becoming lost.\nMousing around, clicking incessantly on links, constantly losing focus, and backtracking is so painful.\nA structure note is far more than a list of other notes. It places ideas in a connecting context. The value of structure is enhanced with writing. Surround the ideas with context. A structure note is not atomic, growing, and growing as idea momentum grows.\nIn this short video, I demonstrate a \"Two Window Workflow\" with the structure note on the right. I click on the links in the structure note and the target note launch in the second window. I don't lose context as the structure note remains in view. I can review and refactor either note.\nNotice that the structure note includes Grouped links and many of those links are annotated. The annotations are for context, which helps steer connectivity.\nStructure-tags as an alternative to Structure Zettels — Zettelkasten Forum",

          "description": "I've been reviewing the notes I took on a book from pre-Zettelkasten days, and more than ever, I have been struck with the reality that our brain filters information to a large degree. Pre-Zettelkasten I would copy the original quote from the book, and set up a review cycle, typically the next day, three days, one week, one month, and depending on how much I enjoyed the quote, I would review it every 3 - to 6 months after that. I would capture Journal type entry notes about how I felt about the selection, what it meant to me, and what I could learn from it, and due to the mind mapping software I used (TheBrain.com), I could link to other thoughts at will.\nIt is little wonder that I felt an instant kinship when I learned of the Zettelkasten methodology. However, I am taken aback by two things as I convert the old notes to my new Zettels. First, how journal entries often evolved, meaning my perception of what the author said changed as my knowledge of the topic increased. Second, I have often split a note into two or more Zettels to accommodate the atomic principle. My question is for those who don't keep the original quote as part of their Zettel. How often do you review the original author's quote, or do you ever?",

          "description": "Prompted by Maggie Appleton’s recent update to her post on Daily Notes Pages, I was fondly remembering a time when I had a teeny little script that appended a single line of text to a kind of log. I didn’t want to use Day One for the kind of fleeting note that might trigger something else but as likely might not. So I returned to my original thought and repurposed it to work with The Archive.\nI borrowed ideas from Better Journaling with The Archive (and BitBar). I don’t have Keyboard Maestro and I didn’t want BitBar, but the principles are absolutely sound, so I adapted them to create a single script:\n#!/bin/sh\n# Open a daily journaling note\n# Create the note if it does not exist\n\nZK_PATH=\"/Users/path/to-your-notes\"\nDAY=`date +%Y%m%d`\n\nNOTE=\"${ZK_PATH}/${DAY}${HOUR}.md\"\n\nif [[ -f \"$NOTE\" ]]; then\n    open \"thearchive://match/${DAY}\"\nelse\n    echo \"# Journal Note\" >\"${NOTE}\"\n    echo \"Date: \"`date +\"%d %B %Y %H:%M\"` >>\"${NOTE}\"\n    echo \"Tags: #journal\" >>\"${NOTE}\" \n    echo \"\" >>\"${NOTE}\"\n    open \"thearchive://match/${DAY}\"\nfi\n\nThe script runs from an Alfred workflow. The first time on any given day it creates the note and opens it. Next time, it just opens the note. And as brunoc noted, because the note has a specific tag it is easy to find all such notes and see whether there is anything there I need to act on.\nI’m pretty sure that this could be more elegant, probably by testing for the absence of the note rather than its existence. Another nicety would be to capture some input and append it to the day’s note without even opening it. The previous little script might offer a start for that. But hey, it works as intended and that’s good enough for me right now.",
