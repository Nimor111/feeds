Copilot is typically used as a high-level runtime verification framework, and supports temporal logic (LTL, PTLTL and MTL), clocks and voting algorithms.\n Copilot is being used at NASA in drone test flights. Through the NASA tool Ogma [1] (also written in Haskell), Copilot also serves as a runtime monitoring backend for NASA's Core Flight System, Robot Operating System (ROS2), and FPrime (the software framework used in the Mars Helicopter) applications.\n This release drastically increases the test coverage of copilot-core.

By defining rules in a config file, you can specify which functions to instrument based on their return type or constraint context. This gives you control over whether you want the blanket approach of targeting your application's primary monad/constraint or a more conservative approach of defining a type that explicitly indicates that it will be instrumented.\n A MonadUnliftIO instance must be available for a function to be instrumentable.

I know you can do some magic with an additional functor argument that you put in front of every field.

Surely it avoids the \"wrapping\"/\"unwrapping\" data into/out of constructors. So the abstraction and application of lambdas must be cheaper, right?\n And how much?

(losing a lot of performance or any other problem associated with this association of Rust + Haskell).\n Thanks to everyone. \n    submitted by    /u/to_ask_questions  \n [link]   [comments]",

I've been using Haskell for over 15 years now, and I believe at least some of those things would make Haskell a better language to work in. I was wondering what everyone else would love to see in Haskell - informally, without the restraints of a fully formal enhancement proposal. Shoot your ideas in the replies, I'd love to hear it. Also, let me know what you think of the article. Bear in mind this is the first such article I've written in maybe 12 years, so maybe don't rip into it too much :) It's all meant to be a little informal and inspirational rather than a fully prescriptive solution to every problem.\n    submitted by    /u/cheater00  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hey folks, \n I've been working professionally in Scala for the last year and a half and it was nothing but unrest.\n First, the Scala 3 migration started this painful event that fragments the already fragmented multi versions hassle that everyone needs to go through 2.12 / 2.13, and now 3. Have to mention, this is not only dependent on our codebase. For example, Databricks is still on 2.12, on the other hand, some new libraries are Scala 3 only, or Scala 2 support was deprecated.\n Then Akka became a non-open source, and we had to find a solution and picked the Typelevel ecosystem.\n There was another \"shock\" to the ZIO ecosystem when their leader left the project. Fortunately for us, we haven't invested in ZIO not a single hour, but this is another negative event in Scala ecosystem.\n After working for half a year with Typelevel, we wrote some services and a few internal libraries. It wasn't bad, maybe not as simple as Akka, but it worked as expected. However, it was a huge struggle for half of the team to understand this code and for some to even understand the concept.\n Then Pekko came out and we had another meeting, where 100% of the team voted against using Typelevel again.\n So, we are \"officially\" using Pekko for all our new services, which is basically the old Akka in maintenance mode. I don't see how this stack has any future.\n Now, it looks like a few experimental libraries evolve around virtual threads. My bet this is the future of Scala since they are simple yet powerful as Effect systems.\n But I hear more and more people are saying - until these are ready, there will be \"no Scala\", since the language in a rapid decline (sad, but true).\n Sharing this because I'm tired of the constant unrest in Scala, and curious what strategy your team has regarding this.\n Thanks\n    submitted by    /u/Confident_Cupcake861  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "After reading and experimenting I'm about 99% sure this just isn't possible. Basically, I was trying to lift the api version into the type system to clean up some code so that the focus of the code was on the business logic instead of determining what api version to use in a bunch of places / passing around a isV1 boolean everywhere. This does mean that the api version would need to be determined at runtime, and nothing I've tried has made it able to get the client implicitly. I thought with everything sealed and having implicit defs for both of V1/V2 that it would work, but I'm guessing type erasure / something with subtyping makes it indeterminable. I tried classtags and the aux pattern, but couldn't get it to work. This is scala 2.12 btw. I have something like this:\n sealed trait ApiVersion object ApiVersion { sealed trait V1 extends ApiVersion sealed trait V2 extends ApiVersion } sealed trait ApiClient[Version <: ApiVersion] class V1Client extends ApiClient[ApiVersion.V1] class V2Client extends ApiClient[ApiVersion.V2] object ApiClient { implicit def v1Client: ApiClient[ApiVersion.V1] = new V1Client implicit def v2Client: ApiClient[ApiVersion.V2] = new V2Client } abstract class WrapperDomainObject { type Version <: ApiVersion } object WrapperDomainObject { def apply(thing: ApiThing) = if (/* some business logic */) new WrapperDomainObject { override type Version = ApiVersion.V1 } else new WrapperDomainObject { override type Version = ApiVersion.V2 } } class Service { def serviceFn(thing: WrappedDomainObject)(implicit client: ApiClient[thing.Version]) = client.doBusinessThing } \n Is this possible?\n    submitted by    /u/kaitos  \n [link]   [comments]",

Some(12) } `` The result will beOption[Int]. If it would just look at the inner functon ofquestit would deductSome[Int]`. \n This works using a special trait called Resulting[T] which is triggered by quest being a context function. \n Resulting is also referenced by the question operator, thus the compiler is inferencing T to be None and Some[Int] resulting in Option[Int].\n The library triggers an early exit using Exceptions without Stacktraces.

Nowadays, in a society based on computers and applications, crackers attacks are very concrete and dangerous. In my opinion, when we talk about IT security, it is always better to overestimate the risk and have a large margin of tolerance. The (hard) trade-off we have to make is that the solution is usable, has good performance, and is safe.\n  \nOften, it is not a single solution that makes something safe; it is the sum of several approaches that mitigate the risk.\n  \n History\n It has been a while since I had my first idea for a library that would help developers securely manage secret values within their app…",

I was getting connection timeouts when I was trying to connect from a different PC in the local network and when I ran netstat -an | grep LISTEN I got the following output:\n ​\n tcp 0 0 127.0.0.53:530.0.0.0:* LISTEN\n tcp 0 0 127.0.0.1:6310.0.0.0:* LISTEN\n tcp 0 0 0.0.0.0:220.0.0.0:* LISTEN\n tcp 0 0 0.0.0.0:54320.0.0.0:* LISTEN\n tcp6 0 0 :::51934 :::* LISTEN\n tcp6 0 0 127.0.0.1:8212:::* LISTEN\n tcp6 0 0 127.0.0.1:45459:::* LISTEN\n tcp6 0 0 127.0.0.1:44569:::* LISTEN\n tcp6 0 0 127.0.0.1:35383:::* LISTEN\n tcp6 0 0 :::22 :::* LISTEN\n tcp6 0 0 :::5432 :::* LISTEN\n tcp6 0 0 ::1:631 :::* LISTEN\n ​\n Now, the third entry on that output is my ssh server which is accessible from everywhere.

This is probably whey templates in org-roam behave very different than org templates.\n Last weekend I finally spent time and address some of these issues. The commits are here:\n https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam/compare/main...dmgerman:org-roam:main\n for example.The first template will only work when creating a new file (see :create-file). It will ask for the node-title and use it to create the file (the slug).\n  (add-to-list 'org-roam-capture-templates `(\"A\" \"area\" plain \"%?\" :target (file+head ,(eval (dmg-roam-build-path \"areas/${slug}.org\")) ,(eval (dmg-roam-template \"plain.txt\"))) :create-file yes :unnarrowed t)) \n If the path is provided, the user will not be asked for the destination. if the template has :create-file no, and the file does not exist, the capture will be aborted.\n In contrast, this template will ask for a node id, and then search for the \"Tasks\" header. node and node+olp will not create a new file.\n  (add-to-list 'org-roam-capture-templates `(\"t\" \"todo\" entry \"*** TODO %?\\n%t\\n%a\\n\\n%i\" :target (node+olp nil (\"Tasks\")) :unnarrowed t)) \n If the node id is provided, the user will NOT be asked for the node id.\n    submitted by    /u/dm_g  \n [link]   [comments]",

I tried advising org-roam-node-at-point like this (code generated with chatgpt's help, apologies if anything is wrong; my elisp-fu is weak):\n ​\n (defun my-org-roam-node-at-point (&optional assert) \"Return the Org-roam node at point if it exists, or the node corresponding to the link at point.\" (interactive) (let ((id (plist-get (link-hint--get-link-at-point) :args))) (if (and id (string-prefix-p \"id:\" id)) (progn (print (substring id 3)) (org-roam-node-from-id (substring id 3))) (org-roam-node-at-point )))) (advice-add 'org-roam-node-at-point :override #'my-org-roam-node-at-point) \n This doesn't work, but it does succeed at breaking the roam-buffer, so I suspect an approach sort of like this could work, but I'm in over my depth.

As part of publishing, I export the notes as txt, insert them into an FTS5 SQLite table and I added a small reactive app to an existing server to search and display the results. Everything works well but I recently used docsify at work and thought it was superb so I started thinking about client-side searching. I've thought about the following:\n  \nmodify my export to markdown, generate the appropriate sidebar file and setup docsify in the normal way. My primary objection is the markdown exporter's quality is unknown. This would also cut my publish time down significantly and wouldn't be too much work.\n index the HTML (Note: getting this only do the relevant piece was difficult the last time I tried as tags and metadata blew up the results) as part of the publishing process and add a Javascript library that gets included in every exported HTML file. We'll call this the stork model. While slightly slower than the previous option, this would also reduce publishing time substantially.\n  \nWhat other solutions occur to you?\n edit: I ended up doing the first one. It took a couple of hours to convert.\n    submitted by    /u/fragbot2  \n [link]   [comments]",

They both support deconstructing ideas in a tree structure, except that mindmaps offer a spatial way of arranging items, while the outliner does it as a list.

          "description": "I've been messing with this problem for a while now, off and on for months, really, and it's driving me a little bit crazy, so here we are.\n The specific thing I'm trying to do is exit insert mode (modal editing, previously evil, currently trying meow) when I arrive back in the main org mode file after editing a src block. I'm not actually sure why I end up in insert mode sometimes when exiting src edit, but it happens often. Advising `org-edit-src-exit` is the place to be for this as far as I can tell, and that works when returning to the main org file.\n The problem I have is that editing a src block without calling `org-edit-special`, thus staying in the main org file, will also trigger the advice. Pressing RET, or using anything that makes a new line in the src block (like `meow-insert-above/below`) will call `org-edit-src-exit` and its advice, and I can't find any way to tell in the context of that advice whether the edit is happening in a special edit buffer or not. I'm guessing that editing src blocks without calling `org-edit-special` happens in a background buffer anyway so the process is indistinguishable?\n I've tried checking the major-mode before exiting the edit buffer, but it's always org-mode. I've tried using `org-in-src-block-p`, `org-src-edit-buffer-p`, checking `org-src-mode`, setting a local variable after `org-edit-special` that I can check in my advice, so many things that haven't worked.\n It's very possible that I'm missing something obvious, or there's a very different solution to my specific problem, but even if so, I'm still curious about how to distinguish these src block editing situations. Anybody have any ideas?\n    submitted by    /u/vaxdar  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Emacs is a fantastic software that has become my swiss army knife as a pentester. The problem is that recently I've had a muscle issue, radiculopathy, and navigating around DWM with my current configuration is my personal hell. This is fixable with a reworked sxhkd configuration. \n Questions regarding the issue:\n Q1: Is there a prefix key on the left side of the keyboard that can feel as smooth as firing C-x without creating any real pressure between the thumb and index finger?\n BLABLABLA: Define smooth, right? lmao... ig the same way you can glide on and off the defaults for save-buffer, or new-window-on-right. \n Q2: Is there a way to get Emacs to use the same exact hotkey you're using globally? \n BLABLABLA: This is obviously the magical, superfast route, so I don't expect a response to this question. Maybe though... a script, syntactical directive, something... \n Answer either question at your leisure. I'm still hacking away at it myself and just wanted to delegate the task to anyone willing. C-x and M-x appear to be masterful in terms of flexibility. \n    submitted by    /u/_celestialvixen  \n [link]   [comments]",

The idea is to pretend company-complete has been called from inside a \\ref.\n This is a simple example\n  (defun f1 () (interactive) (insert \"\\\\ref{}\") (backward-char) (company-complete) ;; now choose the completion, etc (backward-char 4) (insert \"i_used_to_be_a_\")) \n If the above worked, I'd be using company-completeas if it was being called from a \\ref, but then I'd modify the \\ref to, in this example, \\i_used_to_be_a_ref.\n The problem is that the above immediately modifies \\ref, but I never get to choose the completions . I've tried variations of the above, like call-interactively, without success. I think I am missing something very obvious (emacs lisp novice here).\n Why do I want to do this? Because I want to use company-complete for arbitrary macros in latex as if they were \\ref. I can do this modifying company-reftex's company-reftex-labels-regexp, but ideally I'd like to do it without modifying that variable, or when company-reftex is not called, for example when using LSP.\n    submitted by    /u/rdiaz02  \n [link]   [comments]",

I will open a tmux session in my terminal emulator and keep a window open for whatever number of the projects I'm working with on. Typically I will use an alias to open a project in a new window, open neovim, and open a vertical split with a shell for running the project.\n The thing I like about this is it's super easy to switch between projects and they all keep whatever pane layout I have set up. I can also spawn new windows for any other work I need to do.\n I'm not really getting how I can do this in emacs.

          "description": "Suppose I call completing-read-multiple with the following list of candidates: \n (\"1\" \"2,3\" \"4,5,6\") \n If the value of crm-separator is [ \\t]*,[ \\t]*, selecting the second candidate will result in the list (\"2\" \"3\"), and not (as one might have expected) (\"2, 3\"). This is not very surprising of course, and if you are building your own completion tables for use with completing-read-multiple, the problem can be avoided by keeping the value of crm-separator in mind. The problem is that sometimes the completion table is generated on the basis of input the user may have no control over. \n For example, in mu4e there's a function mu4e-view-save-attachments which does what the name suggests: it lists all attachments in a given message for the user to choose (possibly more than one) and then saves the selected attachments in a specific directory. If you are dealing with a message with files whose names contain a comma, selecting one of those files will lead to trouble. \n Now, I can just define a little function that will temporarily change the value of crm-separator to handle these cases, e.g.: \n (defun my/toggle-crm-separator () (interactive) (let ((original-separator \"[ \\t]*,[ \\t]*\")) (if (string= crm-separator original-separator) (let ((separator (completing-read \"Select one of the following options\" '(\";\" \",,\" \"-\")))) (setq crm-separator (replace-regexp-in-string \",\" separator crm-separator))) (setq crm-separator original-separator)))) \n Still, I wonder if there's a smarter solution out there. Off the cuff, I can imagine scanning the completion candidates to ensure none of them contain an instance of the value of crm-separator and, if they do, at least alerting the user of the need to pick a different value for crm-separator? But I don't know if there's a better way to handle this situation. \n Thoughts?\n    submitted by    /u/graduale  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Greetings everyone,\n I wanted to share a function that I've found incredibly useful while conducting qualitative data analysis of interviews. During this type of research, structuring my interview data and maintaining a clear overview is crucial. To assist with this, I've developed a function in Emacs Lisp that uses tags to extract specific headlines into a new buffer.\n This function, extract-headlines-by-tag, prompts the user to enter a tag. The function then scans the entire buffer, and for each headline that contains the specified tag, it extracts not only the headline but also its content. These extracted parts are then transferred into a new buffer. I've made the new buffer pop up for immediate review after the extraction process.\n Here's the piece of code:\n (defun extract-headlines-by-tag (tag) \"Extract headlines and their content from current buffer by TAG.\" (interactive \"sEnter tag: \") (save-excursion (let ((result-buffer (generate-new-buffer (concat \"/Extracted Headlines \" tag \"*\")))) (with-current-buffer result-buffer (org-mode) (insert \"* Extracted Headlines by Tag: \" tag \" *\\n\\n\")) (org-element-map (org-element-parse-buffer) 'headline (lambda (headline) (when (member tag (org-element-property :tags headline)) (with-current-buffer result-buffer (insert (org-element-interpret-data headline) \"\\n\"))))) (pop-to-buffer result-buffer)))) \n This has greatly improved the way I manage and analyze my qualitative interview data.

Instead of using a library which creates an intermediary JSON representation which is then converted to Lisp objects, my solution creates Lisps objects from the JSON stream without any intermediary steps.\n Measured by ~1 MB of clang LSP messages, it works ~8x faster than the current emacs JSON parser. Maybe it can be helpful for people whose LSP works slowly, as an alternative solution to emacs-lsp-booster (I didn't do any comparisons).\n You can check out the faster-json-parsing branch here: https://github.com/geza-herman/emacs/tree/faster-json-parsing. Is it based on master, but I think it can be easily applied to any recent version of Emacs (it's just one commit).\n This JSON parser misses some error handling, like for example it doesn't check for utf-8 encoding errors. So please consider it as a proof of concept, not as a production quality thing. But I've been using it for a while, it works for me with clangd perfectly.\n    submitted by    /u/geza42  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I created an emacs extension named org-linker that allows users to link a file in org-mode (the attachment is identified as a UUID), offering a secure and flexible method for referring to other files in org-mode. Try it out!\n Comparison with org-attach\n org-linker differs from org-attach in its approach to file attachment. \n org-attach uses an org heading as a basic storing unit, which can lead to issues if not managed carefully (e.g. refiling or adding shadowing subtrees). \n On the other hand, org-linker assigns a unique UUID to each attached file, ensuring a more robust linkage system. By treating individual files as the fundamental unit, org-linker provides a safer and more flexible approach to handling attachments in org-mode documents. For example, this allows easy movement and copying of links across various org files and headings.\n Both tools have their strengths and are suitable for different use cases. However, if you prioritize a secure and straightforward attachment system, org-linker might be the preferred choice.\n Example\n For instance, if the root is /tmp/org-linker/, and the UUID for the transaction is 20240101-235959, and the file is readme.md, the file will be copied to /tmp/org-linker/20240101-235959/readme.md with the transaction recorded in /tmp/org-linker/db.tx. And an org-link [[linker:20240101-235959/readme.md]] is inserted at point.\n You can customize the uuid generator. In particular, you don't have to use timestamp.\n You can also remove the uuid easily by fuzzy searching with M-x org-linker/trash-folder-uuid, or just remove the uuid at point with M-x org-linker/trash-folder-at-point. The trashing function is customizable too.\n Contributions\n Feel free to contribute by submitting pull requests, raising issues, or sharing your ideas!\n    submitted by    /u/jin-cg  \n [link]   [comments]",

But even after i choose the ! to permanetly mark these values as safe, the effect only lasts for that session and the next time I start up emacs and dired into that directory, it ends up asking me again.\n the three denote-silo-extras functions (aside from the C-u prefix issue on 2.2.4 which will be fixed in 3.0), all three of these functions when used don't seem to pick up on my silo's local variable denote-known-keywords for the silos when i execute the functions - they just show my normal global denote-known-keywords.

I already liked LSP-Mode in general, but it was too slow for my very large Unreal project. I'd get constant timeouts, suggestions and completions just outright wouldn't work, and it was a very disappointing experience.\n I switched to LSP-Bridge because it promised better performance, and that was 100% true. It did completions where LSP-Mode and Eglot would choke, but it was a bit of a hassle to set up. I'm on a Windows machine and that always makes things a little more complicated for me. I had to make sure to write a project-root-finding-function or it wouldn't understand my project setup (devs: not everyone uses git, stop assuming that we do), etc.\n Ultimately, I'm switching back to LSP-Mode because it integrates with xref and helm and various other things a lot better. The LSP-Bridge built-in completion is adequate, but it worked in ways that I wasn't expecting/didn't like (the lsp-bridge-find-references function, for example, would split the buffer, and when I quit it, sometimes it would kill the buffer I'd been visiting as well. User error? A bug? Don't know.) You just end up having more flexibility with lsp-mode.\n What I can tell you is that no matter how you slice it, for a project of moderate to large size, you should be using something like lsp-bridge or emacs-lsp-booster. (For reference, based on my compile-commands.json file, there are about 17000 files in my project.)\n Also, it seems that the root of this problem is emacs' ability (or lack thereof) to parse JSON efficiently. That really should be looked at; emacs-lsp-booster is a project that shouldn't have to exist, but I'm grateful that it does.\n    submitted by    /u/vjgoh  \n [link]   [comments]",

Instead of source blocks containing code in the literate document, the literate document instead specifies \"views\" into the source files. The views would be specified by a file name and a line number range, and that range of lines would be visible in the literate buffer as if that was where the text lived, but it actually lives in its own source file.\n So on-disk this \"view src block\" might look like this:\n ```\n +begin_view :file src/main.rs :lines 120-124\n +end_view\n ```\n Whereas in the emacs buffer it might look like this:\n ```\n +begin_view :file src/main.rs :lines 120-124\n let rectangle = Rectangle { length: 3.0, height: 4.0 }; let triangle = Triangle { length: 3.0, height: 4.0 }; print_debug(&rectangle); println!(\"Area: {}\", area(&rectangle));\n +end_view\n ```\n Editing text within this view would be propagated back to the source file, and adding a newline at the end of the view would increment the end of the line range.\n The motivations for this would be avoiding problems with eglot/lsp in an org document for example, or a document explaining some bits of code in detail, without committing to the full literate workflow.\n Does this have a name and does anyone know of any implementations of something similar to this?

I'd like to ask how I could fill that gap.\n For monorepo support, I have the following config, which probably looks straightforward to most of you.\n (defun common-lisp-project-p (dir) (directory-files dir nil \".*.asd$\")) (defvar monorepo-root-markers '(\"package.json\" \"mix.exs\" common-lisp-project-p)) (defun monorepo-try-find-project (dir) (when (file-exists-p dir) (let* ((root (seq-some (lambda (root-marker) (locate-dominating-file dir root-marker)) monorepo-root-markers)) (vc-backend (ignore-errors (vc-responsible-backend root)))) ;; I require a vc-backend, otherwise things break (when (and root vc-backend) (list 'vc vc-backend root))))) (setq project-find-functions '(monorepo-try-find-project project-try-vc)) \n The problem is simply that this only works for projects under version control.\n How do people deal with this while using project.el?\n    submitted by    /u/ayman_pl  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi, everyone. I wanted to post a quick tip to help other noobs like myself. I love org-capture, but I sometimes want to make a completely new file out of quick note, rather than append it to an existing org-mode file. I searched and only found outdated or kind of hard-to-understand answers. So here is a quick snippet to put into your init.el and capture templates to enable creating a new file. \n (defun jj/open-new-project-file () (let ((fpath (read-file-name \"File name: \" \"~/Sync/inbox/\" nil nil nil))) \n As prescribed in the org docs, this creates a new function that will prompt you for a file name to create, starting in the directory you specify in the function. Then, in your org-capture templates add:\n (\"i\" \"New note in Inbox\" plain (function jj/open-new-project-file) \"#+title: %?\") \n This will use your function to create the file and set your cursor ready to type the title in your new org file.\n ​\n I hope this helps someone. I know most people would probably just append to an inbox.org file or similar. I was doing the same thing, but after reading Building a Second Brain, I'm trying to separate the notes into files that can be dragged-and-dropped via Treemacs into the PARA setup I've made. It's a little simpler than trying to use org-refile because in the PARA method, your directories are constantly changing and moving.\n ​\n This solution was heavily inspired by this post: https://www.jesseevers.com/org-capture-function/\n I just modified it to fit my own use case and thought someone searching on Google in the future might appreciate it.

The problem is that reftex-citation takes you to RefTeX's mechanism for choosing the bibliographic reference, which is not company-reftex.\n So I am now doing this:\n  ;; From my reftex-cite-format; for real, this is a longer list (defvar my-cite-options '(\"\\\\cite[][]{}\" \"\\\\citep[][]{}\" \"\\\\citealp[][]{}\" \"\\\\citep[][p.~]{}\")) (defun my-cite-menu () \"Insert citation based on user choice.\" (interactive) (insert (completing-read \"Choose citation type: \" my-cite-options)) (backward-char) (company-complete)) ;; Preserve muscle memory (bind-key (kbd \"C-c [\") 'my-cite-menu reftex-mode-map) \n (Same comments apply to reftex-reference, where I reuse my reftex-ref-style-alist, and create a my-reference-menu).\n This seems to me like the obvious solution because: a) it preserves muscle memory; b) I can reuse my lists of citation options and reference styles, and if I wanted to go back to a pure-reftex solution it would be simple; c) I can continue easily choosing structure; d) I use company-reftex; e) it seems simple enough.\n But I have not found anything similar when searching for it.

Currently, the way I start the daemon is with systemd. I enable and start the service as the documentation shows.\n The issue has to do with where the daemon creates the socket. Sometimes when I boot up my machine, everything works exactly as I expect it to: I can simply run `emacsclient -nc` and it pops right up. I can also set my shell environment variable EDITOR to emacsclient and open files easily that way. When things are working right, I note that the socket is in /run/user/userID/emacs/server.\n Probably half the time I boot up, the socket is in ~/.emacs.d/server/server, which means I have to pass the path to the socket to emacsclient for it to work. This means I have to change the scripts bound to my keybindings, etc., every time this happens. Pain in the butt. And for some reason I don't understand, setting EDITOR=emacsclient -cn -s /path/to/server doesn't work the way I want it to. It opens up a new frame, but does not open a buffer with the current file.\n So my questions more broadly are\n  \nHow does Emacs determine where it creates the socket? You would think it just looks at server-socket-dir, but there's obviously more to it than that, because it changes it up on me regardless of whether I explicitly set that variable.\n And does anybody have any hunches as to what could be causing it to seemingly randomly flip back and forth between socket locations?\n  \n   submitted by    /u/Exact_Willingness_25  \n [link]   [comments]",

These notes are spread over a lot of directories on my system and in different formats (.txt, .md, .doc). Migration to org-roam will make navigating through all of my notes much more comfortable and I already migrated most of my notes.\n The last notes I want to migrate have a \"directory context\". For instance holiday notes in my pictures directory. I am considering to copy/paste these files to org-roam and add a tag to the directory and delete the old note. The downside is that this is kinda an org-roam lock in, because migrating these notes back could be a PITA. If I use a special tag in the roam-note to the original directory then it is possible to migrate the files back with a simple elisp script I guess but could break when directories are renamed in the future. Hopefully I am making myself clear .\n Just before sending this to Reddit a light bulb went off. I could copy/paste the original note in the org-roam note in a code block and tangle it to this directory. I would prefer to not use a code block but something like this seems to be the way.\n How are you guys dealing with old \"directory context\" notes?\n    submitted by    /u/kolerezooi  \n [link]   [comments]",

Here is an example with define-key, but happens to me with lots of functions. Basically, I can never tell if an argument needs to be quoted. Correct usage of define-key:\n  (define-key gnus-article-map (kbd \"i\") #'gnus-article-show-images) \n I frequently make the error where I think I am supposed to quote the keymap. I have to look up some old code to see, oh yeah, you don't quote the keymap.\n Then when I use use-package, I would write\n (use-package gnus :bind (:map gnus-article-map (\"i\" . gnus-article-show-images))) \n Now the function gnus-article-show-images is unquoted, I guess, because this is a macro? The structure of the arg list to :bind is unclear from the function documentation, so I just have to look up another example where I used :bind to figure out the format. Anther example, in general-define-key both keymap and function are quoted.

I am very new to emacs so please bear with me.\n ​\n I understand how to pass arguments to an elisp function.\n ​\n but not able to comprehend how to use it in conjunction with a list\n for example\n (interactive (list (read-shell-command (if shell-command-prompt-show-cwd (format-message \"Async shell command in `%s': \" (abbreviate-file-name default-directory)) \"Async shell command: \") nil nil (let ((filename (cond (buffer-file-name) ((eq major-mode 'dired-mode) (dired-get-filename nil t))))) (and filename (file-relative-name filename)))) current-prefix-arg shell-command-default-error-buffer ) ) \n i can understand what this code does, but because i dont understand how/what arguments the list will take e.g. `read-shell-command`/`current-prefix-arg`/`shell-command-default-error-buffer`/`read-string`\n i am having a hard time creating one myself.\n ​\n Can someone please explain this to me in a simple way?\n Also what all can i pass?\n ​\n i can think of command line arguments in couple of forms:\n  \nshell command\n string\n integer\n file\n buffers\n perfix\n  \netc.\n I am guessing there will be a particular form of these commands i should use.\n TIA\n ​\n    submitted by    /u/justrajdeep  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm thinking about installing Emacs (org-mode is the main selling point) and switching (at least from NeoVim) to Emacs/Doom Emacs. While I was reading about how to install it, I found that there are a couple of different emacs releases that can be installed: \n  \nIf I search Homebrew for the \"Emacs\" term, there is one cask called \"emacs\", let's call it \"standard\".\n But there is also \"emacs-plus\" which should be first tapped: https://github.com/d12frosted/homebrew-emacs-plus?tab=readme-ov-file\n  \nI have a couple of questions: \n  \nI'm wondering what is the \"correct\" way to install emacs on MacBook Pro M1 with Sonoma - standard or plus release.\n If emacs-plus is the correct way should I include those additional flags like \"--with-native-comp\" and if yes which ones?\n If emacs-plus is the correct way, what is better to use \"emacs-plus@29\" or just use the latest version? I guess that if I just use the latest version, then it will be updated whenever I run brew update and upgrade, and I'm not sure how things are going in emacs world with those updates. I used to have problems with NeoVim updates, as well as plugin updates, so at one point in time, I was afraid to run plugin updates :) Hope Emacs is more stable.\n  \nThanks in advance.\n    submitted by    /u/milnik79  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I feel like this should be pretty obvious, but i'm pulling my hair out on the order of operations here.\n I want to customize some faces with a box. And i want that box to use a color from my current theme. But i don't want to hard code the color value, but for it to use the dark or light color of the modus theme, depending on which is loaded on starting.\n So far i have tried using the function modus-themes-get-color-value but it doesn't seem to be available at the point the tab-line gets activated. Then i tried this at the very end of my init.el:\n (custom-set-faces '(tab-line ((t (:box (:line-width (5 . 5) :color ,(face-background 'tab-line)))))) ) \n Which seems to be run before the theme is loaded, as i'm getting a white box on the modus-vivendi theme.\n I tried setting this up in a use-package statement for the tab-line-mode, for the modus theme and for the emacs pseudo package. I tried adding :after (modus-themes) to the use-package statement for the tab-line. All without success. I don't even want it to track the theme when i change it after starting emacs. Just, get the background of the tab-line at start, after the modus-theme is loaded and use that for the box color.\n I feel like i'm somehow overthinking this. How can i get the tab-line border to look right regardless of the configured theme? Is this a case of having to set up a variable for your theme and then making this into a cond statement with hardcoded Color Values? This should work for now, but would mean i'd have to rewrite the any time i want to change themes.\n Just for completeness, here's the entire config, if anyone want's to take a look:\n https://gitlab.com/domsch1988/domacs\n    submitted by    /u/domsch1988  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Have you ever thought to yourself, why should I give Emacs commands like a plebian, when an LLM can just control Emacs for me? Well the first step is now done, we now have a way to make any elisp command callable by an LLM that does function calling. For example, here is me switching buffers by telling the LLM to switch buffers by just describing the buffer I want switched to. It's not exactly a huge time-saver, but it's cool and shows the potential.\n ​\n https://i.redd.it/fy6jnbp2w1kc1.gif\n In my llm package, I've created a new function calling branch after learning that Ollama will soon support function calling. Right now both Open AI and Gemini do this (but Gemini has some limitations). As part of that, I have a utility to use function calling to create function definitions for elisp functions (which aren't really rich enough in information to be passed to function calls as-is).\n I'll be thinking about interesting new interactions that can be built off by having the LLM just control emacs via a few predefined commands. But it's quite useful for certain things where you want the LLM to produce structured information. For example, I created a function that will create an example sentence given a word in a language, and then it can be passed to anki, etc. These things were a bit painful to do previously.\n As normal, I'm not planning on creating an actual end-user package here, but I want to encourage people to think about what can be done using function calling and, if there is something you want to put into a package, use the `llm` package to make it easy and portable (somewhat). Ideas and feedback are most welcome!\n ​\n    submitted by    /u/ahyatt  \n [link]   [comments]",

However I have been wondering if Emacs is on its way down.\n I guess it all started with the birth of NeoVim about a decade back. The project quickly grew and added features which made it better of an IDE than stock Vim (I think). Now i know Vim is not designed to be an IDE, but many NeoVim users seem to want that functionality. Today neovim has plugins t not only code and autocomplete, but also debug code in most languages. i lbelieve it has been steadily attracting users of stock Vim (and of course Emacs)\n Then enter, VSCode about 6 years ago. I guess this project attracted a lot of users from aother text editors (including Emacs). Today it has an extension for everything. Being backed by microsoft means its always going to be better.\n Now whenever I try to look up solutions for Emacs issues on the web, most posts i see are at least 10 years old. For example, I googled for turning Emacs into a web dev IDE. A lot of reddit and Stackoverflow posts that the search turned up were more than a decade old.\n I am wondering if Emacs is on a steady decline . The fact that it is not available by default on many systems seems to be an additional nail in its grave. Even on this sub, a lot of Emacs lovers who used to post regularly, like redguardfoo and Xah are no longer active\n This makes me sad. I absolutely hate having to install a browser disguised as a text editor (VS Code) which will be obsolete probably by another 5 years. I hope that Emacs stays around. Its infinite extensibility is what i love the most (and of course elisp) \n Would like to hear your thoughts\n    submitted by    /u/redditisinmyheart  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "🙏 Please toss an upvote on this issue—it needs 20 upvotes in 90 days to be merged. https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/204942\n Sometimes I use VS Code for work, to understand a plugin, and just to explore.\n Window splitting in VS Code drives me nuts. Window management is too closely tied up with tabs. You end up with an hierarchy of \"Editor Groups\" and \"Editors\" instead of being able to recall any buffer wherever you want. Then Quick Open (buffer switcher) opens a file multiple times—one per Editor Group. Using VS Code's `revealIfOpen` option partially addresses this, but reveals in the previous Editor Group—it can't recall the file into the Editor Group your cursor is currently in like in Emacs.\n We added `revealIfOpenInActiveGroup` to fix this. This allows you to make VS Code work just like Emacs buffers. Here are the docs for the Get Started page in VS Code docs:\n ### Simulating Buffers\n If you're coming from buffer-centric editors such as Emacs or vi, you can emulate that workflow with:\n \"workbench.editor.showTabs\": \"single\",\n \"workbench.editor.revealIfOpen\": true,\n \"workbench.editor.revealIfOpenInActiveGroup\": true,\n \"workbench.editor.closeEmptyGroups\": false,\n VS Code has a model where Editors live hierarchically within Editor Groups, and to split your screen you must use Editor Groups. Using `revealIfOpen` with `revealIfOpenInActiveGroup` causes Quick Open to move already-open Editors into the active Editor Group. This allows you to emulate buffer-centric environments—no tabs, split your screen, and you can view any Editor within any Editor Group without opening a file multiple times.\n PR (with video!): https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/pull/205442\n Issue: https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/204942\n Docs PR: https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docs/pull/7043\n    submitted by    /u/aguynamedben  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "This question is not emacs-specific, but I have a feeling that this technical crowd might know a path forward given how customizable emacs is.\n My new work role requires me to spend even more time in email. We use Office 365 / Exchange for our work email, so the Outlook desktop client and the webmail interface is my default interface. Often times, I send an email to a recipient, and wait for their response. The chance that they respond is low, so I always have to send a follow up note. Take this and multiply by 100 threads, which takes up a lot of my time to stay on top of things.\n What I would like to do is set up my follow-up email, and have the note sent out on a certain date if I haven't heard back yet. If the person responds before the date, the pre-written note should never be sent and could be discarded. Outlook email rules and delay send feature does not allow for such a complex scenario.\n I am aware of the Boomerang app for Gmail and Outlook, but I don't think the cost is worth it; and I don't think corporate would allow me to install that add-in in Outlook.\n I looked into Thunderbird as it has a \"send later\" plugin that appears to have a scripting component, which could probably work. However, I'm unable to get my work mail account to work with Thunderbird. I could probably try some more to figure out why it isn't working.\n Question for the folks in this subreddit: is there a way to achieve the email rules I described using an email client in Emacs? Or some other open source tool?\n I know this is a long shot. Thanks in advance for any insight you might provide.\n    submitted by    /u/vinhdizzo  \n [link]   [comments]",

I don't think this is necessarily specifically an LSP issue, but probably some combination of things, like maybe LSP is getting confused and issuing too many requests? I have already gone through all the recommendations in `lsp-doctor` and I'm a little uncertain where to even look to diagnose further (the `*lsp-log*` doesn't contain anything illuminating) and the problem seems to get worse and worse.\n Is this a common experience? How can I see better what's going on? Any packages I should maybe look for and jettison?\n    submitted by    /u/aghull  \n [link]   [comments]",

However, with the variable calendar-setup set to two-frames, it creates two new frames, one for the calendar and one for the diary.\n This isn't the only command like this, it's just an example, and it's not even the only one I might like to solve, since I face a similar problems with some gnus workflows I want to build, so please, no specific hacks to get this particular thing to work such as suggesting I not use calendar-setup set to two-frames, I really need a generalisable solution to this.\n So the issue is, if I launch emacsclient -e '(calendar)' from a shortcut or the command-line in order to bring up my calendar, this doesn't work unless there is a pre-existing emacsclient frame.\n The solution then would seem to be to issue either emacsclient -c -e '(calendar)' or emacsclient -r -e '(calendar)' in order to create a frame first.\n The problem is this creates a totally useless frame that is both annoying, but also problematic, because you can't close it if the calendar and diary frames aren't already closed.\n What I'd like is to be able to run (calendar) and have it create its frames without the need for a pre-existing frame. Or else in a really bad pinch, have the dummy frame created but totally hidden, and have it quit the moment I close the diary and calendar frames.\n Does anybody have any ideas?

See, I didn’t know this but whenever you refile, when it says getting all targets, it’s opening them up (at least it did in my ibuffer behind the scenes).\n To counter this, I asked an AI to help me, and it did. It wrote the code but it couldn’t get the last part right about not opening ibuffer to kill everything. I fixed that up myself. So this is a collaboration between an AI and me, but the code works.\n The only “issue” now is that if you have a lot of targets, it will take a few seconds each time to do the gathering part.

So I would like to be able to have my widget 'UI', and load the data from the yaml file interactively, so that I can save back to it as well.\n I've been trying to find the source code for the customize buffer in emacs, which does essentially what I want to do, but my grepping has been to no avail.\n    submitted by    /u/UnChilledIndividual  \n [link]   [comments]",

So I've declared emacs init bankruptcy and am starting over.\n I've installed the latest stable version of emacs (29.2) and am using an init.el generated by https://emacs.amodernist.com/\n I am not sure this is the latest and greatest kind of init, I notice it does not use any use-package\n One big change between then and now is the introduction of the nongnu repository and I see that it's automatically listed in the package-archives of emacs 29.2.\n What's it state?\n Do I need melpa at all?\n If I do need melpa for packages not yet in gnu or nongnu, how do I add melpa in so that it's priority is last on the list?\n Right now I have:\n (require 'package) (add-to-list 'package-archives '(\"melpa\" . \"http://melpa.org/packages/\") t) (setq package-archive-priorities '((gnu . 10) (nongnu . 5) (melpa . 1))) \n But even so, when I m-x list-packages I can see that emacs wants to upgrade the nongnu packages to the ones in melpa.\n As an example\n the version of the avy package in melpa is 20230420.404\n but in nongnu the version is 0.5.0\n  \nWhen installing packages, the package with the highest version number from the archive with the highest priority is selected. When higher versions are available from archives with lower priorities, the user has to select those manually.\n Archives not in this list have the priority 0, as have packages that are already installed. If you use negative priorities for the archives, they will not be upgraded automatically.\n  \nSince the version numbers of nongnu and melpa differ so widely, it seems as if there is no way to just set package archive priority such that it will default to nongnu\n Any advice?\n Suggestions on using melpa or not?\n Suggestions if using melpa how to get it to be used only when packages are not found in gnu or nongnu?\n    submitted by    /u/DenebianSlimeMolds  \n [link]   [comments]",

One for the input data (col1, col2) and one for the calculated data (col3, col4)\n I tried it like this\n #+TBLNAME: data | col1 | col2 | | test | 1 | | test2 | 5 | | test3 | 4 | | col3 | col4 | | | | | -4 | 6 | | 1 | 9 | #+TBLFM: @3$1..@>$1=remote(data,@-1$2)-remote(data,@0$2)::@3$2..@>$2=remote(data,@-1$2+@0$2) \n But it throws an error that \"Row descriptor -1 leads outside table\".

I really like the non-hierarchical approach where individual notes are org-mode headers (or files) with an ID property that I can simply link to.\n Org-ql is fantastic at querying org-mode headers, keeping dynamic blocks based on those queries, etc. Using org-ql, I can also query for links within a heading. What I am missing is the option to query for backlinks TO the heading. Has anyone solved this problem?\n ​\n Simple example:\n * Drug A :drug: :PROPERTIES: :ID: 12345 :END: This is an inhibitor of [[id:54321][Protein X]]. * Protein X :protein: :PROPERTIES: :ID: 54321 :END: This is a trans-membrane protein that is over-expressed in breast cancer. \n If I'm interested in the a subset of inhibitor drugs that are linked to Protein X I can do:\n [[org-ql-search:(and (rifle \"inhibitor\") (link \"Protein X\"))]] \n But what about finding trans-membrane proteins are associated with (i.e. \"backlinked to\") inhibitors?\n ​\n OR - maybe there is a way to use org-ql results as org-ql query inputs? For example: \n  \nQuery 1: pull out all drugs.\n Query 2: pull out all proteins.\n Query 3: identify all proteins (from Query 2) that have a backlink to drugs (from Query 1).\n  \n​\n I'm a bit stuck.

This is all reflected in Apple Mail in iOS and on the Mac as well. However, the Sent Mail doesn't seem to sync in the same way. If I send an email with Mu4e, it will save it to the designated \"icloud/Sent Messages\" locally, and I can see it in mu4e. But I can't see it in Apple Mail at all. It's simply not synced. All the other folders are except for this one. Also, Sent items from Apple Mail do not sync to mu4e either.\n Is there something that I'm missing?\n    submitted by    /u/TyrionBean  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Two of the first packages I setup in emacs when I began using it were projectile and perspective. I primarily use emacs as an IDE and wanted to be able to manage different projects. Google said these were good so I started there. Two months on and I still don't have a single perspective set and projectile feels like I'm using a semi truck to tow a hand cart. I've only not removed projectile because it integrates with tree-macs and I'm hoping to set it up so that I can have tree-macs display my list of folders when I'm not working on a project and only the project root of the current working directory when I'm in a python/c++ project. Tree-macs has a variable that allows you to set it to display a single directory and I'm wondering if that can be done with a .dir-local.el file, eliminating the one thing I think would make projectile worth having. I'd also like to exclude folders with .gitignore but again, I wonder if there is a way to do that with tree-macs or project.el.\n So, my question. What do you guys use perspective and projectile for. As a hobby programmer, do you think it's worth having? What are your thoughts on project.el and what else is out there?\n    submitted by    /u/Usual_Office_1740  \n [link]   [comments]",

I've tried looking for guides, but I haven't found information on how to structure the code of a coherent package.\n Particularly, it's been hard for me to keep track of the code in my mind because I'm using mostly plain functions and not many data structures. And the code is so far in one big file, which I don't know how to split up, as opposed to classes, which are more conceptually modular. How should I make my code more modular? How should I decide when I need to make a new function?\n If I need to visit and insert text into a buffer, should the visit and insert be done at the lowest, i.e. most nested, level possible? Or should I wrap the whole function body in a with-current-buffer?\n If I find myself needing to store a lot of data in variables, am I doing it wrong? I'm not using setq, because it seems like overkill and ugly being global, but even with let and let*, keeping track of what variables have been declared and their scope is getting difficult.\n Should I not declare as many variables and instead make monolithic functions where variable's aren't assigned, rather you just evaluate an expression (xyz) inside the expression you would pass the variable to, i.e. (abc (xyz)) instead of (setq var (xyz)) then (abc var)?

Especially since I'm often the solo dev and responsible for both! Since I vaguely remember all the code, I can't even go by \"this looks foreign to me\" as a heuristic to orient myself. I sometimes lose track when I rebase feature branches with 20 commits onto another branch a couple of files and commits down the road. It's horrible.\n I usually can't make sense of M-x diff output. I often use smerge and 3-way diffing in git projects, that helps a bit to see things in context, but not always.\n For my stupid brain, this is an accessibility problem\n Here's the solution I have in mind: to tweak how diff tools show both sides so that the versions have more meaningful names.\n Exmaples:\n  \nMerging foo into main, it'd be nice if the label reads \"changes to be applied from foo\" and \"base from main\".\n Rabasing banana onto divergent recipes, with the shared ancestor main, it'd be great if it reads \"changes from banana\" and \"commonality from main\" and \"difference from main in recipes\".\n  \nIf you know a diff viewer, conflict resolution tool, whatever that allows this and how one might approach this, pointers would be appreciated!

The level of detail depends on the elevation of the perspective you are paying attention to. If you are studying to be a sports trainer, the details you'd view ketosis with would be different from those of a person studying contemporary art design. The trainer might have a note mentioning William Wegman, and the artist might have a note mentioning macro balancing, but neither should feel the need to do a deep dive into topics outside primary areas of exploration. That doesn't mean notes have to be exclusive, without the flavor of life.\nThis object of attention was sparked from watching Bianca Pereira, Linked Knowledge Does Not Work.",

This alone is a fine-tuned game-changer. If the GPT had a persona, it would be a smart, but not snarky, it would be patient, but not hold back, it would act with my best interests in mind. The GPT doesn't have a persona. It is a huge algorithm of 'linked knowledge,' and the benefit comes from its ability to pull out appropriate threads and apply them to the case at hand.\nMy role in this shindig is to be honest when reviewing the critique. I dream of \"What Would Richard Feynman Do?\" Maybe I should get this tattooed on my wrist. W.W.R.F.D. This would be a great slogan to go along with zettelkasting.  Try to be responsible and not give up independence to the machine. That doesn't mean that the GPT is wrong in its critique, it means the it should be viewed like any tutorial, describing best practices while leaving open the opportunities to think in ways that support your individual style and goals.",

          "description": "I shared this on my blog earlier this week:\nhttps://christiantietze.de/posts/2024/02/example-object-tag-vs-topic-tag-programming-zettelkasten/\nSo I talked with a fellow iOS developer about tagging recently, then overhauled a note I found by accident and shared this as an example.\nThe gist is:\nI increased specificity of tags. The general #image  becomes → #uiimage on iOS, #nsimage on macOS, which are actual types in the macOS API.\nI removed the topic tag #appkit which doesn't tell me anything interesting here.\nWhy is the object tag #appkit useless now? Almost all my programming notes are about macOS and thus #appkit, the macOS UI API framework. So it doesn't help find anything, and it'd produce so many notes that it becomes useless. Thousands, if applied consistently!\nThere are notes about the AppKit framework as a topic. These stay put, of course!\nThe thing is: for my very first notes on programmatic image manipulation, it sounded sensible to use a tag like #image.  After all, I did not expect to need specificity here at all: \"something with image in Appkit\" sounded good. But with expertise, I need NSImage-related resources, and I can name contexts better. Like embedding images in text views, as wirh The Archive \nAll notes are malleable, so no problem.\nBy the way, new notes on similar topics I tag with the very specific API titles right away, e.g. #nsimage for image stuff on Mac. This changed in the past couple of years and I don't have to think about this, at all. I believe it felt similar back when I used the \"\"\"bad\"\"\" tag. So chances are I could discover even more specific tags in the future and find the current one lacking   At the moment, it's the best topic tag I know to describe this.",

Share with us what you're learning. Sharing helps me and, hopefully, you, too. It helps me clarify my goals and visualize my thinking. And sometimes, a conversation sparks a magical moment where we can dive into an idea worth exploring. We'd love to hear more from you.  🫵🏼\nIdeas I'm exploring with my ZK:\nI am exploring the idea of when my body is in motion and when it is at rest, it interacts with inertia.\nHow do I modify the format of my wikilinks to something more generic? I feel for @ZettelDistraction's pain, and he modified his file names and the links in his ZK. Just the thought of attempting this hurts my little brain.\nI'm thinking about adulting my Monk Mornings.\nI use my ZK in support of my university literature and writing coursework.\nThings I'm reading:\nQuintero, Isabel. Gabi, a girl in pieces. 2014.\nPicard, Max. The world of silence. 1948.\nGardner, Dwight. UPSTAIRS DELICATESSEN: on eating, reading, reading about eating, and eating while reading. 2024.\nYoon, Nicola. The sun is also a star. 2016.\nMusic I'm listening to:\nSchiller\nKaleo\nHania Rani\nA look at my ZK work themes:\n1/19 zettel - meta zettelkasting\n★★★★★\nThe \"My rolling ten-day zettel production\" is produced by a script for attachment to my daily journaling template. I do my journaling in Bear to keep personal journaling separate from my knowledge work.\nLet me know if you would like to discuss any of these notes.\n\nMy ten day zettel production",
