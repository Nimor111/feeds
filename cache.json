I understand the the -XStrict and Unlifted datatypes help with this. Actually it is interesting that -XStrict does not really cut it, we need unlifted datatypes..\n However, I want to be able to use libraries and preludes that assume everything is strict and/or unlifted.\n Is it possible in 2022 to write Haskell as it if it was a strict language like, say, OCaml? However, where are the strict monad transformer libraries, strict by default preludes etc. Every notable library seems to be lazy...\n I like Purescript -- a dialect of Haskell that is pure and strict. However, Purescript does not have such a lively ecosystem, mature tooling etc. like Haskell.\n I would love to be writing Haskell with Purescript like semantics.

          "description": "I have a little puzzle for the Haskell community.\n Lately I've been experimenting with tagless final encodings (or object algebras in other languages) to build ASTs where previously I would have used a recursive ADT.\n This works great if you have a simple untyped AST. New terms can be added to the AST by adding a new typeclass that extends the base one. \n However, what you have an AST presented with a GADT, with the types of your language encoded as a data-kinded parameter? You can still encode your AST in a tagless final way by using a higher-kinded type as the carrier, and this (as before) let's us extend the terms of the language, but what if we want to extend the types?\n For instance, if we have a base AST for a simply typed lambda calculus, and we want to add products, we need both a new type constructor, and some new terms of our AST itself.\n Yet (as far as I know), it's not possible to use something like a tagless final encoding at the type level.\n Has anyone thought about solving this kind of problem? My only thought was that this might be easier to do in something like Agda or Idris, but I'm curious what a solution to this in Haskell might look like.\n    submitted by    /u/sintrastes  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm not sure where else to discuss such things.\n One of my interests in programming is the analysis of techniques used to employ better coding practices. For example, in OOP you have design patterns that adhere to design principles such as SOLID. To further the example, you can design a factory with SOLID practices considered to create code that is \"clean\", allowing for code reusability, and flexibility. In short, with minimal code smell.\n I am currently reading Refactoring - Improving the Design of Existing Code by Martin Fowler to get a better understanding of things I've come to learn from practice and experience in a more well-presented context.\n I am wondering if some similar texts or resources focus on the functional style of code refactoring and reusability. I understand that many topics and techniques are simple enough to work in all contexts, but I also know that FP languages have their smells and without getting various kinds of experience (which may be difficult to do), I was hoping that I can learn of such topics.\n FP is naturally an abstract paradigm, going miles more than most OOP languages, and I want to be able to strongly analyse such topics in depth. I have moderate experience with Haskell, but due to university studies and life, I don't have the opportunity to focus more effort than I do, learning the various libraries and tools available to build a repertoire of skills from applied experience.\n Thank you very much\n    submitted by    /u/TimeTravelPenguin  \n [link]   [comments]",

Initially numbers are printed slowly but then fast later on.\n Now, I thought I can combine the pre-computing- and the lookup function into a single function like this:\n getAt :: [Int] -> Int -> Int getAt xs index = pre_computed !! index where pre_computed = map expensive xs main :: IO () main = do let xs = [5,2,4,6] for_ (cycle [0..length xs-1]) (print . getAt xs) \n But this doesn't work.

My intuition was, that after partially applying getAt, it pretty much looks like this\n getAt' :: Int -> Int getAt' index = pre_computed !! index where pre_computed = map expensive [5,2,4,6] \n and then laziness makes sure that pre_computed is only computed once. After thinking about it more, I guess pre_computed is a local variable and not shared cross getAt calls.

I've got a REST API in Servant with a resource (/resA/:id) and many subresources (/resA/:id/resB/:id, /resA/:id/resC/:id, etc.) and a database that stores information on which users have access to which resources. I'm using basic authentication to authenticate users.\n I want to restrict access to the subresources of resA so that one only can access e.g. /resA/1/... if one has access to resA/1. Currently I do this by manually checking for access in every endpoint handler under resA, which doesn't feel like a good solution since this check must be added for every new endpoint I add under resA.\n This should be a common scenario for real world APIs, but I haven't found any documentation explaning how to deal with this. Any advice on how to propely restrict access as described above with Servant? Can this be done at the type level, or can I somehow check for access \"outside\" of the endpoints' handlers?\n Happy to be directed to any blog posts / documentation about this!\n    submitted by    /u/Humble_Community7791  \n [link]   [comments]",

What I mean by that is that it shows a program with a main :: IO () but I can't imagine ever wanting that. What you'd want to do is write some functionality in Haskell that is then used from a web page.\n For example, I'd like to compile a library that exports a function run :: ByteString -> IO Int. If I compile it with GHC's new JS backend, I get a bunch of .o and .hi files; I assume the .hi files are \"real\" .hi files and the .o files are some GHCJS-specific format. If I try to make a dummy main = pure () that imports my library, then I get a 13M JavaScript file with no obvious entry point to call run from the outside.\n So what would a similarly simple example look like, that exports a, let's say, foo :: Int -> IO Int instead of a main :: IO (), that can be called from other JavaScript code?\n    submitted by    /u/gergoerdi  \n [link]   [comments]",

For example the Semigroup-Monoid proposal could not be implemented with this approach.\n I propose a different approach that doesn't require a superclass, but selects a subset the class methods and gives them a name. This name can be treated like a regular class, instances can be defined, it can be derived and …",

And I was very excited that GHC immediately compiled the code without any problems and the program ran for the first 1000 digits in 10.36 sec. Although it is currently completely unfair to compare this with other implementations since the JS back-end is not optimised in any way it is nonetheless not completely uninteresting and the result was 0.081 sec for the hand-written JS code with node. That's a factor of 128 faster.\n The second program had to create a 1024 pixel wide Mandelbrot bitmap and compiled and worked equally well. It took 77 sec compared with 0.74 sec for the node version which is about 104 times faster.\n Although the numbers might seem far away from a decent performance I am still very excited about the seamless experience and intend to explore this further for future work. Congratulations to the dev team!!!\n There is indeed an optimisation flag -O here as well and when activated the code runs about ten times as fast compared to the above. Therefore the difference to hand-written JS code shrinks considerably.\n    submitted by    /u/tkx68  \n [link]   [comments]",

That is, it shouldn't compile when one tries to create time serie of type Rain while putting e.g. MeasuredWindAngle inside.\n The measuredProperty is needed to group time series and e.g. compute an average from each serie type. That is, separate average for Humidity, Rain etc..\n Basically, each weather sensor will return many different measurements, where the measurements can be duplicated among different sensors. Therefore, I'd like to combine all measurements into a single list, group by type and then aggregate.\n Moreover, each sensor has a different set of supported measurements. Ideally, this should be reflected in the type system as well. That is, one shouldn't be able to ask for Pressure where the given sensor only supports [Temperature, Humidity].\n Anyone can give me any clues on how to achieve this?\n    submitted by    /u/onliner10  \n [link]   [comments]",

Started off with Java, everything was new, many things felt weird and difficult (because they are), but I accepted them blindly and was happy. Other lectures required me to code in Python, C and C++. The amount of work required for the lectures prevented me from diving deeper into any language than what was required, but they all seemed to be decent with their individual benefits and drawbacks.\n But then came Haskell, it felt like an enlightenment.

And the specific reason I'm asking about this is that notarizing GHC for Macs is currently on the to-do list.\n Notarization is part of Apple's fight against malware. Codesigning is another. I am still learning how they work and what the consequences are.\n Does the lack of a notarized installable affect you? (Example of missing notarization here.) If so, how? It helps to be specific: Did you get started with GHCUp? Stack? Something else?\n What other pain points exist when you (or your students/classmates/colleagues/bosses) get set up to work with Haskell? What's the biggest pain point?\n I'll have access to a Mac soon, but I don't want to base my effort on one data point. :)\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/chreekat  \n [link]   [comments]",

If there was a convention to be made for writing C bindings, this is the obvious default. Kudos for defining new Bool/Int/Float types, it's refreshing to remember Prelude is a module like any other one;\n Probably saves a few thousand characters per library, plus makes Haddock easier on the eyes;\n  \nReasons to keep prefixes:\n  \nOpenGLRaw did it first and it still holds the gl prefix, same with gl;\n No need to explicitly qualify imports;\n Names stay at 1:1 to the API reference, if one exists;\n  \nThere obviously is no one true answer to this question, I'm merely looking for the public opinion on this.

Do electrical circuits have \"join\" and if so what is it? You'd have to spill water on the circuit or have the ability to rewire itself. But the extent to which it can rewire is pre-determined by whatever was printed on the board.\n What is a higher order function or closure in an electrical circuit? It is a \"piece of circuit\" that can be joined or not, but the ways in which the join can be activated are constrained, so this is not actually join. Circuits are compiled. Do HOFs compile to \"piece of circuit\" guarded by switches?\n How would one model a concurrent list comprehension (dynamic cardinality) in a circuit? This should be possible with applicative because the continuation is pre-fabbed and reused, though here we need multiple instances of it. Can a circuit do this or do you need to print the continuation C times to the board, thus constraining the list cardinality by amount of \"memory\" on the board? Is this the essence of applicative – you do not know how much memory you will need?\n Can we encode dynamism into the frequency domain?

Even the names of program resource files are hashed before installing resource files.\n Raku didn't have to hash, but it did because some file systems don't support unicode file names.\n The end result is that it's possible for a raku module repository to host a library written by different authors and for raku programs to import different versions of the same library written by different authors. I think this is almost the most advanced module system.\n I think haskell can do the same by differentiating name, version, and author of a library or a program when installing them onto a system. Then, haskell can install and import multiple versions of a library written by different authors. This can mitigate downsides of dynamic linking.\n If hackage hosted a library written by different authors, then no one has to ask hackage maintainers for taking over an unmaintained library or program.\n    submitted by    /u/amano-kenji  \n [link]   [comments]",

Problem solved(?) But what if I just called it fracEquiv2 and wanted to make the REPL forget about the original fracEquiv ? So in general, is there a way to dump/see what the REPL has and then go in and excise -- or even change -- what's in the running REPL?

          "description": "I want to complete this years Advent of Code in Haskell so that I can learn the language and the functional programming paradigm in general. So far I managed to do the first 4 challenges simply by putting them in different directories and using ghci or runhaskell to execute them. As the point of this is learning the language, I don't want to use any libraries not included in base, I'm implementing functions like split or chunks by myself, but including the implementations of these functions in every single challenge solution doesn't seem like a good idea. I'm not sure if Cabal would be a good idea because the project would consist of 25 separate solutions and 25 input files and I'm not sure how would that go. What is the best way to handle this kind of situation?\n    submitted by    /u/ilovereposts69  \n [link]   [comments]",

The compiler cannot know whether you intended this -- while it increases time complexity it may reduce space complexity. Thus it will not float the definition out from under the binding of x.\n In contrast, in the first function, fib' can be moved to the top level by the compiler. The where clause hid this structure and made the application to x look like a plain eta expansion, which it is not. \n  \nI cannot really understand how the compiler optimized the first definition of the function and not the second, apparently the redefinition of the function has an impact on time complexity.\n I know that a big part of FP optimization comes to know how to dance with the compiler, it's patterns and to lay stuff out for it to make \"better\". But unlike tail recursion, this trick doesn't seem as clear to me.\n I'd be most grateful for a clarification on how this works for a beginner haskeller, thanks :-).\n    submitted by    /u/Deleted_1-year-ago  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm trying to go out of my way to \"play\", to get a better sense of how the language works. I don't think the specific problem is important in this case, but I have run into some counter-intuitive behavior. \n My code reads inputs from a file, then does some simple computation (parse String -> Tuple, then \"score\" that tuple which is just Tuple -> Integer). Then I want to sum the scores. I first did this with a sum and a map, but then realized I could do it in a single fold. Code like this:\n main :: IO () main = do contents <- readFile \"input02t\" let input = lines contents -- This takes ~2 seconds to run print $ sum $ map (score . readEntry) input -- Same answer, but this takes ~10 seconds to run print $ foldr ((+) . score . readEntry) 0 input \n The time difference shocked me, because I expected equivalence.

Some weeks ago, I had the chance to try Vercel and started wondering about why Scala does not have something like this.\n After thinking for a bit, I got to the conclusion that Vercel's preview environments are not really hard to implement. Then, I put my hands into this and created an integration for one of our projects: https://github.com/wiringbits/scala-webapp-template/pull/299\n While the integration is still being tested, it has worked nicely for the past few days, we'll continue to test it in our private projects in the coming months.\n If you want to try breaking it? just submit a dummy PR and github will create a preview environment for your change.\n    submitted by    /u/AlexITC  \n [link]   [comments]",

After searching and reading some articles, I'm not sure what's recommendation to achieve this?\n Background:\n I have a project where it heavily depends on Future for operations. I have no problem with that. However, when writing the code, I want to be able to, for instance, test my logic instead of testing against Future. Also I know there exist libraries like ZIO, cats-effects, Monix, and Fs2. I may use it in the future. Before that happens, I don't want to choose one or the others too early. Then I found some articles talking about tagless final; but there are also some caveats regarding to applying tagless final such as complexity.\n ​\n Any advice that I can apply for decoupling my code's business logic from Future in a simpler way? Would simply provide a thunk (method or function) do the trick? For example, `Future { myFunc() }` - but with this it looks like the next step or function that handles this still couples with Future object. I appreciate any advice.

But How it could be implemented on FS2? Making every subsystem as a stream is fitting very well, but I'm stuck on how to make such interactions and communications between subsystems. Of course, I could \"emulate\" actors (for example https://www.signifytechnology.com/blog/2019/10/replacing-akka-actors-with-cats-effect-and-fs2-by-viktor-lovgren ). Or somehow use reactive streams for it. But maybe I just missing something and there is exist a convenient way to do it?\n    submitted by    /u/Serpionua  \n [link]   [comments]",

So import given ignores them.\n \n In consequence, the old \"implicits object pattern\" must be kept alive, for orphaned extensions:\n import acme.{Acme, given} import acme.extensions._ \n I believe this deficiency may have been overlooked, because non-orphaned (is there a name for it?) extensions don't need explicit imports (which is a great feature BTW).\n Proposed solutions:\n 1. Make import recognize extensions as givens, just for the sake of it:\n import acme.{Acme, given} // imports extensions too import acme._ // does not import extensions \n 2. Add another type of import: import extension\n import acme.{Acme, given, extension} \n    submitted by    /u/marcinzh  \n [link]   [comments]",

Some of that slowness is difficult to avoid—no matter how you slice it, typechecking and optimizing Haskell code takes a lot of work—but nobody would argue that there is not ample room for improvement. For the past few months, Krzysztof Gogolewski and I have had the opportunity to work with Mercury to identify what some of those improvements might be, and I am pleased to report that our first major patch toward that end will be part of GHC 9.6.\nFor readers who just want the numbers, we’ve seen a 2–3% reduction in compile times and a 5–10% reduction in allocations, on average, for unoptimized builds,1 measured on a few large Haskell codebases.

          "description": "I'm new to emacs, I decided to go with doom emacs to get something sort of ready made. But I just don't understand why my copy paste commands are so messed up. And they don't work either. I used F10 to get a visual on what the commands where supposed to be, since C-w, M-w and C-y did nothing. I don't understand what S-delete means, shift-S-delete? Doesn't work. And I note M-w is the normal key binding but it does not work either.\n If I turn on CUA mode and use C-x / C-c / C-v then it works with key commands, otherwise nothing really works. Incredibly frustrating. I was trying to get used to the normal emacs commands but turns out they where not even there. Might there be some addon in doom emacs causing this? \n ​\n https://preview.redd.it/hi0e572aga9a1.png?width=432&format=png&auto=webp&s=e0916da47821489ac1b56c40069e7cb770f72e77\n    submitted by    /u/Surface_plate  \n [link]   [comments]",

Thanks to all the people that have worked hard on Emacs and also plugin creators!!!\n I have created my own config from scratch after having used Doom briefly and Prelude extensively. This is working far better, and it's teaching me a lot.\n On a side note, I would really appreciate feedback into how this config can be improved, best practices, better choices, etc.\n See my config here: https://github.com/averageflow/dotfiles/tree/master/joeTumbleweedIKEADell/emacs\n I use a variety of packages, including consult, marginalia, vertico, corfu and orderless, use-package with straight.\n I love orderless, and when I manually enable it, works wonderful, but for some reason, it doesn't get properly activated in my setup (init.el) when following the documentation:\n (use-package orderless :custom (setq completion-styles '(orderless basic) completion-category-overrides '((file (styles basic partial-completion)))) ) \n When I do (print completion-styles) it gives me just (basic). Somehow it gets overriden I think ?\n I've also tried to change that :custom by :config and to use the setq outside the use-package block, to no avail.\n So I have had to resort to\n (custom-set-variables '(completion-styles '(orderless basic)) ) \n And this seems to work.

I don't use brew much at all, but when I need it it's annoying that vterm or any of emacs' shell tools can't find it. \n - Vterm doesn't have access to the kill ring. If I try to M-y anything from the kill ring vterm says `Buffer is read only`, which it certainly isn't. \n - Using the universal modifier to include a string of digits doesn't work: C-u 12 C-u 0 should insert 12 \"0\"s, but it just inserts 1. \n There are other gripes but these are the three top of mind.

          "description": "Async programming in Emacs is... challenging. If the modern asyncio/await/async paradigm represents \"cooperative\" multi-tasking, Emacs' async seems more \"semi-cooperative\".\n I'm working with async process output in a comint mode, and I (re-)read the following docs often (emphasis added):\n  \nOutput from a subprocess can arrive only while Emacs is waiting: when reading terminal input (see the function waiting-for-user-input-p), in sit-for and sleep-for (see Waiting for Elapsed Time or Input), in accept-process-output (see Accepting Output from Processes), and in functions which send data to processes (see Sending Input to Processes). This minimizes the problem of timing errors that usually plague parallel programming.\n  \nSo it's pretty clear that sit-for and accept-process-output are good \"yield points\" (ala await). But what about in functions which send data? Does that mean:\n  \nOnly functions which directly call process-send-*?\n Any function which calls such a function (and so on up the call stack)?\n  \nAnd where exactly in such functions which send data can process-output interrupts happen? Anywhere? Only specific places? If you've been down this road and found any enlightenment, I'd be grateful to hear about your travels.\n    submitted by    /u/JDRiverRun  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I'd be grateful for any help with a problem I've had for a while. When I close Emacs, I always make sure to save every open buffer before I do so -- it's an automatic reflex. Thus, the saved version of any given file will be the most current, and there should not be any need for autorecovery unless Emacs crashes without getting to save. Sometimes however, even after a normal close, my Emacs claims that a file has auto-save data, and prompts me to recover the file. If I recover the file and run a diff on it, I can see that the \"recovered\" file is actually an out-of-date version.\n Has anyone else encountered this, and could there something wrong with my config that's causing Emacs to try to \"recover\" out-of-date files? Below are the lines that I think could be relevant from my config:\n (setq version-control t) (setq vc-make-backup-files t) (setq auto-save-interval 20) (setq kept-old-versions 0) (setq delete-old-versions t) (setq backup-by-copying t) (setq kept-new-versions 10) \n Right now I'm on Emacs 28.2 on Apple M1, but I think this has been a problem I experienced on a past Linux machine as well, so I suspect the fault is with my config.\n Thank you!!\n    submitted by    /u/NeatSea7  \n [link]   [comments]",

Vertico is a minimalist, yet flexible and responsive vertical completion UI. Marginalia provides helpful annotations for many completion contexts. Both packages have been solid for a while but I rather let things mature slowly. These releases finally put the stamp \"stable\" on these two packages. I expect the other members of the package suite to follow soon after. Both packages have been updated recently to support the newest Emacs 29 features. They are compatible with Emacs 27, 28 and the upcoming 29.\n I got a lot of positive and constructive feedback over the last two years and the packages have seen some growing adoption in the community. This is all very encouraging. I learned about many different subsystems and packages through your feedback and given the ubiquity of completion in Emacs. Thank you, Emacs community!\n If my packages make your daily Emacs live better, please consider sponsoring me on GitHub Sponsors. I plan to develop and maintain my packages in the long term. I am the author of Vertico and Marginalia is co-authored by /u/oantolin and me.

          "description": "Good morning,\n I have a situation where I'd like to automate something with TRAMP but my Elisp-fu is pretty weak. I can kinda read it and usually figure out what's going on, but that's a bit different from getting the thing to work.\n We have embedded development units with a little miniature network inside them for communications. I need to do dired (and ultimately file editing, but dired is a fine jumping off point) on files on the second hop. The second IP address is always the same, however the first can vary within our local network, and depending on which box we're shelling into. So for example a working argument to dired looks like:\n /plink:root@10.20.20.5|ssh:root@192.168.1.1:/ \n And this will give me the directory at the root filesystem on the second hop. The 192.168.1.1 address is always the same (it's inside the box) but the 10.20.20.5 might vary at the 5 depending on which box, and which IP address DHCP picked up that day when it powered on.\n Ideally it would just interactively ask me for the first address and then execute dired on the full string as I'm fine with using that as a starting point for editing the scripts and whatnot that end up on the machine.\n Anyone Elisp fluent who might point me in the right direction? Thanks in advance. I've read a lot on the Elisp programming manuals and such, but getting from the language to doing something functionally useful more than basic addition or something has eluded me thus far.\n    submitted by    /u/remillard  \n [link]   [comments]",

Preferably it's scoped so that you don't get all fields of any data type ever defined in your auto completion results.\n \nOption to require the data type to be fully populated or not.

I understand that this has a perf fix after a MacOS change to `vfork` last year.\n Some examples of the kind of performance issues we're seeing: it takes a few seconds to open the git status buffer (even on very small projects with little git history - longer on larger projects), and going through a diff to stage selected hunks seems to take a second or two for each one, which seems very high and is frustrating when you have a lot of changes to look through when trying to create a logical commit. On linux all these operations felt more or less instantaneous.\n I've seen suggestions for improving performance by disabling parts of the status screen etc., but I'd rather avoid doing this if possible, and not sure if this would help with peformance when staging something. The fundamental issue seems to be around slowness when emacs creates processes, rather than anything specific to magit, I just notice it with magit in particular as it creates a lot of git processes.\n I just wondered if this was considered 'normal' on MacOS and everyone just puts up with it, in which case I'll have to learn to live with it too. But I'm a bit baffled by the fact that there just seems to be very little discussion online about the problem.\n If anyone has any insight, even if it's just to share that they see the same behaviour so I no longer feel like I'm going insane, it would be much appreciated :-)\n    submitted by    /u/actionshrimp  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I’m wanting to sort corfu candidates by string length, from shortest to longest. By default, I believe corfu does sort by string length, but it groups the candidates and restarts the sort several times in a long list of candidates (e.g., the cape-symbol capf) depending on several factors. I thought the below settings would get me the global sort I’m looking for, but no luck: ``` (customize-set-variable 'corfu-sort-override-function #'my/corfu--sort)\n (defun my/corfu--sort (list) \"Sorting predicate which compares X and Y.\" (sort list #'my/corfu--sort-predicate))\n (defun my/corfu--sort-predicate (x y) (< (length x) (length y))) ``` Does anyone have a solution?

          "description": "Hey all\n I'm toying with using project.el in place of projectile, since I barely use any of projectile's features other than switching between known projects.\n One thing I'm struggling with is the workflow element. Along with projectile I have perspective and persp-projectile, and I have bound p in the projectile-command-map to projectile-persp-switch-project which gives a great experience when flipping back and forth between related code repositories, something I have to do often.\n Unfortunately I can't seem to replicate this great experience. I briefly tried using persp-mode with persp-mode-project-bridge but there doesn't seem to be an analogue for projectile-persp-switch-project.\n What this means is that using Projectile I can have a 2-window split in one \"project\" and 6 in the other, and flipping between them is nice and smooth. Whereas in Project each time I switch the flow is broken, since the default action is to present a menu and maybe open a single file.\n I'd love to hear from people who maybe use Project+<something> and have a similar workflow/experience to what I'm aiming for.\n If it helps, my config is based on vertico+consult+embark.\n As always, thanks in advance for your suggestions/support!\n    submitted by    /u/hairlesscaveman  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have elpy set up, and have managed to get that working. The only issue left is I have no idea how to wrap my head around pyvenv, which came included. Trying pyvenv-workon prompts me to set WORKON_HOME, which I'm unsure about since I run Windows 10, and when I try to activate venvs I've already made and have stored on my computer it doesn't seem to work. Any advice on how I can use pyvenv effectively and program with Python well in Emacs, or any good documentation sources on what exactly is going on? I've tried reading the manuals, couldn't really make heads or tails of the virtual environments content.\n    submitted by    /u/JCWalrus  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm currently on Windows 10, if that helps.\n    submitted by    /u/JCWalrus  \n [link]   [comments]",

To be more specific, I use colemak for English input (and basically everything else inside emacs), but qwerty for Chinese input. \n As I've been exploring, I found several possible ways of implementing this: letting fcitx handle the input methods and interface with it using `fcitx.el`, or let emacs handle everything and use `pyim` for Chinese input. \n I feel like both methods are bad. For fcitx, I'm not sure if the package could change fcitx state as buffers, major/minor modes change. Even it is possible, I suspect that it will be a huge hacking work (I'm a noob with elisp). For the native input methods, I'm not sure how to make the system input methods ignore emacs. Also, letting emacs handle its own inputs seems... inelegant.\n Do you have any good solutions for inputting Chinese in emacs, with colemak as the default English input?

So far it's quite nice but doesn't feel like a game-changer and might need some tweaking to improve it's behavior.\n While I'm aware other auto-completion frameworks might support this functionality, I find it useful to separate blocking completion from this kind of suggestion generation.\n Is anyone doing something similar in Emacs already, any comments?\n  \nThis is the repository if anyone is interested although this isn't yet documented and internals may change.\n    submitted by    /u/ideasman_42  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'd love it if I could make completion inside of zsh feel more like how it behaves in Emacs. In particular:\n  \nWhen I hit tab to complete something, I want to be able to hit the down key to start cycling through the candidates.\n When I find the candidate I want, tab should fill it in instead of moving to the next candidate.\n If I'm completing a path, after hitting tab whilst completing a directory, I should immediately see the contents of that directory, which I can then pick the file I want and hit tab again.\n Fuzzy completion ala Orderless would be awesome: hitting space during completion acts as a pattern separator.\n  \nDoes anyone have enough zsh-fu to know how to get something like what I described in the shell?

Prolog, Puppet, Ansible I also do frequently. Wide language support would be nice. I'm a believer of LSP, so I'd like to use LSP.\n I write a lot of AsciiDoc for work. Being able to integrate aspell and Vale would be a big plus (recommended plugin for Vale is https://github.com/tpeacock19/flymake-vale , which is not in MELPA- maybe a straight.el-using starter kit would be helpful? Or perhaps I should just submodule/subtree/subrepo it?)\n Reasonably similar to vanilla Emacs- I don't want to be too lost without my configuration.\n Multi-account email client? I already mbsync two personal accounts (GMail and Yahoo) for backup purposes, might consider handling work email in Emacs too.\n I work significantly on RHEL 8 systems, which ship Emacs 26.1, and also on a RHEL 9 box (27.1).\n  \nThoughts, suggestions?\n    submitted by    /u/koalillo  \n [link]   [comments]",

What is the workaround for this?\n \nThe intellisense messages on the right side of the screen are often truncated due to a lack of space on my screen. How can I view the entire message when this is the case? Surely there's a better way than just flycheck-list-errors since I have to actually visually search where in the list the error/warning corresponding to my current line is.

I have an example of this which I can produce upon demand.)\n ​\n  \nWhen LSP shows some information about what I'm typing in the minibuffer, how can I choose to view that information in full? See the image below. You can even see the \"1/3\" page label. How do I access those pages? If I press ESC so I can press K, pressing ESC gets rid of the message in the minibuffer and then attempting to press K will simply yield LSP :: No content at point.\n  \n​\n https://preview.redd.it/q1e8so0c055a1.png?width=629&format=png&auto=webp&s=6a0b2cc1d971ae4bba8c30af8f29834e897d17b6\n  \nnext-error / flycheck-next-error does not let you navigate to warnings (despite warnings appearing in the flycheck 'error' list).

Therefore I've read multiple times that switching to WSL makes emacs much more performant. Also using a VM with Unix might help.\n I've tried that and basically have seen 0 improvement, especially with LSP and maggit. I've built emacs from source to be sure that native comp, etc, is enabled.\n Using only the Linux file system (not using /c/...) made emacs a little better but still far from my Linux experience with it :( my config works really well on Linux, so I don't think it is problematic?\n I am using emacs for very different purposes such as: unity c#, c++ dev (sometimes with VS), .Net, org mode, org roam, trump edit, etc... Which makes it hard to live only in the wsl Linux file system as far as I've been able to test (a pain with unity, a pain with VS, a pain with / and \\, a pain with crlf and lf, etc...)\n Does anyone have a good way to have a performant emacs on windows please? Does the native window switch on v29 improves anything?\n Emacs is such a good piece of software, it makes me really sad that after battling for months to try to solve the problem, I find myself on the verge to switch editor again because I cannot ditch windows...\n    submitted by    /u/Aeiorg  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I am running GUI Emacs on Arch Linux WSL2 (Vcxsrv X-server). I am noticing a significant slowdown when I full-screen my GUI Emacs. The slowdown is particularly noticeable in input latency. When I type fast, I would have to wait a few seconds for the letters to appear one by one.\n When I shrink down the size of the GUI frame, Emacs becomes very snappy and responsive. I have noticed a positive correlation between Emacs lag and the size of the frame -- this is the weirdest thing I've come across since I started using Emacs years ago. Running no configuration with `emacs -q` is the same thing -- significant latency when the frame is big.\n Has anyone been faced with this issue? I am so bewildered by this but can't find anything related online. At the moment I'm using terminal Emacs as the frame-size vs. latency issue does not exist in the terminal.\n    submitted by    /u/yep808  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "As a newcomer here I just wanted to share my point of view for the community and any maintainers. Emacs has already expanded my mind and I'm beginning to grok the power of having a Lisp system at my fingertips. Now I can get through the more research-intensive install (on macOS at least) to find the best build and install flags. And I can get through learning and customizing any historical quirks of software going on 50 years strong..\n But one big obstacle to me, which isn't customizable, is that the cursor is always in view. Even in the GUI there is this trait which makes it feel like a terminal application (which it did start as). It fundamentally changes how one selects and navigates text (select text, scroll back up and select region disappears). In a world where every other GUI app doesn't behave this way, it is a big change. It feels like a constraint. This will force me deeper into keyboard centric navigation which is fine. I just think cursor flexibility should not be overlooked and for younger people who are switching from other editors and have used the mouse their whole lives, I can see it hurting adoption.\n This is probably very hard to implement, going against how it has always worked, but I think that would be good to at least have an option to let cursor scroll off screen. Let me know what you think. Kinda related: does anyone know of a package that makes the select region wrap around words instead of going edge to edge on screen?\n    submitted by    /u/amasunbey  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "So Atom has shut down. I could probably still use it, but for permanence I decided to switch to Emacs since I'm extremely picky with my editors. \n To be honest, the first time I tried it I was disappointed how hard it was do something simple as save a file, copy/paste and whatnot. However, the \"steep learning curve\" everyone talks about is just a matter of having a nanosecond of patience. Then speed comes later. What I love about the keybindings is it confines all of my work to the keyboard and the bindings are ergonomic if you also use the right Ctrl and shift keys. My workflow is honestly magnitudes better, being able to jump at lightning speed, completely neglecting arrow keys and the mouse. Also, for the first time ever, I am using all ten fingers to type. \n The question: I've set up a theme which I like, auto pairing brackets, indent and auto-complete. Curious if there's a way to get linting support? i.e. underlining missing semicolons, typos. \n Also, can I integrate a terminal into emacs as well? So far having the screen split with emacs and terminal (GNOME on Ubuntu) is working fine, but wondering if there's an even better way. \n Thanks.\n    submitted by    /u/DistilledProblems  \n [link]   [comments]",

There are a few known bugs (and many unknown I am sure). But things work in happy-path scenarios when you have correct identities defined and whatnot.\n I mostly copied over things from EPA package and adjusted for GPG->age differences (fortunately age is much simpler to work with). So when things are set up right you can get transparent age file decryption on file open and encryption on save. There's a few other accessory functions as well.\n Package needs some refactoring, more documentation, better error handling, support for different ways to specify recipients/identities, figuring out why editing over TRAMP saves unencrypted files and more. If someone feels like helping out I'd be happy to accept patches :-)\n I haven't really done that much elisp coding, but I've enjoyed the process so far.

It seemed as though the easiest way to get an idea of the potential of emacs was to install doom. I used the official guides on the repo and tried out both emacs-mac and emacs-plus with native comp. On my M1 macbook pro I experienced major cursor lag (when navigating through text files using vim bindings), they were so severe especially after coming from vim that i ended up removing doom entirely. Vanilla emacs didnt feel a 100% smooth either. Whats even weirder is that weeks after uninstalling emacs itself my computer still had a process running called emacs with 99% cpu useage and high gpu useage. After doing some digging, it seems that there are rendering issues on retina displays specifically that really mess up the responsiveness of the app. I read about different things to try such as using fira code as the font, changing the line highlighting behavior etc.\n ​\n Anyways, Before trying to fix something that seemed broken I want to try to install another build again, and I'd also be comfortable with vanilla emacs and configuring it on my own if it means stable performance. So what I want to know specifically is the following:\n In your opinion what are reliable distros and build options out of the following distros for M1 on a retina display in terms of responsiveness and light cpu/gpu useage?\n - emacs-mac\n - emacs-plus\n - emacsformacosx\n and would you ppl suggest with native comp or without?\n    submitted by    /u/drax19  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Tweaking emacs with satisfication is not easy, but I am trying to think how it would work efficiently. The problem of the naive emacs keybindings is that it over relies on the ctrl key, default layout of modern computer keyboard makes it effort-some to do navigation. In my opinion, the alt (or meta) key should be paid more attention as we can balance between those two kinds.\n The first thing I found is that using arrow keys to navigate is fine, but not efficient, as its up and down arrow is not so coherent, and most of times we need rely on the thumb to hit the keys separately. While ctrl-n and ctrl-p can be an alternative to move around between lines, the same as alt-n and alt-p, for which I would suggest that using it as forward-paragraph and backward-paragraph. It can be smoother as oppose to the ctrl-<down> and ctrl-<up>, in the mean time, you can utilize the other combinations such as alt-f, alt-b to move forward word or backward. In that sense, alt key becomes a bold version of ctrl key, since it jumps fast and corresponds to every navigation key that ctrl has. We can therefore switch between those two modifier keys to move in a small pace or in a larger pace without intervening the arrow keys. At the same time, we can assign more combinations to the prefix key alt-s corresponding the ctrl-x. If we can stay mostly at the left region, the keystroke would be more efficient. If we can utilize those two kinds to the best, we can balance the left and right region, such as buffer navigation uses right hand-side alt-[ and alt-], and buffer switch uses alt-\\.\n I also want to listen to your suggestions, as I believe everyone has their own opinions and configurations to make a balance, not be overloaded, while be efficient.\n Edit: I have remapped caps to ctrl.\n    submitted by    /u/OutOfCharm  \n [link]   [comments]",

So I grabbed my phone and made a fleeting note \"Life is a tickertape\".  Later I came and composed this zettel.\nWhile I've been trying to begin my zk with notes from sources with the hopes of building it up over time, I also very much want to capture these kinds of musings.  I fact it's an eye toward this kind of thing that is my primary motivation to create a zk.\nSince I'm still new to this, I'd like to start off on the best foot possible, so any advice about what I'm doing here would be appreciated.\nThanks!\n\n  \nLife is a Tickertape\nDate: 2022-12-31\nTime: 09:12\nTags: #illustration #musing #question\nLife is experienced moment-to-moment, like an old fashioned tickertape.  This is how we receive information.  Reading, lectures, podcasts, speeches, these are sequences of words.  Music is sequences of sounds.  Movies are sequences of pictures.  All of these represent bits of information that come in one at a [[time]].\nSimilarly, reasoning seems to be a series of logical steps that take us from idea to idea to idea until we reach a conclusion.\nIn contrast, our [[brain]]s seem to operate as an interlinking network.  At the lowest level it's a web of interconnected synapses.  At a higher level our thoughts seem like a web of associations, similar to a [[mind map]].\nQuestion: Since our experiences are sequential, but the organization of our thoughts is more of a network or web of associations, how to we integrate these concepts?\nContrast with [[gestalt]]",

I've tried writing my first Zettel and I would apreciate if you could tell me what I can improve in it!  \nI've written it in Portuguese and auto-translated it to English using Google Translator (imma be honest here, I'm too lazy to translate it manually lol).\nAs a first try I used a post from this Zettelkasten website as a reference to it and based on what I understood, I wrote this:\n**UUID:** 30122022224925\n**Creation Date:** 12/30/2022 - 10:49 PM\n**Tags:** #reading #notetaking #writing\n\n# The reading of a text must be accompanied by notes and writing\n\nUnderstanding the content of a text and absorbing the knowledge present in it only happens during the active stage of reading, which is taking notes and writing about the ideas that the text presents. In a passive reading, where the text is just read, the information is retained for a much smaller amount and time, in addition to the fact that the main ideas are not worked through the reader's knowledge.\n\nAnnotations allow ideas to flow and solidify in the reader's mind, allowing them to retain longer and be able to question them to lead to new questions and answers. Writing allows the connections of ideas to be transmitted in words to paper or document so that others can read, understand and process these ideas so that new connections are established.\n\n---\nChristian: **The Collector's Fallacy**.

There could be numerous reasons.\nMy point, though, is that I don't always want to update (or \"refactor\") a zettel; sometimes I just want to (legitimately) expand it.  I've started adding dates to the new material and some zettels now appear as:\nDate 1 (UUID) with original material.\nDate 2 with new material.\nDate 3 with even newer material.\nThis approach has an added advantage in that it allows me to see a progression in an idea - what did I write initially and what are my thoughts now?\nHas anyone else implemented this practice?

          "description": "My comment:\nThe issue of creating fiction into the system is that you deligate an ability to an external system that can and should be a skill of the person, you prevent the development of this skill. That decreases or perhaps even inhibits the training effect working with a ZK has or could have.\nFolgezettel is a very valid and perhaps necessary technique that makes working as if you have a project you are working on. However, the most important counter-argument against the validity of Folgezettel is that you can achieve this with a better technique which is the structure note. Folgezettel allows to code for two different directions: lateral and horizontal. That means that you can't map meaning on Folgezettel or are limited to two (or four if you count the opposite directions) categories of meaning. Structure notes on the other hand allow for as much of connection as you are able to produce on the canvas you use. What would been a cluster of Folgezettel can be a single drawn image on a Structure Note. Even when using a analog Zettelkaten my recommendation is the heavy use of Structure Notes since they pull together thoughts and their relationships on one single canvas.\nIn theory, the \"good enough relations\" are awesome. But in practice, from what I see, the good enough is mostly an in the moment idiosyncratic idea that you will forget in the future. When the future is now, many people have quite some difficulties to understand the relation or to see a relation at all. That is intrinsic to the concept of \"most what you produce is garbage\". This includes the connections, direct and via Folgezettel. If you actually make it a point to get a grasp on the nature of connection you'll build more robust (even antifragile) edges in your network.",

Or rather based on them. Namely, if critical masses are reached by continuous growth, which introduce a new level of complexity. The critical mass is then a value, from which positive feedback effects occur. A slowdown comes about by the fact that the limits of a negative feedback or a saturation are slowly reached.\nThis is one of my older notes (from Feb. 2012)\nIt is understandable but pretty unrefined.",

Here are my (quick) thoughts on the issue.\nYes I agree, categories can be constraining, but in my thinking categories by themselves are not the root issue. The inability to move between contexts is the real bottleneck. That can be fixed with tag-maps.\nFirst, open this site in a new tab (& once there, click a box to understand visually) for an example of provisioning a user with arbitrary context/mappings...\nhttps://www.lemoda.net/c/index.html\nNow then, here's the syntactical sugar...\ntags: map{science, notes, *}, Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind\nWhere...\ntagline is:          'tags:'\nmap declaration is:  'map{token 1, token nth}'\ntags (1 or more) is: 'Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind'\n\n1/3 split tag-map into tokens...\nmap[0] = science;\nmap[1] = notes;\nmap[2] = *; // asterisk is a wildcard & matches any/all taxonomies...\n\n2/3 user selects a mapped token...\nselected_map = map[1];\n\n3/3 commence comparisons...\nfor (x = 0; x < max; x++) {\n\n  if (map[x] == selected_map && query == tag) show_data...\n\n}\n\nshurgs: speaking only for myself, works me  \nedit: I also want to add that Christian is doing a fantastic (very professional too) job with his software.

Now imagine that same tag retitled 'books/fiction' & now I'm thinking about virtualized pathways for tags & the plot thickens. Lets create some more...\ntags: books/fiction/the grapes of wrath\n\ntags: books/science/outline of history/my-notes\n\ntags: books/travelogue/wind sand & stars\n\nNow, if you recall I'd noted earlier I was (yes 'was' the issue is fixed) wrestling with a regex/wildcard issue when bam! the idea came to me: paths for tags that can expand via wildcard & globbing. An example...\nbooks, books/, books/*    # all return tag-path books/\nbooks/fiction             # returns all tags within tag-path books/fiction\nbooks/*/wind sand & stars # returns the 'relative path' for wind sand & stars \n\nLots more wildcard patterns too... Of course there are no folders or directories, its simply a construct mapped onto the tags providing not only a method of grouping context, but a nested hierarchy or a taxonomy if you like.\nWell, got to run for now.\nhttps://forum.zettelkasten.de/discussion/comment/16825/#Comment_16825\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glob_(programming)",

This is a note that I took yesterday (translated by DeepL):\n\n  \nGood music is made to give us strength. Old war music, a lot of video game music, some movie music.\nOther music is made for us to give it power. Pop music is made to be about itself. It's all about itself. It wants us to focus our attention on it.\nListen to good music!\nMusic is part of the cultural environment of us humans. It is the most primal form of cultural transmission of meaning. It is (without singing) meaning in its purest form: Harmony through form in form in form.\n\n\nI have no study to provide evidence for my thesis. However, my n=1 is very positive. I, personally, like to listen to traditional war music. Now, that I started my cold adaptation (cold shower + shiver walks aftwards (walking in cold with few clothes on)) I feel like nordic war music is appropriate.\nBut gaming music is my personal favorite. For people, that don't like to listen to music at all: Ambience sounds like campfire sounds, thunder and rain etc. are also power giving.\nI like this more than binaural sounds.

Trust that something surprising or magical will happen.\n\n  \nI realized that in a few months, let alone years, at this rate most of my time would be spent on the maintenance of memories [notes]. I, as others have found, would be too busy maintaining these memories to use them. 1\n\n\nWhat does \"use\" mean? I can use a note's contents to reignite ideas in me. They can spark new, novel ideas and connections with established knowledge. Some balance between creation, review, and maintenance has to be made in zettelkasting. In that sense, zettelkasting is like dog training. Dog training is hard work, and it is often not fun to train, but the rewards of a well-trained dog show up throughout the day.\nReviewing zettel has been a focus of mine, and I highly recommend it. Looking at notes created yesterday, three weeks ago, six months ago, and last year is a great start. If we develop notes sporadically, we'll probably only have one or two notes to review. Slowly and steadily, we plow through our notes, and in time, we will have reviewed every note multiple times.\nI think Minto is confused about how much time it takes to review a couple of notes (if atomic, focus on a single idea) and how a short review over and over builds, reinforces knowledge, and shows not only new connections but whole new ideas.\nIs it true that the ideas captured in our notes are not worth reviewing? I suggest the next to capture, the review is the most essential piece in a ZK workflow.\nMinto, Robert. \"Rank and File.\" Real Life, 2021, https://reallifemag.com/rank-and-file/.&#160;↩︎",

I was tired of feeling like Butterbur's mind--\"thing wanted always buried.\" My zettelkasten will be more for my own personal pursuits than for work.\nI will be here reading, writing notes, and keeping quiet until I have my sea legs. I'm reading Sonke Ahrens now.\nThank you for this wonderful resource, and for the sharing of knowledge and wisdom I see here.\nCT",

          "description": "Good afternoon folks! I'm Tracy, from Ontario, Canada.\nI've been slowly familiarizing myself with some of the zettel intros, posts, and concepts, while also trying to be realistic and conscious about the way my brain works and what will be a sustainable habit to introduce into my existing notes system. Currently, my notes span across academia, professional work, personal stuff, grocery lists, conceptual ideas, project sketches/outlines, and even video game progress plans.\nThese notes are captured in Zotero attachments, paper bullet journals, google docs, iOS Notes App, liquidtext pdf editor, the reminders app... I don't think I'll be able to so cleanly bundle everything into one tool, but I like the idea of taking the things that really engage and interest me and giving them their own space in the archive so I can make cross-disciplinary connections or revelations!\nI am afflicted with the \"it needs to be perfect\" to start with, and something I've been working on is just doing something \"poorly\" or \"haphazardly\" to get that attitude out of the way. My first zettel in the archive software was just me testing the archive syntax (which is new to me) and reflecting on how it feels with my style of note-taking.\nAnyways, looking forward to learning more about zettelkasten, knowledge practices, my own brain processes, and the challenge of sorting, retaining, releasing, and integrating knowledge in a way that is helpful to my own goals",

          "description": "I was watching this video from Cal Newport's podcast where he briefly mentions Zettelkasten. The video is about how he uses a simple marking system while reading and how it makes note taking unnecessary for a professional writer. His definition of the Zettelkasten method is something like take notes on everything you read, regardless if it is relevant to your current project. As an example he gives Ryan Holiday. We know that is a poor definition of a Zettelkasten and Ryan is not a good example either. He takes copious notes, but there is no linking in his system. While I don't agree with his characterization of the Zettelkasten, I think it is true that some people use it that way.\nAnyway, my point is not to complain about his characterization of the Zettelkasten, he mentioned another thing…",

Complex systems theory allows you to see links between disciplines, which also can make hard to focus on one thing at a time.\nI struggled through my endless master thesis process. It got me sick for real. Concentrating was sometimes impossible even for whole weeks. Gracefully I ended it well a few months ago and now I'm a researcher, in the meantime I prepare myself for doing my phd (hopefully 2024 in Berlin).\nWith renovated energies, I'm gradually managing to find a new flow for my work and personal life. A really important part is to develop a workflow, combining project management, journaling, synchronization/backing between home and work devices, code software integration.\nI use to take notes by hand in a notebook. I have several of them filled with research logs, scientific articles notes, theory notes, ideas, day/week journals. I tried (space)emacs and org-mode a couple of years ago, learned the basics to left it completely a month later.\nNow I decided to base my workflow on digital notes. I've sneak into doom emacs with org-roam, obsidian and vscode with dendron.\nI'm inclining in favor of having a note-taking workflow integrated with vscode instead of emacs, as I program in vscode.\nSince deciding on digital note-taking systems choice paradox led to paralysis analysis. But today I finally started with a weakly planner on markdown, in any case it will be not worse than writing it on a physical notebook that will be forgotten.\nThanks for maintaining this nice community.\nAll the best\nC",

For an exam, merely repeating the material is inferior to active questioning. Repetition trains recall, while active questioning trains the very behavior of being able to give answers to questions that is required in exams.\nPerhaps this results in a hierarchy of learning methods?\nThesis: You should start with simple memory techniques and then work your way up to more complex ones.\nRepetition\nActive retrieval\nComprehension\nComment: This was part of the last note.\nThanks to the feedback, I have separated the two knowledge modules:\nthe problem of operationalization\nthe method inspired by the problem (still undeveloped).",
