In real life, records tend to be big, so the reduction is substantial.\n A dual construction can be offered for sum types: for example, a function that can take A + B can handle an A or a B as well.\n Is this less than ideal? What are the problems? In a dream world of infinite possibilities, where you can add subtyping to Haskell, how would you go about it?\n  \nI imagine there are some people here that know everything there is to know about type systems, some people that have no idea of what a type system with subtyping looks like (me — I only know C and Haskell), and many people somewhere in between.

Maybe back up any important files first. \n Give it a go and let me know what you think https://github.com/ChrisPenner/jet\n ​\n The implementation uses a zipper over a Cofree tree, which should be pretty adaptable to most recursive structures (e.g. ASTs).

For example - DList is created to be consumed partially & in a lazy fashion, while Acc is created to be a builder type that goes into full normalization to be converted into a storage type (like Vector or Seq). So every type has its own domain of application & haskell-perf/sequences currently has not enough benchmarks to show all particularities of types under different conditions of use.\n As I opened: 1.

Here are the 3 possible implementations we've considered each of them have drawbacks:\n  \nSimple data type data Version Natural Natural Natural\n \nSum type data Version = Major0Minor1Patch0 | Major0Minor2Patch0 | Major1Minor0Patch0 | Major1Minor1Patch0\n \nUse a sum type on each major minor patch version. This is the approach we are currently taking: ```haskell data Patch = Patch0 deriving (Eq, Show, Generic, Enum, Bounded)\n \n data Minor = Minor0 | Minor1 deriving (Eq, Show, Generic, Enum, Bounded)\n data Major = Major0 deriving (Eq, Show, Generic, Enum, Bounded)\n data Version = Version { major :: Major , minor :: Minor , patch :: Patch } deriving (Generic, Eq, Show) ```\n Requirements:\n Serialization/deserialization via aeson\n Complicated pattern matching\n This is important with event sourcing as some consumers may not care about minor version changes only major version changes.\n If we have a new major version and we don't handle it then we want to fail to compile.\n 1: Wouldn't give us strong compile-time guarantees. I don't know all actual versions we have.\n 2: Forces us to handle all versions even if the consumer does not care. I don't have a way to say I only care about Major versions.\n 3: Lets us handle only major version changes, and we know all possible major versions. However, we are representing a product and can introduce versions that don't really exist. e.g. if we have 0.1.0, 1.0.0, 1.1.0 then if we create a 1.2.0 we are now also representing 0.2.0.\n I'm curious if anyone has an alternative representation that might be better.

A disjoint union, as I understand, is just when you have a union of sets that have nothing shared; you \"summed\" the sets. So we imagine our List above a sort of disjoint union of Nil and Cons a (List a). Correct? What gets confusing is from a Wikipedia article on Algebraic data types :\n  \nIn set theory the equivalent of a sum type is a disjoint union, a set whose elements are pairs consisting of a tag (equivalent to a constructor) and an object of a type corresponding to the tag (equivalent to the constructor arguments).\n  \nThe disjoint union article was fairly understandable, but I'm not making the connection between my List above and this quote above about tags and constructors and constructor arguments.

To make this extensible I'd like some freer monads, more extensible effects style interface, composing the command enum like Either Op1 Op2.\n But my usecase could be seen as a mildly wonky Op-Based CRDT which means the operations commute and order doesn't matter. It would be really nice if internally I could store everything as (MVector Op1, MVector Op2)behind the scenes.\n This lead me to a number of questions:\n  \nIs there an array-of-sums representation that stores Vector (Either Op1 Op2) as (Vector Op1, Vector Op2)?\n Is there a better way to derive unboxed vector boilerplate? I have seen https://hackage.haskell.org/package/vector-th-unbox-0.2.2/docs/Data-Vector-Unboxed-Deriving.html before but it feels like DerivingVia should be able to handle it if the monad was constrained to be representational\n Are there interface ideas to manipulate unboxed vectors structurally? Say, lift projection functions like Vector (a,b) -> Vector a? In my case also things like pop one Op1 value, or take all Op2 values\n Is there an approach to structurally manipulate types in Haskell? Most code in Haskell only folds over the generic representation but e.g. StrictCheck has some tooling to add a functor at each level of a type, typescript has a bunch of tools for this like\n  \n \ntype ExtractPII<Type> = { [Property in keyof Type]: Type[Property] extends { pii: true } ? true : false; }; \n If people have ideas to any of these points I'd really like to hear about them!\n    submitted by    /u/Tarmen  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have designed a C pseudo code for the extraction function, and this what I have written so far for the extraction function in Haskell-\n In C :\n extractBits (unsigned int x, int t, int n) mask = ((1<<n)-1)<<t; unsigned int extractedBits = x & mask;\n In Haskell :\n extractBits :: Word 128 -> Integer -> Integer -> Word128 extractBits x t n = x .&. (shiftL ((shiftL 1 n) -1) t)\n The above code seems to be fine type wise. However, a suggested solution that we have for this function is as follows -\n extractBits x t n = shiftL ( x .&. (shiftL 1 n-1)) t\n Not quite sure however I think the function above does not seem to be logically the same as my implementation? They are giving different results for some values. Does it have something to do with how overflow is handled by each if these functions? \n Additionally, I am having trouble thinking about the reverse of this function and how it can be implemented.

          "description": "We are pleased to announce the release of Copilot 3.6, a stream-based DSL for writing and monitoring embedded C programs, with an emphasis on correctness and hard realtime requirements. Copilot is typically used as a high-level runtime verification framework, and supports temporal logic (LTL, PTLTL and MTL), clocks and voting algorithms.\n Among others, Copilot has been used at the Safety Critical Avionics Systems Branch of NASA Langley Research Center for monitoring test flights of drones.\n This new release supports three new operators: atan2, floor, and ceiling. Additionally, the target directory of the code generated by Copilot can now be customized. Release 3.6 also includes a battery of unit tests for the library copilot-core. This release introduces other fixes in the code and in the documentation, and deprecates definitions that have been superseded or that were largely unused.\n Current emphasis is on facilitating the use with other systems, and improving the codebase in terms of stability and test coverage. Users are encouraged to participate by opening issues and asking questions via our github repo.\n    submitted by    /u/ivanpd  \n [link]   [comments]",

Imagine something like initializing user-scoped sqlite file in the filesystem where the haskell web server binary is running (so no external \"job runner\" service) - The actions should run in separate thread (async?) - For any user, there should be at most 1 parallel copy of that action running at any given time (i.e. if user triggers 2nd copy of that action while the first is still running, the 2nd action should be skipped)\n My idea about solution so far includes: - some data structure (?) for managing bunch of locks, addressed by integers (user ids) - ensure locks are released both when the async action fails or succeeds\n Here's a dirty prototype (most likely not bug free) demonstrating what I'd like to achieve https://gist.github.com/jhrcek/5123bc0ad42522dff837be5580e9766e\n Is anyone aware of some libraries that would make this kind of thing possible?\n    submitted by    /u/JackSchpeck  \n [link]   [comments]",

It states in this capter (http://learnyouahaskell.com/for-a-few-monads-more) that there are some functions that do the same as the functions on Functors. But specifically written for Monads (e.g. liftM and fmap; ap and <*>).\n  \nWhich ones are you using?\n Is there a rule of thumb?\n Perhaps something like \"always liftM when the value is an instance of Monad and only fmap when it is an instance of Applicative and not of Monad?\"\n  \n​\n 2) There is a small task to do this tightrope walker example (http://learnyouahaskell.com/a-fistful-of-monads) with the Either type instead of the Maybe type.Thats what I did here and wondered if I could use the state Monad in combination with the Either Monad to clean up the code by avoiding all these ```first <- landLeft start second <- landLeft first etc..```\n  \nIs this possible?

There's a solution online I found (https://origin.geeksforgeeks.org/find-all-combinations-that-adds-upto-given-number-2/), but it's for other imperative languages and doesn't translate well to Haskell. I managed to write an algorithm that works (I think), but seems to be terrible inefficient for higher numbers. I think trying to parse through it would just further confuse anyone reading. I was wondering what someone more well versed in the ins and outs of Haskell would do to implement this algorithm. Thanks.\n sumCombinations :: Int -> [[Int]] sumCombinations 1 = [[1]] sumCombinations i = filter (not . any (>9)) $ initialList : (nub . map sort . collapseCombinations $ initialList) where initialList = take i $ repeat 1 collapseCombinations :: [Int] -> [[Int]] collapseCombinations xs | (length $ tail computed) == 0 = [computed] | (length $ tail computed) > 1 = computed : collapseCombinations computed ++ map ((head computed):) (collapseCombinations (tail computed)) | otherwise = computed : collapseCombinations computed where computed = (\\(y:ys) -> (y + head ys) : (ys \\\\ [head ys])) xs \n    submitted by    /u/drewshotwell  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have been considering writing several applications in haskell that are somewhat performance dependent and as previously mentioned, I would rather have them be written in haskell than not if the performance is not strongly affected by this.\n Does haskell have good graphics libraries? If so, what is the performance disadvantage it has compared to languages like C/C++? I am interested in working with something similar to Inigo Quilez work.\n What is the current status of AI research in haskell? From my very simple searching, I noticed that it's not a popular programming language in the field of AI and I am honestly confused about why that is. Perhaps someone more knowledgable about this can explain to me why a language closer to mathematics is somehow further away from the mathematical research environment.\n  \nOther than that, I would like to thank you all for keeping this subreddit alive for newcomers like me to explore & learn from!\n    submitted by    /u/Target_Organic  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "For the last two-three days, I have been trying to wrap my head around functional reactive programming. I came across threepenny-gui while I have been trying to understand the concept.\n My understanding is that the difference between reactive programming as opposed to event-driven programming is that in reactive programming, one describes the behavior of the UI as a time varying function rather than how it behaves when certain events are triggerred. For example, Spreadsheet allow for reactive programming since we can say that a certain cell is related to some other cell in terms of a certain formula -- instead of having to say [When those cells update, change this cell according to this formula]. \n When I look at the different examples included with threepenny-gui, I get the impression that they have not designed their programs reactively. For instance, if you see Mouse.hs, you see that they are saying\n  on UI.mousemove wrap $ \\xy -> element out # set text (\"Coordinates: \" ++ show xy) on UI.keydown wrap $ \\c -> element out # set text (\"Keycode: \" ++ show c) \n which binds the \\c -> element out # set text ... handler to the events. This looks like event driven programming to me, instead of reactive programming. In a reactive program, one would just say that certain fields are bound to the coordinates of the mouse.\n I have also looked at Reactive.Threepenny and I think I understand the combinators but I do not understand how to use them to actually write reactive code.\n Is my understanding correct?\n If you have suggestions on how to phrase my code as reactively as possible in threpenny-gui, that would be welcome.

          "description": "We are trying to get a working Haskell dev environment on MacOS M1, and are having various problems with the different approaches we have taken.\n Our project currently uses an older nixpkgs that comes with ghc[js]-8.6.5, but this unsurprisingly does not work and is likely a wontfix.\n The obvious choice was upgrading nixpkgs to a new version. However it seems like entering a nix-shell with ghc does not work, even for a very simple project. It complains about a broken compiler-rt-libc, and allowing for broken packages leads to a failing build of compiler-rt-libc.\n Surprisingly nix-build does work for ghc, however our project is too large for nix-build to be practical for development, as build times are on the order of an hour.\n Another problem with newer nixpkgs is that ghcjs doesn't work at all, again even on simple projects. It errors out with a complaint about the happy test suite failing.\n Yet one more problem is that while newer ghcjs on non-M1 MacOS does work, it is massively slower, taking on the order of a day to build our project, occasionally requiring restarts due to running out of file handles.\n There are also problems with running newer ghcjs versions on Ubuntu, as our project deterministically fails with an Data.Binary.Get.runGet at position 0: not enough bytes error.\n Due to the above we have been instead focusing on getting ghc-8.6.5 working on MacOS M1 without nix via Rosetta.\n However this has been very difficult due to C dependencies. We have uninstalled and reinstalled the necessary brew libraries in x86 arch mode, but cabal does not seem to be able to find them either way.\n So what I was more or less wondering was what other people have gotten working on MacOS M1, in case there is anything we can learn from that to get our project building on it.\n    submitted by    /u/Tysonzero  \n [link]   [comments]",

In my new Job, I am supposed to learn Scala and I already had a hard time understanding Generics and all such concepts. Additionally the functional way of Scala, stuff like accumulator based recursion and tail recursion, lazy variables also got my head spinning.\n I am planning to Dive even deeper into this but I wanted to know from all of you that should I rather go and learn Java or TypeScript in depth before going to Scala? Actually I don't have a lot of time grasping all of the concepts and so I began with basics of Scala and till now my experience is neither too good nor too bad.\n ​\n As of 2021 (or we can say almost 2022), what would be your advise for a beginer with statically typed language and how should I go about learning Scala so that I get a good grip in it?\n ​\n Additionally, when we say Java there are two things: 1. Pure Programming Side of Java, 2. JVM and of-course here I am not referring to the JVM side as I understand, since Scala anyways runs on JVM, that's a necessary thing. What I need to know is that do you need to go through Java Programming or any such language before getting Scala really well?\n    submitted by    /u/sedhha  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I have been using Scala and following it for years. Scala is declining in usage because Java is becoming better and Kotlin is getting pushed hard and is a smaller step for many Java developers. Personally I really love the Scala language over all the other languages I have tried. I have been following on Twitter and on Reddit and the only thing I feel is that I want to stay as far away from that mess as possible. I sugest the leaders in the comunity to travel somewhere and get a professional mediator and resolve all issues. You don't have to be friends after that but at least stop making Scala look more like daytime soap opera than an excellent comunity with smart people. You all want this to succeed. Perhaps it is more complicated and I'm being naive but from a bystanders perspective it looks pretty bad.\n The reason why I went to all the Scala conferences was because of all the smart people and the technology. Please bring back that focus and become that comunity again.\n As said before I don't have the details. I'm just describing how it looks from my perspective and others might feel different or that it's to complex to resolve these issues.\n    submitted by    /u/0OOO00000OO00O0O0OOO  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I have been working with Scala (Functional) and Clojure for the last ~ 4 years but I still can't give a proper brief answer whenever someone asks me \"Hey, what is FP and why should I use it?\" \n I generally start with concepts like immutability, local reasoning, referential transparency, functions as first class citizens, currying etc. But I soon find myself going all over the place. For example, I find myself giving unconvincing arguments when someone asks me \"what practical benefit does referential transparency actually provide to the developer?\"\n There are arguments like imperative programming depends on the order of execution of statements, while FP is declarative. But FP also depends on the order of execution (you insert into database and then read, you can't do vice-versa). Sure, you can say that \"ordering\" that we are talking about here is in the context of mutating global state. There isn't any global state in FP. But at the core of it ordering does matter right?\n Then there is the argument that immutability allows use of different cores in parallel. But I have never seen this happening in any business application, i.e, immutability used to parallelize processing. Sure, making a value immutable makes it thread safe (since no one can change it). But most real life scenarios require mutability. So we model them as Atomic, Ref etc and make them thread safe. But these things exist in imperative languages as well. So, what exactly is the connection between immutability and parallel processing & thread safety.?\n Then we have the lazy evaluation of IO which provides referential transparency. I have used IO and I love it. But I can't seem to find practical/objective points as to what benefits it provides. So when I say that all my DB operations and external API calls are an IO, I again find myself giving unconvincing answers about their benefits.\n    submitted by    /u/reflections_deams  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm designing SLinC to use cats' `Free` monad for a native effect type called NativeIO, and it's powered by Scala 3's macros and Java 17's foreign incubator.\n An example usage of SLinC is binding to stdlib.h's div method:\n C representation\n struct div_t { int quot; int rem; }; div_t div(int numerator, int denominator); \n Scala 3 binding and usage\n //scala representation of div_t struct type div_t = Struct { val quot: int val rem: int } //method binding for c stdlib's div val div = NativeIO[(Int, Int) => div_t](\"div\") //usage of our binding //Struct returns require native memory allocation, so an allocation scope is needed Native.scope( for result <- div(5,2) quot = result.quot.get rem = result.rem.get yield println(s\"quotient: $quot, remainder: $rem\") ) //natively allocated data is freed after this point .foldMap(NativeIO.impureCompiler) //compiles and runs the native kernel we just defined, prints \"quotient: 2, remainder: 1\" \n The library is still in development, so it's not as fully featured as JNA or JNR, but I'm hoping to improve it in the coming month. It's also very promising performance-wise: despite me not putting much of any effort into optimization, it's already rivaling JNR in performance, and resoundingly beats JNA.\n    submitted by    /u/markehammons  \n [link]   [comments]",

Alternatively, what's the best approach in tackling this problem with Scala?\n ​\n Disclaimer: I don't have a CS or IT background and have very little experience with pure Scala, I mostly use Spark and Python daily, but I wanted to start filling my skills gaps within the data engineering realm for a long-term goal. I think I know the difference between SAX and DOM parsing, so I was looking for something to implement the former (amirite? :D)\n ​\n Disclaimer 2: this question stems from an interview assignment that required something like this plus other features (streaming solution, JSON output), but after spending too much time just on learning the different parsing approaches I told them I wouldn't proceed: even though it's something easy for the average programmer, it clearly shows my huge gaps in knowledge and programming skills. But I still want to work on it in my own time.\n ​\n Thanks a lot in advance and sorry if it's a silly question. Cheers!\n    submitted by    /u/cyberZamp  \n [link]   [comments]",

In short: I'm not smart enough for Haskell, so I'm looking for other alternatives where immutability and pure functions are, if not mandatory, at least encouraged.\n In just a few days I hopped to Elm, Ocaml, back to Typescript and, finally, there and back again to Javascript(is programming-language hopping a thing?), after this book got me excited to give it a try. After reaching to chapter 8 with a certain hopelessness regarding (lack of) types, I ended up to this article with quite strong arguments against using JS if you want strong typing and functional proogramming facilities (\"Functional programming. Types. JavaScript. Pick two\"). The article mentioned PureScript and here I am. From Haskell syntax to strong typing, the language seems to have everything I'm looking for mentioned right at its home page.\n While learning Haskell, I liked pretty much almost everything. I really, really liked its syntax, the ways we can define types and type classes, its simplicity, and I think it was relatively easy to learn that. What got me really overburdened was how to \"change states\" and IO. From that point of view, is there something along the way that disapoint me?\n EDIT: this is being helpful: https://github.com/purescript/documentation/blob/master/language/Differences-from-Haskell.md\n    submitted by    /u/gooddevenv  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi all, is anyone using org-ql with a big number of files, probably in combination with org-roam, instead of say deft? How well does it scale to thousands of files? I know that org-agenda can get pretty sluggish around a thousand files, but it's my understanding that org-ql is faster, although maybe not that faster. Any experience? Thanks!\n NOTE: this is not for TODOs but for general search, I've seen workarounds that exclude files not containing tasks nor projects from the search, but that's not what I'm interested in, I want to search every file and ideally using more structured queries like those of org-ql (vs deft).\n EDIT: I've been experimenting a bit with this:\n  \nI cloned this big nonsense ZK which is designed to stress-test note-taking apps.\n I converted all notes from md to org using pandoc: for f in *; do pandoc --to org \"$f\" > \"${f%%.md}.org\"; done. Not really necessary for what it follows, except for the file extension part, but anyway.\n Now, searching for some text with ripgrep is very fast, as expected, for example with 56/10000 matches:\n  \n```\n  \ntime rg -c \"to queer noises\" *.org | wc -l 56\n  \nreal 0m0.317s user 0m0.195s sys 0m0.316s ```\n  \nNow with org-ql the same search setting org-directory to be the ZK folder, requiring no grouping and just random order, and doing a (regexp \"to queer noises\") freezes, at least I've been waiting for minutes now for it to end. Repeating the search in a subset of that ZK with just a few hundred notes, it ends after some seconds, but it's still borderline usable.\n  \nSo I guess the answer is a sound NO, org-ql can't be reasonably used in a setup like this one. u/github-alphapapa do you have any objection to my methodology here? Thanks!\n EDIT: deft has also been terribly sluggish with this same ZK, both in generating the deft buffer and in searching through it, so the best option seems to be something like consult-ripgrep.\n    submitted by    /u/nnenneplex  \n [link]   [comments]",

(See https://blog.tecosaur.com/tmio/2021-10-31-release.html for a great overview.)\n While my setup previously relied on org-ref for both managing .bib files and fixing LaTeX exporting, I feel like I should upgrade my configuration. I'm thinking of moving away from org-ref because the package always felt a bit too heavy (e.g. relying on helm).\n So I'm looking for inspiration. What do your setups look like? Which packages should I look into?\n Cheers\n EFLS\n    submitted by    /u/EFLS_  \n [link]   [comments]",

Even we use some plugin like org-edna/org-depend to express a dependant task of a headline h1 who isn't a descendant of h1, all functions on subtask can run only for descendant of a headline.\n For instance, what will happen if 2 projects p1 and p2 depend a same task t1. t1 is a descendant of p1. And we want know the progress of p2, the progress of t1 won't be integrated to calculation of progress of p2.\n To solve this problem, org mode should integrate the notion of symbolic link headline, like in tree based file system, we have file and symlink into a file. I don't think org mode will evolve into this direction, because it is designed to write documents. A document don't need this feature.\n What do you think about this limit of org mode to become the ideal task management?

So my workaround for this is Jupyter lab: jupyter lab --ip=0.0.0.0 --port=9090. My question is… is there any way to view plots in emacs given my setup? I’d prefer to have freedom to use emacs org mode and render plots than be forced to use Jupiter lab notebooks .\n Does anybody know, if possible, how I can display images in emacs using cloud vm?\n Thanks\n    submitted by    /u/darter_analyst  \n [link]   [comments]",

I tried rtags a few years back but it crashed frequently. When checking the state of things recently I noticed LSP was getting big so I decided to give it a try to switch full time. I installed a few more packages like lsp, helm (love it). I even read the beginner's elisp intro to understand its syntax.\n That's when the rabbit hole started and i read about spacemacs and doom emacs\n *** doom/spacemacs : an overwhelming layer *** I get the reason for those distributions : having a curated set of packages preconfigured to work together + load time optimisations for an out of the box working experience. (+vim like experience for those who like it) \n My issue was that after installing i did not know where to start. These 100+ packages must be worth learning right ? I expected a kind of interactive walkthrough like emacs's own tutorial but ended up on the web documentation instead, which was also overwhelming.\n I wonder how people who have never used emacs/vim can get started easily on this. Do they use only 1% of the available features ? Is there a master tutorial somewhere that i missed ? \n And for people who like tinkering/debugging with their config to have exactly what they want, i find it much easier on a minimalistic example than when 100+ plugins are involved.\n ** who are those distributions for ? *** I have the feeling that beginners would be better off with a simple config with discoverability improvements like which-key/helm\n And for seasoned user who like tinkering with the defaults, i find that building your config helps you understand how to use the plugin you're using\n So fellow doom/space users, what made you jump on that train ?

It would be amazing if I could use this to jump between files, rather than having to first open the correct file then searching for the function name.\n Any help or pointers appreciated!\n    submitted by    /u/emgnsles  \n [link]   [comments]",

Well, kinda worked.\n It seems that if I type out the abbrev really quickly and press M-', then it works, but inserts a dash after the needed expansion. If I type it out slowly, and then press M-', it just places the dash after the thing that I need to expand. Then, if I quickly typed the thing and expanded it with M-', I can expand it second time if I type it out and press C-x '. If I JUST type it out and press C-x ', nothing happens. I also tried doing it using hippie-expand, and it works, on the second time, printing \"Using try-expand-all-abbrevs\" in the echo area.\n I tried doing the same thing with completely clean emacs config (emacs -Q), and the results are the same.

Specifically, ,x and ,@x are translated to (\\, x) and (\\,@ x), which are without meaning outside of a backquoted list.\n That means that it is legal to define and use \\, as a function or macro:\n (defmacro \\, (body) \"Return an anonymous function. In BODY, symbols of the type $N, where N is a non-zero, positive number, represent positional arguments. $* represents a list of optional remaining arguments. ,(+ $1 $2) expands to (lambda ($1 $2) (+ $1 $2)). See `lambda'.\" (let ((total 0) rest) (cl-labels ((search (form) (if (consp form) (progn (search (car form)) (search (cdr form))) (if (eq form '$*) (setq rest t) (let ((s (prin1-to-string form))) (if (string-match \"^\\\\$\\\\([1-9][0-9]*\\\\)$\" s) (let ((n (string-to-number (match-string 1 s)))) (setq total (max total n))))))))) (search body)) `(lambda ,(append (cl-loop for n from 1 upto total collect (intern (format \"$%d\" n))) (and rest '(&rest $*))) ,body))) \n With this macro, you can replace\n (mapcar (lambda (x) (with-output-to-string (princ x))) objects) \n with\n (mapcar ,(with-output-to-string (princ $1)) objects) \n If you want your lambda to accept an unlimited number of arguments, use `$*':\n (advice-add 'some-function :before ,(dolist (x $*) (message \"%s\" x))) \n What are the downsides? Strictly, there is only one.

I hope my question makes sense. \n I regularly use remote Debian machines at work, interacting exclusively via SSH sessions. I was curious about using Emacspeak on them, as I’m visually impaired. Everything I’m reading is about setting up Emacspeak locally, though. I’ve found mention of a remote speech server, but haven’t found any guides on exactly how to get it to work. I use Windows as my primary OS at work. \n In summary, my usual workflow is: on Windows, SSH into Debian, and use a Windows screen reader to interact with the remote machine that way. If I can, I’d like to have Emacspeak running on the remote machine, with speech and sound output coming from my local Windows computer. The lag may make this unusable, I don’t know. I’d at least like to give it a shot, just to see what happens. Again, I’ve also never used Emacs in any way. I’m comfortable in Bash, though.

Second, it means that, if you sync your org files in multiple machines, you'll also have to sync the id. Finally, and this is the big one, accoring to the org manual, you assing an ID to a heading and the remote call will look for the first table under that heading. But what if you need the second table?\n Instead of fighting with the IDs problem, I decided to do some elisp magic to see if I could grab a table range from a remote table with file path and #:name. To my surpirse, it was very easy to do. All you need is this function somewhere in your init file:\n (defun j/remote-table-range (path name range) (with-current-buffer (find-file-noselect path) (org-table-get-remote-range name range))) \n Then, you have to add the #:name tag to the remote table:\n ;; Contents of ~/table-test/remote.org #+name: remote-t1 | C1 | C2 | | 1 | 2 | \n Then, from another table, you can call it like this:\n ;; Contents of ~/table-test/main.org | C1 | C2 | | | | #+tblfm: @1$1='(j/remote-table-range \"./remote.org\" \"remote-t1\" (string ?@ ?1 ?$ ?1)) \n The path can be absolute or relative, and you can reference any table in that file using the name argument. The wierd string call is explained here.\n And that's it. IMO, while it makes for longer formulas, it is way more convenient than the current remote function with IDs and have less limitations. \n I was amazed with how little code was needed for this. Man, do I love emacs...\n    submitted by    /u/ElCondorHerido  \n [link]   [comments]",

I didn't want to go with Spacemacs or Doom Emacs. \n Configuring init.el file got me thinking - What are all those functions? I know that ELisp is a dialect of a programming language called LISP, but knowing many languages ELisp seems so strange. It's absolutely peculiar. \n You all know that Python has been considered a \"pseudo code\" language in which you almost tell in human English what do you want to achieve.I actually believe that ELisp falls under that description much better. \n I don't understand what all those functions are doing below the surface. It seems to me that if I'd want to make a AI Chess game by my own rules, that the only thing I'd need to write in ELisp, would be: \n  \n(setq AI-chess-my-own-rules t) \n  \nAnd that would be it.\n Can I see the implementation of each function I have put in my init.el?How does, for example: \n  \n(load theme 'doom-gruvbox) \n  \nwork? \n Can I see the implementation? Or (scroll-bar-mode -1)? How does that work? Does that tells the X to stop drawing the scroll-bar in Emacs? What is the language that those functions are written in, and where could I see, inside or outside of Emacs, the implementation of it? \n And how is it possible that I can type a name of any function written in ELisp and it will just work? Aren't there any libraries? How does that work? \n I believe these are trivial questions for you, but I am really new in this. I fell in love with the Org mode, but Emacs seems so strange. I got used to parenthesis, I get it - That's the syntax. Fine. I don't have a problem with it. But it's absolutely different than any other language I've ever used. \n Thanks in advance for replies. :)\n    submitted by    /u/aqua_cap  \n [link]   [comments]",

However after it appears to be done, the Emacs frame is just...stuck. It's a blank frame. No *scratch* buffer, just a blank GTK frame. I'm running Emacs with emacs --debug-init for now, and calling kill -USR2 [the emacs pid] will bring it back. Sort of. The GTK frame is still blank, but if I press a key, the scratch buffer appears. Granted, it just freezes up again. My best guess is that it's related to garbage collection, but I wouldn't be sure how to tell.\n Native compilation\n So while I was using Doom Emacs, native compilation did make Emacs perform a bit better. However having moved away from Doom, I don't have the benefit of the compilation process being printed out anywhere when packages are update. Doom has a bunch of functions to have a CLI program, but all I really want is to be able to see if and when there's a problem in the native compilation process.

I found some rough edges that I have been trying to smooth out and wanted to share a particularly simple one. \n The EXWM wiki suggets merging framemove with windmove to move between workspaces on two different monitors. I found that framemove considers not just visible workspaces but also inactive (invisible) workspaces. Imagine the following setup\n Monitor 1: assigned workspaces 0 and 1; currently showing workspace 1\n Monitor 2: assigned workspaces 2; currently showing monitor 2. Focus is on workspace 2. \n Trying to move across frames using framemove could actually cause focus to not just switch to monitor 1 but also monitor 1 to change from showing workspace 1 to workspace 0. \n Turns out it was pretty simple to modify framemove to restrict to only considering currently active frames using the predicate function `exwm-workspace--active-p`. \n ​\n In case anyone else runs into this issue take a look at my forked version of framemove: https://github.com/jsilve24/framemove. \n ​\n Honestly, it seems rediculous that I forked this repo since my contribution is essentially nil. That said, I really wasn't sure a better way since the original library is on the emacswiki and also maintained by the emacsmirror github user. \n ​\n That said, hope this helps someone else.\n ​\n Cheers.\n    submitted by    /u/JustinSilverman  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I am annoyed that when I C-g out of my expand-region session my cursor does not return to its original location.\n In trying to resolve this annoyance I found that expand-region comes with a variable er/save-mode-excursion that is described as:\n  \nA function to save excursion state while expanding\n  \nI set this variable to (lambda (&rest body) () (save-excursion body)) and I found that this does not suit my needs for the following reasons.\n  \nThis variable does not seem to effect any er/ commands outside of er/expand-region. For example if I do er/mark-defun and then hit C-g my cursor position is not returned.\n I often use a key-chord bound to (lambda () (interactive) (execute-kbd-macro (read-kbd-macro \"\\C-g\"))). When I use this key-chord instead of actually hitting C-g my cursor position is not returned. I do not understand why this is.\n  \nNext I tried taking advantage of the deactivate-mark-hook to programatically hit C-u C-SPC.\n (add-hook 'deactivate-mark-hook #'(lambda () (let ((current-prefix-arg 4)) (call-interactively 'set-mark-command)))) \n This works great for my non expand-region region endeavours but when I try to use any er/ commands I get unpredictable behavior. I believe the problem is that expand-region resets the mark multiple times and therefore deactivate-mark-hook is called multiple times.\n My next idea is to make my own expand-region-minor-mode where I can probably solve this problem.

(I would like to also have a vterm in the remote directory, but it doesn't work; anyways, this is for another post).\n I tried this simple function, but didn't work either.\n (defun run-my-vterm () (interactive) (let* ((buffer \"vterm\")) (require 'vterm) (if (buffer-live-p (get-buffer buffer)) (switch-to-buffer buffer) (vterm)) (vterm-send-string (concat \"cd \" \"~\")) (vterm-send-return))) \n It seems like vterm tries to open the terminal in the remote location but doesn't succeed. \n A workaround I use is to jump to scratch buffer and launch vterm from there, or use ansi-term.\n    submitted by    /u/MhvxvLvJrg  \n [link]   [comments]",

When you're done editing the element, you can do C-c C-c to dismiss the *Calc Edit* buffer and the original calc buffer will now have your edited element on the stack.\n However, on a version of Emacs I built off the emacs-28 branch about a week ago, also with emacs -q, calling calc-edit will instead bring up the *Calc Edit* buffer in a separate window, while the original calc buffer is still visible. Then, after editing the element and doing C-c C-c, the window layout becomes messed up: the original calc buffer remains at the bottom, but now there's another calc buffer and *Calc Trail* buffer in the place of where the *Calc Edit* buffer was. I attached an image to show what this layout looks like.\n Since this happens with emacs -q, it seems like it could be a bug, but searching around online doesn't show anyone else bringing it up, so maybe it's either a recent bug, or could it just be me? Can anyone confirm this behavior?\n This is all on macOS, by the way.\n ​\n https://preview.redd.it/pm14mfu5bv081.png?width=2606&format=png&auto=webp&s=f22d20d275a62dce7bc268a58acb98fd2deec086\n    submitted by    /u/Comfortable-Bit3236  \n [link]   [comments]",

However, this approach starts to break down in more complicated scenarios, such as:\n (local-leader-def :keymaps 'org-mode-map \"a\" '(:ignore t :wk \"attachments\") \"a a\" 'org-attach \"a d\" '(:ignore t :wk \"deletion\") \"a d d\" 'org-attach-delete-one \"a d G\" 'org-attach-delete-all \"r\" '(:ignore t :wk \"refile\") \"r r\" 'org-refile) \n First, this is kind of ugly - Org has a ton of features, and I try to use a lot of them, so some of my key sequences can get pretty long. I end up retyping the same prefix many, many times, sometimes with multiple layers of the (:ignore t :wk \"foo\") trick (as seen above).\n Second, (and more annoyingly, IMO) doing it this way \"shadows\" the which-key description for modes which share a prefix. That is, if I'm in ledger mode and type \"SPC m\", it yields the suggestion \"r -> refile\" instead of \"r -> ledger-report\" as it should.\n I've been futzing around with general's \":prefix-command\" and related facilities to try and figure out a way of avoiding this second issue, but so far I haven't been able to get anything to work. Since my current strategy is ad hoc and not based on any best practices I'm aware of, I thought I'd ask here if there's a canonical/idiomatic way of using general's capabilities to define groups of similarly-prefixed commands without breaking which-key.\n (Also, why is there a distinction between :prefix-command and :prefix-map?

          "description": "Hi everyone,\n I've been diving into learning some emacs over the last week or so as I'm interested in possibly switching over from using neovim (primarily because I want org-mode). I've been deep diving into a lot of new things and trying to set up alternatives for my major nvim workflows, but one that I've been having a ton of trouble with is searching and the previews for it in particular. In my projects I make heavy use of Telescope within neovim and one of the major reasons that I love it is the ability to preview grep results from files in my project directory within a separate window. I like being able to get more context from the search without actually opening up a new buffer. I've set up Ivy and Counsel and was trying to get the same functionality working, but I'm having a heck of a time with previewing. The closest I've come is realizing that after using counsel-projectile-rg that I can use ivy-next-line-and-call functionality to move the current buffer through the search results with C-M n or C-M p, however, that actually opens the buffer and populates my buffer list. Does anyone know if there's some sort of functionality to open a new preview window and navigate through those search results in it by default with C-j (I'm using evil mode). Essentially I'd always like this type of preview whenever I'm doing searches. Also, I'm not attached to any particular completion or search framework, so if this is easier in something like Helm then I'd be open to solutions from that as well.

But if I was in javascript, and I press \"SPC l\" it would bring up my javascript bindings.\n However I'm not sure how to implement that. I'm a bit of a emacs noob to be honest.\n Is there some other recommended way to deal with this? I'm open to other ways of organizing.\n Another idea I thought of is to create another level of prefix keys under \"l\" where each key would bring up the keybindings for a given language. So maybe \"SPC l j\" would bring up the javascript menu, and \"SPC l s\" would bring up the scheme menu. This is something I probably could do without too much trouble, but I prefer the first approach.\n Any help appreciated, thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/chillpenguin99  \n [link]   [comments]",

I keep this in the same document I maintain my work log. Recently I extracted this functionality into a package to clock in/out, and reports a summary of the last time: as well as accumulating all available times (which I use to show the time worked in a week). Link to the utimeclock repo. Locally I have the mode-line display the accumulated time for the day & week which I quite like. Although this would need some more work to split out from my init file (see this question) since it's piggy backing on which-function. ---- Before creating the package I checked on other time tracking utilities, as far as I can tell they're more verbose, and don't fit so easily into editing a text document which happens to contain a time log.

          "description": "Hello /r/emacs,\n recently I've been working a lot with tables (with text rather than numbers), and for the first time in years I came to the conclusion that Emacs is not the best tool for a task (especially one it could in principle be good at), and thus for now I'm doing my tables in Google Docs. \n table.el is in principle suitable, but \n  \nit is not snappy,\n having multiple lines per cell requires empty lines between them, otherwise they will be collapsed into a single line (since I need multiple lines per cell I can't use the org-mode table editor)\n it has its own separate mode which doesn't work well with org-mode (particularly I'm missing lists and org-ref links)\n it is easy to mess up the table structure by accidentally typing on the lines,\n it cannot temporarily hide rows or columns (a Google Sheets feature I didn't expect to be so handy) and\n both navigating around and repositioning columns and rows is rather tedious.\n  \nOf course it is still a great piece of software, but I think it can be improved. I'll start to tinker with it soon-ish, but my elisp knowledge isn't the greatest, so I thought I'd ask here if anybody has ideas where to start. In particular, I have the hunch that child frames can be used to address the lack of snappiness, the empty lines issue and the lack of org-mode integration, but I haven't used them much myself, so perhaps someone with more experience has thoughts about their appropriateness. Also if there are other ideas how to improve editing text tables I'd love to hear them.\n Cheers!\n    submitted by    /u/swhalemwo  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi folks,\n Yesterday, I finished up putting my first custom keyboard together. It comes with a lot of extra keys, a couple of which are bound to 'Hyper' by default. 'Hyper' is a 'modifier' provided by QMK (the firmware that powers this board) that maps to pressing 'Control-Alt-Super-Shift' all together. Because there are no default mappings in the Hyper space, it seems like a good place to put some global Emacs shortcut keys that will absolutely-for-sure not ever get clobbered.\n While it would be easier to bind C-M-s-<foo> instead of H-<foo> and get more or less the same effect, I would like to be able to utilize C-x @ h (event-apply-hyper-modifier) as an option to 'gracefully degrade' on computers where I don't have my keyboard (for example: the Chromebook I occasionally play with Emacs on). That way those global binds can stay available and reasonably within reach. It doesn't seem possible to chain C-x @ mod application functions together, but even if it were possible, chaining 4 of them together would get really old really quickly.\n I would prefer for this to get handled by Emacs instead of getting handled by the OS, just for that extra level of 'don't need to account for some random specific machine configuration', but I'm open to suggestions on what to do there if no good options exist on the Emacs level. My main machine (the one the keyboard lives at) runs mostly Fedora Workstation, and sometimes Windows 10 Pro (though I almost never use Emacs in Windows).\n Thanks, all.\n    submitted by    /u/SoraFirestorm  \n [link]   [comments]",

Using TERM=\"xterm-256color\" changes nothing, and in fact using TERM=\"xterm\" is slightly better (in the sense that it's closer to the original theme).\n I suspect something fishy is happening though, as the real issues set in after I agree to run the Lisp from these themes. For example, let's say I'm running wombat theme but want to switch to taylor. Everything looks fine (or what I consider fine) in wombat, I navigate up to taylor and hit enter, the colors change to something that looks nice but probably isn't Taylor (maybe some previous selection that isn't wombat), but then as soon as I allow the Lisp from Taylor to run, I get an absolutely horrible scheme that is almost unreadable.\n All appears well in GUI Emacs, but I am not interested in using that unfortunately.\n I have also tried other, more esoteric settings for the TERM variable, but to no avail.

The changes are:\n - The background is now vectorized and sports a slight shadow at the sides and bottom, this is based on a svg template for Big Sur icons. It should be easy to make the background circular or squircular for those of you that prefer so.\n - I further smoothed the curves by removing extra degrees of freedom.\n - The logo shadow is now blurry and less opaque.\n - There is a subtle radial gradient that spotlights the logo and turns darker near the edges.\n - The upper and lower halves of the logo are slightly more proportionate.\n I've learned the basics of Inkspace and, against my expectations, I actually enjoyed using it :)\n I'm sharing a png image and its svg source (not permalinks, sorry, I promise to keep them online for some weeks at least).\n - png: https://drive.google.com/file/d/14BDnwlGa17ds0CZI1kNBNghqt4TSqVEl/view?usp=sharing\n - svg: https://drive.google.com/file/d/14L_roGCSD9dMnhL4Cq3w2_sfP4vvlk0_/view?usp=sharing\n Hope you like it.\n ​\n https://preview.redd.it/pqs4wh1n05z71.png?width=2048&format=png&auto=webp&s=d524e936fa57d86656b0e49444cf6b369da6e46c\n    submitted by    /u/nnenneplex  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello! I am a new user of emacs, and really exploring the configuration options around. But I just found some very annoying aspects that are driving me crazy.\n First:\n How on earth can I just use tabs in a sane way?\n In VSCode I found tabs pretty smart. Press the key once, and it dropped you on the correct indentation level for the line, press it more times and it inserted spaces to your liking. In emacs apparently the default behavior stops at the first part, but for example, in PHP I'm writing a SQL string and to avoid wraping I press enter, but then it goes to the beginning of the line and if I press tab it just won't work because it thinks it is still at the correct level of indentation. and to correct the string I have to press space for doing so. I have no idea how to search for this in google, and the few posts I found give no solution whatsoever, and some say \"just get used to it\".\n Second:\n Are modes always \"wonky\"? For example, I am writing PHP at the moment, and web mode is pretty deficient for it, inserting a \">\" character when I write \"<\" in a comparison because it thinks I'm writing an html tag. For that I installed PHP-mode, and now... formatting the file is impossible because it says that clang-formatter is not found. For web mode I installed Apheleia, and it works fine, but now I can't use it with PHP-mode. So how can I configure it so it works?\n And when I was just using web-mode, it suddenly, and apparently at random, just go back to fundamental mode. And had to enable web-mode manually several times. This is what made me install PHP-mode in the first place.\n I hope someone has an idea of how to fix this stuff, or at least point me in the right direction.

          "description": "Hej fellow 'macsers,\n TL;DR: wanna compile a number of lists (tracklists to show friends, one list per year), maybe in a kind of database. I want duplicates to be detected. Ideally, I want the ability to export to a nice-looking format. Package tips, programming suggestions, everything welcome. Thanks :)\n I have a somewhat unconventional taste of music - at least when compared to my friends. I rarely play music I enjoy personally other than some beat tapes which are simply lit when hangin' out together.\n Now, I have been asked by one friend of mine to compile a list of music that I have enjoyed throughought the year. Since I actually enjoy sharing/discussing music, I agreed. So I compiled a list of songs - free form, no format etc. \n However, I've been wondering: I might be doing this every year from now on. First off, it was a bit tedious to do the freeform entry. Secondly, and more important, I don't want to manually search for duplicates when compiling my 2022 list. Finally, it would be nice if I could have this list (or a subset of such a list) exported either in a nice-looking pdf or in some other conventient form. \n Then, I thought to myself: well, since you can do practically everything with emacs, why shouldn't it be able to help me out this time?\n Thus, I'd love to hear your thoughts on the matter. It might be some kind of database thingy that is able (programmably) to detect duplicates. It might be a program that does EXACTLY what I want. It might be a hint on how to do autonumbering on an unformatted file. It might be a tip on how to automate the \"finding duplicates\" process. Anything, really :)\n Thanks a bunch, have a good day, fellows! :)\n    submitted by    /u/olivuser  \n [link]   [comments]",

It works beautifully for Chrome, with evaluation of code, inspection, REPL, etc. but only up to a point.\n  \nWhen it comes to Node, I've no success. I can start the node server but I cannot connect to it. I'm not sure it starts the node server correctly; in the documentation it says that you can start the node server manually and then connect to it, but the code says otherwise (it always asks if you want to close the previous connection, doing nothing if you chose `no`, starting a new server if you choose `yes`)\n Evaluating TypeScript code leads to errors, even though the documentation and the discussions that I've seen lead to the impression that evaluating TypeScript should be no different than evaluating JavaScript code.\n Async functions cannot be evaluated with `indium-eval-last-node` since it only evaluates the code after the `function` token, ignoring the `async` token, which leads to the error that `await` cannot be used in non-async functions.\n The Indium setup documentation references functions that are no longer available, like `M-x indium-connect-to-nodejs`\n the last commit is from March 2021 and there are still open issues from 2017 and no responses from the developer\n  \nDeveloping such a huge and nice package is surely overwhelming.

          "description": "Are there good options for automatically adjusting text size for a frame based on the current display?\n I didn't find anything so I made a small package textsize that currently fits my needs quite well. It automatically chooses a font point size for the default face for the current frame, based on:\n  \nmonitor resolution: if it's lower res, typically want a smaller point size\n pixel pitch: higher point size on finer pitch screens\n manual per-frame adjustment available to shift the calculated value\n  \nFor me there is one current omission where automatic adjustment is fired via window-size-change-functions, which does not fire if the resolution is unchanged. e.g. Going from my 1080p laptop to a 1080p external. The only options I've seen for that require polling, which feels kind of distasteful. Anyone know of triggers I might catch for that?\n I could add rules around monitor size and/or frame size, though personally I haven't particularly wanted it. The manual adjustment is available for transient needs.\n I'd welcome comments both on the functionality, how I achieved it.\n  \nIs this reinventing another wheel I didn't find? This EmacsWiki page outlines some details but I didn't see automatic adjustment.\n \nI feel like my coding of 'thresholds' is clunky and a little obtuse - are the Elisp examples of something similar that's cleaner and clearer?\n \nMy default pixel pitch thresholds are guesses, as my day-to-day doesn't have a lot of variation on that.\n \n If you want to try it, load textsize.el and run (textsize-setup), and move things between disparate monitors (providing their resolution isn't the same!). Tweak the customizations and let me know if you think the defaults could be better or if you would want other rules.\n I can put it on MELPA if there's interest, but I feel like it could do with a bit more depth.\n    submitted by    /u/wjcferguson  \n [link]   [comments]",

These include:\n  \nMoving messages between folders and deleting messages.\n Multiple accounts and automatic context switching. In mu4e, when replying to an email the correct email account is used.\n Viewing messages from a search without the related messages in a thread. The tree-view includes all messages in a thread (and is not aligned correctly by default) and the non-tree view shows a list of threads rather than messages.\n  \nDoes anyone have a configuration that implements these features?\n Finally, to be able to use tags, I am wondering if there's a way to sync notmuch's arbitrary tags with the mail server.

When using `lsp-ui`, the documentation viewer, which appears in a childframe, causes a blank frame to be created when emacs is in full screen.

For instance, this method in the worg tutorials is often suggested, but it seems to be for org-mode < v8.0.\n An alternative I've tried is to use #+SETUPFILE:~/my_template.org, which is a file that contains various #+LATEX_HEADER:\\usepackage{} lines.

Right now I think I don't have too many struggles but that's probably because Ive just made the file and have all the keybinds set up and read all the documentation of dozens of packages, if I ever dont use a leybind but remember vaguely how it starts, it would be awesome not to use some find functions or scouting my emacs file and or package files for the answer. \n Sorry for slightly over explaining, help would be appreciated, thanks for your time.\n    submitted by    /u/MightyMerl  \n [link]   [comments]",

Elisp is fun enough to code in, however one thing I find somewhat daunting is putting things into a buffer so that it looks nice.\n I am sure there must be some higher level \"widget\" or tui libraries out there that speed up that process without fiddling with manual placement of text and text properties, faces etc. I would really love to collect together some libraries here that you know. I couldn't find another comprehensive resource for this.\n To make a start, here are some I'm aware of:\n  \nmagit-section: Create a ui like magit\n Taxy: Uses magit-section but in some cases makes it even more convenient and fast to put data into a buffer\n Tabulated List Mode: Not to forget the built-ins, tabulated list mode can also help setting up a buffer really fast if a tabulated list is all one needs\n Hierarchy: Put hierarchical data into a buffer with several convenience functions to display, query and action callbacks. Seems to be merged to emacs and even though the library is there, there is not documentation in the Elisp or Emacs manuals, so the git repo README is still useful for documentation.\n tree-widget.el: There seems to be a tree-widget.el in emacs core, seems this also can be used to build trees in buffers but I haven't used it and there seems to be no documentation in the Elisp or Emacs manuals about it so I don't really know how useful it is.\n  \n   submitted by    /u/editar  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I've been working over the last week to read and process for my ZK a particular book.  It contains about 40 short articles by different authors with \"inspirational\" messages and discussions of life experiences.  I created a zettel for each article (these were fairly short, mostly one- or two-idea articles).  After a while, I created a structure note for the book, grouping and linking to each zettel/article.\nSo far, so good - normal use of a structure note.  The little \"aha\" moment came as follows...\nAt the end of each zettel, (because the zettel contained an inspirational idea), I added a \"What will I do?\" question.  I didn't want to just capture the idea, I wanted to see if I could incorporate it into my life in some useful manner.  The \"aha\" thought was to copy that question and its short answer from each zettel and paste that after the reference to the corresponding zettel on the structure note.  That way, I can simply scan down the structure note occasionally to remind myself of what I wanted to do, check my progress, pick out one item on which to focus for a few days, etc.\nSo the structure note became a way of reviewing my follow-up actions.  This is a simple addition that I've made to one structure note, and perhaps in retrospect, it is so evident as to be painfully obvious.  But it both simplifies and enhances the way that I interact with my ZK.  I have previously written zettels about various philosophies (regarding ethical behaviour) and have a few structure notes related to those.  If time permits, I may give them the same treatment.\nAs an aside, I did ask a question about this process before (of acting on ideas we bring into our ZK), which received a few interesting comments.

I use my Zettelkasten for maintaining references that are actually in use but Zotero holds lots of unused and unmaintained references (i.e. not in my ZK), especially webpages that i store offline just in case the source is changed or unavailable.\nIn Zotero it is easy to find duplicates which is the only maintenance i do. Zotero allows creating folders, tags to help with search but i find maintaining two separate systems is too much effort. I also don't worry much about unused references because i don't see them as backlog, they're just collecting dust. But i know there is good stuff in it and occasionally i'd simply like to dig into it and add something interesting to my Zettelkasten.\nI think what would be most helpful to me is a list of unused references sorted by creation date or in general allow communication between both systems for maintenance purpose only.\nIn previous discussions others mentioned that they use \"The Internet Archive\" to store webpages or don't store webpages in their RMS at all and instead paste the URL to the note1. Some are maintaining a reading list.\nAny thoughts on maintenance?\nhttps://forum.zettelkasten.de/discussion/1470/how-do-you-deal-with-reference-material-such-as-discussions-tweet-threads-forum-posts-etc&#160;↩︎",

But, I'd have to change the tags manually since the Tag Wrangler plugin won't let me add those characters. And that can take some time.\nI could use Obsidian's tag: search operator. Instead of searching for #idea, I type tag:idea and get what I want.

          "description": "I did a little searching on the forum and didn't find a whole lot about this idea. (the main thing I found was someone's setup for creating journal entries) A lot of new note-taking applications (e.g.: Roam, Craft) have the idea of creating a dedicated note for specific days of the year when you access the application. This allows for easy access to journaling, creating stuff that you'll see on specific days, idea entry that you can sort later, etc. which I personally find to be quite nice. I don't necessarily always have some specific title in mind for something I want to write about, or even links to other things.\nThis seems to be a bit at odds with how The Archive wants to nudge you into adding to your Zettelkasten. And just basically somewhat opposed to the idea of creating atomic notes that are heavily interlinked, since it's more of a scattered \"note\" that might just have thoughts about stuff on a specific day. But I also wouldn't want to give up the ability to link to things in my Zettelkasten (and have stuff in separate locations, because goodness knows I've used a lot of applications and have notes scattered everywhere), or searchability across everything, because I want to write stuff related to specific days. (I have made at least one note in the style of the linked post, using just YYYYmmdd, which maybe just solves the issue but I haven't done much with that idea yet so I'm not sure how it might work out long term)\nDoes anybody have experience working with \"Daily Notes\" in The Archive/Zettelkastens in general?

Most of them were of the type \"This is a note about object X, this is another note about object X, I can sense a connection!\", which is a link type better encapsulated with a tag. Because of that I got few insights over the months I had been using the method.)",

          "description": "I've seen advice here that says every note needs to be linked to at least two other notes. I followed this advice and got a bunch of feedback loops and not a lot of structure. I started giving myself permission to use Structure Notes as much as I want, and I find these structure notes to be much more helpful than direct links from one note to the next.\nIf I have a stream of thought that spans 10 notes, I find it easier to back to the structure note to click through each note than to do a whole bunch of to/from links in each note.\nAnybody else experience this? Anything I'm missing out by not linking directly?",

          "description": "I recently came across my old cluster of Zettels on Scott Young's Drilldown Method. I thought at first that his method would only be helpful to enhance my Zettelkasten workfow. It turns out that it's helpful for practicing skills too.\nHowever, I'm stuck with one Zettel where I cite him making a weak argument to establish the goal of one of the stages. I'm not sure what to do with it. I'm confident in that I can improve it, but should I get rid of his or keep it?\nAny hints would be much appreciated.",

One person described the book he read as \"a chaotic mess...It read, in my opinion, like something written by a sentient library catalog, full of disordered and tangential insights, loosely related to one another.\"\nWhile I know that a great guitar builder can be a terrible guitarist, I wonder if it matters that the \"founding father\" of the Zettelkasten system wrote books that felt disorganized and random.\n[And I understand Luhmann wasn't writing for the masses but for the sociology community, so maybe his writing was par for the academic course.]",
