          "description": "I've been writing a few toys (e.g. some CLI tools, a simulator, etc.) in Haskell over the last year and a bit and loved it, but am now trying to write a fuller application and have run into an area which I don't know how to handle well in Haskell: error states.\n For example, I want to read a configuration file, parse the YAML, and select a portion out of it. This can fail in the following ways:\n  \nthe configuration file might be absent;\n the configuration file might be invalid;\n the specific key I'm looking for might not be found (there's part of my configuration described as Map String Subconfig and I want to pull a named Subconfig out).\n  \nData.Map's lookup uses Maybe to handle the error case, which is how I've mostly done this before, but Data.Yaml has decodeThrow and decodeEither. I'm pretty comfortable with Either but throwing is something I know from other languages, but not Haskell.\n Looking at this from the perspective of the problem domain, I'd be fine if the missing config file just caused the programme to immediately exit, and likewise if the config was malformed or missing the required key, but I can imagine cases in which I'd like to handle these errors a bit more elegantly.\n I've been looking for good resources (beyond Hackage) for how MonadThrow (or the whole throw/catch) is supposed to look in Haskell, and how people handle errors, but haven't found any good examples which are also beginner-friendly.\n Any tips?\n    submitted by    /u/gtf21  \n [link]   [comments]",

The magic comes from stimes, which exponentiates a semigroup element in log(n) time, where n is the exponent. This works in any semigroup or monoid, because it depends on factorization of the exponent, an integer, not on any special properties of the semigroup/monoid itself. I tried it giving Fib strict fields, but doing so seemed to actually slow it down, paradoxically. Admittedly, my testing was brief and rudimentary, so I'm happy to be proven wrong.\n ...\n So, the billionth Fibonacci number... I won't paste it here, because it takes 200M to store in a text file.\n daniel@newport:~/Desktop $ ghc -O2 fibonacci.hs [1 of 1] Compiling Main ( fibonacci.hs, fibonacci.o ) Linking fibonacci ... daniel@newport:~/Desktop $ echo 1000000000 | time ./fibonacci > fib-1000000000.txt 88.41 real 85.37 user 2.52 sys daniel@newport:~/Desktop $ ls -l fib-1000000000.txt -rw-r--r-- 1 daniel staff 200M Aug 13 18:25 fib-1000000000.txt \n But you can see it in my dropbox if you're interested.\n Edit: As this helpful comment points out, it's not constant space. We know this immediately since Integer grows in size. What I mean is it only holds onto the three integers, rather than a memoized list or something. What's the actual term/claim I want to make, then, or is there even any term for it? Sorry for the confusion.\n    submitted by    /u/friedbrice  \n [link]   [comments]",

It's because I am writing a library where, given a data structure (in this case a parser definition), we can precompile parts of this parser but not everything. This means that to fully build the parser we need to evaluate the parser definition both at compile-time and at run-time.\n The 'simple' way to do this, is to ask people using the library to call the library as compileParser myparser 'myparser. But this is of course horrible for the end-user, and easy to do wrong.\n So instead, I am looking for a way to just have compileParser 'myparser work.\n    submitted by    /u/qqwy  \n [link]   [comments]",

I am about to graduate with a degree in electrical engineering and minor in math and am trying to figure out some jobs I'd potentially like to pursue. \n So my question is: what is the timeline for becoming a Scala developer like? I have experience in many object oriented programming languages (Java, Python, C, C++, C#, etc) but I would not say I am an excellent programmer in any of these languages. I do not know a whole lot about computer science in general either. So how long could it take to be knowledgable enough to actually be hired as a beginning developer? A year of coding in Scala? 6 months? What other relevant knowledge would be necessary or desirable as a beginning developer? Is it difficult to get entry level jobs a Scala developer? Generally I'm interested in the road map of becoming a Scala developer, so if anyone could answer some of these questions I'd appreciate it.\n    submitted by    /u/okdudeface  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "If you have any neat tricks to bootstrap from an org file, do share. I came up with a neat solution below, but am having a slight isssue.\n As the ideal in literate programming paradigm, org should be capable of bootstrapping arbitrary projects, without the user knowing or using emacs. After MUCH trial and error, I finally came up with a shebang that will tangle a file, though it depends on the current working directory/filename:\n #! emacs --eval=(progn (find-file \"this-file.org\") (org-mode) (org-babel-tangle)) \n However, when emacs detects itself in the magic string, it opens the document in Emacs-Lisp Mode instead of org mode. Basically, when you execute the file, it opens correctly, but when you open the file normally, you must invoke (org-mode). Anyone have a fix/other ideas?\n    submitted by    /u/Zakrahn  \n [link]   [comments]",

All tutorials I've seen online just show small examples which is OK... I understand everyone will come up with a different workflow, but I'd love some inspiration. For instance do you all:\n 1) Use one big calendar file and just throw events into it unsorted? 2) Use some sort of sorted calendar file? If so, how do you sort it... By year, then month, then day? This is confusing because scheduled dates seem to be children of the parent title, so it doesn't seem logical to organize events this way. 3) Do you use org journal in some way for this?\n I'd also love to know how you integrate your scheduled events with scheduled to-dos... Are they one in the same place?\n Finally, is there some web resource with some example layouts or workflows?\n Really looking forward to getting into this.

          "description": "Hello!\n I've recently started using org-mode for taking down notes for my a couple of CS based courses and I'm loving it so far! Using a neat hierarchical structure. However, there's one important feature that I'd like, which I haven't been able to do in org-mode.\n As I'm typing down notes, I would like to select a particular sentence/phrase and mark it as an important \"note\" to remember. This is analogous to highlighting a piece of text. Later, I would like to retrieve/display the important notes, that I have marked.\n While I understand that having Tags in headlines solves this issue (where I can set the tag to IMPORTANT), it works only at headline level and not at a text level. Additionally, the simple formatting features like bold/italics etc do not really help/make the text stand out.\n Is there a tool/package/anything that can do something like this? Where I can essentially select a sentence/phrase from my notes, and mark as important and search later? If not, how do org-mode users highlight some text, sort of like a 'callout' block?\n I wouldn't mind the piece of text to be a separate \"block\", if it is a feasible solution as well. It need not be part of a paragraph, however, it doesn't make sense to be a headline.\n Thanks.\n ​\n A small snippet attached here. Would like the selected portion to be marked as \"important\". \n Image Query\n    submitted by    /u/ThreeForElvenKings  \n [link]   [comments]",

How can I prevent this in the future or minimize this phenomenon's appearance?\n Still on my quest towards properly working calendar/address book synchronisation, I stumbled upon a problem that I've had several times over the last years and which drove me crazy each time because I knew neither what caused the issue or what I could do to solve it. Most puzzlingly, I seems to happen on and off.\n So the general problem is that important keybindings, such as C-x C-c, get overwritten by other programs. Presently, I am struggling because org-agenda-diary-entry has eaten my diary-insert-entry when in the calendar. I have tried I have tried everything I believe possible: I had my straight package manager recompile all my packages several times, to no avail. I've used rgrep to look if I had this function defined somewhere in my config files or bound it myself, no. I've removed all Org content from my configuration, didn't help.\n Now, I am interested in two kinds of suggestions: first, how can I prevent this from happening? second, what can I do when something like that happens (especially when it is a context-sensitive binding)?\n Thanks a bunch, have a good day :)\n EDIT: What I forgot to mention in OP is that it is not simply about one function that has been re-bound - e.g. diary-insert-entry -, but the prefix key 'i' (for 'i'nsert) in diary. I don't know if that makes a difference regarding a possible solution, but I felt like it is a different problem I failed to mentioned.\n I was able to resolve this issue by myself. I simply re-installed emacs and now it works again. However, I would prefer to learn how to avoid such 'drastic' measures in the future. \n    submitted by    /u/olivuser  \n [link]   [comments]",

It feels slightly clunky in some respects, and I really don't like how it can't scroll between pages in continuous way (instead you jump to the next page when you hit the bottom... also from some research this behaviour is unavoidable due to constraints inherent to Emacs)\n Is there some way to open Okular (or any external PDF reader tool) side by side with emacs, such that there is a way to jump to particular pages in the PDF from within emacs? What would a solution look like and it is it feasible to program myself (I have some experience programming, and would be happy putting the time in, I just need general direction to get me started).\n Many thanks,\n Lamasland\n ​\n (btw this is another thread of me explaining what I'd like, but it includes pictures https://org-roam.discourse.group/t/using-org-noter-with-external-pdf-reader-instead-of-emacs-pdfview/1916)\n    submitted by    /u/Lamasland  \n [link]   [comments]",

You will now have two links (bidirectional) 123 <-> 121.\nDoes this contradict the ZK principle? If you don't let this happen, I can imagine there being a lot of link maintenance that must go on to prevent yourself from accidentally creating a link which is already a back-link into a regular link?\nThoughts appreciated.\nBradford",

Please let me know what you think.\nIf you have a Zettelkasten, you need to constantly create Zettels so it grows to give you richer connections. A day in a Zettler usually looks like this:\nCreate Zettels and make connections.\nRead sources.\nProofread Zettels.\nHowever, you need to manage the overall process so working with a Zettelkasten doesn't become all you do everyday. E.g.: In the worst case scenario, you'd spend the entire morning, afternoon, and evening creating Zettels, reading, and proofreading respectively. That gives you no time for anything else!\nThe part of the process to manage is reading time because everything else depends on it. E.g.: If you don't read, you can't create Zettels, and without Zettels, there's nothing to proofread.\nI think that we can manage reading time in the same way that we adapt the routine of short knowledge cycles:\nStart with 1 hour of reading.\nRead, create Zettels, and proofread. Keep track of the time spent on each activity.\nReflect on the overall process.\nBased on your reflection, change the time alloted for reading.\nRepeat steps 2 through 4 until you reach a point where you are satisfied with the work you do for your Zettelkasten, and don't lose time for other things in your day.",

With that I mean, methods for promoting/demoting notes in a hierarchy or folding a lower level to reduce distraction.\nIn Luhmann's paper, this aspect seemed really important to him. And I can see how adding lower-level notes helps to keep notes simple and atomic. (Example: notes on cities are listed under notes for countries.)\nAs I am just starting with the Zettelkasten, I am worried that a non-hiearchical note list will become very confusing quickly. So, how are more experienced people handling this? Did you find software that does handle hierarchies well?

Literature note can link to previous permanent notes that are useful for the idea. But what for permanent notes created just to explain something in the literature note? I guess we treat them as if they were older than the literature note, even if the UID is more recent (timestamp) breaking a bit the rule.

It is my hope to develop a system that allows me to write productively for my field and accrue a vast body of knowledge along the way. From what I have read thus far on the forum, articles about the Luhmann's numerical system have piqued my interested because I do want to use it in my system; however, I am still trying to grasp exactly how the new UID, aside from Luhmann's numerical one, is used for linking to other notes in the digital slip-box. I am currently deepening my understanding of this system by reading How To Take Smart Notes.\nPertaining to software, I am in need of advice. I have both Obsidian and Zettlr downloaded, having used Obsidian in the past for note taking but not as well organized as I would have liked. The latter software is a recent find; I have no experience with it. Yet I am open to suggestions concerning other applications available for Linux.\nWith regard to my studies, I am in the midst of my coursework and trying to figure out my niche, but I do have an affinity for Plato and Spinoza. What led me to the field in the first place was the Islamic philosophers, namely Al-Farabi and Ibn-Rushd (Averroes). Anyhow, I look forward to perusing the forum for past insights and discussions.",
