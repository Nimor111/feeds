I wrote about the changes to our code that this required in “Upgrading from GHC 8.10 to GHC 9.6 – an experience report”. That article touches on the risks associated with being forced to make many changes at once: if a problem occurs it can be hard to diagnose and it can be hard to fix. After that article was written I discovered that such a problem, albeit a benign one, had occurred. The present article expl…",

If you are familiar with Haskell, you may have an easier time learning the Nix language, but it is still difficult to figure out the various toolchains and libraries functions needed to put your knowledge of the Nix language to use. There are some frameworks for setting up Haskell projects with Nix, but again, they are hard to understand because of their large feature scopes.

          "description": "Lambda calculus is the theoretical basis for functional programming languages like Ocaml, Haskell, etc. Therefore it is an interesting topic for me.\n Since Church's lambda calculus, Gödel's recursive functions and Turing's automatic machines are equivalent, I was curious to find the analogue of a universal turing machine expressed in lambda calculus. I have found a quite simple universal lambda term which does the job.\n I have documented the construction of a universal lambda term in this paper.\n It gives a short introduction to lambda calculus. Then it introduces a programming notation for lambda calculus similar to Haskell/Ocaml in order to make lambda calculus more readable for functional programmers.\n In this notation some basic functions for booleans, pairs, numbers and optional values are introduced.\n In order to encode lambda terms the usual Gödel numbering has been avoided. Instead of Gödel numbers the basic idea of algebraic data types has been used.\n Based on the structure of an encoded lambda term, a lambda term is constructed which reduces an encoded lambda term to normal form or loops infinitely in case no normal form exists.\n    submitted by    /u/hbrandl  \n [link]   [comments]",

There's no Copilot executable or Copilot compiler as such: Copilot is an EDSL available as a Haskell library, so users still use GHC to compile Copilot modules.\n I assume homebrew is the easiest path, since we cannot add Copilot to Apple's App Store without having to add GHC and Cabal as part of the same package, which would be a sizeable effort.\n I'm struggling to make that happen due to how GHC and cabal create package envs and package DBs. A lot has changed in Cabal and GHC in the last few versions.\n Any help would be really appreciated. A lot of people in aerospace and at NASA use Mac, so this would be really helpful to increase adoption of Copilot.\n If someone more knowledgeable than me can help, you can find a bit more info in this discussion: https://github.com/Copilot-Language/copilot/discussions/537\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/ivanpd  \n [link]   [comments]",

Not only is the code longer, it's more confusing to anyone not acquainted with this specific topic. On top of that, the example showing that it automatically inserts the missing fmap seems to be trivially caught by the type checker anyway. So I'm really not seeing what we gain here.\n I'm not not ripping on this particular library or it's author at all, I think it's worthwhile to explore topics like this, but as anything other than a mental exercise I struggle to see what the benefit is in practice. Personally I don't understand what the aversion is to explicit recursion when the algorithm you're writing calls for it.

It offers consistent continuation-based semantics similar to those found in the eff library. For reference, see \"The effect system semantics zoo.\"\n One of its notable features is the ability to combine higher-order effects with delimited continuations, which works on a standard GHC.\n Key Features:\n  \nContinuations & Higher-Order Effects: Effects that require multi-shot delimited continuations, such as NonDet and coroutines, work seamlessly with higher-order effects.\n Purity: Built on a Freer-based system that does not rely on the IO monad, this library avoids the use of unsafePerformIO and similar functions. As a result, it can handle not only monadic but also applicative effectful programs.\n  \nFor an in-depth explanation of how this library works, check out: Higher-Order Effects Done Right: How the Heftia Extensible Effects Library Works - Sayo-hs Blog.\n    submitted by    /u/ymdfield  \n [link]   [comments]",

That's setting aside the obvious new features like dependent types and theorem proving (I have no interest in theorem proving, personally). It also seems to have a lot of interest from corporate research groups, or at least that's what its wikipedia article claims.\n At the same time, it seems to have very little presence online, outside of its zulip chat group. I see basically nothing on reddit, almost nothing on youtube. I get the impression that very few programmers have picked it up independently or converted to it from other languages like haskell.

On the virtual machine, I was able to setup my small project with no issues at all, using cabal init.\n Recently, I've managed to set up OpenBLAS and correctly install hmatrix on the host, but when I try to start a completely new project:\n C:\\Users\\User> mkdir proj\n C:\\Users\\User> cd proj\n C:\\Users\\User\\proj> cabal init\n after making me choose some set-up options, I'm inevitably hit by this message:\n git: readCreateProcessWithExitCode: does not exist (No such file or directory)\n I tried multiple combinations of options and the result is always the same.\n Every proposed solution to instances of this problem I've seen online doesn't work, and I can't figure out why.

          "description": "I tried to ask this question in a language-agnostic way here, and I'm actually using ReScript (a dialect of OCaml focused on the JavaScript ecosystem). But since the Haskell community probably has more experience with recursion schemes, I'm also asking here.\n In short, I'm writing a multi-stage compiler for a toy language, and I want to simplify folding and transforming my ASTs.\n Recursion schemes are perfect for this, but to use them I need to first \"functorialize\" my AST type, and then recover the concrete type by wrapping it into Fix. In ReScript syntax it looks like this:\n // \"Functorialized\" AST to allow recursion schemes inject custom data in place of nodes type exprF<'a> = Id(string) | Int(int) | Call(exprF<'a>, exprF<'a>) // Concrete expression type of arbitrary depth. // We add an extra wrapper to avoid defining it like 'type expr = exprF<expr>', // which would be self-referential and rejected by the compiler. type rec expr = Fix(exprF<expr>) \n The problem is, of course, that I now need to insert that Fix wrapper everywhere when constructing expressions or pattern-matching on them:\n let testData = Fix(Call( Fix(Id(\"square\")), Fix(Int(5)) ) \n Is there a way to avoid doing this, or at least automate it? Does it require specific language features, like Haskell's HKTs or OCaml's [@@unboxed]?\n I'd appreciate any thoughts!

Despite having little math background other than the few math classes that are typical for a computer science major, and not being able to come up with many relevant examples, I enjoyed reading through the book and tried my best to follow along every part, except coends.\n However, I struggled with the challenges in the book. I had to look up for solutions, or just failed to understand them at all, for more than half of them. I also didn't realize until the last few chapters that I kind of got natural transformations wrong. I thought it's a morphism of F a -> G a, but really it maps any object a to a morphism F a -> G a. I noticed that my retention for the knowledge is low. In other words, I forget the details of concepts in the book pretty fast. I tried to explain to myself verbally the concepts I learned, but I can feel it's wonky sometimes.\n I'd like to ask what are the next steps for me? Should I go through a different text, maybe \"Category Theory for the Working Mathematicians\", or others like \"Category Theory in Contexts\", hoping that maybe they'll solidify and expand my learning from a different aspect? Or should I learn a few other branches of math that I'm interested, and come back to category theory and see how they relate? Or?\n    submitted by    /u/machai_montgomery  \n [link]   [comments]",

The effect can be safely composed with others without a separate monad!\n kyo-prelude: The kyo-prelude module contains the new kernel of the library and a collection of IO-free effects. It's a quite complete effect system with mutability only to handle stack safety, tracing, and preemption. Other than that, the entire module is pure without any side effects or IO suspensions, including the effect handling mechanism.\n System: Provides access to system properties, environment variables, and OS-related information. A convenience Parse type class is provided to parse configurations.\n Check: A new effect that provides a mechanism similar to assertions but with customizable behavior, allowing the collection of all failures (Check.runChunk), translation to the Abort effect (Check.runAbort), and discarding of any failures (Check.runDiscard).\n Effect-TS-inspired pipe: The pending type now offers pipe methods that allow chaining multiple transformations into a single pipe call.\n ScalaDocs: The majority of Kyo's public APIs now offer ScalaDocs.\n cats-effect integration: The new Cats effect provides integration with cats-effect's IO, allowing conversion of computations between the libraries in both directions.\n New Clock APIs: New convenience APIs to track deadlines and measure elapsed time.\n Barrier: An asynchronous primitive similar to Latch to coordinate the rendezvous of multiple fibers.\n Integration with directories-jvm: The Path companion object now provides methods to obtain common paths based on the directories-jvm library: Path.basePaths, Path.userPaths, Path.projectPaths.\n  \nhttps://github.com/getkyo/kyo/releases/tag/v0.12.0\n    submitted by    /u/fwbrasil  \n [link]   [comments]",

I respect people who don't like using braceless syntax but I personally love using it in Scala 3.\n My question is, Is there any scala syntax that allows you to pass multiple parameters to method calls without having to use open and close parantheses? This would be extremely useful in libraries such as the extremely practical lihaoyi's scalatags. For example. Instead of:\n  body( div( h1(id:=\"title\", \"This is a title\"), p(\"This is a big paragraph of text\")` ) ) \n If there is some syntax which denotes the indented lines are parameters, maybe something like\n  body ~ div ~ h1(id := \"title\", \"This is a title\") p(\"This is a big paragraph of text\") \n In this case the ~ indicates that the following indented region is a set of parameters, so we don't even have put commas after each parameter.\n I haven't thought through this completely, so there might be flaws in this approach, but till now I haven't been able to think of big issues except for ~ probably being used in some libraries already.\n    submitted by    /u/realmagadheera  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm not a FP expert. I did a few things here and there, but for sure I don't have solid foundations to take my own conclusions, yet.\n I would say that the reason I'm asking this is due to some comments I saw at the r/haskell. The main points were:\n  \nThe mix between OO and FP. To some degree I find this odd as well and I still don't see the value of it.\n How Scala had and still do lots of compromises because it's so dependent on the JVM which has a totally different model. \n Overall complexity of the language. I would say that this is better at Scala 3, but still, I find the language really, really hard.\n How easy it is to start mixing up functional and non functional code which defeats the whole purpose of writing the functional code. OCaml suffers from this as well, but I would say that is way harder to do the same on Haskell or Erlang.\n  \nThanks!\n    submitted by    /u/fenugurod  \n [link]   [comments]",

So at the moment the best I've got is this:\n import zio.test.TestAspect.beforeAll object ApiTests extends ZIOSpecDefault { override def spec = { suite(\"test api\")( ... // tests ).whenZIO(isAlive) @@ beforeAll(checkConnectivityV2) }.provideShared(ZLayer.fromZIO(ApiService.create)) private var isAlive = true private def checkConnectivityV2: ZIO[ApiService, Nothing, Unit] = { ... // overwrites `isAlive` accordingly } } \n I can't help but feel it's not the best practice to use a loose var here.

          "description": "I was playing aroung with org-attach features lately, and stumbled upon something that looked weird to me. When using the uuid method to create attachment folders, orgmode uses the first two characters of the uuid to create a first folder, then the rest of the ID to create the actual attachment folder. It fails if using a uuid of less than 2 characters as far as I could test.\n It is not obvious to the eyes, a bit like a phishing site, I noticed it while deleting all attachments on a node, Emacs yes/no prompted me if I wanted to use recursive deletion. I was surprised because I understood that the 'uuid' method was supposed to store attachments in a flat directory structure named after the node's UUID, under the `org-attach-id-dir` directory.\n At first, I thought it was a bug (most probably in my config as always), but I could track down the process to this function in charge to generate the folder name:\n (defun org-attach-id-uuid-folder-format (id) \"Translate an UUID ID into a folder-path. Default format for how Org translates ID properties to a path for attachments. Useful if ID is generated with UUID.\" (and (< 2 (length id)) (format \"%s/%s\" (substring id 0 2) (substring id 2)))) \n Looking at this function, the bug theorydoes not stand as it looks very intentional on the developers part. So I am wondering why it was built like that.\n It does not impair the attachment functionalities at all, everything I tested works fine, but first I am curious, and second the way I found out about it bothers me. I wonder if multiple nodes were to share the same first two UUID characters, would they all get their attachment folders deleted by a recursive deletion meant for only one of them ? If yes, I think that would qualify as a bug with data loss on top of that.\n The docstring does not help me understand its purpose any better, so I thought I'd ask.\n    submitted by    /u/fred982  \n [link]   [comments]",

Specifically, I want to export the results of my analysis (including both code and images generated by that code) into a standalone HTML file.\n I’m running into two issues:\n 1. Image Embedding: By default, Org Babel’s HTML export functionality includes a link to any images rather than embedding the actual image itself as Base64. This means that if I share the HTML file, the images won’t be displayed unless the image files are also shared. 2. Pandoc Issues: I tried using a package that integrates Pandoc for exporting, but it won’t export the results of my code snippets—it only exports the code itself. This doesn’t just break image exports, it also fails to include things like text and table results from my analysis, which is a significant issue. \n Neither of these approaches works for me, and I haven’t been able to find a solution that allows for a complete, self-contained HTML file with embedded images and code results.\n My question: Is there a way to export an Org Mode file to HTML with all results (including images) embedded in the file itself?

Given this, I need a command that will capture all entries either from the ~/org/work.org and ~/org/business.org files OR with :CATEGORY: work, OR :CATEGORY: business set explicitly.\n Below I will give examples of records that I would like to filter in this way:\n ~/org/misc.org (by property)\n * Prepare f…",

They are actually buffer-local variables, but since I spend most of my time in narrowed org buffers, I decided to hook the modification of the local variables to the narrowing and widening of the buffer. I'm sure it has a lot of room for improvement, but so far it has worked well for me.\n The function hack-local-variables-property-drawer is the one to run when an org buffer is interactively narrowed or widened. Why interactively: you don't want it to run 50 times in a row when calling org-agenda, for example. If it's not the first time it runs in a buffer, it first restores the original values of the variables it changed last time. Then it reads the new variables from the \"LOCAL_VARIA…",

          "description": "My team is using notion for shared docs. I tried writing directly on notion but 1. the subpage system is driving me crazy (a page can be a link, or can be a whole line! and if you delete the whole line one, the page will be deleted, and sometimes you don't need whole line one; let alone the subpage being attached to parent so moving things around is another hassle) 2. It looks ugly compared to my emacs theme or website theme. \n The pain plus the bliss of writting in org-mode made me wonder if there's a way to write in org-mode and export it to notion. I guess if I have the bulk of the doc done at some permanent form(don't need to edit much) I don't care where it is on anyway. So what I'm looking for is a solution to 1. write a lot of stuffs in org-mode(possibly from lots of files linked together with org-id or file link) 2. slide them into notion as a cluster of pages. \n I'm currently trying notion's builtin import function https://www.notion.so/help/import-data-into-notion So far html is not working(failed with no error message), and I'm trying others, but I wonder if there's others have done this before?\n Currently my solution is to 1. write my stuff with org-mode and publish to my personal website (e.g. https://hermanhel.codeberg.page/braindump-ui/#f351ae9c-c280-4c71-9b12-1b8ba4a4200d this some doc I wrote about using huggingface) 2. make a page on notion and stick link to my website there.

          "description": "Since installing Emacs 31, I noticed a strange issue: if I try to look at the documentation of pcase, Emacs becomes very, very slow. It takes a few seconds to a) show the result in Vertico and b) open the documentation. Even evaluating (describe-function 'pcase) is extremely slow. I discovered that, for some reason, not loading lsp-mode and related packages improves the issue. I've also tried disabling and sequentially re-enabling packages from my config but couldn't find the culprit. To do that, I tried to put my config in a catch statement (to stop the execution at a certain point), like this:\n (catch 'my-exit ;; I want to execute this (throw 'my-exit \"Stop here\") ;; I don't want to execute this ) \n I'm pretty sure that what I did there is probably stupid, but I'm not an Elisp expert. Anyway, after putting all my config in the catch-throw statement (even with the throw as the last line), I couldn't reproduce the bug.\n I initially experienced the (describe-function 'pcase) bug on macOS and thought that this was in some way OS-specific, but I compiled Emacs 31+ on my Linux machine today and the same thing happens.\n At this point, I'm just very curious about what is happening. If someone has a clue, I'd appreciate it!\n    submitted by    /u/kofm  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Compatible with Emacs 30 and later versions.\n Overview files now have more elegant names, reducing repetitive occurrences of the word “overview.”\n Fixed an intermittent (setq, 5) error.\n Removed the dependency on conda.el in org-zettel-ref-mode.el, and the detection of the Python environment is now entirely handled by convert-to-org.py. \n Automatically sets up a virtual environment via the python venv command and installs required libraries. \n Note: After updating to this version, running convert-to-org.py will reinstall third-party libraries. If you prefer a clean environment, you may want to manage this manually.\n \n \n Improved synchronization mechanism for overview files, preventing multiple overview files from being created for the same source file. Also improved the robustness and stability of this feature. \n A hash table is now used to map source files to overview files. One great thing is that you don’t need to manually set the hash table file location.\n The overview file header now includes a new property block: #+SOURCE-FILE: to confirm the mapping.\n New commands: \n org-zettel-ref-check-and-repair-links - Check and repair links between source files and overview files.\n org-zettel-ref-maintenance-menu - Display a menu for org-zettel-ref-mode maintenance operations.\n org-zettel-ref-refresh-index - Manually refresh the overview index.\n org-zettel-ref-rescan-overview-files - Rescan the overview directory and update the index.\n org-zettel-ref-status - Display the current status of org-zettel-ref-mode.\n \n \n  \nCheck on Github: https://github.com/yibie/org-zettel-ref-mode\n If you like, start it!\n    submitted by    /u/yibie  \n [link]   [comments]",

My problems are: 1. Every major and minor mode ignore my ctrl+c bind and treat it as if it were a modifier key. 2. I don't know how to make emacs interpret ctrl+shift+c as the modifier key like cua did. 3. When I try to do incremental search I get the prompt \"I-search: [no previous search string]\" and when I try to type my search expression it just ignores, removes the prompt and writes my expression into the buffer.

Supporting the usage of multiple themes\n Example:\n (use-package emacs\n :custom (custom-enabled-themes '(bringhurst solarized inheritance)))\n (use-package auto-dark\n :init (auto-dark-mode))\n This will make use of various themes at the same time, while auto-dark-mode will also switch the light/dark versions of those themes.\n 2. Changing the default way to set light/dark themes\n These variables are now marked as obsolete:\n auto-dark--dark-themes\n auto-dark--light-themes\n The right way to set the light/dark themes is now through:\n (setq auto-dark-themes '((wombat) (leuven)))\n 3.

Normally, I operate emacs in terminal mode (emacs --daemon, emacsclient -t) using Terminal.app from MacOSX.\n Problem I'm having is that as of this upgrade, I can no longer paste text into a terminal buffer in char mode. If I cmd-C \"hi\" and Cmd-v it in a buffer in `term-mode` in character mode, the console just freezes up (i.e. all further keys aren't doing anything, I can't C-x b to get to another buffer, etc.). I have to Ctrl-G to get back control.\n My lossage output looks like\n ESC [ 2 0 0 ~ h i ESC [ 2 0 1 ~\n Which is what I'd generally expect with terminal shenanigans, and lossage confirms that it invokes `term--xterm-paste`. So I tried manually invoking term--xterm-paste and, yep, that freezes up the console too.\n Invoking help on term--xterm-paste doesn't give any obvious hints, and it's a compiled C function so now I'm at a bit of a dead-end. Any suggestions for how to debug this further would be much appreciated!\n ETA: confirmed issue is happening with an `emacs -Q` run and `M-x term` running /bin/bash, so I don't think it's my configuration (at least, not my emacs configuration).\n    submitted by    /u/fixermark  \n [link]   [comments]",

Client-Server Architecture: Although Emacs has a client mode, it's not meant to use with a server on another computer. 2. GPU Acceleration: This is the new cool trend. :) 3. Safe Multithreading: While Elisp provides facilities for multithreading, they're practically useless because there is no grantee for a thread to give the process back. 4. Proper GUI Library: And better mouse support. It's also impossible to write good GUI code for Emacs due to threading issues. 5. Image-based: This is also cool. Imagine installing an Emacs distribution just by installing an image. 6. Elisp Support: We need to keep it backwards compatible.\n Please share your thoughts.

It was all a bit stupid and we've all heard this before. But it did get me thinking this morning that I do have some questions about Emacs. Keep in mind that I'm a non-dev and some answers may be obvious to those who are but they aren't to me. 🙃\n 1) Why can't we actually get multithreading built into Emacs? I don't really understand why not. Could somebody please explain?\n 2) I was looking at iTerm and Kitty (I use them both but rarely). I mostly use vterm in emacs and I was wondering: would it be really hard to get emacs using GPU acceleration? I know that all GPUs are different and Emacs needs to run o…",

          "description": "Hi all, I have been using emacs for a few months (and loving it!), and I have recently run into some small trouble that I am not able to figure out. I was using emacs 27.1 all this which installed through apt, and needing a newer version of emacs, I recently installed emacs 29.4 through snap (and now through ppa). Some things broke, but with some time, I was able to get all my packages working again as I want them to. The main problem I am trying to solve now is this:\n Before, when I wanted to open a file or dired, I would just press 'C-x C-f' or 'C-x d' and the minibuffer would open with the path of the current buffer from where I have called the 'find file' command. Then if I wanted to navigate to some other directory, I could just press backspace and go about finding the specific file I wanted. Now, with the new emacs I have (I have tried this with snap and it's the same now with ppa), when I enter the minibuffer with 'C-x C-f' and press backspace to go to the parent directories, it no longer deletes the text and gives the message \"Text is read only.' A similar problem I faced today was with mu4e, for which the attachment directory was set to 'Downloads' folder. But I wanted to attach a file that was located in another folder, and when I tried to navigate in the minibuffer after calling the attach function 'C-c C-a', I was not able to move outside of the \"Downloads folder' and was getting the same message again. What I want is to be able to navigate through all directories in my home folder when I call these functions in any buffer. What is the problem and how do I go about solving it?\n I'd be grateful for some help with this. I don't particularly understand code, and have been using emacs mainly for humanities research, and it has worked well for me. I am on Pop OS 22.04.

Actually they didn't get drenched. They were not given the option at all and got used to not having them.\n The former is here now though having gone for years with them, they are not really missed. \n Why would folks come up with the Python based Emacs Application Framework or the Javascript based Emacs-NG if the policies had been different years ago?\n Isn't Elisp older than both languages?\n PS.

          "description": "I know that the topic of multi-threaded emacs has come up a lot in the past, with the main objection being that emacs has a ton of global state that would be impossible to make safe.\n However, I have not seen a compelling argument as to why we can't have multi-threaded garbage collection. I saw Julia has recently implemented this (relevant pr), and I struggle to see why something like this would be impossible for emacs.\n It seems that general emacs multi-threading is becoming less of an issue now, as emacs can offload a lot of workloads to asynchronous processes (LSPs, vterms, latemk, git, etc. all running asynchronously). This means that emacs is actually becoming more and more effectively multi-threaded. The downside of all this asynchronicity is that a lot of these programs communicate large amounts of data back to emacs (especially LSPs) creating a lot of garbage.\n Personally, I use gcmh-mode setting gcmh-high-cons-threshold to 10GB in order to avoid triggering the garbage collector often. Occasionally, I will get a 5-10 second freeze when GC is running on the full 10GB. I have CPU support for 20 threads, so I would imagine that multi-threaded GC would reduce the freezes to maybe 1 sec, which is a lot more reasonable.\n    submitted by    /u/omoniafan  \n [link]   [comments]",

The idea is to have a mode that can transliterate Latin characters into various scripts in real-time. I'm looking to start with Arabic since that's what I'm most familiar with, but the goal is to make it extensible to other languages in the future.\n The project would use Google Input Tools for the transliteration functionality. I thought it would be a cool project that could benefit many Emacs users working with different languages. The initial requirements aren't too complex (or are they? More on that later):\n  \nIntegrate with Google Input Tools API\n Provide real-time transliteration suggestions (starting with Arabic)\n Store common translations for offline use (like a dictionary)\n Allow manual editing of stored translations\n Design the system to be extensible for other languages through config\n Share the project commented and documented\n  \nI've posted the job on (a major jobs website) and tried to make it sound as approachable as possible. I've even revised the posting a few times to make it clearer and simpler.\n But here's the kicker: I've run into two major problems. First, the developers I've hired often don't seem to properly assess the project before accepting it. I've had three instances where they've abandoned the project shortly after starting. Second, and this is on me, the budget I can offer is abysmal. I'm realizing now that Emacs Lisp is probably not a beginner-friendly language, which makes finding skilled developers even harder, especially given my budget constraints.\n I am no dev but is this project really hard? How much should it cost? And would it be interesting/worth it for the community?\n Thanks for letting me vent a bit.\n    submitted by    /u/sawtdakhili  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I've been working on creating a major-mode for running tests. I was inspired by how rg.el uses the header-line to customize ripgrep parameters, and I wanted to similarly use the header-line to customize test parameters.\n rg.el achieves this by propertizing header-line elements with keymaps that call functions that customize the compilation query and recompile: see rg-header.el, specifically rg-header-mouse-action. This works with their major mode, rg-mode, which is defined via define-compilation-mode. This macro wraps define-derived-mode to derive from compilation-mode. I was able to mimic this process and achieve the desired behavior for my header-line.\n The problem comes when I try to add interactivity. If what I'm running requires interaction, I typically call compilation interactively. This makes the compilation buffer use comint-mode and compilation-shell-minor-mode. I couldn't figure out how to get define-compilation-mode to be interactive, so I instead just derived directly from comint-mode and activated compilation-shell-minor-mode. With this I can get interactivity in my major mode.\n However, the left click in the header-line no longer works. The hover help text still works. I imagine what's going on is that comint-mode or some minor mode is overriding the left mouse button. How can I get around this? It seems the recommended way of overriding major/minor mode keybindings is to define your own minor mode, or use bind-key*. But I'm not sure how to apply this to my situation, where I want to apply a keybinding only to some text (in the header-line). I'd appreciate any suggestions.\n    submitted by    /u/treemcgee42  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have try `(setq cdlatex-env-alist'((\"limit\" \"\\\\lim_{?}\" nil)))` and `(setq cdlatex-command-alist\n '((\"lim\" \"Insert fraction env\" \"\" cdlatex-environment (\"limit\") t nil)))` but this seems only works for the abbreviation at the beginning of a line.\n    submitted by    /u/DendyLi618  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I'm happy to share with everyone that org-zettel-ref-mode has been updated to version 0.3. The main focus of this update has been to improve its compatibility with org-roam. Additionally, the previously provided `convert-to-org.py` script can now be executed directly within Emacs, allowing for document conversion without leaving this productive environment.\n Although these are just two minor main updates, their impact is significant. It reminds me of a saying: \"No matter how simple the functionality, the complexity behind it is immeasurable.\" To ensure compatibility with org-roam, I've changed the working logic of org-zettel-ref-mode from generating a new file and directly overwriting it each time to incremental updates. I've also studied the org-roam API and managed to maintain stable IDs…",

I know that keypad mode is great for entering normal keybindings without cords, but I'm wondering how to add special keybindings to keypad mode?\n  \nIs there a way to have a \"local-leader\" key, like \",\" which is the equivalent of doing \"C-c\", so I can have a separate way to input mode-specific commands?\n How can I bind specific commands to key sequences in keypad/leader mode? e.g. I want \"SPC SPC\" to be like M-x, \"SPC b b\" to bring up the buffer menu, \"SPC w d\" to delete a window, etc. How can I do this kind of specific bindings for local-leader commands? But for everything I haven't defined, I want to default to the usual meow-keypad stuff.\n Are there any configs/packages that are like evil-surround?

And it would be quite resource intensive: CPU usage would jump up and my laptop fans would immediately start whirring.\n    \n Recently, I tried to debug an issue relating to a podcast feed that kept failing to update, no matter how long I set elfeed-curl-timeout. I'd get the error (56) Failure in receiving network data. Going to a terminal and manually downloading the feed with cURL worked fine.\n    \n I decided to switch elfeed-use-curl to nil to see if something was an issue. And incredibly, I found that the troublesome feed almost instantly updated. Updating all my feeds took a lot longer with much less resource usage.\n    \n So ... is there possibly something else going on here, or is cURL less performant than url-retrieve, at least for large numbers of feeds?

At the time, I had to input data for some content that wasn't available yet, and I wrote a major mode to make it easier to deal with.\n If anyone is interested, I can pop it up on github to share. It's pretty basic - a little bit of keyword highlighting, custom forward/backward -sexp functions, and setting up sane defaults to deal with essentially a TSV file with very long lines.It could almost certainly be expanded/improved, but it got the job done for me at the time.\n Anyhow, if you're interested, let me know and I'll make it available.\n    submitted by    /u/vizzie  \n [link]   [comments]",

Maybe add a new question, or investigate something related, or...whatever. Just some note to do later.\n The drill mode is extremely agressive about capturing all keystrokes, so if it's waiting for the user to hit a key and then ask me how well I did, I really can't do anything else with emacs. And of course I want to make these notes in emacs, and not switch over to some other editor like some kind of barbarian. :)\n Is there any way I can escape or bypass or otherwise allow myself to make notes during a drill session? \n Ideally, I'd like something where the drill session only \"takes over\" the relevant buffer, but still allows other windows and for the user to switch to/from the drill buffer/session.\n Then I could have two windows, one with my drill session running, and during the session if I think of a note, I switch to the other buffer, make my note, and switch back and do more drill stuff.\n EDIT: as /u/queyenth points out, just doing e from the drill prompt lets you escape out of the drill prompt. The idea is to edit the question, but you can do off and do whatever you like, and then just do org-drill-resume and it, well, resumes exactly where you left off.\n So, the solution is: when I'm looking at a drill question and my ADHD brain spews a bunch of related things and I need to get them out of my head or I'll forget them:\n  \nDo e, which org-drill says means \"edit\" but to me means \"escape the very agressive drill prompt\".\n \nMake notes, play Tetris, deflect cosmic rays to flip bits on my hard drive, etc.\n \nDo org-drill-resume.\n \n    submitted by    /u/desquared  \n [link]   [comments]",

I spent hours trying to figure out why the heck Emacs for some reason would get stuck while I try to go to the next line, forcing me to press the key again and again.\n Ran the profiler a bunch of times, tried disabling modes, opened larger and smaller files, went through the git log, installed different versions of Emacs, switched machines and tried some other things. After two days of frustration, I noticed the problem worsening. As it turns out, a minuscule speck of dust was lodged in my key-well. Blast it! With Emacs, there's almost always some bizarre shit, and the immediate knee-jerk reaction to anything unusual is to assume that it's broken. Emacs is good, and Emacs is never broken (unless when it is 😀).\n Talk about confirmation bias.\n    submitted by    /u/ilemming  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I've been using Emacs for all my (rather limited) text editing and bash scripting needs for years, and am finally getting round to seriously learning c++, partly thanks to the excitement in recent years over things like lsp-mode, eglot and tree-sitter. \n A quick search through this sub, however, shows frustrated posts every couple of years over emacs' performance as a c++ ide. My (perhaps optimistic) suspicion is that it'll be more than sufficient for my purposes, given that I'm a long way off from million line codebases and so on, so I probably won't need or want full ide functionality for a while. \n So, assuming that my needs are fairly simplistic, is it reasonable as a beginner programmer learning c++ to be using emacs for (more-or-less) my entire learning environment, or am I missing out in ways I don't yet understand? I currently have pdf-tools for reading a textbook in one fullscreen frame on one monitor, and then 2 windows side-by-side on another monitor - the cpp file (or header or makefile or whatever) I'm editing on one side, and the other side for the output of M-x compile (which I've bound to C-c c) or a M-x shell (bound to C-c s).\n I would love some recommendations for things that I don't yet know I'll want. For example, syntax highlighting in c++-mode seems good enough so far - do I want to be using c++-ts? If so, is the grammar on the tree-sitter github page the one to use? Do I want ide style features like symbol/definition navigation, corrections, reformatting, completion as you type? Any suggestions for configs focused on those sorts of features? I'm not a fan of big starter kits like doom, but would love to read other people's configs for things that I can apply myself.\n I know this is all a bit vague, so apologies for that. I guess I don't really know what I'm looking for, which is sort of the point. Many thanks for reading this!\n    submitted by    /u/gnudoc  \n [link]   [comments]",

Double-clicking the binary directly in the file explorer and running emacs in the terminal both similarly give focus.\n I've searched for a bit online and the closest I've seen to this exact problem is this: (link) (although this: (link) suggests someone has the same problem).\n One thing to note: this problem only occurs under Wayland proper.

          "description": "Hello! I've been recently trying to get more intentional about treating Emacs Lisp like 'any other programming language' and so I have a question about package development.\n Let's say that you are developing two packages that depend on different versions of the same package. You are using Eask/Cask/Eldev/Keg/etc and so you have two projects: foo and bar that both depend on some third package baz, but one of them is 'stuck' at an earlier version. The packages are otherwise unrelated. For the argument's sake, you cannot upgrade. How do you get completion, documentation, jump to definition etc pointing at the correct version of baz? Do you clear up your load path every time you switch between the projects?\n Or to put question differently, when you develop foo.el, how do you get elisp completion and documentation relevant only to what foo.el should be able to access and not to anything defined in your configuration? Right now if I open any .el file elisp-completion-at-point will happily suggest any function or variable that I ever defined in init.el. I can of course start a new session and load only foo.el . But then I lose all my customization to get accurate completions.\n This is a pretty common scenario within the larger programming ecosystem and most languages/tools handle it without the developer ever thinking about it, but I have not seen anything on the topic in Emacs Lisp specifically. Any pointers would be appreciated.\n Edit: Some clunky wording in 3rd paragraph.\n    submitted by    /u/icejam_  \n [link]   [comments]",

My Emacs was filled with org files containing highlights, bookmarks, and copied passages, yet I often struggled to recall or effectively use this information when I needed it. I realized I wasn't truly engaging with what I read.\n I stumbled upon Niklas Luhmann's Zettelkasten method and was intrigued. The idea of summarizing in my own words and connecting ideas across different sources resonated with me. I started experimenting with this method manually and found that I was remembering more and understanding deeper.\n My Solution\n Being an Emacs user, I thought, \"Why not create a tool to streamline this process?\" That's how I started working on org-zettel-ref-mode.\n Here's what it does:\n  \nAutomatically extracts comments and summaries from the text you're reading.\n Creates an overview window for quick reference.\n Saves literature notes to custom folders.\n Enables quick commenting with a simple command.\n Allows easy navigation between notes and source material.\n  \nHere's what it looks like:\n https://preview.redd.it/ocznlb8ppxjd1.png?width=3912&format=png&auto=webp&s=ad89abce1de70ea319053e2fab261c214e306eeb\n I'm curious:\n  \nHave you ever created tools to enhance your learning process?

I've decided to start using it for my research on courses about machine learning applied to geology, machine learning itself or geology itself. I'm used to writing stuff down linearly in my paper notebook - not only am accostumed to it, but I also feel pretty good doing so. It makes more sense to me, I guess, to jolt down in a notebook something thorough and linear as a course, more sense than writing atomic notes at least. I'm not sure if I'm \"stuck to the hold habits\" or that's actually somewhat the way to go. I wanted to try Zettelkasten to be more dynamic in my note-writing, as well as faster - for as much as I like and absorb better on paper, I roughly take one hour per page. Insanity.\nMy \"notes\" in my notebook are more of a summary of the thing I am consuming than simplified notes per se; I like to make them so that when I need to check the subject in the future once it is forgotten, I will be able to quickly comprehend it again. Which is why I am feeling using the notebook, rather than Zettelkasten, makes more sense.\nOr perhaps I can make atomic notes on the subject and link them on an \"index\" of some sort in my Zettelkasten? An index such as \"Course X/Y/Z\" with the individual atomic notes?\nThanks for any input.",

Somehow it bothered me that parts of the box looked very tidy, while others looked quite chaotic.\nInitially, my activities to improve this situation were still very sporadic and unsystematic. I lacked a ‘method for tidying up’. But it wasn't so easy to find. Even my favourite source ‘How to take smart notes’ by Sönke Ahrens didn't help me.\nWhy don't I use Marie Kondo's method? She already helps me tidy up my socks. Why can't she also improve the situation in my Zettelkasten ? Thought, done: Since 14 May 2023 (create date, Zettelkasten), I have been tidying up using the method.\nBut I can do even better. Today, while I was tidying up my Zettelkasten, I was offered the note ‘Simplicity’. And Google was kind enough to point me to ‘The Five Elements’ within Feng Shui via ‘The Principle of Clarity’.\nAnd yes, Feng Shui has been identified by scientists and philosophers as both non-scientific and pseudoscientific, and has been described as a paradigmatic example of pseudoscience. But it has helped me to find a different way of looking at my Zettelkasten. Looking at WOOD, FIRE, EARTH, METAL and WATER makes new connections that were invisible without this framework.\nI also added \"The Five Principles\" which helped me to find the right balance to tidy up my Zettelkasten.\n\n  \nWhat experiences have you had? What is the best way to tidy up a Zettelkasten?",

I've been using a hybrid ZK system as my fleeting notes are on my notebook daily journals, reference notes on 4x6 cards, and main notes in Obsidian.\nFor the past few months, I've taken a lot of reference notes on 4x6 cards ranging from Coursera courses, academic journals to books and even my own daily journal.\nAfter converting them into main notes for 3 weeks, I now have a question, which is hilarious but did bother me a lot. The question is how should I sequence my reference note cards for a course or a book because I might have notes on two cards for 2 chapters or for a combination of different lesson videos.\nI watch some YouTube videos, but it looks like no one have talked about sequencing of reference note cards?",

          "description": "Hello! I am new to this forum and Zettelkasten. Do I take literature notes on permanent notes in my case? If not, how to convert literature notes into permanent notes?\nToday I was reading the book Atomic Habits on my iPad in the kindle app and there was an option to take notes on a specific line/word in the book. I read about 20-25 pages and marked a lot of information (there is an option - I can mark lines and words in blue, red, orange and yellow colors). So, as I was reading I took a lot of literature notes in the app (in total 15-20) and it was not one note that contained all the literature notes. I wrote all these notes with my own words and I noticed that I was describing some ideas very differently but the essence remained the same and I referred to what the author wanted to convey, but in different words. And sometimes I even supplemented these ideas with my own thoughts.\nNow I am using Obsidian and wrote down these ideas from my iPad to my computer in Obsidian as literature notes. Some of them were similar, so I filtered them out. But I do not think these are literature notes. They seem like permanent notes. In my case, when I make such notes, are they permanent or literature notes? And sorry for my bad English. If I made any mistakes, please correct me. I will be very grateful for any answer!",

I came close to finding that in NotePlan, which I loved and have used for about three years.  It did a great job of integrating everything except my ZK, which I maintained in The Archive.  The hump there was that NotePlan used a somewhat different file format from The Archive (both used text files, but in different ways).  I was slowly trying to build up steam to write a Python script to convert from one format to the other, and due to other priorities, I didn't get to it.\nI came across Logseq (recommended by someone on this forum) and h…",

And the ZK method seems well suited for also keeping track of those things.\nIs there some wisdom in keeping the things separate? Or do you just let it all live together?\nWhat about journaling? I ask that because my \"personal development\" stuff can veer closer to \"journaling\" than \"business research,\" but journaling (and dream journaling) feels like it shouldn't be anywhere near my ZK.",
