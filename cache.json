For a variety of reasons I want to represent this with a composite of simple arrays, so for example an array of (a, b, c) would actually be structured as (array a, array b, array c). This is nice because zip- and unzip- like operations essentially become free. As I understand it, Data.Vector.Unboxed does something like this, although I don't get quite how it works. For this particular application Data.Vector.Unboxed is not suitable however as I'm making this array library specifically for an FFI which requires pinned memory.\n What I want to do is define composite types in a simliar way to how a value level list might be,\n comp = a:b:c:[] \n so that it can be transformed by applying a type level function to each element\n map f (a:b:c:[]) == f a:f b:f c:[] \n My current thinking is that it might be possible to express this type of transform on the type level somehow, but It's not clear to me how.\n The purpose of this would be to have a neat way to relate the element type to the array type, so I'd have something like\n CompArray (a <:> b <:> c <:> ()) ~ Array a <:> Array b <:> Array c <:> () \n Any ideas on how to express this, or is it not possible to do this kind of type level programming in Haskell?\n    submitted by    /u/FluxusMagna  \n [link]   [comments]",

Say I want to write a single program in a file 'test.hs' that depends on modules not in the prelude. And I want to compile this into an executable. So I cannot simply complie this with `ghc test.hs`, since I will get the complaint that ghc cannot find the module I need.\n So what is the recommended work around? I know you can use cabal or stack to build a project and the specify dependencies in the .cabal file. But this seems heavy duty for a single haskell file. Specifically, using `cabal init` will create a directory `app`, the file `CHANGELOG.md`, and the .cabal file, just for this single haskell file. Further `cabal init` asks quite a lot, including asking about which license to use, leading me to believe `cabal init` is meant for much more heavy duty projects.\n Using stack has a similar amount of, if not more, overhead.\n tldr; Is using `cabal init` or `stack new` the best way to create a stand alone `.hs` file depend on hidden packages?

Everything has been going swimmingly until we got to closures, which introduced a subtle problem involving variable shadowing. To fix this, the book introduces a semantic analysis pass where all the variables get resolved to their proper scope before any actual interpreting happens.\n This analysis pass uses a Map Expression Int, mapping from an expression to a location in the stack of scopes of the program where the variable can be found. In Java, because `Expression` is a separate object with its own object ID, this works out fine. In my Haskell version I have implemented Expression something like the following:\n data Expression = Grouping Expression\n | Unary UnaryOperation Expression\n | Binary BinaryOperation Expression Expression\n | Literal LiteralContents\n | Variable String\n | Assignment String Expression\n -- etc\n deriving (Show,Eq,Ord)\n This has worked very well so far, however it does introduce a problem with regards to the Map Expression Int: Any Variable \"abc\" will be considered equal, even if they come from very different nodes in the AST. The derived functions for Eq will not do here.\n What is the recommended way to solve this? So far I've come up with:\n  \nTry and fake the Java way of object equality by using `StablePtr` and friends, though that may not work too well with the (hash)map.\n Add a unique integer to every node in the AST to disambiguate them.\n Add the original source location to every Expression, so that different references to the same variable would be disambiguated by their source location. This feels a bit dirty though, since it would bleed implementation details from the scanner/parser into the interpreter.\n  \n   submitted by    /u/WJWH  \n [link]   [comments]",

For example, I can see how Yesod handles messages and keeps type safety. But not being able to add a new language or reword things without recompilng is more than a bit meh to my eye.\n In my current application, I'm looking at calendar definitions. I'd like to be able to have a file saying \"Pentecost is the 50th day after Easter Sunday. Easter Sunday is supposed to have a definition but it got messed up and it's now effectively an arbitary list of dates. Australia Day is on the 26th of January.\" etc. etc. and then, if I'm reading JSON and there is a named calendar, just get the calendar defintiion.

I'd like to be able to solve some advent of code problems in haskell.\n Does anybody know a good introduction to haskell for someone fairly familiar with agda, but who has only used agda for formal verification? I am very familiar with the lambda calculus and type systems, algebraic data type, inductive types, and pattern matching, etc. I mostly need a crash course in syntax, important functions, input and output, and whatever else I might be missing from the agda proof assistant side of things.\n Thanks in advance.\n    submitted by    /u/loop-spaced  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi Everyone,\n I've been playing around with a parser exercise to try to understand applicatives and how they can be used to compose parsing functions together. I have a basic Parser type like this: (Full code Replit here)\n newtype Parser a = Parser {runParser :: String -> Either (String, Int) (a, String, Int)}\n The left side is a failure with the error message and char position, and the right side is a success with the value, the remaining string, and the char position.\n I made an Applicative instance for my parser type so that it would compose together and keep track of the char position in the original text as it moves along.\n instance Applicative Parser where pure :: a -> Parser a pure a = Parser g where g xs = Right (a, xs, 0) (<*>) :: Parser (a -> b) -> Parser a -> Parser b (Parser rp1) <*> (Parser rp2) = Parser f where f xs = case rp1 xs of Left (err, i) -> Left (err, i) Right (pf, s', i) -> g s' where g xs' = case rp2 xs' of Left (err, pos) -> Left (err, pos + i) Right (val, l, pos) -> Right (pf val, l, pos + i) \n My problem is that the char position seems to work fine with single-level S-expressions:\n https://preview.redd.it/a2nipo5v8iad1.png?width=431&format=png&auto=webp&s=7bf1c9ccdbaa1038455de9a75e281a19da4bb812\n This wordks and it is exactly what I want it to do.\n But it does not work with embedded S-expressions! It just shows the error at the beginning of first embedding of an S-expression.\n https://preview.redd.it/hxoolfw39iad1.png?width=431&format=png&auto=webp&s=5dbabb13debde9ac51d17cdc8c696cc7f440682a\n The rest of the code can be found on this Replit link.

          "description": "Hi everyone, I am implementing Fingertree from the following paper: https://www.staff.city.ac.uk/~ross/papers/FingerTree.html\n Of course, not an easy data type, but a great way to learn more about inductive data types in practice. I have managed to implement everything up to appending trees, which is what this question is about. \n Source code exists here. Because it was a lot of work trying to figure out exactly how to implement append, I reused the functions in the source code. In my version, however, I do not use a Measured (there is no value, this comes later in the paper). Apart from that, everything is the exact same. However, on every single function (appendDigits1, appendDigits2, appendTree1, etc.) there is the error described in the title whenever I use Node2 or Node3 as an input for any of the functions that expects a as an input. For example: \n addDigits1 m1 (One a) b (One c) m2 = appendTree1 m1 (Node3 a b c) m2 \n causes the error in the title, where \n appendTree1 :: FingerTree (Node a) -> a -> FingerTree (Node a) -> FingerTree (Node a) \n This is of course strange, because in the source code, they use the exact same abstraction where they feed appendTree1 a Node type as second input, without trouble. When I edit all occurrences of a to Node a, the error simply moves to the Node type itself, saying that Node3 constructor cannot take Node a as an input and expects a, even though Node3 (Node2 a b) (Node2 c d) (Node2 e f) is a perfectly valid output. Also, a should be an abstraction from Node a as far as I know. \n What is happening? \n    submitted by    /u/Krebota  \n [link]   [comments]",

This way we help musicians to play all of their favourite music in an easy and intuitive way. You can try it at https://chordify.net\n Now, the backend for our website and apps, that are used by millions of people worldwide, is written in Haskell! We serve the user using primarily Servant, Persistent and Esqueleto. We also make use of a custom Redis caching layer; you may know us from https://hackage.haskell.org/package/redis-schema\n We are looking for a new proactive, independent and creative functional programmer to improve the Chordify backend infrastructure, core technology, and launch new ideas to join our team of experienced developers in our offices in Utrecht or Groningen. You'd get the opportunity to work with advanced type systems to power a website that serves millions.\n More information (e.g. expectations, salary range, secondary benefits) and a form to apply can be found at https://jobs.chordify.net. If you have any questions, feel free to ask them in this thread, or reach out to me at [menno@chordify.net](mailto:menno@chordify.net) \n We strive for diversity in our team, and encourage people of all backgrounds and genders to apply.\n For transparency: this is explicitly NOT a remote job.

Sometimes, when there's an error over a function, you don't even get the popup when you hover over the function name, meaning you have to go elsewhere and type out the function name to check the order of its arguments.\n Some of this annoyance seems to be down to a fundamental incompatibility between Haskell and vscode; vscode expects a C-style language, where function calls are characterized by brackets, so can't understand function calls without brackets. It also obviously can't give parameter names, since parameters in Haskell can have multiple names because of pattern matching.\n Is there any solution to this issue, or is it just an annoyance you have to deal with?\n    submitted by    /u/ZestyGarlicPickles  \n [link]   [comments]",

To add, diffs show spaces and, its like mostly obvious which indentation level it is. If it isn't, you have indent rainbow, which trivializes tracking.\n Same story with merge conflicts - sometimes you would be able to get braces mismatch regardless, and its harder to fix than indentation mismatch. \n Well, now we have (), that are the second source of unpronouceable clutter, and [] which are, as well, in some places, yet not as common.

Here are the details of the two offers:\n 1. First Offer: This is a B2B position in a well-established outsourcing company focused on a betting project. The project is run out of Poland and involves working with Scala on a platform that is already up and running for a major client in the betting industry. The role offers about 50-60% higher compensation compared to the second option. The job provides a flexible work schedule, allowing for mid-day breaks like going to the gym. However, I have some ethical concerns regarding working in the betting industry. 2. Second Offer: This is a permanent employment (CIM) position at another outsourcing company, but on a project that is just about to start. The project involves Python and AWS, and the salary is lower. The work hours are strict, from 9 to 18, with little flexibility. \n Given the market trends, I’m inclined towards the more stable option, even though stability sometimes seems illusory if the employer decides to let you go. I have experience with both Scala and Python and try to remain language-agnostic in my career.\n My question for you is:\n • Considering the current state and future of Scala in the industry, do you think the first offer has a significant advantage in terms of career development? \n Thank you for your help!\n    submitted by    /u/korash04  \n [link]   [comments]",

There are only few examples for the most basic cases, then when it comes to the Contexts section there are almost none. I have no idea when to use \"lazy val ctx = new PostgresJdbcContext(SnakeCase, \"ctx\")\" and when to simply use \"quill: Quill.Postgres[SnakeCase]\" from the Getting Started section.\n There are 6 JDBC dialects provided by the library - H2Dialect, MySQLDialect, PostgresDialect, SqliteDialect, SQLServerDialect, OracleDialect.

What libraries I should learn, which I should not. Seems that Scala without Cats is not pure FP. There is a akka library, which is so big and heavy, that I even consider If I want to touch that.\n In .NET you kinda have everything out of the box, most of the thing you want to achieve, you can by using standart library. And in Scala, seems that standart library is minimal on purpose.\n I would like to ask if anyone could share some tips or steps in understanding what should I learn in Scala.

A form where you have fields that require front-end and back-end validation (and maybe back-end validation before the user submits the data), forms with drop-downs where the content of a drop-down depends on the selection in another field, forms with editable tables/grids or multiple read-only tables/grids whose data can be populated independently, forms where sections of a form are hidden or displayed based on other field values.\n I wonder if this pattern is conducive to developing such forms where the data can come from different sources. The examples I came across are simple forms and I am not sure what the code would look like if you have more complicated stuff.\n Thanks\n    submitted by    /u/0110001001101100  \n [link]   [comments]",

Right now I’m looking at Scala, and I really like its features. However, the jvm dependency, while great for some purposes (I do a lot of work in clojure), is a concern for others. One reason I’m looking at compiled languages is for building cli tools as static binaries that can be flexibly copied into docker containers, over ssh, etc.\n I’m curious how practical scala native would be for this purpose, or if I’d be better off using another language for cli tools. What if I wanted to do something that depends on third-party libraries, like image processing?\n Thanks for the help. \n    submitted by    /u/mister_drgn  \n [link]   [comments]",

There is a very fine-grained role-based authorization scheme managed by the backend. For UX-reasons, some backend responses contain a permission object with some requests (e.t. GET /api/entities/ returns { data: ..., permissions: { create: true } }.\n Setting up accounts for all possible combinations of permissions is tedious, and for some combinations/new functionality, roles don't even exist yet, so I would like to inject permissions to (some) /api/... requets after they return from being proxied to the backend. Express' imperative handler will not let me access the responses after a handler has matched, but with pure functions this should be trivial.\n So, are my use cases supported/possible with HTTPurple?

          "description": "Making great animated graphics on mobile apps has always been challenging. While react-native-svg has served React Native developers well for basic vector graphics, it often falls short when it comes to replicating the more complex effects seen in web applications. We’ll be integrating Skia for rendering sharp, efficient 2D graphics and Reanimated for creating fluid, responsive animations. Step-by-step, we’ll explore the setup, key coding techniques, and best practices to implement a dynamic image slider that is both smooth and visually stunning.\nSkia is an open source multiplatform 2D graphics engine which supports GPU-accelerated rendering on Android, iOS and others, and can be used in the React Native ecosystem.

          "description": "Integration testing, a crucial phase of the software development life cycle, plays a pivotal role in ensuring that individual components of a system work seamlessly when combined. Other than unit tests at an atomic level, every thing in the software development process is a kind of integration of pieces. This can be integration-in-the-small, like the integration of components, or it can be integration-in-the-large, such as the integration of services / APIs. While integration testing is essential, it is not without its challenges.

I already have some System Crafters ones, and also those from spudlyo but while useful, they're not the specific one(s) I'm thinking of. I think the presenter had either an Australian (or maybe Kiwi/Tassie) or South African accent.\n Any suggestions?\n Incidentally, I did ask ChatGPT for its input. And while I have to acknowledge that accent is not a perfect predictor of nationality, I reckon it's still often a good one. And so I have my doubts over ChatGPT's three suggestions. The first was David Wilson, who doesn't sound very Australian. The second was System Crafters, but that Just Is David Wilson. The third reply was the charm though, and makes me think ChatGPT must be having a particularly bad day, hallucinations-wise, because it said:\n  \n...another prominent Australian YouTuber who focuses on Emacs and Org mode is 'Protesilaos Stavrou'\n  \nAgain, I know accent doesn't map perfectly to nationality, but clearly Prot doesn't sound remotely Australian. Thing is, ChatGPT actually seemed to be \"aware\" of the issue, because it went on to say:\n  \nWhile not exclusively Australian, his content is highly relevant and valuable for Emacs and Org mode users.\n  \nSo there you go, Prot. If you're reading this you'll be glad to know that ChatGPT acknowledges that you are not \"exclusively\" Australian. Fair dinkum.\n    submitted by    /u/TeeMcBee  \n [link]   [comments]",

Yesterday I spend some time and here are some hints and examples.\n  \nCheck the calc section of the emacs manual. Any function available in calc is available in org-mode tables. Calc functions are named calcFun-<name>. They are meant to be used infix in org tables. You can also use describe-function and completion to find functions.\n \nMany calcFunc-<name> functions take a vector as a parameter. Usually this vector is composed of strings (even if the function is numeric). The converstion from strings to numbers if done automatically.\n \nYou can define new functions for calc by defining a function using defun and naming it calcFun-<name>. I recommend you look at the definition of a function in the emacs source code.\n …",

          "description": "Think about how you probably use magit, especially the log, where you tend to visit commits alongside the history, with the log in one window and particular log items in another window. Magit has a lot of views and these views often list items that can be in turn viewed in multiple ways. This list & item interaction model has a lot of good karma with respect to both architecture and user interaction.\n I'm mainly picking on `org-agenda-list', but not using the full window width always has bad voodoo in Emacs. When I see complex agenda views with a lot of information to the right of the list of items, I think it's neat, but I also think it should be left & right window for those cases so that the functionality can be remixed and viewed in a mix & match kind of way. This is one of the main reasons I'm not building on top of agenda.\n Another reason this works with magit is because of collapseable sections for showing details of items. Vertical organization can hold arbitrary amounts of detail while left-right organization in a single window, well, this isn't a web browser. Organizing information left-right in sections and controlling reflow are likely to not obtain a good result.\n This is related to casually spiking more work on afterburner, only at the pace that I am getting value out for now.\n    submitted by    /u/Psionikus  \n [link]   [comments]",

The break in the middle of the page works, but if the break is between pages, I don't get the 3 asterisks.\n I figured all I would have to do is add #+LaTeX_HEADER: \\documentclass{memoir} to the in-buffer settings, and then use $\\pfbreak$ when I wanted to add a break, which seems to be somewhat right, since it works in the middle of a page.

There are some people saying that Emacs is always slow in general regardless of the OS.\n Now, Emacs is never going to be as fast as simpler editors. However, most of the time you shouldn't be able to notice any slowness. All this suggests to me that lots of people are doing things sub-optimally. I have used Emacs for more a very long time. Here I'll give some advice on speed. I haven't deliberately optimized my Emacs setup for speed, but I have avoided things that make it slow.\n Firstly, there are some things that you can't really change....\n  \nThe speed of external programs like Git.\n  \nPeople often say that Git related packages are slow on Windows.

What I currently do is have several buffers open at once and then switch to each buffer, make my change, go to the next buffer -- which, you can guess, is very tedious.\n After searching for a bit, I found the wonderful BROADCAST-MODE which allows you to do this for visible buffers. And indeed, it works just fine for regular text buffers. However, I was saddened to find out it doesn't seem to work with VTERM, my terminal emulator of choice within emacs.\n Is there another mode I have failed to find? Is there a configuration settings I forgot to tweak? I'd love to hear your suggestions.\n Have a good day, fellows :)\n    submitted by    /u/olivuser  \n [link]   [comments]",

While attempting to compile Emacs, I ran into several very frustrating build issues.\n My first issue was that while running ./configure --with-tree-sitter --with-native-compilation I kept getting an error saying that tree-sitter could not be found. The version that was available from dnf was too old, so I decided to clone the tree-sitter repo and compile it myself. In spite of tree-sitter building without issue, it was still failing to register with the Emacs configure script.\n The solution ended up being to first runldconfig after tree-sitter is done compiling:\n sudo ldconfig /usr/local/lib\n Then, to ensure that the emacs configure script finds it, export the path:\n export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig\n Then you can runmake && sudo make installand everything should work.\n    submitted by    /u/he-who-greps  \n [link]   [comments]",

I've read the chapter about completion in the emacs manual but could not understand anything...\n It worth mentioning that I use vertico, marginalia and ordderless packages and It would be nice to use the marginalia to show more information about the items / files.\n    submitted by    /u/Peaceful-traveler  \n [link]   [comments]",

I know frame.c and window.c manages outputs and stuff I'm just trying to be thorough and see if there is maybe something else I can look at in the source code. \n    submitted by    /u/Adventurous-Reach604  \n [link]   [comments]",

Instead, I just the get the ASCII quote symbols highlighted in blue to indicate that they're actually not the ASCII quote character. The same applies to left and right single quotes.\n As implied by my post title, this problem only applies when running emacs in daemon mode. if instead of launching emacsclient I run /usr/bin/emacs from a graphical environment, I get a frame where the quote characters work fine. I'm inferring that there's some variable somewhere that determines whether or not quote characters should be substituted, and it's being set to false when emacs runs daemonized because there's no graphical environment, but I'm unsure what variable that would be and where it would be set.\n I am using emacs 29.4 with pgtk enabled, on Arch Linux.

          "description": "I am entering my senior year of my BSc. in Data Science (primarily use R and python). I first learned about Emacs my freshman year and was intrigued by the potential -- keyboard-focused, modularity, customization, etc. I started using and configuring vanilla Emacs as my \"daily driver\" about 18mo ago. Within the last 6mo I have used `org-agenda` to organize my schedule, Jupyter notebooks for class assignments, and record most* of my notes using `denote` (*need to spend some time configuring latex for math notes). \n This summer, I completed a Data Science internship at a medium-ish sized tech company. Although most of my classwork is in Jupyter notebooks, the dev team discourages the use of notebooks. Experiments are mostly organized in python files but it does seem that others still use Jupyter notebooks to tinker with code snippets or intermediate plotting. All development is done remotely across a number of servers and docker containers.\n Needless to say, my \"little\" Emacs configuration was not up to the task. The jump from using Emacs for my homework assignments to fleshing out a reliable IDE that I can be used on the job is overwhelming. I struggle to envision how I would make that jump. I am aware of `tramp` and `lsp-bridge`, for example, but have read a lot of complaints about latency or `magit` being slow. Alternatively, one could install Emacs on given server ... but how common is it that companies allow you to do that? \n For those that use Emacs professionally: How do you use Emacs at your company? Do you run Emacs locally but develop over tramp, what is that experience like? If not, does your company allow you to install Emacs on a server? \n    submitted by    /u/Impossible_Win_9059  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Recently I found out that Emacs can deal with so-called noncontiguous regions. I cannot find very much information about these on the internet, the Emacs manual or the Emacs help system. But I'm curious about these noncontiguous regions and want to see if I can use them for something. As an example, something I want to do is to narrow to a noncontiguous region. But to be clear, narrowing to a noncontiguous region is not the problem I want solved here. I just want to learn how to use noncontiguous regions. \n I'll try to define a clear question. If I want to create a noncontiguous region that contains the columns 4 to 7 on rows 1 and 2 then I can do this using a rectangular region(at least interactively, but I imagine I can recreate that in elisp too). But what if I want to create a noncontiguous region containing columns 4 to 7 on lines 1 and 3 but not line 2. Then I cannot use rectangular regions(as far as I know). Is there a way to do this? I'm not necessarily asking for an interactive way to do it. An elisp solution is fine and even prefered. \n I've found the variable region-extract-function that perhaps could be useful, but I'm not sure how to use it. In particular, I don't know when the function that this variable is bound to is called. \n I also found the library zones.el. But from the documentation it seems like it doesn't actually define noncontiguous regions, just something that looks and feels like noncontiguous regions. So this doesn't really satisfy my curiosity. And I'm mainly interested in learning the builtin functionality, so a third party package like this isn't really what I'm looking for.\n    submitted by    /u/objective_porpoise  \n [link]   [comments]",

A longer version of my question follows.\n I am an amateur Emacsist. I've got a solid understanding of all things *nix, lisp, and configuring a text editor (from prior vim experience). I've been eagerly building up a very comfortable .emacs for the past few months, and have been loving the experience in general. However, there is one thing that bothers me which I don't believe bothers others as much, if not at all: When I try to use some package that adds to or modifies the fundamental Emacs experience — something that modifies things like buffer management, text editing or whatnot — it often clashes with my own previous customizations or even default Emacs behavior. \n For instance, If I were to use a modal editing package like Evil mode, I'd need to rebind keys to work correctly for every package I added. Think Magit for instance. Another time I faced a similar issue was when I tried popper.el. It's a great package, but It's job is to augment default buffer-handing behavior. I often ran into issues where a buffer created by a function from one package ended up in the wrong place due to popper. This is not a devastating problem as I could always just place the buffer where I want it manually, but that's the point, sort of. \n I have a very large config, and adding anything that changes the fundamental experience of Emacs becomes a software project of its own with the involvement of design, and large refactors and whatnot. I wonder if that's the case with you guys.\n Does anyone else have the same experience? Is this something I just have to settle for and solve bottom-up by solving the problems as they arise?

          "description": "Is there additional configuration needed when setting up lsp-mode with respect to the tab key for indenting?\n I've noticed that my indentations are always inconsistent. For example, when editing a React typescript component, if i just hit <TAB>, or create a new line, it indents 4 spaces from the last line. But if I highlight the region and hit <TAB> then it seems to indent based on LSP rules and indents it by 2.\n The same is true when I'm in C++ mode. While writing, and hitting tab when I'm on the line, I get the following header:\n #pragma once namespace some_name_space { class SomeClass { public: SomeClass() private: int someMember; } } \n But if I highlight the buffer and hit <TAB>, or call lsp-format-region, then I end up with:\n #pragma once namespace some_name_space { class SomeClass { public: SomeClass(); private: int someMember; } } // namespace some_name_space \n Which i assume is different because when I do that, it's calling clang-format (based on the fact that the endspace ending comment get added.)\n Is there a way to make it so that indentations will use lsp to formatting rules if lsp mode is enabled?\n    submitted by    /u/Faleira  \n [link]   [comments]",

Then, I switched to the more lightweight project-tab-groups which creates a \"tab group\" per project, but with some limitations. The latter was simple enough to inspire me to create the package I'm looking for, one-tab-per-project (or otpp).\n The idea is simple, install the package and its dependency unique-dir-name (another package of mine, created specifically for otpp), enable otpp-mode and you are good to go. Whenever you switched to a project project-switch-project (C-x p p), otpp will switch to a dedicated tab. And in case of conflicting projects names, otpp will resolve the conflict by renaming the similar tabs.\n  \nhttps://github.com/abougouffa/one-tab-per-project\n https://github.com/abougouffa/unique-dir-name\n  \nLooking for your feedback!\n    submitted by    /u/abougouffa  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hey, I'm trying to write an LSP server for a project which uses json files. First thing I am doing is parsing the JSON files and validating the syntax. Something strange is happening with the published diagnostics. Eglot is showing the actual position of the diagnostic 1 line after and 1 character before the actual reported location of the error. Here's a screenshot of the file as well as the message from the server. The error is because the 2nd line is missing a comma. As can be seen in the event log, the server is publishing the right location for the error, which is line 3 character 4. But the error actually shows up in line 4 character 3. Other language server work just fine with my emacs so it is likely that I'm doing something wrong. Is this because of a mismatch of 1-based and 0-based indexing between the server and the client? Is there a setting that I need to tweak? I took a cursory look at the LSP spec but couldn't find anything about negotiation of indexing.

          "description": "I've been working on technicolor, an abstraction above the APIs that various custom themes and theme packs use to access the colors for the currently loaded theme in emacs (like doom-themes' doom-color and modus-themes' modus-themes-get-color-value).\n The impetus is straightforward: if you are a user of a variety of themes or theme packs and you want to use your current theme's color palette somewhere in elisp, but struggle to homogenize your code across all the possible themes you might have loaded at any given time, technicolor might be worth a look.\n It works by letting you define a \"universal palette\" of colors, which is a list of colors that can sensibly be accessed in a specified collection of themes, e.g. '(red green blue). You can then set rules for each theme (or group of themes) for exactly which color in the theme's palette the universal color accesses. You can set these rules on a per-theme basis within a theme pack as well.\n From there, accessing the current theme's color reduces to (technicolor-get-color 'color), where color is an element of your universal palette. Technicolor will dispatch the appropriate API function, which you might have to write yourself, depending on the theme. \n It also provides some basic color manipulation wrapping the color library, with the same ethos that accessing the colors should be via the universal palette.\n    submitted by    /u/nanowillis  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I've been using Emacs for a very long time, but I've never done much beyond very basic tasks. Recently, I moved back to Linux on my desktop, and I'm using Emacs a lot more, so I started running Emacs as a user service systemctl --user enable emacs.service and aliased the Emacs command to emacsclient. \n I'm having some trouble on a few items and was wondering if y'all could provide some advice:\n  \nIs there a way, from a shell cmdline, to start emacsclient in magit mode? I find myself either launching with an unnecessary dired buffer with emacsclient . or a useless scratch buffer if I use emacsclient -t. \n \nLet's say I have previous opened files A, B, C, D, and then quit out of emacsclient. If I run emacsclient E, if I C-x k on E, the client exits. However, if I C-x k on those other buffers, they're killed normally and the client continues running. Is there a way so that killing that \"E\" buffer doesn't exit the client?\n \nI need some recommendations for packages that help me handle buffers. C-x b is getting way too annoying, especially combined with the previous point where if I kill the \"launching file\" it kicks me out of the client. I'm broadly thinking of some kind of tab bar or side frame that lists buffers (with some file path) that has good navigation. I do a lot of work that involves using the shell and manpages, and it's so obnoxious how those buffers use an asterisk...\n \n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/fandingo  \n [link]   [comments]",

I want to either edit or completely rewrite this mode but I have some questions about how Elisa works.\n  \nCurrently the mode is supposed to automatically format object code and this works with any object declared with the language’s Object or Class keywords but if you create a class called (for example) Room it won’t recognize that word as declaring an object and thus won’t format it correctly. Would it be possible upon opening an Inform 6 file to have the mode dynamically identify such objects and format them correctly, or is that impossible? Currently I’m having to add the names of new objects manually to the package just to get it to format code correctly, and honestly even without doing that the package seems to get confused fairly easily.\n \nAre there any good tutorials on creating a language major mode from scratch? I am interested in learning some lisp anyway so will already be consulting the GNU documentation, but really any kind of quick primer to understand how Elisp “talks” to the rest of the editor might help speed things up a bit.\n \n    submitted by    /u/myothercat  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello all!\n I've been using Emacs for a while so far, but there is a thing that bothers me quite a lot: dual-space CJK fonts and their alignment.\n CJK programming fonts usually provide both half-width characters (for Latin alphabets) and full-width characters (for CJK characters). Thus, when rendering, the width of a full-width characters must exactly equal to that of two half-width characters.\n This is where Emacs fails; even fonts like Sarasa Gothic (which I know that they line up nicely elsewhere) will not line up when I actually use them. This is especially annoying when editing tables on Org-mode or Markdown, since the columns don't line up.\n I've noticed for two Korean programming fonts I purchased (semteulche and hesalche) the characters line up if and only if the font height is set to exactly 110 and 120 respectively (or their integer multiples). I could repeat this process for all fonts, but in my HiDPI screen, I'd like to have my fonts taller than at least 130.\n Basically, what happens is below:\n \\\"hesalche\\\", height 120. They line up nicely.\n \\\"hesalche\\\", height 140 (which is my preferred font height). Columns start breaking up.\n \\\"hesalche\\\", height 240. 240 is an integer multiple of 120, so the columns are back straight.\n Is there a way to fix this problem?\n Here is the relevent section in my WIP configuration file.\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/rangho-lee  \n [link]   [comments]",

Thanks to the Doom Emacs shipping, I knew of magit, projectile, LSPs and other utilities, but Emacs itself always came with wonderful \"utilities\" (e.g., M-x doctor, hanoi, calc, calendar, org ...) and just only to mention an example, I recently knew of M-x re-builder which I found awesome when doing M-x replace-regexp.\n In the end, I always feel like I'm not aware of a lot of functionalities in Emacs which are there, at my finger tips and thus the question, what are your favorite services/utilities/functions available in (Doom)Emacs?\n    submitted by    /u/Phovox  \n [link]   [comments]",

Also it should automatically output the current buffer to stdout and argv arguments could be easier to retrieve.\n Sure common lisp would probably be better for most answers but my brain has been trained to do things in a emacs buffer and by god thats how its gonna be!\n Long story short, lots of tweaks could be made to make elisp code shorter albeit harder to read. I considered byte compiling the code but it was actually more bytes! Maybe the solution is to use keyboard hotkeys?

          "description": "Sorry for the confusing title, but I'm having trouble describing my problem.\n I find window behavior in emacs is very difficult to understand. There are many commands that either create a new window or replace the current buffer with a \"temporary\" buffer (eg help window). And some commands simply replace the buffer in current window, some replace the buffer in the other window, still others create a new split. And when something takes over an existing window, sometimes when quitting it returns the previous buffer, and other times it removes the window altogether.\n So far I have not been able to discern a method to this madness and I am often surprised by what happens. A lot of winner-undo.\n First question: is there any underlying logic here I'm not seeing? Or is it just a free for all?\n Second question: how do you handle this? Memorize/internalize how each command will behave? Rely heavily on winner mode? Something else? \n I recently stumbled on popper.el so was thinking to give that a try.

Everyone else on my team uses Visual Studio (obviously) and the files are encoded with `UTF-8-BOM` or `utf-8-with-signature-dos` in Emacs speak. Emacs somehow wasn't reading these files properly and kept saying the encoding is ISO-LATIN-1 and would just print the BOM characters literally on the screen. I had no clue about all this except that I saw 3 weird characters every time I opened any file. So yesterday I decided to dig deep and gather whatever I can to fix this. After trying a few approaches what worked is `(prefer-coding-system 'utf-8-with-signature-dos)`. The files are read properly now and the language server is also happy. I use Sharper to build and run my project and it started failing after this change. It uses `shell-command-to-string` and others to run `dotnet` commands in the project. The commands fail with\n 'ï»¿dotnet' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.\n The first 3 characters are BOM and windows command prompt cannot handle this encoding.

However, my project does not have TS, it's an older React project in plain JS.\n Now the problem is typescript-language-server will report type errors and throw the error on some JSX components that these cannot be used as JSX components which is really annoying. Is there any way to resolve this? In VSCode for example there is an option javascript.validate.enable\": false to add to the editor config and it will not validate the JS files anymore, however, it will still provide code fix suggestions, like imports for example.\n If there is no way to do this, is there a way to at least somehow get the import fixes working or connect eglot to some eslint server if such exists instead of typescript-language-server?\n Thanks!\n EDIT: \n The eglot code-actions do not work at all, I cannot fix imports anymore. Good thing is that I was able to get both eglot / eslint reports to show up in Flycheck, but code actions do not work and it still reports the type errors as well.

However, recently I have noticed that more people recommend project.el because it is lighter and has the backing of the Emacs maintainers. Therefore, I want to give it a try.\n One confusion about project.el is how to specify a project if no version control exists.\n For example, suppose I have the following directory:\n \\---myproject | +---subproject1 | \\---.git | | Makefile | \\---subproject2 \\---.git | Makefile \n How to specify myproject as a project? Note that the myproject itself is under VC. \n By projectile, I just add a empty .projectile to myproject.\n From Emacs docs:\n  \nWhether a given directory is a root of some project is determined by the project-specific infrastructure, known as project back-end. Emacs currently supports two such back-ends: VC-aware (see Version Control), whereby a VCS repository is considered a project; and EDE (see Emacs Development Environment). This is expected to be extended in the future to support additional types of projects.\n  \nTherefore I have to write a back-end by myself? or use EDE which seems rarely used?\n Thanks.\n    submitted by    /u/chansey97  \n [link]   [comments]",

It does the job for me but I'm curious if there is a way to make full use of c-mode functionality to do that without having to write a super complicated elisp function that checks if the symbol at point is a C type and then indents it to the right column (with potential backtracking also). \n I think the short answer is probably no but I'm curious how you would deal with this if you were in my situation or/and if you personally had to do any \"hacks\" to your c-mode config to fit some project's guidelines. \n I quickly skimmed through manual, it probably has all the answers I need but nothing really stood out to me at first glance.\n    submitted by    /u/ismbks  \n [link]   [comments]",

If you have any questions or encounter issues, please report them on GitHub :)\n P.S.\n I also tested the themes using the emacs -nw command.

          "description": "Hello! I'm a writer, and a programmer. I've in the past obviously leaned towards vim for my text editing & writing, and have become very comfortable in that environment with vim movements.\n Recently I've decided to give emacs a try (as I've always wanted to), and after hearing about org-mode (& org-novelist, export with pandoc, etc) I wanted to try and move my workflow over to emacs for writing. I have a few questions though:\n What is the best way to move around a text file, in your experience? I'm of course reading through documentation, but things like sexp movement don't benefit much from prose! In Vim I could move to any line and any word with a pretty quick series of inputs: is this possible in emacs?\n What are some must haves in the config? i'm doing vanilla (please don't recommend evil--I want to experience emacs for what it is) This is specifically for writing. I know emacs has thousands of commands, and I can only imagine it has a similar amount of settings (setq's? what are these called?)\n I already have lived a long life with capslock as ctrl (started after i got a HHKB, couldnt' go back) but is there a way to use meta/alt as spacebar instead? I know I said no evil, but space as my leader key has been something of a game change in terms of ergonomics for me.\n Finally I plan on just using bleeding edge, building from source. I know theres some exciting things that have just came out, or will be coming out in 30. Has anyone had any issues using the --pgtk with wayland? It's hard to find any communication about this back and forth online (i suppose a lot of emacs folks are still on mailing lists or on matrix and not reddit/discord)\n I'll appreciate any feedback, even if it's not regarding a question.

The content should be read-only, but on key press I want to fetch data from a server, generate a collapsible/expandable tree from the result, be able to navigate the items and trigger further actions on the focussed items by more keypresses.\n I'm new to elisp, but data fetching, parsing etc. is not what gives me a headache - I'm familiar enough with Clojure to have a grap of lisps and willing to learn the language \"enough\".\n The great unknown for me are the emacs internals on how to actually build the ui. Are there any introductions, tutorials or simple examples I can use to learn from? I could start with magit, which does all what I'd like incredibly well, but I feel like that's a little over my head ;)\n Of course, best practices for fetching and parsing JSON are appreciated, too.\n    submitted by    /u/DeepDay6  \n [link]   [comments]",

I use both The Archive and ia Writer to make Zettels.\n\n\nan I automatically update the format of all my Zettels so they're consistent? I've tried different templates and would like to remove the YAML formatting instead of a simplified design and one that doesn't hide tags and ID numbers when printed.\n\n\nMy current workflow involves using Zettels to take notes as I learn more about ADHD. Some of these Zettels contain strategies for coping with ADHD and include links to other Zettels that provide additional context and research.\nI want to carry these notes in an A5 binder so that they are available when needed. Many of the programming solutions are over my head, but there could be an easy way to update Zettels to the same format and print them. I know iA Writer has an export template function, but I'm no coder. \nThanks for any advice you can provide!",
