I want to write a parser for a simple DSL using Megaparsec and for this I'm following the Megaparsec tutorial here. At the beginning of the tutorial the author provides the following example for constructing a parser for the string \"abc\": haskell -- Parsec as defined in the library is: -- type Parsec e s a = ParsecT e s Identity a type Parser = Parsec Void Text mySequence :: Parser (Char, Char, Char) mySequence = do a <- char 'a' b <- char 'b' c <- char 'c' return (a, b, c) Here is what I'm trying to understand, char has the signature: char :: (MonadParsec e s m,‏‏‎‏‏‎‏‏‎‏‏‎­Token s ~ Char) => Token s -> m (Token s) see docs here. In our case m is Identity and (Token s) is Char, so char 'a' should return Identity Char and therefore the do block in mySequence should resolve to value of type Identity (Char, Char, Char), or am I missing something? My question is, how can the type of mySequence be of type Parser (Char, Char, Char) instead of Identity (Char, Char, Char)? Is this some monad transformer magic in ParsecT that allows for this? Similarly later in the tutorial the author introduces the following example using <|>: haskell pScheme :: Parser Text pScheme = string \"data\" <|> string \"file\" <|> string \"ftp\" <|> string \"http\" <|> string \"https\" <|> string \"irc\" <|> string \"mailto\" Same thing here, string \"data\" <|> string \"file\" has the signature: haskell <|> :: Identity Text -> Identity Text -> Identity Text So how come that it can be resolved to Parser Text and not Identity Text?

Each constructor within designates a command subparser and its field type designates a record type containing all the options for this specific subparser.\n I'm generalizing/automating this pattern using generics-sop. The code is quite large so I'll post it in this gist.\n I'm curious whether that implementation could be simplified. By simplification, I'm mostly mean less noise. I'm curious whether there are utility functions, types and constraints provided by generics-sop already that invalidate the need for typeclasses like NSFrom and similar types I've handrolled there. I'd also be curious to know whether certain snippets could be improved in a general sense.\n    submitted by    /u/Phantom569  \n [link]   [comments]",

This time we are running an extended study with more advanced interactive features of Chameleon.\n If you are interested in helping us with our human-centered programming tool research or checking out our Haskell type-level interactive tools, please click this link to proceed https://blend.ercu.be/consent. We use telemetrics to gather usage data for this study, but it is totally anonymous. We won't ask you for personal data (email, name, phone number, etc.). It will take you about 20 - 30 minutes to complete. But in turn, it will help us immensely.\n If you are interested in this research, there're links to the paper and video at ICFP 2021.

This means that you can set up things like parsers combinators that can be \"viewed\" as an abstract grammar, in addition to a parser.\n (An issue of course is that, when using arrows, you can't use the outputs of an arrow to determine what effects to imply.

Read more about how to embed Okapi apps into Servant here.\n Hello Community,\n Over the past few weeks I've been working on a new server-side microframework called Okapi (I'm open to name suggestions).\n Okapi is a monadic parser, but for HTTP requests. It's inspired by F#'s Giraffe and the simplicity of web frameworks in other programming languages like Python and Ruby. It's meant to be a simple, idiomatic alternative to other frameworks in the Haskell ecosystem. A summary of what Okapi is can be found here.\n If you're interested in testing Okapi out, take a look at the documentation. I recommend going through the crash course (still finishing it) to get a feel for what you can do with this library.\n To see an example of what a web server built with Okapi looks like, take a look at this implementation of the realworld backend spec. You can use it to compare it to other implementations of the same spec. The Okapi implementation passes all the required tests and is a good idea of what you can expect from the framework.\n Okapi is still in the early experimental stage, so I would highly recommend NOT to use it for production projects or important side projects. The API is subject to major changes. The main reason why I want to show Okapi to the community this early in its' development is to get feedback as soon as possible to make sure this is something worth investing more time into. I'd love to hear opinions from Haskellers and non-Haskellers of all skill levels and backgrounds.\n If you'd like to open an issue or PR, the repo is here. Contributions are more than welcome.\n Here are some more interesting links:\n  \nMotivation behind Okapi\n Inspiration for Okapi\n Another example\n GitHub repo\n Edit: Servant+Okapi Example\n  \n   submitted by    /u/MonadicSystems  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm not really opposed to another language if anyone has a really great library in another language but that's perhaps off topic. I'm having trouble finding a library that really does everything I want.\n What I'm trying to do is draw a series of SVGs that are all varied but similar in many ways. So code sharing is important, which is why I can't do this in SVG and I need a programming language to generate them. I need to load in SVGs that I'm using from other sources as icons and also fonts and things like that.\n This is what I've looked into and found.\n svg-tree seems to be the library with the ability to read in SVG files and parse them into internal docs to manipulate.\n lucid-svg, which is recommended by svg-tree for doing actual drawing, doesn't seem to have this, but is much better for providing a drawing API, which I'll be using a lot of.\n svg-builder is very similar to lucid-svg, same up sides, a bit of an annoying use of hard to read operators for the attributes instead of just using tuples and lists, in my opinion, but fine, no reader still though.\n blaze-svg seems to not have any parser either, have much less documentation, and have a less nice API for drawing.\n I don't think the svg-tree data types are compatible with lucid-svg, but that'd be nice if they were based on each other.\n Does anyone know of a good setup for what I'm trying to do?\n    submitted by    /u/dskippy  \n [link]   [comments]",

The GUI displays one of two meshes: mesh A or mesh B; the user can switch between them by clicking a checkbox. My event network looks like this:\n ---checkbox---+ | -------A------+---AorB---+ | | -------B------+ +---mesh--- | --------drawParams-------+ \n The problem is that every time I click the checkbox, the mesh now being visualized (either A or B) is regenerated, which takes quite a while. The event network doesn't trigger it -- changes A shows no activity -- but a trace in the (pure) generation function shows that the mesh being activated is being regenerated.\n (It used to be worse; before switching with switchB, I was generating AorB with, essentially, liftA3 ifThenElse, which made both of the meshes regenerate every time the checkbox was clicked!)\n I note, however, that merely changing the draw parameters does not result in a rebuilding of the mesh; apparently the value of AorB is cached in some way. Is there a way in reactive-banana to request this behaviour; that is, to tell it to cache the value of some Behavior so it doesn't have to recompute it when using it further down the network? Failing that, is there some simple way to do the caching myself? (I can just about see how to do it using IORefs and something like imposeChanges, but a simpler way would be better.)\n    submitted by    /u/gilgamec  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi all,\n I am trying to wrap my head around the Profunctor typeclasses.\n Notably, I am trying to find out why there isn't a lot of code around using something like Monoidal/ProductProfuctor and instead there seems to have been a decision to go for Traversing and similar typeclasses.\n I have been looking mostly at this discussion from a couple of years ago that has the following:\n  \ndavemenendez says that you can implement wander using the Monoidal typeclass (which, as far as I can tell, is only true if your profunctor is representable?)\n ekmett says that Monoidal is implemented via Traversing in the profunctors lib (which doesn't make sense to me, because I don't see how one can write one in terms of the other)\n  \nThere's the glassery blog post from Oleg that also mentions Monoidal, but with disappointment because it doesn't bring much on top of Choice, if I understand correctly (but I don't see e.g. Costar mentioned in the table where this conclusion is reached).\n I have spent a couple of hours trying to implement Monoidal in terms of Traversing and vice-versa and gone nowhere unless I also bring Representable to the table, but there are some good examples for non-representable instances of Monoidal so I don't want to do this.\n Either I am missing some cool trick in my bag of tricks or I really don't understand what's happening here.\n Anyone got some illuminating text or notes or something?\n    submitted by    /u/crisoagf  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I understand that this might come across as rude, and I apologise in advance if it does, but is anyone able to give me some rationale for why the Yesod forms API is the way it is? It seems to me to be incredibly overcomplicated. There's a mess of boilerplate, what with creating a data type and generating a widget from it, even if you need all of two fields, as in the case of a login form. In particular, controlling the layout and appearance of the form seems to be extremely cumbersome. The applicative API seems basically useless, given that you don't have any control over appearance - as soon as you want to do something as simple as tweak the label font size you have to drop to the monadic API.\n I'm coming from Flask here, so my reference point that you just write your form in a jinja2 template, in which you have full and straightforward control over the form's layout and appearance, then you access the form data from a request like so:\n ``` @app.route(\"/login\", methods=(\"GET\", \"POST\")) def login(): \"\"\"Log in a registered user by adding the user id to the session.\"\"\" if request.method == \"POST\": username = request.form[\"username\"] password = request.form[\"password\"]\n  # do things with username and password \n ```\n Why not have something similar in Yesod, simply write the form as a Hamlet widget, and access the form data by name, instead of all this stuff with creating a datatype and generating the widget from it using generateFormPost and runFormPost? I'm new to Yesod, so I understand I'm probably missing a lot of information. But I don't think I require much expertise to state that I'm finding the API pretty unpleasant to use.\n    submitted by    /u/sullyj3  \n [link]   [comments]",

Thing is this type error is messing with me, and I'm not sure how to resolve it. First of all, is my interpretation of what an effect is wrong? Secondly, why is Counter a /= Counter b in this error message? They're both generic, so why is it having trouble with a = b?\n    submitted by    /u/RegularTetragon  \n [link]   [comments]",

How could you possibly write a computer program without telling the computer what to do (the how)?\n The closest answer I've gathered is that FP is essentially about term rewriting systems (using beta reduction in particular). A rewriting step is analogous to a state transition step in turing machines. So then that means the compiler handles all the control flow for you, rather than FP somehow magically eliminating the need for control flow and other imperative ideas.\n Is this understanding correct?

I discovered the following while traversing a data structure with a State monad, but it's easier to demonstrate with the IO monad. \n If I use boolean operators, they will only evaluate the arguments that they need. e.g.: \n Prelude> False && undefined False Prelude> True && undefined *** Exception: Prelude.undefined \n So far, so good. This is what you'd expect. However, if I use the liftM group of functions to lift && to a monad, this no longer works. e.g.:\n falsify :: IO Bool falsify = putStrLn \"It is a falsehood.\" >> return False verify :: IO Bool verify = putStrLn \"Verily, it is so.\" >> return True liftedAnd :: Monad m => m Bool -> m Bool -> m Bool liftedAnd = liftM2 (&&) \n Then, calling it in ghci:\n *Main> falsify `liftedAnd` verify It is a falsehood. Verily, it is so. False \n So, you can't use liftedAnd for flow control. It's easy enough to write an AND function that behaves properly:\n mAnd :: Monad m => m Bool -> m Bool -> m Bool mAnd x y = x >>= \\b -> if b then y else return False \n Now, in ghci:\n *Main> falsify `mAnd` verify It is a falsehood. False \n So, my questions are:\n  \nWould someone please explain why liftM2 behaves this way?\n Is there somewhere in the standard libraries to look for properly behaved && || if/then/else etc. for monads?\n Am I missing some key fact about liftM2?

Its paradigm feels extremely natural in a way beyond the complexity of its encoding would suggest. eg looking at the implementation of reflex a few times, it seems to basically implement an entire runtime system on top of haskell's runtime system.\n On one hand it's very cool that haskell is flexible enough to implement a runtime system as a library, but I wonder if there's gains to be made in something more wired in (eg in terms of optimization, simplifying compile times, simplifying types, etc.) - it always struck my as a bit hacky.\n I know elm used to have builtin FRP but dropped it (I don't recall exactly why - any insight here would help!)\n Perhaps a proper \"dataflow\" language - though my (poorly informed) impression is that these are all way more special purpose and I've been spoiled by the full power of haskell.\n What do you think?\n EDIT: Looking into it more now - I redescovered this explanation of why Elm dropped FRP. It's honestly pretty disappointing - I understand from a developer UX perspective this simplifies a lot of things, but I'm not a fan of the redux \"smash-everything-into-one-type\" pattern - and a big draw for FRP is having the control flow represent dependency locality rather than synchronizing everything on one monlithic state\n    submitted by    /u/CoBuddha  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello Haskell-ers!\n I'm looking to implement a JSON linter and would appreciate some library / architecture suggestions. Some examples of the kind issues i'm interested in detecting are:\n  \nThe field \"base_path\", if it exists, cannot use Windows paths, must be POSIX\n The field \"date_created\" must be in ISO8601\n etc.\n  \nI'm capable of writing the linter rules (i.e. detect date formats, path formats etc.), what I need help with is the IO / initial parsing phase. I'm familiar with parser-combinators (attoparsec has been my goto previously) but never before had a use case that cares about where the parsing failed. I've also used aeson a couple of times for handling JSON.\n The defining requirement is that, once an issue has been identified, the linter must report the location of the error including line number(s) and column numbers (start and end). It can be assumed that the data is valid JSON and conforms to the expected schema (i.e. if we expect a \"date_created\" field, it'll be there. I'm interested in format/quality issues rather than validating structure / syntax.\n Otherwise, the only requirement is that it be quick / run in parallel - It must be able to run over thousands of files in a couple of minutes.\n My initial plan was to use something like pipes-aeson for IO (not used a streaming library before but seems straightforward enough) however it seems that aeson is based on attoparsec and the parse-error is just a plain string without source locations.\n So, finally, to some questions.\n  \nAnybody have recommendations for parsing JSON (quickly) while keeping track of the source-locations of each field / key / value / object etc.\n Can streaming libraries like pipes be used to process the loaded files in parallel? Pointers / articles etc. covering this would be much appreciated!\n  \n   submitted by    /u/LivewareIssue  \n [link]   [comments]",

Maybe it's actually possible just with library support for something like a linear ResourceT monad but that still feels a bit unsatisfying)\n As far as I can tell, it's solely the brainchild of Tweag - which is great to have industry support, but worrying in terms of robustness and longterm support as GHC develops. Linear types really needs fairly deep integration with the rest of GHC to be most useful.\n  \n1/2/3 are the only ones really stopping me from going all-in on linearity right now, but I expect all of them to get resolved eventually so long as 7 isn't an issue.\n So my question is: What's the latest developments on linear types in haskell / who is working on it / what's the best place to keep updated?\n    submitted by    /u/CoBuddha  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi everyone, is there an alternative formulation of monad transformers that allow removing any reference to the base monad inside the e.g. bind definition of the transformer ? \n The reason I'm asking for that is I'm porting some Haskell transformers to Python, for which I would like to avoid chains of lift.lift.lift... \n A good way I found is simply to make a custom subclass of each transformer in the stack, so that they can be looked up for their lift by \"tag\" (the specific subclass) rather than numerical position (aka number of lift nesting). That would make composition of function using different monads very easy, even if they have not been designed to work together specifically \n This would still allows the user to use multiple transformers of the same type (e.g. StateT), since the user can create as many subclasses of StateT they want for each piece of state.\n The problem with that is that if the user uses e.g. SubclassofStateT.pure(42), the base monad is not known , and has to be \"resolved\" later (when looking up the index of this class in the stack to lift appropriately). Unfortunately automatic, lifting is not enough since the definition of e.g. pure() would require the knowledge of the base monad which we don't have at this stage. Hence the need for an alternative formulation that allows delaying this knowledge to later.\n EDIT: fix typos\n    submitted by    /u/Dasher38  \n [link]   [comments]",

It is about comparing lazy vs strict evaluation about the expression\n head (map f xs) where xs is a list of length n.\n -> With Strict evaluation the function f is applied to all elements in xs after which the first element of the list is retrieved. So function f is applied n times.\n -> With lazy evaluation the expression is reduced to\n let p = map f xs in head (p)\n which reduces to f applies to the first element in XS. i.e. f xs0 \n ​\n In the second part of the question, there is a function filter p which when applied to a list returns a list of elements that satisfies the boolean test p.\n filter :: (a -> Bool) -> [a] -> [a]\n head . filter p xs returns the first element that satisfies the condition p. \n In the question I'm having a hard time visualizing how lazy evaluation will work. With innermost reduction, the filter is applied to each element of the list and a list with elements that satisfies p is returned and head takes the first element of the list. \n How will lazy evaluation work here? applying p to the input list might prune away elements from the output. \n Is it that with lazy evaluation, filter p is applied only until the first element in the list meets the criteria as opposed to eager evaluation where filter p is applied to all elements in the input list?\n    submitted by    /u/AngstyChippy  \n [link]   [comments]",

As source I have an Excel file that I read into Databricks using Scala, e.g.\n val apoDF = spark.read .format(\"csv\") .option(\"header\", \"true\") //first line in file has headers .option(\"delimiter\",\";\") .option(\"mode\", \"PERMISSIVE\") .load(\"dbfs:/FileStore/shared_uploads/[MY_ACCOUNT]/[SOURCE_FILE].csv\") apoDF.createOrReplaceTempView(\"apo\") \n The Excel file contains all info I need to rebuild the SQL statements, like ids, source view (string), object ids...\n So, after reading the Excel file into Databricks I get a DataFrame.\n The data I need from this file as multidimensional array would look like this:\n ​\n https://preview.redd.it/hmcgc5xbuar81.png?width=934&format=png&auto=webp&s=8b0a5bca137992544b67ca9871e2fb14a8c65c1a\n Since I'm coming from webDev / php I still think in multidimensional arrays and the concept of DataFrames is new to me.\n What is best practice? Should I build a multidimensional array first and query afterwards the data I need from it? Something tells me that this wouldn't make that much sense since all data is available already in the dataFrame?\n What I am trying right now is to localize the data I need and store in a variable, e.g.\n val uViewName = spark.sql(\"SELECT View_Name FROM apo WHERE Param_Id = 2869169\") uViewName.show() \n This could be packed into a function .... or method of class?\n Thanks for any advice, much appreciated!\n    submitted by    /u/cptstoneee  \n [link]   [comments]",

I want to transition my team of novice high-school students from Java.\n EDIT: I shouldn't have assumed that people would just be familiar with FIRST... I've had a few questions asking exactly what I my use case is. Essentially, students are given 8 weeks to build a robot for a competition. We aren't told the rules in advance, so everyone has the same 8 week period to design, build, and program the robot.\n However, off-season teams tend to do things like write general purpose code (e.g., movement) or streamline processes, make practice robots, etc.\n The library used in the competition (optional; teams can also create low level code from scratch, but almost nobody does) is called WPILIB. It's primarily a Java and C++ framework, which you can read about here.\n I recently became an F# evangelist and found that functional programming has greatly reduced the fragility of my code by way of ensuring a correct data model.\n I am looking to move our team to possibly using Spring and definitely using Scala or Kotlin.\n One of my fellow mentors has suggested that object oriented design is easier to reason with in the case of a robot, and suggested Kotlin as our next language.\n I suggested that functional programming can definitely be used to model a Robotics systems and ensure that invalid states are explicitly rejected while making the program easier to debug and test.\n Regardless of which language we pick, everyone will be learning it (and Spring) from scratch. \n What are your thoughts? Which language will better suit what we're trying to do?\n EDIT 2: We have decided on Kotlin for the main application code for now, but if Scala makes more sense for certain use cases (e.g., programming autonomous mode functions) we will be open to writing those modules in Scala. I still welcome any discussions.\n    submitted by    /u/sonicbhoc  \n [link]   [comments]",

Primarily I do Data Analysis, because of my academic Machine Learning background, which makes my role closer to Data Scientist. \n However, I am interested to work on Distributed System, Databases, and Stream Processing- that is Distributed Data Systems in broad. I wrote a Microservice in Golang in my current workplace. But I do not think this experience is sufficient to get hired as a Data Engineer working on Distributed Systems.\n I guess, after talking to some other Data Engineers and going through job posts, a project that involves mocking data streams, data ingestion with Kafka, data processing with Flink, serving with ad-hoc Scala microservices, containerization with Docker, and deploying on a Kubernetes (MiniKube perhaps?) cluster might help. What else to add or remove?\n What may I do to learn and later get hired to work as a Data Engineer working on Distributed Systems?\n    submitted by    /u/yoctotoyotta  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi!\n [Disclaimer] I just started learning Scala. So I hope this question is not too basic.\n I'm doing the Advent of Code 2021 challenges to get a feeling for the language. Day 2 is a task where we have to parse a file, where each line contains a command. Each command updates one of 2 variables. I've tried to implement this using a functional programming style. I convert the commands to (Int, Int) tuples, where each element is a delta introduced by the command. Then, I need to sum these tuples element-wise (like a vector sum). Doing this sum was not very nice, because Scala seems to disallow tuple destructuring in (anonymous) function parameter position. Am I missing something?\n Also, do you have suggestions how I could make my code more idiomatic? I would love to hear them!\n Thank you in advance!\n  def problem1_tuples(input: Iterator[String]): Int = { // input is an iterator of lines val (position, depth) = input.map(s => ( applyRegex(s,forward_pattern), // returns update for first value in tuple or 0 applyRegex(s,down_pattern) - applyRegex(s,up_pattern) // update for second value )).fold((0,0))((a,b) => (a._1 + b._1, a._2 + b._2)) // this is *ugly* position * depth // the challenge asks for the product } \n    submitted by    /u/flo-l  \n [link]   [comments]",

Whenever I've tried to write a full app using purely FP design principles, it feels like it becomes a mess as I layer on more and more features. Because of this, I feel my main limitation is how to use functional composition for a larger system when dealing with network requests/responses, database operations, dependency injection, loose coupling, etc. I can write an application that does all these things, I just haven't been really happy with the results.\n What I'm hoping to get is one of two things. The first would be an example codebase, something open on GitHub. Something using, maybe, http4s and cats? Something that I can look through and study how it's been architected, maybe even transcribe it (I have found that re-writing code makes it stick in my head better than just reading it).\n On the other hand, maybe there are some tutorials/courses/etc out there which cover this kind of stuff. I really do NOT want one of those \"This is a functor\" type FP courses, I don't need that at this point. Something that goes much deeper into full-scale application construction is what I'm after.\n Thanks in advance for any help and guidance you can provide.\n    submitted by    /u/Droid2Win  \n [link]   [comments]",

On the PureScript side, we use our own purescript-react-basic bindings, and purescript-lumi-components, a UI component library that we built and open-sourced. We get a lot of utility from PureScript’s type system, leveraging the compiler in order to ensure that we don’t get IDs for different entities mixed up, that all API calls are type correct, and that all form data is appropriately validated before it is used. On the Haskell side, we primarily use Servant and Esqueleto. We don’t expect candidates to have experience with all these things. We’d like to find engineers who are interested in learning more about these, and we’ll be happy to teach you.\n Lumi was recently acquired by Narvar, where we are continuing to grow the team and leveraging Narvar’s experience building the software infrastructure that powers billions of e-commerce shipments for companies like Patagonia, Nike, GAP, Home Depot, etc.\n    submitted by    /u/kepano  \n [link]   [comments]",

I just needed a platform where i could finally share my appreciation for org-mode and emacs in general as none of my peers share that fascination. \n I'm in the process of writing my bachelor-thesis, and emacs/org-mode generally helped me a lot over the course of my studying. From software assignments using various major-modes and LSP to note-taking using org-roam, literate-programming using org-babel, version-controlling everything with magit and server administration using TRAMP. \n Unfortunately, we have to use our University's LaTeX Template and converting the template to org would take time that i currently don't have. Otherwise, i would prefer writing everything in org-mode...\n At the very least, i can use it for literature aggregation, note-taking (org-noter) and running various statistics!\n The following screenshot shows org-mode using DoomEmacs (own configuration is on my todo list).\n I use ess and literate programming to quickly write and document various statistic functions on my database, which i can then import in LaTeX. \n Thanks org-mode <3\n So, a big THANK YOU to everyone involved and the helpful posts I've seen on this sub.

          "description": "Hi, r/orgmode!\n Since citations in orgmode are now native (hurray!), I've come to wonder whether it is possible to use the same document as the source for the citations.\n Via org-babel blocks it is possible to write a bibliography in orgmode and tangle it to a bib-file. This mechanism is sufficient if you decide to use only one or two org documents for literature summaries, reading lists etc. like Gregory Stein does. But it becomes unwieldy, if you want to use a single file per book/article with self-contained bibliographic information, because you have to create a lot of single bibliographies, that clutter up the org-folder.\n The selfcontainment of bibliographic information seems very attractive for me because single files can be shared without thinking about needed supplementary files. Further, it would be possible to copy bibliographic entries between files and create project-specific bib-files for LaTeX use, without having a huge bibfile, of which the most part stays unused, and still have a consistent bib-key.\n As far as I can see Nicolas Rougier's org-bib-mode doesn't do that, but uses a corresponding bib-file.\n Do you know ways to achieve that or do you think it's a rather stupid idea, that brings a lot of hassle with it?\n Thank you!\n    submitted by    /u/Hero_D0t  \n [link]   [comments]",

With org-mode being hierarchical and all, I can't really just make another heading and then go back to the parent header at some arbitrary point. From what I've understood, adding new babel blocks is rather easy, but I'm not sure if it'd be easy or hard to implement something like this for org crypt.

The last meetup was rather unhelpful in this regard since we dove into a specific use-case.\n I plan to try once more providing a more general introduction to Org (and Emacs) debugging. Tentatively, I plan to talk about: 1. Running Emacs with clean configuration + latest version of Org 2. Bisecting config to find configuration-related issues 3. Using Emacs profiler and sharing profiler results 4. Answer any questions on the first three topics\n After the introduction, we can continue with interactive debugging if there is anyone experiencing performance (or other) issues with Org and willing to share screen.\n Note that using microphone and/or camera should not be required. Jitsi does have chat.\n The time will be the same: 9pm SG time (4pm Moscow; 8am New York; 1pm London).

I had originally thought to use org-roam-protocol's roam-ref, but I think I don't understand how the file-ref which org-roam-protocol requires works.\n It seems intended mostly for citation purposes, which I think could work (maybe there'd be a way to get from emacs back to the projectwarrior project eventually?). But to do that, I think I'd need to write some sort of custom citation format. Unfortunately my Google-fu is failing me at the moment, as searching \"new org-ref protocol\", \"custom org-roam-ref citation format\" and several other related results hasn't brought up any results that pointed me in the right direction. So, here's the question(s):\n  \nIs there a way I can suppress the warnings from org-roam when I put a ref that is plaintext? This isn't actually my preferred solution, but I figure I'd start here.\n Is there a place I can find instructions on how to create a custom whatever-it-is that org-roam is expecting in the ref field?\n Is there another approach to opening (or creating if necessary) an org-roam node from the command line?

Never liked using those big IDE but, since my whole team uses VS Code, I thought to give it a go and generate the least amount of friction on the first week. Yeah, didn't like.\n BUT what I've loved was a VS Code extension named \"auto doc string\" which could automatically create a doc string and already place some information, like which arguments, what are the returns and, most important, type annotations were reflected in the doc string.\n Sure, there must be a package in emacs that could do all that, right? I have yet to found it. The closest I got was yasnippet-radical-snippets, but it doesn't support types (yet).\n Does anyone know a better tool for the job?\n    submitted by    /u/Ieremies  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I have recently been playing around a bit with helm for my personal use and, though helm per se is absolutely great, i have found the lack of documentation to be extremely annoying. Now I get it, its open source etc. and just read the source code, but I have been unable to figure out quite a few things from the source.\n So, my first question: Can anybody point me towards some good helm documentation that is not the wiki(https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm/wiki), which is extremely lacking if you want to write your own sources instead of just using helm and that is not outdated (like this https://kitchingroup.cheme.cmu.edu/blog/2015/01/24/Anatomy-of-a-helm-source/).\n Then two more questions:\n  \nHow can you do multiple columns in a helm source? For example, helm-mini shows file size,name, absolute path etc., all in different columns.\n How can you show something, but not make it searchable. Say I have a special source for various user-defined commands, and I want to provide not only the name, but also a short description of it, or its keybindings etc, without including them in the filtering, like helm-M-x does.\n  \n​\n EDIT:Here the answer by the current helm maintainer (I think) -> https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm/discussions/2493 (Summary: Use :match-part to only match against parts of the options). Thanks a lot for the extremely fast answer. Also, there really needs to be a better helm documentation. It is such a great tool, but anything other than the most basic extensions requires you to dive into the source code/ask the maintainer, which is less than ideal, I think.\n    submitted by    /u/Kram33r  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'd like to be able to just mark these tasks as DONE and also directly (and easily) add the hours worked. I might not know the exact start and end time I worked on the project, and I don't want to have to go fudge some clock-in/out time. (Unless there's a super easy way to fudge it!) I suppose it would be something like an HOURS_WORKED property.\n And I'd also like to be able to generate a report of all such activity/time for the day, for the week, for the month, etc. Ideally, that could somehow be combined with my clock report, but I'd be happy even if it were a separate report. \n Maybe this functionality is already in clock-in/out feature set?

I find it invaluable as I switch between a large 4k desk monitor and the laptop when mobile, and presenting on big screens in meeting rooms.\n I just added it to MELPA, and converted it to a minor mode, so anyone already using it will have to tweak config to change (textsize-setup) to (textsize-mode).\n I'd be very happy to hear about issues or desired features (here or on Github). I don't encounter displays that don't report size, but presumably projectors are not reliable for this - is there good generic metadata I could use to detect and compensate for them? At worst I could add overrides by EDID (unique display identifier).\n Also, while the default parameters I came up with work for me, there are many display geometries I just haven't encountered that may be sub-optimal with the defaults(?).\n    submitted by    /u/wjcferguson  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hey r/emacs, long time Vim user here trying to make the switch to Emacs and get it to stick (this time). And one of the recommendations I've seen when it comes to successfully switching is to figure out your emacs workflow and patterns rather than trying to shove Vim into Emacs (evil-mode aside).\n One of the core parts of my Vim workflow was fuzzy finding a file (any file, anywhere) in a project. And I see that there's a way to get similar functionality with projectile or project.el. The problem I've found is on large projects it's too slow, and breaks my focus. But this got me thinking. I very rarely need to jump between many far flung regions of the project I'm working on. And actually, having to search through all files in the project (as quick as it may be) gets annoying in my Vim workflow where there are many files with the same or similar names. \n So instead, what I'm imagining would work well for me is to fuzzy search for all files in a sub directory of a project. I.e: in executing a custom project-find-file I would first get the option to find a subdir in the project, and then it would operate as regular project-find-file from that subdir.\n Being new to emacs/elisp are there any pointers for how to do this, I would imagine ideally with project.el? Or alternatively, how do you deal with navigating to files quickly (without breaking your focus/flow) in large projects with emacs?\n Thanks in advance! 🙏\n    submitted by    /u/joshleeb  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I had originally posted this on r/spacemacs, but someone mentioned that it might be better addressed here. Thanks in advance for any thoughts!\n ***\n I've been using Spacemacs for a month or so and am really enjoying the experience. I originally wanted to learn Emacs because of Org-Mode, but have since started doing most of my writing in a markdown buffer using writeroom-mode, where I previously just wrote with Vim in a terminal.\n I'm using a standard US keyboard on a 2013 Macbook Pro (still going strong), but I use ä ü ö ß all the time. The situation is basically exactly what is outlined in this older post. I have had the same key combinations baked into my fingers for years and I'd like to keep it that way. Right now, I have this in my user-config:\n (setq ns-alternate-modifier 'none\n ns-right-alternate-modifier 'meta)\n It works wonderfully, all good, I thought. But now at some point the umlauts go haywire: for example, ä eventually becomes \\303\\244 and I'm not sure what could be triggering the change or how to fix it. I get that it's UTF-8, but why it ends up like that in the first place is beyond me. Is there an obvious fix here or something that I'm missing? Thanks in advance for any input.\n UPDATE: \n The link that u/graduale posted ended up being super helpful, as it was indeed some sort of encoding issue having something to do with the existence of the \"null-bytes\" as discussed in that thread. Found them with C-s C-q C-SPC, got rid of them and using revert-buffer-with-coding-system cleaned everything up after I selected the encoding. And the change seems to be holding after restarting emacs completely as well. Thanks for the help!\n    submitted by    /u/sudeenhux  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi all, in an endeavor to truly understand the difference between a REPL and an interactive shell, I've came across this article On Repl-Driven Programming (hackernews comments). The author described two important features that Lisp REPLs have and other languages such as Python/Ruby lack. These two features are:\n  \nbreakloop. If you call an undefined function, the debugger will be in a breakloop (what the L in REPL truly stands for), and in there you can edit the code, without restarting the function call. In emacs if would of be like if we encounter a (void-variable foo) error and the debugger pops up. And then we recursively edit the source code and then the debugger will go back one step in the stack and the code runs like no error has happened.\n \nhot reloading. If you define a class, and instantiate a few instances, changing the class definition while the program is running will dynamic be reflected on the instances without restarting the REPL. In emacs, I feel like the main emacs runtime already has some of this using eval-defun or eval-sexp, but it's not as automatic as other languages mentioned. \n \n  \nMy questions are: \n Do we have breakloop and hot reloading in Emacs? Are there any other tricks that Emacs has for REPL-driven development? \n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/FVIIIvWF  \n [link]   [comments]",

(\"TK\" is writer speak for \"to come\"), since the only common English words that have 'tk' in them are \"pocketknife\" and \"hotkey\", and case sensitivity matters.)\n I added \"TK\" to hl-todo-keyword-faces, but I discovered that hl-todo uses a regexp like (^|\\s)(<keyword>), so the opening bracket confuses hl-todo and it doesn't show up in the todo lists.\n I wrote a quick perl script to place a space before the bracket, and it worked, and now the magit-status buffer says my documentation folder has 59 TODOs over 41 markdown files-- which is great!-- but it won't list them! Which is not great.\n So:\n  \nRemembering to include the space in [ TK: ...] is a pain in the neck, and looks terrible. Is there a way to modify the regexp such that the opening bracket is a legal character to hl-todo without hacking hl-todo's source in the elpa folder?\n \nHas anyone seen this where Magit-todo won't list the TODOs? What do I do? I'm not the world's greatest elisp hacker, and it's always good to task first before trying to figure out for myself.\n \n Thanks it advance.\n    submitted by    /u/elfsternberg  \n [link]   [comments]",

In order to differentiate them in Agenda, I have adopted a policy of appending their repetition amount in the headline itself, like this:\n *** TODO Clean/Organize Garage for 10 minutes .+1w SCHEDULED: <2022-03-19 Sat .+1w> Spend at least 10 minutes cleaning up the garage. (I'll probably do more, but 10 min minimum.) \n This makes it clear to me that this is a repeated task. So for example, if the above case is overdue by 3 days, I might just CANCEL the task to get it out of my hair, and let it roll forward to next Sat. But I wouldn't want to CANCEL a one-off task. I'll let it sit in my Agenda or reschedule it. \n Do you do something similar? Or is there a more emacsian way to do this?

          "description": "Hello friends! I have been trying to use emacsclient for my EDITOR environment variable. It works fine except one snag I've encountered. My EDITOR is set to emacsclient -t -a ''.\n The issue is this: when I run git commit it launches a new frame in my terminal, as you'd expect. The issue arises if I choose to cancel my commit using C-c C-k. Canceling the commit returns me to my terminal hanging on the git message \"Hint: waiting for your editor to close the file...\". It hangs until I take some other action on my system (taking an action such as spawning a new terminal, opening a new emacsclient, etc).\n If you have any ideas on what may be causing this, or I how I can provide more information, please let me know.\n    submitted by    /u/TheFreim  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm still learning the editor (and the language), but the part I'm having the most trouble adapting to is C-z C-x C-c C-v commands that are standard with Windows. Given that I've used those commands since I've used computers in general, I don't think it's going to be easy to switch over.\n I've seen that there is a mode that sort of removes that possibility, CUA mode, but it seems like it would interfere with most of the slime commands. C-c and C-x seem to be very busy keys.\n And so I have thought of a solution that I think would work, and it's crackpot enough that I think trying it will be fun. I'm not completely sure it will work, and so am requesting community input.\n OK, so here's the plan. I'm going to de-mothball my custom keyboard which allows me to remap keys. Then I would remap the Caps-Lock key to one of the F13-F24 keys, and then using that as the Control for emacs sequences. C-c would be (Caps lock)-c and C-x would be (Caps lock)-x. I think that's possible to change in my init file? Emacs has proven to be a remarkable beast in its extensibility and I'm like 90% sure that this is doable.\n Anyway, I am wondering if there is some obvious problem with this plan, other than the glaringly obvious one which is that it's less trouble to just learn the shortcuts.

          "description": "Hey folks,\n Hope you're doing great. I'm using Emacs for about 15 years (So basically a rookies in scale of Emacs :P). Based on my experience over the years and specially in the recent times, not many people know about the wonderful world of Emacs and why it is such a fascinating tool. To me they are missing out a chance to enjoy Emacs. So, a while ago I've decided to create a video series and talk about Emacs Lisp in context of a long running project to create an \"editor\" with Emacs Lisp, In hope to help more people to enjoy the tool that changed the way I use computers and brought me joy over all these years.\n Yesterday, I recorded the 4th episode of the video series. I thought to myself that It might be a good idea to share it on this subreddit as well. I have a looooooong term plan for this series and looking forward to your feedback.\n Like to the latest episode(4): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NE1XUfrrGYI\n Link to the playlist: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkfndJuDzsA&list=PLlONLmJCfHToFfk1WgTOwZMfIr062jIN9&index=1\n Cheers\n    submitted by    /u/lxsameer  \n [link]   [comments]",

Can anyone point me in a better direction if this ain't the way/tell me where I'm screwing up?\n first I define a face:\n (defface position-1-face '((t (:foreground \"#FF0000\" :weight bold))) \"The face for the first increment out of from the cursor\" :group 'increment-faces) \n Then I apply it like this\n (when (<= plus (point-max)) (hlt-highlight-region plus plus 'position-1-face)) (when (>= neg (point-min)) (hlt-highlight-region neg neg 'position-1-face)) \n Where plus and neg are values that are 10 characters from the current point in either direction. My eventual goal with this is to have characters like 10, 20 and 30 characters out from the cursor highlighted so I can jump around more easily without having to figure out distances. \n I know the faces are getting applied from the output of describe-char but they do not seem to actually show up.\n Ideally I'd like to drop the dependence on highlight.el so if there is a better built in way then please do let me know\n    submitted by    /u/flyg0dx__  \n [link]   [comments]",

This is because I may later use it in talks, white-papers, etc., where preserving the vector quality is crucial.\n So, after some time trying (and failing) to convince myself such functionality must already exist, I wrote up a small package.

I think it is fairly well known that if you use straight.el, deactivating package.el in your early-init.el will speed up your starting time. What I only just found out is that on launch, straight does a lot of checks to see if any of the packages installed have been altered. This process can be changed by modifying the straight-check-for-modifications variable. I don't edit any of my straight packages by hand, so I have this set to nil, before bootstrapping straight. This brought my startup time from ~2 seconds to ~0.5 seconds, for loading over 200 packages. Maybe there are some reasons why one shouldn't do this that I don't know, but it seems to be a nice way to save some time!\n For more information, see this section of straight's read-me: https://github.com/raxod502/straight.el#customizing-when-packages-are-built\n Hopefully this is of help to someone!\n    submitted by    /u/jamez5800  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I use .emacs-custom.el to contain the customizations made by the interactive functions. However, I'd like to start moving some of that stuff out so I can manage it myself and make comments. I tried pulling some stuff out and putting into my init.el, but it didn't work. Namely, I pulled out these:\n '(org-todo ((((class color) (min-colors 89)) (:weight normal :box (:line-width 1 :color \"#808080\") :foreground \"#FF00FF\" :background \"#f0f0f0\")))) '(org-upcoming-deadline ((t (:foreground \"#FF33FF\")))) '(org-warning ((t (:background \"#ffffa0\" :foreground \"#ff33ff\" :weight normal)))) \n Why don't these work within my init.el? I tried them before and after my (load custom-file).\n EDIT: Ok I see I'm supposed to use set-face-attribute. So I tried wrapping the above, but this doesn't work\n (set-face-attribute 'org-todo ((((class color) (min-colors 89)) (:weight normal :box (:line-width 1 :color \"#808080\") :foreground \"#FF00FF\" :background \"#f0f0f0\")))) \n EDIT 2: I figured out the answer. A correct, commonly used form for set-face-attribute is like this:\n (set-face-attribute 'org-todo nil :box '(:line-width 1 :color \"#808080\") :weight 'normal :foreground \"#FF00FF\" :background \"#f0f0f0\") \n And it probably didn't work with a straight copy because each of those first three lines, I think those are args to the function (custom-set-faces...). I don't know what it does behind the scenes, but I guess it wants its args in a certain format.\n    submitted by    /u/Status-Detective-783  \n [link]   [comments]",

I do 'desktop-read' and my saved desktop opens with the 10 or so frames I had saved.\n \nWhen I go to one of the frames with a buffer I'm no longer interested in, and do C-x C-c, I end up not just closing that particular frame, but all 10 or so of the frames that were open.\n \nThe Emacs daemon is still running, and opening another client frame shows that the buffers haven't been killed, so nothing has been lost per se - it's just that the arrangement of all the frames I had is just ruined.\n \n Any idea how to stop this behaviour (i.e. being able to just kill one frame from the saved configuration)? \n I should add that I have also been using the minimal setup for desktop.el as shown in the EmacsWiki, but I /think/ (but am not sure) that the problem is independent of this.\n    submitted by    /u/nonreligious  \n [link]   [comments]",

As a visual thinker and sketchnoter my first idea was to use this method to combine visual thinking with networked thinking. Taking smart notes is great, but taking smart sketchnotes would be even greater.\nTo summarize the content of a book like this within one sketchnote is not that easy. So I started to summarize one main aspect witch is important for a reader of Ahrens’ book to work with the Zettelkasten method. It’s the major workflow starting with filling the inbox till using the content of the growing slip-box to produce an output of higher value. I added the tools I’m using in this process and also the page numbers from the book as a reference for further reading and understanding the underlying method.\nYou are also working with Obsidian and Zettelkasten?

It would be great if ISO 8601 compliant Zettel IDs could be incorporated into a future release, preferably as a predefined native option.\nI figure, if one is going to use a date and time stamp as an ID (and I can see the benefits of doing so), then the ID may as well be strictly ISO 8601 compliant.\nI realise this is pedantic, not massively important, and can easily solved by other means (TextExpander, etc.).

If yes, how does it feel compared to English or other languages you speak?\nI am asking because I think about learning Sanskrit to improve my thinking.\nExample: To me, German is very sensitive compared to English. In German, tiny differences in wording make a huge difference in meaning and tone. English is much more simple.\nA (translated) quote that is very telling:\n\n  \nFrench is a noble park, Italian a big, bright and colourful wood. But German is more like a primeval forest, as thick and mysterious, as lacking big trails and yet full of hidden paths. You can’t get lost in a park, and not that easily and dangerously in the Italian wood’s brightness; but in German can disappear in the thicket within four, five minutes. Because the paths are so difficult to follow, most try to march as straight as possible through it. Actually, this is against it’s against the nature of this language. Sure, it has a principal direction, but yet invites by hundred trails and hidden paths left and right to depart from it, and soon back to it.\n\n\n\nI butchered the quote through translation because it makes heavy use of the peculiarities of the German language.\nThat is the reason why translations from German into English are very difficult.\nThat is the reason why I plan to provide my own translation of the core texts of Luhmann in some distant future.\nLive long and prosper\nSascha",

My comments follow.\nNote identifiers are avoided altogether in favor of descriptive filenames. This obviates the timestamp versus Folgezettel question. A tradeoff is that note filenames should be unique and should be considered immutable: a title cannot be changed without changing each reference to the note with that title. This seems like a minor inconvenience, in view of the use of backlinks to create indexes and hubs, below.\n\n\nBibliographic entries (literature notes) are separate notes that link to a note titled Bibliography.

I also prefer to use a UID internal to the body of the text instead of using a filename as I am very new to this and still changing my titles. To create an internal link, I copy the UID number of the filename (without the title) at the top of the body of my zettel. Then in my second zettel, I open a [[]] and inside I paste the UID number of the first zettel. The [[UID]] becomes green. When I hover on it it says that the file is not found. When I click on it, a search is launched and I have my two zettels that appear in the search bar but the target zettel does not open automatically. Is it normal? Should it only open in the search bar?\nI saw that a \"#\" was sometimes set before the UID (in the body) of the zettel of origin. Is this necessary besides to denote that it is the zettel of origin?\nThank you and sorry if it is a bit messy (or very obvious), I am totally new with markdown and all of these softwares!",
