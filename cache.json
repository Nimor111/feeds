See this thread for details: https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/21693 \n You can use its Strict :: LiftedType -> UnliftedType and Lazy :: LiftedType -> UnliftedType newtypes (!) to turn any lifted type into an unlifted (boxed) type like Array# and vice versa.\n Example:\n let f :: (a :: UnliftedType) -> Int f _ = 42 in f (Strict (error \"boom\" :: Int)) \n This will error out with \"boom\". While the following\n let f :: a -> Int f _ = 42 in f (Lazy (error \"boom\" :: Array# Int)) \n will not error and return 42 instead. (Do note though that unlifted primitives like Array# currently don't have enter code and any eval of Lazy will crash, https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/21792).\n I added a Coercible-like type, LevitySubsumption that allows to coerce some functions along the subkinding relationship Unlifted <: Lifted lifted over BoxedRep, TYPE and then (->). The only axioms are Strict a <: a and a <: Lazy a. With that in place, I can do call-by-value on any existing lazy function:\n even :: Int -> Bool strictEven :: Strict Int -> Bool strictEven = levCoerce @(Int -> Bool) @(Strict Int -> Bool) even even 42 strictEven (Strict 42) \n See also https://hackage.haskell.org/package/data-elevator-0.1.0.0/docs/Data-Elevator.html#v:levCoerce. It's pretty interesting; constructing a coercion like that is very much what I would like GHC to do by itself one day, without any visible trace of levCoerce if possible (inferrable).\n Do note that this code uncovered a few bugs in GHC, so give it a few GHC releases before you actually use this library in production.\n    submitted by    /u/sgraf812  \n [link]   [comments]",

The convenience of using (+) syntax is high enough that I am perfectly happy to have multiplication throw a runtime error when no Monoid instance is available. But it would also be nice to use mul when a Monoid instance is available.\n I guess the ideal situation would be if (+) and (*) were not methods in the same typeclass. Then I could have instance (Ord b, Num a, Eq a) => Add (FreeModule b a) ... and instance (Ord b, Monoid b, Num a, Eq a) => Mul (FreeModule b a) ..., but I don't want to go the route of defining my own numeric hierarchy.\n    submitted by    /u/davidwsd  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have (in the package monad-bayes), a type\n newtype Sampler a = Sampler (ReaderT GenIO IO a)\n which is used as a sampling monad. We wanted to generalize it to the following\n newtype Sampler g m a = Sampler (StatefulGen g m => ReaderT g m a)\n This version is parametrized by a choice of RNG and monad, which is great. Unfortunately, it's about 10x slower, at least when used as the sampling monad in a program that takes 1000000 random samples. \n Does the typeclass constraint inside the newtype set off performance alarm bells for anyone?

But... why? We don't do this for any other monad, and modern Haskellers are perfectly comfortable writing `AppE <$> x <*> y` rather than `appE x y`. And it's quite expensive - you have a huge module that duplicates every single function in this form, and it leads to downstream confusion as people use the two styles inconsistently.\n I think the reason for this existing may just be historical: this style was introduced in the TH paper in 2002, and applicatives weren't popularised until 2008.

All of them required many changes to the existing code, and in the end I couldn't get many things out of it. \n In the last week, I was touching Python for my job and its built-in mocking framework (unittest.mock). I was blown away. Nothing at all needs to change in the existing app code, yet I can mock and perform assertions on any function at all:\n # test that my function deletes the found file with mock.patch(\"glob.glob\") as glob: # mock a return value glob.return_value = [\"file.txt\"] with mock.patch(\"os.remove\") as remove: main_logic_to_delete_files() # perform asserts on no. times called and arguments remove.assert_called_once_with(path=\"file.txt\") \n It greatly lowered the barrier to perform unit tests for me, and I was amazed at how simply I could test the behaviour of my logic. \n Does anybody know of any library in Haskell that can do similar things, or any ideas on how I may go about making one if not?

Exactly how we use type aliases over existing types, except by the fact that they shouldn't be interchangeable.

Therefore, I would appreciate any suggestions!\n Here are the materials we have so far in the announcement :\n  \nWe suggest you start by watching this video: \n http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqi0Xu2Enaw \n Then have a look at these posts and discussions: \n https://serokell.io/blog/10-reasons-to-use-haskell \n http://stackoverflow.com/questions/775726/whats-the-fuss-about \n http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3175656/why-should-i-want-to-learn-haskell \n If you want to know more about the basic motivation behind Haskell and functional programming in general, listen to what the founding fathers of Haskell have to say: \n http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSmkqocn0oQ\n  \nVideo in the first link is great content-wise, but it feels and looks really old, so I don't think it leaves great impression on young students.\n Serokell blog post is great, I think, new and concise, I am happy with that one.\n Stack overflow discussions are motivating and inspiring, but both are almost 10 years old.\n Last video is nice, but also dated.\n Ideally, finding a replacement video for the first one, but newer, would be great, and possibly some newer discussions / blog posts!\n    submitted by    /u/Martinsos  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I spent some time this weekend writing up an alpha version of some ideas I had about command line option parsing as a haskell package: cyclops.\n To start, if you're looking for a robust and full-featured option parser, cyclops isn't that yet. Let me recommend optparse-applicative and optparse-generic, which are both great.\n The Big Idea of cyclops is to support a declarative option-parsing style (just say what arguments you expect, rather than how to parse it) while keeping the option description as close as possible to the variable bind location.\n To that end, it uses ViewPatterns and TypeApplications with DataKinds to pass option specifications backwards from the bind location using type inference.\n main = do ( switch @'[\"d\", \"debug\"] @\"Show debugging statements\" -> debug ,flagged @'[\"dictionary\"] @\"PATH\" @\"File to draw words from\" .defaultTo @\"--dictionary /usr/share/dict/words\" -> dictionaryPath ,option @'[\"s\", \"seed\"] @\"NUM\" @\"Seed value for PRNG\" .readable -> seed ,arg @\"count\" @\"Number of passwords to generate\" .readable -> count ,arg @\"template\" @\"Template for generated passwords\" .oneOrMore .defaultTo @\"w w w w\" -> template ) <- getOps Conf { description = \"Generate pseudorandom passwords using a template.\" , version = \"1.0.0.20220702\" } \n Type inference places some constraints not visible in the above example code - if seed is inferred to be an Int by how it's used in the rest of the code, then that's how it getOps will attempt to parse --option 123.\n This release isn't really ready for primetime yet, but if you like the basic concept, let me know, and I'll keep working it.\n    submitted by    /u/rampion  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hey everyone, after intensive testing i just released my first library on hackage!\n Interval Tree Clocks - They serve as an alternative to vector clocks, which are a concept to track logical time. In distributed contexts, comparison by timestamps might be skewed. \n Vector clocks and version vectors however have the weakness of \"actor explosion\" because you cannot remove traces of an actor that might be long gone. They only allow you to increment the version vector in length.\n Interval tree clocks solve this by managing a tree-representation of said vector clock. With interval tree clocks you can dynamically add (fork) or remove (join) actors / replicas from your system and have your versions grow and shrink accordingly, while still holding the monotonically increasing semantics.\n They can similarly be used as either version vectors or vector clocks.\n I have thoroughly tested the code. Nonetheless if you are an expert on the topic, I'd love to get your criticism. Nevertheless, because it's my first library, I appreciate all and any feedback I can get.\n Hope this helps you build distributed systems some day!\n ​\n Hackage link: https://hackage.haskell.org/package/interval-tree-clock-0.1.0.0\n ​\n This library provides the bare operations as described in the original paper: Almeida, Paulo & Baquero, Carlos & Fonte, Victor.

What kind of projects are made in Scala and why they couldn't be made in e.g Javascript? Or rather it isn't about language but tech field? From what I understand Scala is mostly used in processing big data, so knowing only Scala syntax won't help you with landing a job, right? So that leads me to another question: what should I learn in order to land a job in Scala ecosystem, besides language syntax, libraries etc ? I work in webdevelopment field and I'm trying to grasp what this language is about, so sorry if I ask dumb questions\n    submitted by    /u/HamsterFearless5756  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Has anyone built this? How tough would it be? Does anyone have ideas on where to start?\n To expand, I've noticed a recurring problem in big projects: someone makes a small, trivial change and then has to wait 30-45 minutes for all tests to run. This wastes time and compute. Over time, developers adjust the size of PRs to account for this. Instead of making small isolated changes, they batch a bunch of changes into a single PR so the tests all run together. At some point they break the repo up. Now they have to think about dependency chains, and they've copied a bunch of build boilerplate into many repos.\n I think a powerful solution would be to only re-run tests for code that changed. We can periodically re-run all tests on main/master, maybe once daily. We can add some configuration/annotation to specify that a particular test or test suite should always run.\n How would it work? At the very least, it would have to integrate with SCM to compare what's on main/master vs. on the current commit. But it seems naive to just compare which source files show up in the diff. Seems like it might have to do something at the bytecode level? Maybe some sort of instrumentation similar to what code coverage tools are doing. I haven't done much at that level.\n In any case, thanks for reading. I'm pretty keen to try to build something along these lines. Excited to read any ideas/links/tips you all might have.\n ​\n Update:\n  \nThanks for the fun discussion! It sounds like some combination of testQuick and SBT's remote cache are worth a try.

          "description": "I have a Scala 3 CRUD app with many case classes repeating each other.\n For example:\n  case class Person(name: String, surname: String, age: Int) case class PersonWithId(id: UUID, name: String, surname: String, age: Int) case class PersonWithEmail(name: String, surname: String, age: Int, email: Email) \n All these case classes have circe/skunk codecs and other type class instances derived for it.\n Sometimes I use nesting, like WithId(id: UUID, item: Person), which makes it slightly better, but still\n  \nThere's a lot of boilerplate\n I afraid that problems like type mismatch will start to appear after I get into my first refactoring\n  \nIs there a way to scratch this boilerplate a bit? I'd like to write something like:\n ``` case class Person(name: String, surname: String, age: Int) type PersonWithId = (\"id\", UUID) :: Person type PersonWithEmail = Person :: (\"email\", Email)\n given Encoder[PersonWithId] = deriveEncoder[PersonWithId]\n val withId = PersonWithId(UUID.random(), \"Bob\", \"Smith\", 27) ```\n I know Scala 3 has added many new tools around product types and wondering if there's anything that can help me out.\n PS. I just find it sad that TypeScript, a language that I'd think has weaker type system allows to do this out of the box:\n  type Person = { name: string, surname: string, age: number } type PersonWithId = Pick<Person, \"name\" | \"surname\"> const withId: PersonWithId = { name: \"Bob\", surname: \"Smith\" } \n    submitted by    /u/MysteriousGenius  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello everyone. I have a question about proper usage of Ref:\n Where other languages mutate objects, FP-languages prefer creating alternative instances to preserve referential transparency. Let's say I have a nested structure, i.e. House has Floors, Floor has Apartment, Apartment has Room, Room has LightBulb. If I change a light bulb, I obviously don't want to recreate the whole House.\n The way documentation describes Ref, its' primary goal is to help with concurrency:\n  \nAn asynchronous, concurrent mutable reference. Provides safe concurrent access and modification of its content\n  \nBut from my experience, it's really handy to use it just as a reference, even if there are no troubles with concurrency. In the example with House I can store references to Apartments to avoid recreating Floors and the whole House each time i have a change in an Apartment. I can just call apartmentRef.update(...) and the Floor and the House stay exactly the same.\n The question is: is it OK to do so? If so, is it bad to use it every time, let's say at each level mentioned in the House example?\n    submitted by    /u/anonimuzzza  \n [link]   [comments]",

Each function returns a sequence of case classes representing the data source that has been fetched from the database. \n The “half baked idea” is: What if “whenever something interesting happens” I could deserialize this DataAccess class and replay the test data through the latest version of the app for debugging and testing purposes. \n Does anyone have any kind of experience with such a pattern? What tools did you consider to help with the “snapshotting” (serialization and deserialization)? Where did you persist your snapshots?\n Some considerations: 1. There are about a hundred different case classes available through various functions in the DataAccess class 2. The “amount” of data is large. So while I view storage cost as essentially free, serialization / deserialization performance (primarily deserialization) is a concern\n A few options I could think of are: 1. A database, either a “real database” or perhaps some kind of in-memory database 2. Serializing to disk storage on some server in ProtoBuf, Mempack, Csv, json etc. 3. ???\n    submitted by    /u/Employee-Weak  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello everyone.\n I am currently trying to do the following: only get headings that are the next actions to be taken. A concrete example: \n * TODO Project ** TODO Task one, the next action that I want to see ** TODO Task two, but after the task one, not the next action \n ​\n As you can see here, the next action is the task one.\n A slightly more complicated example: \n * Project ** TODO Not next action *** TODO Next action *** TODO Not next action ** TODO Not next action * Another Project ** DONE Task one ** TODO Another next action \n ​\n I managed to make a function with \"org-agenda-skip-function\" which allows me to find its famous next action. But how to do it with org-ql ? Is there a possibility to \"translate\" this function into an org-ql query ?I'm also thinking of creating a new predicate, \"brother-up\", which would return true if the heading has a heading of the same level before it\n So maybe I could find the next action by taking the following headings:\n  \nno task in done\n no descendant\n no \"brother up\" not done\n  \nI'm a bit lost, because I don't even know if it would work, and if I have thought about everything. I don't know exactly in which direction to go, because there is maybe an another better solution that I didn't think of.\n Thanks in advance for your answers :)\n    submitted by    /u/Cletip  \n [link]   [comments]",

The Org+git workflow is understandably a big ask and I've experienced the pain a few times already. I'd like to use Org in Emacs on my own machines but have other team members access the data through a lower entry-barier interface such as the web.\n Tools like LogSeq seems to want to head there but still have a large focus on having to obtain their client first. Many teams are familiar with the \"login through SSO and make changes\" kind of workflow, so I'm keen to learn what's in this space and how you all solve this problem -- in case this is even a problem for y'all. Is this even a reasonable ask or shall I just stuck it up and suffer through Notion and Confluence/Jira?\n PS: I'm often fill of rage when I use those tools but as I find them inhibiting (breaking my flow) but maybe I just need a (better) therapist. 🤷🏿‍♂️\n    submitted by    /u/vidbina  \n [link]   [comments]",

This works very well.\n The only issue I have is that the agenda is rebuild after each (bulk) refile, which takes a while (10~15 seconds every time). It does take long but not forever, but it is already annoying although I am rather new to org and my files are not that large.\n Is there an option/command/prefix/hack I am missing that allows me to prevent the rebuild of the agenda every time?\n As plan B, is there another/better way to refile several entries at the same time that does not involve agendas?\n ---\n I noticed that the agenda is not re-build when I archive a heading (using a in the agenda view). I guess this is because the command predictably removes the heading from the agenda.

          "description": "I've been using org-wild-notifier (within Spacemacs) for a while and I realized it was actually draining my laptop batter quite a bit. The core reason is that once a minute it spawns a separate emacs instance that has to initialize a bunch of things and actually (re)open all org agenda files I already had opened and regenerate org-agenda.\n Which led me to dig around and look at https://github.com/jwiegley/emacs-async (which wild-notifier uses) and then read a bit about https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/NoThreading.\n I also went through https://orgmode.org/worg/agenda-optimization.html a bit (I only have a few agenda files and they are not huge, though I am toying with the idea of testing cleanup to see how much it would help)\n Ultimately though, it feel like the emacs-async use in this case will always cause slowdowns. Doing some profiling - even the call to package-initialize in org-wild-notifier--retrieve-events takes a sizeable chunk of CPU.\n These seem like wasted cycles, my emacs instance already has the org files open and all the packages needed loaded.\n So, finally my question is - am I the only one that is bothered by this? Do people not want/need notifications generally? Or not get hit by the battery drain for some reason? How do others deal with getting notifications before events/tasks are scheduled/planned?\n I looked a bit at https://github.com/legalnonsense/org-timed-alerts and I like the approach using org-ql potentially nice(r). Especially with caching and all of that... But the package doesn't seem maintained anymore so I think it's a dead end?\n Alternatively would changing wild-notifier to use emacs threads potentially solve/improve this? (at the cost of newer emacs version requirement).\n Any other suggestions (other than trying to cleanup my org agenda files)?\n Edit: Fix double spaced-paragraphs\n    submitted by    /u/podtatranec  \n [link]   [comments]",

For example, if i have three files named introduction.md, development.md and ending.md, I would like to have this in the merged org file: \n  \nintroduction.md\n \n (contents of the file) \n  \ndevelopement.md\n \n (contents of the file) \n  \nending.md\n \n (contents of the file) \n And being able to fold them as in any org file.\n Is this possible?\n    submitted by    /u/federvar  \n [link]   [comments]",

Much more on supermemo wiki: https://www.supermemo.wiki/en/learning/incremental-reading\n To facilitate incremental reading in Emacs I'm trying org-noter which is amazing but sadly hasn't been maintained in recent years.\n There's also annotate.el which Im going to try.\n  \nIs anyone using emacs/orgmode for incremental reading?\n Are there any other annotation packages that I'm missing?\n  \n   submitted by    /u/trae  \n [link]   [comments]",

I use projectile often (I prefer the extra functionality it has over project.el). But how do I integrate Projectile with all this. For Ivy there is counsel-projectile which overrides most projectile functionality and work awesome. For consult there is consult-projectile but it seems a bit lacking compared to counsel-projectile.\n ​\n Is there a better alternative? or am I missing something with this completion framework and I should combine more consult and embark functionality with projectile somehow?\n Do you use projectile with a similar completion stack? If so do you have any advice of config files to share?\n ​\n [EDIT] My bad after taking a deeper look to respond to u/bespokey I realized that they are pretty similar not sure why I thought they were more.

In section 4.1 \"Finding More Information\", it says the following:\n For example, ‘xref-find-definitions’ will jump to the various nodes in the Texinfo source file of this document (provided that you’ve run the ‘etags’ utility to record all the nodes in the manuals that come with Emacs; see (emacs)Create Tags Table). \n When I try the command M-. it puts this in the minibuffer:\n Visit tags table (default TAGS): /usr/local/Cellar/emacs/28.1/share/info/emacs/ \n Which I interpret to mean I do not have a TAGS file already generated for the Info pages.\n If I navigate to:\n /usr/local/Cellar/emacs/28.1/share/info/emacs \n And then do:\n etags eintr.info.gz \n It does create a TAGS file, but it doesn't look right. Every line starts with \"function\", which makes me think etags interpreted this as the wrong language. I'm assuming the language expected is texinfo (based on the Info pages own text), so I tried manually specifying the language:\n etags -l texinfo eintr.info.gz \n But it creates an almost-empty TAGS file.\n Now I'm kind of stumped.

After reading about them and experimenting with them deeper I have noticed how powerful they are. Aside from lack of documentation most of them are not used widely because they lack a good collection of snippets for various modes.

I used Emacs like this for nearly two years until recently I discovered that package-archive-priorities exists, so I would like to make it part of my init.el now.\n I rewrote my package config:\n (require 'package) (add-to-list 'package-archives '(\"melpa\" . \"https://melpa.org/packages/\")) (add-to-list 'package-archives '(\"nongnu\" . \"https://elpa.nongnu.org/nongnu/\")) (setq package-archive-priorities '((\"melpa\" . 3) (\"gnu\" . 2) (\"nongnu\" . 1))) (package-initialize) \n The reason I add \"Non GNU\" is for Emacs 27. Yes, I know that Emacs 28+ doesn't require that.\n I set the highest priority for MELPA. I'm using the numbers 3, 2, and 1 for priorities. Is there anything wrong with that kind of numbering? Just asking because most init.el configs I saw online used larger integers like 100, 50, and 25. Should I use the larger numbers instead? or it doesn't matter?\n Also, is there anything wrong in using the MELPA as the archive with the highest priority? I noticed that If I choose GNU ELPA as the main archive, the version of the company package that gets installed is an older version. It seems to me that the packages in MELPA are more up-to-date. The \"Non GNU\" archive doesn't seem to be a replacement for MELPA, at least not for now.\n    submitted by    /u/zoliky  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello everyone!\n Is it possible to have a web-based interactive overlay inside a text buffer in Emacs? \n Something similar in UX to how images or org-transclusion overlays are displayed inside org-mode buffers. I am looking specifically for in-place rendering, not in a separate buffer. My use case is rendering html export blocks inside an org file to have an interactive notebook like experience, without exporting the whole document to html and viewing it in a browser. \n This would allow one to use Emacs as a self-sufficient interactive environment, bringing interactive plots, boards, diagrams, graphs, tables etc. directly into already powerful text editing environment. This functionality exists a priori in web-based applications like Obsidian, VS Code (even with inline web-views), but those either become slower with each notebook cell, have json as a file format, or do not have serious text editing capabilities. I realize that such overlays are niceties, and one can always export and view the documents, but I believe that the described approach is alluring to many because it does not force one to split their thinking between creating and viewing.\n If there is no such package at the moment, I would be willing to implement it myself; however, I want to ask people who looked into Emacs rendering and text overlay capabilities if something of that sort is even possible. Or is it easier to rewrite Emacs GUI with something like Tauri? :)\n I am also happy to hear about other approaches or views on this problem which worked for you!\n    submitted by    /u/alexander_demy  \n [link]   [comments]",

This work well, but it crucially means that it is difficult to compile the configuration files (using the byte compiler or the automatic native compiler). This is because some of these config files have some dependencies on each other. In particular, all my config files assume that the load-path is set correctly and use-package and straight are installed and configured so that packages can be installed or used. When compiling files, especially using the asynchronous native compiler, these files are compiled in batch mode in a vanilla Emacs without any configurations. Hence any statements using unloaded packages would fail.\n What is the correct way to do this?

It might have something to do with the size of the repository, I haven't checked. For example, when I invoke projectile-find-file in the nixpkgs repository (which is huge), nothing is shown, and I cannot even enter a filename to open it. In my own, smaller repositories, it's working fine. I'm using ido-mode, ido-everywhere and ido-ubiquitous-mode as well as ido-vertical-mode. Anyone else have this problem? It doesn't occur with projectile, just project.el. But I'd like to stick to emacs built-in stuff.\n    submitted by    /u/pimiddy  \n [link]   [comments]",

I mostly develop in Elixir, so configured lsp with elixir-mode and found that xref-find-definitions triggered from the embark menu was working great and a real time saver.\n A couple of weeks ago, xref-find-definitions stopped working.

Now I always get No definitions found in the minibuffer whenever I call xref-find-definitions (either via C-. RET or M-.) even for items I know worked a few weeks ago.

Besides, there are some other problems that I am facing: - How do you setup and use python environments on emacs? I tried poetry, but it doesn't have anyway to inherit global site packages. There are many packages that I installed globally as I will always use them, so I don't want to keep reinstalling them in every environment. - I see nowhere a place to run and debug my python scripts and see the results. Also, after everything is setup will it be able to show graphs and images? - Treemacs always open in the .doom.d directory how can I make it open in my home directory?\n Thanks in advance.\n    submitted by    /u/arivar  \n [link]   [comments]",

What are are pros and cons against a regular Emacs? Were there any dealbreakers?\n Also, how is it running Aquamacs and regular Emacs (with Spacemacs) on the same computer/user account? Will they play along nicely and don't mess things up, or they will be rewriting each others' configs all the time?\n UPDATE:\n I am using Evil mode, and also a leader SPC key so I basically don't use traditional Command bound Emacs keybindings.\n This seems to be a frequent \"con\" by people coming from vanilla Emacs when I try to find some cons of Aquamacs via Google - but in my case, that is not an issue.\n I am more worried about the compatibility of packages and code of Emacs Lisp scripts I will find on the Internet and whether it will run or not.\n Also, are there any weird hidden you-might-notice-them-only-after-a-few-months quirks that Aquamacs has when compared with vanilla Emacs?\n    submitted by    /u/East_Staff3288  \n [link]   [comments]",

EDIT: After some investigation it turns out the following code inside my init.el file was the issue: (defvar startup/file-name-handler-alist file-name-handler-alist) (setq file-name-handler-alist nil) (defun startup/revert-file-name-handler-alist () (setq file-name-handler-alist startup/file-name-handler-alist)) (add-hook 'emacs-startup-hook 'startup/revert-file-name-handler-alist) Anybody know why this‏‏‎‏‏‎‏‏‎‏‏‎­would cause the error on emacs28?\n    submitted by    /u/baby_vip  \n [link]   [comments]",

Still working on a better workflow than what I have currently \n I was wondering if someone has tried to integrate Emacs with their stream deck ? \n Here is what I imagine it would be useful for : \n - starting and stopping project timer with org-clock\n - global macros for pulling up a new notes or todo entry, or just general emacs macros\n - macro pad for more exotic commands that one might want to run every so often, or for switching buffers (with preview of the buffer name on the stream deck ?)\n ​\n All of these to me seem like feasible and useful. As I am relatively new to programming and elisp, I have a vague idea of how to implement this myself, but if someone has already gone through the trouble I would be happy to hear how they went about it !\n I use Doom emacs - macros and key bindings are pretty clear and easy to implement but more ways of interacting with emacs would be a plus for me ! \n I imagine for the global commands something like the emacs api would need to be used, I've got to look into it more.\n    submitted by    /u/FailedHumanPrototype  \n [link]   [comments]",

I've been far from memorizing the tags and attributes in HTML - with programming languages, I don't memorize the parameter list :/. So, I usually have an idea of what I want to do in HTML, but need to resort to googling/duckduckgo-ing quite frequently.\n However, I felt, it would be pretty great if there were some mode / emacs-extension / some-eww-friendly-website that could provide the tags, and the attributes that each tag takes, may be along with small examples as well as \"see also\". I've tried company-web and lsp-mode, and both provide descriptions of tags (which I mostly don't need!) but don't provide the attributes. With other languages, it is a great help to see the parameter list in the echo area, or even the function/macro/keyword documentation with a simple command.\n So, if anyone knows about this, it'd be great!\n Thanks you!\n EDIT: Moments after I posted this, yasnippet struck me; and it is helpful, but the tag-attribute reference manual would still be appreciated!\n    submitted by    /u/digikar  \n [link]   [comments]",

There were some errors in loading the Emacs config file, however the splash/startup screen hid those errors, so I never knew there were any problems. When the config file couldn't finish loading, it didn't get to my (setq inhibit-startup-screen t) instruction, hence it used the default startup.el setting.

Took me a while to narrow down exactly what was happening.\n I'm on emacs 27 and this is happening using the rustic package with flycheck and eglot.\n If I disable eldoc before it ever holds docs, I'm not prompted to save.\n But If I look at something in eldoc, and even after I quit eldoc-mode, emacs wants to save only the examples section of eldoc.\n This is a bizarre error and I'm wondering if there's just a setting I have turned on? My next step is to dig into the eldoc code.\n EDIT:\n I've been annoyed by this for months, and I finally tracked it down to the \" markdown-fontification-buffer:rust\" buffer that gets created by eglot or lsp-mode.

I feel like I'm still not 100% getting it.\n In elisp there are two distinct namespaces: one for functions and one for variables. This means I can have a variable called foobar and also a function called foobar, and they won't interfere with one another.\n If I want to evaluate a variable, then I just write the variable - eg foobar. If I want to evaluate a function, then I include it within parentheses (with arguments as needed) - eg (foobar arg1 arg2).\n If I want to refer to the symbol of a variable, then I prepend it with a quote - eg 'foobar. If I want to refer to the symbol of function, then I prepend it with a hash and quote - eg #'foobar.\n Lambdas are something of a mish-mash: they allow me to set the value of a variable to be a function, that will itself be called each time that variable is evaluated.\n Is that about it? Would love any feedback around where my understanding may have gone awry.\n    submitted by    /u/Shimmy-choo  \n [link]   [comments]",

It meant that I didn't have to think about which file I want to skip forward or back to - I would just look at the buffer line and then prev or next or wildcard to the buffer I want to skip to.\n In Emacs you do end up with a lot more open buffers so something similar wouldn't quite work but I wonder whether there are other solutions that might solve my issue. \n I would be perfectly happy to mark the buffers that I am currently working on for example and have them displayed somewhere for ease. Or have them pop up at the top of my buffer or ibuffer list so they are easy to see and select.\n Any suggestions?\n    submitted by    /u/Two_Souls  \n [link]   [comments]",

If I need a new window, I open another emacs client and manage it with my TWM. If I need a new workspace, I use the TWM workspaces. I use buffers as a way to have related tasks stacked on top of each other within one area, but this utility seems fairly limited.\n I doubt emacs would have these features if they aren't useful somehow, so what do they contribute to a workflow? In other words, how would incorporating them make me more productive and efficient compared to my current workflow?\n Thanks in advance for your help!\n    submitted by    /u/FearlessPolicy3206  \n [link]   [comments]",

I thought it was from sleeping on my elbow - not an uncommon cause of ulnar nerve entrapment, and my doctor had me change sleeping positions. \n I'm developing apps full time in dart and spend about 8-12 hours a day programming, 6-7 days a week. And I save, copy, paste, undo, redo, among other shortcuts all day, probably having my pinky hit the left ctrl key 1000 times a day. My typing speed was normally over 160, max 183, on 10fastfingers. \n Look, I've rebinded left control entirely to left alt. But for some reason, it really hit me today. Suddenly, I was in so much pain that I couldn't bear to hit left ctrl. \n I'm asking here because I'm hoping someone else has gone through recovery. I can't see a specialist for a couple of months. I'll discontinue using my small finger for shortcuts entirely, but that doesn't help me. I have a job to do now.\n    submitted by    /u/AMPHETAMINE-25  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I'm using line-prefix to give a little bit of space between the line numbers enabled by display-line-numbers-mode and my code, but it causes the unfortunate issue of the first tab being \"shortened\" by a space.\n This is because, when you enter a tab in emacs, the tab inserts space to the \"tab stop\" (not the tab stop set by tab-stop-list, but some kind of internal rendering value), and the space added by line-prefix doesn't move the internal tab stops, just adds a space at the beginning of the line, so it's the same as if you entered a space then a tab -- your indentation level is still only tab-width deep.\n I'm happy to just use spaces for indentation for my personal projects, but when collaborating with others I'll have to use tabs in some cases, so I'd like to find a solution to this problem. I've tried setting line-prefix to a tab, but even with tab-width 2, that's a bit too much.\n Alternatively, I'm happy with any other way to add a space between the display-line-numbers section and my code.\n    submitted by    /u/your_sweetpea  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi,\n I am trying to figure out a good workflow for Emacs + ESS for R. For interactive data analysis it's nice to make a lot of plots and RStudio has a nice panel for these. But ESS, at least by default, uses X, which is not nice:\n - plotting happens in the XQuartz application, which means that I need to switch out of Emacs and requires a whole bunch of keypresses and thought that I don't want to deal with; at most a window (or multiple as appropriate) should open which I close it with cmd-w and return to emacs, without having to switch applications.\n - plots aren't interactive. In python, for example, you can adjust the plot and save it from the figure window (although the plot window also switches apps and for that reason is not ideal).\n Is this the standard R plotting workflow on macOS (or for that matter Linux)? How do people handle making a lot of plots, on the fly, using ESS? Any other related workflow tips are also helpful. Thanks.\n    submitted by    /u/progthw  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Greetings and thank you all for being part of a knowledge-sharing community. I'm not sure exactly what I was doing a few weeks ago when  stumbled across a ZK article online. But I've been on a mission ever since to learn more and get my own implementation going. I have decided to use Obsidian, which is of course presents its own learning curve as well as the terrifying array of choices and customization options that come with it.\nI am in my fifties and have been writing down notes on paper here, there, and and everywhere, for decades. But I never knew exactly what to do with all this material except for some occasional reviews, and when I found something of significant interest it might end up in a Word document, often along with other ideas that might have been somewhat related, and that would go into a subfolder somewhere, and soon it would be almost as hard to find as the original fleeting note was. I also have marginalia in almost every book I own, and I try to read a couple books a week, so there is a lot of that too.\nNow that I see that the ZK method can rectify my poor organizational system, I am looking at my stacks of notebooks (and all those Word documents) and thinking.... wow, I should go through every last scrap and filter out the precious metals from the useless rocks, and get it all into my ZK. That will be a lot of time. Time that could be spent instead reading more books, which might provide a greater return on investment in terms of useful ideas and more polished knowledge that I can leverage.\nI suppose the nominal approach is to set aside a certain amount of time every day to sift through the mound, knowing that eventually I can get it all accounted for.  It is at the heart of it an optimization question. But I am interested in reading about how others have dealt with the burden of getting a ton of unorganized and often useless notes into a new ZK.\nThanks for reading!",

          "description": "Years ago my personal note taking was no longer based on trial and error but on a solid concept called Bullet Journaling. It started on paper with a lovely Moleskin book and a black fine liner from Neuland. Going digital with my Bullet Journal I decided to use a brilliant tool for note taking named OneNote. But time went by. In March 2022 I got my first contact with Obsidian and at the same time with the Zettelkasten method from Niklas Luhmann explained in the brilliant book from Sönke Ahrens about “How to take Smart Notes”.\nMigration from OneNote to Obsidian was a migration from structured notes to networked notes. But how to migrate a Bullet Journal to a Zettelkasten? Difficult to switch from one concept to another? No, it’s very easy. The Bullet Journal is now a set of Structure Notes in my Zettelkasten. Also Zettelkasten is a Custom Collection in my Bullet Journal.\nIn other words:\nmy Zettelkasten is a Bullet Journal and\nmy Bullet Journal is a Zettelkasten.\nThe best of all: I did not need to change the basic concepts from Ryder Carroll (Bullet Journal), neither the concepts from Niklas Luhmann (Zettelkasten). Both concepts support each other in a perfect manner.\nWhat about your experiences with theses methods? Do you use the Dataview plugin to support your Bullet Journal collections?\n—\n\n\nAhrens, Sönke.

          "description": "Hello.\nMy name is Mike Kramer. Two years ago, I made a very low-effort comment on this forum, but I never introduced myself.\nI first heard of the Zettelkasten Method by reading Ahrens's book. Through it, I discovered Christian and Sascha. From studying them, I realized that, just as the hardest part of GTD is processing--deciding which outcomes are worth committing to and which actions will cause those desired outcomes--the hardest part of a high-value Zettelkasten Method is specifying the nature of the connection that links one Zettel to another. GTD deals only with causal connections between items. The Zettelkasten Method can handle both causal and logical connections.\nAt the most fundamental level, my approach is based on the zettelkasten.de critique that says that a Folgezettel is a variant of the Collector's Fallacy. When I observe the work of other people, they usually cannot specify how a new note relates to its predecessor in the Folgezettel. They have the feeling that they have accomplished something meaningful, but, if they cannot write down the nature of the relation that obtains between connected notes, their thinking is inadequate.\nTo improve my own thinking, I track the status of the connections between my notes. Lumping a bunch of notes together is a low-effort, low-value kind of link compared to a link that shows how some notes provide reasons that support (or undermine) another note.\nIn March of this year, I produced a YouTube video of how I implement my method in Roam. Of course, this method could be implemented with other tools.\nhttps://youtu.be/iOsOI09-3A8\nI welcome your feedback. I hope to be spending a bit of time in wilderness areas, so it might take me a week or so to respond.",

This is my main concern that I want to address in this post.\nRequirement to produce plain text from small snippets of thoughts and bullet points. I know that this is probably the actual issue, where everyone has their own personal limits...\nI personally am using vimwiki. I often have already structured text inside my wiki, so I am not following a dedicated ZK method, where I would provide very small pieces of information, as I have read it in your introduction. \nI am currently working in an environment where the documents for external partners need to be written and shared in MS Office and the internal documents with LibreOffice. I personally often share textfiles internally, but there are some that don't like this, and latest when we have a kind of official internal meeting, I \"quickly\" convert my initial text into Office document.\nHow do you effectively export things from your knowledge base into documents that you want to publish eventually having the following points in mind:\nEfficient working: Information that is gained during writing the document to be published might also be needed to be transferred into you your knowledge base - duplicated information\nMarkdown syntax is not powerful enough to e.g. handle tables, so there is cumbersom reformating when moving data. Vimwiki syntax is not supported externally. AsciiDoc is a kind of strange to me. Multimarkdown was not fully supported by all my tools.\nLaying out a document in MS Word or LibreOffice is for me a very time consuming process, when I copy plain text into it.\nI tried several conversion methods like for example\n\n\nexported html from vimwiki into word\nseveral tries with pandoc (e.g. to LibreOffice)\n\n\n\nThank you",

          "description": "Hi everyone! I'm Joe, a recently graduated master's student working on international security and defense issues. I ran into the zettelkasten system while deep diving for ways to deepen my research, organize my usually jumbled thoughts, and connect my ideas. The zettel process is helpful because most of my work turns into written productsI often readng academic journals and think pieces on military concepts and other international policies.\nI just restarted my zettel journey after reading Ahrens' \"Smart Notes\" and powering through a few Youtube videos. My current focus is figuring out a \"good\" way to process literature notes. My initial way of creating literature notes would be a two-step process: taking general notes while reading and then finalizing a summary for the \"final literature note\" to connect with my fleeting notes to create permanent notes.\nI'm still a zettel newbie, so how do you process your literature notes? Any recommended readings about the topic? I look forward to engaging with everyone and learning more about the zettelkasten system!",

          "description": "Probably already discussed several times, anyway: Quci question about how to integrate an analog manual diary into the workflow. Sometimes I am in a mood that I am just not convenient to sit at my PC to write notes. So sitting into the couch, having a tea and just write some thoughts is the only way, I can motivate my self to writing.\nI want to have my notes searchable. So the only thing I see, is to retype things at a later point of time.\nBenefits: repetition and filtering\nAny ideas/suggestions about this?\nRegards, sbts",
