For example perhaps you’re writing a logger and want to call a function log. That’s a problem because the Prelude also defines a function called log. You can’t use either one without disambiguating. Usually you will disambiguate by qualifying the identifier like MyLogger.log. This is fine but it is a little annoying because it duplicates the name of the module. If you later refactor this module by changing its name, you’ll also have to update a…",

          "description": "I've started a Cabal project which consists of an executable and a single test-suite. In the test-suite I call the executable in a subprocess using System.Process.callProcess. \n I've found that cabal test does not automatically rebuild the executable after its Main.hs has been modified. Hence tests were failing simply because the executable was out-of-date.\n It took me a while to figure out how to fix this so I'm recording the fix here. The Cabal file should look something like this:\n name: foo executable: bar main-is: Main.hs hs-source-dirs: app test-suite: tests type: exitcode-stdio-1.0 main-is: test.hs hs-source-dirs: tests build-tool-depends: foo:bar \n The build-tool-depends line ensures that the executable bar in project foo gets built every time the test-suite is run.\n The comments on this Github issue suggest that this is the official way of ensuring that an executable is built before a test-suite is run. And this open issue is requesting the addition of a run-tool-depends field which would create a distinction between executables used when building a component and those used to running a component.\n Is there a better way of directly testing an executable with Cabal?\n    submitted by    /u/ljbw_online  \n [link]   [comments]",

It's a simple API built with Haskell and Scotty, containerized with Docker for easy deployment.\n 🔗 Repo: https://github.com/mihassan/cloud-run-hs-demo\n Why This Project? I've been coding in Haskell for some time now mostly for toy projects. I really love coding in Haskell, but one thing I was missing is to easily share my work in a straightforward, cost-effective way to friends/colleagues. This setup, combining Haskell with Docker and Cloud Run, might not be ideal for a production-grade service but is great for demos and learning experiences - all for free.\n Project Overview:\n The project, cloud-run-hs-demo, is a basic Haskell application that uses the Scotty web framework to set up a simple API. This demo showcases how you can containerize a Haskell application using Docker and deploy it to Google Cloud Run, a managed platform that automatically scales your stateless containers.\n I am aware that the setup lacks many essential features like rate limiting, authentication mechanisms, and DDoS protection. Also, there are many options for web frameworks, such as servant, yesod etc. and many database libraries. These are critical for production-grade services to ensure security and manageability. This project serves as a demonstration on how easy it is to get started.\n Features:\n  \nSimple Haskell API using Scotty.\n SQLite readonly database using sqlite-simple project.\n Docker integration for Cloud Run deployment.\n Static webpage as frontend for the API.\n  \nI'd love to hear your thoughts, feedback, or any experiences with similar technologies.

I've been contributing to the fits-parse package, which uses Data.Fits as a namespace, but my needs are growing beyond the scope of that package. I need to add support for the ASDF file format (containing metadata for many FITS images) and for the World Coordinate System (WCS), among other things.\n So I'd like to make a new package containing all the tools one might need to work with astronomical images from modern telescopes/observatories. How should it be namespaced?\n There's an existing package that uses the Data.Astro namespace: https://hackage.haskell.org/package/astro. The fits-parse package uses Data.Fits\n Let's assume that I create a single package for this, and name it telescope. Should the code be namespaced under Data or not? If yes, should I use a different namespace than the Data.Astro that the astro package uses?\n Option 1: Pick my own Top-level Namespace\n import Telescope.Fits import Telescope.Asdf import Telescope.Wcs \n Option 2: Add packages to existing namespaces like `Data.Astro`, which is used by the `astro` package\n Note that the `astro` package deals with calculating the position of celestial bodies, which is every bit as as valid a use of the word astronomy, but has a very different focus from my work to process astronomical observations.\n -- from this package! import Data.Astro.Fits import Data.Astro.Wcs -- from `astro` package import Data.Astro.Sun \n Option 3: Pick a new namespace under `Data` to differentiate from the other packages\n import Data.Telescope.Fits import Data.Telescope.Wcs \n What's the right approach here?\n    submitted by    /u/embwbam  \n [link]   [comments]",

This API allows you to construct an input interface based on a data type of your choice. Each input in the form corresponds to a field in your data type. This API then automatically dispatches keyboard and mouse input events to each form input field, manages rendering of the form, notifies the user when a form field's value is invalid, and stores valid inputs in your data type when possible \n  \nI have a requirement where, I have, say a list of column names from a db table, and I want to make a brick form to insert a new row in the db table.\n Since I could select any db table at run time, the column names can change at run time.\n So at best the data type I can have is a thin wrapper around the list of column names. \n How can I make brick form with such a data type?\n For simplicity lets assume, the form ,for all the input fields rendered, accepts only string values or Text values. \n If I cannot make a form with such a data type, what are the alternatives?\n    submitted by    /u/kushagarr  \n [link]   [comments]",

Suppose the following structure:\n Text.JSON.Format ├── Text.JSON.Format.Object └── Text.JSON.Format.Array \n Where the outermost Text.JSON.Format exports ppValue to prettyprint a JSON Value which in turn uses ppObject and ppArray from respective internal modules.\n The problem is, when prettyprinting an object or an array, you would need to refer to ppValue to prettyprint the values inside the object or array, which cannot be done without creating a cyclic dependency.\n If that's unclear, here's the simplified project:\n ```haskell module Text.JSON.Format (ppValue) where\n import qualified Data.Aeson as Aeson import Prettyprinter\n import Text.JSON.Format.Object (ppObject) import Text.JSON.Format.Array (ppArray)\n ppValue :: Int -> Aeson.Value -> Doc ann ppValue nesting = \\case Aeson.Object obj -> ppObject nesting obj Aeson.Array arr -> ppArray nesting arr other -> ppByteStringLazy $ Aeson.encode other ```\n  \n```haskell module Text.JSON.Format.Object (ppObject) where\n import qualified Data.Aeson as Aeson import Text.JSON.Format (ppValue) -- error!\n ppObject :: Int -> Aeson.Object -> Doc ann ppObject nesting obj = ... -- uses ppValue ```\n  \n```haskell module Text.JSON.Format.Array (ppArray) where\n import qualified Data.Aeson as Aeson import Text.JSON.Format (ppValue) -- error!\n ppArray :: Int -> Aeson.Array -> Doc ann ppArray nesting arr = ... -- uses ppValue ```\n There would be no problem when ppObject and ppArray are defined in the same module as ppValue, had their implementations not been too bulky and complex; sadly they are, thus it would be better to separate them.

Until recently, however, I didn't have a compelling enough project for me to grit my teeth and work through all the issues associated with learning to program in a language properly.\n Last year, my wfie and I walked the Camino Santigo and, since I had plenty of time to think and not much else to do, I started to think about how to better plan the daily stages. It takes 30-40 days to complete and guidebooks tend to give stages for a \"normal\" pilgrim; we discovered that we started flagging at about 25km or so.\n So building a Camino planner that optimises the stages for the entire journey, based on people's preferences in terms of distance, time, accommodation etc. became that project.\n You can give the result a spin at https://de-calixtinus.org It's a yesod website that uses dynamic programming to plan out the route. The source code is at https://github.com/charvolant/de-calixtinus\n I'm painfully aware that this has been a learning project. You can see traces of it where, for example, I've become comfortable with something like applicative programming but haven't got around to rethinking previous stuff in the light of my new knowledge. Yesod is a bugger to learn and the scaffolding makes it wilfully obscure, so you can see where I've been going through things in a step-wise fashion, slowly pulling stuff in from the scaffolding once I've understood what's going on. The fields work, but there's obviously more stuff needed. The configuration is trapped partway between where it was a stand-alone program and where it became a web application. And so on.\n If any kind soul wanted to look over the code and suggest improvements or completely better ways of looking at things, I'd be most grateful.\n    submitted by    /u/orlock  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Apologies for the super newbie question below--I'm just now exploring Haskell. If there's a more appropriate place for asking questions like this, please let me know.\n I'm very inexperienced with statically typed language (haven't used one in years), but I work in a research lab where we use Clojure, and as a thought experiment, I'm trying to work out how our core Clojure system would be implemented in Haskell. The key challenge seems to be that Haskell doesn't allow polymorphic lists--or I saw someone call them heterogeneous lists?--with more than one concrete type. That's gonna cause a big problem for me, unless I'm missing something.\n So we have this set of \"components.\" These are clojure objects that all have the same core functions defined on them (like a haskell typeclass), but they all do something different. Essentially, they each take in as input a list of elements, and then produce as output a new list of elements. These elements, like the components, are heterogeneous. They're implemented as Clojure hashmaps that essentially map from a keyword to anything. They could be implemented statically as records, but there would be many different records, and they'd all need to go into the same list (or set).\n So that's the challenge. We have a heterogenous set of components that we'd want to represent in a single list/set, and these produce a hetereogeneous set of elements that we'd want to represent in a single list/set. There might be maybe 30-40 of each of these, so representing every component in a single disjunctive data type doesn't seem feasible.\n Does that question make sense? I'm curious if there's a reasonable solution in Haskell that I'm missing. Thanks.\n    submitted by    /u/mister_drgn  \n [link]   [comments]",

However, after examining the code, it will still run separate transactions unless you call withTransaction and run everything in TransactionM.\n I thought about using some thread local state to store the current SqlBackend and use that if it's available, but I'm not sure if it's the right approach.\n How is this generally handled?

          "description": "Lean 4 has a very cool feature that allows monadic do-blocks to contain imperative loops and mutable variables. This paper provides the motivation and theoretical underpinning.\n Since the concept is portable to any purely functional language supporting monad transformers, I thought it would be a fun experiment to implement it as a GHC plugin. The resulting plugin, donuts, allows for writing imperative style code such as this:\n guessPass :: IO Bool guessPass = do let Mut guesses = [] let Mut n = 1 :: Int whileL (n < 5) $ do putStrLn $ \"Enter guess #\" <> show n input <- getLine guesses := input : guesses when (input == \"secret123\") $ earlyReturn True n := n + 1 putStrLn $ \"All wrong: \" <> intercalate \", \" guesses pure False \n which the plugin desugars to monad transformer applications: ExceptT for control flow and StateT for mutable variables. Note that this works for any monadic do-block, not just IO.\n The imperativity is local in the sense that mutable variables are only mutable within the confines of the enclosing do-block's body statements as well as the bodies of loops occurring in that block. Similar restrictions apply for control flow commands such as earlyReturn, breakL, and continueL.\n    submitted by    /u/aaron-allen  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I am upgrading a lot of Scala 2.13 services up to Scala 3, and have encountered some codebases where reflection was used in unit tests to examine all the subclasses of a trait.\n For example, in 2.x the way to make enumerations was with a sealed trait and case object subclasses. We would often make a collection listing all types, similar to Java enum .values. In our unit tests we would want to make sure no subtypes were accidentally omitted from that collection, and we would use reflection for that.\n ```scala import scala.reflect.runtime.universe\n val classType = universe.typeOf[Branding] val subclasses = classType.typeSymbol.asClass.knownDirectSubclasses ```\n This is gone in Scala 3 and I'm wondering if there is a simple alternative. I would love to spend a day or two learning the new Scala macro syntax but I don't have the time right now to devote to that, just for this simple 2-line expression.\n One might also suggest just updating our 2-style enums to Scala 3 proper enums. That will solve some of our scenarios but we use this \"find subclass types\" in tests for other classes as well, not just enums. For example we might occasionally have a trait with many subclasses and we want to make sure we have written a certain kind of test for each of the concrete subclasses, and reflection can come in handy as a sanity check here.\n gzoller/scala-reflection seems popular but I don't see any documentation.\n    submitted by    /u/jim_mccabe  \n [link]   [comments]",

It is possible to freely mix code compiled with and without a plugin, if you accidentally forget the plugin when it was needed, you will receive a compile-time error.\n  \nLogic module:\n  \nExtend API, add a few examples in tests, and an implementation of CpsLogicMonad over LazyList.\n  \nURL: https://github.com/rssh/dotty-cps-async \n    submitted by    /u/rssh1  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello ! \n I'm getting into FP and I was wondering of how hard & practical it would be implement Leetcode type of questions in a purely functional way (Scala for instance).\n I do feel not using any mutable variable would make some algorithms more complicated to implement. The code would be perhaps harder to read. Sometimes less efficient as well. \n What are your thoughts on this? Would you say FP and immutability make sense for some more or less complex algorithms? \n Also, once again I'm no FP expert but I'd tend to think it's okay to have mutable state if the method do not produce any real side effects. As long as no class instance variables or global variables are mutated by a method, having some \"var\" inside a method can be an okay choice if it makes the code more readable and efficient. Why would it be so bad to have a \"var\" inside a pure method? \n I'd love to hear your thoughts. \n Thanks in advance!\n    submitted by    /u/yinshangyi  \n [link]   [comments]",

Is it worth it? I don't feel that my code is better and more secure when I use Cats Effect compared to my FP+OOP Scala mix.\n I am used to Akka stack for backend - mostly classic actors, cluster, Akka Streams for data processing (like IoT management system for example), and just Scala for internal tools and game development. I don't see what is the benefit of dropping my current way of using Scala and use Cats Effect/Zio instead.\n The worst thing is - that pure functional programming with Cats Effect or Zio is so popular in Scala world, that I can't find any job not mentioning it (well, maybe some big data ones).\n Do you have any suggestions that could help me find answers for my question? Maybe effects are not suitable for my use cases? Are they better for solving some special niche problems? Which ones? Thank you in advance!\n    submitted by    /u/ByerN  \n [link]   [comments]",

This orders.org will then have a header \n * Order B7 Blinds :sometag: \n then I make it TODO and add details of the ordering to the note. I come from the relational database world where the instinct is not to crowd everything into one table, rather create a new table to normalize. But is that \"best practice\" with org-agenda? My instinct is to separate out all the stages, parts of the project install blinds. However, what I might have seen so far is people simply adding sub-headings for each sub-task, stage, etc. So the ordering blinds might be a sub-heading TODO? Or perhaps just more added list items? What's the best practice here?\n    submitted by    /u/teilchen010  \n [link]   [comments]",

So, something like this for blocks to be framed:\n #BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :do-the-mdframed-thing yes \n and for those not to be framed (because they're not being exported to the PDF in the first place) just continuing with their current:\n #BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :exports none \n Alternatively, is there perhaps some directive at or above file scope -- maybe something in a #+<SOMETHING>: line at the top of the file? -- which would make mdframing be the default for all code blocks, but for which there is an \"off\" switch that could be applied individually to the exceptions? \n ​\n ​\n    submitted by    /u/TeeMcBee  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I've been an org mode user for around 3 years now, I use it for practically everything task- and note-oriented. I'm in it and emacs most of the day.\n However, the one aspect I have never quite understood is why TODOs seem the same as headings. My natural expectation is that when taking notes, especially with meetings, I want to slot in a TODO based on the context of the notes at that time. But with a TODO being a heading, all the plain text notes below it come under that heading. So I tend to have a heading at the bottom of the notes section called Tasks or something under which I enter the TODOs for that meeting, but that approach does lose the context location from the full notes--not a major issue, but flipping about to record TODOs does disrupt flow.\n So, what am I missing? I did search on this a bit and think identified that some people just use headings for the full notes, and any plain text under a heading is just brief explanation or extra detail for that heading but may be omitted altogether. However, the way headings are formatted by default with bold doesn't feel natural for note-taking (I use Prot's Modus themes, and then a mixture of formatting from System Crafters videos).\n Or maybe I have missed something really obvious.

In fact after the capture there are two empty lines created after the title but the cursor is placed on the line immediately following the title - it seems to me that it does not matter how much white space you add at the end of your template, the cursor always seems to be inserted immediately after the title.\n So my question: Is there a way to configure a capture template in such a way that after the capture the cursor is 2 lines below the title with an empy line between the title and the cursor?\n    submitted by    /u/ghiste  \n [link]   [comments]",

I don't typically want to see these recurring events when looking out 1-3 months. \n I also use agenda icons so I categorize these with different icons so they differentiate at a glance.

I've added it to Doom's config.el, which I believe is analogous to Emacs init.el. My config.el file has ;;; $DOOMDIR/config.el -*- lexical-binding: t; -*- at the top, and describe-variable shows that the value for lexical-binding is indeed 't' in this buffer. When I evaluate the entire buffer, I catch a void-variable (tag-name), which (I believe?) shouldn't be happening when lexical-binding is turned on. However, evaluating only the additional region within the same buffer works fine (temporarily, of course). How can I figure out what's going on?\n Edit #1: selecting every line in the buffer and evaluating as a region works as well. Is my lexical-binding local variable being overlooked for some reason?\n Edit #2: Solved - It was because there was a single white character before ;;; $DOOMDIR.\n  ;;; $DOOMDIR/config.el -*- lexical-binding: t; -*- . . .

Or is the intention that everything should be in a silo, rather than in the default `denote-directory`?\n Either way, I think things could get complicated working in different silos (assuming the goal is to keep them separate). Perhaps what is needed is some indication prepended to buffer-name of the silo - e.g. if the silo is in ~/Orgs/Silo1 and the #+title is \"My plain title\", the buffer name would be \"Silo1:My plain title\". If we were in the default `denote-directory` , buffer-name would just be \"My plain title\".\n Thanks\n Nick\n    submitted by    /u/N1ck_B  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I'll preface by stating that I use project.el, and not projectile. Any solutions involving the latter won't do for me.\n In most other editors, you can create a file at the project root (or some other predefined path) that specifies settings and, among other things, launch commands.\n These commands are for anything related to the project, be it running, compiling, testing, debugging, whatever.\n I want something like this for emacs. So, I've been investigating possible ways to do it.\n I created a .dir-locals.el file on the project root. Emacs automatically loads this file. In it, I defined numerous variables with commands. I defined compile-command and created my own, like run-command and test-command.\n I would then need to create functions that read these variables and run their values, similar to how compile-command is handled. This would work just fine, but there's an issue.\n Since the variables I'm creating are unknown to emacs, it marks them as risky. So, what ends up happening is that every time you open a file where these variables would apply, you get a prompt asking you if you want to apply the variables.\n I managed to fix this by setting these variables as safe when giving them strings like this:\n (put 'compile-and-run-command 'safe-local-variable #'stringp) (put 'run-command 'safe-local-variable #'stringp) (put 'test-command 'safe-local-variable #'stringp) \n And while this works, it irks me the wrong way, since this file would obviously be bundled with the project. So, if anyone else downloads this project and opens it with emacs, they won't have this extra config and they will be bugged by it, and for no good reason since they won't have the functions that use these variables anyway so it's of no use to them.\n So, I'm looking for a way to:\n  \nDefine an arbitrary amount of commands to run on a project.\n Have this configuration loaded automatically.\n Not be a nuisance to third parties.\n  \nAny ideas?\n    submitted by    /u/SnooPets20  \n [link]   [comments]",

Changelog is available here.\n This release integrates Kele with the menu bar. With this initial integration, you can switch Kubernetes contexts and default namespaces from within the menu bar. Kele presents your available contexts and namespaces as dynamic sub-menus, freeing you from the need to remember exact names and typing them in by hand (similar to kubectx and kubens on the terminal).\n https://preview.redd.it/lhzkprkuk9uc1.png?width=1512&format=png&auto=webp&s=8662d3e5c17ef2b864a8089b52dbd33c5641eb32\n With this release, Kele is now also integrated with doom-modeline. By adding the k8s segment to your doom-modeline configuration, you'll see current context and namespace information directly on the modeline. By clicking the segment, you can also access the menu bar, for the (menu-bar-mode -1) crowd.\n https://preview.redd.it/sx90o1w4k9uc1.png?width=820&format=png&auto=webp&s=8be6f1ceac15d87628b00d5ff9e4d95a224bf0cb\n https://preview.redd.it/nhtff5ink9uc1.png?width=1214&format=png&auto=webp&s=361736c62d4b83173a7e9f94aeadbd621692cf57\n For more details, see the Kele documentation.

Then there are some other links that do work immediately, which makes it even more odd.\n You can see this in the dashboard.el recent files or project list. It can also be spotted on treemacs. Links in org mode buffers seem to be instant tho. It is quite inconsistent.\n In any case, I am more interested in knowing how can I see what function is reposnsible for the mouse highlighting on hover. I tried to use the profiler, but the function doesn't show up. I guess it's very deep in emacs, something from the C core most likely which would be a bummer.

          "description": "Hello emacs community, no matter how hard i try i cannot seem to wrap my head around the idea of using hooks in emacs. I have two examples to provide. The one working and the other one not, although i've seen both in the documentation.\n First example: Defining a function and then passing in to the hook.\n ```emacs-lisp (defun my-c-mode-hook () (setq c-basic-offset 4 indent-tabs-mode nil electric-indent-mode nil) (message \"C-mode hook loaded successfully\"))\n (add-hook 'c-mode-common-hook 'my-c-mode-hook) ``` Even though the message prints, the variables don't seem to get the values.\n Second example:\n emacs-lisp (add-hook 'c-mode-common-hook (lambda () (setq c-basic-offset 4 indent-tabs-mode nil electric-indent-mode nil) (message \"C-mode hook loaded successfully\" ))) \n The second one, passing a lambda to the hook works. It also is the same for my latex-mode hooks.\n So my question is, what is the difference between the two methods and what am i missing here. If anyone wants to share a resource for working with emacs hooks it will also be really appreciated.\n On the note of hooks, i have a more general question. When using the setq-default it will set the variable globally if it can. tab-width for example if set with `setq-default does not apply to all buffers. But if it is passed with a hook it works. Correct me if i'm wrong but does that happen because the settings get overwritten by the major mode? That's why you need the hook to overwrite the major mode defaults perhaps???\n Thank you in advance.\n    submitted by    /u/CrispyBoye  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I'm having to write jsx/tsx, and I want the best possible experience dealing with this pesky syntax elements.\n What do you folks use these days? I'm basically hoping to improve the following aspects:\n  \nTyping jsx/tsx forms\n Folding\n Structural editing\n  \n \nFor the first thing I probably can still use Emmet mode. Or maybe there's something better now?\n \nSince I'm already using treesitter, for folding I tried: emacs-tree-sitter/ts-fold, but because I'm using Emacs 30, I had to use this fork: abougouffa/treesit-fold, see emacs-tree-sitter/ts-fold#48 for details. That though still didn't get me the desired outcome. If I have a component such as:\n export default function Home() { return ( <main> <div> <p> ... \n \n and I try folding around <p>, it folds the entire function body. Not sure why. In general, I'm not sure what to use for folding to make it work with treesitter - ts-fold/treesit-fold, hideshow, evil-fold, origami, bicycle, yafolding, evil-vimish-fold, or something else?\n  \nFor structural editing I'm not even sure what would be helpful here. I'm thinking of trying evil-matchit, to quickly jump to beginning/end of an element, because evil's % keybinding doesn't support html tags by default, but that's just one aspect. There are probably a few other things to consider?\n  \nWhat are your thoughts? In general, do you know of any other Emacs packages you'd recommend for web-development? Also, I noticed that not all the features of emacs-tree-sitter/elisp-tree-sitter went into core (again, I'm using Emacs 30), do you think it's worth loading the package instead of relying on what's already in the core?\n    submitted by    /u/ilemming  \n [link]   [comments]",

It is wierd that these keybinds cannot be scannable for emacs. When I press it, emacs simply do not responding. The minibuffer waits for next input like `C-x-C-` even if I pressed multiple times `s`, and when i pressing other key on keyboard, It responds and that other binding is executed. I'm able to use `S-s` for saving and `S-f` for I-search instead, but these keybindings are not comfortable for my hands, so I really want to use the original one.\n Is there anyone experiencing same thing on macOS?

Given the complexity of these platforms, the feature primarily supports synchronization from Emacs to the browser, with additional nuances due to the simulation approach.\n Important to Note:\n This experimental feature heavily relies on the presence of some default keyboard shortcuts within these web editors. These shortcuts are essential for simulating actions such as selection, deletion, and text navigation.\n For a detailed explanation and the full list of these shortcuts, please refer to our documentation on experimental Monaco support.\n I also primarily tested it on Linux. Although I have translated shortcuts to be Mac-compatible too, I haven't tested it extensively.\n Try It Out: If you’re interested in testing this feature or want to see how Chrome-Emacs can enhance your coding sessions, visit the Chrome Web Store.

I use a terminal emulator which runs in emacs on the laptop. Sometimes this involves opening files, often automatically, in $EDITOR (e.g. for a git commit). I want to configure $EDITOR so that the instance of emacs running the terminal emulator is also used as $EDITOR on the server, when I'm sshed into it. Ideally, I'd like to set it up so that if I ssh from a terminal which isn't running in emacs, a different program (one local to the server, e.g. nano) will be used, but that's a later question.\n How can I do this? I've read a cursory explanation here, but that seems to require a shared filesystem, and it's pretty brief -- I'm new to any kind of networking. I do like the idea of using emacsserver to achieve all this though.\n TIA!\n    submitted by    /u/Jack-o-tall-tales  \n [link]   [comments]",

My project is built using gradlew.\n I then started a new git worktree in issues/1168... and opened a file in there. I got errors about all kinds of missing imports. When I run lsp-describe-session I get the output below. The file \"Playoff.java\" has been opened from issues/1168, the other files are opened from fll-sw/working-dir. I see that the jdtls process id is the same for both directories and that seems odd to me given that they are different projects.\n Can someone point me to documentation on what I'm not doing correctly here?\n [-] /home/jpschewe/projects/fll-sw/issues/1168.head-head-table-assignment/working-dir `-[-] jdtls:68475 |-[-] Buffers | |-[+] Playoff.java | |-[+] Version.java | |-[+] ScoresheetGenerator.java | `-[+] Queries.java `-[+] Capabilities [-] /home/jpschewe/projects/fll-sw/working-dir `-[-] jdtls:68475 |-[-] Buffers | |-[+] Playoff.java | |-[+] Version.java | |-[+] ScoresheetGenerator.java | `-[+] Queries.java `-[+] Capabilities \n    submitted by    /u/jpschewe  \n [link]   [comments]",

For a while I've been mostly successfully being able to use Emacs in Termux for org-roam on my mobile phone. \n However, in the past few months any org-roam 'look-up' operations, like org-roam-node-insert, org-roam-node-find, &c. have become slower and slower. Worse, in the past couple of months, after doing one or two such operations it seems to get stuck indefinitely, and trying to cancel out with C-g does nothing the first time, and kills Emacs the second time.\n I'm not sure whether the issue is that my org-roam file library has continued to grow or whether it's to do with changes to Android (there have been a few Android OS updates in that time period). Or whether the issue is with accessing a larger sqlite database or whether it's to do with the actual file-lookup operations (more org-roam files over time).\n Is anyone in a similar situation? Any ideas of how to resolve this? Maybe at the Termux level?

It's org-brain and I can't really figure out where/what the first function call is. org-brain works by having a set of org files and the headings in org files to be ID'ed (UUID in a PROPERTIES drawer) then create a quasi-graph view of the org files and heading hierarchies in a graph/network-like child, parent, friend relationships between files and headings. So I'm trying to figure out how this whole thing starts. My guess is it takes org-element to parse out the ID attached to a file or headings, then creates some graph store cache. Or maybe not...\n Investigations found a use of org-refile here that will gather up all the headings in a designated directory, and, yes, org-brain does utilize org-refile, but just for actual refiling. Dead end. The org-brain author, who wants to not maintain anymore did say this:\n  \nThe entries are cached and stored in memory after the first \"scan\" of a session. I think there are ways to store the cache to disk.\n  \nbut I can't find how this is being done. AFAICT, org-brain simply starts with some location entry, a file or heading, and simply works-crawls in whatever direction from there, i.e., there is no cache in memory or hash table. That is, org-brain is nothing but the visualization and not a graph database management app. There is something referring to .org-id-locations, but I don't believe this is used in org-brain to create a cache. Any ideas? I basically need to step/trace through this monster. I'm guessing if I can find it's very first action, I'll have my best shot at figuring out if indeed everything is read and cached.\n    submitted by    /u/teilchen010  \n [link]   [comments]",

Apart from this, Eglot and Clangd is working very well for me, I have never seen Clangd crash in any other situation.\n I have tried both LLVM's Clangd installed using homebrew (I'm on macOS) and the one package with Xcode, both of them exhibit the same behavior and crash when I open an Objective-C file.\n I haven't analyzed the log from Clangd yet (available in the *Eglot events* buffer) in any detail, I first wanted to check if this is a common problem.

Not that emacs can’t do all those things, just that getting things configured, set up, and working through issues is never worth it to me when I have keyboard layers that keep my hands off the mouse 90% of the time. \n It’s got me curious how much other people use emacs in their day to day. I know the meme is that emacs in the only program you’ll ever need, and that’s true for a lot of people, but I’m curious what the numbers look like. \n Feel free to add to your answer in the comments!\n View Poll\n    submitted by    /u/SegFaultHell  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Following up on my previous post, with WSL version 2.1.5.0 and WSLg version 1.0.60, it appears that the network connection issue killing the X(Wayland) window has been remedied as per this post. The connection is restored and the X window reappears automatically (it changes the position of the icon for Emacs on the taskbar upon reconnection). So compiling from source with with-x-toolkit=lucid seems to be a workable solution and now appears to work better than the X410 (and likely VcXsrv) solution.\n Sometimes, the X window GUI still does crash or whatever and I cannot bring it back - in which case I restart WSLg by opening a PowerShell terminal and enter wsl --system and kill the process associated with ps aux | grep /usr/bin/weston. My Emacs daemon remains running (though it seems to kill off the Python or whatever shell that was running from it, unfortunately) and I can reopen my GUI with emacsclient -c.\n The pure GTK build still hangs and becomes unresponsive as before (presumably from a network disconnection) so that does not appear to be fixed; for the time being the Lucid build is a workable solution.

          "description": "After recently discovering Org-Roam, I’m looking to migrate to a full Emacs setup, but there’s one non-negotiable feature I need to transfer: block references.\n Block references are links in one file to a block of text in another file by means of a uuid. The text is transcluded so you can preview the contents in any file it’s referenced and you can even see the number of backlinks to the original reference. There’s only one plugin that offers at least the uuid-based text block transclusion feature: Roam Block.\n So far, the solutions involved migrating everything from Logseq or Roam to Emacs Org-Mode, but losing block references by imputing the original referenced text in its place. I suspect the solution might look like obtaining the SQL or database file where all block uuids are referenced and somehow transfer this mapping to have the same uuid transcluded the same content. \n If anyone has some ideas as to how to achieve this, I’m more than either to start a conversation on the how. Please understand that I’m trying to keep block references, and cannot leave them out of the solution. So far I’ve found org-transclusion, two org-Logseq scripts on Awesome Logseq, and a roam-migration script, but none of these solutions seem to migrate the block references.\n This really seems like a no-brainer to solve, but I don’t know how would the solution look like. I’m open to any solution whether migrating from Logseq or Roam, as long as block references are migrated :)\n    submitted by    /u/marco_camilo  \n [link]   [comments]",

For example, in the scratch buffer, I see that C-j is bound to eval-print-last-sexp and in tex files, it's bound to reindent-then-newline-and-indent.\n I have a few questions: 1) How I can make my mapping take precedence across all modes (but still have C-j work as normal in other mappings, e.g. C-x C-j for dired jump and 2) How can I override my mapping for a specific list of modes (e.g. in tex-mode, use the multiple cursors mapping, but in scratch buffers use eval-print-last-sexp instead.\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/cs_noob_help_pls  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Some URIs can contain URI fragments, e.g. foo.bar/baz#locator where locator is the fragment. See RFC 5147. Is there a way to reliably handle these in emacs?\n Here's my usecase: I use ebib, which lets me store a PDF filepath in a bibtex entry, then open the file at the filepath with a command when I'm viewing that entry. One problem with this is that often (in my discipline at least) the bibtex entry doesn't relate to a file, it relates to some part of a file (e.g. where the entry is for a paper published in a collection, and my file is a PDF of the whole collection). The obvious way to get around this is to store a URI with a fragment in the bibtex file field (e.g. path/to/my.pdf#page=210 for a paper which starts on page 210 of the collection). \n However, as far as I can tell, emacs doesn't support using URI fragments in finding files. Am I right/wrong? Is there a good known solution?\n To be clear, I know I could write a custom file handler function for ebib specifically, but that seems a bit too specific. I'd rather have a general way of handling this, so that ebib doesn't have to do anything unusual. That way, other applications which deal with the same cases (e.g. citar, in the case above) will inherit the same functionality.\n TIA!\n    submitted by    /u/Jack-o-tall-tales  \n [link]   [comments]",

One is invoking sudo directly, which requires entering my password each time I use it. The other is using tramp; if I try to use it, then in order to terminate the ability to use sudo without a password, I need to terminate the created tramp sudo connection. I could probably solve it by closing such a connection automatically after a certain period, but I can't even find a function that lists all active tramp connections. I saw a discussion on the internet suggesting:\n (setq eshell-prefer-lisp-variables t)\n (setq password-cache t)\n (setq password-cache-expiry 10)\n But it doesn't do anything for my case.There's a command called 'tramp-cleanup-connection'.

I have an idea for a note-taking program that's as nice-looking, performant and friendly as logseq or obsidian, but is fully backed by emacs and org-mode. I need features like tags, transclusion and backlinks, but also want all of Emacs: keyboard macros, eval'ed source blocks, LSP mode, etc. -- but over it all I want a smooth modern UI. I know some folks here will tell me how it's possible in emacs; believe me, I've looked into the options for some years now (org-roam, org-logseq, org-transclusion, org-roam-ui and more) and the ones I've seen are slow or fragile or never bore fruit, so just bear with me and see if we can explore this idea.\n What I'd like is to run emacs in a headless way and sync, in realtime, a set of buffers to a modern UI (maybe electron, who knows). Let's say we have a page in the UI, composed of a set of buffers (a buffer per block, maybe with sub-\"buffers\" transcluded into the UI), and the UI knows which emacs buffer corresponds to each block of text. My idea is the UI forwards keyboard & mouse events to emacs and receives buffer updates (including text props & overlays etc.), which it then displays in an integrated nice way. Could such a thing even be done? I don't want to scrape the emacs pixels -- I want to \"export\" the meaningful contents of the buffer for display over a socket protocol. Text, properties, overlays, images, etc. with their semantics. \n It seems like such a thing could be useful for other purposes as well, like using emacs to edit any text field in any app. Possibly even emacs could then run as an http service as the back end of a web app to run on Android or iOS.

These are stored in a database. It would be really helpful if I had some kind of hint/suggestion as I'm typing it. So for example, if I write something like (Python):\n  \nself.get_document(\"\n  \nI want it to suggest from a list of strings after it fetches from the database. In other cases, I may also have some json files in the project which it needs to look through. I'm not sure if what I need should be implemented as an external LSP or something in Emacs itself. It would also be great if it can show an error if the string is invalid (which would otherwise be valid Python/JS).\n Will I need to write this from scratch or is there something already out there that I can use to build upon? I've just started using Emacs 2 weeks ago and I'm excited to explore how I can use its power to simplify my workflow.

One thing I can't figure out though, is how do I keep Treemacs open until I manually close it, for example when selecting a file that isn't already open in a buffer somewhere? I checked all of the treemacs-visit-node-* functions, but they all seem to close Treemacs with a double prefix. Is there any way to change this behavior?

I also use a custom user.js and UBlock Origin to enhance privacy and security. Pages load very fast. Minimal strain on cpu and enhanced battery life.\n Vimium: Far from perfect, as many standard emacs keybindings like M-> for (end-of-buffer), cannot be implemented. Setting ui.accelKey to 18, ui.key.chromeAccess to 0 and devtools.editor.keymap to \"emacs\" helped.\n GTK2/3: Setting gtk-theme-name = \"Emacs\" really helps and makes editing input fields feel great. Unfortunately this won't be supported anymore once firefox migrates from GTK3 to GTK4.\n  \nMaybe my standards are too high and I should just be happy with what I have.\n But so far I am not willing to give up on it, as my browsing experience is really the last puzzle piece missing to an otherwise perfect workflow.\n Alternative:\n Out of all the alternatives I like Nyxt by far the most.\n It truly supports emacs keybindings and I love the minibuffer. It is a joy to move around.\n If it only was possible to have extensions like UBlock Origin and maybe even swap out WebkitGTK in favor of Firefox's Gecko Engine, I'd make Nyxt my daily driver immediately and never look back. It would be a dream come true.\n I'd really appreciate if some of you guys with requirements similar to mine (vanilla keys, ad-blocking, security and privacy concerns) could share their workflow.\n Although a student on a very tight budget, I'll probably have to start donating regularly to Nyxt to keep my hopes alive.\n    submitted by    /u/schwinghmmr  \n [link]   [comments]",

Was using NValt some time ago, but it's become grossly outdated and unstable.\nI love the idea behind The Archive and its implementation is both visually and conceptually appealing. However, I've discovered a couple of issues with it:\nThe most annoying one is when I get past one page of writing text in a note - in a particularly long paragraph, the frame starts jolting every time I press \"Space\" - scrolling quickly down and up, until I start a new paragraph, and then this behaviour disappears. It might be that this problem has already been reported, but I could not find it in the forum - perhaps I was using wrong keywords.\nAnother issue is with the displaying of the Cyrillic letter \"и\" (which roughly corresponds to the Latin \"i\" as in the word \"Tim\") - for some reason, occasionally it starts to be displayed with a different background to the rest of the text - as if there was a rectangle behind it. I didn't have enough play with different fonts and themes (using PrettyFunctional with Dark mode and the UbuntuMono-Regular 20.0 pt. at the moment)\nI hope someone can advise me on how to overcome the above issues, thank you!",

My only complaint is that The Archive limited to Mac OS X, because I work on Windoze and Linux as well.\nSo, any info about what you're planning that feature to entail would be of great interest to me.\nER",

Here comes a lot of bla-bla, just skip to the Itaic part: I summarised the introduction to the Zettelkasten (this -> °Link°) to get an overview etc. and used 1700 words, but i think thats to much especially if I took a look at the Luhmanns Archive. I worked like with a Word document, so I made different headings and summarised different chapters of the text under them. (I copied a lot although you're not supposed to do that)\nSo: how long should the different note types (literature and permanent) be, what should they contain and how many should I make on a certain topic or source? (no bla-bla anymore)\nIt would be nice if you could take a look at the first 2 or 3 \"chapters\" (link above) and tell me what your Zettel would look like.\ncheers.",

Since then I always want to have a systematic study on how to prevent complications, plan my diet and exercises.\nI just need to figure out where to begin all this.\nMy current plan is to use the DK's Diabete's Handbook as a lead-in, which I hope could give me a systematic overview, and then I plan to add more articles and books to each part of the topic.\nThen I start my plan last week by reading the handbook,  but I notice I have no idea how to read a book. I admit it indeed sounds silly. I was a good student when I was in the college. Now I'm not. I don't know what to do when I go through each line, paragraph on the page.\nSo I'm wondering if anyone could share a realistic approach to read a book/books/article. By realistic, I mean I really hope it's not some theory education with really confused vocabularies. Think me like a 12 year old student, not some top scientists.\nThank you and wish you all well.",
