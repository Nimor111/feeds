Also, let me know what you think of the article. Bear in mind this is the first such article I've written in maybe 12 years, so maybe don't rip into it too much :) It's all meant to be a little informal and inspirational rather than a fully prescriptive solution to every problem.\n    submitted by    /u/cheater00  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have a shell script that converts these into HTML files using Pandoc (because what kind of Haskell enthusiast would I be if I didn't use Pandoc!).\n I am using the Haskell library to make filters for my Pandoc, and I see I can use multiple instances of --filter but I would rather not and just have my one filter do everything I need. Lets say I wanted to do something to any Inline Str instance that starts with a @ and I also want to act on any Block Codeblock instance that is a $haskell type: ```haskell module Main where\n import qualified Data.Text as T import Text.Pandoc.JSON\n main :: IO () main = do -- toJSONFilter dollarHaskellBlock toJSONFilter linkToBlog return ()\n -- | Lets me act specially on codeblocks labeled '$haskell' dollarHaskellBlock :: Block -> Block dollarHaskellBlock (CodeBlock (identifier, cls:clss, keyValue) codeText) | cls == T.pack \"$haskell\" = CodeBlock (identifier, T.pack \"haskell\":clss, keyValue) newCodeText where newCodeText = codeText -- do something here dollarHaskellBlock x = x\n -- | adds a link to any blog with a word in the form @word linkToBlog :: Inline -> Inline linkToBlog (Str strText) | head strString == '@' = linkTo where strString = T.unpack strText linkTo = Link ( T.empty , [] , [] ) [ Underline [ Str (T.tail strText) ] ] ( T.pack (\"./\" ++ (tail . T.unpack . T.toLower) strText ++ \".html\") , T.empty ) linkToBlog x = x ```\n In this case I can use one or the other here and the executable will act as a filter, but I feel like I should be able to do one after the other, but just running both in the do block fails :(.\n Is there a solution here?

Of course, I am using current time just for the sake of the example; it can be any other function that the module does not need to know about.\n I know that Haskell allows that, but would warn about orphan instances. For that purpose, I followed the GHC compiler advice and used the wrapped type; although I liked the code better with orphan instance.\n I wonder—what would be the better way to implement such StopWatch?

However, my AST nodes do not store any positional (or spanning) information. So if I find a semantic error, I can only tell what the error is but cannot provide any line or column number information.\n The easiest way to solve this is to store the spanning information on most nodes I have defined, which is tedious and lengthy.

Coming from C++ background, I understand \"built-in\" as constructs recognizable by compiler without including external libraries. In Haskell however I see in many literature sources, types like Int|Num| Bool, are treated as \"built-in\", or core language features, though they can be easily \"excluded\", by disabling Prelude module, which in my understanding is just external \"library\" included by default. To add to confusion, some core language constructs, like guards will not even work without including Prelude. On other hand constructs like \n import Prelude() \n foo x = 1\n compiles well, but then what is the \"1\" type in this case (Isn't Num defined by including Prelude)?\n So I guess the question is - Where true (in C++ sense) bult-in language features can be found if at all. And should Prelude be understood as true external library or as \"grey area\" combining both traits of external library and compiler intrinsic syntax. \n    submitted by    /u/klazklaz  \n [link]   [comments]",

This issue is actively impacting my ability to maintain wlhs, so I would appreciate any ideas!)\n For the past few weeks, I and others have been developing wlhs, a set of Haskell bindings to libwayland and wlroots. For the most part, development on my side has run fairly smoothly.\n However, when I tried to build wlhs two days ago, I received the following error:\n $ cabal build Resolving dependencies... Error: cabal: Could not resolve dependencies: [__0] next goal: wlhs-bindings (user goal) [__0] rejecting: wlhs-bindings-0.1.0 (conflict: pkg-config package wayland-server-any, not found in the pkg-config database) [__0] fail (backjumping, conflict set: wlhs-bindings) After searching the rest of the dependency tree exhaustively, these were the goals I've had most trouble fulfilling: wlhs-bindings \n Despite the error message saying that wayland-server is ‘not found in the pkg-config database’, it clearly is present on my system:\n $ pkg-config --modversion wayland-server 1.22.0 \n What makes this strange is how suddenly it stopped working. Two days ago, I couldn’t build wlhs; the day before, I could. (Or at least, I have no memory of it failing before that.) Does anyone have any ideas around how to fix this problem?\n For reference, I’m using pkgconf-2.1.0. (Installed on December 7, so that hasn’t changed recently.) I have also tested several Cabal versions: it fails with 3.10.2.1 and 3.10.1.0, as well as current HEAD. It does succeed with cabal-3.6.2.0, but that version is unusable for me as it can’t handle my custom Setup.hs.

          "description": "Or: How to say if some value is of Type X?\n Hi I am implementing a small parser to learn type level (programming) Haskell.\n I have the following data types for:\n data Exp = Num Int | Plus Exp Exp\n data SExp = Atom Type | L [SExp]\n And I want a function that does the following:\n parse :: SExp -> Exp \n parse (Atom s) = if typeOf s == Int then Num s else _\n I understand the existing of function typeOf. But is there a way to do this equality without passing an actual value (i.e. typeOf s == typeOf 1 or typeOf s == typeOf 'c'). Things that come to mind, but don't know how to implement, is to use type families since one can they map types to types.

          "description": "Hi, feel free to guide me out but I have a strong feeling Haskellers already have this figured out.\n I'm a python programmer coming from research background. I fell in love with programming and functional programming always had this allure for me. I have read quite a bit on functional programming, Bartoz Milewskis \"Category theory for programmers\" and doing the haskell.mooc.fi\n To learn the things actually, I started writing a simplified version of card game Dominion with python and trying to use pseudo-Haskell approach. Why? I'm more fluent in python for now (especially IO) and a game like Dominion is inherently stateful so I thought this would be a good practice.\n I have record (dataclass in python) called playerState which contains deck, hand, discarcd_pile i.e. things that model individual player. For now, I have a gameState that contains a list of playerStates and central_supply that is global for all players.\n All card effects are pure, often partial functions effect::playerState, someArg->playerState. For example draw::playerState -> num_cards -> playerState. Here is an example of a card that draws one card and gains one card: gainDraw = Card( name=\"Gain Victory point and draw 1 card\", card_type=\"Action\", cost=2, effects=[gain victoryCard, draw 1], ). Now the \"cool part\" is that I have a function play_card:: playerState -> Card -> playerState that simply composes all effects of a card to one single composite function and applies it to playerState. Playing one card is then one elegant transition from state1 to state2 with no intermediary assigments etc. So far so good.\n Now the problem: some card effects modify also the global gameState and not just fields in playerState. Essentially I have globalState containing localStates. What is a common solution in Haskell or in functional paradigm in general to handle nested states? A whole different architecture, lifting types? You can be harsh and say that my domain(ion, sorry had to) modeling is all wrong.\n    submitted by    /u/SkyrPudding  \n [link]   [comments]",

Thank you!!\n EDIT: I wrote this code to hold the spot, until better code comes. For now this may be useful to others. I took advantage of the fact I'm only using Either[Exception,List[_]]. The example code basically runs as it. Maybe someone somewhere finds this useful too!\n import scala.annotation.tailrec class ListT[A](val run:Either[Exception,List[A]]) { def flatMap[B](func:A=>ListT[B]):ListT[B]= run match { case Right(list) => @tailrec def churn(remainder:List[A])(accum:List[B]):ListT[B]= remainder match { case Nil => ListT(Right(accum)) case head::tail => val intermediate = func(head) intermediate.run match { case l:Left[Exception,List[B]] => intermediate case Right(list) => churn(tail)(list++accum) } } churn(list)(Nil) case l:Left[Exception,_] => this.asInstanceOf[ListT[B]] } def map[B](func:A=>B):ListT[B]= run match { case l:Left[Exception,List[A]] => l.asInstanceOf[ListT[B]] case Right(list) => ListT(Right(list.map(func))) } } \n ​\n    submitted by    /u/jbreaka  \n [link]   [comments]",

Nowadays, in a society based on computers and applications, crackers attacks are very concrete and dangerous. In my opinion, when we talk about IT security, it is always better to overestimate the risk and have a large margin of tolerance. The (hard) trade-off we have to make is that the solution is usable, has good performance, and is safe.\n  \nOften, it is not a single solution that makes something safe; it is the sum of several approaches that mitigate the risk.\n  \n History\n It has been a while since I had my first idea for a library that would help developers securely manage secret values within their app…",

If so, what is the reason for this? Compile time annotations like @tailrec or @depreciation still work, and I also saw that a MacroAnnotation class was introduced under an experimental flag in Scala 3.3.0, but I'm not sure what is left to accomplish so that it could be merged into the latest Scala version.\n I appreciate any clarification on this topic!

Nothing special or particularly challenging. The stack was classic \"spartan\": Tapir, ZIO, Quill, Circe, Cats...\n The good:\n Tapir folks nailed it! That's pretty much all I can say about them. ZIO also worked flawlessly. Quill was a pleasant surprise since it was the spot where I expected most of the obstacles. Although, the general documentation of Quill could be improved. E.g. in the context of structure, more examples, etc. But in all fairness, well done.\n The bad:\n Some things do not work quite well with new Scala features. E.g. a lot of hacking around various encoders and decoders for opaque types or enums. Some libraries are still not supported which is bonkers. E.g. I miss Scalamock and Cornichon.\n The ugly:\n Tooling. The neverending story... Let's begin with Metals. Metals is like a... musket. Sometimes it fires, sometimes it misfires, and sometimes explodes straight to your face. In a lot of cases, I had to kill its Java process, remove the target dir., and reimport the project. Funny enough, IntelliJ worked okish. With, few error reports when there are no actual errors. However, the experience is kind of clunkier than with Scala 2. Also, I noticed that sometimes incremental compilation doesn't work quite well and you can end up with some weird behavior.\n The unnecessary: \n Indentation syntax. I don't want to start a rant... especially if I start asking questions about how much time and resources this feature required. Especially, since Scala has much greater \"burning issues\". In all fairness, I didn't see any benefit from having this.\n To conclude: \n The experience was ok, spiced with some rough edges. From a Scala beginner's perspective, I presume it would be quite nasty. Overall, there's still a lot of work to do.\n    submitted by    /u/rom_romeo  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I've been messing with this problem for a while now, off and on for months, really, and it's driving me a little bit crazy, so here we are.\n The specific thing I'm trying to do is exit insert mode (modal editing, previously evil, currently trying meow) when I arrive back in the main org mode file after editing a src block. I'm not actually sure why I end up in insert mode sometimes when exiting src edit, but it happens often. Advising `org-edit-src-exit` is the place to be for this as far as I can tell, and that works when returning to the main org file.\n The problem I have is that editing a src block without calling `org-edit-special`, thus staying in the main org file, will also trigger the advice. Pressing RET, or using anything that makes a new line in the src block (like `meow-insert-above/below`) will call `org-edit-src-exit` and its advice, and I can't find any way to tell in the context of that advice whether the edit is happening in a special edit buffer or not. I'm guessing that editing src blocks without calling `org-edit-special` happens in a background buffer anyway so the process is indistinguishable?\n I've tried checking the major-mode before exiting the edit buffer, but it's always org-mode. I've tried using `org-in-src-block-p`, `org-src-edit-buffer-p`, checking `org-src-mode`, setting a local variable after `org-edit-special` that I can check in my advice, so many things that haven't worked.\n It's very possible that I'm missing something obvious, or there's a very different solution to my specific problem, but even if so, I'm still curious about how to distinguish these src block editing situations. Anybody have any ideas?\n    submitted by    /u/vaxdar  \n [link]   [comments]",

So if I have:\n #+PROPERTY: CATEGORY_ALL Value1 Value2 Value3 \n then ‘C-c C-x p’ (‘org-set-property’) ignores the list in CATEGORY_ALL.[1] Furthermore, neither ‘S-<RIGHT>’ (‘org-property-next-allowed-value’) nor ‘S-<LEFT>’ (‘org-property-previous-allowed-value’ pay attention to it either. In fact both of them respond with \"Allowed values for this property have not been defined\".\n Is that the expected behavior, or am I doing something wrong?\n [1] Org may well give a completion list, but only if CATEGORY has already been given values elsewhere in the file, and then the list consists of all those values, and it still ignores CATEGORY_ALL. And that list of pre-used values is not enforced, the way an _ALL list is.

          "description": "Hello all,\n This is part of my effort to replace my three TiddlyWiki instances with org files. I've looked at a number of conversion tools written by others, and ended up rolling a small(-ish) Perl script to do about 90% of the conversion, from a JSON export of a given TW instance.\n The first TW instance I've converted is a journal of my scale modeling projects. In it, I have future projects, current projects, and completed projects. I would like it if the completed projects (all of which have a tag \"Completed\" on their level-1 headline) were folded. I read in the manual that adding :VISIBILITY: folded to the properties drawer would do this, but it didn't work for me. And, as I already have a tag unique to these headlines, it would be great if I could trigger this based on the tag.\n Is there a way to run elisp code when an org file is first opened, specific to a file, with which I could do this? I suppose it could be done with a hook, but I would likely want code to be specific to a given file. (That is, I might have a similar-but-different need in the other files I'm yet to convert.)\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/rjray  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I've been using org mode for many years, pretty much since I started using emacs, and for all this time I've kept my notes in a single org file that grows as I add more notes.\n Recently I discovered denote, a young and excellent package to organize notes in files, and I have to say that I'm really enjoying it. However, it requires me to reorganize my long org file (which is good, after so many years growing out of control).\n I would like to ask, first of all, somebody with similar experiences, why did you decided to switch to denote? Or to stay with a long org file?\n The long org file works for me in a way that I simply come to the file and search for a particular word, so I can easily access all the results and choose the one I want. I don't even use tags, everything is organized in sectons using headers. How do you make that search easy in denote? I know that using keywords is the best but, assuming that sometimes you are not even 100% sure about the exact word that you need and you type in a few to try.\n On the other hand, small files work better for my mobile (where I sync my notes), specially with zettel notes app, which has similar organization than denote. However, I wonder if somebody has a good experience with a long org file with some particular app for android.\n I'm still trying to decide if switching to denote or staying with my long org file.

A month comes up where I need to reschedule this task to the 18th. Once the task is complete, I then have to remember that it usually occurs on the 17th and manually set it back to that date. \n A similar issue comes up when I have to change just the time of day of daily task while organizing my day.

So I figured I should just write my own view for todo items. Well, I couldnt find any documentation for that. I figured the only way is to go through the source code (which is a huge blob of a file that I'm not sure how to navigate efficiently) and hack my way into it (which may end up being incompatible with future versionsk break features, etc)\n Another example:\n I'd like to collect some data across all my org files. I don't see any \"org\" way to grab all my files, convert them to some sort of objects, and grab some data I need.

          "description": "I'm starting to use column view, and one thing I'd like to see is a column showing when any given captured item was created. Any ideas how to do this? \n FWIW, here's what I've tried so far.\n I had hoped that the Special Property, TIMESTAMP_IA would give me what I'm after, but I can't get that to work. So far I've tried:\n  \nRelying on the fact that I usually clock-in when capturing, and so the datum I want is almost always already there for me, in the form of the start time for the earliest clock entry. But TIMESTAMP_IA appears to ignore timestamps that are part of clock entries. So this is no use.\n Having my capture templates create a property drawer into which gets inserted a new property called CREATED, with value of %u. That does allow me to see the value in column view, but it is under %CREATED, not under %TIMESTAMP_IA.\n Same as #3, but instead of having the CREATED property inserted into the property drawer, insert it into my logbook drawer. That does let me see the value under %TIMESTAMP_IA but bizarrely it then does not display it under %CREATED. \n  \nSo either #2 or #3 could work, but I consider them to be non-ideal. \n With #2, I don't get to use the built-inTIMESTAMP_IA which I get the feeling is really intended for the kind of thing I'm trying to do. \n And while with #3, I do get to use TIMESTAMP_IA, it is at the expense of having to insert my CREATED property into a non-property drawer, which something in the back of my mind says is ill-advised. \n And of course with both #2 and #3, unnecessary duplication is involved since, as I said, the date I want is already staring me in the face in the starting stamp of the first clock entry. Having to go around creating properties for the sole purpose of duplicating and making available an otherwise unavailable variable is, well, naff.\n ​\n    submitted by    /u/TeeMcBee  \n [link]   [comments]",

The settings on my NAS don't seem to be the issue either.

          "description": "This question is not emacs-specific, but I have a feeling that this technical crowd might know a path forward given how customizable emacs is.\n My new work role requires me to spend even more time in email. We use Office 365 / Exchange for our work email, so the Outlook desktop client and the webmail interface is my default interface. Often times, I send an email to a recipient, and wait for their response. The chance that they respond is low, so I always have to send a follow up note. Take this and multiply by 100 threads, which takes up a lot of my time to stay on top of things.\n What I would like to do is set up my follow-up email, and have the note sent out on a certain date if I haven't heard back yet. If the person responds before the date, the pre-written note should never be sent and could be discarded. Outlook email rules and delay send feature does not allow for such a complex scenario.\n I am aware of the Boomerang app for Gmail and Outlook, but I don't think the cost is worth it; and I don't think corporate would allow me to install that add-in in Outlook.\n I looked into Thunderbird as it has a \"send later\" plugin that appears to have a scripting component, which could probably work. However, I'm unable to get my work mail account to work with Thunderbird. I could probably try some more to figure out why it isn't working.\n Question for the folks in this subreddit: is there a way to achieve the email rules I described using an email client in Emacs?

However, with the variable calendar-setup set to two-frames, it creates two new frames, one for the calendar and one for the diary.\n This isn't the only command like this, it's just an example, and it's not even the only one I might like to solve, since I face a similar problems with some gnus workflows I want to build, so please, no specific hacks to get this particular thing to work such as suggesting I not use calendar-setup set to two-frames, I really need a generalisable solution to this.\n So the issue is, if I launch emacsclient -e '(calendar)' from a shortcut or the command-line in order to bring up my calendar, this doesn't work unless there is a pre-existing emacsclient frame.\n The solution then would seem to be to issue either emacsclient -c -e '(calendar)' or emacsclient -r -e '(calendar)' in order to create a frame first.\n The problem is this creates a totally useless frame that is both annoying, but also problematic, because you can't close it if the calendar and diary frames aren't already closed.\n What I'd like is to be able to run (calendar) and have it create its frames without the need for a pre-existing frame. Or else in a really bad pinch, have the dummy frame created but totally hidden, and have it quit the moment I close the diary and calendar frames.\n Does anybody have any ideas?

See, I didn’t know this but whenever you refile, when it says getting all targets, it’s opening them up (at least it did in my ibuffer behind the scenes).\n To counter this, I asked an AI to help me, and it did. It wrote the code but it couldn’t get the last part right about not opening ibuffer to kill everything. I fixed that up myself. So this is a collaboration between an AI and me, but the code works.\n The only “issue” now is that if you have a lot of targets, it will take a few seconds each time to do the gathering part.

So I would like to be able to have my widget 'UI', and load the data from the yaml file interactively, so that I can save back to it as well.\n I've been trying to find the source code for the customize buffer in emacs, which does essentially what I want to do, but my grepping has been to no avail.\n    submitted by    /u/UnChilledIndividual  \n [link]   [comments]",

When higher versions are available from archives with lower priorities, the user has to select those manually.\n Archives not in this list have the priority 0, as have packages that are already installed. If you use negative priorities for the archives, they will not be upgraded automatically.\n  \nSince the version numbers of nongnu and melpa differ so widely, it seems as if there is no way to just set package archive priority such that it will default to nongnu\n Any advice?\n Suggestions on using melpa or not?\n Suggestions if using melpa how to get it to be used only when packages are not found in gnu or nongnu?\n    submitted by    /u/DenebianSlimeMolds  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "TL;DR - How do I incorporate backlink searches into my org-ql queries?\n ​\n I am re-structuring my notes to adapt to new demands. I really like the non-hierarchical approach where individual notes are org-mode headers (or files) with an ID property that I can simply link to.\n Org-ql is fantastic at querying org-mode headers, keeping dynamic blocks based on those queries, etc. Using org-ql, I can also query for links within a heading. What I am missing is the option to query for backlinks TO the heading. Has anyone solved this problem?\n ​\n Simple example:\n * Drug A :drug: :PROPERTIES: :ID: 12345 :END: This is an inhibitor of [[id:54321][Protein X]]. * Protein X :protein: :PROPERTIES: :ID: 54321 :END: This is a trans-membrane protein that is over-expressed in breast cancer. \n If I'm interested in the a subset of inhibitor drugs that are linked to Protein X I can do:\n [[org-ql-search:(and (rifle \"inhibitor\") (link \"Protein X\"))]] \n But what about finding trans-membrane proteins are associated with (i.e. \"backlinked to\") inhibitors?\n ​\n OR - maybe there is a way to use org-ql results as org-ql query inputs? For example: \n  \nQuery 1: pull out all drugs.\n Query 2: pull out all proteins.\n Query 3: identify all proteins (from Query 2) that have a backlink to drugs (from Query 1).\n  \n​\n I'm a bit stuck.

I've been using emacs for about a year, and even though you do learn by making your config, making a package gives you a waaay higher level of understanding, even if it's a basic one like mine.\n I tried to make the best code I could, but I'm no elisp/lisp programmer, but a C one, so probably the style isn't exactly right.

          "description": "Two of the first packages I setup in emacs when I began using it were projectile and perspective. I primarily use emacs as an IDE and wanted to be able to manage different projects. Google said these were good so I started there. Two months on and I still don't have a single perspective set and projectile feels like I'm using a semi truck to tow a hand cart. I've only not removed projectile because it integrates with tree-macs and I'm hoping to set it up so that I can have tree-macs display my list of folders when I'm not working on a project and only the project root of the current working directory when I'm in a python/c++ project. Tree-macs has a variable that allows you to set it to display a single directory and I'm wondering if that can be done with a .dir-local.el file, eliminating the one thing I think would make projectile worth having. I'd also like to exclude folders with .gitignore but again, I wonder if there is a way to do that with tree-macs or project.el.\n So, my question. What do you guys use perspective and projectile for. As a hobby programmer, do you think it's worth having? What are your thoughts on project.el and what else is out there?\n    submitted by    /u/Usual_Office_1740  \n [link]   [comments]",

I've tried looking for guides, but I haven't found information on how to structure the code of a coherent package.\n Particularly, it's been hard for me to keep track of the code in my mind because I'm using mostly plain functions and not many data structures. And the code is so far in one big file, which I don't know how to split up, as opposed to classes, which are more conceptually modular. How should I make my code more modular? How should I decide when I need to make a new function?\n If I need to visit and insert text into a buffer, should the visit and insert be done at the lowest, i.e. most nested, level possible? Or should I wrap the whole function body in a with-current-buffer?\n If I find myself needing to store a lot of data in variables, am I doing it wrong? I'm not using setq, because it seems like overkill and ugly being global, but even with let and let*, keeping track of what variables have been declared and their scope is getting difficult.\n Should I not declare as many variables and instead make monolithic functions where variable's aren't assigned, rather you just evaluate an expression (xyz) inside the expression you would pass the variable to, i.e. (abc (xyz)) instead of (setq var (xyz)) then (abc var)?

I sometimes lose track when I rebase feature branches with 20 commits onto another branch a couple of files and commits down the road. It's horrible.\n I usually can't make sense of M-x diff output. I often use smerge and 3-way diffing in git projects, that helps a bit to see things in context, but not always.\n For my stupid brain, this is an accessibility problem\n Here's the solution I have in mind: to tweak how diff tools show both sides so that the versions have more meaningful names.\n Exmaples:\n  \nMerging foo into main, it'd be nice if the label reads \"changes to be applied from foo\" and \"base from main\".\n Rabasing banana onto divergent recipes, with the shared ancestor main, it'd be great if it reads \"changes from banana\" and \"commonality from main\" and \"difference from main in recipes\".\n  \nIf you know a diff viewer, conflict resolution tool, whatever that allows this and how one might approach this, pointers would be appreciated!

Nice!.

But still can't find how to set that up. \n I might try pointing Rmail to the Maildir back up too, but just like IMAP, it is a one way conversion so I figured I would ask in case I destroy that synced copy for nothing :) \n Thank you!\n PS: I would try Maildir as describe here: https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Other-Mailbox-Formats.html\n    submitted by    /u/sebhoagie  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi all, I'm curious to get the opinion of the Emacs community on this issue, as basically all of my side projects revolve around Emacs package development.\n Background: I am looking to get away from GitHub for development. I would like something a little more in line with FOSS/Libre ideals.\n I've been on SourceHut for a while and I really like that there is 0 Javascript—it's fast, reliable, and has worked well so far. Trouble is, collaboration is a little trickier as it's all via mailing lists right now. I've appreciated learning about mailing lists and I have had some people collaborate with me on some software via email—so cool!—but I know this is a blocker for some people. Also, it's technically still in alpha; I know Prot recently left SourceHut due to some missing features, and I kind of look up to Prot's deliberate approach to all things development.\n An alternative I'm considering is Forgejo. (The Codeberg instance, specifically.) They seem to have similar goals in regards to free software and portability, but the workflow is much more PR-based, which is much more comfortable for many users.\n I'm curious to hear people's opinions on the two forges: where do you like developing software?

Like I still don't know how to set custom font for Emacs client or solaire mode doesn't work for some reason despite using themes that support it, not a big deal but it'd be nice to make them work. Now I'm thinking whether is it better to polish my current config so I have everything set up exactly how I want or to use some distribution that makes it all easier. I know it's pretty much matter of preferences, but it's hard to make a decision by myself not knowing what I miss from Doom/Spacemacs nor what trade-offs there are + I already have somehow functional config and I don't know if at this point making a switch is a right move.\n And, despite I'm ex hardcore Vim user I don't use evil-mode in Emacs (I mostly do program in Lisp languages in which Vim keybinding is just useless thanks to structural editing and paredit), but I know both of these distribution use evil-mode by default.

I'm wondering if there's a correct way to pass the file path as the last argument in the command. Has anyone encountered a similar issue or can provide insights on how to resolve it?\n Also I tested from the terminal of the WSL distro the command itself\n  cmd.exe /c start excel test.xlsx \n And it works properly.\n Any help would be greatly appreciated!\n Thank you.\n [1] https://emacsredux.com/blog/2021/12/19/wsl-specific-emacs-configuration/\n    submitted by    /u/AsterOps  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "ekg is a note taking package that is tag-based, and uses sqlite for storage. The new version 0.5.0 is out, featuring the following major changes:\n  \nInline tags! Now you can just add tags as you type, which I find very convenient. The tags are, in org-mode, turned into org-mode links, so those who like this style of having links in one note that enable \"backlinks\" will find this more familiar. The backlinks here are just the tag showing the notes that have the link to that tag.\n \nekg-auto-save, a module by Qingshui Zheng that let's you enable saving notes automatically as you write them, which works in a similar way to the emacs auto-save functionality. If you write longer notes, this should be useful.\n \nImprovements to org-mode notes. Because of the way our notes buffer works, it has metadata at the top which has read-only elements that interfere with org-mode. We now have some ability to narrow the buffer before the appropriate org-mode commands so that they work correctly. But this solution isn't perfect, and more work needs to be done. \n \nTrash simplification - I previously had the notion that trashing a note should trash the individual tags, prepending them all with \"trash/\". That idea never really panned out, and was adding too much complication, so now there's just a \"trash\" tag. If your note has that tag, it's in the trash.\n \nAborting a note. If you are capturing a note, save it as a draft, but then want to just abandon both the note and the draft, you can do that with C-c C-k. Also thanks to Qingshui Zheng!\n \nMany bug fixes.\n \n Demonstration: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKQB686SHQs\n    submitted by    /u/ahyatt  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm now trying to set up the daemon for emacs-macport.\n What I've gathered so far:\n - Opening emacs GUI and doing m-x start-server make the process be attached to that OS Window and, when it is closed, it all dies together.\n - running /opt/homebrew/opt/emacs-mac/Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS/Emacs --daemon gives me the terminal output I would expect when starting the daemon and a process, but when I try to emacsclient -cn, it opens a terminal emacs, not a GUI.\n Daemon start command output:\n Starting Doom Emacs in daemon mode!

Doom loaded 285 packages across 47 modules in 5.113s \n - when using the launchctl, as indicated in the wiki (with the modifications to emacs' path, and --fg-daemon), it starts the process with the same output as above. But, when trying to emacsclient -cn it gives me *ERROR*: Terminal type xterm-kitty is not defined. Doing export TERM=xterm does fix that, but it still opens a (rather very bugged) terminal frame.\n - Lastly, I tried creating an Emacs.app via Automator, but when invoked, it gives me the error could not get terminal name, which, I suppose, comes from the fact it is trying to open in a terminal, not GUI.\n TL;DR: It seems I've managed to open the server, but not to open a GUI frame.

Are there any others you'd like to be able to bookmark?\n Here are some ideas:\n  \noccur and grep buffers (jumping to the bookmark would rerun the search).\n \nREPLs. I can imagine this being useful: you bookmark a Python REPL and later jumping to the bookmark starts a new REPL and reruns all the import statements you had run before (or maybe just reruns everything?, or everything marked with a special comment?)\n \nshells. The eshell bookmarks are great, and that's what I use, but not everyone uses eshell. A shell bookmarker should preserve the current directory and whether you were ssh'ed into some other computer.\n \nShell command output buffers, the bookmarks should rerun the command.

This is just because I tend to have formatting outputs that don't have specific configuration for hs-minor-mode. hs-minor-mode seems like a good solution in general, but looks like it doesn't come with an obvious indentation-based level solution?\n I have used yafolding but in general I have found that I can't get yafolding-toggle-all to do something predictable. What it chooses to fold is never predictable to me.\n Any solution using hs-minor-mode?\n    submitted by    /u/sausagefeet  \n [link]   [comments]",

And I have a function which runs (previous-line) (beginning-of-line 1) and said function is bound to a key (let's say <up>).\n So I apply a text-property of 'invisible using (pos-bol) of the first line and (1+ (pos-eol)) in order to get the first line to disappear, like it's not even there.\n If I'm on line 3 and M-: my function, it does what I'd expect and (point) will return the (pos-bol) of the second line. But, if I execute my function by pressing <up> from line 3, (point) keeps returning back 1, the point of the beginning of line 1 rather than the point at the beginning of line 2.\n Is this expected behavior? I'd be less weirded out if running code through M-: gave back similar results but I get what I'd expect to happen no matter what code I run and only the unexpected behavior when running the exact same code via a key binding.\n This seems to happen even when running Emacs with -Q. Also occurs when I try with (backward-char) and C-b: so long as it's the first line – at the top of the buffer – which is invisible, there's a difference between executing code by itself vs. via key commands (with the latter putting me at point 1, every time).\n    submitted by    /u/blah1998z  \n [link]   [comments]",

Coding, reading, writing, RSS, ToDos, knowledge base, website, music etc.\n So, I'm juggling Emacs on a bunch of different setups: a Linux machine with Ubuntu at home, a RHEL workstation and a node I ssh into at work, a MacOS laptop, a few Raspberry Pis. You see where this is going. Each has different uses, but some core things that I like to keep consistent.\n With the mix of OSX, Ubuntu, RHEL, plus the GUI and TTY variations, I need to change my Emacs config on every machine (even though a lot stays the same across the board).\n The real headache starts when I change something on one machine, and I want to apply that to all (or some) of the other machines. Yak shaving and all...\n Right now, my setup's built around an init.el that loads up a settings.org file, which has my literate config. The way I deal with some things (for example, remapping key bindings on MacOS) is by wrapping it up with conditionals. But it's looking quite ugly and is more annoying to maintain.\n I wonder what the best approach here is. Split my config into multiple files and load them as needed depending on where I am? Maybe mess around with Git branches for different setups? (And how would I even start with that?) Git submodules?\n Are there some tools that already deal with this? I am sure this is not an Emacs-only problem.\n Thanks in advance and would love to hear how you deal with this :)\n    submitted by    /u/I3lind5pot  \n [link]   [comments]",

How about 450 and 140? \n Consider donating: https://magit.vc/donate/\n    submitted by    /u/Heikkiket  \n [link]   [comments]",

For example I have a tasks note that displays all my open tasks. And I have a homelab note, that lists all ideas and tasks with the metadata \"subject:: homelab\" under headings for ideas and tasks. Also the list of completed tasks in the daily note is auto populated with tasks that have the completed date set to today.\n Now I'm trying to do something similar with org-roam. \n TL;DR: I want to query my org-roam notes for specific data that is marked with metadata and display it in other notes\n Thank you!\n    submitted by    /u/ZunoJ  \n [link]   [comments]",

I couldn't fathom platformIO in emacs, fell back on VSCode on linux (which threw a bunch of errors) and ended up using VSCode in Windows.\n I may be wrong, but I feel if I can start just one project in emacs (probably editing something on a remote machine) then everything will click?\n Any tips on where to begin?\n    submitted by    /u/thephatmaster  \n [link]   [comments]",

Maybe some of can weigh in on which path is \"worth\" following.\n Basically, i come from vim and neovim. I've worked with emas and neovim in parallel for years now. I generally enjoy the \"regular\" emacs keybindings for UI stuff. But i feel like i'm lossing a LOT of editing power when leaving evil behind. Yet, getting it to work consistently is a bunch of work and it'll always be 99% at best.\n Now the relevant part. I'm pretty sure i've only scratched the surface of emacs native keybinds. What i find missing is \"simple\" stuff like \"delete between paranthesis\" or \"duplicate this line\". Is this something emacs can \"just do\" and i just haven't found it yet?\n I see 2 ways forward:\n  \nStick with evil and invest the time to create consistent remaps where evil-collection and others don't quite do it.\n Stick to emacs and remap/write functionality i'm missing from vim\n  \nNote that ergonomics are a secondary thought. I have a custom keyboard so arrow keys are still on hjkl and modifiers are on thumbkeys. I'm also not married to the idea of modal editing. In fact, i enjoy not having to worry about modes and just \"type away\". But deleting/changing a specified area is just something i haven't found a good solution in emacs to.\n So, thoughts? Is what i'm missing from emacs just there and i need to find it, or am i better of investing fully into evil and making that work?\n    submitted by    /u/domsch1988  \n [link]   [comments]",

This was the moment where I put myself in trouble.\n Firstly, I was really productive on macOS and using the CMD key in combination with the arrows to move around on the line, quickly select and all of that. These are the moves that I'm missing more on, coming back to Linux. The need to use a Home and End key to do the same thing is killing my productivity, mainly due to the fact there is no dedicated key to do that on my laptop keyboard or on the Keychron K6.\n On my Mac I used to use VS…",

          "description": "Probably it's been asked many times, still, I'm not sure which way should I go.\n I'm hungarian, and my solution to write hungarian in emacs (which I have barely done) was that I just simply typed \"auoeiuo\" instead of \"áúüű....\".\n Lately I started to have the need to write text for others, so using the correct vowels with \"umlauts\" became needed more and more often. It would be amazing if I could just simply switch layout and go on with my life not fighting with my muscle memory. Most often I still use us layout, not only because of the shortcuts, but also typing special characters like \\, [], etc... on hungarian layout really a pain in the ass. On hungarian layout I will almost never use any \"programming characters\", I'm pretty sure.\n The problem I have for example is that \"C-_\" is \"C-Ü\" or \"C-y\" is \"C-z\" on hungarian layout, which doesn't work anymore. I don't want to learn different combinations, neither fighting my muscle memory every time when once a week I want to write some longer hungarian text in emacs.\n I have a feeling that there could be a trick that any time i'm using a different layout, (and probably I should also put a condition that I'm in txt mode for not mess up things like dired or magit), emacs would interpret my keystrokes differently when I hold down C or M. So I would use the same key for typing a single \"ü\" and \"C-_\" for example.\n What could be the simplest way to set up emacs like that? Can you post me a link where it's already answered? I'm pretty sure it's been answered a couple of times, I'm just too stupid to find it.\n Thank you!\n    submitted by    /u/paadam94  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "When typing up some long-form text for entry into a website, I'll sometimes do it first in Org mode and then once I'm happy with it I'll copy-paste it into whatever I'm using. \n However, one issue is that of <NEWLINE>.\n On the one hand, web forms often want to handle line wrapping, and so it wants the user to insert <NEWLINE> characters only if really necessary; e.g. for between paragraphs, list items, and so on.\n But on the other hand, I have Org set up to auto-fill text input (and I'll also regularly give it a hand in that using M-q to run org-fill-paragraph), so I end up with <NEWLINE> characters all over the place.\n Now obviously I could just turn off emacs and Org's auto-fill for the purpose of these situations. But I don't want that. I actually *want* the Org text formatted with the auto-fills, just as it would be if I wasn't creating something for input on the web.\n So, is there a simple way (maybe using export? ) to have the newlines that are not needed (I'm thinking it's only newlines within a paragraph) replaced with what is almost certainly going to be a simple inter-word space? Note , though, that it isn't just going to be the newline that needs to go, but also any following indenting whitespace characters used to correctly position the next piece of text.\n For example, I'd like to have this:\n  1. A line of text 2. Another line of text but this one is long enough to need to be wrapped. And notice that this portion is indented.  converted to:  1. A line of text 2.

          "description": "Hi everyone, I've been trying for the past month or so to get Emacs working reliably and quickly on my High DPI linux machines, but have been struggling.\n Currently I am running into issues with a machine running Manjaro + GNOME (wayland) and the pgtk version of emacs 29.1. When I scale the frame to take up the entirety of my 4k display, I have noticeable input lag, likely in the 100s of ms. When I shrink the frame down, my input lag decreases significantly, and emacs feels snappy. The issue persists when I run emacs with emacs -q.\n At the moment I've resorted to running emacs 29.1 without pgtk, forcing it to run under XWayland. This causes emacs to render at a lower resolution to XWayland, resulting in blurry text when it's finally displayed on my monitor, but results in emacs staying snappy even at full screen.\n I've run into this issue across all my machines, across distros (namely Void, Arch, and Fedora), whenever I try to run Emacs full screen on a 4K monitor attached to a machine running Wayland. Switching to X isn't an option due to the excessive screen tearing that I get at high resolutions.\n Weirdly, compiling and running Emacs on my Windows work machine natively results in the best emacs experience I've had so far, with input feeling extremely snappy and fluid. I don't experience the scaling issues there. Emacs also is working fantastic on an old low resolution laptop that I have running Void with XFCE.\n I've tried adjusting the double buffering as mentioned in this post without success: https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/zgp6kw/gui_emacs_weird_the_bigger_the_frame_size_is_the/\n Any thoughts? Is this a thing that people are running into on high resolution displays with Wayland? Is XWayland the best bet right now?\n    submitted by    /u/sunmoi  \n [link]   [comments]",

However, it requires me to reorganize my long org file (which is good, after so many years growing out of control).\n I would like to ask, first of all, somebody with similar experiences, why did you decided to switch to denote? Or to stay with a long org file?\n The long org file works for me in a way that I simply come to the file and search for a particular word, so I can easily access all the results and choose the one I want. I don't even use tags, everything is organized in sectons using headers. How do you make that search easy in denote? I know that using keywords is the best but, assuming that sometimes you are not even 100% sure about the exact word that you need and you type in a few to try.\n On the other hand, small files work better for my mobile (where I sync my notes), specially with zettel notes app, which has similar organization than denote. However, I wonder if somebody has a good experience with a long org file with some particular app for android.\n I'm still trying to decide if switching to denote or staying with my long org file.

By playing with the frontmatter I could include the date of each meeting. Further, I think I would use the signature fucntions to ensure that the notes are displayed in calendar order.\n Has someone else solved this kind of problem?

Why don't more packages simply rebind existing (fundamental) functions instead of invent/make us bind new keys?\n I am exploring vertigo/consult (currently ivy/counsel user) and it striked me how friendly transition to vertgo was in terms of keys.

I use org-tangle for my literate emacs config, org-export for producing PDFs and HTML, and a variation of org-export MD for producing my Hugo blog posts.

I wish this weren't so.\n  When tangling, COMMENT on a heading (shortcut key #) is skipped. I don't know if this omits things from org-agenda.\n  When marked with :ARCHIVE:, lines are skipped in org-agenda.

          "description": "Hi, I'm relatively new to Emacs (28) and spent the holidays configuring it to be a nice environment for machine learning applications and writing Latex/org-mode markup. Loving it so far.\n However, one thing I wish I could change is the major modes for C, C++, Python, and Shell languages. I tend to get really overwhelmed by how many options are provided because of the maturity of these languages and it's hard for me to really learn their features even with which-key installed. Another sticking point is that they sometimes overwrite custom keybinds that I use frequently, especially c-mode.\n Is there such a thing as a general purpose coding major mode that just provides syntax highlighting with tree-sitter, code folding, and Eldoc info for each language? Maybe this is something that would be easy to hack up by extending prog-mode with only those features?\n Barring that, is there a way to help simplify the major modes like not overriding my global keymap? I have a difficult time with mental context switching and want to only need to think about my basic keybinds and org stuff.\n    submitted by    /u/non_petplay_account  \n [link]   [comments]",

Installing the package itself is easy; however, installing the `jdtls` lsp is proving to be difficult. \n Since it is on a work laptop, I cannot provide log messages. My first issue was when the script that LSP runs to install jdtls failed to install due to cert issues. I was able to fix those, but I ran into error `java.security.InvalidAlgorithmParameterException: the trustAnchors parameter must be non-empty`. I tried fixing the cert store, but no luck.\n The next thing I tried was doing `brew install jdtls`. I tried setting `lsp-java-server-install-dir` to the install location of the jdtls binary; however, that also did not work. For some reason, LSP cannot find the `jdtls` in my path, even though it's available globally on my system. FWIW, I am using package exec-path-from-shell, and it's properly configured (other packages that depend on external tools work just fine). \n I was wondering if anyone has had any luck getting lsp-java to work on Mac, especially if you went the `brew install jdtls` route.

The ellama package already does this, but what this adds is the ability to see a diff, ask for further changes (in context of the previous changes) and accept the diff.\n My goal is to produce a bunch of these demos and figure out the necessary library functions to do these things in a clean, consistent, and useful way. Perhaps I'd add them to the `llm` package, perhaps it might require a new package. In emacs-devel@ I wrote up details, including code pointers and a list of interesting questions I'm thinking about. I'm posting this here as well because I think there's interest on what I'm demoing, and I'd appreciate feedback on it, especially from a user perspective.\n https://i.redd.it/ehvgzra651ec1.gif\n    submitted by    /u/ahyatt  \n [link]   [comments]",

There is a tab called \"Partner Connect\" that offers \"connection files\" for many Databricks partner companies, but the ones I'm able to access don't contain the information emacs-jupyter seems to want. Some aren't even JSON.\n So, yeah. Any advice?\n    submitted by    /u/sauntcartas  \n [link]   [comments]",

The general #image  becomes → #uiimage on iOS, #nsimage on macOS, which are actual types in the macOS API.\nI removed the topic tag #appkit which doesn't tell me anything interesting here.\nWhy is the object tag #appkit useless now? Almost all my programming notes are about macOS and thus #appkit, the macOS UI API framework. So it doesn't help find anything, and it'd produce so many notes that it becomes useless. Thousands, if applied consistently!\nThere are notes about the AppKit framework as a topic. These stay put, of course!\nThe thing is: for my very first notes on programmatic image manipulation, it sounded sensible to use a tag like #image.  After all, I did not expect to need specificity here at all: \"something with image in Appkit\" sounded good. But with expertise, I need NSImage-related resources, and I can name contexts better. Like embedding images in text views, as wirh The Archive \nAll notes are malleable, so no problem.\nBy the way, new notes on similar topics I tag with the very specific API titles right away, e.g. #nsimage for image stuff on Mac. This changed in the past couple of years and I don't have to think about this, at all. I believe it felt similar back when I used the \"\"\"bad\"\"\" tag. So chances are I could discover even more specific tags in the future and find the current one lacking   At the moment, it's the best topic tag I know to describe this.",

I'm a Software Engineer(web dev, full stack) by profession.\nI discovered Zettelkasten in 2020 when I started working on a rather large personal project called MindOS. I was trying to create content in the intersection of philosophy, psychology, programming and rationality. During the research phase, I understood that it was going to be impossible to keep all of this in my mind - even with the note taking method that I used at that stage. I needed a better system.\nThis search led me to Zettelkasten, and I immediately fell in love with it! Since then I have actively trying to encourage others to use it as well. To do this, I have written tutorials, videos, created a couple of tools, etc. But my biggest and most resent contribution is a book I wrote and published a few months back: Zettelkasten and the Art of Knowledge Management.\nMy Zettelkasten Process...\nI have 2 vaults. Everything I learn that is useful for others go into Obsidian - and I publish it as a Digital Garden at https://notes.binnyva.com\nAll my personal information goes into a Logseq graph. This includes...\nJournals\nProject Management\nFleeting notes\nand the kitchen sink ;-)",

This is in itself neither new nor exciting, since it would be a repetition of the marketing babble already existing in the domain of knowledge management.\nMy take will be to highlight the steps of the causal mechanism how the benefit is created. There is a lot of talk about that the Zettelkasten gives you a certain set of benefits, sometimes a blurry idea of the how. There is a lack of explicitness and precision. This is what I am going for.\nSo, my request is for you: Give me every benefit you can think of. Being it a benefit that you want to be justified or rejected. Being it a benefit that you experienced.

It seems impervious to market forces and cannot interact with them. It wants to negate virtually every front-page headline in the paper of record and other carefully edited organs of filtered pablum. Other than that, there is no interaction. Attempts to optimize it only make it worse and more convoluted than otherwise.
