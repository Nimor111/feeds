The idea is instead to work backwards from those statistical models and tweak the physical parameters until something approximating the real game of football emerges. I hope that this approach sets the simulation up for success as the application of data and analysis to football evolves and better statistical measures of success become increasingly available.\n Motivation\n There are clearly a number of existing football simulation games that are wildly more advanced and capable than this simple hobby project.

More background information here. The recent \"Ask Me Anything\" session with the CEO of Reddit didn't really address the concerns of people, and some subreddits decided that they would shutdown indefinitely.\n I think /r/haskell as a community should be discussing what action to take. On a personal level, this subreddit is pretty dear to me, as it has been my go-to place to keep up to date with the Haskell news over the years, and has been an invaluable source of information when I first started learning the language. So I guess my (kind of open-ended) question is: what is the stance of /r/haskell regarding the events happening on the broader Reddit? I am aware that a bunch of communities are migrating to some federated, open-source alternatives, most popular being Lemmy. Would us as a community consider such a mass exodus? The admin of functional.cafe, a Mastodon instance for the FP community, has recently been gauging interest in spinning up a Lemmy instance, maybe some arrangement could be made through cooperative effort?\n I have created this thread to hopefully seed some useful discussion surrounding these. I am looking forward to hear what the community thinks in general.\n    submitted by    /u/lonelymonad  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I've been coding in Haskell for over 6 years and I still feel as if the lack of dot completion (i.e. completion after typing identifier. in the code editor) is the single thing I miss most compared to mainstream languages. In Haskell I find myself constantly jumping to type definitions, searching for documentation, or even grepping the project to recall the name of a function, when in (say) Rust or Typescript I could type foo. and have the editor show me what I need 90% of the time.\n Edit: Here's a concrete example. I was working on some code with a variable vec :: Vector Int and needed to split it into two vectors based on some predicate. I recall that there is a function for doing exactly this, but can't remember the name. In Haskell this is a situation where I usually find myself Googling for the Data.Vector documentation on Hackage. In other languages I would just type vec. and scan through the completion options to find what I need. This sort of thing happens many times per day and I feel like it makes a big difference in productivity.\n    submitted by    /u/polarbearwithagoatee  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I've been looking for a while, but I haven't been able to find \"good\" resources on utilizing laziness effectively in practical Haskell.\n ​\n There's Hutton's explanation in Programming in Haskell, Bird actually seems to go quickly into laziness (chapters 1,2 of Thinking Functionally With Haskell), but I haven't seen anything like, say, a Serokell article on how to manage laziness in practical terms.\n ​\n Maybe I'm just not trying hard enough? What I'm looking for is:\n --Laziness beyond the lazy infinite list (that's just an iterator / generator function with better syntax).\n --How to effectively exploit laziness to improve algorithmic efficiency.\n --How to avoid space leaks mostly reliably.\n --When space leaks occur, best practices in locating and debugging them.\n ​\n I do have Okasaki (Purely Functional Data Structures) and Bird (Algorithm Design with Haskell), but I haven't seriously gone through them. Are those books sufficient to master laziness / non-strictness to go from \"laziness is a 60-40 double-edged sword\" to \"laziness works for me 90+% of the time\"?\n ​\n \n ​\n It matters because, well, you have firms that deliberately choose a strict dialect of Haskell (SC, Mu), you have firms that go to -XStrict by default (NRI, Key.me), and, well, Purescript is strict, Idris is strict; Haskell is rare in making non-strict / lazy evaluation its default, and as functional programming becomes increasingly mainstream, Haskell's main long-term selling point will be its experiment with lazy-by-default.\n ​\n However, lazy-by-default is best known for the resulting space leaks, not for its expressiveness advantages. For I myself, I'd like to have a list of resources to understand how to get pervasive laziness not to screw me, but rather be a useful tool, and I think it'd be useful to be able to redirect skeptics and newbies to a laziness resource list.\n    submitted by    /u/Instrume  \n [link]   [comments]",

They enhance testability, modularity, and composability, leading to more maintainable and scalable codebases. In this article, we'll explore the syntax and semantics of functional applications and introduce the app-toolkit library—a powerful tool for building functional applications more efficiently.\n Syntax and Semantic of an App\n At its core, an app can be represented as a function that takes an input (I) and produces an output (O). By incorporating side effects, we extend this representation to I => F[O], where F[_] denotes the ability to handle side effects.\n Resources\n To build an app, we rely on resources such as app information, input arguments, a logger, and configuration settings.\n With t…",

Currently I do just about everything in Python, SQL with a sprinkle of R. I know some Scala 2, Java and C++ as well. To me, Scala always felt like the ideal marriage of having a great type system and not having the annoying things you'd associate from static typing.\n I think the pessimism hurts adoption as folk like myself become skeptical. That's sad because at least in theory the language does exactly what people like me need: a pragmatic yet principled way to make software. Scala 3, especially, looks flexible enough for scripting and interactive stuff with for example polynote. Type safety also reduces the footguns compared to Python.\n It won't deter me, I'll keep on going but at the very least I wanted to share my thoughts.\n    submitted by    /u/Odd-One8023  \n [link]   [comments]",

As I delve into the ZIO documentation and source code, I feel like I'm missing a few pieces to fully grasp how they fit together. I'd greatly appreciate your insights in helping me form a complete picture.\n ​\n In the `ZIO[R, E, A]` effect, the type parameter `R` is referred to as the environment type or the ZIO environment of type `R`. The ZIO environment can be constructed by composing ZLayers. By using accessor methods provided by the ZIO datatype, we can access the ZIO environment of a specific type to execute the effect.\n ​\n Here's where I am seeking clarification: Is it correct to say that ZIO constructs the ZIO environment of the required type `R` from the ZIO environment built by composing the layers? The ZIO environment constructed from the layers will have a different type, but ZIO effects need a specific ZIO environment of a particular type.\n ​\n Furthermore, I am curious about the role of ZEnvironment in all of this. How does it fit into the overall picture?\n ​\n I am grateful for any insights or explanations you can provide to help me better understand these concepts and their interactions.\n ​\n Thank you in advance!\n    submitted by    /u/Sensitive_Network497  \n [link]   [comments]",

Currently, there are two simple client-side engines available: a simple imperative, and a ZIO-Based.\n A proof-of-concept RPC system is also available. You can declare a trait for a service, and macros will generate a stub for the client (ScalaJS) app and dispatcher code for the server side. In the examples, this is used to implement a TODO app with server-side storage.\n Components, Models, and Channels are identified by IDs, which are currently auto-incremented. This isn't entirely functional. I've experimented with other ideas, like creating IDs via a State-Monad, but they ended up being less practical.\n I'd love to hear your thoughts on this.\n    submitted by    /u/dernob  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I decided to integrate some GoJS code into a PureScript Halogen application. I have some funding to do this, so it's not just a hobbyist project (though it started that way).\n Creating the Halogen components would be simple enough if one takes inspiration from gojs-react. The issue is that there are no PureScript bindings for the GoJS types themselves, but GoJS does provide .ts.d declarations, which means I could use purescript-read-dts, but that library's maturity/usability seems somewhat ambiguous, according to an author's post from 3 years ago.\n Conceptually I'm thinking of generating the bindings, trying to call the code from just PureScript, and adjusting the bindings manually for implicitly effectful computations. I'm not an experienced PureScript (or Javascript really) developer so I'm wondering what the community thinks of such a project. I know it's big.\n    submitted by    /u/amuricys  \n [link]   [comments]",

Your TODO's all have at least one, but possibly more, tags. Those tags are \"Work\", \"School\", \"Personal\", \"Spouse\", \"Home\", and \"Fun\", for example. At the end of the year, you want to know how you divided your time. Is there an easy way to produce output like this:\n  \nWork - 30\n School - 28\n Personal - 24\n Spouse - 20\n Home - 17\n Fun - 11\n  \nExample #2 - Avg Time\n You spend a year completing tasks. At the end of that year, is there an easy way to display how long tasks took to complete?

But have been thinking about Org mode for a while now for both my personal notes and work notes.\n Generally, I'm assigned to a project/client for a period of time. I have thought about creating an org folder in home then a org/client for the client or project then something like: - meetings.org for meetings and calls - notes.org for client or project specific notes - tickets.org for any sort of ticketing system they use to help keep track of those without having to login to the ticket system.\n TODOs would of course roll up to Org Agenda.\n More general notes would be in the main Org file.\n Any tips or thoughts on how to manage a similar workflow? Open to ideas.\n I would setup some capture templates to make it easier to add data to these. Maybe even org-roam at some point.\n I would have to start small and expand as I go. Just working on thinking through the mental model.

A common use for me on these is for meetings. I drop the meeting on my calendar but capture it with a \"meeting\" capture template that clocks the meeting and I just notate my meeting notes within. \n To accomplish this I have a top level heading called Reminders and under that I store them:\n If its a one off I use the <2023-06-08 Thu 14:30> type of active timestamp so it shows on the agenda.\n If it is a recurring I use the following which I found online. the 3 means to show every 3rd day of the week. (1 2 3 4 5) would show mon-fri etc. \n ** Weekly Marketing Meeting 11:00-12:00 :Reminder: <%%(memq(calendar-day-of-week date) '(3))> \n My one off reminder capture template uses %^T to prompt for and insert an active date+time which works perfectly. \n I try to include this snippet of text in my capture template where I can just manually update the days I want the reminder to trigger for recurring ones like so\n (\"!\" \"recurring reminder\" entry (file \"~/Orgfiles/refile.org\") \"* %? :REMINDER:\\n %U\\n <%%(memq (calendar-day-of-week date) '(1 2 3 4 5))> \n \\n%a\\n%i\" :empty-lines 1)\n However when I run the capture I get this output\n  <%%![Error: (void-variable date)]> \n Ideally I'd love to use a prompt for \"which days to repeat\" where I could input 1 3 5 and get a m/w/f repeater output into the entry. \n I'm still learning so this might be really simple elisp issue creating the erorr and void variable situation here. \n ​\n    submitted by    /u/timmymayes  \n [link]   [comments]",

(rather than us all griping about Slack... =] I'm not a fan of the tool, but feel most of its problems are around the way people use it, rather than the tool itself — despite the discourse and twist folks trying to convince me to give those a go at my company. =] ).\n    submitted by    /u/wakatara  \n [link]   [comments]",

Its primary features are:\n  \nThe names of process buffers can be customized on a per-command basis; for example, the buffer name for the command ls -la can be automatically set to *shell:ls*, *shell:ls -la*, or any other number of desired values.\n \nWhen a command completes, its output buffer can emulate special-mode; this is useful for quickly dismissing (with quit-window) or quickly re-running the command (with revert-buffer).\n \nWhen a command completes, the point can be moved to the beginning of the output buffer if the command wasn't interactive; this is useful for paging through the output of commands like grep --help.\n \n The project readme also contains some tips and tricks for a smoother experience. The goal of the package is essentially to make shell buffers display when and where you want them, depending on the kinds of commands you run, and for those buffers to behave more like native special emacs buffers like help-mode.\n    submitted by    /u/elizadev  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "So my post isn't meant to bash on Magit, but rather I am trying to understand what kind of issues people had with the git CLI that made them love Magit. \n I remember before entering the world of emacs, people would say the two packages that would change your life would be Magit and org-mode. I have been using emacs for a few months now and I can safely say that I never use org-mode and still use the git CLI as I find it faster. Really the package that I felt was unique and made me stick with emacs was Tramp. The ability to open a remote file in an instant, with no subscription fee (looking at you Jetbrains) and without it interfering with my workflow was amazing.\n Now I am a young adult (~26yr) and am still early in my career as a software engineer so maybe I am just ignorant, but really the only git commands I use are git diff, status, pull, push branch and merge. And honestly in my bubble of using git, Magit is not really that much different than just using the CLI. Heck in the terminal I can even create aliases and chain commands with && which is even faster.\n Are there git commands that I don't know about that feel horrible or are the projects and responsibilities I deal with still small enough that I do not see the downfalls of using the CLI for much larger projects?\n TLDR: What aspects of Magit make it a better experience for version control than just using git in the terminal?\n EDIT: I want to thank each and everyone that replied. It seems that the way I commit code (multiple files at a time) is super elementary and for better debugging and readability people actually commit specific LINES of code not even files, which Magit in unmatched for. I learned a lot of new tools in this post specifically ediff and git bisect which I had not heard off. I plan to take these lessons forward in my career. I apologize if was not able to reply to everyone but I do promise I read your message. Thanks again.\n    submitted by    /u/JoeKazama  \n [link]   [comments]",

Inside the .projectile files there is a +/../common line to include the common dir when looking for project files.\n The three project dirs include a compile_commands.json that also knows how to compile files in the common dir.\n Each project may set different defines or compiler flags to compile common code.\n Now I have two problems:\n - if I open a file inside project_a and then try to open a file in common with C-p f it switches to a new project root and from now on common is a project on its own (probably because it detects a git repo?)\n - if I jump to a symbol inside project_a defined in common, new project root again, clangd looks for compile_commands.json inside it, doesn't find it and fails to resolve symbols.\n I want each project to behave like a single one including common dir both in project navigation and in clangd.\n Any idea?

          "description": "A while ago I posted about how I was changing light and dark themes in Emacs. I wanted to provide an update, as it has changed a bit. \n I am now using the top-right menu on Gnome to enable and disable dark mode. However, old GTK3 applications do not \"see\" this setting at all.\n To solve this problem I am using:\n  \nPython script that monitors dbus and changes the GTK theme when selecting dark\n Systemd unit to ensure the script is running all time\n Emacs snippet to react to this change\n  \nWith this setup, having Emacs complied with pure GTK, changing the dark mode on gnome triggers a theme change, while the script triggers a change on the frame decoration. It sounds hacky, but the transition is very smooth and seamless.\n Also, this new code, makes sure that only one theme is configured in Emacs, as having multiple themes selected might be problematic, if themes change different settings.\n (use-package dbus :init (defun theme-switcher (value) ;; 0 = No Preference ;; 1 = Prefers dark ;; 2 = Prefers light. Not currently used by Gnome (let* ((dark-theme 'ef-dark) (light-theme 'ef-frost) (new-theme (if (= value 1) dark-theme light-theme)) (switch?

Biggest thing holding me off from switching are the Keybindings. Just Moving the cursor is already such a strech. I've installed Evil mode but you have to configure it with every other plugin and often end up with doubled behaviour and not everything working as expected. It's still very hacky and i'm not sute if i should be using it.\n My Question is if i should just commit to the default binding? I've heard that they are subjectively bad and cause pinky strain and don't allow a fast workflow, and i can see that being the case. But maybe it just comes down to practice.\n Any of you had the same experience coming from Vim? Who uses the default bindings?

Here is an example from customize-face:\n https://i.imgur.com/KdaaC2J.png\n I speculate this happens because the default colours now assume 256-colour terminal, and indeed if I switch to 256 colours in the terminal emulator the settings look readable:\n https://i.imgur.com/dE2jUCv.png\n The question is how do I easily revert to earlier settings from Emacs 27?

However, they don't work when the file is linked as an attachment, which makes me think that there may be a better way to achieve this. \n ​\n The org-display-inline-images function uses some functions and variables from image.el such as image-file-name-regexp and create-image to respectively check if the file is an image and to create the image descriptor to display it inline.\n The packages above (except org-yt which is more general) kind of work the same way: there is a project binary file (e.g. .xopp) that gets converted to an image format such as .png and .svg and then it gets displayed inline.\n Would it be possible to define a custom image handler (e.g. for .xopp) that would work exactly the same as, let's say, .png, except that it performs a conversion (.xpp -> .png) before actually handling it?

In Doom, it's provided by a package called vertico. Then other packages provide fuzzy matching in vertico.\n To get out from M-x I had to press Escape 3 times. And this is without bringing up how unintuitive the keybindings are (like moving around).\n Emacs could do with much needed polish. Without Doom Emacs (and its configuration) and the amazing packages people provide, I don't think I could use Emacs.\n It's no wonder Emacs isn't really brought up in conversation. I would like to see improvements in usability. It needs built-in quality-of-life improvements to be more accessible to people. Emacs being extremely powerful and extensible means nothing if the average person isn't able to use that to their benefit.\n I hope I didn't come across as too criticising; I do love Emacs and spend most of my day in it.

Ledger is great, but required to create transactions in ledger. Struggled with parsing bank/card pdfs, manually creating entries and nothing worked. Eventually realized that I can just copy the text from pdf into emacs and then format it using emacs macros. Then next task was to convert the transaction lines into ledger entries. This gave birth to `ob-ledger-convert` or `ob-lc` to provide `lc` src blocks in the org mode which when executed convert the given transactions into ledger format. It does need parsers and I have provided some of the parsers used by me in the `ob-lc` module. New parsers can be added easily.\n This post is to share the enthusiasm of the emacs being such a fascinating machine which lets you do anything you want and also to get the feedback from the community on the package.\n The sample org file provided in the repo provides a gist of how to use the module.\n ob-ledger-convert: jayrajput/ob-ledger-convert: Convert anything to ledger in emacs org babel (github.com) \n ​\n    submitted by    /u/redmango2022  \n [link]   [comments]",

Clients for Office365 are particularly annoying with the new Oauth2 system; an app has to be trusted by Microsoft which pretty much means that all open source clients are unusable unless one has admin control over the Azure environment.\n After some pointless struggle, I decided to just rely on my local MacOS calendar app to handle all the authentication and to sync my calendars.

But it has turned out that something as simple as a high contrast theme with a pure white background and black text is beyond my abilities. \n For some reason, M-x set-background-color white sets the background to gray when running emacs in a terminal. Even setting the background color to #ffffff results in a gray background (and in me shouting frustrated at the monitor). I can get pure white with xemacs, but I'm mostly working on our development servers remotely over slow ssh connections, so xemacs is out of the equation. \n Of the standard themes, whiteboard comes closest, but is also gray background, smudged and hard to read on e-ink. Literally every light theme I've downloaded has been some variant of smudgy yellow, gray or teal for the background. Grayish text on grayish background is virtually illegible on e-ink. \n I found an \"e-ink\" theme here: https://emacsthemes.com/themes/eink-theme.html. This gets me black text on a white background... mixed with white text on a white background (#includes and other syntax highlighting), so also not useable. \n Can it really be that difficult to get real black text on real white background? What is the obvious thing I'm missing? I'm happy to have some syntax highlighting in (dark) gray, but the main text needs to be pure black, and most importantly the background should be actual white. \n Please help, my inability to get something so trivial to work is hurting my self-esteem!\n    submitted by    /u/jimmyriba  \n [link]   [comments]",

However, it is hard to know which alternative defaults will be better.\n Emacs devs need help from users to obtain real-world data about Emacs garbage collection. See the discussion in https://yhetil.org/emacs-devel/87v8j6t3i9.fsf@localhost/\n I wrote a small package https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/emacs-gc-stats.html that will collect garbage collection stats during Emacs sessions. Please, install it and later (after few weeks) submit the results to emacs-gc-stats@gnu.org\n Usage:\n Add\n (require 'emacs-gc-stats) (setq emacs-gc-stats-gc-defaults 'emacs-defaults) ; optional (emacs-gc-stats-mode +1) \n to your init file to enable the statistics acquiring.\n When you are ready to share the results, run M-x emacs-gc-stats-save-session and then share the saved emacs-gc-stats-file (defaults to ~/.emacs.d/emacs-gc-stats.eld) by sending an email attachment to <mailto:emacs-gc-stats@gnu.org>.\n You can use M-x emacs-gc-stats-clear to clear the currently collected session data.\n The following data is being collected after every command:\n  \n GC settings gc-cons-threshold and gc-cons-percentage\n  Emacs version and whether Emacs framework (Doom, Prelude, etc) is used\n  Whether gcmh-mode is used\n  Idle time and Emacs uptime\n  Available OS memory (see memory-info)\n  Emacs memory allocation/GC stats\n  Current command\n  \n   submitted by    /u/yantar92  \n [link]   [comments]",

Chances are, if you are looking for an icon that looks good and appropriate, it's probably in there.\n The public API largely remains the same, but there are some backward incompatible changes in the private APIs. Please refer to the README for details.\n Judging from Github searches, these changes do not appear to cause too much breakage, but I could be wrong.

When I display the vector in emacs, the entries look exactly as I would expect.\n However, when I save them to the database, each entry not only includes the text that I want, but a bunch of elisp code around it that appears to be coding the relative position of the text within the org file. It's as if the text has a bunch of Metadata attached to it that is invisible within emacs but becomes visible when taken out of emacs and put into the database. I've tried many different ways but all end with the same outcome.\n It's clear that there's a problem with the methods im using, so I'm wondering if anyone has been able to successfully do something like this before or has some suggestions as to why this is happening and how to fix it.

          "description": "Recently I have been doing some programming in python. I have got it working nicely in Emacs - I may share my configuration another time.\n I'm have a problem with imports though. In Python you bring in a library by \"importing\" it. I often have to edit libraries that are part of the project I'm working on. The problem is that in Python 3 you can't unload a library, nor can you replace it with a newer version.\n This is a problem because Emacs python-mode is based around the idea of sending python code to a python shell. This works fine unless imports get involved. Once imports get involved you run into the problem that python will never re-import a library after it has imported it once. So, if you're editing a library the only way to update to the new version (which could be what you just wrote) is to stop the python process and start another one.\n Is there a fix for this? Has anyone written a package to at least make constantly restarting python more convenient?\n    submitted by    /u/RobThorpe  \n [link]   [comments]",

(This can be done in a pretty non-invasive way via hooks)\n Highlighting of matches on all visible lines in buffer. This is a noticeable patch to core consult code. Instead of creating a patch/fork, I just put into a separate file which I load after consult itself, it redefines quite a few core functions. It might break with newer consult versions.\n  \n​\n Feel free to try: https://gist.github.com/lazy/4f609cf2b956de2531885747e3c3bf88\n Save it to \"consult-patch.el\" file, open in emacs, M-x eval-buffer, run consult-line, search for something like \"let\" and enjoy.\n ​\n UPD: gist was updated at least once. Overlay caching didn't move overlays between windows. Now it doef.\n ​\n P.S. I saw another approach to doing that: https://github.com/minad/consult/pull/774. But minad decided not to merge it due to perf and personal preference. Mine is a little better performance-wise: it checks for highlighting only visible candidates and caches the highlight overlays (of which there can be many). But I am not sure if I will be able to overcome minad's personal preference, so don't want to bother with PR. If someone wants to polish this code and try merge into mainline, I won't mind.

However, one can infer when this command is finished, that is to say when the server is up and running, by looking at the output (i.e. when the string \"Server is running!\" is observed in the output).\n I want to code up an Elisp function that calls the command, wait until the server is up and running, and only then execute the next step. How would I best do this?\n My current method is check the relevant process-buffer every 0.5 sec (with sleep-for) to see if the known regex pattern is observed, however this seems a bit sub-optimal. In particular I am unable to use Emacs until the pattern is observed (even though my process is async).\n I have tried to read up on process filters as my understanding is that they are functions which receive output from processes, but I can't figure out a way to \"wait\" until the regex pattern is observed via filters.\n Does anyone have any idea how to reliably achieve this, or any pointers on where I should look to understand process filters better to get to my solution?\n    submitted by    /u/fast-90  \n [link]   [comments]",

Funny enough, I feel like I’m procrastinating organizing my life cause I’m thinking “wait I need to get org mode set up first”.\n The problem is, I’ve seen people say it takes YEARS to understand emacs and that it has an incredibly high learning curve. I wouldn’t mind using something like doom or centaur, but at the same time, it seems weird to use a preconfigured editor and not understand what’s going on underneath the hood, especially if there’s an issue and I don’t know how to fix it. You think that’s a big deal or is using those preset editors perfectly fine? I’m looking to use vim bindings so I wonder if I should just stay with doom.\n I’m planning on reading “Mastering Emacs”, working through the built in tutorial, the elisp tutorial (maybe, but it seems weird to not understand the language the entire applications is built and configured in), and maybe Emacs from Scratch and the org mode udemy tutorial by Rainer Konig.\n After all that maybe I’ll know enough to build my own config, or at least understand a lot of what goes on in doom or centaur or something.\n    submitted by    /u/Altruistic-Carpet-43  \n [link]   [comments]",

But one of the things I liked more, was that help buffers and other popup windows, get focused straight away, so they are easier to navigate and to close, just by using the normal movement keys and q. I always thought it was much nicer than the default in GNU Emacs, where the popup window is not focused so you use C-M-v and C-M-V to scroll it and C-x 1 to get rid of the help window.\n After a short period of XEmacs, I brought with me that XEmacs behavior for help buffers to GNU Emacs. I've been doing that for more than 20 years.\n Well, from the XEmacs changelog: \n  \nImprove: Help buffer behaviour synced with GNU (Mats Lidell)\n  \nI laughed so hard :D\n    submitted by    /u/noi-gai  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi folks, \n I found the following in Section 16.10 of the Emacs Lisp Info Manual for Emacs 28.2: \n \"Normally, well-designed Lisp programs should not use with-eval-after-load. If you need to examine and set the variables defined in another library (those meant for outside use), you can do it immediately—there is no need to wait until the library is loaded.\"\n Some obvious exceptions to setting variables \"immediately\" spring to mind, such as modifying a library's keymaps with define-key(). The keymaps must already exist, of course, which happens only after the library is loaded. I don't doubt that the manual authors had situations like that in mind with their beginning caveat, \"Normally . . .\" \n But more generally: what if the library, upon loading, overwrites -- with its own default values -- the values the user had earlier set? \n It seems to me that it's safer to put all setq()s and whatnot into with-eval-after-load and be done with it. Or are there benefits to the blunter \"don't bother waiting\" approach that I'm missing? \n This comment from the Info Manual is tormenting me: I would sooner die than write an ill-designed Lisp program!\n    submitted by    /u/tdavey  \n [link]   [comments]",

Sometimes helm lets me do that by choosing question mark [?], but that's not always the case.\n One example I experienced today. I'm using spacemacs with helm. I did find-file to a remote directory with TRAMP. So I'm in dired. From there I put M-x shell and it asked me the remote shell path. The default shown in helm text area is \"/bin/sh\" which is a reasonable default. But helm does not let me press enter there. So I can't open a remote shell.\n I thought there would be a way to just force put \"/bin/sh\", but I couldn't find any ways. C-f, C-z or whatever didn't work. I'm pretty surprised that helm does not have any unified way to fallback if there are no ways for a mature feature that existed such a long time.\n BTW, for that specific issue, I solved it with this elisp code, but I'm still curious if there's a way to fallback on helm.\n  (defadvice shell (around disable-helm activate) \"Disable helm-mode when calling `shell'.\" (if helm-mode (progn (helm-mode -1) ad-do-it (helm-mode 1)) ad-do-it)) \n    submitted by    /u/followspace  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "If anyone is interested, I've created an Atom backend for Gnus, which can be found here.\n I posted it to the Emacs development mailing list, but unfortunately it doesn't seem like there's much interest in it currently.\n The only major remaining issue with it is that it doesn't use Gnus' inheritance system, since I keep running into weird issues trying to implement it. If anyone is interested in helping with this I can provide more details. This doesn't affect usage at all, but it kinda sucks because I designed the backend to be very modular so it would be simple to quickly build custom backends.\n To use it, add (or browse) Atom feeds as servers, with the address being the URL of the feed (without a \"http://\" or \"https://\" prefix due to a limitation with how Gnus parses group names in some cases unfortunately). For example:\n (add-to-list 'gnus-secondary-select-methods '( nnatom \"somewebsite.tld/feed.xml\" (nnatom-name \"<optional custom name for the group>\"))) \n Each \"server\" will contain a single group with a name taken from the feed or 'nnatom-name'.\n Some design notes:\n  \nAtom feed entries (articles) can contain both a summary and \"content\" (or both, or neither). nnatom saves both, and allows viewing either by making the article multipart when needed.\n Every piece of data extracted from the feed is handled by a separate function, and all Gnus backend interface functions are generic, which allows very simple creation of derivative backends theoretically (you only need to implement a set of parsing functions for your feed).\n Every feed has it's own file for data storage, and those are the only files modified directly by nnatom.\n  \n   submitted by    /u/dsemy  \n [link]   [comments]",

I get a few different bugs. Most of the time, the pairing works but the inhibition doesn't (characters still pair immediately before or after a word character).

The autocomplete feature is great, but causes me issues when I am navigating through the code. \n A simple example is: when I comment a line in my code, and try to move to the line above or below, I can't do it. This is because the auto-complete pops up, and it scrolls through those options rather than go up or down in my code. As a result, every time I need to comment -> move left -> move up, instead of just moving up. Commenting is just one example. There are several other times (changing variables and so on) where this happens.\n I want the autocomplete to help me when I am trying to finish a variable or call a function, not unnecessarily bother me like this. Do you guys know of any solution to fix this?

Getting used to text-operation stuff (like C-a/M-f) to some extent makes consistency.\n - I use Japanese keyboard on desktop and laptop so that I can remap <muhenkan>, <henkan>, and <katakanahiragana> key (they are on my thumbs position) to control, shift, and escape key. I want my keyboard layout to be the same on desktop and laptop, so thumb clusters keyboards are not my choice.\n - I use meow for modal editing. I've used evil, but I didn't like to configure evil key bindings for every different mode. I also didn't like to disable evil completely for some modes. I just wanted to use j/k and J/K (I map J/K to scroll up/down faster) in certain modes like magit, that do not require much text editing. The thing I like the most about meow is its motion mode. In motion mode, I can use j/k and J/K to scroll, and if I wanted to dispatch keys that are bound in major-mode maps, I can simply prefix them with SPC key (the default is Hyper key, I changed it). In magit for example, I can dispatch k (magit-discard) by pressing SPC-k. Any keys that are not in motion mode map follow the major mode map. I do not use meow keypad because I'm comfortable with pressing control key. But for those who are not, meow keypad might be good.\n ​\n What do you think?

I've never used Vim before, and I don't think I ever will. I have a keyboard with thumb clusters, which eliminates the issue of the \"Emacs pinky\" entirely. In fact, I find myself preferring chorded commands because they make me feel like a Jedi, with my keyboard as a lightsaber of sorts. It all started with cut/copy/paste when I was a child, and Emacs' style of running commands feels more like magical sorcery to me.\n Moreover, I use a different keyboard layout than the standard \"QWERTY,\" so the default movement keys in Vim (\"HJKL\") are less convenient for me.\n I've noticed that switching between insert and normal mode in Evil Mode throws me off a bit, but maybe I just need to get used to it. I often hear people say that Evil Mode is a superior way to edit text compared to the default Emacs keybindings. However, I wonder if this preference is mostly driven by those who started with Vim and are already used to modal editing.\n I'm curious to hear your thoughts. In your opinion, what makes modal editing either superior/inferior? I'm particularly interested in hearing from those who have switched from Emacs to Vim (lol), especially if they inadvertently got used to Emacs keybindings first.\n Looking forward to your insights!\n    submitted by    /u/MysteryLiezer  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I'm currently working on an emacs configuration for myself. I'm coming from NeoVim and VSCode and both of those have a pretty easy way to fuzzy search for files in the current directory. VSCode has this built in and NeoVim can do this through telescope.\n It feels like there isn't a \"simple\" solution to this in emacs. find-file more or less requires me to type the path. Yes you get tab completion, but that's still pretty slow in comparison. And beyond that i seem to get into selectrum, orderless, marginalia and what not, which for one doesn't seem to solve this problem either, and feels needlessly complex for what i'm trying to do.\n So, my workflow has always been that i open my editor in my main projects directory. When i want to open a file, i press a hotkey and start searching with file and folder names. In 99.99% of cases i know exactly how the file is named and where it's located. I just don't want to have to type out the path. I'd rather type the parts of the path that are unique and get there quickly.\n What's the simplest solution for this? All i really need is a wrapper around fzf. fzf.el would do what i need, but doesn't work on windows. There is a fork of fzf.el that \"should\" fix that but i can't get it to work. I'm also not too sure how to point use-package to a random git repository rather than what's on melpa.\n    submitted by    /u/domsch1988  \n [link]   [comments]",

Programmers have been born, lived, and retired all under that era. This is all about to change. These insurmountable problems are about to become EASY to solve. YOU can implement the features that were impossibly hard for the previous generation. YOU can implement an object-at-point highlighter that is more performant and correct than ever. All you need to know is how to walk a tree.\n Trees are really what enable lisp's special powers. Lisp's tree nature is what made it possible to easily make advanced modes like paredit. Now everyone is about to have their tree exposed to package developers, not just lisp. The other languages always had a tree, it was just hidden.

          "description": "Because tree sitter is making a nice opportunity for us to evolve Emacs bindings, I have been pulling together some POC work into a package called user-keys.\n So far it's useful for Elisp programmers. I'm undecided about whether or how to take it to the next level for users. The state of progress:\n  \nreports and extensible tools for keymap analysis \n shadows (every single map that binds C-n for example)\n \"stupid keys\" that you want to delete everywhere\n preferred bindings state\n \n macro proof of concept for abstract key bindings, an idea I've pushed on emacs devel to make ad-hoc conventions like C-n configurable to the user\n lots of groundwork for mass rebinding or unbinding\n  \nsome of the kinds or report generation I created earlier.\n I was going to spike the code and use it as a demonstration for writing a transient UI, but I'm a little unclear on where to deliver the most value. I'm not super committed to this package, but felt it had too much utility already to keep it to myself.\n I'm interested in feature requests, hopes and dreams, (and support for the package or other packages I'm working on).\n I've been getting a lot of value out of the elisp repo kit (erk) and was able to use a normal TDD style like a civilized person, really making things go faster. I also got some more experience with the dash library and of course immense exposure to the weirdness of Emacs keymap data.\n    submitted by    /u/Psionikus  \n [link]   [comments]",

Since then I've progressed through org-mode, obsidian, and any number of other weird tools for my linked writing. At the moment, I'm mostly using neovim with Renee's (remember Renee? He's still around!) Telekasten plug-in (check it out if you're using neovim).\nAnyway, on a whim, I opened The Archive tonight to see how it would deal with the bizarre mess that my zettelkasten is. It works, flawlessly. The only issue is that I had to abandon putting things into subdirectories, which is something that I had been considering doing anyway. So, I did that, and, just in playing around, I got more actual useful connected thinking done tonight than I have in a long, long time.\nMuch love to Christian and Sascha, again.\nLong Live The Archive.",

A workshop means that you don't have to compete for time or attention as if you are in an underfunded public school. So, I decided 8 is a reasonable size.

There are no complicated workflow terms you'll need to learn or note typology (which is only clouding the applicable knowledge). It is 5 hours of intense learning to get you started (most likely divided in 3 sessions with 2 additional open consulting hours).\nCost: 250-300$ for the whole workshop.\nThere will be an official announcement.

          "description": "ChatGPT and I collaborated on a Visual Studio Code extension to display a list of markdown files by their H1 header. The extension is called Zettel View, and it contributes a Zettlr-like display of Zettels to the VS Code Explorer View, as shown below.\n\nClicking on any file in the Zettel View window opens the Zettel markdown file in an editor window and causes the file explorer to highlight the selected file.  Since I installed the \"Auto-Open Markdown Preview\" VS Code extension, the markdown preview of the selected Zettel also appears.\nThe Zettel View extension for VS Code is available on my GitHub account.\nZettel View makes some assumptions about Zettels. First, Zettels are markdown files with the extension .md. Second, a markdown file's H1 or level-one header has the form # ID TITLE (the ID is to the left; some prefer the ID on the right). Third, ID matches a regular expression specific to my ID scheme. Fourth, ID.md is the filename of the Zettel markdown file with the header # ID TITLE.\nThe second and third assumptions are hard-coded but could be made configurable in later versions of the extension. The fourth assumption isn't enforced: a mismatch between ID.md and the filename will appear as a discrepancy between the Zettel selected in the Zettel View and the file explorer. A warning will be emitted in that case.\nZettr has the built-in configuration setting, \"Display files using first heading level 1 if available.\" A community plugin for Obsidian called \"File Explorer Markdown Titles\" once produced a similar display in the Obsidian file explorer. Unfortunately, that plugin no longer works with newer versions of Obsidian. Since VS Code is more valuable for my work than Obsidian, it made more sense to develop a VS Code extension than to modify the plugin to work with the current Obsidian API. I plan to move to VS Code the Pandoc and LaTeX integration I configured in Zettlr.",

Don't let me monopolize this thread.\nI've been trying to get into the habit of refactoring notes by spending a few minutes each day in the refactoring mode.

Here is my typical workflow.\nI first go through the learning process. To learn about these things, we basically consume some form of a source like the Wikipedia page, articles, explanations, videos, etc. On a side note, I always do a syntopical reading (coined by Adler I guess?!), I never read about a topic only from one source. I at least use two, to get a better understanding of it. Anyways, so I read and read and watch and watch and as I am going along with it I am learning in my head by doing all those wonderful things that my brain can do, thinking, analyzing, critiquing, understanding, comparing, blah blah bl…",

I think elsewhere it is referred to as \"a personal tool for thinking and writing.\" Which, I think helps to see more of the picture of the problem situation. Knowledge. Thinking. Writing.\nI'd love to hear some thoughts from others in this forum on how they'd answer this question.\nBereiter, C. (2002). Education and mind in the knowledge age. L. Erlbaum Associates. ↩︎",

I was able to dump the references into a *.bibtex file and import it into bibdesk, but I don't know how I can attach those PDFs to references in BibDesk. Does someone here know?\nAlso, bookends supports what they call, I think, \"floating citations\", where pressing alt-alt in The Archive brings up a small window where I can search a reference and it pastes, for example, [@Smith1976] into the Archive. This too I'd love to replicate, but if not available, I can script it easily enough using an unholy mix of Python and Keyboard Maestro and Alfred.\nWhy I want to switch: Bookends isn't very git-friendly; they produce a binary file containing the references instead of a text file like bibtex.\nMany thanks!",
