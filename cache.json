          "description": "Some weeks ago, I asked here, if there is a way to let GHC infer backwards constraints from instance declaration, i. e. for instance  instance (A a) => B a where  have not only forall a. A a => B a, but also forall a. B a => A a. It's correct, provided that we have no overlapping instance for B. In answers there were a link to an article on this topic. However, implementation from the article requires essential changes in GHC. I found some way to make this with currently available extensions (mostly type families) with not so much boilerplate and now uploaded it on github with my solution for the first problem from the \"Motivation\" section of the paper.\n However, I think, it's not quite natural. If this method is general enough and can be automated, it seems me very nice to have an GHC plugin or even GHC extension to make this without any hacks in code. For example, such syntax of class declaration:  class {-# BIDIRECTIONAL #-} A a where  will make all instance of this class bidirectional (and forbids overlaps).\n What do you think about it? More concrete questions: - are there any other (beside this article) conversations about this feature? - does this feature sound reasonable enough to implement it? - what are disadvantages of using bidirectional instances, besides it conflicts with overlappable instances? are the overlappable instances for most of classes (for example common classes from base) really used in haskell?\n I ask this to gather more pros&cons for this feature. If it will considered to be useful enough, maybe I'll try to implement it. Anyway, it's nice for me to learn more opinions about this.\n    submitted by    /u/Lev_135  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello everyone, I write Haskell as a hobby. I am still learning and some concepts are still very hard to understand for me. Since I mostly write Javascript for my day job, I recently got into a very interesting problem. I had to write some logic in where as set of data has to be checked through multiple other datasets and return a value or null at the end.\n When I thought this through in imperative way, I found that I have to write a massive set of if-else logic which might end-up being an \"if-else hell\" and quite unmanageable to in future. Since I knew I can chain a Maybe monad through multiple function using bind operator in Haskell. I ended up implementing something like this in JS. Here is the Maybe monad implementation \n class Maybe { __value; constructor(value) { this.__value = value; } static from(value) { return new Maybe(value); } isNothing() { return ( this.__value === null || this.__value === undefined || this.__value === false ); } just() { return this.__value; } do(f) { if (this.isNothing()) { return Maybe.from(null); } return Maybe.from(f(this.__value)); } \n }\n With the help of this I can do something like this --\n Maybe.from(1) .do(prevValue => prevValue === 1 ? prevValue + 5 : null) //return Maybe 6 .do(prevValue => prevValue > 5 ? prevValue * 2 : null) //return Maybe 12 .do(prevValue => prevValue > 10 ? prevValue + 30 : null) // return Maybe 42 .do(prevValue => prevValue > 100 ? prevValue + 5 : null) // return Maybe null .do(prevValue => prevValue < 100 ? prevValue + 50 : prevValue * prevValue) // will do nothing here .just() // return null since failed on 4th step \n Is my understanding of Maybe monad implementation correct?

I understand specific use cases, but I'm having trouble gaining a general intuition of what monads and applicative functors do. For example Typeclassopedia says \"the structure of a Applicative computation is fixed, whereas the structure of a Monad computation can change based on intermediate results\". By \"structure of computation\", do they mean that it behaves similar to an if-else statement? Like if b from (a -> m b) is 5, then do x, otherwise do y.\n What I took away from Graham Hutton's video on applicative functors was that they basically are an extension of fmap but for multiple arguments. This made sense, until I thought about the List applicative. pure (+) <*> [1, 2, 3] <*> [1, 2, 3] equals [2, 3, 4, 3, 4, 5, 4, 5, 6], which makes the \"multiple arguments\" angle confusing. I know that applicative functors can \"embedded\" functions into context, and that's why the result of the List applicative was so, because of how it models nondeterminism. But idk it just hasn't \"clicked\" for me yet.\n I was wondering someone could explain the intuition behind monads and applicative functors.

          "description": "I am learning Haskell as a Scala/ZIO developer. I just read https://www.fpcomplete.com/haskell/tutorial/exceptions/ while trying to understand why Haskell effects such as Polysemy and RIO don't have a typed error channel (as in ZIO). In particular, this quote:\n  \nThere is no indication at the type level if something throws an exception. You should assume that, unless explicitly documented otherwise, all actions may throw an exception.\n  \nMeaning, every time I call any `IO`, I can expect an exception, meaning every time I need to use something like `tryIO` and handle the exception. Doesn't that cause a lot of boilerplate? If you have to try every piece of code doesn't it look really defensive? In ZIO you just have to make sure the error channel has the correct type when composing effects, but it will handle short-circuiting for you.\n    submitted by    /u/crpleasethanks  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I'm writing a generic library for wrapping some FFI-code neatly.\n The FFI-functions rely on an external context type that can be generated from a configuration type. Essentially, all but initial configuration functions take a pointer to the context as one of their arguments. As part of memory management, I wrap this pointer with finalizers and a reference counter in a newtype that is intended to be pretty opaque to the user. \n Since I want this library to be polymorphic for different codes wrapped in the same manner, I want to create a typeclass\n  class Context c where type RawContext c --type of unwrapped context type RawConfig c --type of unwrapped config \n With methods that map directly to the utility functions in the FFI-code, and some other instance specific functions. The problem is that most of these methods make no direct reference to c, but rather RawContext c and/or RawConfig c, which makes them ambiguous.\n One solution to this would be to instead use functional dependencies ``` class Context context rawContext rawConfig | context -> rawContext, context -> rawConfig, rawContext -> context, rawConfig -> context, rawContext -> rawConfig, rawConfig -> rawContext where\n ... ```\n but this would result in pretty cumbersome type signatures, which I want to avoid.\n Is it possible to get clean type signatures, as in a class with only one type variable (the wrapped context type) without resorting to AmbiguousTypes? I have not worked with type families much before, but they seem like a cleaner solution for something like this if they are applicable.\n    submitted by    /u/FluxusMagna  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have a simple data structre like this: data Document = Document { title :: String, content :: [String], wordCount :: Int } I want to have besides the default constructor where I have to provide a title and the content another one where I just have to provide the title and the content or just the title. And I also want to have a constructor function that creates out of a completely different data structure a Document. I find it pretty nasty to name all these constructor functions differently. Especially since I encountered this problem with a lot of different data structures. So I decided to use ad-hoc polymorphism provided by a generic type-class: class Factory a b where ‏‏‎‏‏‎‏‏‎‏‏‎­ create :: a -> b Which I use like this: instance Factory String ([String] -> Document) where create title words = Document { title = title, words = words, wordCount = 0 } instance Factory String Document where create title = Document { title = title, words = [], wordCount = 0 } instance Factory RawDocument Document where create RawDocument{..} = create title (splitOn \" \" content) Now I can use simply the create function everywhere with the defined input types. And it scales nicely with all my data structures. Do you see any problems with this approach? I'm really not sure if I'm missing something. I'm just facing one problem: - Either I define the factories in the same module as the data structure, but then I need to live with the name shadowing warnings for values like title and words (I would hate to name them differently since they describe the same thing) - Or I have a separate Factory-Module but then I have to live with the orphan instance warnings.

          "description": "A new version of LeanCheck is out (v1.0.0). LeanCheck is a property testing library (like QuickCheck) that tests values enumeratively.\n Example. Here is a simple example of LeanCheck in action showing that sorting is idempotent and list union is not commutative:\n > import Test.LeanCheck > import Data.List (sort, union) > check $ \\xs -> sort (sort xs) == sort (xs::[Int]) +++ OK, passed 200 tests. > check $ \\xs ys -> xs `union` ys == ys `union` (xs::[Int]) *** Failed! Falsifiable (after 4 tests): [] [0,0] \n LeanCheck works on all types that are instances of the Listable typeclass and is able to derive instances automatically using either Template Haskell or GHC.Generics. See LeanCheck’s Haddock documentation for more details. LeanCheck is compatible with Hspec, Tasty and test-framework.\n What's new? Version 1.0.0 signalizes stability in the API. LeanCheck has not actually changed much in the past couple of years and there are no significant differences between the early 0.9 series.\n Installing. You can find LeanCheck on Hackage or GitHub. It is also tracked on Stackage. You can install it with:\n $ cabal install leancheck \n    submitted by    /u/rudymatela  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "One of the controversies I've set up elsewhere is the provocative statement that \"Haskell is for s-code\". That is to say, since Haskell has a very low refactoring cost, it's possible to just scratch out anything (this is a bit extreme) that works, then refactor it into clean code, something that is more difficult in languages with substantial refactoring costs.\n ​\n There's also something that seems to be \"pseudocode-driven development\", i.e, you scratch out something in undefined and error \"todos\", and constantly branch downwards, and the type system might force you to play Type Tetris, but you can often hash something out before you work on refactoring and optimizing it.\n ​\n I wouldn't call myself an experienced Haskeller; hell, by the definition \"you're not a real Haskeller until you've written your first compiler\" I'm not a Haskeller. A question to more experienced Haskellers: is Haskell as a language for prototyping then refactoring a useful definition? If so, what are the limitations of such (a recent project had to be completely rewritten because I lost the ability to understand the code, despite constantly using long variable names)?\n ​\n And if only-okay quality Haskell code can be refactored constantly, can Haskell be sold as a language, for, well, s-code? That's a bit too \"marketer-speak\", as it completely upends common perceptions of Haskell, but the weaker and more polite \"prototype code\" or \"draft code\" might have sway. But the more radical terminology, one, attracts attention, and second, makes Haskell seem approachable (\"you mean I don't have to be a rocket scientist to be productive in Haskell?\").\n    submitted by    /u/Instrume  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi everyone! \n I've just released version 0.9.0 of the dunai libraries, which comes with version 0.13.6 of bearriver. \n For those unfamiliar, dunai is a reactive programming library structured around a notion of Monadic Stream Functions. dunai can be used to implement other reactive and FRP frameworks on top, including Classic FRP and Arrowized FRP variants. bearriver itself is an API-compatible implementation of Yampa. All versions of GHC from 7.6 to 9.4 are supported.\n Release information\n This is mainly a maintenance release. Among other changes, this version improves the documentation in dunai-test. Additionally, a function that was exposed unnecessarily is being deprecated in preparation for its future removal.\n  \nRelease: https://github.com/ivanperez-keera/dunai/releases/tag/v0.9.0.\n \nHackage:\n  \ndunai: https://hackage.haskell.org/package/dunai.\n dunai-test: https://hackage.haskell.org/package/dunai-test\n bearriver: https://hackage.haskell.org/package/bearriver\n \n \nRepo: https://github.com/ivanperez-keera/dunai.\n \n Upcoming changes\n We are synchronizing releases with the Yampa project to ensure that bearriver incorporates any changes added to Yampa. Additionally, the goal is to eventually use Yampa's tests also to give bearriver full test coverage.\n Two changes are being discussed that will potentially affect users:\n - The introduction of a new constraint in VectorSpace in simple-affine-space would alter the type constraints of some functions. See #298.\n  \nA re-structuring of the API to better reflect the purpose of the implementation. This could also lead to a division of dunai into multiple libraries. See #305.\n  \nThe next release is expected to be published on October 21, 2022.\n Happy Haskelling!\n    submitted by    /u/ivanpd  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm not sure what exactly yet, and am happy to adjust to the library if worthwhile.\n Think of it as similar to a dashboard. No human input (mouse, keyboard...) present.\n The graphics library does not have to be super tailored for exactly that use case, if I have to come up with the \"widgets\" myself that's okay. But then it should have a reasonable set of drawing primitives, e.g. for boxes and rendering text.\n Direct output to framebuffer preferred, but if it only works under X it's not a dealbreaker.

But in this case I definitely know, they should not exist. Is there any way to tell compiler \"for this class this is a single instance and you can add MonadState' s (ExceptT s m) => MonadState' s m to your inferred rules list\"? As far as I see, there shouldn't be any problems with that for typechecking, so I hope this has already been realized. Or there are some problems that I can't forsee?\n Motivation: I try to make it possible to change, for example, type of error of transformer without decomposing whole monad. So, roughly speaking, I would like to have the function haskell mapError :: (MonadError e m, MonadError e' m', ???) => (e -> e') -> m -> m'  this can be done using type families (like MappedErrorMonad e e' m m') for errors only. But we have a problem when there is some state both at the left and right sides. So we want to tell compiler something like MappedErrorMonad e e' m m' => (MonadState s m => MonadState s m'). For this purpose I've introduced haskell class (forall m a. (Monad m, c' (t a m)) => c' (t b m)) => MappableSave (t :: * -> (* -> *) -> * -> *) (c' :: (* -> *) -> Constraint)  And now want to inhabit this class by ExceptT:  instance MappableSave ExceptT (MonadState s)  But compiler failed with error  • Could not deduce (S.MonadState s m) arising from the superclasses of an instance declaration from the context: (Monad m, S.MonadState s (ExceptT a m)) bound by a quantified context  that's where my topic started\n    submitted by    /u/Lev_135  \n [link]   [comments]",

I've begun reaching out to companies that are already postured to work with Skillbridge interns, but I'm most excited about working in Haskell. \n Do you have any suggestions about where I can find companies that would like to have a ~junior Haskell programmer and can support good quality mentorship? That company would have to register with the program but it's genuinely not difficult, just a bit slow.\n Edit: I would be available to start in May 2023; when a company signs up for the program, it can take 90-120 days to be approved, thus the lead time.

Since the value produced by g' is not an actual list, I can't make it the input of fmap or map. I'm not sure how to continue from here. \n In a perfect world I'd write\n g = flip fmap $ flip take $ iterate (+1) 1\n and then call\n g (+1) 3 which would produce [2,3,4], but it doesn't.

However, I am a bit confused at the moment, that which tagless final approach is the right one. I know there are tons of resources out there which states that in tagless final pattern, we use trait as the algebra with a companion object. Most of the times, developers tend to do the implementations in the companion object as well, or create another class (interpreter) where they implement the algebra's functions. However, I have seen many solutions where the devs replace the trait + companion object combo with class + companion object one. \n Honestly, I am pretty confused which approach is the right one: \n // 1. trait + companion object approach trait Repository[F[_]] { def findAll[A](): F[List[A]] } object Repository { def apply[F[_]]()(implicit ev: Repository[F]): Repository[F] = ev def make[F[_]](): Repository[F] = new Repository[F] { def findAll[A](): F[List[A]] = ... } } // 2. class + companion object approach class Repository[F[_]]() { def findAll[A](): F[List[A]] = ... } object Repository { def apply[F[_]](): Repository[F] = new Repository[F]() } \n    submitted by    /u/t_peter_  \n [link]   [comments]",

The original solution was: (3)\n  (OPCODE_NOP, Instruction.Nop) \n But it turns out the second element of the tuple becomes Instruction.Nop.type, instead of a function as I would expect. My question is why is it so and is there a way to shorten the function (2) with placeholders to something similar to the last code block (3) ?\n -----\n Side note: implementors of Instruction have different argument sets, so currently I split them into multiple groups based on argument sets and handle them using LUTs:\n val handlers_type_reg_reg = List( (OP1, OP1_constructor), .. ) val handlers_type_reg = List( (OP2, OP2_constructor), .. ) val handler_types = List( (OP1, handler_type_reg_reg), (OP2, handler_type_reg), ..) \n So the top-level function would choose a specific function for a group of instructions based on an argument set and call it, the specific function would look up the constructor for the specific instruction and call it.\n Does it look sane or am I missing some beautiful FP / Scala expressiveness?:)\n    submitted by    /u/superdupermicrochip  \n [link]   [comments]",

A huge number of community-contributed fixes and improvements are included. Furthermore, a ton of work has been put into automating things so that merging pull requests, keeping the documentation website up to date, and cutting releases can be done effortlessly.\n You can see the draft release notes here and the upgrade guide at https://scala-slick.org/doc/prerelease/upgrade.html#upgrade-from-3-3-x-to-3-4-0. The latest docs are at https://scala-slick.org/doc/prerelease/index.html.\n After 3.4.0 is released, the top priority is Scala 3 support, G-d willing. Stefan Zeiger, the original author of Slick, wrote an implementation already, but there is work that still needs to be done to get it ready for consumption. I plan to release the result as 3.5.0.\n After that, I would like to see Slick evolve freely.\n If you would like to get involved, feel free to DM me. Or, help fund Slick by sponsoring me: https://github.com/sponsors/nafg.\n P.S.

          "description": "Just in time for the start of the school year, I'm happy to announce the public release of hwtest, a Scala 3 library for problem sets (generically, \"homeworks\"). This is a near-total rewrite of a homegrown system I've been using with students since 2013.\n The basic idea is that the teacher creates some problems to solve, and some test cases for those problems. The students then implement the functions and can check their work against the test cases.\n A starter file might look like this: ``` object hwExample extends hwtest.hw(\"CS123\"): def userName = ??? \n def square(x: Int): Int = ???\n test(\"square\", square, \"x\") \n def isOdd(n: Int): Boolean = ??? ignoretest(\"isOdd\", isOdd, \"n\")  The student would fill in their name  def userName = \"Margaret Hamilton\"  and then take a stab at the first function  def square(x: Int): Int = x * x  Then run their code to check their work:  Margaret Hamilton Data source: hwExample.tests (remote) Begin testing square at Tue Aug 16 10:12:48 EDT 2022 ..... Passed 5/5 tests in 0.71 seconds. ***** Ignoring tests for isOdd.  Next they change the `ignoretest` to `test`, and take a stab at the second function. Re-running the code, they get  CS123: hwExample (hwtest 1.0.0) Margaret Hamilton Data source: hwExample.tests (remote) Begin testing square at Tue Aug 16 10:15:22 EDT 2022 ..... Passed 5/5 tests in 0.44 seconds. Begin testing isOdd at Tue Aug 16 10:15:23 EDT 2022 .... Test #5 *** FAILED *** n = -21 Expected answer: true Received answer: false Passed 4/5 tests in 0.09 seconds. ```\n Obviously, we also want our students to learn how to make their own tests, so I wouldn't use this ALL the time, but it works great for less experienced students who are learning to program.\n More information at https://github.com/chrisokasaki/hwtest\n    submitted by    /u/chrisokasaki  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have tested it with over 40+ http clients for java, scala and kotlin. The core library contains only one transitive dependency, slf4j-api, and the remaining part only uses the available classes within the jdk.\n In the past I was required to configure a http client with different configurations depending on the project requirements, such as:\n  \nOne way authentication\n Two way authentication\n Using multiple truststores and keystores\n Using pem files\n Reloading ssl\n  \nTo make it easy to reuse for myself and everyone I thought it would be good to make a library out of it and also contribute back to the community. I wanted to hide all the verbosity away and just provide easy to use builder methods without needing to know how to create SSLContext, KeyManager, TrustManager etc. I initially posted it on the java channel, but I thought it could also be intresting for scala developers.

And we receive back \"the best\" object (possible options are embodied).\n The topic is being actively researched. And papers are not simple sometimes to start from scratch. I tried to make an introduction that will help to do the first steps.\n For instance, it was not so easy to understand (and implement, for sure) product to combine selections: ```scala def product[R, A]: List[J[R, A]] => J[R, List[A]] =\n (functions: List[J[R, A]]) =>\n (listEval: List[A] => R) =>\n functions match {\n case evalFun :: restEvalFunctions =>\n val a: A =\n evalFun((candidate: A) =>\n listEval(\n candidate ::\n product\n .apply(restEvalFunctions)\n .apply(\n restCandidates =>\n listEval(candidate :: restCandidates)\n )\n )\n ) \n  val as: List[A] = product(restEvalFunctions)(rest => listEval(a :: rest)) a :: as case Nil => Nil } \n ```\n And the product is really useful.

At least for a while, I’d like something where I get to focus more on writing good, tested, maintainable, reusable code (things that are valued but not prioritized in DS). I feel that focusing on those things would make me a better professional even if I decide to come back to a DS/ML job later.\n And it would be great to be able to use more Scala and FP (something that I get to do only rarely in my area, since Python is lingua franca).\n I guess that Data Engineer would be the most feasible role to switch into, since there is some intersection/synergy with the job experience I already have… although maybe not that much...\n So my question is, based on your experience actually working as engineers… do you think this is feasible? Are there some areas that I should focus on strengthening before being able to attempt this? Would I have to start at a junior role, or is my experience in DS/ML pertinent enough for me to aspire to a higher seniority?\n I know that this is pretty unorthodox, but hell, if it makes me enjoy my day to day work even more, then I think it’s worth considering.

A good, Arrow-backed, dependency free DataFrame library would be a great way to make Scala even better for data programming. Spark is great for big data, but Scala would benefit from having a DataFrame library for small data tasks as well.\n I'll quote one of the commentors in a recent thread I created: \"The real problem is that we have no simple alternative for Pandas and numpy\"\n I'd be happy to collaborate with someone on this effort if you're interested. I am a dev advocate and am already working with the creators of Polars and DataFusion, two Rust based DataFrame libraries, to help them grow their projects. Interested if the community thinks this is a good idea. I don't have the coding skills to build an Arrow-based Scala DataFrame lib myself, but would be happy to help out with the project evangelism.\n    submitted by    /u/MrPowersAAHHH  \n [link]   [comments]",

I've heard some noise around Scala being a secure-by-default language thanks to it's type safety, which I don't totally buy (that is, I see how that could make it secure in terms of input validation, but security doesn't just come down to input validation!) \n Anyways that said, I have a couple of questions:\n  \nCan you point to me to any resources around secure software development for Scala specifically?\n Have any of you got any experience in using SAST tools like Semgrep, Snyk Code, Codacy, Checkmarx, etc?

          "description": "When newcomers begin with their first steps in Scala, for example building a simple rest API, they're guided towards the Typelevel ecosystem, http4s or similar. While Scala itself is an advanced language that takes time to learn, adding functional programming on top of that is unbearable for like 99% of newcomers. Doesn't seem like the Scala community embraces the standard Scala anymore, which makes this language for the \"elite\" only. Back in the day, Akka was sold a silver bullet to all problems and the overhead of complexity wasn't worth it for most. It seems like those pure functional libraries have the same problem, they have an even bigger overhead of complexity. It would be nice to have an ecosystem of standard Scala libraries that don't try to enforce a different style of programming and they will be the standard goto for newcomers. Otherwise, it seems like Scala will continue to decline in popularity since newcomers are not able to absorb the complexity of purely functional programming.\n    submitted by    /u/grpvw  \n [link]   [comments]",

But bash.toml (which I didn't touch at all!) now includes the #+begin_src and #+end lines of the :noweb-ref prompt-format block.\n I'd be really grateful if anyone could have a look at the diff and let me know where I've gone wrong:\n https://github.com/quarkQuark/dotfiles/commit/82551520806ad2e9c2b22e3bc4446c5352ce14c2\n I've also noticed that sometimes replacing a :noweb-ref header argument with an equivalent #+name makes every noweb reference in the org file expand to the empty string.

It is very cumbersome to browse headlines because I have to keep opening file after file for each week of journal entries.\n I had the idea that yearly would be a better option, letting me see all of the headlines for a given year. But there isn't a timestamp for the entries. Each new date gets an entry but no timestamp within the day. Is this by design?\n Okay, so I can just hit a key combo and let emacs put in a timestamp for me. It doesn't work. C-c . just inserts the date, no time. C-u C-c . also just inserts the date, no time.\n Anyone with ideas on how I can have my journal entries timestamped, short of me looking at a clock and entering it by hand?\n    submitted by    /u/BobKoss  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "So, I cannot afford to switch to emacs for my day job (full-stack dev) and take the productivity hit, but I would like to give this emacs thingy a try for fun and start learning. Eventually I want to try to use it for coding (with new for me stuff like lisp and clojure or even with my current stack).\n So is there some resource online where I can explore 'cool' things to try in emacs?\n Specifically:\n  \nare there any 'packages' that I must have, that promote learning the commands and key bindings and exploring? e.g. autocomplete, suggestions, recovering from errors, docs etc.\n any pointers on how to do FS navigation in emacs? any must-have packages to help with that\n any pointers on how to do theming? Ideally, to just use some nice theme, with good defaults, not looking for customization at this point. (watched some youtube videos where orgmode looked so much better than mine)\n is theming done per major/minor mode or based on packages or something else?\n any pointers on getting started with org-mode? I am going through orgmode.org rn and got somewhat familiar with the syntax. I am trying to evaluate it and I don't see the value yet. do i need any plugins for it?\n I am confused with the package managers and the options you have and how to import. Is there some rule of thumb I can follow that can help me simplify adding packages? I don't need 'options' right now, I need a 'do it this way, it gets you to 90%'\n I was watching some videos and saw this https://github.com/daviwil/dotfiles/blob/master/Emacs.org, which is HUUUGE. Is there some other resource that I can just start with one piece/package at a time and keep adding more slowly?\n  \nSorry if this was posted before (it must have, I guess, but not recently), but I am after some specific things. I need someone to take me by the hand cause this thing is deep and wide and I feel lost.\n Also apologies for the long post. ANY feedback is much appreciated!\n    submitted by    /u/DryNick  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "A struggle that I often have writing prose in Org-mode (or in any text editor with a markup language) is when I need to review things.\n I like to review from a printed copy, I'm better at catching errors that way. I also enjoy the ritual of getting off of my computer, sitting on a desk with printed pages, a red pen, and a cup of coffee.\n For that, I'll export as latex-pdf or odt and print---no big deal. The problem is that when I go back to the computer to make the changes in the file, the positions of the words and sentences are naturally very different from the ones in the printed page. So I have to be constantly switching my view from two texts that are very differently formatted, and that is tiresome. So much so, that I will often make the changes in the odt file on Libreoffice Writer, losing my god-given editing shortcuts, and once they are all done, I'll copy the text and paste it back on my org file. But then I have to be careful with italics and other stuff that will change once I copy the text in the odt and paste it on org. If all I'm doing is writing some informal text, no biggie. But when on an academic writing, messing with footnotes I'd be playing with fire to work in that way. So I end up writing a lot of my academic writer in Writer instead of Emacs.\n The obvious easy solution would be to get used to review from screen, directly in the org file. But that wouldn't help whenever I have other people's review of my text, like advisors and other professors (and a lot of them will require something compatible to MS-Word anyway, for them to use track changes).\n So... any technical solutions of different workflows that I haven't considered? How do you deal with that?\n    submitted by    /u/copperbranch  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "When I open a header or quickly scroll through a newly opened org-file, I can see how the buffer is drawn in a different font-size and color and with all the leading stars shown, and then it is quickly repaired. Why is that? Did I set some hook wrong?\n I managed to capture it in the moment being drawn (see picture). A fracture of a second later, all the headings will look like \"Szenen allgemein\". But this is redundant, I would prefer Emacs not to have to draw everything twice.\n I have custom-set the faces of the headings a little bit bigger and set them to Source Sans Pro font. The colors come from the theme doom-solarized-light. I use org-superstars to change the looking of the stars, but even if I didn't, why are there two stars drawn at first, with org-hide-leading-stars set to t?\n If I add +pretty to the doom module list, this behaviour is gone (although it should only load org-appear and org-fancy-priorities), but then there is some bug, everything gets extremely slow, taking five seconds to load a 1.3M-file and 1-2 seconds to open a header. I don't need org-appear and org-fancy-priorities, so I prefer the setting without the +pretty module.\n Any ideas why the buffer is drawn twice and how I can omit that?\n https://preview.redd.it/izkow5sm1ek91.jpg?width=1137&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ea408f5b52194c8e23d70db50fb5eff91f2cb012\n    submitted by    /u/TiMueller  \n [link]   [comments]",

(Although I'm too much of a dinosaur to have tried it.) \n The customization you can do in VSCode, or any other environment, stands in relation to that which can do in emacs as the sounds you can coax from a referee's whistle stand in relation to the music you can play on a piano. \n But that's not the point. The point is that everything is a buffer -- EIAB. Until one has used emacs enough for that to sink in, one has not really used it, and one might as well stick with VSCode. Pick your favorite shell (bash, zsh, etc.) and make it your default shell in emacs. Then do M-x shell. Start using your new shell. Observe that it is just another buffer. Live with that for a while, until the profundity of it sinks in. Then accept your fate, which is to watch in pity, for the rest of your life, as your non-emacs colleagues struggle to interact with their computers. You're now a deer bounding through the woods, past coyotes chewing their own legs off from the traps they're stuck in. Unfortunately, you can never unsee that vision. Sorry!\n  \n​\n I'm still using Doom because I like the evil keybindings, but maybe one of you can convince me to fully commit!\n    submitted by    /u/bjaminar  \n [link]   [comments]",

But in the actual editor if I try to use 'M-d' it says: 'I-Search Backward: [No Previous Search String]'. \n I have not created any new keybinds myself. I'm just very much working on defaults so far.\n How can I fix this?\n    submitted by    /u/_analysis230_  \n [link]   [comments]",

I started it up and --bang-- it is up. Just like in 1993/4. \n Now this is all using the standard OpenBSD and Ubuntu Emacs packages.

I have made-up my own explanation of Emacs, and I just want to make sure I'm not saying anything blatantly wrong. \n  \nEmacs is more than a text editor, it's a Lisp interpreter. Anything you can code with Lisp, you can do in Emacs. Much like how a web browser is just an HTML (& CSS & Javascript) Interpreter. Anything you can write in HTML, you can make a web browser do. \n However, web browsers are external to your computer. You can use a web browser to edit a photo, but you have to upload the photo, do the edits, and then download the photo again, and that's inefficient. Emacs works completely on your system, using your computer's resources to their fullest potential. A web browser could never make files or folders on your computer, but Emacs can, and incorporate so much more into your system. \n  \nThis is the assumption I've managed to get out of my first few days with Emacs.

I know it's really nothing major, just bothers me a bit and i'm wondering if this is a common occurrence with emacs or is it just my system. It can happen more often when folding-unfolding headers in an org file, just a small delay (~1sec) at random, for the action to perform. Not searching for the magic solution, just wanted to see if it is just me or if i might be doing something wrong.\n Thanks for taking the time to read this.\n P.S. My config is really minimal, just the colorscheme, ivy, haskell mode, yasnippet, auctex and my key maps.

While that works fine I am not able to automatically adjust the internal-frame color to the theme's background color. I can do it manually buy using\n (defun my/adjust_internal_border_color () \"Adjust the internal border color to match the theme's background color\" (custom-set-faces!

But I was debugging a problem with my init file which hadn't loaded completely, had the problem halfway solved but then accidentally suspended the Emacs GUI.

If anything, it seems like some kind of practical joke.\n There doesn't seem to be any way to recover the previous state of the program.

Then it is easy to create the website from one org document by running org-babel-tangle. Right now I'm using a bash code block to create results:\n #+name: php-files #+BEGIN_SRC bash :results output cd $HOME/Downloads/; for f in *; do echo \"#+begin_src html :tangle '/sudo::/srv/http/$f'\" paste /dev/null - < \"$f\" #pukes out php content of file echo \"#+end_src\" echo \"\" done #+end_src #+RESULTS: php-files #+begin_example ,#+begin_src html :tangle '/sudo::/srv/http/01.php' <?php // code of 01.php ?> ,#+end_src ,#+begin_src html :tangle '/sudo::/srv/http/02.php' <?php // code of 01.php } ?> #+end_example \n This output is almost what I want.

          "description": "Software monoliths are sort of an older way of building software, and making things small and single purpose has been Linux wisdom the Unix Philosophy that is usually right. Emacs is the biggest threat to hypocrisy here, since it can itself be considered a huge monolith that does everything. Aside from that, however, there are other remarkable monoliths (giant pieces of software with huge code-bases and broad functionality) in the emacs ecosystem, some of which are so big and established and useful that they are hard to replace. What are some of your favorites, and what do they do that is hard to replace for you?\n Here are some of mine:\n  \nOrg-mode. It's breadth is actually part of its value-proposition with literate programming in many languages, publication to a plethora of outputs, and rich note-taking (code notebook-style) to an extent unreached by any other tool of which I'm aware. Plus it's really good for actually taking tech/class notes.\n Gnus. Letting me easily* do email across many addresses in emacs, and integrating well with the related monolith...\n BBDB. It has great support for all manner of contacts and, apparently, all sorts of exports, with prevalent and rich interfaces.\n Helm. Really a swiss-army knife of completion, but there have been a plethora of lighter more specific altervatives in the past few years. Nonetheless, my students loved the ease and \"do it all\" made possible by Helm.\n  \n   submitted by    /u/WorldsEndless  \n [link]   [comments]",

I believe this is caused by the fact that I'm loading the built-in org version in init.el, and then trying to load/use an updated version in config.org (which causes some void variable errors for me).\n Alternative strategies are to put something like (load-file \"config.el\") in init.el, and tangle config.org manually or on save.\n Just curious how you all are using your literate org config file, and whether there is anyone who was able to solve/avoid the issue with org that I'm having (I could stick to the built-in version, but I would like to be able to use the latest version).\n    submitted by    /u/fast-90  \n [link]   [comments]",

I know, there are a lot, but I think those are important because that kind of posts drove my decisions in the past.\n I move constantly between editors (Vim => Emacs => Neovim => Emacs => Neovim => Vscode (1 day) => Neovim => ...). The only thing that is nonnegotiable is modal editing.\n Last time I switched from Emacs because of the **huge** amount of time it takes to open (no, I do not like emacsclient). IIRC, it was taking 8s to start in my machine. Hence, I migrate to Neovim and Lua.\n Neovim is a fantastic project! Lua will bring it to a new level! However, I started to miss a GUI and some polished tools I had in Emacs. All GUIs in Neovim are almost a terminal in a graphical application. It really does not add something new. Furthermore, since Lua integration is relatively new, I often find some rough edges. 99% can be fixed relatively easily. However, I just do not have time anymore to tweak my configuration as I had back in the day.\n So, I heard about gccemacs and tried again. WOW! That's a game changer!\n After 20 min compiling everything shipped with Doom emacs by default (yes, this is the bad side of the tradeoff), Emacs starts in less than 2s. It is even faster than my Neovim with all plugins. So, if anyone quit Emacs because of performance, give it one more try. Just do not mind the initial compilation time...\n Finally, I just want to thanks the amazing job of u/hlissner, Doom Emacs is amazing and you can use it out-of-the-box.

Since elisp and common lisp are both in the same family, i was wondering how difficult would it be to compile the elisp libraries in emacs into common lisp, load them into an sbcl image, and obtain emacs with native compilation built in. \n This could be further interfaced with other common lisp projects like Nyxt to provide further functionality. Would something like this be feasible?\n    submitted by    /u/fabio_grosso  \n [link]   [comments]",

I would like to get a take from the community on my situation here.\n I'm approaching middle age and have always tried to use ergonomic tools & techniques and yet I am developing RSI. My right hand is particularly bad. I have an appointment with my doctor to have a chat about it, but I am pretty sure that contorting my thumbs/hands in general to hit the meta/ctrl/shift keys have not helped me.\n I have enjoyed some modal editing in my journey. My current favorite packages for that are Meow & god-mode. I honestly have not decided which I like better but both \"de-chord\" my commands. Meow does this with a \"keypad\" mode that is for all intents and purposes a leader key. This adds 1 additional key press in exchange for no modifiers. Meow has better text navigation, overall god-mode reduces key-presses much more dramatically.\n I am also considering learning/training myself to use both hands at all times and avoid pressing 2 keys with one hand at any given time. This only gets dicey with 3 key chords (like C-M-/M-S-/C-S/-).\n I'm trying to get a sense of which is the best course of action here. Heck, maybe I should do both?\n EDIT: You all have been amazing.

          "description": "Hello. I would like to ask whether it is possible to speed up the first GTK3 frame creation (not `init.el` loading)\n Background: Emacs 28.1 with GTK3 on ArchLinux (Awesome WM) and Ubuntu 20.04 (Gnome 3.36), both with Xorg. The config is on GitHub. On both machines the startup time for a non daemon Emacs UI instance is roughly the same and fluctuates between 0.46-0.55 seconds (depending on machine load perhaps, not sure), measured by `emacs-init-time`. The same measurement when opening a frame created from daemon (by `systemd`, but it shouldn't matter) or in terminal is 0.104 sec. When using `emacs -Q` it is 0.319 sec.\n So, although the startup times are fine, I anyway would like to find a way to lessen the time it takes to draw a GTK3 frame which is roughly 0.3 sec. as far as I understand (this is by simply calculating the difference between non-daemon UI init time and a daemon one). \n Why? Because I want it faster and because the frame flickers when it is drawn :)\n So, basically this is not about the speed of `init` loading, but UI drawing (although I will gladly accept suggestions to speed up the init as well [the config is in the works, I choose not to use `use-package`, but instead to employ manual tweaks]).\n Is it even possible to lessen this time?

The final exported html should be something like this:\n {% extends 'base.html' %} {% load static %} {% block content %} <div class=\"blah\"> ...blah ... </div> {% endblock %} \n Now, I can easily use #+begin_export html in the beginning of my file to include the header tags. However, I'm unable to include the bottom liquid tag in the correct hierarchy, as Org export automatically adds a closing </div> after the included liquid tag. A minimal example:\n #+title: My website #+OPTIONS: toc:nil html-style:nil num:nil html-scripts:nil html-preamble:nil html-postamble:nil #+begin_export html {% extends 'base.html' %} {% load static %} {% block content %} #+end_export * Welcome to my website Welcome to my small website. * Contact us Some info on how to contact us. #+begin_export html {% endblock %} #+end_export \n I know Org treats hierarchies strictly, so that is why perhaps the last html_export is added to the Contact Us section. Any ideas how to avoid that and keep this tag as the last output in the html? Thanks in advance!\n Edit : Solved, check comments!\n    submitted by    /u/ndpian  \n [link]   [comments]",

I highly recommend it.\n Note: we do have a known performance issue apparent with large files that change frequently. The fix for this will mostly happen in parsebib.\n Also, I've updated the Doom biblio module to incorporate these changes, and updated all of its packages. This remains the easiest path to have a working citar-oriented system; just turn on the biblio and vertico modules, and set some paths.\n The note API in 1.0 in turn enables a small integration extension: citar-org-roam. This is partly a demo and test of the new API, but should also be useful for users, and developers that might want to build on it. This still needs a bit of work before I submit it to MELPA; PRs welcome.\n Any questions?\n    submitted by    /u/bdarcus  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "For those who don't know, tree-sitter is \"an incremental parsing system\". What it basically means is that it provides fancy syntax highlighting by doing a thorough analysis of the code.\n Emacs has treesitter integration via the tree-sitter package. I was using tree-sitter before on neovim and it really great. Well, I'm trying to set it up in emacs and it's pure frustration.\n I've installed the package, and it says that you should also install a language pack. Well, since I was already using treesitter before, then I prefer to not have to compile the language parsers twice, so I decided to unify it in a single directory for both neovim and emacs. Making the change on neovim was a piece of cake. On emacs, I pushed to the tree-sitter-load-path list, and it seems to work... kinda. If I manually call tree-sitter-require 'python for example, it does load the language parser, it even gets listed in tree-sitter-languages. However, it doesn't get enabled, the syntax is the same.\n The variable tree-sitter-language is not getting set. Apparently tree-sitter should map each language major mode to a tree-sitter parser, but it ain't doing it for some reason. Trying to enable treesitter on a python file results in the error \"No language registered for \"python-mode\"\".\n Also what about these major modes for each language? I don't want a major mode for each language. I want emacs to open a file, recognize what it is by its extension or otherwise, and that's it. I want highlighting to be handled by treesitter, but it apparently needs to interact with these major modes (of which I need to install more if I want to support other languages) that don't really add anything to me other than bloat.

But there are two difficulties I am not getting solved.\n 1) Is it possible to turn off the display of the full path and just show the base filename in Recentf and Files-from-the-current-directory in my helm-mini-buffer? I know it is done in helm-find-files, but I cannot find a way to turn off the path when using the former two.\n 2) Helm-recentf and helm-find-files use icons, which I like, because it helps me find the right file quick and at a glance. Files-from-the-current-directory doesn't show the icons. I would love to have it consistent, as I have both in a helm-mini-buffer, Recentf and Current-directory. Do you know a way to achieve this?\n Thank you so much for any advice!\n Best regards\n Titus\n    submitted by    /u/TiMueller  \n [link]   [comments]",

One thing i havent figured out though is how to prioritize specific completions; my search-fu is failing me here. What i want is to be able to provide a list of interactive functions (I only need this for executing extended commands) that, should they be in the list of completions, should be placed first in the completion list. For example, currently if i type in sly connect, the function sly-connect isnt first, that honor goes to sly-list-connections. As there ⠀isnt any way to narrow down completion to just sly-connect without replacing the space with a hyphen, i have to add it to the list of functions i have to type literally. So, is there any way to prioritize certain completions? Or, do you have other recommendations for how to solve this issue without needing to remember specific functions?

          "description": "Hi all, I've been a long time user of Ivy and Counsel but a couple of days ago I decided to give Vertico, Embark and Consult a try. I'm very joyful with them so far, however I'm having a couple of issues: - 1. I've read that using Embark to collect a list of grep results should result in a grep-mode buffer. I used to use Ivy to produce an occur buffer which I could then edit allowing me to make changes across multiple files easily. Getting a grep-mode buffer sounded good to me as I could then use wgrep to edit these‏‏‎‏‏‎‏‏‎‏‏‎­matches directly in a similar way. However, when I collect these results (via embark-collect-live, embark-collect-snapshot or embark-export) I always end up with an embark-collect-mode buffer. I cannot see a way from here to make this a grep-mode buffer or to make changes to these matches in the same way I would in an editable occur buffer. 2. In the collected results as mentioned in the first question, if I press RET on any of these results I get the following error: Error running timer ‘consult--async-after-change’: (buffer-read-only #<buffer *Embark Collect*>). I'm currently using Emacs 28.0.50 and I use Evil mode. Any help on the above would be greatly appreciated!\n    submitted by    /u/The9thHuman  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I like the idea of only horizontally scrolling the current line, ie. (setq auto-hscroll-mode 'current-line), but it has a few quirks.\n First, if you scroll to the end of a long line, and then move to the next line, it will horizontally scroll that line, even if it easily fits on the screen. This pushes most of the short line off the left edge of the screen.\n Second, It would be nice for point to stay as far right as possible (at the left edge of the right margin) when horizontally scrolling. This would make it so point would stay a few columns from the right edge the entire time the line is horizontally scrolled. So even when moving point left, the line under point would horizontally scroll to the right until the line is no longer horizontally scrolling, then point would actually start moving toward the left edge of the screen.\n Does anyone know of such a thing? or can anyone help point me in the right direction to create a minor mode that would do this?\n    submitted by    /u/pa2ees  \n [link]   [comments]",

Adler, and Walter Benjamin among many others.\nThe focus of the book is on note making for actively producing tangible outputs (essays, papers, theses, monographs, books, etc.). …",

But there is one issue that worries me: I noticed – more than once – that some files lose their content and do have the content of other files. It happens on saving, I surmise, but I cannot confirm that yet, because so far I have always recognized it later only. Then I wonder why the filename and the title do not match anymore. Luckily, I use git and commit my whole zettelkasten daily, so it's easy to revert. Still, it's disquieting somehow and should be fixed, I guess.\nHas anyone here already noticed the same problem?",

The mental work of tranlating also introduces additional friction into the system.\nHow do you deal with this?

I'm slowly developing a sense of progress.\n      20220806 Zettelkasten Statistics\n                    ★★★★★\n        700803 Total word count\n        11801 Total link count\n        2905 Total zettel count\n                    ★★★★★\n\nI gave up on the \"Full Screen\" workflow. I couldn't get it working with my Keyboard Maestro macros. I was having no fun.\nDiscovered a minor bug in my favorite advanced search querying macro.\nMy current plans for this coming week:\nI will work all out on a minor bug in my favorite advanced search querying macro. It likely will require some more Regular Expression pixy-dust.\nReading - The Narrow Road To The Deep North by Matsuo Basho - Travel Journal\nReading - The Book Of Form And Emptiness by Ruth Ozeki - Fiction\nHere are a few of the titles of zettel I've been working on last week.\nThese, along with the migration of 55 #code-snippets, make last week a ZK-focused week. Looking back, it feels like I only spent maybe two open and enjoyably stimulating hours per day working in my ZK. By working, I mean bathing in mind-weather and writing.\nTravel Writing and Philosophy\n\n\nCognitive Behaviorism\n\n\nZettelkasting\n\n\nPoetry\n\n\nEconomics",
