          "description": "In this post I asked how a literal 1 gets interpreted as of type Num a => a. The answer was 1 is actually fromInteger 1, i.e., Haskell auto-magically considers naked 1 to be function call fromInteger 1. And since fromInteger is a method in Num etc., etc. Likewise 3.14 is actually fromRational 3.14 and so, likewise, the class system is invoked. But the types of fromInteger and fromRational are fromInteger :: Num a => Integer -> a and fromRational :: Fractional a => Rational -> a . But then ((fromInteger 1) + (fromRational 3.14)) :: Fractional a => a , which means the 1 got routed through Integer by fromInteger into playing well with Rational, deferring to Rational. How is this happening? The invocation of a class' various type instances is understood -- once a hint is given, i.e.,\n λ> :t (1 :: Int) (1 :: Int) :: Int \n but this won't work\n λ> (1 :: Integer) + (3.14 :: Rational) <interactive>:124:19-34: error: • Couldn't match type ‘Ratio Integer’ with ‘Integer’ Expected: Integer Actual: Rational • In the second argument of ‘(+)’, namely ‘(3.14 :: Rational)’ In the expression: (1 :: Integer) + (3.14 :: Rational) In an equation for ‘it’: it = (1 :: Integer) + (3.14 :: Rational) \n Once again, the hint-free, naked literals are playing nice with each other. And yes, if Haskell is subbing in fromInteger 1 for 1 and fromRational 3.14 for 3.14 then yes, the whole class system is involved. But how is this managed? Examples I've seen so far are helped by relying on type inference hints to route things to the proper from*. But naked literals, then adding \"unlike\" naked literals is a type inference that goes deeper than I can fathom. It's leveraging the class world like I can't figure out but would really like to know. It reminds of functors maybe?\n    submitted by    /u/teilchen010  \n [link]   [comments]",

The simplest form of it can be phrased in terms of functions of type Bool -> Bool -> ... -> Bool.\n Consider for example the function f x y z = (y && z) || x. Suppose I want to prove the property that \"if x is True, then the value of f x y z is independent of y and z\". In other words, \"f True is a constant function\".\n My idea for proving this property is to extend the Bool types to a kind of 3-valued logic similar to Maybe Bool, but with different semantics. You could call it, say, data Partial a = Actual a | Unknown. The semantics of Unknown follow the truth table e.g. at this Wiki link.

I've tried reading a related article about environment files, to no avail. I'm likely not proficient enough with GitHub CI to update this myself. \n Anyway, I was hoping someone had recently used GitHub Action to automatically: - build on linux, macos, and windows - upload artifacts to a GitHub Release\n I'd also be amenable to a similar setup in GitLab if that's been done, as I'm not really tied to GitHub.\n Bonus points if it supports static binaries on Windows, but not a deal breaker at all.

          "description": "First of all sorry for a long question that probably has an obvious and short answer.\n I'm working through the idea that you can get to the Comonad typeclass, and its NonEmptyList instance, just by roughly considering the analogy between a category of CoKleisli arrows and turning it into code. In other words extract is extract :: w a -> a and compose is compose :: (w a -> b) -> (w b -> c) -> (w a -> c). Now you can rearrange to get extract and duplicate, and add Functor's fmap.\n What I'm having a hard time with is that to implement compose for NonEmptyList is that if you start with a w a you can apply the first CoKleisli to get the b, but to get a w b to plug in to the next function you need to sort of conjure duplicate from thin air. Once you have duplicate you can go ahead and implement the NonEmptyList Comonad we are all familiar with, which \"duplicates\" the incoming list to its list of itself and its tails.\n The question is, isn't there a simpler, but trivial and uninteresting implementation of compose here (and hence for extend also) that instead of duplicate, simply takes the head of the NonEmptyList. As far as I can tell this implementation is also lawful as a Comonad. I am missing a satisfying way to express that the way duplicate is implemented is somehow \"the right and obvious way\".\n    submitted by    /u/justinhj  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi, I am a recent grad who has been professionally developing software in Haskell over the past two years. \n I very much enjoy developing in the language and my job in general but I am somewhat worried about my future prospects not working in a more \"mainstream\" language.\n There aren't many jobs concerning pure statically typed FP languages in my area and I would strongly prefer not to work a fully remote job. I am tied to my current location for the forseeable future. \n As a result of the above, I worry about a scenario where I would end up losing my job at some point down the road and not being able to carry my experience onto my next job as easily. Is this justified or would it not be difficult to make a switch if need be? I notice vacancies often require several years of experience in whatever programming language the company offering the job is using. My qualifications are solid for my age and I have had the opportunity to contribute to open source projects as well so I guess that might help me in such a scenario. Maybe I should look to contribute to some non-FP open source projects just in case?\n In short, the dilemma I am in is that I do not want to quit my FP job but at the same time I do not want to potentially end up in a bad spot career-wise.\n I figured it could help to have some perspective from other people about this matter and would love to hear your thoughts on it.\n    submitted by    /u/Tight_Resist_7614  \n [link]   [comments]",

You're doing Haskell, people already know you're clever -- you don't have to write it on their noses (Swedish proverb)\n  \nI don't think I'm alone in doing things this way.

MyEntity a -> Maybe (MyEntity 'TypeOne) filterOnes x@(MyEntityOne {}) = Just x filterOnes _ = Nothing \n The thing is, I'm finding writing this sort of case a bit tedious, and it would be much nicer to have something like this:\n  filterOnes = filterFor @'TypeOne -- or, even better myFilter :: forall a.

          "description": "Hello everyone! I've got some exciting news to share.\n Earlier this year, I've released the first version of HVM, a massively parallel functional runtime that aims to be the ultimate target for pure functional languages like Haskell, Elm, Kind and many others, and finally unleash the inherent parallelism of the functional paradigm. HVM's first version was very limited; it could only parallelize algorithms that recursed in a perfect binary tree fashion, it lacked IO and had some synchronization bugs. Soon, we'll be releasing an updated version, which fixes these bugs, includes IO primitives, and a new workstealing-based scheduler, which is capable of generalizing to basically any functional program that isn't inherently sequential. For example, it can use all cores on the computation of Fib(n), achieving maximal performance!\n The most exciting news, though, is that a GPU runtime is on the works. I've just, right now, finished the very initial prototype, a self-contained, 1200-LOC file that evaluates a busy recursive function on the GPU. It is performing about 680 million rewrites/second on 4096 cores of my Laptop RTX 3080. That's 4x more than single-thread performance, on the very first attempt of the very first prototype. I believe we'll soon be reaching record benchmarks on GPUs. Several API improvements and stability features will also be included on the upcoming update.\n We're ahead of very exiting times for functional programming, and I hope this encourages language developers to target the HVM! Imagine a working STG->HVM compiler? We're also interested in hiring a CUDA professional to help us profile and improve the GPU back-end. If you know someone who'd be interested, please let me know via DM! And be welcome to visit our Discord community and ask anything on the #HVM channel.\n    submitted by    /u/SrPeixinho  \n [link]   [comments]",

Actually maybe I'm just reinventing some existing wheel, but I've never seen it used.\n For example:\n class Encoding a where encode :: a -> String \n Now I have to do:\n instance Encoding (a, b) where encode (a, b) = encode a <> encode b instance Encoding (a, b, c) where encode (a, b, c) = encode a <> encode b <> encode c -- and so on until the limit of either tuple size or patience is reached \n You can see code like this across endless number of libraries, including base\n Why cannot I instead have something like this:\n instance Encoding (a, b) where encode (a, b) = encode a <> encode b instance Encoding (..., b) where encode (a@..., b) = encode a <> encode b \n Never mind the specific syntax, it can be whatever, but the idea is to define instance for all tuple sizes recursively.\n Is it maybe possible already?\n That would also require (and allow) some size-polymorphic operations to add/split the first/last tuple elements, in a type safe way.\n I've no idea why it doesn't already exist.\n    submitted by    /u/epoberezkin  \n [link]   [comments]",

We're currently covering higher order functions, and our professor wants us to write a function that acts as a form of simple memory storage. Here's the part of the assignment that's stumping me:\n -- We'll consider a different way to represent memory. Memoryf is a function from variable names to values. type Memoryf = String -> Int -- The function memf1 gives all variables the value of zero memf1 = \\_ -> 0 -- The following commands use the function putValue to modify our memory function: memf2 = putValuef \"z\" 3 memf1 memf3 = putValuef \"y\" (-2) memf2 memf4 = putValuef \"x\" 1 memf3 -- putValue should take three arguments: -- 1. The name of a variable, x -- 2. The variable value m -- 3. A Memoryf function -- putValue should assign x to m and return the updated Memoryf function putValue :: String -> Int -> Memoryf -> Memoryf putValue x m memf = _________________________ -- Write your code here -- Example output: -- (putValue \"x\" 5 memf4) \"x\" -- 5 \n My thinking is that calling putValue should add something to the effect of \"if memf x is called, return m\" but I have no idea how to write this. The furthest I've gotten is:\n putValue :: String -> Int -> Memoryf -> Memoryf putValue x m memf = (\\x -> m) \n which is useless because it will return the value of m for any variable, and thus doesn't work as a store of value.\n I'd greatly appreciate any guidance y'all have to offer.

As advertised, effectful makes it easy to adapt libraries to be used as effects.\n Also, the Monocle project has moved to effectful.\n If anyone was skeptical about effectful, maybe that'll convince you to give it another look.

It doesn't seem a coincidence that 2 most popular languages - JavaScript and Python - make it really easy to integrate with JSON.\n - make cross-platform compilation \"manageable\" (including mobile and web), not just \"possible\".\n - solve problem of compiled binary size - it should be at least 5x, better 10x smaller – even if it comes at cost of 10x longer compilation time (so that we would only use it for production builds).\n - at the same time, make interpreted tests execution simpler - I still can't figure out how to do it, waiting for several minutes until it builds with most cores idling is very time consuming... Maybe this is a solved problem, and there is a simple answer how to do it.\n - make networking and cryptography more trustworthy - with exodus of some maintainers into Rust-land they are at risk of abandonment – I will share more comments on this subject a bit later.\n ​\n These are all issues that Haskell Foundation and community can help solving, we could chip in some time/money too if there is some concerted effort.\n    submitted by    /u/epoberezkin  \n [link]   [comments]",

How could x be in the domain of the substitution, but not be in scope?\n  \nHowever, the authors do not elaborate much further due to space constraints.\n I'm trying to understand what they meant by this comment. Although I can fabricate inputs that produce the scenario they describe, I'm not sure what concrete example would lead to that input, nor why it's important to handle it the way they do.\n Also, the paper only shows two cases of their substitution algorithm that handles lambdas. Do we fall through to the second case if we fail the guard of the first case (i.e., when we match on a lambda introduces a variable already in-scope)?

          "description": "This past month I've been working on implementing my first OOP language with Haskell .. implementing the syntax and context analysis was very easy for me because I'm very aware of the fact that we build parsers using stateful monads using one of the already available libraries (like parsec for example)... so that went easy after defining the context-free grammars that is not left-recursive, and then implementing the parsec-functions to every non-terminating symbol in the grammars... so that went easy with no hiccups... \n But after I dived into the context analysis that's where shit hit the fan.. it seemed that my programming model has either been very bad or I'm a bad software-engineer because functions started to become very ugly due to many parameters that are passed to the functions, and many other reasons that I don't how to start to explain, but in summary whatever makes haskell beautiful I managed to make it very ugly and complicated with my architecture design..\n So my question is: we already have stateful monads and parsers like parsec as an architectural model to implement the syntax analysis and context analysis. Are there also standardized models to implement the other steps in compilers like the context analysis? Is there literature that answers this question in regard to Haskell?\n Edit: while implementing the context analysis I became very aware of the fact that need zippers because I needed to be very aware ot the context of every variable and method which then I did and made the job much easier, so maybe that's part of the answer that I'm seeking?\n    submitted by    /u/Suitable_Use_2730  \n [link]   [comments]",

The problem actually does not seem to be the calls to pthread, but the way I read the rrd_context_t in Haskell (i.e. the peek). I changed my test to simply call the raw functions in C and look at the returned pointer address. That works ok and I do not get a null pointer. So I guess it has to be the peek which triggers the segmentation fault.\n This also happens when I simply call rrd_new_context which according to the C code ( https://github.com/oetiker/rrdtool-1.x/blob/2db8afce06e64f86133fae21b7b6b730df540293/src/rrd_error.c#L121) only does a malloc and then returns the pointer.\n So either the memory pointed to is already taken away from my process (not sure what the proper wording is here) or my Storable instance is broken.\n    submitted by    /u/thomasbach  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "There's a bad dynamic in America's STEM education where kids going into college computer science out of high school hit a brick wall . . . largely made of math they've never seen before. In general, CS is not at all what they thought it would be. Then they switch/flunk out. So if higher-ed physics, engineering, math has a long, gentle preparatory on-ramp in K-12 with math, comp-sci has absolutely nothing -- or maybe just some \"learn to code.\" And so I've been trying to put together a high-school-level on-ramp for real CS . And I'm basing it on Haskell. Why Haskell? Because the top-tier schools all do some sort of typed functional programming eventually. Functional seems to be the fault line between the top schools and the 2nd-tier. So for example I mix in discrete math with Haskell. You could say I'm high-school-izing the Doets, van Eijck text The Haskell Road to Logic, Maths, and Programming. Or even the Paulson ML for the Working Programmer, another fantastic book. Great, you might say. Trouble is I'm all alone -- as far as I know. For example, if you look at the AP Computer Science stuff, it's basically learn to program Java with a smattering of data structures and algorithms tacked on. Not really much help for a kid walking into Cornell or CMU. Every high school effort I've come across so far has hardly ever been more than \"learn to code,\" typically Python. So my question to you is, should I keep going -- or give it up for a bad job? Am I really on to something, or am I tilting at windmills? The fact that I'm so alone on this is ominous. I've contacted lots of big name professors -- and they're sympathetic but in the long run apathetic simply because they're awash in 96th-percentile applicants. Yeah....

I come from a math background so I thought it'd be fun to implement some theorems in abstract algebra in Haskell. From what I understand, there are classes of functions in Haskell like <> for example which represents an associative operation. What I'd really like is to implement a homomorphism type that sends f (x * y) to f(x) * f(y). The trouble I am having is that in mathematics we will always demand a proof that a map is a homomorphism before we give it its status as one. Is this not the case in Haskell? In other words, do we need to manually check that an operation is a homomorphism or is there some way for Haskell to recognize one (perhaps with a bit of assistance from the programmer/type system/something else)?\n    submitted by    /u/No_News_3567  \n [link]   [comments]",

When with effect systems and asynchronous stuff in general(eg NodeJs which only has 1 thread) where you have n threads to handle a much bigger m of concurrent connection you dont have that. And generally its a good thing cause what you do is essentially keep a queue of things to do trading memory and latency for the ability to handle any number of connection up to the limits of you your systems resources. You latency rises but you dont return 500s. Up to the point where you die.\n And I dont see how IO and Resource would help you with now dying when IO(and to be fair Futures) is the thing that enables such a problem\n    submitted by    /u/lionflzcfxpcuugdsh  \n [link]   [comments]",

Limitation is that I can only use a KTable and if the key is an even number I don't need to merge the payload. Additionally, the order of incoming messages should not change the result.\n ​\n For example, if we have an empty topic and incoming messages are:\n ​\n 1: { key: \"1\", value: {refNo:1, payload:{data1}} }\n 2: { key: \"2\", value: {refNo:1, payload:{data2}} }\n 3: { key: \"3\", value: {refNo:2, payload:{data3}} } // this one should be not effected and left how it is\n ​\n Expected result:\n ​\n 1: { key: \"1\", value: {refNo:1, payload:{data1, data2}} }\n 2: { key: \"2\", value: {refNo:1, payload:{data2}} }\n 3: { key: \"3\", value: {refNo:2, payload:{data3}} }\n ​\n The only way I can think of to do this is to use two times .groupBy and join with the original topic everything again.\n ​\n  \nFirst change the key to refNo, save the key to the value itself, and join the payload during aggregation.\n Secondly .groupBy revert key to the initial state.\n The last step joins everything to the original topic because I lost one message during grouping by.\n  \n​\n I'm pretty sure there's an easier way to do this. What is the most optimized and elegant way to solve this issue?\n ​\n Thank you in advance.\n    submitted by    /u/invzbl3  \n [link]   [comments]",

Now if your other project doesn't use SQL but they need your core object it will drag all the libraries with it.\n If you separate out the core domain class into a submodule that doesn't contain any dependencies, then you can import that to other projects, but then it's suddenly not package-by-feature. Or can we achieve a hybrid model where the core object is separate and then all the rest, SQL, HTTP, API, JSON are in one other module that is the app.\n    submitted by    /u/EloZash  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm not new to the JVM; I've done previous work in Java (1.6/Android) and spent a large chunk of time writing Clojure. My previous work has been in Haskell, which I liked. I guess my question is: Is Scala worth it now? I have a larger Java codebase I'll be integrating with, and I get to choose what JVM technologies to use, and other folks have expressed interest in Scala as well. I'd feel guilty for pushing Clojure on them, just because I know it, but I've also been there and done that, and I like types now. Coming from Haskell, are there functional libraries I should build upon but allow for escape hatch style mutability for some of my not so functional teammates? We're a small team, and pedagogy will be a part of the gig. I'm looking for honest opinions of the language and what essential reading material/libraries would be for someone more comfortable with FP in general. I'm not opposed to pragmatism either; it's one thing I like about Scala. It seems like there's a lot of excellent libraries because of the existing JVM ecosystem.

I’ve read the docs and few blogposts, but still not capable to write it myself. \n I’m looking for small Scala 3 exclusive (mixing it with 2 makes much harder to distinguish) projects with use of metaprogramming where I can learn more and perhaps contribute.

My goal for this project is to make \"CSS in PureScript\" more practical for real-world use cases, meaning: * Extensive type-level validation * Minimal syntactic overhead * Broad CSS coverage * Alignment with W3C specifications * Exhaustive testing\n If you're interested to take a look, a good place to start might be the Zen Garments example, adapted from Dan Mall's CSS Zen Garden submission in order to assess the library's CSS coverage.\n From there, you might like to see some examples of CSS errors that will fail to compile. Some of these issues are significantly more complicated than e.g. providing a <length-percentage> value where a <length> was expected (although those cases are covered too).\n Hopefully the next step would be to try it out for yourself, using the large test suite as a reference wherever the (WIP) docs currently fall short.\n I am looking forward to any feedback you might have to offer! I would also like to note that contributions are welcome, so please let me know if you are interested via Twitter or [email](mailto:nick@saunde.rs); or, if you have something specific in mind already, just review the contributing guidelines and then open an issue.\n Thanks for reading!\n    submitted by    /u/nsaunders1  \n [link]   [comments]",

My friend and I manage a small business together and want an interface to create and assign tasks that we can mutually access and modify. I'm very familiar with Org Mode but initially thought I'd not force that upon my partner, but, well, obviously org mode is just the best so nothing else will do so I immediately gave up on that idea. The more I thought about it the more handy I thought it'd be to just do this in org mode, naturally. \n I'm familiar with using a terminal emulator on Android / iOS and Syncthing to sync my org files.

E.g. \"Date/[Home|Work]/Habit/Successes\".\n Turning the tree inside out to follow the day by day progress for one of experiments would be very helpful. As well as tracking the daily successes in the second example.\n Is there a built-in feature or packages or a known workflow for such case?\n Like best practice(s) for such data organization, turning the outline inside out, making different OLAP-like views into the outline?\n thanks :)\n    submitted by    /u/Zestyclose-Painter-3  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "A thought occurred to me today while I was getting ready, mentally preparing. I realized that I was feeling a bit stressed about the day but that the thought of my todo and agenda buffers had a calming effect. I thought to myself, \"it's alright, you're organized and at least if there is chaos it is somewhat documented chaos and you don't have to hold it all in your mind.\"\n Last weekend, I took the time to do a much needed cleanup of my init.el file. I got rid of all the cruft of comments, things I'd tried but given up though not yet deleted. I made a move to using straight.el as my package manager. I switched from Ivy to Helm. I just did some things I'd been meaning to do for a while. I cleaned up my todo file and recommitted to using 'C-c a a' more throughout the day.\n I assume that many of you, like me, find a certain \"gee, that's neat\" quality to getting some of this working. A sense of satisfaction maybe. I like learning new ways to do things, maybe cleaner, tighter. But the thing that I keep coming back to even more than all that is that this technology, this nerdy system, has a way of calming me and making me feel better. It feels like the world has more and more information each day, more chaos, etc. Using org-mode helps me live in the world.\n I was curious to see if any of you have had similar thoughts about it?\n    submitted by    /u/kregerator  \n [link]   [comments]",

Thank you all for your help\n Edit: I've found in the manual a workaround (which is actually the official combo key for the action I was looking for) by using C-c C-k. That key combo will expand all subtrees of a headline, recursively. To close the main headline back, I'll use za.\n Sadly, default vim z operations in evil-org look not working. E.G. zO is supposed to perform the operation I was looking for, or zr doesn't open one subtree at a time.\n Edit 2: In the lang: org README file from Doom Emacs I see that this behavior was intentional and that can be reversed.\n  \n TAB was changed to toggle only the visibility state of the current subtree, rather than cycle through it recursively.

My own (planned at this point) system would be to highlight passages in texts and paraphrase them in org-roam nodes.\n M-x highlight seems like the key here - is those highlights something I can reference from org-roam?\n bddean's ereader and nov.el look appealing, especially with nov-xwidget.el for formatting on the latter.\n Should I spend time exploring both of these, or am I missing the point?\n jk :w\n    submitted by    /u/thephatmaster  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Howdy. It would be much easier for me to do my note-taking if org-roam-node-find had the following behavior: - Pressing TAB changes the text in the search bar to whatever the suggestion list has highlighted. I'd like it to just replace the entire thing instead of doing that default step-by-step completion if possible. - Pressing ENTER opens or creates the exact match of what's entered in the org-roam-node-find search bar. \n Currently, I'm having some issues. My PKM note hierarchy uses dots as delimiters. Take the note res.lore.sw as an example (my note about Star Wars). I created it first. Now I want to create res.lore as an index for all the lores I've written about, but org-roam-node-find won't let me create it, because it matches with the Star Wars note and opens it. I'd instead like to be able to either press TAB to set the highlighted file as the new search, or press ENTER to open or create the exact note id entered into the search bar.\n My current org-roam config is pretty much the minimum:  (use-package org-roam :ensure t :init (setq org-roam-v2-ack t) :custom (org-roam-directory \"REDACTED\") (org-roam-complete-everywhere t) (org-roam-capture-templates '((\"d\" \"default\" plain \"%?\" :if-new (file+head \"${title}.org\" \"#+title: ${title}\\n#+date: %U\\n\") :unnarrowed t))) :config (org-roam-setup) (org-roam-db-autosync-mode)) \n    submitted by    /u/Tristan401  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Has anyone gotten this to work? So far I used a hydra including this snippet to resize windows. As many others I wanted to try out transients for my keybindings. In particular I liked that I could use an infix toggle state to switch between windmove and resizing using the same keys (I guess I could also bind the toggling key to switch back and forth between different hydras too). I have used the same functions as the hydra in the link. Namely these:\n  (defun hydra-move-splitter-left (arg) \"Move window splitter left.\" (interactive \"p\") (if (let ((windmove-wrap-around)) (windmove-find-other-window 'right)) (shrink-window-horizontally arg) (enlarge-window-horizontally arg))) \n The resizing more often then not fails however, because the transient window in and on itself is fixed-size and does allow neither explicit, nor implicit resizing. So every Splitter that touches the transient can't move and the command fails silently.

          "description": "I'm a big Emacs fan and have loved using it for years but can't help but think there's a lot of jankiness in various language modes.\n Syntax highlighting in general is slow. Tree Sitter is an interesting potential replacement and I got it working with some languages but I got lost trying to install a language manually - ex vue tree sitter.\n Indentation can be unexpected. For example, say you are a PHP developer and you decide to try Emacs. The first thing you'd do is install some sort of PHP support, right? So you'd likely go to php-mode.\n  \nThis is how php-mode highlights and indents my code by default.\n On VS Code, here is how it indents and formats the same code almost out of the box. Just had to install the PHP formatter. Just works.\n So then on your Emacs PHP journey you'd try to look for a better mode so you'd install web-mode and be happy because it formats it as expected. But I've experienced situations where web-mode would format in an unexpected way or syntax highlighting bugs out so I'd have to re-run M-x web-mode.\n  \nI seem to experience this a lot. A language mode that's just has the janky kind of feel. I also wish there was more of a standard in how things were done. As an example, several language modes define their own variable for tab width. I do understand this is a project that's been around since the 80s so cruft is to be expected.\n    submitted by    /u/PrayForGains  \n [link]   [comments]",

I've looked into it before and I know different people used them differently but the impression I got was that your feet are too slow and too desynced from your hands to make it worthwhile (at least without significant practice). \n My motivation stems from my left hand getting pretty overloaded, making some sequences of C and M impractical. For example, I struggle with using binds like C-c <any key> because I tend to hold down the control while I press the next letter, so I get C-c C-<that key>. \n So my idea would be to have pedals for priming the next keystroke to have a C or an M. So I can press the Cpedal, then hit c <any key> and get C-c key. The pedal would then need to be released in order to register another C. There would be one pedal for C and one for M. \n I was wondering if anybody had any experience with foot pedals and how useful (or useless) they were in your workflow. Have you ever used footpedals? If so, what did you use them for in Emacs? Did you have any use for them outside of Emacs? Were they comfortable? \n Anything helps!\n    submitted by    /u/_ianna  \n [link]   [comments]",

However, now that I have collected several months of data for all my exercises, I wish to produce a graph of my progress for each of the headings and I am unsure how to do this in the same fitness.org file since I recorded my data as csv instead of in an org table. In addition, I was also wondering how to plot the same data from multiple headings into a single graph using my above format? I am curious to see what others are doing and if there is a better way to track performance that can sync with my files on my computer while being in a format that is easy to work with.\n    submitted by    /u/waterstrider123  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I've been thinking it'd be nice to have this feature, and it shouldn't be too hard to implement. But before I go and start working on it (which wouldn't be in a while, because of previous obligations), I want to check if there's already something that does this, or comes close.\n Here's the behavior I'd like: with a simple command, I can open a new buffer that shows me a \"cheatsheet\" with all the keybindings I've saved before, along with their command-name and a brief description.\n Additional nice features would be:\n  \nability to group keybindings by modes\n ability to filter by the current active mode(s), so that only keys/commands related to it are shown\n ability to save keybindings interactively\n ability to save keybindings easily from a mode's keymap. Something like: in the *Help* buffer's description of the mode, select any commands, and save them to the cheatsheet\n  \nOften it is enough to do a quick describe-mode to find the name of the function I'm looking for, but I think this feature could be particularly helpful for major modes like magit or org, which can have quite complex keymaps. It could also help people who are just starting out with Emacs.\n Do you know if a feature along these lines already exists?\n I found this cheatsheet package that comes quite close, although it lacks some of the features I'd like and (most importantly) does not automatically save cheatsheets between sessions. I haven't taken a good look at the code there yet, but I think I might use it as my starting point.\n Would people be interested in this features?

          "description": "So I've been using Gnu Emacs in the office for about two weeks now. I'm a vim user and will remain a vim user but I was challenged to try emacs by my colleagues and I in turn challenged them to try Vim. After the promised two weeks I can say the following about emacs from a vimmer perspective.\n I actually LIKE IT. I like the possibilities of emacs and the extensibility although for my workflow it doesn't offer much that vim plugins don't.\n  \nI don't like emacs PACKAGE MANAGER at all and I don't really care for lisps. I find vim script much easier. I don't like how emacs treats buffers and I find myself constantly killing extra buffers. I don't mind the emacs key bindings that much but I quickly changed the evil mode because muscle memory was killing me. \n  \nI both LOVE & HATE M-x commands! I love them cause you can discover so much about was emacs can do but I hate typing them. I REALLY like w3m in emacs! I use w3m in a terminal on a daily basis and with emacs I can just have it open in a buffer or split and do my work at the same time. \n  \nI LOVE how great emacs handles RTL languages. It is just great and looks great too.\n  \nI don't care for org mode! Yea yea I know you will hate me for saying it but I really dont care about it I prefer Vim wiki\n  \nI DON'T like the emacs terminal options that I've tested so far. K couldn't install vterm so maybe thats why\n  \nWith all that being said I will use both emacs and vim on a daily basis for different things but what would make my life easier in emacs would be if I knew a way to handle buffers more effortlessly in emacs. In vim I can ZZ out of any buffer or split. The emacs evil mode doesn't provide that by default and I couldn't map it myself in the config.\n  \nPS: I use the latest release of emacs in the Arch repos.

          "description": "While surfing around on Emacs Stack Exchange, someone commented to go look at dir-locals-set-directory-class. It has a closely associated function called dir-locals-set-class-variables.\n Base Emacs knows about projects. Projects are defined (mostly) via version control. I know about Projectile and use it as well but this is in base Emacs introduced in version 23.\n The two steps are to first set up dir local variables based upon class using dir-locals-set-class-variables. I explain why I used eval later but I did this:\n lisp (dir-locals-set-class-variables 'proj1 '((nil . ((eval . (pedz/proj1-set-default-mode-locals)))) (enh-ruby-mode . ((eval . (pedz/proj1-set-enh-ruby-mode-locals)))))) \n The second step is to tie a project (specified by its directory) to a class like this:\n lisp (dir-locals-set-directory-class \"~/Source/proj1\" 'proj1) \n And you are done. The two functions pedz/proj1-set-default-mode-locals and pedz/proj1-set-enh-ruby-mode-locals will be called based upon the mode of the file being visited within the project. And they are also called for such things as compile buffers and other buffers not visiting files within the project based upon default-directory. Those functions can set variables, enable modes, etc.\n So... you are asking Why not just use .dir-locals.el?\n The answer is because of risky variables. I now have three variables that end with program which are (properly) considered risky that need to be set in this project and it isn't possible to type ! and tell Emacs \"Yes... those variables for this directory are ok. Please don't pull on my shirt tail again about this.\". Rather, each new file that is opened, it will ask if those variables are ok to be set.\n And I totally get why. It is unsafe to just set those variables based upon something that may or may not be under your control. But your init files are (or should be) under your control. So, I've moved all of the project specific settings into my init files.\n    submitted by    /u/pedzsanReddit  \n [link]   [comments]",

And something I have come to realise is that a lot of stuff could be implemented really fast by sending arbitrary key sequences. \n Keyboard macros seem limited to me : they look more like a succession of commands than a succession of keys.\n Two examples I could not achieve with macros (maybe I'm doing it wrong)\n - Prepare a command : for example I want to prepare a call to isearch, with foo pre-typed into the minibuffer. When I do it the macro way, the macro will execute the command isearch foo\n - Define an alias for partial key-bindings : let's say I want to alias C-x r to C-r, so that i can type C-r t instead of C-x r t (which is bound to #'string-rectangle). I could not make a keyboard macro work since C-x r is not bound to anything\n Is there anyway to send arbitrary key sequences to the emacs interpreter from elisp ?\n ​\n Thanks !\n    submitted by    /u/Horrih  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I'm looking for a way to bypass org-agenda dispatcher (unsure about the terminology here: I'm talking about the buffer you get immediately upon calling org-agenda), and thought of a simple way of doing it. \n (defun my/org-agenda () (interactive) (setq my/agenda-views nil) (dolist (cmd org-agenda-custom-commands) (add-to-list 'my/agenda-views (cons (car (cdr cmd)) (car cmd)))) (let ((view (cdr (assoc (completing-read \"Select an agenda view: \" my/agenda-views) my/agenda-views)))) (org-agenda nil view nil))) \n That worked just fine, but I thought it'd be nice to be able to pass restrictions (to buffer, subtree, etc.) to the function, perhaps using C-u as a prefix for a buffer restriction and C-u C-u for a subtree restriction. So I figured this should work: \n (defun my/org-agenda-restr (&optional arg) (interactive \"P\") (when arg (org-check-for-org-mode)) (setq my/agenda-views nil) (dolist (cmd org-agenda-custom-commands) (add-to-list 'my/agenda-views (cons (car (cdr cmd)) (car cmd)))) (let ((restr (cond ((equal arg '(4)) 'buffer) ((equal arg '(16)) 'subtree))) (view (cdr (assoc (completing-read \"Select an agenda view: \" my/agenda-views) my/agenda-views)))) (org-agenda nil view restr))) \n But it doesn't. For some reason, no matter which custom view I try to call, I get a CRM prompt asking me to choose a keyword. \n Now, I thought maybe I was passing the wrong type of object as the third argument for org-agenda, So I tested using this, and it looks like what I'm passing as the third argument is a symbol, which I thought is what it wanted: \n (defun my/test (&optional arg) (interactive \"P\") (let ((restr (cond ((equal arg '(4)) 'buffer) ((equal arg '(16)) 'subtree)))) (when (symbolp restr) (message \"Yes\")))) \n So I'm going wrong somewhere, but cannot figure out where.\n    submitted by    /u/graduale  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I'd like to have a completing-read type command that can perform commonly used file moving/copying operations. For example, I'm constantly syncing a couple of projects to a remote machine where they run. Currently I bind a key for each one to an rsync shell command call like so:\n (defun myprojectA-sync () (interactive) (shell-command (concat \"rsync -a --progress --exclude-from='~/myprojectA/.syncignore' ~/myprojectA/ remotemachine1:~/myprojectA/ && echo 'Done.'\")))) (map! :leader :desc \"Sync my project A from local machine\" \"c b\" #'myprojectA-sync) \n It'd be helpful to have one single command to call a completion list that can run the pre-defined file operations for Project A, B, C, etc. I don't see why they couldn't act on multiple machines (remotemachine1, remotemachine2, etc.) or use different commands (mv, scp, rsync, etc.).\n Is there some feature/package that already exists to do something like this? \n If not, does anyone have suggestions for a novice in elisp when it comes to writing the function? My thoughts so far were just a bunch of lists like\n (setq sync-names '(\"Sync project A\" \"Sync project B\")) (setq sync-method '(\"rsync\" \"scp\")) (setq sync-dest-dir '(\"remotemachine1:~/dir1\" \"remotemachine2:~/otherdir\")) \n to call shell-command wrapped in competing-read.\n    submitted by    /u/tdstoff7  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I've been using emacs to write tex documents for a long time, and recently switched to spacemacs, with evil mode. I use the reftex command reftex-reference to insert \\ref commands. In spacemacs evil mode, when I use this, the reference is inserted *before* the cursor (point), so that it's off by one character. I would like to know if it's possible to configure this to insert after. I'm asking here because I think this is a general evil-mode issue rather than a specific spacemacs configuration issue. Details below.\n Here's what happens:\n Have a tex file with some text like the following, with the cursor at the rectangle marker, and with the buffer in evil's \"normal state\" (like vim's normal mode), not insert mode.\n \\begin{theorem}\\label{mylabel} theorem text \\end{theorem} Now some words▮ \n Note that this is what happens when there's a space *after* \"words\" in the text; in evil's normal state, the cursor is a block that occupies the position of a character.\n Then I use the reftex-reference command and select \"mylabel\". The inserted text I get is\n Now some words\\ref{mylabel}▮ \n with the inserted \\ref *before* the trailing space. Then the space appears *after*. I believe the line that actually does the inserting is line 510 of reftex-ref.el.\n ​\n To be clear, this is not because the final character is a space. If I delete the space after \"words\", positioning my cursor on the final \"s\", then the inserted reference looks like\n Now some word\\ref{mylabel}s \n with the cursor positioned on the final \"s\".\n ​\n So, the problem seems to be that reftex-reference is doing the insertion on the *left* side of the \"normal state\" cursor, not the right. I would like it to insert on the right. Does anyone here know how this can be configured?\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/EVenbeRi  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I guess this is a rhetorical question because I doubt anyone knows why but it turns out that dired buffers return nil for buffer-file-name instead of the path to the directory they are viewing.\n I believe this has cost me a ton of time but I did learn a lot along the way. lsp-docker highest level function is lsp-docker-start. It calls lsp-workspace-root which calls buffer-file-name which, if starting from a dired buffer, returns nil so lsp-workspace-root returns nil and the LSP server is not started.\n This is my first venture into LSP mode and I was doing something slightly different, a basic low level function was returning nil, so I assumed I was way off track in my set up, and I needed to dig deeper. And, indeed, I came up with a solution. I was documenting what I had found for myself so I wouldn't forget and started asking myself more questions.\n I went back and tested lsp-workspace-root in a file that had LSP mode enabled and it returned the proper path for the workspace. I then restarted everything, loaded lsp-mode but didn't start it, and went to the directory of the project. Sure enough, lsp-workspace-root returned nil (as it had before). I then looked at the code and started to try and follow it step by step. That's when I discovered that dired buffers have no buffer-file-name. I opened TAGS (an arbitrary file within the project) and now lsp-workspace-root returns the proper workspace.\n I think I could have set up my LSP stuff with a simple YAML file had I tried lsp-docker-start from a file rather than a dired buffer and saved the time spent coming up with the solution I pointed to.\n Anyhow... live and learn I guess.\n    submitted by    /u/pedzsanReddit  \n [link]   [comments]",

I initially found it in google but now, since I know it exists, how can I quickly find info about this param directly in emacs? For example I want to find a manual page where this param is mentioned. Is there anything like apropos-EVERYTHING command that will look for a word (or regex) in all documentation? \n Even more. I now know that info about :narrow param for clock table can be found in org manual on a page called The clock table. I know it from google. How could I find this page using emacs? \n How would you find that page in emacs manual?\n P.S. I know about describe-* and apropos-* (and info) functions but I don't see any function that does the search across everything. There are also similar questions in the internet and there is a suggestion to search the documentation with grep or zgrep which I don't find useful.

In the screenshot, you can see my 'old' self compiled Emacs (28.1) and my new Emacs (28.2) installed via Guix. They render the same text in the same file, in the same theme, with the same font (as per M-x describe-font), but they look quite different.\n Here's a screenshot showing the two side by side: https://screenshots.200ok.ch/screenshot_2022_10_26-a7bdddc0.png\n The version to the left is quite thin, the weight seems off. However, the weight is the same. Changing the weight will not remove this discrepancy. \n Both Debian and Guix have the bold variant of Fira installed: https://screenshots.200ok.ch/screenshot_2022_10_26-36be0060.png\n Generally speaking, the bold variant works insofar that I can use it globally: https://screenshots.200ok.ch/screenshot_2022_10_26-5620acc4.png\n However, when used in a font-face, it won't become bold: https://screenshots.200ok.ch/screenshot_2022_10_26-bb7ddfd5.png\n I'm happy if anyone can point me to the necessary change to make the new install look the same as before.

Maybe these kinds of feelings are very subjective, but I feel like this one might generalize to others experiences well.\n By default they are bound to `C-x <left>` and `C-x <right>`.\n Feel free to also share any similar other \"wow this makes buffer management so much nicer feeling to use\" experiences you've had.\n    submitted by    /u/paretoOptimalDev  \n [link]   [comments]",

This all works fine and has for years.\n Except that I find that I suddenly have to deal with email hosted on office365. It does IMAP, so I can read my mail, but it warns\n `Notice: far side store does not support flag(s) 'P'; not propagating.`\n The consequence of this is that the changes I make locally aren't reflected on the server. Refiling or deleting mail doesn't have any effect. That means my INBOX is just going to grow and grow and grow and eventually that's going to be a problem. (Nevermind that if I decide to peek at my mail from my phone or something, it's going to be a confusing mess.)\n In a previous life, I managed with davmail, but dear $DEITY in heaven, I'd really rather not have to do that again.\n Anyone know if mbsync (or the office365 account) can be configured to make things Work Right(TM)?\n    submitted by    /u/ndw  \n [link]   [comments]",

Is there some special configuration for it to work?\n    submitted by    /u/Tohiko  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "In my config https://github.com/vidbina/dotfiles/tree/reorg-for-lit-prog/emacs#-text you may spot that I use visual-fill-column-mode and adaptive-wrap-mode to improve the readability of text in Emacs.\n ⚠️ The gotcha is that I sometimes have bits of context that I want to exclude from being \"wrapped\" such as tables. My current UX on this is poor as I usually want to see the table fully extended while simultaneously sneaking a peak at text in the paragraphs around it. Is there a way to do this (exclude a region from being wrapped) or is there a term that describes what I'm looking for that I should factor into my web-search queries?\n 🤔 There is never really a use case where the wrapped table is even readable for me so it's just a lost piece of screen real estate when I wrap the buffer. It may as well be folded away to be conjured up through something similar to C-c C-v v where can open expanded code into a preview buffer (to see how all the noweb refs resolve). How do you deal with wrapping when tables are present? Hoping to learn what I can improve about my usage to minimize this \"pain\".\n 💡 For now I keep toggling between the wrapped and non-wrapped states and now that I'm typing this, I'm thinking that I can open a cloned frame or buffer. That way I can show the table non-wrapped or extended in one buffer, while I look at the wrapped peripheral text in a cloned buffer and thus have a way to keep the wrapped states apart. This however does alter the layout of buffers which is again a bit of a UX killer as it disturbs the y-flow of the text in the original buffer if you catch my drift.\n Looking fwd to getting schooled. Thanks for helping think along. 🙏🏿\n    submitted by    /u/vidbina  \n [link]   [comments]",

And do it for every of the languages of interest until it either works out or finally fails.\n I wasn’t able though to confirm from the elisp reference that this is possible)\n Sorry for the probable naivety of this question - I’m really not that familiar yet with Emacs internals and not speaking from arrogance here - just trying to describe my thought process trying to both explain what I need and not to overload the reader with complexities of my setup.\n Probably there is some true and very different way to solve tgis question that I’m not aware of.\n Thank you :)\n    submitted by    /u/Zestyclose-Painter-3  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm trying to set Org's org-tag-alist variable so that a directory containing all my projects can easily have the type of project categorised according to some default tags. Unfortunately, the .dir-locals.el file uses different syntax (dot notation?) to what I'm already barely used to with regular Emacs Lisp, so I'm struggling to make it work. In particular, I'm trying to get some group tags in that variable, but I'm utterly clueless because I just haven't had the time to learn Emacs Lisp yet.\n Could anyone supply a minimum working example of a .dir-locals.el snippet that adds group tags to Org mode?

I would like to try out some possible fixes: it looks like most issues are simply due to the fact that many functions are only defined for the GTK framework, and not Mac's NextStep/Cocoa framework.\n Also, if anybody wants to help out with this effort, please let me know.\n ​\n UPDATE:\n  \nif you're interested in understanding Emacs C source-code, take a look at this section of the official manual: I found the part about Writing Emacs Primitives especially helpful. Many thanks to u/7890yuiop!!!\n If you're interested in the xwidget patches I'm working on, I've created this fork of the emacs mirror.

Going through his stuff, I found a CD-R with the label \"emacs backup.\" I pop the disk into my computer; and while the computer recognizes it, it says the disk is unreadable. So I Google what emacs even is. He was into coding, and was even trying to create his own pixel art computer game thing. I figure the backup could be related to that kind of stuff.\n How do I get this CD to open? I installed emacs on my computer (I think?) and nothing changed? \n (I do realize he could have also used it as a journal. Honestly, I want answers to questions, and I'll never get them, now.

The last included commit was cbd04ad3d572850775f18bde868c71abcde733ed.\n Anyway, this build use a new \"trampolines\" target for make. This target pre-compiles (AOT) trampolines, infrastructure that allows natively compiled elisp to call redefined elisp primitives, which are then included with the installer, zip and no-deps.zip distributables. While redefining primitives is discouraged, it does happen, especially via advice APIs.\n Including these trampolines should enable installing and running (e.g.) packages that advise elisp primitives. Previously (in all 29 snapshots and GNU windows binary distributions of Emacs 28) that might have failed because Emacs unconditionally creates trampolines on the fly if they do not exist when needed. Precompiling the trampolines should prevent Emacs from triggering async native compilation even when native-comp-available-p was returning nil, to make them.\n TIA for bug reports & feedback!\n PS, in case others are building Emacs with native comp enabled and not distributing GCC/libgcc with, the new make target isn't on the Emacs 28 branch (yet). It should be fairly easy to patch it in or manually add something like this to your packaging process after success of make all, before make install (or make install-strip or whtv)\n  (mapatoms (λ (f) (when (subr-primitive-p (symbol-function f)) (or (comp-trampoline-search f) (comp-trampoline-compile f))))) \n This code comes from message #50 in bug #58318, and worked for me (however, the 29 snapshot binaries do use the new make target, now - they don't use the above snippet).\n Edit: un-mangled the code block\n    submitted by    /u/mplscorwin  \n [link]   [comments]",

For example, I can update all lsp-related package in straight.el by calling straight-pull-package and then type lsp- to get a list of completion candidates with lsp in the name. Then I call embark-act-all and pull all the selected packages.\n But it would be useful to be able to switch from an arbitrary completing-read minibuffer into completing-read-multiple via a key-press, collect multiple candidates (which don't necessarily have matching substrings), and then just run the original command for each of the selected candidates, e.g. via embark-act-all. This would be much more convenient than just running the command multiple times or what I sometimes do, mapping the function over the list in elisp (M-: (seq-map #'<command> candidates))\n I could write my own function which calls completing-read-multiple, like straight-pull-package-crm, but it would be nice if something like that would be possible from any command.

But magit has a similar repo structure, and its docs were installing fine.\n I noticed that the recipe for magit has a :files key which pulls in the doc file. Adding\n :straight (:files (:defaults \"docs/*\")) \n to my (use-package 'transient ...) form appears to do the trick - and automagically triggers a make docs command for transient somehow - but now I have two wrinkles:\n  \nstraight rebuilds transient every time I start Emacs\n I get a warning \"Warning (straight): Two different recipes given for \"transient\" (:files cannot be both nil and (:defaults \"docs/*\"))\"\n  \nThe first issue is annoying, but isn't a showstopper. I don't restart Emacs very often and my startup time is already slow.\n The second issue worries me, because I don't know whether it means that updated docs will actually get installed in the future. Presumably the clash is between my (use-package 'transient ...) and the recipe that gets used when transient is handled as a dependency of magit (which I also use). But which recipe is actually used to install transient now? Is it getting installed twice every time?\n I don't know why the transient docs aren't getting installed \"out of the box\" as they apparently are for everyone else. What might I be doing wrong?\n    submitted by    /u/quokka70  \n [link]   [comments]",

OS I recently decided to start adding some extended features and working on my config. Eventually I managed to get lastfm.el and Vuiet working together and it’s awesome! I think I’ve figured out how to make a script with new keybinds for the Vuiet stuff I need to use, but some features are broken, namely searching songs by lyrics. I’m not sure how to debug emacs scripts so if anyone has any suggestions, including a better player, I’m open. Also, I’m shopping around for a completion module, mostly for Python but also C and HTML.\n Edit:\n Vuiet is cool, but seems like a lost cause. I think the only functionality EMMS doesn’t have that Vuiet did, though, is searching by artist for stuff I don’t actually have. \n My main problem at this point is how to add an SMB share to EMMS.\n    submitted by    /u/Magicaldave918  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm doubting because all the explanations I see online or in books about that method using Zettelkästen are in the field of sociology, psychology, personal development etc., and I can see very well, why the method would be useful in those fields, where finding new ideas is a crucial part of the work done there. But I didn't find a single YouTube video or alike made by scientists about that method.\nSo I wonder, if a Zettelkasten could be useful, as well, in fields where it's much more about facts than insight.

I only know that I somehow found it online a few months ago, while researching note-taking and study skills. I'm not originally from Germany, but I live here now, so the German-sounding name 'Zettelkasten' piqued my curiosity when I first saw it.\nThe reason I was researching in the first place, is because I knew I would start studying for a Masters in October of this year. My Bachelors experience was way too ad-hoc. I just didn't have a good system. Knowing that I wanted to have a much better experience studying for a Masters, I was determined to get a good note-taking and connection-building system in place before my studies started. After some reasearch, I realized that the Zettelkasten method was what I needed, and I've been using it actively for about a month now.\nIt's still too early yet to have many links between notes, but I'm starting to build a nice network, one note at a time.\nThe forum history has already helped me, both to understand the method and to get ideas for my own personal implementation. I look forward to future learning with you.",

He seems to have a quite young Zettelkasten or at least does not make use of connection like I use. With a depth=2 a local graph by my Zettelkasten looks like this:\n\nThis is pretty typical when I browse my Zettelkasten and I am not able to get value from it. Of course, I am not practiced in using a graph view and my practice is by no means informed by a graph view. So, that could be confounders.\nSo, I find myself at a strange tension point: I really like using visual structures for my own Zettelkasten work. This is an example (actually from the book):\n\nBut whenever I run into the graph view I find myself unable to make it work.\nI am not willing to stop challenging my position on graph view yet. I have a gut feeling that there is a blind spot I am not aware of. But I am confronted with a similar issue like many people it seems: There are no genuine demonstrations out there but just mock examples. Bob's video is a very concise demonstration on how writing with a Zettelkasten can be realised. I recommend to watch it to enrich your perspective. But the youth of his Zettelkasten makes the graph view part not applicable to my own Zettelkasten.\nI filter methods and techniques by their longevity. And if the graph view cannot show its power with older and more developed Zettelkastens I don't think it is very promising to get into it. I want to concentrate my time and effort on methods and techniques that scale.\nSo, my question is: Are you aware of examples of graph view being used for more older and complex Zettelkastens?\nAdditional thought: Perhaps, the graph view is suited most to develop underdeveloped parts of the Zettelkasten?",

          "description": "At first this was gonna be a question, but I looked a little further and realized the subtleties:\nYou ever notice in the two ZKs Luhmann worked on he indexed notes in both of his boxes 1-N?\nEx. So, a card labeled 1 or 1-6 can essentially be found in both boxes.\nWhat's different, fascinatingly, is how he wrote them.\nIn his first ZK, we saw him use a comma \",\" (or in English, the period \".\") to branch his notes, but with the second one he used the slash \"/\". That way he can account for notecards 1.6 and 1/6 to co-exist in his wider note-card system.\nLuhmann probably would have changed it up if he wanted in a digital system, but I cannot blame him for taking the easy way out in that switch up. It was a good way to start over but leave no zettels behind. With that being said, even if he lived a lot longer, I'm not sure he would have opted to start a 3rd physical box.\n(Rather minor, but I wasn't sure if this fits more in \"Workflows\" or \"The Zettelkasten Method\" category. It was kind of a toss up for me.)",

I am perfectly happy to admit that I do the very thing that Chris is pointing out: My starting point it the article by Luhmann and while I am aware of the history Zettelkasten Method I never saw much practical value from reading the historical use cases.\nI, myself, am a pretty non-nostalgic character. My passion for the Zettelkasten Method is fueled by exactly two motivations:\nImproving my personal toolbox for knowledge work.\nGenerating tools to help other people to improve their toolbox.\nI see this as an advantage because I have little incentive to lose myself in tweaking tools or spending time on the tool for fun and joy (nothing wrong with that if you do because it aligns with your own goals, of course).\nThe downside of this utilitarian approach is that it creates a blind spot which can be a source of fallacies.\nSo, the question is: What did you learn from the history of the Zettelkasten Method?

The mind refers to the mental frame, while ghost is the soul of a dead person.\n\n\nIn reaction to that, I wrote the first commentary to the translation:\nThe Zettelkasten as the ethereal ghost that hides in plain sight\nIn German, \"Geist\" means both \"mind\" and \"ghost\". The question spelled out could be something like \"Can the mind of the Zettelkasten be observed?\" Or something like that. So, why \"ghost\" instead of \"mind?\"\nThere is great anime film titled \"Ghost in the Shell\". It is quite a philosophical movie that asks the question: If your consciousness can be moved from your body and brain to machine are you still considered a human or will you become a computer program? One possible answer could be: If we can move from body to body, and we are still considered human we should be considered to be ghosts that take possession of bodies.\nWhat do the visitors see when they see everything and are disappointed? Perhaps, they feel the same disappointment of scientists who opened the scull of people to look at the human mind but see \"it all\": just flabby gray tissue.\nTo this day, this seems to be the feeling us who start their own Zettelkasten. The frankensteinian fantasy of creating something alive turns into obsession or disappointment. The mind of the Zettelkasten turns into a ghost, something ethereal and evasive that can hide in plain sight. We dive into our Zettelkastens in search for what we believe we created and just seem to find notes.\nSo, what is the Zettelkasten? One possible answer might be: The ghost that is able to hide in plain sight and just can be seen from the corner of the eye.\nWhat do you think about that reasoning?",
