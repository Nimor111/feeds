My code can be found here: https://github.com/thomasbach-dev/hs-rrd/tree/context-bindings\n This is the first time I use FFI and I have not come very far. I can query the version of the library and do some calls to rrd_*_error which run but return empty results. So I'm not even sure I am missing something very basic here.\n This is what I observe: The tests in general run fine, until I enable the one defined here: https://github.com/thomasbach-dev/hs-rrd/blob/context-bindings/test/RRDTool/LowLevelSpec.hs#L41 which calls rrd_get_context. The tests simply crash then:\n $ cabal test --test-show-details=always Running 1 test suites... Test suite hs-rrd-test: RUNNING... Test suite hs-rrd-test: FAIL \n Started in a repl I get the following:\n ghci> :add *RRDTool.LowLevel Ok, two modules loaded. ghci> rrd_get_context cabal: repl failed for hs-rrd-0.1.0.0. The build process segfaulted (i.e. SIGSEGV). \n The code of rrd_get_context can be found here: https://github.com/oetiker/rrdtool-1.x/blob/2db8afce06e64f86133fae21b7b6b730df540293/src/rrd_thread_safe.c#L43 It basically does some calls to pthread.\n Can someone help on what to do next?\n EDIT: I looked into this a bit deeper. The problem actually does not seem to be the calls to pthread, but the way I read the rrd_context_t in Haskell (i.e. the peek). I changed my test to simply call the raw functions in C and look at the returned pointer address. That works ok and I do not get a null pointer. So I guess it has to be the peek which triggers the segmentation fault.\n This also happens when I simply call rrd_new_context which according to the C code ( https://github.com/oetiker/rrdtool-1.x/blob/2db8afce06e64f86133fae21b7b6b730df540293/src/rrd_error.c#L121) only does a malloc and then returns the pointer.\n So either the memory pointed to is already taken away from my process (not sure what the proper wording is here) or my Storable instance is broken.\n    submitted by    /u/thomasbach  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "There's a bad dynamic in America's STEM education where kids going into college computer science out of high school hit a brick wall . . . largely made of math they've never seen before. In general, CS is not at all what they thought it would be. Then they switch/flunk out. So if higher-ed physics, engineering, math has a long, gentle preparatory on-ramp in K-12 with math, comp-sci has absolutely nothing -- or maybe just some \"learn to code.\" And so I've been trying to put together a high-school-level on-ramp for real CS . And I'm basing it on Haskell. Why Haskell? Because the top-tier schools all do some sort of typed functional programming eventually. Functional seems to be the fault line between the top schools and the 2nd-tier. So for example I mix in discrete math with Haskell. You could say I'm high-school-izing the Doets, van Eijck text The Haskell Road to Logic, Maths, and Programming. Or even the Paulson ML for the Working Programmer, another fantastic book. Great, you might say. Trouble is I'm all alone -- as far as I know. For example, if you look at the AP Computer Science stuff, it's basically learn to program Java with a smattering of data structures and algorithms tacked on. Not really much help for a kid walking into Cornell or CMU. Every high school effort I've come across so far has hardly ever been more than \"learn to code,\" typically Python. So my question to you is, should I keep going -- or give it up for a bad job? Am I really on to something, or am I tilting at windmills? The fact that I'm so alone on this is ominous. I've contacted lots of big name professors -- and they're sympathetic but in the long run apathetic simply because they're awash in 96th-percentile applicants. Yeah....

          "description": "Hi everybody! Haskell caught my attention because of its powerful type system. I come from a math background so I thought it'd be fun to implement some theorems in abstract algebra in Haskell. From what I understand, there are classes of functions in Haskell like <> for example which represents an associative operation. What I'd really like is to implement a homomorphism type that sends f (x * y) to f(x) * f(y). The trouble I am having is that in mathematics we will always demand a proof that a map is a homomorphism before we give it its status as one. Is this not the case in Haskell? In other words, do we need to manually check that an operation is a homomorphism or is there some way for Haskell to recognize one (perhaps with a bit of assistance from the programmer/type system/something else)?\n    submitted by    /u/No_News_3567  \n [link]   [comments]",

But can you give me some examples in Haskell? Something like representing naturals and booleans with types, writing plus and if/else for them, etc.\n ​\n BTW, is Haskell's type inference engine Turing complete? I guess the answer is no. But why? Does UndecidableInstances have anything to do with this?\n ​\n Obviously, this question doesn't have a lot of practical value. It's a rabbit hole. Sorry for that. I'm just interested.

Are they just using a makefile. Are they dropping cabal alltogether and only use shake?

          "description": "I've encountered a design issue several times, and I'm wondering what approach is most consistent with Haskell idioms/best practices.\n I'm implementing a data structure, call it Z a, with an interface for manipulating it where almost all of the functions in the interface return a Z a, with many of the form Z a -> Z a or b -> Z a -> Z a. But for a few of the functions there's no valid result for some edge case inputs, and it makes sense in those situations to return Maybe (Z a). \n Now at that point, it makes sense to have every function in the interface return Maybe (Z a) because I can then sequence my operations nicely with >>= \n z :: Z a z >>= op1 >>= op2 >>= (op3 x) >>= (op4 1 2) \n or something like\n pipe :: (Foldable t, Monad m) => a -> t (a -> m a) -> m a pipe = foldM (&) z :: Z a pipe z [op1, op2, op3 x, op4 1 2] \n This is pretty convenient, I suppose, but then just one or two operations that have a Maybe result changed the entire interface to the data structure. An alternative would be to make the data structure itself an instance of Monad and make everything again -> Z a. There are several advantages of internalizing, e.g., I can carry some extra information in the Nothing case or even have several failure paths; and several disadvantages -- the non maybe'd functions now have to do the boilerplate to check for the Nothing-ish inputs and pass them along for every function, whereas Maybe does that automatically.\n My question is what are the Haskell best practices/idioms for this decision. Where is the boundary for the choice between internalizing the Monad instance in the data structure type itself and just using something like Maybe for *all* the functions in the interface. \n I hope my question is clear.

And I'm happy to offer my mentorship in the following two projects:\n  \nHaskell Beginners 2022 — a Haskell course for complete beginners. It doesn't require any prior FP knowledge at all! And it's format is perfectly suitable for Hacktoberfest. Read more information in how to participate instructions.\n Iris — a Haskell CLI framework I created earlier this year. It's still at the early stage. But it has tons of beginner-friendly issues! Check out issues with the \"hacktoberfest\" label.\n  \nFeel free to ask any questions!\n Also, please, don't hesitate to share your projects that participate in Hacktoberfest this year as well! 🤗\n    submitted by    /u/chshersh  \n [link]   [comments]",

If you're interested in giving a talk, we have slots for 25 minute and 5 minute talks. Talks already planned include:\n ​\n Practical STM: An Async Job Queue, by Jake Keuhlen\n ​\n  \nIn this talk, we’ll walk through a brief introduction to concurrency and one of Haskell’s best tools for dealing with it: software transactional memory (STM). We’ll then use STM to build a simple but powerful asynchronous job queue.\n  \nMake your own Haskell, by Mitchell Vitez\n ​\n  \nWe'll explore the process of making our own Haskell-like language. Composition will lead us to trees, and trees will lead us to languages. We'll grow, trim, typecheck, and reorganize these trees, populating our own little forested enclave. Finally, we'll discover why our language can't really be represented by a tree after all.\n  \n​\n We'll have pizza delivered and the event will be bartended.\n The event is at the Power + Light Building, at 920 Southwest 6th Avenue.\n Please RSVP here if you're interested: https://www.eventbrite.com/e/haskell-talks-at-mercury-tickets-424633328717.

Since every monad gives rise to an applicative, there would be a broad range of applicatives to consider.

Hence, although no more references may be added once it's been created, in-place destructive update isn't guaranteed to be safe.\n All is not lost, though: as linear types can only be used once anyways, it would, for practical purposes, suffice to show that they are eventually unique - that, by the time of their use/destruction, they only have a single reference. One could also consider a sequence of linear arrow applications, such that it converges to uniqueness in the given reference to which they were applied.\n Are there meaningful assumptions which strengthen linearity to uniqueness without dropping the theoretical cleanness? (like wrapping them in an opaque monad)\n    submitted by    /u/talismanick_  \n [link]   [comments]",

This class is a requirement for my degree and only one person teaches it. I've done well in my other classes and am familiar with a lot of other languages and I feel like I am about to throw tens of thousands of dollars away on a degree because I am struggling with one niche language that I never want to use again. I passed all the hard classes in my degree and my entire education hangs on this. No offense to people who love Haskell. I understand it can be a great language in certain uses. Anyone who was like a lost puppy when they started learning Haskell, what resources did you use? My degree, financial well-being, and mental health depend on it. Haskell is worth about 25% of the overall course grade and I already bombed the first assignment. Unfortunately, her questions are very hard and the homework is very strict on using resources and other people.\n She low key expects us to be fluent in haskell in just five weeks.\n I hope this post is okay here.\n    submitted by    /u/ChickenFriedRiceee  \n [link]   [comments]",

Here is a very simplified version:\n data Expre = A | B | X Expre Expre process :: Expre -> Expre process A = B process B = A process (X ex1 ex2) = X (process ex1) (process ex2) \n Expre pretty much represents a tree with two leaf constructors.\n process has my rewrite rules for terms of type Expre. All it does is swap A and B around. I was wondering if there is a canonical, clean way to track each application of a rewrite rule? So, concretely tracking the changes of my expression: process $ X A (X B A) should spit out the following list of intermediate terms:\n 1 X B (X B A) 2 X B (X A A) 1 X B (X A B) \n The number in the front represents which rewrite rule was applied. This feels very much like a problem that has a generic solution using a typeclass/data structure/idea that I'm not aware of, so I was wondering if such a thing exists. \n My handrolled solution looks like this, there has to be a neater way:\n process :: (Expre -> Expre) -> Expre -> Writer [(Int, Expre)] Expre process fn A = tell [(1, fn B)] >> return B process fn B = tell [(2, fn A)] >> return A process fn (X ex1 ex2) = do e1 <- process (\\e -> fn $ X e ex2) ex1 e2 <- process (\\e -> fn $ X e1 e) ex2 return $ X e1 e2 \n Called with runWriter $ process id $ X A (X B A) in GHC gives the desired result.\n Thank you!\n    submitted by    /u/Dimiranger  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "TL;DR: Is it possible to perform an AST re-write that depends on global knowledge derived from the AST while simultaneously evaluating the AST -- all in a single pass?\n The \"Real\" Problem:\n I'm working on a Haskell -> Elm code generator. I'm parsing out an Elm type AST (see below). The problem is that multiple TyDecl varname nodes could exist after parsing. E.g: the following haskell type definition\n data Foo = Foo Int | Bar [Foo] \n generates\n TyDecl \"Foo\" [] ( TyVariant ( ( \"Foo\" , [ TyInt ] ) :| [ ( \"Bar\" , [ TyApp \"List\" [ TyDecl \"Foo\" [] (!!! Recursive def of Foo here !!!) ( TyApp \"Foo\" [] )] ] ) ] ) ) ( TyApp \"Foo\" [] ) \n To solve this problem I am folding twice over the parsed AST.\n The first pass replaces all but one TyDecl \"Foo\" node with its TyApp \"Foo\" [] node. This is done by using an algebra\n preventDuplicats :: (MonadState (Set VarName) m) => Base Ty (m a) -> m a \n Following the example above this rewrites the above AST to be:\n TyDecl \"Foo\" [] ( TyVariant ( ( \"Foo\" , [ TyInt ] ) :| [ ( \"Bar\" , [ TyApp \"List\" [ TyApp \"Foo\" [] ] ] ) ] ) ) ( TyApp \"Foo\" [] ) \n The second pass evaluates the AST to generate the Elm code (essentially):\n generateElm :: Base Ty String -> String \n What I'd like to do is construct some mechanism that would let me perform this AST re-write (preventDuplicates) while evaluating with the main algebra (generateElm). Maybe something like?:\n evalAndPrevent :: (MonadState (Set VarName) m, Comonad w) => (Base Ty (w a) -> a) -> Base Ty (w (m a)) -> m a \n Ty Definition\n data Ty = TyVar VarName | TyApp VarName [Ty] -- This models `let` expressions in type declarations -- data B a b c = <a> in <b> == TyDecl \"B\" [\"a\",\"b\",\"c\"] <a> <b> | TyDecl VarName [VarName] Ty Ty | ... deriving (Show, Generic) \n Attempted solutions?\n I've looked into prepomorphisms. However, this doesn't seem to work because the re-write morphism Base t a -> Base t a by defintion is a \"local\" only re-write.\n    submitted by    /u/yanhu  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "A few months ago, I made a post about Okapi. Okapi is a micro web framework for Haskell. The feedback I got was great and I've made a lot of changes to Okapi since then. The core idea of Okapi is still the same: use monadic parsing to implement web servers.\n The biggest addition to Okapi since I last posted is the addition of named routes. One of the comments on my previous post asked if Okapi had named routes. At the time it didn't, but I think I've found a way to implement type safe named routes in Okapi without relying on Template Haskell or type-level programming like other Haskell web frameworks do.\n I've written a series of essays on the topic of named routes, and how they work in Okapi.\n  \nNamed Routes in Okapi: Part I\n Named Routes in Okapi: Part II\n Named Routes in Okapi: Part III\n  \nOkapi is still in the early stages of development, so I'm looking for feedback. Any kind of feedback is appreciated. Whether it's the design of the documentation, code conventions, the names of functions, concerns, etc. Please don't hesitate.\n I'm really interested to hear what non-Haskell users and beginner Haskellers have to say. The blog posts I listed above are probably more geared toward advanced-beginner/intermediate Haskellers, but feel free to check out the hopefully more beginner friendly documentation listed below.\n  \nOfficial documentation\n Hackage candidate documentation\n  \nDocumentation is still largely incomplete at this point, but I'm working on it. I want to get feedback on everything so far before going further.\n I can't recommend Okapi for production projects yet, but I've successfully been using it for small, long-running web applications of only a few users without any problems so far.\n Thank you for reading :)\n    submitted by    /u/MonadicSystems  \n [link]   [comments]",

For example I can write this:\n  readLine.split(\" \").map(_.toInt)  And it works as expected, but then I try:  vertices(v).filter(!(visited(_))  and the compiler would complain:\n  \nvalue unary_! is not a member of Int => Boolean\n  \nSo I end up writing my lambda expressions with _ and if I see an error then I expand them to “true” lambdas like:  vertices(v).filter(vertex => !(visited(vertex)) \n This is a little frustrating, so what I want to know, is, what are the rules that the underscore syntax OK in the first case, but wrong in the second one?\n    submitted by    /u/zefciu  \n [link]   [comments]",

So the service call fails and scheduler blows up and goes away, leaving my app running without the 15-minute scheduled tasks that were supposed to happen.\n How would you structure an app with futures or tasks or any effect system (leaving aside actors) to supervise the system as a whole such that:\n  \nIf a service connection in the connection pool happened to get disconnected and we just found out, my_svc_pool should safely dispose of it and replace it\n If scheduler blows up on waking up and trying to perform its task, app should replace it with a fresh one\n  \n   submitted by    /u/yawaramin  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Just curious: If you've played around with several FP languages (especially typed), how do you think Scala compares with them? What is similar and what is different? \n Some context: \n I've been on a programming language exploration journey for the last year or so and I'm trying to learn as many FP languages as I can. I've looked into Haskell, the various Lisps/Schemes, F#, Ocaml, Elm, Rust, etc.... Racket (a Scheme) and the ML-based languages (F#, Ocaml) have been my favorites so far, though they're also not without their weaknesses. Racket and OCaml are both fantastic languages (I found myself favoring the latter due to the type system), but kinda suffer from having a relatively small ecosystem -- and in the case of Ocaml, rather poor tooling. F# offers a much better ecosystem, and in fact it's the language I've used the most (I love ADTs). There's also something very elegant about the ML syntax, even though F# lacks some of the more interesting features of OCaml. One non-trivial weakness of F#, imo, is that eventually you're going to have to resort to some (or sometimes a lot) non-FP/OOP code due to its ties with the C# and the .NET environment. And that can be a drag.\n I've also tried a little Clojure, and it's a nice enough language (happy not to have to deal with Java), though I can't say that I'm in love with it. Overall, it just seems like a less elegant Scheme, and I don't see much of a reason to use it over something like Racket/Scheme, except for maybe the larger collection of libraries that are available on the JVM (OK, the hot reloading feature is also neat, but not something I necessarily care about).\n    submitted by    /u/jmhimara  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I've put together the first release (0.0.1) for echopraxia-plusakka, a structured logging module that adds structured logging mapping for Akka components -- Actor(Ref|Path|System|Context) etc -- and also adds some type enrichment and utility classes to expose loggers intuitively.\n https://github.com/tersesystems/echopraxia-plusakka\n Note that this doesn't go through LoggingAdapter, Akka's internal logging pipeline. Everything run through LoggingAdapter was processed into a String, so you couldn't represent data in two different formats depending on the appender -- in Echopraxia, argument serialization is deferred, so you can have logfmt on console and JSON on the backend. \n This also means you don't have to rely on MDC or the built-in toString methods in Akka any more. Probably the biggest relief is being able to map ByteString to {length=11 utf8String=some string} so it has binary/text data available.\n Your domain messages in Akka can be handled using automatic derivation, and logging is type safe -- if there's no ToValue mapping, the logging statement just won't compile.\n Hope you like it!\n (Comments about Akka's business license / future are not welcome, please keep it on topic.)\n    submitted by    /u/amazedballer  \n [link]   [comments]",

The libraries are increasingly stable and we're having as much fun working with them as on them these days. 😊\n Indigo 0.14.0\n This release includes many improvements, fixes, and enhancements, but the exciting new feature is timeline animations!\n Even simple animations for title screens used to be very difficult in Indigo, but they now have a dedicated and rather fun solution.\n Release notes: https://github.com/PurpleKingdomGames/indigo/releases/tag/v0.14.0\n (As a bonus, the Roguelike-starterkit has also had a tiny update to keep it inline with Indigo.)\n Tyrian 0.6.0\n Version 0.5.0 rebuilt Tyrian to run on Cats Effect 3 and fs2 from the ground up, but you were locked into using IO, and you couldn't use fs2 directly in your web apps. This release adds...\n  \nThe ability to use fs2 Streams for subscriptions\n Support for ZIO 2.0*\n  \nWe've also added a swathe of other quality-of-life improvements.\n Release notes: https://github.com/PurpleKingdomGames/tyrian/releases/tag/v0.6.0\n (\\ You'll need to use a snapshot of the interop-cats library until the next release, but it works just fine. See the release notes.)*\n Getting Started\n You can get started with either project with their g8 templates:\n https://github.com/PurpleKingdomGames/indigo.g8\n https://github.com/PurpleKingdomGames/tyrian.g8\n ...or by heading over to the awesome: https://scribble.ninja/\n Documentation can be found at https://indigoengine.io/ and https://tyrian.indigoengine.io/.\n As always, please report any issues, and if you need any help, do come and say hello on Discord.\n https://discord.gg/b5CD47g\n    submitted by    /u/davesmith00000  \n [link]   [comments]",

The additional use grant in the BSL license for the Play Framework is very limited and is no solution to move forward. \n It would be the best for these FOSS projects to have a reliable Akka fork (focused on bug fixing and long term stability).\n Are there already ongoing initiatives for an Akka fork?\n Who would be willing to contribute to an Akka fork (financial contribution, development or organisational aspects)?\n How do we make this happen?\n    submitted by    /u/sebaz6r  \n [link]   [comments]",

It’d be good to get a flow where the flashcard is just part of the note as is, and I can pull it out without duplicating it.\n  \nI tried to manipulate it a bit, and my current workflow is incorporating it directly into my notes.\n Take this note, for example, about Edge Devices,\n * Definition :PROPERTIES: :ANKI_DECK: Computer Networking :ANKI_NOTE_TYPE: Basic :ANKI_NOTE_ID: 1665541877624 :END: ** Front What are Edge Devices? ** Back - They are known as End-sytems or Hosts.

          "description": "Howdy. It would be much easier for me to do my note-taking if org-roam-node-find had the following behavior: - Pressing TAB changes the text in the search bar to whatever the suggestion list has highlighted. I'd like it to just replace the entire thing instead of doing that default step-by-step completion if possible. - Pressing ENTER opens or creates the exact match of what's entered in the org-roam-node-find search bar. \n Currently, I'm having some issues. My PKM note hierarchy uses dots as delimiters. Take the note res.lore.sw as an example (my note about Star Wars). I created it first. Now I want to create res.lore as an index for all the lores I've written about, but org-roam-node-find won't let me create it, because it matches with the Star Wars note and opens it. I'd instead like to be able to either press TAB to set the highlighted file as the new search, or press ENTER to open or create the exact note id entered into the search bar.\n My current org-roam config is pretty much the minimum:  (use-package org-roam :ensure t :init (setq org-roam-v2-ack t) :custom (org-roam-directory \"REDACTED\") (org-roam-complete-everywhere t) (org-roam-capture-templates '((\"d\" \"default\" plain \"%?\" :if-new (file+head \"${title}.org\" \"#+title: ${title}\\n#+date: %U\\n\") :unnarrowed t))) :config (org-roam-setup) (org-roam-db-autosync-mode)) \n    submitted by    /u/Tristan401  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I use org-mode for taking notes, mostly math and physics these days, typing LaTeX equations inside org files. For this I use doom emacs.\n I've seen that with markup markers such as \"*\" (bold) and \"/\" (italics), org-hide-emphasis-markers allows for showing the effect in the text while getting rid of the cumbersome markers. Moreover, when the point is within markers, they show so one can edit them.\n I was wondering if it is possible to do the same with LaTeX environments like \"\\begin{equation}\" and \"\\end{equation}\", for instance. I've tried with hide-lines.el, which allows for hiding lines matching a regex (in this case, the regex are, for instance: \"^\\\\begin{[a-z]*}\"). But although this works, it is far from ideal, as one would need to toggle their visibility for editing them, unlike the more practical way that org-emphasis-hide-markers allows for.\n Is there a way to achieve such result? Thanks in advance for all your help.\n Edit:\n To be clear, I would like to enter something like:\n \\begin{equation}\n A = B\n \\end{equation}\n and have emacs hide the first and third lines when away from the region, so that only\n A = B\n shows. If possible, I would also like to be able to see the delimiters whenever the point visits the A = B line.\n    submitted by    /u/Gus_Gustavsohn  \n [link]   [comments]",

I've researched how people are using roam / roam-alikes but I am reluctant to get going with note-taking as:\n (1) It feels like a big overhead. I don't feel I have time for journalling / processing notes each day; \n (2) I am concerned that the very beginning of my roam career is crucial to success, and I may develop bad habits or bad practices which will hold my Zettel back; and\n (3) I live on mobile, and roam workflows are not mobile friendly.\n I'd be interested in testing, by reflecting on the experience of others, the following assumptions I have:\n (a) that roam isn't necessary in a professional environment. I already subscribe to regularly-updated professional resources full of hyperlinks;\n (b) that roam doesn't replace my current org-mode setup of a GTD-like system (which I also struggle to review regularly). Rather it sits alongside it as a \"reference\" asset;\n (c) that the biggest use of org-roam for me would be in hobbies. For example if I wanted to make a video tutorial, or blog post;\n (d) roam isn't a place to store sensitive everyday information (like passport no, social security details etc); and\n (d) roam is not mobile friendly (I hear logseq works, but only for v1)\n    submitted by    /u/thephatmaster  \n [link]   [comments]",

This was also the context in which I realized an org-babel/source block behaviour that I don't understand.\n Frequently, when I want to quickly test how a note looks in html, I run into the error \"unmatched bracket or quote\" which aborts the html export.\n Now, I've started to narrow the initial problem down to a few problematic aspects: apparently, org-babel tries to match \"<>\" and \"' '\", both of which I generally used. However, since the lisp-babel-block doesn't use any of those signs as delimiters, why can't I use them? \n Find below a block of things that I'd like to, but can't, use:\n #+BEGIN_SRC lisp (defvar *my-list* '(a b c)) ; This doesn't work because of ' (second *my-list*) ;; => b ; This doesn't work because of > (mapcar #'list *my-list*) ; This doesn't work because of ' #+END_SRC \n Now that I think of it, I also can't use either of these in regular text, which is pretty annoying. I would like to be able to use #' since it is something I'd want to explain to myself using a note.\n Is there a way that I can modify this behaviour?\n    submitted by    /u/olivuser  \n [link]   [comments]",

I really would like to keep the json highlighting that org-mode provides. \n If I were doing it in bash I might create the file as bash cat > /tmp/args.json <<HERE { \"JSON_HERE\": \"Here is some JSON\" } HERE \n The python script will be written from a template and expects input from a file. If invoked at the command line, the command is python library/my\\_test.py /tmp/args.json\n For the JSON part, I have JSON set up as an org-mode language language and that provides syntax highlighting and pop-out editing, but of course there is nothing to execute. An example block would almost do it, but there is no simple way to save that to a file AFAIK\n For the python part, there is lots of information in the manual as to how to pass in various elisp list, tables, properties etc but all I need is a simple file name.

          "description": "This has been bugging me for a while on my system. When I export an ODT document, the paper size is always stuck as A4. If I print this, my printer will hang with an error as it is expecting A4 paper, but we only have letter paper (8.5x11in). I finally set down to try and figure out how to change this today.\n It turns out, there is no simple option! This paper size is determined by the ODT style file that is included with an emacs/org distribution. One option is to explicitly define a custom style in the top lines of the org document itself, but this starts to get very messy quickly. I think the future solution needs to be a switch or setting to integrate with the ox-odt export functions, but that is for another day.\n What works on my system (linux):\n On my system, the style file is locate…",

          "description": "I write my blog with Zola, a static site generator written in Rust, but I'm also an emacser, so I wanted to export my org-mode files to Zola's markdown and set up an org-centric workflow. \n In order to do that, I searched for a solution outside but I saw no libraries. So, I thought I could tweak the wonderful ox-hugo exporter, which cover most of the needs in the \"org to markdown\" field, being it thought for Hugo (another static site generator which works parsing markdown files). I'm a newbie in emacs lisp, so I'm sure there are more elegant ways to achieve what I did, but my solution was forking ox-hugo (in ox-zola) and hacking it to make it compatible with Zola needs. \n There were some minor differences that made the exported broken, but now it should work by default. More specifically, I added this Zola-relative features:\n  \nCustom frontmatters parameters\n Lastmod/updated tags\n Taxonomies\n  \nI'm already using this library in production for my blog for a while, so I thought this could be the moment to share it with everybody. If you need this exporter, please use it; if you want to add features, feel free to make a PR.\n Thanks to all of you for this lovely community, I leave the link to the repo below.\n https://github.com/gicrisf/ox-zola\n    submitted by    /u/cromo_  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "TL;DR: I need to specify a :files value inside the use-package form, but this has irritating side-effects.\n I install packages with straight and use-package.\n I use the transient package. I noticed that its info manual didn't appear for me with C-h i. I dug deeper and realized that .../straight/build/transient didn't contain a dir file or any of the doc files. Several other packages, like orderless, did include dir in their straight/build directories, but their repo directories also happen to store the doc files at the top level.\n transient is different in that its repo has a docs/ subdirectory, which seemed to be the source of the problem. But magit has a similar repo structure, and its docs were installing fine.\n I noticed that the recipe for magit has a :files key which pulls in the doc file. Adding\n :straight (:files (:defaults \"docs/*\")) \n to my (use-package 'transient ...) form appears to do the trick - and automagically triggers a make docs command for transient somehow - but now I have two wrinkles:\n  \nstraight rebuilds transient every time I start Emacs\n I get a warning \"Warning (straight): Two different recipes given for \"transient\" (:files cannot be both nil and (:defaults \"docs/*\"))\"\n  \nThe first issue is annoying, but isn't a showstopper. I don't restart Emacs very often and my startup time is already slow.\n The second issue worries me, because I don't know whether it means that updated docs will actually get installed in the future. Presumably the clash is between my (use-package 'transient ...) and the recipe that gets used when transient is handled as a dependency of magit (which I also use). But which recipe is actually used to install transient now? Is it getting installed twice every time?\n I don't know why the transient docs aren't getting installed \"out of the box\" as they apparently are for everyone else. What might I be doing wrong?\n    submitted by    /u/quokka70  \n [link]   [comments]",

OS I recently decided to start adding some extended features and working on my config. Eventually I managed to get lastfm.el and Vuiet working together and it’s awesome! I think I’ve figured out how to make a script with new keybinds for the Vuiet stuff I need to use, but some features are broken, namely searching songs by lyrics. I’m not sure how to debug emacs scripts so if anyone has any suggestions, including a better player, I’m open. Also, I’m shopping around for a completion module, mostly for Python but also C and HTML.\n Edit:\n Vuiet is cool, but seems like a lost cause. I think the only functionality EMMS doesn’t have that Vuiet did, though, is searching by artist for stuff I don’t actually have. \n My main problem at this point is how to add an SMB share to EMMS.\n    submitted by    /u/Magicaldave918  \n [link]   [comments]",

The following defines a complete prefix:\n (setq l1 '((\"vl\" \"visual lines\" visual-line-mode))) (transient-define-prefix foo1 () \"docstring\" [:pad-keys t [\"Appearance\" l1]]) \n (The macro allows for a list of \"elements\" like l1 to be interpolated, something like a ,@ splice in a backtick context.)\n But having the variable l1 lying around feels like a loose end. The following approach looks better:\n (let ((l2 '((\"vl\" \"visual lines\" visual-line-mode)))) (transient-define-prefix foo2 () \"docstring\" [:pad-keys t [\"Appearance\" l2]])) \n But it fails with \"Symbol’s value as variable is void: l2\"\n My understanding of elisp scope is clearly lacking.\n Is the problem that the transient-define-prefix macro is expanded within the let scope but the result is not evaluated until after the let scope is discarded? The elisp documentation for macros says that \"[t]he Lisp interpreter proceeds to evaluate the expansion as soon as it comes back from the macro\" but I may be misunderstanding this.\n    submitted by    /u/quokka70  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi everyone!\n Lately, I've been defining my own regular expressions for parsing errors in the *compilation* buffers by adding entries to the compilation-error-regexp-alist and compilation-error-regexp-alist-alist variables. However, there's a problem. This list already contains an enormous amount of regular expressions for all kinds of languages that I don't use, however, these regular expressions also match errors of the language that I'm trying to add support to, and this results in extracting incorrect paths to files containing errors. I've set compilation-error-regexp-alist to nil and the problem disappeared, but now when I byte-compile elisp files, I get no way to jump to problems from the compilation buffer (well, duh, the regexp list now doesn't contain an entry for elisp).\n So this creates a problem. I want my regular expressions to be the only ones present in the list when I'm working on a project in this language, and I want other regexps to be available when I'm working on other projects. I've thought about using dir-locals.el but my regexps use functions to get the file out of the error message, and I can't put that into dir-locals reliably.\n Another problem is that the compilation-error-regexp-alist contains names of the languages it supports, but for example, there's no elisp or emacs-lisp entry, yet the byte-compile warnings are highlighted correctly. And there's no way to see what regular expressions are responsible for the matches in the compilation buffer, so it's hard to debug what's overriding mine.\n TL;DR: Ideally, I want compilation-error-regexp-alist to be configurable per project but I use custom functions that can break other people's configurations who work on the same project as me and load dir-locals.el\n    submitted by    /u/andreyorst  \n [link]   [comments]",

Specifically, the pain points with TRAMP shows up mostly in dired and magit, where the turnaround speed (time spent to open a folder in dired, or time spend in any magit command) is quite high. I suspect this is due to the underlying process that TRAMP uses to connect to my remote server. My remote connection is relatively fast (100Mbps+). Things that I have tried till now are:\n  \nFor my remote server, set the following flags in .ssh/config such that TRAMP re-uses the connections\n  \n Host myfasthost ... Compression yes ControlPath /tmp/%r@%h:%p ControlMaster auto ControlPersist 90m \n  \nI use scp protocol to connect to TRAMP in dired.

I was on version 1.5.5, and I've ended up on 1.8.9.\n This upgrade does seem to break a lot of my little tweaks to mu4e. I've managed to sort a few of these out, e.g. mu4e~proc-remove-id becomes mu4e--server-remove-id, mu4e~mark-check-target becomes mu4e--mark-check-target .\n But there are still a few bugs. I previously stole a function to convert an email to a .pdf file:\n (defun mu4e-action-open-to-pdf (msg) (let* ((date (mu4e-message-field msg :date)) (infile (mu4e~write-body-to-html msg)) (outfile (format-time-string \"%Y-%m-%d%H%M%S.pdf\" date))) (with-temp-buffer (shell-command (format \"wkhtmltopdf %s ~/Mail/gmail/pdfs/%s\" infile outfile) t)) (interactive) (find-file (format \"~/Mail/gmail/pdfs/%s\" outfile) ) )) \n Now mu4e~write-body-html is no longer defined.\n My questions are:\n  \nIs there a replacement for mu4e~write-body-html? Or a different method to convert a message to pdf?\n \nI've tried to follow the release notes here, but find it hard to follow... for instance, the releases jump from 1.4.15 to 1.6.0? (So where is 1.5.5?) Is there a compilation of all these changes from e.g. ~ to -- and other general refactoring?\n \n EDIT:\n Just found this warning in the documentation:\n The whole of mu4e consists of hundreds of elisp functions. However, the majority of those are for internal use only; you can recognize them easily, because they all start with mu4e~ or mu4e--. These functions make all kinds of assumptions, and they are subject to change, and should therefore not be used. \n which explains the instability. Didn't see this/know enough about elisp when I stole the functions. Fair enough.\n    submitted by    /u/nonreligious  \n [link]   [comments]",

E.g in eshell I'd type cd and hit <TAB>:\n ~ $ cd \n to open up the *Completions* buffer. Im currently using emacs 29.0.50 (commit 72c64dd73c), and so M-<down> and M-<up> can cycle through the completions (directories in this case with the cd command), while keeping the eshell buffer focused. The problem I'm facing now is how to actually insert the currently highlighted completion into my eshell buffer. Clicking on the completion with the mouse will insert it into eshell, as well as switching focus to the *Completions* buffer and hitting RET over it, but I'm trying to do this without having to switch focus from eshell. M-<up> and M-<down>, added new in emacs 29, allow cycling through completions while keeping focus in the current window (my eshell in this case), but I cant select one. The command minibuffer-choose-completion, which is bound to M-RET returns an error saying \"Text is read only\", which I think is happening because it is trying to insert the completion into the minibuffer and not my eshell window. Moreover, completion-at-point for symbols in elisp files works as intended with M-RET, but not for eshell. Any help on how to sort this would be great.

I do:  ./configure --with-ns make make install sudo xattr -rds com.apple.quarantine nextstep/Emacs.app  and then move the app bundle to /Applications. But that's not what I'm here to talk about 😃\n When macOS switched to zsh I went through a painful transition. Before then, I had my ns-command-modifier set to meta so M-x would be cmd X for me. With bash, that was ok.\n But zsh opened new possibilities for me and it really wanted the meta on the options key rather than the command key. I honestly don't remember what the pain point was. But in any case, I remapped my emacs to be just the defaults where ns-option-modifier is set to meta and ns-command-modifier is set to super. zsh and emacs have a lot of common abilities so I wanted the key mappings to be the same in both. Rather than twist zsh to accept my unique setup I untwisted my unique emacs setup to be more normal.\n Now, I have an entire set of keys, the \"super\" keys that I've never had easy access to before.\n For example, using tabs in emacs, I can bind s-{ to tab-previous and s-} to tab-next and switch between tabs just like it was Safari. Instead of two key C-c p for Projectile, (they even suggest), one key s-p. I'm mapping s-r to projectile-rails, s-y to Yari, etc.\n It was and still is a bit painful of a transition but it is well worth it.\n    submitted by    /u/pedzsanReddit  \n [link]   [comments]",

I haven't found any hooks that would do the trick. Conversely, is there any reason why I don't want to do this?\n Thanks,\n (ETAA: this is slightly different from this question. That one is about setting the one mode to use in a new buffer. Mine is about calling a function to choose a mode dynamically.

At first it looked that I could trigger this feature when using mu4e, opening an html message and scrolling with an arrow downwards. This happened often but not immediately. Because I thought maybe this was mu4e related I chose to use a diffrent client (notmuch). Using notmuch the \"hanging\" did not happen. However, lately I noticed that the \"hanging\" could happen using consult-ripgrep searching a 2G sharepoint.

The reason is that eglot works over TRAMP, while lsp-mode not. Also, I use a lot lsp-ltex and it depends directly of lsp-mode\n My question is: how could I disable eglot when using my local files and let that lsp-mode takes charge of everything, BUT reverse the roles when I'm in a remote file over TRAMP and shutdown lsp-mode and make eglot the lsp manager?\n Is it so hard to do or not? \n Thanks.\n    submitted by    /u/mklsls  \n [link]   [comments]",

Top padding is less so. \n I figured I could make use of the header-line for that, and this seemed like a good start:\n (setq header-line-format \" \") \n Now, I found having a whole blank line of padding a bit much (I know...), so I tried specifying the height property in the value of header-line-format directly: \n (setq header-line-format (propertize \" \" 'face '(:height 80))) \n But that doesn't make a difference unless the height property is greater than that of header-line. \n The only way I've found to make the header-line take up less than the default line height is by messing with the height of header-line. Unfortunately, some modes make use of the header-line for displaying stuff, so I find myself having to add hooks to every mode I encounter that does make use of the header-line, e.g.\n (defun my/reset-header-line-face () (face-remap-add-relative 'header-line '(:height 180))) (add-hook 'use-package-statistics-mode-hook 'my/reset-header-line-face) \n Does anyone know or can think of a less ad-hoc solution?\n    submitted by    /u/graduale  \n [link]   [comments]",

I also saw the guitar Willie Nelson plays (it literally has a gouged hole in it and honestly most people who don't know it would chuck it in garbage).\n I realized that it's a guitar, it's made of wood and in a certain sense is alive. It's not going to be perfect but it's my Guitar. I know how to make it work. I practice on it everyday and I know how to manage those little details.\n You see where I'm going with this? I moved to Emacs a month ago. Objectively, it might be the worse choice compared to my setup on VSCode but it's my editor. Sure they'd be some jank and some small errors and bugs I can't fix but I can always service it myself. I can always make it better. I'd learn with it and grow with it.\n    submitted by    /u/_analysis230_  \n [link]   [comments]",

There has been some chatter here recently about forking + updating org-noter and I'm monitoring that situation.\n Are there other options out there?\n Is it worth considering the option of having some other tool host the annotations and hooking into that via .el? So, for instance, if Calibre supported annotation (it does not) would it be a better approach to include annotation support in calibredb.el?\n Thoughts? Opinions?\n FWIW, I've been doing a ton of research lately and it would be so nice to be able to pull non-Org stuff into the reach of the Org and Org Roam ecosystem in terms of linking, excerpts, and search.\n    submitted by    /u/camber-weaver  \n [link]   [comments]",

This should play well with cooperative threading. So out of curiosity, I tried\n (make-thread (lambda () (gnus-group-get-new-news)) \"Gnus Get News\") \n Guess what -- it works! It does the work in the background without blocking emacs, and update the *Group* buffer once it's done.\n Surprisingly I didn't find anything similar online. I wonder have anyone experimented similiar techiques with more heavy usage? I have no idea how robust this is -- I could be very lucky with nnreddit, its source code has a bunch of with-mutex. I guess that suggests it's written with concurrency in mind? But it doesn't really use any concurrency out of the box, really puzzling...\n P.S.

That did not work. After choosing the denote: type, I would have to manually enter the denote id, without completion and without minibuffer selection.\n I have no clue why that happens. Do you have an idea or a solution to this?\n Thanks a bunch, have a good day :)\n    submitted by    /u/olivuser  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm not here to ask for suggestion or any kind of comparison between the two, don't worry. What I'd like to know is whether org-mode could be useful for a specific use case, which could make me lean towards doom emacs rather than neovim.\n From time to time I have to write documentation for software packages at work. While doing so, we like to have both a pdf version (using latex) to hand to our customers and an html (or similar) version to be stored inside the git repository of the project. To avoid having to write two different docs, we initially used markdown and a custom pandoc filter (for headings, frontpages and whatnot). The problem is that this approach is very limiting when it comes to cross-referencing, captions, and tables with cells spanning multiple columns or rows. Hence we switched to RMarkdown, but having to write R code for the sole purpose of properly handling a few images and tables is very frustrating.\n Do you think that org-mode could be used to solve the problem once and for all? I know that tables in org-mode are pretty powerful, but I don't know to which extent. Nor if the same syntax would be correctly translated both in latex and html as it is with simpler tables.\n Also, if any of you uses org-mode to write scientific papers (hence using different latex templates from different journals) in the STEMs, I'd like to hear your impressions.\n    submitted by    /u/nickfaraco  \n [link]   [comments]",

Before I started using emacs I thought wtf does that even mean? I don't care what else it can do. I have everything else exactly how I want it, I just need a text editor. \n For whatever reason, I made the switch from VSCode to Doom Emacs about 20 days ago. I knew vim keybindings and stuff already but I didn't use them on a day-to-day basis only on servers that didn't have anything else. I did pick up the evil keybindings quickly and after 2-3 days of installation and setup woes, my javascript editing environment was set up rather well. I started relying on vim-fu for code editing and it's so much more enjoyable (don't know if it's faster yet) than using a mouse. \n That made me want more modal-based stuff, I wanted my browser to have modal navigation. While I'd never switch to the emacs browser I installed vimium on my chrome and it works rather well. Now, I started thinking it'd be so nice to have a file manager that was keyboard-focused and da-dum-tusss, the penny dropped. Dired, so that's what they mean when they say \"Emacs is not just a text editor.\" \n I'm in the process of installing mu4e now and I'm slowly beginning to understand things about Emacs that just cannot make sense to you unless you've spent some time with it. I know I heard people say that but I always thought of them as denial-filled ramblings of people who have sunk a decade into learning a tool that's slowly fading.

          "description": "Hi all. I've been writing some go code recently, and found that the eglot/company mode autocomplete performance is awful with large completion lists. Specifically, I'm running into issues when using tcell. Here's an example snippet to show what I mean:\n package main import ( \"github.com/gdamore/tcell/v2\" ) func main() { tcell.[cursor goes here - `completion-at-point`] } \n If completion-at-point is run at the position noted above, emacs locks up for several seconds. Based on a profiler report I ran, the lock up appears to happen at common-lisp-indent-function, but I can't find any evidence online that this is an expensive or slow function... I'm a little bit at a loss at how to fix this. Ideally I'd like to just disable indenting around whatever's happening here (since it's happening somewhere deep in the json rpc call). Can anyone else reproduce this problem, or has anyone else seen it?\n Edit: figured I'd mention that this problem disappears with lsp-mode, so I guess I'll be using that for the time being.\n    submitted by    /u/chopu  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Lets say I want Calc to understand a TeX formula like $\\int_a^b f(x) \\mathrm{d} x$. Clearly, there are many ways to write this, I could have just written \"d\" instead of \"\\mathrm\", the integral bounds could be just a single lower index indicating a region, \"f(x)\" could actually consist of derivatives with the same differential notation as \"d x\", etc. If I could use Backus-Naur form, I would define a non-terminal like\n INTEGRAL := \"\\\\int\" REGION INTEGRAND DIFFERENTIAL DUMMY_VAR\n and then individually handle all of these edge cases in each non-terminal. For instance, I could write REGION to accept empty patterns for indefinite integrals, or to accept just a subscript for regions, similarly for DIFFERENTIAL or INTEGRAND. Instead, in Calc, I have to write a messy rewrite rule to just handle the REGION part, and I am not even sure if the INTEGRAND symbol could be implemented since any integrand having terms that look like $\\frac{d f}{d x}$ would prematurely terminate parsing as the denominator would be interpreted as DIFFERENTIAL. It seems to me that Calc is formally incapable of handling these complications, but I may be wrong. Are there ways within calc to implemen the functinality I want? If not, are there libraries that allow me to augment Calc in this way? Failing that, I would be willing to use the Wisent parser generator, but how do I integrate it into Calc?\n    submitted by    /u/isabellaetore  \n [link]   [comments]",

But I can't find any command (user-level or elisp) to access the HTML part of an email from within notmuch-show. I can store attachments, but the HTML part is not offered for saving. And looking at the code, notmuch seems to relay on mm-view and other stuff for which I could not find documentation. So, basically, my question is: what functions can I use to access the HTML part of a mail within the notmuch-show buffer so that I can pass it to a process?\n EDIT: \n It's mm-dissect-buffer. When called wrapped within with-current-notmuch-show-messsage, you get a list of mm-handle objects defining the different parts of the mail viewed. To save the part, you can use mm-save-part-to-file.

Trust me, I've been through most configs and setups, and nothing 'just works' and is a complete mess.\n That being stated, I went ahead and thought to then just use Emacs in terminal anyway since I use it for Org Mode notes anyway for work and would rather use VS Code for web development projects with intellisense out of the box (React, vanilla JS, Ruby, etc).\n ​\n With This In Mind, I Have The Following Issues:\n  \nIssue Using 'M-x RET' to launch 'vterm' on MacOS\n  \nSo on MacOS, I do the following key combo swaps:\n - Swap Caps with Ctrl\n - Swap Option with Command\n ​\n However, when I try to use my existing key combination on MacOS to launch 'vterm' with 'M-RET' that works already works on Linux (Manjaro), I get the following:\n M-RET is undefined \n A related snippet from my config can be found here:\n https://bpa.st/XLNQ\n ​\n  \nUsing 'M-w' quits out of VS Code \n  \nAnyone who uses Emacs knows that 'M-w' is used to copy a selected portion of the buffer into the copy and paste clipboard.\n However, when I do this action, it quits out of VS Code.\n Does anyone know how I can nuke this default behavior of VS Code to allow Emacs to just utilize it going forward?\n ​\n  \nUsing 'M-f' and 'M-b' does not go back and forward\n  \nWhen I use this in VS Code, 'M-f' brings up the 'Find' search bar.\n And 'M-b' toggles the ability to show and hide the Explorer window.\n How can I adjust this so that Emacs is given the ability to use 'M-f' and 'M-b' normally?\n ​\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/BackToPlebbit69  \n [link]   [comments]",

I am doing some weird stuff with cached git statuses and I may be rendering an SVG icon for god mode. I do have god-mode on by default.\n I'm guessing that somewhere in the background lurks a billion ever-exapanding buffers, temporary or otherwise, that are needing to eval their git project status and render an svg icon.\n Anyway, at this point I'd like to distill my modeline down into simple, colorized text.

Currently, I've put those text files in a #+begin_src text block, with a tangle. I then have a #+begin_src sh block taking two filenames as input variables that invoke the cli program with the filenames.\n The current workflow thus ends up being:\n  \ndon't forget to tangle the input files\n invoke the shell block\n  \nIdeally I'd like to somehow configure it such that invoking the shell block will auto-tangle the input blocks, or something to that effect (if there's an option to put them in a temp file and present the filename to the sh block, that's also fine). Is this something that can be done somewhat straightforwardly?\n Secondly, currently I have the following tangle instructions on each input file: :tangle (org-in-tangle-dir \"file.txt\"). The filename to tangle to is identical to the #+name: file.txt preceding the block. The org-in-tangle-dir function is defined as follows:\n (defun org-in-tangle-dir (sub-path) \"Expand the SUB-PATH into the directory given by the tangle-dir property if that property exists, else use the `default-directory'.\" (expand-file-name sub-path (or (org-entry-get (point) \"tangle-dir\" 'inherit) (default-directory)))) \n Is there any way to tell the tangle to use the #+name attribute as filename to tangle to?\n Thanks for any help\n    submitted by    /u/Foo-jin  \n [link]   [comments]",

But most (all?) of them keep keybindings similar to the original ones.\n Personally, I'd like keybindings to be oriented at the things which the commands operate on, e.g. server, frame, window, project, directory, file, block, region, line, word, cursor. I'd love to have an elisp package which allows me to dedicate a key for each of these things, e.g. I'd dedicate \"a\" to \"server\" because with my current keyboard-layout, I type \"a\" with my pinky which I don't want to use so often and because I don't expect Emacs-server related commands to be called often. I could then type C-a and thus get access to many server-related commands, e.g. I could call \"server-start\" with C-a s. Then there'd be some easy mechanism to enter and stay in hydras, so that you don't need to type the prefix every time. E.g., the SPC key could toggle that behavior.

I've got a fork that incorporates the multiple good changes made by community members, and been running it for a while now. \n I can throw that up on melpa as ox-slack2 (or whatever) but it seems more appropriate to try and contact the maintainer of the original and either get them incorporated there or take over its maintenance. So, I'm reaching out to you all to see if any of you know how to reach him and could dm me the info, or point him at this post.\n The guy behind it is Matt Price. He teaches / taught at the University of Toronto. I've explored various rabbit holes but none of them seem to lead to anything with an email / working twitter / anything else. \n Assuming that doesn't work, I have it in my head that it might be technically possible for me to replace his package on melpa without his permission? If so, it seems like a jerk move, but one that may be appropriate in this case. Any advice around how to proceed if i can't contact him would be appreciated.

His filenames are of the format <YYYY-MM-DD>-<url-slug>.md, so starting with an ISO date, then the URL \"path\".\nMaking blogging simpler this way reminds me of how the way Sascha's and my Zettel format changed over the years, and how Sascha's very minimal solution eventually came about and sticks around since then:\n# <ID> <TITLE>\n<tags>\n\n<content>\n\nVery similar approach: make it pleasant for the human, let the app do the work. Avoid ceremony and technobabble.\nI'd argue that Jim Nielsen's approach of putting hashtags before the title can worsen interoperability with applications that treat the first line of a file as the title -- but while that behavior is popular in a niche of plain text note-taking apps, it never really became a mainstream expectation, so 🤷‍♂️",
