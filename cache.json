          "description": "Hi all, \n As there seems to be a demand for practical Haskell examples/applications, I decided to create a video series to show an example of how such an application could be developed. In this case I chose to show how to process streamed binary satellite data and build a Haskell application for this. This starts with basic things like network connections, conduits, goes over logging, config file handling, command line parsing to parsing the binary ground- and space-protocols involved, threading (for parallel processing chains), STM and finally displaying the results in a graphical user interface (with GTK). \n This also can serve as an introduction to the AURIS mission control system I am writing in Haskell (on ZuriHac and MuniHac there was some demand for more explanations as the project is a bit intimidating and requires some domain knowledge). So I thought I could combine this and provide some insight into this domain, while showing how such an application could work in Haskell. \n Each video builds on its predecessor. The current ones are: \n  \nVideo 1: Introduction and Project Setup \n Video 2: Network Connections and Conduits \n Video 3: Configuration Files \n Video 4: Command Line Arguments \n Video 5: Parsing the Transport Protocol Layer \n Video 6: Parsing the TM Transfer Layer \n Video 7: CRC Check, Interfacing C++, Property Tests \n Video 8: Logging and the RIO Monad\n \n Further ones are planned, but not yet available.\n I might be going quickly sometimes (as I wanted to focus on certain areas and the videos are already quite long), so if there is a demand for more detailed explanations of certain things, let me know.\n The video series as a Youtube playlist:\n https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyEkIXFmuNQ&list=PLp2qifo30hMuNgmUUhgl82DTK2JTUqK6M\n    submitted by    /u/empowerg  \n [link]   [comments]",

The code can easily be looked up in official documentation and referred to in forums, StackOverflow, etc.. There is work underway which could lead to the same functionality in GHC.\n I wondered whether there's a particularly strong reason for numeric error codes as opposed to human readable identifiers.

          "description": "As a preface, I am using GHC 8.10.4, and I've read a few posts about hang ups with this version of GHC. My main build tool is Stack so using stack build --fast works just fine, while running stack build (using -O2) does causes the hang up. Some of the suggested comments from the similar posts say to sprinkle in some {- OPTIONS_GHC -O1 -} on the offending files to allow it compile. However, I can't seem to find the right one to use it on. \n My question is: How do I debug this compiler issue? My terminal always hangs up after it prints [ 9 of 17] Compiling Display. Is this the offending file? Or is it something that comes after? \n Are there any options I can pass to the compiler to get some more verbose output to diagnose the issue?\n Thanks\n EDIT: I've done some brief testing as per /u/manpacket suggested. Display.hs seems to be the offending file. \n The testing is by no means robust and is simply using stack clean && stack build each time. The left hand side indicates which instance definitions have had their undefined definition returned to normal. \n The timings are as follows:\n all undefined - 18.8s storeLoc - 18.9s storeLoc/OperandType - 18.5s storeLoc/OperandType/Operand - 22.7s storeLoc/OperandType/OpCode - 31.8s storeLoc/OperandType/Instruction - 18.8s storeLoc/OperandType/Instruction/CPUState - 43.2s storeLoc/OperandType/CPUState - 42.8s \n It seems as though the issue stems from the repeated use of <>?\n The github repo is here if you want to take a look.\n    submitted by    /u/Drsooch  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Recently I read the ACM Queue article titled \"Schrodinger's code\" concerning undefined behaviors in C so I started to wonder if Haskell has them and how many.\n So quickly I found that obviously Haskell does have them here and there. There are a bunch of unsafe functions, and FFI, etc.\n What baffles me, however, is that C compilers work on the assumption that paths contain UBs are not reachable so the compilers can aggressively remove code paths and optimize code. I personally think this means (if Haskell did the same) all code paths containing bottom values are removed. This actually makes sense in a non-strict language, because the semantics of the remaining parts remain unchanged.\n Therefore, I'm asking here the question, how well do bottom values relate to UBs (or LLVM undef?) My knowledge about Haskell is still limited so maybe this similarity is just superficial and there's no serious conclusion can be drawn here.\n Another question is: will GHC actually do the same kind of optimizations? If yes, how are they justified? If no, why not? I once encountered <<loop>> (my intent was exactly making it loop). But for other scenarios the bottom values seem to be preserved, and they are even used to cancel tasks (async exceptions).\n edit: The last question is baffling me. If the bottom value can be somehow \"caught\" like exceptions, are they really bottom values?\n    submitted by    /u/ekd123  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi everyone\n I'm sort of a Haskell noob, and I'm writing my thesis in Haskell. This is the first \"real\" project I've ever done so please bear with me if I sound stupid.\n Anyway, I'm almost at the end of the project. I have a function that opens a file, does some things to it, and then returns a result. I'm working with about 500000 files, so I thought I'd add parallelism to speed it up. I read some about parallelism in Haskell but still don't understand it very well. However, that's not important.\n My original sequential routine looks like this:\n openGetListResults :: [String] -> IO String openGetListResults [] = do return \"\" openGetListResults (p:rest) = do resP <- openGetProgramResult p resL <- openGetListResults rest return (resP ++ resL) \n It works fine.I found the Control.Monad.Parallel module online and thought I could use it to speed it up. I came up with the following:\n pOpenExecuteListPrograms :: [String] -> IO [String] pOpenExecuteListPrograms l = do list <- P.mapM openGetProgramResult l return list \n I know the return types are different but that doesn't really matter right now. The parallel version also works fine.\n I compiled the program with -threaded and -O2. I ran it with +RTS -N -s for both versions and got the following results.\n For the parallel version:\n Parallel version\n For the sequential version\n sequential version\n So the parallel version is way faster. However, it did not start any sparks. My understanding from Haskell parallelism is that sparks are like mini threads, so if it's doing parallel work, it should be using sparks no?\n Could anyone explain what is happening here? Thank you so much, hope this kind of question is allowed.\n ​\n Edit: Wrong link for Monad.Parallel\n    submitted by    /u/CHOVI_3  \n [link]   [comments]",

However, when I package these libraries with my program they are not recognized as safe to run on others' systems, so in order to run my program a user has to go through a launch, crash, allow library to be run cycle for each of the libs I link against until everything is allowed. This is obviously a no-go from a user friendliness perspective.\n I figured if I could link against the Mac frameworks for the libs that they should be signed (as they've been released as frameworks) and the user would only have to go through this allow process for just my app executable (until I get it signed). However, I'm not sure how to link against the frameworks.\n I tried repointing the executable to the framework dylibs using the install_name_tool, but the versions differ between the homebrew and framework versions of the libs, which made my app not run -- I've since thought better of trying to use this method in case there were incompatibilities between the entry points of the lib versions.\n My next thought was that I would have to link to the frameworks at build-time, but adding the -framework ghc option when I run stack build doesn't seem to have any effect -- it still points to the homebrew versions. Maybe the Haskell bindings are set to point at the homebrew versions only?\n This is the first user-facing application I've developed on Mac, so I'm in a bit over my head. I'd like to have the standard DMG/drag-the-app-into-Applications installer for the app, as I don't know that homebrew would be the friendliest install method for my target audience.\n Any help or suggestions are appreciated!\n    submitted by    /u/paul_schnapp  \n [link]   [comments]",

And after about 8 chapters I saw very little “real world”.\n I find that most education material seems to run all examples in the repl. And that is just off putting to me. Especially when I see “real world” apps and I can’t understand what’s going on.\n Also I find that too many tutorials focus way too much on math problems. And that’s cool. But how do I get from math problems to building entire apps. To me there doesn’t seem to be any real progression.\n I know plenty of languages and I found I learn better by trying to build real things. Yet I find most Haskell tutorials and education shy away from showing real world applications. And reading source code is confusing since it’s hard to distinguish between built in functions and user defined functions.\n Anyway is there a middle ground between these heavily mathematical examples. And actual real world application. There seems to be a lot of ceremony in real world Haskell apps.\n I do enjoy the Haskell type system. And I like it’s expressiveness. I wish I could enjoy it like others do. I just have never got that “aha” moment because it’s hard to just jump in and get dirty with the language.\n Any suggestions?\n    submitted by    /u/branh0913  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "So i have this assignment where i have to code a game called \"Nim\" where two players take turns removing objects from distinct heaps or piles, and the player that gets to remove the last object wins. I've already coded a function for doing a specific move, i.e : play [1,2,3,4] (3,2) = [1,2,1,4]. [1,2,3,4] would be the number of objects on each tile, and (3,2) would be removing 2 objects from the third tile. I also coded a function that gives a list of all the posible plays on a specific board position, i.e: possiblePlays [1,2,3] = [(1,1), (2,2),(2,1),(3,3), (3,2), (3,1)] The problem i'm having is that now i have to code a function that tells me if a board position (like [1,2,3,4]) is \"winnable\": a board position is winnable if a play exists that can lead to the other player getting a not winnable board position. i.e: isItWinnable [] = False (because you can't make another move, so you lose) isItWinnable [1] = True (because you get to remove the last object). I think these could be the base cases, but i'm having a lot of trouble thinking the recursion. I'm sorry for the long post and the messy english, it's not my native language and i had to translate everything from spanish. If anyone has any ideas or tips it would be greatly appreciated.

          "description": "I would like to model software APIs in a best-practice-functional-programming manner. I am wondering how professionals typically go about this problem. What are existing best practices, and so forth.\n More specifically, for my current project, I want to model several geometric primitives (e.g., circle, sphere, triangle) such that I can effectively reason about them and use effective type-checking. I will render them with different backends, and will handle that elsewhere (e.g., JavaScript), but I want to be sure I am effectively modeling the geometric types.\n I'd like to use Haskell.\n The obvious way to go about this would be to begin writing data types in Haskell and potentially use that to generate other code via Template Haskell. Is there a flaw with this approach? I've considered using XML, or using Haskell to generate XML as an intermediate, but I'm not sure if that's necessary or flawed in some way.\n In general, I'd also like to use whatever approach I develop to model systems in the future. I'm not sure what the best way of going about it is. I'm wondering if anyone has any experience with this, or can point me to some references, so that I don't begin coding something that is doomed to be suboptimal for reasons known to those who know.

          "description": "Now that I have used backpack in raaz which has internally simplified the package quite a bit. However there are some ergonomic issues in their use at-least in raaz.\n  \nFirstly, I am not sure why backpack performs the mixing and matching in the .cabal file. I feel it makes the .cabal file rather large and unwieldy. The raaz.cabal is close to 900 lines of code with no real way to split it up. It is probably one of the biggest file in the repository\n \nThe documentation story is not very nice. Say Module A which depends on Signature Sig in an internal module. Now suppose the top library wants expose a version of A with some module mixed in for Sig, all the documentation of the functions defined are lost. One can solve this as this can be seen here. https://github.com/raaz-crypto/raaz/blob/master/raaz/Raaz/Digest.hs Documenting the functions in the source module (A in this case) is not useful because it is not visible one has to repeat this again in the outside exposed module. Whereas writing the documentation close to the function definition (in module A) make more sense.\n \nMismatch between documentation for hackage vs created by cabal haddock.\n \n I think 2,3 are probably bugs, or there is a way to handle it that I do not know about, but 1 is a design choice. It is curious because ghc supports .bkp files which is not recommended though. Currently .bkp files are only used to include test cases in ghc the compiler or to demonstrate backpack.\n    submitted by    /u/piyushkurur  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm some distance from guru-dom, so I'm half pattern matching things I've pieced together over time. So far, I've got:\n - Cask on the back (no complicated effect frameworks for me!)\n - Laminar on the front\n Where I'm struggling, is joining them up. The idiom I'm following separates the definition of the API from it's implementation,.\n trait TodoApi {def listAll: Future[Either[String, Seq[Todos]]]} \n But this can fail in two ways\n  \nNetwork\n Json parsing\n  \nI wanted to use upickle and sttp. Both look simple enough, and should both work back and frontend ... helpful for me to learn fewer frameworks.\n def listAll1: Future[Response[Either[String,Try[Seq[Todos]]]]] = { basicRequest.get(uri\"$ApiHost/todo\") .mapResponseRight(r => Try(read[Seq[Todos]](r))).send() } \n But look at the method signature! So okay...\n object ToDoApiImpl extends TodoApi { def flattenFutureEitherTry[A](a: Future[Response[Either[String,Try[A]]]]) : Future[Either[String, A]] = { for (fut <- a) yield { fut.body match { case Left(value) => Left(value) case Right(value) => { val something = value.toEither something.left.map(_.toString()) } } } } } override def listAll: Future[Either[String,Seq[Todos]]] = flattenFutureEitherTry(listAll1) } \n Somehow, this feels... not right. It took me quite some time poking that with a sharp stick to get it to compile. And my eyeballs hurt :-(.\n Does anyone have suggestions for something more idiomatic / easier?

He is using pattern matching, based on the match respective case function is executed and on top using higher order functions to work with this data types by generalizing the pure functions and passing these pure functions to HOF\n For Example \n trait List[A]\n case object Nil extends List[Nothing]\n case class Cons[A](head:A,tail:Cons:List[A]) extends List[A]\n In the book, He used a companion object List\n object List {\n // some functions to manipulate the list data type \n }\n ​\n the pattern is similar for option data type as well but all the functions are implemented in trait body\n My question is what is the need to do things this way ?.

I would like to know your general opinions in how does compare PS with Elm and Idris for complex projects, specially whether it is worth for the mid long run (for example a small SPA might be done faster and easier with Elm).\n In one hand I felt Elm does an awesome job at the time of reducing the boilerplate and go to the point, however Evan’s focus is not always to keep a consistent programming language and I am afraid I would lack some abstractions at some point.\n Regarding Idris, it is totally the opposite direction from Elm, the compiler is immature and Idris 2 is just not ready. I like from dependent types that we can make a type dependent on a single attribute such as Matrixes with its dimensions and let the compiler verify that at compile time, however all that becomes messy when trying something beyond trivial examples. I believe that by using higher order types with purescript that’s possible as well, but I couldn’t find yet a working example (perhaps I should just try).\n Last but not least, a big missing in all the ML family is somewhat logic programming (or prolog dialect), so being not many kanrens for any of those I would believe all three are even in this aspect.\n    submitted by    /u/nudpiedo  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Dear Orgers... :)\n In the org manual, \"7.5.3 Capturing column view\", in https://orgmode.org/manual/Capturing-column-view.html#Capturing-column-view says:\n  \nSince column view is just an overlay over a buffer, it cannot be exported or printed directly. If you want to capture a column view, use a ‘columnview’ dynamic block (see Dynamic Blocks). The frame of this block looks like this: \n #+BEGIN: columnview :hlines 1 :id \"label\" \n #+END: \n This dynamic block has the following parameters: \n ‘:id’ - This is the most important parameter. Column view is a feature that is often localized to a certain (sub)tree, and the capture block might be at a different location in the file. To identify the tree whose view to capture, you can use four values: \n -- ‘local’ - Use the tree in which the capture block is located. \n -- ‘global’ - Make a global view, including all headings in the file. \n -- ‘file:FILENAME’ Run column view at the top of the FILENAME file. \n -- ‘LABEL’ - Call column view in the tree that has an ‘ID’ property with the value LABEL. You can use M-x org-id-copy to create a globally unique ID for the current entry and copy it to the kill-ring.\n  \nSince the option for ‘LABEL’ says, \"Call column view in the tree that has an ‘ID’ property...\", my question is: how do you capture a column view that is in the same file, but another tree?\n For example\n  \nchapter \n subtitle\n another subtitle that tries to capture the tree with logs\n \n another chapter \n tree with logs (that can be seen as column-view)\n \n  \nAs always, thank you very much for your generous help, time and attention... :)\n Best regards...\n    submitted by    /u/edumerco  \n [link]   [comments]",

Then when having a meeting with that person I'd be able to pull up a list of all the tasks that are associated with that person.\n In my current system (in Notion) I actually have a page per person, so that I can write some notes about them, such as favorite food etc. In that setup the tagging of a person to a task and the person's info page is one in the same (2 tables that are linked).

So I will try to explain what this client-server model is in terms of emacs and I seek suggestions from this community about the validity of my understanding.\n So client-server model is basically used for utilizing the same running instance of emacs instead of opening up a new session everytime. How emacs does this is it creates a emacs server instance which keeps running in the background . Now if I want to to do something with emacs by using that single instance running in the background I will do so by emacsclient binary. For example if I want to open a file in gui frame (emacsclient -c filename) emacsclient will direct the emacs server to do so. I can create many instances of emacsclient which will use the same emacs server instance that is running in the background. By doing so I can do things in one session. Avoid the time cost of starting up a whole new session and open files quickly. There are different switches for emacsclient and emacs server which one can utilize to use different features provided by both of them. \n Thats it.

Is this still the case?\n This type of movement is very fundamental for my workflow, especially when programming with my voice (being able to say \"one four dip just\" to delete 14 lines down, for example).\n Is there any way to achieve equally efficient vertical movement in emacs?\n    submitted by    /u/them_vibes  \n [link]   [comments]",

So far it's pretty cool.\n If you aren't familiar with toolbox it's a nice wrapper around Podman that makes working with ad-hoc containers super easy.\n I have emacs in a flatpak and a toolbox with my C development environment installed. My goal was to hook them together so that I could use Eglot to develop C programs like I normally do.\n There's the docker-tramp project but this didn't work right for me... not sure what the issue was. The wonderful emacs wiki has a page on Tramp and Docker with some example code. So, I took it and modified it to use toolbox:\n (push (cons \"toolbox\" '((tramp-login-program \"flatpak-spawn --host toolbox\") (tramp-login-args ((\"enter\" \"-c\") (\"%h\"))) (tramp-remote-shell \"/bin/sh\") (tramp-remote-shell-args (\"-i\") (\"-c\")))) tramp-methods) \n Now I can C-x C-f /toolbox:fedora-toolbox-34: and open any file from inside the toolbox environment. I installed ccls in the toolbox and then Eglot was up and running. How about vterm-toggle? Like a charm... dropped me directly into a shell. Super cool.\n It seems like a few flaming hoops to jump through, and it's not a wrong assessment either. But when it's all working it's completely transparent and quite amazing, considering that Emacs and the development tools are running in different containers.

I never did really get to the point where I felt comfortable looking through logs though. I would often use \"Ediff\" to compare two files, and take screenshots for Zendesk, but nothing too fancy.\n This time around though, its a bit more involved so I'm asking for some Emacs Wizards to help me find some suitable new packages to pump my config with.\n This being noted, I have to use GCP (Google Cloud Provider) to then SSH into a related sandbox environment. On that note, can Tramp be used in that scenario to make those two hops (aka to a GCP box, and then to an ssh box?)\n ​\n For the main topic though, does anyone have any good ideas on any packages that are great at grepping through a bunch of logs, and also how to re-direct anything that's found into separate files? \n ​\n So far though, I've been able to connect through 'ansi-term' just fine but would love to somehow take that same terminal connection and do some more crazy Emacs stuff with it. \n ​\n Very curious to see what people have in mind.

Emacs gui on the other hand displays my custom theme correctly.\n To work around this problem and have both versions with the same theme I configured my init.el in the following way:\n ```\n (load-theme 'wombat)\n (add-to-list 'default-frame-alist '(background-color . \"0x030c11\"))\n (add-to-list 'default-frame-alist '(foreground-color . \"0xd3d0c8\"))\n (set-background-color \"#030c11\")\n ```\n I don't know why but it's the only way to display the same background. After opening the gui version, the flip side of this is the following error reported below the mode line: undefined color: \"undefined\". It's not so annoying and it disappears after the first input but I'd like to fix it.\n Do you know how can I solve the theme conflict between the two versions or how to remove the error message as a work-around?\n My init.el: https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/jMDvYrTwNK/\n Thanks in advance!\n    submitted by    /u/loquat-01  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I wonder if there is a simple solution to have a UI to navigate packages information with straight.el. It is mentioned in the README from straight that\n  \nany UI is provided by the user's completing-read framework\n  \nI would love to see examples of it ! (or build it myself)\n ​\n I tried something myself using marginalia and the metadata provided by package.el. I added this to to my init to associate the recipe keyword with package annotation :\n (add-to-list 'marginalia-prompt-categories '(\"\\\\<recipe\\\\>\" . package)) \n But I also have to (package-initialize) somewhere in my init since marginalia-annotate-package relies on package-alist and package-archive-contents. \n ​\n Of course its a far from ideal solution. It doesn't work for all recipes, relies on package.el and doesn't inform about the current status of installed packages. For a proper solution, I think one could reuse part of the mechanism package.el uses to get packages information like package-load-descriptor, combine it with information from straight and finally add information provided by git for each repo.\n ​\n Does anyone know about packages or obscure init files that go in this direction ?\n    submitted by    /u/ConsistentAuthor8411  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have an org file with recipes as headings, and immediately beneath each heading is the ingredients list as a table, followed by a list of instructions. I want to go through each week and pick an arbitrary number of recipes to cook by toggling a todo state on the heading. I want to write a function to concatenate all of the ingredients tables from the recipes I select for the week. I think I want to do something like this:\n (org-element-map (org-element-parse-buffer 'element) 'table (lambda (table) (when (string= (org-element-property :status table) \"MAKE\") ...code to concat table...))) \n The missing piece with this idea is that I don't want to set a table property manually, but I also don't know how to set a property on a table based on the parent heading's todo state. Todo state triggers weren't meant for this it seems. I'm reading the documentation of course, but it's a little slow-going and I'm not that familiar with all of Org's built-in functions that might help with something like this. And this might not even be a great approach! So does anyone have recommendations on things to investigate or an alternative approach?\n    submitted by    /u/AblatedSprocket  \n [link]   [comments]",

I've looked at the solutions that other people used, but none of it has worked out for me yet. \n (Namely: https://github.com/ahungry/org-jira/issues/21 and https://github.com/ahungry/org-jira/issues/186)\n I've noticed that if I use the constructed curl command with my username and password manually, I get what I *think* is a valid response. Otherwise, I see this X-AUSERNAME: anonymous in the messages. I tried creating a .authinfo file, but it changes nothing. Org-JIRA only asked my for my credentials once and never again.\n Internally, I use either a login/password or SSO to log in, but it doesn't look like our system has the same API token functionality that the Atlassian site does. I tried finding the cloud.session.token to use with the authorization workaround, but nothing that I did surfaced it. I'm not really a web guy, so I was just making some stabs in the dark.\n This is all on Windows; I'm not sure to what extent that makes a difference, but I've seen problems with that in the last few days in other packages. \n Anyone else have anything else I can try?\n    submitted by    /u/vjgoh  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "In my job I edit a lot of text files. Gvim has a lot of options that make editing text really fast. Like yyp to copy a line and paste it or * to automatically search for the word under the cursor. \n I often end up with a lot of vim windows open that create a clutter. I also have a lot of projects to work on and I need some place to keep my notes for these and organize my tasks. I hear that managing such things with emacs should be easy with orgmode and that it should be able to match the text editing provided by vim.\n However most of the things I find are related to installing packages from the internet. At work I don't have the ability to install anything. For vim pluging i am able to copy the plugin and create the files manually. Is this possible to do in emacs? \n Also any tips for switching to emacs? I feel a lot slower with emacs to switch and edit file even though I find things like file browsing directly from emacs is much nicer than what is in gvim.\n So can the vanilla emacs match gvim in terms of text editing, and are there any features which are possible in gvim but not in emacs?\n    submitted by    /u/Suitable-Yam7028  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "desktop-save-mode had caused me issues before because of different ways of starting Emacs :- command line \"emacs\", as a service (\"systemctl --user enable Emacs\") with the system starting it, as emacsclient (emacsclient -c ) or even from your own startup with something like \"emacs --daemon\". Anyway, this little snippet \"works for me\" and might be of interest to others. All self-contained in a use-package form. If starting as a daemon do the desktop read after the first frame is created, else do it immediately after emacs-startup-hook is triggered. The only thing that scuppered me a little was not checking the supplied emacs.service systemd config - it hardcodes the Emacs path, starting the wrong Emacs version and causing straight.el to recompile everything on startup : solution to that is copying /usr/lib/systemd/user/emacs.service to ~/.config/systemd/user and altering the paths to your own Emacs version (Debian paths there).\n The settings of desktop-save and desktop-path in combination with needing a desktop-read call are, on observation, what caused much confusion out there in google land. \n Maybe not news to many, but I thought I'd share the snippet as googling showed it's still an issue for some.\n ​\n  (use-package emacs :custom (desktop-path '(\"~/.emacs.d/var/desktop\")) (desktop-save t) :init (defun rgr/restore-desktop() (when (fboundp 'alert) (alert (message (format \"loading desktop from %s\" desktop-path)))) ;;I include the run-with-timer despite being able to get this to work without as it's a timing ;;issue and a little delay does no one any harm (run-at-time \"1\" nil (lambda() (desktop-read) (desktop-save-mode 1)))) (add-hook 'emacs-startup-hook (lambda() (if (daemonp) (add-hook 'server-after-make-frame-hook 'rgr/restore-desktop) (rgr/restore-desktop))))) \n    submitted by    /u/RichieHHam  \n [link]   [comments]",

Plus, I don't really like scrolling line by line, so I've been trying to have emacs scroll smoothly.\n Sadly, I've found the emacs smooth scrolling experience to be janky at best: no matter what workarounds I use (I've tried several, including all of those listed on the emacswiki page as well as good-scroll.el), smooth scrolling feels sluggish, not fluid, and often unresponsive.\n I wonder what the root cause for this is. Most of the explanations I've read revolve around emacs' lack of animation support. For example, the github page of smooth-scroll.el states the following:\n  \nScrolling sometimes pauses or stutters. It's unclear exactly why, but one factor is that Emacs lacks animation support. Emacs has timers for updating the screen contents, which is enough for playing simple animated GIF files, but not enough for video playback or frame-perfect smooth scrolling.\n  \nMy question is the following: what would it take to fix it? I know that emacs is very old, and some features might just be outside of its capabilities (at least for now). Is smooth scrolling support one such feature?\n I understand that emacs wasn't made with smooth scrolling in mind, and I don't mean to criticize and/or diminish the amazing work that went into it. I'm extremely happy with my emacs experience--smooth scrolling would just be the icing on the cake.\n Thank you in advance!\n    submitted by    /u/M-x_  \n [link]   [comments]",

I like that they're relatively light weight.\n I've used helm for a long time, and it's honestly very good, but I'm mostly only using it for its locate functionality now. I use everything search on windows, which in combination with the .dir-locals.el lets me set a search instance depending on the directory I start the search from. I know about projectile, of course, but it's slower and more finicky than everything. (With everything, I can set up a search that spans many directories on many drives and make it a named instance, and then just query the named instance in the arguments.)\n Helm's locate is the only decent and maintained way to do this that I've found. Scrounging up random .el files from EmacsWiki doesn't really work for me.\n If there isn't, no big deal. I'll keep helm updated.\n    submitted by    /u/vjgoh  \n [link]   [comments]",

This seems to make sense as there doesn't seem to be a way to auto magically auto assimilate (but being very new to this, there might be one I overlooked). \n ​\n https://github.com/rileyrg/Emacs-Customisations/blob/borg-full/init.el\n ​\n Thanks for any hand holding and pointers.\n    submitted by    /u/RichieHHam  \n [link]   [comments]",

(auto-hide-function . delete-frame)))) \n This causes the *PDF-Occur* buffer to be displayed in a newly-created (\"pop-up\") frame instead of splitting the frame with the PDF document into two windows. (The auto-hide-function causes that frame to be deleted when one \"quits\" the window in that new frame. That is, when you press q in that buffer, the newly-created frame is deleted.)\n However, there is a secondary problem. When you select the occurence you care about in the *PDF-Occur* buffer and press RETURN, it splits that frame vertically and displays the PDF in the lower-half of that frame (again, in a too-small-to-read format).\n I fixed that by adding a function to the hook for the *PDF-Occur* buffer's mode like this:\n `` (defun my-pdf-occur-buffer-mode-hook () \"CauseRETURN' in this buffer to use the window already displaying the PDF and return focus there.\" (make-local-variable 'display-buffer-alist) (setq display-buffer-alist (cons '(\".*\\.pdf$\" (display-buffer-reuse-window) (reusable-frames . t)) (default-value 'display-buffer-alist))))\n (add-hook 'pdf-occur-buffer-mode-hook #'my-pdf-occur-buffer-mode-hook) ```\n Of course, I'm happy to learn if you have critiques of how I did this—or about any of this.\n    submitted by    /u/cfraizer  \n [link]   [comments]",

This is possible with chemacs2. \n I followed the README but I'll add that one should also delete their package-quickstart.el and other similar files that use hard-coded paths, before moving everything around. \n Once you have your usual emacs in .emacs.default, you can for example create an empty .emacs.future (or any other name), and set it as a profile in .emacs-profiles.el. \n Next, you can download emacs and build from source with native compilation if you'd like. Do not make install, rather we'll use the path to the newly built executable. \n Since chemacs2 keeps everything emacs as calls to the default directory, you won't have to change much. \n What you can do now, is alias to the more recent emacs executable with the future profile. For example, I put the emacs repo in ~/emacs. Meaning that I can do :\n alias ef=\"/my/home/emacs/src/emacs --with-profile future\" \n To use a different profile with the built from source executable. \n Thanks to that I have two different versions of emacs with different init files, living together.\n    submitted by    /u/NoisyFrequency  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Emacs offers CUA-mode out of the box to address users expectations for normal C-c (copy), C-v (paste), C-z (undo) commands. Indeed, this is often an issue that comes up when I am teaching newcomers Emacs. So, why don't I hear about this being used more? Why don't I use it? Why was one of my joys in adopting EXWM the ability to use emacs shortcuts INSTEAD of CUA in other progams? Essentially I went the opposite direction.\n Even for those years when I was learning emacs, no part of me ever longed to regain the key bindings that were used everywhere else, and that is strange in retrospect. Was it because learning new keybindings was part of the emacs experience? Or because CUA bindings are already only relevant to Windows users and not Mac keybords? Was it because there is something qualitatively different about killing, yanking, and emacs' undo style than the copy-paste-undo of everything else? I admit, whenever I am forced into non-emacs programs, I do long for the kill ring.\n What do you think? Why is CUA-Mode so rarely brought up as a first step (and therefore rarely brought up at all)?\n    submitted by    /u/WorldsEndless  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello r/emacs.\n ​\n I have recently set up a neat feature for Emacs that I wanted to share with you. I am going to give you a short description of what this is supposed to be here, but for more details, and the required code snippets you can check my github repository where I also host my dotfiles.\n ​\n So, if you are tiling window manager user, you have probably heard of scratchpads. If you haven't, they are floating windows with predefined dimensions which are automatically hidden when they lose focus. Why is this useful you may ask? Well, I personally dislike leaving Emacs, especially when I want to write a large piece of text. But there are some things (mostly when I am doing something on the web, such as creating this reddit post) which I can't directly do in Emacs. This project tries to solve this project.\n ​\n I have basically set up my window manager of choice (qtile, but I do plan to try and make this for other window managers such as i3) to create a scratchpad of Emacs which opens in a placeholder file and an emacs command which when ran, copies the whole buffer to the clipboard and then deletes it from the file so it can be used again. This allows me to write everything in Emacs, in a small floating window which is visible whenever I need it and then hides itself when unneeded, using a placeholder file which is always empty and waiting for text to fill it. The setup is honestly very handy and I really like it, as the alternatives are somewhat annoying to use imo. \n ​\n For more details, check the aforementioned git repo. I hope you will enjoy it. I personally really like the idea and as I couldn't find anyone who has done something similar, I thought I should share this here so you guys can see the idea and adopt it if you like. I will gladly answer any of your questions about this and try to persuade you that its got a reasonable use-case.\n    submitted by    /u/AuroraDraco  \n [link]   [comments]",

So, I made this thing awhile back originally in the context of developing a programming language which used a lot of Unicode math symbols (basically forcing variable-width fonts) and significant whitespace. Now I use it for all of my personal note files, and it seems like other people might find it useful so I'm releasing it.\n https://github.com/tenbillionwords/spaceship-mode\n ​\n spaceship-mode\n What this basically does is:\n  \nspaceship-mode makes spaces at the start of a line have their width automatically adjusted to align with previous text as they would in a fixed-width font. Example pictured.\n tabble-mode is an implementation of elastic tabstops.\n  \nTogether these make it possible in principle to do every kind of alignment I have ever seen being useful in an actual programming or plaintext-note-taking situation.\n Using spaceship-mode absolutely requires adhering to the convention of using tabs for indentation and spaces for alignment. Unfortunately, that means these modes work very badly with stock Emacs, yet I am not providing any kind of user-interface features such as commands to help use and maintain the indentation conventions, or any keybindings at all. It wouldn't do to just quickly slap something together, because Emacs' assumption of fixed-width fonts is fairly deeply entrenched in its design, and peeps have very different preferences and methods for dealing with indentation in general. (And I'm not providing my own full setup because...reasons.) So if you want to get this working well, you'll have to do some work to integrate it into your own system. The “Example Setup” in the readme may give some indication of how to start doing this.\n P.S.

This is also where it gets dirty.\n My next thought was to push back on the user in emacs with the error message and let him open a new buffer where he can change the js code sent, ideally also caching the previous responses so he can build a reportoire of code that loads needed sets of dependencies quickly.\n Any ideas on how to make this sort of interactivity happen?\n    submitted by    /u/betwi3and20  \n [link]   [comments]",

So I created a second Hydra and linked Hydra #1 and Hydra #2 together via designated keys (as explained here). \n The problem is that I’ve memorized many of the bindings associated with both Hydra #1 and Hydra #2, and I want to use all bindings at any time, regardless of whether Hydra #1 or Hydra #2 is showing. This means I have to add every binding relevant to smartparens to BOTH defhydra definitions. This takes up a lot of space in my init.el, and it’s not as simple as copy-pasting because I don’t want hints that show up in Hydra #1 to show up in Hydra #2 (and vice versa), so I have to change the string hints to nil or change nil to string hints as appropriate. \n I’ve partially solved this last problem by having Hydra #2 inherit the bindings of Hydra #1 with the following:\n (set-keymap-parent hydra-smartparens2/keymap hydra-smartparens1/keymap) \n However, I can’t simultaneously have Hydra #1 inherit Hydra #2's bindings, as this creates the error cyclic keymap inheritance. Thus, unless I’m missing something (and I hope I am), some copy-pasting from Hydra #2 to Hydra #1 is still necessary.\n It would be great if I could have a single Hydra for smartparens that possessed a height limit and could be scrolled to see the hints that get cut off, like which-key allows. Different displays vary greatly in the horizontal screen real estate they allow. Should I check out hercules.el, or is there an obvious solution I’m missing? \n P.S.

I use the clock timer (C-x C-i) to time myself when working in different files, and it has always worked a treat. But recently I cleaned up the structure of my org folder, which had lots of subfolders for different clients. I moved all of these folders from /org into a new folder, /org/archive, to give myself a nice clean place to work. Now, however, when I try to start the clock timer, emacs refuses and instead shows me this:\n Use M-x make-directory RET RET to create the directory and its parents [165 times] apply: Setting current directory: No such file or directory, /home/me/org/client-folder/ \n Where client-folder is the name of a client. I'm guessing that it's trying to check all of my existing files for dangling, unclosed timers, but I don't need it to do that. \n I tried deleting the org-clock-save.el file in my emacs directory, which the program then recreated, but this is empty. \n What's telling emacs to look for files in their old directories, and how can I make it stop, or at least redirect it to the new directory path?\n    submitted by    /u/the_grepster  \n [link]   [comments]",

There is very little going on in the channel, but it has several very knowledgeable people in it. In the last few days there has been a push for many channels to migrate from Freenode to Libera due to mismanagement. I've set up #evil-mode@Libera to make it easy to find, but have been approached by an #emacs@Libera representative while trying to chanop status for #emacs-circe@Libera (I already have chanop for #emacs-circe@Freenode). That individual suggested me that #evil-mode@Libera might be better named #emacs-evil@Libera to fit into the Emacs namespace and profit from management by several channel operators.\n I find this idea highly intriguing, but don't want to impose the mental burden of people having to migrate from #evil-mode to #emacs-evil, especially for a Libera-only thing (the existing Freenode channel is still there, though slowly thinning out). Therefore the following options are on the table:\n a) Leave things as is, with #evil-mode@Libera following the existing naming\n b) Create #emacs-evil@Libera, set up a redirect from #evil-mode@Libera to #emacs-evil@Libera and adjust documentation accordingly\n c) Other (explain in your comment what other option you see)\n    submitted by    /u/wasamasa  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I am trying to make an extension to the wonderful Deft package that can preview/view files in a side window of the Deft buffer (similar to the functionality of the original Notational Velocity). Deft normally takes a set of text files and for each file, displays a widget in the Deft buffer that, when pressed/clicked, opens the corresponding file. For my extension, I would like the file to be opened in the side window with that window having focus, but with the Deft buffer window still visible. I have had some success getting this to work, but I came across a situation with different behaviors depending whether one \"presses\" the file widget (by hitting [RET] when the point is on a file widget), or one \"clicks\" the file widget (by clicking the widget with the mouse):\n  \nIf the file is opened by hitting [RET] (invoking widget-button-press), the file is opened in the side window below and the file’s window now has focus. This is the desired behavior that I want.\n If the file is opened by clicking with the mouse (invoking widget-button-click), the file is opened in the side window below, but the focus remains with the Deft buffer. This is not the desired behavior.\n  \nTo demonstrate this phenomenon, I have made a \"minimal\" example of it in a package I call \"Daft\": \n https://github.com/shankar2k/daft\n How can I make a widget-button-click action that can switch focus to a different window other than the current one?\n    submitted by    /u/cottasteel  \n [link]   [comments]",

The problem is, that when error occurs, the error path is correctly detected in *compilation* buffer, but because there are two spaces before the actual path Emacs can't find the file. For example, here's the output:\n stack traceback: [C]: in function 'assert' tests/multivalues-test.fnl:17: in main chunk [C]: in function 'xpcall' /home/andreyorst/.luarocks/bin/fennel:4398: in function ? [C]: in ? make: *** [Makefile:32: test] Error 1 \n Here, when I press RET on the tests/multivalues-test.fnl:17: in main chunk line, Emacs tries to open \" tests/multivalues-test.fnl\" file (two leading spaces are included as part of the path (reddit strips those even in backticks for some reason)).\n I've tried modifying compilation-error-regexp-alist-alist variable by adding there the following regex as per this SO question answer\n (add-to-list 'compilation-error-regexp-alist-alist '(fennel \"^.*\\\\([a-zA-Z/][^\\n:]+\\\\):\\\\([0-9]+\\\\):\" 1 2)) \n But no luck, Emacs still tries to open path with leading spaces.

In embark, customize-set-variable is in embark-variable-map, and selecting that action jumps straight to setting the value for the target variable. I've been reading through the embark source and trying various things and just failing to figure this out. At first it seemed that the variable would need an interactive property, but I couldn't figure out how to even set that, and embark manages without it anyway. I feel like I'm missing some key bit of how this process works that I'd really like to understand. Can anyone point me in the right direction here?\n    submitted by    /u/vaxdar  \n [link]   [comments]",

First, I will give some definitions and differences according to my understanding.\nA Zettelkasten is a place to not just store thoughts from other people, but to process them in your own words. The key thing here is linking the notes together to make an idea-generating resource. This can be accomplished with tags and with more direct internal links. Another important aspect is that the notes in the Zettelkasten, zettels, are atomic; that is, they are focused on one thing and one thing only.

          "description": "In the past, scientists have developed a number of impressive theories. In the case of Luhmann, we have a detailed picture of one of the crucial tools he used, this tool has been made very explicit to a degree that anyone can use it, and this tool is largely uncoupled from the individual knowledge and the cognitive skills of its users. For other scientific breakthroughs, some of them perhaps even more impressive than Luhmann's theories, we seem to know little about what methods led to these breakthroughs.\nI wonder what we could develop from this perspective - what, if any, explicit, transferable methods and tools can we extract from the works of physicists, philosophers or mathematicians? How can we combine these tools with practices from the ZK universe?\nAs far as I know, most breakthrough ideas in science and elsewhere were made without the use of a ZK - so people have used other ways to create great ideas, and it would be foolish to narrow our view on ZK-based work only.\nTo me, in most of the forum discussions we have a dominant focus on \"literature-driven\" ZK work - people read, write zettels, enrich them with their own thoughts and link them to other zettels. On the other hand I suspect that a huge part of people's crucial relevant work in life is \"problem-driven\". I'm convinced that many writers in this forum use their ZKs for this purpose, but postings about how to start thinking about a topic, how to formulate problems, how to ask questions, how to generate ideas, how to discard approaches in the ZK framework seem to me underrepresented, given their importance for creative work.",

(Like a skeptic tank)\nHis notes are really short (generally 1 to 3 sentences).\nI see nobody else using the Zettelkasten in this way. Lot of people create longer notes and try to synthesize before putting the ideas into the system.\nLast but not least: the system is created for academic research in mind.\nMy frictions:\n1) When I think and want to create new notes... having to search existing notes in the Zettelkasten stops my thinking flow.\nI am wondering if it’s not better to just create note without connection when I think... and only then look at the possible connections. But that will create a lot of duplicates.\nOr thinking more deeply before putting the note and find the connections. (But I feel I don’t leverage the Zettelkasten fully by this way)\n2) When I want to create a new content... going to the Zettelkasten kills my creative flow. As I am not creating academic content (but marketing content)... The most important in the content isn’t the information, but the emotion (you can only put emotion in a content with your first brain in a specific mood)\nBecause of this 2 things... I am wondering if a Zettelkasten is the best tool for me.\nAnd if it is... I am wondering why only luhmann work in a very atomic way without bothering of the quality of the note. And why mainy people create longer note with digital zettelkasten.\nMy question:\nI deliberately don’t ask a specific question because at this point, I don’t really know what is the good question to ask myself.\nMaybe: How to determine the best way of organizing the process and scope of permanent notes ?\nThanks for reading.\nDamian",

Inbox consists of notes I might need to work upon in the future.  My inbox keeps growing much faster in volume than my core notes. There're three main sources of its growth.\nFirstly, I regularly read professional feeds with a wide range of information that I have no time to integrate right now. Mostly this is a specific momentarily info that might be unavailable in the future (or simply hard to find) so saving it seems pretty important to me.\nOn the one hand, this inbox propagation seems natural to me - I find that diving into that knowledge dump from time to time turns out pretty useful. And the power of weak connections works with notes as much as with people.\nMaybe somebody wants to comment on this? Have you been in a similar situation?",
