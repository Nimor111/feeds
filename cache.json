A query result can be checked whether the returned data matches a set of validators, and then the returned variable will have these verifications expressed as its static type.\n For example:\n data EmailsTableColumns = PersonId | EMail class Col a in…",

You can check out our talk and our paper at ICFP2021. \n If you know Haskell (whether you are a beginner or a veteran), I want to invite you to participate in my online user study (code challenge). You can check out some features of the Chameleon debugger during the study. The study is anonymous, and it will take you about 10 - 15 minutes to complete. But it will help us immensely.

          "description": "Lists in Haskell are often used as persistent generators rather than data structures. This usually works very well, but can result in massive space leaks. Consider the contrived example below:\n main = print leak list = enumFrom <$> [0..] bigNumber = 10000000 leak = map (\\n -> list !! n !! bigNumber) [1..100] \n I reworked this example to avoid space leaks by defining a Gen typeclass which supports generators of infinite lists:\n {-# LANGUAGE FunctionalDependencies #-} module Main where main = print noleak genlist = EnumFrom <$> [0..] noleak = map(\\n -> gens !! n `idx` bigNumber) [1..100] bigNumber = 10000000 -- For potentially terminating generators, val :: a -> Maybe b and next :: a -> Maybe a class Gen a b | a -> b where val :: a -> b next :: a -> a newtype EnumFrom = EnumFrom {value :: Int} instance Gen EnumFrom Int where val = value next = EnumFrom . (+1) . value idx :: Gen a b => a -> Int -> b idx a n = val $ iterate next a !! n \n Although this approach works, simply being able to use a list would be far more convenient.\n My question: is there a way to make lists not leak space, or is there at least a solid library for non-memoizing iterators and generators?\n Edit: Thank you for the answers given so far!

I had written the entire thing (still rather small here) using the normal string (or [Char]) type. Though after reading up on how I could make a strip function I found out using Text is apparently a lot better overall and already has a strip function built-in (tho no replace from to). So I ported my program to using Text and noticed that some functionality just flies out the window which I did use quite a lot (Pattern matching for example), or is rather cumbersome to use (Concatenation, especially to normal strings; comparing with normal hard coded strings (less so than concat))\n So how should I replace such things when using Text? Constantly writing T. (as the package says one should) isn't really all that nice either, though I mind that less. I'm mostly missing the pattern-matching/recursion stuff and being able to easily compare/concat a Text to a hardcoded string. The constant T.append (T.pack \"my string\") myText just feels really verbose and unwieldly compared to \"my string\" ++ myText...

          "description": "Alright, I know this isn't really a Haskell question per se (being about emulating a Haskell language feature in another language) -- but I figured posting here would give me the best probability of getting an answer.\n Some of you may know that profunctor optics have been spotted in an open-sourced part of the Minecraft code-base, among other things. \n While this is neat, emulating profunctor optics in Java (though I haven't looked at the actual encoding in the library) seems relatively straightforward to me: Java interfaces with generic methods can be used to encode rank N types, and a lightweight encoding of higher-kinded-types in langues with only first order generics is well-known.\n What I'm interested in with this library is the among other things. I noticed in the library documentation that (at least according to package naming scheme), this library also seems to have an encoding of type families in Java. This seems to be backed up by the fact that one of the linked papers in the readme of the project also uses type families. \n This is more surprising to me. I know Java generics are Turing complete, but as far as I know, there are no academic results that would lead me to believe that type families can be emulated in Java (as I remember, the paper essentially uses an encoding of grammars as a kind of fluent interface in the proof of Turing completeness).\n Does anyone know anything about this seeming emulation of type families in Java? Has anyone tried to wrap their head around it, or know of any academic papers on how this works, or is this encoding a novel result applied just in this code-base , that has yet to be rigorously studied?\n    submitted by    /u/sintrastes  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I'm working on a pretty interesting project right now and I'm having different results depending on the build tool used: with cabal, the test suite fails but it passes with stack.\n My guess is that there must be some dependency version difference. So far I tried to \"dump\" the dependencies used by cabal using cabal freeze, and stack ls dependencies when using stack. An issue that I found is that while cabal uses my system-wide GHC (8.8.4), stack uses the GHC version defined by the resolver (8.6.5). Then, different base versions result in very different dependencies versions.\n Nevertheless, the test suite passes if I build the project using stack test --system-ghc (it uses GHC 8.8.4). I'm not really sure what dependencies are being used in this case (GHC 8.8.4 base or stack resolver base?). Running stack ls dependencies --system-ghc results in an error.\n So, how can I figure out why I get different results when building with the same GHC but different build tools?\n    submitted by    /u/valcron1000  \n [link]   [comments]",

Last time we actually hired someone who found us through this subreddit, and it would be awesome to do that again.\n Chordify is a music platform that you can use to automatically detect the chords in any song you like. This way we help musicians to play all of their favourite music in an easy and intuitive way. You can try it at https://chordify.net\n Now, the backend for our website and apps, that are used by millions of people worldwide, is written in Haskell! We serve the user using primarily Servant, Persistent and Esqueleto. We also have a custom Redis caching layer and use an advanced Cloud Haskell setup to distribute our chord analysis computations.\n We are quickly becoming an autonomous workforce, meaning there is pretty much no hierarchy, and we are looking to expand our fast-growing team with a pro-active, independent and creative functional programmer to further improve Chordify. You'd get the opportunity to work with advanced type systems to power a website that serves millions.\n More information and a form to apply can be found at https://jobs.chordify.net. If you have any questions, feel free to ask them in this thread, or reach out to me at [rik@chordify.net](mailto:rik@chordify.net).\n We strive for diversity in our team, and encourage people of all backgrounds and genders to apply.\n One more thing, this is explicitly NOT a remote job.

What is GHC/GHCup/Chocolatey? It seemed to me that GHC is something like a \"plugin\" required by the machine to run Haskell code, but I'm not sure of that, and I don't even have a guess for what the other terms mean (GHCup/Chocolatey)\n I also tried installing VSCode with a Haskell extension and it seemed to be the most simple solution, but I would like opinions on that: what is best/easier? VSCode or using the PowerShell/CMD with \"manual\" writing on something like Sublime?\n If the manual way is best, can anyone explain how I install/set up Haskell/GHC on my PC?

Which means I can't just free everything with free; I have to use the correct c function.\n My plan was to use the ReaderT monad to hold pointers of the allocated objects and create a typeclass for deletion which would trigger when things fall out of scope:\n class Collectable p where collect :: (MonadIO m) => p -> m () newtype CThing = CThing (Ptr ()) instance Collectable CThing where collect (CThing p) = ffi_c_delete_function_for_thing p \n I then created a newtype called 'Bin' for holding these objects:\n newtype Bin = Bin { unBin :: forall p .

Collectable p => p] } \n For the same reason.\n I then tried to call the delete functions on the environment:\n mapM collect $ unBin env \n But GHC complains again:\n Ambiguous type variable ‘a0’ arising from a use of ‘collect’ prevents the constraint ‘(Collectable a0)’ from being solved. \n Why can't it solve the constraint? I have defined a bin to contain only collectable objects!?\n As you have probably worked out by now, I have very little idea what I'm doing when it comes to higher rank polymorphism! send help!\n I have a backup plan (creating a type level list for the environment and using type families to construct the Collectable class), but it seems excessive\n    submitted by    /u/jamhob  \n [link]   [comments]",

However, reading the documentation above, and with my still-novice Haskell knowledge it is not immediately clear to me if:\n - this is going to help me learn Haskell\n I am already using a package called Freezed for immutable classes (along with a state management package called Riverpod) which in tandem with null-safety makes the code \"error-safe\" enough. \n FYI shifting from almost purely academic coding to \"doing-it-for-a-living\" was invigorating at first but now I feel trapped because I have to learn and get better at what my company uses (Dart, Flutter, FastAPI) leaving me too exhausted. I finally had a whole day off today but still ended up polishing the app I am working on. There has to be light at the end of the tunnel?\n    submitted by    /u/webNoob13  \n [link]   [comments]",

For over two decades everyone was forced to use those primitives, whenever computational performance was important. Luckily, with Scala3 there is a choice.\n Let's define an opaque type Price, which will have all the functionality of a Float, will be as fast as a Float, but will be distinct from a Float. We will need to import Scalqa.\n import scalqa.{*,given} type Price = Price.TYPE.DEF object Price extends Float.Opaque.Data.Numerical[Price](\"Price\"): inline def apply(inline v: Float): Price = v.toOpaque override def value_tag(v:Price) : String = \"$\"+v.toFloat extension(inline x: Price) // Optional custom methods inline def isNotExpensive: Boolean = x < 100 object TYPE: opaque type DEF <: Float.Opaque = Float.Opaque \n By extending Float.Opaque.Data.Numerical Price inherits numerical methods which match those for a Float primitive. Even better, all those methods are inlined, so when used, they will be reduced to primitive calls.\n Consider the following example:\n  var price : Price = Price(9.99f) var primitive: Float = 5.99f price = price * 2 primitive = primitive * 2 \n when de-compiled to Java, it is clear: the Price is treated same as a Float:\n  float price = 9.99F; float primitive = 5.99F; price *= (float)2; primitive *= (float)2; \n We can use Price with the same ease as a primitive without any concern for impact on performance.\n On the other hand Price is distinct from a Float, so the following will fail.\n  def discount(v: Price): Price = v * 0.75f discount(5.99f) // Fails // Type Mismatch Error: // Found: (5.99f : Float) // Required: Price \n    submitted by    /u/edolgy  \n [link]   [comments]",

He is my situation:\n I have a service that depends on the Firebase Admin SDK, specifically the auth module. So the live layer looks like a ZLayer[Has[FirebaseAuth], Throwable, Has[UserService]]. I'd like to mock the Firebase Auth SDK for testing, but I don't want to use the annoying emulator thing they have, it's too heavyweight and I don't want to deal with running another Docker container.\n UserService wraps around the auth SDK but has some custom logic. For example, UserService.getUserByEmail(email: String): Task[Option[UserId]] returns an effect that returns Some(UserId) (UserId being an internal domain object) if a user with this email exists, None if no user with the email exists, and fails if it was unable to complete either of these. In contrast, FirebaseAuth.getUserByEmailAsync(email: String): ApiFuture[String] returns a Java Future which fails with a specific error if a user with the email doesn't exist.\n For example, for mocking FirebaseAuth's getUserByEmail, I'd like to do something like (pseudo-code):\n  when (auth.getUserByEmailAsync(email1)) return Future.succeed(\"userid\") when (auth.getUserByEmailAsync(email2)) return Future.fail(NoSuchUserException) when (auth.getUserByEmailAsync(email3)) return Future.fail(BadEmailException) \n and use this somehow in my ZIO-test of my UserService.\n I can't find any examples of using Mockito in ZIO test. Does anyone have a code snippet they can share, or if this is better done through ZIO-test's own mocking system (I only saw mocking of ZIO services there so I am not sure if it can do more than that), can you explain how to do it?\n    submitted by    /u/crpleasethanks  \n [link]   [comments]",

Two main features set it apart from similar PureScript (or Haskell) libraries:\n  \nSQL like DSL\n  \nThe eDSL used tries to stay as close as possible to regular SQL. IMO, this has the advantage of making the translation from PureScript to SQL transparent, specially for more complex queries.\n So far, most common usage SQL keywords are supported, e.g., SELECT INSERT DELETE UPDATE UNION PREPARE, etc.\n  \nQuery mapper \n  \nQuery result rows are always expressed as records, with projected columns as keys. The query mapper can also be used independently from the DSL, in case raw SQL strings are needed.\n Feedback is highly welcomed.

          "description": "Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) is a MCMC sampling algorithm which proposes new states based on the simulation of Hamilton’s equations of motion.\nOne of the main ingredients of this algorithm is its integration scheme — how the equations are discretized and its solutions found.\nThe standard choice for this is the classical leapfrog.\nIn this blog post we present our empirical investigation of U7U_7U7​ — an algorithm that is computationally more expensive, but also more accurate.\nThis trade-off is not a simple one (after all, more precision implies less tries), but our explorations show that this is a promising algorithm, which can outperform leapfrog in some cases.\nWe don’t suppose previous knowledge of integration methods, but in case you are new to HMC or MCMC methods, a good starting point…",

          "description": "I arrange my orgmode notes as single files with lots of entries. This works great for me because emacs is more buffer-oriented than directory-oriented, so all the emacs search commands optimize for single-file approaches (eg search all headlines in my tech/blog file for the keyword of that Linux function I've forgotten how to use).\n The single problem I have is footnotes. From the documentation you have two options: inline or in a file-wide section. My footnotes are often too long to fit inline, so I can change the name of that section but CANNOT make a section-per-entry arrangement, which is what I really want. The way I have worked around this with my blog is to always have the entry I am publishing at the top of the file, so using org-footnote-new finds that entries footnote section first and inserts things where I want them to be. I've used this compromise successfully for quite some time, but it depends on the fact that you are not going to add footnotes to anything but the top entry.\n Now I am converting footnotes in a non-orgmode date made by someone else, and moving the elements to the top of the file is not an option. Does anyone know of a way of implementing an entry-by-entry footnote section (say, for every * entry, or every ** entry as the case may be) without moving the single entry to the top of the buffer? The goal is for each entry to have a working footnote section of its own, which works nicely with org-footnote-action.\n    submitted by    /u/WorldsEndless  \n [link]   [comments]",

Currently my knowledge base spans a lot of small files. Assuming I concatenated them to one file, it would clock in at 5k lines (and constantly expanding). I am worried that this large org file would slow down emacs.\n Does anyone have experience with using radio targets in such a setup?

          "description": "I still fumble for the right way to use a timestamp.\n Right now, I want to automatically add a timestamp (time of capture) to an entry when I use org-capture. What's the right way to do this? \n Should I add an inactive timestamp right down below the heading? I was thinking of doing something like CAPTURED ON: [2021-10-02]. This is easy to do inside org-capture-templates. But then the first words can have special meanings (as in DEADLINE: ) which makes it look awkward.\n Or should I just add it as a custom property? If so, are timestamps completely legal inside the PROPERTIES drawer (and will they always be?). I've seen other people add a simple date without the brackets, but this won't cut it for me cause I want to use the timestamp with org-sparse-tree.\n Or should I add it as a list entry to the LOGBOOK drawer? Accomplishing this with org-capture needs some extra hacking, but this seems like the most semantically correct option.\n  \nIs it just me, or is org-mode syntax quirky?

Here is what I'd like to do, perhaps someone can tell me the best way to accomplish that.\n I want to be able to create a TODO for each ticket that I am assigned. I want to be able to keep notes on that ticket as well as have a check list of things to do. To include such items as:\n  \ninvestigate bug\n create a pull request\n verify with test team\n  \nAdditionally I'd like to have custom states other than TODO and DONE. Something like TODO, IN PROGRESS, DONE, VERIFYING, and BLOCKED. Finally I would like to be able to assign tags to different tickets so I can track them. So if tickets 1,2,&3 all deal with the UI, then they get tagged with \"UI\". If tickets 4 & 5 are done on the backend with Java, I'd like to tag them as \"JAVA\" and \"BACKEND\". Then I'd like to be able to filter based on my tags.\n What is the best way of doing this in org mode? Should I be making a new document for each ticket?

So for example I'd like to do forward search (whilst in org file find corresponding place in pdf), and reverse search (whilst in pdf find corresponding place in org file).

For both tables, I can calculate values in the last column one at a time by doing M-x org-table-recalculate or C-c *, but iteratively updating the table using M-x org-table-iterate or C-u C-u C-c * only works for the second table. For the first table, if I run org-table-iterate, I get the message \"Table was already stable.\" Is this a bug, or am I not understanding how named columns are supposed to work?\n I am running Org 9.4.6 and Emacs 27.2 on Windows 10\n Update: I posted this question on StackExchange and someone pointed out the following from the Org manual. So it turns out I didn't understand how named columns work 😄\n  \nThe documentation (C-h i g(org)Advanced Features) says: \n Important: Please note that for these special tables, recalculating the table with ‘C-u C-c *’ only affects rows that are marked ‘#’ or ‘*’, and fields that have a formula assigned to the field itself.

Specifically, I want <return> in my normal mode to call markdown-edit-code-block, but only when markdown-mode is active.\n I didn't want to add a binding that checks what the major mode is with cond and whatnot, as it didn't seem like a very clean or modular solution. Instead, I created a second minor mode with the one binding I need for markdown-mode and set it as a buffer-local variable. Now, when my normal mode activates, it checks whether the variable is non-nil, and calls it.\n It works, but since I don't know everything about emacs, I'm wondering if anyone has encountered this problem before and if there's an even simpler solution that I'm missing.\n    submitted by    /u/flora_best_maid  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi,\n I have recently switched to emacs from vim and so far my experience has been pretty good (still trying to get used to elisp). One of the things which I had setup in my vimrc was a compilation command which would compile my code, I had heard that emacs had a command called `compile` and I tried to use that. I had noticed that when I did not have evil mode enabled the `compile` command would behave the way I had wanted and use the windows on the screen, however once I had turned on evil mode the compile command would not use the windows on the screen as I had wanted, I think that the best way to illustrate this would be through some images of it works with evil mode right now and how I want it to work:\n Whenever I have one window open and I run `compile build.bat` the compile command would make a new split and put the compilation buffer in there and this is fine:\n https://preview.redd.it/xqro9chktrt71.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=8e8849d1b3306b59a875758543201aab26c6f9d0\n However, the problem primarily arises when I try to compile my code on the second split, if I open a new file on the window with the compilation buffer open and run `compile build.bat` like before, evil mode will cause emacs to open a new window and run the code there, I want it to behave like it did without evil mode enabled and simpy switch to the other window in a split on the screen and run it there (I have drawn an arrow showing where I want to to open the compilation buffer which emacs did without evil mode enabled):\n ​\n https://preview.redd.it/q3v36gp8urt71.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=aa8544c214cfd3322fba73cfbf9f0d3557456282\n    submitted by    /u/asimpleperson123  \n [link]   [comments]",

Here's an example, maybe you can help figuring out the term?\n  \nVisit a couple of files in a project folder (e.g. root has a .git/)\n Visit a couple channels on IRC via erc for team chat with colleagues\n Open 2 emails from your boss for reference\n  \nI usually navigate around by C-x b and filtering from there; sorted by recency, it makes switching back and forth simple.\n But let's say I have a potato computer and usually only 1 frame with 1 window open at a time or whatever, so the default is I look at 1 buffer. When I'm in IRC, I want to switch to other IRC buffers easily -- look at other channels, direct messages, whatever. Focus on these, don't show any other buffer in the suggestions.\n When I've switched to the project code, let's say I want to focus on other project buffers. (project.el and projectile do this already)\n Same with email: When I'm reading mail, show another mail buffer plz. Don't show me the IRC buffers or code.\n  \nI bet this has a name and tons of implementations, but I cannot figure this out. Like the ibuffer groupings work, maybe, but for buffer switching, ignoring stuff that's not in the current group.\n Any hints what to look for to narrow down the list of all buffers to \"related\" buffers?\n To write this myself, I'd filter (buffer-list) by condition(s), and pick a conditions based on context. E.g. if major mode is ERC, filter buffers by erc-mode:\n (require 'seq) (seq-filter (lambda (buf) (let ((buffer-major-mode (with-current-buffer buf major-mode))) (eq buffer-major-mode #'erc-mode))) (buffer-list)) \n Is that a thing already?\n    submitted by    /u/divinedominion  \n [link]   [comments]",

The trouble is synchronizing sent mail. The solution I've used for several years is to automatically hide a BCC on everything I write, which sends to a sent-mail inbox that each of my PCs gets. Trouble is, not all information is saved in such a case. In particular, any other BCCs I have on the message are lost. This is a problem for the times I need to do \"undisclosed\" recipients lists. The answer seems like FCC field, which I notice NotMuch attempts to add on its own on the occasions I have mistakenly tried to write something through a NotMuch route. Trouble is, the notmuch default is relative to wherever directory location I am when I invoked it. Also, I read in the docs that things are appended to said location as mbox, like my spools, which means I need to think about how I am parsing that FCC thing.\n Before I dig in to a solved problem, how is anyone else making the most of FCC?

          "description": "tl;dr; Do most people set their org-roam-directory to be the same as org-dictionary? And those that do not - why not?\n I have used pure org for my note taking & TODOs so far. However I do think I would benefit from org-roam/zettelkasten for subset of what I need - keeping a personal knowledge base (debugging history, analyzing problems, keeping track of stuff that has a potentially longer-term benefit, more wishy-washy \"plans\").\n What triggered this question was the fact that org-roam does not reuse org directory but has a separate variable for its roam directory. So I wondered if there was a reason to have org files that are not also roam files. One reason that came up was that the number of roam files can grow significantly and org-agenda would get slower and slower. So...\n My current setup idea is this:\n  \nI separate out org files from roam (or rather have roam files in a subdirectory of org directory)\n Use roam for knowledge-base, journal etc\n I generally won't do TODOs etc in roam files, but instead have a TODOs/Schedules in ordinary org (and these files are going to be part of agenda files)\n  \nBasically - use org-roam for idea/note taking that might or might not be related to tasks but don't actually mix tasks into the zettels. Zettels could be referenced/linked to from tasks if needed (i.e. if some information/knowledge could be useful to get the task done)\n I read through https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/hg2m5s/zettelkastenorgroamorgbrain_is_crap/ as an example of discussion of problems/benefits (though I realize that's for roam v1 and quite out of date I expect most problems to be the same currently).\n Does anyone use a similar split? How is it? What would I miss (I can imagine referencing agenda items from zettels might be useful etc). If you think I should just merge the two and use org-roam - how do you deal with agenda? Fixed set of agenda files (subset of roam files)?\n Hope the above makes sense...\n ​\n Edit: Added TL;DR\n    submitted by    /u/podtatranec  \n [link]   [comments]",

However, when I tried it with my flutter project it didn't work although it booted up the dartanalyzer I'm wondering if dart-server still works or is a viable option for dart/flutter dev in emacs.\n Also, what're your thoughts on eglot, does it stay out of my way until I request for features just like dart-server (e.g. C-c ? to give details about symbol under point, or M-/ for auto completions, rather than constant popups in miniframes and the echo area)\n This subreddit has been so helpful in my journey with emacs... thank you all\n EDIT:: sorry for wasting your time, after trying a few times, dart-server seems to work in the flutter project (also some things still aren't working, like flycheck support and intelligent completion with M-/).

Flukey, because I don't much go in for gingerbread, but I'd seen it mentioned a couple times & thought, \"Why not?\"\n Installed it, put some simple config in the init, restarted. Hmm. What did I do wrong? Restarted, it showed up this time. Well, it looked okay, nothing special. I clicked out of it into an org file. It took a minute to register. WTH? Buffer-face-mode was gone! I was in an org file with default Emacs faces. This is messed up. Let me restart again.\n Whoa. I'm getting a Flycheck error now, and faces are still wrong. Well, this doesn't fly. I'll comment out the dashboard stuff. WTH? The buffer's read-only! I toggle read-only, modeline shows file is writable, yeah, no. Let me switch to a different buffer. WTH? C-x b doesn't work! I'm flummoxed. I'm starting to hate on dashboard.\n Close the program. Start from a command line emacs -Q. That still works, anyway. Get to the init file, comment out the dashboard stuff, restart. Yeah, okay, great - I have my key bindings and my faces back. But, dashboard is the gift that keeps on giving. I still have the Flycheck error - \n Wrong type argument: symbolp, (flycheck-mode-set-explicitly)\n Where did that come from? It wasn't here yesterday. And hey, guess what? A recursive grep for flycheck-mode-set-explicitly through all the files in elpa comes up empty.\n $ ls -R */*.el | xargs grep 'flycheck-mode-set-explicitly'\n It doesn't get any better than this.\n Actually, it does. I reluctantly decide to go to the Flycheck page and submit an issue, try to find out where this is coming from. Hahaha! Joke's on me. They don't handle issues from Windows. They dump them into a bucket and if someone comes along & handles them, great. In the meantime...\n In the meantime, I switch to Flymake.\n Afterward, I listened to \"Not Just the Tudors\" podcasts for three hours to regain my equilibrium.

Command names make it very easy to figure out where to go hack. You can't always C-h k when you're dealing with the minibuffer or some weird modal package or using a command dispatcher like ivy or transient.\n Seeing the stream of function names is so helpful to get oriented faster. You might be questioning if the default org map overrides arrows (it does). Running with the log open quickly illuminates how your bindings and modes are all wired.\n Open issues or PR's to add more commands! I was going to add a minibuffer toggle and a way to pause logging (to preserve the mode state while hiding and stopping logging). Out of time tonight but I'll get around to anything nobody beats me to.\n The existing implementation was using global hooks instead of setting up hooks in the mode.

When I tried gccemacs again, It took just as long as the first time again.\n It seems that the .elc files are not fully compatible between the two and so they are recompiled...

I'm planning on using date/time tags as such: <20211012113150> when writing in the appropriate heading, in one document. Would it be possible to search all entries, such that they show up in ascending order? the tag <20211012113150> represents the date and time in the format <YYYYMMDDHHMMSS>, and I'd be putting a tag each time I write in the different headings/subheadings. I'd like to be able to scroll chronologically through the different entries, and as such it would be useful if I can perform this type of search.\n I'm currently using Swiper as my main method of searching, is it possible to perform this type of search in Swiper?\n Also, is there a problem with how I'm planning on keeping my entries separated by topic, and tagging them so that I'd be able to search them chronologically?

The goal is to replicate this, https://html5up.net/dimension, in org mode. The index.html file looks something like this:\n <html> <!-- start main html block --> <head> <!-- start head definition like title, css..--> <head> <!-- start head definition like title, css..--> <body> <!-- start main body --> <body> <!-- end main body --> <html> <!-- end main html block --> \n Within the main body, you have stuff like <div>...</div>, <header>...</header>,<footer>..</footer>...etc. The head definition for css, title, language is easy. In my org mode, I do this:\n #+HTML_HEAD: <title>Tab title for website</title> #+HTML_HEAD: <meta charset=\"utf-8\" /> #+HTML_HEAD: <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no\" /> #+HTML_HEAD: <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"assets/css/main.css\" /> #+HTML_HEAD: <noscript><link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"assets/css/noscript.css\" /></noscript> \n Basically, copy the content between <head>....</head> in the #+HTML_HEAD. The <body>...</body> is automatically create when you type stuff in the ... body of the document. That is fine too. The problem is the nested div, header, footer within body. \n To simplify the problem, the snippet in the body has this form:\n <X id/class = \"Y\"> ...some code here... </X> \n where X can be head if you do <head>...</head>, and Y is the keyword you use in the document for class and id, e.g:\n <div class=\"logo\"> <i class=\"fas fa-fighter-jet\"></i> </div> \n How do I enter the above code in Org mode?

I literally just write the code, press C-c C-c, and get my results. No manually compiling or anything, and the errors automatically popup on a seperate screen for you to fix.\n ​\n On top of that, print statement output are automatically cleanly separated into a table based on commas (but appear normally if you choose :output results).\n ​\n This has been so helpful for my operating systems course, and wow I'm so happy I found emacs.\n ​\n Thanks for coming to my talk (I hope the tags C Programming and Org mode help future searchers)\n    submitted by    /u/Pr0Thr0waway  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Greetings,\n Began to migration to org 9.5 today and with it to try to adapt the new citations system. I have run into two questions that someone may have the answers to.\n  \nTrying to use any processor other than 'basic' results in an error. For testing my configuration is very simple:\n  \n (use-package org :demand t :pin gnu :config (setq org-cite-export-processors '((latex natbib) (t basic)))) \n If I export to latex with this setup, it results in org-cite-store-export-processor: Unknown processor natbib error. Only basic works. The biblatex, natbib, and csl exporters all result in the same error. Is it really going to force me to perform a (require 'oc-xxx) for each of them?\n  \nThe styles seem a bit limited to me. Is there an option to provide a reference in place without a bibliography? One common use case is produce a list of publications in a chosen order (e.g., NSF-style CVs require \"Five relevant publications\"). With latex, this is commonly done with \\nobibliography and \\bibentry. Unfortunately, I don't see support for either in the table provided in the very nice Introduction.\n  \nIs it possible to not insert a bibliography? It would make sense that if citations are used and exported to latex without the #+print_bibliography directive that it automatically inserts \\nobibliography.\n For inserting references rather than citations, is there a style I am missing? It might make sense to have an r style that inserts the full reference in place (if exporting to latex, it would use \\bibentry while basic would simply insert the reference text).\n Anyhow, I appreciate hearing whether I am missing something on these issues.\n    submitted by    /u/atomicham  \n [link]   [comments]",

Any key can be a layer.\n I was thinking that combining this functionality with something like ryo-modal could make for a very satisfying and efficient modal keybind system. However, it doesn't seem like there's any ready made way to do this in Emacs. \n I think that the closest preexisting thing is Hydras, which basically are layers, except you have to define a keybind that exits the Hydra. \n So the question is, how can I make the exit function for a Hydra be the releasing of its prefix key? I'm not sure if this is a simple or complicated elisp task, as I'm still pretty novice when it comes to Emacs hacking.

Checking load-history showed that nearly all the org.*.elc files that were getting loaded were from the built-in version of Org instead of the one cloned by straight. \n Maybe I was just hallucinating that it was ever working: at least if that's the case, it provides a way for my best present theory to be true, which is that the built-in Org is getting loaded as a side-effect of me having a literate configuration. I printed the load-path variable at the beginning of my init.el file (which is basically just (org-babel-load-file \"~/.emacs.d/config.org\")), and the straight version of Org wasn't on the path yet. This has me thinking that when Emacs hits \"org-babel-load-file\" it loads the only version of Org available on the path - i.e. the built-in version.\n If so, what's the fix? Does keeping a literate config force you to do some ugly workarounds with setting the load-path manually prior to running \"org-babel-load-file\" or pinning what version of a package you use through straight, or is there some cleaner option I don't know of? It seems like Emacs should be able to reload a package to a newer version during runtime once the new source becomes available.\n    submitted by    /u/summetria  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have to click on a buffer in the parent frame), and it doesn't play nicely with which-key, etc.\n I've tried some solutions where the buffer switches to the compilation output and the buffer hides itself afterwards, but those are honestly kinda janky. \n So I'm on the verge of going back to a compilation frame--dedicated or not--but then the cues that compilation is still ongoing or has failed or succeeded might be hidden if I'm working on something else. (I used to try modifying the modeline in every active buffer, but that caused weird conflicts with doom modeline and other things that also wanted to play with the display.)\n There's a tradeoff with everything; I'm not looking for a perfect solution, I'm just curious what other people do.\n    submitted by    /u/vjgoh  \n [link]   [comments]",

I love using org files, and displaying them in Emacs is wonderful: I have my config set up to present subtrees indented, hide leading stars, etc.\n However, I would like to improve how my .org files look when accessed by other editors (or when printed out). Without the illusion of indentation that comes from editing .org files in Emacs, the documents are (at least in my opinion) extremely hard to decipher at-a-glance; there is no obvious visual relationship between headings and subheadings.\n Ideally, I would like for the content under subheadings to actually be indented in the text files, so that they would be easy to read/skim in other editors. My searching led to me to this page in the manual, which seems to explain that this can be done if the following settings are used:\n (setq org-adapt-indentation t org-hide-leading-stars t org-odd-levels-only t) \n However, even after adding these settings to my config, the behavior doesn't change: when I save a .org buffer, it is written to disk without hard indentation. Did I misunderstand something about how this works/should work (perhaps I missed something obvious)? Has anyone else had better luck making this happen?\n Many thanks in advance for any help.\n    submitted by    /u/NeatSea7  \n [link]   [comments]",

This is helpful if you do not want to bind the command to a hotkey, but still want to pass the Universal Argument into it.\n I recently encountered a situation with the anki-editor package where I wanted to pass the Universal Argument into the anki-editor-push-notes function. I did not want to create a keyboard shortcut for this command because I will use it less than once a day. First I tried things like M-x anki-editor-push-notes(4) and M-x (anki-editor-push-notes '(4)) but neither of those worked. Then, following this guide, I created a wrapper function that calls (anki-editor-push-notes '(4)). This worked fine. I could call my wrapper function which would in turn call the function I really wanted to run with the Universal Argument passed in; however, I figured out a more succinct way. Pressing C-u M-x anki-editor-push-notes will pass the Universal Argument into the command. In my opinion this is better because I don't have to have that extra function in my init.el and I don't have to remember two slightly distinct commands.\n I figured if I didn't know about this and the author of this guide may not have known about this, then there may be other people on the subreddit who do not know about this.

So I have a function for inserting the sections from parsed 'result-groups' (a group is all the DOM material for one result):\n (defun my/w3m-insert-duckduckgo-section (group) (let ((href (cdar (cdadar group))) (title (caddar group)) (body (cddr (nth 1 group)))) (magit-insert-section (result) (magit-insert-heading (insert (format \"%s\\n\" title))) (insert (format \"%s\\n\" \"this-is-the-body\"))))) \n I'm using the \"this-is-the-body\" string in place of an actual body at the moment, because I haven't got round to learning about parsing DOM text yet.\n I run this in a loop over all the groups, inserting each one. This runs inside a root section I insert first.\n This inserts the relevant text, but with no special properties (e.g. magit sections normally have certain faces) and no newlines. Everything is on one line, just running on to the next result.\n If I run something like this in a scratch buffer, the result is correct:\n (magit-insert-section (root) (magit-insert-section (result) (magit-insert-heading (format \"%s\\n\" \"Header text 1\")) (insert (format \"%s\\n\\n\" \"this-is-the-body\"))) (magit-insert-section (result) (magit-insert-heading (format \"%s\\n\" \"Header text 2\")) (insert (format \"%s\\n\" \"this-is-the-body\")))) \n Running eval-last-sexp after this in the scratch buffer works exactly as expected (standard magit section text properties, newlines are printed correctly). What's most stange is that if I use eval-expression to run the above form in a w3m buffer, it works correctly! Correct faces and properties etc.\n So, why do the newlines and properties not show up in the w3m buffer when I call the forms programatically vs interactively, and how can I fix this?\n TIA!\n    submitted by    /u/Jack-o-tall-tales  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'd like a way to automate that if possible. I usually adjust the font size a bit to get everything to fit on a multiple of 4 pages for printing.\n On the HTML end, I'd like a simple way for each recipe heading to link back to the table of contents, to make the page easier to navigate. It would also be nice if I could get the title of the page to export as a h3 instead of h1, to match the sidebar.\n I have the org mode source here if anyone wants to take a look: https://www.gnuisnotunix.com/recipes/recipes.org\n    submitted by    /u/gordonforeskin  \n [link]   [comments]",

I like that it is offline and I can problem solve with it, since I spend so much time online, and recently I've been looking for ways to make my bullet journal more searchable and useful.  So I came across the Commonplace index, and Zettelkasten, both of which look promising.  I've made some few steps on implementing both in my bullet journal.  I'll have new things to learn quickly in my new job so any advice on first steps, software engineering, working on paper, or anything related etc would be greatly appreciated!\nThanks\nNeal",

          "description": "During my recent studies into effective learning methods, the phenomena that food plays a major role in cognitive performance has surfaced. Some research observed differences in cognitive performance between 15-20% based on nutrition intake (high cal/protein/fat vs low). From my own experience, if I'm hungry I get distracted more often and find it harder to enter the flow state of work.\nIn How Not to Die, the author points to research that observed consumption of burgers/meat lead to a very noticeable decline in cognitive performance minutes after consumption.\nIn his essay writing guide, Jordan Peterson recommends eating something high in fat and protein first thing in the morning before writing. He also talks about the importance of waking up early & working in the morning. Peterson also said in another interview that he solved a clients anxiety problems by making her eat more. This suggests a link between not getting proper nutrition and anxiety.\nThe Netflix documentary \"The Game Changers\", Connor McGregor puts part of the blame of his loss on eating too much steak - not having energy during the fight. This documentary argues vegetable-based diets are just as effective for building muscle as meat ones, as well as being more healthy for anyone interested.\nI haven't done much research into this question obviously \nMy question(s) to you is: have you experimented with different foods and consumption schedules to boost your cognitive performance during knowledge work sessions? Do you know any interesting resources to continue this line of research?",

          "description": "Hello, fellow Zettlers!\nBeing fresh to both Zettelkasten method and this forum, I have to first and foremost ask for your forgiveness if this was already discussed or perhaps it is stupidly obvious, but I struggled to find any threads relating to the following conundrum: how to deal with fields of knowledge or areas of practice, which are subject to significant changes in relatively short time frames?\nExample: I am a lawyer based in an EU member state, practicing in a global industry dealing with several fields of law (e.g. intellectual property or privacy law) which are subject to quite dynamic changes (due to legislative actions on EU and state level, ever growing case law, technological changes, etc.). Of course, some concepts fundamental to jurisprudence or terminology specific to a given field may stay relevant for some time. However, due to this high variability, when taking notes regarding more practical and recent issues I face the problem of dealing with \"volatile\" notes, which feel like they may unexpectedly, suddenly, in any moment become irrelevant, useless or even harmful (e.g. by severing an existing train of thought with a statement which is not true any more).\nMaybe this is my lack of understanding, but I feel there is a meaningful difference between evolution of sciences (regardless of its pace), where old models or theories give way to new ones, which explain given real phenomena better, or where new evidence provide a fresh look on the reality; \nlegal \"reality\" may change in an instant, rendering prior statements describing this \"reality\" not so much obsolete or outdated as simply not true any more (or true exclusively within a bound time frame).\nAre there any good practices or strategies helping to deal with such volatility of notes and tending the Zettelkasten without getting crazy?",

The interesting detail is that the author accomplished full text justification without tweaking the spacing between words. That's how you usually accomplish that effect in e.g. MS Word or other desktop publishing applications. The space between words is stretched.\n\nBut here, there's only ever 1 space between words.\nSo the author had to write everything to fit. Conversely, that means words and sentence structures had to be picked because of their length to properly fill the available space.\nMatt Gemmell points out that this is not a feat one is likely to accomplish for the lulz. It's serious effort. And that document sure as heck is long! Now that's some plain text dedication",

But I have never understood what it means to write notes in your own words. Most of the time I just copy a passage with minor changes or I translate an English passage as if I copied it.\nI thought about different strategies. I could first read a paragraph, then close the book, then rewrite some ideas from memory without looking at the text. Or I could simply read the text and not bother with the information within and just write my thoughts that could come into my mind. Or I could write the note as if I explained it to my mom.\nNote that I write my zettel notes in Romanian so when I read a text in English I translate it in Romanian. Not that it helps.\nAm I missing something? Can you tell me how can I write a zettel note without copying from the text or write it in my own words?",

Also, I write in a notebook first, then transcribe the writing into my computer to avoid editing while writing.\nHowever, when there are gaps, I'm not too keen on the idea of referring to resources until I can fill in the gaps. It means that I have to switch from writing to reading. Reading is low effort to me while writing is demanding. I'm most energetic in the morning. Thus, I'd rather use my mornings to write than to read if I have anything to write about.\nBut, if I split the tasks, I need to do something about what I've written so I can address the gaps and re-use the text.

I feel like I'll learn the principles better if I can immediately start implementing the practices, and that means I need to choose what software I'm going to use (definitely not a card-and-box system - my handwriting isn't up to the task).\nMy existing workflow involves 1) highlighting and commenting on scholarly papers and ebooks in Mendeley; 2) highlighting and scribbling in the margin of hard copy books; 3) saving popular press articles to Evernote from Chrome. Then I write in Word. As you can see, something to process and organize notes and move them smoothly to the writing process is greatly needed.\nSince I already have several programs in this process, my top consideration for Zettelkasten software is that it be intuitive and work out-of-the-box without me having to hack any fixes.\nI have seen that some people use Evernote for Zettelkasten and I wonder if that's the way to go, to avoid proliferating software. It would be nice if I could click from my note on an article to easily see the article itself. However, looking at the earlier thread on Evernote, it seemed to get a bit technical with people figuring out plug-ins and fixes - I wonder if there's software I will find more simple and intuitive for Zettlekasten.\nThanks very much in advance for your help!",

If I had a note that wanted to insert between 2 and 2a in that sequence, because I thought it was very closely related to 2, how would I label it (or perhaps it doesn't really matter and I'm overthinking it and should just stick it in as 2c )?\nThanks!",

          "description": "On the zettelkasten subreddit I came across a post linking to an article on the method (shared by the author of the article). In it he was making some bold proclamations, so I thought I'd ask what this community thought?\nThe core argument seems to be\n\n  \nToday, however, I shall provide one fundamental component of Luhmann's system. This fundamental component is missing from an estimated 96% of digital zettelkastens.\nLuhmann outlines this fundamental component in the very beginning of his paper on how his zettelkasten works.\n\n    \nInformation is an intra-systematic event. It results when one compares one message or entry with regard to other possibilities. Information, accordingly, originates only in systems which possess a comparative schema—even if this amounts only to: \"this or something else.\"\n\n  \n  \nYou see, built into every single note in Luhmann's system is one requirement: he must decide where the note belongs. It forces associations, and associations stand as the fundamental building block of human memory. One must decide if the note is associated with this or something else. It is a comparative schema built into the very root of Luhmann's antinet zettelkasten, which surfaces the magic of his system.\nUnfortunately, this fundamental component is watered down to near extinction in the world of digital zettelkastens.\n\n\n(Source: https://daily.scottscheper.com/num/243/)\nThe idea of \"must decide where the note belongs\", while true, misses the point of multiple context within the zettelkasten, as Luhmann was trying to come up with an alternative to filing notes using folders. Or is he just rehashing the classic Folgzettel Debate?\nEdited by @ctietze: Added source link for attribution",

          "description": "Hello everyone,\nI usually take a ton of notes from narrative non-fiction books I read: story ideas, research etc... Those should be considered \"literature notes\" in the context of zettelkasten. I find it confusing having these notes in a single file, so I split them by topic or anecdote. But I don't like to have my computer crammed with tons of files. When I read a new book on the same topic, rather than creating new notes and linking them, I tend to group the notes I already have with new notes who adds info to the same topic or details to the same anecdote. Still, I keep a reference to the original source (in the form of citation).\nTo better explain what I do:\nI read a book about a writer and I take a note on an episode of his life (which we'll call NOTE 1).\nAnother episode of his life goes to a different note (NOTE 2) in the same folder.\nI read another book and I find some detail on the same episode as NOTE 1. I don't create a new note but I add it to NOTE 1 and eventually add a citation for the new source.\nI read a book about a chemist and I take a note about one of his discoveries in the specific folder of that book/project. It isn't directly related to the episode of NOTE 1, but I think linking them can bring to a new perspective. I create NOTE 3 and link NOTE 1 and NOTE 3.\nIs that a good practice, or is it better to have a single file for the notes coming from a book, then different super short notes for concepts I want to keep from each book?",
