I'm not sure what exactly yet, and am happy to adjust to the library if worthwhile.\n Think of it as similar to a dashboard. No human input (mouse, keyboard...) present.\n The graphics library does not have to be super tailored for exactly that use case, if I have to come up with the \"widgets\" myself that's okay. But then it should have a reasonable set of drawing primitives, e.g. for boxes and rendering text.\n Direct output to framebuffer preferred, but if it only works under X it's not a dealbreaker.

But in this case I definitely know, they should not exist. Is there any way to tell compiler \"for this class this is a single instance and you can add MonadState' s (ExceptT s m) => MonadState' s m to your inferred rules list\"? As far as I see, there shouldn't be any problems with that for typechecking, so I hope this has already been realized. Or there are some problems that I can't forsee?\n Motivation: I try to make it possible to change, for example, type of error of transformer without decomposing whole monad. So, roughly speaking, I would like to have the function haskell mapError :: (MonadError e m, MonadError e' m', ???) => (e -> e') -> m -> m'  this can be done using type families (like MappedErrorMonad e e' m m') for errors only. But we have a problem when there is some state both at the left and right sides. So we want to tell compiler something like MappedErrorMonad e e' m m' => (MonadState s m => MonadState s m'). For this purpose I've introduced haskell class (forall m a. (Monad m, c' (t a m)) => c' (t b m)) => MappableSave (t :: * -> (* -> *) -> * -> *) (c' :: (* -> *) -> Constraint)  And now want to inhabit this class by ExceptT:  instance MappableSave ExceptT (MonadState s)  But compiler failed with error  • Could not deduce (S.MonadState s m) arising from the superclasses of an instance declaration from the context: (Monad m, S.MonadState s (ExceptT a m)) bound by a quantified context  that's where my topic started\n    submitted by    /u/Lev_135  \n [link]   [comments]",

I've begun reaching out to companies that are already postured to work with Skillbridge interns, but I'm most excited about working in Haskell. \n Do you have any suggestions about where I can find companies that would like to have a ~junior Haskell programmer and can support good quality mentorship? That company would have to register with the program but it's genuinely not difficult, just a bit slow.\n Edit: I would be available to start in May 2023; when a company signs up for the program, it can take 90-120 days to be approved, thus the lead time.

See this thread for details: https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/21693 \n You can use its Strict :: LiftedType -> UnliftedType and Lazy :: LiftedType -> UnliftedType newtypes (!) to turn any lifted type into an unlifted (boxed) type like Array# and vice versa.\n Example:\n let f :: (a :: UnliftedType) -> Int f _ = 42 in f (Strict (error \"boom\" :: Int)) \n This will error out with \"boom\". While the following\n let f :: a -> Int f _ = 42 in f (Lazy (error \"boom\" :: Array# Int)) \n will not error and return 42 instead. (Do note though that unlifted primitives like Array# currently don't have enter code and any eval of Lazy will crash, https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/21792).\n I added a Coercible-like type, LevitySubsumption that allows to coerce some functions along the subkinding relationship Unlifted <: Lifted lifted over BoxedRep, TYPE and then (->). The only axioms are Strict a <: a and a <: Lazy a. With that in place, I can do call-by-value on any existing lazy function:\n even :: Int -> Bool strictEven :: Strict Int -> Bool strictEven = levCoerce @(Int -> Bool) @(Strict Int -> Bool) even even 42 strictEven (Strict 42) \n See also https://hackage.haskell.org/package/data-elevator-0.1.0.0/docs/Data-Elevator.html#v:levCoerce. It's pretty interesting; constructing a coercion like that is very much what I would like GHC to do by itself one day, without any visible trace of levCoerce if possible (inferrable).\n Do note that this code uncovered a few bugs in GHC, so give it a few GHC releases before you actually use this library in production.\n    submitted by    /u/sgraf812  \n [link]   [comments]",

The convenience of using (+) syntax is high enough that I am perfectly happy to have multiplication throw a runtime error when no Monoid instance is available.

Then I could have instance (Ord b, Num a, Eq a) => Add (FreeModule b a) ... and instance (Ord b, Monoid b, Num a, Eq a) => Mul (FreeModule b a) ..., but I don't want to go the route of defining my own numeric hierarchy.\n    submitted by    /u/davidwsd  \n [link]   [comments]",

I am trying to create a function which will give me the subset of combinations which have cardinality (x:xs) - 1. For example, for a list [4,5,6] would give [[4,5],[4,6],[5,6]]\n To find all combinations, I have the \n AllCombinations :: (Eq a) => [a] -> [[a]] AllCombinations [] = [[]] AllCombinations (x:xs) = AllCombinations xs ++ map (x:)(AllCombinations xs) \n which will output all subsets. My issue is filtering. Basically, if I apply a filter of Length x == length xs I seem to be filtering out items I dont want. \n AllCombinations :: (Eq a) => [a] -> [[a]] AllCombinations [] = [[]] AllCombinations (x:xs) = filter(\\x -> length x == length xs )( AllCombinations xs ++ map (x:)(AllCombinations xs) ) -- NB length X == length xs is due to the tail being the same length as the entire list - 1 -- \n Which in prelude we will get\n ​\n Line > AllCombinations [4,5,6] [[4,5]] \n Instead of [4,5],[5,6],[4,6].

But... why? We don't do this for any other monad, and modern Haskellers are perfectly comfortable writing `AppE <$> x <*> y` rather than `appE x y`. And it's quite expensive - you have a huge module that duplicates every single function in this form, and it leads to downstream confusion as people use the two styles inconsistently.\n I think the reason for this existing may just be historical: this style was introduced in the TH paper in 2002, and applicatives weren't popularised until 2008.

And we receive back \"the best\" object (possible options are embodied).\n The topic is being actively researched. And papers are not simple sometimes to start from scratch. I tried to make an introduction that will help to do the first steps.\n For instance, it was not so easy to understand (and implement, for sure) product to combine selections: ```scala def product[R, A]: List[J[R, A]] => J[R, List[A]] =\n (functions: List[J[R, A]]) =>\n (listEval: List[A] => R) =>\n functions match {\n case evalFun :: restEvalFunctions =>\n val a: A =\n evalFun((candidate: A) =>\n listEval(\n candidate ::\n product\n .apply(restEvalFunctions)\n .apply(\n restCandidates =>\n listEval(candidate :: restCandidates)\n )\n )\n ) \n  val as: List[A] = product(restEvalFunctions)(rest => listEval(a :: rest)) a :: as case Nil => Nil } \n ```\n And the product is really useful.

At least for a while, I’d like something where I get to focus more on writing good, tested, maintainable, reusable code (things that are valued but not prioritized in DS). I feel that focusing on those things would make me a better professional even if I decide to come back to a DS/ML job later.\n And it would be great to be able to use more Scala and FP (something that I get to do only rarely in my area, since Python is lingua franca).\n I guess that Data Engineer would be the most feasible role to switch into, since there is some intersection/synergy with the job experience I already have… although maybe not that much...\n So my question is, based on your experience actually working as engineers… do you think this is feasible? Are there some areas that I should focus on strengthening before being able to attempt this? Would I have to start at a junior role, or is my experience in DS/ML pertinent enough for me to aspire to a higher seniority?\n I know that this is pretty unorthodox, but hell, if it makes me enjoy my day to day work even more, then I think it’s worth considering.

I have been \"stuck\" on the same project for 3 years now, which is getting pretty boring.\n Lately I've started considering switching to something more popular like Scala, as there's a much larger variety of projects and clients, but a call with a recruiter today confused me.\n I'm based in Europe and have a permanent contract at 450EUR day rate. The recruiter told me that transitioning to Scala would require a massive pay cut as no one would hire someone without production experience at that rate. He also said that usually Scala people's attitude towards Haskell developers is hostile.\n Does that statement have any merit?

While Scala itself is an advanced language that takes time to learn, adding functional programming on top of that is unbearable for like 99% of newcomers. Doesn't seem like the Scala community embraces the standard Scala anymore, which makes this language for the \"elite\" only. Back in the day, Akka was sold a silver bullet to all problems and the overhead of complexity wasn't worth it for most. It seems like those pure functional libraries have the same problem, they have an even bigger overhead of complexity. It would be nice to have an ecosystem of standard Scala libraries that don't try to enforce a different style of programming and they will be the standard goto for newcomers. Otherwise, it seems like Scala will continue to decline in popularity since newcomers are not able to absorb the complexity of purely functional programming.\n    submitted by    /u/grpvw  \n [link]   [comments]",

So far so good, but the Syntax for function declarations our prof showed us differs from the book and most other sources I´ve found.\n For instance our function declarations are\n def functionName: type => type = inputName => outputName //for example absolute value function def abs: Int => Int = x => x match{ case x if x < 0 => -x case x => x } \n While in the book\n // V brackets are used def sum(xs: List[Int]): Int = xs match case Nil => 0 case head :: tail => head + sum(tail) \n Are these just alternate ways to express the same thing? Is my prof using some other version of Scala?\n Any pointers where I could find more information?\n Thanks in advance.\n Edit: I'm on version 2.13.8-20220325-005602-unknown (OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM, Java 11.0.16) according to the REPL\n    submitted by    /u/MrEppart  \n [link]   [comments]",

My current plan is to have such structure:\n  \napp/ => http api \n bind everything together\n expose json rpc\n \n modules/foundation \n expose persisting capabilities\n expose logging capabilities\n \n modules/coupon \n can have depedency on other api\n can't have dependency on other non api modules\n implements interface in respective api\n can do persistence\n in general persist domain object defined in api\n unit tests\n integration tests\n can have dependency on foundation\n \n modules/coupon-api \n no dependecies in general(can have depencies on other api or utility)\n expose interface\n expose domain object\n \n modules/foo\n modules/foo-api\n modules/bar\n modules/bar-api\n  \nThe goal is to have strict boundaries between modules, exclude circular dependencies, define clear dependencies.\n How good is such structure from the local dev experience endpoint?

          "description": "Has anyone built this? How tough would it be? Does anyone have ideas on where to start?\n To expand, I've noticed a recurring problem in big projects: someone makes a small, trivial change and then has to wait 30-45 minutes for all tests to run. This wastes time and compute. Over time, developers adjust the size of PRs to account for this. Instead of making small isolated changes, they batch a bunch of changes into a single PR so the tests all run together. At some point they break the repo up. Now they have to think about dependency chains, and they've copied a bunch of build boilerplate into many repos.\n I think a powerful solution would be to only re-run tests for code that changed. We can periodically re-run all tests on main/master, maybe once daily. We can add some configuration/annotation to specify that a particular test or test suite should always run.\n How would it work? At the very least, it would have to integrate with SCM to compare what's on main/master vs. on the current commit. But it seems naive to just compare which source files show up in the diff. Seems like it might have to do something at the bytecode level? Maybe some sort of instrumentation similar to what code coverage tools are doing. I haven't done much at that level.\n In any case, thanks for reading. I'm pretty keen to try to build something along these lines. Excited to read any ideas/links/tips you all might have.\n ​\n Update:\n  \nThanks for the fun discussion! It sounds like some combination of testQuick and SBT's remote cache are worth a try. If I'll try to experiment with this and either post back here or write up a blog post.\n  \n   submitted by    /u/elastiknn  \n [link]   [comments]",

Startup options act very early in the initialization process and there is no hook to change them AFAICS. Furthermore, I would like to avoid changing the indentation/folding/highlighting state once it has already been wrongly initialized. And I don't want to set all relevant options on a per-file basis. Ideally I would like to programatically match files based on their paths or even some new startup option or keyword, like say \"#+outline\".

It both says that numeric priorities must be smaller than 65 and has an example where it specifies '#+PRIORITIES 1 10 5'. Unfortunately, this example will cycle in a range of 1-1 for me.

With other words, I would like to be able to type code that will go into functions one piece at a time, scattered in prose. Does anyone know if this is possible with org mode and how?\n If anyone is familiar with Knuth's literal programming system, one can add named statements to code blocks with \"+=\" syntax. As an illustration, here is a piece of code from Pharr & Humphrey Physically Based Rendering which is written in literal programming style (the one where I have seen this system in use, but there are probably others):\n <Function Definitions> ≡ void InitGlobals() { <Initialize Global Variables 2> } \n Fragment \"initialize global variables\":\n <Initialize Global Variables> ≡ shoe_size = 13; \n Add to the fragment:\n <Initialize Global Variables> +≡ dielectric = true; \n Results with:\n void InitGlobals() { shoe_size = 13; dielectric = true; } \n Edit: Ok, thank you all for pointing me to noweb. Didn't used it before and didn't know what it was, but it seems like exactly what I am asking for :).\n    submitted by    /u/arthurno1  \n [link]   [comments]",

But how to do it with org-ql ? Is there a possibility to \"translate\" this function into an org-ql query ?I'm also thinking of creating a new predicate, \"brother-up\", which would return true if the heading has a heading of the same level before it\n So maybe I could find the next action by taking the following headings:\n  \nno task in done\n no descendant\n no \"brother up\" not done\n  \nI'm a bit lost, because I don't even know if it would work, and if I have thought about everything.

          "description": "​\n I tried emacs out in the late 90s, and gave up because I couldn't remap `C-x` to `'next-line` (I still use WordStar keybindings, mock away). I thought I'd try again. It's been 25 years. Surely you can re-map `C-x` by now? It even has evil-mode, so it might work.\n It doesn't work. At least I can't get it to work.\n It works fine if I open a file and do normal stuff. As soon as I try to use `counsel-describe-function` or really almost anything in the mini-buffer at all... blamo. `C-x` is mapped to something else, and I get `Key Sequence C-x X starts with non-prefix key C-x` \n So, is there a way to fix this? Or should I just try again in 25 years?\n    submitted by    /u/LastCenturyMan  \n [link]   [comments]",

But I was debugging a problem with my init file which hadn't loaded completely, had the problem halfway solved but then accidentally suspended the Emacs GUI. Now I have to restart Emacs and redo that work for no good reason.\n Being able to suspend Emacs from a terminal makes sense, but why does this feature exist at all when running it in a GUI? If anything, it seems like some kind of practical joke.\n There doesn't seem to be any way to recover the previous state of the program.

Then it is easy to create the website from one org document by running org-babel-tangle. Right now I'm using a bash code block to create results:\n #+name: php-files #+BEGIN_SRC bash :results output cd $HOME/Downloads/; for f in *; do echo \"#+begin_src html :tangle '/sudo::/srv/http/$f'\" paste /dev/null - < \"$f\" #pukes out php content of file echo \"#+end_src\" echo \"\" done #+end_src #+RESULTS: php-files #+begin_example ,#+begin_src html :tangle '/sudo::/srv/http/01.php' <?php // code of 01.php ?> ,#+end_src ,#+begin_src html :tangle '/sudo::/srv/http/02.php' <?php // code of 01.php } ?> #+end_example \n This output is almost what I want. Except the comma prefixes (default behavior of code blocks ) and single quote instead of double quote. (the double quotes can be generated by the bash script. I will figure this out later).\n At the moment I am using a keyboard macro to remove the , and overwrite ' with \". This can also be done by evil mode.

Emacs is the biggest threat to hypocrisy here, since it can itself be considered a huge monolith that does everything. Aside from that, however, there are other remarkable monoliths (giant pieces of software with huge code-bases and broad functionality) in the emacs ecosystem, some of which are so big and established and useful that they are hard to replace. What are some of your favorites, and what do they do that is hard to replace for you?\n Here are some of mine:\n  \nOrg-mode. It's breadth is actually part of its value-proposition with literate programming in many languages, publication to a plethora of outputs, and rich note-taking (code notebook-style) to an extent unreached by any other tool of which I'm aware. Plus it's really good for actually taking tech/class notes.\n Gnus. Letting me easily* do email across many addresses in emacs, and integrating well with the related monolith...\n BBDB. It has great support for all manner of contacts and, apparently, all sorts of exports, with prevalent and rich interfaces.\n Helm.

I believe this is caused by the fact that I'm loading the built-in org version in init.el, and then trying to load/use an updated version in config.org (which causes some void variable errors for me).\n Alternative strategies are to put something like (load-file \"config.el\") in init.el, and tangle config.org manually or on save.\n Just curious how you all are using your literate org config file, and whether there is anyone who was able to solve/avoid the issue with org that I'm having (I could stick to the built-in version, but I would like to be able to use the latest version).\n    submitted by    /u/fast-90  \n [link]   [comments]",

I know, there are a lot, but I think those are important because that kind of posts drove my decisions in the past.\n I move constantly between editors (Vim => Emacs => Neovim => Emacs => Neovim => Vscode (1 day) => Neovim => ...). The only thing that is nonnegotiable is modal editing.\n Last time I switched from Emacs because of the **huge** amount of time it takes to open (no, I do not like emacsclient). IIRC, it was taking 8s to start in my machine. Hence, I migrate to Neovim and Lua.\n Neovim is a fantastic project! Lua will bring it to a new level! However, I started to miss a GUI and some polished tools I had in Emacs. All GUIs in Neovim are almost a terminal in a graphical application. It really does not add something new. Furthermore, since Lua integration is relatively new, I often find some rough edges. 99% can be fixed relatively easily. However, I just do not have time anymore to tweak my configuration as I had back in the day.\n So, I heard about gccemacs and tried again. WOW! That's a game changer!\n After 20 min compiling everything shipped with Doom emacs by default (yes, this is the bad side of the tradeoff), Emacs starts in less than 2s. It is even faster than my Neovim with all plugins. So, if anyone quit Emacs because of performance, give it one more try. Just do not mind the initial compilation time...\n Finally, I just want to thanks the amazing job of u/hlissner, Doom Emacs is amazing and you can use it out-of-the-box. Exactly what I need now.\n    submitted by    /u/Ronis_BR  \n [link]   [comments]",

My right hand is particularly bad. I have an appointment with my doctor to have a chat about it, but I am pretty sure that contorting my thumbs/hands in general to hit the meta/ctrl/shift keys have not helped me.\n I have enjoyed some modal editing in my journey. My current favorite packages for that are Meow & god-mode. I honestly have not decided which I like better but both \"de-chord\" my commands. Meow does this with a \"keypad\" mode that is for all intents and purposes a leader key. This adds 1 additional key press in exchange for no modifiers. Meow has better text navigation, overall god-mode reduces key-presses much more dramatically.\n I am also considering learning/training myself to use both hands at all times and avoid pressing 2 keys with one hand at any given time. This only gets dicey with 3 key chords (like C-M-/M-S-/C-S/-).\n I'm trying to get a sense of which is the best course of action here. Heck, maybe I should do both?\n EDIT: You all have been amazing.

          "description": "Hello. I would like to ask whether it is possible to speed up the first GTK3 frame creation (not `init.el` loading)\n Background: Emacs 28.1 with GTK3 on ArchLinux (Awesome WM) and Ubuntu 20.04 (Gnome 3.36), both with Xorg. The config is on GitHub. On both machines the startup time for a non daemon Emacs UI instance is roughly the same and fluctuates between 0.46-0.55 seconds (depending on machine load perhaps, not sure), measured by `emacs-init-time`. The same measurement when opening a frame created from daemon (by `systemd`, but it shouldn't matter) or in terminal is 0.104 sec. When using `emacs -Q` it is 0.319 sec.\n So, although the startup times are fine, I anyway would like to find a way to lessen the time it takes to draw a GTK3 frame which is roughly 0.3 sec. as far as I understand (this is by simply calculating the difference between non-daemon UI init time and a daemon one). \n Why? Because I want it faster and because the frame flickers when it is drawn :)\n So, basically this is not about the speed of `init` loading, but UI drawing (although I will gladly accept suggestions to speed up the init as well [the config is in the works, I choose not to use `use-package`, but instead to employ manual tweaks]).\n Is it even possible to lessen this time? By the measurement of `-Q` it seems not...\n Thank you in advance\n    submitted by    /u/igorepst  \n [link]   [comments]",

A minimal example:\n #+title: My website #+OPTIONS: toc:nil html-style:nil num:nil html-scripts:nil html-preamble:nil html-postamble:nil #+begin_export html {% extends 'base.html' %} {% load static %} {% block content %} #+end_export * Welcome to my website Welcome to my small website. * Contact us Some info on how to contact us. #+begin_export html {% endblock %} #+end_export \n I know Org treats hierarchies strictly, so that is why perhaps the last html_export is added to the Contact Us section. Any ideas how to avoid that and keep this tag as the last output in the html? Thanks in advance!\n Edit : Solved, check comments!\n    submitted by    /u/ndpian  \n [link]   [comments]",

My projects should contain the source code of the program, and anything required for it to function, or directly related with it, nothing else.\n Emacs doesn't seem to think the same.

Despite setting the variable create-lockfiles to nil, it still creates them.\n Ideally, I'd want these lock files to exist, just somewhere else. They shouldn't be where I'm editing. I don't really know how to control, this. There was a variable to change that but I always failed at setting it, complaining I was using the wrong type.\n Anyway, this code is what I have at the very top of my init file, this is all I need to keep my working directory (and my config folder) clean from Emacs' shenanigans.\n (setq user-emacs-directory (expand-file-name \"~/.local/share/emacs\")) (setq user-config-directory (expand-file-name \"~/.config/emacs\")) (setq native-comp-eln-load-path '((. \"~/.local/share/emacs/eln-cache\"))) (setq custom-file (expand-file-name \"custom.el\" user-emacs-directory)) (setq package-user-dir (expand-file-name \"elpa\" user-emacs-directory)) (setq url-history-file (expand-file-name \"url/history\" user-emacs-directory)) (setq delete-old-versions t) (setq create-lockfiles nil) (setq auto-save-list-file-prefix (expand-file-name \"auto-save-list/.saves-\" user-emacs-directory)) (setq backup-directory-alist '((\".\" . \"~/.local/share/emacs/backups\"))) \n Does anybody know why Emacs STILL creates lock files where I'm editing?

Value: ((\"C-c C-c\" . term-interrupt-subjob) (\"C-c C-e\" . term-send-esc) (\"C-p\" . previous-line) (\"C-n\" . next-line) (\"C-s\" . isearch-forward) (\"C-r\" . isearch-backward) (\"C-m\" . term-send-return) (\"C-y\" . term-paste) (\"M-f\" . term-send-forward-word) (\"M-b\" . term-send-backward-word) (\"M-o\" . term-send-backspace) (\"M-p\" . term-send-up) (\"M-n\" . term-send-down) (\"M-M\" . term-send-forward-kill-word) (\"M-N\" . term-send-backward-kill-word) (\"<C-backspace>\" . term-send-backward-kill-word) (\"M-r\" . term-send-reverse-search-history) (\"M-d\" . term-send-delete-word) (\"M-,\" . term-send-raw) (\"M-.\" . comint-dynamic-complete)) \n So by default C-p is bound to previous-line. So when I type C-p in terminal (which is in char mode), the cursor should move one line up? But nothing happens when I type C-p in the terminal.\n What good is the entry for (\"C-p\" . previous-line) in term-bind-key-alist then if C-p does nothing? Anyone savvy can help me to understand what the use of this entry is?\n    submitted by    /u/brightlystar  \n [link]   [comments]",

I highly recommend it.\n Note: we do have a known performance issue apparent with large files that change frequently. The fix for this will mostly happen in parsebib.\n Also, I've updated the Doom biblio module to incorporate these changes, and updated all of its packages. This remains the easiest path to have a working citar-oriented system; just turn on the biblio and vertico modules, and set some paths.\n The note API in 1.0 in turn enables a small integration extension: citar-org-roam. This is partly a demo and test of the new API, but should also be useful for users, and developers that might want to build on it. This still needs a bit of work before I submit it to MELPA; PRs welcome.\n Any questions?\n    submitted by    /u/bdarcus  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "For those who don't know, tree-sitter is \"an incremental parsing system\". What it basically means is that it provides fancy syntax highlighting by doing a thorough analysis of the code.\n Emacs has treesitter integration via the tree-sitter package. I was using tree-sitter before on neovim and it really great. Well, I'm trying to set it up in emacs and it's pure frustration.\n I've installed the package, and it says that you should also install a language pack. Well, since I was already using treesitter before, then I prefer to not have to compile the language parsers twice, so I decided to unify it in a single directory for both neovim and emacs. Making the change on neovim was a piece of cake. On emacs, I pushed to the tree-sitter-load-path list, and it seems to work... kinda. If I manually call tree-sitter-require 'python for example, it does load the language parser, it even gets listed in tree-sitter-languages. However, it doesn't get enabled, the syntax is the same.\n The variable tree-sitter-language is not getting set. Apparently tree-sitter should map each language major mode to a tree-sitter parser, but it ain't doing it for some reason. Trying to enable treesitter on a python file results in the error \"No language registered for \"python-mode\"\".\n Also what about these major modes for each language? I don't want a major mode for each language. I want emacs to open a file, recognize what it is by its extension or otherwise, and that's it. I want highlighting to be handled by treesitter, but it apparently needs to interact with these major modes (of which I need to install more if I want to support other languages) that don't really add anything to me other than bloat. Is there a workaround?\n    submitted by    /u/SnooPets20  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello, Ive been using ivy for a while now, and its been blooming smooth sailing. One thing i havent figured out though is how to prioritize specific completions; my search-fu is failing me here. What i want is to be able to provide a list of interactive functions (I only need this for executing extended commands) that, should they be in the list of completions, should be placed first in the completion list. For example, currently if i type in sly connect, the function sly-connect isnt first, that honor goes to sly-list-connections. As there ⠀isnt any way to narrow down completion to just sly-connect without replacing the space with a hyphen, i have to add it to the list of functions i have to type literally. So, is there any way to prioritize certain completions? Or, do you have other recommendations for how to solve this issue without needing to remember specific functions?

          "description": "Hi all, I've been a long time user of Ivy and Counsel but a couple of days ago I decided to give Vertico, Embark and Consult a try. I'm very joyful with them so far, however I'm having a couple of issues: - 1. I've read that using Embark to collect a list of grep results should result in a grep-mode buffer. I used to use Ivy to produce an occur buffer which I could then edit allowing me to make changes across multiple files easily. Getting a grep-mode buffer sounded good to me as I could then use wgrep to edit these‏‏‎‏‏‎‏‏‎‏‏‎­matches directly in a similar way. However, when I collect these results (via embark-collect-live, embark-collect-snapshot or embark-export) I always end up with an embark-collect-mode buffer. I cannot see a way from here to make this a grep-mode buffer or to make changes to these matches in the same way I would in an editable occur buffer. 2. In the collected results as mentioned in the first question, if I press RET on any of these results I get the following error: Error running timer ‘consult--async-after-change’: (buffer-read-only #<buffer *Embark Collect*>). I'm currently using Emacs 28.0.50 and I use Evil mode. Any help on the above would be greatly appreciated!\n    submitted by    /u/The9thHuman  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I like the idea of only horizontally scrolling the current line, ie. (setq auto-hscroll-mode 'current-line), but it has a few quirks.\n First, if you scroll to the end of a long line, and then move to the next line, it will horizontally scroll that line, even if it easily fits on the screen. This pushes most of the short line off the left edge of the screen.\n Second, It would be nice for point to stay as far right as possible (at the left edge of the right margin) when horizontally scrolling. This would make it so point would stay a few columns from the right edge the entire time the line is horizontally scrolled. So even when moving point left, the line under point would horizontally scroll to the right until the line is no longer horizontally scrolling, then point would actually start moving toward the left edge of the screen.\n Does anyone know of such a thing? or can anyone help point me in the right direction to create a minor mode that would do this?\n    submitted by    /u/pa2ees  \n [link]   [comments]",

To re-iterate its objectives:\n  \nProvides a solid, ootb workflow for task and project management.\n Pre-configured for Julia and python programming - supports both REPL and notebook based workflows.\n Ideal for users looking to 'try emacs'. It can be used as-is by setting only a handful of (including zero) parameters.\n May interest 'experienced' elisp novices and/or emacs novices 'looking to get serious'. The code is amply commented, and package configurations are as decoupled as possile. Perfect to learn how to write elisp and how to configure some of the more commonly-used packages.\n  \nGive it a go!

After reading about them and experimenting with them deeper I have noticed how powerful they are. Aside from lack of documentation most of them are not used widely because they lack a good collection of snippets for various modes.

I used Emacs like this for nearly two years until recently I discovered that package-archive-priorities exists, so I would like to make it part of my init.el now.\n I rewrote my package config:\n (require 'package) (add-to-list 'package-archives '(\"melpa\" . \"https://melpa.org/packages/\")) (add-to-list 'package-archives '(\"nongnu\" . \"https://elpa.nongnu.org/nongnu/\")) (setq package-archive-priorities '((\"melpa\" . 3) (\"gnu\" . 2) (\"nongnu\" . 1))) (package-initialize) \n The reason I add \"Non GNU\" is for Emacs 27. Yes, I know that Emacs 28+ doesn't require that.\n I set the highest priority for MELPA. I'm using the numbers 3, 2, and 1 for priorities. Is there anything wrong with that kind of numbering? Just asking because most init.el configs I saw online used larger integers like 100, 50, and 25. Should I use the larger numbers instead? or it doesn't matter?\n Also, is there anything wrong in using the MELPA as the archive with the highest priority? I noticed that If I choose GNU ELPA as the main archive, the version of the company package that gets installed is an older version. It seems to me that the packages in MELPA are more up-to-date. The \"Non GNU\" archive doesn't seem to be a replacement for MELPA, at least not for now.\n    submitted by    /u/zoliky  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'll eventually learn things, but there's a couple of pet-peeves I have that I'd appreciate someone to clear up.\n First, emacs seems to litter my config folder with its own stuff. I want this folder to be backed up in my dotfiles repo, and I don't want extra stuff in it. Neovim for instance uses the config directory as \"read only\". It reads the configuration, and anything that it needs to save (like swap files, plugin data or even the plugins themselves) go into the .local/share/neovim directory. This is neat because it keeps the config tidy. Is there any way to make emacs do that?\n Second. Emacs vs Doom Emacs. I've seen people recommend Doom Emacs a lot.

I am looking specifically for in-place rendering, not in a separate buffer. My use case is rendering html export blocks inside an org file to have an interactive notebook like experience, without exporting the whole document to html and viewing it in a browser. \n This would allow one to use Emacs as a self-sufficient interactive environment, bringing interactive plots, boards, diagrams, graphs, tables etc. directly into already powerful text editing environment. This functionality exists a priori in web-based applications like Obsidian, VS Code (even with inline web-views), but those either become slower with each notebook cell, have json as a file format, or do not have serious text editing capabilities. I realize that such overlays are niceties, and one can always export and view the documents, but I believe that the described approach is alluring to many because it does not force one to split their thinking between creating and viewing.\n If there is no such package at the moment, I would be willing to implement it myself; however, I want to ask people who looked into Emacs rendering and text overlay capabilities if something of that sort is even possible. Or is it easier to rewrite Emacs GUI with something like Tauri? :)\n I am also happy to hear about other approaches or views on this problem which worked for you!\n    submitted by    /u/alexander_demy  \n [link]   [comments]",

I use a non QWERTY keyboard layout (rsthd), and that makes using vim TERRIBLE, so like any normal person I changed my vim bindings to my layout. This caused a lot of issues regarding combos, and when I asked the vim community they said changing the default keymappings is a bad idea and I should just learn the default ones on my layout. I wanted to know how hard configuring Emacs is with a custom layout, maybe I should just switch sides.\n Tl;dr how does Emacs handle changing default keybindngs compared to vim?\n    submitted by    /u/dobeye  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I have a question about splitting my configuration into multiple files, for vanilla Emacs, i.e., no Doom/Spacemacs/etc...\n I currently have my configuration by split theme which I then load using either (load \"my-config.el\") or (require 'my-config). This work well, but it crucially means that it is difficult to compile the configuration files (using the byte compiler or the automatic native compiler). This is because some of these config files have some dependencies on each other. In particular, all my config files assume that the load-path is set correctly and use-package and straight are installed and configured so that packages can be installed or used. When compiling files, especially using the asynchronous native compiler, these files are compiled in batch mode in a vanilla Emacs without any configurations. Hence any statements using unloaded packages would fail.\n What is the correct way to do this? I know I can put all my config in a single file (literate or otherwise) but I think this will get unwieldy quite quickly for me.\n    submitted by    /u/Tohiko  \n [link]   [comments]",

I mostly develop in Elixir, so configured lsp with elixir-mode and found that xref-find-definitions triggered from the embark menu was working great and a real time saver.\n A couple of weeks ago, xref-find-definitions stopped working. I don't think I changed anything in my init.el, at least not related to lsp-mode or elixir-mode and definitely nothing related to xref. Now I always get No definitions found in the minibuffer whenever I call xref-find-definitions (either via C-. RET or M-.) even for items I know worked a few weeks ago. I've switched to using dump-jump in the meantime which is a great package but isn't as well integrated into embark.\n Can anyone point me in the right direction for diagnosing this issue?\n    submitted by    /u/hairlesscaveman  \n [link]   [comments]",

However, often enough to have made \"undo\" a part of my muscle memory after using those, it seems to be behaving like ace-jump-zap-to-char by cutting everything in between. I use the zap command, but I am not confusing it with the other two here.\n This has been going on for a while (at least through three iterations of my OS), but I am finally getting around to reporting it.

Or maybe I am wrong?\n BUT... maybe... there are some cons? And perhaps some are a dealbreaker preventing me to migrate from Emacs/Spacemacs to Aquamacs?\n For people who have used Aquamacs, what has been your experience? What are are pros and cons against a regular Emacs? Were there any dealbreakers?\n Also, how is it running Aquamacs and regular Emacs (with Spacemacs) on the same computer/user account? Will they play along nicely and don't mess things up, or they will be rewriting each others' configs all the time?\n UPDATE:\n I am using Evil mode, and also a leader SPC key so I basically don't use traditional Command bound Emacs keybindings.\n This seems to be a frequent \"con\" by people coming from vanilla Emacs when I try to find some cons of Aquamacs via Google - but in my case, that is not an issue.\n I am more worried about the compatibility of packages and code of Emacs Lisp scripts I will find on the Internet and whether it will run or not.\n Also, are there any weird hidden you-might-notice-them-only-after-a-few-months quirks that Aquamacs has when compared with vanilla Emacs?\n    submitted by    /u/East_Staff3288  \n [link]   [comments]",

It exists as a sort of second user land, integrating the underlying OS's built in libraries and utilities into a rich-text interface powered by thousands of lines of tried and true lisp code.\n Microsoft Windows is also a wholly remarkable existence. It, too, has quite the history; yet the Windows OS itself (and DOS before it) has largely served as a mcguffin in its own tale. Indeed, the rise of Microsoft and the personal computer seem to have taken place in spite of their OS's glaring deficiencies rather than because of any particular merit.

Still working on a better workflow than what I have currently \n I was wondering if someone has tried to integrate Emacs with their stream deck ? \n Here is what I imagine it would be useful for : \n - starting and stopping project timer with org-clock\n - global macros for pulling up a new notes or todo entry, or just general emacs macros\n - macro pad for more exotic commands that one might want to run every so often, or for switching buffers (with preview of the buffer name on the stream deck ?)\n ​\n All of these to me seem like feasible and useful. As I am relatively new to programming and elisp, I have a vague idea of how to implement this myself, but if someone has already gone through the trouble I would be happy to hear how they went about it !\n I use Doom emacs - macros and key bindings are pretty clear and easy to implement but more ways of interacting with emacs would be a plus for me ! \n I imagine for the global commands something like the emacs api would need to be used, I've got to look into it more.\n    submitted by    /u/FailedHumanPrototype  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Would it be possible to use emacs as a keyboard macro and automation tool outside of emacs.\n There is things like keyboard maestro for mac or autohotkey that let you create macros and assign them to keys in certain programs. Autohotkey uses an alien syntax and keyboard maestro is mostly mouse based. They are ok but I always wondered if using elisp and emacs would be a more powerful combination. Besides, it would ran on all platforms. Would emacs server be able to do something like this? Anyone ever tried to do something like this?\n I have never tried EXWM but looking at performance I dont think it would work for me since this is for heavy post production tools.\n Update: thanks for the Linux suggestions but I am looking for a solution that runs on Mac and Windows mostly since all post production tools widely used run on those.\n    submitted by    /u/Mamonimoni  \n [link]   [comments]",

The reason I haven't written it yet is because while elisp is cool and I'd like to be able to understand it, I haven't had the time yet (and after I am done with work, I barely have the brain power to read a book, not to learn a wholly different language). \n Any pointers would be most appreciated!

I've started pouring the foundation in my ZK for this 20-week project: nine books, a dozen short stories, and a half dozen writing assignments. I started reading a couple of weeks ago, but now I must pour gas on the fire and read a lot.\nRefactored my Keyboard Maestro note templates. I simplified them and made them more broadly applicable.\nMy current plans for this coming week:\nClass starts on the 23rd, and I have seven more books to read in preparation. Lots of reading ahead with little time for zettelkasting.\n\n\nWhen I'm procrastinating class work/reading, I'll be reading:\n\n\n\nHere are a few of the titles and one-sentence summaries of zettel I created last week.\nI'm excited about \"Literate Programming,\" Donald Knuth's thesis on this programming paradigm has arrived at the library on interlibrary loan.

          "description": "@rl911 said over on the tread:\n(\"What is incremental writing\" )\n\n\nThis video demonstrates the critical idea of deconstructing or digesting reading and using the components or nutrients as building blocks for writing/idea creation and synthesis. It goes over the process with a lapidarist skill. Reading and writing are not something that abides by a deadline but is enjoyable without time pressures. It is rewarding to write on three-year-old ideas and see them pop up in a review queue. Reminiscence is falling in love all over again. New note:\nWhat is meant by reminiscing 202207302048\nI want to consider the prioritization aspects of zettelkasting in this video. I see his point about how with everything prioritized and working from a prioritized list, you can be sure what time you spend zettelkasting is in the areas you have made your highest priorities.\nI've not felt the need to set zettelkasting priorities formally, have you?",

Specifically with getting syncing going between vim installations on iPhone, iPad, and MacBook.\nVim on the mobile devices is actually iVim, an amazing porting of vim to the iOS environment. It has a command (:iexdir) that, in spite of Apple’s sandboxing, makes it possible to establish connections with external directories. I’ve used it to set up a connection to iCloud Drive. My intention was to enable syncing between my iPhone, iPad, and MacBook..\nI’ve adopted wiki.vim as my writing plugin of choice. I requires that I place a path to to the root directory in my .vimrc. With a lot of trial-and-error and pleas for help I’ve tried without success to identify a workable path to the directory I’ve placed in iCloud Drive.\nAt one point I thought I’d discovered a workable path in a file in iVim’s system directories. It is “ /private/var/mobile/Containers/Data/Application/BBD512C7-CCA0-47FD-B2F2-0AF17D9D03B5/Documents/wiki”. Alas, iVim does not recognize the path.\nI desperation, wanting to move on from fiddling with technology to must writing, I’ve signed up for Bear Notes, mainly for the syncing between devices it provides. I feel like a traitor. I would much prefer to continue experimenting with zettelkasten with vim as my companion.\nI write in the unlikely chance, and the desperate hope, that someone here might be able to point me to a solution.\nThanks in any case.",

          "description": "Greetings and thank you all for being part of a knowledge-sharing community. I'm not sure exactly what I was doing a few weeks ago when  stumbled across a ZK article online. But I've been on a mission ever since to learn more and get my own implementation going. I have decided to use Obsidian, which is of course presents its own learning curve as well as the terrifying array of choices and customization options that come with it.\nI am in my fifties and have been writing down notes on paper here, there, and and everywhere, for decades. But I never knew exactly what to do with all this material except for some occasional reviews, and when I found something of significant interest it might end up in a Word document, often along with other ideas that might have been somewhat related, and that would go into a subfolder somewhere, and soon it would be almost as hard to find as the original fleeting note was. I also have marginalia in almost every book I own, and I try to read a couple books a week, so there is a lot of that too.\nNow that I see that the ZK method can rectify my poor organizational system, I am looking at my stacks of notebooks (and all those Word documents) and thinking.... wow, I should go through every last scrap and filter out the precious metals from the useless rocks, and get it all into my ZK. That will be a lot of time. Time that could be spent instead reading more books, which might provide a greater return on investment in terms of useful ideas and more polished knowledge that I can leverage.\nI suppose the nominal approach is to set aside a certain amount of time every day to sift through the mound, knowing that eventually I can get it all accounted for.  It is at the heart of it an optimization question. But I am interested in reading about how others have dealt with the burden of getting a ton of unorganized and often useless notes into a new ZK.\nThanks for reading!",

It started on paper with a lovely Moleskin book and a black fine liner from Neuland. Going digital with my Bullet Journal I decided to use a brilliant tool for note taking named OneNote. But time went by. In March 2022 I got my first contact with Obsidian and at the same time with the Zettelkasten method from Niklas Luhmann explained in the brilliant book from Sönke Ahrens about “How to take Smart Notes”.\nMigration from OneNote to Obsidian was a migration from structured notes to networked notes. But how to migrate a Bullet Journal to a Zettelkasten? Difficult to switch from one concept to another? No, it’s very easy. The Bullet Journal is now a set of Structure Notes in my Zettelkasten. Also Zettelkasten is a Custom Collection in my Bullet Journal.\nIn other words:\nmy Zettelkasten is a Bullet Journal and\nmy Bullet Journal is a Zettelkasten.\nThe best of all: I did not need to change the basic concepts from Ryder Carroll (Bullet Journal), neither the concepts from Niklas Luhmann (Zettelkasten). Both concepts support each other in a perfect manner.\nWhat about your experiences with theses methods? Do you use the Dataview plugin to support your Bullet Journal collections?\n—\n\n\nAhrens, Sönke.
