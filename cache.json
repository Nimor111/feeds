          "description": "imo Linear types is really cool and could revolutionize how haskell is written (eg alternatives to \"builder\" patterns, IO monad, bracket functions, \"move semantics\", etc.)\n But! There's a few factors that seem to make it unusable except for specific safety-centric code (I played with the ergonomics extensively last year by toying with a linear version of prim (eg https://github.com/daig/prim/blob/%E2%98%B8/class/Cmp.hs))\n  \nBasic quality of life stuff around linearity inference eg in let/where/case binding\n Lack of effective multiplicity polymorphism.\n Lack of sugar for Movable types (eg primitive numeric types, for which copy and move are identical - Ur is not a good solution for these basic types imo)\n Lack of linear primops.\n Lack of optimizations making use of linearity eg to shortcut garbage collection.\n Lack of support for automatic lifetime management (This isn't really essential, but currently it's akin to using manual new and delete with static guarantees - which is great but still cumbersome relative to C++ RAII or Rust's lifetimes, and I believe could be inferred statically. Maybe it's actually possible just with library support for something like a linear ResourceT monad but that still feels a bit unsatisfying)\n As far as I can tell, it's solely the brainchild of Tweag - which is great to have industry support, but worrying in terms of robustness and longterm support as GHC develops. Linear types really needs fairly deep integration with the rest of GHC to be most useful.\n  \n1/2/3 are the only ones really stopping me from going all-in on linearity right now, but I expect all of them to get resolved eventually so long as 7 isn't an issue.\n So my question is: What's the latest developments on linear types in haskell / who is working on it / what's the best place to keep updated?\n    submitted by    /u/CoBuddha  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Idris has a nice construct for a sort of \"anonymous bind\",\n main = print (!readNumber + 5) \n which is syntactic sugar for\n main = do x <- readNumber print (x + 5) \n What's nice about ! is that you can nest !s arbitrarily (and mix them with pure code) without needing to name any intermediate results; the desugaring does the sensible depth-first left-to-right evaluation you'd expect. (I'd note that ! is more powerful than the suggestion described here, since the applicative syntax doesn't neatly support nesting; complex expressions end up in a join/pure soup.)\n Anyway, I was just wondering whether the GHC language design team had ever seriously considered porting this? There does seem to be demand for it: many mainstream imperative languages (even JavaScript!) have adopted ! - they just pronounce it await (and it's only applicable in their \"promise\" monad).\n    submitted by    /u/benjaminhodgson  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi everyone, is there an alternative formulation of monad transformers that allow removing any reference to the base monad inside the e.g. bind definition of the transformer ? \n The reason I'm asking for that is I'm porting some Haskell transformers to Python, for which I would like to avoid chains of lift.lift.lift... \n A good way I found is simply to make a custom subclass of each transformer in the stack, so that they can be looked up for their lift by \"tag\" (the specific subclass) rather than numerical position (aka number of lift nesting). That would make composition of function using different monads very easy, even if they have not been designed to work together specifically \n This would still allows the user to use multiple transformers of the same type (e.g. StateT), since the user can create as many subclasses of StateT they want for each piece of state.\n The problem with that is that if the user uses e.g. SubclassofStateT.pure(42), the base monad is not known , and has to be \"resolved\" later (when looking up the index of this class in the stack to lift appropriately). Unfortunately automatic, lifting is not enough since the definition of e.g. pure() would require the knowledge of the base monad which we don't have at this stage. Hence the need for an alternative formulation that allows delaying this knowledge to later.\n EDIT: fix typos\n    submitted by    /u/Dasher38  \n [link]   [comments]",

Writing routes in a type-level DSL can be tricky because errors can get hairy, and you lose a lot of the benefits of interacting with GHC's type checker.

I have questions about Exercise D in Chapter 2.\n The first part of the question was easy to understand. It is about comparing lazy vs strict evaluation about the expression\n head (map f xs) where xs is a list of length n.\n -> With Strict evaluation the function f is applied to all elements in xs after which the first element of the list is retrieved. So function f is applied n times.\n -> With lazy evaluation the expression is reduced to\n let p = map f xs in head (p)\n which reduces to f applies to the first element in XS. i.e. f xs0 \n ​\n In the second part of the question, there is a function filter p which when applied to a list returns a list of elements that satisfies the boolean test p.\n filter :: (a -> Bool) -> [a] -> [a]\n head . filter p xs returns the first element that satisfies the condition p. \n In the question I'm having a hard time visualizing how lazy evaluation will work. With innermost reduction, the filter is applied to each element of the list and a list with elements that satisfies p is returned and head takes the first element of the list. \n How will lazy evaluation work here? applying p to the input list might prune away elements from the output. \n Is it that with lazy evaluation, filter p is applied only until the first element in the list meets the criteria as opposed to eager evaluation where filter p is applied to all elements in the input list?\n    submitted by    /u/AngstyChippy  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm currently implementing a source code formatter using prettyprinter and ran into a situation that I can't get over.\n The assembly of the Doc is performed in the context of a state Monad, as I need to keep track of some state as I go on:\n  type StateDoc = State MyState (Doc ()) \n This works fine, I have individual functions that assemble different parts of the document:\n  fortmatPartA :: DataA -> StateDoc fortmatPartB :: DataB -> StateDoc fortmatPartC :: DataC -> StateDoc  It the end when I put the document together, parts A, B and C are to be arranged on top of each other vertically:\n vsep <$> sequence [formatPartA dataA, formatPartB dataB, formatPartC dataC]\n Now the problem that I'm having is that formatPartB and formatPartC can return an emptyDoc, which can result in something like [PartADoc, emptyDoc, PartBDoc]. This is a problem because emptyDocs have a height of 1 and will introduce an unwanted newline in the final document. I would like to completely ignore the part of the document if it returns emptyDoc.\n Does someone have an idea of how I can achieve this?\n I thought about not using emptyDoc at all, but Maybe instead:\n formatPartB :: DataB -> State MyState (Maybe (Doc ()))\n but how could I implement the \"excluding\" logic that ignores the Nothings? Is there something like a mapMaybe or catMaybe for Monads? Maybe I'm missing something obvious.\n Thanks a lot for your help and happy haskelling :)\n    submitted by    /u/jumpy_flamingo  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "At the moment, GHC has some machinery for tracking (annotating and inferring) the roles of parameters to type constructors. Roles and their machinery do not appear to be first class, in that it is not possible to discuss the roles of parameters to higher kinded type variables. This is a bit annoying, because in the absence of the ability to discuss such things one has to explicitly carry around coercion dictionary baggage.\n The \"role\" of a parameter roughly encodes the sort of \"equality functor\" the type-level function is. Specifically, the role of some type constructor's parameter determines what kind of equivalence it needs as input in order to produce a representational equivalence as output. If it requires _, the parameter has a _:\n  \ndefinitional equality, nominal role\n representational equivalence, representational role\n codiscrete equivalence (any two things are equal), phantom role\n  \nSo it seems to me that properly speaking, the role actually belongs to the -> in the kind of the type constructor in question. Namely we have three different variations:\n  \nhaskell type Nominal :: Type -{NOM}-> Type data Nominal x where Nominal :: Nominal Int \n haskell type Representational :: Type -{REP}-> Type data Representation x = Representational x \n haskell type Phantom :: Type -{FAN}-> Type data Phantom x = Phantom \n  \nSimilar systems of inference, notation, \"subtyping\" etc. could be devised to the ones for linear function arrows (which occur at the type level), so that working with these things is not very painful. It might also make sense to think of \"role polymorphism\", although I personally haven't given this much thought.\n What do you folks think? Am I missing something obvious?\n EDIT: The Reddit editor ate half my post and I had to rewrite it, apologies to anyone who saw the truncated version.\n    submitted by    /u/dinkandenza  \n [link]   [comments]",

While Prelude gets a lot of shit, it's so minimal and unopinionated that it really encourages creating language features as libraries. With QuasiQuoters you can take this to a logical extreme, convincing the compiler to compile whatever you want essentially. It seems to take very little convincing to get the language to do anything you want in the way you want as long as it's logically well formed.\n Personally as someone who loves programming language design it's really incredible, if there's a feature in another language that I want to try, I don't have to switch languages, I can find a package or just stub out an implementation in a weekend. I've heard this used as a point against Haskell however, because it lets you work with very bizzare computational models and can make a code base feel kind of disjointed. Personally, I don't buy that, while Haskell does have modules that let you differ from the norm, the norm tends to be the easiest option. You CAN have Alan Kay style objects, you CAN have prolog style logic programming, but why would you when the language is still so effective without them. Of course, eDSLs are a thing too, tho they're less hot pluggable language features and more an incredibly nice design pattern that arises naturally from the language design unless they're designed to operate more generically.\n Anyway, Haskell is cool and I wanted to talk about it, but I'm sure I'm preaching to the choir here.\n    submitted by    /u/VincyThePrincy  \n [link]   [comments]",

I find it somewhat vexing how these different error types cannot mix because they carry different information, and I would like to be able to propagate them to a higher level in my program where the errors can be handled properly.\n To this end I have added a monadic Result type for my own application that is roughly data Result a = Valid a | Invalid Error where Error is my own error sum type that can represent any external error that the program might have to handle. Result has the obvious Functor, Applicative, and Monad instances, and I use it to wrap most actions that can fail including reading and writing files, parsing, validating user input, and so on.\n Is this a good approach?

I've seen the pipes library which looks very similar, but I couldn't figure out to use it in a way, where I have to update a value in one place and all threads are notified about it.\n Probably I am still thinking too much in an imperative way, but maybe you can help me go into the right direction. Thank you for your help.\n    submitted by    /u/Intektor  \n [link]   [comments]",

I see that I could make applyActivity into a function of an Activity class, but then problem is that this solution is only straightforward if only one argument is using this pattern.

The part of resolution order makes sense to me (with some configuration of OVERLAPS/OVERLAPPABLE).\n But I know why I can't write this - the a in the instance definitions match all types! And the instance resolution simply does not use the constraints to resolve the instances. My understanding of the reasoning for this design is that Haskell would become internally inconsistent, because in different contexts, prettyOrShow could have different behavior for the same types in different contexts. Great - I love that - super safe. But in this case I DONT CARE. I want to write this out of convenience - so I don't care about safety here - if the behavior is inconsistent I will still sleep deeply and peacefully . If we had dependent constraints or something similar, perhaps this would be easy - but as it stands - this is not...\n Is there a way to do what I want to do? Make it as grimy as you like.

          "description": "I've been studying FP for a while now in my spare time, mostly in Scala and TypeScript. I've gotten very deep into it. I feel I have a strong understanding of all the core concepts, as well as all the most common monads and other main design patterns. In short, I feel like I've got a very solid grasp of programming in FP.\n My problem lately just comes down to putting it all together at scale. Whenever I've tried to write a full app using purely FP design principles, it feels like it becomes a mess as I layer on more and more features. Because of this, I feel my main limitation is how to use functional composition for a larger system when dealing with network requests/responses, database operations, dependency injection, loose coupling, etc. I can write an application that does all these things, I just haven't been really happy with the results.\n What I'm hoping to get is one of two things. The first would be an example codebase, something open on GitHub. Something using, maybe, http4s and cats? Something that I can look through and study how it's been architected, maybe even transcribe it (I have found that re-writing code makes it stick in my head better than just reading it).\n On the other hand, maybe there are some tutorials/courses/etc out there which cover this kind of stuff. I really do NOT want one of those \"This is a functor\" type FP courses, I don't need that at this point. Something that goes much deeper into full-scale application construction is what I'm after.\n Thanks in advance for any help and guidance you can provide.\n    submitted by    /u/Droid2Win  \n [link]   [comments]",

I've got a lot more experience with Java & Kotlin than Scala, fyi.\n Anyway, while doing this Akka course I just decided to create a nice simple utility function within an object to abstract away all the boilerplate setup/teardown for actor systems during the course:\n package io.me.akka package io.me.akka.utils // BONUS: Not my main question, but why do we declare packages twice? import akka.actor.ActorSystem import scala.concurrent.ExecutionContext.Implicits.global object ActorSystemHandler { def useSimpleSystem(name: String, useSystem: ActorSystem => Unit): Unit = { val system = ActorSystem(name) useSystem(system) system.terminate() .map(_ => println(\"ActorSystem terminated\")) } } \n My issue is when i try to use this into one of my lesson objects, like so:\n package io.me.akka package io.me.akka.part2actors import io.me.akka.utils.ActorSystemHandler // This is the line for #2 import akka.actor.{Actor, ActorRef, Props} object ChangingActorBehavior extends App { ActorSystemHandler.useSimpleSystem(\"systemName\", system => { // Do stuff with the system }) } \n There are two main issues that occur:\n  \nWhen I type the name ActorSystemHandler, I get the option to auto-import it like usual in IntelliJ. However, when I actually click that option, nothing happens. The IntelliJ auto-import fails to do anything.\n I go ahead and manually add the import statement, as can be seen above. However, \"io.me.akka\" part of the import is shaded in that grayish color that IntelliJ uses to indicate something is not necessary.\n  \nI'm hoping someone can clarify the above points for me. Manually adding the import results in code that will compile/run, but I feel like I'm doing something wrong. Thanks.\n    submitted by    /u/Droid2Win  \n [link]   [comments]",

I am a front-end web developer, tired of JS-TS.\n First of all, I am not familiar with Scala and its ecosystem, so, sorry about that.\n I own a startup which is close to make a deal with an organization for a serious project.\n I always search for viable JS alternatives and really like Scala as a language (even though I have no experience with it).\n For the last 2 days I am researching on how to embrace Scala-js. I managed to gather some information. \n Concern no 1: interop with the JS ecosystem. Solution: scalably-typed\n Concern no 2: react bindings. Solution: Slinky\n Concern no 3: bundler. Solution: Not so sure, but I've found scalajs-bundler which works with webpack, but I am unsure about the integration with Concern no 4 bellow.\n Concern no 4: Monorepo setup-build system. \n If anyone is familiar with JS ecosystem, there is the nx.dev monorepo managing tool which has the features I need for this project, which will be structured with a feature based folder structure.\n What I need:\n  \napps folder containing 3 applications which will share many libraries-modules from the libs folder mention bellow \n  libs folder which will contain feature based modules, for reuse across the 3 apps\n  \nSomething like this:\n apps/\n ├─ app-1/\n ├─ app-2/\n ├─ app-3/\n libs/\n ├─ feature-1/\n ├─ feature-3/\n ├─ feature-4/\n ├─ feature-2/\n ​\n How can I achieve this? Anyone with experience with something similar?\n As a reminder, those 3 apps and libs will target JS, and will need a bundler.\n Is it possible to only build the affected apps when changing some feature on libs folder?\n Even if it is possible, how maintainable will it be?\n Thank you for your answers!\n    submitted by    /u/AkisArou  \n [link]   [comments]",

I can't seem to figure out how to write a test to listen for messages coming back to the TaskManager actor that I spawned. When running the test, it times out waiting for the receiveMessage() event.\n Here's my test code:\n  \"Task Manager\" must { \"be able to create sessions and receive a reply from the session when its created\" in { val taskManager = spawn(TaskManager()) val sessionProbe = createTestProbe[SessionCreated]() taskManager ! CreateSession(\"session1\") val reply = sessionProbe.receiveMessage() // ^^ times out } } \n I've been searching the docs and Googling everywhere, but I can't seem to find any documentation on how to listen for a message that should come back to an Actor that was spawned in the test.\n ​\n I've tried adding a new parameter to the CreateSession message to supply the probe ref, but then the probe receives the message instead of the taskManager actor, and thus the taskManager won't complete the changes that I need to test subsequently.

          "description": "Ok, I've been learning akka, and I'm trying to wrap my head around thread safety. Let's recap\n JAVA THREAD MEMORY MODEL\n All threads have their own little slice of memory exclusive to that thread. Periodically the JVM will sync the thread memory values to main memory, but it's not guaranteed when that will happen. This is why different threads can see different values of a variable.\n Volatile of course bypasses this by making a given variable always be read/written from/to main memory. Synchronized enforced the other piece of this, ensuring that only one thread at a time can interact with it to prevent race conditions.\n AKKA ACTOR THREAD MEMORY MODEL\n So I do not totally understand this, but here is what I do understand. AKKA has its own thread pool, and is purely message based. A given actor is executed on any available thread when a message is present for that actor.\n The first thing that trips me up is that Akka only executes a message on a given actor one at a time. Ie, a given actor will process messages synchronously. I could be wrong about this, please tell me if I am. This just seems like a bad model for concurrency vs a more traditional approach like the thread-per-request model of a traditional webapp like Spring.\n The second thing is that while this kind of message processing rule would prevent race conditions, it feels like memory consistency would still be an issue. If an actor can be operated on by multiple threads, even if those threads can't touch it concurrently, how do all the threads see the same state value? Wouldn't there be a risk of memory consistency issues? Are actors somehow made entirely volatile?\n CONCLUSION\n I clearly do not understand some key stuff here. Guidance would be appreciated.

          "description": "Howdy. So I have worked with Scala before but quite a few years ago. It was my big introduction to functional programming and by the end of the project I understood functional programming just well enough to be interested in it. Since then I have studied it extensively in languages that are not purely functional, mainly TypeScript, and this has motivated me to pick up Scala again.\n I know that Scala 3 has just come out. Obviously I would like to work with the latest version. However my experience with other major software updates leaves me a bit wary. I have seen in other ecosystems major updates causing widespread compatibility issues with common libraries resulting in a highly complicated process of figuring out what will and will not work with the new version.\n On that note, I'm hoping for clarity on a few points:\n 1) does scala 2 code compile in a scala 3 project?\n 2) will third party libraries written for scala 2 still be compatible with Scala 3? I'm inclined to say yes because it all compiles to Java bytecode but I just want to be sure.\n 3) any other pitfalls that someone with limited scala experience who will be starting with Scala 3 should know?\n Thanks in advance.\n    submitted by    /u/Droid2Win  \n [link]   [comments]",

But I'm working through the book at https://book.purescript.org/ and am wondering why the code and tests all produce a bunch of warnings?\n For example, one warning I see for the Chapter 2 code is:\n  \nNo type declaration was provided for the top-level declaration of ns\n  \nI'm working in VSCode and have v0.14.7 of purs (and generally the latest versions of everything as far as I know).

I want to fold all of them with append, producing a sequence of the folded values.\n I imagine different semigroups have different implementations of append. However, while the compiler can know it'll have to deal with some manner of semigroup, it cannot know ahead of time what each member may be. How is the correct function ultimately determined? Is there some runtime check with the equivalent of typeof/instanceof which decides the correct function?\n I guess a related question is what happens in practice if data don't match their type? For example, if I ask a database for data, expecting a sequence of integers, but a cosmic ray conspires to ruin my day, and I end up getting garbage.

Some ideas I had was to change header colors, add images (which I have sort of figured out), and maybe add borders or something.\n Another issue caused by my constant mental blockages is organization. When I had seen projects in the Doom dashboard I thought this would work but it seems designed for coding projects. How does everyone organize their org files? I'd like to find a way to set up a notebook type thing and open a directory in a buffer to navigate between the different files. Like a table of contents for every projects, and maybe a master TOC for all of my org files.\n Again, sorry for the long winded post. I suck at Reddit, and don't expect much response cuz long posts get ignored, but figured I'd shoot my shot.\n    submitted by    /u/DocHoliday89  \n [link]   [comments]",

I am trying to decide which one to use in the future. \n I really enjoy org-mode. The only problem for me is that since I do not do programming, I do not know any computer language. I have to copy and paste settings by other people for different purposes, such as spelling check, formatting, preview, etc. RMarkdown in RStudio sets up things for me and I can download some packages by others without any specific setup. \n I also feel that I do not fully use amazing functions of org-mode. For example, while I really like the to-do list and agenda, I do not know how to seamlessly synchronize my calendar (Mac OS) and my org-mode agenda. Many of my meetings are scheduled by others sending me .ics files. I can just go to my calendar and click \"accept\" or \"decline\". Is there a way to automatically make the item appear in my org-mode agenda when I add items on my apple calendar? \n Anyway, maybe too much information here.

Quoting the Quick start Guide:\n  \nLines that start with an asterisk * are headings. \n A single * denotes a 1st-level heading, ** denotes a 2nd-level heading, etc.\n  \nSo far, everything is clear. We have headings, with levels. Fine. Where I stop following is when I export, say to a html buffer (C-c C-e h H) every heading level has been decreased: one star headings are tagged as h2 and two stars as h3. Here, on a very basic test file: \n https://preview.redd.it/p9pbaypvm8j81.png?width=1165&format=png&auto=webp&s=23832603cda8cec5ff07bd711f661d8fe71f2902\n Since I am rather new to Org and to Emacs, I imagined I had some issue with my Org configuration or that I screwed up something elsewhere in Emacs, as I so often do.

          "description": "I started using orgmode two months ago after I learnt about it from videos from thoughtbot. Never having used emacs before and not knowing lisp it took me while to ramp up on it. I found the way you can have neatly nested lists and have math equations quite nice. I set up org roam as well . Everything on doom emacs. But after 2 months of using it I find myself in a situation where it has turned out to be not all I expected it to be. * The org roam promise of becoming a second brain didn't really work for me. Maybe I'm not using it correctly but having backlink info in the buffer I didn't find that useful. It's not easy to find things unless you remember the name or keywords in the title.\n  \nWriting long documents feels clunky in orgmode. Maybe it's more adapted to short todos. I don't know how to explain it\n \nExport options : I can export to pdf but the output often doesn't look good with the weird section numbering. Having nested items looks good inside orgmode but not in an exported pdf. There's no option to export to doc that I'm aware of. It makes collaboration with others difficult\n \nIt doesn't work well with tools my team uses with slack and google docs. \n \nAnd many others\n \n Has anyone else felt like this? What am I doing wrong? I'm planning to go back to vs code and mark down files because emacs looks like a big investment. But I really like the idea of a macro enabled editor.\n Edit: I didn't expect such useful and positive feedback from everyone. You guys are the best. I found some promising stuff . I'm going to give it another try. Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/Alternative-Ant-4741  \n [link]   [comments]",

So for example if I have in window 1 a block of text that is at a third level, when I am going to paste in window 2 `at a specific point` at a 5th level, is `not` going to be recognized that need to be pasted \"under\" the 5th level and so be recognized as a 6th level the heading(from window 1) and at a 7th level the relative subheading. \n I would rather select multiple files in window 1 and paste in window 2:\n 2) I would like to select multiple headings, or subheadings in window 1 an then just paste them in window 2, so far I have been able only to do it one per time, instead I was expecting to cut in window 1 all the text I needed and then paste all in window2 (I mean like when I am using a resource browser on a PC and I select with control click all the items i need(not consequential) and then paste on a certain point in window 2\n    submitted by    /u/ivano_GiovSiciliano  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I have been on a quest to decrease my Emacs startup time and found something that I haven't seen mentioned on any of the blogs I came across on the topic. I think it is fairly well known that if you use straight.el, deactivating package.el in your early-init.el will speed up your starting time. What I only just found out is that on launch, straight does a lot of checks to see if any of the packages installed have been altered. This process can be changed by modifying the straight-check-for-modifications variable. I don't edit any of my straight packages by hand, so I have this set to nil, before bootstrapping straight. This brought my startup time from ~2 seconds to ~0.5 seconds, for loading over 200 packages. Maybe there are some reasons why one shouldn't do this that I don't know, but it seems to be a nice way to save some time!\n For more information, see this section of straight's read-me: https://github.com/raxod502/straight.el#customizing-when-packages-are-built\n Hopefully this is of help to someone!\n    submitted by    /u/jamez5800  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I use .emacs-custom.el to contain the customizations made by the interactive functions. However, I'd like to start moving some of that stuff out so I can manage it myself and make comments. I tried pulling some stuff out and putting into my init.el, but it didn't work. Namely, I pulled out these:\n '(org-todo ((((class color) (min-colors 89)) (:weight normal :box (:line-width 1 :color \"#808080\") :foreground \"#FF00FF\" :background \"#f0f0f0\")))) '(org-upcoming-deadline ((t (:foreground \"#FF33FF\")))) '(org-warning ((t (:background \"#ffffa0\" :foreground \"#ff33ff\" :weight normal)))) \n Why don't these work within my init.el? I tried them before and after my (load custom-file).\n EDIT: Ok I see I'm supposed to use set-face-attribute. So I tried wrapping the above, but this doesn't work\n (set-face-attribute 'org-todo ((((class color) (min-colors 89)) (:weight normal :box (:line-width 1 :color \"#808080\") :foreground \"#FF00FF\" :background \"#f0f0f0\")))) \n EDIT 2: I figured out the answer. A correct, commonly used form for set-face-attribute is like this:\n (set-face-attribute 'org-todo nil :box '(:line-width 1 :color \"#808080\") :weight 'normal :foreground \"#FF00FF\" :background \"#f0f0f0\") \n And it probably didn't work with a straight copy because each of those first three lines, I think those are args to the function (custom-set-faces...). I don't know what it does behind the scenes, but I guess it wants its args in a certain format.\n    submitted by    /u/Status-Detective-783  \n [link]   [comments]",

Spacemacs is too late for some of the important items like native comp and their develop branch sometimes has bugs.\n I would like to minimize the changes in my workflow, if I cant keep them the same(keybindings et. al.). Replicating the same environment is proving to be cumbersome due to :\n - Spacemacs setup has too many packages, I am not even 1/4th of the way through and already the literate config is a couple of thousands of lines long.\n - I am used to the keybindings of spacemacs and replicating them is taking too much time. I have already built all the muscle memory and don't want a different set of keys.\n - Going through all the documentation of the packages to get the exact setup as I had in spacemacs is very tricky. Sometimes spacemacs has some clever ways of handling things, which needs me to look into spacemacs code.\n - Going over spacemacs code is complex.

But it's odd that it leaves a space there (why does it do that?). I'd rather it not, but I'll accept this standard behavior, for now, if that's just the way it works out-of-the-box. (I know I can change emacs to do whatever I want though.) Also, the C-S-RET behaves a little different if the point starts at the end of * Projects...x at space marked x. In that case, it creates something like this:\n  \nExample 5\n * PROJECTS... * TODO x <--- point here at space marked x * Inbox... \n \n In Example 5, it creates a new TODO item under the last child entry of * PROJECTS, but leaving * PROJECTS otherwise folded. Isn't it a little odd to have an intermediate parent invisible? \n Finally, does that last point position (marked x here:* Projects...x) have special meaning/purpose? Is there a name for that position?\n EDIT: I think some of my questions about the functionality of ellipses and spaces is probably related to this timely post: https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/t1r2wq/have_you_ever_wondered_how_orgmode_toggles_the/.

          "description": "At some point in I think 2021, read-extended-command-predicate was added, which lets you filter what M-x shows you. One of the intended use cases is to prevent commands for one major mode from showing up when working in another major mode. It's nil by default, but you can (setq read-extended-command-predicate 'command-completion-default-include-p)... except for the fact that basically no package I can find actually uses this, either by using\n (defun foo () (declare (modes . (lisp-mode))) (interactive) (message \"I only show up in some-mode\")) \n or by (put 'foo 'command-modes '(lisp-mode)). I'd like to go through all the commands whose names start with (say) python- and mark them as being python-mode commands. What's the easiest way to do that?\n PS, is there any downside to package authors doing this? The declare variation warns on older versions of emacs, but the put variation should work no matter what. I'm really surprised this has almost no adoption/conversation that I could find.

But if you set org-agenda-sticky to t , calling org-store-link from an agenda buffer gives the following error:\n user-error: No method for storing a link from this buffer \n After digging around a bit I think I found the culprit: for the agenda relevant behavior of org-store-link to be activated, you need to be in a buffer with the name specified in org-agenda-buffer-name. On my end, org-agenda-buffer-name is set to *Org Agenda*, but when org-agenda-sticky is set to t, agenda buffers have a different name of the form *Org Agenda(VIEW)*, where VIEW is the key to the relevant agenda view (so, e.g. *Org Agenda(a)*).\n Now, if I set org-agenda-buffer-name to e.g. *Org Agenda(a)*, I get org-store-link to work as expected when visiting an agenda buffer with that name. But I do not seem to be able to use org-agenda-buffer-name to get Emacs to recognize an agenda buffer when org-agenda-sticky is set to t.\n Any ideas?\n    submitted by    /u/graduale  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I am having a couple issues. I used to use mu4e for my gmail, and then switched away from mu4e to just using org-capture in the browser to capture the mails I need. This works well b/c the link to each email message is unique and persistent. However,\n  \nI recently started a job where we use an exchange server and access it online via outlook webmail. The org-capture browser function doesn't work well for this because the link to the message is (1) not easily captured and (2) is not persistent, e.g., it changes when I move the message to a different folder\n So I started using mu4e again, but it appears that refiling does not seem to sync. When I refile messages in mu4e it somehow disappears and I can't find it in outlook, even though the message is in the correct folder in my maildir. Why would this be? \n I made a test folder in outlook to see if that would sync and it did sync, and the folder appeared in my maildir\n I then made that folder the location of my refile function, and same thing happened, the message disappeared and is no longer visible in outlook. \n \n  \nAny thoughts on why refiling messages makes them disappear? Is it just some exchange server setting that I can't get around, or is it an easy fix on my end? \n Thank you!\n    submitted by    /u/tiktaaliki  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have to say that I set custom file location for \"Easy configuration\" on Emacs. \n (setq custom-file \"~/.emacs.d/emacs-custom.el\")\n (load custom-file)\n To select compiler in vhdl-mode there are two ways, and it is little bit confusing to me. I want to use Xilinx XST compiler. Let me explain.\n First, you can select compiler from drop-down menu. There are Compiler1 and Compiler2 options. If you tinker with these options, some text is saved to my emacs-custom.el file, but I can't see that something is configured there. To me it seems like it copied just to whole compilers list into that emacs-custom.el. Maybe it saves some options in other place too and I'm not aware of it?\n Second, which works, but its value is not saved anywhere! It looks like this. I have tried to put (vhdl-set-compiler \"Xilinx XST\")\n and it returned that error that function is void. If I do it manually by fallowing vhdl-mode drop-down menu, and then selecting \"Xilinx XST\" compiler, it works. But just in this emacs session. After the restart of emacs, I have to do it again manually :/ \n my emacs-custom.el : https://pastebin.com/iaTQbK17\n my init.el : https://pastebin.com/4GNLJMQB\n Any help is appreciated :)\n    submitted by    /u/bad63r  \n [link]   [comments]",

What is the best way to install emacs with these features? Do I have to build it from source? And if so are there specific flags or options that need to be enabled for it to be compiled with those options enabled? or are they enabled by default now?\n Thanks!\n EDIT: I managed to build it from source using the following and it (mostly) works:\n Into a directory: git clone https://git.savannah.gnu.org/git/emacs.git\n Then ran: ./autogen.sh in that directory\n Then ran: ./configure --with-pgtk --with-native-compilation --with-mailutils\n It kept failing until I installed all the following additional packages with sudo dnf install:\n  \nautoconf (to run the ./autogen.sh command)\n texinfo (for the makeinfo requirement)\n gtk3-devel (for the pgtk requirement)\n libgccjit-devel (for the native-comp requirement)\n gnutls-devel (because it needed gnutls-devel)\n ncurses-devel (it needed something in this package but I forget what)\n  \nThen ran make (took a while) then sudo make install in the directory and it installed!

The article basically explains what are Avy actions and how to create new ones. This got me inspired to create my own Avy actions, which I'd like to share with the community in the form of a literate config.\n The shared config, extends some notions and creates new ones (some left as a kind-of challenge in the mentioned article):\n ​\n - Region actions: actions that act in an arbitrary not visible region created with avy selections (copy, yank, kill, teleport). First you mark the initial point of the region with an action, then you execute a region action on the other end of the region.\n - Quick char commands: skip the initial filtering step of an Avy command pre-filtering a character. For example I use this in emacs-lisp mode to auto filter open parenthesis with a key binding, this is very useful as actions act on Sexp.\n - Auto actions: enable the automatic execution of an avy action on a selected candidate\n - Compound actions and commands: link several avy interactions in a single command or action using auto actions. This is useful for example for region actions, instead of executing two Avy commands to first mark the start of the region with a command and then select and act on the end of the region; you only execute a command that integrates two Avy interactions, the first one auto applies the mark action, then you select the action and element at the end of the region. I also use this for creating a replace action, combining kill and yank actions in one action.\n ​\n I hope this results useful for someone.\n    submitted by    /u/artema666  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Dear community,\n I'm looking for a comparison of the various note-taking-packages implementing the Zettelkasten-method. I don't want to build a second brain or create a personal wiki, instead I want to capture and link ideas for researching and writing.\n Using org, I'm naturally drawn to org-roam, however, I dislike the bulk of dependencies and its complexity stemming. Furthermore, I dislike, that I can't get a textual overview of a subset of notes belonging together (using a webserver-solution like org-roam-ui is not what I want here). Looking at the new zk-package, I want to note that I like its simple and clean approach, but I dislike, certain design decisions, like using spaces in file names and the fact, that it doesn't integrate deeply in the org-ecosystem, e.g. not utilizizing org-IDs. The last point is the biggest downside imho. While one could hack on the codebase to change this, another drawback seems to be that it is not really mature and doesn't seem to have a large userbase. \n Currently, I'm try out both of these very different options, but I can't really decide for on or the other, since both have different strengths and downsides. Therefore, I want ask for your opinions and experience with implementing the Zettelkasten-method (or a personalized derivation of it). Which horse should I put?\n Thanks in advance!\n    submitted by    /u/ExistingProgram3883  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "That's a bit of a strange post, but I hope it may spark some positive discussion: Emacs recently get tab support. First AFAIK from Centaur Emacs and then upstream. Tabs are common UI elements since years, however IMVHO in most cases are a very bad idea as they are normally: modern monitor are 16:9 and most people use them straight, not 90° rotated, so plenty of horizontal space, very little vertical one and tabs eat some of it while still being unable to scale well...\n On contrary \"experiments\" like Tab Center Redux (it's successor Tab Center Reborn) Firefox extension show that vertical tabs can scale well, they might be \"hard to choose\" at first, but actually work pretty well. They remain easy to read even when they are many, they might be scrollable if needed, integrated with switch-buffer search&narrow packages, they might co-exist with a sidebar (like those popular in IDEs), even on one and another side of the screen and potentially spark new UI ideas to extend them further. \n What do you think about that?\n    submitted by    /u/ftrx  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "When I view PDFs in Emacs using DocView, they appear much darker than they should:\n ​\n Emacs and Preview displaying the same PDF, where it is much darker in Emacs\n I am not sure why this happens -- I haven't changed any settings related to DocView or enabled any minor modes that would cause this. Disabling my current emacs config (by moving .emacs.d) does not resolve this. I am using the mituharu emacs-mac port from this Homebrew formula, but the issue also exists with the build from https://emacsformacosx.com. My .emacs.d is on GitHub here.\n Has anyone encountered a similar issue before? How would I go about resolving this?\n UPDATE:\n I found out that the issue is caused by GhostScript, as expressed in this comment. I've resolved it by installing mupdf (brew install mupdf), which should cause docview to use mudraw to convert PDFs to temporary PNGs instead of GhostScript. After installing mupdf, opening a PDF in DocView and running doc-view-clear-cache should resolve the issue.\n    submitted by    /u/ajaymt  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "So, to understand my problem, let me explain my situation.\n I am Greek and naturally a lot of my files are in greek. To make org export to a latex pdf properly, if it has greek characters, you need to add some packages to it. I have those in my org-latex-packages-alist and everything exports just fine. \n However, when we get to exporting org-roam files (or any file that contains file links for that matter), there is a problem. The org latex export backend typically exports a link like \\href{file_name}{description}. If the file name is in greek (which odds are it is), latex starts to freak out a bit. Org will export perfectly to latex, but latex won't export to pdf. To my understanding, it doesn't understand the greek characters in the file name (which it should as it understands them everywhere else) and it chooses not to export.\n After a lot of searching, I did manage to find a solution to this in this post. Basically, if the link is of the form \\href{\\detokenize{file_name}}{description}, it exports perfectly. From what I understand, that command just makes it recognize any unicode character for file names. \n So my question is, can you configure the org latex export backend to export links in the form \\href{\\detokenize{file_name}}{description} and not \\href{file_name}{description} as it does by default. I couldn't find any option that changes how hyperref makes its links in the hyperref manual, nor could I find how org exports its links to latex in the org-export manual, so if anyone here knows, it would help me greatly.\n Thanks in advance!\n    submitted by    /u/AuroraDraco  \n [link]   [comments]",

So I'm pretty excited to dive into Emacs, learn all about it and I know today its exactly the tool Id like for the rest of my computing career.\n I wanted to ask however to other emacs users, especially ex-Vimmers if readily slapping evil on emacs to make myself comfortable (at least on the text editing side) can hinder me from learning all the ins and outs of emacs?\n I have grown very accustomed to vim's text editing experience. Its so precise and short. I'm very used to changing text with up to 3 or 4 keystrokes to a precision that is very hard to get out of. I mean this in the best of ways, I really like Emacs and am having a lot of fun learning it. I'm just asking to better understand how I should go about this.

However, I haven't felt the same introauitiveness with org-roam-ui (the server counterpart for v2). And the graph always seems too cluttered and rather difficult to use for purposes of idea-link visualization. Has anyone else felt this? Is it just a matter of getting used to?\n PS: org-roam-ui certainly is useful for checking nodes and obtaining a visually appealing overview of the personal knowledge base. But something feels off. I wonder if it is related to different coloring algorithms, wherein org-roam-server seems to color \"daughter\" nodes close to the parent node, especially if the parent node is a \"hub\", whereas org-roam-ui seems to use no such heuristic.

          "description": "Using Manjaro Cinnamon.\n So a few weeks ago, I built Emacs with support for background-only transparency (it's awesome btw). The build was a little buggy, but after building, I decided to install it using 'make install' - having followed some comments on this sub and elsewhere that the side-by-side install would work, since the default directory would be my 'local', separate to where Arch puts pacman packages (where my normal Emacs is) - for safety I used the prefix option and called it 'TRANemacs'.\n But the background-only transparency emacs remained a bit buggy so I decided to uninstall using 'make uninstall'. Upon running my normal emacs, everything seemed to work normally except that the Cinnamon task bar shows an empty icon where the Emacs logo should be. Further digging shows that emacs has a logo, but emacs-client (which I guess is what gets started) doesn't. I reinstalled emacs with pacman but there is no change.\n Further to that, worth noting that it seems like 'make uninstall' did not cleanly remove everything related to TRANemacs, but I don't think the files left behind (e.g. the site-lisp folder) are very important.\n I'm not great at solving this sort of problem. Might anyone know how can I return the logo to emacs? And how do I prevent multiple emacs installations from clobbering each other in future?\n    submitted by    /u/LukeFL  \n [link]   [comments]",

Fade to black. \n I've read a few posts here and there about the need to get more people into Emacs. They usually focus on \"how to change emacs to appeal to a wider audience\". I'm not going to touch that subject, but simple marketing can be powerful. When I search google for \"Emacs Commercial\" I get a grand total of 20 results (none of which is a commercial). Youtube returns zero.\n Surely there's some skillful people out there, passionate about Emacs, who would also like to work on or collaborate on a few commercials?

I even think about using org-view-mode...\n Now my question is, what would be the best way to create and place the buffer? Shall I do it manually using basically split-window?

I also prefer to use a UID internal to the body of the text instead of using a filename as I am very new to this and still changing my titles. To create an internal link, I copy the UID number of the filename (without the title) at the top of the body of my zettel. Then in my second zettel, I open a [[]] and inside I paste the UID number of the first zettel. The [[UID]] becomes green. When I hover on it it says that the file is not found. When I click on it, a search is launched and I have my two zettels that appear in the search bar but the target zettel does not open automatically. Is it normal? Should it only open in the search bar?\nI saw that a \"#\" was sometimes set before the UID (in the body) of the zettel of origin. Is this necessary besides to denote that it is the zettel of origin?\nThank you and sorry if it is a bit messy (or very obvious), I am totally new with markdown and all of these softwares!",

Well more and more I find myself knowing-but-not-quite some fact or info, or knowing that I know it, but not the full details that I knew at one point, or references or sources for looking it up.\nSo I decided to take the plunge and implement a zettelkasten system for myself. But as I investigated it I became intrigued by the simple yet powerful idea of notes and links, and decided to try to distill (my interpretation of) its essence into a new app. Yes, the cliche of the software dev who discovers zettelkasten and makes an app. However, I think mine has some advantages.

What repeatedly evades my understanding, however, is the nature of links.\nI do not know when or how to use links. For example, if I have a note that defines the economic term \"coincidence of wants,\" and I have another note discussing how \"indirect exchange enables coincidence of wants in a diverse economy,\" should I: reference \"coincidence\" inside \"indirect exchange\"; reference \"indirect exchange\" in \"coincidence\"; do both of those; not link them at all but tag both notes with \"coincidence of wants\" and find them when I do the color-coded tag search?\nAnd then there's the matter of linking two (seemingly) unrelated ideas.

I was trying to figure out whether for my use case, the method of Zettelkasten (which fascinates me) would be a good idea.\nPrevious experience suggests it is risky. I got hooked on Org-mode and Spacemacs spending time on setting it up when I had a deadline approaching. When I finally realised I was out of time, I quickly turned to drafting my work in Textedit (Mac) and polishing it up in Word for the final PDF submission. This was efficient given time crunch, familiarity with tools etc. and worked well for a shorter piece.\nFor (this) larger piece o…",

I\"m sure many people here know this, but I thought I'd share it here as it wasn't obvious to me at first.\nIf you open a new window (from the Window menu), it opens a second copy of The Archive. Normally, this window operates independently of the first window.\nBut what I hadn't realized is that, if you have the second window open and highlighted, you can right click on links in the (unhighlighted) first window. If you hover over a link, right click and select Open Link in that window, it leaves the first window on its current page, and opens the link in the second window. Very cool. This is really useful for copying material between documents that are part of the same \"tree\" of documents, without losing your place or leaving the current document.",

I've been playing with it for just a few days now, and I've already found some of the KMs very helpful.\nThanks, @Will, for many of them!\nI was wondering if anyone had ever created a KM for inserting a link to a structure note on a zettel.\nFor me, I put my links to the structure note and other zettels at the very bottom of each zettel. I've used the naming convention for structure notes that includes the • between the UID and the text title.\nI was thinking if there was a way to set it up so it worked something like this:\nI place my cursor in the appropriate location in my zettel.\nI enter the key combination for the KM to insert my structure note link.\nIt then gives me a prompt, asking me which structure note I want to link to (it would limit it to those zettels with the • in the title).\nI select the appropriate structure note.\nIt automatically enters that structure note as a link in the format of UID and text title of the structure note.\nIs this possible? Is it unnecessary?\nThe reverse of this would be a time saver too. For me, I often add a link to my newest zettel to my structure note immediately after I create the zettel. So, if there was a way to go back to my structure note and use a KM to create a link to the most recently created zettel (of even a prompt to choose from one of the more recently created zettels) that would save time too.\nOr, have you guys found ways to save time and do this without a KM macro?",

That note is also connected to coaching and therapeutic ideas.\nI had some epiphanies and good concepts while working on those notes, and that created 2 other notes.\nAt first, I was writing everything in the first note \"Transform information into knowledge\" which was becoming almost like the start of an article. The \"flow\" got to me and I wrote some good ideas and made some good connections.\nI'm new to Zettelkasten but I remember the Permanent / Evergreen notes should be atomic and if possible, quite short.\nSo I splited my \"Transform information into knowledge\" note into 5 different notes.\nI now have 5 different notes, linked together, talking about the same idea.\nIn a MOC about Therapeutic Changes, I added all those 5 notes.\nIt's a bit confusing to me because naturally I would have kept \"Transform information into knowledge\" and let that note because a bit longer and like an \"index\" of all the others ideas, and put that note into my Therapeutic MOC.\nAnd when I see examples here and there I feel like permanent notes are not \"that short\" and even sometimes, not that atomic.\nWhat's the best method here in your opinion ? What's your take on this ?\nThanks a lot",

And this is not a personal choice, but a requirement of my profession.  But the \"output\" of a Zettelkasten, as far as I understand it, is a chain of associations of my own ideas, not some kind of source Wiki.\nBut I need both and more: on the one hand, I need to relate my sources to each other, i.e. \"who quoted whom\", \"who learned from whom\", \"who wrote letters with whom\", etc and all based on the originals. On the other hand, I want to process my ideas and thoughts on quotations, excerpts, themes, etc. in a Zettelkasten. But beyond that, I need to make sure that my Zettel always refer to the sources from which they are inspired.\nThe question I have is: what is the best way to do this? Do I need two \"boxes\", one for the verbatim quotes with sources and a proper Zettelkasten for my ideas? If so, how do I connect the two boxes? Or should I do \"double bookkeeping\" and always write the original quote and source on each Zettel?\nTo reiterate: I know how a wiki works, and I think I also know how to set up a Zettelkasten; what is not yet clear to me is how to connect these two systems.",
