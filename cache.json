          "description": "Hi, I'm reading <Get Programming with Haskell> book on Manning MEAP website and have difficulties in understanding its chapter 21, titled \"Hello World! - introducing IO types\". In my opinion, it seems to give wrong information. Below is an example:\n \"If main isn't a function, it should follow that neither is putStrLn. ... As you can see, the return type of putStrLn is IO(). Like main, putStrLn is an IO action because it violates our rule that function must return values.\"\n The author seemed to think \"IO ()\" isn't a value, which I don't agree with. So I googled and found the following on Haskell wiki https://wiki.haskell.org/Introduction_to_Haskell_IO/Actions:\n \"PutStrLn takes an argument, but it is not an action. It is a function that takes one argument (a string) and returns an action of type IO (). So putStrLn is not an action, but putStrLn \"hello\" is.\"\n So I think the author is completely wrong on that, isn't it? On the other hand, however, I read lots of good reviews on the book on Amazon website. Am I misunderstanding something?

          "description": "I'm untrained in music, but every bit of music theory I learn really increases my enjoyment of it. I wanted to learn to compose a bit, and the traditional method is counterpoint. So I did what any barely musically literate nerd would do: I started to write a program to verify that a counterpoint composition follows the rules when played against a given melody. Frankly it was an uphill battle. But finally, this weekend, I got it working.\n https://github.com/ludflu/counterpointer-report\n The main thing that stymied my earlier efforts was that I didn't understand the nature of musical intervals in a formal way. Every explanation I learned described it as a mathematically naive music student might require, which makes sense if I were trying to play the oboe or whatnot. Or, things would be explained in DSP terms, explaining how overtones work, etc. And that also makes sense, but....\n But what I really needed, was for someone to tell me that musical intervals are calculated using integers mod 12. Which actually makes a ton of sense when you think about how human's perceive relative pitch. Did you know that humans are the only animals we know of that perceive relative pitch? I'm pretty sure I learned that from David Huron's excellent book.\n Eventually I thought to ask someone over in /r/musictheory and things mostly worked out from there since I could use the Haskell modular-arithmetic library for the intervals, and Euterpea for representing notes and playing them via MIDI.\n Finally I had to hack around some broken stuff because Euterpea, though its a marvelous library, is not actively maintained and so needed some work to get it to run with modern Cabal. AND PortMIDI-haskell doesn't agree with Clang on OSX. But I was able to patch all those things locally to get everything running, and I submitted PRs to try and fix them up for everyone else.\n    submitted by    /u/ludflu  \n [link]   [comments]",

For example, let's say I have an effect for talking to the database:\n  data DB :: Effect where DBWrite :: Item -> DB m () DBRead :: Key -> DB m (Maybe Item) \n and types for errors and the database environment\n ``` data DBError = DeadLockError | ConnectionError\n data DBEnv = DBEnv Connection ```\n and let's say I have the interpreter:\n  runDBIO :: (IOE :> es, Error DBError :> es) => DBEnv -> Eff (DB : es) a -> Eff es a runDBIO env = interpret \\_ -> \\case ... do handling here ... \n Now the recommended way to instrument all of this is to wire up all of your effect handlers at the start of your program:\n  main = do env <- getDbEnv result <- runEff . runError @DBError . runDBIO env $ program case result of Left -> ... do something ... Right -> ... do something ... \n This all makes sense. But what if I want to handle the error at a deeper level in the program and not at the very top level? The Error DBError effect doesn't manifest in the type list until the runDBIO interpreter is applied. For example,\n  tryWriteDBOrSendEmailPage :: Item -> Eff [Email, DB] () tryWriteDBOrSendEmailPage item = do catchError (dbWrite item) $ \\_ e -> emailPage $ \"Something went wrong: \" ++ (show e) return () \n This doesn't work here because the type signature doesn't contain Error DBError, but the underlying implementation of DB uses it. If I add Error DBError to the effect list, wouldn't that be a totally separate effect from DB, so it wouldn't be able to throw and catch in the same context? Should I manually expose effects for TryDBWrite and TryDBRead that return an Either? Not exactly sure what to do here.\n    submitted by    /u/ryanworldorder  \n [link]   [comments]",

In the parts of our codebase that are written in TypeScript we use libraries like prisma and prisma-kysely to generate type definitions and the experience has been pretty good. \n Is there anything like this in the Haskell space?

I've also tried craziness like.\n ``` import Control.Concurrent.Async (concurrently_)\n handleSomething :: ActionM () handleSomething conn = do liftIO $ concurrently_ (liftIO $ longBackgroundIOStuff) (return (redirect \"/\")) ```\n But then the redirect never gets back to the client.\n I don't need to return anything related to the longBackgroundIOStuff, I just want it to start running in the background and keep running until it's done. \n Using express with node I could just do something like this:\n js app.get('/', (req, res) => { longAsyncIOFunction(); res.redirect('/') }); \n What would be the best way to accomplish this with Scotty?

It's capabilities are way beyond what I experienced back when I was last writing Haskell and has made it so much easier to quickly look up documentation and get autocomplete without having to scroll through hackage documentation for all of the functions and types that I forget.\n However, my experience using it with neovim has been less than stellar. I seem to have nothing but issues with it, and I can't tell if it's a neovim problem or an HLS problem. I'm using the haskell-tools.nvim plugin with the standard nvim-cmp and lspconfig plugins. Most other language servers work reasonably well, but this one seems particularly finicky and I can't figure out why.\n I'm currently having an issue where if I type anything for about 4-6 seconds after opening the first haskell file in the editor (while the language server is starting) it causes HLS to completely hang and become unresponsive. I'm also having issues with nvim-cmp screaming at me about misplaced dollar signs in snippets (I'm assuming because the haskell suggestions contain things like $ and $!).\n I decided to temporarily install vscode to see if that would do it. Everything worked completely flawlessly out of the box, absolutely no issues. The problem is, I would really rather not use vscode if I don't absolutely have to.\n Has anyone been able to get a working config for haskell in neovim that plays nice? I'm thinking of maybe scrapping haskell-tools and configuring things directly to see if that helps, otherwise I've spent so much time fiddling with the editor that I may have to leave it and come back later when things improve.\n    submitted by    /u/lucid00000  \n [link]   [comments]",

To have a computational effect, there must be function application involved, so it uses terms like functorial context, applicative effect and monadic effect.

For a variety of reasons I want to represent this with a composite of simple arrays, so for example an array of (a, b, c) would actually be structured as (array a, array b, array c). This is nice because zip- and unzip- like operations essentially become free. As I understand it, Data.Vector.Unboxed does something like this, although I don't get quite how it works. For this particular application Data.Vector.Unboxed is not suitable however as I'm making this array library specifically for an FFI which requires pinned memory.\n What I want to do is define composite types in a simliar way to how a value level list might be,\n comp = a:b:c:[] \n so that it can be transformed by applying a type level function to each element\n map f (a:b:c:[]) == f a:f b:f c:[] \n My current thinking is that it might be possible to express this type of transform on the type level somehow, but It's not clear to me how.\n The purpose of this would be to have a neat way to relate the element type to the array type, so I'd have something like\n CompArray (a <:> b <:> c <:> ()) ~ Array a <:> Array b <:> Array c <:> () \n Any ideas on how to express this, or is it not possible to do this kind of type level programming in Haskell?\n    submitted by    /u/FluxusMagna  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I'm trying to figure out the recommend workflow for writing a standalone haskell program. Say I want to write a single program in a file 'test.hs' that depends on modules not in the prelude. And I want to compile this into an executable. So I cannot simply complie this with `ghc test.hs`, since I will get the complaint that ghc cannot find the module I need.\n So what is the recommended work around? I know you can use cabal or stack to build a project and the specify dependencies in the .cabal file. But this seems heavy duty for a single haskell file. Specifically, using `cabal init` will create a directory `app`, the file `CHANGELOG.md`, and the .cabal file, just for this single haskell file. Further `cabal init` asks quite a lot, including asking about which license to use, leading me to believe `cabal init` is meant for much more heavy duty projects.\n Using stack has a similar amount of, if not more, overhead.\n tldr; Is using `cabal init` or `stack new` the best way to create a stand alone `.hs` file depend on hidden packages?

          "description": "I'm working my way through the excellent Crafting Interpreters book and decided to do the first part in Haskell instead of Java. Everything has been going swimmingly until we got to closures, which introduced a subtle problem involving variable shadowing. To fix this, the book introduces a semantic analysis pass where all the variables get resolved to their proper scope before any actual interpreting happens.\n This analysis pass uses a Map Expression Int, mapping from an expression to a location in the stack of scopes of the program where the variable can be found. In Java, because `Expression` is a separate object with its own object ID, this works out fine. In my Haskell version I have implemented Expression something like the following:\n data Expression = Grouping Expression\n | Unary UnaryOperation Expression\n | Binary BinaryOperation Expression Expression\n | Literal LiteralContents\n | Variable String\n | Assignment String Expression\n -- etc\n deriving (Show,Eq,Ord)\n This has worked very well so far, however it does introduce a problem with regards to the Map Expression Int: Any Variable \"abc\" will be considered equal, even if they come from very different nodes in the AST. The derived functions for Eq will not do here.\n What is the recommended way to solve this? So far I've come up with:\n  \nTry and fake the Java way of object equality by using `StablePtr` and friends, though that may not work too well with the (hash)map.\n Add a unique integer to every node in the AST to disambiguate them.\n Add the original source location to every Expression, so that different references to the same variable would be disambiguated by their source location. This feels a bit dirty though, since it would bleed implementation details from the scanner/parser into the interpreter.\n  \n   submitted by    /u/WJWH  \n [link]   [comments]",

For example, I can see how Yesod handles messages and keeps type safety. But not being able to add a new language or reword things without recompilng is more than a bit meh to my eye.\n In my current application, I'm looking at calendar definitions. I'd like to be able to have a file saying \"Pentecost is the 50th day after Easter Sunday. Easter Sunday is supposed to have a definition but it got messed up and it's now effectively an arbitary list of dates. Australia Day is on the 26th of January.\" etc. etc. and then, if I'm reading JSON and there is a named calendar, just get the calendar defintiion.

Link of the scotty-haxl code\n  \naddTimeline :: (HasPSQL u, HasOtherEnv Cache u) => String -> ID -> GenHaxl u w ID\n addTimeline name aid =\n unCacheArticle aid $ unCacheCount (\"timeline:\" ++ name) $ RawAPI.addTimeline name aid\n  \nAnd it was getting converted into IO like this:\n  \nscottyOptsT opts (runIO u state) $ application [logStdout]\n where runIO :: (HasPSQL u, HasOtherEnv C.Cache u) => u -> StateStore -> GenHaxl u w b -> IO b\n runIO env s m = do\n env0 <- initEnv s env\n runHaxl env0 m\n  \nI want to do similar thing with servant, but I didn't find any example.\n Also, I want to know what would be the best practice for handling haxl\n data fetching? getting the env from the reader and calling runHaxl within\n the handler function or runHaxl should be called at the `hoistServer` level?\n    submitted by    /u/Worldly_Dish_48  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Two dummy examples, both Scala 2.12. \n First example - sequence of Foo[t <: T], and I want some function to use that t somehow. Pseudocode-ish:\n ``` type A <: T type B <: T\n trait Foo[t <: T]\n object Foo1 extends Foo[A]\n objet Foo2 extends Foo[B]\n def someFunc[t <: T](foo: Foo[t]): Unit = { somethingThatKnowsHowToTakeTypes[t].foobar }\n Seq( Foo1, Foo2 ).map(someFunc) ```\n This leads to type erasure concerns, even though to me it seems obvious that that Sequence is of a type where each object inside is a Foo of some concrete type that fits the constraints. I can get around it by introducing some wrapper case class that I can stick Foo1 and Foo2 into, which retains it's type as an explicit member. And then inside someFunc I have to manually use that type member explicitly. Feels clunky and it feels like something I'm tricking the compiler into doing. Not to mention at some point I did get it to compile, only to fail at runtime if I didn't create the correct implicit typetag in scope.\n Second example:\n Sequence of (Foo[t <: T], Bar[t <: T]), and Bar/Foo have methods that operate on or return t <: T. I store in a 2-tuple because inside a lambda I want to do something like Foo.read(...).map(Bar.transform) where Foo.read returns something typed by t and Bar.transform takes something subtyped by t. I assume since I pair them up in a 2-tuple, the Seq of these such objects could recognize that it's some paired object, but instead the compiler complains about expected vs supplied types.\n    submitted by    /u/kebabmybob  \n [link]   [comments]",

When I got my first interview for a international remote job I had about 1.5 years of Scala experience, but 4 years total experience. I went pretty far but didn't get it because lack of experience. After that, I've had up to a dozen of these kinds of interviews, for a remote international team, but I never managed to get a job. Now finally I have found a new job but it is not a great project and not what I want.\n I am not the most enthusiastic person when it comes always being up to date and reading blogs and stuff and also for the past years, I have not been a person who got assigned to the more complex stuff in my company. Otherwise I have a pretty good basis for algorithms and coding challenges (although I failed the last one which was live coding using lots of Scala generics).\n Now, it seems to me that when recruiting for a remote team, especially for a senior position, the stands for a Scala developer are pretty high and the projects are not simple (relatively, like more distributed stuff).\n Does anyone have more insights how this compares to other languages. A lot of people that I know which I wold think were at my level as a developer or even sub, got remote jobs or jobs away from my country, and I am feeling stuck. I keep wondering if it would have been easier to find this kind of remote job if i stayed with C# or moved to Java, and not due to lack of opportunities in the Scala world....\n    submitted by    /u/PierreGargoyle  \n [link]   [comments]",

Is there any consensus in community how to tackle problem of auth? I found some abandoned JWT libs, and the ones that are maintained are fairly unpopular. I guess this is the problem when you want to use well known and battle tested solution so using some Java libs seems like a no brainer.

The stack I've been working with was the typelevel with tagless final so 90% of our code was in the functional style. I got an offer from one of my previous employers for a Senior Java role and as usual they are using the Java Spring enterprise stack. \n I'm considering the switch because of the better work-life balance, increased pay and more remote friendly. But what's making me doubt is Java. I haven't used Java (or any OOP language) in an production setting before and mainly throughout my career only used functional languages. Has anyone done a similar shift? Like moving from purely functional scala to Java EE style? And if so how was the adjustment? \n I did a quick read through some Spring code bases and it just seems like most of the work is just using the spring annotations correctly, which I don't really like since it's seems like doing \"config\" instead of actual coding.\n So anyone with any experience on making a similar switch and how that went? \n    submitted by    /u/lordGwynx7  \n [link]   [comments]",

Most of what I've found were refactoring or lining tools, and a few paid tools/services that would give me somewhat useful metrics. \n I reckon I could cobble something together that I could use but it would be a significant time investment. So, I figured I could ask the Scala community for recommendations before I start doing it myself. Any suggestions?\n P.S. The list of metrics that I'm interested in isn't that strict, but generally, it should be at least one of these metric sets: Maintainability Index, Halstead metrics, QMOOD metrics, MOOD metrics, and a few others.\n P.P.S. \"MetricsTree\" would be an ideal tool if it weren't capable of handling only Java source code. I thought about compiling scala code and then decompiling class files into Java source code but that can skew the metrics too much. \n    submitted by    /u/Plane-Objective-8856  \n [link]   [comments]",

To add, diffs show spaces and, its like mostly obvious which indentation level it is. If it isn't, you have indent rainbow, which trivializes tracking.\n Same story with merge conflicts - sometimes you would be able to get braces mismatch regardless, and its harder to fix than indentation mismatch. \n Well, now we have (), that are the second source of unpronouceable clutter, and [] which are, as well, in some places, yet not as common.

          "description": "Disclaimer: noob. I use org-mode and evil-mode extensively for notes and generally want text to wrapped at say 80 lines (easier readability, better use of screen-real estate when you're using a tiling window manager or a terminal multiplexer). For those who do something similar, looking for some advice:\n  \nFor wrapping text, can someone share a binding to toggle using text width of 80 and/off? Also useful to visually select text and set that to wrap at text width of 80 if you don't want the all text wrapped in the file. For the latter, I often visually select the text and use a binding for fill-region-as-paragraph but this joins paragraphs separated by a line. \n \nThis:\n  \nThis is some notes blah blah blah\n \n  \nlooks better than this\n - This is some notes blah blah blah \n , right? I find myself needing to manually adjust for the former--how to have it be done automatically?\n  \nDo you have wrap at column 80 for everything? I feel like if you have text at several indents deep, those lines are too short because they still get wrapped at column 80. I'm wondering if perhaps wrapping at 80 characters starting from first non-space character to the last character on the line might be better, but I'm not sure of any editors that allow for this behavior by default and in this case it would be better to stick with consistent behavior vs. some custom solution that might not cover all edge cases.\n  \nMuch appreciated.\n    submitted by    /u/immortal192  \n [link]   [comments]",

I think the presenter had either an Australian (or maybe Kiwi/Tassie) or South African accent.\n Any suggestions?\n Incidentally, I did ask ChatGPT for its input.

After a bit of trying out different configs I got it working with the OAuth 2.0 setup of my employer. \n Now I'm trying to actually use it, but I find it somewhat unexpected; perhaps that's because I have used org-gcal for a while and was expecting something similar, i.e. synchronizing of the calendar entries into an org file which can be linked to my org-agenda (and calfw).\n For example, a very frequent occurrence is to schedule meetings with other people (in person). This generally works by everybody looking at their calendar to find a spot in e.g. the next week where all of us are available. Is this possible with Excorporate? To me it seems it's only possible to check the calendar entries for a given day (via M-x calendar, moving to the date, pressing d or e), but not get a list of all the events, or all the events in a week/month. \n Furthermore, creating events seems to be possible via the API (https://github.com/emacsmirror/excorporate/blob/master/excorporate.info, chapter 6 API Usage), but this functionality is not exposed as an interactive function. Does that mean I have to write my own helper functions here?

          "description": "Hello fellow Emacs enthusiasts!\n I've noticed an interesting behavior difference between fill-paragraph in text-mode and org-fill-paragraph in org-mode, particularly when working with selected regions.\n Here's what I've observed:\n  \nIn text-mode, fill-paragraph respects the selected region and only operates within it.\n In org-mode, org-fill-paragraph doesn't seem to respect the selected region and operates on the entire paragraph.\n  \nI've created a GIF to illustrate this difference:\n https://i.redd.it/7trbpcthrqgd1.gif\n I initially thought this was a bug and submitted a report, but it was determined not to be one.\n I'd like to open this up for community discussion to get your thoughts and insights.\n In org-mode, the behavior remains the same whether a region is selected or not. When no region is selected, I believe this behavior is appropriate.\n However, the issue arises when a user explicitly selects a region, expecting the fill operation to be limited to that selection.\n I think org-fill-paragraph should respect the selected region, similar to how fill-paragraph works in text-mode.\n What do you think about this behavior?\n  \nUpdate: Now that I've reviewed the org-fill-paragraph function documentation again, I understand the current behavior.\n  \nThe REGION argument is non-nil if called interactively; in that\n case, if Transient Mark mode is enabled and the mark is active,\n fill each of the elements in the active region, instead of just\n filling the current element.\"\n  \nUnlike text-mode's fill-paragraph, org-fill-paragraph is designed to \"fill each of the elements in the active region.\"\n The current behavior seems to be explained by this information.\n Thank you for your opinions!\n    submitted by    /u/tttuuu888  \n [link]   [comments]",

It seems reddit has also signed some exclusive deal with Google allowing only Google to index it.\n \nThe way Reddit know handles blocking by other users. Sometime ago I began to notice that so many responses had some error like deleted and unavailable. Something I remarked on in this thread - Why do some reddit users especially on r/emacs keep messing up threads their involved by deleting their posts or making them unavailable? I don't see why some people should disrupt a technical discussion by blocking some participants who can't see what is going. It is not as though this Twitter or Facebook, this is simply a technical forum and the discussions don't often veer into the political. What kind of mindset does it take to block someone because you don't want them to read your views on technical issues, and it is not as though the person blocked cannot login using another account to see the thread?\n \n These two issues are making this forum less appealing.

I don't have much to go on but my assumption was that when the rust-analyzer was working or Rust LSP was communicating it was causing it to panic and crash but this was just an assumption and I was having trouble getting much out of --debug-init. This user was able to downgrade to version 29.3 and it solved their problems.\n Recently I've completely uninstalled rust, emacs and doom emacs and found wayland-emacs on the aur which I didn't notice last time. I've reinstalled Rust and now I'm going to attempt to install this AUR package and go from there. Another issue I was having was opening Fish shell in Doom Emacs with Term which wasn't an issue before until installing Rust.\n It's also important to note that I've had this Arch + Hyprland install for about 2 weeks and Doom Emacs hasn't given any issues what so ever until installing rust and rust-analyzer but also I upgraded around the same time and I know there was an upgrade 2 days ago. Thanks for reading, I wanted to try and be thorough so I apologize for the length of this.\n P.S The user on Arch I was talking about with a similar issue was using X11\n EDIT: solved, I use the pacaman package manager to uninstall emacs-wayland and installed emacs instead. So far rust hasn't crashed when editing or coding rs files in doom and rust-analayzer is working. Must install with rustup component add rust-analyzer though, not your package manager. and using vterm this time with no issues.. yet ;)\n    submitted by    /u/HaK_0ryX  \n [link]   [comments]",

I was thinking that having a single \"log buffer\" into which the messages would be written would prevent buffer spamming, and then I could just show the operator a different particular message in each window. Playing around with different things, trying to use indirect buffers with some sort of region narrowing seemed to be a good possible option.\n I didn't have much luck with this though:\n  (let ((org-dates (list \"2020-04-05\" \"2023-08-02\" \"2021-09-08\" \"2019-08-04\"))) (delete-other-windows) (split-window-right) (split-window-right) (split-window-right) (balance-windows) (dolist (earlier-journal-entry org-dates) (pop-to-buffer (make-indirect-buffer (get-buffer-create \"*Org Roam Daily Reflection Log*\") (generate-new-buffer-name \"*indirect*\"))) (let* ((start (point)) (org-msg (concat \"\\n\\n* No daily journal entry for \" earlier-journal-entry \".\"))) (insert org-msg) ;; (org-mode) (narrow-to-region start (point))))) \n In particular, the narrowing doesn't seem to work right.

I have tried several solutions, but they all are just solutions which means tabs will be filled with 'x' no of spaces. not tabs with TABS.

          "description": "I have quite a few projects and meeting and i keep track of them by using columnview dynamic block to show them in the project (each meeting has a property which points to the project and :match searches for the property). Columview has an option to add Links (so i just need to click on it and see what has been discussed). But this link feature doesnt work if the item are in a different file. \n So when capturing a meeting with org-capture i just created another property like:\n :LINK: [[file:~/org/meetings.org::*%\\1][%\\1]]\n which is essentially a link to itself, where %\\1 is the Meeting Title and the org headline and add this Property to the columnview. That way i can click on it form a project and see what the meeting was about.\n Now the Problem: the headline might not be unique (e.g. weekly repeating meeting) and there for i thought it might be a better idea to use a custom_id for example. So i tried to use a capture template like this:\n * %^{Meeting}\n :PROPERTIES:\n :PROJECT:\n :ATTENDEE:\n :LINK: [[file:~/org/meetings.org::*%\\1][%\\1]\n :CUSTOM_ID: %<%Y%m%d%H%M%S>-%(string-replace \" \" \"-\" \"%\\\\1\")\n :LINK2: [[id:%<%Y%m%d%H%M%S>-%(replace-regexp-in-string \"\\s\" \"-\" \"%\\\\1\")][%\\1]]\n :ID: %(org-id-new)\n :END:\n I try to replace the whitespace in the headline as this would be no valid ID. But that doesnt work it gets evaluated but the whitespaces are not replaced. i could reuse :ID: aswell but dont know how in a capture template.

I'm writing both python and rust, and my issue is that when I select a completion for a function name or class, it always puts opening and closing parenthesis after it, automatically. Meaning, I type:\n my_obj.beginning_of_metho\n and it (corfu) gives me the option:\n beginning_of_method\n I select it, and what it inserts is:\n my_obj.beginning_of_method(argname1, argname2)\n Which is right 80% of the time, and infuriating that 20% of the time that I needed to pass that bare function somewhere. Its more annoying with class names, it puts parens in when I'm just trying to make a type hint. \n I've seen this behavior with rust-analyzer, jedi-language-server and pyright, so I don't think its server specific, and I've seen it with lsp-mode and eglot so I don't think its specific to those modes. I'm using corfu, but I haven't figured out a switch in corfu to change this behavior.\n The ideal behavior in my opinion would be when I select the method name, it inserts just that:\n my_obj.beginning_of_method\n And then if I type an open paren\n my_obj.beginning_of_method(\n At that point it would insert the args with the closing paren.\n my_obj.beginning_of_method(argname1, argname2)\n Has anyone else figured out how to do this?

I used it years ago, then I forgot about it for a while, and recently came back.\n So I was wondering about the current best way to filter the posts by tags, so that I can focus on specific groups of posts instead of the entire stream. I was looking at Mike Zemansky's approach to filter the posts using a hydra and a macro. It looks pretty good, and I was working towards that. However, I realized that this approach was 7 years old. \n Hence, I was wondering if there are any better or improved ways to filter posts today, that were not referenced in Mike Zemansky's post? I believe in his code, emacs looks for all unique tags in the total feed, defines shortcut or hydra keys, and finally creates a hydra that the user can use to search for those posts. So it seems simple and nice. \n But as I said, I was not sure if there was a package to do this now, or do I have to write that code myself in my `.spacemacs` file.

This is acheived by changing the text properties of the code with the spaces taken from the formatted code.\n This can be useful when working in a team and the codebase is poorly formatted, or when you don't like the coding style and you want to view the code in the style you like.\n This can be seen as an ~equivalent~ to Resharper's Virtual Formatter, which I just heard about when I started working on this package, but never used it actually.\n The current implementation requires treesit, so you will need Emacs 29+ with Tree Sitter support.\n https://github.com/abougouffa/virtual-format\n Examples\n Original code\n before\n Visually formatted\n after\n Looking forward for your feedback!\n    submitted by    /u/abougouffa  \n [link]   [comments]",

I take care to kill the buffer on each iteration, but it doesn't seem to matter. But! If I let a function process only 500 files, then finish, then run it again for the next 500 and so on, it works out.

It's easy to use, automatic history and off device. But how do you deal with Personal Information in your Notes? Some of it might not be particularly interesting, but when you start using Due Dates and make Tasks on where to go, or whome you interact with, this could be different. Maybe you take a reminder to pick up some medication specific to a Illness you have.\n This might be even more of a problem if you use Org notes at work. Certainly most companies wouldn't want you to commit customer data to github/lab.\n So, how do you deal with this? So far the obvious thing is to keep Notes that are work related in their own folder and either not sync that or keep it on our own hosted gitlab instance.\n With personal notes this is a tougher call. I want them on two PCs and my phone. My experience with Syncthing over three devices in the past has been less than stelar. Any other recommendations that work reliably so i can finally leave google keep and todoist behind?

          "description": "I have two Linux computers and a Windows computer. I use Emacs on all of them. \n I've been looking for at handy way to share the Emacs configuration file between the computers. The basic step consists in letting the .emacs file on each computer load a common configuration file from a shared directory in Dropbox. With this in place, if I make a customization change on one computer, it is automatically available to the others.\n At least in theory.\n The challenge is that this sharing of a configuration file causes a lot of problems, because in many cases I want different configurations on the three computers. For example:\n  \nPath names to files will be different on my Linux and Windows computer.\n Font names are different.\n I have some project-specific configuration for a project that exists on one computer, but not on the others.\n  \nAlso, if I install a new Emacs package on one computer, it will not get automatically installed on the others, and this may cause configuration problems.\n All of this can be solved by a very strict discipline about what goes where in various configuration files. But what I'd really like to know is this: Has any of you successfully created such a setup that actually works very well? If so, what insight can you share?\n    submitted by    /u/oz1cz  \n [link]   [comments]",

A perspective is an independent workspace for Emacs, similar to multiple desktops in Gnome and MacOS. This integration allows you to easily know which project you're currently in, and focus on files that only belong to the current project when switching buffers.\n ⚠️ NOTE: This package has come to life adapting the great package persp-projectile by Bozhidar Batsov with ChatGPT. I didn't write a single line of code. What inspired me to create this package is my recent effort to avoid most third party packages, specially if they prefer a newly defined interface over the built-in Emacs interface.\n Also special shutout to Natalie Weizenbaum for making such a great package!\n I would appreciate any feedback, I'll try to submit the package to MELPA next.\n https://youtube.com/watch?v=CkiKLR7B634&feature=shared\n  \nIf this post reminds you of another, its NOT a mere coincidence.

          "description": "I've posted about the ekg notetaking app for emacs before. After a brief hiatus, I'm back working on it, and I'm pretty excited about the latest changes.\n A few weeks ago I also put out a new version of llm with a new module, llm-prompt, which allows templatized prompts that have easy and effective context filling, something that hasn't existed yet in any emacs module, AFAIK. The new version of ekg uses this new feature.\n Previously, the ekg-llm library would send the contents of the note, along with instructions to the LLM, which would then append to the note. Now, we also send the latest notes with the same tags, and similar notes, as part of the llm request context. This turns out to be a really important enhancement to the quality of the llm responses, and now using ekg is, IMHO, the best way to interact with LLMs. You can also edit the responses before you save them into a note (or just not save them at all). This is something else that can help improve the response quality. At times, the responses I'm getting are really magical - it really is what many people call a \"second brain\", but for real. I find myself using it constantly as a default way to interact with LLMs.\n I give an intro to ekg and talk about using it as a \"second brain\" in this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC_h3syRKro\n The other improvements to this version of ekg are primarily Markdown improvements (using markdown instead of org-mode is kind of necessary if you are using it to talk to llms), fixing issues and getting inline links to work.\n    submitted by    /u/ahyatt  \n [link]   [comments]",

The default is ivy--regex-plus.\n Now, it's not like Ivy is not matching the command, but it's definitely not in the top results.

And indeed, it works just fine for regular text buffers. However, I was saddened to find out it doesn't seem to work with VTERM, my terminal emulator of choice within emacs.\n Is there another mode I have failed to find?

Thanks!\n PD: To anyone who might say it might be silly to start on this if I'm new to elisp, it's the way I like to learn, doing and improving as I go, most often times it works pretty well, but in this case I'm lost as to where to start.\n Edit: I'm looking for resources, other than the Elisp manual, which is the only thing I'm currently reading but I don't know if reading the manual top to bottom will point me in the right direction, thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/Agreeable-Item-675  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I am entering my senior year of my BSc. in Data Science (primarily use R and python). I first learned about Emacs my freshman year and was intrigued by the potential -- keyboard-focused, modularity, customization, etc. I started using and configuring vanilla Emacs as my \"daily driver\" about 18mo ago. Within the last 6mo I have used `org-agenda` to organize my schedule, Jupyter notebooks for class assignments, and record most* of my notes using `denote` (*need to spend some time configuring latex for math notes). \n This summer, I completed a Data Science internship at a medium-ish sized tech company. Although most of my classwork is in Jupyter notebooks, the dev team discourages the use of notebooks. Experiments are mostly organized in python files but it does seem that others still use Jupyter notebooks to tinker with code snippets or intermediate plotting. All development is done remotely across a number of servers and docker containers.\n Needless to say, my \"little\" Emacs configuration was not up to the task. The jump from using Emacs for my homework assignments to fleshing out a reliable IDE that I can be used on the job is overwhelming. I struggle to envision how I would make that jump. I am aware of `tramp` and `lsp-bridge`, for example, but have read a lot of complaints about latency or `magit` being slow. Alternatively, one could install Emacs on given server ... but how common is it that companies allow you to do that? \n For those that use Emacs professionally: How do you use Emacs at your company? Do you run Emacs locally but develop over tramp, what is that experience like? If not, does your company allow you to install Emacs on a server? \n    submitted by    /u/Impossible_Win_9059  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Recently I found out that Emacs can deal with so-called noncontiguous regions. I cannot find very much information about these on the internet, the Emacs manual or the Emacs help system. But I'm curious about these noncontiguous regions and want to see if I can use them for something. As an example, something I want to do is to narrow to a noncontiguous region. But to be clear, narrowing to a noncontiguous region is not the problem I want solved here. I just want to learn how to use noncontiguous regions. \n I'll try to define a clear question. If I want to create a noncontiguous region that contains the columns 4 to 7 on rows 1 and 2 then I can do this using a rectangular region(at least interactively, but I imagine I can recreate that in elisp too). But what if I want to create a noncontiguous region containing columns 4 to 7 on lines 1 and 3 but not line 2. Then I cannot use rectangular regions(as far as I know). Is there a way to do this? I'm not necessarily asking for an interactive way to do it. An elisp solution is fine and even prefered. \n I've found the variable region-extract-function that perhaps could be useful, but I'm not sure how to use it. In particular, I don't know when the function that this variable is bound to is called. \n I also found the library zones.el. But from the documentation it seems like it doesn't actually define noncontiguous regions, just something that looks and feels like noncontiguous regions. So this doesn't really satisfy my curiosity. And I'm mainly interested in learning the builtin functionality, so a third party package like this isn't really what I'm looking for.\n    submitted by    /u/objective_porpoise  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I understand the title may be vague or nonsensical. But I had to make one, and that was the best I could come up with. A longer version of my question follows.\n I am an amateur Emacsist. I've got a solid understanding of all things *nix, lisp, and configuring a text editor (from prior vim experience). I've been eagerly building up a very comfortable .emacs for the past few months, and have been loving the experience in general. However, there is one thing that bothers me which I don't believe bothers others as much, if not at all: When I try to use some package that adds to or modifies the fundamental Emacs experience — something that modifies things like buffer management, text editing or whatnot — it often clashes with my own previous customizations or even default Emacs behavior. \n For instance, If I were to use a modal editing package like Evil mode, I'd need to rebind keys to work correctly for every package I added. Think Magit for instance. Another time I faced a similar issue was when I tried popper.el. It's a great package, but It's job is to augment default buffer-handing behavior. I often ran into issues where a buffer created by a function from one package ended up in the wrong place due to popper. This is not a devastating problem as I could always just place the buffer where I want it manually, but that's the point, sort of. \n I have a very large config, and adding anything that changes the fundamental experience of Emacs becomes a software project of its own with the involvement of design, and large refactors and whatnot. I wonder if that's the case with you guys.\n Does anyone else have the same experience? Is this something I just have to settle for and solve bottom-up by solving the problems as they arise?

For example, when editing a React typescript component, if i just hit <TAB>, or create a new line, it indents 4 spaces from the last line. But if I highlight the region and hit <TAB> then it seems to indent based on LSP rules and indents it by 2.\n The same is true when I'm in C++ mode. While writing, and hitting tab when I'm on the line, I get the following header:\n #pragma once namespace some_name_space { class SomeClass { public: SomeClass() private: int someMember; } } \n But if I highlight the buffer and hit <TAB>, or call lsp-format-region, then I end up with:\n #pragma once namespace some_name_space { class SomeClass { public: SomeClass(); private: int someMember; } } // namespace some_name_space \n Which i assume is different because when I do that, it's calling clang-format (based on the fact that the endspace ending comment get added.)\n Is there a way to make it so that indentations will use lsp to formatting rules if lsp mode is enabled?\n    submitted by    /u/Faleira  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi folks,\n I've been searching for a package that enables the simple \"one tab per project\" workflow, so each project is isolated in its tab.\n I used tabspaces for some time but I faced several issues with it. Then, I switched to the more lightweight project-tab-groups which creates a \"tab group\" per project, but with some limitations. The latter was simple enough to inspire me to create the package I'm looking for, one-tab-per-project (or otpp).\n The idea is simple, install the package and its dependency unique-dir-name (another package of mine, created specifically for otpp), enable otpp-mode and you are good to go. Whenever you switched to a project project-switch-project (C-x p p), otpp will switch to a dedicated tab. And in case of conflicting projects names, otpp will resolve the conflict by renaming the similar tabs.\n  \nhttps://github.com/abougouffa/one-tab-per-project\n https://github.com/abougouffa/unique-dir-name\n  \nLooking for your feedback!\n    submitted by    /u/abougouffa  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I'm currently working on taking more effective notes using the Zettelkasten method and have encountered a challenge when dealing with claims attributed to secondary sources.\nFor example, academic articles typically contain numerous references to outside sources. Many of the claims discussed are not original but rather derived from these secondary sources.\nMy struggle is with how to properly document these secondary claims in my notes when I'm unfamiliar with the sources being referenced. I feel uncomfortable directly citing them. However, these claims are often relevant and interesting, and I want to include them in my Zettelkasten for future reference.\nHere are some questions I have:\nHow do you approach taking notes on claims that are attributed to secondary sources when using the Zettelkasten method?\nDo you cite the original source, the secondary source, or both in your notes?\nHow do you ensure accuracy and avoid misinterpretation when you're not directly familiar with the primary source?\nAny strategies for efficiently exploring the primary sources when they seem particularly crucial to your understanding of the topic?\nI’d appreciate any advice or strategies that have worked for you when navigating this aspect of academic note-taking. Thanks in advance!",

The promise of data ownership and flexibility was alluring. However, as time passed, I found myself gravitating back to cloud-based solutions.\nNow, I'm feeling the pull towards local files and Markdown again. It's as if I'm caught in a perpetual swing between the convenience of the cloud and the freedom of local storage.\nThis pattern has me wondering:\nIs this back-and-forth between local-first and cloud-based systems common in the PKM community?\nFor those who've made multiple switches, what ultimately made you settle on one approach (if you have)?\nAre there solutions that effectively bridge this gap, offering the best of both worlds?\nHow do others manage the trade-offs between sync convenience and data sovereignty?\nI'm starting to think this isn't just a fleeting concern, but a fundamental tension in how we approach PKM. The desire for true ownership of our data and the freedom to use multiple tools seems to persist, even after trying various solutions.\nHas anyone else found themselves in this PKM pendulum? How have you reconciled these competing needs in your own systems?",

          "description": "Working with my Zettelkasten constantly evolves, as my needs change over time. It seems to be an endless journey to improve my personal knowledge management system. By chance, I discovered \"Wardley Mapping\" by Simon Wardley [1]. It's a method for understanding how to develop your strategies. My first idea to learn more about this visual tool was to apply it to my Zettelkasten strategy.\nLet's take a closer look. A Wardley map allows us to visualize the **Evolution **of business components over time. It starts from the unstable beginnings to more stable, standardized components. These components fall into four stages: genesis, custom, product, and commodity.\nFirst: Genesis components are novel and new. Second: Custom components exist for a specific use case with some proof of value. Third: P…",

The major change was my first contact with the Zettelkasten framework (2). It was hard for me to change my personal organization from thinking in \"folders\" to \"tagging\" (3). My current challenge is to use analytical reading to improve my notes (4).\nWhat will the next steps be? What are your recommendations?\nReferences\nhttps://learnwardleymapping.com/book/.",

Struggled as to what category to put this under - I guess it pertains to workflow, writing and the zettelkasten method more broadly...\nI'm a PhD candidate and (inconsistently) use techniques shared here to organise my notes and ideas. It's been a slow burn for me, but more and more I'm seeing the potential benefits of the zettelkasten approach. But I had a question about dealing with the messiness of writing over the long term alongside note-taking in the zettelkasten.\nI'll try and give a specific example. I'm currently working on one chapter of my thesis. I'm going through a literature note for something that I read for this chapter, and I'm seeing ideas that could be worthy to turn into their own seperate notes/zettels, and I could see potential use for them in a specific ch…",
