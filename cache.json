You can define a function that takes Void, but you can never call it. To call it, you would have to provide a value of the type Void, and there just aren’t any. As for what this function can return, there are no restrictions whatsoever. It can return any type (although it never will, because it can’t be called).\n  \nThen it proceeds to explain that a singleton set is actually type ()\n This doesn't make sense to me - why isn't a function that is the equivalent of { return 32 } the same as a morphism mapping an empty set to a non-empty set? And why can't you call a function whose argument is the equivalent of an empty set? And finally, how is () the equivalent of a set with a single member?\n UPDATE: While typing this, I think it finally clicked - still looking for confirmation. An Empty set can only map to an Empty set because there are no elements to transform. Which is why () is some universal element because it implies that you can map a set with one thing to any one other thing. Is this right?\n    submitted by    /u/RoboZoomDax  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "So for the purposes of my final year project I'm writing a non-deterministic language by Haskell for the purposes of learning Haskell and to understand language design! Non-determinism in the language arises in the presence of control flow for example : n := 0 Do (n < 10)-> if P.x -> S [] Q.x -> R fi Od So if any of the guards (P.x,Q.x) are True then their statements S,R can be carried out. The caveat here however is that both of the guards could be evaluated to True which means both statements have to be executed. The branch taken that finishes first however is the branch which ultimately gives the final result so for example if the two guards where checking if n is an even number and if n was less than say five then both branches would have to be taken. ​ After just completing a class on Parallel Computing, my first thought was to use threads but then I came across numerous articles and blogs about how the List Monad can handle non-determinism. ​ So my two approaches where to either use threads which I do have some experience with or to see if the List Monad could actually work. I'm inclined to use threads given that each branch obtains its own instance of the program therefore it would make sense to use them but I am quite aware that Haskell‍ is more or less magic so I figured there's probably another way to achieve the effect I desire. ​ Could something along the lines Lisp's amb be of any use? I found the Haskell implementation https://wiki.haskell.org/Amb but it appears to generally be used for more trivial programs than anything else. ​ My apologies if this post isn't allowed, was just looking to rubberduck a bit\n    submitted by    /u/sharctic03  \n [link]   [comments]",

Also it fixes annoying issue in copyright year updater feature and finally makes headroom fully compilable with GHC 9 (9.0.2 or newer).\n In case you never heard of headroom - it's small command line utility that manages license/copyright headers in your source code files. All needed is to create Markdown templates for license/copyright, fill-in some variables and that's it. It can also do some nice stuff like above mentioned feature that updates years in copyrights for you. Also some languages have extended support, where for example in Java/Scala/Kotlin files you can use class package name as template variable, and in Haskell it can even extract and reuse variables from whole Haddock module header. This release also automatically checks for new versions once per week and notifies user to command line (using this GitHub REST API) - no data collection or telemetry bullshit is happening), but if you don't like it, it can be easily disabled in configuration.\n Headroom is already few years out, but I'm always happy to hear ideas about new features or improvements, feel free to open new issue or PR in such case.\n    submitted by    /u/xwinus  \n [link]   [comments]",

If we were to use TVar on chatHistory, we have the following:\n updateChatHistory :: TVar (Seq Message) -> Message -> STM () \n But what if we wanted to operate on ChatSession itself? Then we could have\n updateChatHistory :: TVar ChatSession -> Message -> STM () \n Where inside it, the actually appending of a Message to the chatHistory remains a pure operation on Seq.\n Which of the two makes more sense? To make a more general question, I guess, should I split my data structure among multiple TVar's, or have the entire data structure be a TVar where mutations to individual fields remain pure?\n I'm still a beginner, so please let me know if I'm not using correct terminologies here and there.

I'm not convinced about the sequenceA usage, put it there to typecheck and be able to write my constraint.\n I also tried another approach where I traverse the Map, trying to put a constraint on each cell, but I don't manage to insert a variable into the different 3 constraints (rows, columns, square).\n My conclusion is I don't understand the library usage, how would you solve this kind of problem?\n    submitted by    /u/jjeeb  \n [link]   [comments]",

Based on the revenue from the business right now, I can pay a salary of $2k/month USD full time.\n My questions:\n  \nWhat kind of talent do you think I can get at that salary level?\n Do you think it would be better to hire and train now or hire at a later stage once the user base is larger and I can afford a higher salary?\n Where would you look for devs? Any general tips?\n  \nEither way, depending on the experience of the dev, I'd bump up the salary as the app continues to acquire more users.\n I appreciate any input and feedback :)\n EDIT #1\n  \nI'm talking $2k USD per month.\n I'd be willing to modify the contract so the dev can have a much higher upside if the business is successful - something on the lines of high bonuses on milestones, or some kind of profit sharing.\n My eventual goal is to pay the best and most competitive salaries in the industry.\n  \n   submitted by    /u/SkeetSk8r  \n [link]   [comments]",

It can be achieved without newtype wrapping or having orphan instances, using the DerivingVia GHC extension:\n newtype SqlUUID a = MkSqlUUID a instance (a ~ UUID) => FromField a where fromField field = ... -- The definition is not really interesting, same as you would write for a UUID minus the MkSqlUUID wrapping instance (a ~ UUID) => ToField a where toField (MkSqlUUID uuid) = ... -- Again, not really interesting -- In another module: newtype UserId = MkUserId UUID deriving FromField via (SqlUUID UUID) deriving ToField via (SqlUUID UUID) \n I've tested this and it seems to work but I'm not a very experienced haskell so there might be some downsides/pitfalls using this method that I'm not aware of. Let me know what you think :)\n Edit: probably should've been more clear. It doesn't solve the orphan instances problem in general but previously I needed an orphan FromField UUID and ToField UUID so I can do deriving FromField for my UserId type.\n    submitted by    /u/Actual_Ad4965  \n [link]   [comments]",

It took me about 2 months of mostly consistent effort.\n I really liked a lot of the concepts I've grokked from this little adventure; the chapters from monoids through monad transformers in particular showed me a new, very different level of abstraction with which I could think through common programming problems in the future.\n What I haven't done is make any big contributions or study what the job ecosystem looks like yet. Someone just recommended if I wanted to start programming right I should work through this book, and I had a few months of downtime between finishing my degree and starting the job search, so I did it.\n So the only question I have left is: What's next?

At the risk of being a cliché, I'm, ehem, starting a youtube channel:\n https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiaFQ7p683Dr-oXMdUGRLHA/videos\n The main idea of this channel is to teach FP/Haskell by analogy instead of first principle.

Here is a screenshot:\n https://imgur.com/a/EeN4vW9\n I would say that autocomplete is essential when authoring HTML with Tailwind because otherwise you have to keep referring to the cheat sheet, and if you make a typo or attempt a sizing that doesn't exist then there is no type safety to tell you.\n And info hovers are also useful for reading code because it shows you the actual CSS for each class (otherwise you again have to refer to the cheat sheet all the time or memorize all of the tailwind classes).\n Instructions:\n First install the tailwind extension for VS Code: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss\n Then you will need to create a tailwind.config.js file. You can use this:\n module.exports = { content: [\"./src/**/*.hs\"], theme: { extend: {}, }, plugins: [], }; \n In order for the VS Code extension to work, it seems that it needs a local/project install of tailwind and postcss, so you can run this:\n $ npm init $ npm install tailwindcss $ npm install postcss \n Finally, the crucial step: in your VS Code settings.json add these two settings to configure the extension:\n  \"tailwindCSS.includeLanguages\": { \"haskell\": \"html\" }, \"tailwindCSS.experimental.classRegex\": [ \"class_ \\\"([^\\\"]*)\" ], \n I believe that the above regex should also work if you are using blaze-html instead of Lucid (but I have not tested it).\n Good luck! \n Btw, here is an additional repo I found with info on Tailwind CSS in Haskell: https://github.com/obsidiansystems/obelisk-tailwind-example\n    submitted by    /u/bitconnor  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'd definitely appreciate if I could, say, dynamically compile and link these scripts for maximum performance, and have the scripting language just be Haskell. A core principal of this engine is that you may have multiple instances of a game being managed by the same process (for example, a server and client being run simultaneously, multiple servers, some of which might have different scripts, etc).

It feels strange for correctness oriented language. I've looked at functions in Data.List and 4 out of 5 functions taking integer parameters (replicate, take, drop, splitAt) are actually doing n' = max n 0 with their argument, and only one ((!!)) throws an error with negative argument. In Data.Vector a ton of functions is taking integer parameters, and I've checked only the analogs of functions from Data.List and they behave the same (indexing throws, while other functions have this \"wrap to 0\" behavior for negative values).\n Isn't it sweeping problems under the rug?

For example, what I thought was an innocent question turned out to be my latest rabbit hole, i.e. apparently Haskell doesn't have real recursive types. Apparently, what I thought was a recursive type, e.g.\n data Peano = Zero | Succ Peano \n is not really a recursive type, although I'm not sure why. My previous question about what turned out to be the omega combinator brought up the true nature of Haskell recursive types and the mysterious newtype \"workaround\". So this talks about a real natural number recursive type (as does my previous question)\n MyNat = One :+: MyNat \n MyList a = One :+: (a :*: MyList a)\n I can't truly fathom what's being done/said here, e.g., no idea what is meant first paragraph in by a typed tagless-final interpreter. Simple blind acceptance, which is just hand-waving, isn't my style. And the logic programming course it references is, well, my latest rabbit hole. Can somebody give me some intro material to this whole issue of what really is a recursive type. This all started, BTW, with trying to understand what a type equation meant. Can you guess how many pdfs and web pages I've opened since then? Fazit: Somebody (me?) needs to pull all these threads together into one big Haskell-Omni textbook. The existing beginner texts are too handwavy, IMHO. There's a kiddie version of Haskell and a grownup's version. The kiddie version is pretty much useless, again, IMHO, unless it's to spur you on to the bigger stuff.\n    submitted by    /u/teilchen010  \n [link]   [comments]",

If anyone wants to help a complete newcomer, I could really use it.\n I've read some monad tutorials/lectures and I think I have a beginner's understanding. Basically what I took away was \"without unsafePerformIO, which you should not use, Monad types like M a can't be converted to a. Instead you compose your Monad functions with pure functions using operators like <$> or >>=.\" I also think I understand this distinction between \"pure\" and \"monad\" functions helps the haskell compiler be extremely cool.\n That sounds really good, but I'm having trouble understanding how to structure an application around this. I'm trying to teach myself Haskell by writing an interactive fiction game. So far I have an RPG-style dice roller written, but it's deterministic. I'm creating a seed from the system time inside of a do, using the <- operator. I then use (basically) randomRs (_,_) (mkStdGen seed). Because I used do and I wasn't sure what to do after that though, so I tried using unsafePerformIO and I'm almost certain this is why my dice roller rolls the same numbers every time.\n Do I have to make all my roll-processing functions and the entire skill system speak IO Int and pass up and down an updated stdGen? I am pretty sure the answer is \"no,\" since I can use bind to invoke pure functions. But if that's true, I'm not sure how to apply that while designing a whole application.\n I guess what I'm unsure of is how to structure something larger than a few functions around all of this.

To do so, I intend to prepare a minimal case that reproduces the issue on the compiler version that the GHC developers would most prefer. I'm having trouble doing that though:\n 1) Which is the GHC version that would be the most useful for GHC developers? 8.10.7, the one the majority of the users currently use (me included)? 9.2.1 which is the latest stable release? Or GHC HEAD? \n 2) Unless the answer to (1) above is GHC 8.10.7, what's the easiest way to obtain that GHC version, very preferably without polluting my system globally? I've built GHC HEAD using the great nix-shell provided by https://github.com/alpmestan/ghc.nix, which allowed me to build it without installing any system dependencies globally. But I can't figure out how to run the resulting GHC, I have ./inplace/bin/runghc which I can use to interpret .hs files and I have ./inplace/bin/ghc-stage2, but that one results in a billion linker errors when I try to compile anything. I've also tried installing GHC versions via ghcup, but that one also fails because I think I'm supposed to install some system dependencies, but I really don't like doing that if at all possible.\n It might be a good idea to update the report a bug page in the GHC wiki with this information. This subreddit is probably not the best place to ask these questions, but I'm also not sure where best to engage with the GHC developers.\n Thanks for any pointers!\n    submitted by    /u/enobayram  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Most developers choose the path of least resistance. Effect systems are not low resistance and its very hard for experienced functional programmers to explain why its so great. Even ZIO that makes it a little bit more straight forward is still a huge leap from where most programmers are. \n Compare this to say Rust. Rust requires more from the programmers but the rules around borrowing and lifetimes are relativly easy to understand it takes a while to learn fully. But the motivation is there because its performance and its measurable. Do you want your programms to be 2x+ fast then writ it in Rust.\n Effects systems are very abstract concepts. First that you are describing a program in a program. Then the notion that non purity is bad. Monads, functors etc. There is alot to understand because in the long run you need to understand them.\n I'm currently learning and I like it. Not that I'm fully aware of all benefits but I like learning. \n When I look at the majority of programmers that I have worked with. They like their job and they program in whatever language they happened to end up with and very few wants to invest in learning a whole new paradigm. It's so hard to get developers to let go of Java 8 some times. Most Java developers have probably never used records in Java. \n So what am I getting to. I don't know actually :-D just something I have been thinking about. \n What do you think. Can effect systems ever be mainstream? I can't really see it ever happening if most developers doesn't suddenly become super interested in learning new stuff.\n Also if you believe it can go mainstream how us it going to happen?\n    submitted by    /u/0OOO00000OO00O0O0OOO  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "For my case, i recently re-implemented an old Go code of an event gateway rest API with Scala + Akka HTTP. The reason is that we are a data engineering team, and none of us are familiar with Golang stack. We re-code it to improve maintainability.\n The logic is extremely simple, the HTTP server just listens for POST requests, based on the extract the payload in raw bytes and forward to Kafka. There are mappings of 1:1 between the URI and Kafka topic so that we know where to forward the events, something like https://blah.com/api/v1/app_events -> app_events Kafka topic. These mappings are fixed and provisioned from a config file.\n Previously, with the Go (Gin) version, with 1 Core, we are able to reach 2.5K RPS. Now, with the Akka HTTP version, we could not go higher than 1.1K RPS.\n The Akka HTTP version is 10.2.7.\n Initially, we thought It could be the Kafka producer that slows the server down, but it wasn't, without the Kafka producer, RPS did not improve.\n Is this a valid outcome? That we have to accept that Go(Gin) is >2x faster than Akka HTTP?\n ==== Updated =====\n I was just performed another loadtest because I suspected at my usage of optionalHeaderValueByName directive. This time, I held down the CCU setting from Locust side to 500 as I wanted to see how much CPU it cost in each case.\n  \nWith optionalHeaderValueByName: cost ~ 380m CPU.\n Without optionalHeaderValueByName: cost ~ 270m CPU.\n  \nThis turned out the header extraction directive contributes significantly to CPU cost.\n Source code: https://www.reddit.com/r/Akka/comments/s7fcur/comment/htazqaa/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3\n    submitted by    /u/misurin  \n [link]   [comments]",

(For those unfamiliar, macros generate code which takes care of serializing/unserializing arguments using upickle or boopickle or whatnot, and gives you a nice typesafe API to call back into your app without the usual ajax boilerplate).\n I would like to upgrade to Scala 3 and it seems the blockers for me are these heavily macro-based autowiring libraries. Boopickle seems to support Scala 3 by now (though not chameleon which sloth uses to abstract away boopickle).\n Since Scala 3 should enable this kind of functionality without the headache inducing macro code required on 2.x, what would people recommend as a Scala 3 solution for client-service communications, with as little boilerplate as possible, and ideally using boopickle (it's much smaller than the equivalent json and I like the obfuscation) ?\n It's all Scala front-to-back, no need to care about any other language or format, and I'm not opposed to switching it all out in order to move to Scala 3.\n Thank you for any suggestions.\n    submitted by    /u/androidthepandroid  \n [link]   [comments]",

Now, I do everything on my laptop (Thinkpad with OK specs), because I like to use ssh to a FreeBSD VM and use raw Vim, and when the VM is local it doesn't care about network interruptions or a wonky ISP. I like a normal SSH session because of the scroll history, and I like to use i3wm to lay out and manage terminals and using mosh or something would require tmux which I find more awkward.\n If I try out a high-end server just to compare compilation times, it's more than twice as fast. How to take advantage of that?\n Is there something like a distcc for SBT, or another way to leverage remote CPU power? Even if I have to put it in my local network?

To demonstrate this, I took the http4s g8 template, set it up with Scala 3.1.0, added sbt native-image, started the nativeImageRunAgent and ran a single request against GET /joke. After stopping the server, the native-image run agent generated the reflective configs that are required for this path of execution.

          "description": "So I see that Lightbend is investing heavily in Akka (and Akka Serverless). I also noticed the hype around Akka for .Net. However, my experience with Akka has been one of a somewhat struggle and I am curious to know if things have changed in the last few years.\n My (only) attempt with Akka was 3-4 years ago when I wrote a web-service based on it. I remember how some things that would have been trivial if carried out with Future/Cats-effect/ZIO required quite a lot of coding in Akka. Two examples that I can think of:\n Concurrent requests:\n Some requests to the service required gathering information from several different actors asynchronously before returning a response. This required me to follow the \"Aggregator Pattern\": Sending the requests to the relevant actors and then changing context to accumulate (and keep track of) the responses . If I wanted to add an optional timeout I also had to set a timer with a Timeout message and cancel it once all responses arrived. It felt to me like this could have been more easily carried out with a Future.sequence(...) (if timeout is not necessary) or with parTraverse(...)/foreachPar(...) (Cats-effect/ZIO) with an optional .timeout(...) setting.\n Asynchronous execution:\n I many cases I found out that some synchronous tasks took longer than I initially thought, hurting my actor's responsiveness. However - if I decided to make those tasks asynchronous I had to write a new actor specifically for them. Compare this with wrapping a synchronous piece of code with a Future/IO/ZIO and it seems like a lot of boiler-plate for a relatively-simple refactor.\n What's common to both of those cases is the sense that I had to personally take care of behaviors that could/should have been abstracted away for me... \n I was wondering if programming in Akka still feels so low-level...\n    submitted by    /u/TheOtherNoamC  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "This is a post introducing the new changes of Iron v1.2.0.\n What is Iron ?\n Iron is a type constraints (or type refinement) library for Scala 3. It uses Dotty's inline and opaque types to evaluate constraints at compile-time.\n Here is a simple example: ```scala def log(x: Double > 0d): Refined[Double] = x.map(Math.log)\n log(-1d) //Compile-time error ```\n Features of 1.2.0\n Release 1.2.0 brings two key features: an imperative-styled DSL and constraints relations/consequences.\n Imperative DSL\n Iron brings a new imperative-styled DSL directly inspired by Martin Odersky's Representing Monad with Capabilities (HOPE 2021).\n Here is the \"imperative\" form of our log(x) method presented above: scala def log(x: Double > 0d): Raw[Double] = refined { Math.log(x) }  In this example, x is automatically unboxed via an implicit conversion only available inside refined and Math.log(x) is automatically boxed into a new Constrained.\n Capabilities work for other kind of monads. If you want to use capabilities in your project, I highly suggest you to watch the talk linked above.\n Consequences\n A consequence has basically a definition analoguous to logical implication => (do not confuse it with Scala's functions). It is used to convert a Constrained value to another Constrained.\n While a default implementation exists for all conversions, this new typeclass allows you to define specific relations (like transitivity, reflexivity etc...) that have two major benefits: - Check some conversions at compile-time where (for example, we know that a constrained value A / B can't be converted to A / Not[B]). - Avoid unnecessary evaluations at runtime.\n Note that Consequences are not exclusive to mathematical/numerical values.\n That's all for this release. For further information, check the release on Github.\n Happy new year!\n    submitted by    /u/Il_totore  \n [link]   [comments]",

Apply and flip were easy enough to understand:\n apply :: forall a b. (a -> b) -> a -> b apply f x = f x\n flip :: forall a b c. (a -> b -> c) -> b -> a -> c flip f x y = f y x\n Now, for the implementation of applyFlipped, the book implements it as:\n applyFlipped :: forall a b. a -> (a -> b) -> b applyFlipped = flip apply\n So from my understanding, applyFlipped accepts two arguments: a parameter of type a, and a function that accepts a parameter of type a and returns a parameter of type b. Because purescript is implicitly right-associative, that would mean that the function with explicit parameters would read:\n applyFlipped x f = (flip (apply x f))\n My question is: why does the compiler interpret this as flip with parameters apply, x, and f, rather than interpreting it as apply with parameters x and f (which wouldn’t compile), whose result is a parameter for flip?\n    submitted by    /u/helplesslyclever  \n [link]   [comments]",

It will be held entirely online, and all the talks will (eventually) be made available for free access.\n The schedule is still being put together, and we'll release more details in the coming weeks. Please follow the PureConf conference page for updates.\n The conference is very modestly priced at 99 INR, or about 1.3 USD. While we have to charge a ticket price for various reasons, we have kept the ticket price very low to keep it accessible for everyone.\n Please feel free to contact me [ajnsit at google's email service] for any questions / feedback!\n See you all there!\n    submitted by    /u/haskman  \n [link]   [comments]",

Linking to an email that is still in my INBOX works, but as soon as it expires the link is dead. I thought using gnus-cache-enter-article (bound to *) would instruct Gnus to keep the email around so the link would continue to work, but it doesn't: oddly Gnus still shows the starred email in my INBOX even if it is marked as expired, but the Org link stops working.\n I don't delete any email from my Gmail account so in principle I could have long-lasting links to emails there.

Not horrible, but I don't really want that (nor the variable types) in my output.\n #+begin_src R :session :exports results :results output wrap foo <- tibble( x = c(1, 2, 3), y = c(\"a\", \"b\", \"c\")) foo #+end_src #+RESULTS: :results: # A tibble: 3 × 2 x y <dbl> <chr> 1 1 a 2 2 b 3 3 c :end: \n I could switch to using value, which gives me an org table, but then I lose the column headers for some reason.\n #+begin_src R :session :exports results :results value foo <- tibble( x = c(1, 2, 3), y = c(\"a\", \"b\", \"c\")) foo #+end_src #+RESULTS: | 1 | a | | 2 | b | | 3 | c | \n Here's the default data frame output, but I'd prefer not to have to wrap everything I do in data.frame() just to get the desired output.\n #+begin_src R :session :exports results :results output wrap bar <- data.frame( x = c(1, 2, 3), y = c(\"a\", \"b\", \"c\")) bar #+end_src #+RESULTS: :results: x y 1 1 a 2 2 b 3 3 c :end: \n I'd be happy with either a) org tables including the header row, or b) tibble raw output, but without the # A tibble: n x m and <type> bits (though I'd accept the latter).\n I saw options for tibbles calling out max footer lines, but nothing about headers here in the suggested pillar options. I found this github issue which reqeusts more granular printing options, which would not then require any org-specific processing.\n In the meantime, it basically suggests overriding the print function with the what amounts to wrapping as a data.frame. Since that issue is locked, I just created another one to re-start that 2018 discussion now that it's 2022.\n In the meantime, anyone dealt with this and have workarounds?\n    submitted by    /u/jwhendy  \n [link]   [comments]",

I've now had the profiler start by default and tried to look at the profiler report right after I notice the lag, but that hasn't given me any clues. \n I'm thinking of resetting the profiler every few seconds or so to see if that helps, but I'm wondering if anyone here knows of another way to figure out what's going on. \n I've been reluctant to bisect my init since as I said before sometimes hours go by without running into this problem.\n    submitted by    /u/graduale  \n [link]   [comments]",

Unless there's something else out there or someone has started on something, I'd be more than happy to contribute, I just need some guidance on getting up to speed on everything required for a fully-functional major mode.

I tried (setq exec-path (append exec-path (file-name-directory (shell-command-to-string \"which node\")))) but that didn't do the trick either.\n 2 - How might this have happened, so I can stop it from happening again in the future?\n Thanks very much.\n    submitted by    /u/bigpotatopieguy  \n [link]   [comments]",

Still tweaking things for modern web development (react, ts, etc etc)..\n One thing I miss the most about vim/neovim was telescope and fuzzy finding. Is there a way to have this functionality in emacs? I messed around with counsel-fzf but what I got was fuzzy-finding in the current directory rather than the entire project.. \n I am trying out helm now and I keep running into this annoying issue when trying to use helm-fuzzy-find. Am I doing things right? Any suggestions on getting fuzzy finding working in emacs where whenever I trigger it, it searches the root project directory??\n ​\n THANKS!\n    submitted by    /u/EquivalentCancel6  \n [link]   [comments]",

Both are great softwares, and have their strengths and weaknesses.\n I'd like to share my thoughts, and see what you think.\n ​\n Pro for Emacs:\n  \nUnparalleled editing experience.\n Great support for tables, org-babel, etc.\n Highly customizable. Writing an elisp function is a lot faster than writing a plugin.\n A long history, a strong community. I'm really impressed how many great changes happen every year.\n  \nCons for Emacs:\n  \nBad support for multimedia, and I see little hope that this will be solved. (eaf might be a solution but I use macOS instead of Linux)\n Had to write many configs myself. Although I've made it comfortable for myself now, I think I'd have to throw more effort at it in the future.\n  \n​\n Pros for Logseq:\n  \nModern UI (it is not a clear win compared to emacs though)\n User-friendly note-taking. And I don't have to maintain my config. For example, using [[page]] to reference or create another page, viewing all journals in one page, etc.\n More note-taking related functions. For example, Zotero support, taking notes with, NLP (not yet, but in their roadmap), etc.\n FLOSS!\n  \nCons for Logseq:\n  \nHard to migrate. The format is too customized. But I think it is a common problem for doubly-linked note systems.\n Org-mode support is not that great. Inter-operatability is not as good as expected.\n  \n​\n There are also different considerations w.r.t. note taking:\n  \nWhen pressing enter, Logseq insert a new node as default instead of a newline as in Emacs.\n  \n​\n To me, Logseq seems to be a very modern and promising note system, while Emacs remains a lot more reliable. It is really hard to choose between those two.\n    submitted by    /u/aur3l14no  \n [link]   [comments]",

This works for individual tasks in the org file, but this is quite cumbersome if I wanted to upload my entire org file's scheduled tasks. I tried org-gcal-sync-buffer when I was in the org file, but it only uploaded the individual tasks that already had the org-gcal property to the calendar and ignored the other scheduled tasks. Is there a solution to upload everything in the org file at once?\n 2) I was wondering if a solution had already been implemented for dealing with recurring tasks in org mode and being implemented into the calendar yet? It seems like this is something others had wanted but I did not see any solutions.\n Thanks\n    submitted by    /u/waterstrider123  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I have been using org-roam for some time now and have a collection of multiple org files which are org-roam nodes stored in a folder called ~/Roamnotes. While capturing notes, I have setup org-roam to directly write to *.org.gpg files so that they get encrypted upon creation. Emacs uses EasyPG Assistant to encrypt and decrypt files automatically. So during my routine org-roam-node-find operation where I am trying to open one of the org-roam nodes (or files), EasyPG starts automatically decrypting all the nodes in my org-roam folder. This is normal and logical.\n My problem: The process of decryption is quite slow and I think could be handled by multi-processing the decryption of nodes via an external program or if possible in an async way.\n ​\n Is there a way to do this better? My roam notes collection is growing bigger and bigger and I fear that there might come a point where I might have to start the org-file decryption, take a nap and come back to it once I am awake.\n It is important for me to store my roam notes encrypted as I use them on my work and my personal computer (synced via syncthing) and it contains some quite sensitive information. One option I thought was to only encrypt files with sensitive information and keep the rest open, but this adds an overhead of always keeping in mind what I want to encrypt and what not.\n    submitted by    /u/shaggy_amreeki  \n [link]   [comments]",

The package integrates the program dtach into Emacs in order to provide detached shell commands.\n The additions to the package provided in this version are:\n  \ndtache comes with built in support for macOS. A timer based solution is used to issue notification\n dtache now supports eshell through the dtache-eshell.el\n dtache integration with consult is provided through dtache-consult.el\n dtache-shell-command has been majorly improved and is now an alternative to running async-shell-command\n dtache integration with compile is provided through dtache-compile.el\n dtache now has a unified dtache-detach-dwim command which is supposed to be used to detach from a session in all supported modes\n dtache now features an enhanced dtache-open-session command\n dtache now features versioning of the sessions that are persistently stored and will automatically detect when the database contains outdated session objects\n dtache now uses filenotify for both local and remote sessions, this provides an improved experience for remote sessions. Currently this is only provided on Linux based distributions\n  \nThe package is available at https://gitlab.com/niklaseklund/dtache\n    submitted by    /u/squirelpower  \n [link]   [comments]",

Not because I'm trying to learn a completely new keyboard system but because of the exact opposite of that; My laziness. Long story short I instantly jumped into Ergoemacs. In fact, that was the reason I found the courage in myself to try Emacs however it turned out to be a nightmare.\n I'm sorry I'm taking a bit too much let's get to the point Ergoemacs doesn't have the best guide that humankind has ever seen. The dev was talking about customization and two things specifically caught my attention; The sentence \"These keys are defined in the ergoemacs-keymap\" and the word \"ergoemacs-layout-us.el\" I been trying to locate these two things for the past five hours. I checked every little bit of creators Github I check every file that came with the package I checked every command related to Ergoemacs.\n Now I am aware that I can just write them one by one into my M-x as in the guide but I want to see the available ones and edit them. Or I can write them in my init.el using global keys but I have a slight order problem, I want things to go in one place ergoemacs-layout-us.el to be exact.\n This is probably got longer than it should be but cut me a slack will ya I've been sitting here for two days with 5 hours of sleep, talking to no one, and trying to tame the majestic beast that is Emacs.\n Thank you for listening my rant...

By the looks of things, web-mode attempts to implement these things, but I'm not developing templates for HTML. To make matters worse, I cannot indent within templating engine code blocks (white space has meaning). Think code which generates python code.\n What I'm currently looking for is a minor mode which highlights not only syntax (e.g. {% if foo %}Do stuff{% endif %} - but also clearly marks the background of the code block, e.g.\n  {% if foo %} do stuff {% if bar %} Do Other Things {% endif %} more stuff {% endif %} \n Where the entire text block for do stuff and more stuff has a background color of red, then Do Other Things being an inner code block has a color of green (and additional nested blocks get new colors). Obviously red/green are examples and real world colors would be more aesthetic ;). \n rainbow-delimiters ( https://github.com/Fanael/rainbow-delimiters/ ) does this for parenthesis/braces etc but is somewhat bound to the syntax tree of whatever major mode is currently in use, it also scans on a per-character basis, where I'd need to scan for regex. \n I've had a go using font-lock-add-keywords with regex, and while it would work for unnested code, I have no idea how to sanely deal with inner conditionals (e.g. in the above example, currently it will regex start the first if statement, but end before 'more stuff' as the lazy end terminates there. \n Can anyone provide advice on how to achieve this, or if somebody has implemented it in the past?

You can view the barely functional prototype here:\n https://github.com/cryptobadger/flight-attendant.el\n showing suggestions works...\n Sorry, its my first elisp project. Now on to the questions: How would you implement the visualization of the hints provided by Copilot? Because the suggested code snippets are arbitrary complex(?) i think using company is not feasible. Maybe in an own buffer? Right now I try to display them using overlays. This achieves the same visual presentation as in nvim, but it does not work well with company (see the provided picture). I also had problems with auto insertion of closing parens being inserted behind the suggestion and i think there will be a myriad of undiscovered bugs when i follow this path?\n ​\n ..somehow (suggestion should be \\\"import string\\\"\n Any tips, ideas, code snipptes, suggestions, pull requests(!!) are very welcome.\n ​\n Thanks :)\n    submitted by    /u/cryptobadger_  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi, I recently started using emacs and I'm coming from vscode (with vim emulation, I can't leave vim keybindings), and one of the things that are keeping me from going all-in with emacs, is the fact that there is no \"clear\" way to customize emacs and get what you want, or at least it's not clear to beginners.\n For example, in vscode there is syntax highlighting for a huge amount of languages, and if I want more complete support for a specific language I can install an extension easy peasy from the extension tab, in emacs, on the other hand, I would have to search for a package, install it, learn what it can do and configure it. It's somewhat daunting for someone who is not an expert like me.\n Do you guys have any advice on how to customize emacs in a simple yet efficient way (I know there are some pre-configured distros like doom or space, I still have to look into those)? My aim is to be able to add whatever feature to my emacs config easily because I want it to be feature rich.\n In the end, emacs seems to be a really powerful tool compared to vscode (which I think is already pretty powerful), but it's not clear *how* you should use it...\n    submitted by    /u/Dumb-Ptr  \n [link]   [comments]",

I know got global variables I could use make-local-variable and kill-local-variable; is there a sort of similar layering functionality for variables that are buffer-local by design or do I need to write my own?\n EDIT: I've done a poor job explaining myself; sorry I was on my phone last night and jotted this down. Let me try to explain:\n I've written a minor-mode for reading that affects some already buffer-local variables, like indicate-empty-lines, or blink-cursor-mode, etc. These are variables that might already have buffer-local values that I want to persist as I'm toggling my minor mode on and off (in my specific case, I want to turn reading-mode on when I enter view-mode, and off when I exit that mode).\n My current implementation can be found in my emacs configuration, but it doesn't work correctly and I feel like there might be a better way built-in to Emacs.

E.g., dired-other-window, helpful-key or projectile-dired-other-window. If I have one window open, they indeed split the window in two - as expected. However, if I already have two windows open, they end up opening a third window by splitting the current window. The behaviour up until yesterday (...) was that in case of two open windows in the frame, the commands would use the non-current window. \n I have been going through my config and can't figure out what changed!

This is my solution to that problem.\n OneWayOut (owo) can export all your OneNote notes to Emacs Org Mode (or any Pandoc-supported Markdown, as of today), and allows you to tailor the results to your best liking by:\n  \nGiving you complete control over the Pandoc call \n \nAllowing you to post-process the Pandoc output with tailored Markup Packs.\n \n You can see a test OneNote note and its Emacs Org Mode and Pandoc Markdown exports here https://github.com/alopezrivera/owo#results\n Markup Packs are markup-format-specific functions containing search and replace queries executed at runtime against the text output by Pandoc. If search and replace doesn't cut it, you can add a postprocessing scriptblock to increase your freedom. They effectively give you control over how all is rendered, including\n - Headers\n - Metadata (eg: note creation date) \n - Other markup elements such as horizontal lines, custom indentations and formatting, and whatever else you might be able to conjure up with the text in your notes\n OneWayOut is built on the foundation of ConvertOneNote2Markdown (https://github.com/theohbrothers/ConvertOneNote2Markdown), by SjoerdV (https://github.com/SjoerdV), and improved by nixsee (https://github.com/nixsee/) and theohbrothers (https://github.com/theohbrothers).\n All feedback or suggestions are welcome!

          "description": "Hi,\n Recently, I came up of an idea that we can practice natural language (for me, it's English) speaking using subtitle files, as they already have timestamps along with subtitle texts, so that we can loop over specific parts of a video file easily by taking advantage of those timestamps, instead of setting the start time and end time of the playback manually and then looping over it.\n And then I thought of a package, subed, which jumped into my eyes when I was wandering around Sacha Chua's blog (kudos to @sachac). And I found it was perfect for this idea after playing with it for ~10 minutes.\n Here are the steps: 1. Open a subtitle file, say foo.srt, subed will automatically open the accompany video file having the name foo.mp4/foo.mk4/foo.avi etc using mpv. 2. Then in the subtitle buffer, only these three key bindings will do the job: 1. C-c C-l toggles looping over the current subtitle By default, there is an extra second before and after the time span, as specified in the config subed-loop-seconds-before & subed-loop-seconds-after. 2. M-n moves the point to the next subtitle, and it automatically seek the playback to the corresponding timeline. 3. M-p moves the point to the previous subtitle and seek the playback to the right position of the timeline.\n Although the package is designed to be used to edit subtitles efficiently, it could also shine in language speaking/shadowing.\n If you're also learning foreign languages, I believe this workflow can help you.✌\n    submitted by    /u/whatacold  \n [link]   [comments]",

While the auto-composition-mode is no longer guilty, my problem is still that ligatures have a very bad performance. I guess ligatures having bad performance in emacs are known, because they're mentioned in the doom FAQ.\n I recently installed emacs (doom) on a new manjaro installation and since I started using it I've been noticing that moving on a buffer and inserting text feels very laggy, and after a couple of minutes that becomes increasingly noticeable to the point where it's really hard to type, taking up to a couple of seconds to see the input being written on the screen.\n So I decided to investigate further into this, and tried disabling minor modes one by one, until I noticed the problem went away when I disabled the auto-composition-mode. I repeated the experiment disabling only that mode, just to be sure it wasn't because of some other mode that I failed to notice.\n I was wondering if there's something I could do about the performance of this mode. I know I could just disable it globally, but I would like to keep it enabled so the ligatures don't go away. I am using Fira Code.\n I'm using Emacs 29.0.5 (installed through the package emacs-git on AUR), with Harfbuzz.\n All help is very appreciated.

          "description": "Years ago, before my cake day on reddit, I was writing my Ph.D. thesis using LaTeX and Emacs as editor. One of my most common writing mistakes was to repetitively use words (say, word x appearing more than once in a 100 word radius, where it can be avoided). Looking for automated detection tools, I noticed a lack thereof, so I wrote my own (teaching myself elisp in the process). Just stumbled upon it today again and thought it might be of interest in r/emacs. https://github.com/ioah86/repetition_error_finder\n There are likely some bugs, but I hope people will find it useful as I did back then.

Jens Larsen is a very popular jazz guitarist, and pedagogue, he has recorded hundreds of videos available on his website and on Youtube, all with the material to learn or perfect your jazz art on the guitar. My idea would be to retrieve the names of the videos with the links (this should be possible by fiddling with the developer mode of Firefox on the page where he sums up the videos he already shared). Then I would ‏‏‎ like to create one note per title: - the name of the video becomes the file name - the note only contains a property #+Link: with link. Given that there are more than 800 videos, I would like to automate the process, but I do not know how to proceed. Could you please show me the way, and tell me how to create a script/macro in order to do it? I have started taking notes about my newly starting journey with the jazz guitar in org-roam, and I would like to be able to link my notes to the videos, and to search with deft.

ChkTeX is good, but sometimes gets things wrong (or makes suggestions which are not appropriate). Recognising this, it also reads a config file, and recognises certain magic comments, which can ignore warnings, or define new warning rules (it's a really amazing tool, check it out if you write TeX!).\n I recently had to write quite a few such magic comments, all in the same format, for ignoring different warnings (the comments are all very similar, just with a different diagnostic number in each). This quickly got boring, and this kind of programmatic text manipulation is exactly what emacs is good for. So I was about to write a set of functions like chktex-ignore-warning-at-pt and chktex-ignore-warning-at-pt-global (for writing to the config file).\n But then I thought that I can't be the first person to want to do this, and stuff like this (interacting with error information in configurable ways) surely can't be restricted to TeX. I thought there might something like a flymake-ignore-error-function variable, which I could set to my function, and there would be lots of flymake infrastructure for this -- but there isn't. Is there any such infrastructure already in emacs for interacting with errors in this way (ignoring, ignoring globally, finding docs etc. Of course, the specifics would have to be implemented in each specific backend)? I'm asking mostly because -- though it would be easy for me to just write my own functions and forget about it -- it seems like a useful general capability and if it doesn't exist yet, maybe it should?

How do I set up init.el so that Emacs will load a theme that is needed first, but then configure properly afterward?\n My example: Starting from scratch, I want to load monokai-theme from melpa and set it:\n (require 'package) (add-to-list 'package-archives '(\"melpa\" . \"https://melpa.org/packages/\") t) (custom-set-variables '(custom-enabled-themes '(monokai)) '(custom-safe-themes '(\"d9646b131c4aa37f01f909fbdd5a9099389518eb68f25277ed19ba99adeb7279\" default)) '(package-selected-packages '(monokai-theme))) (custom-set-faces ) \n If monokai-theme is already downloaded, this works fine. But I want to have emacs download the package automatically if not already present. I use the following block:\n (when (not package-archive-contents) (package-refresh-contents) (package-install-selected-packages) ) \n If I add this below the customize variables, it installs monokai-theme but doesn't load it. I need to restart emacs. If I add this above the customize variables, it doesn't work because package-selected-packages is not loaded yet.\n There's a catch-22 here since each piece needs the other to run first.\n I want to see if I can configure most things in customize, but maybe customize is not right for this job? Should I be using customize at all?\n    submitted by    /u/Ill_Report9350  \n [link]   [comments]",

With a little recent help from the emacs.stackexchange.com forum participants, I have written up a few Emacs functions to refresh the TD Ameritrade access token for its API, and to submit custom buy/sell orders for equities (although it could be for options trading too, but that's not my cup of tea). At some point in the future, I hope to write Lisp code to stream TDA data using the API and make trading decisions from within Emacs. For the near foreseeable future, however, I'll be relying upon watching the Thinkorswim desktop application to make decisions to buy/sell. Screen real estate is precious, as I need to see the charts, studies, order flow, etc.\n In a nutshell, I only need to tell Emacs: 50.35 RET and then perhaps 15 seconds later 51.25 RET. I have installed KeyboardMaestro, for systemwide keyboard shortcuts offering a variety of options, including executing scripts and so forth.\n I have two (2) Emacs options for order submission, either calling the curl executable, or running url-retrieve-synchronously.\n Any ideas regarding how to do this Emacs order entry quickly and save screen real estate would be greatly appreciated.\n BACKGROUND: There are certain custom orders available through TDA that cannot be executed programmatically from within Thinkorswim, but that should be possible through the API.

More children of families in the middle and upper tiers of society go to university and take out loans to pay for it. These families can handle the loan burden. They tend to get larger loans to pay for education. That education lands them high paying jobs where they can afford to pay back the loan. Loan forgiveness favors these upper income people to a larger extent and with a larger amount of money than those less fortunate. This increases rather than decreases the economic gap between social classes.\nB-The Other [[202102012019]]\n\n  \nAcross-the-board forgiveness is therefore a costly and ineffective way to reduce economic gaps by race or socioeconomic status. 1\n…Accounting correctly for both human capital and effect of subsidies in student lending plans, almost a third of all student debt is owed by the wealthiest 20 percent of households and only 8 percent by the bottom 20 percent. Across-the-board student loan forgiveness is regressive measured by income, family affluence, educational attainment—and also wealth.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStudent Loan Forgiveness is Regressive by  Alex Tabarrok January 20, 2022 at 7:29 am\nhttp://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2022/01/student-loan-forgiveness-is-regressive.html\n↩︎ ↩︎",

A progressive review kind of thing.\nI have a KM macro that:\nPrompts me for the number of days, from a pre-made list.\nWrites a tag (#ReviewXDays, where X is the number of days) to an inserted 2nd line on the Zettel\nCopies the Zettel's h1 (from the 3rd character to the end of the line)\nCreates an Apple reminder \"Review such-and-such Zettel\" with a due date of the number of days out\nIt all works except the calculated Reminders date at the very end.  I think it must be either a variable type problem, or a syntax problem in the AppleScript.  I have a temporary KM Action before the last step that displays the date I'm trying to use.  If I simply copy that (correct-looking) result and paste it as a constant string in the final KM action, it works.  It just won't accept the variable version of that date.\nThe error is some variation of \"execution error: reminders got an error: can't get date (1/27/2022)\", depending on the tweaks I've tried in the script syntax.\nHas anyone\ncreated some kind of progressive review automation for themselves that's better than this\nworked with pushing a due date to Reminders via AppleScript\nThe image is of the last few actions, where the \"make new reminder\" line in the AppleScript is where I fail.\n\n...and here is my KM macro (1st time sharing, hope I do this right):\nAdd Review Tag\nThank you all.",

I see the automation benefits of having the (Markdown) h1 in the Zettel being the same as the file name, so that leans me towards accepting spaces.  But one of my goals here is a pretty rigorous future proofing, portability, and stability.\nHave you all given this some thought and decided that spaces in file names are just not a problem at all?

This was mainly because, first, of the need to differentiate between \"public\" and \"private\" notes; and then to provide for some special behaviour depending on the different use-cases. I came to invent things like § [[1234]] to denote a \"public\" reference to a note to be printed; > [[1234]] for the insertion of notes containing quotes or fragments; > [[1234]] :: [[1235]] for parallel, bilingual texts. I tried my best to give appropriate documentation of these features in the project's README.\nPlease excuse the fact that the code is a bit messy. This is not only the result of a long process of back-and-forth experimentation but because this project was also the personal attempt to learn some Python of someone inexperienced with the language.\nThis project had some of its initial inspiration in books like this (V. Goldschmit's Le système stoïcien et l'idée de temps. Paris, 1953):\n\n\nYou may clone the project or copy the script from GitHub.",

Discussion could result in most universally valuable features being implemented in future builds.\nFunction 1 (software-implemented): Optional Visual Hierarchical Display of Saved Searches\nWithout affecting any other functionality, saved searched should be able to be organized into a visual expandable drop-down hierarchy, which again does not affect any other functionality, so does not implement hierarchical structuring into any aspect of the application other than the visual representation of the saved searches in the sidebar. This has obvious beneficial functionality without breaking the app. Feel free to discuss.\nFunction 2 (user-implemented): Bundled Tags\nRight now, if I have tags #apple #banana & #pear, I am able to create a saved search called \"Fruits\" which saves the search query as \"#apple OR #banana OR #pear\". It would be advisable, in some instances, for you as the user to add the category name itself as a tag to the existing search parameters, such that the new search query is now saved as \"#apple OR #banana OR #pear or #fruits\". This allows the saved search to function as a category as well as a tag.\nI call these types of saved searches \"Categories\", and the tags that represent the saved search redundantly \"Category Tags\"\n^^^ Combining the above two functions does not deviate from to the existing principles underpinning the stated purpose of this application, yet it does serve to improve the functionality in terms of specificity (via Tags) and inclusion (via Categories).\nFurther extending these functions, one can imagine a nested list of category tags\nFor examples of infinite-depth, internally-nested collapsible lists - which would all be great functionality add to the \"Saved Searches\" sidebar of the Archive - check out the Workflowy app: https://workflowy.com/\nThe concepts in this post are not property of their author.

Maybe you'll find something useful about it (especially if you're newbie). Maybe you'd like to share in the same manner.\nI was very inspired about ZK last March, when I found out about it. My first idea was to migrate all my notes there (and get information superpowers).\nhttps://forum.zettelkasten.de/discussion/1839/inbox-overflow). Most of my archive remained as it is, I've refactored old notes into ZK only when need arose. I still have a still growing infodump with those \"fleeting\" notes.

          "description": "tl,dr\nI'm looking for an objective(-ish) measure of the one-thought-only measures. Any ideas?\na small background:\nRecently, I have been getting into learning programming, and I stumbled into Uncle Bob's lectures on clean coding (available on youtube, as of now). In there he outlines that there is this principle that a good function, is a function that does one thing, and does it well.\nHowever the one thing was up for interpretation. (for example It used to be a fuction that can fit into a screen. which is not really that well of a measure). He goes on to say that they came up with a good objective measure:  a function that no one can meaningfully extract another function from.\nIt seems like a very well solution for a definition problem.\nThe need for \"one thought\"\nThe same sort of definition problem is also present in the case of a zettel. Although assuming one thought per zettel might not be essential nor desireable for every type of zettelkasten, it can be useful for some, in order to make a synthesis of an unstructured body of knowledge and emerge with a structure.\nFor example, I might be trying to understand a school of though, this school may be offering argument A as a an argument for their belief.  However, argument A is made up of 5 parts, each part can be argued against, in seperate ways, and the arguments against may be challenged in different ways and so on. One might try to gather arguements againts and try to categorize them, summerize them, and essentially refactor them.  In this situation, if each zettel only contain one and only one thought, it would be much more of an elegant workflow to put them against each other.\nThe need for objectivity\nAn objective measure, can be extremely useful, in order to maintain the flow, and unload a cognitive load of \"is it too big or too small?\" \nThe matter\nWhat are your thoughts on this matter?",

He also seems to frequently produce high quality work (multiple best-selling books, consistent blog posts, articles for good publications, and a large number of academic papers).\nIn a recent podcast episode, Cal Newport made a distinction between proactive and reactive methods of information management.\nProactive information management attempts to takes information when first encountered and put it into some sort of knowledge management system (such as a Zettelkasten), maybe even before there is a specific \"need\" for it.  This information can then be retrieved at a later date, and new potentially novel connections can form between the information in the system.\nHe states his method of working is more reactive and project based, citing the overhead of inputting information to and maintaining such systems.\nReactive information management seems to be more on-demand and project based. When you are working on a particular project, you go out and find sources relevant to that article.\nHe also mentioned that over time (if you write enough) you will have been exposed to a lot of interesting ideas, and often when working on a project, a few potential starting points will come to mind which then you can follow to more relevant citations.\nhttps://overcast.fm/+b1V0JshqM/34:55\nOne question when using a reactive project based method is what projects to work on? This is where I can see the value of novel connections in a Zetellkasten in generating ideas.\nI'm curious what peoples' thoughts on this are?",

Basically, the interview transcript is imported into NVivo, then you go read each sentence and attached thematic tag(s).\nI think this would be an interesting way to organise research and notes, with the understanding that the tagging system would evolve over time.\nFor example,\nIf you are working on a specific article, you could browse through previous semi-related tags and tag sentences that might be relevant to that article.\nOr if you are working on a longer project, tags could start general but then over time be refined and become more specific as you work out the structure of the project.\nThe only way I can think to implement something like this in existing note taking apps is to have one sentence per note, then as many required tags per note, but this seems unmanageable.\nI'm curious what other think of this idea?",

Looking at ideas for creating a tool for thinking, I came up with a tool that prompts me to refine the edits to zettel titles and 'summary relevance.'\nThis 'tool for thinking' results from a python program tied to Keyboard Maestro that prompts me to review titles and summaries of the last ten days of newly created zettel. As an anchor, it is tied to my practice of morning journaling. It reminds me and makes it convenient to examine each zettel title and the one-sentence 'relevance' statement to see if it makes sense and stands up to scrutiny. This is added to the bottom of that template. (pictured below) Automatic, easy peasy, the cognitive load of the initiating behavior habit off-loaded to the computer. This is not an excuse for not editing the body of each zettel. A new zettel will be on the list for ten days. That means ten opportunities for giving the zettel some love.\nI'm unsettled on the format. In its current form it is a bit hard to read. I will make changes for readability.\nIf you're interested in how this is done, have questions about my use-case, or just want to chat let me know.\nBelow are pictured titles and a one-sentence summary/meaning of the zettel I'm working on. These are the ideas I'm currently wrestling with. They represent a ten-day window of new zettel.\nThis is generated with nothing held back. I would love to talk to you about anything on this list.
