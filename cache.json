As a step I tried to follow along with the official tutorial for client side (in Go, as my clients will be that - though it doesn't matter) and try matching server side with Haskell. So, for now I have this proto file (it might be important that eventually, I will need to use proto3):\n // The greeting service definition. service Greeter { // Sends a greeting rpc SayHello (HelloRequest) returns (HelloReply) {} } // The request message containing the user's name. message HelloRequest { string name = 1; } // The response message containing the greetings message HelloReply { string message = 1; } \n Using proto-lens I can generate nice lenses for HelloRequest and HelloReply by following this. However, it is not useful much. I would have to write a lot of boiler-plate for implementing SayHello.\n Therefore, my next best bet was proto3-suite (is that the right one?) Generating the code works nicely:\n stack exec -- compile-proto-file --proto proto/helloworld.proto --out lib \n Which will give me a very promising Proto.Helloworld with data Greeter = ..., but I simply cannot use it (with stack)..\n It seems that that repo is maybe outdated as the resolver is fairly old, and regardless there are always version conflicts.\n What is the way to go for gRPC with Haskell nowadays?

My Idea is to use Haskell-Functions and Variables to have less work and reduce errors. \n ​\n I've read about tagless interpreters but I find it hard to convert a string into such an expression and I only saw that here: https://okmij.org/ftp/tagless-final/TypeCheck.hs\n ​\n That is quite old, so maybe there is a better way of doing it or a library, that is useful for that.\n ​\n I've also read Stitch from Richard A. Eisenberg https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3406088.3409015\n and I liked it very much. In this approach there is also a lot of work to do.\n ​\n I've found very short ways of evaluating typed ASTs here: https://gergo.erdi.hu/blog/2015-02-05-typed_embedding_of_stlc_into_haskell/ and here: https://github.com/shayan-najd/MiniFeldspar/blob/master/Philip/GADT.hs . But there is still a lot working in the conversion from simple ASTs or Strings to these expressions.\n ​\n Is there a even better and simpler way to do that, if the goal is to let Haskell to a lot of work and focus on features that I want to include in my language.\n ​\n Thank you very much for your answers.\n    submitted by    /u/rbrucesp  \n [link]   [comments]",

If anyone here has the time and the will to lend an ear (or an eye) to my plight and provide me with some much-needed advice, I'd be mostly greatly appreciative:\n ​\n As the title says, I am coming up to the final segments of HPFFP (currently on parser combinators/monad transformers), and I am trying to discern the path forward after finishing this book. \n Now, here's the caveat: I am NOT a career software developer. This has actually been my first real deep dive into computer programming in general (*prior to getting into Haskell, I had finished the HTML/CSS/Javascript certifications on FreeCodeCamp, but Haskell blossomed into a total love affair beyond my control). \n So, most advice I see online about what to do after finishing HPFFP could be more-or-less distilled down to \"just get your hands dirty writing code in Haskell.\" But, I feel like the implicit assumption there is that the person receiving the advice already has a decent amount of experience writing computer programs. As for myself, I really have no clue about where to go next; I really enjoyed learning about how all of the concepts from category theory map onto the language (e.g. writing Monoid/Functor/Applicative/Monad instances for custom datatypes and whatnot), but at this point, it's really just pure intellectual enjoyment - like solving a challenging puzzle or something like that. \n It occurred to me that the natural thing to do would be to try to use Haskell for web development, and I have been eyeballing the Yesod book published by O'Reilly. But, would a book like that already assume that I've done backend development in another language before? If so, are there better resources available in this particular domain? Or, am I just not really ready to start actually using Haskell to accomplish something practical yet?\n    submitted by    /u/Beneficial_Shirt_781  \n [link]   [comments]",

Right now I am getting it to work with just two client connections, but I would like to make that scale very soon.\n I'm mainly using jaspervdj's websocket library, which I will then serve with wai/warp. The jaspervdj's chat server tutorial forks a new process for every client connection, and have it serve that connection until it is closed, which I don't think would be as concurrent as I would like it to be. Ideally, I would like to have a way to\n  \nmultiplex sockets (like select() from C), so that I only fork to serve connections that actually have messages arrived.\n or go through sockets in a round-robin fashion, skipping the ones that do are not ready.\n  \nI'm having trouble finding a way to do this; mainly, I'm not sure how to check if a client connection has messages ready. My main concern is that receiveData is blocking (according to the docs), so there is no way to skip msg <- receiveData conn if it has to wait because it hasn't received anything yet.\n What would be the ideal/scalable way in Haskell for handling potentially a large number of long-running websocket connections?\n    submitted by    /u/Zestyclose-Orange468  \n [link]   [comments]",

But then at this step:\n cabal build all\n I get this error from the terminal: \n Make sure you have installed LLVM between [9 and 13)\n ​\n Anyone has this error, or was able to run the Cardano node in a M1?

For example:\n moveSlowly :: Method -> IO () moveSlowly (Move) = putStrLn \"Slowly moving forward...\" moveSlowly m = perform m \n This pattern is known as the Decorator Pattern in OOP languages.\n Is there a way for me to generalize this behavior and possibly even compose these \"overriding\" functions? For example, let's say I have another function:\n attackWithAxe :: Method -> IO () attackWithAxe (Attack) = putStrLn \"Swinging axe...\" attackWithAxe m = perform m \n Ideally I would be able to \"compose\" these 3 functions using something like\n  moveSlowly <|> attackWithAxe <|> perform \n preferring the first match found from left to right.\n  \nOne possibility is to create a record of functions where each field corresponds with one constructor. I turn perform into a record with the default implementation and then I can override each behavior at will using a record update. When I actually want to perform an action just I extract the function from the final record.\n This kind of works, but implies code duplication (ADT constructors = Record labels) and I'm not sure how to \"compose\" from left to right.\n  \nThanks to @MorrowM_ for the recommended design.

Functors are almost always explained and shown examples with the map function because obviously a functor defines it's mappable behavior when the map function is applied to it. But my understanding of functors as a type where when a function is applied to it, it morphs the underlying data and returns a functor of the same type seems to me like a map structure where the keys are the f a and the f b are the values.

That purpose could be just to understand functional programming or computer science in the abstract, yet even that eventually requires application of concepts at some level. \n There is another variant of the posted question which is, what domain was the catalyst for you learning Haskell (either because of a compelling application or just because you could)? Understanding either variant of this question can lead to a pedagogical approach focusing on teaching Haskell+application as a way to jump start intuition and to understand the language’s patterns and capabilities for newer learners and seasoned learners alike.\n    submitted by    /u/xeltius  \n [link]   [comments]",

As it's currently set up, I have test-specific dependencies (e.g., hspec etc.) attached to each test suite, rather than declared as a dependency of the compiler itself. The project is hosted on GitHub and I set up some workflows to run tests for PRs etc.\n However, I've encountered a number of pain points during the development process relating to building and testing:\n  \nCI takes a really long time to run (5min for what is still a small project). It spends most of its time rebuilding all of the dependencies. I tried cacheing it according to advice I found here, which helps with just a plain stack build step, but Stack still seems to insist on rebuilding all the test dependencies every time the action is run.\n \nstack test tries to rebuild the whole project after I run stack build, eating into local development speed. This is an open issue. The suggested workaround of building with --test --no-run-tests still incurs noticeable build time overhead because it also rebuilds all the test suites.\n \n I'm wondering if folks here have suggestions for best practices for setting up Stack projects, with respect to improving build times for both CI and local testing? Or if people could point me to well-established Haskell projects managed with Stack, that I could look to as examples?

This includes UnliftIO, which is considered \"the good way\" to do MonadBaseControl stuff, and some libraries even require UnliftIO instead of MonadBaseControl for unlifting IO.\n However, it seems that UnliftIO has zero support for Either-based error handling and ReaderT eff IO just assumes that you are using exceptions. Particularly after writing quite some Rust, I think that Either/Result is just a superior way to do error handling (specially with syntactic support or some abstractions to convert and generate error types). Unchecked exceptions in my opinion are bad, and feel like I'm back in Python-land where your program can crash at any time from anywhere without any guidance from type signatures.\n Are we supposed to forget about Either and typing and just embrace exceptions, or is there any hope in this regard? Can UnliftIO support this in any way? (I consider wrapping-throwing-catching-unwrapping Lefts more of a workaround)\n    submitted by    /u/xcv--  \n [link]   [comments]",

They are translations of Forbus and de Kleer's justification-based and assumption-based (JTMS and ATMS) algorithms.\n TMS algorithms are classic AI approaches to reasoning about logical implication relationships. Code using a TMS defines nodes representing sentences or logical ideas, and how some nodes can be used to conclude other nodes. We can also identify \"nogood\" or contradictory sets of nodes. Some nodes are distinguished as assumptions, and the TMS lets us reason about how the belief or disbelief in each assumption impacts whether we should also believe or disbelieve other nodes.\n  \nIn the JTMS, the believe/disbelieve setting for each assumption is set directly, and the JTMS maintains the believe/disbelieve status of each node based on the current assumption beliefs.\n In the ATMS, there is no setting of \"current\" beliefs. Instead, the ATMS tracks the minimal consistent sets of assumptions which justify belief in each node.\n  \nPlease do not look for beautiful and pure functional algorithms here! At this point the implementations are direct translations of the original imperative Common Lisp implementations, implemented as a monad transformer, and using STT. A non-stateful re-implementation remains an interesting idea for the (non-short-term) future! I wrote this library to give myself a bit more insight into how these algorithms work on the inside, and some deeper practice with the state thread libraries than I'd had before, but I hope you find them interesting or useful.\n  \nThe Hackage page\n The Github repos\n Wikipedia entry on reason maintenance\n A standard reference on the subject, probably available at a library near you\n  \n[Edited for a typo.]\n    submitted by    /u/jpmrst  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have a set of functions that I can use for that:\n base :: a -> [a] -> [a] base = (:) one :: (a -> a) -> [a] -> [a] one f (x:xs) = base (f x) xs one _ x = x two :: (a -> a -> a) -> [a] -> [a] two f (x:xs) = one (f x) xs two _ x = x --etc. \n However, one and two are basically identical, and also look very recursive. It feels like there should be some way to write one function that would work for all length functions, but I have no idea how that would work.\n Any help would be appreciated!\n    submitted by    /u/CoByte  \n [link]   [comments]",

JVM threads are backed by OS threads. Is the Scala compiler inserting context switch here and there in Cats/Monix code? do Scala language construct allow to create green-threads? Kotlin gets coroutines in the compiler, but Cats/Monix are libraries, not compilers. Or Scala libraries can alter the way the compiler work?\n I'm curious...\n    submitted by    /u/pgris  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm a bit FP maniac and cannot imagine myself getting back to JavaScript or TypeScript. I'm super rusty with everything frontend-related, but was considering three options:\n  \nElm - I like the simplicity a lot; have some concerns about its future\n ReScript - kind of Scala's uncanny valley: on one hand semantics are very close, on the other it's just not it, having hard times to get used to syntax; among all options seems to be the most future-proof\n Scala.js - obviously the comfort zone, but no idea if it's a viable option for the frontend\n  \nMy requirements are:\n  \nI have very limited resources - so don't have time to write own libs (perhaps just bindings), which means I really want to use all JS libs possible (React, sliders, widgets etc). This is where I have the most concerns about Scala.js (scalajs-react looks great, but seems to be the only big thing ported properly) and most sympathy for ReScript\n It has to be an Electron app. Seems to be possible with all options, but wanted to raise since it means the bundle-size doesn't matter (although performance does!)\n  \nSo, my question - is it worth to try out Scala.js (with scalajs-react, I think) or go with more conventional options? With scalajs-react is it possible to integrate existing React UI components?\n    submitted by    /u/MysteriousGenius  \n [link]   [comments]",

Some actions run in parallel, some serially.\n Measure certain things\n  \nI have a decent mental map of how to do everything but #3.

          "description": "I made a post about this over a year ago and there were a few people interested, but nobody followed through and contributed to the project so I'm back again to find fresh faces that might be interested :)\n This is for a game called PlanetSide 1 which has officially shut down, but is now a community made emulator being written in Scala. This game is an MMOFPS and is being built to work with the retail client of the game with no access to the original source code. It's amazing how much the small group of devs have done in their free time to get the game to where it is now, but there are some elusive bugs that have been problematic (plus a number of features to still implement). We'd love for it to be an MMO again, but more dev support seems to be the only way to make that a possibility with limited time of the 2-3 devs.\n Here's where you could come in. The repo is here: https://github.com/psforever/PSF-LoginServer I'm not one of the devs working on the server code due to lacking those skills, but I am involved in the team and help where I can and can get anyone in touch with the right people to get plugged in and up to speed. The community Discord is also here: https://discord.gg/0nRe5TNbTYoUruA4\n How to make it sound more enticing... Do you want 100s or 1000s of people thanking you for your amazing dev skills to make this once flourishing game be populated again with players from around the globe? Do you want to see your code come alive and potentially break the Guinness World record for the largest FPS battle (current record is the game's sequel PlanetSide 2 at 1158 players)? Do you want to challenge yourself and put one more feather in your cap and resume that will definitely get you that next 6 figure gig?

And so on..\n \nI would like to have a \"rule\" or mechanism of some sort that would enforce compile time that for each companion object of these classes need to declare a corresponding val for each of it's companion class constructor parameters. \n \nLet's say I have a class ParamRules(rule1: String, rule2: String)\n \nNaive idea in my head looks like that:\n \n case class Foo(a: String, b:String)\n object Foo extends MagicMechanism(Foo) ( val a_rules = ParamRules(...) val b_rules = ParamRules(...) )\n And with that compiler is satisfied.\n If the object Foo doesn't implement a \"rule\" for one of there constructor params it fails compilation.\n  \nIt doesn't have to look like that it could be entirely different I just want to dynamically enforce this interface user to provide rule for each of the params in the class. \n  \nLet me know if I'm day dreaming, over engineering or simply having a stroke and if you need any more explanation.\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/yodlowy  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm currently a Scala data engineer located in East Asia, using Spark as ETL tool in my daily work.\n For some reasons, I want to immigrate to European or North American countries and settle down. \n I'd like to ask, what is the minimum requirements for a Scala Data engineer to pass interview for companies like FAANG?\n Should I start practicing Leetcode now? Is it possible that the algorithm questions in the interview would be easier for data engineers? How far do a data engineer have to brush up his/her Leetcode level to find a job overseas. \n I'm asking these questions, because in my native country, Spark ETL engineers seldom write algorithm code in an interview while they are still able to have the same salary level with other kind of engineers such as backend engineers.\n    submitted by    /u/AloneObligation3626  \n [link]   [comments]",

I am reading “programming in Scala” and some trending Apache spark books. Last time I wrote Scala like I would write Java and it was super slow. \n  \nIs currying really used in team projects and should I dig deeper into it? \n \nWhere can I learn more spark to tackle very advanced problems?

The code base that supports the examples/discussion is written in scala. \n I wanted to experiment with scala and compare it to the scripting languages that I am more familiar with for this type of work (R, python, stata). Bottom line is that data science in scala is a bliss! I enjoyed mill to manage dependencies, ammonite to run investigative workflows, and smile to train/deploy statistical models. Also, writing data transforms, which is the bulk of most data science workflows, is so much easier in scala.\n I hope you will find the content interesting/useful, and I would welcome any type feedback. Even though I don't plan to do further work on the code base, I would appreciate any comments on this as well. I consider myself beginner-intermediate in scala and I have reviewed my own PRs, so conscious there's room for improvement :)\n https://github.com/mkffl/decisions\n https://mkffl.github.io/2021/10/18/Decisions-Part-1.html\n https://mkffl.github.io/2021/10/28/Decisions-Part-2.html\n https://mkffl.github.io/2022/03/02/Decisions-Part-3.html\n    submitted by    /u/mkffl  \n [link]   [comments]",

I would like to take advantage of this new option so I can have different org capture templates refile to different files, but just can’t get it working. I normally set my org-refile-targets as such:\n (setq org-refile-targets '((\"~/Dropbox/org/work.org\" :maxlevel . 2))) \n This works fine. So I tried to do the same in my org-capture templates. Here’s an example:\n (\"n\" \"CPB Note\" entry (file+headline \"~/Dropbox/org/cpb.org\" \"Refile\") \"** Note: %? @ %U\" :empty-lines 0 :refile-targets '(((\"~/Dropbox/org/work.org\" :maxlevel . 2)))) \n With this I get the error, “org-refile-get-location: Wrong type argument: listp, quote”. So I tried this next: (list (\"~/Dropbox/org/work.org\" :maxlevel . 2)). Now the error is “org-refile-get-location: Wrong type argument: listp, list.”\n I have a decent understanding of elisp but clearly I’m missing something here. I can’t find anyone else using the :refile-targets option so my Google/Github searching has not been of much use. Hope someone here has a better idea.

However, I realized today that when I try to export to a Latex file, the citation gets fully parsed. \n So from this in the orgmode buffer:\n [cite:Asit Kumar Bandyopadhyay in the Preface of@nyayaratnaBangalaBhashaBangala1991;] \n I get this in the latex buffer:\n \\footnote{Asit Kumar Bandyopadhyay in the Preface of Rāmagati Nyāẏaratna, \\textit{Bāṅgālā Bhāshā O Bāṅgālā Sāhityabishaẏaka Prastāba}, Natuna saṃskaraṇa. (Kalikātā: Suprīma Buka Ḍisṭribiuṭārsa, 1991).} \n This is great for Word but in Latex I'd rather have a \\cite command, otherwise I won't get a bibliography with a \\printbibliography command in my main.tex document.\n I took a look at the Latex export page of the org manual, but couldn't see an option to change the export. Any ideas?\n    submitted by    /u/radiolalo  \n [link]   [comments]",

So I updated all the emacs libs and all seems to be okay.\n Except my org-mode capture seems to be broken. I have clock-in enabled in my template, but after entering all the data and C-c C-c, I get this:\n ** Test :2022:2022_04:MORE:TAGS: :LOGBOOK: :END: \n In other words, the CLOCK: line is missing from :LOGBOOK:\n It used to be:\n ** Test :2022:2022_04:MORE:TAGS: :LOGBOOK: CLOCK: [2022-04-28 Thu 12:25]-- :END: \n or something like that (can't reproduce), but the CLOCK line was added with the current time as the start time. Any ideas on what might be wrong? The template is defined as:\n (\"h\" \"Hours\" entry (file+headline \"~/Data/hours/log.org\" \"Hours 2022\") \"* %? :%<%Y>:%<%Y_%m>:%^g\\n\" :clock-in t :clock-keep t :empty-lines-after 1) \n And yeah, no clock has been started. Pressing C-c C-x C-o tells me so...\n Another small but quite annoying change is that on starting the capture I get a prompt to select tags. It used to be that pressing TAB after some characters would autocomplete the TAG and add a trailing colon (:) which made it possible to immediately select another TAG. It now only completes the TAG, so I need another action to start typing the start of the next TAG which is annoying. Any way to get the old behaviour back?\n    submitted by    /u/lgr_  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Most of us are familiar with tree-style thinking that org-mode seamlessly enables, where a parent node has an infinite amount of tree children. From a gardening perspective this works great if you're not breeding and instead just saving seed, as you can structure the data as follows, where each subheading is a genetic descendant of the parent:\n ​\n ** San Marzano Tomato\n :PROPERTIES:\n :WHATEVER: WHATEVER\n :END:\n *** Plant 1\n :ID: sjkjlfkjh\n :YIELD: Xlbs\n [inline image]\n notes\n *** Plant 2\n :ID: oijiohiuhi\n :YIELD: Ylbs\n [inline image]\n notes\n **** Plant 2, Gen 1\n etc\n ​\n So I use emacs and org-mode for everything (of course), and being able to snap pics and add properties on the fly would be AMAZING for organizing anything cultivation related with minimal friction/overhead. Where organization and documentation tends to be most important is in breeding, and I'm unsure how I'd represent say a San Marzano and Roma cross elegantly. Of course I could create a new tree for each cross, but I recall reading org having some functionality (probably using tags and unique ID's) to make this seamless or somehow superior, I believe it was presented as a sort of directed acyclic graph using tags. Using org-mode at all for this would be great since HTML exports would be a freebie.\n ​\n This isn't complicated, but I'm just wondering how you might organize something like this so I don't have an 'a-ha' moment later and decide to restructure everything (but who am I kidding.. that's half the fun). I'm sort of thinking a tree per cross may end up best, since it'll work most naturally with org-mode, and the top level node can include inline images of each parent in the cross, and properties like :ID-FATHER:, :ID-MOTHER: etc.\n    submitted by    /u/AphexPin  \n [link]   [comments]",

However, when it comes to an epub file, org-noter will not work. I'm not sure why this happened but didn't want to bother to dig into this issue because it is not the first time this package breaks down on me. Consequently, I need to think of a different way to read epubs and take notes in org-mode. Since I already use calibre to manage my ebooks, my new workflow simply combines using calibre links and xdg-open.\n The native ebook viewer in calibre allows us to export links to specific locations in the book. The link looks like \"calibre://view-book/someid/somefomat?open_at=somelocation\". Using xdg-open with this link opens the specified book at the exact location. The default viewer enables highlights and other annotation methods, which is also a plus. So all I need to do is to add a new link parameter for \"calibre\" in org mode and define a follow method. Below is a snippet.\n  \n(org-link-set-parameters \n \"calibre\" \n :follow 'my/calibre-follow \n ) \n (defun my/calibre-follow (path) \n (call-process \"xdg-open\" nil 0 nil (concat \"calibre:\" path)))\n  \nIt is a very simple implementation but it does the job.

          "description": "I'm wondering if it's feasible to move of libreoffice writer onto orgmode. Can the following be achieved, in a streamlined way (more or less):\n  \nmodifying the font, color of header levels;\n having an always visible table of contents shown right;\n could there be something like \"rendered view\" if I only want to read the prettily displayed text and \"working view\" when I want to change or define meta things, i.e. :PROPERTIES, #+SEQ_TODO:, etc.\n applying different font color to some table columns and not having elisp logic shown below. Ideally such logic could be defined in emacs.el;\n  \n​\n Out of all these 2 and 3 are the most important, as my notes can be lengthy and I use ToC to quickly navigate. Having them as headers at the top isn't optimal as I'd always have to return to search again.As for #3, I'm having quite a few tables in my notes. At times, some columns are green, some are red. It's important as it helps differentiate.\n ​\n Can it be done?

The point of Emacs is to not have to move your hands off the home row, everything accessible at the fingertips... Not go back and forth between arrow keys and home row. It feels like org mode doesn't even fit Emacs, isn't useful, and I can't see how it does anything in a better way than TeX/LaTeX, Markdown, literal plain text, etc. Sorry about the rant, I just don't understand how anybody uses this...\n    submitted by    /u/MrTinyToes  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hiya!\n I've been using doom emacs for a while now and have been mostly happy with it. I've got a bit of spare time now, and have been trying to put together an emacs config from scratch. Not sure if I'm ultimately going to stick with this config or go back to doom for regular work, but I figure it'll at least be a good learning experience.\n Anyways, I've run into some baffling behavior with the general package for key binding. Specifically, once I set a new leader key, it acts in a \"sticky\" manner eternally. So if I rebind C-SPC as a leader and \"C-SPC h\" to help-command, it works in that \"C-SPC h\" works like \"C-h\". However, any time I use this, it disables the \"h\" key for the rest of the session. Whenever I type \"h\" alone, it behaves as though I pressed \"C-SPC h\". Same with spacebar. In a fresh session, both keys will work normally until I use them once with the leader. After that, the keys are broken until I restart emacs.\n Does anyone have any idea why this is happening and what should be done to correct it? Here's the relevant part of my init.el. Also, please ignore the specific rebindings; this is just an experiment to see what can be done with general and to figure out how it works.\n  (global-unset-key (kbd \"C-SPC\")) (use-package general :config (general-create-definer krm/global-leader :global-prefix \"C-SPC\") (krm/global-leader \"h\" 'help-command \"SPC\" 'set-mark-command)) \n    submitted by    /u/eatabagofbooger  \n [link]   [comments]",

Thank you very much to everyone who's filed issues against the GitHub repository (or reached out via email). It's wonderful to know that folks appreciate this effort, and I love being able to give something back to the community.\n Now: on to the good stuff!\n Packages are available for 18.04 LTS (\"bionic\"), 20.04 LTS (\"focal\"), 21.10 (\"impish\"), and 22.04 LTS (\"jammy\").\n Emacs 28 deprecates Xft and encourages using Cairo/HarfBuzz for font rendering; this build configuration is the one that my Emacs 27 packages were already using, so there should not be any changes there.\n The big new feature in Emacs 28 is native compilation, and as you might expect, these packages enable that feature. The only exceptions are the packages for 18.04 LTS (\"bionic\"); libgccjit packages aren't available for the version of GCC that ships with 18.04 LTS.\n The only packaging-related update I have to share is that the master branch of the packaging repository now has a README with release notes. I'm going to try to move more notes about the packaging process there over time.\n Enjoy, and please let me know if you have any trouble.\n    submitted by    /u/lunarsunrise  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi, I am looking for ways to read a book or paper and record my interactions with it. I am phrasing it like this because I don't want to limit ideas too soon and I don't really know the words to describe it more precisely.\n The goal is to not only read a document but to make its information more accessible by - for example - highlighting and linking internally and annotating (thoughts) . But I also stumbled upon concepts like transclusion in emacs. This would allow workflows where the document is included into the annotations, instead of the other way round. \n So my question is: Do you have a work flow to share that enables you to interact wit documents and record those interactions with the help of emacs?\n Some of my documents are in pdf format, others I have converted to org format.\n    submitted by    /u/smrndmusrnm  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "So, I recently realized that the git pre-commit hook does not ensure that only the chunks in the index are part of the worktree when the pre-commit hook runs. Hence, I set out and add some git stashing to my pre-commit hook to fix that myself.\n This is what I ended up with after some google-fu:\n ```sh\n #!/bin/sh # First, stash index and work dir, keeping only the # to-be-committed changes in the working directory. old_stash=$(git rev-parse -q --verify refs/stash) git stash push -q --keep-index --include-untracked new_stash=$(git rev-parse -q --verify refs/stash) # If there were no changes (e.g., `--amend` or `--allow-empty`) # then nothing was stashed, and we should skip everything, # including the tests themselves. (Presumably the tests passed # on the previous commit, so there is no need to re-run them.) if [ \"$old_stash\" = \"$new_stash\" ]; then echo \"pre-commit script: no changes to test\" exit 0 fi # Run lints/checks/tests/... script/check st=$? echo \"got status $st\" # Restore changes git reset --hard -q git stash pop --index -q # Exit with status from test-run: nonzero prevents commit exit $st \n ```\n Now, this works fine when I use it from the git-command line, however, I run into trouble when I commit via magit. It fails with the following error:\n ```\n error: pathspec ':/' did not match any file(s) known to git < normal testing output> error: could not restore untracked files from stash The stash entry is kept in case you need it again. \n ```\n Anyone have any idea what is causing the difference between git-cli and magit here?\n    submitted by    /u/Foo-jin  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I've recently needed to make a minibuffer completion with annotations. The manual says you need to set completion-extra-properties, and I was able to make annotations, my :annotation-function looks something like this:\n (defun my-annotation-fn (s) (let-alist (cdr (assoc s minibuffer-completion-table)) (concat \" \" .version \" \" .description))) \n Now, this works, but the annotations do not show up aligned (because every column in each row is delimited by fixed number of spaces), and that doesn't look very clean.\n Of course, it is possible to calculate the exact number of required spaces for every column in each row, even though it would slightly sophisticate the annotation-function.\n Another alternative (I think) is to extend the prompt for Marginalia and let it do its magic. But then it would only work for those who use Marginalia package. \n So my question is, is there a convention or a simpler method of aligning the annotations?\n    submitted by    /u/ilemming  \n [link]   [comments]",

A bit sad at first, then I realized its usage may lead to breakages later: what about when the applied FUN's parameters have optional arguments added to the right?

Typically I will google what I am trying to do, come across some posts on reddit or stackoverflow, find some sample code (ie. This is the function I wrote and bound to this key to do x and y), and incorporate that into my own emacs config. \n Here's a simple example, say I want to figure out how to copy the full path of the current filename into the buffer so I can later make a reference to it in my org notes. If I google that, I'll see a dozen different ways to do this and they mostly all work great, but in the spirit of doing everything inside emacs I can't help but wonder... there must be a better way? I feel like there must be some repository of very useful and common elisp code \"snippets\" where I could just search for \"get current filename\" and be presented with elisp code I can immediately use, and I feel like that could all be done directly inside my current document and just inserted as a code snippet!?

          "description": "I've read the topic about Emacs being a user friendly and how it's userbase is low compared to vim (3% to 25%). I know Emacs is a powrful tool, I use it org on my phone, dired, its shell, vterm, etc. But, I got to this point because when I, 6 years ago, migrated from Windows, wanted to have all my tools to be open-source. To get the basic functionality on Emacs, like select, copy, paste, you have to learn its special keybindings. I know you do that in vi/vim too. But, focus on Emacs being friendly and then users being able to explore lisp and expand their configuration. Make Emacs a 'bait', kind-of mentality. \n There are a lot of starter configs, but none currently compares itself to an modern IDE, doesn't make org-mode feel like Typora or some paid/closed application, but Emacs has the potential. \n The last point made, I know there are, at least brought up in the discussion, how the GUI app was made and how it functions, that makes it limited in many aspects. We have hooks, like after-change-major-mode-hook, so we can have diffrent UI depending on the major mode (one for org, python, c, etc), and get inspiration from ides. \n And, lastly, all of this together, except for the architeture for the GUI, may make users think that Emacs got lost somewhere. We all know that we love Emacs because it can be what we want. All of us got an all white screen and made it ours, behave like we wanted. How enabling cua-mode(brought up inthe discussion) can change this? Imo, users simply would have a better start in UI, but get all the expandability that Emacs has.\n ​\n Anyway. I did some lisp to get my functions, I write my articles in org, but have no time to thinkering about it.\n    submitted by    /u/ProjectFresh9279  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "In the official docs on keybinding conventions, https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Key-Binding-Conventions.html it says \"Don’t define C-c letter as a key in Lisp programs\", and while \"C-x\" isn't mentioned, my understanding is that anything beginning with \"C-x\" is reserved for Emacs itself. It also states \"Sequences consisting of C-c followed by any other ASCII punctuation or symbol character are allocated for minor modes\".\n However, many downloadable packages provide functions that are intended to be globally accessible, independently of major of minor modes. Many packages that I use, such as Magit, rg, projectile, suggest global keybindings to access their functionality (or even provide functions that will set \"default\" keybindings in the sacred \"C-c letter\" space!)\n These are all over the place - Magit uses \"C-x\", Tide uses \"M-,\" and \"M-.\", and so on. The most common case seems to be, the package recommends binding some functions to key combinations in the \"C-c letter\" space, but doesn't actually perform the binding itself.\n I'm wondering if there have been any discussions of this topic in the emacs community, and if there is any consensus or tentative directions proposed.\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/_just_the_anus_  \n [link]   [comments]",

But that implementation wasn't generic enough to support more planned features in ox-hugo.\n I prefer TOML over YAML (but that's a discussion for another day) and so I decided to pick just that and develop a generic library that would convert Lisp data to TOML. That was roughly a week back when I wrote this post: https://scripter.co/defining-tomelr/.\n Fast forward to today; I ended up creating tomelr.el and I wrote about it in https://scripter.co/presenting-tomelr/.\n The end-user wouldn't typically care if the front-matter was in TOML or YAML because that front-matter is mainly for Hugo's consumption. But it would be more of a ox-hugo maintenance headache if I were to keep supporting both.\n And so YAML support will be going away ..\n ox-hugo v0.11.0 Release\n https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/releases/tag/v0.11.0\n Why am I posting this here?\n If you are an ox-hugo user and set org-hugo-front-matter-format to \"yaml\", try removing that customization (or set it to \"toml\") and see if the latest version of ox-hugo causes any problem for you.\n Theoretically, it should make no difference in the final website created by Hugo.

If I execute (evil-normalize-keymaps) when the point is not on a link, then RET doesn't work afterwards.

It seems to be working quite well also with most/all pdf-tools-modes, although it is not straightforward to make everything work flawlessly.

I'm trying to not go too far down the emacs configuration and customization rabbit hole out of the gate so that I can actually progress on the odin project. But its too intriguing to not build out some automation and QoL implementations. \n A recent fix I implemented showed me the power of being able to quickly customize built in or added package functionality to be what I want it to be. But it raised the question on best practices for doing such things. \n The example in question was navigating tags with web-mode and emmet-mode both enabled. There is some built in navigation for elements but I found one bit confusing/inefficent.\n ex: \n I use ul>li*5 to make a list with 5 items in it. It smartly jumps between the first <li></li>. I enter some text and use \"C-c C-e n\" to move to the next element. But its at the start of the next element i.e. before the < in <li>. So I wrote a very quick and dirty macro in lisp and bound it to \"C-x t\". You can see that very crude and terrible implementation below. \n My core question here is whether such an implementation is better as a macro that calls the web-mode-element-next command and makes adjustments from there or is it better to just go in and make changes to web-mode-element-next and call it normally. Granted I'll utimately make a better solution that moves the point to the end of tag after > probably finding the character with regex or something. I just don't know lisp well enough yet. \n ​\n My next-tag function - very crude just showing a code structure sample.\n (defun next-tag() (interactive) (web-mode-element-next) (forward-char) (forward-char) (forward-char) (forward-char)) (global-set-key (kbd \"C-x t\") 'next-tag) \n    submitted by    /u/timmymayes  \n [link]   [comments]",

But one discussion I haven't seen is what set of bindings is best supported/implemented outside of the standard text-editing experience. The discussions naturally tend to focus on which bindings are better for each user for editing text. But what about for everything else? \n For instance, qutebrowser is a fantastic web-browser built for keyboard focused input. It uses vim style bindings natively, but can be configured to use emacs style bindings (and there exists a community maintained configuration file to do just that). A possible issue however with attempting to use emacs style bindings for qute browser is that any features you do use, such as god-mode, might require significant manual configuration to implement. Firefox has addons for vim style experiences (I haven't found an up to date and not abandoned addon for an emacs style experience in firefox). \n Emacs has its functions for almost everything, including email clients, terminal/shells, and file management. These would naturally tend to be best supported using traditional emacs bindings, because in my experience, evil-mode, while fantastic, often lacks somewhat in documentation for the various things it's implemented in. But dedicated applications may offer support for features not easily replicable in emacs currently. \n Overall, this seems like something of a wash so far. but perhaps I'm missing something.

Needless to say I'm now using Doom Emacs.\n I'm totally and utterly new to Doom Emacs, having read and watched nothing but the absolute basics. I've made a small to-do list (in Org mode, yes sir) for myself of things I need to prioritize setting up if I wish to use it as a text editor for work. In the Doom init.el file I've uncommented \":csharp\" under languages. Synced and restarted Doom. I now get basic highlighting in cs files, but not much else. I don't know what else this does.\n My intuition was to assume it probably didn't install omnisharp, so I got the omnisharp-roslyn package from the AUR. Added it to my path. From here on out I'm not sure what to do. I know I probably need a lsp client, but not much else.\n Any help is appreciated.\n    submitted by    /u/Gloriouspieps  \n [link]   [comments]",

(funcall 'break-it stupid-toy))) \n It seems that doesn't work. My fake toy-color fn doesn't get called. Maybe because :color is read-only?\n What are my options here? I cannot use copy-toy because copier-fn is disabled (see above) Can I create a new struct type that inherits from toy through :include option, but :color no longer read-only?\n How do I create/clone a new struct from the old one?\n Remember, in my example, the struct has only one slot; the real struct type that I'm dealing with has over dozen of slots - I need to find an elegant way of cloning the struct, changing a single slot value and keeping remaining slots intact.\n    submitted by    /u/ilemming  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "​At my day job I work on a 35 year old product with literally a few hundred million lines of codes. It is essentially a mono-repo. \n There are thousands of directory trees with Makefiles. To be consistent with Emacs concepts, let's call these 'projects'. Luckily projects are rarely nested, and not in the areas I work on. There is no discipline requiring file names be unique across projects, nor even within projects. Furthermore, within any project there can be multiple unittest/ and/or pkgtest/ directories. Each such directory must contain a suite_registration.cpp. \n Most often I work within a single project and want to navigate to files in the same project. Less frequently I need to find a file in a sibling project. Unfortunately, there are ~400 siblings, though I very rarely visit more than 10. \n With recent attempts to work within Emacs' built-in tools, I wonder how I find files in this code base. Or if Emacs lacks adequate built-in tooling, what package(s) might​ help?\n    submitted by    /u/jsyjr  \n [link]   [comments]",

I see that many keybindings besides the C-c prefix are already taken and it looks like overriding those is frowned upon. (Plus, C-i is basically <tab>). \n ​\n So, back at the main question, is there some keybindings for some actions that you ***very*** often do use? How did you manage to set it?\n    submitted by    /u/cidra_  \n [link]   [comments]",

For example, if the point is at $|$ and i type another $ what i get is $$|. The dollar sign gets skipped! \n Also, something i notices is that the double quote char (\") gets paired even if it is not in my config file. Why is that?

Spent a significant amount of time learning the ins and outs of it.\n At some point I was tempted by shiny tools like OmniFocus (a fantastic tool, no doubt), Nisus Writer, Roam Research, and some more.\n After some time I realized I have isolated islands of tools not inter-operating, and I have little to no control over these tools, at least not in a consistent way (JavaScript in Roam, Apple Script and JS in OmniFocus, etc).\n So again I came back to Emacs + Org two weeks ago, having left it for several months. Now, as if my mind has been digesting all the infos that I have accumulated the months before I left it, I suddenly feel like all pieces fall together, I am quickly hacking Emacs Lisp for my workflow automations, my fingers are flying over the keyboard (using Karabiner Elements and \"God Mode\" https://medium.com/@nikitavoloboev/karabiner-god-mode-7407a5ddc8f6) and I get sooo much more done in a way not possible by the other tools I used! Everything is connected to each other now: My writing, documenting, my task management, my text editing and every bit of a text tranformation. This is such a wonderful way to get things done.\n Thank you to all the maintainers of Emacs, Orgmode, and all the wonderful packages like ivy, counsel, org-ql, and many more!\n Also, I am very happy with this community, that has helped me get a better understanding of the ins and outs of Emacs and Elisp.\n    submitted by    /u/pragmat1c1  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello,\n Recently my Emacs got automatically updated from 27.1 to 28.1 (thanks Snap!) and oh boy am I regretting this.\n First, I had to re-install use-package because none of the packages seemed to work. Then I had to update all of the packages. Then Emacs almost took my system down with CPU usage because it was apparently recompiling packages without letting me know in either the messages or warnings buffers. Together with a bunch of stuff in between made this a fun adventure.\n Anyway, I'm lucky that people over at the Emacs Matrix room were able to help out, otherwise I'd be very much dead in the water. Especially considering my newness to Emacs.\n However, as the title says, there's still one issue remaining that irks me to no end. Emacs has lost the ability to collapse/expand headers of org-mode files. It could be a conflict between evil-mode and org-mode, but how do I tackle this? I have no idea.\n When I did C-h k <Tab> under an org file heading, I got this description:\n TAB (translated from <tab>) runs the command evil-jump-forward (found in evil-motion-state-map), which is an interactive native compiled Lisp function in ‘evil-commands.el’. It is bound to TAB. (evil-jump-forward &optional COUNT) Go to newer position in jump list. To go the other way, press C-o. \n I don't consider having a huge or complicated config, so I'm not sure why the breakage happened like it did. If you have suggestions for future-proofing my config so that above disasters don't happen (or at least the chance of them get minimized), then please do let me know. Here's my init.el\n Thanks in advance.\n Edit:\n Thanks to @yantar92:matrix.org I think I know the root cause: https://github.com/emacs-evil/evil/issues/1604 - Seems like Evil-mode is not yet fully adapted to work with Org-mode in Emacs v28.

          "description": "I've run into this issue in a few recent elisp experiments. I want to use format strings with custom expandos to represent points of key-value data (that is, I want to print a formatted string from a object which has keys and values, like a bibtex entry).\n Normally I could do this with format-spec, and associate certain keys in the original object with certain expando letters. But often the data I am formatting either has many fields (more than 26, so a format-spec gets unwieldy), or has a few core fields common to all data points, but could have any arbitrary fields beyond those (so it is impossible to assign expandos to all field names). Biblatex entries for example have a reference key, 133 defined field names, and facility for users to define and use whichever fields they want! Even expandos for a-z, A-Z and 0-9 wouldn't cover all that.\n On the assumption that the field names are always unique within a single object, a good solution to this might be somthing like format \"%(field-name-1) -- [%(field-name-2):%(field-name-3)]\", so as to print something like foo -- [a:b]. The idea is that the expando names (field-name-1, field-name-2, etc.) are programmatically checked against the entry (or against a list generated programatically from the entry), so there is no need for an explicit list of expandos like format-spec uses. I think I have seen a few packages do things like this before, but can't remember exactly where.\n Is there a standard way to do this?\n TIA!\n    submitted by    /u/Jack-o-tall-tales  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "This question might sound provocative but it isn't my intention. I'm genuinely curious why emacs has the concepts of \"major\" and \"minor\" modes. \n I'm no elisp guru but to me it seems that a minor mode can do everything a major mode can: they both have hooks, key bindings, custom variables, etc. The only real difference AFAIK is that major modes are mutually exclusive. And even the latter wouldn't be hard to implement for minor modes by adding something like a boolean variable is-mutually-exclusive or a parameter. Yet the separation increases code complexity by separating the two and adding little idiosyncrasies to each.\n Moreover, the distinction introduces undue cognitive overhead by having us think of a mode as being the \"main\" or \"most important\" one in any given context. Why is that? Why e.g. should I think of js-mode as being somehow more \"major\" than lsp-mode even though the latter is the main driver of my editing process? It feels like maybe major and minor modes were abstractions designed to guide the process of creating packages but nowadays I see that as doing more harm than good.\n So, why not treat them on an equal footing? Do away with major and minor, and just have modes. To me it would decrease code complexity and reduce the cognitive overhead. But I'm not the expert here so I'm really curious about what you think about all this.\n    submitted by    /u/M-x_  \n [link]   [comments]",

After looking around for a function that does that I couldn't find it, so I thought a good training might be to try to write it from sratch. I came up with:\n (defun inwit/replace-org-link-description (link new-description) (setq content-start-point (org-element-property :contents-begin link)) (setq content-end-point (org-element-property :contents-end link)) (setq len-thing-to-remove (- content-end-point content-start-point)) (setq len-thing-to-add (length new-description)) (setq offset-delta (- len-thing-to-add len-thing-to-remove)) (delete-region content-start-point content-end-point) (goto-char (+ content-start-point offset-delta)) (insert new-description) ) \n However, this doesn't quite work, especially if it is run sequentially over several links in a buffer, because the substitutions (both the deletions and the insertions) start missing the correct spots after the first replacement, which works fine. What is happening here? I know that delete-region leaves the point where it should, and I thought that also insert does place the point after the insertion. However, I don't see how sequential calls to this function in a map loop can miss the right spots after the first one. It's like the numbering of the positions in the buffer does not update with my substitutions.\n In other words, is there a way to update the buffer so the following calls to my function can refer to the actual positions of the already modified buffer?

          "description": "I really like how default elisp tab completion works.\n if you set (setq tab-always-indent 'complete), pressing tab in elisp buffer first correctly indents, and then if indented it \"tries to complete the thing at point\" basically autocompletes, by calling completion-at-point. i have eglot and clang installed, and i expect the same behavior in c++ buffer, but pressing tab, only calls c-indent-line-or-region. doing M-x completion-at-point or C-M-i works, but its far less convenient that just using tab key. I'm aware that there are other packages that do implement compilation for you, but i try to use built in stuff as much as possible.\n    submitted by    /u/Disastrous-Camel5424  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi, one of the main challenges I have when writing elisp is that I can't use edebug effectively.\n I write python during the daytime, and as flawed as Python (and its debugger) is, I have managed to create a comfortable workflow with dap-mode:\n  \nSet a debug point\n Run the debugger until it hits the breakpoint.\n dap-hydra shows a bunch of useful keybinds\n dap-ui-repl pops up, which lets me interactively try out expressions, inspect variables, and more.\n  \nMeanwhile, the current state of my elisp debugging is:\n  \nedebug-defun and (optionally) set breakpoint. However, the breakpoint is not visible in the buffer, so it's easy to lose track of.\n Run the function until debugger stops the execution. At this point, a new keymap is introduced with binds I don't know, that overwrite many of my regular keybinds. They can be inspected with ?, it's just a bit... jarring to have half your keyboard change meaning.\n edebug-eval-expression can be used to open a minibuffer to evaluate expressions. It's kind of nice, but it's not a replacement for a proper window repl as it doesn't show history. I often want to evaluate an expression, and look at the result as I'm evaluating the next expression.\n  \nApparently ielm and running eval-defun is one way to get the workflow I want, but I'm having some issues there (probably related to my config). There is some discussion on it here: https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/36918/edebug-repl-ielm\n All of my issues can be solved, and I think ielm is the way to do it, but this just makes me wonder: How do experienced elisp programmers use edebug? It doesn't seem standard to rely on ielm.\n    submitted by    /u/ntwmbc  \n [link]   [comments]",

This issue is almost totally preventing me from using native-comp; any help would be much appreciated!)\n I recently switched to Emacs 28.1 hoping to use the new native-comp support. Being on Windows, I followed these instructions to install libgccjit, copying the resulting libgccjit.dll library to Emacs’s bin folder. However, upon doing so, I received the following warning whenever Emacs attempted to compile any file:\n Warning (comp): C:\\Users\\<omitted>\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\\\libgccjit-554575/fake.s:4: Error: junk at end of line, first unrecognized character is `\"' Disable showing Disable logging Warning (comp): C:\\Users\\<omitted>\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\\\libgccjit-554575/fake.s:4: Error: file number less than one Disable showing Disable logging Warning (comp): c:\\emacs\\bin\\libgccjit-0.dll: error: error invoking gcc driver Disable showing Disable logging Warning (comp): <filename>: Error: Internal native compiler error failed to compile Disable showing Disable logging \n (Where <filename> is the name of each file Emacs attempted to compile, of course.)\n Curiously, when I launch Emacs from MSYS2 MinGW (64-bit), the errors disappear, and Emacs is successfully able to compile all files. What is going on here, and how may I fix it? All I know at this point is that the problem is probably unrelated to the dependencies to libgccjit.dll: using dumpbin libgccjit.dll /dependents revealed that Emacs’s bin folder already contains all dependencies of libgccjit.dll.\n    submitted by    /u/brdrcn  \n [link]   [comments]",

Reading the docs for org-startup-truncated, I expected this to make org mode respect the default.\n Does anyone know what might be causing this? \n I also noticed that the message shown after I run M-x toggle-truncate-lines seems to be backwards (i.e. it says that truncation has been enabled when it stops wrapping)\n Edit: I apparently had a hook that was enabling visual-line-mode in org mode, which was toggling truncate lines.

In spite of the many ways to indent code that are present in emacs, vscode , etc, or even using simple tools like clang-format , students still manage to create and present code which is just not organized, putting everything at the same 0 spaces level or similar.

          "description": "Good evening!\n I recently installed lsp-mode for the Node TypeScript project (using ts-ls) I'm working on at the moment, mainly just because I wanted lsp-rename. The problem is, it only works within src: If I rename a variable, then all files in src get updated, but not in my test directory, tests.\n A lead: If I delete .lsp-session-v1, then open a file in the test dir, then start LSP (and thus import the project) from that buffer, then lsp-rename (on a file in src) will also affect that one file in the test directory, but not others. ~/.emacs.d/.lsp-session-v1 contains no mention of the test file or dir in this case. It also doesn't work any more if I restart Emacs after this.\n I thought lsp-workspace-folders-add sounded good, but it doesn't appear to do anything except make it so that the rename doesn't even work across the files in src any more either.\n Tried renaming test to tests, didn't work. The fact that it searches src even though .lsp-session-v1 only mentions the root directory indicates that it has some fixed folder mappings. Adding more of these would probably be the best solution. But how do I do this? I'm not very advanced with this package or Emacs in general.\n    submitted by    /u/LemongrabThree  \n [link]   [comments]",

Originally the Feynman technique involved with writing your thoughts, questions that you have and things that you learn in a notebook and review them later. Using a notebook is really inefficient to me coz it's hard for me to carry around one to take notes. I used to leave voice messages to myself via my phone and later on manually transcribe them and move them to an org file to organize them.\n Finally I spend a bit of time and created a bot that converts telegram (just because it was easier at the moment. Otherwise it would be easy enough to create backends for the bot to use matrix or whatever) voice messages to org-mode entries and store them in an org-file. It's trainable as well. So one can train it to be more precise. Therefore the more you use it the more precise it can get.It still is rough around the edges and I need to feature tune it, but it is usable and I use it all the time. I thought other people might have the same needs as I have so it might worth sharing.\n Heads up though, the bot is in golang (coz I wanted to finish it up fast, but I have plans to create a native Emacs module for it to replace the golang implementation)\n The repository is at: https://devheroes.codes/lxsameer/Orion\n Also it comes with a text to speech engine (Rigel dir in the same repo) as well that spins up a tcp server and reads out anything that it receives over the socket. This one is trainable as well. Since I use Emacs as my window manager (thank you folks who made EXWM) I wrote a simple client that reads any text that i want in any program for me. Refer to the read me for more info and you can find the elisp client at: https://devheroes.codes/FG42/FG42/src/branch/master/core/cubes/rigel/core.el\n Hope you find it useful and looking forward to your feedback :)\n    submitted by    /u/lxsameer  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Edit: I think I figured it out but I'm going to leave this in case it helps someone else. The \"dimness\" of the rendered face was coming from the italic property of the face (which is not set in the face customization). All italic strings just get dimmer with any TERM configuration that doesn't support italics (like xterm-256color or screen-256color). If I set $TERM to rxvt-unicode-256color, italics actually work!\n Due to issues with WSLg in Windows 11 (a long and disappointing story), I've switched back to using emacs in the terminal. Everything works as expected, except for a couple of face colors in Org Agenda.\n Though the attribute face sample in the customize facility looks correct, the actual face is always a dimmed version of that color (and that is how it appears in Org Agenda as well). This has the effect of making the text nearly illegible in most cases, and I refuse to choose an artificially bright color here because it appears correctly on other devices.\n I have cleared all other face attributes and still this odd issue persists. I've even inspected the face applied to the preview (\"sample\") text itself in customize and nothing seems out of the ordinary.\n Why is it not displaying the color that I have chosen??\n In this image, with foreground set to brightwhite, the face sample looks gray.\n In this image, with foreground set to color-82, the face sample look like a dark green.\n I've also fiddled with the color \"themes\" of my terminal, but those settings have no effect on Emacs, it seems that Emacs is displaying exactly the colors it wants to.\n Any ideas?\n    submitted by    /u/bakuretsu  \n [link]   [comments]",

By default Yasnippet only expands at word boundaries, so for example fooset doesn't expand, you have to type a space between the snippet that you want to expand. As you can see this is a problem with the first snippet because I would like to expand x^^3 to x^{3}. I looked for a solution to this problem and found this\n  (setq yas-key-syntaxes '(yas-longest-key-from-whitespace \"w_.()\" \"w_.\" \"w_\" \"w\")) \n which let's me expand snippet on non-word boundaries. So now I can expand x^^3 to x^{3}. \n However now the problem I have is with the set snippet. I would like that the set snippet follows the default behavior because when I type \\subset the snippet is triggered when I type \"set\". Is there any way to tell yasnippet to expand the first snippet always and the second one on word boundaries?\n    submitted by    /u/Public-Fan-8904  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "There are at least two fundamental ways of reading email. The first, and the one I think is more common, is to open the inbox and choose an email to read from the list. Let's call it the random access method. The other method is to open an email, preferably the oldest unread one, and when you are done open the next one by pressing a \"next email\" button. Let's call it the linked list method. \n When I read email using the random access method I frequently ignore email I feel are annoying to deal with. I also get drained of energy by having to repeatedly choose which emails to read. The linked list method on the other hand side steps both issues: I only have to make the single decision to read email and then I read the entire inbox.\n This package was born from the realization that I like the linked list method, and that I would like to handle more things this way. So what el-secretario does is that it turns different sources (e.g. org-mode todo items or RSS feeds) into linked list-style inboxes. And it doesn't stop there, it can also link different lists together so that email, org-mode items and RSS feeds come under the same unified inbox.\n Package link: https://sr.ht/~zetagon/el-secretario/\n    submitted by    /u/Zetagone  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Prompted by Maggie Appleton’s recent update to her post on Daily Notes Pages, I was fondly remembering a time when I had a teeny little script that appended a single line of text to a kind of log. I didn’t want to use Day One for the kind of fleeting note that might trigger something else but as likely might not. So I returned to my original thought and repurposed it to work with The Archive.\nI borrowed ideas from Better Journaling with The Archive (and BitBar). I don’t have Keyboard Maestro and I didn’t want BitBar, but the principles are absolutely sound, so I adapted them to create a single script:\n#!/bin/sh\n# Open a daily journaling note\n# Create the note if it does not exist\n\nZK_PATH=\"/Users/path/to-your-notes\"\nDAY=`date +%Y%m%d`\n\nNOTE=\"${ZK_PATH}/${DAY}${HOUR}.md\"\n\nif [[ -f \"$NOTE\" ]]; then\n    open \"thearchive://match/${DAY}\"\nelse\n    echo \"# Journal Note\" >\"${NOTE}\"\n    echo \"Date: \"`date +\"%d %B %Y %H:%M\"` >>\"${NOTE}\"\n    echo \"Tags: #journal\" >>\"${NOTE}\" \n    echo \"\" >>\"${NOTE}\"\n    open \"thearchive://match/${DAY}\"\nfi\n\nThe script runs from an Alfred workflow. The first time on any given day it creates the note and opens it. Next time, it just opens the note. And as brunoc noted, because the note has a specific tag it is easy to find all such notes and see whether there is anything there I need to act on.\nI’m pretty sure that this could be more elegant, probably by testing for the absence of the note rather than its existence. Another nicety would be to capture some input and append it to the day’s note without even opening it. The previous little script might offer a start for that. But hey, it works as intended and that’s good enough for me right now.",

I have two Zettelkasten in The Archive, one for academic and more general non-fiction work (around 1400 notes) and one for fiction work (around 1450 notes).\nThe question I have for you is about déjà-vu in your ZK. I very regularly make new notes, only to discover, either when I add them to the ZK or much later, that I already made almost the same note at an earlier date.\nDoes this happen to you? Do you see it as a problem, or as a sign that the topic is important to you? If you notice such double entries, do you not enter the new note, do you merge them, or do you enter the new note specifically as ‘alternative’ to the other one?\nAny other insights are also welcome.",

When I read the bibliography, I found something very curious for a book from 2018: the references by decade are: 7 from 2010s, 39 from 2000s, 62 from 1990s, 50 from 1980s, 18 from 1970s. Nothing wrong with old references: I have cited 19th century books often enough and once a 17th century book in a paper in computer science, but the relative balance caught my eye.  These 80s/90s skew is curious, although a tad more explained by the original date of publication (2007). Surely more ink has been spilled on this topic this decade, some refining the cited works, others casting grave doubt on some other cited works? FWIW, I have a Ph.D. in Cognitive Science and am quite familiar with some lines of research here and which I find rather dubious (won't name names, sorry).\nSo, some good stuff here,  no doubt about it, great material for a longish blog post, but the hefty 250+ pages that it is is a stretch.\nI normally don't write bad reviews, preferring to keep my mouth shut. But this has been strongly recommended here---enough for me to purchase this---so I felt obliged to add a counter argument.  Just my 2¢.\nBest regards,\n  Abhijit",

          "description": "Hi all,\nQuick question re: atomicity of notes and maintaining the flexibility and mutability that comes with sticking to one idea per note — while also making the most of the many possible connections a note could have.\nHow do you think about adding in links to other notes (each of which requires some elaboration/explanation for why they've been linked to/mentioned in the current note) without making the note now be \"about\" more than one thing?\nDo you see the additional text explaining the inclusion of a linked note as 'not counting' towards the main concept of the note? Do you put the connections and links under a References header to separate in into different types of content?\nThe image below is an example of a note where I feel like I've managed to maintain the singular point of the note (what the concept of \"in process\" notes is in my system) fairly well but I can also see how paragraphs 2 and 3 could be seen as separate ideas to the main idea of the note. In that case, wouldn't it make sense to have that text appear as bullets under the Reference header?\nI know there's no one way to use a zettelkasten but your thoughts on the way of thinking about atomicity when linking would be helpful.\nTa!",
