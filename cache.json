It covers splitting test cases, input parsing, and output formatting for some common patterns so that you can focus on the algorithm as a pure function.\n I am a Haskell enthuiast who likes to use Haskell for solving coding challenges in competitive programming (like in CodeForces). Over the years, I settled on a common pattern for most solutions which I wanted to share with you all. Most of the times, my main function is just parsing the input into test cases, solving each test case, and then format the output. So, all my IO resides on a single line main program where as the actual solution is a pure function from some input type to some output type.\n Formalizing this pattern in the template, I have a solve function for input type i and output type o:\n solve :: (Parser i, Formatter o) => Splitter -> Solution i o -> IO () solve splitter solution = interact $ unlines . map (format . solution . parse) . splitter . tail . lines \n I defined 2 type classes - Parser and Formatter - to support parsing and formatting for some common input/output types. Splitter and Solution on the other hand are just type alias.\n class Parser i where parse :: [String] -> i class Formatter o where format :: o -> String type Splitter = [String] -> [[String]] type Solution i o = i -> o \n I have added few useful instances for Parser and Formatter type classes, but more can be added easily. For the Splitter on the other hand, I just created couple of common splitters - fixedSizeSpliiter when each test case has fixed number of lines and dynamicSizeSpliiter when number of lines per test case can be derived from the first line of each test case.\n Feel free to share your experiences, improvements, or suggestions.\n    submitted by    /u/mihassan  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello all, I am wondering what the current state of the Web Assembly back-end is for GHC? Is the best way to compile to wasm to use the back-end from ghc-wasm-meta? Also, does anyone have any information about how to call functions written in Haskell in a browser? In my experiments with C++, one can tell emscripten to keep certain functions in the wasm binary by prefixing their return type with \"EMSCRIPTEN_KEEPALIVE\". Is there a Haskell equivalent for this?\n EDIT: I think my answer I was looking for can be found here. It seems like this is how you get to keep haskell functions in the wasm binary. I am not entirely sure how to match up JavaScript types with Haskell's, though.\n    submitted by    /u/jamez5800  \n [link]   [comments]",

To people without a mathematical background such laws may seem intimidating; how would one even start to think about proving them for our own abstractions? In this episode of The Haskell Unfolder we will discuss examples of these laws, show how to prove them, and discuss common techniques for such proofs, including induction. We will also discuss why these laws matter; what goes wrong when they do not hold?\n The Haskell Unfolder is a YouTube series about all things Haskell hosted by Edsko de Vries and Andres Löh, with episodes appearing approximately every two weeks.\n We also have a GitHub repository with the code samples from the episodes:\n https://github.com/well-typed/unfolder\n And we have a public Google calendar listing the planned schedule:\n https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/embed?src=c_327de9ca66caa0307fd99de5b0e3fdd2ad1111ae857bd21659166c74b2b974f0@group.calendar.google.com\n (or ICal: https://calendar.google.com/calendar/ical/c_327de9ca66caa0307fd99de5b0e3fdd2ad1111ae857bd21659166c74b2b974f0%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic.ics )\n    submitted by    /u/kosmikus  \n [link]   [comments]",

Initially, I was trying to revive the defunct Z-Botan bindings, but stripping it of its non-building dependencies proved to be infeasible, and the embedded version of Botan also proved to be out of date. Rather than give up, I decided to make a project of it, and start from scratch with fresh bindings to the latest version in modern Haskell.\n This approach has been extremely rewarding, and today, I am proud to share that I have hit a wonderful milestone - I am halfway through implementing the low-level 1:1 bindings.\n Right now, the bindings support:\n  \nHashing\n Message authentication codes\n Symmetric ciphers\n Block cipher modes\n Public key signatures\n Bcrypt and Password hashing\n Random number generators\n Base16 and Base64 encoding\n  \nFrankly, it is awkward to use, isn't versioned yet, and does not even have any algorithm constants (yet!), but as long as you can read the Botan C FFI docs, it works - and if everything keeps going as smoothly as it has, a friendlier high-level interface isn't too far away.\n I don't have a project page yet, but if you want to follow this project, you can check out the repo, or you can follow the devlog on the Haskell Discourse where I've been more-or-less posting daily.\n Edited for minor typoes and an incorrect link\n    submitted by    /u/ApothecaLabs  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I was looking for a good language to implement a personal project I have (a search engine). After listening to Martin Odersky's talk \"Simply Scala\" at ScalaIO Parris 2022, I decided to give Scala a try. I practiced some Scala 3 and everything worked great. So far I really like the language. I am at the stage of selecting the libraries that I will use for the project. I wanted to implement the backend in Scala but after I stumbled with the Lift framework and after reading other posts on Full Stack Scala, I really want to give it a try. Specially since my UI is going to be simple. I was thinking of using Scalatra for the backend and maybe Lift in the front end (if the UI gets complex enough). But I noticed that both frameworks only have stable versions that are compatible with Scala 2. This article (https://medium.com/@takezoe/scalatra-now-supports-scala3-4eb8988484a7) claims that Scalatra supports Scala 3. It makes sense, since (as I understand) Scala 3 is binary compatible with Scala 2. But the Scalatra docs only covers the Scala 2 version. There are no docs for the Scala 3 version. Is this because there is no meaningful difference between the APIs of the two versions? I also read a post that mentioned that Akka did not fully support Scala 3( I tried finding it again to link it here but I couldn't find it). This gives me the impresion that Scala 3 is still not supported by most libraries.\n I have not tried to run any test projects because I still need to learn how to use sbt (I started learning Scala a couple of days ago). But I got cold feet. Before I proceed, in order to spare myself unnecessary hurdles, I would like some advice. Should I learn Scala 2 and wait until the ecosystem migrates to Scala 3? Or is it recommended to stick to Scala 3 and work around the few incompatibilities that some frameworks might have?\n    submitted by    /u/glznzuriel  \n [link]   [comments]",

Like CanThrow or DbTransaction - indicating function requires special scope for evaluation - e.g. scope catching specific exceptions or scope running database transaction, committing or aborting it in the end.\n Mutable data - to keep our class Foo immutable, we can pass so-called Context containing mutable stuff - caches for example.\n Stateful objects with lifecycle - if C has close() method, we have following options: a) pass c via Foo's constructor and add close() to Foo, making it mutable b) pass c as ordinary parameter which clutters client code without much benefit c) use context function that provides implicit C in scope and closes C when it leaves the scope.\n  \nI'm calling out for other people's experience - which of those are good ideas? Which are not-so-good ideas?

          "description": "I have a stupid question. I create a trait that attempts to encapsulate a third party library. Initially there will only have one specific library instance implementation (Let's called it library A). Later on there will add some others. To my best of knowledge, I can make use of type class for such purpose. The code is below.\n # Scala version 2.12.x # JDK 11 trait MyTrait[T] { ... some methods ... } object MyTrait { def apply[T: MyTrait]() = implicitly[Logging[T]] implicit val lib1 = new MyTrait[Lib1]{ ... } } \n Now there is another question coming in. When using this library A, it depends on some external information. However, when creating type class, it can't pass additional information because it's created by initializing trait. Though I can directly pass those additional information during implicit trait initialization like `new MyTrait[A] { val a = ...; val b = ...; }`, it's hard coded, and becomes global variables, which looks not right to me. \n Any suggestions to achieve such goal in a better way?

Cargo is great when you are developing and packaging a single Rust library or application, but when it comes to\na fast-growing and complex workspace, one could be attracted to the idea of using a more flexible and scalable build system. Here is a nice article elaborating on why Cargo should not be considered as a such a build system. But there are a handful of reasons to consider Bazel:\nBazel’s focus on hermeticity and aggressive caching allows us to improve median build and test times, especially for a single Pull Request against a relatively large codebase.\nRemote caching and execution can significantly reduce the amount of Rust compilation done locally on developers’ machines.\nThe polyglot nature of Bazel allows exp…",

But just how significant that step up is depends on how much use I'd make of those back-links when subsequently reading my org-roam nodes.

Apart from this not positive side, I like the institution a lot from an etical point of view. Was thinking to install a linux distro in the cloud and access from the office but not sure, I cannot share work data outside my pc, at this purpose I would have find a program that would allow to host on docker emacs: cloudmacs.

          "description": "Some users were reporting problems when trying to set up notifications for scheduled org-mode tasks. I couldn't find many examples for doom emacs, which got me slightly concerned.\n Does anyone have any configuration or advice for choosing the right package (org-notifications, org-alert, org-wild-notifier, org-timed-alerts) for setting it up? The end goal I expected to be standard system notifications (e.g. notify-send) that you could configure to appear 30 minutes, 1 hour, 1 day before a scheduled event.\n UPDATE1: It appears that org-alert isn't working out of the box and requires some extra configuration - it is necessary to make org-notifications work.\n UPDATE2: seems that by default org-alert outputs to message buffer. Adding (setq alert-default-style 'libnotify) seems to have solved it.\n UPDATE3: looks it shouldn't be necessary. org-notifications should set alerting style to libnotify already when running (org-notifications-start), so adding it to (after! org... ) block should be enough (hopefully).\n UPDATE4: above doesn't work.

          "description": "One can open an android APK as a project in Android Studio. If the APK has been installed on a mobile that has developer options enabled, it is then possible to get a log of what happens during the apps start up.\n Install the app on the mobile, ensure that the developer options are enabled. In developer options enable USB debugging. Connect the computer to the mobile with a USB cable. At first connection you will have to authorize (on the mobile) access from the computer. In developer options go to \"Select debug app\" and choose, say \"org.gnu.emacs\". Also enable \"Wait for debugger\".\n See the following web page: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16929391/android-how-to-debug-apps-start-up-process\n Check that you can access the mobile from the computer by running from the command line e.g.:\n - adb -d shell\n ls\n Now open the APK as a project in Android Studio, if you have not already done this. In the device manager (View > Tool Windows > Device Manager), select you mobile under \"Physical\".\n Start emacs on the mobile. You should get a requester \"Waiting for debugger\". In Android Studio select Run > Attach to Process. This should open a debug console, but this window will probably only show that Android Studio connects to the app, but then loses the connection (because the app crashes).\n All is not lost: In the debug window select \"Logcat\" at the bottom. This will probably also not show a lot, but notice at the top of the window the text \"package:myapp\" or some such. Change this to \"package:org.gnu.emacs\", and you should now hopefully see a crash log.\n ​\n    submitted by    /u/johan_widen  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Here is how I succeeded in building Android emacs with the libpng library. The process is described in the emacs repo file ./java/INSTALL, but here are some additional details. My initial build of emacs with this library crashed at start up. I will describe in a separate post how I debugged this.\n I browsed to https://android.googlesource.com/platform/external/libpng and made a git clone of the repo. I then used magit to select branch android13-release. There was no Android.mk file in that branch, so I looked for it in older release branches. The newest release branch that had an Android.mk was nougat-release, so I copied that file outside the repo, went back to branch android13-release and moved Android.mk into the repo directory.\n I compared the file to Android.bp but saw essentially nothing that was needed to change. I set LOCAL_SDK_VERSION := 25, but am unsure if that variable has any significance. I eventually compared Android.mk to CMakeLists.txt, and discovered that I had missed a file needed in my_src_files_arm: arm/palette_neon_intrinsics.c\n Building without that extra source file caused no complaint from the build, but emacs crashed at start up.\n To build with the libpng library I added the following option to configure:\n --with-ndk-path=$HOME/projects/android/libpng\n After the build it is a good idea to check that the expected library files are actually in the build directory:\n ls cross/ndk-build\n    submitted by    /u/johan_widen  \n [link]   [comments]",

I ran either 29 or 30 on them in the past months. In the last couple of weeks I focused on the 29 branch, running the pretests and as of last week, installed the official 29.1.\n I guess I began to see slowness or lagging, since I explicitly began a bankruptcy on the older laptop - initially thinking I have too much packages. Everything was lagging: browsing org files, startup times, describe-variable took couple of seconds to return results, M-x completion with vertico had a noticeable lag with each key press, key press latency in writing, eglot jumping to definitions. So much so that I really started thinking about replacing my old laptop.\n Yesterday I decided that I want to test whether it's due to Emacs. I reverted back to 28.2 on both laptops. It was night and day. The new laptop flies; the old laptop runs smoothly so I even reverted the bankruptcy, adding back all the packages I removed and it's still as smooth as I remember Emacs running in the past. \n This is not a bug report. It's my own observation, running multiple versions of Emacs on old and new hardware, sometimes compiling from source, sometimes downloading from https://emacsforosx.com/. I just want to raise awareness, see if people have a similar experience. If enough evidence arises, perhaps someone who knows what they're doing can run benchmarks or profiling and we'll go from there.\n    submitted by    /u/troll-gpt  \n [link]   [comments]",

I want to use Emacs for managing a lot of my Markdown notes in a specific folder, and also implements Org-Mode. I have thousands of notes in my folder. Coming from Obsidian, there was a very nice extension called Omnisearch that would index the content of my notes and allows me to search them easily (title and content). In Emacs, I think that rg.el (frontend for ripgrep) could allow me to easily search through my notes. I heard about org-roam and some built-in search but I’m not interested in this package. I will start with mardown-mode and org-mode, and may try Denote in the future.\n My pain points and questions are the following:\n ​\n  \nDo you know which package could best match the search features of Omnisearch? As a beginner I’m a bit lost with the sheer amount of packages to do search (helm-rg, helm-ag, helm-org-riffle, deft, rg.el, counsel…). I settled on rg.el but I am not sure.\n When I open Emacs, it always start at the directory ~/. If I only want to manage the files in the notes directory, how should I go about that? Should I always use Dired to go to the directory and then exit? Or should I create a project (project.el ) for the directory containing all my notes? I see that a lot of package have features to interact with projects. I am a bit unclear about when to create a project or not.\n I installed Helm because it is always mentioned (I prefer a single package to do the thing rather that the popular alternative that is a combination of a lot of small packages), but should I even use Helm at all if I want to use Emacs to write, edit and search notes? I’m a bit unclear about the real value for me (I’m probably not advanced enough).\n  \nThanks for your help!\n    submitted by    /u/Original_Bend  \n [link]   [comments]",

This happen a little while ago, but thought I would add it as well in this update.\n    submitted by    /u/meain  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have tried various packages for PowerShell, but have found them either incomplete or unmaintained; so about two weeks ago, I decided to try and write my own package, named koopa-mode. \n koopa-mode is a minimal major mode for PowerShell that has the following features:\n  \nSyntax highlighting and formatting\n The ability to spawn – and send code to – a PowerShell process in a new buffer\n Autocompletion for cmdlets\n  \nThis is a work in progress and there are a few bugs. Nested indentation does not work as expected and there is this weird bug when using koopa-mode in Windows where autocomplete appends white space to cmdlets. I also started writing Emacs Lisp two weeks ago and have very little experience with LISP, so it is also likely my code is inefficient or just flat out awful. \n With that said, I love Emacs and want it to thrive, and someone suggested awhile back that the best way to support Emacs is to contribute to it.

As such, the following code is correctly formatted\n latex { xxxx { zzz } } [ yyy ] \n Custom environments are also correctly formatted\n \\begin{aaaa} { xxx } [ yyy ] \\end{aaaa} \n However, tabular as well as any other tabular-like environment handled by AUCTeX does not respect indentation; here, what I mean by handled is those environments whose formatting is set to LaTeX-env-tabular as well any other environment I append using LaTeX-add-environments and set to LaTeX-env-tabular.\n As an example, as soon as talltblr is on the list handled by AUCTEX, Emacs does not indent content inside brackets\n \\begin{talltblr}[ caption = {Somthing}, label = {tab:something}, % ... ] { colspec = {Q[l] X[c,m] Q[3cm,mode=math]}, hlines, vlines, row{1} = {font=\\bfseries}, } X & X & X \\\\\\\\ Y & Y & Y \\end{talltblr} \n I expect the following would be the correct formatting\n \\begin{talltblr}[ caption = {Somthing}, label = {tab:something}, % ..., ] { colspec = {Q[l] X[c,m] Q[3cm,mode=math]}, hlines, vlines, row{1} = {font=\\bfseries}, } X & X & X \\\\\\\\ Y & Y & Y \\end{talltblr} \n One obvious solution is to remove or not to include environments in the list. However, I really like how AUCTeX formats tables. It adds required indentation between & and \\\\ to show where inner environments start. Hence, the code is much clearer and more readable with multiple inner and nested tabulars. The indentation would be a great addition to it.\n I ask this question in hope that perhaps someone has already sorted it out. I would also be grateful for any clues and pointers to start with.\n Thanks\n    submitted by    /u/_-Big-Hat-_  \n [link]   [comments]",

Currently, major modes like org-mode and magit are supported thankfully (using evil-collection) but unfortunately, I haven't come across a good way to integrated evil-mode with notmuch. Much of the bindings of notmuch and evil-mode overlap with each other, thus hampering the bindings of notmuch. Currently, I'm just disabling evil-mode in every notmuch buffer and am using the standard emacs bindings.\n So as per the title, is there a way to integrated notmuch and evil-mode? Or perhaps use just a subset of evil-mode in a notmuch buffer (like simple \"j\" and \"k\" for moving around for example).\n Thanks in advance!\n    submitted by    /u/kn0xchad  \n [link]   [comments]",

I setup a simple init.el file like so:\n ``` ;; Set up package.el to work with MELPA (require 'package) (add-to-list 'package-archives '(\"melpa\" . \"https://melpa.org/packages/\"))\n ;; Download Evil (unless (package-installed-p 'evil) (package-install 'evil))\n ;; Download Catppuccin (unless (package-installed-p 'catppuccin-theme) (package-install 'catppuccin-theme))\n ;; Enable Evil (require 'evil) (evil-mode 1)\n ;; Enable Catppuccin (load-theme 'catppuccin :no-confirm) (setq catppuccin-flavor 'mocha) (catppuccin-reload)\n (custom-set-variables ;; custom-set-variables was added by Custom. ;; If you edit it by hand, you could mess it up, so be careful. ;; Your init file should contain only one such instance. ;; If there is more than one, they won't work right. '(package-selected-packages '(catppuccin-theme evil))) (custom-set-faces ;; custom-set-faces was added by Custom. ;; If you edit it by hand, you could mess it up, so be careful. ;; Your init file should contain only one such instance. ;; If there is more than one, they won't work right. ) ```\n It works perfectly on Ubuntu running under WSL, it does not quite work on straight Windows 11. On Windows 11 it does set the theme to Catppuccin so I know it's sourcing the init.el file correctly but it evil mode doesn't start working until after I manually toggle it via (M-x evil-mode)\n Also, if it makes a difference, I am using 28.2 on both WSL and straight Windows. \n It's just a minor inconvenience but if there is something I am missing that will fix it then I am all ears.\n    submitted by    /u/CraftMcMatt  \n [link]   [comments]",

I use custom emacs with doom theme and lots of other packages, namely counsel, ivy, lsp, projectile, some minor ones. Suddenly, lsp started to complain a lot with warnings, projectile stopped running my projects with qemu (but pure terminal works), a lot of other problems -- warnings in different packages. What are the basic steps I need to check after an upgrade? Yes, I have downloaded all packages from scratch but problems are still there.\n Right now, the most annoying thing is the way I run qemu with tun/tap interface enabled. If I run from separate console, my project starts as expected. If I run it as a command for projectile/run, qemu cannot open tap interface (resource is busy). Manual check of env in console/projectile does not show any significant differences.\n Edit: a bit more details\n    submitted by    /u/locutus-feles  \n [link]   [comments]",

And it's not only your own user config, but all packages need to add support for each new mode, even if they don't care about tree-sitter. \n Given that, the core developers must have had good reasons for not going the minor-mode route.

I could just use avy-goto-char-timer, but it would show all other matches in the buffer, so making it unique is harder and sometimes impossible, so I have to press the target key(s).\n Looking at the implementations, I'm a bit stuck though, as avy-goto-char-in-line uses avy-jump for scoping, which is based on regexes, but avy-goto-char-timer gets the candidate list with avy--read-candidates, where I don't see how I would scope to the current line (and which looks harder to extend, as it's quite complex).

The daemon command runs and outputs the usual startup messages, but it's like it doesn't finish loading fully and never executes the daemon.\n I tried emacs -q --daemon --nw and this worked, so the problem is in my init somewhere. Ugh.\n I tried --debug-init but it found no problems. The only output I get in Messages is:\n Error loading autoloads: (file-missing Cannot open load file No such file or directory /home/alanm/.emacs.d/elpa/yaml-mode-20230714.440/yaml-mode-autoloads) Loading /home/alanm/.emacs.d/orgmode_customizations.el (source)...done Loading /home/alanm/.emacs.d/email.el (source)...done Turning on magit-auto-revert-mode...done For information about GNU Emacs and the GNU system, type C-h C-a. Package cl is deprecated \n I'm not sure what is trying to load cl. It's nowhere in my config, and the only cl- packages I have installed show as builtins. Not sure what's up with yaml-mode, but I don't think that's it because the problem was happening before I updated yaml. I've also tried commenting out my orgmode and email external .el files, and that didn't help, so the issue is in the init file directly.\n I can run server-start in an emacs window and then connect, but I'd like to have a background daemon running instead.\n Any ideas?

I know what I want from an editor and am ready to spend a lot of time customizing one of these editors, but I don't want to do it twice. So I will tell my preferences and it would be really great to get your advice.\n  \nI prefer to use an editor in terminal, without additional gui. As far as I know neovim is tui app, while emacs is not. However, I can run emacs in my terminal. How much I lost not using gui version of emacs?\n \nI want to create and edit notes and to-do's using an editor. I am not going to use it as a calendar as I prefer to use apple calendar on my macbook and iphone. How many advantages does org-mode have over simple md? Also I've read about org-mode for neovim...\n \nI want to try to use an editor as ide too. I'm angular developer and I'm working on rather large project (main project contains about 7k files). I'm worried about the performance of the autocomplete. Unfortunately, I failed to find ready-made configs for emacs and neovim to open the project and see for myself.\n \nI definitely don't want to use my editor as browser, gaming platform, email client, window manager etc etc. Honestly, looks like neovim is winner here :)\n \nI don't want to use something like spacemacs, emacs-doom, etc., just self-written configs. And I don't know what is better in this case - elisp or lua/vimscript.\n \nI have no preference between emacs or vim hotkeys. Both are good.\n \nEmacs startup time is significantly worse than neovim's, even though I have very few plugins installed. Can I fix it without using client-server? It's not a big problem, but it's annoying.\n \n So i'm looking for a lightweight and fast editor for notes and development on angular. Should I spend my time on emacs or neovim?

          "description": "I was trawling through textfiles.com and found this:\n http://textfiles.com/programming/vivsemacs.txt\n ​\n  \nABSTRACT: The editors vi and emacs were compared using a simple time-based experimental method involving common text manipulations and a post- test opinion survey by questionnaire. The subjects were twelve students; six were novices and six were regular users. Significant objective performance differences were confined to the novice users; here emacs consistently outperformed vi with respect to time taken to perform the tasks and the amount of help needed. Subjectively, novices preferred emacs because of its more predictable nature. Emacs was therefore the editor of choice for the novice users tested. There appears to be no advantage for a regular user of one editor to switch to the other.\n  \n​\n    submitted by    /u/supertoothy  \n [link]   [comments]",

In short, out of the box, Screen does not seem to support italic fonts when used with a standard terminal, e.g. xterm. Since lots of recent Emacs packages use italics, e.g. Marginalia, this is quite annoying. Without italics support, Screen places some ugly underlines to highlight text.\n A way to check italics support is to run chinfocmp -1 | grep -E 'ritm|sitm'. When run inside Screen, the output is empty. When run without Screen, the output is not empty. I have not found a $TERM value that uses standard termcap or terminfo database entries that fixes this issue inside Screen.\n What is your setup for running Emacs inside Screen with good italics support?

I'm forced to use a Mac for work, and primarily remote display Emacs through x2go and Xquartz. I can't figure out how to bind a key to Super. By default, option is used for Meta, but command key combos seems to send international characters to emacs rather than get recognized as a modifier. When I'm running locally on the Mac, `(setq mac-command-modifier 'super)` works, but since my remote emacs isn't running on MacOS this has no effect. As far as I can tell, Super doesn't show up in Xquartz configuration at all. Is this just a missing feature I'm going to have to live with? \n And if you're wondering why I don't just run locally and use TRAMP, I am doing a lot of python debugging, dap-mode with debugpy is a vastly superior debugging environment to gud-pdb, and dap-mode is broken on TRAMP.\n    submitted by    /u/jsadusk  \n [link]   [comments]",

The post contained information about working code demonstrating the concept.\n I hope that was some misunderstanding on the mod part. But if this post is deleted, then I'll have my answer.\n    submitted by    /u/atamariya  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "After finding org-roam-ui, I was interested in how that package created a webpage that displayed information from, and interacted with emacs. From what I can tell, org-roam-ui uses simple-httpd and websocket.el to create a webserver which is used to transfer information between the page and emacs. \n I wanted to see whether I could use that general idea to create a dashboard/launch page for emacs. Ideally, I would be able to make a page which could display my org agenda/calendar in real time, give me buttons for a few commands, display information from my ledger file, and let me search my org and roam directories. \n I don't have a very good understanding of how this works however, and my limited grasp took me just far enough to create a webpage, start the webserver in emacs, and access the page. I had wanted to start small (maybe a button that runs some arbitrary command or displays a message in emacs) but I don't even know where to start with that. \n I was wondering whether anyone had any specific resources that might help, or advice as to how I might tackle this? I'm reading more into how webservers work on my own but I'm a little lost.\n Any help would be appreciated!\n    submitted by    /u/shipley7701  \n [link]   [comments]",

I've been using task management paradigms to fulfill the missing context of the tasks in the agenda. Until I found this article recently Task management with org-roam Vol. 5: Dynamic and fast agenda which was really helpful. Ironically, I had seen it even before but i didn't give it much attention because I assumed it will be deadly slow. After applying it, my agenda has become a little bit slower, but it was just fine. After this, I learned that using org-ql for the agenda (instead of org search) makes it faster up to 5 times, and there is cache support. Now the agenda loading speed is no longer a problem, and each task has full context and relation tags to its categories.\n    submitted by    /u/larrasket  \n [link]   [comments]",

So that would delay the next time that shortcut will come up.\n If a shortcut became a part of their regular use, the review time would get so long, they never see it again (so they're not wasting time learning shortcuts they have already internalised).\n I've been using a very rudimentary and undocumented version of this for some time, and I've found it an enormously helpful tool to help myself learn keyboard shortcuts.\n Interested to hear if others would find this valuable, or if this is something only I'd find worthwhile.

If you aren't aware, this is a package that provides functionality to mu4e similar to Gmail's \"schedule send,\" which sends emails after a designated amount of time, rather than immediately. In addition refactoring the codebase, this package is also compatible with Org-msg. There are other differences, and they are enumerated in the newly-renovated README.\n The original repository may not be maintained anymore, and has been inactive for the last several years at the very least. I use the package myself but had to clean up and update the code so it works with current Emacs.

What I've done so far:\n  \nhave elpaca clone hyperbole from the source repo (\"https://git.savannah.gnu.org/git/hyperbole.git\")\n manually symlink the /kotl, /man, and /test folders from the /elpaca/repos/hyperbole directory to the /elpaca/builds/hyperbole directory (elpaca doesn't do this for some reason)\n  \nHas anyone here gotten this working? I've dug around in the source code and hyperbole-run-test doesn't seem to be mentioned much outside of a defal clause in hypb-ert.el itself. I'd greatly appreciate if anyone here has any insight!\n    submitted by    /u/Mortal_Scum  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I've been using a package called super-save in Emacs, which automatically saves the buffer whenever the Emacs window loses focus. While it initially seemed like a convenient feature, over time, I've come to realize that it's not always the best idea. There have been instances where I made mistakes in a file, such as accidentally removing a large number of lines, and when I clicked on a different window, the result got automatically saved without me noticing. This has led to some unexpected and unwanted changes in my files.\n I'm curious to know if anyone else has had similar experiences. Have you used super-save or any similar functionality, and did it prove to be useful in your case? I'm trying to weigh the benefits and drawbacks before deciding whether to continue using it. I believe that pressing the good old C-x C-s key combination is the best option. What do you think?\n    submitted by    /u/zoliky  \n [link]   [comments]",

The latter has a history entry in its manual ((info \"(erc) History\")) and thus sheds a little bit of light on its age:\n  \n7 History\n  \nERC was originally written by Alexander L. Belikoff and Sergey Berezin. They stopped development around December 1999. Their last released version was ERC 2.0.\n ...\n 2006\n ERC 5.1 was released. It was subsequently included in Emacs 22.\n  \nrcirc on the other hand is missing such an entry, but the copyright starts at 2006, roughly around the inclusion of ERC within Emacs. If you searche the Emacs manual for IRC, you end up with two mentions, one within Acknowledgments for ERC, one for \"Bug Reference\":\n  \n3. Setup for IRC channels configurable by the variable ‘bug-reference-setup-from-irc-alist’. The built-in IRC clients Rcirc, and ERC, are supported.\n  \nNowhere within Emacs do I find a comparison why there are two, and whether there are different use cases for both.\n With that in mind: what are the (architectural?) differences between ERC and rcirc? If ERC already existed, why was rcirc also included in Emacs?\n Thanks in advance!\n    submitted by    /u/qZeta  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I just wrote a blog post trying to separate the Zettelkasten method as a note-taking method (among other things) and other note-taking methods developed for other possible purposes and with different mechanics. Basically the main argument is that any note taken in obsidian, logseq or any other \"digital brain\" app is not necessarily zettelkasten.\nIt is written from a somewhat fundamentalist and provocative point of view, basically because I understand that there is a commercial rise in the indication of note-taking as a miracle cure, which can be very frustrating for people who embark on setting up a Zettelkasten unnecessarily.\nThe article is written in Spanish, but as we all know, it can be automatically translated online using the different online translators available today.\nI would like to know what you think of the proposal.\nLink to article: https://tdg.hypotheses.org/359",

The images look like this:\n\n\nAll images protected by copyright 4.0 (enforced by Interpol, Blackrock, the Illuminati, my secret identity and third personality). So, to the lurker who likes to \"borrow/bite\" other people ideas:\n\nI'd like to improve my visual game.\nI'd like to stop pestering Christian if I need something more pretty.\nSometimes, I use using software as a creative technique.\nIn few cases, I just want something pretty for myself.\nAnd what is better than appropriate skills by just buying shiny tools? Currently, I am looking at OmniGraffle. But perhaps, you have something way better for visuals like the above?\nMany thanks\nSascha",

I discovered the Zettelkasten method a while ago and was very interested in it, and I wanted to introduce you to my \"study method\" (actually it is much more comprehensive than a study method).\nI did this method in the format of a planner or agenda, which can be downloaded in PDF at www.researchsheets.wordpress.com\nThis planner has 10 sections, but the method I want to show you corresponds to \"section 7: Research sheets\". They consist of a template similar to the Cornell method in appearance (top margin, left margin and bottom margin), but with a totally different operation, since these \"Research sheets\" will serve us to hierarchize and breake down the information, and then add it to a glossary / thesaurus in Microsoft Excel.\nThe procedure itself is somewhat difficult to explain, so I prefer not to confuse you further and invite you to download the planner and go directly to section 7 - Research sheets.\nAs I said at the beginning, I think it has some similarities with the Zettelkasten method. I hope my method is useful to you and I am available for any questions or comments.\nThank you very much for reading me!",

I am currently doing my doctoral thesis in \"social studies\" and I came to the zettelkasten method by different youtube content creators.\nThrough my work I have always been interested in the worlds of productivity and the articulation between educational processes and difficult resources of intellectual work. In fact, a few years ago I have been blogging on this last subject, although I do not publish very much on it: www.tdg.hypotheses.org .\nClearly for those of us who are knowledge workers at different levels (and especially if that knowledge is academic knowledge) I believe the zettelkasten method is really essential and definitive. Luhmann's productivity clearly demonstrates it and I do not understand how the teaching of the method in depth and in a practical way is not part of the educational grids at the university level.\nCurrently, along with researching and implementing the method in order to support my doctoral research, I am thinking of opening an extracurricular and open course at my university on digital tools for intellectual work, study and writing techniques, time organization resources and other skills and technologies to be \"taught\" by Twitch. There are already many students who have shown interest in the proposal and I love that it's on Twitch since I think I'm a bit of a geek despite my age.\nFinally, this semester I have also created a discord community (in Spanish) for postgraduate students from Latin America. If anyone is interested, I leave the link in case it works: https://discord.gg/c7CX6TVExH\nI'm glad I found this community and I'll be participating in it frequently for sure. Thank you so much!",
