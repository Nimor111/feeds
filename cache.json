          "description": "I was playing with the Brick terminal UI library and hit an interesting hurdle. Roughly, brick represents the program logic as two functions Event -> State -> IO State and State -> Image.\n I have some non-trivial IO (loading and parsing files, possibly transitively) which should not block key inputs. We can launch some async IO and send the results into an event queue which Brick reads from. But it is really annoying:\n  \nThe update function must know which async resources to load, duplicating parts of the rendering logic\n The update function must track which resources are already loaded\n The update function must track which requests are in-flight, or have failed\n Optionally, the update function may have to cancel requests that are no longer needed\n  \nThat's quite a bit of complexity for a simple update function! My approach so far has been Haxl-like. There is a function CoreState -> IO AppState which is run after every event is processed, and it re-loads all resources. Requests are represented by a GADT, and cached in an MVar wrapped map. A functionsend :: MonadAsync r m => r a -> m (Maybe a) retrieves the existing result, or starts a new request unless one is in flight. When a request finishes this queues an event so Brick updates.\n This solves some of the complexity issues but still feels kind of ad-hoc. Shouldn't Haskell be better at this sort of thing? Is there some existing approach to this?\n The only idea I had so far is some kind of declarative IO. The render function produces an Image, and the frame-work diffs images and produces some imperative commands to synchronize the world. Maybe the render function also could produce a sort-of free-monad trace, the trace is diffed, and the framework performs some imperative steps to ensure the minimal necessary requests are performed? But for diffing to work trace would have to contain which case-statement branches were taken, not sure how to do that without compiler support.\n    submitted by    /u/Tarmen  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "So I've been working on my hobby programming language and there's three things I want to write for it: a type checker, type inference, and a program synthesizer. While writing each of these I realized there was a lot of similarity in the code to the point that it almost felt like the same thing three times. I realized if I was working in Prolog I could probably express this as typed(term, type, errorList) and then I could get supply a term and a type to see if if type checks, a term and an empty error list to infer the type, and a type and an empty error list to get program synthesis. It would be nice to be able to express this relation in Haskell with a similar style and elegance but I'm not sure if it's possible since I'm not sure if I can do logic programming with similar levels of optimizations in Haskell. logict doesn't seem to do any kind of optimization and I'm guessing this would make my code unusable in practice.\n Is my assumption that logic programming without optimizations is unusable in practice correct? Does anyone know if it's possible to do logic programming in Haskell that has performance comparable to Prolog?\n    submitted by    /u/Isaac22877822  \n [link]   [comments]",

Memoization will work only when this specialization is performed. So, disabling optimizations will spell death to a program that relies on memoization of a polymorphic function.

          "description": "Sam Derbyshire has a cool type-checking plugin called if-instance that lets you branch on whether a constraint is satisfied with the following interface:\n -- 'IsSat cls' returns True if 'cls' is satisfied, and False otherwise. type IsSat :: Constraint -> Bool -- | 'dispatch @cls₁ @cls₂ a b' returns 'a' if the constraint 'cls₁' is satisfied, -- otherwise 'b'. type (||) :: Constraint -> Constraint -> Constraint class cls₁ || cls₂ where dispatch :: (cls₁ => IsSat cls₁ ~ True => a) -> (cls₂ => IsSat cls₁ ~ False => IsSat cls₂ ~ True => a) -> a type IfSat :: Constraint -> Constraint type IfSat cls = cls || () -- 'ifSat @cls a b' returns 'a' if the constraint 'cls' is satisfied, and 'b' otherwise. ifSat :: IfSat cls => (IsSat cls ~ True => cls => a) -> (IsSat cls ~ False => a) -> a \n Now the catch is, anyone can add an instance at any point because of the open-world assumption and this will change the behaviour of your program if the branches are functionally different. This plugin basically goes against the design of type classes but sometimes that is what we want. One safe use of this technique is to branch on extra-functional properties such as space, time, energy like choosing HashSet a if Hashable a is satisfied.\n But let's not only stick to safe use cases, what application can you think of for this plugin??\n    submitted by    /u/Iceland_jack  \n [link]   [comments]",

You can learn more about it at [1].\n Copilot 3.11 introduces a new library, copilot-interpreter, that isolates all functions related to simulation of Copilot specifications. The release also contains a number of bug fixes, provides a simplified API, deprecates outdated elements, removes unused code, and introduces support for GHC 9.2. A full list of changes merged is available at [2].\n A substantial effort is being made to achieve NASA's Class D software classification, most notably in terms of development process (which you can partly witness in how issues and PRs are being handled on our github repo), test coverage (mostly with quickcheck), and proofs of correctness of the generated code (with what4).\n Copilot is being used by the Safety-Critical Avionics Systems Branch (D320) of NASA Langley Research Center to conduct experiments related to flight safety of aerial vehicles. We have also built Ogma [3], a tool that allows us to generate full monitoring applications (e.g., NASA's Core Flight System [4] and Robot Operating System [5] applications) from requirements in structured natural language.\n We invite you all to explore Copilot, to try it, and to extend it.

          "description": "Some weeks ago, I asked here, if there is a way to let GHC infer backwards constraints from instance declaration, i. e. for instance  instance (A a) => B a where  have not only forall a. A a => B a, but also forall a. B a => A a. It's correct, provided that we have no overlapping instance for B. In answers there were a link to an article on this topic. However, implementation from the article requires essential changes in GHC. I found some way to make this with currently available extensions (mostly type families) with not so much boilerplate and now uploaded it on github with my solution for the first problem from the \"Motivation\" section of the paper.\n However, I think, it's not quite natural. If this method is general enough and can be automated, it seems me very nice to have an GHC plugin or even GHC extension to make this without any hacks in code. For example, such syntax of class declaration:  class {-# BIDIRECTIONAL #-} A a where  will make all instance of this class bidirectional (and forbids overlaps).\n What do you think about it? More concrete questions: - are there any other (beside this article) conversations about this feature? - does this feature sound reasonable enough to implement it? - what are disadvantages of using bidirectional instances, besides it conflicts with overlappable instances? are the overlappable instances for most of classes (for example common classes from base) really used in haskell?\n I ask this to gather more pros&cons for this feature. If it will considered to be useful enough, maybe I'll try to implement it. Anyway, it's nice for me to learn more opinions about this.\n    submitted by    /u/Lev_135  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello everyone, I write Haskell as a hobby. I am still learning and some concepts are still very hard to understand for me. Since I mostly write Javascript for my day job, I recently got into a very interesting problem. I had to write some logic in where as set of data has to be checked through multiple other datasets and return a value or null at the end.\n When I thought this through in imperative way, I found that I have to write a massive set of if-else logic which might end-up being an \"if-else hell\" and quite unmanageable to in future. Since I knew I can chain a Maybe monad through multiple function using bind operator in Haskell. I ended up implementing something like this in JS. Here is the Maybe monad implementation \n class Maybe { __value; constructor(value) { this.__value = value; } static from(value) { return new Maybe(value); } isNothing() { return ( this.__value === null || this.__value === undefined || this.__value === false ); } just() { return this.__value; } do(f) { if (this.isNothing()) { return Maybe.from(null); } return Maybe.from(f(this.__value)); } \n }\n With the help of this I can do something like this --\n Maybe.from(1) .do(prevValue => prevValue === 1 ? prevValue + 5 : null) //return Maybe 6 .do(prevValue => prevValue > 5 ? prevValue * 2 : null) //return Maybe 12 .do(prevValue => prevValue > 10 ? prevValue + 30 : null) // return Maybe 42 .do(prevValue => prevValue > 100 ? prevValue + 5 : null) // return Maybe null .do(prevValue => prevValue < 100 ? prevValue + 50 : prevValue * prevValue) // will do nothing here .just() // return null since failed on 4th step \n Is my understanding of Maybe monad implementation correct? How similar it is considered to Haskell's implementation of Maybe monad?\n    submitted by    /u/Small-Shirt898  \n [link]   [comments]",

I understand specific use cases, but I'm having trouble gaining a general intuition of what monads and applicative functors do. For example Typeclassopedia says \"the structure of a Applicative computation is fixed, whereas the structure of a Monad computation can change based on intermediate results\". By \"structure of computation\", do they mean that it behaves similar to an if-else statement? Like if b from (a -> m b) is 5, then do x, otherwise do y.\n What I took away from Graham Hutton's video on applicative functors was that they basically are an extension of fmap but for multiple arguments. This made sense, until I thought about the List applicative. pure (+) <*> [1, 2, 3] <*> [1, 2, 3] equals [2, 3, 4, 3, 4, 5, 4, 5, 6], which makes the \"multiple arguments\" angle confusing. I know that applicative functors can \"embedded\" functions into context, and that's why the result of the List applicative was so, because of how it models nondeterminism. But idk it just hasn't \"clicked\" for me yet.\n I was wondering someone could explain the intuition behind monads and applicative functors.

The problem is that most of these methods make no direct reference to c, but rather RawContext c and/or RawConfig c, which makes them ambiguous.\n One solution to this would be to instead use functional dependencies ``` class Context context rawContext rawConfig | context -> rawContext, context -> rawConfig, rawContext -> context, rawConfig -> context, rawContext -> rawConfig, rawConfig -> rawContext where\n ... ```\n but this would result in pretty cumbersome type signatures, which I want to avoid.\n Is it possible to get clean type signatures, as in a class with only one type variable (the wrapped context type) without resorting to AmbiguousTypes?

I have a simple data structre like this: data Document = Document { title :: String, content :: [String], wordCount :: Int } I want to have besides the default constructor where I have to provide a title and the content another one where I just have to provide the title and the content or just the title. And I also want to have a constructor function that creates out of a completely different data structure a Document. I find it pretty nasty to name all these constructor functions differently. Especially since I encountered this problem with a lot of different data structures. So I decided to use ad-hoc polymorphism provided by a generic type-class: class Factory a b where ‏‏‎‏‏‎‏‏‎‏‏‎­ create :: a -> b Which I use like this: instance Factory String ([String] -> Document) where create title words = Document { title = title, words = words, wordCount = 0 } instance Factory String Document where create title = Document { title = title, words = [], wordCount = 0 } instance Factory RawDocument Document where create RawDocument{..} = create title (splitOn \" \" content) Now I can use simply the create function everywhere with the defined input types. And it scales nicely with all my data structures. Do you see any problems with this approach? I'm really not sure if I'm missing something. I'm just facing one problem: - Either I define the factories in the same module as the data structure, but then I need to live with the name shadowing warnings for values like title and words (I would hate to name them differently since they describe the same thing) - Or I have a separate Factory-Module but then I have to live with the orphan instance warnings.

That is to say, since Haskell has a very low refactoring cost, it's possible to just scratch out anything (this is a bit extreme) that works, then refactor it into clean code, something that is more difficult in languages with substantial refactoring costs.\n ​\n There's also something that seems to be \"pseudocode-driven development\", i.e, you scratch out something in undefined and error \"todos\", and constantly branch downwards, and the type system might force you to play Type Tetris, but you can often hash something out before you work on refactoring and optimizing it.\n ​\n I wouldn't call myself an experienced Haskeller; hell, by the definition \"you're not a real Haskeller until you've written your first compiler\" I'm not a Haskeller. A question to more experienced Haskellers: is Haskell as a language for prototyping then refactoring a useful definition? If so, what are the limitations of such (a recent project had to be completely rewritten because I lost the ability to understand the code, despite constantly using long variable names)?\n ​\n And if only-okay quality Haskell code can be refactored constantly, can Haskell be sold as a language, for, well, s-code? That's a bit too \"marketer-speak\", as it completely upends common perceptions of Haskell, but the weaker and more polite \"prototype code\" or \"draft code\" might have sway. But the more radical terminology, one, attracts attention, and second, makes Haskell seem approachable (\"you mean I don't have to be a rocket scientist to be productive in Haskell?\").\n    submitted by    /u/Instrume  \n [link]   [comments]",

All versions of GHC from 7.6 to 9.4 are supported.\n Release information\n This is mainly a maintenance release. Among other changes, this version improves the documentation in dunai-test. Additionally, a function that was exposed unnecessarily is being deprecated in preparation for its future removal.\n  \nRelease: https://github.com/ivanperez-keera/dunai/releases/tag/v0.9.0.\n \nHackage:\n  \ndunai: https://hackage.haskell.org/package/dunai.\n dunai-test: https://hackage.haskell.org/package/dunai-test\n bearriver: https://hackage.haskell.org/package/bearriver\n \n \nRepo: https://github.com/ivanperez-keera/dunai.\n \n Upcoming changes\n We are synchronizing releases with the Yampa project to ensure that bearriver incorporates any changes added to Yampa. Additionally, the goal is to eventually use Yampa's tests also to give bearriver full test coverage.\n Two changes are being discussed that will potentially affect users:\n - The introduction of a new constraint in VectorSpace in simple-affine-space would alter the type constraints of some functions. See #298.\n  \nA re-structuring of the API to better reflect the purpose of the implementation. This could also lead to a division of dunai into multiple libraries.

It exposes a purely functional API based on ZIO. It was designed to be simple to use, lightweight (unlike Akka, nodes do not form a cluster) and customizable: you can change the messaging protocol, the serialization, the storage layer as well as the source of truth for pod's health.\n It's been working great for us, so I hope others find it useful!\n    submitted by    /u/ghostdogpr  \n [link]   [comments]",

However, I am a bit confused at the moment, that which tagless final approach is the right one. I know there are tons of resources out there which states that in tagless final pattern, we use trait as the algebra with a companion object. Most of the times, developers tend to do the implementations in the companion object as well, or create another class (interpreter) where they implement the algebra's functions. However, I have seen many solutions where the devs replace the trait + companion object combo with class + companion object one. \n Honestly, I am pretty confused which approach is the right one: \n // 1. trait + companion object approach trait Repository[F[_]] { def findAll[A](): F[List[A]] } object Repository { def apply[F[_]]()(implicit ev: Repository[F]): Repository[F] = ev def make[F[_]](): Repository[F] = new Repository[F] { def findAll[A](): F[List[A]] = ... } } // 2. class + companion object approach class Repository[F[_]]() { def findAll[A](): F[List[A]] = ... } object Repository { def apply[F[_]](): Repository[F] = new Repository[F]() } \n    submitted by    /u/t_peter_  \n [link]   [comments]",

The original solution was: (3)\n  (OPCODE_NOP, Instruction.Nop) \n But it turns out the second element of the tuple becomes Instruction.Nop.type, instead of a function as I would expect. My question is why is it so and is there a way to shorten the function (2) with placeholders to something similar to the last code block (3) ?\n -----\n Side note: implementors of Instruction have different argument sets, so currently I split them into multiple groups based on argument sets and handle them using LUTs:\n val handlers_type_reg_reg = List( (OP1, OP1_constructor), .. ) val handlers_type_reg = List( (OP2, OP2_constructor), .. ) val handler_types = List( (OP1, handler_type_reg_reg), (OP2, handler_type_reg), ..) \n So the top-level function would choose a specific function for a group of instructions based on an argument set and call it, the specific function would look up the constructor for the specific instruction and call it.\n Does it look sane or am I missing some beautiful FP / Scala expressiveness?:)\n    submitted by    /u/superdupermicrochip  \n [link]   [comments]",

It's a core tool at my job(for doing Kafka especially), but it was never my favorite; with my background in Python and Go mostly, I did not have a hard time learning enough Scala to write code for Spark and Kafka projects. Specifically, with a lot of example code around the web, it's really easy to find what you are looking for.\n Now I feel like I'm not writing actual good Scala code but a code that only compiles; I only borrow patterns and things I know from other languages, and I think my code is not good quality code, so I'm putting time into learning it seriously, so next time we are writing an application I can make good suggestions about the architecture.\n I'm going to start with the book.\"Hands-on Scala Programming\" I like that it's project-based, so I'll see some enough other than the syntax itself.\n    submitted by    /u/glyphack  \n [link]   [comments]",

A huge number of community-contributed fixes and improvements are included. Furthermore, a ton of work has been put into automating things so that merging pull requests, keeping the documentation website up to date, and cutting releases can be done effortlessly.\n You can see the draft release notes here and the upgrade guide at https://scala-slick.org/doc/prerelease/upgrade.html#upgrade-from-3-3-x-to-3-4-0. The latest docs are at https://scala-slick.org/doc/prerelease/index.html.\n After 3.4.0 is released, the top priority is Scala 3 support, G-d willing. Stefan Zeiger, the original author of Slick, wrote an implementation already, but there is work that still needs to be done to get it ready for consumption. I plan to release the result as 3.5.0.\n After that, I would like to see Slick evolve freely.\n If you would like to get involved, feel free to DM me. Or, help fund Slick by sponsoring me: https://github.com/sponsors/nafg.\n P.S.

This is a near-total rewrite of a homegrown system I've been using with students since 2013.\n The basic idea is that the teacher creates some problems to solve, and some test cases for those problems. The students then implement the functions and can check their work against the test cases.\n A starter file might look like this: ``` object hwExample extends hwtest.hw(\"CS123\"): def userName = ??? \n def square(x: Int): Int = ???\n test(\"square\", square, \"x\") \n def isOdd(n: Int): Boolean = ??? ignoretest(\"isOdd\", isOdd, \"n\")  The student would fill in their name  def userName = \"Margaret Hamilton\"  and then take a stab at the first function  def square(x: Int): Int = x * x  Then run their code to check their work:  Margaret Hamilton Data source: hwExample.tests (remote) Begin testing square at Tue Aug 16 10:12:48 EDT 2022 ..... Passed 5/5 tests in 0.71 seconds. ***** Ignoring tests for isOdd.  Next they change the `ignoretest` to `test`, and take a stab at the second function. Re-running the code, they get  CS123: hwExample (hwtest 1.0.0) Margaret Hamilton Data source: hwExample.tests (remote) Begin testing square at Tue Aug 16 10:15:22 EDT 2022 ..... Passed 5/5 tests in 0.44 seconds. Begin testing isOdd at Tue Aug 16 10:15:23 EDT 2022 .... Test #5 *** FAILED *** n = -21 Expected answer: true Received answer: false Passed 4/5 tests in 0.09 seconds. ```\n Obviously, we also want our students to learn how to make their own tests, so I wouldn't use this ALL the time, but it works great for less experienced students who are learning to program.\n More information at https://github.com/chrisokasaki/hwtest\n    submitted by    /u/chrisokasaki  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi all! I’ve spent last two years working on a lightweight library for configuring a http client and http server to communicate over tls/ssl. I have tested it with over 40+ http clients for java, scala and kotlin. The core library contains only one transitive dependency, slf4j-api, and the remaining part only uses the available classes within the jdk.\n In the past I was required to configure a http client with different configurations depending on the project requirements, such as:\n  \nOne way authentication\n Two way authentication\n Using multiple truststores and keystores\n Using pem files\n Reloading ssl\n  \nTo make it easy to reuse for myself and everyone I thought it would be good to make a library out of it and also contribute back to the community. I wanted to hide all the verbosity away and just provide easy to use builder methods without needing to know how to create SSLContext, KeyManager, TrustManager etc. I initially posted it on the java channel, but I thought it could also be intresting for scala developers.

          "description": "This is a little hard to discuss because emacs and tmux use the term 'window' differently, but in tmux the window is basically your full terminal. So, your terminal might have 6 'panes' across 2 'windows' in a session, with one window containing 2 panes and the other four in a second window. Rather than be in separate floating program windows in your DE though, tmux windows are not visible until you cycle to them. So your setup might look like:\n  ________________ _________________ | | | | | | | | | | vim | node | | st | python | -> :next-window -> |________|________| | | | | | | | | | | watch | ranger | |_______|________| |________|________| \n Is there any way to get this functionality (multiple buffers laid out in different ways in one wm box that can be cycled through) in emacs? (I'm focusing on the GUI version of emacs for now, not particularly interested in running emacs inside tmux at the moment)\n edit: another thing I'm looking for is the ability to toggle 'zoom' an emacs window to fullscreen and back to its place, which I believe is 'c-b z' in tmux\n    submitted by    /u/grep_Name  \n [link]   [comments]",

The unicode glyphs in the prompts look different.\n  \nOS prompt example\n vterm prompt example \n It appears as if the line height in emacs is a taller than the font size. There is an unappealing strip of background colour above the font making it look as if the glyphs don't align.

(From what I understand, upon first starting the server, display-graphic-p returns nil.)\n The workaround that seems to be doing the trick is to add the above to server-after-make-frame-hook. (I tried adding the above to after-init-hook but it doesn't seem to work, and some poking around suggests that when the functions in after-init-hook are run when the server starts, display-graphic-p also returns nil.)\n Now, there are other things I want to run only when starting a new GUI session, so I've kept on adding things to server-after-make-frame-hook. \n Not knowing very much about the way all of this works, I keep thinking this is inefficient. For it seems that server-after-make-frame-hook gets called more often than just when I start what, on my end, looks like a new session: calling magit-commit, for example, will run all of the functions in that hook. \n So, what I'm looking for is some tips on how to activate some bits of my config in all and only the following circumstances: when a new GUI frame is opened but no other GUI frames are. \n One solution I would be happy with, but which I cannot figure out how to create, is to have a GUI dedicated daemon and another daemon, if needed, for terminal sessions. I'd then need to have a way of triggering some bits of my config only when the dedicated GUI daemon starts. \n Sorry if this a bit muddled.

I use helm and use helm actions heavily to accomplish things within a completion session (e.g. moving files, grepping). However, the more I use it, the more I think: it would be much better if it's a full dired!\n I like the multiple column view of `helm-buffers-list`. It in fact just imitates the native `list-buffers`, but in a pretty hacky way (it use spaces to pad each completion items to make it look like a table). I've written my own `describe-functions` and `describe-variables` sources that uses similar hack to give me a column of function argument list/variable value and documentation. It would be much better if we just use `tabulated-list-mode`, or some blend of it and the native `*Apropos*` buffer!\n In general I feel like lots of functionalities are implemented twice, once as a \"feature-full\" package, once as a simplified version in helm.\n My question is then: Is there any completion framework based on the idea of wrapping \"feature-full\" package out there? Do you think this is a sensible idea?\n I haven't looked much into other popular completion frameworks (ivy, vertico, etc), because I get the impression that they're typically at the more \"light-weight\" side of helm so are probably not what I want.

Now I am ready to bring my girlfriend into this hole, but now I have several problems as follows.\n  \nMy girlfriend uses a windows computer, and I have not used a windows computer for six or seven years except to play games, so I don't know how to configure it under windows at all. emacs is known to have a relatively average experience under windows.\n \nI am using doom emacs, except for the most basic operations such as C-bpfnaehk which are adapted by macOS as global shortcuts, I do not know the native shortcuts of emacs at all. My girlfriend had a slight experience with vim, mainly because I introduced her the vim mode in rstudio, she knows yiw, ci} stuffs like basic operation, but she usually mainly uses office, vim mode is just rarely used, and not skilled.\n So if I introduce it to the pit, I'm not sure to introduce her to install the classic vanilla emacs (surely a distribution that uses vanilla keybindings, such as centaur? or the vanilla version of doom?) Do you guys think it's better to let someone who knows a little bit about vim but is not very skilled use vim mode, or let her learn emacs' weird ancient vanilla shortcuts?\n \nFinally, a broad context question, do you guys have any suggestions for smoothing out the introductory curve for someone with little computer background (or even little programming background) to use emacs?\n \n Thanks for your help and I would be much appreciated it for any help and advice!\n    submitted by    /u/FreeAd7233  \n [link]   [comments]",

I did some investigation, created a stackoverflow issue (https://emacs.stackexchange.com/q/72769/38541), got help from the org-mode mailing list and eventually created a bug in the evil-repository for what I guess is the root issue for the behaviour (https://github.com/emacs-evil/evil/issues/1642).\n It's been a bit more than a month now, and nothing has happened, yet the problem persist for me, even with the latest versions of evil and org-mode. However I can imagine that a lot of users use both, evil and tables in org-mode. And as a consequence, more people should stumble upon \"my\" issue and report or support it. So that makes me wonder if there is indeed something wrong in my configuration.\n As you can see in the stackoverflow issue, there is not a lot minimal configuration needed to reproduce the issue. But could there be any other package, configuration, switch, whatsoever that I could add in my configuration that would solve the issue?\n So my question is: Am I missing something here? Is this actually a problem on my side? Or do other people suffer the same problem, but it has not caught traction yet?\n    submitted by    /u/cgrabenstein  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Recently my Emacs has been taking a very long time to start up — often around 8–10 s, and sometimes more. If I close Emacs and then start it up again, the startup time usually decreases to around 5 s, but then it increases back to 8–10 s after I put my computer to sleep. The really curious thing about this is that whenever I try to run esup or a similar profiler, the problem goes away entirely: Emacs starts near-instantly, and the profiler consistently reports around 3.5 s startup time (all of which is straightforwardly due to my init.el). I can find nothing else obvious which might be causing this delay — and, before you ask, I can’t quite remember when the problem started. Does anyone have any other ideas whatsoever as to what might be causing this or how I might be able to fix it?\n (For reference, my .emacs.d is at https://github.com/bradrn/.emacs.d/blob/bef9de6ad27e214fa5972ed220d839721d8febca/init.el; I am using Emacs 28.1 on Windows 10, without native compilation.)\n    submitted by    /u/brdrcn  \n [link]   [comments]",

It supports poetry, pre-commit, pipenv, pipx, pyenv, direnv, plain old virtualenv and pdm, and assigns the correct executable paths to buffer local variables of your favorite emacs packages. It also works for repos that use one or combinations of these tools.\n I hope I can help you delete a bunch of code and dotfiles from your init.el and projects!\n https://github.com/wyuenho/emacs-pet/\n    submitted by    /u/wyuenho  \n [link]   [comments]",

You see, the whole system is so complex, and everything so interrelated, that I feel that if I don't know everything about it, the things I do use will alway act differently from what I expect.

Ideally, to just use some nice theme, with good defaults, not looking for customization at this point. (watched some youtube videos where orgmode looked so much better than mine)\n is theming done per major/minor mode or based on packages or something else?\n any pointers on getting started with org-mode? I am going through orgmode.org rn and got somewhat familiar with the syntax. I am trying to evaluate it and I don't see the value yet. do i need any plugins for it?\n I am confused with the package managers and the options you have and how to import. Is there some rule of thumb I can follow that can help me simplify adding packages? I don't need 'options' right now, I need a 'do it this way, it gets you to 90%'\n I was watching some videos and saw this https://github.com/daviwil/dotfiles/blob/master/Emacs.org, which is HUUUGE. Is there some other resource that I can just start with one piece/package at a time and keep adding more slowly?\n  \nSorry if this was posted before (it must have, I guess, but not recently), but I am after some specific things.

          "description": "I've recently installed elfeed and it works wonderfully. However, I have a question to which I was not able to find answers (either on the package's page or the internet) and I'm pretty sure you would be able to help me with. \n So here it comes:\n Whenever I invoke elfeed (M-x elfeed) it opens both a search buffer (*elfeed-search*) and the elfeed.org file I'm using to list my feeds. This means that, once I've exited the elfeed-search buffer, I see the elfeed.org file there. Is there a way to prevent this file from opening in a buffer (preferably) or to close it automagically when the *elfeed-search* buffer is closed?\n Thanks in advance for all your help.\n    submitted by    /u/Gus_Gustavsohn  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "A struggle that I often have writing prose in Org-mode (or in any text editor with a markup language) is when I need to review things.\n I like to review from a printed copy, I'm better at catching errors that way. I also enjoy the ritual of getting off of my computer, sitting on a desk with printed pages, a red pen, and a cup of coffee.\n For that, I'll export as latex-pdf or odt and print---no big deal. The problem is that when I go back to the computer to make the changes in the file, the positions of the words and sentences are naturally very different from the ones in the printed page. So I have to be constantly switching my view from two texts that are very differently formatted, and that is tiresome. So much so, that I will often make the changes in the odt file on Libreoffice Writer, losing my god-given editing shortcuts, and once they are all done, I'll copy the text and paste it back on my org file. But then I have to be careful with italics and other stuff that will change once I copy the text in the odt and paste it on org. If all I'm doing is writing some informal text, no biggie. But when on an academic writing, messing with footnotes I'd be playing with fire to work in that way. So I end up writing a lot of my academic writer in Writer instead of Emacs.\n The obvious easy solution would be to get used to review from screen, directly in the org file. But that wouldn't help whenever I have other people's review of my text, like advisors and other professors (and a lot of them will require something compatible to MS-Word anyway, for them to use track changes).\n So... any technical solutions of different workflows that I haven't considered? How do you deal with that?\n    submitted by    /u/copperbranch  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "When I open a header or quickly scroll through a newly opened org-file, I can see how the buffer is drawn in a different font-size and color and with all the leading stars shown, and then it is quickly repaired. Why is that? Did I set some hook wrong?\n I managed to capture it in the moment being drawn (see picture). A fracture of a second later, all the headings will look like \"Szenen allgemein\". But this is redundant, I would prefer Emacs not to have to draw everything twice.\n I have custom-set the faces of the headings a little bit bigger and set them to Source Sans Pro font. The colors come from the theme doom-solarized-light. I use org-superstars to change the looking of the stars, but even if I didn't, why are there two stars drawn at first, with org-hide-leading-stars set to t?\n If I add +pretty to the doom module list, this behaviour is gone (although it should only load org-appear and org-fancy-priorities), but then there is some bug, everything gets extremely slow, taking five seconds to load a 1.3M-file and 1-2 seconds to open a header. I don't need org-appear and org-fancy-priorities, so I prefer the setting without the +pretty module.\n Any ideas why the buffer is drawn twice and how I can omit that?\n https://preview.redd.it/izkow5sm1ek91.jpg?width=1137&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ea408f5b52194c8e23d70db50fb5eff91f2cb012\n    submitted by    /u/TiMueller  \n [link]   [comments]",

(Although I'm too much of a dinosaur to have tried it.) \n The customization you can do in VSCode, or any other environment, stands in relation to that which can do in emacs as the sounds you can coax from a referee's whistle stand in relation to the music you can play on a piano. \n But that's not the point. The point is that everything is a buffer -- EIAB. Until one has used emacs enough for that to sink in, one has not really used it, and one might as well stick with VSCode. Pick your favorite shell (bash, zsh, etc.) and make it your default shell in emacs. Then do M-x shell. Start using your new shell. Observe that it is just another buffer. Live with that for a while, until the profundity of it sinks in. Then accept your fate, which is to watch in pity, for the rest of your life, as your non-emacs colleagues struggle to interact with their computers. You're now a deer bounding through the woods, past coyotes chewing their own legs off from the traps they're stuck in. Unfortunately, you can never unsee that vision. Sorry!\n  \n​\n I'm still using Doom because I like the evil keybindings, but maybe one of you can convince me to fully commit!\n    submitted by    /u/bjaminar  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "So, Emacs is reallllly confusing for a new user.\n anyway, \n Here is the documentation I'm following: https://github.com/hlissner/evil-multiedit \n First, I can't find the 'evil-multiedit-default-keybinds' that it mentions. But then I noticed that the commands pallete already shows some keybinds. \n When I try to execute 'evil-multiedit-match-and-next' it shows (M-d) as the keybind. It even says so at bottom that I should use 'M-d' if I execute the command in the pallete by hitting return. But in the actual editor if I try to use 'M-d' it says: 'I-Search Backward: [No Previous Search String]'. \n I have not created any new keybinds myself. I'm just very much working on defaults so far.\n How can I fix this?\n    submitted by    /u/_analysis230_  \n [link]   [comments]",

I started it up and --bang-- it is up. Just like in 1993/4. \n Now this is all using the standard OpenBSD and Ubuntu Emacs packages.

I have made-up my own explanation of Emacs, and I just want to make sure I'm not saying anything blatantly wrong. \n  \nEmacs is more than a text editor, it's a Lisp interpreter. Anything you can code with Lisp, you can do in Emacs. Much like how a web browser is just an HTML (& CSS & Javascript) Interpreter. Anything you can write in HTML, you can make a web browser do. \n However, web browsers are external to your computer. You can use a web browser to edit a photo, but you have to upload the photo, do the edits, and then download the photo again, and that's inefficient. Emacs works completely on your system, using your computer's resources to their fullest potential. A web browser could never make files or folders on your computer, but Emacs can, and incorporate so much more into your system. \n  \nThis is the assumption I've managed to get out of my first few days with Emacs.

I know it's really nothing major, just bothers me a bit and i'm wondering if this is a common occurrence with emacs or is it just my system. It can happen more often when folding-unfolding headers in an org file, just a small delay (~1sec) at random, for the action to perform. Not searching for the magic solution, just wanted to see if it is just me or if i might be doing something wrong.\n Thanks for taking the time to read this.\n P.S. My config is really minimal, just the colorscheme, ivy, haskell mode, yasnippet, auctex and my key maps.

While that works fine I am not able to automatically adjust the internal-frame color to the theme's background color. I can do it manually buy using\n (defun my/adjust_internal_border_color () \"Adjust the internal border color to match the theme's background color\" (custom-set-faces!

But I was debugging a problem with my init file which hadn't loaded completely, had the problem halfway solved but then accidentally suspended the Emacs GUI. Now I have to restart Emacs and redo that work for no good reason.\n Being able to suspend Emacs from a terminal makes sense, but why does this feature exist at all when running it in a GUI? If anything, it seems like some kind of practical joke.\n There doesn't seem to be any way to recover the previous state of the program.

For each article, the worksheet provides space to capture the following:\nAuthors (year)\nRelevant Literature & Theory (Major Points, Topics, Ideas, and Who was referenced?)\nPurpose of the study\nOverview of Study Design (Method, Variables/Key Concepts, Sample - who was studied and how were they selected, Means of Data Collection?)\nMajor Finding(s)\nConclusions, Implications, & Limitations\nNow, here's how I currently structure my zettels:\n\nI include the citation in the title\nI include a \"too long, don't read\" summary at the top\nI write a more expansive entry\nI include my own tags for cross-referencing\nI include related card links\nI include the actual reference\nIn theory, it should be pretty easy to establish a new template where the top part becomes spots for those worksheet areas. The bottom part would largely remain the same, only the tags would allow me to include things like\nWhich lit review this is for (creativity & spirituality, agency & organizational transformation, or if it speaks to both)\nFindings tags and research method tags (e.g., #creativity-spirituality; #quantitative #survey)\nMy own brilliant insights and connections\nEt cetera.\nMy questions for this community are:\nThanks in advance for your help with this one!\nJeannel",

This expanded edition has several new chapters on note making (notice that this is dramatically different than note taking) using a zettelkasten-based (or card index or fichier boîte if you prefer) approach similar to that practiced by Beatrice Webb, Marcel Mauss, Claude Lévi-Strauss, Roland Barthes, Hans Blumenberg, Mortimer J.

The mental work of tranlating also introduces additional friction into the system.\nHow do you deal with this?
