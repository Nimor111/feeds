But how do compilers that generate machine code (or lower to C, or SSA) implement higher order functions? Back in 2021, I found an answer when contributing closures to the Pallene compiler.

This will cause Stack to rebuild dependencies for such plans.\n  \nChanges since v2.15.5:\n Major changes:\n  \nStack 2.15.5 and earlier cannot build with Cabal (the library) version 3.12.0.0. Stack can now build with that Cabal version.\n  \nBehavior changes:\n  \nStack’s StackSetupShim executable, when called with repl and stack-initial-build-steps, no longer uses Cabal’s replHook to apply initialBuildSteps but takes a more direct approach.\n  \nBug fixes:\n  \nFix a regression introduced in Stack 2.15.1 that caused a ‘no operation’ stack build to be slower than previously.\n The hashes that Stack uses to distinguish one build plan from another now include the Cabal flags for immutable dependencies set manually. Previously, in error, only such flags that were unset manually were included.\n  \nThanks to all our contributors for this release:\n  \nJörg Thalheim\n Mike Pilgrem\n  \n   submitted by    /u/mpilgrem  \n [link]   [comments]",

To make sure data is only passed to steps in the right state, it is encoded in the type system. Additionally, in different states, parts of the data may have different types. For example (assume DataKinds and TypeFamilies):\n data State = A | B | C type family Foo (s :: State) where Foo 'A = String Foo 'B = [Int] Foo 'C = String data Bar (s :: State) = Bar { x :: Int, y :: Foo s } \n Now, even though Foo 'A and Foo 'C are equal, and we can have\n atoc :: Foo 'A -> Foo 'C atoc = id \n we can't have\n atoc' :: Bar 'A -> Bar 'C atoc' = id \n This makes sense to me, and I wouldn't want id to be a valid implementation anyway since the whole point of having the state in the type is that data in different states is not equal. That said, it would be nice if there was a way of coercing Bar 'A to Bar 'C. We can use record update syntax to assign y to itself, i.e.\n atoc'' :: Bar 'A -> Bar 'C atoc'' b = b { y = y b } \n but is there really no other way?\n    submitted by    /u/svkmpn  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I wrote a library prairie that allows you to work with record fields as regular values. There's a lot of neat functionality buried in here - you can take two Records and diff them to produce a [Update record], you can apply that with updateRecord :: (Record rec) => rec -> [Update rec] -> rec. Fields can be serialized and deserialized, allowing a type like [Update rec] to be parsed out of a JSON response - now you can have your API clients send just a list of fields to update on the underlying record.\n One of those functions is tabulateEntityA, which allows you to specify an applicative action f for every field, and construct a record from that.\n tabulateEntityA :: (Record rec, Applicative f) => (forall ty. Field rec ty -> f ty) -> f rec \n Several folks have recognizes that the form Applicative f => (forall ty. Field rec ty -> f ty) is a concept on it's own: the ability to distribute the type constructor f across each field of rec. In other words: the power of Higher Kinded Data without needing to incur the complexity costs for operations that do not require it.\n There is one last concern: the name. We have the concept, we have many functions that operate on the concept, but none of the proposed names have stuck out to me.\n I've got a GitHub issue to discuss the matter here: https://github.com/parsonsmatt/prairie/issues/16\n And I'll back-link the Reddit discussion here to GitHub so we can keep everything correlated.\n    submitted by    /u/ephrion  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'll explain why. Every other programming language forces the programmer to keep track of time in order to read and write the code. There is a notion of when things happen that needs to be considered, and this often makes it hard to re-use code and leads to unexpected interactions. Haskell code, on the other hand, requires no notion of time. Haskell code is tenseless, inert. Haskell code doesn't do things. Haskell code merely means things. That made it easier to learn, read, and write than other languages like Java or even Python and Javascript.\"\n This is the link to the comment -> https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/s/uhjWTq0rRb\n I was curious if there's any resource that helps you learn haskell the same way the commentor learned.

          "description": "I was presented with Haskell in this semester (I'm in the second semester of college). It was functional paradigma time to learn. All my friends hate it. At first, I didn't like it too. I found it weird, since the first language that I had contact with was C and it is much different from Haskell. Besides, my teacher wasn't a good professor, so this made things worse. But instead of saying that this language is useless, I decided to give it a chance, since there might be a reason I'm supposed to learn it. After that, I end up enjoying Haskell and started viewing it as a new tool and a different approach to solve problems. I told my friends that I would continue to learn Haskell and read books about it during vacation time, and they laughed at me, told me that it is useless, that I'm just wasting my time, that Haskell has no real life application and that I should learn Java if I wanna get a job (we'll learn Java next semester). I felt discouraged because I DO wanna get a job. My mom works very hard so I can only study, and I want as soon as I can be able to financially help her (or at least help her a bit). What I am asking is if learning Haskell will help me in the future somehow or am I just being naive?\n    submitted by    /u/SuspiciousLie1369  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Let's say I have a record type like\n data PosInt = PosInt { getInt :: Int } \n and I want to maintain some invariance about it. Here, that the wrapped Int is always positive (I know in this example I could also use a newtype but bear with me). So (I guess?) the standard approach would be to not expose the type constructor, so only the current module can construct instances of type PosInt. However, I still want to give read access to the wrapped Int, so I want to expose getInt. I might end up with something like:\n module Lib ( PosInt(getInt), setInt) where data PosInt = PosInt { getInt :: Int } setInt :: Int -> Maybe PosInt setInt x | x > 0 = Just (PosInt x) | otherwise = Nothing \n Now if I try to construct a PosInt outside this module, the type checker complains:\n import Lib ( PosInt(..) ) test1 :: PosInt test1 = PosInt (-3) -- type error \n So far so good. But given a PosInt I can actually violate my invariance using the getInt field:\n import Lib ( PosInt(..) ) test2 :: PosInt -> PosInt test2 x = x { getInt = -3 } -- no type error \n That caught me a bit off guard. It's not a problem if I define getInt \"manually\":\n data PosInt = PosInt Int getInt :: PosInt -> Int getInt (PosInt x) = x \n Maybe I misunderstood the role of record fields. This convention of calling them getSomething gave me the impression that they only give read access.\n    submitted by    /u/ngruhn  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "So I've been using Haskell for a while now, I've gotten the hang of monads, applicatives, lazy evaluation, dabbled in mtl, lenses, and free monads, and I've absolutely loved all of it. But there's one single function that perpetually stumps me and I can't seem to understand how it works, and that's fix.\n The definition is\n fix f = let x = f x in x\n Trying to read through some stackoverflow answers explaining this function the closest I could get to understanding it is that the f passed into fix is infinitely composed with itself like so:\n  x = f . f $ x -- or x = f (f x) x = f . f . f $ x -- or x = f (f (f x)) x = f . f . f . f . f . f . f . f . f . f . f $ x -- etc. \n Given this explanation my question is, if a function is infinitely composed with itself, even if we were to have lazy evaluation here, how could it ever possibly terminate? The documentation says something about how fix produces the least fixed point of a function, looking that up I see something about domain theory and don't get any closer to understanding it. This is the one thing I feel like I simply can't get about this language. Can anyone help me out here?\n    submitted by    /u/lucid00000  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have gone through numerous articles on how Scala skills are considered to be niche skill and has scope mostly in Big Data and Data Engineering roles. I would like to get your valuable insights regarding following concerns :\n  \nDoes learning the FP way of designing applications will help me in longer run in SE industry?\n How much emphasis should be given to learning languages or say new paradigm (I am considering Scala to be more complex than Java, maybe because I'm new to FP) when one's goal is to become a good software engineer?\n Regarding the job market for Scala, I don't see much hope in my region (India) other than DE roles. I am still interested in Software engineering but afraid that investing time in it will be helpful in future or not?\n On the extreme side, should I go back to hone my skills on Java ecosystem (prepare for next switch) or focus in learning Scala language and its ecosystem for maybe next 1-2 years and see if I like it or not? \n  \nI tried to keep my doubts as clear as possible. Thanks in advance for your valuable insights.\n    submitted by    /u/Flimsy_Waltz_8259  \n [link]   [comments]",

Then exceptions should be thrown only in rare circumstances as they are a side effect?\n If that’s correct then:\n  \nHow do you evaluate that the circumstance is right for an exception to be thrown?\n \nWhat are the alternative values you provide instead of an exception that can keep the program running?\n \n    submitted by    /u/el527  \n [link]   [comments]",

In theory all the required information to generate the diagram is contained in the type information for all the Halogen components.\n Being relatively new to Purescript, I don't have any clear idea how this could be achieved. But roughly I am thinking that since Purescript is quite weak on the metaprogramming side of things, one would probably have to exploit some FFI and JS to extract the information required to generate the diagram.\n For now I will probably just manually create my visual 'map' with plantUML since I am busy on my own project, however I just wanted to throw the idea out there. Perhaps I will work on it in the future, or perhaps someone else will like the idea and work on it.\n In any case it would be cool to hear from more experienced Purescript programmers whether or not this is possible and how it could be accomplished. I personally think it would be quite awesome to be able to generate visual overviews like that.\n    submitted by    /u/Combination-Western  \n [link]   [comments]",

Either they don't use Emacs at all and thus find the prospect too daunting or they find it too difficult to craft Org Mode into something useful. And this is a real shame because Org Mode is, in my opinion, one of the most useful features of Emacs. So, to help out new users I've created a tutorial geared towards people who are completely new to Org Mode and Emacs. I've included screenshots to show you what to expect as well as a configuration file you can drop in that will give you all the features described in the tutorial. Additionally, there is an org file with explanations of each element, so new users can more easily begin customizing their setup.\n I would encourage any new users to try it out and see if this helps you. For the Org Mode veterans in the crowd, I would appreciate any feedback you might have. \n You can find my tutorial on github here: Org Mode Better Defaults\n    submitted by    /u/he-who-greps  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have a giant org file (~3 megs) with tons of nested headlines, and every so often when I'm zooming around one of them won't expand. Other nearby headlines will still expand, but this one won't.\n I can get around the issue by deleting the collapsed headline and whatever subtree is underneath it, then yanking it back, right where it was. Once I do that, I can expand it just fine, and I won't have the problem again for days. I can't figure out any commonalities as to why this happens. I think it's happened across multiple versions of emacs (running 29.2 now) and org (9.6.25) but because I am a dumbass, I was not exhaustive in tracking the first appearance.\n I doubt anybody will be able to diagnose the issue from what I've written here, so diagnosis isn't what I'm after.

In place of what should have been a buffer for org-agenda-list is a seemingly random buffer.\n Apparently desktop-buffer-mode-handlers can add support for Org Agenda buffers but I don't see an e.g. org-agenda-restore-buffer so I guess on would need to use a custom function? I don't know much programming so hoping someone has found a solution for this.\n I also looked into activities.el but it looks like each \"activity\" is a frame/tab, but for my workflow with a tiling window manager I find it more suitable to liberally create and destroy frames from my window manager's workspaces and for now at least am just looking for a way to restore all buffers/frames/window configuration without the need to create and switch projects. Actually activities.el might be suitable if an activity includes a set a frames. I prefer dealing with frames than Emac's window management because I often work with at least a browser alongside in a window manager workspace and it's just less cognitive overhead to treat each buffer as a frame when the rest of your applications are also managed by the window manager.\n    submitted by    /u/exquisitesunshine  \n [link]   [comments]",

Instead of showing a proper superscripted citation, the generated ODT document shows the underlying org shorthand (e.g., ^{1}). Using a (relatively) minimal example:\n  \n#+TITLE: Manuscript Title \n #+OPTIONS: author:nil toc:nil num:nil \n #+CITE_EXPORT: csl ~/path/to/CSL/styles/american-medical-association.csl \n * Testing \n This is a test sentence with a citation.[cite:@somecitekey] \n This is standard superscript.^{1} \n #+PRINT_BIBLIOGRAPHY:\n  \nThe first sentence will render as (^{1}), and the second sentence will render with appropriate superscript (1). The bibliography will render appropriately according to the CSL style, as expected.\n Interestingly, when I export to other formats such as HTML, the superscripted citations render appropriately—it's only ODT that has issues. Also, unsurprisingly, this isn't an issue for CSL formats that do not require superscript for in-text citations.\n For reference, I'm using citeproc-el and the advanced org-mode-ox-odt fork to export org files to ODT, although I don't know how much of a difference this makes.\n Any help or insight would be greatly appreciated!\n    submitted by    /u/Mortal_Scum  \n [link]   [comments]",

When I'm at the begging of a line, or I'm in a space, I expect that TAB intend to the next TAB line, but unfortunately, it isn't work.\n Does this is a known issue? There is any workaround that I can add to my config?\n If needed, you can take a look at my Corfu configs here: https://gitlab.com/gil0mendes/dotfiles/-/blob/main/config/emacs/g0m-emacs-modules/g0m-emacs-completion.el?ref_type=heads#L96-112 But this file is just a small part of a literal configuration.\n Tks 🤗\n    submitted by    /u/gil0mendes  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I wanted to make a package, mostly for myself, where I could have a bunch of org files that I would use as templates for projects.\n Let's say you want to create a C project. The org file would contain code blocks with a basic hello world file in the src folder, and a basic Makefile or something. The package could also be asked to create a git repo or whatever else you want. You would then call a function, select one of the project templates, be prompted for any optional argument the template may have (like libraries maybe) and create the project structure by tangling the source blocks.\n I managed to make this work, but I hit quite a bothersome snag in the road.\n Makefiles NEED tabs to work. And org discards tabs when tangling, replacing them with 4 spaces.\n I have no way to make this work seamlessly. I can set org-src-preserve-indentation but that makes it so the two space margin added to source block for styling is also included in the final file, so I need to make them all not have this margin, which sucks.\n It also means I need a way to set this variable not only when tangling, but also when editing so org doesn't discard the tab there as well. I made it a file local variable, but it's considered risky so you are prompted to apply it, which is annoying as hell.\n This thing just killed my idea, because I don't like the compromises just for ONE single file type.\n BTW I do know of skeletor's existence, but I think it tries to do too much and ends up being quite bothersome, constantly needing external tools, and not even using built in features like completing-read, and instead rolling its own.\n    submitted by    /u/Guiding2011  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Dear Emacs veterans,\n I encountered a situation like the following. I am working on a project and a tool is used when building the project. The tool requires me to add a line in my `.bashrc` which `source` a script file that does something and source another three files. This means without sourcing the file, that tool is not usable from command line and I can't build the project. Recently, I am learning to use \"compile\" command of Emacs to work on this project. I found because that tool needs that sourcing of the script, I can't simply make use of the tool with \"compile\" command.\n One possibility is to dig through all the scripts involved, figured out what they do, and somehow set them up manually in some fixed way, but this would be a tedious work, also, it'd be not reliable after I upgrade the tool in the future.\n Currently, my solution is that I use `bash -i -c 'the_tool params..'` instead of `the_tool params...`. Although this works for me for the case at the moment, it's not very handy, and I wonder what the better solutions out there that experienced Emacs users will do.\n It seems I can also make Emacs source my `.bashrc` when Emacs starts, but I am not sure if I want to source `.bashrc` every time my Emacs loads, because this tool is only needed for doing a particular type of project development.\n I wonder what would you guys do for this situation. Thanks in advance for you input.\n P. S. I didn't say the name of the tool with an intention that I want to know ways to deal with this as a general situation, instead of learning for example, that a package exists that is for this tool for this situation.\n    submitted by    /u/qiattsik  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I'm trying to figure out how to use org-mode and org-brain together as data management. The extension of the org-mode headings hierarchy into a graph (parent-child-friend) with org-brain is great for me. But now I'm needing something very data-intensive, in my case I need to create an inventory which will easily have thousands of items. I am working for an apartment complex and I need a way to inventory all the fixed and non-fixed assets. I don't want to just go with a relational database or even a spreadsheet. Yes, org-mode/brain is text- and file-based, so each inventory item will be a separate file or heading in a file, but I don't want even more separate files and/or headings for each inventory item's details. One idea I had was to create a lisp defvar symbol for each inventory item (e.g., screens, garden hose, picnic table, etc.) and have a list (a-/p-) assigned to the variable with additional info, e.g., '((size xxx) (count 10)...). But then I've got a huge amount of global variables going on in an Emacs session. This seems impractical, but, hey, I've seen crazy data management stuff done in Emacs lisp.\n Another idea is to do the items as org-mode/brain files or headings, then put item details in an org-mode table -- and rely on the whole org table ecosystem. Another idea is have item details in a custom drawer in a file or under a heading. Another is have very broad inventory categories as variables, then attach huge lists of lists of lists to each variable. (e.g., custom-set-variables in my init file with hundreds of lists.) In general, the Lisp world is wont to leverage the abstract syntax tree, and org-element is there to help with that. But where does my situation fit in, is my question.\n    submitted by    /u/teilchen010  \n [link]   [comments]",

Well, it just seems like whenever I have to do anything slightly outside of my normal routine it's a lot more work and complexity to figure out than I want. I'm busy and I just don't have a lot of time to tinker. Some people do which is great, but not me. \n For org mode all I really need is folding. Folding and the ability to move levels of folding around easily. Is there something like this that works well with markdown or something that would make more sense for me? I used VIM for years, maybe it's worth another try? \n This isn't a complaint, Emacs is really cool. I'm just wondering if I should stick with it. \n    submitted by    /u/Odd-Distribution2887  \n [link]   [comments]",

A big benefit Emacs Org Mode seems to be the built in functionality for things like tasks and times, but that can be done in Obsidian with plugins like Dataview, for every other functionality Org Mode has like that can be done with an Obsidian plugin. I've also read a lot of comments that you can make your own Org Mode functionality using Elisp, Obsidian OTOH uses JS for plugins and code snippets, and I've written a handful of my own snippets. the JS library ecosystem is much larger.\n I get that Emacs has been around for much longer and the Lindy Effect where things that have lasted a long time are likely to last for much longer, however there seems to be far less support for Org outside of Emacs (besides Neorg). OTOH there are many Markdown editors and libraries, so if I decide I want to switch from Obsidian then I could and my Markdown Notes would render fine. I have many notes and don't have much proprietary Markdown in them. What if I became heavily invested in Emacs but in the future felt like using another editor? Or the slim possibility of Emacs development eventually stopping? A lot of Org Mode functionality seems to be specific to Emacs / Emacs' environment (same thing Obsidian JS really). I read one comment saying that implementations outside of Emacs are half baked, like support for Vim motions and features outside of Vim and Neovim.\n I've been spending lots of time setting up Neovim, and right now I'm thinking of using that with Obsidian for Markdown editing with Vim motions.

I have tried to set the ssh session timeout to nil via `(add-to-list 'tramp-connection-properties '(\"/ssh:\" \"session-timeout\" nil))` but so far it does not seem to yield the desired result.\n The setup in which I work features a jump host, so that I connect via SSH twice (once to the jump host, than to my actual destination).

They aren't incorporated into the text smoothly like in a real latex document; when the math has sub and/or superscripts it gets a vertical offset relative to the main text and the font doesn't match the main text either. Equation environments are not as bad, the difference compared to the main text is less obvious there.\n I had the idea to solve this problem using unicode math. There are unicode symbols for basically everything math related, and they blend into the main text nicely, even the sub and superscripts. I managed to set up org-mode to latex export to work with unicode math using the answers in https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/20062/exporting-unicode-characters-to-pdf-using-latex-from-org-mode . The only remaining question is how to write unicode math efficiently.\n I have a nice latex setup that mostly relies on abbrevs and yasnippets. It is very straightforward to set up analogous abbrevs/snippets for common unicode math symbols in org-mode, problems only come when I try to implement sub and superscripts. These work in a completely different way in unicode. Instead of having to surround things with {} or _{}, there are separate sub and superscript versions of many symbols. Should I just make sub and superscript versions for each of my snippets + all the regular letters and numbers? There has to be a simpler way. I also came across the package https://github.com/astoff/unicode-math-input.el that seems to do somethings similar to what I want, however it does nothing about the sub/superscript problem.\n    submitted by    /u/acosmicjoke  \n [link]   [comments]",

I've had a few crashes over the years, mostly (I believe) caused by memory issues, as my daily driver has only 8 GiB of RAM and I have loads of Firefox Tabs and PDF files open in zathura (some documents display better there than in pdf-tools).\n I'm not sure if switching to the Lucid toolkit will be more performant, but all the advice I see online seems to encourage its use in daemon mode. However, I'm worried about losing a little functionality like viewing HTML mail in mu4e and similar.

          "description": "I spent a lot of time reading and thinking about if I want to learn Emacs or Vim since they have very high learning curves, I went with Vim because I had been looking a way to better edit text. Vim's modal editing is very powerful, allowing me to make lots of changes to text with only a handful of keystrokes. I wonder if that's why most Vim and Neovim users chose it over Emacs and if that's why Vim is much more popular than Emacs.\n Emacs is a modeless editor and you need a third party emulation like Evil mode for modal editing, but that's not full Vim. You wouldn't be able to install Vim or Neovim plugin, especially ones that extend its modal editing capabilities like the Vim surround plugin. Perhaps it might be possible to use the headless Neovim backend for text editing in Emacs, like the VS Code Neovim extension or Firenvim Firefox addon does, but why do that when you could just use Neovim?\n I think that all the extensibility Emacs has to make it essentially an app platform alone isn't something that appeals to a lot of users, but what if Emacs had modal editing as good as Vi / Vim's from the start? It seems like Vi Vim and even Neovim never had the level of extensibility as Emacs does, so what if it was a matter of picking between a modal editor, and a modal editor with lots of extensibility? (an oversimplified hypothetical comparison but still).\n And by the way, what was the rationale for the decision of Emacs to be a modeless editor rather than a modal editor?\n    submitted by    /u/TheTwelveYearOld  \n [link]   [comments]",

I attempted to install Emacs and Org Mode using Homebrew --cask emacs and emacsformacosx, but encountered an error. So, I followed the tutorial on https://josephdubon.com/blog/how-to-install-doom-emacs-macbook-pro-2023, and it worked, but I don't want Doom, I only want Emacs and Org Mode. How can I achieve this?

          "description": "When I met my husband 10 yrs ago, he was everything I ever wanted. We met on a freenode IRC channel. He was a Gentoo and Linux-from-scratch dual-booter who could install both systems with his eyes closed. We used to have long, romantic conversations well past midnight about tabs vs spaces and open source. Our first fight ever was about MIT vs GPL licensing. On our first date, we shared our tiling manager config files with each other (this was the first time I truly felt love for a man).\n However, lately he’s changed into a husk of the man he used to be. He migrated to Linux Mint, because, and I quote, he “just wants to get work done” and he “no longer has time to fiddle with [his] system”. Then, he started using GNOME for the same reason. This was already very suspicious. I mean, if he truly just wanted to start using a full DE, he could have at least picked KDE, right? Even Xfce I’d have been ok with.\n Then, the other day, our relationship hit a breaking point. Here I was, working on my 2012 NixOS thinkpad, and hubby calls me over to his office. He said he “wanted to show me something”. I sit down on his chair, and you can imagine my terror as he pulls up vim on his terminal. He had a weird smile on his face, as if something had taken him over. He spent the next few mins “showing off” a variety of vim tricks he’d just learned. I had to turn my face to the side so he wouldn’t see the tears drying on my cheeks. Let me be clear: This was NOT the man I married.\n Our relationship has had its ups and downs, but I never imagined my husband would stoop so low as to become a vim peasant. I don’t know what to do. Part me says I should just start divorce proceedings and get it over with, but the other part can’t help but wonder if perhaps my husband is being afflicted by some serious, undiagnosed mental illness.\n Please advise reddit, my whole life is in shambles and I don’t know what to do\n    submitted by    /u/gentoogirl  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm sorry not using it for more than those 2 things, please have mercy with me. \n So back to my idea. That email \"client\", well actually it is just a viewer, the receiving and sending part would have to be done with offlineimap, sendmail and friends:\n  \nthere are different orgmode files, e.g. ~/org/mail/inbox.org, ~/org/mail/sent.org, ~/org/mail/drafts.org and all of them contain headlines which actually are emails, but they are just rendered as headlines.\n The headline includes the subject, but could also include some state such as READ or SENT\n The body is the text of the email\n Attachments? Use org attachment to add them\n Maybe we could also use properties for recipients or use the tags, I'm unsure about this one \n a scheduler would iterate over those files every few minutes/hours and actually sends that email (headline) \n you can archive an email, which would actually just refile it, or you could also move things around like refiling\n I don't know if you can partially set some parts of the buffer to be read only, I don't know if it would make sense to set all those files to be read only, hmm\n use org capture templates to write a new email, depending on the cursor position it would either be a reply or new mail\n  \n   submitted by    /u/Valuable-Date-896  \n [link]   [comments]",

I used to write (too many) jupyter notebooks with VSCode but I find that I can organize my code & notes better with org documents and just simple Python files. I started using emacs-jupyter after reading Martí Bosch's blog on the topic. My current workflow is just opening up a python file (or write a new one), then running `jupyter-run-repl` and then `jupyter-repl-associate-buffer`. Then I do execute a region or execute line-by-line via `jupyter-eval-line-or-region` bound to `C-c C-c`. The thing with this workflow is that the jupyter REPL gets quite long as I'm tweaking little things about the graphs or visualization I'm working on. Is there a better workflow that people use for doing this kind of work?

So this probably doesn't help.\n  \nSome questions:\n  \n1) Are there any commonly used concise terms around this whole \"editor as an application interface\" concept in general? \n ...it could be either specific to emacs, or more broadly for other editors too.\n \ne.g. We have some pretty common terms like \"CLI, TUI, GUI, desktop-app, web-based, mobile-app\" etc that are used to quite clearly denote the all the common interfaces...\n So I'm hoping there's some easily-Google-searchable short term for this stuff too?\n \n 2) If you know of any specific guides/learning resources on the topic, please share a link (or name I can search).\n 3) I'm guessing that emacs is the #1 GOAT when it comes to how well it can do this stuff? But curious what other editors can also do this, and how they compare in abilities?\n 4) Amongst the variants of emacs, which is best for this? For my use case it needs to work just as well on Windows as Linux.\n 5) Also feel free to share any personal anecdotes on what discovering this paradigm meant to you personally. \n Including where you've seen big improvements in usability/efficiency etc\n And maybe also were there any specific use cases where you over-estimated how useful it would be? And you went back to the mainstream types of interface for something?\n \n  \n   submitted by    /u/r0ck0  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I am going through the Emacs Lisp Intro manual to consolidate my Elisp knowledge. In the \"More Complex\" section, the function \"copy-to-buffer\" is suggested as a case study. I will include it here for your reference:\n (defun copy-to-buffer (buffer start end) \"Copy to specified BUFFER the text of the region.\" (interactive \"BCopy to buffer: \\nr\") (let ((oldbuf (current-buffer))) (with-current-buffer (get-buffer-create buffer) (barf-if-buffer-read-only) (erase-buffer) (save-excursion (insert-buffer-substring oldbuf start end))))) \n Perhaps I do not understand well how the save-excursion works. But, since we are setting temporarily the current buffer to the \"buffer\" argument by using the \"with-current-buffer\", and we are erasing its contents with \"erase-buffer\", why do we use \"save-excursion\"?\n After we use \"erase-buffer\" don't we get point, point-min and point-max set to 1?\n It seems to me that it is just redundant to save the excursion inside the empty buffer when all the points have the value 1. Then why do we do that?\n Thank you very much.\n EDIT: I think that I understand the reason of save-excursion in this case. It is a user-friendly feature. It ensures that after pasting the text in the empty buffer, the point is set back to the value 1. I guess it is a just to avoid confusing the user by having the point set to point-max. When the user switches to the buffer where the selection was pasted, the users will see the beginning of the buffer instead of the end.

To simplify things, she has started to develop arthritis-like symptoms that will get progressively worse, and she will lose her vision over time. \n She's not very technical, but I know there are a lot of interesting ergonomics modes like xah-fly-keys, or even just spacemacs style bindings with a leader key. I'd love some recommendations for relatively easy to learn ergonomics systems that might be less intimidating to newer users. Right now I'm leaning towards spacemacs because that seems the easiest way for someone who would probably be pretty put off by editing an init.el right out of the gate. \n I also thought that over time she could augment this with speech to text as well as text to speech. I know that there are a number of emacs tools like emacsspeak, but I remember seeing a video on youtube where someone had some hooks into a google text to speech library, and was using ai to send audio clips to chat gpt.If that rings a bell for anyone, please let me know what they were using.

For instance, `import picocli.CommandLine.Command` if the cursor is on Command and I try to go to definition, it just doesn't go there and the minibuffer highlights the Command part for a second. The same thing for the java builtin methods. such as System.out.println. Is there a way to make them work? \n    submitted by    /u/Valuable-Date-896  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "tldr: Don't upgrade your tree-sitter library, otherwise Emacs will crash when loading it. If you've already upgraded tree-sitter, either a) roll back to v0.22.2, or b) rebuild Emacs. If you use a package manager, uninstalling and reinstalling Emacs should rebuild Emacs.\n The latest version of tree-sitter library is binary-incompatible with the previous version, but the ABI version remains unchanged. That means package managers will simply replace the old libtree-sitter.so file with the new one. Then when Emacs runs, this binary-incompatible libtree-sitter.so is loaded and crashes Emacs.\n What should've happened is for tree-sitter to bump the ABI version; then package managers would install the new libtree-sitter.so file alongside the old libtree-sitter.so, rather than replacing it. And Emacs will still load the old libtree-sitter.so. \n Rebuilding Emacs will resolve this issue since Emacs and tree-sitter remain compatible on the source level. Rebuild the Emacs binary and it'll be compatible with the new tree-sitter binary.\n Source: https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter/issues/3296\n (I'll note that please don't reply in the GitHub issue unless you have constructive things to add.)\n    submitted by    /u/casouri  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm realizing that i'm doing more and more things inside emacs and struggle to find a balance of what i want keybinds for. Some stuff is super obvious, like `project-find-file` or Window navigation. But with Org-Mode, Roam/Denote, Magit, Dired and Terminal things, i'm not sure how many functions i want to bind to keybinds.\n Thing is, keybinds are only quicker, if you remember them. If you need to search through which-key, just `M-x` and searching is faster. So, do you tend to create keybinds for most things in the packages you use? Or just for the one or two things you use multiple times a day and search for the rest?\n Additionally, maybe someone can give me a hint if this is possible: Can i come up with a sort of \"custom Command Palette\"? So, like `M-x` but it should only contain commands is specifiy? I find that with things like consult or other packages, searching `M-x` can be hard, when a package provides tens of interactive commands.\n    submitted by    /u/domsch1988  \n [link]   [comments]",

But first, I need to figure out the simple one. \n Why is it skipping the first step?\n  \nAdditional notes:\n er/mark-word and er/mark-paragraph are defined in expand-region code. er/mark-eol and er/mark-bol are my custom functions, and they seem to be working just fine, at least when they are called directly, and not via er/expand-region. Interestingly, er/mark-word is also doing what you expect, when called independently.

Essentially, I want to map my brain. \n In order to keep my files organized, I was planning on keeping my files for each topic in a completely separate directories from the Org-roam directory. I would have an org file in the Org-roam directory that links to that particular file and if there is a relationship, I would just link the org files in the Org-roam directory. In other words, the org files in the Org-roam directory simply contains links to the actual files in my file system and serves as the linker. \n To organize my files in my file system, I plan on using the denote package for its file naming scheme.\n How does this setup sound? Are there any better setup designs that you can recommend? I was thinking about just using denote, but I like the org-roam-ui and I would like to keep everything in separate dirs.

It also provides some config files for Emacs, here: https://nostarch.com/clojure\n It's looking good so far - I vastly prefer keybindings and typing commands than clicking on GUIs (and I sort of already do that with my current \"IDE\" of choice, VSCode), but there are a few features that I'm missing\n Auto-complete, for example: how do I get that?\n Also symbol renaming is so very useful - by symbol renaming I mean how in VSCode you can press F2 on a function or variable name, type in a new name, then the variable/function will be renamed everywhere within the project, in a context-sensitive way - so, for example, if I have a poorly name function named, idk, getVars, I can F2 that function, type in getUserPreferences and everywhere that function is used in any other file within the project will be renamed\n Is that something that Emacs can do in a reasonable way? (e.g. without me having to write a lengthy program)\n EDIT: What an awesome community! Thanks for answers, folks!\n    submitted by    /u/TheLordSet  \n [link]   [comments]",

What I tried was to create a custom minor mode that would change the keybindings to what I want. From my understanding, since this mode is more recently added to minor-mode-alist and minor-mode-map-alist, the bindings in my-isearch-mode-map should take higher precedence than isearch-mode-map. However, when I define it and activate it, isearch bindings still function like the default.\n Here is the link to my code. Be warned, it is not pretty as this is my first time writing a minor mode.\n What am I missing? Is there a better way to do this? I want to avoid hacky solutions to the best of my ability and I don't want to have to go down to route of trying (and probably failing) to remake isearch just to get this one thing to work.\n I am open to suggestions on other packages as well.

I don't know much programming so hoping someone has found a solution for this.\n I also looked into activities.el but it looks like each \"activity\" is a frame/tab, but for my workflow with a tiling window manager I find it more suitable to liberally create and destroy frames from my window manager's workspaces and for now at least am just looking for a way to restore all buffers/frames/window configuration without the need to create and switch projects. Actually activities.el might be suitable if an activity includes a set a frames. I prefer dealing with frames than Emac's window management because I often work with at least a browser alongside in a window manager workspace and it's just less cognitive overhead to treat each buffer as a frame when the rest of your applications are also managed by the window manager.\n    submitted by    /u/exquisitesunshine  \n [link]   [comments]",

The closest I can get to actual functionality is to load an empty file with no extension (that doesn't trigger a language mode), and then run c-turn-on-eldoc-mode. From here I get a null pstring error every time I hover over a symbol. At least that is something. \n Weather the gtags packages are on or off, c-eldoc does absolutely nothing otherwise, besides turning on the \"Eldoc\" indicator. \n I'm wondering if there is backend setup that I'm missing. \n I tried downloading from github and compiling, I get warnings about missing cache functions, and emacs doesn't seem to load it despite the folder being in 'load-path'; I'm not experienced with installing packages this way; that's another issue. \n Mine is from Melpa.\n I'd like to see function signatures from the standard libraries.\n I have an F1 shortcut set for man pages, but sometimes that's overkill, and sometimes the specifics of the function are embedded in a much larger man page of related functions.\n    submitted by    /u/marcusbrodie  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm setting it up on a NixOS Virtual Machine using home-manager: I have two files a default.nix where I say which packages to install and a config.el where I write the configs. Here are the relevant parts from the files:\n default.nix:\n { pkgs , ... } { programs.emacs = { enable = true; package = pkgs.emacs; extraConfig = builtins.readFile ./config.el; extraPackages = epkgs: with epkgs; [ evil evil-collection treesit-auto ]; }; } \n config.el:\n (setq evil-want-keybinding nil) (require 'evil) (require 'evil-collection) (evil-collection-init) (evil-mode 1) (require 'treesit-auto) (global-treesit-auto-mode) \n The issues are:\n When I run home-manager switch I get two issues. The first one is assignment to free variable 'evil-want-keybinding' followed by a reminder to set evil-want-keybinding to nil before loading evil and evil collection (even if I am doing it).\n The second one is that it gives the error cannot open load file: no such file or directory, treesit.\n I've tested and the issues are disconnected from one another. I've been googling around for a day now and I wasn't able to find a fix to either. If any of you may know how to fix I'd be grateful.\n EDIT: Regarding the treesitter problem, I'm just a moron. The default pkgs.emacs is version 28. Changing it to pkgs.emacs29 it works. It does compile and works, but it does still give me issues about evil-want-keybinding.\n    submitted by    /u/Elq3  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I've been looking at trying out treesitter support again (specifically, c-ts-mode), and one thing that's got me stuck is how to modify the rules that are used to highlight the text. c-ts-mode makes some baffling decisions where it deviates from cc-mode in how certain things get highlighted, and I'd like to change this.\n I haven't been able to see anything about how to modify the highlighting so far. c-ts-mode doesn't offer anything like c-ts-mode-indent-style for modifying indentation, and the general treesitter documentation for font lock stuff doesn't really help. The closest I've figured so far is that maybe you can write a mode hook that adds entries to the treesit-font-lock-settings list, but there's no indication if this would actually work, and if so how.\n I'm worried that the only \"solution\" right now is to copy-paste the font lock rules in c-ts-mode and manually maintain a separate copy just to change a couple things, which would obviously be unacceptable. And I can't sidestep the issue by, say, modifying font faces to look better, because the issues I want to fix have to do with poorly-chosen generic font faces for some of these rules.\n If modifying syntax highlighting isn't possible right now, then I'll make a feature request and go back to waiting for treesitter support to be usable. I'm just not sure what part of emacs would be responsible for the new feature. I get the impression that the font lock rule system as it is now makes it really difficult for a major mode to let you extend its rules, so I'm leaning towards it being a treesitter feature request (as opposed to a c-ts-mode feature request).\n    submitted by    /u/ShimmerFairy  \n [link]   [comments]",

Or is the intention that everything should be in a silo, rather than in the default `denote-directory`?\n Either way, I think things could get complicated working in different silos (assuming the goal is to keep them separate). Perhaps what is needed is some indication prepended to buffer-name of the silo - e.g. if the silo is in ~/Orgs/Silo1 and the #+title is \"My plain title\", the buffer name would be \"Silo1:My plain title\". If we were in the default `denote-directory` , buffer-name would just be \"My plain title\".\n Thanks\n Nick\n    submitted by    /u/N1ck_B  \n [link]   [comments]",

When I branch of from 1a into 1a1, it also normally means, that 1a1 (and 1a2,...) provides analysis of greater details of 1a1, which now becomes the main context for all the children. It does not only mean that I got back to the topic of 1a later, while I had made notes about different topics in 1b and 1c in between. Thus, it seems to me there is a playful tension between a formal structure (topic, subtopic, detail and so forth) …",

I was intrigued, and spent some time reading and researching about it, but I just couldn't visualize how it actually worked.\nThen last fall I was helping my wife find a replacement for Evernote for her recipes, and discovered Obsidian. (It was more than she needed, she went with SimpleNote) but I was intrigued by the idea of linked notes. I downloaded it, watched some videos and started putting stuff in it. I had used various programs before, but they ended up just becoming archives of stuff, and not really useful for production of ideas. I'm working to not fall in that trap this time.\nProbably the two most helpful things for me have been Sonke Ahren's book and a few videos by Morgan Eau on YouTube. This is a great place to start \nI am going back to school after retiring, entering a doctorate program. That's a bit intimidating at 53. I've got a couple of masters, but it's been a while. I'm really hoping using Zettelkasten principles in Obsidian will aid me in my endeavor.",

I was out for a walk this morning listening and my small cold heart was warmed hearing The Archive mentioned!    I wasn't expecting it!\nI figured @ctietze and @Sascha would appreciate this. Check it out here.\nI tried to share where they go into talking about it. But, if that doesn't work, it is around 1:05:23",

          "description": "Many note-taking apps like Obsidian provide the graph view functionality to visualize the relation of notes. But this kind of graph view only bases on linkages/references(incoming links and outgoing links) between notes. It is hard to recognize a specific long COT(chain of thoughts)——the starting point, the path and the end. Different COTs crossing in the graph view makes it more chaotic.\nLuhmann's zettelkasten is a \"combination of disorder and order, of clustering and unpredictable combinations emerging from ad hoc selection.\"\nThe graph view(generated by linkages/references) in some ways can represent the aspect of disorder of a zettelkasten. But what is the aspect of order?\n\"The absence of a fixed system of order and, in consequence, a table of contents turned the index into the key tool for using the file – how else should one be able to find certain notes again and thus gain access to the system of references? Not wanting to rely on pure chance requires being able to identify at least one point from which the respective web of references can be accessed. This is the purpose of the keyword index.\"\nBase on my understanding, the aspect of order in Luhmann's zettelkasten is composed of his note IDs and keyword index(register).\nAs so far, I don't find any note-taking apps provide the graph view functionality basing on Luhmann-style IDs and his keyword index——And this is why I created a new Obsidian plugin \"zettelkasten navigation\" recently. I think this plugin , in some ways, represents the real Luhmann way to retrive thoughts and navigate notes in a digital zettelkasten. The other note-taking apps should provide the similar functionality as well in future.\nShowcase:",

This is probably going to be a very direct question, but how do I include in a permanent note the studies that the text or some statement in it discusses?
