          "description": "Hi I am Haskell newbie and I am little bit confused about \"built-in\" types concept in Haskell. Coming from C++ background, I understand \"built-in\" as constructs recognizable by compiler without including external libraries. In Haskell however I see in many literature sources, types like Int|Num| Bool, are treated as \"built-in\", or core language features, though they can be easily \"excluded\", by disabling Prelude module, which in my understanding is just external \"library\" included by default. To add to confusion, some core language constructs, like guards will not even work without including Prelude. On other hand constructs like \n import Prelude() \n foo x = 1\n compiles well, but then what is the \"1\" type in this case (Isn't Num defined by including Prelude)?\n So I guess the question is - Where true (in C++ sense) bult-in language features can be found if at all. And should Prelude be understood as true external library or as \"grey area\" combining both traits of external library and compiler intrinsic syntax. \n    submitted by    /u/klazklaz  \n [link]   [comments]",

This issue is actively impacting my ability to maintain wlhs, so I would appreciate any ideas!)\n For the past few weeks, I and others have been developing wlhs, a set of Haskell bindings to libwayland and wlroots. For the most part, development on my side has run fairly smoothly.\n However, when I tried to build wlhs two days ago, I received the following error:\n $ cabal build Resolving dependencies... Error: cabal: Could not resolve dependencies: [__0] next goal: wlhs-bindings (user goal) [__0] rejecting: wlhs-bindings-0.1.0 (conflict: pkg-config package wayland-server-any, not found in the pkg-config database) [__0] fail (backjumping, conflict set: wlhs-bindings) After searching the rest of the dependency tree exhaustively, these were the goals I've had most trouble fulfilling: wlhs-bindings \n Despite the error message saying that wayland-server is ‘not found in the pkg-config database’, it clearly is present on my system:\n $ pkg-config --modversion wayland-server 1.22.0 \n What makes this strange is how suddenly it stopped working. Two days ago, I couldn’t build wlhs; the day before, I could. (Or at least, I have no memory of it failing before that.) Does anyone have any ideas around how to fix this problem?\n For reference, I’m using pkgconf-2.1.0. (Installed on December 7, so that hasn’t changed recently.) I have also tested several Cabal versions: it fails with 3.10.2.1 and 3.10.1.0, as well as current HEAD. It does succeed with cabal-3.6.2.0, but that version is unusable for me as it can’t handle my custom Setup.hs.

          "description": "Hi, feel free to guide me out but I have a strong feeling Haskellers already have this figured out.\n I'm a python programmer coming from research background. I fell in love with programming and functional programming always had this allure for me. I have read quite a bit on functional programming, Bartoz Milewskis \"Category theory for programmers\" and doing the haskell.mooc.fi\n To learn the things actually, I started writing a simplified version of card game Dominion with python and trying to use pseudo-Haskell approach. Why? I'm more fluent in python for now (especially IO) and a game like Dominion is inherently stateful so I thought this would be a good practice.\n I have record (dataclass in python) called playerState which contains deck, hand, discarcd_pile i.e. things that model individual player. For now, I have a gameState that contains a list of playerStates and central_supply that is global for all players.\n All card effects are pure, often partial functions effect::playerState, someArg->playerState. For example draw::playerState -> num_cards -> playerState. Here is an example of a card that draws one card and gains one card: gainDraw = Card( name=\"Gain Victory point and draw 1 card\", card_type=\"Action\", cost=2, effects=[gain victoryCard, draw 1], ). Now the \"cool part\" is that I have a function play_card:: playerState -> Card -> playerState that simply composes all effects of a card to one single composite function and applies it to playerState. Playing one card is then one elegant transition from state1 to state2 with no intermediary assigments etc. So far so good.\n Now the problem: some card effects modify also the global gameState and not just fields in playerState. Essentially I have globalState containing localStates. What is a common solution in Haskell or in functional paradigm in general to handle nested states? A whole different architecture, lifting types? You can be harsh and say that my domain(ion, sorry had to) modeling is all wrong.\n    submitted by    /u/SkyrPudding  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "One of Haskell's arguably most important and interesting features is lazy evaluation.\n As a novice / intermediate (I started learning Haskell about a year ago and am really enjoying it!), I still can't explain the advantages of lazy evaluation in real world applications. \n After a bit of duckduckgoing, the first benefit that is often mentioned is the ability to create infinite data structures. While that is certainly interesting and fun to work with, it feels somewhat gimmicky to me. As mentioned, I am a novice, so I wonder, are infinite data structures a feature you regularly use in real world applications, and are they important in these applications? By that I mean that they are clearly better to use in that position than code without the infinite data structure?\n Another benefit that is often mentioned is the possibility to define control structures in normal code. To my understanding, this is the case for many monad combinators such as when or replicateM, and so on. Again I wonder how relevant this is in real applications, as most programming languages suffice with a few basic control structures.\n Furthermore, it seems that the monadic control structures still require the do notation to be useful, which is not defined in normal code, and when defining control structures for a new type class (such as arrows), new syntax defined outside of normal code is still required, as arrows seem to have their own special variant of do notation.\n Finally, there seems to be a performance trade off with haskells lazy evaluation, as lazy evaluation inherently has overhead, but might avoid unnecessary calculations. I wonder if these unnecessary calculations could not be avoided by better programming?\n All in all, how useful is haskells lazy evaluation, and is it a feature that should be adopted by other (new) programming languages? Or maybe is that a question that is still being researched / explored?\n    submitted by    /u/gluesniffer187  \n [link]   [comments]",

Copying the build dist over to the new platform and then using a g compiler to build them.\n I am wanting to port ghc to a platform with a c compiler, but no gcc or llvm port. This seems like the best option if it’s still working!\n Anyone know anything helpful?\n Edit: I realise that Hadrian makes this hard…. I’d need a cross compiler to create the build program on the target system….\n Edit 2: I think Hadrian would have to be adapted to generate hc files and makes files. But in all seriousness, isn’t this a good idea? It’s a bit of a barrier porting ghc to new platforms if the bootstrap process involved digging up ghc 6 and working up to 9.\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/jamhob  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello folks,\n First timer here. I'm currently learning Haskell, and I'm practicing doing the Advent of Code 2023.\n I'm a bit struggling with the performance of my solution for 2023 day 6, part 2.\n At first, here's the solution I did a month ago in Go: main.go. Basically, I iterate from 1 to raceTime, and count the number of times where applying a function is bigger than a specific value. Note that raceTime can be pretty big (in my case it's 55826490). The result is executed in a few milliseconds.\n I did the same in Haskell: Main.hs:\n ``` numberOfWays :: Int -> Int -> Int numberOfWays time distance = foldl' (\\acc i -> acc + (travelDistance i time distance)) 0 [1 .. (time - 1)]\n travelDistance :: Int -> Int -> Int -> Int travelDistance hold raceTime distance = if (raceTime - hold) * hold > distance then 1 else 0 ```\n At first, I used fold and I had a stack overflow. I read here and there what the issue was so I switched to foldl'. Yet, this version runs in more than 20 seconds compared to only a few milliseconds in Go.\n I'm not at all comparing Haskell and Go, but I'm trying to understand what makes my solution so slow and how to improve it. Note that I have seen versions in O(1), fair enough but I don't want to implement a solution with better time complexity. I'd like to stick with an O(n) solution for now, to understand what I'm doing wrong.\n Thanks for the help.\n    submitted by    /u/teivah  \n [link]   [comments]",

Monads in Clean are therefore just a helpful tool to facilitate sequences of computations. In Haskell, however, monads like IO seem a bit hacky with their lots of magic in the background, where only the compiler developers themselves probably know how they actually work. This magic has always irritated me and distorted the idea of monads.\n This brings to mind the idea of creating a resource like a file completely referentially transparent as a mere program object, and manipulating it, just as you can do with numbers or other simple values, without actually causing anything outside of the programming. You're just describing the transformations. And only when you actually want to perform all these operations in the real world you add “*World” and continue working with an unique object standing for an entity in the real world.\n    submitted by    /u/ThyringerBratwurst  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "So, I finally picked Scala 3 for my new product and I'd like to share some experience. Overall, it's a tool for reservations. Involves a bunch of CRUD. Nothing special or particularly challenging. The stack was classic \"spartan\": Tapir, ZIO, Quill, Circe, Cats...\n The good:\n Tapir folks nailed it! That's pretty much all I can say about them. ZIO also worked flawlessly. Quill was a pleasant surprise since it was the spot where I expected most of the obstacles. Although, the general documentation of Quill could be improved. E.g. in the context of structure, more examples, etc. But in all fairness, well done.\n The bad:\n Some things do not work quite well with new Scala features. E.g. a lot of hacking around various encoders and decoders for opaque types or enums. Some libraries are still not supported which is bonkers. E.g. I miss Scalamock and Cornichon.\n The ugly:\n Tooling. The neverending story... Let's begin with Metals. Metals is like a... musket. Sometimes it fires, sometimes it misfires, and sometimes explodes straight to your face. In a lot of cases, I had to kill its Java process, remove the target dir., and reimport the project. Funny enough, IntelliJ worked okish. With, few error reports when there are no actual errors. However, the experience is kind of clunkier than with Scala 2. Also, I noticed that sometimes incremental compilation doesn't work quite well and you can end up with some weird behavior.\n The unnecessary: \n Indentation syntax. I don't want to start a rant... especially if I start asking questions about how much time and resources this feature required. Especially, since Scala has much greater \"burning issues\". In all fairness, I didn't see any benefit from having this.\n To conclude: \n The experience was ok, spiced with some rough edges. From a Scala beginner's perspective, I presume it would be quite nasty. Overall, there's still a lot of work to do.\n    submitted by    /u/rom_romeo  \n [link]   [comments]",

Long story short was: he created the users with their password so he knew their authentication infos and was able to login in order to \"see what they can see\", \"check for missing features directly on their account\", \"test out that some specific features would really work for them\" in production, etc.\n But! I changed the way users are created, mainly because the passwords he created were way too easy to guess (without even having to brute force, litteraly everyone could guess the passwords, that's why he could remember them in the first place).\n So he can't login as other users anymore, and he would like to be able to \"do it again\". I already worked on a platform that allowed user impersonation for administrators out of the box but I can't find anything on the internet regarding this subject on the Play framework and Scala documentations or their communities...\n So my questions for you are: have you ever had to deal with an impersonation feature request using silhouette + play framework + scala and if you haven't, do you have any advice to provide on the subject anyway? =D\n Thanks very much for those who take the time to respond!\n EDIT: added essential politeness to my post\n    submitted by    /u/DespicableHarpoon  \n [link]   [comments]",

I allocated max. 12GB to the VM running IntelliJ\n What I am experiencing?\n When I edit scala files in a small size Scala project (roughly 40 files, scala source code + few files generated from the play framework) using playframework 3 & anorm, basically IntelliJ goes nuts, i.e. the CPU usage goes up, the fans rpm go to the maximum (I run TG Pro) to the point where I cannot type continuously - I keep typing, and the characters don't show up for a few fractions of second, then they all appear at once. Clicking anywhere in the editor or in the user interface has a lag. I am using the default JDK that comes with IntelliJ. Cmd+Tab doesn't respond immediately, or it is frozen for a moment then the selection moves quickly a few more icons to right.\n I tried VS Codium + Metals to edit the same project and it is more responsive but I don't like it as much as IntelliJ.\n I also run a Windows 10 VM in desktop parallels and, believe it or not, I installed the same version of IntelliJ and it is more responsive than the mac version. I think I am going to continue on windows in the short term.\n I am just curious about few things if you don't mind sharing your experience:\n  \ndo you use Intellij on Linux and if yes, what is the performance like, assuming that you don't run it on apple hardware?\n if you run IntelliJ on a newer mac with the apple CPU, what is the performance like?\n any suggestions/recommendations on how to improve the performance of IntelliJ on the mac?\n  \nAnd just a side note, because I read the MBP 2019 16\" intel has some problems handling external monitors, I should mention I do use an external 4K Dell monitor, but I do not experience the problems described in this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlUmnVYPcKM .\n Thank you\n ​\n ​\n    submitted by    /u/0110001001101100  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I observed lately that there is a lot of division in Scala community. There are multiple groups of users, some more vocal than others.\n This is counterproductive as people have different requirements, tastes, styles, and backgrounds.\n In my view, this goes against what Scala stands for, a Scalable language:\n \"A programming language designed to adapt to the evolving needs of its users.\"\n However, not all users have the same requirements. There is no one solution for everyone.\n Is there a way in 2024 to make the Scala community more inclusive and accept that every group has its pros and cons for the technical choices they make?\n Here are some groups I observed, mainly around async handling:\n  \nPeople who try to write everything with IO.\n People who keep using Scala Future.\n People who use plain threads / scala-async / project Loom / direct style.\n  \nWhile you may have a preference for one group, we should all agree that there is nothing wrong with choosing one or another. It's just a matter of personal preference and the overall requirements and trade-offs.\n It's essential to recognise that outside the Scala community, some of these paradigms represent the majority.\n For example, Scala Future behave the same as the Kotlin CompletableFuture, the Java CompletableFuture, the NodeJS Promise.\n What's nice about each group is that people coming from Haskell/familiar with IO monad may be at home in group 1.\n People coming from Java/Kotlin/Javascript will be at home in groups 3 and 2.\n People coming from Python will be at home in group 3.\n So, instead of being consumed by division. Can the community be joined by the diversity and cooperation instead?\n It's a Scalable language where everyone can be at home. We all have to win with Scala being a multi-purpose language as it was intended.\n Much love to each of the groups, have a wonderful day!\n    submitted by    /u/Previous_Pop6815  \n [link]   [comments]",

I've looked at a number of conversion tools written by others, and ended up rolling a small(-ish) Perl script to do about 90% of the conversion, from a JSON export of a given TW instance.\n The first TW instance I've converted is a journal of my scale modeling projects. In it, I have future projects, current projects, and completed projects. I would like it if the completed projects (all of which have a tag \"Completed\" on their level-1 headline) were folded. I read in the manual that adding :VISIBILITY: folded to the properties drawer would do this, but it didn't work for me. And, as I already have a tag unique to these headlines, it would be great if I could trigger this based on the tag.\n Is there a way to run elisp code when an org file is first opened, specific to a file, with which I could do this? I suppose it could be done with a hook, but I would likely want code to be specific to a given file.

However, it requires me to reorganize my long org file (which is good, after so many years growing out of control).\n I would like to ask, first of all, somebody with similar experiences, why did you decided to switch to denote? Or to stay with a long org file?\n The long org file works for me in a way that I simply come to the file and search for a particular word, so I can easily access all the results and choose the one I want. I don't even use tags, everything is organized in sectons using headers. How do you make that search easy in denote? I know that using keywords is the best but, assuming that sometimes you are not even 100% sure about the exact word that you need and you type in a few to try.\n On the other hand, small files work better for my mobile (where I sync my notes), specially with zettel notes app, which has similar organization than denote. However, I wonder if somebody has a good experience with a long org file with some particular app for android.\n I'm still trying to decide if switching to denote or staying with my long org file.

          "description": "I'm starting to use column view, and one thing I'd like to see is a column showing when any given captured item was created. Any ideas how to do this? \n FWIW, here's what I've tried so far.\n I had hoped that the Special Property, TIMESTAMP_IA would give me what I'm after, but I can't get that to work. So far I've tried:\n  \nRelying on the fact that I usually clock-in when capturing, and so the datum I want is almost always already there for me, in the form of the start time for the earliest clock entry. But TIMESTAMP_IA appears to ignore timestamps that are part of clock entries. So this is no use.\n Having my capture templates create a property drawer into which gets inserted a new property called CREATED, with value of %u. That does allow me to see the value in column view, but it is under %CREATED, not under %TIMESTAMP_IA.\n Same as #3, but instead of having the CREATED property inserted into the property drawer, insert it into my logbook drawer. That does let me see the value under %TIMESTAMP_IA but bizarrely it then does not display it under %CREATED. \n  \nSo either #2 or #3 could work, but I consider them to be non-ideal. \n With #2, I don't get to use the built-inTIMESTAMP_IA which I get the feeling is really intended for the kind of thing I'm trying to do. \n And while with #3, I do get to use TIMESTAMP_IA, it is at the expense of having to insert my CREATED property into a non-property drawer, which something in the back of my mind says is ill-advised. \n And of course with both #2 and #3, unnecessary duplication is involved since, as I said, the date I want is already staring me in the face in the starting stamp of the first clock entry. Having to go around creating properties for the sole purpose of duplicating and making available an otherwise unavailable variable is, well, naff.\n ​\n    submitted by    /u/TeeMcBee  \n [link]   [comments]",

There is no beorg subreddit, and I can only image that this is the only place on reddit where there would be a decent number of beorg users.\n I have had some issues on beorg when it comes to connecting to my NAS server via WebDAV so I can sync with my .org files on there. No matter what I do, it seems, I get the following error message:\n 'Sync could not be completed. A list of your files couldn't be downloaded from your server. Check that your WebDAV server URL, username and password are correct.'\n I have entered the URL, username, and password correctly, as I have been able to connect using other devices and services. I am confident this is not the issue.\n Some of the (log-contents) mention an SSL error, so I thought the issue might be with the certificate. But since I have managed to use WebDAV with other devices and services, and since I have tried logging in while toggling the 'Allow untrusted certificate', I am not so sure it is a certificate issue.\n I have tried every kind of URL, folder path, and I just can't understand why it isn't working. The settings on my NAS don't seem to be the issue either. I have gone over them, and, as mentioned, managed to connect with many other devices and services.\n My usual URL is something like this:\n https://[DDNS hostname].synology.me/webdav\n I have also tried the following:\n https://[DDNS hostname].synology.me/webdav\n https://[DDNS hostname].synology.me/webdav/[path to my .org folder]\n https://[DDNS hostname].synology.me/dav\n https://[DDNS hostname].synology.me/dav/[path to my .org folder]\n https://[DDNS hostname].synology.me:5006\n https://[DDNS hostname].synology.me:5005\n I have tried using http and smb as well. I have also tried using NAS quick connect and using the external IP address of the NAS.

These hospital computers as you can imagine are locked pretty securely and so its impractical for me to setup Emacs on these computers or run anything from a USB. I have previously used something web based like notion.so but the experience was far from satisfactory.\n I unfortunately fell into the trap of buying an iPad for medical school and I want to make the most use of it. I will ocassionally bring this to placement and would like to be also take notes on my iPad.\n I do often have to look or reference my notes while on my phone. So quick offline access to my notes synced through syncthing is ideal.\n  \nI am currently considering using obsidian.md which uses markdown files. I can then sync these files with my phone and iPad and use the obsidian apps on either device. On my own computer I am thinking of using Emacs with https://github.com/licht1stein/obsidian.el. On computers at placement I am considering having my org files in a private repo on gitlab or github and then using the built in text editor on thos platforms.\n My question therefore is: is there a better alternative for my workflow/use-case that mainly uses org mode files as opposed to using obsidian?\n EDIT: I am open to also using pandoc to convert org and md files as long as the process can be somewhat automated.\n    submitted by    /u/sabikewl  \n [link]   [comments]",

I am a noob, so please do forgive me if I don't come across as competent with orgmode\n If I run a python script on my .org files which creates a new .org file with all TODOs that meet certain property conditions (i.e. all TODOs with the property 'Category: Work')--will emacs consider these TODOs in the new .org file the same as, or different to, the TODOs that were originally copied?\n So, if I had a TODO in .org file 1, and python copied it to .org file 2, would emacs view these as separate TODOs? Basically, if a dynamic block called all TODOs with the property 'Category: Work', would this TODO appear twice?\n I ask because my specific workflow will likely require me to do something like this, and I am wondering if there is a way to do so without emacs thinking they are different. Might one way of doing this be to assign each TODO a unique identifier (UID) so that when I copy a TODO, the UID is copied too? Would this solve the issue of emacs possibly viewing both items as separate rather than the same?\n Any help is much appreciated.

          "description": "Hej fellows,\n I am using Org Mode while learning about Guix via the fabulous Dissecting Guix series, employing Code blocks to visualize what it is I am talking about. However, I noticed two things that REALLY bug me out.\n First off, when I load the org file containing said source blocks, it is slow to the point of unusability UNLESS I first start GEISER-CONNECT with an instance of GUIX REPL hooked up. This leads me to believe that it is independent of org mode and has to do with the fact that it searches for the code to which the blocks reference. Nonetheless, input on this is highly appreciated\n Second, when I use TAB (for org-cycle), I am asked for the currently used scheme implementation - despite the fact that both related geiser variables, geiser-active-implementation and geiser-default-implementation only contain guile. When I choose guile, then the source block contents become read-only, and all subsequent editing needs to happen in a separate Org Src buffer. I have no clue why this is the case.\n I have come to the point where I commented out all code blocks to not have to deal with it, which is obviously not acceptable in the long run. Thus, any input is appreciated :)\n Have a good day, fellows!\n EDIT/SOLVED: I found out the source of the problem. At one point I had opened a lot of files related to Guix and then saved the Desktop file. Then, loading the file would load all those other files including all modes related. For some reason I don't quite understand this literally ground emacs to a halt performance-wise.\n    submitted by    /u/olivuser  \n [link]   [comments]",

I use doom, and after my most recent upgrade & sync when I invoke org-capture and org-roam-capture, the capture buffer (which prompts with [t] for todo, [n] for note, etc) now overwrites whatever buffer I'm working in, rather than creating a minibuffer to handle the capture. It also doesn't seem to respect the custom capture prompts that I have attempted to shamelessly copypaste from a blog configure. Thankfully it's not a fatal issue since a single undo restores the contents of the buffer but it's very strange and annoying! Has anyone else experienced this issue or perhaps know of a fix?

For example I have a tasks note that displays all my open tasks. And I have a homelab note, that lists all ideas and tasks with the metadata \"subject:: homelab\" under headings for ideas and tasks. Also the list of completed tasks in the daily note is auto populated with tasks that have the completed date set to today.\n Now I'm trying to do something similar with org-roam. \n TL;DR: I want to query my org-roam notes for specific data that is marked with metadata and display it in other notes\n Thank you!\n    submitted by    /u/ZunoJ  \n [link]   [comments]",

Maybe some of can weigh in on which path is \"worth\" following.\n Basically, i come from vim and neovim. I've worked with emas and neovim in parallel for years now. I generally enjoy the \"regular\" emacs keybindings for UI stuff. But i feel like i'm lossing a LOT of editing power when leaving evil behind. Yet, getting it to work consistently is a bunch of work and it'll always be 99% at best.\n Now the relevant part. I'm pretty sure i've only scratched the surface of emacs native keybinds. What i find missing is \"simple\" stuff like \"delete between paranthesis\" or \"duplicate this line\". Is this something emacs can \"just do\" and i just haven't found it yet?\n I see 2 ways forward:\n  \nStick with evil and invest the time to create consistent remaps where evil-collection and others don't quite do it.\n Stick to emacs and remap/write functionality i'm missing from vim\n  \nNote that ergonomics are a secondary thought. I have a custom keyboard so arrow keys are still on hjkl and modifiers are on thumbkeys. I'm also not married to the idea of modal editing. In fact, i enjoy not having to worry about modes and just \"type away\". But deleting/changing a specified area is just something i haven't found a good solution in emacs to.\n So, thoughts?

          "description": "Probably it's been asked many times, still, I'm not sure which way should I go.\n I'm hungarian, and my solution to write hungarian in emacs (which I have barely done) was that I just simply typed \"auoeiuo\" instead of \"áúüű....\".\n Lately I started to have the need to write text for others, so using the correct vowels with \"umlauts\" became needed more and more often. It would be amazing if I could just simply switch layout and go on with my life not fighting with my muscle memory. Most often I still use us layout, not only because of the shortcuts, but also typing special characters like \\, [], etc... on hungarian layout really a pain in the ass. On hungarian layout I will almost never use any \"programming characters\", I'm pretty sure.\n The problem I have for example is that \"C-_\" is \"C-Ü\" or \"C-y\" is \"C-z\" on hungarian layout, which doesn't work anymore. I don't want to learn different combinations, neither fighting my muscle memory every time when once a week I want to write some longer hungarian text in emacs.\n I have a feeling that there could be a trick that any time i'm using a different layout, (and probably I should also put a condition that I'm in txt mode for not mess up things like dired or magit), emacs would interpret my keystrokes differently when I hold down C or M. So I would use the same key for typing a single \"ü\" and \"C-_\" for example.\n What could be the simplest way to set up emacs like that? Can you post me a link where it's already answered? I'm pretty sure it's been answered a couple of times, I'm just too stupid to find it.\n Thank you!\n    submitted by    /u/paadam94  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "When typing up some long-form text for entry into a website, I'll sometimes do it first in Org mode and then once I'm happy with it I'll copy-paste it into whatever I'm using. \n However, one issue is that of <NEWLINE>.\n On the one hand, web forms often want to handle line wrapping, and so it wants the user to insert <NEWLINE> characters only if really necessary; e.g. for between paragraphs, list items, and so on.\n But on the other hand, I have Org set up to auto-fill text input (and I'll also regularly give it a hand in that using M-q to run org-fill-paragraph), so I end up with <NEWLINE> characters all over the place.\n Now obviously I could just turn off emacs and Org's auto-fill for the purpose of these situations. But I don't want that. I actually *want* the Org text formatted with the auto-fills, just as it would be if I wasn't creating something for input on the web.\n So, is there a simple way (maybe using export? ) to have the newlines that are not needed (I'm thinking it's only newlines within a paragraph) replaced with what is almost certainly going to be a simple inter-word space? Note , though, that it isn't just going to be the newline that needs to go, but also any following indenting whitespace characters used to correctly position the next piece of text.\n For example, I'd like to have this:\n  1. A line of text 2. Another line of text but this one is long enough to need to be wrapped. And notice that this portion is indented.  converted to:  1. A line of text 2.

          "description": "Hi everyone, I've been trying for the past month or so to get Emacs working reliably and quickly on my High DPI linux machines, but have been struggling.\n Currently I am running into issues with a machine running Manjaro + GNOME (wayland) and the pgtk version of emacs 29.1. When I scale the frame to take up the entirety of my 4k display, I have noticeable input lag, likely in the 100s of ms. When I shrink the frame down, my input lag decreases significantly, and emacs feels snappy. The issue persists when I run emacs with emacs -q.\n At the moment I've resorted to running emacs 29.1 without pgtk, forcing it to run under XWayland. This causes emacs to render at a lower resolution to XWayland, resulting in blurry text when it's finally displayed on my monitor, but results in emacs staying snappy even at full screen.\n I've run into this issue across all my machines, across distros (namely Void, Arch, and Fedora), whenever I try to run Emacs full screen on a 4K monitor attached to a machine running Wayland. Switching to X isn't an option due to the excessive screen tearing that I get at high resolutions.\n Weirdly, compiling and running Emacs on my Windows work machine natively results in the best emacs experience I've had so far, with input feeling extremely snappy and fluid. I don't experience the scaling issues there. Emacs also is working fantastic on an old low resolution laptop that I have running Void with XFCE.\n I've tried adjusting the double buffering as mentioned in this post without success: https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/zgp6kw/gui_emacs_weird_the_bigger_the_frame_size_is_the/\n Any thoughts? Is this a thing that people are running into on high resolution displays with Wayland? Is XWayland the best bet right now?\n    submitted by    /u/sunmoi  \n [link]   [comments]",

I don't even use tags, everything is organized in sectons using headers. How do you make that search easy in denote? I know that using keywords is the best but, assuming that sometimes you are not even 100% sure about the exact word that you need and you type in a few to try.\n On the other hand, small files work better for my mobile (where I sync my notes), specially with zettel notes app, which has similar organization than denote. However, I wonder if somebody has a good experience with a long org file with some particular app for android.\n I'm still trying to decide if switching to denote or staying with my long org file. Any comments would be appreciated.\n    submitted by    /u/teobin  \n [link]   [comments]",

My workflow\n is something like:\n  \nfor each person I regularly meet I have a top level bullet.\n every time I have a meeting with that person, I find the top level bullet, and create a new child bullet, with the date of the meeting and the topic - I have two usual topica, being \"catch up\" and\"review\".\n under that new bullet I type my notes from the meeting. These are usually transcribed from paper notes I make during the meeting.\n  \nE.g\n * Ann Onymous\n ** <2023-08-22 Thu> catchup\n Ann is having fun working on cold-fusion. Needs new peanut butter and\n mousetraps. Says warm weather is interfering with correct function of\n reverse osmosis proton macerator.\n Needs me to sort out climate and mousetraps.\n ** <2023-09-20 Wed> catchup\n new mousetraps have made life better. Climate still not good enough...\n ​\n Having watched (in bits, over a week or two admiteddly) Prot's 'tube explanations, and done a basic installation of Denote, I want to make it work for my note taking needs. I'm in no way wedded to the arrangement shown above. I'd happily have a file per person. But I think Denote wants me to have a file per meeting. But for me, a big part of the value is continuity. I.e. being able to see what happened in previous meetings so I can be sure to follow up on actions, and keep a proxixmate record of outstanding actions and conclusions.\n I think this means that I might use Denote by having a file per meeting, with keywords like \"talking_to_Ann_Onymous\" and then use a dynamic block to gather the rolling textual status. By playing with the frontmatter I could include the date of each meeting. Further, I think I would use the signature fucntions to ensure that the notes are displayed in calendar order.\n Has someone else solved this kind of problem?

Loving it so far.\n However, one thing I wish I could change is the major modes for C, C++, Python, and Shell languages. I tend to get really overwhelmed by how many options are provided because of the maturity of these languages and it's hard for me to really learn their features even with which-key installed. Another sticking point is that they sometimes overwrite custom keybinds that I use frequently, especially c-mode.\n Is there such a thing as a general purpose coding major mode that just provides syntax highlighting with tree-sitter, code folding, and Eldoc info for each language? Maybe this is something that would be easy to hack up by extending prog-mode with only those features?\n Barring that, is there a way to help simplify the major modes like not overriding my global keymap?

Installing the package itself is easy; however, installing the `jdtls` lsp is proving to be difficult. \n Since it is on a work laptop, I cannot provide log messages. My first issue was when the script that LSP runs to install jdtls failed to install due to cert issues. I was able to fix those, but I ran into error `java.security.InvalidAlgorithmParameterException: the trustAnchors parameter must be non-empty`. I tried fixing the cert store, but no luck.\n The next thing I tried was doing `brew install jdtls`. I tried setting `lsp-java-server-install-dir` to the install location of the jdtls binary; however, that also did not work. For some reason, LSP cannot find the `jdtls` in my path, even though it's available globally on my system. FWIW, I am using package exec-path-from-shell, and it's properly configured (other packages that depend on external tools work just fine). \n I was wondering if anyone has had any luck getting lsp-java to work on Mac, especially if you went the `brew install jdtls` route.

Perhaps I'd add them to the `llm` package, perhaps it might require a new package. In emacs-devel@ I wrote up details, including code pointers and a list of interesting questions I'm thinking about.

As a beginner, I want to do things at a relatively raw level, which is more comfortable because I don't feel blindly accepting things where I often confuse different parts and keep doing things the wrong way, and that blindness in my experience often prevents me from using a tool in the most efficient way (plus spacemacs' startup time is too long :( on my already not so powerful computer).\n So I liked it once I found the repo of Ashton. I tried the simplest version from the repository (called \"early-init.el\") and followed its comments carefully. Useful things I found in this file include\n  \nhow to install packages\n how to change the background colour (I didn't do though)\n Others like font face where the repository owner left it blank, but the related function names are there to guide me.\n  \n​\n --------\n Totally unrelated, the Emacs plugins have a very different flavour compared to their counterparts in Neovim/vim. They are structured quite differently. This is how I feel as someone who has tried to learn Vim for a while.

These functions are defined in a .el file that is called from my init.el file. For some reason, when I eval the defun blocks in that file, the function fails to recognize the argument I pass to it (\"tagname\"), but when I copy the code into my scratch buffer and evaluate it there, it suddenly works. I am also able to add the line (defvar tagline \"Project\") and it works in that case as well.\n (defun cj/org-roam-filter-by-tag (tagname) (lambda (node) (member tagname (org-roam-node-tags node)))) (defun cj/org-roam-find-project () (interactive) ;; Select file to open, creating if necessary (org-roam-node-find nil nil (cj/org-roam-filter-by-tag \"Project\") nil :templates '((\"p\" \"project\" plain \"* Goal\\n\\n%?\\n\\n* Inbox\\n\\n** TODO Add initial tasks\\n\\n\" :if-new (file+head \"%<%Y%m%d%H%M%S>-${slug}.org\" \"#+title: ${title}\\n#+category: ${title}\\n#+filetags: Project\") :unnarrowed t)))) \n Essentially, the issue I'm having is I start emacs/load my init file, these functions are defined, and I run cj/org-roam-filter-by-tag. I get the error (void-variable tagname), which seems to come from the lambda function. At this point, if I run (cj/org-roam-filter-by-tag \"Project\"), it evaluates to (lambda (node) (member tagname (progn (or ... ...) (aref node 16)))), which I can then fix be either copying the (cj/org-roam-filter-by-tag) function to the scratch buffer and evaluating it there, or evaluating (defvar tagname \"Project\"). \n This code is taken almost exclusively from system crafters, and I don't really understand the lambda function and what it does. As far as I can tell this seems to be some sort of scoping issue, but since I'm directly calling the function with \"Project\" as an argument, I don't see why I'm getting the \"void-variable\" error. \n I'm a little lost with this issue, and I'd appreciate any help.

I used it for a year and realized that the amount of things to learn is much greater. I learned Vim keybindings, Spacemacs keybindings, modal editing. I also learned the concepts of Emacs, Org Mode, Magit. I realized that some things don't happen so quickly, and I also started to get tired of modal editing and only using the keyboard to perform actions. So, I decided to try vanilla Emacs. I noticed that the contents of the main menu, the button menu and the modeline change according to the position of the pointer, that is, the GUI presents the options in a contextual way. Now I can work effectively using the keyboard and mouse and receiving feedback from the interface regarding commands and key combinations that I always forget. And finally, I gave up on maintaining a configuration file (for now), I learned to use 'customize'. I'm really amazed at what you can do with absolutely no configuration initially! Some advice for beginners (I still am): - Enable CUA mode at the very beginning and migrate to default over time - Learn the concepts (Emacs is a platform!) - Learn how GUI behaves - Learn the key combinations - Learn Org Mode (this is f****** awesome!) - Have a good time!\n    submitted by    /u/Due_Olive_9728  \n [link]   [comments]",

I can jump to the definition of an identifier with xref-find-definitions, and I can see the type of the binding with eldoc or with inlays.\n However, I don't know how to quickly jump to the type of an identifier?\n Rust uses type inference a lot, so the concrete type is often not spelled out in the source code. This means that I don't have the type to use as a starting point. An example:\n rust let foo = build_me_a_foo(); \n Here I would like to be able to jump to the Foo type which build_me_a_foo presumably returns. Today I do this by jumping to the definition of build_me_a_foo and then jump further from the function signature.\n Reading the Emacs manual, I see that I could use C-u M-. to get a prompt for the identifier to jump to. The very large list presented to me does contain what I need, but I need to spell it out based on what eldoc showed me in the mode line.\n Has anybody written the code to look up the type and then feed it directly into C-u M-.?\n    submitted by    /u/mgeisler  \n [link]   [comments]",

Please see the screenshot for examples.\n This behaviour could have been fine, except that they don't seem to function. For instance, the \"section\" symbol does not create a section in the document.\n It looks like it might have something to do with the input method for TeX, since I can find the symbols as \"translations\" of the keywords when I look there. Please see screenshot.\n I don't encounter this problem when using emacs -Q but I also cannot find a LaTeX related culprit in my config, so I'm at a loss. I experience the behaviour both on my personal Linux computer and on my work Mac.\n Does anyone know what might cause this behaviour and how I can disable it?\n In case you think there might be something in my config and want to help me out by having a look, it's available here.\n EDIT:\n Thank you for the help! Turns out it was related to corfu's autocomplete.

And when it freezes, i can only force exit the whole process.\n I THINK EmacsMac tends to freeze more when in fullscreen mode on an external monitor. But each time I think I've pinpointed and resolved the issue, it unfortunately resurfaces.Most stack traces aren't very enlightening, often showing repeated calls to functions like 'mac_gui_loop', 'dispatch_semaphore_wait_slow', and 'redisplay_internal...'.\n Is there anyone who can run Emacs on macOS without experiencing these freezes for >1 day? If so, what hardware are you using? Did you use any special configurations or fixes?\n Does native-compilation or any other flag influences this?\n I plan writing an article about Emacs on macOS, aiming for a stable and consistent environment.

Basically, if a dynamic block called all TODOs with the property 'Category: Work', would this TODO appear twice?\n I ask because my specific workflow will likely require me to do something like this, and I am wondering if there is a way to do so without emacs thinking they are different. Might one way of doing this be to assign each TODO a unique identifier (UID) so that when I copy a TODO, the UID is copied too? Would this solve the issue of emacs possibly viewing both items as separate rather than the same?\n Any help is much appreciated.

After running C-x C-e after the function (unlike without interactive) I can use M-x double-param but after hitting return it does not wait for input for the parameter. It simply exits with nothing in the echo area. Similarly I cannot use C-u 3 M-x double-param to send it the parameter. However, it still works if I call it with (double-param 3) for example I'll see 6 *#o6, #x6, ?\\C-f) in the echo area.\n What am I doing wrong?

It could perhaps be of interest for some people here. While the Emacs keymap in IntelliJ is actually pretty good, there's enough differences that my Emacs-marinated fingers stumble too often while using IntelliJ. So the plugin is meant to be an extension of the existing Emacs functionality, offering around 40 commands that either modify existing IntelliJ commands to be closer to Emacs, or are pure additions to the IntelliJ commands.\n The plugin only makes these commands available, and you can use whichever ones you find useful, either by adding keybindings one-by-one, or by using the EmacsJ keymap installed by the plugin which is an extension of the Emacs keymap and activates all the commands at once.\n The main features are:\n  \nIncremental search modelled on Emacs' Isearch, with text and regexp search.\n Query-replace as in Emacs with text or regexps, with a very light-weight interface.\n Word commands: transpose, upper-case, lower-case, capitalize, move, delete.\n Rectangle commands: copy, open, clear, paste.\n Whitespace commands: delete space around point, delete empty lines.\n Easy access to clipboard history à la Emacs (kill ring).\n A mark history with ability to pop mark (mark ring), and exchange point and mark.\n Duplicate and comment regions and lines.\n Recenter and relocate caret.\n Zap to character.\n  \n​\n The plugin is of course free and open source.\n https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/23181-emacsj\n https://github.com/strindberg/emacsj\n ​\n    submitted by    /u/Stindberg  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello! As a new Emacs user, it seems that I have joined in exciting times with the adoption of treesitter + LSP (which also was my setup in neovim). I have spent some time customizing and slowly get the hang of how minor/major modes work.\n From what I saw, a major mode defines syntax rules for highlighting (similar to treesitter), on-the-fly error checking with flycheck (similar to LSP) and some setup, such as indentation, etc.\n I understand that TS + LSP are still being actively developed and integrated into Emacs and so I accept that the experience using these tools might not yet match that of established major modes. So I am mostly curious about the future.\n If you were to start coding in a new language in Emacs, what would your setup look like? My thinking is to install the treesitter grammar and the LSP plus minor modes for navigation and editing (e.g., lispy for elisp). Would TS + LSP be used instead of the language major mode or in conjunction with said major mode?\n    submitted by    /u/progyam  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I've started using lsp-bridge after months of fighting with eglot and lsp-mode. Both eglot and lsp-mode are great projects, but they have their quirks, and for me, most of them revolve around how slow and how prone to timing out they are, as well as the massive memory footprint that they cause (I've had both of them spawn clangd processes that end up consuming 20-30GB, and so far lsp-bridge is keeping under 10GB, which is fine). This isn't their fault per se--I'm working on an Unreal Engine project and there is just so much going on all the time, and I can easily believe that parsing JSON is the bottleneck. (I know there's a new-ish project that tries to solve that problem for lsp-mode, and I will definitely try that one day if this experiment with lsp-bridge doesn't work out.)\n So, two questions:\n  \nCan I jump to the (header) file under the cursor, or like lsp-mode, cause that header to become a link to the file?\n I have some functions and classes that seem inaccessible because they're wrapped up in a namespace. This isn't true of everything in a namespace, just a few things. That means I can't jump to classes/functions defined in that namespace, and I also get no completion information back. This wasn't the case with eglot or lsp-mode, so I don't think it's a fundamental limitation of clangd.\n  \nOther than that, so far, I'm pretty impressed. I'll work out some keybindings and wrapper functions to see if I can get the functionality that I'm missing, but for jumping around the code, it's significantly more performant.\n    submitted by    /u/vjgoh  \n [link]   [comments]",

I can't seem to translate what I have in my head into code, which is an unusual and frustrating experience for me.\n What I'd like to do is, when I'm specifically working on a Python project, have my frame set up so that there's a main window with the buffer I'm working on, then to the right is a python REPL, and to the left is a switchable choice between an xrefs list and a directory tree. What I'd like to do is set up the position and sizing of all of these by mouse-dragging them to how I want them, then saving that configuration somehow. Then, crucially, having this configuration and sizing be entered when I visit a python buffer and python-mode launches, and exited back to \"normal\" emacs when I leave python-mode except in a couple of instances.\n Has anyone done something like this? If so, could you share your config? I don't know what it is about Emacs's window manager but each one of these requirements has so many moving pieces in different parts of the system that I just have trouble wrapping my head around the whole.\n    submitted by    /u/Venthorn  \n [link]   [comments]",

I check the load-path and see that lsp-mode is no longer its part, even though it was a user selected package. I do a package-reinstall for it, restart Emacs and it no longer starts: on mac, the icon jumps at the bottom of the screen for a second and goes away. Adding --debug-init isn't helpful. Since my package directory is versioned, I git restore it, and it does not help, neither does deleting the ELN cache.\n Then I wipe my package directory and install user selected packages one by one, and everything goes fine until I get to helm-org. Install it, and Emacs fails to start. Restore an older copy of package directory (not using git restore) which does not have it, Emacs starts.

I've been using emacs for about a week, and I like it a lot. I have python 3.11.7 installed as part of my Gentoo Linux install. The Gentoo package manager is written in python and I want to maintain a level of separation between my development environments and the package managers environment. To get lsp-mode and lsp-pyright working, I've created a emacs_venv in my ~/.emacs.d/ folder and then pip installed the lsp-server/pyright stuff to that. Then added that environment to my exec-path and set python-shell-virtual-environment-root to that folder. \n Can I now use direnv to manage project environments? \n Is there a better way to handle separating the Gentoo environment from an environment that emacs needs while in python-mode?\n    submitted by    /u/Usual_Office_1740  \n [link]   [comments]",

They're fine, but I would like to be able to automatically save my desktop every few hours (I use Emacs in daemon mode and basically only close it every 3 weeks or so), rather than manually saving it. Doing (desktop-save-mode 1) seems to have the unfortunate effect of restoring the desktop everytime you restart, unless you explicitally tell Emacs not to.\n Is there an elegant way to have auto-save without auto-restore?\n I have two main ideas:\n  \nEnable desktop-save-mode, but create a shell alias for emacs --no-desktop. This seems fairly straightforward, and I could even add --daemon to the alias since I almost always use that option as well.\n \nCreate a timer for one of the desktop save functions, e.g. bmkp-set-desktop-bookmark. I'm a little unfamiliar with timers in Emacs but this seems like a perfect use-case for them.

          "description": "Hiya! \n I would like to share with you all a little package package I've written here https://github.com/JasZhe/window-stool for code context. \n There's a few similar packages out there like lsp/eglot breadcrumbs, treesitter-context, and topsy to name a few but most of them use header-line (or in the case of treesitter-context, a childframe) which is limited to a single line.\n I really liked how context.vim had a sort of \"cascading\" context style and I didn't find anything similar to it so I figured I'd give it my own shot here. \n To achieve that, this package uses overlays and so it may not be as performant as others, but I haven't experienced too much slowness personally, even on a pretty old 2017 Macbook. \n It basically constantly moves an overlay to be at the top of the window to act like a pseudo multi-line header-line. I also opted to use a simple indentation based heuristic for figuring out the context as a default. There's customization options to specify different kinds of context functions depending on the major mode. I've included a simple one for org-mode using headings. \n In the future, I might try to add some tree-sitter support when I get a chance to dig into it.\n I named it window-stool cause it acts like a little stool that you can use to glimpse the contents above what your window can normally see.\n I've been using it for a little while, ironing out kinks along the way so hopefully there aren't too many issues with others using it, but I'd appreciate any feedback for problems that crop up.

Even SystemCrafters uses it, which to me, is a big vouch for using it.\n However, in reading some other reddit posts about others asking this same question, many people said that it had compatibility issues with some plugins, and relying on vim emulators has always left a bad taste in my mouth from other editors. Also, as a new emacs user, I don’t know how much of the emacs experience changes with evil-mode, and I don’t have the knowledge to be able to thoroughly understand and debug any issues that might come up from using it.\n So, I’m mostly just looking for some affirmation and anecdotes, good and bad, about evil-mode: if it will hurt me as a new user, and generally any heads-ups that could help me.

I suppose the solution to my problem must be fairly easy, but I've only recently started using Emacs for both coding and org mode, and I need some help with my config file.\\\n Basically, I have a \".emacs\" file that I started configuring through tutorials about a month ago. At the time, all I did was assemble together different elisp snippets from different configurations that I found online and liked. Inevitably, I accidentally created a kind of Frankenstein. My main problem is that I have contradictory information in (custom-set-faces) and (custom-theme-set-faces). Now, when I try to change something, it starts accumulating contradictory information and randomly selecting which one to pick.\n I want to clean up my config file, possibly try literate configuration. The problem is that I fear losing all my current configuration and being left with nothing, having to restart from scratch. Can anybody lend me a hand or share some resources?\n Here's my configuration, if you'd like to take a look. Thanks a lot.\n    submitted by    /u/NiceNeedleworker5604  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm a Software Engineer(web dev, full stack) by profession.\nI discovered Zettelkasten in 2020 when I started working on a rather large personal project called MindOS. I was trying to create content in the intersection of philosophy, psychology, programming and rationality. During the research phase, I understood that it was going to be impossible to keep all of this in my mind - even with the note taking method that I used at that stage. I needed a better system.\nThis search led me to Zettelkasten, and I immediately fell in love with it! Since then I have actively trying to encourage others to use it as well. To do this, I have written tutorials, videos, created a couple of tools, etc. But my biggest and most resent contribution is a book I wrote and published a few months back: Zettelkasten and the Art of Knowledge Management.\nMy Zettelkasten Process...\nI have 2 vaults. Everything I learn that is useful for others go into Obsidian - and I publish it as a Digital Garden at https://notes.binnyva.com\nAll my personal information goes into a Logseq graph.

So far I'm largely filling it with ideas I've been turning over in my mind for a while rather than the product of new reading. I've come to the conclusion that these ideas should be sat on for a while before they turn into permanent notes and so a zettelkasten would be unsuitable for learning a new field or subfield, which would be better served by a sort of lab manual or similar (not being an academic, I don't particularly need to preserve citations). Like an accounting system that uses a memorandum sheet, a journal, and then a ledger, with the zettelkasten being analogous to the last.\nI got into this from Scheper's book, but I'm not a purist and I found his approach a little too dogmatic. But what I don't recall from his book or Luhmann's zettelkasten is recording the date each card was written. I don't know if that information is useful, but I've been including it on each card.",

If I recall, I had a reason for this. I don't remember what it was, though. I want to say it was because I was saving \"Theatre\" for like... theatre theory? Anyway, to explain this UID, 13 for literature, 8 for George Chapman being English, 1 for George Chapman the author/playwright himself being the first author and 0 will be for Shakespeare. )\n\n  \n14000 - Philosophy\n\n  \n1401[book#].[Stephanus number(paragletter)]Folgezettel# - 1 for The Republic, 0 for Plato\n\n  \n\n\nI have two separate systems going, apparently, in two categories under Humanities. But they both reflect something important, I feel. \nI was wondering, does anyone else use their UIDs to tell them information about the card? I'm also using a date at the top, in case I can't figure out where to put it when I first make the card [YYMMDD, of course.] Like, the way i use 8 to mean \"England/English\" or 9 to mean \"France/French\" under across History and Literature. Alternatively, 0 could mean Greece and 1 for Plato in the context of Philosophy's 14018.532b1. Just thinking aloud.",

(You can have a badly translated version of my last article here)\nI am building an inventory of training stimuli for that. I am doing something similar like a factor analysis. For many years, for example, my aerobic endurance (roughly, what you normally associate with endurance if you are not into sports science) training was distributed over many different other training sessions that you'd normally not associate with aerobic endurance. Like that I could skip long sessions of running, biking etc. and use that freed up time and energy for other training while still having a solid aerobic base (for recovery between bouts of intensity and between exercise sessions).\nI thought that I'd create something similar for knowledge work. Examples are items like reading physical books, attributes like screen time (to highlight a benefit of physical books over ebooks) or requirements like daily empty time slots (like my dog walks in which I do nothing, but just listen to the sound of the world).\nSo, what should be considered?\nLive long and prosper\nSascha",
