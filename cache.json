Each of those functions can fail, eg if necessary argument is missing, file with wrong extension has been provided, the file doesn't follow the expected format. Based on what I know about haskell, using Maybe type as the return value of the functions seems reasonable to me, Nothing if it fails, Just result if it succeeds. What I'm having trouble with is how to actually utilize this in main. I do something like this\n let proc_args_result = proc_args args if proc_args_result == Nothing then die \"Invalid arguments\" else return() ... -- continue working with processed arguments \n the problem is that if I want to continue working with the processed arguments, I still have the Maybe value instead of the actual value of the result. Alternative is using\n case proc_args args of { Nothing -> die ... Just value -> ... -- continue here } \n but that will lead to uncontrollable indentation\n    submitted by    /u/grandoz039  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi everyone, I'm interested to know about the options for doing 3D graphics programming are, if any. Sorry if this post is all over the place --- in short, I'm just looking for any kind of information, experience and advice related to 3D graphics in Haskell.\n With one exception (see below), all the info/libraries that I have found are a little dated, and I would like to know how to interpret that fact: have the existing 3D libraries/tools just come to a stable stage where they no longer need updating? Or is Haskell not (/no longer) a serious option for 3D graphics? In particular, is the OpenGL library a viable option today, or is it no longer worth looking into?\n Here's some of what I have found so far:\n  \nThe wiki page about Graphics. Unless I am mistaken, the last 3D-related edits on that page are more than 10 years old.\n The OpenGL page on the wiki. Here again the information seems to be a little dated.\n  \nThe exception (to the things I've found being old) is h-raylib, Haskell bindings to the Raylib library. It's very nice, but I'd be interested in knowing about the other options, notably lower-level ones.\n By the way, h-raylib doesn't appear on the Haskell wiki page. Should I add it?\n    submitted by    /u/project_broccoli  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi Haskellers! \n I probably have the wrong idea about Arrows, but at an oversimplified level I had always thought that they were interesting because they \"represent functions as data\" in some sense, which is interesting in that it would allow for composition and reasoning of that data separated from execution (e.g. a composition of Arrows could be inspected and validated or modified before execution). Anyways - under the above assumption I dived in with a real use-case but hit a few hurdles that probably mean I have a total misunderstanding and would appreciate any guidance!\n Heres a small, and yes very dumb example, but hopefully gets at my core misunderstanding - where I am not sure that I can recover the composition of these Arrows. Say we have these Arrows:\n ``` -- Adds 1 to the input plus1 :: Arrow a => a Int Int plus1 = arr $ (+ 1)\n -- Adds 2 to the input plus2 :: Arrow a => a Int Int plus2 = arr $ (+ 2)\n -- A program defined through a composition of arrows program :: Arrow a => a Int Int program = plus1 >>> plus1 >>> plus1 ```\n I'd like to be able to inspect the program, and reason able its structure. For example I may want to find paired compositions of plus1 and replace them with plus2 instead as a sort of optimization, e.g. plus2 >>> plus1.\n Using this very simple example to get a better understanding - is this possible?\n    submitted by    /u/tomwells80  \n [link]   [comments]",

Should they be tested regardless (e.g., because there is no guarantee from the outside that we used deriving to create them, so their implementation may be incorrect)?\n What about if A is defined using GADTs, some other extensions, or contains some constraints? Are there any circumstances under which a datatype definition and instances of standard classes generated via derivation may fail and should be tested?\n Note that I'm not talking about cases where the type is accompanied by user-written functions. In such cases, yes, the functions may be part of the abstract datatype's API and thus must be tested. I'm talking about the datatype definition itself, the constructors, record fields, and instances generated by GHC.\n    submitted by    /u/ivanpd  \n [link]   [comments]",

I’m completely fine with GHCi, I need an IDE where I can “navigate to declaration” to learn quicker. I know VScode has, but unfortunately it doesn’t work for external ones, even Base.hs, IO.hs, etc. IntelliJ idea Haskell plug-in seems buggy, because when I add even one dependency (aeson), it starts complaining about versions and “navigate do declaration” stops working. It seems it somehow tied to lts-18. I tried 8.10.7, but still complains. 2. I’m completely fine with all types of monads, types, and type classes, I learnt about massive compile optimization when I use foldr, main question is how to distinguish tail recursion and non-tail. 3. Where do we store all the libraries. I found Hoogle. Is there only one place, 4. Which libraries we do use for - formatting - linting - other “good things” 5. Do we have kind of “recommended” resources to pass through in order not to ask dumb questions? 6. Do we have kind of stack of libraries which we use in all apps, like in Scala: - cats - cats-effects - fs2 streaming - circe (json) - http4s (http) - postgres, dynamo libraries - etc. 7. Forums, blog posts to follow 8. Other staff I need to know/learn. 9. Is difference between 8 and 9 such big as between Scala 2 and 3. 10.

I want to create small programs that I can compile and run. So many guides and courses seem to rely to heavily on GHCI in my opinion. I understand many people learn this way, but what is the point if I don't know how to actually create a project?\n For instance, I'm trying to follow along with \"Learn You a Haskell\", but quickly got discouraged with all of the GHCI use. I tried to create a Haskell project in VS Code, but I'm not even sure what should go in main!\n I learned other languages effectively because I was able to create bite-sized projects and experiment. I just feel very limited by the approach that functional programming language guides take.\n So my questions:\n  \nHow did you guys learn to actually create, structure, and execute projects? Am I just doing a bad job at looking for this information? Like I said, I'm able to create a main.hs file, but am a bit stuck on what goes after \"main = \" lol.\n Is there a reason so many guides stick with REPL? I've seen this from many FP languages. I've been wanting to learn an FP language but I keep bouncing around because I keep running into this problem. How are people learning these languages without knowing how to set up projects? I just don't feel like that should be an afterthought!\n  \nSorry to rant a bit, just am confused as to why this is the case. Maybe I just learn differently than others, but I find slapping things in the REPL to be a very ineffective way of actually understanding the concepts.

          "description": "I could swear I saw a package a while back for working with non-IO environment types interactively in ghci a while back. Something to run actions in a separate thread and pass the results back to the caller, so that it can maintain a persistent environment yet still be easy to user interactively in ghci.\n I couldn't find anything like that with a quick search, so I started writing my own. It was very simple at first, but as I started addressing more and more edge cases where things could go wrong, I ended up with a lot of subtle things going on. It reached a point where I started wondering if I'm duplicating work, or if it would add value to put what I've done on hackage. So does anyone know if something is out there already?\n For the curious, my work is available at https://github.com/chowells79/shuttle/blob/main/src/Control/Shuttle.hs . I haven't got it to release quality yet, as I'm not sure there is a need to. But I have addressed all the technical edge cases I could think of, which at least is interesting for the curious.

I decided to use Cabal over stack, because I've seen other people use it to good end.\n ​\n So, my first step was to set up the structure of the project and try to see how the imports worked.\n So, I ran cabal init -n followed by creating a src/myfancypkg directory with myfancypkg.hs file, containing a single function. So, the structure of the project is:\n minesweeper |app -main.sh |src |myfancypkg -myfancypkg.hs -minesweeper.cabal \n dist-newstyle folder appeared after running cabal init\n Coming from Go, I got spoiled with the local imports discovery that happens auto-magically. When I try to use my new package in main, I get this error:\n app/Main.hs:3:8: error: parse error on input ‘myfancypkg’ | 3 | import myfancypkg (myhello) | \n I tried figuring out how to fix it, but after two hours of searching and trying I finally resorted to asking the mature crowd.

I am tempted to call it just dbName :: String -> String, because get feels Java-ish. But, from experience, if I go with just dbName, I later get into trouble, for example when I want to call the function and store its value, something like let dbName = getDbName appName, I would have a very hard time figuring out a name for that binding if I called the function dbName and not getDbName.\n So it feels like getDbName is reasonable, but then again, I can't say I am fond of it very much -> I don't have a better idea though.\n What would you do in this case? Would you use dbName or getDbName? If not, why not? Would you maybe put something else?\n Btw, I do put verbs in general, but with most of the other verbs it is clear they should go there, beacuse you are doing some parsing, calculating, migrating, ... .

And I have a few questions. \n This particular service is compiled with GHC 8.6.5 (old, I know, but we have a large codebase we need to upgrade). It is an API service that deals with Postgres (using Opaleye), Redis (using Hedis) and serves data on a Servant based Wai/Warp HTTP server. The service is quite busy, serving in the range thousands of requests per minute (conservative). \n The pattern of memory use looks very odd to me: it hovers around 10-20% for several days, and then it jumps to 60%+ percent. The service still doesn't completely crash, but it seems to me that the memory use spikes out of nowhere and fails to fall. There are sudden falls, but that is due to AWS starting multiple instances of the service (auto-scaling). \n The memory spikes also seem to occur on identical traffic patterns. \n My questions here are:\n  \nDoes this look like a memory leak? I've read previously that GC is not very \"eager\" unless tuned.\n If it does, what are the best ways to catch these early? These are quite problemmatic, obviously, and I've been hunting around for weeks without any success. \n I have tried profiling to investigate leaks earlier, but in this case, I've been unable to reproduce the issue locally or on our staging environment.\n  \n   submitted by    /u/asheshambasta  \n [link]   [comments]",

And of course, there's Don Stewart.\n ​\n What's the secret to getting high performance Haskell? Are the ultra-fast libraries concurrency scams (i.e, C is single-threaded, Haskell is parallel)? Or are the ultra-fast libraries actually as fast as they claim, and that it's possible to get Haskell to near-C speeds? \n Because I love Haskell as a fun toying-around language, given how concise the language (and functional style) can be.

It also helps by providing meaningful merge conflicts for when e.g. different developers modify the same DB objects, among other interesting features. Please check its GitHub for what it can do! \n We've been using codd at PRODA for some months (though we've been using parts of it for far longer in a transition and test period) to apply our migrations, run schema consistency checks and manage our multiple environments' databases, from dev to staging, production and tests. I'd like to thank my friends at PRODA for their support and feedback all this time: it has been invaluable. \n Now I find it's time to release codd to a broader audience, and thought of this community because it's written in Haskell. \n I hope the documentation on GitHub explains reasonably how codd works and its nuances.

To put it mildly, Haskell was everything that I used in the past 4 years. I'd say I'm in an intermediate level in utilizing Haskell. I did my bachelor thesis using Haskell, and doing my master thesis using Haskell again. I also had student jobs in which I taught and programmed using Haskell and Scala.\n I'm starting to ask myself what I'll do after graduating. Do I look for a Haskell job? (I'm based in Germany, and everything I'm finding is requiring to already have many years of experiences in the field which I don't have, and I also found other jobs in cyber security which are related to Functional programming but I have no expertise in that and they always ask for people with experience). This means I can't help but to wonder what I will be doing for living.\n Do I ignore Haskell and fp in general for now? Which other it-jobs could be suitable for someone with my modest expertise? Which other languages should I concentrate at instead? Which IT-jobs should I keep an eye on if Haskell jobs are not within reach? Should I try to find a job in cyber security since many cyber security jobs ask for Haskell developers? Does anyone have a personal experience with my dilemma or any advice on what I must do next? Are there some special platforms for fp programmers who are looking for jobs?

Not many resources turn up with I searched Haskell topics on this so I got my hands dirty. I'm happy with the performance (see some benchmark output below) with my proof-of-concept code, so I decided to turn this into a package (apologies that I didn't spend much work on documenting, in my defense I'm quite excited to share it - expect quality to improve in future releases).\n To use this, import Data.SortingNetwork to bring into scope functions like sortList4By :: (a -> a -> Ordering) -> [a] -> [a] (partial function) and sortTup4By :: (a -> a -> Ordering) -> (a, a, a, a) -> (a, a, a, a) (supporting list / tuple of 2 - 16 elements, but TH module is exported so you can generate more).\n To explain how it works, the implementation took some inspiration from https://doisinkidney.com/posts/2018-05-06-sorting-small.html. For a input size 3, a sorting network (more specifically, my package uses https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batcher_odd%E2%80%93even_mergesort - I'll try to try to have optimal network and other varieties in future releases) would compare and conditionally swap a-b, a-c, b-c in that order (I'm kinda relying on optimization to figure out data dependencies and take advantage of parallelism).

The latter seems like it would play much better with fusion. I didn't check, but perhaps it's more efficient too? Both versions generalize trivially to foldl1', which would be great to add to base if only to define maximumBy and minimumBy in terms of it. Those are currently defined as\n maximumBy :: Foldable t => (a -> a -> Ordering) -> t a -> a maximumBy cmp = fromMaybe (errorWithoutStackTrace \"maximumBy: empty structure\") . foldl' max' Nothing where max' mx y = Just $! case mx of Nothing -> y Just x -> case cmp x y of GT -> x _ -> y {-# INLINEABLE maximumBy #-} minimumBy :: Foldable t => (a -> a -> Ordering) -> t a -> a minimumBy cmp = fromMaybe (errorWithoutStackTrace \"minimumBy: empty structure\") . foldl' min' Nothing where min' mx y = Just $! case mx of Nothing -> y Just x -> case cmp x y of GT -> y _ -> x {-# INLINEABLE minimumBy #-} \n Or am I missing something?\n    submitted by    /u/effectfully  \n [link]   [comments]",

I found it an interesting exercise ... and got some help from this forum earlier - thanks to those people.\n - It's entirely scala CLI. \n The scala-cli part was remarkably quick to get all the of the project boilerplate in place, publish out of CI etc. Even better - it cross compiled (super easily), and it cross platform tests really easily! And has different tests and capabilities for the JVM etc. I think these parts of scala-cli might still be subject to change... but it was amazingly easy / fast to get all of the \"project grind\" in place. \n Ultimately, there wasn't really a barrier, or a reason _not_ to (cross-)publish it - even something this small - and I think that's kind of fun :-).\n    submitted by    /u/quafadas  \n [link]   [comments]",

From what I have gathered so far, the java annotation processor only works with the java compiler and thus java sources. However, I am wondering if there some way to wrap the java annotation processor code in Scala, so that it can be used with Scala classes/sources.\n The use case is a well established library for generating yaml files based on Java class annotations (simple getter/setter classes). I would like to have these classes in scala if possible\n    submitted by    /u/Nice_Rule_1415  \n [link]   [comments]",

So I'm a bit torn.\n If I don't have to solve problems myself, I often just zone out and don't remember much. This is why I have enjoyed Coursera and edX classes. On the other hand, I've also heard good things about Rock the JVM, in general.\n I watched a bit of the free Rock the JVM class on Scala for beginners, and it had you download the code from GitHub that they were writing in the video, but it didn't seem as if they had you do anything other than watch.\n    submitted by    /u/nessus42  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi everyone. I'm just a beginner and I know nobody would recommend me this, cause I'm just a student and although I code a lot (follow tutorials, books and tinker what's taught, CC/CP), I don't have any experience in programming (projects or work with some org or company), but its my 4th sem in college and I found an app idea (won't share cause you guys will hate me for such a common sh*t, hehe jk) and at first and still, I'm following tutorials on flutter and side-by-side java for building mobile applications. I wonder if I could develop an application in Scala. What framework or library I would require, what should be the roadmap for a guy like me and literally any kinda tip, trick, help, advice would be very beneficiary. I personally love Scala (actually learning enough java for scala) and Dart (cause its too similar to scala (Supports OO and FP) but is very optimized for FE (its framework, flutter)) AFAIK. Please feel free to correct me where you get the opportunity, links to resources, articles or whatnot will also be very helpful. \n TLDR; I need proper guidance in developing mobile application using Scala, consider me an overall beginner (never done a project, but code a lot) but a Scala lover. Please take time to write long answer cuase sometimes I'm dumb and I need longer explanations. \n Thank you so much for helping.\n    submitted by    /u/Lokesh112k  \n [link]   [comments]",

People have different opinions about the future direction of Scala but it’s so infected. It’s better to be inclusive and allow people with different opinions. But I guess today’s cancel culture has won. But it hurts the Scala community especially when it really needs to show a good light. Java is becoming much better and heaps of developers are adopting Kotlin and TypeScript.\n Scala 3 is such a great language and it’s such a shame that things like this destroys the image of the Scala community.\n I work as a software architect and have great influence over technical choices. I take lots of factors in to consideration when technologies are chosen.

It echoes exactly what I was seeing in languages like ML, OCaML, and Haskell in the 1990s, what I hoped for procedural languages, and what Scala has become on the FP side.\n What did Functional Programming ever do for us software engineers? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glDudJ3fqLk time: 00:52:26\n I think this video helps explain significant differences between some of the popular languages and why there has been a trend toward FP-type language capabilities and it distinguishes very well between those a typical programmer might want to use and where to leave off from those a library writer might need.\n He uses Scala for examples throughout, so it's very familiar. My only complaint is that the sound volume is too low.

Naturally there will be a lot of overlap with other languages which are also tackling similar tasks. Richard Feldman, in the video, describes a lot of that in a very clear and entertaining way.\n Scala's place in this lineage and facing those issues\n The Scala community has to tackle those same issues.

However, the article was written six years ago for Scala 2.11 and an unspecified version of the JDK. Time flies so fast! Regardless, I have taken the time to update the old benchmark to Scala 3, added some new tests, and run it on Scala 3.2.2 and JDK 19.0.1.\n Here are results: https://gist.github.com/scf37/36a86427697bcf1fdae161edbc2bb2c9\n Some conclusions:\n - mutable.Map and mutable.Set are no slower than their immutable counterparts on all operations\n - Lookups on immutable Maps/Sets are 5 times slower\n - foreach is good enough on Scala collections but is horrible on arrays\n - Vector lookup performance is much closer to HashMap than to mutable.Buffer\n - mutable collections are as fast as their Java counterparts\n ​\n Source code: https://github.com/scf37/scala-bench\n    submitted by    /u/Scf37  \n [link]   [comments]",

[2] is also good that points out some usages that I was not aware of like case class's copy. [3] and [4] are probably the resources that are closest to my expectation because I am looking for materials that I don't need to rely on third party library, and can build/ design the artifact of my own after learning; however, [3] seemingly is not finished while [4] looks like a starting point.\n So I would like to know if any recommended resources (doc, links, videos, and so on) of such topics that fill in this gap? Or diving the library such as cats is the only way to go? I appreciate any suggestions, and commentary.\n [1]. Functional Design Patterns - Scott Wlaschin\n [2].

In this first release, we have\nconcentrated on formatting OCaml code, capitalising on the OCaml\nexpertise within the Topiary Team and our colleague, Nicolas Jeannerod.\nAll development and releases…",

I have been able to get everything working fine when it comes to LaTeX exports, but I would ideally like to also export to HTML.\n In many fields of mathematics it is common for papers to follow number conventions along these lines:\n 1. Section one Theorem 1.1. <equation here> (1.2) Corollary 1.3 2. Section two Lemma 2.1. \n In LaTeX I would typically achieve this behaviour by using the amsthm package, putting this in my preamble:\n \\usepackage{amsthm} \\numberwithin{equation}{section} \\newtheorem{theorem}[equation]{Theorem} \\newtheorem{corollary}[equation]{Corollary} \\newtheorem{lemma}[equation]{Lemma} \n Then LaTeX to produce the outline at the start of this post would look something like this:\n \\section{Section one} \\begin{theorem} <theorem here> \\end{theorem} \\begin{equation} <equation here> \\end{equation} \\begin{corollary} <corollary here> \\end{corollary} \\section{Section two} \\begin{lemma} <lemma here> \\end{lemma} \n This means that in org mode I can just add a few lines to my LaTeX preamble with header options and then just write:\n * Section one #+begin_theorem <theorem here> #+end_theorem #+begin_equation <equation here> #+end_equation #+begin_corollary <corollary here> #+end_corollary * Section two #+begin_lemma <lemma here> #+end_lemma \n However, I've been struggling to figure out how to replicate any of this functionality for the html export. I've been trying to read the code that exports to html to see if there's a good place to hook in so I can add numbers, but I've been struggling to understand how any of it works.\n    submitted by    /u/pjhuxford  \n [link]   [comments]",

The time can be part of the timestamp that triggered inclusion into the agenda, for example \n <2005-05-10 Tue 19:00> \n Time ranges can be specified with two timestamps: \n <2005-05-10 Tue 20:30>--<2005-05-10 Tue 22:15> \n In the headline of the entry itself, a time(range)—like ‘12:45’ or a ‘8:30-1pm’—may also appear as plain text.\n  \nWhich means I don't have to fiddle with timestamp creation to adjust my times for tasks/events and I don't have to worry about going in to a file after capturing something to finish putting in a time range. All I need is a date stamp on a headline and this will work automatically. (You can disable this behavior by setting org-agenda-search-headline-for-time to nil.)\n Somehow I hadn't come across this feature before.

I was wondering whether anyone has a recommened way to set up a remote graphical emacsclient through x2go. I am willing to share my configuration details and other information necessary to get it working. I read through the post here:https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/8t461y/how_to_run_a_graphical_emacsclient_on_a_remote/ which covers the main steps, however, once I run the x2go client, It runs into a blank white screen.

For example, while pcomplete opens a new window for completion it does not switch to it automatically and it does not escape the spaces. This means that every time I have to add quotes myself or escape the spaces manually. I would also like pcomplete to be like orderless and vertico and allow me to select entries the same way.\n I am now using corfu with eshell and it is a bit less frustrating but it is still not smooth as much as zsh completion system is. For example, I have to press escape otherwise I cannot stop the corfu autocompletions once it is activated.\n So my questions are:\n ​\n  \nIs there a way to make pcomplete escape spaces and special characters when completing in eshell? Ideally I should not have to switch to the pcomplete window but it should be done automatically.\n Is there a way to use vertico and orderless, rather than pcomplete, or even in tandem with pcomplete? I would like my eshell experience to be as close to the rest of the Emacs.\n Is there any other suggestion or improvement that makes you life in eshell easier?\n  \n​\n Thank you very much.\n    submitted by    /u/kamui78  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello,\n I am kinda posing a question in the form of a package here: basically, what’s the most efficient way to bind keys? It’s one of those questions I had neglected to ask for so long that I’m a little afraid to ask now, cuz keyboard macros are kind of a core feature to Emacs. Anyway, here's what I wrote:\n https://github.com/Overdr0ne/skey\n I felt like there was a missing define-keys function, so I tried to provide it in this package. Rather than writing:\n  (define-key some-map (kbd \"x\") #'my-func) (define-key some-other-map (kbd \"x\") #'my-func) (define-key some-map (kbd \"y\") #'my-other-func) (define-key some-other-map (kbd \"y\") #'my-other-func) etc...  skey lets you write:  (skey-define-keys '(some-map some-other-map) '((\"x\" my-func) (\"y\" my-other-func) etc...)) \n As of this writing, skey is 9 lines of code in one function. Is there already a standard way to do this? Is everyone just using raw define-key, maybe in a loop? general? use-package’s :bind? Reinventing your own key definers? I explain more in the readme some of the ways I bind keys, but I was just curious how other people are doing things.\n Suggestions for additional features to this package are welcome, but I would be just as happy to learn that there’s a simple, standard way to do what this package does. Maybe add lazy loading by default or something? I dunno, this is kind of a weird post lol...\n    submitted by    /u/SamTheComputerSlayer  \n [link]   [comments]",

I usually have Treemacs on the left pane with code being edited in Emacs on the right.

Sure it's not as great as Codex, GPT-4 and such, but it's a start (there are also open datasets with lots of code https://huggingface.co/datasets/bigcode/the-stack, so maybe in the future the gap will close). \n Maybe we should work on something like this? \n ​\n Very interested in what the community thinks about this in general.\n    submitted by    /u/_puhsu  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm mostly done (probably never fully, but oh well) and trying to nail down some features I'd like.\n The one that's got me going at the moment is binding ESC to `abort-minibuffers` while in normal mode. I've set the `evil-want-minibuffers` custom variable to `t` and would like to be able to exit any minibuffer by pressing ESC while in normal mode, which is not the case at the moment.\n (use-package evil\n :init\n :custom\n (evil-want-Y-yank-to-eol t)\n (evil-want-minibuffer t)\n :config\n (evil-mode 1)\n (define-key evil-normal-state-map (kbd \"<escape>\") 'abort-minibuffers))\n ​\n This is a stripped down version of my evil config at the moment (no further detail needed) along with the best solution I've come up with so far. It works, but I'm guessing that there's a more elegant way to achieve this.\n Bonus Question: The `evil-want-Y-yank-to-eol` variable doesn't seem to be doing anything even if I turn it on. Haven't dug around to find out why yet, but any clues as to why this is happening would be appreciated.\n    submitted by    /u/neeto-kun  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm using vanilla Emacs, I've gone through the tutorial, and watched the System Crafters' Emacs From Scratch playlist. I was wondering if I should switch to a \"distribution\" of Emacs. Would they let me faster navigate text and code, tabs and windows? I actually liked the keybinding of the Emacs more than Vim (Though I use C-jkl; instead of C-bnpf for moving in the text). So I have no problems with Emacs keybindings until now. What additional advantages would Doom or Spacemacs give me over vanilla Emacs?

For instance, looking at the help documentation for a function, e.g. help(list) produces:\n WARNING: terminal is not fully functional Press RETURN to continue \n Scrolling through the documentation is then quite awkward, and even though I hit can hit q to quit, it sometimes hangs and there is some funny indentation going on afterwards (>>> >>>).\n  \n However, if I run vterm, or even just term, enter my shell (which is zsh) I have no such message, and it works just like a non-Emacs terminal, allowing me to scroll and quit comfortably.\n  \n Is there a way to call Python via vterm or term when running a :session in an org-src block, or when doing M-x run-python?

          "description": "Hi, I was wondering if anyone can help me with this weird code completion issue I have in TSX. \n It seems that code completion is not picking up attributes from \"base\" types ie. from `HTMLAttributes` interface that require values like `class`, `style` etc. It will happily autocomplete stuff that can be used naked like `contenteditable`, `hidden` etc. It will also autocomplete props defined in React component etc. \n I've tried this with lsp-mode and eglot but I have the same problem in both. I think my overall setup is fine - everything typecheck correctly and when I put invalid attribute name like \"classx\" it flags it. I've attached few images to show what I'm talking about if my text explanation is not clear.\n Notice that 'class' is missing\n class typechecks correctly\n classx will report error\n    submitted by    /u/MKijowski  \n [link]   [comments]",

It does not document what function C-S-<right> actually points at.\n Another thing, if we explicitly add that to our config like this:\n (global-set-key (kbd \"C-S-<right>\") 'right-word) \n then it operates like the unshifted variant, offering further proof that it was not pointing at the same function before the re-mapping.\n Not a hassle, just a curiosity. Some hidden magic happening?\n Bonus points for explaining the following from the same key help - what is a 'field' in emacs? A search in the emacs manual `C-h i` is not fruitful:\n Value is normally t. If an edge of the buffer or a field boundary is reached, point is left there and the function returns nil.

          "description": "I made a function (included below) that combines all the tables in a particular Org subtree and exports them to single TSV file. My function works well enough, but it's a bit slow, taking usually about 1.2 seconds. I ran the emacs profiler on my function and found that the majority of the time was spent on calls to org-table-align invoked by org-table-move-column and org-table-export. In my case, those calls to org-table-align are unnecessary. Since neither org-table-move-column nor org-table-export provide an option to not invoke org-table-align, I made my own modified versions of those function that just comment out the calls to org-table-align. By doing this, my function now runs in 0.2 seconds, a 6x speedup!\n While the speedup is nice, I would prefer to not have my own modified version…",

          "description": "Hi all,\n I love Edwina mode, but I'm suspicious that it's interferes somehow with the process of opening links to external buffers.\n When I try to open a link to a specific part of an org-file, using org-open-at-point for instance, it opens the file correctly, but then fails to jump to the right header etc. The same happens when, for instance, I open a link contained in a help buffer to view a function; it opens the correct file but fails to jump to the right part of the code.\n The reason I suspect Edwina mode is because when I switch it off everything works fine again. So it seems that somehow Edwina is interfering with this process.\n Has anyone else had this problem? I'm trying to look into it but I'm new to elisp and I'm not sure exactly where ti begin\n Thanks for any ideas,\n Mike\n    submitted by    /u/carvakatavacchedaka  \n [link]   [comments]",

Intel i5 CPU, 8GB RAM, 240GB SSD, Linux Fedora with GNOME.\n I start Emacs with emacs -q to prevent loading any configuration. When I create a new .org file, there is a few seconds delay until the document opens up. Is that normal? It just happens the first time Org loads up. Then creating other .org documents have no delay.\n I tried disabling the garbage collector in early-init.el and it seems to help a bit. Does that mean that I should set back the GC threshold to about 2MB instead of the default 800Kb?

          "description": "I'm new to emacs, and I've learned the basics, installed some packages, and configured it to my liking the last 2 weeks or so. I'm using the basic emacs keybindings (no evil).\n One thing that has repeatedly caused me some headaches, is custom keybindings, either for functionality of packages that don't provide their own keybindings, or for custom functions. For instance,\n  \nI want to configure a binding for consult-line (searches for occurrences, lists them in consult, allows to jump to match), something I'm probably going to use frequently. So I go for `C-c slash` , vaguely inspired by vim, which I've used for a while in the past.\n I try it in my config file and it works.\n I want to use it in org mode and realize it's already bound to something else there. Shit.\n  \nHow to best avoid this \"in advance\", such that it's unlikely to happen in the future, even if I install more packages or use more modes? I guess letting my own commands start with `C-c` is a bad idea.\n I thought about starting all custom commands with something else, like `C-some_key...` where `C-some_key` kind of works as something like a personal leader key. But when I use the same leader/prefix key for all personal keybindings, no matter what they do, I feel this breaks the logic of the seperation that we have with `C-x` vs `C-c` for instance. Whereas using multiple such preface keys seems to escalate keybindings and memorization efforts.\n Also using C might be difficult, as C-something is already bound to a bunch of stuff (eg `C-v` for scrolling). What else would be a good option? How are experienced people handling their personal keybindings?\n EDIT made: clarified that the binding I was trying to use was C-c slash-key, somehow it only displayed C-c, which made it confusing\n    submitted by    /u/throw_ag  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi, I would like to build an Emacs configuration from scratch. I know there are some alternatives out there such as Prelude, Purcell's Emacs.d, and Crafted Emacs but I would like to build my own.\n By modular configuration I mean a configuration in which things are split up in separate files. For example:\n ;; in the main init file: (require 'php) (require 'javascript) (require 'dired) \n If I don't want to use Emacs to code in a certain language I can just comment out the require statement.\n I've noticed that people who built modular configurations did not rely on use-package and they just used the built-in features.\n I was wondering if it's possible to build a modular configuration using use-package? I guess use-package is just a macro and what it does it groups things together. Right?\n I think what I need to do is to just put all those use-package chunks into separate files? For example, all dired related stuff into a dired.el file:\n (use-package dired :ensure nil :after all-the-icons-dired :bind (\"C-x C-j\" . dired-jump) :hook (dired-mode . all-the-icons-dired-mode) :custom (dired-auto-revert-buffer t) (dired-listing-switches \"-agho --group-directories-first\")) (use-package dired-narrow :after dired :bind (:map dired-mode-map (\"/\" . dired-narrow))) (use-package dired-subtree :after dired :bind (:map dired-mode-map (\"<backtab>\" . dired-subtree-cycle) (\"<tab>\" . dired-subtree-toggle))) (use-package all-the-icons-dired :after all-the-icons) \n and PHP related stuff in php.el, so on.. even if the use-package stuff is just 3 lines of code in that file (I may add more stuff in that file in the future).\n I can go with a programming.el that contains all languages but I think having a separate file for each language is better because I can disable and enable the languages I want easier in main.el.\n Please share your thought about this.

If there are java developers who write in Emacs, I hope for their help (and configs :)).\n Actual questions:\n 1) Which is better: build emacs from scratch or use doomEmacs as a starting point?\n 2) Which lsp servers are better to install for Java (sometimes I also write in Scala)?\n 3) Which plugins to install for Maven and Gradle? Will there be auto-completion? \n 4) Will it be possible to create and run projects directly from Emacs? (Not so important, but still)\n 5) How is Spring? Is there a plugin that is analogous to Spring Tools?\n 6) Which plugins should I use to integrate git, sql, markdown, xml?\n 7) Which plugins should I use for database integration?

The language deals with a lot of logical operators such as \"∧\", \"∨\" and \"∀\" etc. What I am trying to implement is a feature so that I can write \"\\and\" to get the \"∧\" symbol (kinda like they do in the agda-mode).\n Currently I am using the prettify-package, however I realised that this package does not actually replace the text with the symbols in the file. It simply replaces it visually in my mode, but the source-text still remains in the file.\n I could rewrite the parser of the language to also parse \"\\and\", but I prefer to avoid this and get Emacs to replace the actual string with the Unicode-symbol it refers to.\n Does anyone know about any similar package to prettify-package which also replaces the actual strings with the symbols? \n Thanks in advance \n PS. I am not sure how standard the prettify package is within the Emacs community.

I've recently started using Emacs with Evil Mode. Having used VScode and IntelliJ IDEs in the past. Afaik if you use the VIM keybidings \"properly\" there is no need to select text with the arrows, but I am currently somewhat short on time so I haven't had much chance to learn them properly. So for now I am using the arrows keys. But when I use them in the insert state shift + arrow is always jumping whole words. And Ctrl + shift + arrow selects whole words. I would like it to behave like I am used to with shift starting the selection, arrows moving one char at a time, and ctrl + arrow to be used to jump whole words? Is that somehow possible? Which brings me to my next question \n \nWhy is which key not showing the bindings for Ctrl + Arrow / Shift+Arrow etc. ? In regards to my previous questions, I was trying to find out how I can achieve it. Online I heard which key (C h + the key you want described) often, but there's no way for it to describe Ctrl/shift + arrow for me. If I press C-h k shift-arrow it only describes the behavior the arrow key. Is it because Ctrl/shift are some sort of modifiers and not keys? If yes, is there any way how to describe behavior of such key combinations?\n \n I hope my questions make sense, english is not my native language and I have a hard time to describe what I mean.

But for debugging purposes, I removed it.\n company-mode won't kick in automatically in emacs-lisp-mode buffers. Activating it manually works like a charm though. By order of elimination I've identified lsp-mode interaction (mapping and load order) as the culprit. Without it, everything works as intended. I have a few guesses which I won't utter because they'd probably make me sound like an idiot.\n This is my first time hand crafting an .emacs.d.

At the mean time, the left thumb is naturally fallen on the alt position, which makes it convenient for forward and backward word. Some main prefix keys are maintained. And the layout is suggested with the letter frequency, allowing attention put on the home row regions without moving hands around.

With a little translation help from SpeedRect, you can grab one or more columns of numerical data into calc, do all kinds of operations on it there (pretty much anything), and then, once you are happy, yank it back into the buffer, over the top of the rectangle selection.\n    submitted by    /u/JDRiverRun  \n [link]   [comments]",

It lets you share links and content from another app (typically Safari) via the macOS Share menu and format it in Org markup. It can also support Markdown links so you can work with other editors too. The app is called Captee and the video link below demonstrates it at work.\n Captee alpha demo\n Note that Captee is very much in an alpha/proof-of-concept/bleeding-edge state of polish right now. You’ll get the best results for Captee if you use the macOS Yamamoto Mitsuharu port of Emacs. It supports Org Protocol out of the box, otherwise you will have to use the system clipboard to share content.\n To capture selected text via org-protocol you’ll need to define a capture template on the Emacs side first before you use Captee. Here’s an example capture template that uses the placeholders described in the Org capture protocol.\n (setq org-capture-templates '( (\"a\" \"Captee Capture\" entry (file+headline \"~/org/captee.org\" \"Captee Captures\") \"* %:description\\n%:annotation\\n%i\\n%?\" :empty-lines 1) )) \n Okay with all that said, I’m looking for testers. If you’re interested, you can get an alpha build of Captee via this TestFlight link. Please provide feedback via the TestFlight app. Also, I highly recommend you do a deep-read of the release notes before installing or using Captee.\n    submitted by    /u/kickingvegas1  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "This may be obvious to some of you, but I came across this just today, so wanted to lay this out clearly in case it helps others.\n git log has a mechanism to trace evolution of lines across commits - think of this as an even more fine grained version of seeing log for a single file. This \"-L\" arg in git takes the form of -L<start>,<end>:<file> to restrict to certain line numbers or -L:<funcname>:<file> to restrict to a particular function. Magit has the \"-L\" infix argument to use this directly - but this interface makes you do the manual work of feeding in the input.\n Instead, you can use the direct options available in magit-file-dispatch bound to C-c M-g by default. To trace functions, use the t command (trace) to trace the function under cursor. To trace particular lines - mark region and then call C-c M-g l to see the commit history only for those lines.\n This last command is basically (magit-log-buffer-file) which you can bind directly to something more easy to use. If you use evil, something like the following will make this much easier to use:\n (define-key evil-visual-state-map (kbd \";gl\") 'magit-log-buffer-file) \n    submitted by    /u/chandergovind  \n [link]   [comments]",

But I also want the 2nd and 3rd FooBar to be a \"stop\" where I can enter a different value.\n When using (s name) for the first, and name for the others, they get skipped. When using (s name) for the others as well, all three change simultaneously. So I tried using the form variants of (p ...), but to no avail.\n Here's what I currently use, but it lacks the possibility to change locally:\n lisp (nt \"newtype \" (s name) \" = \" name \" { un\" name \" :: \" p \" }\") \n Can you help me? [Ideally, I'd like to actually change the whole unFooBar in the third place, but that's probably the same problem in disguise, just that the default value is calculated by a form.]\n    submitted by    /u/KenranThePanda  \n [link]   [comments]",

Then i tried to open up a project and start coding and i ran into all kinds of issues ranging from lsp not initializing to tab indentation being 2 spaces insted of 4 in half of the modes and completions not heaving any relevant suggestions. So then i switched to spacemacs because i thaught that it had better support for rust and was better integrated. Turns out it was a similar story, completions sucked lsp half of the time didnt initialize and i had to explicitly enable it with M-x lsp every time i opened a project. \n Its now the third day that im just tinkering with emacs and i didn't solve any of the issues listed above.\n Is emacs just bad developer experiance? Am i missing something? Am i just dumb and its a simple solution?\n I want to love emacs, but its making it real hard to do it.\n note: the lsp issue i could maybe live with, but the completions and indentation issues are really bad. A specific case when the completions are the worst at is for example somstructvar.<completions here> or when importing (rust example use somemod::<completion here>), the indentation is bad mainly in js/ts (rjsx) and json\n    submitted by    /u/d0a1v2i3d-  \n [link]   [comments]",

Why? Any time I explicitly activate rectangle-mark-mode, I do so only to call one of the various *-rectangle-* commands next. So why should I remember/type their prefixes? And what's more, I can see that I have this mode active by the region shape & left border.\n Repeat wasn't the right approach, but it was simple to activate a transient map in rectangle-mark-mode-hook. Check this tiny gist. So C-x SPC, highlight your desired rectangle, then [k]ill [d]elete del-[<SPC>] [c]lear [o]pen s[t]ring [w]-copy [y]ank [N]umber. I didn't even know about the (unbound) command delete-whitespace-rectangle, but will use it often now that I don't have to bind/remember it.\n The only thing I wish for is the ability to recall the region of the last marked rectangle (line+col; from, to), for when you'd like to do a series of rect operations in a row on the same columns.\n    submitted by    /u/JDRiverRun  \n [link]   [comments]",

However, I've found that simply defining new commands in overleaf goes a long way and provides similar benefits to using snippets. Also, org mode has the option to render LaTeX directly inside the editor instead of having one screen for the editor and another for the rendered output. I guess the bullet point features of org mode are also pretty cool. However, despite all of these cool features, I find when I use emacs I end up wasting a lot of time researching how to do stuff. In practice I find simply writing things up in Overleaf to be a lot faster. Does emacs eventually get faster if you're good enough at it?\n    submitted by    /u/TiloRC  \n [link]   [comments]",

Why it feels like just yesterday I was release ekg version 0.1, and in fact it wasn't that long ago.\n ekg is a note taking application for emacs that stores all data in sqlite, is very tag-oriented, and designed to be easy to extend.\n The changes for version 0.2 are:\n  \nAdded hooks ekg-add-schema-hook, ekg-note-pre-save-hook, ekg-note-save-hook, ekg-note-delete-hook, and ekg-note-add-tag-hook to enable customization.\n New commands ekg-show-notes-latest-captured, =kg-show-notes-latest-modified, for showing notes created or modified recently.\n Introduced variable ekg-notes-size to control the default page size for limited views such as ekg-show-notes-latest-captured.\n Added templating.\n Added embedding as an optional add-on, to enable note similarity and note search; requires an account at OpenAI or similar embedding provider.\n Added new function ekg-active-notes to easily get all non-trashed notes.\n Improved ability to have note list buffers that have flexible titles and operation, notably improving the ekg-show-notes-in-trash command.\n Standardized buffer names for ekg-notes-mode buffers, which all are prepended with \"ekg\" and surrounded by asterisks, to denote that they are non-file-based.\n Added documentation in texinfo, viewable via M-x info.\n Fixed bug interfering with completion at the beginning of the tag property line.\n  \nFor details, watch the demo of 0.2 changes. I think the templating is done via a unique way that shows off the power of ekg, and embedding stuff is advanced, super useful, and virtually no other note app in any system has it. On the other hand, the embeddings costs a very small amount of money and has unfortunate privacy implications.

I saw the function being used in existing Elisp and thought, \"What's car and cdr?\" So I looked it up inside Emacs, and it told me that car returned the car of LIST. Wow... super helpful...\n I'd offer to submit a pull request to update the documentation if the source code wasn't managed via email, but it is. So, I'm just putting my opinion out here where someone else who contributes might read this. ``` car is a function defined in C source code.\n Signature (car LIST)\n Documentation Return the car of LIST.

That being said, my output isn't actually giving me the parent node. My output is \n Parent node:#<user-ptr ptr=0x565357826740 finalizer=0x7fcf98715780>, type: modifiers, start: 46, end: 59\n  (defun testing/AST-parent () \"Return parent node of the tree-sitter node at point.\" (interactive) (setq get-parent (tsc-get-parent (tree-sitter-node-at-pos (thing-at-point 'symbol)))) (if get-parent (progn (setq parent-type (tsc-node-type get-parent)) (setq parent-start (tsc-node-start-position get-parent)) (setq parent-end (tsc-node-end-position get-parent)) (message \"Parent node:%s, type: %s, start: %s, end: %s\" get-parent parent-type parent-start parent-end)) (message \"No parent node\"))) \n Edit 2: Solved it!

In many cases I want to edit a file on the remote server, using Emacs.\n Currently, I have just been using SSH (PuTTY) with X11 forwarding enabled. I simply SSH to my target, open the file, and voila Emacs is drawn on my local/Windows client. When I'm on the same local network as the development servers, this works fine.\n When I'm connecting remotely (VPN), oftentimes a much slower connection, this can get a little ugly. It works, yes, but can be painfully slow. For example, hitting page up inside Emacs may take a couple of seconds to draw. This creates the need for some very delicate typing/selecting of text.\n How can I improve this setup? I have started to research emacsclient (to run in Windows) to potentially connect to Emacs on the Linux side (running in daemon mode), but I'm not sure that this is actually the correct approach.

Certain combinations, like H-e work fine, while other combinations like H-i do not. C-h k shows that Emacs gets an unmodified i, but a correctly modified H-e. xev shows that the Hyper keycode is being emitted consistently.\n If I change my X session to start an xterm instead of Emacs, then launch Emacs from the xterm, the modifier works perfectly.

Since I want to use emacs as an IDE, I want to install eglot for the LSP client and company to have a better completion UI. I went with eglot over lsp mode because I have previously used lsp mode and it seemed slow. Plus, eglot is shipping with emacs 29 by default, which means it is good enough to be included in emacs, so I might as well use it.\n Anyway, I do the typical thing. M-x package-install RET eglot RET. Gets installed from elpa as expected. Same with company: M-x package-install RET company RET. They both work, all is good, but upon restarting, they're not longer there.\n After some head scratching I realized they are not being initialized. After running package-initialize they both work again. If I add that same function to the end of my init.el, then it works. But why? The package-enable-at-startup variable is set to true, as it should.\n Here's my config, it's not very big.\n Also as an extra. Anyway to move the eln-cache folder? Thanks.\n EDIT: I know the packages.el file isn't being loaded. That's fine, I'm not done with it yet.

Today, I have developed a morgue file that in my zettelkasten that collects items that I think might provide fodder for my fiction writing.\nI write speculative fiction and so I track newspaper articles or reports that I think might serve as the germ of a story. Then, as part of my writing process, I'll make a new (structure) note and include links to articles or pieces that might inspire pieces of my story (whether character, setting, or plot).\nFor example, I recently learned about Point Nemo, a \"spacecraft cemetery\" in the Pacific Ocean that is a \"pole of inaccessibility,\" the location farthest from any land. This was intriguing enough, so I did some more cursory reading and learned (among other things) that it is also a remarkably lifeless part of the ocean because it is so far from land. Also, in spite of not being officially identified as the \"pole of inaccessibility\" until 1992, Point Nemo is near where H.P. Lovecraft placed R'lyeh, the lost city where Cthulhu is imprisoned!\nAt any rate, I now have a cluster of notes about Point Nemo that is forming the gensis of a story about scavengers trying to salvage material in this remote location. The real-life details are helping me flesh out the skeleton of a plot and raising more questions for me to explore. (For example, I know next to nothing about what might be involved in this salvage operation, so I now have some more reading to do!)\nI thought I'd share in case others are interested in using their zettelkasten to generate ideas for fiction, and to learn from others who might implement a similar practice. Do you have any other tips or advice? Pitfalls to avoid?",

I'll launch the first salvo.\n\n  \n@Massimo_Curatella said over at Ideas We're Grappling With March 23, 2023::\nI am thinking about designing a tutorial on how to create your user profile to get the best out of participating to online communities.\n\n\nNot sure that even a sparkling user profile like mine  is good enough to bolt us into participating or be a tornado hurling others to interact with us. But I could be wrong.\n\n  \nI need to set specific boundaries to my exploration and that was the smallest unit of value I could think of.\n\n\nConcentrating on the user profile is a small gesture but who knows where it could lead? I'm willing to follow along and help where I can.\n\n  \nI started to talk about that idea to friends and, surprisingly, they found it useful.\n\n\nI have a mildly snarky question, are you talking to us \"about the idea as friends\" or are we the \"real people\" you want to experiment on?\nThis is a superb idea, and I'll participate. I think this forum would benefit from anything that would enhance engagement.\nTo start this off, here is a screenshot of my profile.",

I quickly looked at the paper, and while I don't agree with everything, Robin's look at the construal-level theory and how it relates to our concept of sacred is fascinating and well-referenced.\nA week filled with productive distractions.

          "description": "Hi, I have been lurking around for a while now, really enjoying the discussions, so I thought it might be time to introduce myself.\nI am a originally from Slovakia, but have been living in Norway for a decade now. I’m a researcher in data analysis, working with a lot of machine learning, and like to learn about a variety of things in my free time too. My interests range from the biophysics of movement through diet, pregnancy and childbirth, to neurodiversity, gardening, parenting, knowledge work and whatever else that catches my interest.\nI have first heard about the Zettelkasten method about two months ago and it was a love at first sight. I always struggled with organising my notes and the organically organised chaos of Zettelkasten just makes perfect sense to me.\nI started out using Obsidian. That is actually how I ran into the Zettelkasten, as I was originally only looking for a simple markdown editor. After a month and a hundred notes I could feel this was becoming very important to me and decided to move to an open source software instead - namely org-roam in Emacs. I’m new to Emacs, but fairly stubborn, so I have been steadily climbing its famously steep learning curve and I think I’m quite happy with my choice. The time when my Zettelkasten was hanging between the two systems, so to speak, was quite uncomfortable though.\nI haven’t quite landed with my note-taking routines yet, but I have the most important bits in place. I use my trusted Bullet Journal for planning, journaling, tracking and fleeting notes, while any “knowledge” goes into the Zettelkasten with Zotero keeping track of the references.\nI am very excited to see how things will evolve and looking forward to the interesting discussions here on the forum.",

          "description": "The idea of having and maintaining a Zettelkasten has become increasingly popular since the »Zettelkästen. Maschinen der Phantasie« exhibition at Marbach in March 2013 and the appearance of the website zettelkasten.de in late 2013 and has grown significantly with the Cambrian explosion of a variety of digital note taking tools since 2018.\nBut here’s a fun little historical linguistic puzzle:\nWhat was the first use of the word Zettelkasten in a predominantly English language setting?\nIn my own notes/research the first occurrence I’ve been able to identify in an English language setting is on Manfred Kuehn’s blog in Taking note: Luhmann’s Zettelkasten on 2007-12-16. He’d just started his blog earlier that month.\nHas anyone seen an earlier usage? Can you find one? Can you beat this December 2007 date or something close by a different author?\nGoogle’s nGram Viewer doesn’t indicate any instances of it from 1800-2019 in its English search, though does provide a graph for German with peaks in the 1850s, 1892 (just after Ernst Bernheim’s Lehrbuch der Historischen Methode in 1889), 1912, 1925, and again in 1991.\nTwitter search from 2006-2007 finds nothing and there are only two results in German both mentioning Luhmann.\nMy best guess for earlier versions of the appearance zettelkasten in English might stem from the work/publications of S. D. Goitein or Gotthard Deutsch, but I’ve yet to see anything there. \nFor those who speak German, what might you posit as a motivating source for the rise of the word in the 1850s or any of the other later peaks?\n(Originally published on https://boffosocko.com/2023/03/11/first-use-of-zettelkasten-in-an-english-language-setting/ with aggregated commentary.)",

It was designed as an accessory to be stood next to one's desk to accommodate a telephone at the beginning of the telephone era and also served as storage for one's card index.\nGiven the broad business-based use of the card index at the time and the newness of the telephone, this piece of furniture likely was not designed as an early proto-rolodex, though it certainly could have been (and very well may have likely been) used as such in practice.\nI totally want one of these as a side table for my couch/reading chair for both storing index cards and as a writing surface while reading!

While my novel's not going to be based whole cloth on any of these figures, I am drawing some inspiration from real life programs and work and events.

          "description": "Yesterday, I watched a talk by Tony Buzan at Poland's SWPS University, which I came across on YouTube, reminding me of the importance of colour in understanding and recall.\nWhilst at school several decades ago, I became very keen on Tony Buzan's methods popularised by his 1974 BBC television series Use Your Head, in which he encouraged people to use colourful mindmaps and speedreading, among other techniques, to better understand and remember anything they were studying.  At the time, I was a failing student.  So, even though most students and staff saw his techniques as weird, I decided to give them ago.  To my astonishment, by applying just a couple of his key techniques, I quickly started getting top marks and with less effort.  So, I have no doubt Tony's methods have merit.\nIt would therefore be beneficial to introduce coloured text into The Archive app by using some simple markup code.\nEven a limited pallet would be helpful, perhaps just red, green and blue, although the more colours, the better.  Something like <r>for red text</r>, <b>for blue text</b>, etc., would be enough.  But hex codes would allow for a more extensive pallet.\nWould coloured text in The Archive app be possible?\nTony Buzan's talk at SWPS University can be seen here:  https://youtu.be/QEokHNWf-Qg.\nAnd his 1974 BBC television series Use Your Head, is available here: https://youtu.be/EgG8GuQHHIs.",
