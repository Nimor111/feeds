Do lambdas dynamically allocate space for their captures, and store a pointer with the function objects, so that every function is really a function pointer plus a capture pointer, which would be null in the case of non-capturing functions?

Moreover, Haskell functions can't have side effects, which means that they can't effect any changes to the \"real world\", like changing files, writing to the screen, printing, sending data over the network, and so on. These two restrictions together mean that any function call can be replaced by the result of a previous call with the same parameters, and the language guarantees that all these rearrangements will not change the program result!\"\n However, if that were true it wouldn't be very useful would it? Surely we can write crypto things, make files, print to console etc...\n So which is it? Haskell can do this or it can't?

I've tested to make sure, but aside from appearance, there's little difference. Here's a little screenshot of the code in the buffer, it is otherwise empty.\n I want to export it like you would if you had the code in the export block as html directly, as shown earlier. As far as I've found, you can't use src blocks to export the code non-literally, and I'm messing with changing the values of some code using variables, macros and the like on export. Tangling is not relevant in this case, otherwise I'd be able to do that with a src block.\n Hopefully I've explained well enough, but please do ask if you need more information!

After MUCH trial and error, I finally came up with a shebang that will tangle a file, though it depends on the current working directory/filename:\n #! emacs --eval=(progn (find-file \"this-file.org\") (org-mode) (org-babel-tangle)) \n However, when emacs detects itself in the magic string, it opens the document in Emacs-Lisp Mode instead of org mode.

For instance do you all:\n 1) Use one big calendar file and just throw events into it unsorted? 2) Use some sort of sorted calendar file? If so, how do you sort it... By year, then month, then day? This is confusing because scheduled dates seem to be children of the parent title, so it doesn't seem logical to organize events this way. 3) Do you use org journal in some way for this?\n I'd also love to know how you integrate your scheduled events with scheduled to-dos...

However, there's one important feature that I'd like, which I haven't been able to do in org-mode.\n As I'm typing down notes, I would like to select a particular sentence/phrase and mark it as an important \"note\" to remember. This is analogous to highlighting a piece of text. Later, I would like to retrieve/display the important notes, that I have marked.\n While I understand that having Tags in headlines solves this issue (where I can set the tag to IMPORTANT), it works only at headline level and not at a text level. Additionally, the simple formatting features like bold/italics etc do not really help/make the text stand out.\n Is there a tool/package/anything that can do something like this? Where I can essentially select a sentence/phrase from my notes, and mark as important and search later? If not, how do org-mode users highlight some text, sort of like a 'callout' block?\n I wouldn't mind the piece of text to be a separate \"block\", if it is a feasible solution as well. It need not be part of a paragraph, however, it doesn't make sense to be a headline.\n Thanks.\n ​\n A small snippet attached here. Would like the selected portion to be marked as \"important\". \n Image Query\n    submitted by    /u/ThreeForElvenKings  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "TLDR: is there a way to programmatically tell what command started the current minibuffer window?\n The convoluted context: I like my search history for commands like M-x and consult-line and consult-apropos to include input I typed to filter candidates, even if I didn’t press RET on any candidate and instead pressed C-g to quit. To my knowledge, the search history functionality in emacs is only built to remember input that was executed by RET, so I created my own Vertico-Quit function that sends keyboard-escape-quit after first pushing whatever input I typed into the minibuffer to the relevant history variable (e.g., consult--line-history, extended-command-history, etc.). \n The problem I ran into was how to determine which history variable for my Vertico-Quit to send the input to. I thought the this-command or last-command variables would be sufficient, but the act of typing into the minibuffer changes these variables to self-insert-command. The solution I came up with was to add :before advice to consult-apropos, consult-line and the like that sets a variable that Vertico-Quit uses to know which command history variable to send the input to. This worked fine for every command except execute-extended-command / M-x, which strangely doesn’t execute :before or :around advice until you've actually pressed RET on a candidate (rather than quitting with C-g). So I put my own wrapper function around execute-extended-command to set the desired variable for my Vertico-Quit, but that interfered with a function in Embark, embark-keymap-prompter, which now doesn’t work when I use my wrapper function around execute-extended-command when embark is active. I tried changing M-x back to its default function in the context of embark with the following, but it didn’t work:\n (define-key embark-general-map (kbd \"M-x\") 'execute-extended-command) \n Any help would be much appreciated!\n    submitted by    /u/jMilton13  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello,\nHow are you all taking reading notes? I have been using a notebook (a bit smaller than A5 size) to take mine. Usually I jot down things in bullet points as I read with a text. But this has been causing some issues. The actual writing takes a bit, and can be enough to get me out of the flow of reading. This usually leads to frustration as I try to write as fast as I am thinking, resulting in a barely legible scrawl. Either that or I take very few notes as I try to stay engaged with the reading material So, I wonder, am I taking notes too often? Should I wait until I am done with a certain section before jotting down ideas? The mental block I have there is that I will forget what I wanted to write down by the time I get to a stopping point.\nMaybe it is not the frequency of notes, but the medium. Or maybe both. I have tried using a computer, and that does help with speed somewhat. However, that works best with digital texts, and I mostly read printed ones. Another approach I have thought of is using index cards. That does make processing later a bit easier, and you can group notes freely to see relations, but it can also get messy. What are your thoughts on using a computer for notes? Index cards?\nMy goal is to have a system where I can read fluidly while writing down things I would like to process later. How are you accomplishing this?",

Please let me know what you think.\nIf you have a Zettelkasten, you need to constantly create Zettels so it grows to give you richer connections. A day in a Zettler usually looks like this:\nCreate Zettels and make connections.\nRead sources.\nProofread Zettels.\nHowever, you need to manage the overall process so working with a Zettelkasten doesn't become all you do everyday. E.g.: In the worst case scenario, you'd spend the entire morning, afternoon, and evening creating Zettels, reading, and proofreading respectively. That gives you no time for anything else!\nThe part of the process to manage is reading time because everything else depends on it. E.g.: If you don't read, you can't create Zettels, and without Zettels, there's nothing to proofread.\nI think that we can manage reading time in the same way that we adapt the routine of short knowledge cycles:\nStart with 1 hour of reading.\nRead, create Zettels, and proofread. Keep track of the time spent on each activity.\nReflect on the overall process.\nBased on your reflection, change the time alloted for reading.\nRepeat steps 2 through 4 until you reach a point where you are satisfied with the work you do for your Zettelkasten, and don't lose time for other things in your day.",

          "description": "I am quite new to Zettelkasten.\nI still have a doubt though.. Should notes link only to older ones? If yes, they are connected like a directed acyclic graph.\nThe argument for it would be:\nneed to change, they are just linked to from new ones\nCounterarguments:\nAlso I am not sure what the implications would be for links between literature and permanent notes.\nLike.. Literature note can link to previous permanent notes that are useful for the idea. But what for permanent notes created just to explain something in the literature note? I guess we treat them as if they were older than the literature note, even if the UID is more recent (timestamp) breaking a bit the rule. This means: create the new permanent note but linking to it from the older literature note. As for permanent notes that then emerge from literature note review — meaning after finishing the literature note — I guess they link the literature note that inspired their creation.",

          "description": "(new to zk)\nGiven all the discussion of how L-style ID's can be association-brittle relative to using just links, I was wondering if the following has an implementation in any digital system.\nI'd like the following:  an L-style ref to \"position-sequence\" extended to differentiate between paths through the sequence --based on context --  in which one context path may share some im/proper subset of the other.\nExample: given say \nHere we have the shared edge (xa,xb) = (1b,1ba). And indeed it would be stultifying to assume that the meaning in context2 is partially identical to context1 simply because of the shared referential sub-structure.\nQuestion: for the advocates of links only: is there a simple way to differentiate multiple referential contexts. I.e., to allow for the same edge/link to be given different meaning.\nThis could be via named links -- not just links named for their nodes, or multi-links, or some in-note context to mimic this behavior.\nDoes such a thing exist?",

Maschinen der Phantasie\" (perhaps roughly \"Zettelkästen. Machines of Imagination\"). I'm fascinated by the question how a zettelkasten can support creative processes. My zettel shows one of the approaches I am experimenting with.\nThe basic idea is the following: I collect ideas triggered by the question \"How can inventive principles from the TRIZ method be used to make zettelkasten work more interesting, successful or effective?\" Background: TRIZ is the \"theory of inventive problem solving\", and one of its key components is a list of 40 (or so) inventive principl…",
