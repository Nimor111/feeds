I wanted to know if there is a more intuition as to why this is the case, and then to what the dual of something like MaybeT, SelectT, and ContT (or is there?). Or why (->) and (,) are duals (because one is the exponential, and the other is the product); why aren’t the duals Either and (,)?\n MaybeT m a ~ m (Maybe a) ~ m (1 + a) CoMaybeT w a ~ w (Void, a) ~ w (0 * a) —- Note that CoMaybeT is uninhabited when w is a Comonad \n    submitted by    /u/skyb0rg  \n [link]   [comments]",

How could you possibly write a computer program without telling the computer what to do (the how)?\n The closest answer I've gathered is that FP is essentially about term rewriting systems (using beta reduction in particular). A rewriting step is analogous to a state transition step in turing machines. So then that means the compiler handles all the control flow for you, rather than FP somehow magically eliminating the need for control flow and other imperative ideas.\n Is this understanding correct?

I discovered the following while traversing a data structure with a State monad, but it's easier to demonstrate with the IO monad. \n If I use boolean operators, they will only evaluate the arguments that they need. e.g.: \n Prelude> False && undefined False Prelude> True && undefined *** Exception: Prelude.undefined \n So far, so good. This is what you'd expect. However, if I use the liftM group of functions to lift && to a monad, this no longer works. e.g.:\n falsify :: IO Bool falsify = putStrLn \"It is a falsehood.\" >> return False verify :: IO Bool verify = putStrLn \"Verily, it is so.\" >> return True liftedAnd :: Monad m => m Bool -> m Bool -> m Bool liftedAnd = liftM2 (&&) \n Then, calling it in ghci:\n *Main> falsify `liftedAnd` verify It is a falsehood. Verily, it is so. False \n So, you can't use liftedAnd for flow control. It's easy enough to write an AND function that behaves properly:\n mAnd :: Monad m => m Bool -> m Bool -> m Bool mAnd x y = x >>= \\b -> if b then y else return False \n Now, in ghci:\n *Main> falsify `mAnd` verify It is a falsehood. False \n So, my questions are:\n  \nWould someone please explain why liftM2 behaves this way?\n Is there somewhere in the standard libraries to look for properly behaved && || if/then/else etc. for monads?\n Am I missing some key fact about liftM2? Perhaps I am not using it in the intended way.\n  \n   submitted by    /u/Defrigeration  \n [link]   [comments]",

Its paradigm feels extremely natural in a way beyond the complexity of its encoding would suggest. eg looking at the implementation of reflex a few times, it seems to basically implement an entire runtime system on top of haskell's runtime system.\n On one hand it's very cool that haskell is flexible enough to implement a runtime system as a library, but I wonder if there's gains to be made in something more wired in (eg in terms of optimization, simplifying compile times, simplifying types, etc.) - it always struck my as a bit hacky.\n I know elm used to have builtin FRP but dropped it (I don't recall exactly why - any insight here would help!)\n Perhaps a proper \"dataflow\" language - though my (poorly informed) impression is that these are all way more special purpose and I've been spoiled by the full power of haskell.\n What do you think?\n EDIT: Looking into it more now - I redescovered this explanation of why Elm dropped FRP. It's honestly pretty disappointing - I understand from a developer UX perspective this simplifies a lot of things, but I'm not a fan of the redux \"smash-everything-into-one-type\" pattern - and a big draw for FRP is having the control flow represent dependency locality rather than synchronizing everything on one monlithic state\n    submitted by    /u/CoBuddha  \n [link]   [comments]",

Some examples of the kind issues i'm interested in detecting are:\n  \nThe field \"base_path\", if it exists, cannot use Windows paths, must be POSIX\n The field \"date_created\" must be in ISO8601\n etc.\n  \nI'm capable of writing the linter rules (i.e. detect date formats, path formats etc.), what I need help with is the IO / initial parsing phase. I'm familiar with parser-combinators (attoparsec has been my goto previously) but never before had a use case that cares about where the parsing failed. I've also used aeson a couple of times for handling JSON.\n The defining requirement is that, once an issue has been identified, the linter must report the location of the error including line number(s) and column numbers (start and end). It can be assumed that the data is valid JSON and conforms to the expected schema (i.e. if we expect a \"date_created\" field, it'll be there. I'm interested in format/quality issues rather than validating structure / syntax.\n Otherwise, the only requirement is that it be quick / run in parallel - It must be able to run over thousands of files in a couple of minutes.\n My initial plan was to use something like pipes-aeson for IO (not used a streaming library before but seems straightforward enough) however it seems that aeson is based on attoparsec and the parse-error is just a plain string without source locations.\n So, finally, to some questions.\n  \nAnybody have recommendations for parsing JSON (quickly) while keeping track of the source-locations of each field / key / value / object etc.\n Can streaming libraries like pipes be used to process the loaded files in parallel?

Maybe it's actually possible just with library support for something like a linear ResourceT monad but that still feels a bit unsatisfying)\n As far as I can tell, it's solely the brainchild of Tweag - which is great to have industry support, but worrying in terms of robustness and longterm support as GHC develops. Linear types really needs fairly deep integration with the rest of GHC to be most useful.\n  \n1/2/3 are the only ones really stopping me from going all-in on linearity right now, but I expect all of them to get resolved eventually so long as 7 isn't an issue.\n So my question is: What's the latest developments on linear types in haskell / who is working on it / what's the best place to keep updated?\n    submitted by    /u/CoBuddha  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi everyone, is there an alternative formulation of monad transformers that allow removing any reference to the base monad inside the e.g. bind definition of the transformer ? \n The reason I'm asking for that is I'm porting some Haskell transformers to Python, for which I would like to avoid chains of lift.lift.lift... \n A good way I found is simply to make a custom subclass of each transformer in the stack, so that they can be looked up for their lift by \"tag\" (the specific subclass) rather than numerical position (aka number of lift nesting). That would make composition of function using different monads very easy, even if they have not been designed to work together specifically \n This would still allows the user to use multiple transformers of the same type (e.g. StateT), since the user can create as many subclasses of StateT they want for each piece of state.\n The problem with that is that if the user uses e.g. SubclassofStateT.pure(42), the base monad is not known , and has to be \"resolved\" later (when looking up the index of this class in the stack to lift appropriately). Unfortunately automatic, lifting is not enough since the definition of e.g. pure() would require the knowledge of the base monad which we don't have at this stage. Hence the need for an alternative formulation that allows delaying this knowledge to later.\n EDIT: fix typos\n    submitted by    /u/Dasher38  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have questions about Exercise D in Chapter 2.\n The first part of the question was easy to understand. It is about comparing lazy vs strict evaluation about the expression\n head (map f xs) where xs is a list of length n.\n -> With Strict evaluation the function f is applied to all elements in xs after which the first element of the list is retrieved. So function f is applied n times.\n -> With lazy evaluation the expression is reduced to\n let p = map f xs in head (p)\n which reduces to f applies to the first element in XS. i.e. f xs0 \n ​\n In the second part of the question, there is a function filter p which when applied to a list returns a list of elements that satisfies the boolean test p.\n filter :: (a -> Bool) -> [a] -> [a]\n head . filter p xs returns the first element that satisfies the condition p. \n In the question I'm having a hard time visualizing how lazy evaluation will work. With innermost reduction, the filter is applied to each element of the list and a list with elements that satisfies p is returned and head takes the first element of the list. \n How will lazy evaluation work here? applying p to the input list might prune away elements from the output. \n Is it that with lazy evaluation, filter p is applied only until the first element in the list meets the criteria as opposed to eager evaluation where filter p is applied to all elements in the input list?\n    submitted by    /u/AngstyChippy  \n [link]   [comments]",

Just to name a few in no particular order, mostly according to git log:\n  \nAlexander Biehl\n askeblad\n Ben Gamari\n Dmitry Ivanov\n Jaro Reinders\n Johannes Waldmann\n Julian Ospald\n Koz Ross\n Matthew Craven\n Patrick Pelletier\n Simon Jakobi\n me\n  \nOn a personal note, it was not easy to work on this release with my family in a bomb shelter and friends in trenches. Stand with Ukraine, will you?\n    submitted by    /u/Bodigrim  \n [link]   [comments]",

This is a problem because emptyDocs have a height of 1 and will introduce an unwanted newline in the final document. I would like to completely ignore the part of the document if it returns emptyDoc.\n Does someone have an idea of how I can achieve this?\n I thought about not using emptyDoc at all, but Maybe instead:\n formatPartB :: DataB -> State MyState (Maybe (Doc ()))\n but how could I implement the \"excluding\" logic that ignores the Nothings?

          "description": "At the moment, GHC has some machinery for tracking (annotating and inferring) the roles of parameters to type constructors. Roles and their machinery do not appear to be first class, in that it is not possible to discuss the roles of parameters to higher kinded type variables. This is a bit annoying, because in the absence of the ability to discuss such things one has to explicitly carry around coercion dictionary baggage.\n The \"role\" of a parameter roughly encodes the sort of \"equality functor\" the type-level function is. Specifically, the role of some type constructor's parameter determines what kind of equivalence it needs as input in order to produce a representational equivalence as output. If it requires _, the parameter has a _:\n  \ndefinitional equality, nominal role\n representational equivalence, representational role\n codiscrete equivalence (any two things are equal), phantom role\n  \nSo it seems to me that properly speaking, the role actually belongs to the -> in the kind of the type constructor in question. Namely we have three different variations:\n  \nhaskell type Nominal :: Type -{NOM}-> Type data Nominal x where Nominal :: Nominal Int \n haskell type Representational :: Type -{REP}-> Type data Representation x = Representational x \n haskell type Phantom :: Type -{FAN}-> Type data Phantom x = Phantom \n  \nSimilar systems of inference, notation, \"subtyping\" etc. could be devised to the ones for linear function arrows (which occur at the type level), so that working with these things is not very painful. It might also make sense to think of \"role polymorphism\", although I personally haven't given this much thought.\n What do you folks think? Am I missing something obvious?\n EDIT: The Reddit editor ate half my post and I had to rewrite it, apologies to anyone who saw the truncated version.\n    submitted by    /u/dinkandenza  \n [link]   [comments]",

I would want to name their type, and I would also like the functions themselves.\n An approach that first comes to my mind is to use a noun when naming it: ```hs type TreeBuilder a = [a] -> Tree a\n treeBuilder1 :: TreeBuilder treeBuilder1 = undefined\n treeBuilder2 :: TreeBuilder treeBuilder2 = undefined\n treeBuilder3 :: TreeBuilder treeBuilder3 = undefined ```\n However, as colleague pointed out, we could instead use a verb: ```hs type BuildTree a = [a] -> Tree a\n buildTree1 :…",

While Prelude gets a lot of shit, it's so minimal and unopinionated that it really encourages creating language features as libraries. With QuasiQuoters you can take this to a logical extreme, convincing the compiler to compile whatever you want essentially. It seems to take very little convincing to get the language to do anything you want in the way you want as long as it's logically well formed.\n Personally as someone who loves programming language design it's really incredible, if there's a feature in another language that I want to try, I don't have to switch languages, I can find a package or just stub out an implementation in a weekend. I've heard this used as a point against Haskell however, because it lets you work with very bizzare computational models and can make a code base feel kind of disjointed. Personally, I don't buy that, while Haskell does have modules that let you differ from the norm, the norm tends to be the easiest option. You CAN have Alan Kay style objects, you CAN have prolog style logic programming, but why would you when the language is still so effective without them. Of course, eDSLs are a thing too, tho they're less hot pluggable language features and more an incredibly nice design pattern that arises naturally from the language design unless they're designed to operate more generically.\n Anyway, Haskell is cool and I wanted to talk about it, but I'm sure I'm preaching to the choir here.\n    submitted by    /u/VincyThePrincy  \n [link]   [comments]",

I find it somewhat vexing how these different error types cannot mix because they carry different information, and I would like to be able to propagate them to a higher level in my program where the errors can be handled properly.\n To this end I have added a monadic Result type for my own application that is roughly data Result a = Valid a | Invalid Error where Error is my own error sum type that can represent any external error that the program might have to handle. Result has the obvious Functor, Applicative, and Monad instances, and I use it to wrap most actions that can fail including reading and writing files, parsing, validating user input, and so on.\n Is this a good approach? It seems a little unwieldy to set up so many wrapper functions, but it pays off when I can handle the errors so much more smoothly at the top level. Is there some better method I am missing?\n    submitted by    /u/ZGM65563  \n [link]   [comments]",

Specifically I want to be able to notify other threads about changes, so they can react to them, but not in an active waiting way. In Kotlin I would use a StateFlow or a SharedFlow for this. I've seen the pipes library which looks very similar, but I couldn't figure out to use it in a way, where I have to update a value in one place and all threads are notified about it.\n Probably I am still thinking too much in an imperative way, but maybe you can help me go into the right direction.

Primarily I do Data Analysis, because of my academic Machine Learning background, which makes my role closer to Data Scientist. \n However, I am interested to work on Distributed System, Databases, and Stream Processing- that is Distributed Data Systems in broad. I wrote a Microservice in Golang in my current workplace. But I do not think this experience is sufficient to get hired as a Data Engineer working on Distributed Systems.\n I guess, after talking to some other Data Engineers and going through job posts, a project that involves mocking data streams, data ingestion with Kafka, data processing with Flink, serving with ad-hoc Scala microservices, containerization with Docker, and deploying on a Kubernetes (MiniKube perhaps?) cluster might help. What else to add or remove?\n What may I do to learn and later get hired to work as a Data Engineer working on Distributed Systems?\n    submitted by    /u/yoctotoyotta  \n [link]   [comments]",

Day 2 is a task where we have to parse a file, where each line contains a command. Each command updates one of 2 variables. I've tried to implement this using a functional programming style. I convert the commands to (Int, Int) tuples, where each element is a delta introduced by the command. Then, I need to sum these tuples element-wise (like a vector sum). Doing this sum was not very nice, because Scala seems to disallow tuple destructuring in (anonymous) function parameter position. Am I missing something?\n Also, do you have suggestions how I could make my code more idiomatic? I would love to hear them!\n Thank you in advance!\n  def problem1_tuples(input: Iterator[String]): Int = { // input is an iterator of lines val (position, depth) = input.map(s => ( applyRegex(s,forward_pattern), // returns update for first value in tuple or 0 applyRegex(s,down_pattern) - applyRegex(s,up_pattern) // update for second value )).fold((0,0))((a,b) => (a._1 + b._1, a._2 + b._2)) // this is *ugly* position * depth // the challenge asks for the product } \n    submitted by    /u/flo-l  \n [link]   [comments]",

Because of this, I feel my main limitation is how to use functional composition for a larger system when dealing with network requests/responses, database operations, dependency injection, loose coupling, etc. I can write an application that does all these things, I just haven't been really happy with the results.\n What I'm hoping to get is one of two things. The first would be an example codebase, something open on GitHub. Something using, maybe, http4s and cats? Something that I can look through and study how it's been architected, maybe even transcribe it (I have found that re-writing code makes it stick in my head better than just reading it).\n On the other hand, maybe there are some tutorials/courses/etc out there which cover this kind of stuff. I really do NOT want one of those \"This is a functor\" type FP courses, I don't need that at this point. Something that goes much deeper into full-scale application construction is what I'm after.\n Thanks in advance for any help and guidance you can provide.\n    submitted by    /u/Droid2Win  \n [link]   [comments]",

I've got a lot more experience with Java & Kotlin than Scala, fyi.\n Anyway, while doing this Akka course I just decided to create a nice simple utility function within an object to abstract away all the boilerplate setup/teardown for actor systems during the course:\n package io.me.akka package io.me.akka.utils // BONUS: Not my main question, but why do we declare packages twice? import akka.actor.ActorSystem import scala.concurrent.ExecutionContext.Implicits.global object ActorSystemHandler { def useSimpleSystem(name: String, useSystem: ActorSystem => Unit): Unit = { val system = ActorSystem(name) useSystem(system) system.terminate() .map(_ => println(\"ActorSystem terminated\")) } } \n My issue is when i try to use this into one of my lesson objects, like so:\n package io.me.akka package io.me.akka.part2actors import io.me.akka.utils.ActorSystemHandler // This is the line for #2 import akka.actor.{Actor, ActorRef, Props} object ChangingActorBehavior extends App { ActorSystemHandler.useSimpleSystem(\"systemName\", system => { // Do stuff with the system }) } \n There are two main issues that occur:\n  \nWhen I type the name ActorSystemHandler, I get the option to auto-import it like usual in IntelliJ. However, when I actually click that option, nothing happens. The IntelliJ auto-import fails to do anything.\n I go ahead and manually add the import statement, as can be seen above. However, \"io.me.akka\" part of the import is shaded in that grayish color that IntelliJ uses to indicate something is not necessary.\n  \nI'm hoping someone can clarify the above points for me. Manually adding the import results in code that will compile/run, but I feel like I'm doing something wrong. Thanks.\n    submitted by    /u/Droid2Win  \n [link]   [comments]",

I am a front-end web developer, tired of JS-TS.\n First of all, I am not familiar with Scala and its ecosystem, so, sorry about that.\n I own a startup which is close to make a deal with an organization for a serious project.\n I always search for viable JS alternatives and really like Scala as a language (even though I have no experience with it).\n For the last 2 days I am researching on how to embrace Scala-js. I managed to gather some information. \n Concern no 1: interop with the JS ecosystem. Solution: scalably-typed\n Concern no 2: react bindings. Solution: Slinky\n Concern no 3: bundler. Solution: Not so sure, but I've found scalajs-bundler which works with webpack, but I am unsure about the integration with Concern no 4 bellow.\n Concern no 4: Monorepo setup-build system. \n If anyone is familiar with JS ecosystem, there is the nx.dev monorepo managing tool which has the features I need for this project, which will be structured with a feature based folder structure.\n What I need:\n  \napps folder containing 3 applications which will share many libraries-modules from the libs folder mention bellow \n  libs folder which will contain feature based modules, for reuse across the 3 apps\n  \nSomething like this:\n apps/\n ├─ app-1/\n ├─ app-2/\n ├─ app-3/\n libs/\n ├─ feature-1/\n ├─ feature-3/\n ├─ feature-4/\n ├─ feature-2/\n ​\n How can I achieve this? Anyone with experience with something similar?\n As a reminder, those 3 apps and libs will target JS, and will need a bundler.\n Is it possible to only build the affected apps when changing some feature on libs folder?\n Even if it is possible, how maintainable will it be?\n Thank you for your answers!\n    submitted by    /u/AkisArou  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "When testing the basic functionality of my actors, my receiveMessage() event on my test probe is timing out, because the probe isn't listening for messages on the actor that I've spawned.\n ​\n For some context, I have 2 actors\n  \nA TaskManager actor\n A Session actor\n  \nMy TaskManager actor has 2 commands:\n  \nCreateSession(id) - This spawns a new Session actor\n SessionCreated(id, ref) - When a Session actor is spawned, it sends the SessionCreated message back to the TaskManager so that I can store the ref of the session (and perform other stuff)\n  \nHere's where I'm running into the issue. I can't seem to figure out how to write a test to listen for messages coming back to the TaskManager actor that I spawned. When running the test, it times out waiting for the receiveMessage() event.\n Here's my test code:\n  \"Task Manager\" must { \"be able to create sessions and receive a reply from the session when its created\" in { val taskManager = spawn(TaskManager()) val sessionProbe = createTestProbe[SessionCreated]() taskManager ! CreateSession(\"session1\") val reply = sessionProbe.receiveMessage() // ^^ times out } } \n I've been searching the docs and Googling everywhere, but I can't seem to find any documentation on how to listen for a message that should come back to an Actor that was spawned in the test.\n ​\n I've tried adding a new parameter to the CreateSession message to supply the probe ref, but then the probe receives the message instead of the taskManager actor, and thus the taskManager won't complete the changes that I need to test subsequently. I do know that the taskManager value does have a ref, but it doesn't have a receiveMessage method, so I'm stumped here.\n ​\n Any help is appreciated!

On the PureScript side, we use our own purescript-react-basic bindings, and purescript-lumi-components, a UI component library that we built and open-sourced. We get a lot of utility from PureScript’s type system, leveraging the compiler in order to ensure that we don’t get IDs for different entities mixed up, that all API calls are type correct, and that all form data is appropriately validated before it is used. On the Haskell side, we primarily use Servant and Esqueleto. We don’t expect candidates to have experience with all these things. We’d like to find engineers who are interested in learning more about these, and we’ll be happy to teach you.\n Lumi was recently acquired by Narvar, where we are continuing to grow the team and leveraging Narvar’s experience building the software infrastructure that powers billions of e-commerce shipments for companies like Patagonia, Nike, GAP, Home Depot, etc.\n    submitted by    /u/kepano  \n [link]   [comments]",

I had originally thought to use org-roam-protocol's roam-ref, but I think I don't understand how the file-ref which org-roam-protocol requires works.\n It seems intended mostly for citation purposes, which I think could work (maybe there'd be a way to get from emacs back to the projectwarrior project eventually?). But to do that, I think I'd need to write some sort of custom citation format. Unfortunately my Google-fu is failing me at the moment, as searching \"new org-ref protocol\", \"custom org-roam-ref citation format\" and several other related results hasn't brought up any results that pointed me in the right direction. So, here's the question(s):\n  \nIs there a way I can suppress the warnings from org-roam when I put a ref that is plaintext? This isn't actually my preferred solution, but I figure I'd start here.\n Is there a place I can find instructions on how to create a custom whatever-it-is that org-roam is expecting in the ref field?\n Is there another approach to opening (or creating if necessary) an org-roam node from the command line?

I am trying to decide which one to use in the future. \n I really enjoy org-mode. The only problem for me is that since I do not do programming, I do not know any computer language. I have to copy and paste settings by other people for different purposes, such as spelling check, formatting, preview, etc. RMarkdown in RStudio sets up things for me and I can download some packages by others without any specific setup. \n I also feel that I do not fully use amazing functions of org-mode. For example, while I really like the to-do list and agenda, I do not know how to seamlessly synchronize my calendar (Mac OS) and my org-mode agenda. Many of my meetings are scheduled by others sending me .ics files. I can just go to my calendar and click \"accept\" or \"decline\". Is there a way to automatically make the item appear in my org-mode agenda when I add items on my apple calendar? \n Anyway, maybe too much information here.

Ex first name is column A, last in b.\n 2- I have set up an org file, to dump this data, via capture, mostly so I can easily keep a log of when I enter due to an unrelated headache. I have a custom DONE keyword and associated it with a key, but more than often I accidentally have shift held, so org-todo quits. Is there a way to apply my keyword regardless if i press a or A for example? In org-capture, if I assigned a, but do A, we're told to try again. I am aware that allowing this could cause issues if I assign lower and upper to keywords.\n my function\n  (defun me/kill-ring-save () \"Adds to line to kill-ring if not marked, and puts a message in the minibuffer. If something is marked, that region is added.\" (interactive) (if (equal mark-active nil) (progn (kill-ring-save (point) (line-end-position)) (message \"Copied the line!\") ) (progn (kill-ring-save (point) (mark)) (message \"Copied selected region!\") ) ) ) \n    submitted by    /u/rguy84  \n [link]   [comments]",

Whenever I have a heading, like \"* This is a heading\" and press RET, I used to be brought to a newline, and moved inwards 3 characters.

Interestingly, when I am in auto-fill-mode, when the text begins to wrap around, it will indent appropriately. I have also found that C-o also does not indent, and is effectively the same as C-j\n I am not sure what has changed, but I am in wayland currently, and I don't think that should have and impact on expected performance, but I would never know.\n I tried org-indent-mode to see if that is what I was missing, but that seems to be doing something else entirely.\n ​\n EDIT: fixed, i had to set org-adapt-indentation\n https://orgmode.org/manual/Hard-indentation.html#DOCF150\n ​\n EDIT2: This change does not seem to be working out, actually.

          "description": "Hello,\n I am new to Org, so I may have missed something obvious but, reading the Quick start guide or the documentation, I am not sure to understand how export is supposed to work in regards to headings. Quoting the Quick start Guide:\n  \nLines that start with an asterisk * are headings. \n A single * denotes a 1st-level heading, ** denotes a 2nd-level heading, etc.\n  \nSo far, everything is clear. We have headings, with levels. Fine. Where I stop following is when I export, say to a html buffer (C-c C-e h H) every heading level has been decreased: one star headings are tagged as h2 and two stars as h3. Here, on a very basic test file: \n https://preview.redd.it/p9pbaypvm8j81.png?width=1165&format=png&auto=webp&s=23832603cda8cec5ff07bd711f661d8fe71f2902\n Since I am rather new to Org and to Emacs, I imagined I had some issue with my Org configuration or that I screwed up something elsewhere in Emacs, as I so often do. So I tried on a clean install (no ~/.emacs.d, no init.el) and got the same result, on a Debian 11 machine btw. \n What's bugging me is that I can't find mention of this in the doc. \n Could you tell me if it is the expected behavior? And if so, is there a way to tell Org to preserve the original heading levels?\n Thank you :)\n    submitted by    /u/yal_g  \n [link]   [comments]",

After each run the scripts upload everything (binaries produced and scripts used) here:\n https://corwin.bru.st/emacs-28\n In addition to what gets posted to the alpha FTP site, the scripts make and upload \"NATIVE_FULL_AOT\" versions (from the emacs-28 and master branches, currently).\n If you aren't familiar, passing NATIVE_FULL_AOT=1 to make triggers full ahead-of-time native elisp compilation. In the case of Windows builds, this means the build will include DLLs for most/all elisp sources distributed with Emacs. These DLLs can be used without additional pre-requisites apart from what is included in emacs-<version>.zip (or emacs-<version>-installer.exe). This is useful when you can't --don't want-- to put GCC/libgccjit on a Windows system where you use Emacs.\n Thanks much for all of the help testing out the builds I've been making and in advance for your feedback on the AOT versions.\n    submitted by    /u/mplscorwin  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello all,\n I've started a new job writing lisp, and using emacs as the default environment. I'm still learning the editor (and the language), but the part I'm having the most trouble adapting to is C-z C-x C-c C-v commands that are standard with Windows. Given that I've used those commands since I've used computers in general, I don't think it's going to be easy to switch over.\n I've seen that there is a mode that sort of removes that possibility, CUA mode, but it seems like it would interfere with most of the slime commands. C-c and C-x seem to be very busy keys.\n And so I have thought of a solution that I think would work, and it's crackpot enough that I think trying it will be fun. I'm not completely sure it will work, and so am requesting community input.\n OK, so here's the plan. I'm going to de-mothball my custom keyboard which allows me to remap keys. Then I would remap the Caps-Lock key to one of the F13-F24 keys, and then using that as the Control for emacs sequences. C-c would be (Caps lock)-c and C-x would be (Caps lock)-x. I think that's possible to change in my init file? Emacs has proven to be a remarkable beast in its extensibility and I'm like 90% sure that this is doable.\n Anyway, I am wondering if there is some obvious problem with this plan, other than the glaringly obvious one which is that it's less trouble to just learn the shortcuts. (What's the fun in that, though?)\n    submitted by    /u/Acebulf  \n [link]   [comments]",

I don't remember if I did anything to break it, but the config file is the same on both. \n I ran the esup profiler and it tells that the total user startup time is 0.123 sec, which is obviously not true (or the the slowdown is not due to the config file). \n Any idea on what might be going on or how to accurately profile the startup process?\n    submitted by    /u/jmhimara  \n [link]   [comments]",

If you want to edit it yourself, I've got the original .drawio file in the gist too, but it only renders as text. You'd have to save it and open it with https://www.diagrams.net/ or the application you can download from there.\n I am still trying to figure out the best presentation of the printable version, so any general suggestions will be very much appreciated. The aim is to have something that will be visible and useful printed on a sheet of Letter or A4 paper, viewed from about 3 feet away.

I spotted the conda.el package, and tried to install it with use-package : elisp (use-package conda :ensure t :init (setq conda-anaconda-home (expand-file-name \"~/miniconda3\")) (setq conda-env-home-directory (expand-file-name \"~/miniconda3\")) :config (conda-env-initialize-interactive-shells) (conda-env-initialize-eshell))  This does not pose any issue when evaluated (and I've checked on github, people do it that way). My miniconda install is indeed in ~/miniconda3. However, when I try to execute M-x conda-env-activate, I get the following message : Symbol's value as variable is void : proper-dir\n Has anyone any idea how to fix this?

Based on my experience over the years and specially in the recent times, not many people know about the wonderful world of Emacs and why it is such a fascinating tool. To me they are missing out a chance to enjoy Emacs. So, a while ago I've decided to create a video series and talk about Emacs Lisp in context of a long running project to create an \"editor\" with Emacs Lisp, In hope to help more people to enjoy the tool that changed the way I use computers and brought me joy over all these years.\n Yesterday, I recorded the 4th episode of the video series. I thought to myself that It might be a good idea to share it on this subreddit as well. I have a looooooong term plan for this series and looking forward to your feedback.\n Like to the latest episode(4): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NE1XUfrrGYI\n Link to the playlist: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkfndJuDzsA&list=PLlONLmJCfHToFfk1WgTOwZMfIr062jIN9&index=1\n Cheers\n    submitted by    /u/lxsameer  \n [link]   [comments]",

My favorite is cape-company-to-capf which converts company backends to completion-at-point-functions!

This is because I may later use it in talks, white-papers, etc., where preserving the vector quality is crucial.\n So, after some time trying (and failing) to convince myself such functionality must already exist, I wrote up a small package.

Other than Ord-mode I would mostly use Emacs to write Markdown and LaTeX files and potentially some R. \n It appears Aquamacs is finally actively maintained again but there seem to be some advantages of sticking to a more \"classic\" Emacs port. Any recommendations are very much appreciated.\n    submitted by    /u/torte13  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I have been on a quest to decrease my Emacs startup time and found something that I haven't seen mentioned on any of the blogs I came across on the topic. I think it is fairly well known that if you use straight.el, deactivating package.el in your early-init.el will speed up your starting time. What I only just found out is that on launch, straight does a lot of checks to see if any of the packages installed have been altered. This process can be changed by modifying the straight-check-for-modifications variable. I don't edit any of my straight packages by hand, so I have this set to nil, before bootstrapping straight. This brought my startup time from ~2 seconds to ~0.5 seconds, for loading over 200 packages. Maybe there are some reasons why one shouldn't do this that I don't know, but it seems to be a nice way to save some time!\n For more information, see this section of straight's read-me: https://github.com/raxod502/straight.el#customizing-when-packages-are-built\n Hopefully this is of help to someone!\n    submitted by    /u/jamez5800  \n [link]   [comments]",

However, I'd like to start moving some of that stuff out so I can manage it myself and make comments. I tried pulling some stuff out and putting into my init.el, but it didn't work. Namely, I pulled out these:\n '(org-todo ((((class color) (min-colors 89)) (:weight normal :box (:line-width 1 :color \"#808080\") :foreground \"#FF00FF\" :background \"#f0f0f0\")))) '(org-upcoming-deadline ((t (:foreground \"#FF33FF\")))) '(org-warning ((t (:background \"#ffffa0\" :foreground \"#ff33ff\" :weight normal)))) \n Why don't these work within my init.el? I tried them before and after my (load custom-file).\n EDIT: Ok I see I'm supposed to use set-face-attribute. So I tried wrapping the above, but this doesn't work\n (set-face-attribute 'org-todo ((((class color) (min-colors 89)) (:weight normal :box (:line-width 1 :color \"#808080\") :foreground \"#FF00FF\" :background \"#f0f0f0\")))) \n EDIT 2: I figured out the answer. A correct, commonly used form for set-face-attribute is like this:\n (set-face-attribute 'org-todo nil :box '(:line-width 1 :color \"#808080\") :weight 'normal :foreground \"#FF00FF\" :background \"#f0f0f0\") \n And it probably didn't work with a straight copy because each of those first three lines, I think those are args to the function (custom-set-faces...). I don't know what it does behind the scenes, but I guess it wants its args in a certain format.\n    submitted by    /u/Status-Detective-783  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have already built all the muscle memory and don't want a different set of keys.\n - Going through all the documentation of the packages to get the exact setup as I had in spacemacs is very tricky. Sometimes spacemacs has some clever ways of handling things, which needs me to look into spacemacs code.\n - Going over spacemacs code is complex.

If I remember correctly, my major issue was that the built-in functionality only worked for windows displaying exwm buffers but I wanted all windows to be treated equally. I also threw in a completing-read interface that I though I would use but haven't found much use for it. Instead I find the functionality to move windows to a specific workspace by number far more useful. \n ​\n Anyways, feedback welcome.

I am running 28.0.91 with native comp on Mojave.\n The stated startup time on the splash screen is normally 2-3 seconds: \"Doom loaded 208 packages across 34 modules in 2.06 seconds\". Restoring my previous workspace with 20-30 buffers takes 7-8 seconds. Opening a file in a project takes 1-2 seconds. At first I thought it was due to LSP mode, but it's still slow even with it disabled.\n I have followed some of the recommendations in Doom's README \"why is Doom slow?\", but my situation seems a bit more pathological than what those try to address. \n I tried profiling opening a single line file (took a second or two) and the CPU profile says that it spent 28% of its time in automatic GC and 51% of its time in vertico--advice. I'm assuming that was the file selection popup, so it appears that Emacs is really just spending all its time waiting for something. I'd be grateful for advice how to debug further.\n    submitted by    /u/bambataa199  \n [link]   [comments]",

Or alternatively, achieve this:\n  \nExample 3\n * PROJECTS... * x <--- point here at space marked x * Inbox... \n \n I know that if I start with Example 1 and I press C-S-RET, I'll get this:\n  \nExample 4\n * PROJECTS... * TODO x <--- point here at space marked x * Inbox... \n \n That's good enough for TODO's, but I'd like to do something similar for the other cases. But it's odd that it leaves a space there (why does it do that?). I'd rather it not, but I'll accept this standard behavior, for now, if that's just the way it works out-of-the-box. (I know I can change emacs to do whatever I want though.) Also, the C-S-RET behaves a little different if the point starts at the end of * Projects...x at space marked x. In that case, it creates something like this:\n  \nExample 5\n * PROJECTS... * TODO x <--- point here at space marked x * Inbox... \n \n In Example 5, it creates a new TODO item under the last child entry of * PROJECTS, but leaving * PROJECTS otherwise folded. Isn't it a little odd to have an intermediate parent invisible? \n Finally, does that last point position (marked x here:* Projects...x) have special meaning/purpose? Is there a name for that position?\n EDIT: I think some of my questions about the functionality of ellipses and spaces is probably related to this timely post: https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/t1r2wq/have_you_ever_wondered_how_orgmode_toggles_the/.

One of the intended use cases is to prevent commands for one major mode from showing up when working in another major mode. It's nil by default, but you can (setq read-extended-command-predicate 'command-completion-default-include-p)... except for the fact that basically no package I can find actually uses this, either by using\n (defun foo () (declare (modes . (lisp-mode))) (interactive) (message \"I only show up in some-mode\")) \n or by (put 'foo 'command-modes '(lisp-mode)). I'd like to go through all the commands whose names start with (say) python- and mark them as being python-mode commands. What's the easiest way to do that?\n PS, is there any downside to package authors doing this? The declare variation warns on older versions of emacs, but the put variation should work no matter what. I'm really surprised this has almost no adoption/conversation that I could find.

But if you set org-agenda-sticky to t , calling org-store-link from an agenda buffer gives the following error:\n user-error: No method for storing a link from this buffer \n After digging around a bit I think I found the culprit: for the agenda relevant behavior of org-store-link to be activated, you need to be in a buffer with the name specified in org-agenda-buffer-name. On my end, org-agenda-buffer-name is set to *Org Agenda*, but when org-agenda-sticky is set to t, agenda buffers have a different name of the form *Org Agenda(VIEW)*, where VIEW is the key to the relevant agenda view (so, e.g. *Org Agenda(a)*).\n Now, if I set org-agenda-buffer-name to e.g. *Org Agenda(a)*, I get org-store-link to work as expected when visiting an agenda buffer with that name. But I do not seem to be able to use org-agenda-buffer-name to get Emacs to recognize an agenda buffer when org-agenda-sticky is set to t.\n Any ideas?\n    submitted by    /u/graduale  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I am having a couple issues. I used to use mu4e for my gmail, and then switched away from mu4e to just using org-capture in the browser to capture the mails I need. This works well b/c the link to each email message is unique and persistent. However,\n  \nI recently started a job where we use an exchange server and access it online via outlook webmail. The org-capture browser function doesn't work well for this because the link to the message is (1) not easily captured and (2) is not persistent, e.g., it changes when I move the message to a different folder\n So I started using mu4e again, but it appears that refiling does not seem to sync. When I refile messages in mu4e it somehow disappears and I can't find it in outlook, even though the message is in the correct folder in my maildir. Why would this be? \n I made a test folder in outlook to see if that would sync and it did sync, and the folder appeared in my maildir\n I then made that folder the location of my refile function, and same thing happened, the message disappeared and is no longer visible in outlook. \n \n  \nAny thoughts on why refiling messages makes them disappear? Is it just some exchange server setting that I can't get around, or is it an easy fix on my end? \n Thank you!\n    submitted by    /u/tiktaaliki  \n [link]   [comments]",

I want to use Xilinx XST compiler. Let me explain.\n First, you can select compiler from drop-down menu. There are Compiler1 and Compiler2 options. If you tinker with these options, some text is saved to my emacs-custom.el file, but I can't see that something is configured there. To me it seems like it copied just to whole compilers list into that emacs-custom.el. Maybe it saves some options in other place too and I'm not aware of it?\n Second, which works, but its value is not saved anywhere! It looks like this. I have tried to put (vhdl-set-compiler \"Xilinx XST\")\n and it returned that error that function is void. If I do it manually by fallowing vhdl-mode drop-down menu, and then selecting \"Xilinx XST\" compiler, it works. But just in this emacs session.

What is the best way to install emacs with these features? Do I have to build it from source? And if so are there specific flags or options that need to be enabled for it to be compiled with those options enabled? or are they enabled by default now?\n Thanks!\n EDIT: I managed to build it from source using the following and it (mostly) works:\n Into a directory: git clone https://git.savannah.gnu.org/git/emacs.git\n Then ran: ./autogen.sh in that directory\n Then ran: ./configure --with-pgtk --with-native-compilation --with-mailutils\n It kept failing until I installed all the following additional packages with sudo dnf install:\n  \nautoconf (to run the ./autogen.sh command)\n texinfo (for the makeinfo requirement)\n gtk3-devel (for the pgtk requirement)\n libgccjit-devel (for the native-comp requirement)\n gnutls-devel (because it needed gnutls-devel)\n ncurses-devel (it needed something in this package but I forget what)\n  \nThen ran make (took a while) then sudo make install in the directory and it installed!

The article basically explains what are Avy actions and how to create new ones. This got me inspired to create my own Avy actions, which I'd like to share with the community in the form of a literate config.\n The shared config, extends some notions and creates new ones (some left as a kind-of challenge in the mentioned article):\n ​\n - Region actions: actions that act in an arbitrary not visible region created with avy selections (copy, yank, kill, teleport). First you mark the initial point of the region with an action, then you execute a region action on the other end of the region.\n - Quick char commands: skip the initial filtering step of an Avy command pre-filtering a character. For example I use this in emacs-lisp mode to auto filter open parenthesis with a key binding, this is very useful as actions act on Sexp.\n - Auto actions: enable the automatic execution of an avy action on a selected candidate\n - Compound actions and commands: link several avy interactions in a single command or action using auto actions. This is useful for example for region actions, instead of executing two Avy commands to first mark the start of the region with a command and then select and act on the end of the region; you only execute a command that integrates two Avy interactions, the first one auto applies the mark action, then you select the action and element at the end of the region.

I don't want to build a second brain or create a personal wiki, instead I want to capture and link ideas for researching and writing.\n Using org, I'm naturally drawn to org-roam, however, I dislike the bulk of dependencies and its complexity stemming. Furthermore, I dislike, that I can't get a textual overview of a subset of notes belonging together (using a webserver-solution like org-roam-ui is not what I want here). Looking at the new zk-package, I want to note that I like its simple and clean approach, but I dislike, certain design decisions, like using spaces in file names and the fact, that it doesn't integrate deeply in the org-ecosystem, e.g. not utilizizing org-IDs. The last point is the biggest downside imho. While one could hack on the codebase to change this, another drawback seems to be that it is not really mature and doesn't seem to have a large userbase. \n Currently, I'm try out both of these very different options, but I can't really decide for on or the other, since both have different strengths and downsides. Therefore, I want ask for your opinions and experience with implementing the Zettelkasten-method (or a personalized derivation of it).

I found a function called rustic-run-cargo-command, which has this as it's description: \"Start compilation process for 'cargo run' with optional RUN-ARGS\". \n But i cannot seem to find a way to provide these optional arguments. Can anyone guide me on this issue?

Then in my second zettel, I open a [[]] and inside I paste the UID number of the first zettel. The [[UID]] becomes green. When I hover on it it says that the file is not found. When I click on it, a search is launched and I have my two zettels that appear in the search bar but the target zettel does not open automatically. Is it normal? Should it only open in the search bar?\nI saw that a \"#\" was sometimes set before the UID (in the body) of the zettel of origin.

Does The Archive support LaTeX? If not, are there some workarounds for this to be possible? What other note-taking software is out there that has bi-directional linking and LaTeX support as well?\nHave a good day everyone",

Well, possibly yes: I have a high taste for curiosity \nI have discovered zettelkasten(ing) a few weeks ago and it arrived at a perfect timing! I am reorganizing my whole “knowledge management” and my workflow.  As a dad of two small kids, the primary caretaker of a house and a phd candidate during pandemic times (I don’t know what went through my head to pursue that route), I highly need some effectivity.\nI have started my own zettelkasten and I am trying at the same time to understand how the zettelkasten system works and most importantly how to make it most effective for me. And let’s be honest, I am really torn between analog and digital and see benefits in both. I like the tactile and sensory aspect of the analog, and I like the effectiveness of the digital, plus I learn a lot on software and programmes (thanks to you Forum, markdown has come to my knowledge and I am learning how to use it).\nCheers!",

Citations are still just reminders for later.\nThe inclusion of the zettelkasten into the lexicon of contemporary productivity scenes, many of which view note-taking systems through the lens of task and project management, has led to confusion as to what a zettelkasten is and for what it can be used. This confusion becomes particularly apparent when comparing zettelkasten to other note-taking methodologies, where the zettelkasten is seen as an advanced (and sometimes outdated) way to store and retrieve notes. I'd like to argue that the zettelkasten should not be considered within the lineage of agnostic note-storing systems and apps, but rather as something else entirely: a note-making and note-linking me…",

I've gotten as far as downloading Obsidian, reading the first chapter of a book called \"The Bitcoin Standard,\" writing fleeting notes, and then polishing the relevant ones into literature notes. What repeatedly evades my understanding, however, is the nature of links.\nI do not know when or how to use links. For example, if I have a note that defines the economic term \"coincidence of wants,\" and I have another note discussing how \"indirect exchange enables coincidence of wants in a diverse economy,\" should I: reference \"coincidence\" inside \"indirect exchange\"; reference \"indirect exchange\" in \"coincidence\"; do both of those; not link them at all but tag both notes with \"coincidence of wants\" and find them when I do the color-coded tag search?\nAnd then there's the matter of linking two (seemingly) unrelated ideas. Do they get linked to each other, and then to a third note of the new idea they inspire? Both notes separately linked to the third?\nHelp is appreciated.",
