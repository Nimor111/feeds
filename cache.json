This idea is known under many other names, such as \"Boolean blindness\" or \"Parse don't validate\".\n Most of the examples in this episode should be understandable to newcomers.\n The Haskell Unfolder is a YouTube series about all things Haskell hosted by Edsko de Vries and Andres Löh, with episodes appearing approximately every two weeks.\n We also have a GitHub repository with the code samples from the episodes:\n https://github.com/well-typed/unfolder\n And we have a public Google calendar listing the planned schedule:\n https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/embed?src=c_327de9ca66caa0307fd99de5b0e3fdd2ad1111ae857bd21659166c74b2b974f0@group.calendar.google.com\n (or ICal: https://calendar.google.com/calendar/ical/c_327de9ca66caa0307fd99de5b0e3fdd2ad1111ae857bd21659166c74b2b974f0%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic.ics )\n    submitted by    /u/kosmikus  \n [link]   [comments]",

The GHC User’s Guide suggests that it should be fairly simple to accomplish. But the relevant GHC Wiki article says there are problems with the ordinal value getting too large when the DLL has too many symbols. Normally I’d discount a 4-year-old article in favour of the current user’s guide… except that when I tried compiling to a DLL, I did indeed get an error message saying that the ordinals were too large. On Linux, each package is compiled to a separate .so file, which keeps them fairly small, but when I try the same GHC options on Windows, it just complains that there are no 'dyn' versions of the dependencies. Which would seem to indicate that it would work if I could compile the dependencies dynamically, but I can’t find any information on how to do so. This whole situation is quite confusing, and I would greatly appreciate some clarification on GHC’s support for compiling shared libraries on Windows.\n  \n   submitted by    /u/brdrcn  \n [link]   [comments]",

There is also a mapM which returns the foldable type containing the result of each computation, but in this case we use the underscore version since we're only concerned with the side-effects of putStrLn.\n Sometimes it's boring to sit for hours and sift through the docs to find functions like mapM_, so I think these kinds of concrete examples are really nice for people who are just getting comfortable with Haskell.\n Upvote if you learned something!\n ```haskell fizzBuzz :: Int -> String fizzBuzz n = case (mod n 3, mod n 5) of (0, 0) -> \"FizzBuzz\" (0, ) -> \"Fizz\" (, 0) -> \"Buzz\" (_, _) -> show n\n main :: IO () main = mapM_ (putStrLn . fizzBuzz) [1..100] ```\n    submitted by    /u/Dr_Alg  \n [link]   [comments]",

(https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis1940/spring13/hw/08-IO.pdf)\n But my question is more related to the algorithm. \n Basically, as I understand it, the problem boils down to basically doing DP on trees. We need to select some nodes from the tree that maximizes a sum based on the condition that if we select a node, then its parent cannot be selected (based on \"whose immediate boss is also at the party will not have any fun at all\"). Thus, I take it that immediate means direct parent only right? \n To help you out, here's a tree diagram. The green checkmark represents nodes that are selected. Bob is selected despite being grandparent to John and Sue, and it's perfectly fine right? \n https://preview.redd.it/od6vzv6vb1bb1.png?width=2265&format=png&auto=webp&s=21d698a7e5c0cbe09f0d01bb2c8fbcf36e8b768b\n Another one:\n https://preview.redd.it/bdmgh8hvb1bb1.png?width=2265&format=png&auto=webp&s=b0ca9e69ef30efcb66e49796ae40f9c3afc86e17\n The reason I ask this is when I was comparing my solution (https://github.com/aditya211935/CIS-194/blob/main/week-8/Party.hs#L32) with other solutions (https://github.com/OctaviPascual/cis194-IntroductionToHaskell/blob/master/homework-08/Party.hs#L83), almost all of them in the case where we don't take current element, don't take max of both values of the subtree, but only take the second value. \n I checked a lot of other solutions and all of them have some bug or the other, so I'm unable to verify my solution. Would really appreciate any help in verifying my solution. For context, my solution on parsing \"company.txt\" produced \"33200\".\n    submitted by    /u/chodbahadur2  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi everyone,\n We are very excited to announce Copilot 3.16 [2]. Copilot is a stream-based EDSL in Haskell for writing and monitoring embedded C programs, with an emphasis on correctness and hard realtime requirements. Copilot is typically used as a high-level runtime verification framework, and supports temporal logic (LTL, PTLTL and MTL), clocks and voting algorithms.\n Copilot has been used at NASA in drone test flights. Through the NASA tool Ogma [1] (also written in Haskell), Copilot also serves as a runtime monitoring backend for NASA's Core Flight System, Robot Operating System (ROS2), and FPrime (the software framework used in the Mars Helicopter) applications.\n This new version provides comprehensive tests for the C99 backend, and introduces a breaking change in the definition of the type Arg in copilot-language. For details, see [2]. The new version is already available on Hackage [4].\n As always, we're releasing exactly 2 months since the last release. Our next release is scheduled for Sep 7th, 2023.\n We are also extremely excited to announce that Copilot has received full approval for release as NASA Class D open-source software. Current emphasis is on increasing test coverage for the two remaining libraries without tests (copilot-language and copilot-theorem), removing unnecessary dependencies, hiding internal definitions, and formatting the code to meet our new coding standards. Users are encouraged to participate by opening issues and asking questions via our github repo [3].\n There have been many updates on the Copilot front in the last few months. We'll be able to announce more soon. Stay tuned. Happy Haskelling!\n Ivan\n [1] https://github.com/nasa/ogma\n [2] https://github.com/Copilot-Language/copilot/releases/tag/v3.16\n [3] https://github.com/Copilot-Language/copilot\n [4] https://hackage.haskell.org/package/copilot\n    submitted by    /u/ivanpd  \n [link]   [comments]",

In general, I think it is great (I enjoy more the scala2 syntax) but documentation is kind of lacking, and native libraries are all over the place. Having to deal with sbt was a thing and making intellij lint, compile and run was an experience. My last complaint is that I had to create my own dockerfile which I am really bad at, like it was really hard to find anything for Scala. \n Despite that I really enjoy working with Scala as a Java developer, probably will never get a job on it because I dislike data science and at least where I live there is like 0 demand. I am thinking of doing comparable projects in C# and Kotlin to see how they compare to Java and Scala. Hopefully, Scala will regain some popularity but for that, they will probably need a big company behind it, improve documentation, and better native libraries. \n The last thing, this is my opinion and I am dumb as a rock so you have all the right to criticize my incoherent bag of words and correct me if I am wrong\n    submitted by    /u/Mpata2000  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "In some distributed protocols, servers (actors) transition between different roles at different times, and accept different subset of messages depending on the role.\n Ideally, an actor should always hold a reference to another actor typed in such a way that it is impossible for it to send the wrong type of message (i.e., a message that the other cannot accept because it is in the wrong role).\n The inherent problem is that, like I said, an actor can change role over time, and so the subset of messages it accepts; thus, all other actors holding a reference to it would actually start to hold a wrongly typed reference.\n Specifically, I am thinking to Raft consensus algorithm, where (for example) a server in follower state would not accept an AppendEntriesResponse message, but it is going to be able to accept it as soon as it transitions to leader state. If the behaviors are parametrized with a Raft type that comprises all messages (including AppendEntriesResponse), then it is easy to wrongfully send an AppendEntries to a follower.\n Does Akka have a pattern for this?\n Does this pattern also apply to actors running in clusters? Does it apply to both types of communication (ask, tell)?\n I know that it is possible for an actor to explicitly ignore some messages, but I believe it can become a bit cumbersome and perhaps prone to errors. Moreover, it does not eliminate the issue that I described above.\n    submitted by    /u/steddola  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "So the context is: Cats-effect or any m:n scheduler, Node, and Kube\n When working with NodeJs on a machine with multiple cores you are forced to spawn multiple Node processes to utilize it. With Kube though, there is no reason to do so. Instead of giving a single process 8 cores you spawn 8 pods with cpu:1.\n My question is - how much of a reason do I have to give my cats-effect app 8 core vs spawning 8 instances?\n And also how much of a bottleneck is the process of serialization with cats services trying to do a lot of concurrent IO aka web servers? It's anecdotal since I was not there but at work, it was observed that NodeJs is dying very fast under the pressure of grpc encoding/decoding. But it seemed to me to be a mistaken judgment since it should be the same in cats/tokio/what-have-you so I think it was just easier for them to ramp up those core numbers with scala.\n    submitted by    /u/lionflzcfxpcuugdsh  \n [link]   [comments]",

(Using different parameter names worked, but they're logically the same thing, so I want to keep the names identical.)\n Of course, I can do it without trait parameters, as in:  trait ExampleTrait { def param: Int } case class Class(override val param: Int) extends ExampleTrait val x = (Class(1): ExampleTrait).param \n However, I thought maybe that would be doable using trait parameters.\n (No, it's not essential that I use a trait parameter.

By incorporating side effects, we extend this representation to I => F[O], where F[_] denotes the ability to handle side effects.\n Resources\n To build an app, we rely on resources such as app information, input arguments, a logger, and configuration settings.\n With t…",

Currently I do just about everything in Python, SQL with a sprinkle of R. I know some Scala 2, Java and C++ as well. To me, Scala always felt like the ideal marriage of having a great type system and not having the annoying things you'd associate from static typing.\n I think the pessimism hurts adoption as folk like myself become skeptical. That's sad because at least in theory the language does exactly what people like me need: a pragmatic yet principled way to make software. Scala 3, especially, looks flexible enough for scripting and interactive stuff with for example polynote. Type safety also reduces the footguns compared to Python.\n It won't deter me, I'll keep on going but at the very least I wanted to share my thoughts.\n    submitted by    /u/Odd-One8023  \n [link]   [comments]",

While I can only speak from my personal experience I don't really see the point here. It seems to me that other languages and ecosystems get away with big changes:\n  \nPython's adoption has only increased after the infamous 2 -> 3 version change.\n JavaScript itself is backwards-compatible with older versions, but the JS ecosystem keeps changing a lot. For example the industry was happy to adopt React even though it introduces breaking changes with major version updates.\n  \nWhat are your takes on this matter? Is feature churn that much higher in Scala? Has language instability been discussed in your organization? Has it impacted any team's decision to use or not use Scala? Will the introduction of LTS versions help Scala's adoption grow in the long-term or will it just make library maintainers happier?\n    submitted by    /u/inb4_singularity  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have some funding to do this, so it's not just a hobbyist project (though it started that way).\n Creating the Halogen components would be simple enough if one takes inspiration from gojs-react. The issue is that there are no PureScript bindings for the GoJS types themselves, but GoJS does provide .ts.d declarations, which means I could use purescript-read-dts, but that library's maturity/usability seems somewhat ambiguous, according to an author's post from 3 years ago.\n Conceptually I'm thinking of generating the bindings, trying to call the code from just PureScript, and adjusting the bindings manually for implicitly effectful computations. I'm not an experienced PureScript (or Javascript really) developer so I'm wondering what the community thinks of such a project.

Your TODO's all have at least one, but possibly more, tags. Those tags are \"Work\", \"School\", \"Personal\", \"Spouse\", \"Home\", and \"Fun\", for example. At the end of the year, you want to know how you divided your time. Is there an easy way to produce output like this:\n  \nWork - 30\n School - 28\n Personal - 24\n Spouse - 20\n Home - 17\n Fun - 11\n  \nExample #2 - Avg Time\n You spend a year completing tasks. At the end of that year, is there an easy way to display how long tasks took to complete? Maybe broken down by tag?\n I'm sure there are lots of other ways of summarizing and splicing the various meta data collected, so if anyone has any suggestions, I'm open to it.\n    submitted by    /u/burningEyeballs  \n [link]   [comments]",

Type M-x, watch your frame shrink. \n People have suggested things like \n  (setq frame-resize-pixelwise t) ; nope (setq frame-inhibit-implied-resize t) ; nope \n This does not work. I haven't found a solution yet other than running emacs in terminal mode. However I do have a new piece of data to add.\n When, in an Fedora 38 environment where emacs is broken, I ssh -X to a Fedora 36 environment where emacs is not broken, and run emacs remotely but display it locally on F38, the broken behavior manifests.\n This means it's nothing about emacs 28.2 that is the problem, it's just some interaction with emacs and whatever passes for the X server and window environment. I have yet to find any KDE behavior stuff I can tweak to fix it, and emacs tweaks have been similarly ineffective. SO ... looking for more help if anybody has it. I plead ignorance on X vs Wayland and what would traditionally be emacs in X client interactions.\n    submitted by    /u/Decweb  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Emacs comes with two built-in IRC clients, rcirc and erc. The latter has a history entry in its manual ((info \"(erc) History\")) and thus sheds a little bit of light on its age:\n  \n7 History\n  \nERC was originally written by Alexander L. Belikoff and Sergey Berezin. They stopped development around December 1999. Their last released version was ERC 2.0.\n ...\n 2006\n ERC 5.1 was released. It was subsequently included in Emacs 22.\n  \nrcirc on the other hand is missing such an entry, but the copyright starts at 2006, roughly around the inclusion of ERC within Emacs. If you searche the Emacs manual for IRC, you end up with two mentions, one within Acknowledgments for ERC, one for \"Bug Reference\":\n  \n3. Setup for IRC channels configurable by the variable ‘bug-reference-setup-from-irc-alist’. The built-in IRC clients Rcirc, and ERC, are supported.\n  \nNowhere within Emacs do I find a comparison why there are two, and whether there are different use cases for both.\n With that in mind: what are the (architectural?) differences between ERC and rcirc? If ERC already existed, why was rcirc also included in Emacs?\n Thanks in advance!\n    submitted by    /u/qZeta  \n [link]   [comments]",

Since, headings and sub-headings are a lot, so I'm used to only showing first-level headings and opening up a certain heading when I know exactly that it has sub-headings. If I use C-Tab, all second-level sub-headings of first-headings will be shown up, which adds more obstacle for navigating!\n In ideal, sub-headings of their parent heading should also have this symbol in the end of them, if they have their own sub-headings.\n It's gonna be a dream to come into reality, so I can finally, completely move from zim to emacs.

If cursor is already at the end of the screen line, point should move to the end of the physical line.\n Pos1 should behave likewise, with an additional twist: If point is at the beginning of a screen line but not at the beginning of the physical line, it moves to the beginning of the physical line. If I additionally press pos1 and the beginning of the physical line is a blank character (character class), it moves to the first non-blank character of the line. Another Pos1 again toggles jumping to the first physical character in the line.\n I am sure this can be configured - as pretty much everything in Emacs.

I'm under the impression that string-equal is comparing \"yes\" and \"%\\\\1\" and thus evaluating to \"Enjoy\".\n Yes case: If I type in yes at the HOT_SAUCE prompt and press ENTER, the preview changes to:\n ***** Hot Dog Prompt: yes Hot Sauce? yes Enjoy \n No case: If I type in no at the HOT_SAUCE prompt and press ENTER, the preview changes to:\n ***** Hot Dog Prompt: no Hot Sauce? no Enjoy \n In both cases the first format function is re-evaluated with the value entered at the prompt.\n In neither case is the second format function re-evaluated.\n According to the documentation on %(EXP):\n  \nOnly placeholders pre-existing within the template, or introduced with ‘%[file]’, are expanded this way. Since this happens after expanding non-interactive “%-escapes”, those can be used to fill the expression.\n  \nI'm not really sure how to interpret this.\n Question: How can I get the second format function to re-evaluate after I've supplied the HOT_SAUCE value so that it says \"Sign Waiver\" if I enter yes at the prompt?\n Goal: My goal for my capture template to return significantly different text based on the value of prompt values.\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/Sea_Inevitable_5522  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I recently upstreamed some fixes to a project called helm-ls which is a language server for Helm to make it work with eglot. As part of my contribution, they asked for instructions for use with emacs, which I provided in the README.\n The only problem I have with the instructions I gave is that it feels counterintuitive a little bit? The root of the problem is that, while you could edit Helm charts with yaml-mode, adding eglot-ensure to the yaml-mode hook would mean adding (yaml-mode \"helm_ls\" \"server\") to eglot-server-programs, and you probably don't want helm-ls for yaml files that aren't helm charts. Hence my instructions to create a small derived major mode to sidestep the issue.\n That works okay, but means that it becomes hard to automatically enter the newly derived helm-mode. I've read through how emacs chooses major modes, but I couldn't think of a good way to automatically select helm-mode. Ideally, I'd love to have some way of telling auto-mode-alist to traverse up the current buffer's directory until it found files like Chart.yaml and values.yaml that told it the file was actually a Helm chart rather than plain yaml, but it looks like I may be limited to just regex matching the file name, using .dir-locals.el or -*- mode: helm -*- magic.\n Any other ideas/options to make this better?\n Edit: link formatting\n    submitted by    /u/leothrix  \n [link]   [comments]",

Please help me resolve this.\n  \nFor all the double-spacers out here, what do you do when you have to work on someone else's project which uses single-spacing between sentences? Do you have any shortcuts or tricks to switch to single-spacing mode when you are working on their projects?\n \nHow do you space sentences within double quotes, like:\n Bob said, \"I get three apples. You get two apples. Ok?\" Jess responded, \"No, I get three apples. You get two apples.\" Bob was not amused.

I probably search with the wrong terms since I always get links to css frameworks (Tailwind, bulma...).\n What I do miss is - how to add a background to the first page of the pdf - how to add a different one to the other pages - how to add author's information (name, company, copyright...) on a last page...\n ... all this based on the headers or properties of my org document.\n Reading the file htmlize.el did not help.\n Can you please help me or point me in the right direction?\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/fmou67  \n [link]   [comments]",

Whenever I've wanted to make customizations to Spacemacs, the whole layering system is so abstracted from standard Emacs stuff that it was often difficult to figure things out in regards to online sources often using vanilla Emacs for their instructions. But I made do, eventually figuring things out as best I could.\n Recently, I've been learning CLisp (and plan on learning Clojure as well), and I've wanted to start taking advantage of the true power of the dark side of the Force Emacs, which is, creating an editor that's very much specifically tailored to you, because as I want to do certain things, I definitely feel the edges of Spacemacs pushing back.\n For the past few weekends, I've been following along with Emacs from Scratch from System Crafters, looking at some of Prot's stuff, reading the manual where needed, copiously using `describe-function/variable/etc`, reading a bunch of configs that I've found that people have mentioned as being inspirations for them. Things are moving along mostly smoothly and I'm making really great progress and it feels really fantastic to start slowly tailoring things to how I want them....\n ... but then I look at the setup for, say, Clojure, in something like DoomEmacs or Spacemacs or some Emacs expert's config, and I start to feel a bit overwhelmed because, here's a thing that an entire community has worked on to optimize and hack away at and improve and I'm just barely scratching the surface. And as much as I'm really enjoying the journey of customizing GNU Emacs, I'm also a very practical dev and really recognize the benefits of a distro.\n And in moments like these, I kinda just retreat back into Spacemacs because, damn girl, so much work has been done on it!\n Any sage advice on how to tackle this whole process better?\n    submitted by    /u/adudenamedruby  \n [link]   [comments]",

I tried installing doom-modeline but there was no icon support (even after installing nerd-icons). Any suggestions are appreciated!\n Update: Figured it out. 1) As suggested by u/spudlgo I used use-package to install doom-modeline and run nerd-icons-install-font in emacs. This downloaded NFM.ttf in .local/share/fonts 2) Run fc-cashe -fv to update font cashe and then fc-list | grep .local/fonts . This makes a list of all the fonts in the directory. One needs to note down the name of desired font. 3) I opened dconf editor and searched for 'fonts' under terminal folder. The terminal profiles are going to pop up. I copied the name of the font I wanted to the 'font' bar. 4) change the terminal profiles and it's done.\n Note that the changes need to be done in the local machine.

Mostly it is just visual noise and it essentially does not interfere with typing, but combined with copilot it just becomes a noisy kindergarten. I was wondering if there are others out there with similar concerns and how you would tackle this ? \n I have rebound my tab to company-completion for while, but I found it to be a bit uneven, for instance you´'d get nothing if no completion was found, making you doubt if it was working at all. Also, since then I have moved to vertico and from what I gather its completion trigger is organised differently and it also does not solve my copilot issue. \n The reason for this post is that all info on completion is about automating all the tings and shower you with info while doing the dev, b/c we want to be vscode so much. \n Instead I was looking for some inspiration regarding a different paradigm, an on-demand approach with the option to get more info on the class/function/type, or in the case of copilot, a snippet.\n thx. \n    submitted by    /u/Sndr666  \n [link]   [comments]",

Most of the time it works fine, but occasionally (frequently enough to be very annoying, but infrequently enough to be hard to reproduce!) it seems to get \"out of sync\", and I get a bunch of random errors that don't match the file I'm editing.\n For example, I'm currently editing a file that has no genuine errors or problems, but flymake-show-buffer-diagnostic reports 1 error [\"unmatched ')'\"] and 30 warnings (indentation errors, \"unexpected spaces around keyword\", etc.).\n Saving the file makes no difference.\n C-x C-v reloads the file and the errors disappear. Running eglot-reconnect also fixes the errors.\n eglots-events-buffer is a bit hard to interpret but it looks like at least some of the spurious errors are being received from pylsp.\n I don't know how to track down this problem as I don't know which component has the problem. Presuambly it's not flymake, but is Eglot sending the wrong file data? pylsp reporting the wrong thing? Some kind of JSON RPC issue? Something else I'm missing?\n Any tips on how to track down the issue?\n My eglot config is minimal:\n ```\n (use-package eglot\n :ensure t\n :defer t\n :hook (python-mode . eglot-ensure)\n :bind ((\"C-c r\" . eglot-rename)\n (\"C-c C-r\" . eglot-rename))) ```\n I'm running\n emacs 28.1 (same problem occurs with 29)\n pylsp v1.7.4\n ​\n ubuntu 22.04\n    submitted by    /u/chimprich  \n [link]   [comments]",

But modus is obvious masterpiece.\n This is emacs, so obviously I want to modify if something bother me.\n As a result, I finally started making a theme that felt fine to me. (I say fine because, I don't think it is complete or perfect)\n 📜 Info\n There is no science or principle behind this theme. Just some colors lying on your screen. If many of you do not like it, i might tweak and change some colors for community purpose. Or else, i might improve and add some goodies.\n Screenshots are here: https://github.com/idlip/haki/blob/haki/gallery.org\n As of now, I dont plan on making light theme, I'm not a light theme user. But if many want light variant, I might take it up in near future.\n ⭐ Features\n  \nUsually in themes, background of mark region, completion bar gets noticed. So i made haki-change-region, which changes region color in many places on the fly.\n There are variables like haki-*-font, which has respective use cases to look good in org, markdown, elfeed.\n Also for meow or evil users, you can use haki-modal-mode-line which changes the mode-line border color accordingly to states.\n  \nToo long, Don't wanna read;\n  \nhttps://github.com/idlip/haki.\n It is available in melpa!\n Screenshots => https://github.com/idlip/haki/blob/haki/gallery.org\n  \nAs a side note, I manage my whole system (nixos) and emacs in literate org-mode and it has been great.

This allows you to visit issues of any repo in an ad-hoc fashion and with an intuitive UI, eliminating the need to opening GitHub in a browser. \n As mentioned in the last post, this can improve your GitHub workflow and now with forge integration will even make it more efficient and intuitive than before. Especially for repositories that you don't actively want to contribute to (so o cloning, no contribution, ...), this can simplify your magit/forge workflow. \n Here is a screenshot:\n https://i.redd.it/5j4u7093gm9b1.gif\n ​\n    submitted by    /u/armindarvish  \n [link]   [comments]",

I hope so:\n This week, I ran a poll on my Mastodon to see who uses Vanilla Keybindings vs Modal. As a Meow user since a year, I was curious. Given the results (hugely in favor of Vanilla), I decided to go back to trying Vanilla. And I'm really loving it. I feel like I'm actually faster in a way. It's hard to describe, but I prefer it over modal. Then again, I'm not a coder so I think maybe the reason that coders like modal is maybe it fits their typing/editing patterns better? I'm not sure.\n Anyway, as I said: I love Emacs and Vanilla keybindings. Except, as we all know, Emacs can be a bit of a relic.

Its primary features are:\n  \nThe names of process buffers can be customized on a per-command basis; for example, the buffer name for the command ls -la can be automatically set to *shell:ls*, *shell:ls -la*, or any other number of desired values.\n \nWhen a command completes, its output buffer can emulate special-mode; this is useful for quickly dismissing (with quit-window) or quickly re-running the command (with revert-buffer).\n \nWhen a command completes, the point can be moved to the beginning of the output buffer if the command wasn't interactive; this is useful for paging through the output of commands like grep --help.\n \n The project readme also contains some tips and tricks for a smoother experience. The goal of the package is essentially to make shell buffers display when and where you want them, depending on the kinds of commands you run, and for those buffers to behave more like native special emacs buffers like help-mode.\n    submitted by    /u/elizadev  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "So my post isn't meant to bash on Magit, but rather I am trying to understand what kind of issues people had with the git CLI that made them love Magit. \n I remember before entering the world of emacs, people would say the two packages that would change your life would be Magit and org-mode. I have been using emacs for a few months now and I can safely say that I never use org-mode and still use the git CLI as I find it faster. Really the package that I felt was unique and made me stick with emacs was Tramp. The ability to open a remote file in an instant, with no subscription fee (looking at you Jetbrains) and without it interfering with my workflow was amazing.\n Now I am a young adult (~26yr) and am still early in my career as a software engineer so maybe I am just ignorant, but really the only git commands I use are git diff, status, pull, push branch and merge. And honestly in my bubble of using git, Magit is not really that much different than just using the CLI. Heck in the terminal I can even create aliases and chain commands with && which is even faster.\n Are there git commands that I don't know about that feel horrible or are the projects and responsibilities I deal with still small enough that I do not see the downfalls of using the CLI for much larger projects?\n TLDR: What aspects of Magit make it a better experience for version control than just using git in the terminal?\n EDIT: I want to thank each and everyone that replied. It seems that the way I commit code (multiple files at a time) is super elementary and for better debugging and readability people actually commit specific LINES of code not even files, which Magit in unmatched for. I learned a lot of new tools in this post specifically ediff and git bisect which I had not heard off. I plan to take these lessons forward in my career. I apologize if was not able to reply to everyone but I do promise I read your message. Thanks again.\n    submitted by    /u/JoeKazama  \n [link]   [comments]",

I wanted to provide an update, as it has changed a bit. \n I am now using the top-right menu on Gnome to enable and disable dark mode. However, old GTK3 applications do not \"see\" this setting at all.\n To solve this problem I am using:\n  \nPython script that monitors dbus and changes the GTK theme when selecting dark\n Systemd unit to ensure the script is running all time\n Emacs snippet to react to this change\n  \nWith this setup, having Emacs complied with pure GTK, changing the dark mode on gnome triggers a theme change, while the script triggers a change on the frame decoration. It sounds hacky, but the transition is very smooth and seamless.\n Also, this new code, makes sure that only one theme is configured in Emacs, as having multiple themes selected might be problematic, if themes change different settings.\n (use-package dbus :init (defun theme-switcher (value) ;; 0 = No Preference ;; 1 = Prefers dark ;; 2 = Prefers light.

Biggest thing holding me off from switching are the Keybindings. Just Moving the cursor is already such a strech. I've installed Evil mode but you have to configure it with every other plugin and often end up with doubled behaviour and not everything working as expected. It's still very hacky and i'm not sute if i should be using it.\n My Question is if i should just commit to the default binding? I've heard that they are subjectively bad and cause pinky strain and don't allow a fast workflow, and i can see that being the case. But maybe it just comes down to practice.\n Any of you had the same experience coming from Vim? Who uses the default bindings?

          "description": "Emacs experts, I need your help. I run Emacs in text mode in 16-colour terminal emulator. I recently upgraded from Emacs 27 (shipped with Debian 11) to 28 (shipped with Debian 12) and all the colours got horribly messed up. Here is an example from customize-face:\n https://i.imgur.com/KdaaC2J.png\n I speculate this happens because the default colours now assume 256-colour terminal, and indeed if I switch to 256 colours in the terminal emulator the settings look readable:\n https://i.imgur.com/dE2jUCv.png\n The question is how do I easily revert to earlier settings from Emacs 27? I could possible go through all the options and set font faces to desired values, but this will be an extremely tedious task given the amount of options, and I feel like there must be a simple solution for this.\n EDIT: It seems that the problem with colours only happens when running Emacs from inside Tmux, but not when running it directly from a terminal.\n    submitted by    /u/TechnoPapaj  \n [link]   [comments]",

The calendar shows the right day for today (if I want to select another date), so it knows today's date. But the function goto-today / capture-today is wrong.\n My capture template for the dailies is the default one. And org-roam-dailies-goto-tomorrow also captures yesterday's date. Where shall I place the edebug() command to get more feedback from emacs regarding these functions?\n I am using emacs 28.2 on Windows, with org-roam v2.2.2-42\n Any idea?

Uses would include (for me):\n 1) Sorting through lots of files and directories and marking them with colors to say if they're processed, or still processing.\n 2) Coloring files differently that belong to different categories but you need to keep them in the same folder.\n 3) You have a folder with lots of pictures from different decades/eras and you want to visually mark them off.\n Etc...\n Plus it kinda looks pretty.\n Karthink says he wants to give it to me and I'll be the maintainer but, as I really have zero experience doing that, I may hold off on that for now. I am learning elisp right now but it's slow-going. I'm doing my best tho. It's just got nothing to do with my job so it's sometimes hard to find the time for a few hours to get through more lessons.

In Doom, it's provided by a package called vertico. Then other packages provide fuzzy matching in vertico.\n To get out from M-x I had to press Escape 3 times.

I would like to see improvements in usability. It needs built-in quality-of-life improvements to be more accessible to people.

Eventually realized that I can just copy the text from pdf into emacs and then format it using emacs macros. Then next task was to convert the transaction lines into ledger entries. This gave birth to `ob-ledger-convert` or `ob-lc` to provide `lc` src blocks in the org mode which when executed convert the given transactions into ledger format. It does need parsers and I have provided some of the parsers used by me in the `ob-lc` module. New parsers can be added easily.\n This post is to share the enthusiasm of the emacs being such a fascinating machine which lets you do anything you want and also to get the feedback from the community on the package.\n The sample org file provided in the repo provides a gist of how to use the module.\n ob-ledger-convert: jayrajput/ob-ledger-convert: Convert anything to ledger in emacs org babel (github.com) \n ​\n    submitted by    /u/redmango2022  \n [link]   [comments]",

Clients for Office365 are particularly annoying with the new Oauth2 system; an app has to be trusted by Microsoft which pretty much means that all open source clients are unusable unless one has admin control over the Azure environment.\n After some pointless struggle, I decided to just rely on my local MacOS calendar app to handle all the authentication and to sync my calendars.

Even setting the background color to #ffffff results in a gray background (and in me shouting frustrated at the monitor). I can get pure white with xemacs, but I'm mostly working on our development servers remotely over slow ssh connections, so xemacs is out of the equation. \n Of the standard themes, whiteboard comes closest, but is also gray background, smudged and hard to read on e-ink. Literally every light theme I've downloaded has been some variant of smudgy yellow, gray or teal for the background. Grayish text on grayish background is virtually illegible on e-ink. \n I found an \"e-ink\" theme here: https://emacsthemes.com/themes/eink-theme.html. This gets me black text on a white background... mixed with white text on a white background (#includes and other syntax highlighting), so also not useable. \n Can it really be that difficult to get real black text on real white background? What is the obvious thing I'm missing? I'm happy to have some syntax highlighting in (dark) gray, but the main text needs to be pure black, and most importantly the background should be actual white. \n Please help, my inability to get something so trivial to work is hurting my self-esteem!\n    submitted by    /u/jimmyriba  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hey! I'm a new Emacs user who's been using Doom Emacs but I recently decided to switch over to a personal config. One things that I want to do asap is set up a lot of my keybinds to mostly mirror the ones set by Doom. That being said, there are a lot of binds to copy over and I don't want to do all of the hard manual labor of setting them all. More specifically, I want to copy over a lot of the useful leader key functionality that Doom sets. For instance, if I were to hit <leader> W in Doom, it would function about the same as if I hit <C-w> in evil mode. As of right now, I'm using the general package to set my binds for the leader key manually but it's kind of a pain in the ass, especially for such a massive set of commands like the <C-w> or <C-h> functionality. Is there a way to either \n A.) More easily port over most of the keybinds from Doom? (I know a lot of them are package specific but still)\n B.) Easily set certain default Emacs keybinds to other key combinations? (E.g set <Leader> W to be equivalent to <C-w> and <Leader> H to be equivalent to <C-h>\n    submitted by    /u/Doozku  \n [link]   [comments]",

However, it is hard to know which alternative defaults will be better.\n Emacs devs need help from users to obtain real-world data about Emacs garbage collection. See the discussion in https://yhetil.org/emacs-devel/87v8j6t3i9.fsf@localhost/\n I wrote a small package https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/emacs-gc-stats.html that will collect garbage collection stats during Emacs sessions. Please, install it and later (after few weeks) submit the results to emacs-gc-stats@gnu.org\n Usage:\n Add\n (require 'emacs-gc-stats) (setq emacs-gc-stats-gc-defaults 'emacs-defaults) ; optional (emacs-gc-stats-mode +1) \n to your init file to enable the statistics acquiring.\n When you are ready to share the results, run M-x emacs-gc-stats-save-session and then share the saved emacs-gc-stats-file (defaults to ~/.emacs.d/emacs-gc-stats.eld) by sending an email attachment to <mailto:emacs-gc-stats@gnu.org>.\n You can use M-x emacs-gc-stats-clear to clear the currently collected session data.\n The following data is being collected after every command:\n  \n GC settings gc-cons-threshold and gc-cons-percentage\n  Emacs version and whether Emacs framework (Doom, Prelude, etc) is used\n  Whether gcmh-mode is used\n  Idle time and Emacs uptime\n  Available OS memory (see memory-info)\n  Emacs memory allocation/GC stats\n  Current command\n  \n   submitted by    /u/yantar92  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have very high requirements for the software that I use to access my Zettelkasten because my work is very intense (after 6 hours of work I am often soaked in sweet). The software needs to get out of my way. The Archive is almost invisible to me now, almost like air.
