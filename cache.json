The idea was well received in the haskell subreddit and stirred some further discussions.

Implementing along the above manner would reduce duplicate code by a lot, and allows me to still make use of the type inference system.\n Yet when i run the code (\"let y = con (bot :: Dd F1 S1) (bot :: Dd F1 S1)\", with no compiler issues), examining y gives the following error : \"[...] Exception: [...] : No instance nor default method for class operation con\". \n Am i misunderstanding the Overlapping and Multiparameter type-classes wrongly?

All of them required many changes to the existing code, and in the end I couldn't get many things out of it. \n In the last week, I was touching Python for my job and its built-in mocking framework (unittest.mock). I was blown away. Nothing at all needs to change in the existing app code, yet I can mock and perform assertions on any function at all:\n # test that my function deletes the found file with mock.patch(\"glob.glob\") as glob: # mock a return value glob.return_value = [\"file.txt\"] with mock.patch(\"os.remove\") as remove: main_logic_to_delete_files() # perform asserts on no. times called and arguments remove.assert_called_once_with(path=\"file.txt\") \n It greatly lowered the barrier to perform unit tests for me, and I was amazed at how simply I could test the behaviour of my logic. \n Does anybody know of any library in Haskell that can do similar things, or any ideas on how I may go about making one if not?

Exactly how we use type aliases over existing types, except by the fact that they shouldn't be interchangeable.

Therefore, I would appreciate any suggestions!\n Here are the materials we have so far in the announcement :\n  \nWe suggest you start by watching this video: \n http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqi0Xu2Enaw \n Then have a look at these posts and discussions: \n https://serokell.io/blog/10-reasons-to-use-haskell \n http://stackoverflow.com/questions/775726/whats-the-fuss-about \n http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3175656/why-should-i-want-to-learn-haskell \n If you want to know more about the basic motivation behind Haskell and functional programming in general, listen to what the founding fathers of Haskell have to say: \n http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSmkqocn0oQ\n  \nVideo in the first link is great content-wise, but it feels and looks really old, so I don't think it leaves great impression on young students.\n Serokell blog post is great, I think, new and concise, I am happy with that one.\n Stack overflow discussions are motivating and inspiring, but both are almost 10 years old.\n Last video is nice, but also dated.\n Ideally, finding a replacement video for the first one, but newer, would be great, and possibly some newer discussions / blog posts!\n    submitted by    /u/Martinsos  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I spent some time this weekend writing up an alpha version of some ideas I had about command line option parsing as a haskell package: cyclops.\n To start, if you're looking for a robust and full-featured option parser, cyclops isn't that yet. Let me recommend optparse-applicative and optparse-generic, which are both great.\n The Big Idea of cyclops is to support a declarative option-parsing style (just say what arguments you expect, rather than how to parse it) while keeping the option description as close as possible to the variable bind location.\n To that end, it uses ViewPatterns and TypeApplications with DataKinds to pass option specifications backwards from the bind location using type inference.\n main = do ( switch @'[\"d\", \"debug\"] @\"Show debugging statements\" -> debug ,flagged @'[\"dictionary\"] @\"PATH\" @\"File to draw words from\" .defaultTo @\"--dictionary /usr/share/dict/words\" -> dictionaryPath ,option @'[\"s\", \"seed\"] @\"NUM\" @\"Seed value for PRNG\" .readable -> seed ,arg @\"count\" @\"Number of passwords to generate\" .readable -> count ,arg @\"template\" @\"Template for generated passwords\" .oneOrMore .defaultTo @\"w w w w\" -> template ) <- getOps Conf { description = \"Generate pseudorandom passwords using a template.\" , version = \"1.0.0.20220702\" } \n Type inference places some constraints not visible in the above example code - if seed is inferred to be an Int by how it's used in the rest of the code, then that's how it getOps will attempt to parse --option 123.\n This release isn't really ready for primetime yet, but if you like the basic concept, let me know, and I'll keep working it.\n    submitted by    /u/rampion  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hey everyone, after intensive testing i just released my first library on hackage!\n Interval Tree Clocks - They serve as an alternative to vector clocks, which are a concept to track logical time. In distributed contexts, comparison by timestamps might be skewed. \n Vector clocks and version vectors however have the weakness of \"actor explosion\" because you cannot remove traces of an actor that might be long gone. They only allow you to increment the version vector in length.\n Interval tree clocks solve this by managing a tree-representation of said vector clock. With interval tree clocks you can dynamically add (fork) or remove (join) actors / replicas from your system and have your versions grow and shrink accordingly, while still holding the monotonically increasing semantics.\n They can similarly be used as either version vectors or vector clocks.\n I have thoroughly tested the code. Nonetheless if you are an expert on the topic, I'd love to get your criticism. Nevertheless, because it's my first library, I appreciate all and any feedback I can get.\n Hope this helps you build distributed systems some day!\n ​\n Hackage link: https://hackage.haskell.org/package/interval-tree-clock-0.1.0.0\n ​\n This library provides the bare operations as described in the original paper: Almeida, Paulo & Baquero, Carlos & Fonte, Victor.

          "description": "So, I have a few modules for my value objects such as Username and Email, and usually their modules look like this:\n ``` module Auth.Username where newtype Username = Username String\n data UsernameParseError = UsernameTooShort | UsernameTooLong\n parseUsername :: (MonadError UsernameParseError m) => String -> m Username parseUsername u = undefined -- logic here ```\n The problem I am facing is that I need to parse a record\n  data SignUpRequest = SignUpRequest { username :: String , email :: String } \n to this:\n  data Parsed = Parsed { username :: Username , email :: Email } \n and in the function that does the parsing, I don't know what to put for the error type:\n  signUp :: (MonadError ??? m) => SignUpRequest -> m Parsed \n because there are two possible errors here: UsernameParseError and EmailParseError.\n What I'm looking for, is to do something like this:\n  data SignUpError = ParseError (UsernameParseError | EmailParseError) | SomeOtherError ??? \n but of course, that's not possible.\n The only solution I can see is by wrapping the types one by one:\n  data SignUpError = UsernameParseError' UsernameParseError | EmailParseError' EmailParseError | SomeOtherError ??? \n but that's obviously ridiculous, especially if I have way more fields.\n So, what's the best way of doing what I'm trying to do?\n I am aware I could just create a datatype ParseError:\n  newtype ParseError = ParseError { reason :: String } \n and make everything just return ParseError.\n And, since most of the times I'll just be sending the response as JSON to the client anyways, it doesn't matter that it is a string.\n However, sometimes, it is valuable to know what exactly is the error so I could act on it (recovery, etc.).\n So, what's the best way of doing what I'm trying to do?\n \n I know of Scala's shapeless library, which use coproducts to solve this problem. I'm new to the Haskell world so I'm not sure if there is an equivalent.\n Thanks\n    submitted by    /u/peanutbutterwnutella  \n [link]   [comments]",

And I'm guessing this is also the same effect?\n flip' :: (a -> b -> c) -> b -> a -> c flip' f = \\x -> \\y -> f y x \n Then he says\n  \nThe most common use case with flip is calling it with just the function parameter and then passing the resulting function on to a map or a filter. So use lambdas in this way when you want to make it explicit that your function is mainly meant to be partially applied and passed on to a function as a parameter.\n  \nWith the f = \\x y -> f y x the x is bound and the y is free? But how does bound and free come into play here? Can I have an example of what he's saying in the above quote?\n    submitted by    /u/teilchen010  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello everyone. I have a question about proper usage of Ref:\n Where other languages mutate objects, FP-languages prefer creating alternative instances to preserve referential transparency. Let's say I have a nested structure, i.e. House has Floors, Floor has Apartment, Apartment has Room, Room has LightBulb. If I change a light bulb, I obviously don't want to recreate the whole House.\n The way documentation describes Ref, its' primary goal is to help with concurrency:\n  \nAn asynchronous, concurrent mutable reference. Provides safe concurrent access and modification of its content\n  \nBut from my experience, it's really handy to use it just as a reference, even if there are no troubles with concurrency. In the example with House I can store references to Apartments to avoid recreating Floors and the whole House each time i have a change in an Apartment. I can just call apartmentRef.update(...) and the Floor and the House stay exactly the same.\n The question is: is it OK to do so? If so, is it bad to use it every time, let's say at each level mentioned in the House example?\n    submitted by    /u/anonimuzzza  \n [link]   [comments]",

For example, if someone has no experience in programming and wants to start learning by writing working code quickly, I'd recommend Python for its readability and (apparent) simplicity.\n I've recently started learning Scala out of an interest in functional programming and how it is accomplished in languages running on the JVM. There are some aspects I really like, like the use of Option instead of Null, the fact that the syntax is familiar but 'cleaned-up' and less verbose compared to Java, performance …",

What tools did you consider to help with the “snapshotting” (serialization and deserialization)? Where did you persist your snapshots?\n Some considerations: 1. There are about a hundred different case classes available through various functions in the DataAccess class 2. The “amount” of data is large. So while I view storage cost as essentially free, serialization / deserialization performance (primarily deserialization) is a concern\n A few options I could think of are: 1.

I'm starting to question the \"good practices\" setup by the previous developers but I'm struggling to find good references as to what really are considered good practices in scala and what are definitely crucial errors often made by new developers learning the trade. I was wondering if you had any resources you find/found yourself returning to? \n FYI I am currently working on a REST API (which is not very RESTful in my opinion but that's another debate) with Scala 2 + Play + Slick (and some Akka actors for cron jobs but I don't really understand why). No documentation, no tests of any kind. I feel that files are all over the place (there is not a really defined logical architecture). Logs didn't even had a date & time before I added it to the logger (I had never even thought about not having date & time on logs before but I guess people can work without it). Sometimes controllers directly communicate with DAOs without services, and DAOs communicate between themselves, I thought it was frowned upon but I've been told otherwise by the previous devs... \n Anyway! \n TLDR : what's your go-to documentation?\n    submitted by    /u/DespicableHarpoon  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have been working as a contractor for the last 2 years and worked with 3 different clients. One thing is common for all of them, and that is a very poor quality codebase, without any documentation, some tests, a fundamental misunderstanding of how libraries like ZIO or Cats-Effect should be used, a tendency to overcomplicate literally everything, using GraphQL without reasonable explanation, using Slick with Cats-Effect, instead of a doobie, etc.\n After some time, I realized that I am very frustrated with my career, even If Scala was everything I ever wanted to do, I've invested a lot of time and money to be in this position I am now. I have a very high daily rate, and in spite of that, I am very unhappy with all the Scala projects I was working on.\n I started to doubt myself lately, because, before this Scala contract role, I was very happy at my work, with smart colleagues open for discussion, a very simple and clean codebase, and no overengineering, but it was an outsourcing company and it was getting really hard to get raise. Now I literally earn 8-9 times more than just 2-3 years ago but have a feeling that I always find shitty company.

The Org+git workflow is understandably a big ask and I've experienced the pain a few times already. I'd like to use Org in Emacs on my own machines but have other team members access the data through a lower entry-barier interface such as the web.\n Tools like LogSeq seems to want to head there but still have a large focus on having to obtain their client first. Many teams are familiar with the \"login through SSO and make changes\" kind of workflow, so I'm keen to learn what's in this space and how you all solve this problem -- in case this is even a problem for y'all. Is this even a reasonable ask or shall I just stuck it up and suffer through Notion and Confluence/Jira?\n PS: I'm often fill of rage when I use those tools but as I find them inhibiting (breaking my flow) but maybe I just need a (better) therapist. 🤷🏿‍♂️\n    submitted by    /u/vidbina  \n [link]   [comments]",

This works very well.\n The only issue I have is that the agenda is rebuild after each (bulk) refile, which takes a while (10~15 seconds every time). It does take long but not forever, but it is already annoying although I am rather new to org and my files are not that large.\n Is there an option/command/prefix/hack I am missing that allows me to prevent the rebuild of the agenda every time?\n As plan B, is there another/better way to refile several entries at the same time that does not involve agendas?\n ---\n I noticed that the agenda is not re-build when I archive a heading (using a in the agenda view). I guess this is because the command predictably removes the heading from the agenda.

          "description": "I've been using org-wild-notifier (within Spacemacs) for a while and I realized it was actually draining my laptop batter quite a bit. The core reason is that once a minute it spawns a separate emacs instance that has to initialize a bunch of things and actually (re)open all org agenda files I already had opened and regenerate org-agenda.\n Which led me to dig around and look at https://github.com/jwiegley/emacs-async (which wild-notifier uses) and then read a bit about https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/NoThreading.\n I also went through https://orgmode.org/worg/agenda-optimization.html a bit (I only have a few agenda files and they are not huge, though I am toying with the idea of testing cleanup to see how much it would help)\n Ultimately though, it feel like the emacs-async use in this case will always cause slowdowns. Doing some profiling - even the call to package-initialize in org-wild-notifier--retrieve-events takes a sizeable chunk of CPU.\n These seem like wasted cycles, my emacs instance already has the org files open and all the packages needed loaded.\n So, finally my question is - am I the only one that is bothered by this? Do people not want/need notifications generally? Or not get hit by the battery drain for some reason? How do others deal with getting notifications before events/tasks are scheduled/planned?\n I looked a bit at https://github.com/legalnonsense/org-timed-alerts and I like the approach using org-ql potentially nice(r). Especially with caching and all of that... But the package doesn't seem maintained anymore so I think it's a dead end?\n Alternatively would changing wild-notifier to use emacs threads potentially solve/improve this? (at the cost of newer emacs version requirement).\n Any other suggestions (other than trying to cleanup my org agenda files)?\n Edit: Fix double spaced-paragraphs\n    submitted by    /u/podtatranec  \n [link]   [comments]",

When I put the same heading into inbox.org (or any other file I added for testing) it does not.\n I also tried to copy personal-cal.org and put the TODO item in the copy, still it does not appear. So it does not seem to be something inside the files that make them special, it is rather that I somehow set up emacs to only look inside those two files for TODO items.\n But how?

          "description": "Although, as previously remarked, org does not natively provide a means to handle events. Events do not possess a task quantifier by nature, thus without the ability to monitor the todo status of the item, org is unable to track it. \n There are ways to work around this limitation. You can create an event quantifier for your events. Better yet, create one for events in the future, and another for events that have already occurred. Unfortunately, this solution would require the user to manually change the state of the event quantifier for the item, or write a script to do this automatically. Regardless, such a solution would not organize events separately from other task items, and would not distinguish them as being a different type of \"thing\". \n Another solution, would be to use items that…",

I also use GNU Stow for individual packages so everything is sym-linked from a master .dotfiles dir.\n For those that do this or something similar, I'm wondering, do you keep the org files in a git repo, or just the dotfiles? If both in a repo, do you keep them together?\n Also, because I have some per system configs where how the dotfiles will be tangled will depend on some evaluated code in my org files. I can't wrap my head around how that won't create problems for version control since the code will change depending on the machine. I guess the dotfiles can be in different git branches, but if the evaluated results in the org files themselves will be changing depending on the system, won't that pose a problem for version control as well?\n Hope this makes sense!

It's solved all my frustrations and brick walls I had with pretty much every other note taking, agenda type application I've ever used over like the last 10 years (Evernote, Joplin, OneNote (that lasted like 3 days), Text files, dokuwiki, mediawiki, todist, etc)\n ​\n One last struggle I'm kind of trying to wrap my head around is organizing notes when one has too many life contexts. For example, I've got a full time job, a part time job (which really just connects to my full time job... long story), an addiction to businesses, investments, books I'm reading, a home, a truck, a car... you get the idea)... \n So, being crazy busy, crazy spread thin half the time and needing to keeps notes has always been a challenge.\n I'm just curious if someone could share their methods of organizing their org mode files. I've kind of ended up with a bunch of files (atleast I was smart enough to leave them all in one place). I'm also taking to using agenda as well, which adds some challenges as well I would think, but I'm not sure.\n ​\n I guess maybe I don't fully understand org organization just yet. Maybe someone can offer some insight?\n I should note I also use Plain Org on iPhone, mainly because it's the only one I found that I could sync with anything other than dropbox/google drive/ webdav. I prefer self-hosted so that was my choice and I sync with Syncthing.\n As always appreciate the community\n    submitted by    /u/Neat_Objective  \n [link]   [comments]",

But then if I try to type the username and IP of the remote machine, every single character I type causes Tramp to ask me for the local machine password again. I have to hit ESC to show the original Tramp prompt again. Typing another character asks for the password again. You get the idea.\n Has anyone else had this?

It works for me because it's keyboard based, and on all my devices.\n I see the weekly tip thread in this sub, but most of them are way more advanced than the level I'm at.\n Had anyone got any noob friendly tips about general emacs capabilities to explore?\n My current workflow / level is:\n  \nOpen org files from bookmark (dired)\n Edit and save org file\n if there are conflicts (damn you syncthing), resolve with ediff\n if anything goes \"weird\" kill buffer / delete window until back to the fallback buffer - then try again.\n  \nI had some luck early on with tasker and bash scripts to manipulate org files based on various conditions - but I've long forgotten how all that works.\n Similarly, I tried to get notmuch mail setup two years ago, but ran into trouble with gmail and exchabge authentication \n Would love to hear your suggestions for my emacs journey.\n I've also asked if there are any org-specific things I can try on the org-mode sub\n    submitted by    /u/thephatmaster  \n [link]   [comments]",

I feel like I'm still not 100% getting it.\n In elisp there are two distinct namespaces: one for functions and one for variables. This means I can have a variable called foobar and also a function called foobar, and they won't interfere with one another.\n If I want to evaluate a variable, then I just write the variable - eg foobar. If I want to evaluate a function, then I include it within parentheses (with arguments as needed) - eg (foobar arg1 arg2).\n If I want to refer to the symbol of a variable, then I prepend it with a quote - eg 'foobar. If I want to refer to the symbol of function, then I prepend it with a hash and quote - eg #'foobar.\n Lambdas are something of a mish-mash: they allow me to set the value of a variable to be a function, that will itself be called each time that variable is evaluated.\n Is that about it? Would love any feedback around where my understanding may have gone awry.\n    submitted by    /u/Shimmy-choo  \n [link]   [comments]",

It meant that I didn't have to think about which file I want to skip forward or back to - I would just look at the buffer line and then prev or next or wildcard to the buffer I want to skip to.\n In Emacs you do end up with a lot more open buffers so something similar wouldn't quite work but I wonder whether there are other solutions that might solve my issue. \n I would be perfectly happy to mark the buffers that I am currently working on for example and have them displayed somewhere for ease. Or have them pop up at the top of my buffer or ibuffer list so they are easy to see and select.\n Any suggestions?\n    submitted by    /u/Two_Souls  \n [link]   [comments]",

Are the failed tests in levels above 'make check' telling me anything significant?\n --Editing to fix formatting and (hopefully) simplify my question--\n Here's the result of running make check-all after compiling with the --with-xwidgets option:\n SUMMARY OF TEST RESULTS ----------------------- Files examined: 375 Ran 5568 tests, 1 failed to run, 5456 results as expected, 13 unexpected, 99 skipped 1 files did not finish: misc/test-custom-noloads.log 7 files contained unexpected results: src/thread-tests.log lisp/progmodes/python-tests.log lisp/mail/rmailmm-tests.log lisp/emacs-lisp/cconv-tests.log lisp/cedet/srecode/fields-tests.log lisp/cedet/srecode/document-tests.log lisp/autorevert-tests.log make[2]: *** [Makefile:336: check-doit] Error 2 make[2]: Leaving directory '/home/src/emacs/emacs-28.1-tarball/emacs-28.1/test' make[1]: *** [Makefile:315: check-all] Error 2 make[1]: Leaving directory '/home/src/emacs/emacs-28.1-tarball/emacs-28.1/test' make: *** [Makefile:994: check-all] Error 2 \n All the tests that fail are performed only when I run make check-all.

          "description": "(Disclaimer: I don't use emacs; I just have ulnar nerve entrapment from programming and discovered emacs pinky.)\n For the past 7 weeks, my pinky and ring finger have been in a constant state of \"pins and needles.\" The onset was gradual but transitioned into being 24/7, though without pain at first. I thought it was from sleeping on my elbow - not an uncommon cause of ulnar nerve entrapment, and my doctor had me change sleeping positions. \n I'm developing apps full time in dart and spend about 8-12 hours a day programming, 6-7 days a week. And I save, copy, paste, undo, redo, among other shortcuts all day, probably having my pinky hit the left ctrl key 1000 times a day. My typing speed was normally over 160, max 183, on 10fastfingers. \n Look, I've rebinded left control entirely to left alt. But for some reason, it really hit me today. Suddenly, I was in so much pain that I couldn't bear to hit left ctrl. \n I'm asking here because I'm hoping someone else has gone through recovery. I can't see a specialist for a couple of months. I'll discontinue using my small finger for shortcuts entirely, but that doesn't help me. I have a job to do now.\n    submitted by    /u/AMPHETAMINE-25  \n [link]   [comments]",

I've tried setting line-prefix to a tab, but even with tab-width 2, that's a bit too much.\n Alternatively, I'm happy with any other way to add a space between the display-line-numbers section and my code.\n    submitted by    /u/your_sweetpea  \n [link]   [comments]",

But ESS, at least by default, uses X, which is not nice:\n - plotting happens in the XQuartz application, which means that I need to switch out of Emacs and requires a whole bunch of keypresses and thought that I don't want to deal with; at most a window (or multiple as appropriate) should open which I close it with cmd-w and return to emacs, without having to switch applications.\n - plots aren't interactive. In python, for example, you can adjust the plot and save it from the figure window (although the plot window also switches apps and for that reason is not ideal).\n Is this the standard R plotting workflow on macOS (or for that matter Linux)? How do people handle making a lot of plots, on the fly, using ESS? Any other related workflow tips are also helpful. Thanks.\n    submitted by    /u/progthw  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have treemacs spawned on the left window, then everything else belong to that directory can be launched on the right window, i.e. you press Enter on treemacs and it opens on the right. \n This works but whenever I need to open up another file in a different directory, treemacs automatically change its path. \n Eg. say I have treemacs open ~/myproject folder: I achieve this by open a file in ~/myproject and then launch treemacs. Now, if I open a different file in a different directory like ~/Desktop and my cursor is on that file, treemacs will then show whatever I have in ~/Desktop. Of course, if I focus my cursor on the file in ~/myproject, treemacs will show my project stuff again. \n This flickering is quite distracting with big project, and sometimes you just want to open a random unrelated file. \n Is there a different tree app or a settings in treemacs that does this?\n Please let me know.\n    submitted by    /u/maxle0312  \n [link]   [comments]",

E.g. code (lispy and friends, many programming modes, tree-sitter structural editing), collapsable sections (e.g. magit), nested outlines (org), heading outlines (outshine), etc. Here, the different modes all seem to define different navigation commands and bindings.\n It would be wonderful if there were a set of \"standard\" bindings for tree-movement: \n  \namong siblings at the same level (j,k in lispy; b, f with org-speed commands)\n up a level forward/backward (h,l in lispy; u with org-speed)\n to the next/previous thing in the tree regardless of level (f from either \"side\" of an sexp in lispy, p, n with org speed commands).\n \n Probably too late to find any common set of keys that would work across existing modes, but it would still be nice to have a consistent set going forward.

First, I'm trying to setup my home emacs configuration based (loosely) on my work configuration, but doing it entirely through use-package instead of the Emacs package management. As a result, I'm not entirely sure dependencies are being installed though I understand they ought to be. In any event I've got a behavior on my work machine that I have not yet been able to get on my home machine, namely when I start typing a path in a string, I get completion on it based on the filesystem. Here's a picture, hopefully. \n In any event, I have company and company-statistics installed in both locations but I don't think that's what's doing the file completion suggestions. Any ideas what is causing that? \n Second question, there is a package that has a built-in version installed, however the gnu repository has a more recent version. If I use use-package to install, it says the package is already installed. Is there a way to force it to update if there's a newer version, or something along those lines? I am new to use-package and really haven't gotten the full swing of it yet. I also have a newer version that I just had to download from a site and in the past have just used adding a directory onto load-path and then (require '<package name>) which works, but would be interesting to sort out whether that behavior can be done with use-package as well as a shortcut.\n Anyhow, any help greatly appreciated!\n    submitted by    /u/remillard  \n [link]   [comments]",

So far, I'm really happy with it, however, I couldn't find any information of filtering/ignoring some directories/files in search results.\n I have some projects containing folders (e.g. \"vendor\") with so many files that search results become unusable but I might not want to ignore those folder at the VCS level, so I would like to ignore those folders/files in Vertico via Emacs config (And not using .projectile or .gitignore files.\n Looking at the source of Doom Emacs, vertico-file-search, I don't see any option to do so. I couldn't find anything in Vertico documentation either.\n /u/sarit-hadad-enjoyer mentioned adding it to projectile-globally-ignored-directories seems to also apply in Vertico for him but unfortunately that doesn't seems to be working in my case.\n I would appreciate any information or help to help me solve this issue,\n    submitted by    /u/m-gregoire  \n [link]   [comments]",

It's almost perfect for me with bash(1) scripts - the only sand in the vaseline is that next-error skips over shellcheck(1) 'notes' and only points me at 'warnings' and worse. For example, in this output from shellcheck(1):\n foobar:5:18: note: Double quote to prevent globbing and word splitting. [SC2086] foobar:20:28: warning: ShellCheck can't follow non-constant source. Use a directive to specify location. [SC1090] \n I would like next-error to visit occurrences of 'note's as well as more serious blues. Do I need to futz with next-error-function? If so, does anyone have the code for that? \n Or perhaps there's some way to have shellcheck(1) promote 'notes' to 'warnings'?\n Here's my miserable code:\n (defun bh:check-syntax () \"Check syntax for various languages.\" (interactive) (when (eq major-mode 'lisp-mode) (progn (emacs-lisp-byte-compile))) (when (eq major-mode 'sh-mode) (compile (format \"bash -n %s && shellcheck -f gcc %s\" buffer-file-name buffer-file-name) t)) (when (eq major-mode 'ruby-mode) (shell-command (format \"ruby -c %s\" buffer-file-name))) (when (eq major-mode 'python-mode) (shell-command (format \"python -B -m py_compile %s\" buffer-file-name))) (when (eq major-mode 'awk-mode) (shell-command (format \"gawk --source 'BEGIN { exit(0) } END { exit(0) }' --file %s\" buffer-file-name)))) (add-hook 'after-save-hook #'bh:check-syntax) \n * the sub-discussion was about disabling flycheck as it's just too distracting - I prefer to do linting on save, and so do others, apparently.\n    submitted by    /u/StrangeAstronomer  \n [link]   [comments]",

And I am curious whether transformation in place in text buffer is often done or usually transformation into another buffer. \n So many bread and butter programming tasks involve transformation of text to some other text.

I attached two screenshots below to help understand what I am talking about.\n ​\n Anyways, I'm super new to emacs and don't really know how I would go about doing this in emacs. Any tips? \n ​\n I'd like to be able to have the priority features in the addon, i.e. 1-100 priority scheduling, show in [n] days, show on weekdays, set a directory for files and see all files that aren't currently in the queue, but I realize this may be pretty hard so I'd settle for just being able to add and remove links to a queue with some basic priority. \n ​\n ​\n https://preview.redd.it/ohcc2glffp791.png?width=323&format=png&auto=webp&s=40c2c2777d525df480f7be333dc0932beafe8191\n ​\n ​\n https://preview.redd.it/290wxbx5fp791.png?width=1226&format=png&auto=webp&s=ce3f5b5b03207fe159e6f2e8a94b85f0a4fa15e0\n    submitted by    /u/nick91700  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I'm gonna start by saying that i respect emacs contributors/developers choice to keep emacs minimal, they maintain it, while not bloating it by just copy and pasting elisp code from plethora other external packages, leaving end users free to choose if they want any packages to add. Emacs already offers a lot of development tools, that i think work really well together, like (warning, long list ahead):\n version control (magit), web browser (eww), email client, text editing, terminal, plugin (package) manager, documentation, calculator, remote file system access (tramp), org more, and most importantly, powerful configuration system (elisp), and definitely more.\n Compared to emacs, vscode (yes im comparing emacs to vscode, bite me) only has 40% percent of these features. But there is one thing that vscode does better than emacs, and that is code editing. Vscode, has built in lsp, with fast, consistent auto code completion with good completion results, fast documentation, with easy to install plugins here and there. Emacs auto code completion makes typing typing feel laggy, the completions results are a bit worse, programing in different languages feels not as consistent, and setting up all the stuff is more tedious.\n All i'm saying is that i think emacs users would benefit a lot, if we had these features built in into emacs, with good, out of a box, experience, as most of us are programmers. And it would probably take a lot of effort for emacs devs to implement something like this, but why not.\n Thanks for reading my [almost] rant, have a nice day :D\n    submitted by    /u/BlackberryPerfect938  \n [link]   [comments]",

I am not particularly good at either, but I was drawn to emacs after seeing people post about how great it is as both an IDE and a word processor.\n Over the last two weeks, I have scoured the internet trying to learn more about emacs. I configured spacemacs, and then switched to doom emacs. I have learned the basics of org mode and org-roam. And even though it's been a much steeper learning curve than I expected, I have really loved it so far.\n However, I am stuck on one particular issue that is maddening and crippling my ability to use emacs the way I want. And that issue is almost enough to make me want to give up.\n The problem is formatting. Eventually, I need to be able to output this to a word or a PDF doc in double spaced times new Roman font. And while I know that there are a myriad of ways to do that, I am struggling to find a way that works while making my words in emacs not completely unreadable.\n As it stands now, if I tab or add spaces to indent my paragraphs, emacs will behave more like a programming text editor and indent the whole block of text. It looks fine if I copy it into libre word, but makes for tough writing in emacs itself\n If I add a space to break up paragraphs in emacs (a new line character), then I am stuck with an undesired extra space when I put it in libre word, and I can't figure out an easy way to search and delete those extra lines in word itself.\n I am not very good at configuring emacs, but I am trying to learn. Unfortunately, this one issue has made me almost want to give up completely even though I definitely see the advantages this software could offer. I feel like I am fighting with the system more than actually producing creative work.\n If anyone has any good advice on how to solve this, I would appreciate it. I know the solution is there, but I have yet to find it in my searches of YouTube and Google.\n    submitted by    /u/eburkhead  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi All,\n Recently I discovered TRAMP mode, and I really love it. There's just one little annoyance: I run Emacs as a daemon and, while trying to open a file with emacsclient in a new frame, TRAMP gets in the way and stubbornly tries to resolve an ssh:// link.\n Is there a way to avoid this behavior or, if that happens, to instruct Emacs to point to the local filesystem instead?\n So far I've managed to use iBuffer and delete the entry corresponding to TRAMP, but I hope there's some better way to solve my problem.\n Any help is really appreciated. Thank you!\n    submitted by    /u/oh-void  \n [link]   [comments]",

From searching the eglot discussion forums, the usual issue is that the project library is misinstalled, but if that's the case here, it's beyond my ability to debug.\n In particular: - I did install eglot the standard way via M-x package-install. M-x package-list-packages does show project 0.8.1 installed (with status \"dependency\", I assume because it was pulled in as a dependency of eglot). - M-x find-library project takes me to the project.el file for version 0.8.1 (github link), which I think means the correct version of project is being loaded. - I'm not an expert, but it looks like this library does define the project-root symbol. - Following a suggestion here, I tried M-x list-load-path-shadows, and found two relevant lines, both of which seem to indicate the version I want is shadowing other versions:  /home/rif/.emacs.d/elpa/project-0.8.1/project hides /usr/share/google-emacs/site-lisp/emacs-google-config/third_party/elisp/project/project /home/rif/.emacs.d/elpa/project-0.8.1/project hides /usr/share/google-emacs/27.2+gg3+1.20210329.053400.rc147/lisp/progmodes/project \n Any suggestions, diagnostics or lessons are welcome.\n    submitted by    /u/rifasaurous  \n [link]   [comments]",

For this reason I tried to cook down the package to a minimal subset - GNU Hypobole. Since Emacs is Elisp and Elisp is Emacs it also makes sense to hack it yourself.

In that discussion, some prefer eglot because it feels more unobtrusive and faithful to Emacs built-ins compared to lsp-mode—so eglot is a legitimate alternative to lsp-mode.\n Debugging is a different story. Really, the only viable debugging tools (that aren't for elisp) in Emacs are dap-mode and gud and its rewrite, realgud. Though the debugging adapter protocol (dap) can be reimplemented for eglot, it would take a lot of effort, so it likely won't manifest anytime soon. Consequently: if you want to use dap, then you have to use lsp-mode.\n But how is gud/realgud? It's almost never spoken of these days due to the popularity of lsp-mode/dap-mode. Of course, the tools are very different, but does anyone still think gud/realgud can be treated as a genuine alternative to dap-mode (barring preferences in UI)? Do they still have a place?\n    submitted by    /u/FluentFelicity  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Here are a few examples. \n Search and replace is a single command in vim. You type :s/text/TextToReplace and you are done. The same command also also accepts regex without the need to have seperate command for that.\n Emacs uses query search and replace which prompts 2 times for the main text and then the text to replace. And then if you want to use regex to replace, you have to use a different command. \n Command to kill buffer prompts for which buffer to kill, although almost always you want to kill the current one.\n :bd just kills the current buffer in vim. \n Many alt-x commands prompt too much asking for each argument, instead of just allowing all the arguments to be entered in one line. \n I know some of these can be customised and eliminated but this seems to be a general trend. I read that one of the vim design principles was to prompt user as little as possible allowing user to do much non interactively while emacs seems to encourage lot of spoon feeding to new/ begginer users.\n Not to mention, settting the option of shorter prompts (y or n instead of yes and no), disabling some prompts made my emacs experience much better. Also disabling the splash screen, startup tutorial, and changing the scratch buffer message to something much shorter. All these changes had to be done to get a more elegant experience.\n    submitted by    /u/LowCom  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Years ago my personal note taking was no longer based on trial and error but on a solid concept called Bullet Journaling. It started on paper with a lovely Moleskin book and a black fine liner from Neuland. Going digital with my Bullet Journal I decided to use a brilliant tool for note taking named OneNote. But time went by. In March 2022 I got my first contact with Obsidian and at the same time with the Zettelkasten method from Niklas Luhmann explained in the brilliant book from Sönke Ahrens about “How to take Smart Notes”.\nMigration from OneNote to Obsidian was a migration from structured notes to networked notes. But how to migrate a Bullet Journal to a Zettelkasten? Difficult to switch from one concept to another? No, it’s very easy. The Bullet Journal is now a set of Structure Notes in my Zettelkasten. Also Zettelkasten is a Custom Collection in my Bullet Journal.\nIn other words:\nmy Zettelkasten is a Bullet Journal and\nmy Bullet Journal is a Zettelkasten.\nThe best of all: I did not need to change the basic concepts from Ryder Carroll (Bullet Journal), neither the concepts from Niklas Luhmann (Zettelkasten). Both concepts support each other in a perfect manner.\nWhat about your experiences with theses methods? Do you use the Dataview plugin to support your Bullet Journal collections?\n—\n\n\nAhrens, Sönke.

          "description": "Hello.\nMy name is Mike Kramer. Two years ago, I made a very low-effort comment on this forum, but I never introduced myself.\nI first heard of the Zettelkasten Method by reading Ahrens's book. Through it, I discovered Christian and Sascha. From studying them, I realized that, just as the hardest part of GTD is processing--deciding which outcomes are worth committing to and which actions will cause those desired outcomes--the hardest part of a high-value Zettelkasten Method is specifying the nature of the connection that links one Zettel to another. GTD deals only with causal connections between items. The Zettelkasten Method can handle both causal and logical connections.\nAt the most fundamental level, my approach is based on the zettelkasten.de critique that says that a Folgezettel is a variant of the Collector's Fallacy. When I observe the work of other people, they usually cannot specify how a new note relates to its predecessor in the Folgezettel. They have the feeling that they have accomplished something meaningful, but, if they cannot write down the nature of the relation that obtains between connected notes, their thinking is inadequate.\nTo improve my own thinking, I track the status of the connections between my notes. Lumping a bunch of notes together is a low-effort, low-value kind of link compared to a link that shows how some notes provide reasons that support (or undermine) another note.\nIn March of this year, I produced a YouTube video of how I implement my method in Roam. Of course, this method could be implemented with other tools.\nhttps://youtu.be/iOsOI09-3A8\nI welcome your feedback. I hope to be spending a bit of time in wilderness areas, so it might take me a week or so to respond.",

This is my main concern that I want to address in this post.\nRequirement to produce plain text from small snippets of thoughts and bullet points. I know that this is probably the actual issue, where everyone has their own personal limits...\nI personally am using vimwiki. I often have already structured text inside my wiki, so I am not following a dedicated ZK method, where I would provide very small pieces of information, as I have read it in your introduction. \nI am currently working in an environment where the documents for external partners need to be written and shared in MS Office and the internal documents with LibreOffice. I personally often share textfiles internally, but there are some that don't like this, and latest when we have a kind of official internal meeting, I \"quickly\" convert my initial text into Office document.\nHow do you effectively export things from your knowledge base into documents that you want to publish eventually having the following points in mind:\nEfficient working: Information that is gained during writing the document to be published might also be needed to be transferred into you your knowledge base - duplicated information\nMarkdown syntax is not powerful enough to e.g. handle tables, so there is cumbersom reformating when moving data. Vimwiki syntax is not supported externally. AsciiDoc is a kind of strange to me. Multimarkdown was not fully supported by all my tools.\nLaying out a document in MS Word or LibreOffice is for me a very time consuming process, when I copy plain text into it.\nI tried several conversion methods like for example\n\n\nexported html from vimwiki into word\nseveral tries with pandoc (e.g. to LibreOffice)\n\n\n\nThank you",

          "description": "Hi everyone! I'm Joe, a recently graduated master's student working on international security and defense issues. I ran into the zettelkasten system while deep diving for ways to deepen my research, organize my usually jumbled thoughts, and connect my ideas. The zettel process is helpful because most of my work turns into written productsI often readng academic journals and think pieces on military concepts and other international policies.\nI just restarted my zettel journey after reading Ahrens' \"Smart Notes\" and powering through a few Youtube videos. My current focus is figuring out a \"good\" way to process literature notes. My initial way of creating literature notes would be a two-step process: taking general notes while reading and then finalizing a summary for the \"final literature note\" to connect with my fleeting notes to create permanent notes.\nI'm still a zettel newbie, so how do you process your literature notes? Any recommended readings about the topic? I look forward to engaging with everyone and learning more about the zettelkasten system!",

Sometimes I am in a mood that I am just not convenient to sit at my PC to write notes. So sitting into the couch, having a tea and just write some thoughts is the only way, I can motivate my self to writing.\nI want to have my notes searchable. So the only thing I see, is to retype things at a later point of time.\nBenefits: repetition and filtering\nAny ideas/suggestions about this?\nRegards, sbts",

I first heard of Zettelkasten after a few coworkers of mine were talking about personal knowledge systems. I read everything under \"Getting Started\" on this site plus others, and even bought (and read) the book about taking smart notes.\nI started blogging over a decade ago and already see the massive assistance my Zettelkasten provides even with only a few zettels (about 70 fully formed zettels currently). Not only does it help with my blog but it's help with creating content both for public social networks as well as my online store.\nNeedless to say, I'm a convert and taking my time building up a Zettelkasten for my brain to work within. I'm currently using Obsidian for the software but am thinking about creating a software myself to fit my exact needs. But we'll see... creating software is a lot of work... 😅\nHappy Zettel'n!",

A fluke find from Atomic Habits to Deep Work to Smart Notes resulting in crash learning how to get started in Obsidian.\nMany years ago a science degree, now as a 60's something student, just finished a Bachelor of Visual Arts (Hons) I am moving on to a Ph.D (preparation mode at present). During Honours I held way too much information in my head, bounced from art journals for drawing, bullet journals, todo lists and adhoc method of note taking and Mendeley for references.\nAfter a couple of months preparatory reading I have multitudes of ideas but have frozen at the writing/note taking point, word docs and OneNote are resulting in dead notes that I know in a couple of years wont serve me well. Zettelkasten is how my head so I am hoping this will be a game changer.\nIf anyone else is in the process of working on their Ph.D thesis  I would love to know how you use your Zettelkasten, do you keep it purely for creative notes or use folders etc to track authors, titles etc to ensure you have covered your lit review requirements? Any tips, starting points for a new Obsidian user would be appreciated.",
