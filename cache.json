Functor f => (s -> a) -> (s -> a -> s) -> (a -> f a) -> s -> f s lens getterFunc setterFunc sa s = setterFunc s <$> sa (getterFunc s) \n where sa :: (a -> f a) and s :: s seem to appear out of nowhere on the left hand side.\n EDIT2: Now given the expanded type signature this is more apparent and this one is also now solved for me!\n  \nI now have a new issue:\n The type of most lens functions (getter, setter, traversal) tends to look like\n haskell type Getter/Setter s a = Functor/Applicative f => (a -> f a) -> (s -> f s)  which, in the case of getters apparently is equivalent to s -> a but not in the case of setters.\n In this case a getter can be a function that has a function of (a -> f a) and a parameter s and this should return an f s so I'm not sure how we get s -> a here.\n Can anyone help explain this to me?\n EDITS: Sorry for the edits, posted on reddit too and slowly working things out at the same time.\n    submitted by    /u/tobz619  \n [link]   [comments]",

Both Ogma and Copilot are open-source software written in Haskell.\n Applicants for this internship must be U.S. Citizens and meet a minimum 3.0 GPA requirement. Prior experience is not required. Knowledge of the following will be considered a plus: Haskell or other functional languages, C/C++, Bash, git, Docker, Linux, NASA Core Flight System, Robot Operating System, FPrime. Please note that the academic level listed in the opening is merely indicative and students at other levels (e.g., PhD) will also be considered.\n For further details, or if you have any questions, see intern.nasa.gov and the specific listing at https://stemgateway.nasa.gov/public/s/course-offering/a0B3d000001OkSrEAK/onsite-virtual-improving-testing-capabilities-for-cfsrosfprime.\n Even though the deadline for applications is Aug 31, it will remain open for a few more days.\n I will be at ICFP during Mon 4 Sep - Sat 9 Sep.

The constraints that my rebalancer enforces define a set of properties that are easy to test, but they are not sufficient to guarantee optimality.

PrintTest constructor of TestOutput now has an extra field used to report progress. Supply const (pure ()) as this extra field value if you want to skip progress reporting (#311).\n foldGroup now takes [b] instead of b as its last argument to allow for custom fold strategies. This is a backwards incompatible change, but you can get the old behavior by applying mconcat (#364).\n Dependency loop error now lists all test cases that formed a cycle (#340).\n Dependencies can now be defined pattern-free with sequentialTestGroup (#343).\n Added --min-duration-to-report flag that specifies the time a test must take before tasty outputs timing information (#341).\n When a test failed with an exception, print it using displayException instead of show (#330).\n The -p/--pattern option can be specified multiple times; only tests that match all patterns are run (#380).\n Fix color scheme to make info messages visible in terminals with white background (#369).\n When parsing of a command-line option failed, report received option (#368).\n Support WASM (#365).\n  \nYou can give it a try using the following cabal.project:\n packages: . packages: https://hackage.haskell.org/package/tasty-1.5/candidate/tasty-1.5.tar.gz https://hackage.haskell.org/package/tasty-hunit-0.10.1/candidate/tasty-hunit-0.10.1.tar.gz https://hackage.haskell.org/package/tasty-quickcheck-0.10.3/candidate/tasty-quickcheck-0.10.3.tar.gz https://hackage.haskell.org/package/tasty-bench-0.3.5/candidate/tasty-bench-0.3.5.tar.gz https://hackage.haskell.org/package/tasty-rerun-1.1.19/candidate/tasty-rerun-1.1.19.tar.gz \n If all goes well, the release is scheduled for mid September.\n    submitted by    /u/Bodigrim  \n [link]   [comments]",

Let's say you have this very simple game, at the start you can choose how many players can play, they choose their name, the deck is shuffled, the players are put in a circular queue and the game begins. To play, simply write the card you want taken out of the pool in the order chosen. The game loop ends when no cards are left in the pool. How would you design something like this? How would you add on top?

          "description": "Hey there, fellas! Beginner haskeller here. I've come across an interesting problem when configuring Vim surprisingly.\n Description. Given several lists ordered by priority, I want to gather unique elements from them. There needs to be at most n elements overall. For each list there is its own limit k of elements I want to take from it. Only the elements that are actually taken (so, overall unique) come towards filling the limits. I attached some test cases in a separate file in case you want to give it a shot by yourself first.\n I decided to give it a go using Haskell as it is pretty abstract and I couldn't come up with anything elegant using Python.\n The imperative version seems pretty straightforward, although I haven't programmed it.\n Here's my solution: https://gist.github.com/EgZvor/12268b0d439bd916c693c38b1fd853c8 . I can't help but think it can be simpler, so as to improve readability of a hypothetical imperative version.\n    submitted by    /u/EgZvor  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm particularly interested in materials that would fit well with someone at my academic stage and can help me connect the dots between math and functional programming.\n Thanks in advance for your suggestions!\n    submitted by    /u/OakArtz  \n [link]   [comments]",

Never seen them in production code.\n - compile-time code generation: controversial.

Reading books, watching talks from Daniel Spiewak, John De Goes, and Rock the JVM.\n In my current job, I write Golang and Typescript, both on a massive microservices architecture that serves 7-digit devices, and have around 2 years of experience. I know the typelevel stack and can write/read Scala without a problem. Played around with Spark, Actors, and Akka HTTP too, so I guess I can orient myself in the ecosystem on what does what. I also have a bachelor's degree in tech/design.\n I read here that you shouldn't learn Scala because finding a job is very unlikely in some countries. So I knew beforehand, anyways I started my job hunt in Belgium. It has to be a permanent job and not too far away (1 hour 20min drive will do) or fully remote.\n So far I have found 3 companies: one paused the hiring, the other one only had one backend developer with 2 years of experience, and the last one I received no email, but they did view my LinkedIn.\n Either I become a data engineer and maybe I'll have another 5 companies I can apply to and will probably get no answer since I don't have a relevant master's degree or relevant experience. Or I start doing something else.\n Scala made me a better developer and taught me a lot so no regrets there. But what's the next best step forward? Should I get a job in Java (never written Java before) which will in the future improve my chances of landing a Scala position? Or should I hop on the Golang hype train? Of course, this greatly depends on the country.

My question: if I want to implement a generic version of Free Monad (it's generic enough a little bit like ZIO, Cats but it doesn't need to be production grade), is this the right direction?\n I have this question because I want to play with this concept by implementing it myself. Then I started to search online, finding an explanation like this. I understand the point (though not thoroughly understand everything regarding this term I suppose); however, when checking the examples on the internet, most of them use `List[A] => Option[A]`, or tap in Cats.FunctionK. I am confused generally how it's implemented. Is the example in the video is good enough, or some other implementations are recommended as references?\n Many thanks for answering my elementary school level question.\n    submitted by    /u/scalausr  \n [link]   [comments]",

It was simple, immutable, and has no special syntax for side effects. This made it very approachable and I really liked it. When I was trying to learn Haskell I struggled to understand the concept of a Monad. I understand that concepts like Maybe(Haskell) and Result(Rust) are monads but I used them only as Higher Kinded types and had a very intuitive(as opposed to formal) understanding of what they do. I think of them mostly as tags added to a primitive type. Like type Email = Email String (as a quick example), where we say that an Email is a special type of string. Btw I always wanted to add validations to a type of this sort but never figured out how. Something like type Ema…",

I was thinking of using Scalatra but I read some posts and received some feedback indicating that Scala devs prefer a different stack. I remember encountering something like this in the Rust community where backends written in Rust often don't use ORMs ( but there are ORMs available).\n Despite my best efforts, I keep finding new frameworks mentioned here in Reddit that I couldn't find searching on my own. I've also noticed that a lot of articles about Scala are kind of old. How do you keep up with new libraries/frameworks? So I want to reach out to the community and ask: what kind of stack would you use as a backend?\n I am familiar with Postgresql, but it might be the case that in the Scala community there is a special DB framework (like Datomic is for Clojure). I like Functional Programming but I don't want to use monads. I settle with a simple flavor of FP(like Elixir). I've read that effects are easier to use over monads and that Scala has support for effects but I am unfamiliar with the subject. Is it the standard library or is it an external library.\n Thank you for your time\n    submitted by    /u/glznzuriel  \n [link]   [comments]",

Ideally, I would just replace the text of the title, and leave the other properties (todo, priority, tags) in place. \n The code below instead rebuilds the whole headline by first gathering the properties, building a new title string, and then re-inserting it in the buffer.\n I am wondering if there is a simpler/smarter way\n  (save-excursion (org-back-to-heading t) (let* ((point (point)) (todo (org-entry-get point \"TODO\")) (priority (org-entry-get point \"PRIORITY\")) (tags (org-entry-get point \"TAGS\")) (title (concat (make-string (org-outline-level) ?*) \" \" (cl-destructuring-bind (title-comps title-format) (mv/org-get-title-info) (mv/format-section-title title-format (mv/org-collect-section-properties% title-comps point)))))) (delete-region (point) (line-end-position)) (insert title) (when tags (org-set-tags tags)) (when todo (let ((current-prefix-arg 0)) (org-todo todo))) (unless (char-equal (aref priority 0) org-default-priority) (org-priority priority)))) \n What the code is doing, is as follows\n  \nExtract todo, priority, tag info\n Build the new title along with leading `*` \n Delete the title line, and insert the new one\n Re-assign todo, priority and tags.\n  \nIt is working so-so. Still has rough edges.\n My question is: Does org.el have code that will allow me to replace the title in place? I could define my own regexp to do it.

Something like this:\n (\"m\" \"meeting\" entry (file+olp \"~/org/logbook.org\" \"MEETINGS\") \"* MEETING with %^{Person?}\\t:%\\\\1:meeting:\\n%?\" ) \n And that's fine if I respond to the \"Person?\" prompt with just the person's first name. So responding \"John\" gives me something like this:\n * MEETING with John :John:meeting: \n The problem is, the person's name is usually two space-separated words, and spaces aren't allowed in tags. So if I respond to the \"Person?\" prompt with \"John Smith\", I get something like this:\n * MEETING with John :John Smith:meeting: \n with the tags being broken.\n At the moment I have a kludgy workaround where I simply prompt for the name a second time, and I respond to that with a tag-acceptable version.

Many people recommended Org Roam, so I took the plunge and have been very happy with that decision. I've used roam to learn new things and better organize and consolidate what I do know, and the results have been excellent so far.\n I'm now trying to extend my system to handle problem sheets and exercises. When I'm working through a math book, I'd like to record of the exercises I solve.\n So for example, if I was working through Hartshorne's Algebraic Geometry, I'd like to be able to create a node/org file \"Solutions to Hartshorne.org\" with the chapter titles as headlines and in each headline I'd have environments like:\n #+begin_problem\n Give an example of an irreducible polynomial f in R[x, y], whose zero set Z(f) is not irreducible.\n #+end_problem\n #+begin_solution\n BLAH BLAH\n #+end_solution\n What I'm hoping for is a good, lightweight LaTeX package or class defining such environments that I can include in the header or setup files so that I can export my org file to PDF and get a nice solution manual. I'd prefer to be able to easily customize the solution numbering to match that of different books i.e. alphabetical, roman, numbers etc. I'd also like to handle problems with multiple parts well. I'm not too worried about the other aspects of the formatting.\n I realize this may be more of a LaTeX question, but hopefully I can get some advice here on how to set up the kind of system I want.

Then when I compile the document, the equation is going to appear with a number next to it, and if I reference \"myeq\" in the text, the reference is going to turn into hyperlink with the number of the equation.\n In contrast, the closest thing I can do in org mode, is adding a #+NAME property to the equation, and referencing it with a standard org-mode link. This translates nicely to latex links if I export it to latex, however, it is sort-of inconvenient if I look at the file in org-mode because the #NAME property disappears when I compile the latex fragments, so I can't tell which equation a given link is pointing to without following it.\n Any ideas how to solve this problem?\n    submitted by    /u/acosmicjoke  \n [link]   [comments]",

Got everything \"working\" and then started a simple test.\n Test 1: I went into a large personal.org file and changed the status of something from NEXT to DONE. Hit the back arrow since I think it just saves. Go to workingcopy and it shows the file has changed, great. And then do a diff... and it's several hundred changes, all of which look identical in the diff. Maybe its a word wrap (can't tell on the phone), sometimes a space. Just a bunch of green and red highlighted sections of the same content. I didn't notice a pattern.\n Test 2: I just went into the same file in basic text mode and added \"test save\" text at the top. Do the diff in working copy and the entire file isn't mangled, it just show test save as new text. BUT there is also an added block at the bottom of the file #+BEGIN_SRC scheme / blank line / #+END_SRC. How totally random?!?! (I've never made a scheme block in my life)\n ​\n So, is beOrg just doa or what am I doing wrong? It didn't parse the SEQ_TODO block at the top of my file so I added my states in the settings, but other than that it's entirely vanilla setup. I'm so bummed I had finally got this all up and working and it just seems non-functional. I'm hoping someone can point me in the right direction and I'm doing something stupid.

For instance, when I'm reading a book, and creating notes about the book, I have some mashup of the book's title and author as a headline; and notes are in sub-headings underneath that. I just informally made this up as the need arose for various kinds of thing.\n It would be nice to regularize this, so that I could later write code that has a sense of what a \"book\" is, and its fields (author, publication date, ...) and to check for the inclusion of those fields, or integrity check them, or whatever. I'm only just beginning to think about this because I have only recently come to want it based on the way I've been using org-mode, but I'm sure this has been discussed many times, and maybe there's even a package or a method that's well-understood. Some of the new-fangled PKM tools have versions of this (e.g., Logseq, Tana) but they're undesirable for other ways (mainly, in my case, their editors suck so hard).\n Could anyone suggest existing thinking on this topic, or proposed packages, or reasons why it's a terrible idea?\n    submitted by    /u/metaham  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I'm getting a weird shifting of the line numbers when using (setq-default display-line-numbers 'visual).\n When moving through rows of text, the whole buffer will shift to the right by (what looks like) 1 column. The row that this happens on isn't consistent either. Moving back up the lines of text will shift it back to the left.\n In org-roam it's usually between lines 6 and 7 that I get the shift. With emacs -q it happens between lines 1 and 2. With emacs -Q it happens between lines 9 and 10. I've seen it happen for lines above 40 even.\n I can stop it from happening by disabling the absolute numbering with (setq display-line-numbers-current-absolute nil), but then I loose absolute numbering; and that's not a solution.\n This doesn't happen when using relative numbering; only with visual.\n I've tried using both (setq display-line-numbers-width-start t) and (setq display-line-numbers-grow-only t) but neither appear to change anything. (As suggested in this post)\n I'm using emacs version 28.1. I'm fairly new to emacs too.\n Steps to reproduce:\n  \nStart emacs without config: emacs -Q\n Show line numbers: M-x display-line-numbers-mode RET\n Set visual line numbers: M-x set-variable RET display-line-numbers RET visual RET\n Press enter a few times until all text shifts right by 1 column. This happens between rows 9 and 10 for me.\n  \nAnyone have any suggestions on how to stop this from happening?\n Here is a gif showing what I'm seeing:\n text shifting when moving rows\n Update:\n It appears to be affected by the vertical size of the window. With 24 lines visible, the shifting gets pushed out to line 66/67. It is not affected by where in the window those lines are though.Fiddling with the window size, It looks like the shift position happens according to (# visible lines + cursor line # = 90).\n ie. 31 visible lines, shift between line 59/60.\n 24 visible lines, shift between line 66/67.\n    submitted by    /u/CasualtyOfCuriosity  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "TL;DR: I have a wc-mode/ dir under my .emacs.d, and I just want to add it to my .emacs.d repo. I staged it and committed but that didn't work. Pressing return on the dir in untracked files doesn't go into it (i thought maybe I could just add the files, but no joy). What gives?\n When I committed/pushed the wc-mode/ I staged I expected it to just add the subdir, but instead it went into creating a submodule (no experience with that term as far as VC goes) and added to the history that I merged a pull request from the git repo the dir originally came from (don't know where it grabed that info from). It was all very new, and pulling from my other machine just got me an empty dir. So I backed it all out manually by killing my .gitmodules file (newly created i think) and my .emacs.d/.git/modules/wc-mode (also newly created). Checked in the .gitmodules removal, but now looking for the way to just add a dir to my repo.\n I found a .git dir under wc-mode/ (don't think it was there before) and mv'd it to a bak. Now pressing return on wc-mode brings me up to .emacs.d in dired mode. Sooo confused now.\n (While I am curious about what how submodules work, and how it knew about the original github... I'd also really like to know just how to add a directory of files, since that seems very common.)\n ​\n Thanks for any and all help. I know this is a bit of a shit post from a debug perspective, but if you could point me toward the right info/book/etc that would be great. The magit info seems a bit obtuse at times, it's great for explaining low-level functions but not so much at explaining the designed workflow for things like this.\n ​\n    submitted by    /u/ImportanceFit1412  \n [link]   [comments]",

So recently (and probably foolishly) I did list-packages and let it update everything. Doing this kind of broke doom-modeline for me. I was getting weird ISO characters in the modeline, and with some research discovered that it had switched to nerd-icons at some point in the past. Previously it was working fine with all-the-icons. \n Well I got nerd-icons installed and that fixed things up pretty much though the character is still quite small in comparison. However I discovered that the little icon doom-modeline uses for VHDL files is different from the one treemacs and all-the-icons uses for VHDL files. So this got me looking around for some definition of what file suffix gets associated with what icon.\n And that's where I got stuck. I can't find any option or list anywhere that sets that up. It's not that I need them to be the same (though I do prefer the one in all-the-icons) but now I'm just puzzled as to how this is assigned. Clearly it's got to be in the elisp somewhere, but... nothing so far.\n Does anyone know where it lists a character hex value and a file type list?\n    submitted by    /u/remillard  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "As an active Emacs user and package developer, I've been contemplating the structure of tabulated-list-mode in Emacs Lisp, particularly its use of vectors. While vectors are efficient for indexed access, they present challenges when dealing with complex data structures or transformations.\n Much of my work involves parsing data from JSON API responses, which naturally form alist, plist, or hash-table structures. In the current iteration of tabulated-list-mode, a two-stage process is necessary: first, normalization into vector format (I find it hard to imagine a structure where the entry format (ID [DESC1 ... DESCN]) could originate from), followed by rendering through tabulated-list-print. This process can introduce performance inefficiencies.\n In real-world scenarios where normalization to the tabulated-list's vector format is unavoidable, the efficiency advantage of vectors is somewhat negated, and can even result in an overall performance loss due to the extra conversion step.\n I'd propose using lists instead of vectors in tabulated-list-format and tabulated-list-entries. This change could potentially allow for greater flexibility and better alignment with common data inputs. However, I understand that historical decisions and compatibility concerns may limit the feasibility of such changes.\n In the interim, I suggest enabling tabulated-list-print to act as a transducer, reducing the need for multiple iteration passes. This could significantly streamline the rendering of non-vector-compatible data while preserving compatibility and performance.\n I've noted that some libraries also struggle with this issue, resorting to workarounds and hacks, as evidenced in the magit-repolist-columns documentation string.\n I welcome your thoughts, advice, and any potential solutions or alternatives. If there are potential pitfalls I've overlooked, I'm keen to learn about them too.\n    submitted by    /u/elgrekoo  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I am taking mathematical notes using org mode and would like to have inline previews for commutative diagrams. For mathematical equations previews works perfectly with dvipng, but since dvipng doesn't play well with tikz-cd based commutative diagrams I changed to using imagemagick by setting org-preview-latex-default-process. However, when using imagemagick my latex previews (equations, diagrams etc) come out huge -- the text itself is appropriately sized, but the \"frame\" of the image is huge. See the below for examples:\n With Imagemagick: https://i.stack.imgur.com/SWS65.png\n With Dvipng: https://i.stack.imgur.com/yRkTV.png\n As you can see, in the first example the image is so large the lorem ipsum paragraph isn't even in view.\n How can I fix this? I would really like to use imagemagick for commutative diagrams, but having such huge images is unwieldy.\n    submitted by    /u/dargscisyhp  \n [link]   [comments]",

Emacs to the rescue, with Mickey's help.\n I ended up doing things a little differently, since my setup is not the same. I store my passwords in a .gpg file, and wanted to retrieve the totp key from there, instead of from auth sources. And I also preferred to use oathtool for the main task, instead of the adapted version of Jürgen Hötzel's `totp.el'. Which, as a bonus, spared me of handling the base32 decoding.\n But Mickey's post was really useful in showing an alternative and laying the ground work.

However, my current daily driver is a low-end laptop, and I wonder what's the best practice to start emacs so it won't load a ton of packages to just edit a 1-2 files. I built emacs29 from source, with native compilation, I'm also lazy loading most of my packages, which are just a few, but I wonder if running `emacs` instead of `emacs -nw` or `emacsclient` , might be affecting my starting up time and cpu/mem consumption. \n The later implies that I should start the `emacs daemon` on startup? What's the difference between the options I mentioned above? I would appreaciate any suggestion. Thank you in advance!\n    submitted by    /u/blureglades  \n [link]   [comments]",

In other words, the work may end up being done as several sessions in a single day, or even across multiple days. Either way, it can be useful to log what was done at each \"visit\". I've tried a couple of methods, in particular with a view to being able to produce some kind of time-filtered status report, perhaps via a clock table (cf. this question) :\n  \nUse org-add-note (C-c C-z) to add a timestamped note to the task, in the same way that state change notes get added. That's nice and quick in terms of adding the info, but I've never been able to find a way of getting that into any kind of time-filtered report, \n Create a sub-headline for each \"visit\" -- usually using org-capture with a C-0 prefix. I'll clock into and then out of that and that means a clock table can pick up the sub-headline to use as my note of progress for that visit. It's tolerable, but it still restricts that progress note to just a headline, and I 'll often want to say more than that. \n  \nHow do others log progress in tasks?

Specifically using that link https://snapcraft.io/install/emacs/fedora \n But emacs has this \"twitchy\" behavior where it goes \"back\" for a brief moment and returns to the current \"state\". Let me give me example to illustrate the behavior better: Suppose I am the beginning of a line of text, then I run `C-k` to delete it. The line is deleted, then it shows up again for a brief moment, and then not anymore. Just to clarify, let me add the sequence of events:\n  \n(line present) Displays line\n (deteles line) `C-k`\n (line deleted) No display line\n (line deleted) Displays line for a brief moment\n (line deleted) No display line\n  \nThis behavior happens with basically everything, meaning the new \"state\" (a word is typed, a buffer is switched, etc) is displayed and then momentarily goes back to the previous \"state\" (when the word had been typed, etc).\n My problem felt similar to this https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/112uuse/emacs_29060_is_bit_jumpy_scrolling_when_using/ but it isn't because I emptied my `init.el` and the problem still persists.

So started with trimming my setup down to the bare minimimum\n ``` (use-package magit :custom (magit-display-buffer-function #'magit-display-buffer-traditional))\n (use-package forge :after magit) ```\n and found that to be working well, i.e. I didn't have to manually \"start\" forge by running e.g. forge-pull. I then re-introduced my setup piece by piece to see when it breaks. (Luckily it's not very big.)\n In the end I made this change, where the relevant bit is this:\n  (use-package forge :after magit - :general + :config (mes/despot-def forge-post-mode-map \"c\" '(\"submit\" . forge-post-submit) \n That is, I swapped the use of :general to :config when bringing in forge. (I'm still using :general when setting up magit as using :configresulted in keybindings going missing.)\n I can't pretend I know what's going on here, but my gut tells me there's some \"interesting\" interaction between straight.el, general.el going on.\n I'd love an explanation, but I'll be happy enough if this post will reduce someone else's head scratching when observing something similar.\n    submitted by    /u/magthe0  \n [link]   [comments]",

For example: all files in org-agenda-files plus whatever is in org-agenda-text-search-extra-files\n Includes any given headline (from the above files) if and only if it has a clock entry in a specified period -- last week, two months ago, etc\n Lists the headlines in chronological order (ascending, or user-selectable)\n Displays the headline itself, plus the relevant clock entry and associated text (i.e. it's not just an clock table)\n Is exportable using org-export-dispatch << This is important because the report is for more than just my own benefit. So, a mere dynamic view within emacs is not sufficient. I need to be able to produce a PDF, or HTML, or the like.\n Can do all this based only on the data and meta-data in the headlines themselves. That is, it should achieve my desired data output format without enforcing on me a data storage format. I'm adding this requirement because my (partial) solution to the problem so far has been to store my daily notes in a datetree format (fed by org-capture), which encodes information not just with a heading's data and meta-data but also in its position. But that is neither a complete solution, nor a good one even where it does go part way.\n  \nHow would/do you achieve this or something like it?[1]\n thx!\n [1] Ideally, using Org out-of-the-box, without having to write a bunch of lisp. But, failing that, I'd take pointers to lisp approaches.

It's slowly but steadily getting traction and activity, to the point that you might have even seen it mentioned at Sacha's blog.\n Over there, one of the things that we are still missing is content from people with questions, or small tips/tricks to share. I was thinking of automating some of this work I've been doing and I started working on a small bot that could post a comment on every \"self\" post asking the OP to also take a look at the alternatives. \n The question is: would that be ok with the mods and the community here? If a bot posting on every comment is too much I can maybe make a rule for limiting to 2-3 submissions a day, but more than anything I would like to know if the community at large would consider this alternative or if most are actively in favor of sticking to reddit.\n    submitted by    /u/rglullis  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "In some of the projects I work with, there might be 25+ imports at the beginning of a file and I almost never need to look at them. On the other hand, I almost never use code folding, and my config already has so many packages in it that I wondered if I could hide those imports using only built-in functionality. Surprisingly, hideshow.el apparently doesn't have this functionality built in, so I took a crack at making it happen.\n After some fiddling, I came up with this: \n (defun rex/php-fold-use-block-initially () \"Hide the initial block of `use' statements in PHP buffers.\" (interactive) (save-excursion (goto-char (point-min)) (ignore-errors (re-search-forward \"^use \")) (set-mark (point)) (while (ignore-errors (re-search-forward \"^use \"))) (ignore-errors (hs-hide-comment-region (region-beginning) (region-end))) (deactivate-mark t))) (add-hook 'php-mode-hook hs-minor-mode) (add-hook 'php-mode-hook rex/php-fold-use-block-initially) \n This does what I want, but it's not elegant and it seems pretty fragile (then again, it hasn't broken yet and I've been using it for a couple of days now). Because it does work, I figured it might help someone else too if I shared it, ymmv. \n EDIT: In order to hide import/include/whatever keyword your language uses to include code from libraries or elsewhere, you would need to change the regex pattern \"^use \" to \"^include \" (for instance) and add the appropriate mode hooks. \n P.S. Now that I think of it, this function should actually be generalized to accept the pattern as an argument...\n    submitted by    /u/skyler544  \n [link]   [comments]",

I profiled it and it was pointing at a function called redisplay_internal taking up almost all of the usage, but when I expanded it the sub-functions didn't take up as much as redisplay_internal. Emacs -Q causes the redisplay_internal usage to drop considerably and the lag to go away. I'm wondering if anyone has had this issue or if not how I could go about further dissecting what is going on since profiling didn't lead me in the right direction.\n I have a sneaking suspicion doom modeline may be part of the issue since one of its functions has come up in the many profiling runs I've done. Disabling it seemed to help briefly, but redisplay_internal tends to stay higher than the emacs -Q profiling(in that it is lower than running M-x commands in cpu usage).\n EDIT: After singling out parts of my config it seems that doom-modeline is indeed the culprit.

I am a emacsclient user: I run emacs --fg-daemon with systemd user session and connect to emacs server through emacsclient (both GUI and TUI).\n The problem I am having now is: after running Emacs GUI client (v29.1 from Ubuntu 22.04 snap install) for a few hours, opening three dozons of buffers plus 1 LSP (gopls), I switched to Emacs client TUI. TUI hangs quickly (less than 1 sec) after connected to the server:\n  \nI see my active buffer of GUI in TUI for 0.5 sec => based on my understanding, this should not happen: a new client should not render the active buffer of another client\n Emacs TUI switched to scratch\n Emacs TUI stopped unresponsive\n Open another Emacs GUI client and this instance worked fine\n  \nWhat's the right way to debug this issue? Is there a way to dump the threads and stacks of the runtime? My hunch is LSP may be the problem. I hope to investigate before asking for more help.\n Thank you!\n    submitted by    /u/sherlockmao  \n [link]   [comments]",

What steps have you taken to make the user experience as smooth as possible?\n So far, I've come across Bozhidar's[1] post, which has been quite helpful. What's currently bothering me the most are:\n 1) Non-functioning keyboard shortcuts like \"Super + arrows\" for window manipulation. This is a known bug[2] across all WSLg applications due to the lack of support for this mechanism in non-native Windows' windows.\n 2) The inability to open files in the Windows system using Emacs (WSL2). This is particularly frustrating for Org files, of which I have quite a few on my disk.\n 3) Duplicate icon on the taskbar. I know it's a minor issue, but it's quite annoying. When I pin a shortcut for Emacs using \"Pin to taskbar,\" then open Emacs using the shortcut, it doesn't \"overlay\" the pinned application. Instead, a new icon appears next to it.\n [1] https://emacsredux.com/blog/2021/12/19/wsl-specific-emacs-configuration/\n [2] https://github.com/microsoft/wslg/issues/22\n    submitted by    /u/AsterOps  \n [link]   [comments]",

Or when I call a function it will sometimes tag the names of the arguments like so:\n  \nconfig.get<std::string>(tag: \"the_key_sought\");\n  \nI would like it to not do this - these annotations unconditionally inserting itself into the flow of text pushes things out of alignment, makes rectangular yank more confusing, etc.\n Does anyone know the name of this behavior or (even better) how to configure my eglot+clangd setup to not do this?

However, this approach isn't any faster than using org-babel-load-file in my opinion:\n (if (file-exists-p (expand-file-name \"config.el\" user-emacs-directory)) (load-file (expand-file-name \"config.el\" user-emacs-directory)) (org-babel-load-file (expand-file-name \"custom-init.org\" user-emacs-directory))) \n org-babel-load-file only auto-tangles during startup when it detects a modification; otherwise, it loads the cached stuff.\n The fact that Emacs initially loads the init.el file and then needs to access a different file, regardless of the method used, is what introduces a speed penalty.\n I was thinking about giving up on the Org literate setup, but right now, I don't have much time to redo my Emacs configuration in plain Emacs Lisp. I know there are cool stuff like the outshine mode, etc.. However, I'm wondering if there might be another way. Maybe there's a way to have Org mode directly add everything tangled into the \"init.el\" file? That would make Emacs load much faster without the need of a server/client thing.\n Also, do you think Org really adds a layer of unnecessary abstraction for a literate config, to the point where I should think about giving up at some stage?

          "description": "I've been playing with Emacs 29's native tree-sitter for indentation and other ideas. First impression: it's really so very powerful compared to the bad old days of regexp matching and even ppss. It just understand the code. So far so good.\n That said, I've been trying to assess performance impact for applications that run frequently, e.g. via font-lock. Finding node at point is insanely fast: a fraction of a µs. But to my surprise, tree-sitter actions like \"find all parent nodes starting from the current node\" tend to vary in duration from (still very fast) 2–10µs to hundreds of µs or even several ms, depending on where the search starts from. I certainly expect some variability as you navigate from different depths within the syntax tree, but repeatable factors of 1000 seems a bit extreme, and make it hard to predict performance for latency-sensitive code.\n Does anyone have insight into this performance variability? Do you experience it as well? Perhaps it depends on the parser backend (I've tried only python so far)? Or is it fundamental to the TS algorithm?\n An example simple code to try, from various code locations in a large-ish file:\n (benchmark-run 100000 (let ((n (treesit-node-at (point) 'python))) ; or whichever language you have (while n (setq n (treesit-node-parent n))))) \n Multiply the result by 10 and that is the number of µs each \"navigate up from node\" operation takes.\n    submitted by    /u/JDRiverRun  \n [link]   [comments]",

The newest release branch that had an Android.mk was nougat-release, so I copied that file outside the repo, went back to branch android13-release and moved Android.mk into the repo directory.\n I compared the file to Android.bp but saw essentially nothing that was needed to change. I set LOCAL_SDK_VERSION := 25, but am unsure if that variable has any significance. I eventually compared Android.mk to CMakeLists.txt, and discovered that I had missed a file needed in my_src_files_arm: arm/palette_neon_intrinsics.c\n Building without that extra source file caused no complaint from the build, but emacs crashed at start up.\n To build with the libpng library I added the following option to configure:\n --with-ndk-path=$HOME/projects/android/libpng\n After the build it is a good idea to check that the expected library files are actually in the build directory:\n ls cross/ndk-build\n    submitted by    /u/johan_widen  \n [link]   [comments]",

For example, in my job, I like to keep on top of certain technology trends and it's useful to me to track them. The stories I find might be slight, but I'm more interested in a larger pattern that they represent. The pattern may or may not be obvious at first, or it may end up going in a different direction than what I expected, or it may end up being noise.\nMy idea is that I would create a note documenting what interests me about the story and have a structure note representing the broader trend, but curious if others have thoughts on the merits and demerits of this kind of approach within a zettelkasten framework.\nThe concern I have is that I will fall prey to the collector's fallacy, and end up with a bunch of notes that are little more than \"So this happened.\"",

After this change, I noticed that I had some knowledge gaps I wanted to fill and some skills I wanted to improve.\nI read technical documentation and watch online courses or webinars about technologies that were not my area of expertise, practices that are mostly in the software engineering world, new network or security concepts, and other stuff related to the so called \"soft skills\", such as How to Write Technical Documentation, How to become Persuasive, Give successful presentation, foreign languages. And on top of that I have lots of family concerns such as, family psychology, recurring tasks, hobbies and other.\nFor all the above, my brain cannot keep everything and thus the search some months ago brought me in front of some new to me methods, like zettelkasten, BASB, How to Take Smart Notes and lots of software. But to be honest, I haven't found my own workflow yet, what system to follow and what software to combine.

I look forward to your critiques/feedback:\nIn Indian philosophy, light can be understood as both physical and metaphysical. \n\nPrakasha refers to manifested light. There are three types: \n* ordinary fire (_jada agni_), \n* sunlight (_saura agni_), \n* lightning (_vaidyuta agni_).\n\nThe original spiritual light is _jyoti_. \n\nHow does physical light interface with the metaphysical?\n* Physical light sustains life on Earth, for example, sunlight provides energy through photosynthesis. \n* [[Prometheus stole fire and was punished for giving power to humans]]\n* Light enables creation, as consciousness is the first element required.  \n* Light is involved in metaphysical visions too:\n1._Krishna_ grants _Arjuna_ a glimpse of his effulgent divine form, which _Sanjay_ also perceives through inner sight. \n2. The _Nachiketa_ and _Yama_ story conveys spiritual light's ability to illuminate the knowledge of death and immortality.\n\nSource: link",

          "description": "I have recently started using OpenAI-based MacWhisper to dictate notes. Perhaps many of you have used dictation for your notes, but I find that Whisper has extremely high quality and gets things like punctuation, hyphenation, capitalization and so forth correct even with my strongly Indian accent. One of the benefits I have seen from doing this is that my notes have become somewhat more conversational than before. I find this to be a benefit rather than something bad, because it seems to be capturing what I am thinking now somewhat better. Perhaps this conversational tone of the note might be more relatable a few years down the line, but that is just a guess.\nAll the whisper models of all sizes are free but Macwhisper provides a free way of accessing these for the three smallest models. If you want to use the larger models you have to pay a one-time fee of $20 to make that possible. Perhaps other free tools even with the large models will become available soon. In terms of privacy, one of the good things here is that the model is sitting on your computer so the data never leaves the computer and it seems safe even for private notes for that reason.",
