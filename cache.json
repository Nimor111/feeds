On the PureScript side, we use our own purescript-react-basic bindings, and purescript-lumi-components, a UI component library that we built and open-sourced. We get a lot of utility from PureScript’s type system, leveraging the compiler in order to ensure that we don’t get IDs for different entities mixed up, that all API calls are type correct, and that all form data is appropriately validated before it is used. On the Haskell side, we primarily use Servant and Esqueleto. We don’t expect candidates to have experience with all these things. We’d like to find engineers who are interested in learning more about these, and we’ll be happy to teach you.\n Lumi was recently acquired by Narvar, where we are continuing to grow the team and leveraging Narvar’s experience building the software infrastructure that powers billions of e-commerce shipments for companies like Patagonia, Nike, GAP, Home Depot, etc.\n    submitted by    /u/kepano  \n [link]   [comments]",

Its paradigm feels extremely natural in a way beyond the complexity of its encoding would suggest. eg looking at the implementation of reflex a few times, it seems to basically implement an entire runtime system on top of haskell's runtime system.\n On one hand it's very cool that haskell is flexible enough to implement a runtime system as a library, but I wonder if there's gains to be made in something more wired in (eg in terms of optimization, simplifying compile times, simplifying types, etc.) - it always struck my as a bit hacky.\n I know elm used to have builtin FRP but dropped it (I don't recall exactly why - any insight here would help!)\n Perhaps a proper \"dataflow\" language - though my (poorly informed) impression is that these are all way more special purpose and I've been spoiled by the full power of haskell.\n What do you think?\n EDIT: Looking into it more now - I redescovered this explanation of why Elm dropped FRP. It's honestly pretty disappointing - I understand from a developer UX perspective this simplifies a lot of things, but I'm not a fan of the redux \"smash-everything-into-one-type\" pattern - and a big draw for FRP is having the control flow represent dependency locality rather than synchronizing everything on one monlithic state\n    submitted by    /u/CoBuddha  \n [link]   [comments]",

Some examples of the kind issues i'm interested in detecting are:\n  \nThe field \"base_path\", if it exists, cannot use Windows paths, must be POSIX\n The field \"date_created\" must be in ISO8601\n etc.\n  \nI'm capable of writing the linter rules (i.e. detect date formats, path formats etc.), what I need help with is the IO / initial parsing phase. I'm familiar with parser-combinators (attoparsec has been my goto previously) but never before had a use case that cares about where the parsing failed. I've also used aeson a couple of times for handling JSON.\n The defining requirement is that, once an issue has been identified, the linter must report the location of the error including line number(s) and column numbers (start and end). It can be assumed that the data is valid JSON and conforms to the expected schema (i.e. if we expect a \"date_created\" field, it'll be there. I'm interested in format/quality issues rather than validating structure / syntax.\n Otherwise, the only requirement is that it be quick / run in parallel - It must be able to run over thousands of files in a couple of minutes.\n My initial plan was to use something like pipes-aeson for IO (not used a streaming library before but seems straightforward enough) however it seems that aeson is based on attoparsec and the parse-error is just a plain string without source locations.\n So, finally, to some questions.\n  \nAnybody have recommendations for parsing JSON (quickly) while keeping track of the source-locations of each field / key / value / object etc.\n Can streaming libraries like pipes be used to process the loaded files in parallel? Pointers / articles etc. covering this would be much appreciated!\n  \n   submitted by    /u/LivewareIssue  \n [link]   [comments]",

Maybe it's actually possible just with library support for something like a linear ResourceT monad but that still feels a bit unsatisfying)\n As far as I can tell, it's solely the brainchild of Tweag - which is great to have industry support, but worrying in terms of robustness and longterm support as GHC develops. Linear types really needs fairly deep integration with the rest of GHC to be most useful.\n  \n1/2/3 are the only ones really stopping me from going all-in on linearity right now, but I expect all of them to get resolved eventually so long as 7 isn't an issue.\n So my question is: What's the latest developments on linear types in haskell / who is working on it / what's the best place to keep updated?\n    submitted by    /u/CoBuddha  \n [link]   [comments]",

(I'd note that ! is more powerful than the suggestion described here, since the applicative syntax doesn't neatly support nesting; complex expressions end up in a join/pure soup.)\n Anyway, I was just wondering whether the GHC language design team had ever seriously considered porting this? There does seem to be demand for it: many mainstream imperative languages (even JavaScript!) have adopted ! - they just pronounce it await (and it's only applicable in their \"promise\" monad).\n    submitted by    /u/benjaminhodgson  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi everyone, is there an alternative formulation of monad transformers that allow removing any reference to the base monad inside the e.g. bind definition of the transformer ? \n The reason I'm asking for that is I'm porting some Haskell transformers to Python, for which I would like to avoid chains of lift.lift.lift... \n A good way I found is simply to make a custom subclass of each transformer in the stack, so that they can be looked up for their lift by \"tag\" (the specific subclass) rather than numerical position (aka number of lift nesting). That would make composition of function using different monads very easy, even if they have not been designed to work together specifically \n This would still allows the user to use multiple transformers of the same type (e.g. StateT), since the user can create as many subclasses of StateT they want for each piece of state.\n The problem with that is that if the user uses e.g. SubclassofStateT.pure(42), the base monad is not known , and has to be \"resolved\" later (when looking up the index of this class in the stack to lift appropriately). Unfortunately automatic, lifting is not enough since the definition of e.g. pure() would require the knowledge of the base monad which we don't have at this stage. Hence the need for an alternative formulation that allows delaying this knowledge to later.\n EDIT: fix typos\n    submitted by    /u/Dasher38  \n [link]   [comments]",

So function f is applied n times.\n -> With lazy evaluation the expression is reduced to\n let p = map f xs in head (p)\n which reduces to f applies to the first element in XS. i.e. f xs0 \n ​\n In the second part of the question, there is a function filter p which when applied to a list returns a list of elements that satisfies the boolean test p.\n filter :: (a -> Bool) -> [a] -> [a]\n head . filter p xs returns the first element that satisfies the condition p. \n In the question I'm having a hard time visualizing how lazy evaluation will work. With innermost reduction, the filter is applied to each element of the list and a list with elements that satisfies p is returned and head takes the first element of the list. \n How will lazy evaluation work here? applying p to the input list might prune away elements from the output. \n Is it that with lazy evaluation, filter p is applied only until the first element in the list meets the criteria as opposed to eager evaluation where filter p is applied to all elements in the input list?\n    submitted by    /u/AngstyChippy  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I think one of the massively underrated use cases of Haskell is as a tool for discussion. For example I recently was chatting to a friend about a particular chess analysis he was experimenting with and although he is a non-programmer we were able to explore the idea very deeply through a quick 2 hour XP style discussion. He was 100% able to follow the data types and basics, but most importantly able to follow and guide the algorithms that resulted (as much as I was encoding english to haskell, he was also able to map back from haskell to his own internal model easily). \n Haskell might be difficult to write, high learning curve etc, but its simplicity to read and follow is an underrated super feature?\n I blogged about it here (if you are interested in more detail of our XP session and some code snips etc) https://www.tomwells.org/blog/haskell_for_prototyping\n    submitted by    /u/tomwells80  \n [link]   [comments]",

The only thing keeping me from this conclusion is that I use a lot of oop techniques in tandem with the above.\n Or do I just want what's bad for me?

So what does (elem text) even mean? It has to do something, because if I take those parentheses out, the function no longer works. Yet (elem text) doesn't actually work on its own, so what is going on here?\n Also, all takes a list of booleans right? Assuming all is supposed to be applied to a list of booleans, I would think that (elem text) ['A'..'Z'] should get reduced to a list of booleans, but actually that code also doesn't work on its own.

Huge thanks to /u/maerwald for spearheading it!\n Other highlights from the changelog:\n  \nUTF-8 support: add Data.ByteString.Short.isValidUtf8 and use safe FFI for large inputs.\n Improve performance and laziness of unlines.\n Improve performance of intercalate.\n Improve allocations of singleton.\n  \nMany people contributed their time and effort to make this release happen.

This is a problem because emptyDocs have a height of 1 and will introduce an unwanted newline in the final document.

          "description": "At the moment, GHC has some machinery for tracking (annotating and inferring) the roles of parameters to type constructors. Roles and their machinery do not appear to be first class, in that it is not possible to discuss the roles of parameters to higher kinded type variables. This is a bit annoying, because in the absence of the ability to discuss such things one has to explicitly carry around coercion dictionary baggage.\n The \"role\" of a parameter roughly encodes the sort of \"equality functor\" the type-level function is. Specifically, the role of some type constructor's parameter determines what kind of equivalence it needs as input in order to produce a representational equivalence as output. If it requires _, the parameter has a _:\n  \ndefinitional equality, nominal role\n representational equivalence, representational role\n codiscrete equivalence (any two things are equal), phantom role\n  \nSo it seems to me that properly speaking, the role actually belongs to the -> in the kind of the type constructor in question. Namely we have three different variations:\n  \nhaskell type Nominal :: Type -{NOM}-> Type data Nominal x where Nominal :: Nominal Int \n haskell type Representational :: Type -{REP}-> Type data Representation x = Representational x \n haskell type Phantom :: Type -{FAN}-> Type data Phantom x = Phantom \n  \nSimilar systems of inference, notation, \"subtyping\" etc. could be devised to the ones for linear function arrows (which occur at the type level), so that working with these things is not very painful. It might also make sense to think of \"role polymorphism\", although I personally haven't given this much thought.\n What do you folks think? Am I missing something obvious?\n EDIT: The Reddit editor ate half my post and I had to rewrite it, apologies to anyone who saw the truncated version.\n    submitted by    /u/dinkandenza  \n [link]   [comments]",

While Prelude gets a lot of shit, it's so minimal and unopinionated that it really encourages creating language features as libraries. With QuasiQuoters you can take this to a logical extreme, convincing the compiler to compile whatever you want essentially. It seems to take very little convincing to get the language to do anything you want in the way you want as long as it's logically well formed.\n Personally as someone who loves programming language design it's really incredible, if there's a feature in another language that I want to try, I don't have to switch languages, I can find a package or just stub out an implementation in a weekend. I've heard this used as a point against Haskell however, because it lets you work with very bizzare computational models and can make a code base feel kind of disjointed. Personally, I don't buy that, while Haskell does have modules that let you differ from the norm, the norm tends to be the easiest option. You CAN have Alan Kay style objects, you CAN have prolog style logic programming, but why would you when the language is still so effective without them. Of course, eDSLs are a thing too, tho they're less hot pluggable language features and more an incredibly nice design pattern that arises naturally from the language design unless they're designed to operate more generically.\n Anyway, Haskell is cool and I wanted to talk about it, but I'm sure I'm preaching to the choir here.\n    submitted by    /u/VincyThePrincy  \n [link]   [comments]",

I find it somewhat vexing how these different error types cannot mix because they carry different information, and I would like to be able to propagate them to a higher level in my program where the errors can be handled properly.\n To this end I have added a monadic Result type for my own application that is roughly data Result a = Valid a | Invalid Error where Error is my own error sum type that can represent any external error that the program might have to handle. Result has the obvious Functor, Applicative, and Monad instances, and I use it to wrap most actions that can fail including reading and writing files, parsing, validating user input, and so on.\n Is this a good approach? It seems a little unwieldy to set up so many wrapper functions, but it pays off when I can handle the errors so much more smoothly at the top level.

If we had two arguments like foo :: (ClassOne a, ClassTwo b) => a -> b -> c, then it's not clear to which class foo should belong.\n Stack Overflow Source\n    submitted by    /u/Foo-Baa  \n [link]   [comments]",

The part of resolution order makes sense to me (with some configuration of OVERLAPS/OVERLAPPABLE).\n But I know why I can't write this - the a in the instance definitions match all types! And the instance resolution simply does not use the constraints to resolve the instances. My understanding of the reasoning for this design is that Haskell would become internally inconsistent, because in different contexts, prettyOrShow could have different behavior for the same types in different contexts. Great - I love that - super safe. But in this case I DONT CARE. I want to write this out of convenience - so I don't care about safety here - if the behavior is inconsistent I will still sleep deeply and peacefully . If we had dependent constraints or something similar, perhaps this would be easy - but as it stands - this is not...\n Is there a way to do what I want to do? Make it as grimy as you like.

Building it with dynamic linking does work though (by removing the ghc-options under the swoogle executable), but I'd like for it to be consistent between CI and the dev environment, for the most part. \n Discrepancies in CI and dev\n  \nDockerfile\n GitHub Actions file\n cabal.project.freeze\n swapi.cabal\n  \nThis has more to do with how cabal resolves the dependencies. So this is the result of the most recent job: (GitHub Actions, PasteBin).\n My question here is, despite freezing the dependencies (and committing it), why does cabal resolve them differently? Locally it all builds, and runs just fine. But in the CI it seems to be complaining about conflicting versions of base, for example. At one point it also complained about req, and some other libraries. I think I'm missing something obvious to make it consistent between both environments. I don't understand where it pulled that new base version from.\n I'll try to provide more information if ever what I've provided so far is insufficient.

Primarily I do Data Analysis, because of my academic Machine Learning background, which makes my role closer to Data Scientist. \n However, I am interested to work on Distributed System, Databases, and Stream Processing- that is Distributed Data Systems in broad. I wrote a Microservice in Golang in my current workplace. But I do not think this experience is sufficient to get hired as a Data Engineer working on Distributed Systems.\n I guess, after talking to some other Data Engineers and going through job posts, a project that involves mocking data streams, data ingestion with Kafka, data processing with Flink, serving with ad-hoc Scala microservices, containerization with Docker, and deploying on a Kubernetes (MiniKube perhaps?) cluster might help. What else to add or remove?\n What may I do to learn and later get hired to work as a Data Engineer working on Distributed Systems?\n    submitted by    /u/yoctotoyotta  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi!\n [Disclaimer] I just started learning Scala. So I hope this question is not too basic.\n I'm doing the Advent of Code 2021 challenges to get a feeling for the language. Day 2 is a task where we have to parse a file, where each line contains a command. Each command updates one of 2 variables. I've tried to implement this using a functional programming style. I convert the commands to (Int, Int) tuples, where each element is a delta introduced by the command. Then, I need to sum these tuples element-wise (like a vector sum). Doing this sum was not very nice, because Scala seems to disallow tuple destructuring in (anonymous) function parameter position. Am I missing something?\n Also, do you have suggestions how I could make my code more idiomatic? I would love to hear them!\n Thank you in advance!\n  def problem1_tuples(input: Iterator[String]): Int = { // input is an iterator of lines val (position, depth) = input.map(s => ( applyRegex(s,forward_pattern), // returns update for first value in tuple or 0 applyRegex(s,down_pattern) - applyRegex(s,up_pattern) // update for second value )).fold((0,0))((a,b) => (a._1 + b._1, a._2 + b._2)) // this is *ugly* position * depth // the challenge asks for the product } \n    submitted by    /u/flo-l  \n [link]   [comments]",

Whenever I've tried to write a full app using purely FP design principles, it feels like it becomes a mess as I layer on more and more features. Because of this, I feel my main limitation is how to use functional composition for a larger system when dealing with network requests/responses, database operations, dependency injection, loose coupling, etc. I can write an application that does all these things, I just haven't been really happy with the results.\n What I'm hoping to get is one of two things. The first would be an example codebase, something open on GitHub. Something using, maybe, http4s and cats? Something that I can look through and study how it's been architected, maybe even transcribe it (I have found that re-writing code makes it stick in my head better than just reading it).\n On the other hand, maybe there are some tutorials/courses/etc out there which cover this kind of stuff. I really do NOT want one of those \"This is a functor\" type FP courses, I don't need that at this point. Something that goes much deeper into full-scale application construction is what I'm after.\n Thanks in advance for any help and guidance you can provide.\n    submitted by    /u/Droid2Win  \n [link]   [comments]",

I've got a lot more experience with Java & Kotlin than Scala, fyi.\n Anyway, while doing this Akka course I just decided to create a nice simple utility function within an object to abstract away all the boilerplate setup/teardown for actor systems during the course:\n package io.me.akka package io.me.akka.utils // BONUS: Not my main question, but why do we declare packages twice? import akka.actor.ActorSystem import scala.concurrent.ExecutionContext.Implicits.global object ActorSystemHandler { def useSimpleSystem(name: String, useSystem: ActorSystem => Unit): Unit = { val system = ActorSystem(name) useSystem(system) system.terminate() .map(_ => println(\"ActorSystem terminated\")) } } \n My issue is when i try to use this into one of my lesson objects, like so:\n package io.me.akka package io.me.akka.part2actors import io.me.akka.utils.ActorSystemHandler // This is the line for #2 import akka.actor.{Actor, ActorRef, Props} object ChangingActorBehavior extends App { ActorSystemHandler.useSimpleSystem(\"systemName\", system => { // Do stuff with the system }) } \n There are two main issues that occur:\n  \nWhen I type the name ActorSystemHandler, I get the option to auto-import it like usual in IntelliJ. However, when I actually click that option, nothing happens. The IntelliJ auto-import fails to do anything.\n I go ahead and manually add the import statement, as can be seen above. However, \"io.me.akka\" part of the import is shaded in that grayish color that IntelliJ uses to indicate something is not necessary.\n  \nI'm hoping someone can clarify the above points for me. Manually adding the import results in code that will compile/run, but I feel like I'm doing something wrong. Thanks.\n    submitted by    /u/Droid2Win  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello guys! I am a front-end web developer, tired of JS-TS.\n First of all, I am not familiar with Scala and its ecosystem, so, sorry about that.\n I own a startup which is close to make a deal with an organization for a serious project.\n I always search for viable JS alternatives and really like Scala as a language (even though I have no experience with it).\n For the last 2 days I am researching on how to embrace Scala-js. I managed to gather some information. \n Concern no 1: interop with the JS ecosystem. Solution: scalably-typed\n Concern no 2: react bindings. Solution: Slinky\n Concern no 3: bundler. Solution: Not so sure, but I've found scalajs-bundler which works with webpack, but I am unsure about the integration with Concern no 4 bellow.\n Concern no 4: Monorepo setup-build system. \n If anyone is familiar with JS ecosystem, there is the nx.dev monorepo managing tool which has the features I need for this project, which will be structured with a feature based folder structure.\n What I need:\n  \napps folder containing 3 applications which will share many libraries-modules from the libs folder mention bellow \n  libs folder which will contain feature based modules, for reuse across the 3 apps\n  \nSomething like this:\n apps/\n ├─ app-1/\n ├─ app-2/\n ├─ app-3/\n libs/\n ├─ feature-1/\n ├─ feature-3/\n ├─ feature-4/\n ├─ feature-2/\n ​\n How can I achieve this? Anyone with experience with something similar?\n As a reminder, those 3 apps and libs will target JS, and will need a bundler.\n Is it possible to only build the affected apps when changing some feature on libs folder?\n Even if it is possible, how maintainable will it be?\n Thank you for your answers!\n    submitted by    /u/AkisArou  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "When testing the basic functionality of my actors, my receiveMessage() event on my test probe is timing out, because the probe isn't listening for messages on the actor that I've spawned.\n ​\n For some context, I have 2 actors\n  \nA TaskManager actor\n A Session actor\n  \nMy TaskManager actor has 2 commands:\n  \nCreateSession(id) - This spawns a new Session actor\n SessionCreated(id, ref) - When a Session actor is spawned, it sends the SessionCreated message back to the TaskManager so that I can store the ref of the session (and perform other stuff)\n  \nHere's where I'm running into the issue. I can't seem to figure out how to write a test to listen for messages coming back to the TaskManager actor that I spawned. When running the test, it times out waiting for the receiveMessage() event.\n Here's my test code:\n  \"Task Manager\" must { \"be able to create sessions and receive a reply from the session when its created\" in { val taskManager = spawn(TaskManager()) val sessionProbe = createTestProbe[SessionCreated]() taskManager ! CreateSession(\"session1\") val reply = sessionProbe.receiveMessage() // ^^ times out } } \n I've been searching the docs and Googling everywhere, but I can't seem to find any documentation on how to listen for a message that should come back to an Actor that was spawned in the test.\n ​\n I've tried adding a new parameter to the CreateSession message to supply the probe ref, but then the probe receives the message instead of the taskManager actor, and thus the taskManager won't complete the changes that I need to test subsequently. I do know that the taskManager value does have a ref, but it doesn't have a receiveMessage method, so I'm stumped here.\n ​\n Any help is appreciated!

          "description": "Ok, I've been learning akka, and I'm trying to wrap my head around thread safety. Let's recap\n JAVA THREAD MEMORY MODEL\n All threads have their own little slice of memory exclusive to that thread. Periodically the JVM will sync the thread memory values to main memory, but it's not guaranteed when that will happen. This is why different threads can see different values of a variable.\n Volatile of course bypasses this by making a given variable always be read/written from/to main memory. Synchronized enforced the other piece of this, ensuring that only one thread at a time can interact with it to prevent race conditions.\n AKKA ACTOR THREAD MEMORY MODEL\n So I do not totally understand this, but here is what I do understand. AKKA has its own thread pool, and is purely message based. A given actor is executed on any available thread when a message is present for that actor.\n The first thing that trips me up is that Akka only executes a message on a given actor one at a time. Ie, a given actor will process messages synchronously. I could be wrong about this, please tell me if I am. This just seems like a bad model for concurrency vs a more traditional approach like the thread-per-request model of a traditional webapp like Spring.\n The second thing is that while this kind of message processing rule would prevent race conditions, it feels like memory consistency would still be an issue. If an actor can be operated on by multiple threads, even if those threads can't touch it concurrently, how do all the threads see the same state value? Wouldn't there be a risk of memory consistency issues? Are actors somehow made entirely volatile?\n CONCLUSION\n I clearly do not understand some key stuff here. Guidance would be appreciated.

          "description": "Howdy. So I have worked with Scala before but quite a few years ago. It was my big introduction to functional programming and by the end of the project I understood functional programming just well enough to be interested in it. Since then I have studied it extensively in languages that are not purely functional, mainly TypeScript, and this has motivated me to pick up Scala again.\n I know that Scala 3 has just come out. Obviously I would like to work with the latest version. However my experience with other major software updates leaves me a bit wary. I have seen in other ecosystems major updates causing widespread compatibility issues with common libraries resulting in a highly complicated process of figuring out what will and will not work with the new version.\n On that note, I'm hoping for clarity on a few points:\n 1) does scala 2 code compile in a scala 3 project?\n 2) will third party libraries written for scala 2 still be compatible with Scala 3? I'm inclined to say yes because it all compiles to Java bytecode but I just want to be sure.\n 3) any other pitfalls that someone with limited scala experience who will be starting with Scala 3 should know?\n Thanks in advance.\n    submitted by    /u/Droid2Win  \n [link]   [comments]",

On the PureScript side, we use our own purescript-react-basic bindings, and purescript-lumi-components, a UI component library that we built and open-sourced. We get a lot of utility from PureScript’s type system, leveraging the compiler in order to ensure that we don’t get IDs for different entities mixed up, that all API calls are type correct, and that all form data is appropriately validated before it is used. On the Haskell side, we primarily use Servant and Esqueleto. We don’t expect candidates to have experience with all these things. We’d like to find engineers who are interested in learning more about these, and we’ll be happy to teach you.\n Lumi was recently acquired by Narvar, where we are continuing to grow the team and leveraging Narvar’s experience building the software infrastructure that powers billions of e-commerce shipments for companies like Patagonia, Nike, GAP, Home Depot, etc.\n    submitted by    /u/kepano  \n [link]   [comments]",

I want to add a project open command which would check org-roam for a node associated with this project and create one if it can't find one (The idea is that this node would contain the project's support material a la GTD). I had originally thought to use org-roam-protocol's roam-ref, but I think I don't understand how the file-ref which org-roam-protocol requires works.\n It seems intended mostly for citation purposes, which I think could work (maybe there'd be a way to get from emacs back to the projectwarrior project eventually?). But to do that, I think I'd need to write some sort of custom citation format. Unfortunately my Google-fu is failing me at the moment, as searching \"new org-ref protocol\", \"custom org-roam-ref citation format\" and several other related results hasn't brought up any results that pointed me in the right direction. So, here's the question(s):\n  \nIs there a way I can suppress the warnings from org-roam when I put a ref that is plaintext? This isn't actually my preferred solution, but I figure I'd start here.\n Is there a place I can find instructions on how to create a custom whatever-it-is that org-roam is expecting in the ref field?\n Is there another approach to opening (or creating if necessary) an org-roam node from the command line?

I'm having trouble articulating what I want. \n I am using Doom Emacs.\n There are two things I have been trying to figure out how to do. They are probably very simple but I can't seem to word them correctly in text so I am having trouble finding solutions. \n I have ADHD, so things become very messy very quickly. If I don't lay things out a certain way I can become distracted and/or lose interest. One way to prevent this is by adding some flair to whatever I am doing. Does anyone have an easy way to add some style to an org document? Some ideas I had was to change header colors, add images (which I have sort of figured out), and maybe add borders or something.\n Another issue caused by my constant mental blockages is organization. When I had seen projects in the Doom dashboard I thought this would work but it seems designed for coding projects. How does everyone organize their org files? I'd like to find a way to set up a notebook type thing and open a directory in a buffer to navigate between the different files. Like a table of contents for every projects, and maybe a master TOC for all of my org files.\n Again, sorry for the long winded post. I suck at Reddit, and don't expect much response cuz long posts get ignored, but figured I'd shoot my shot.\n    submitted by    /u/DocHoliday89  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi all,\n I've been using org-mode for writing articles for a while. And I recently tried RMarkdown. I am trying to decide which one to use in the future. \n I really enjoy org-mode. The only problem for me is that since I do not do programming, I do not know any computer language. I have to copy and paste settings by other people for different purposes, such as spelling check, formatting, preview, etc. RMarkdown in RStudio sets up things for me and I can download some packages by others without any specific setup. \n I also feel that I do not fully use amazing functions of org-mode. For example, while I really like the to-do list and agenda, I do not know how to seamlessly synchronize my calendar (Mac OS) and my org-mode agenda. Many of my meetings are scheduled by others sending me .ics files. I can just go to my calendar and click \"accept\" or \"decline\". Is there a way to automatically make the item appear in my org-mode agenda when I add items on my apple calendar? \n Anyway, maybe too much information here. Just curious to see others' experience of using org-mode for academic writing.\n    submitted by    /u/beerbearbare  \n [link]   [comments]",

We have headings, with levels. Fine. Where I stop following is when I export, say to a html buffer (C-c C-e h H) every heading level has been decreased: one star headings are tagged as h2 and two stars as h3. Here, on a very basic test file: \n https://preview.redd.it/p9pbaypvm8j81.png?width=1165&format=png&auto=webp&s=23832603cda8cec5ff07bd711f661d8fe71f2902\n Since I am rather new to Org and to Emacs, I imagined I had some issue with my Org configuration or that I screwed up something elsewhere in Emacs, as I so often do.

I find it strange that I cannot use the most recent stable version but still need it for dependencies.\n  \n   submitted by    /u/chs75  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I started using orgmode two months ago after I learnt about it from videos from thoughtbot. Never having used emacs before and not knowing lisp it took me while to ramp up on it. I found the way you can have neatly nested lists and have math equations quite nice. I set up org roam as well . Everything on doom emacs. But after 2 months of using it I find myself in a situation where it has turned out to be not all I expected it to be. * The org roam promise of becoming a second brain didn't really work for me. Maybe I'm not using it correctly but having backlink info in the buffer I didn't find that useful. It's not easy to find things unless you remember the name or keywords in the title.\n  \nWriting long documents feels clunky in orgmode. Maybe it's more adapted to short todos. I don't know how to explain it\n \nExport options : I can export to pdf but the output often doesn't look good with the weird section numbering. Having nested items looks good inside orgmode but not in an exported pdf. There's no option to export to doc that I'm aware of. It makes collaboration with others difficult\n \nIt doesn't work well with tools my team uses with slack and google docs. \n \nAnd many others\n \n Has anyone else felt like this? What am I doing wrong? I'm planning to go back to vs code and mark down files because emacs looks like a big investment. But I really like the idea of a macro enabled editor.\n Edit: I didn't expect such useful and positive feedback from everyone. You guys are the best. I found some promising stuff . I'm going to give it another try. Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/Alternative-Ant-4741  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Currently, when executing org-babel blocks, I get the following:\n #+begin_src emacs-lisp (cl-position 2 '(2 6 7)) #+end_src #+RESULTS: : 0 \n I think the results section take up too much, and I would like to make this more compact with something like:\n #+begin_src emacs-lisp (cl-position 2 '(2 6 7)) #+end_src => 0 \n I have a couple of questions regarding this change:\n  \nHow would I go about making this work? I am pretty new to directly touching the Emacs packages themselves, so not sure how this would look.\n Are there any drawbacks to this approach that I might not have considered?\n  \nThanks.\n    submitted by    /u/avindroth  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "HI, I cannot find on the internet ways to be faster on using org mode to move items between files, I am doing some hacks but I know that there have to be a faster way, to optimize such a repetitive task.\n Intuitively I opened two vertical windows, so that i have in window 1 a file A.org in a buffer, and in window 2 a file B.org in antoher buffer\n What i cut in a file is not pasted as I would expect in the second bufffer:\n 1) Selecting ONE heading with relative subheadings, or selecting subheading in windows 1 cutting and pasting in window 2 at a different level of nested level, is painful, because the two files have different level of indentation(I mean number of asterisks). So for example if I have in window 1 a block of text that is at a third level, when I am going to paste in window 2 `at a specific point` at a 5th level, is `not` going to be recognized that need to be pasted \"under\" the 5th level and so be recognized as a 6th level the heading(from window 1) and at a 7th level the relative subheading. \n I would rather select multiple files in window 1 and paste in window 2:\n 2) I would like to select multiple headings, or subheadings in window 1 an then just paste them in window 2, so far I have been able only to do it one per time, instead I was expecting to cut in window 1 all the text I needed and then paste all in window2 (I mean like when I am using a resource browser on a PC and I select with control click all the items i need(not consequential) and then paste on a certain point in window 2\n    submitted by    /u/ivano_GiovSiciliano  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hey folks,\n Hope you're doing great. I'm using Emacs for about 15 years (So basically a rookies in scale of Emacs :P). Based on my experience over the years and specially in the recent times, not many people know about the wonderful world of Emacs and why it is such a fascinating tool. To me they are missing out a chance to enjoy Emacs. So, a while ago I've decided to create a video series and talk about Emacs Lisp in context of a long running project to create an \"editor\" with Emacs Lisp, In hope to help more people to enjoy the tool that changed the way I use computers and brought me joy over all these years.\n Yesterday, I recorded the 4th episode of the video series. I thought to myself that It might be a good idea to share it on this subreddit as well. I have a looooooong term plan for this series and looking forward to your feedback.\n Like to the latest episode(4): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NE1XUfrrGYI\n Link to the playlist: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkfndJuDzsA&list=PLlONLmJCfHToFfk1WgTOwZMfIr062jIN9&index=1\n Cheers\n    submitted by    /u/lxsameer  \n [link]   [comments]",

If I do:\n (add-hook 'conda-postactivate-hook (lambda () (eglot-reconnect)))\n Note I am using the conda.el package for conda environment switching.\n This does not work, instead I get the error \"Error running timer: Process EGLOT (test/python-mode) not running\"\n Is there a way for me to cleanly restart Eglot in the buffer as though I had changed environments before visiting the file?

I don't like chonky bloated IDEs\n Other options\n https://github.com/sudar/Arduino-Makefile - How with the above mentioned QOL though\n Note: I'm very unfamiliar with elisp, I can do very basic things via trial and error while copying other stuff from my config.\n Do you have any idea what could be done here?

This is because I may later use it in talks, white-papers, etc., where preserving the vector quality is crucial.\n So, after some time trying (and failing) to convince myself such functionality must already exist, I wrote up a small package.

I think it is fairly well known that if you use straight.el, deactivating package.el in your early-init.el will speed up your starting time. What I only just found out is that on launch, straight does a lot of checks to see if any of the packages installed have been altered. This process can be changed by modifying the straight-check-for-modifications variable. I don't edit any of my straight packages by hand, so I have this set to nil, before bootstrapping straight. This brought my startup time from ~2 seconds to ~0.5 seconds, for loading over 200 packages. Maybe there are some reasons why one shouldn't do this that I don't know, but it seems to be a nice way to save some time!\n For more information, see this section of straight's read-me: https://github.com/raxod502/straight.el#customizing-when-packages-are-built\n Hopefully this is of help to someone!\n    submitted by    /u/jamez5800  \n [link]   [comments]",

However, I'd like to start moving some of that stuff out so I can manage it myself and make comments. I tried pulling some stuff out and putting into my init.el, but it didn't work. Namely, I pulled out these:\n '(org-todo ((((class color) (min-colors 89)) (:weight normal :box (:line-width 1 :color \"#808080\") :foreground \"#FF00FF\" :background \"#f0f0f0\")))) '(org-upcoming-deadline ((t (:foreground \"#FF33FF\")))) '(org-warning ((t (:background \"#ffffa0\" :foreground \"#ff33ff\" :weight normal)))) \n Why don't these work within my init.el? I tried them before and after my (load custom-file).\n EDIT: Ok I see I'm supposed to use set-face-attribute. So I tried wrapping the above, but this doesn't work\n (set-face-attribute 'org-todo ((((class color) (min-colors 89)) (:weight normal :box (:line-width 1 :color \"#808080\") :foreground \"#FF00FF\" :background \"#f0f0f0\")))) \n EDIT 2: I figured out the answer. A correct, commonly used form for set-face-attribute is like this:\n (set-face-attribute 'org-todo nil :box '(:line-width 1 :color \"#808080\") :weight 'normal :foreground \"#FF00FF\" :background \"#f0f0f0\") \n And it probably didn't work with a straight copy because each of those first three lines, I think those are args to the function (custom-set-faces...).

The idea was rather well accepted but I got a lot of feedback, that the README was too dense in information and it was hard for a new user to try it. I have tried fixing this, by integrating gifs for demonstrations instead of the raw info (which I moved to the wiki for anyone wanting it), adding a set of default bindings in the form of a hydra and a small sample config to get you started.\n ​\n I believe some people might have been set off by those problems, so I wanted to say thank you for pointing them out. I would love to hear what you think of it now, that I have tried to make it more explanative and if it is truly easier for someone to get started with it.\n ​\n As I said in the other post, I am very new to this, so I really appreciate and listen to feedback, as I feel the idea itself is good, but some parts of the implementation may be lacking, and who better to help me than the community.\n ​\n Thank you all for helping,\n Best regards,\n Vidianos\n    submitted by    /u/AuroraDraco  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi, I want to set up my personal development environment for C++ in emacs, and I have a few questions:\n I installed clangd and LSP, and if I open just one .cpp file it's all good, but when I bring in multiple headers and files in different directories it doesn't know where to find them (of course), how can I fix it? Also, I used to use makefiles, but I read that since clangd uses something called compile_commands.json and CMake can produce them, the latter would be a better option... the problem is that I don't know how this whole interaction works and I can't find a clear explanation about this on the internet. Lastly, is there a way to use only makefiles instead of CMake, or is it either impossible or impractical?\n    submitted by    /u/Dumb-Ptr  \n [link]   [comments]",

I didn't know how to get rid of this formatting, so I restored it from the backup notes.org~, as I had only made a minor change (thank goodness). Here's the two files, the original (restored), and the ediff highlighted file:\n https://i.imgur.com/K7340jK.png\n Now my questions are as follows:\n  \nI thought org files were visible text only files, editable in any other text editor. But it's clearly saving the highlight features with the text. How is it doing that? What is the format?\n \nIf I end up with something like this on the right again, how can I strip all the highlight formatting, so I get back to what's shown on the left?\n \n    submitted by    /u/Status-Detective-783  \n [link]   [comments]",

There is a sort of pseudocode block with a few references to chunks that come later, and I would like to have completion while writing these chunks somehow. Editing the :noweb yes chunk of code using C-c ' does not seem to expand the noweb references at all, which is not ideal. The blocks themselves also don't have completion when I tangle the :noweb yes block to a file and use lsp-org.\n Both of those solutions feel like they should work, so it is possible I've run into a bug because I'm running gccemacs. Is this the case? Is it normal for noweb and lsp-based completion for python to just work inside of your org file?\n I'm very much hoping I'm just doing something wrong, as the potential of this style when writing code for high-turnover teams with mixed capabilities seems very high to me.

          "description": "Out of the box, calling org-store-link when point is on a headline displayed on an agenda view behaves as you would expect: it does much what it would have done had you called org-store-link from an org-mode buffer visiting the relevant file with point on the same headline. But if you set org-agenda-sticky to t , calling org-store-link from an agenda buffer gives the following error:\n user-error: No method for storing a link from this buffer \n After digging around a bit I think I found the culprit: for the agenda relevant behavior of org-store-link to be activated, you need to be in a buffer with the name specified in org-agenda-buffer-name. On my end, org-agenda-buffer-name is set to *Org Agenda*, but when org-agenda-sticky is set to t, agenda buffers have a different name of the form *Org Agenda(VIEW)*, where VIEW is the key to the relevant agenda view (so, e.g. *Org Agenda(a)*).\n Now, if I set org-agenda-buffer-name to e.g. *Org Agenda(a)*, I get org-store-link to work as expected when visiting an agenda buffer with that name. But I do not seem to be able to use org-agenda-buffer-name to get Emacs to recognize an agenda buffer when org-agenda-sticky is set to t.\n Any ideas?\n    submitted by    /u/graduale  \n [link]   [comments]",

There was linked issue from that one to a github issue on Flycheck's repo about releasing said version from 2020, with no actual traction on finishing the release.\n There haven't been any commits to master since August 2021, regardless of the fact that there are 45 open pull requests, and users requesting that a new release be cut for 2 years. Their CI jobs don't run anymore because they're linked to travis-ci.org which has been in read-only mode since July 2021 and no longer accepts new build jobs.\n Is Flycheck dead?

The article basically explains what are Avy actions and how to create new ones. This got me inspired to create my own Avy actions, which I'd like to share with the community in the form of a literate config.\n The shared config, extends some notions and creates new ones (some left as a kind-of challenge in the mentioned article):\n ​\n - Region actions: actions that act in an arbitrary not visible region created with avy selections (copy, yank, kill, teleport). First you mark the initial point of the region with an action, then you execute a region action on the other end of the region.\n - Quick char commands: skip the initial filtering step of an Avy command pre-filtering a character. For example I use this in emacs-lisp mode to auto filter open parenthesis with a key binding, this is very useful as actions act on Sexp.\n - Auto actions: enable the automatic execution of an avy action on a selected candidate\n - Compound actions and commands: link several avy interactions in a single command or action using auto actions. This is useful for example for region actions, instead of executing two Avy commands to first mark the start of the region with a command and then select and act on the end of the region; you only execute a command that integrates two Avy interactions, the first one auto applies the mark action, then you select the action and element at the end of the region. I also use this for creating a replace action, combining kill and yank actions in one action.\n ​\n I hope this results useful for someone.\n    submitted by    /u/artema666  \n [link]   [comments]",

I don't want to build a second brain or create a personal wiki, instead I want to capture and link ideas for researching and writing.\n Using org, I'm naturally drawn to org-roam, however, I dislike the bulk of dependencies and its complexity stemming. Furthermore, I dislike, that I can't get a textual overview of a subset of notes belonging together (using a webserver-solution like org-roam-ui is not what I want here). Looking at the new zk-package, I want to note that I like its simple and clean approach, but I dislike, certain design decisions, like using spaces in file names and the fact, that it doesn't integrate deeply in the org-ecosystem, e.g. not utilizizing org-IDs. The last point is the biggest downside imho. While one could hack on the codebase to change this, another drawback seems to be that it is not really mature and doesn't seem to have a large userbase. \n Currently, I'm try out both of these very different options, but I can't really decide for on or the other, since both have different strengths and downsides. Therefore, I want ask for your opinions and experience with implementing the Zettelkasten-method (or a personalized derivation of it).

They remain easy to read even when they are many, they might be scrollable if needed, integrated with switch-buffer search&narrow packages, they might co-exist with a sidebar (like those popular in IDEs), even on one and another side of the screen and potentially spark new UI ideas to extend them further. \n What do you think about that?\n    submitted by    /u/ftrx  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "So, to understand my problem, let me explain my situation.\n I am Greek and naturally a lot of my files are in greek. To make org export to a latex pdf properly, if it has greek characters, you need to add some packages to it. I have those in my org-latex-packages-alist and everything exports just fine. \n However, when we get to exporting org-roam files (or any file that contains file links for that matter), there is a problem. The org latex export backend typically exports a link like \\href{file_name}{description}. If the file name is in greek (which odds are it is), latex starts to freak out a bit. Org will export perfectly to latex, but latex won't export to pdf. To my understanding, it doesn't understand the greek characters in the file name (which it should as it understands them everywhere else) and it chooses not to export.\n After a lot of searching, I did manage to find a solution to this in this post. Basically, if the link is of the form \\href{\\detokenize{file_name}}{description}, it exports perfectly. From what I understand, that command just makes it recognize any unicode character for file names. \n So my question is, can you configure the org latex export backend to export links in the form \\href{\\detokenize{file_name}}{description} and not \\href{file_name}{description} as it does by default. I couldn't find any option that changes how hyperref makes its links in the hyperref manual, nor could I find how org exports its links to latex in the org-export manual, so if anyone here knows, it would help me greatly.\n Thanks in advance!\n    submitted by    /u/AuroraDraco  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Consult-project defines an endpoint for accessing different sources related to the common project workflow. Using Consult's narrowing system, the user is able to access the current project's buffers, project files and all the known projects, in case they want to change projects quickly. Consult-project provides an extension to the default Consult functionality, using the built-in package project.el, defining the functions consult-project and consult-project-other-window. Furthermore, Consult-project only depends on consult, resulting in a lean and simple to maintain functionality.\n ⚠️ NOTE: This package has come to life adapting the great package consult-projectile by OlMon. Most if not all credit should go to him, I have been using his package for months now. What inspired me to create this package is my recent effort to avoid most third party packages, specially if they prefer a newly defined interface over the built-in Emacs interface.\n Also special shutout to Daniel Mendler for making such a great package!\n I would appreciate any feedback, I'll try to submit the package to MELPA next.\n https://reddit.com/link/sszyq3/video/dl9szj9m4zh81/player\n    submitted by    /u/Qkesslerr  \n [link]   [comments]",

(Not thaaaat important to me, I don't blog regularly)\n  \nI have realised that I can do most of those things also using orgmode.

But this time I made something that I think might be useful to others so I'm sharing it here.\n This is a minor mode that can do well with LaTeX or org-mode. \n What it does is: convert valid lisp expressions to LaTeX expressions. As you know we can evaluate lisp expressions directly in emacs (C-x C-e), so I had this thought why not use emacs as a calculator while typing the text without the need to move to another buffer to calculate things.

I also prefer to use a UID internal to the body of the text instead of using a filename as I am very new to this and still changing my titles. To create an internal link, I copy the UID number of the filename (without the title) at the top of the body of my zettel. Then in my second zettel, I open a [[]] and inside I paste the UID number of the first zettel. The [[UID]] becomes green. When I hover on it it says that the file is not found. When I click on it, a search is launched and I have my two zettels that appear in the search bar but the target zettel does not open automatically. Is it normal? Should it only open in the search bar?\nI saw that a \"#\" was sometimes set before the UID (in the body) of the zettel of origin. Is this necessary besides to denote that it is the zettel of origin?\nThank you and sorry if it is a bit messy (or very obvious), I am totally new with markdown and all of these softwares!",

Citations are still just reminders for later.\nThe inclusion of the zettelkasten into the lexicon of contemporary productivity scenes, many of which view note-taking systems through the lens of task and project management, has led to confusion as to what a zettelkasten is and for what it can be used. This confusion becomes particularly apparent when comparing zettelkasten to other note-taking methodologies, where the zettelkasten is seen as an advanced (and sometimes outdated) way to store and retrieve notes. I'd like to argue that the zettelkasten should not be considered within the lineage of agnostic note-storing systems and apps, but rather as something else entirely: a note-making and note-linking me…",

          "description": "Hello all,\nI recently discovered the Zettelkasten system and thought it seemed a disciplinary and constructive tool for someone who makes connections between ideas all day long but doesn't write them down (like me). I've gotten as far as downloading Obsidian, reading the first chapter of a book called \"The Bitcoin Standard,\" writing fleeting notes, and then polishing the relevant ones into literature notes. What repeatedly evades my understanding, however, is the nature of links.\nI do not know when or how to use links. For example, if I have a note that defines the economic term \"coincidence of wants,\" and I have another note discussing how \"indirect exchange enables coincidence of wants in a diverse economy,\" should I: reference \"coincidence\" inside \"indirect exchange\"; reference \"indirect exchange\" in \"coincidence\"; do both of those; not link them at all but tag both notes with \"coincidence of wants\" and find them when I do the color-coded tag search?\nAnd then there's the matter of linking two (seemingly) unrelated ideas. Do they get linked to each other, and then to a third note of the new idea they inspire? Both notes separately linked to the third?\nHelp is appreciated.",

I\"m sure many people here know this, but I thought I'd share it here as it wasn't obvious to me at first.\nIf you open a new window (from the Window menu), it opens a second copy of The Archive. Normally, this window operates independently of the first window.\nBut what I hadn't realized is that, if you have the second window open and highlighted, you can right click on links in the (unhighlighted) first window. If you hover over a link, right click and select Open Link in that window, it leaves the first window on its current page, and opens the link in the second window. Very cool. This is really useful for copying material between documents that are part of the same \"tree\" of documents, without losing your place or leaving the current document.",

I've been playing with it for just a few days now, and I've already found some of the KMs very helpful.\nThanks, @Will, for many of them!\nI was wondering if anyone had ever created a KM for inserting a link to a structure note on a zettel.\nFor me, I put my links to the structure note and other zettels at the very bottom of each zettel. I've used the naming convention for structure notes that includes the • between the UID and the text title.\nI was thinking if there was a way to set it up so it worked something like this:\nI place my cursor in the appropriate location in my zettel.\nI enter the key combination for the KM to insert my structure note link.\nIt then gives me a prompt, asking me which structure note I want to link to (it would limit it to those zettels with the • in the title).\nI select the appropriate structure note.\nIt automatically enters that structure note as a link in the format of UID and text title of the structure note.\nIs this possible? Is it unnecessary?\nThe reverse of this would be a time saver too. For me, I often add a link to my newest zettel to my structure note immediately after I create the zettel. So, if there was a way to go back to my structure note and use a KM to create a link to the most recently created zettel (of even a prompt to choose from one of the more recently created zettels) that would save time too.\nOr, have you guys found ways to save time and do this without a KM macro?",

That note is also connected to coaching and therapeutic ideas.\nI had some epiphanies and good concepts while working on those notes, and that created 2 other notes.\nAt first, I was writing everything in the first note \"Transform information into knowledge\" which was becoming almost like the start of an article. The \"flow\" got to me and I wrote some good ideas and made some good connections.\nI'm new to Zettelkasten but I remember the Permanent / Evergreen notes should be atomic and if possible, quite short.\nSo I splited my \"Transform information into knowledge\" note into 5 different notes.\nI now have 5 different notes, linked together, talking about the same idea.\nIn a MOC about Therapeutic Changes, I added all those 5 notes.\nIt's a bit confusing to me because naturally I would have kept \"Transform information into knowledge\" and let that note because a bit longer and like an \"index\" of all the others ideas, and put that note into my Therapeutic MOC.\nAnd when I see examples here and there I feel like permanent notes are not \"that short\" and even sometimes, not that atomic.\nWhat's the best method here in your opinion ?
