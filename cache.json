I've met people who claim that Haskell code should perform around 5-10x slower than C, Tikhon Jelvis says that mildly optimized Haskell can perform around 3x C in time, kuribas claims that Haskell should perform at least at 50% of C, an acquaintance can get Haskell to half of Rust's performance, and there's libraries like Attoparsec and Streamly that claim 80-90% of C performance. And of course, there's Don Stewart.\n ​\n What's the secret to getting high performance Haskell? Are the ultra-fast libraries concurrency scams (i.e, C is single-threaded, Haskell is parallel)? Or are the ultra-fast libraries actually as fast as they claim, and that it's possible to get Haskell to near-C speeds? \n Because I love Haskell as a fun toying-around language, given how concise the language (and functional style) can be. Especially when you have defections to the Rust camp, keeping Haskell performant is a worthy goal, and I guess high-performance Haskell is joked about as \"only if you're Don Stewart\" or \"dark magic, summoned by sacrificing puppies and kittens\".\n ​\n Any tips, links, advice to get ultra-high-performance Haskell, other than, perhaps, inline-C? ;)\n    submitted by    /u/Instrume  \n [link]   [comments]",

Please check its GitHub for what it can do! \n We've been using codd at PRODA for some months (though we've been using parts of it for far longer in a transition and test period) to apply our migrations, run schema consistency checks and manage our multiple environments' databases, from dev to staging, production and tests. I'd like to thank my friends at PRODA for their support and feedback all this time: it has been invaluable. \n Now I find it's time to release codd to a broader audience, and thought of this community because it's written in Haskell. \n I hope the documentation on GitHub explains reasonably how codd works and its nuances.

To put it mildly, Haskell was everything that I used in the past 4 years. I'd say I'm in an intermediate level in utilizing Haskell. I did my bachelor thesis using Haskell, and doing my master thesis using Haskell again. I also had student jobs in which I taught and programmed using Haskell and Scala.\n I'm starting to ask myself what I'll do after graduating. Do I look for a Haskell job? (I'm based in Germany, and everything I'm finding is requiring to already have many years of experiences in the field which I don't have, and I also found other jobs in cyber security which are related to Functional programming but I have no expertise in that and they always ask for people with experience). This means I can't help but to wonder what I will be doing for living.\n Do I ignore Haskell and fp in general for now? Which other it-jobs could be suitable for someone with my modest expertise? Which other languages should I concentrate at instead? Which IT-jobs should I keep an eye on if Haskell jobs are not within reach? Should I try to find a job in cyber security since many cyber security jobs ask for Haskell developers? Does anyone have a personal experience with my dilemma or any advice on what I must do next?

To add a few more positive news, today is also my 29th birthday 🥳🎂 Your best gift to me would be to support my Haskell Open-Source work via GitHub Sponsorship. Or you can just star Iris on GitHub, and this would encourage me to continue doing more Haskell OSS!\n ​\n https://preview.redd.it/qhjsjndrpala1.png?width=2772&format=png&auto=webp&s=a4cf9f2880a0a8f4a5a8ce1f210bb666141a572b\n    submitted by    /u/chshersh  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "https://hackage.haskell.org/package/sorting-network repo: https://github.com/Javran/sorting-network (PRs are welcome!)\n I have this idea of using TH to turn sorting network into partial sort functions for small lists (2 - 16 elements) for a while. Not many resources turn up with I searched Haskell topics on this so I got my hands dirty. I'm happy with the performance (see some benchmark output below) with my proof-of-concept code, so I decided to turn this into a package (apologies that I didn't spend much work on documenting, in my defense I'm quite excited to share it - expect quality to improve in future releases).\n To use this, import Data.SortingNetwork to bring into scope functions like sortList4By :: (a -> a -> Ordering) -> [a] -> [a] (partial function) and sortTup4By :: (a -> a -> Ordering) -> (a, a, a, a) -> (a, a, a, a) (supporting list / tuple of 2 - 16 elements, but TH module is exported so you can generate more).\n To explain how it works, the implementation took some inspiration from https://doisinkidney.com/posts/2018-05-06-sorting-small.html. For a input size 3, a sorting network (more specifically, my package uses https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batcher_odd%E2%80%93even_mergesort - I'll try to try to have optimal network and other varieties in future releases) would compare and conditionally swap a-b, a-c, b-c in that order (I'm kinda relying on optimization to figure out data dependencies and take advantage of parallelism). And the TH generates function like below (name shadowing is intentional for demostration, although in code I do ensure that all new variables are fresh):\n sortTup3By = \\cmp (a, b, c) -> let sw = \\u v f -> if cmp u v == GT then f v u else f u v in sw a b \\a b -> sw a c \\a c -> sw b c \\b c -> (a, b, c) \n Unit tests are complete coverage based on 0-1 principle.\n Benchmark output is available: https://gist.github.com/Javran/95cf757866668e43fe188d70f25c1c05 (comparing with Data.List.sort)\n    submitted by    /u/Javran  \n [link]   [comments]",

The latter seems like it would play much better with fusion. I didn't check, but perhaps it's more efficient too? Both versions generalize trivially to foldl1', which would be great to add to base if only to define maximumBy and minimumBy in terms of it. Those are currently defined as\n maximumBy :: Foldable t => (a -> a -> Ordering) -> t a -> a maximumBy cmp = fromMaybe (errorWithoutStackTrace \"maximumBy: empty structure\") . foldl' max' Nothing where max' mx y = Just $! case mx of Nothing -> y Just x -> case cmp x y of GT -> x _ -> y {-# INLINEABLE maximumBy #-} minimumBy :: Foldable t => (a -> a -> Ordering) -> t a -> a minimumBy cmp = fromMaybe (errorWithoutStackTrace \"minimumBy: empty structure\") . foldl' min' Nothing where min' mx y = Just $! case mx of Nothing -> y Just x -> case cmp x y of GT -> y _ -> x {-# INLINEABLE minimumBy #-} \n Or am I missing something?\n    submitted by    /u/effectfully  \n [link]   [comments]",

The entry point is https://hackage.haskell.org/package/ogma-cli.\n Code\n The github repo is located at: https://github.com/nasa/ogma.\n What's coming\n The next release is planned for March 21st, 2023.\n Ogma is currently undergoing the qualification process necessary for NASA Class D Software. Apart from the changes required by that process, we also have the following in our roadmap:\n  \nExtend ROS 2 monitors with further information about sources of violations.\n Add tests to generated code.\n Simplify NASA cFS monitor generation process.\n  \nHappy Haskelling!\n Ivan\n [1] https://github.com/Copilot-Language/copilot/\n    submitted by    /u/ivanpd  \n [link]   [comments]",

After doing about two problems, I wasn't satisfied with the pace at which I was completing the homework, so I fired up GHCi in my terminal. In theory, what I am describing here can be done with any language with a REPL, but Haskell's syntax makes for extremely fast prototyping (in my opinion).\n First I created a function that would map some common confidence intervals to it's corresponding z-score. I.e. 0.9 -> 1.645. Took 10 seconds.\n Next I created a function that would take some sample mean as an argument, number of samples, and variance as an argument and it would return a function which, when given a z-score, will return a tuple that represents my confidence interval. \n Next, plug and chug. A homework that could have taken me an hour and a half took me 15 minutes. Next step is to integrate it with LaTeX so it will automatically write out the answers for me :) \n Maybe this is a trivial example but I was just really impressed with the ease and speed with which I could quickly slap together a \"custom\" calculator and start plugging in the values I care about.\n    submitted by    /u/Zephos65  \n [link]   [comments]",

Is he right when he says that: \n ​\n ```\n A monad in programming is made up of three parts, also known as the three laws of monads:\n  \nUnit (also known as \"return\" or \"pure\"): This is the function that wraps a value into a monadic context. In cowboy terms, you might think of this as the cowboy who rounds up a calf and brings it into the corral.\n Bind (also known as \"flatMap\" or \"chain\"): This is the function that applies a function to a monad and returns a new monad. It allows you to chain operations on the monad. In cowboy terms, you might think of this as the cowboy who takes a calf from the corral to the branding iron, then from the branding iron to the castrator, and so on.\n Associativity: This is the law that says the order in which you chain the operations with the bind function should not matter. In cowboy terms, you might think of this as the cowboy code that says you should always ride in the direction of your destination, no matter what order you do your chores in.\n  \nTogether, these three parts make up the monad. In cowboy terms, you might think of it like a group of cowboys who work together to round up and process cattle. Each cowboy has a specific job to do, and they follow a set of rules to make sure they get the job done right. \n ```\n ?\n    submitted by    /u/GarlicGuitar  \n [link]   [comments]",

Please accept my humble apologies. https://engineering.iog.io/2023-01-24-javascript-browser-tutorial/\n Here is why Haskell/JS won't suck anymore after \"foreign export\" is here:\n  \nI will be able to code a standard HTML/CSS website that mostly works even on text-based browsers and Tor Browser without JS enabled. Users of text-based browsers will get graceful \"<foo.jpg>\" placeholders. To code this website, I will obviously use Haskell on the backend.\n If the user has JS enabled, I can have a link on the site that says \"activate interactive JavaScript features (5 MB download)\". It is IMHO incredibly disrespectful to activate this mode by default, shoving something down the user's throat he didn't ask for. (Maybe the user is running a slow computer, or e.g. Qubes with lack of nice GPU integration and prefers the simple site because it has all the needed info.)\n Once clicked, a nice download indicator now spins for half a second.\n Boom!!\n The JS parts are now live. Static JPG images (previously rendered on the server) have turned into interactive HTML canvases with websockets support. A text counter that previously required a website refresh is now updating live through websockets. And so on.\n  \nThis is the way. This is the future. This is the only way to stop the web from becoming an increasingly ugly place. (If you don't get it - if you e.g. really believe the new Reddit is better than old.reddit - you're lost and beyond saving IMHO, sorry.)\n    submitted by    /u/NixOverSlicedBread  \n [link]   [comments]",

(In fact, they should mostly work even on text-only browsers.)\n Most \"single page apps\" (SPAs) could easily be ordinary websites that mostly work without JS enabled.\n Most SPAs therefore suck (because of the fact that they are SPAs to begin with).\n Calling Haskell functions it not possible from the standard JS/DOM on an ad-hoc basis, is it? (Only in this way is it possible to enrich a website that mostly works without JS enabled, with certain features in cases where JS is enabled.) Note: Rumors of one or two individuals doing it with some obscure trickery does not count. It should be supported by the ecosystem as a fully fledged feature.\n Therefore, you are confined to SPAs when using Haskell/JS.\n Therefore, Haskell is simply not a suitable language for web development in general and that's just the way it is. (Apps that are legitimately SPAs only are a rare minority and that's not what I'm talking about here.)\n This is precisely where PureScript shines.\n  \nSomeone please debunk the above, because I really would love to be wrong so I could use Haskell for everything.\n    submitted by    /u/NixOverSlicedBread  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi /r/haskell. Almost ten years ago, I wrote a version of the boardgame Yinsh in Haskell. The project included a web-based frontend and a backend for the computer opponent. Everything was running just fine (on my website) until a few weeks ago when Heroku shut down its free tier, where I was hosting the backend.\n Since then, I made multiple unsuccessful attempts to resurrect the game somehow (for example: compiling either the frontend or the backend). The main problem is that I have been developing in other programming languages and ecosystems since then and I'm not familiar with the modern Haskell stack anymore. But it would be sad to rewrite the project in another language. Haskell was actually a really nice fit for this project.\n Back then, I was using Haste to compile Haskell to JavaScript for the frontend part. But now I fail to properly restore the environment to make the hastec call work. Also, I'm not sure if Haste is still actively maintained.\n The backend was 'plain' Haskell, but I have trouble setting up an environment where I can use ghc to compile the backend. I have an old .cabal file that I was apparently using to deploy the backend to Heroku, but it seems that too many things have changed since then.\n I could probably try harder to restore that old state somehow, but I think what the project really needs is some kind of ecosystem modernization. I would be very glad to hear your suggestions on how to move on. If someone is interested in the project itself, I would also love to take contributions on https://github.com/sharkdp/yinsh.\n Yinsh, by the way, is a really fun abstract board game (two player, zero sum, perfect information) which is similar to Gomoku/\"Five-in-a-row\". As far as I know, there is no other implementation of Yinsh out there that features an 'AI' opponent (my implementation uses a classical minimax-style search in the game tree).\n    submitted by    /u/sharkdp  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi all\n As my previous post stated, I am in the process of learning Haskell (mainly from learnyouahaskell.com at the moment).\n I've played around with folds a little in the past when learning Scala, and the learnyouahaskell site is currently introducing them.\n One example it gives is an implementation of the elem function (omitting type declaration):\n  elem' y ys = foldl (\\acc x -> if x == y then True else acc) False ys \n I have implemented it as a pattern matching function (whether from a previous example on the site or just to try it I can't remember):\n  elem' _ [] = False elem' e (x:xs) | e == x = True | otherwise = e `elem'` xs \n I can understand the foldl version no problem, but my question is regarding performance on large lists. Is the foldl version a worse performer if there exists a matching element early in a long list?\n Would it run forever on an infinite list?\n The pattern matching version obviously terminates as soon as it hits a matching element. But the foldl version appears to just \"note\" that there exists an element, but continue checking the rest of the list anyway.\n I understand this is just an example to understand how folds work, and behind the scenes is probably not how the elem function is implemented. I just want to make sure my understanding is correct regarding this fold example. That is, that there is no way to terminate the fold process early.\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/porl  \n [link]   [comments]",

The app also publishes Prometheus metrics using zio-metrics.\n ​\n https://preview.redd.it/bfnvbjd4wzka1.png?width=3508&format=png&auto=webp&s=4b2682ad1602a34f223f0b9171cf559fa078d53c\n The code is at: https://github.com/carlosedp/zio-temporal-hello and I look for feedback and ideas.\n    submitted by    /u/carlosedp  \n [link]   [comments]",

[2] is also good that points out some usages that I was not aware of like case class's copy. [3] and [4] are probably the resources that are closest to my expectation because I am looking for materials that I don't need to rely on third party library, and can build/ design the artifact of my own after learning; however, [3] seemingly is not finished while [4] looks like a starting point.\n So I would like to know if any recommended resources (doc, links, videos, and so on) of such topics that fill in this gap? Or diving the library such as cats is the only way to go? I appreciate any suggestions, and commentary.\n [1]. Functional Design Patterns - Scott Wlaschin\n [2].

          "description": "Hi\n So one year ago I started learning Scala. Because it's a challenge and also because I want to get to know functional programming without hopping immediately into something like Haskell. Keep in mind that my current job and all my skills are within full-stack typescript development. So Scala is definitely something else and that's also why I am so intrigued by the language. \n But now my question is, I kinda want to move away from typescript and go the Scala way. Because I think Scala has much bigger problems to solve and the language is more mature (also because of pay).\n I am hoping to do this one year from now. I am currently learning Cats and have been reading a lot after my working hours. I recently purchased \"The definitive guide\" for Spark, in order to maybe spark an interest in data engineering (see what I did there).\n A lot of co-workers look weird at me when I say I have been learning scala. And they ask me why. And they think it's a waste of time (because \"java is bad\")\n I have been looking at jobs, and I don't see a lot of remote junior scala positions (I will be working from Belgium). As I don't have any JVM experience, I do have a passion for learning. Does this seem possible to all of you or is this a stupid idea? \n Nevertheless, learning this language has never been a stupid idea since it has taught me so much.\n But just wanna get an opinion from some of the pros.\n    submitted by    /u/FuzzCod  \n [link]   [comments]",

What can I do ? What do you suggest ?\n    submitted by    /u/165817566995  \n [link]   [comments]",

I tried recently purescript (haskell like), it made me afraid of purely functional programming, so I though \"why not start with something less rigid ?\". \n 2/ I would like to make native application (specifically CLI tools), and it has a scala-native compiler. \n 3/ I also would like to make GUI apps. Is it doable with scala ? Does using JavaFX and ScalaFX prevent compiling with scala-native, and make my app require the JVM to run ? \n Also, would you consider setting up a reliable development environment for scala simple or complicated ?

          "description": "Lately, I have been thinking of playing with desktop GUI in Scala (I know that \"desktop is dead\", but I am not a fan of Electron and have always been fond of reading about native GUI, so I want to try it out). There are already tools like Skija and JWM which provide a good starting point, but I miss an important feature that a GUI framework should have: the ability to hot reload code, so changes can be seen on the screen quickly.\n I have come across three alternatives so far:\n  \nGoing with a markup language: I could create my own XML-like language or use a template engine to parse the UI and generate components. This approach is used by Gtk, WPF, JavaFX, Avalonia, and others. While this solution is good for simple projects, it becomes annoying for more complex UIs that need to be dynamic. It also seems burdensome to connect all events and signals.\n \nEmbedding an interpreted language, like Graal-js and interoperating with Scala for non-UI code. The downside of this approach is that most of the code would likely be written in JavaScript, kind of defeating the purpose of having a Scala GUI.\n \nJoining forces with other projects like HumbleUI, which already achieves this goal, and bridging them to Scala. The downside again is that HumbleUI is written in Clojure, not Scala. I like the idea of contributing to the success of other projects, but I am not sure if most people will want to deal with a Lisp.\n \n I am wondering how I can achieve this feature. Is a Scalajs-Graaljs-Scala combo worth the complexity? Should I go with a templating engine? Would it be possible to do some Scala hot reloading of the view with Ammonite, and if so, how? Are there any other ways I am missing? I have been asking myself these questions for some time now, but I cannot find the answers on my own.\n Maybe I am spoiled by web development, and hot reloading is not that necessary. What would you like to see in a modern GUI framework to make desktop apps that can compete with Electron ones?\n    submitted by    /u/jmcavanillas  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Org-attach is very useful for embedding images and other files into org headings, especially with the ID flavor, which makes attachment painless. But the hard-coded attachment directory locations creates the real potential for the links to go stale. I think a couple of small additions would go a long way towards hardening org-attach against eventual \"stale ID link syndrome\": \n  \nIt would be very useful to be able to specify the org-attach-id-dir as a file-level setting, ala #+ATTACH-ID-DIR or similar. This would allow you to keep \"separate stores\" of id-based attachments, so you could move them around. You could do this with a relative path for org-attach-id-dir (though see below), but maybe for some documents you want all their attachments in a fixed location (e.g. ~/org/.attachments) but for others you want them \"packaged together\" for portability. Maybe this is already possible? The org docs don't seem to have a single place documenting all the #+CONFIG: val settings that can appear at the top of the file. \n \nAnother related wish which I don't think is yet possible: an option to set org-attach-id-dir based on a locate-dominating-file search. So you could have a structure as below, and all the note's attachments would be stored and live in the top .attachments/ directory. Then you could happily move portable_dir around, send it to colleagues, etc., and attachment links would never go stale.\n \n ​\n  portable_dir/ .attachments/ path1/ notes1.org notes2.org subpath1_1/ subnotes1.org path2/ notes_other.org \n    submitted by    /u/JDRiverRun  \n [link]   [comments]",

My first codeblock contains the header and a \\begin{document}. However, when I do not write \\end{document} into the same codeblock, Emacs appears to not accept the codeblocks end #+end_src and throws an error on running org-babel-tangle. If I include an additional \\end{document} in the first codeblock, all LaTeX codeblocks in my orgfile are recognised as such on tangling and correctly exported. Then, however, I have to go into the generated TeX-file and delete the superfluous \\end{document} from the export of the first block manually. That does not feel right.\n Is there an elegant solution to that problem? In particular, how may I allow a codeblock to be exported properly by org-babel-tangle, even if it contains environments that are not properly closed in the same codeblock?\n PS: As far as I understood from a simple web search, org-export does not deliver what I want without additional setup, as I basically want to write a LaTeX file and manage the org stuff around it without exporting it.\n    submitted by    /u/maniacalradish  \n [link]   [comments]",

But maybe others have experience and suggestions for other tools or workflows.\n As for vocabulary, I think I'd like to do spaced repetition flashcards.

Portability is important to me, as I wanted to be able to send them to friends and family and not have to worry about apps needed to view them. I initially opted to write them in Markdown. Then I became an Emacs user. 🤩 I like the idea of being able to write the recipes in org files and exporting to whatever format convenient for family, like perhaps PDF. Hosting a little website for them might be a neat project for a future date.\n ​\n I installed org-chef, but as far as I can tell, it's meant for scraping recipes from websites. I don't need functionality to adjust proportions, either. Being able to generate a shopping list might be useful someday, but it's not currently something I need to do. I've written a few recipe files in org-mode, but I'm not sure if this is the mode I should be using. I also experimented with using markdown-mode, but wouldn't it be better to write in another mode and export to Markdown? I'd prefer to have the recipes in separate files, rather than one big file, but I'm open to good reasons why I might not want to do that.\n ​\n I'm currently writing them with a few keywords and some tags for metadata. I searched a lot online, here on reddit, as well as asked ChatGPT (it worked well till it gave me a bunch of what seems to be incorrect advice 🫠), about how to create a basic template, but I haven't been able to figure out how to do it on my own. I'm currently using a file that I fill my stuff into and then save with a new name. That works well enough, but it seems to me like there'd be a more elegant way to do it.\n ​\n So, that's where I'm at.

Though I really only want to be able to search for titles and basic tags, so a database sounds like overkill.

          "description": "Hello,\n I have been using org mode for notes but I never used or understood the todo list features.\n Now I am trying to use org for todo lists, but having trouble fitting to my mental model. Maybe it can be configured, or you can tell me why my approach is wrong.\n What I tried is (foolowing tutorials) to make some tags HOME,WORK,then make some project topics in an outline like\n * TODAY ** TODO ask reddit // tag this with @HOME * TOMORROW ** TODO finish that thing * WEEK * SOMETIME * IMPORTANT ... \n ​\n In this view, the tags are \"where\", and the list provides \"what\".I can easily move items from IMPORTANT to TODAY using C-c C-w.I can filter by home or work. Good so far.\n Now, I would like to see an adjenda view that shows at least the TODAY view, and hopefully a view of selected other categories. However, this requires assigning dates. I don't want to do that because dates do not mean much. In fact I rarely need to think about dates. I look at the calendar and note that something is due on \"Wednesday\", not caring about the date.\n a) my TODAY list is a \"goal\" not a contract. Some days I will make a list, then learn of an unexpected task will change everything, with no time to get back to the org mode undil end of day. And most days I find that I do not complete everything on TODAY's list. I want those uncompleted things to automatically carry over to tomorrow's version of \"TODAY\".\n b) I will use a calendar for things that have a particular associated time.\n c) I do not want to waste time deleting dates and adding new dates that mean little,or constantly moving tasks from one date to the next. Just leave them under TODAYuntil either they are done, or I move them to another category like SOMEDAY.\n In short, I think I do not want the calendar features for now, just a todo-list sorted by categories and with a configurable view and hot ckeys.\n Is this possible? Or, what _should_ I be doing?\n Thank you for your advice (and note that I really am a beginner).\n    submitted by    /u/averageblunder  \n [link]   [comments]",

A search of this Reddit forum does not mention this matter either. \n So, I thought I'd ask specifically: Is it true that the Agenda is going to lose its ability to act upon active timestamps in the :PROPERTIES: drawer?\n If true, that would be very unfortunate for me. But I want to be prepared if it happens. I see nothing about this matter in the Release Notes for Org 9.6, so I surmise it's safe for me to upgrade -- for now. \n Many thanks for reading, and to all the Org developers for Org mode, which is a work of genius.\n    submitted by    /u/tdavey  \n [link]   [comments]",

With everything set up, I can confirm that I'm running c++-ts-mode when I open a cc file. However, my previous indentations like c-basic-offset set via c-mode-common-hook are not being honored. How do I control the indentation when c++-ts-mode is enabled? Thanks.\n    submitted by    /u/tsengf  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Inspired by the recent repeat-map discussions (thanks u/karthink), I immediately noticed that rectangle-mark-mode (C-x SPC) was the perfect target for single-key quick bindings. Why? Any time I explicitly activate rectangle-mark-mode, I do so only to call one of the various *-rectangle-* commands next. So why should I remember/type their prefixes? And what's more, I can see that I have this mode active by the region shape & left border.\n Repeat wasn't the right approach, but it was simple to activate a transient map in rectangle-mark-mode-hook. Check this tiny gist. So C-x SPC, highlight your desired rectangle, then [k]ill [d]elete del-[<SPC>] [c]lear [o]pen s[t]ring [w]-copy [y]ank [N]umber. I didn't even know about the (unbound) command delete-whitespace-rectangle, but will use it often now that I don't have to bind/remember it.\n The only thing I wish for is the ability to recall the region of the last marked rectangle (line+col; from, to), for when you'd like to do a series of rect operations in a row on the same columns.\n    submitted by    /u/JDRiverRun  \n [link]   [comments]",

Also, org mode has the option to render LaTeX directly inside the editor instead of having one screen for the editor and another for the rendered output. I guess the bullet point features of org mode are also pretty cool. However, despite all of these cool features, I find when I use emacs I end up wasting a lot of time researching how to do stuff.

          "description": "Hi all, I've released ekg version 0.2. Why it feels like just yesterday I was release ekg version 0.1, and in fact it wasn't that long ago.\n ekg is a note taking application for emacs that stores all data in sqlite, is very tag-oriented, and designed to be easy to extend.\n The changes for version 0.2 are:\n  \nAdded hooks ekg-add-schema-hook, ekg-note-pre-save-hook, ekg-note-save-hook, ekg-note-delete-hook, and ekg-note-add-tag-hook to enable customization.\n New commands ekg-show-notes-latest-captured, =kg-show-notes-latest-modified, for showing notes created or modified recently.\n Introduced variable ekg-notes-size to control the default page size for limited views such as ekg-show-notes-latest-captured.\n Added templating.\n Added embedding as an optional add-on, to enable note similarity and note search; requires an account at OpenAI or similar embedding provider.\n Added new function ekg-active-notes to easily get all non-trashed notes.\n Improved ability to have note list buffers that have flexible titles and operation, notably improving the ekg-show-notes-in-trash command.\n Standardized buffer names for ekg-notes-mode buffers, which all are prepended with \"ekg\" and surrounded by asterisks, to denote that they are non-file-based.\n Added documentation in texinfo, viewable via M-x info.\n Fixed bug interfering with completion at the beginning of the tag property line.\n  \nFor details, watch the demo of 0.2 changes. I think the templating is done via a unique way that shows off the power of ekg, and embedding stuff is advanced, super useful, and virtually no other note app in any system has it. On the other hand, the embeddings costs a very small amount of money and has unfortunate privacy implications. I think it's well worth it, and I hope that you enjoy this update.\n    submitted by    /u/ahyatt  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hear me out here. Before you downvote me, I'm not advocating that any functional changes be made to Emacs regarding car and cdr. I've looked up a brief history of the terms and their origins. They have their uses and should be neither removed nor renamed.\n However, as someone who's only recently learned about these terms, Emacs' self-documentation for these terms was not helpful at all to me. I saw the function being used in existing Elisp and thought, \"What's car and cdr?\" So I looked it up inside Emacs, and it told me that car returned the car of LIST. Wow... super helpful...\n I'd offer to submit a pull request to update the documentation if the source code wasn't managed via email, but it is. So, I'm just putting my opinion out here where someone else who contributes might read this. ``` car is a function defined in C source code.\n Signature (car LIST)\n Documentation Return the car of LIST. If LIST is nil, return nil.\n Error if LIST is not nil and not a cons cell. See also car-safe.\n See Info node (elisp)Cons Cells for a discussion of related basic Lisp concepts such as car, cdr, cons cell and list.\n Other relevant functions are documented in the list group.   cdr is a function defined in C source code.\n Signature (cdr LIST)\n Documentation Return the cdr of LIST. If LIST is nil, return nil.\n Error if LIST is not nil and not a cons cell.

That being said, my output isn't actually giving me the parent node. My output is \n Parent node:#<user-ptr ptr=0x565357826740 finalizer=0x7fcf98715780>, type: modifiers, start: 46, end: 59\n  (defun testing/AST-parent () \"Return parent node of the tree-sitter node at point.\" (interactive) (setq get-parent (tsc-get-parent (tree-sitter-node-at-pos (thing-at-point 'symbol)))) (if get-parent (progn (setq parent-type (tsc-node-type get-parent)) (setq parent-start (tsc-node-start-position get-parent)) (setq parent-end (tsc-node-end-position get-parent)) (message \"Parent node:%s, type: %s, start: %s, end: %s\" get-parent parent-type parent-start parent-end)) (message \"No parent node\"))) \n Edit 2: Solved it! Below is the code that will get the parent node of the node under the cursor. If anyone more knowledgeable on tree-sitter has a better idea to solve this then I'm all ears, but for now this is what I got: \n ``` (defun testing/AST-parent () \"Return parent node of the tree-sitter node at point.\" (interactive) (let ((node (tree-sitter-node-at-pos))) (if node (message \"%s\" (tsc-node-type (tsc-get-parent (tsc-get-parent node)))) (message \"No parent node at point\"))))\n ```\n    submitted by    /u/Hercislife23  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Curious as to how I can do this better.\n I'm using a Windows client to access various headless, Linux-based development servers. In many cases I want to edit a file on the remote server, using Emacs.\n Currently, I have just been using SSH (PuTTY) with X11 forwarding enabled. I simply SSH to my target, open the file, and voila Emacs is drawn on my local/Windows client. When I'm on the same local network as the development servers, this works fine.\n When I'm connecting remotely (VPN), oftentimes a much slower connection, this can get a little ugly. It works, yes, but can be painfully slow. For example, hitting page up inside Emacs may take a couple of seconds to draw. This creates the need for some very delicate typing/selecting of text.\n How can I improve this setup? I have started to research emacsclient (to run in Windows) to potentially connect to Emacs on the Linux side (running in daemon mode), but I'm not sure that this is actually the correct approach. It doesn't totally make sense to me, as the file I'm trying to open is located on the daemon/Linux side (not Windows).

Since I want to use emacs as an IDE, I want to install eglot for the LSP client and company to have a better completion UI. I went with eglot over lsp mode because I have previously used lsp mode and it seemed slow. Plus, eglot is shipping with emacs 29 by default, which means it is good enough to be included in emacs, so I might as well use it.\n Anyway, I do the typical thing. M-x package-install RET eglot RET. Gets installed from elpa as expected. Same with company: M-x package-install RET company RET. They both work, all is good, but upon restarting, they're not longer there.\n After some head scratching I realized they are not being initialized. After running package-initialize they both work again. If I add that same function to the end of my init.el, then it works. But why? The package-enable-at-startup variable is set to true, as it should.\n Here's my config, it's not very big.\n Also as an extra. Anyway to move the eln-cache folder? Thanks.\n EDIT: I know the packages.el file isn't being loaded. That's fine, I'm not done with it yet.

For example :bind automatically defers a package.\n (use-package ef-themes :init (load-theme 'ef-summer t) :bind (\"<f9>\" . ef-themes-select)) \n If I wouldn't use :init in this situation, the theme wouldn't load until F9 is pressed.\n Please correct me if I'm wrong.

But I am now thinking of transitioning my note taking on a tablet or iPad where I can type and draw to take notes. But unfortunately I can't use emacs on this and converting my notes is also a hassle. I was looking at other posts comparing emacs to obsidian and logseq, but they always go on tangents and talk about how emacs can do so much more rather than simply focusing on the note taking aspect between emacs and the other applications. So I am uncertain about emacs capabilities just for note taking with tablets and iPads. I was wondering if anyone uses a tablet for their note taking and how they integrate it quickly into their org roam? Or is this best left for obsidian which has an app on the tablet?\n Currently I'm thinking I take notes in obsidian in tablet/iPad which automatically syncs to my computer where I have a script running to convert it to org.

Simply a note-taking solution that allow FULL Emacs/org-mode features but out of a flexible solution that allow dynamic result buffers out of queries, like notmuch/mu for emails, like ekg for notes and so on, because while text is super flexible is still also limiting in some aspects.\n The purpose of this post is reiterate this long running not so accepted but definitively felt topic on notes seeing the regular evolution of tools who try to be kind-of query-driven (like search&narrow vs menus/taxonomies) and periodically fail to complete the game. I hope a day enough people would accept such storage concept and we will finally see an Emacs-based storage who is actually a kind of DB directly managed in Emacs, with of the flexibility of a DB and the power of elisp.

I've recently tried out Emacs and enjoyed it a lot, but I can't seem to get my color scheme working, no matter the many different methods I use.Before, in Vim, I set it to use my terminal(st) colors, and I was very happy with that. A picture of what a .cpp file looks like is below.\n https://i.imgur.com/C3R6Ikv.png\n I use Emacs Gui mode, and I was looking to use these terminal colors, but I can't find a way to port the Vim colors over(even though they are terminal colors). I've tried creating my own Emacs color scheme(using autothemer), but the lack of faces for some things prevent me from fully creating the theme, and my lack of knowledge about Emacs Lisp is hindering me as well.\n I'm not sure how st(suckless terminal) and/or Vim uses the colors specified in the st config, but I think it is Xresources-related. Below is a picture of the 16 colors I use in my st config.\n I am considering porting this over to Vim(as these seem to be somewhat general) and then to Emacs, but again, I have no idea how these colors are used and applied.\n https://i.imgur.com/FAEcuer.png\n (I can't remember when I made the theme, but I believe it was based on something online, but I'm not sure how prevalent it is)\n In the end, any pointers on how to implement this theme in Emacs or anything about the way st uses these colors will help greatly(or any other places I should cross-post this in).

The device is offline, so Emacs will store this modified file for later and save it whenever it is possible.\n This is basically synchronization but done on Emacs, i guess.

The library uses svg-lib so you can use icons from various online collections supported by it. Under the hood it has tiny daemon, written in C that interacts with system tray via libappindicator. So, at least for now, the only supported OS is Linux.\n I planned to keep minor modes in separate repo - Emacs Appindicator Modes. For now there is only icon for pomm.el , but I plan to add more useful packages soon.\n I will be glad to hear your thoughts about package.

Rather than repeating that command four times to go four words forward, you can turn that into a holymotion/easymotion, and press a single, home-row character, and jump straight there. For those familiar with Avy, it’s much the same(and uses avy under the hood), but generalized to work with any movement command, and the ability to restrict the scope of an avy motion to look only within some lisp object, like a buffer, a sentence, or a line.

          "description": "Nothing but anecdotal data, but when a newcomer is faced with a choice between Emacs or Vscode, they will very likely choose Vscode, one of the reasons being that Emacs has a rightful reputation of having a steep learning curve. The idea of having to install a dozen packages to get modern IDE-like features and write Elisp right away in order to customize them can be daunting and overwhelming. Personally, it took me a couple of years before I even bothered to start learning Elisp to become a more advanced user.\n By providing a more streamlined and user-friendly way to customize Emacs, we can help make the platform more approachable and welcoming to new users.\n One approach could be to provide a series of customizable templates or configurations that new users could choose from when first setting up Emacs. These templates could be designed for different use cases (e.g., programming, writing, project management, etc.), and could include pre-installed packages, keybindings, and other customizations that are tailored to the user's needs. This would allow new users to get started with a powerful and customized Emacs setup without having to dive too deeply into the details of Elisp code.\n Another approach could be to provide a more user-friendly interface for customizing Emacs, such as a graphical user interface (GUI) or a set of interactive prompts that guide users through the customization process. This would make it easier for users to discover and experiment with different customization options, and would help them feel more confident and in control of their Emacs setup.\n I think we need to put some work and effort on this.\n    submitted by    /u/80286  \n [link]   [comments]",

(This is not dissimilar to any other interpreted language with code and REPL separated.) Again, Babel should offer both in the same buffer. Unfortunately something like child(jane, fred). is a database…",

I am used to use a standard keyboard and my palm to press <Ctrl> but this clearly doesn't work here. \n How do you type on keyboards like this? Did you change your typing habits? How do you use <Ctrl> and <Alt> on the right side next to the arrow block? What fingers do you use to press them? Do you change the keyboard or command map?\n Any hint and experience is welcomed.\n    submitted by    /u/nextlittleowl  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Over the last couple weeks while putting the treesit-auto package together it gained adoption much faster than I had expected. While I'm incredibly happy others found it useful, that also means that many assumptions in my hacky code were quickly blown apart. Also, in no small part due to my poor documentation, it was confusing to figure out exactly how/what would be supported when trying to add a new language.\n The key learning since I first tried to launch this package is that there's no reason for the grammar name in grammar.js to match the Emacs major mode, and there's a possibility that there are many \"fallback\" modes that should upgrade to the tree-sitter version, rather than just one. For these reasons and more, I needed to adjust the structure of how these modes are described internally alongside their grammars. As a consequence to that, some of the public functions/variables have been changed or removed. \n I am sorry to anyone who has already picked up the package and started tweaking it. However, I think the changes will make the package more maintainable down the line, and it’s better to do this sooner rather than later. Most folks will probably not notice a difference if all you have set is treesit-auto-install and global-treesit-auto-mode. \n Hopefully this is the last post I will need/want to to make about the package!\n TL;DR\n treesit-auto-fallback-alist no longer has any affect. If you want another language to be supported by treesit-auto, there is now a guide for contributing recipes\n    submitted by    /u/renzmann  \n [link]   [comments]",

I did run into something today that was a puzzle--I knew I'd taken a note on a topic, couldn't find it easily and didn't have access to my home machine. My thought: I'd be fine if I could search everything for the word 'awk'.\n I'm thinking the following would be elegant:\n  \nIndex the notes generated by org-publish using sqlite's FTS5 capability.\n Add a search field to the generated sitemap.\n Update the publishing script to copy the indexed database along with the notes.\n Write a CGI to handle the searches and link to search results.\n  \nMinus the CGI part it was stupidly easy to get indexing with stemming working:\n #!/bin/sh sqlite3 t.db<<EOF CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE notes USING FTS5(title, body, tokenize=porter); EOF for file in $(ls *html | grep -v sitemap) do data=$(cat $file | sed \"s/'/''/g\") sqlite3 t.db<<EOF INSERT INTO notes(title, body) VALUES('$file','$data'); EOF done \n I did run into one ugly that I need an elegant idea to help solve--indexing the generated HTML leads to poor search results (e.g. searching for `awk' finds every note due to the export language boilerplate). I've had the following thoughts:\n  \nindex the org files. Downside: this will pickup the #* lines which works poorly for some searches (e.g. session).\n use an HTML parser (e.g. Beautiful Soup) and carve content out of the generated files. Intuitively, this seems like it would be brittle.\n publish to text as well, index those and associate the results with its HTML counterpart.\n use some combinations of org-export filters to index the content.\n  \nAs an aside, I realize there are services for this but there's no fun in that.\n    submitted by    /u/fragbot2  \n [link]   [comments]",

I've found the minibuffer-line-mode package and this displays my global-mode-string in the minibuffer area, which is great in 95% of the time. However, sometimes there is important information displayed in the minibuffer that is too fast overridden by minibuffer-line-mode. The cases are rare enough, that I don't have an example right now. But when it happens, it's super annoying.\n So using the minibuffer is maybe not the best option here. So I'm wondering if it's possible to display global-mode-string right-aligned in the menu bar?

The problem is, this means I'm not using it every day and therefore I'm not really getting past that early pain while you learn shortcuts/commands. It's almost like I'm starting from scratch every time I use it. Every simple action requires looking through a cheat sheet or doing a web search.\n I know that Emacs isn't supposed to be used in a mainly mouse driven way and many will say that half the point is all the powerful shortcuts that will, eventually, improve productivity. I'm just never getting past the early pain and I'd like something with more menus and more mouse driven support, but still all the features and extensibility of Emacs.\n I'm not looking to switch from my IDE for the heavier stuff, although that would probably help me get over the learning pain, but I've already done that with the IDE and don't want to give that up.\n I did see mousemacs and I really hoped it would be the solution I was looking for, but it seems a little buggy and actually makes things more complicated to use - not less.\n Can anyone suggest either an Emacs alike that fits my needs or a simple way to setup Emacs in this way?\n Edit: Specifically, what I want to be able to do is much of the every day stuff via menus. Either context menus or menu bar menus. I want to be able to list buffers and switch/remove to them. I want to be able to access the customisation via a menu - especially themes and packages. Also - ideally package specific commands as well as being able to assign various commands to a custom menu.\n    submitted by    /u/tobomori  \n [link]   [comments]",

As a matter of fact, the message appears even before that when the region gets expanded to the first non-ASCII character and the later kill-ring-save is failing when kill-new is invoked within its definition.\n Good case: I mark a region like \"foo bar\" and am able to push it into the clipboard by invoking M-w as usual. Perfect. No issue with marking the region or pushing to the clipboard.\n Error case: However, when I try to create a region with \"foo€\" or \"fooä\" or \"fooß\" or \"foo¼\" I get the weird behavior described above as soon as the first non-ASCII character gets added to the region and the clipboard doesn't get any new content pushed to when I do try to kill.\n I'm not sure if this is related: when the region gets defined by pressing C-SPC and then expanded by right-char I also get \"Replaced 0 occurrences\" with every new invocation. This is suspicious as well. Maybe they both are related? \n With emacs -q, there is always normal behavior (good case) without the error message. So it has to be related to my configuration.\n The same configuration using Emacs 27.1 also does not have this weird behavior. \n How can I debug this? Does this sound familiar to you? Do you have an idea what that might cause? \n My config is rather hard to impossible to bi-sect with a sane effort. :-(\n    submitted by    /u/publicvoit  \n [link]   [comments]",

In digging into this work, I've found read some fascinating stuff from people who strongly believe in and/or participate in this kind of research. Their first-hand testimony is going to be valuable for some of the world-building and plot development I want to do in my speculative fiction.\nNow, I want to track this information in my zettelkasten. But I also feel some small anxiety that I'll be \"polluting\" my notes with some of this stuff. I'm curious about how others who do this kind of research handle materials that would not be the kind of thing you'd espouse yourself, but something you want to keep a record of for some other purpose.\nSecond: do you keep biographical information in your zettelkasten? In this same case, I've encountered a few recurring names that I would like to track. While my novel's not going to be based whole cloth on any of these figures, I am drawing some inspiration from real life programs and work and events. My initial thought is to create a structure note related to the individual that I might put a smattering of biographical information in that can then spin off into some specifics about their life and work that matters to me. But again, curious about how others have handled this.",

Before my time here on the forums, @ctietze mentioned Weinberg back in Feb of 2018 - Writing with the Zettelkasten is like building a fieldstone wall and Gerald Weinberg was brought up again by @chrisaldrich back in October - Review of “On Intellectual Craftsmanship” (1952) by C.

          "description": "Yesterday, I watched a talk by Tony Buzan at Poland's SWPS University, which I came across on YouTube, reminding me of the importance of colour in understanding and recall.\nWhilst at school several decades ago, I became very keen on Tony Buzan's methods popularised by his 1974 BBC television series Use Your Head, in which he encouraged people to use colourful mindmaps and speedreading, among other techniques, to better understand and remember anything they were studying.  At the time, I was a failing student.  So, even though most students and staff saw his techniques as weird, I decided to give them ago.  To my astonishment, by applying just a couple of his key techniques, I quickly started getting top marks and with less effort.  So, I have no doubt Tony's methods have merit.\nIt would therefore be beneficial to introduce coloured text into The Archive app by using some simple markup code.\nEven a limited pallet would be helpful, perhaps just red, green and blue, although the more colours, the better.  Something like <r>for red text</r>, <b>for blue text</b>, etc., would be enough.  But hex codes would allow for a more extensive pallet.\nWould coloured text in The Archive app be possible?\nTony Buzan's talk at SWPS University can be seen here:  https://youtu.be/QEokHNWf-Qg.\nAnd his 1974 BBC television series Use Your Head, is available here: https://youtu.be/EgG8GuQHHIs.",

Slow productivity is a combination of incremental work and tangential work. It is incremental because it is made of micro-actions accumulating over time. Tangential, in the sense that it sometimes is work or play that seems unrelated but actually moves the needle forward. A walk in the woods might be an example of tangential productivity.\nWriting has taken priority. My course assignment is to write a creative non-fiction essay modeled after the works we discussed in class. My Zk has been a joyous and surprising resource for ideas. I'm using my ZK by creating search queries and using the highlighting feature to find where I've already written answers to the query in my own voice. They become snippets directly into my essay. In a sense, I've already written my essay. I just have to find all the pieces and put them together. In truth, this is only a first draft and still needs work.\nWhat I've found to be key steps to creating a rough draft.\n—\nMy review routine has again surfaced something wonderful in my ZK. I had no idea I was curating ideas on the value of practice. I started a secondary hub with 18 entries, hung off of the main hub titled The Art Of Living A Good Life [[202105102006]]. \n\n  \nBasic learning preps. What am I doing that is practice? How else do I expect to improve unless I practice? The best continue practicing even after achieving success to push themselves, not become complacent, and reach new heights.

When I clicked on this to correct it I was linked to an empty search (because TA thought it was a tag), and when I went back to the main page my document was gone. The file still exists in the Finder but it's empty. What the heck happened?\nThankfully I had a backup of this document in my Apple Notes app (but without the annotations the Archive version had...) but it's scary that a document can just disappear like that due to malformatted tags. I still have The Archive open, so I can force it to generate whatever logs could help debug this issue. For the time being I'm going to move to Notes until I'm done studying for my exam.",

Occasionally, I will write add hypothesis to it. I will add an example to show what I mean.\nIf my notes on this matter reach a level that is worth publishing I will bring everything together to a document that will be available as donationware.\nIf you have any case study, successful interaction or failure or thoughts in general, I'd be happy if you share it.\nLive long and prosper\nSascha",
