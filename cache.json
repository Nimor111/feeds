I was reading Learn You a Haskell and stumbled across this operator -: here, \n  \nHaskell ghci> landLeft 2 (landRight 1 (landLeft 1 (0,0))) (3,1)  When we apply the function landLeft 1 to (0,0) we get (1,0). Then, we land a bird on the right side, resulting in (1,1). Finally two birds land on the left side, resulting in (3,1). We apply a function to something by first writing the function and then writing its parameter, but here it would be better if the pole went first and then the landing function. If we make a function like this: haskell x -: f = f x  We can apply functions by first writing the parameter and then the function: haskell ghci> 100 -: (*3) 300 ghci> True -: not False ghci> (0,0) -: landLeft 2 (2,0)  By using this, we can repeatedly land birds on the pole in a more readable manner: haskell ghci> (0,0) -: landLeft 1 -: landRight 1 -: landLeft 2 (3,1) \n  \naccording to my expert research at this point in time there was no pipe operator in Haskell, so I looked up and found this page.\n here two operators are mentioned -: and :-, used together, could allow us also use expression in infix notation, instead of just functions.\n I checked in ghci and there are no such operators available. are these old operators that were removed? what's their story?\n    submitted by    /u/_hammi  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I am writing a big calculator. This calculator has many, many inputs and many, many outputs. My fundamental type is a Partner. Conceptually it makes sense to associate both inputs and outputs with a Partner. Also, some of the outputs are both important on their own and as inputs to later parts of the calculation.\n My question is: how do I architect this in Haskell? I can imagine having a big Partner record type that has a field for each input and each output. The downside of this is I'd have to initialize it with empty values for all the outputs. Would I then make those a Maybe type? That might get annoying.\n Do I instead define a separate type for each new output as it's calculated? Say we start with just a PartnerInput object that only holds the inputs. Then we calculate the first output and put the result in a PartnerInputAndFirstOutput object. I.e. the first function has type PartnerInput -> PartnerInputAndFirstOutput. Then the next function has type PartnerInputAndFirstOutput -> PartnerInputAndSecondOutput, and so on. Intuitively this feels silly.\n Like any good Haskeller I want to use the type system to help guarantee the correctness of my code, but I can't figure out how in this case.

          "description": "In writing a bit of haskell, I've come across this problem more than once. Consider the following example: \n {-# LANGUAGE GADTSyntax #-} import Data.Kind (Type) data Foo :: Type where Bar1 :: {f :: String, g :: Integer} -> Foo Bar2 :: {f :: String, g :: Integer, h :: Double, l :: Double} -> Foo deriving (Eq) \n ​\n Bar1 and Bar2 have a common \"core\" (f and g), but Bar2 extends on it by adding the fields h and l. In the way I see it, it makes functions that deal with Foo a little more of a hassle to write, since the fields f and h wouldn't be total for all values of Foo, making me resort to the Either and/or Maybe monads. \n One way to avoid this would be turning Foo into a typeclass that abstract the common features of Bar1 and Bar2 and turning Bar1 and Bar2 themselves into types.\n The downside would be that I wouldn't be able to use pattern matching as easily and it would be harder to rely on the compiler to tell me when functions don't deal with all the possible values in the domain of Foo. Also, things that I could do to both constructors at once (like deriving an Ord instance for both of them) would be alot more verbose to do. And, if I decided to collect them in some sort of list, I would have to deal with heterogeneously typed lists.\n ​\n Anyway, maybe this is too much of a beginner question, but I'd like to hear from you possible ideas to solve this.\n    submitted by    /u/ComunistCapybara  \n [link]   [comments]",

In particular, the Curry-Howard isomorphism really caught my interest, but I need help to know if I'm getting it correctly. What I've understood is that we can prove mathematical theorems through CH, for example to prove that a * 1 = a we just need to show that there is an isomorphism (hence, 2 functions that are one the inverse of the other) between (a, ()) and a. This gave me chills, so I wanted to try this way of reasoning with a theorem for natural numbers, but I'm stuck. In particular, I would like to prove that given two natural numbers m,n the GCD of m,n is the same as the GCD of (m mod n) and n. Again, here there is an equality so I think I would have to show there is an isomorphism between the two things. But I can't really imagine how to translate something like that in Haskell, and I'm not even sure if this is actually possible.\n P.S. As a side note, I also wanted to prove that there is no isomorphism between a set X and its power set, but imagining to prove that something doesn't exist with CH is even more complicated for me.\n    submitted by    /u/asshole_books_nerd  \n [link]   [comments]",

I've completed two or three beginner-level books, but I still find it challenging to write full-fledged Haskell apps. Simultaneously, I've been dabbling a bit with Rust.\n My dilemma is that I lack sufficient experience and a deep understanding of the philosophies of these two languages to make an informed choice on where to invest my time. I've tried both, but I feel that I won't be able to make an effective comparison without creating a larger project in each (for which currently I have no time unfortunately).\n I'm love Haskell's purity, abstractions, and expressiveness and at the same time I find memory management in Rust to be a bit of a pain. However I've noticed many people transitioning from Haskell to Rust, and that Rust ecosystem is much more lively and it's causing me to wonder if Haskell is slowly falling out of favor.\n The response I've seen several times is that Haskell is worth it for it's educational aspect, but I'm interested in more practical side of things. Is there anybody who thinks that Haskell is better then Rust for real world applications?\n From my current perspective, Rust doesn't seem like a direct replacement for Haskell. I'm not sure how to incorporate the functional style I love into Rust. Could this just be a lack of expertise on my part? Would I eventually be able to write Rust in a way that captures what I like about Haskell?\n I'm aware this topic has been discussed many times in various forums, but I still can't shake the feeling that focusing on Haskell might not be a worthwhile investment. Would it be more reasonable to spend time gaining a deeper understanding of Rust?\n Any insights from those with broader experience in both languages would be greatly appreciated.\n    submitted by    /u/Only-Stable-3126  \n [link]   [comments]",

Asking on this sub because it has lots of people who probably know a lot about type theory.\n It seems to me that in Smalltalk, Common Lisp, and other languages that treats classes as objects at runtime, we basically get all three things one can get in lambda cube. A message to create a subclass is a type dependent on type; all generic functions/messages are terms dependent on type; to achieve type dependent on term we basically just write a method that calls type constructors based on input term. Essentially, by treating types (classes) as runtime values (objects), we basically make them first class and get everything from reflection. If one doesn't like nominal subtyping, we can also achieve similar expressive power by supporting \"algebraic classes\" at runtime.\n Given that there are so many research into making more expressive type systems, I suppose that there’s probably a lot of other things that I haven’t thought about. Other than guaranteeing termination or improving performance of programs, what are some benefits of a powerful static type system over the runtime first class type approach I mentioned above?\n    submitted by    /u/ghc--  \n [link]   [comments]",

I recently pushed out a new version of one and was startled to see the difference in binary size, despite building them all exactly the same way:\n  \nLinux: 23.8 MB\n Mac: 9 MB\n Windows: 37.8 MB\n  \nCrazy! Can anyone help me understand what's going on here? I assume they're all statically linked.\n Oh, and to be clear: this isn't a problem for me. I don't really care about binary size in this case. I'm just very curious!\n By the way, this is the tool. And here's its package.yaml, if that matters.

Functor f => (s -> a) -> (s -> a -> s) -> (a -> f a) -> s -> f s lens getterFunc setterFunc sa s = setterFunc s <$> sa (getterFunc s) \n where sa :: (a -> f a) and s :: s seem to appear out of nowhere on the left hand side.\n EDIT2: Now given the expanded type signature this is more apparent and this one is also now solved for me!\n  \nI now have a new issue:\n The type of most lens functions (getter, setter, traversal) tends to look like\n haskell type Getter/Setter s a = Functor/Applicative f => (a -> f a) -> (s -> f s)  which, in the case of getters apparently is equivalent to s -> a but not in the case of setters.\n In this case a getter can be a function that has a function of (a -> f a) and a parameter s and this should return an f s so I'm not sure how we get s -> a here.\n Can anyone help explain this to me?\n EDITS: Sorry for the edits, posted on reddit too and slowly working things out at the same time.\n    submitted by    /u/tobz619  \n [link]   [comments]",

I know ghci is a Haskell interpreter (or interactive Haskell program), ghc is the compiler and I have no clue what cabal is\n I would really appreciate it if someone would familiarize me with all the vocab/tools and recommend me how to install Haskell.\n I'm a python programmer and I use conda a lot, I looked up and found ghc available as a package on coda. I would prefer if I could install ghci and Haskell's package manager (if there is one? idk) through condaas well.\n any other advice is also appreciated\n    submitted by    /u/_hammi  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm particularly interested in integration tests, as it's harder to spot unintended interactions between the many functions that make up the algorithm than it is to spot bugs in a single function in isolation.\n I'm familiar with the QuickCheck paper, and I typically test functions by randomly generating test cases and, where possible, testing properties. The constraints that my rebalancer enforces define a set of properties that are easy to test, but they are not sufficient to guarantee optimality.

PrintTest constructor of TestOutput now has an extra field used to report progress. Supply const (pure ()) as this extra field value if you want to skip progress reporting (#311).\n foldGroup now takes [b] instead of b as its last argument to allow for custom fold strategies. This is a backwards incompatible change, but you can get the old behavior by applying mconcat (#364).\n Dependency loop error now lists all test cases that formed a cycle (#340).\n Dependencies can now be defined pattern-free with sequentialTestGroup (#343).\n Added --min-duration-to-report flag that specifies the time a test must take before tasty outputs timing information (#341).\n When a test failed with an exception, print it using displayException instead of show (#330).\n The -p/--pattern option can be specified multiple times; only tests that match all patterns are run (#380).\n Fix color scheme to make info messages visible in terminals with white background (#369).\n When parsing of a command-line option failed, report received option (#368).\n Support WASM (#365).\n  \nYou can give it a try using the following cabal.project:\n packages: . packages: https://hackage.haskell.org/package/tasty-1.5/candidate/tasty-1.5.tar.gz https://hackage.haskell.org/package/tasty-hunit-0.10.1/candidate/tasty-hunit-0.10.1.tar.gz https://hackage.haskell.org/package/tasty-quickcheck-0.10.3/candidate/tasty-quickcheck-0.10.3.tar.gz https://hackage.haskell.org/package/tasty-bench-0.3.5/candidate/tasty-bench-0.3.5.tar.gz https://hackage.haskell.org/package/tasty-rerun-1.1.19/candidate/tasty-rerun-1.1.19.tar.gz \n If all goes well, the release is scheduled for mid September.\n    submitted by    /u/Bodigrim  \n [link]   [comments]",

Let's say you have this very simple game, at the start you can choose how many players can play, they choose their name, the deck is shuffled, the players are put in a circular queue and the game begins. To play, simply write the card you want taken out of the pool in the order chosen. The game loop ends when no cards are left in the pool. How would you design something like this? How would you add on top?

They were all awesome!\n I spent few hours checking the job market for Scala jobs in Data Engineering (I'm a Data Engineer). But daaaaaaamn I really thought Scala/Spark was way more a thing! It's really all PySpark now. What a disappointment 😢 Especially with Scala 3, honestly any data engineer who knows Python could easily write Spark job in Scala. \n Hard to find the motivation to keep learning FP in Scala when the Scala opportunities are so limited. I guess it will teach me FP so that's good. But there's a depressing vibe to it.\n I guess only very big tech companies or banks or companies still relying on a on-premise infra may still use Scala.\n    submitted by    /u/yinshangyi  \n [link]   [comments]",

When using OCaml, this library is great: https://github.com/darioteixeira/pgocaml\n It uses a PPX macro which reads the raw SQL string before compilation and asks Postgres server for the data type which will be returned when the SQL would actually be executed. This way OCaml knows the return type of each SQL query even if they are just pure SQL.\n Is there anything similar for Scala?

Even once I found a 3rd party library it wasn't 1-to-1 compatible tojava.time (for example had a different set of ZoneIds). It took some digging and trial and error (and testing stuff in run-time because these were Java dependencies).\n This experience got me thinking what else is in common use that should become part of the Scala API to be JVM agnostic? There's a sentiment lately that Scala shouldn't rely strictly on the JVM (can be seen here and there in the comments, JdG wrote about it) so perhaps making a standard for common APIs would help porters target only Scala and not create Java shims to the entire Java API.\n    submitted by    /u/codecatmitzi  \n [link]   [comments]",

I know the typelevel stack and can write/read Scala without a problem. Played around with Spark, Actors, and Akka HTTP too, so I guess I can orient myself in the ecosystem on what does what. I also have a bachelor's degree in tech/design.\n I read here that you shouldn't learn Scala because finding a job is very unlikely in some countries. So I knew beforehand, anyways I started my job hunt in Belgium. It has to be a permanent job and not too far away (1 hour 20min drive will do) or fully remote.\n So far I have found 3 companies: one paused the hiring, the other one only had one backend developer with 2 years of experience, and the last one I received no email, but they did view my LinkedIn.\n Either I become a data engineer and maybe I'll have another 5 companies I can apply to and will probably get no answer since I don't have a relevant master's degree or relevant experience. Or I start doing something else.\n Scala made me a better developer and taught me a lot so no regrets there. But what's the next best step forward? Should I get a job in Java (never written Java before) which will in the future improve my chances of landing a Scala position? Or should I hop on the Golang hype train? Of course, this greatly depends on the country. Here in my country, it is mainly .NET, Java, and Typescript. \n There surely have been others of you that experienced this, What did you do?\n    submitted by    /u/FuzzCod  \n [link]   [comments]",

I',m now moving away from Slick for one of my projects and using doobie and this hits me hard as the latest doobie version 1.0-RC4 depends on cats-effect 3 and Monix lacks support for it and I cannot proceed any further beyond compilation failure.\n The goal is for me to move away from Slick and use some other library. I considered doobie and it seems not a wise option as it causes compatibilities with Monix. Is there any other alternatives? I'm considering using quill. But it is unfortunate that there is no active development happening on Monix these days. It is such an awesome library.\n    submitted by    /u/CaterpillarPrevious2  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Crosspost of:\n https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/16gzmmi/orgwindowhabit_an_alternative_habit_system_based/?sort=new\n I've always found that the built in habit tracking provided by org-mode that is based on repeaters is less than ideal for capturing anything other than the notion of repeating something at some fixed interval (typically daily).\n The way that I think most people think about non-daily habits is that they ought to be completed some number of times within a certain window. For example, you might set the goal of doing some form of cardiovascular exercise at least 4 times a week.\n org-window-habit Allows you to do exactly this. Instead of relying on org repeaters (or even the habit flavored org repeaters), it uses properties from the org drawer to understand the constraints the user would like to have around their habit. To explain how this is useful, I'll return to the 4 days a week example from above. If you wanted to give yourself some leeway within an individual week (life happens), but still wanted to ensure that in the long term you are conforming to your goal of 4 repetitions a week, you might do something like specify a short term window where 3 repetitions are required in a single week, but 16 repetitions are required within any 4 week period. This would allow you to require that you're never completely falling off the wagon with your habit, but also that you can do a bit of makeup/slowdown, as long as you are roughly hitting your goal when you zoom out enough.\n For more details, take a look at the README, but also be aware that even more customization is available (take a look at the source code if you are so inclined). If it seems that people in the community are interested in this sort of habit tracking I'm happy to document even more details about how this package works, but at this point, I want to evaluate whether or not people are interested in using it before I put more work into it.\n    submitted by    /u/IvanMalison  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello,\n I wrote the following piece of code to derive a headline from property values. Ideally, I would just replace the text of the title, and leave the other properties (todo, priority, tags) in place. \n The code below instead rebuilds the whole headline by first gathering the properties, building a new title string, and then re-inserting it in the buffer.\n I am wondering if there is a simpler/smarter way\n  (save-excursion (org-back-to-heading t) (let* ((point (point)) (todo (org-entry-get point \"TODO\")) (priority (org-entry-get point \"PRIORITY\")) (tags (org-entry-get point \"TAGS\")) (title (concat (make-string (org-outline-level) ?*) \" \" (cl-destructuring-bind (title-comps title-format) (mv/org-get-title-info) (mv/format-section-title title-format (mv/org-collect-section-properties% title-comps point)))))) (delete-region (point) (line-end-position)) (insert title) (when tags (org-set-tags tags)) (when todo (let ((current-prefix-arg 0)) (org-todo todo))) (unless (char-equal (aref priority 0) org-default-priority) (org-priority priority)))) \n What the code is doing, is as follows\n  \nExtract todo, priority, tag info\n Build the new title along with leading `*` \n Delete the title line, and insert the new one\n Re-assign todo, priority and tags.\n  \nIt is working so-so. Still has rough edges.\n My question is: Does org.el have code that will allow me to replace the title in place? I could define my own regexp to do it. But maybe there is existing plumbing already in place.\n Thanks,\n    submitted by    /u/mirkov19  \n [link]   [comments]",

This has happened 3 or 4 times in the past month and it is driving me insane\n Today I went to add to my org journal and all the TODOs from the previous day were gone. Moreover, the previous day's journal file was automatically deleted. Luckily I was able to open up a buffer with the same file name and spam undo, and my research journal luckily was cached and restored.\n I am hoping you all can help me with the following issues:\n  \nHow do I avoid the auto-deletion of old content when rolling tasks forward? I'm okay with some redundancy/bloat in my filesystem if it ensures that I don't lose day's worth of work/my healthy todo list\n \nIs this just user error?

          "description": "i'm taking math notes in (doom) emacs org-mode, but all my notes look really bad because they're not formatted in LaTeX. Is there a way to just casually write LaTeX directly into the org file to make the notes look nicer without having to make a whole other .tex file? I've installed all the necessary packages for LaTeX and I've used C-c C-x C-l to preview the LaTeX, but the LaTeX gets unformatted everytime I close and open the file again. Also, I don't want to have to press those keys everytime i want to preview the LaTeX. Is there a way to write the LaTeX and have it auto-format instantaneously? I've tried org-fragtog, but it doesn't seem to work. Sorry if I am a bit unclear as I am completely new to LaTeX and also pretty new to emacs.\n    submitted by    /u/dangdrjay  \n [link]   [comments]",

Is there a better way, preferably using an Emacs or org-mode feature?\n In some cases where the field content is short, I've gotten away with using a table.

          "description": "Hi,\n I use org-roam and regularly use org-attach to add clippings or even as a save location for babel file outputs (e.g., generating a diagram or figure).\n I'm also a bit naughty, and don't always keep my files entirely atomic. Such that I quite often will retrospectively org-store-link on a heading, assigning it a new ID. But when I do this, any attachments in that section now break, as the results of (org-attach-dir) now are generated from the new ID, not the file-level one. I also generally like the idea of having a single (org-attach-dir) per file; but also to have that (org-attach-dir) be based on the file ID. \n Is there a way to have (org-attach-dir) use the root/file-level ID for generating its file path? \n Thank you very much for any advice.\n ​\n Notes:\n I've looked through the archives, with some related posts found but which don't quite match my needs.\n  \nQuestion on setting up org-attach folder per file. :: I'd still like to automatically generate from ID\n How to enable org-mode to search attachment in parent header's attachment folder :: this seems to be my question! But there wasn't any satisfactory answer at the time. tag u/shelper9527 \n  \nI've tried to set the DIR property to the value of (org-attach-dir) at the root, but I don't think its possible to dynamically set properties like this? This would be ideal, as I could do this only for new files, so not breaking files that already exploit inherited IDs.\n I've tried looking into the org-attach-use-inheritance, but it seems its not designed to enforce only using the root property.\n I suppose there is some advice-add magic that could be done to (org-attach-dir)? This would be satisfactory, but less preferred as I don't like over-coupling my org notes to my specific emacs dotfiles.\n    submitted by    /u/gillash  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I don't think my title explains this well. Basically, what I mean is that, as also the case with jupyter notebooks, if I am doing an analysis and I run a cell which updates a variable itself in a self-referential way, without forgetting to run the cell where it was initialized, I get the wrong output. Is there a way to make sure one if I run an src block that depends on another src block, that the dependent src block will run before the one that I am currently running. I realize, I would need to manually tie these together. I feel like something could be done w/ the preamble attribute and writing an elisp function that just runs another src block, but I don't know how that elisp function would look. As an MWE, I imagine the functionality kind of looking like...\n #+name: initialize #+begin_src python x = 5 #+end_src #+begin_src python :preamble (call_src \"initialize\") x+=1 #+end_src \n I tried...\n (defun call_src (name) (org-babel-goto-named-src-block name) (org-babel-execute-src-block)) \n but it seemed not to load the variables before running the cell (possibly because I am using Jupyter-Emacs w/ asynchronous src blocks). \n Any help is appreciated.

Has anyone successfully done this before or has any ideas on how to accomplish it?\n Here's an example of what I mean:\n org code:\n #+TITLE: Project XYZ * My Awesome Project ** Task 1 ** Task 2 \n In Treemacs, instead of seeing \"My_Project.org,\" I would like it to display \"Project XYZ\" for that entry.\n The reason that i ask for this is that i am using OrgRoam and the file names start with a pretty large id.\n Any guidance, tips, or even pointing me in the right direction would be greatly appreciated.

          "description": "A few days ago my package llm was added to GNU ELPA. This package isn't for end-users, it's for others who are writing llm-based functionality to do so in a way that is agnostic of the llm backend. That way the user can use the LLM they have access to. LLMs are \"large language models\", very large systems that are able to deal with natural language with surprising naturalness.\n To start, we provide functionality for creating embeddings, and for LLM chat, in both sync and async versions. There are only two providers to start with: Open AI and Google Cloud Vertex. There's obviously more that are possible, such as Anthropic's API, or Llama 2.\n The difficulties with providing an interface to Llama 2, by the way, is that there seem to be a lot of different ways to install and use it, so it isn't clear that there's a good interface I could provide that would be widely useful. But it's pretty easy to write your own, and maybe I'll provide an interface that just goes to some command-line utility and executes it.\n If you are an author of a package that does something with LLMs, I'd encourage you to use this package, so your users can have some control of what backend they are using. And if you want to help expand the number of LLMs we have access to, please send a pull request if you have FSF papers. This is a GNU project, so FSF papers are required for substantial contributions.\n    submitted by    /u/ahyatt  \n [link]   [comments]",

I am trying to use emacs for my personal note writing, but also I'd like to use some of those notes as slides for a presentation with org-present. I want to customize how the presentation mode looks. Trying to follow someone else's work I figured I could create a function that changes the theme when launching org-present. When writing the notes, I use leuven theme (I selected it in customize-themes, and saved to use it by default). This is nice. Now, when I do org-present, my function is called. It just does:\n (defun my_slides () (load-theme 'some_theme)) \n And effectively the background and most colors for text change, except for the headings. They are still in leuven theme. If I manually do customize-themes, then pick the theme I want to use, THEN, do org-present, then the headings appear in the theme I picked. So, what's the difference between load-theme and customize-themes-->pick one theme? How can I effectively change the theme to enter in org-present?\n Thanks in advance, any help appreciated.\n EDIT: Solved.\n u/Nawrbit's hint worked perfectly.

I found the only theme that respected the terminal's background opacity was the default one, except when using kitty, so I guess you're good if you're a kitty user.\n On a whim, I opened up the theme.el for the theme I'm using, and added a value in brackets at the beginning of the rgb value for the background, like setting the alpha value for urxvt's background in ~/.Xdefaults. Afterwards I noticed the value in the brackets didn't matter, and could actually be left empty, like so:\n \"[]#000000\"\n Different themes will have different names for the main background. Luckily it was labeled \"bg-main\" on mine.\n P.S.: You have to edit the system-wide theme.el. Changing the one in ~/.local didn't work for me. Also, emacs will use whatever transparency value you have set for your terminal (like I said, the value in the brackets above does not matter).

(and can't sync to remove files since you can't sync without a linked dir). So don't see a way to delete the old data and then just reparse the liked folder.\n - Can't just delete the file in question from beOrgs files (and then readd) since then it wants to remove it from the repo also. Using titles to operate on files is a really bad idea it appears.\n - Syncing doesn't seem to sync, it just adds. \n - Since the issue is with the title and not filename I have no clue how to remove the old refs, since you can't delete the old file or anything.\n - I would anticipate similar problems with any reorg/refiling of items across files since it seems a totally non-destructive sync.\n ​\n So, does anyone have any ideas if there is a setting hidden somewhere? The next step would be uninstall/kill cache and see how it goes, but that's really no good since I like to be able to (re)organize my data.

At one point (possibly after adding a lot of packages to my init), I noticed that every time I restart Emacs, it reverts back to ido-mode style autocomplete. I need to turn off ido-mode explicitly every time I start Emacs, to get back to Vertico style.\n I don't know when that started happening, so I can't pinpoint after which package that is. Init is a bit extensive so I will not post it here. \n Off the tops of your heads, do you maybe know any familiar package that does this under the hood? I have not enabled ido-mode explicitly anywhere in my init. It must be some package that does it.\n Also, is there a package that can act as a debugger for emacs? So I can track the order of command executions and trace where ido-mode is enabled and in which package?

Uninstall it. Also, and this may be inconvenient for lots of people, if you have and are using Termux, you should uninstall that too. That's because the optimal way to use the GUI-based, Android-native version of Emacs is in tandem with a custom fork of Termux which shares a developer ID with Emacs so that they can cooperate. If you don't know, Termux is a command-line GNU/Linux shell and environment for Android with a package manager.

For example, yas-recompile-all is now replacing yas/recompile-all. I see such conventions followed for other libraries, too. Personally, no doubt because I'm a Clojure programmer, I like the slash over the dash. It is more distinctive, knowing \"this isn't just a core function with that name, but an actual NS (ish).\" I guess it might be more honest to elisp not to indicate there is a true namespace and it's all just a naming convention, but is this really the reason? Or is it something about compatibility (maybe with terminal users? Do terminals dislike the /?), or about interop (maybe libraries like yasnippet are also being ported to other things, like VIM or VSCode, that might have an opinion?)

Rewriting my configuration, combined with the aid I've gotten here, has kicked it back up several notches! So, thanks!)\n I'm almost completely happy with my new config. I have only one thing I need to address:\n When I add a new package (via use-package, generally) to the config, it almost always fails to download the next time I restart emacs. This is because of the package contents data being stale. I was manually running (package-refresh-contents) and restarting a subsequent time, but that was getting old. Especially given that I was experimenting with a variety of different packages.\n So I added that command to the start of my init.el, right after (package-initialize). And that added several seconds to my start-up.\n What do the rest of you do, to address this? Just accept that adding a new package means you have to refresh contents before restarting? Or is there some way to run this asynchronously?\n    submitted by    /u/rjray  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I've always found that the built in habit tracking provided by org-mode that is based on repeaters is less than ideal for capturing anything other than the notion of repeating something at some fixed interval (typically daily).\n The way that I think most people think about non-daily habits is that they ought to be completed some number of times within a certain window. For example, you might set the goal of doing some form of cardiovascular exercise at least 4 times a week.\n org-window-habit Allows you to do exactly this. Instead of relying on org repeaters (or even the habit flavored org repeaters), it uses properties from the org drawer to understand the constraints the user would like to have around their habit. To explain how this is useful, I'll return to the 4 days a week example from above. If you wanted to give yourself some leeway within an individual week (life happens), but still wanted to ensure that in the long term you are conforming to your goal of 4 repetitions a week, you might do something like specify a short term window where 3 repetitions are required in a single week, but 16 repetitions are required within any 4 week period. This would allow you to require that you're never completely falling off the wagon with your habit, but also that you can do a bit of makeup/slowdown, as long as you are roughly hitting your goal when you zoom out enough.\n For more details, take a look at the README, but also be aware that even more customization is available (take a look at the source code if you are so inclined). If it seems that people in the community are interested in this sort of habit tracking I'm happy to document even more details about how this package works, but at this point, I want to evaluate whether or not people are interested in using it before I put more work into it.\n    submitted by    /u/IvanMalison  \n [link]   [comments]",

When elpaca-suggest mode is enabled and a fundamental mode buffer is visited, the database is checked to see if an appropriate mode can be installed. When the user installs one of the suggested modes, it is enabled in the fundamental-mode buffers it applies to.\n If any Elpaca users are interested, testing and feedback are appreciated. No need to alter your config. Running the following test will allow you to experiment in a test environment.\n (elpaca-test :interactive t :ref \"feature/suggest\" :init (elpaca elpaca-suggest (elpaca-suggest-mode))) \n For example, creating a file named \"test.d\" should suggest d-mode for installation.\n    submitted by    /u/nv-elisp  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I use subdirectories in my org-directory that also serves as org-roam-directory. This means that to place a new file in the proper subdirectory, I either need to update/expand my capture templates each time when I add a subdirectory or that I need to refile or manually move the file after creating it.\n This is not a completely unsolved problem, fortunately, but most solutions are more complex than mine and require significant tailoring to one's own setup. So I set out to write something simpler using the ${foo} construct from Org-roam's template expansion.\n Quite happy with the solution that is also the first bit of elisp that I fully wrote myself (while of course being inspired by the examples on the web). I first set up a function to (recursively) collect all subdirectories below the org-directory. The resulting list is then used in a completing-read. Because ${foo} gets the file argument passed by Org-roam's capture system, the pl/ask-para-location needs to get accept this input although it doesn't actually use it.\n Together this enables interactively drilling down a directory structure or (even) to create a new (sub) directory by entering a new string instead of selecting a directory from the list provided by/to completing-read.\n  (defun pl/org-roam-directories () (let ((files (mapcar (lambda (f) (file-relative-name f org-roam-directory)) (directory-files-recursively org-roam-directory \"\\\\.org$\")))) (mapcar (lambda (f) (file-name-directory f)) files))) (defun pl/ask-para-location (ARG) (completing-read \"Choose org file :target : \" (pl/org-roam-directories))) (setq org-roam-capture-templates (quote ( (\"d\" \"Default\" plain \"%?\" :target (file+head \"${pl/ask-para-location}/${slug}.org\" \"#+title: ${title}\\n\") :unnarrowed t )))) \n Proud of this little snippet!\n (edit: small font locking improvements)\n    submitted by    /u/lappie75  \n [link]   [comments]",

Got everything \"working\" and then started a simple test.\n Test 1: I went into a large personal.org file and changed the status of something from NEXT to DONE. Hit the back arrow since I think it just saves. Go to workingcopy and it shows the file has changed, great. And then do a diff... and it's several hundred changes, all of which look identical in the diff. Maybe its a word wrap (can't tell on the phone), sometimes a space. Just a bunch of green and red highlighted sections of the same content. I didn't notice a pattern.\n Test 2: I just went into the same file in basic text mode and added \"test save\" text at the top. Do the diff in working copy and the entire file isn't mangled, it just show test save as new text. BUT there is also an added block at the bottom of the file #+BEGIN_SRC scheme / blank line / #+END_SRC. How totally random?!?! (I've never made a scheme block in my life)\n ​\n So, is beOrg just doa or what am I doing wrong? It didn't parse the SEQ_TODO block at the top of my file so I added my states in the settings, but other than that it's entirely vanilla setup. I'm so bummed I had finally got this all up and working and it just seems non-functional. I'm hoping someone can point me in the right direction and I'm doing something stupid.

For instance, when I'm reading a book, and creating notes about the book, I have some mashup of the book's title and author as a headline; and notes are in sub-headings underneath that. I just informally made this up as the need arose for various kinds of thing.\n It would be nice to regularize this, so that I could later write code that has a sense of what a \"book\" is, and its fields (author, publication date, ...) and to check for the inclusion of those fields, or integrity check them, or whatever. I'm only just beginning to think about this because I have only recently come to want it based on the way I've been using org-mode, but I'm sure this has been discussed many times, and maybe there's even a package or a method that's well-understood. Some of the new-fangled PKM tools have versions of this (e.g., Logseq, Tana) but they're undesirable for other ways (mainly, in my case, their editors suck so hard).\n Could anyone suggest existing thinking on this topic, or proposed packages, or reasons why it's a terrible idea?\n    submitted by    /u/metaham  \n [link]   [comments]",

However, it appears that I must name the minor-mode keymap in every define-key expression, e.g.:\n (defun my/add-tab-bar-history-keys () \n \"Specify more convenient keybindings for the functions that traverse the history of the tab-bar window configurations. This function is added to the mode hook for tab-bar-history-mode.\" \n (define-key tab-bar-history-mode-map (kbd \"C-q b\") 'tab-bar-history-back)\n (define-key tab-bar-history-mode-map (kbd \"C-q f\") 'tab-bar-history-forward))\n I could use map() to eliminate the redundancy, I guess, but something like local-set-key() would be more convenient and robust. \n After scouring the Web, I found this StackOverflow question from 10 years ago, viewed 1k times, \"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19308390/how-to-define-keymap-for-minor-mode-correctly, but it doesn't deal with this aspect of minor-mode keymaps. \n Perhaps a more recent technique has emerged?

          "description": "I'm getting a weird shifting of the line numbers when using (setq-default display-line-numbers 'visual).\n When moving through rows of text, the whole buffer will shift to the right by (what looks like) 1 column. The row that this happens on isn't consistent either. Moving back up the lines of text will shift it back to the left.\n In org-roam it's usually between lines 6 and 7 that I get the shift. With emacs -q it happens between lines 1 and 2. With emacs -Q it happens between lines 9 and 10. I've seen it happen for lines above 40 even.\n I can stop it from happening by disabling the absolute numbering with (setq display-line-numbers-current-absolute nil), but then I loose absolute numbering; and that's not a solution.\n This doesn't happen when using relative numbering; only with visual.\n I've tried using both (setq display-line-numbers-width-start t) and (setq display-line-numbers-grow-only t) but neither appear to change anything. (As suggested in this post)\n I'm using emacs version 28.1. I'm fairly new to emacs too.\n Steps to reproduce:\n  \nStart emacs without config: emacs -Q\n Show line numbers: M-x display-line-numbers-mode RET\n Set visual line numbers: M-x set-variable RET display-line-numbers RET visual RET\n Press enter a few times until all text shifts right by 1 column. This happens between rows 9 and 10 for me.\n  \nAnyone have any suggestions on how to stop this from happening?\n Here is a gif showing what I'm seeing:\n text shifting when moving rows\n Update:\n It appears to be affected by the vertical size of the window. With 24 lines visible, the shifting gets pushed out to line 66/67. It is not affected by where in the window those lines are though.Fiddling with the window size, It looks like the shift position happens according to (# visible lines + cursor line # = 90).\n ie. 31 visible lines, shift between line 59/60.\n 24 visible lines, shift between line 66/67.\n    submitted by    /u/CasualtyOfCuriosity  \n [link]   [comments]",

Pressing return on the dir in untracked files doesn't go into it (i thought maybe I could just add the files, but no joy). What gives?\n When I committed/pushed the wc-mode/ I staged I expected it to just add the subdir, but instead it went into creating a submodule (no experience with that term as far as VC goes) and added to the history that I merged a pull request from the git repo the dir originally came from (don't know where it grabed that info from). It was all very new, and pulling from my other machine just got me an empty dir. So I backed it all out manually by killing my .gitmodules file (newly created i think) and my .emacs.d/.git/modules/wc-mode (also newly created). Checked in the .gitmodules removal, but now looking for the way to just add a dir to my repo.\n I found a .git dir under wc-mode/ (don't think it was there before) and mv'd it to a bak. Now pressing return on wc-mode brings me up to .emacs.d in dired mode. Sooo confused now.\n (While I am curious about what how submodules work, and how it knew about the original github... I'd also really like to know just how to add a directory of files, since that seems very common.)\n ​\n Thanks for any and all help. I know this is a bit of a shit post from a debug perspective, but if you could point me toward the right info/book/etc that would be great. The magit info seems a bit obtuse at times, it's great for explaining low-level functions but not so much at explaining the designed workflow for things like this.\n ​\n    submitted by    /u/ImportanceFit1412  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I have a weird issue that I do not know how to debug. I am using sway and when I start my session sometimes the http links do not trigger the browser.\n In the sway configuration I export the browser variable:\n export BROWSER=firefox \n I am trying to open the links from an emacsclient, but this also happens with a regular emacs session. The only way I can make it work, once it stops working, is to restart emacs. After I do that the links start triggering the browser again and everything works as intended.\n Could you please help me to debug this issue? I don't know how to proceed in this case, but I have found out that browse-url seems to be the resposible one. If I position the cursor on the URL and do M-x browse-url it does not work. Of course, after the emacs restart it starts working again. So, I think that this is the function that is failing.\n SOLVED: It is possible to add a handler and set the default browser with the browse-url-text-browser variable and then set the browse-url-browser-function as browse-url-firefox. This block of code solves my issue:\n (setq browse-url-text-browser \"firefox\") (setq browse-url-browser-function 'browse-url-firefox browse-url-new-window-flag t browse-url-firefox-new-window-is-tab t) \n    submitted by    /u/G0k1bur1  \n [link]   [comments]",

This was a great learning experience and really gave me a brand new appreciation for the customizability of Emacs. \n This package currently includes the following features:\n  \nDetailed syntax highlighting (variables, cmdlets, keywords, .NET types, strings, single- and multi-line comments, docstrings)\n Code indentation \n Auto-complete for built-in and user-defined variables and cmdlets, built-in cmdlet parameters, and .NET types and members\n Spawning and sending code to an inferior shell process\n Support for PowerShell in Windows, *nix, and MacOS\n  \nI kind of hacked together the company backend, so it may not be as efficient as it could be. There may also be some bugs I missed (I haven’t figured out how to do company completion for multiple periods yet for the .NET types, for example), but I have been using it for writing PowerShell scripts at work and it’s been working well. \n Feedback is always appreciated and pull requests are always welcome.

So recently (and probably foolishly) I did list-packages and let it update everything. Doing this kind of broke doom-modeline for me. I was getting weird ISO characters in the modeline, and with some research discovered that it had switched to nerd-icons at some point in the past. Previously it was working fine with all-the-icons. \n Well I got nerd-icons installed and that fixed things up pretty much though the character is still quite small in comparison. However I discovered that the little icon doom-modeline uses for VHDL files is different from the one treemacs and all-the-icons uses for VHDL files. So this got me looking around for some definition of what file suffix gets associated with what icon.\n And that's where I got stuck. I can't find any option or list anywhere that sets that up. It's not that I need them to be the same (though I do prefer the one in all-the-icons) but now I'm just puzzled as to how this is assigned. Clearly it's got to be in the elisp somewhere, but... nothing so far.\n Does anyone know where it lists a character hex value and a file type list?\n    submitted by    /u/remillard  \n [link]   [comments]",

I tried searching through the org-mode source code and could not find any function with a similar signature as that of org-justify-fragment-overlay. Does anyone know of any potential fixes for this?\n    submitted by    /u/FantaSeahorse  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "As an active Emacs user and package developer, I've been contemplating the structure of tabulated-list-mode in Emacs Lisp, particularly its use of vectors. While vectors are efficient for indexed access, they present challenges when dealing with complex data structures or transformations.\n Much of my work involves parsing data from JSON API responses, which naturally form alist, plist, or hash-table structures. In the current iteration of tabulated-list-mode, a two-stage process is necessary: first, normalization into vector format (I find it hard to imagine a structure where the entry format (ID [DESC1 ... DESCN]) could originate from), followed by rendering through tabulated-list-print. This process can introduce performance inefficiencies.\n In real-world scenarios where normalization to the tabulated-list's vector format is unavoidable, the efficiency advantage of vectors is somewhat negated, and can even result in an overall performance loss due to the extra conversion step.\n I'd propose using lists instead of vectors in tabulated-list-format and tabulated-list-entries. This change could potentially allow for greater flexibility and better alignment with common data inputs. However, I understand that historical decisions and compatibility concerns may limit the feasibility of such changes.\n In the interim, I suggest enabling tabulated-list-print to act as a transducer, reducing the need for multiple iteration passes. This could significantly streamline the rendering of non-vector-compatible data while preserving compatibility and performance.\n I've noted that some libraries also struggle with this issue, resorting to workarounds and hacks, as evidenced in the magit-repolist-columns documentation string.\n I welcome your thoughts, advice, and any potential solutions or alternatives. If there are potential pitfalls I've overlooked, I'm keen to learn about them too.\n    submitted by    /u/elgrekoo  \n [link]   [comments]",

I wouldn't be surprised if the code I wrote is just bad somehow too... \n What I'm doing: evaluate the following elisp, then with M-: run one of the functions like (rex/frame-init-ibm). This causes the faces in the list in rex/frame-init-aux to be applied to this and every subsequent frame.

And I really hate to tie any workflow of mine to the phone. I recalled having read something about it, and some searching brought me back to Mickey's post. Jackpot! Emacs to the rescue, with Mickey's help.\n I ended up doing things a little differently, since my setup is not the same. I store my passwords in a .gpg file, and wanted to retrieve the totp key from there, instead of from auth sources. And I also preferred to use oathtool for the main task, instead of the adapted version of Jürgen Hötzel's `totp.el'. Which, as a bonus, spared me of handling the base32 decoding.\n But Mickey's post was really useful in showing an alternative and laying the ground work. You may find it useful too, since you are likely to have received or to soon receive the same GitHub message (if you didn't already had 2FA set up).\n    submitted by    /u/gusbrs  \n [link]   [comments]",

Let me give me example to illustrate the behavior better: Suppose I am the beginning of a line of text, then I run `C-k` to delete it. The line is deleted, then it shows up again for a brief moment, and then not anymore. Just to clarify, let me add the sequence of events:\n  \n(line present) Displays line\n (deteles line) `C-k`\n (line deleted) No display line\n (line deleted) Displays line for a brief moment\n (line deleted) No display line\n  \nThis behavior happens with basically everything, meaning the new \"state\" (a word is typed, a buffer is switched, etc) is displayed and then momentarily goes back to the previous \"state\" (when the word had been typed, etc).\n My problem felt similar to this https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/112uuse/emacs_29060_is_bit_jumpy_scrolling_when_using/ but it isn't because I emptied my `init.el` and the problem still persists. Also, when I run `emacs -nw` in the terminal, then there is no problem. So, it is something with the rendering, but I have no idea how to even tackle this. Any help/guidance is appreciated.\n ​\n    submitted by    /u/carlml  \n [link]   [comments]",

From this, it is transferred to their journal, where everything appears more systematic, and finally to a ledger, in double entry after the Italian manner of bookkeeping, where one settles accounts with each man, once as debtor and then as creditor. This deserves to be imitated by scholars. First it should be entered in a book in which I record everything as I see it or as it is given to me in my thoughts; then it may be entered in another book in which the material is more separated and ordered, and the ledger might then contain, in an ordered expression, the connection sand explanations of the material that flow from it.…",

Together, these ideas present the notion that language shapes experience. Maybe I have a warped understanding of this. This is obvious when considering self-talk. The language we use when we talk to ourselves dictates our moods, affect, actions, behaviors, and total experience. This is good news. Changing how we talk to ourselves and the stories we tell ourselves will change our experience—the role of methodeutic language or 'speculative rhetoric' as it steers cognitive understanding of the world.\nI'm a judgment machine. Comparisons and self-criticism are sneaky and ubiquitous. I'm not talking about \"I'm a failure.\" I'm talking about \"Shouldn't I spend more time exercising, in the outdoors, walking, zettelkasting?\" and other subtle ways I self-evaluate and am critical of my behavior.\nPush above what I think is my \"reading level\" to achieve mastery by reading more books that present more profound ideas. If I want to understand bigger ideas, I must read books with greater ideas to grasp the deeper concepts essential for remarkable achievements. It's not enough to read a lot. To do extraordinary things, I must read books that stretch my mind.\nMuscle mass preservation during weight loss in a 66-year-old male.\nThings I'm reading:\nLispector, Clarice and Costa, Margaret Jull and Patterson, Robin and Valente, Paulo Gurgel.

And on top of that I have lots of family concerns such as, family psychology, recurring tasks, hobbies and other.\nFor all the above, my brain cannot keep everything and thus the search some months ago brought me in front of some new to me methods, like zettelkasten, BASB, How to Take Smart Notes and lots of software. But to be honest, I haven't found my own workflow yet, what system to follow and what software to combine. I hope \"building-a-second-brain-and-zettelkasten\" will be something I could use for tasks and knowledge, but we'll see \nI read so many great forum posts here and shared workflows, I watch your great videos in youtube and I try to adjust my workflow when I see something that could make it better.\nI'm glad that I join zettelkasten.de forums",
