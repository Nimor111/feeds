Despite having little math background other than the few math classes that are typical for a computer science major, and not being able to come up with many relevant examples, I enjoyed reading through the book and tried my best to follow along every part, except coends.\n However, I struggled with the challenges in the book. I had to look up for solutions, or just failed to understand them at all, for more than half of them. I also didn't realize until the last few chapters that I kind of got natural transformations wrong. I thought it's a morphism of F a -> G a, but really it maps any object a to a morphism F a -> G a. I noticed that my retention for the knowledge is low. In other words, I forget the details of concepts in the book pretty fast. I tried to explain to myself verbally the concepts I learned, but I can feel it's wonky sometimes.\n I'd like to ask what are the next steps for me? Should I go through a different text, maybe \"Category Theory for the Working Mathematicians\", or others like \"Category Theory in Contexts\", hoping that maybe they'll solidify and expand my learning from a different aspect? Or should I learn a few other branches of math that I'm interested, and come back to category theory and see how they relate? Or?\n    submitted by    /u/machai_montgomery  \n [link]   [comments]",

Sorry if this question is silly because English is not my first language.\n In the book, the author says that\n broken :: (a -> b) -> a -> b broken f a = apply where apply :: b apply = f a \n  \nThis code fails to compile because type variables have no notion of scope. The Haskell Report provides us with no means of referencing type variables outside of the contexts in which they’re declared.\n  \nQuestion: Do type variables have no scope or they are scoped within \"the contexts in which they’re declared\" (type signatures if I am not mistaken).\n My understanding is that type variables in type signature are automatically universally quantified, so\n broken :: (a -> b) -> a -> b \n is equivalent to\n broken :: forall a b. (a -> b) -> a -> b \n forall a b. introduces a type scope. However, without the ScopedTypeVariables extension, the scope of a and b is the type signature where they are declared, but not the whole definition of broken.\n This quantification is to ensure that a and b in the type signature are consistent, that is, both occurrences of a refer to the same a, and both occurrences of b refer to the same b.\n Question: Is my understanding correct?\n Thanks.\n    submitted by    /u/Reclusive--Spikewing  \n [link]   [comments]",

Yampa prides itself in being a long-standing community project. It has now been around for 20 years!!! See https://github.com/ivanperez-keera/yampa#features for details on Yampa's features.\n This new release introduces a new type of integral that implements the trapezoid integration rule. Simulations executed at low sampling rates can behave in ways that violate expected physical laws (e.g., systems may gain energy over time due to inaccuracies in the calculation of positions and velocities).

I have two related problems, I'm at my wits-end and I was hoping for some advice.\n The problem basically boils down to injecting context into an Aeson FromJSON parser. If I wish to read a file of JSON objects that refer to each other, I would like to be able to replace an identifier reference with the actual object when it is read. For example\n  data Region = Region { regionID :: Text , regionName :: Text , regionType :: RegionType , regionParent :: Maybe Region , regionLocale :: Maybe Locale } \n with data like\n  [ { \"id\": \"ES\", \"name\": \"Spain\", \"type\": \"Country\", \"locale\": \"es\" }, { \"id\": \"ES-CL\", \"name\": \"Castille and León\", \"type\": \"Subnational\", \"parent\": \"ES\" } { \"id\": \"ES-GA\", \"name\": \"Galicia\", \"type\": \"Subnational\", \"parent\": \"ES\", \"locale\": \"ga\" } ] \n I have an elaborate system of placeholders and normalisation at the moment to sort out the parent references to \"ES\" and I was wondering if there was something, a la Jackson, that would handle references naturally.\n I have lots and lots of other examples of this sort of need to reference other items.\n The other aspect of this in injecting this information, hopefully using the ReaderT pattern, into another parser that will use this data. As an example,\n  data Location = Location { locationID :: Text , locationName :: Text, , locationRegion :: Region } \n and \n  [ { \"id\": \"S\", \"name\": \"Santiago de Compostella\", \"region\": \"ES-GA\" } ] \n where the Galicia data, with all its useful information such as locales and holidays, replaces the \"ES-GA\" reference.\n I have wasted waaay to much time trying to figure out how to achive this and would appreciate any useful* advice.\n * With the caveat that I do not regard \"embed it into code\" as \"useful\".

Meanwhile, the HVM searcher, using SUP Nodes, takes just 1.7m interactions, or about 0.0085s. More interestingly, it takes just 0.03 interactions per guess. This sounds like a huge speedup, so, it is very likely I'm doing something dumb. As such, I'd like to ask for validation.\n I've published the Haskell code (and the full story, for these interested) below. My question is: Am I missing something? Is there some obvious way to optimize this Haskell search without changing the algorithm? Of course, the algorithm is still exponential and not necessarily useful, but I'm specifically interested in determining whether the HVM version is actually faster than what can be done in Haskell.\n Gist: https://gist.github.com/VictorTaelin/7fe49a99ebca42e5721aa1a3bb32e278\n    submitted by    /u/SrPeixinho  \n [link]   [comments]",

In my opinion, it seems to give wrong information. Below is an example:\n \"If main isn't a function, it should follow that neither is putStrLn. ... As you can see, the return type of putStrLn is IO(). Like main, putStrLn is an IO action because it violates our rule that function must return values.\"\n The author seemed to think \"IO ()\" isn't a value, which I don't agree with. So I googled and found the following on Haskell wiki https://wiki.haskell.org/Introduction_to_Haskell_IO/Actions:\n \"PutStrLn takes an argument, but it is not an action. It is a function that takes one argument (a string) and returns an action of type IO (). So putStrLn is not an action, but putStrLn \"hello\" is.\"\n So I think the author is completely wrong on that, isn't it?

I wanted to learn to compose a bit, and the traditional method is counterpoint. So I did what any barely musically literate nerd would do: I started to write a program to verify that a counterpoint composition follows the rules when played against a given melody. Frankly it was an uphill battle. But finally, this weekend, I got it working.\n https://github.com/ludflu/counterpointer-report\n The main thing that stymied my earlier efforts was that I didn't understand the nature of musical intervals in a formal way. Every explanation I learned described it as a mathematically naive music student might require, which makes sense if I were trying to play the oboe or whatnot. Or, things would be explained in DSP terms, explaining how overtones work, etc. And that also makes sense, but....\n But what I really needed, was for someone to tell me that musical intervals are calculated using integers mod 12. Which actually makes a ton of sense when you think about how human's perceive relative pitch. Did you know that humans are the only animals we know of that perceive relative pitch? I'm pretty sure I learned that from David Huron's excellent book.\n Eventually I thought to ask someone over in /r/musictheory and things mostly worked out from there since I could use the Haskell modular-arithmetic library for the intervals, and Euterpea for representing notes and playing them via MIDI.\n Finally I had to hack around some broken stuff because Euterpea, though its a marvelous library, is not actively maintained and so needed some work to get it to run with modern Cabal. AND PortMIDI-haskell doesn't agree with Clang on OSX. But I was able to patch all those things locally to get everything running, and I submitted PRs to try and fix them up for everyone else.\n    submitted by    /u/ludflu  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello,\n I need to find the nth prime number. This is what I have so far:\n module Prime (nth) where nth :: Int -> Maybe Integer nth n | n < 1 = Nothing | otherwise = Just ([x | x <- [2..n], isPrime x] !! (n-1)) isPrime :: Int -> Bool isPrime 2 = True isPrime n | n < 2 = False |otherwise = all (map (\\x -> n `mod` x /= 0)) [2..root] where root = (floor . sqrt . fromIntegral) n \n Some of the errors I get are (seems that both functions are wrong):\n Couldn't match expected type ‘Integer’ with actual type ‘Int’ • In the expression: x In the first argument of ‘(!!)’, namely ‘[x | x <- [2 .. n], isPrime x]’ In the first argument of ‘Just’, namely ‘([x | x <- [2 .. n], isPrime x] !! (n - 1))’Couldn't match expected type Couldn't match type ‘[Bool]’ with ‘Bool’ Expected: [Int] -> Bool Actual: [Int] -> [Bool] • In the first argument of ‘all’, namely ‘(map (\\ x -> n `mod` x /= 0))’Couldn't match type ‘[Bool]’ with ‘Bool’ Expected: [Int] -> Bool Actual: [Int] -> [Bool] • In the first argument of ‘all’, namely ‘(map (\\ x -> n `mod` x /= 0))’ \n The second error is not really clear for me, I thought that all returns Bool (a -> Bool) -> [a] -> Bool), why would it be [Bool]? Also, any hint for the first function?

          "description": "So I've been diving into the world of algebraic effects systems as an alternative to mtl-style classes for granular effect tracking. One thing I haven't quite figured out yet is how to handle errors in the middle of a computation that uses a custom effect type. For example, let's say I have an effect for talking to the database:\n  data DB :: Effect where DBWrite :: Item -> DB m () DBRead :: Key -> DB m (Maybe Item) \n and types for errors and the database environment\n ``` data DBError = DeadLockError | ConnectionError\n data DBEnv = DBEnv Connection ```\n and let's say I have the interpreter:\n  runDBIO :: (IOE :> es, Error DBError :> es) => DBEnv -> Eff (DB : es) a -> Eff es a runDBIO env = interpret \\_ -> \\case ... do handling here ... \n Now the recommended way to instrument all of this is to wire up all of your effect handlers at the start of your program:\n  main = do env <- getDbEnv result <- runEff . runError @DBError . runDBIO env $ program case result of Left -> ... do something ... Right -> ... do something ... \n This all makes sense. But what if I want to handle the error at a deeper level in the program and not at the very top level? The Error DBError effect doesn't manifest in the type list until the runDBIO interpreter is applied. For example,\n  tryWriteDBOrSendEmailPage :: Item -> Eff [Email, DB] () tryWriteDBOrSendEmailPage item = do catchError (dbWrite item) $ \\_ e -> emailPage $ \"Something went wrong: \" ++ (show e) return () \n This doesn't work here because the type signature doesn't contain Error DBError, but the underlying implementation of DB uses it. If I add Error DBError to the effect list, wouldn't that be a totally separate effect from DB, so it wouldn't be able to throw and catch in the same context? Should I manually expose effects for TryDBWrite and TryDBRead that return an Either? Not exactly sure what to do here.\n    submitted by    /u/ryanworldorder  \n [link]   [comments]",

It would have to be a project deployed to the cloud, scalable, reliable, performant (but not extremely performant - jvm performance is fine). It will have to be maintained for years to come - by you, your team and your successors.\n Whatever you choose, you will have to recruit a team or train your coworkers - let's assume that they are mostly java users, good old spring booters, but they are not against the idea of learning a new language and paradigm.\n Would you choose Scala for such a project if given a choice? Do you feel confident that you'd be able to sell this idea to your manager? Do you believe that with Scala it would be cheaper to maintain or more profitable than with other languages? When would it become profitable - the recruitment / trainings would be more expensive surely, so would benefits of Scala become visible after weeks, months, years of maintaining the product, or never at all?\n View Poll\n    submitted by    /u/Time_Competition_332  \n [link]   [comments]",

Pseudocode-ish:\n ``` type A <: T type B <: T\n trait Foo[t <: T]\n object Foo1 extends Foo[A]\n objet Foo2 extends Foo[B]\n def someFunc[t <: T](foo: Foo[t]): Unit = { somethingThatKnowsHowToTakeTypes[t].foobar }\n Seq( Foo1, Foo2 ).map(someFunc) ```\n This leads to type erasure concerns, even though to me it seems obvious that that Sequence is of a type where each object inside is a Foo of some concrete type that fits the constraints. I can get around it by introducing some wrapper case class that I can stick Foo1 and Foo2 into, which retains it's type as an explicit member. And then inside someFunc I have to manually use that type member explicitly. Feels clunky and it feels like something I'm tricking the compiler into doing. Not to mention at some point I did get it to compile, only to fail at runtime if I didn't create the correct implicit typetag in scope.\n Second example:\n Sequence of (Foo[t <: T], Bar[t <: T]), and Bar/Foo have methods that operate on or return t <: T. I store in a 2-tuple because inside a lambda I want to do something like Foo.read(...).map(Bar.transform) where Foo.read returns something typed by t and Bar.transform takes something subtyped by t. I assume since I pair them up in a 2-tuple, the Seq of these such objects could recognize that it's some paired object, but instead the compiler complains about expected vs supplied types.\n    submitted by    /u/kebabmybob  \n [link]   [comments]",

After that, I've had up to a dozen of these kinds of interviews, for a remote international team, but I never managed to get a job. Now finally I have found a new job but it is not a great project and not what I want.\n I am not the most enthusiastic person when it comes always being up to date and reading blogs and stuff and also for the past years, I have not been a person who got assigned to the more complex stuff in my company. Otherwise I have a pretty good basis for algorithms and coding challenges (although I failed the last one which was live coding using lots of Scala generics).\n Now, it seems to me that when recruiting for a remote team, especially for a senior position, the stands for a Scala developer are pretty high and the projects are not simple (relatively, like more distributed stuff).\n Does anyone have more insights how this compares to other languages. A lot of people that I know which I wold think were at my level as a developer or even sub, got remote jobs or jobs away from my country, and I am feeling stuck. I keep wondering if it would have been easier to find this kind of remote job if i stayed with C# or moved to Java, and not due to lack of opportunities in the Scala world....\n    submitted by    /u/PierreGargoyle  \n [link]   [comments]",

I tried writing directly on notion but 1. the subpage system is driving me crazy (a page can be a link, or can be a whole line! and if you delete the whole line one, the page will be deleted, and sometimes you don't need whole line one; let alone the subpage being attached to parent so moving things around is another hassle) 2. It looks ugly compared to my emacs theme or website theme. \n The pain plus the bliss of writting in org-mode made me wonder if there's a way to write in org-mode and export it to notion. I guess if I have the bulk of the doc done at some permanent form(don't need to edit much) I don't care where it is on anyway. So what I'm looking for is a solution to 1. write a lot of stuffs in org-mode(possibly from lots of files linked together with org-id or file link) 2. slide them into notion as a cluster of pages. \n I'm currently trying notion's builtin import function https://www.notion.so/help/import-data-into-notion So far html is not working(failed with no error message), and I'm trying others, but I wonder if there's others have done this before?\n Currently my solution is to 1. write my stuff with org-mode and publish to my personal website (e.g. https://hermanhel.codeberg.page/braindump-ui/#f351ae9c-c280-4c71-9b12-1b8ba4a4200d this some doc I wrote about using huggingface) 2. make a page on notion and stick link to my website there.

It gives you modern keybindings, improves the behavior of tabs and windows and a few other things.\n Some highlights:\n  \nUnder 200k, including comments, the GPL, etc.\n The actual code is under 30k.\n No external packages, does not impose a package manager on you.\n Composed of several features that can individually be activated or deactivated.\n Modern keybindings \n C-c for copy, C-a for select all, etc.\n \n Tab is just tab if no text is selected.\n Generally stops Emacs from opening new tabs when you open new buffers\n Closes windows when you close the last tab\n Dired doesn't new buffers when you navigate to new directories.\n A splash screen\n Heavily commented code base\n Code says the default values of settings that are changed.\n  \nPlease let me know what you think and if you have any suggestions.

And how do i fix that?\n To be clear emacs does have full terminal emulators like vterm or ansi-term.\n But i think it would be awesome to have those advantages that comint already has and also have a perfect development environment for creating tui programs.\n I hope this post doesn't feel like a rant or is unclear.

          "description": "Hello! I've been recently trying to get more intentional about treating Emacs Lisp like 'any other programming language' and so I have a question about package development.\n Let's say that you are developing two packages that depend on different versions of the same package. You are using Eask/Cask/Eldev/Keg/etc and so you have two projects: foo and bar that both depend on some third package baz, but one of them is 'stuck' at an earlier version. The packages are otherwise unrelated. For the argument's sake, you cannot upgrade. How do you get completion, documentation, jump to definition etc pointing at the correct version of baz? Do you clear up your load path every time you switch between the projects?\n Or to put question differently, when you develop foo.el, how do you get elisp completion and documentation relevant only to what foo.el should be able to access and not to anything defined in your configuration? Right now if I open any .el file elisp-completion-at-point will happily suggest any function or variable that I ever defined in init.el. I can of course start a new session and load only foo.el . But then I lose all my customization to get accurate completions.\n This is a pretty common scenario within the larger programming ecosystem and most languages/tools handle it without the developer ever thinking about it, but I have not seen anything on the topic in Emacs Lisp specifically. Any pointers would be appreciated.\n Edit: Some clunky wording in 3rd paragraph.\n    submitted by    /u/icejam_  \n [link]   [comments]",

My Emacs was filled with org files containing highlights, bookmarks, and copied passages, yet I often struggled to recall or effectively use this information when I needed it. I realized I wasn't truly engaging with what I read.\n I stumbled upon Niklas Luhmann's Zettelkasten method and was intrigued. The idea of summarizing in my own words and connecting ideas across different sources resonated with me. I started experimenting with this method manually and found that I was remembering more and understanding deeper.\n My Solution\n Being an Emacs user, I thought, \"Why not create a tool to streamline this process?\" That's how I started working on org-zettel-ref-mode.\n Here's what it does:\n  \nAutomatically extracts comments and summaries from the text you're reading.\n Creates an overview window for quick reference.\n Saves literature notes to custom folders.\n Enables quick commenting with a simple command.\n Allows easy navigation between notes and source material.\n  \nHere's what it looks like:\n https://preview.redd.it/ocznlb8ppxjd1.png?width=3912&format=png&auto=webp&s=ad89abce1de70ea319053e2fab261c214e306eeb\n I'm curious:\n  \nHave you ever created tools to enhance your learning process?

          "description": "A few days ago I found out about Open RSS. So far I only use it to get beautifully crafted feeds of YouTube channels and playlists with video descriptions and thumbnails. \n I could have just used the feeds provided by YouTube instead, only if entries would have thumbnails and video descriptions.\n I could have just used an “intelligent” reader like Feedly. But I don’t like proprietary garbage with integrated AI that just ends up making my life harder. And also it’s not Emacs. \n I could have just an alternative frontend like Invidious. But playlist feeds don’t have thumbnails and videos, entries obviously link to invidious instances and not to YouTube directly and these public instances are slow. I didn’t have the resources to selfhost my own instance and just wanted a convenient, performant solution. \n I could have just used Elfeed in conjunction with Elfeed-tube. These packages are actually great, but I’m a Gnus user. \n For anyone with similar opinions and experiences Open RSS might be very well worth a try. For me it hits a perfect sweet spot. It’s also privacy-friendly and is developed in a transparent fashion. Although the source code is not publicly available, at least as far as I know. But that’s understandable as they’re kept alive by their user’s donations.\n Mark, the developer of Open RSS, is quick to reply if one encounters any issues and already helped me out once.\n    submitted by    /u/schwinghmmr  \n [link]   [comments]",

It's really just an optimized early-init.el and an init.el that strives for fast startup times and sensible default settings. All the magic that is necessary is included. This is really nice because there's a lot of conflicting information online about the best way to optimize GC, etc. in early-init.el and this project does it for you. I've seen similar settings but I also saw some new stuff I didn't know about. \n It is designed to keep those two files in git so you can update Minimal-Emacs. Setup additional modules for user customization in pre-early-init.el, post-early-init.el and pre/post for init.el as well. \n It's up to the user to add to the base. If you start with this kit then proceed to watch System Crafters Emacs from Scratch series, it will get you up and running very quickly. \n James put a lot of effort into this base starter kit and I am digging it, no cap FR as the whippersnappers are accustomed to proclaiming. ;-)\n    submitted by    /u/JamesBrickley  \n [link]   [comments]",

After googling I found out that the problem has already been solved in magit over a year ago. Because I'm updating the Emacs packages once in a month, I was wondering why it is still in my local magit installation.\n The reason is that the release versions on NonGNU Elpa and Melpa Stable are still version 3.3.0, which was released on Oct 4, 2021. Does somebody know the reason why there are no new releases on those archives?\n Yes, I know I could use Melpa Unstable, but I don't want it, because I'm serving a lot of my colleagues with an Emacs configuration and I don't want to use unstable package versions.\n Yes, I know I could ask directly on GitHub, but I don't want to create an account for just one question.\n    submitted by    /u/Wumpitz  \n [link]   [comments]",

After a bit of trying out different configs I got it working with the OAuth 2.0 setup of my employer. \n Now I'm trying to actually use it, but I find it somewhat unexpected; perhaps that's because I have used org-gcal for a while and was expecting something similar, i.e. synchronizing of the calendar entries into an org file which can be linked to my org-agenda (and calfw).\n For example, a very frequent occurrence is to schedule meetings with other people (in person). This generally works by everybody looking at their calendar to find a spot in e.g. the next week where all of us are available. Is this possible with Excorporate? To me it seems it's only possible to check the calendar entries for a given day (via M-x calendar, moving to the date, pressing d or e), but not get a list of all the events, or all the events in a week/month. \n Furthermore, creating events seems to be possible via the API (https://github.com/emacsmirror/excorporate/blob/master/excorporate.info, chapter 6 API Usage), but this functionality is not exposed as an interactive function. Does that mean I have to write my own helper functions here?

          "description": "Hello fellow Emacs enthusiasts!\n I've noticed an interesting behavior difference between fill-paragraph in text-mode and org-fill-paragraph in org-mode, particularly when working with selected regions.\n Here's what I've observed:\n  \nIn text-mode, fill-paragraph respects the selected region and only operates within it.\n In org-mode, org-fill-paragraph doesn't seem to respect the selected region and operates on the entire paragraph.\n  \nI've created a GIF to illustrate this difference:\n https://i.redd.it/7trbpcthrqgd1.gif\n I initially thought this was a bug and submitted a report, but it was determined not to be one.\n I'd like to open this up for community discussion to get your thoughts and insights.\n In org-mode, the behavior remains the same whether a region is selected or not. When no region is selected, I believe this behavior is appropriate.\n However, the issue arises when a user explicitly selects a region, expecting the fill operation to be limited to that selection.\n I think org-fill-paragraph should respect the selected region, similar to how fill-paragraph works in text-mode.\n What do you think about this behavior?\n  \nUpdate: Now that I've reviewed the org-fill-paragraph function documentation again, I understand the current behavior.\n  \nThe REGION argument is non-nil if called interactively; in that\n case, if Transient Mark mode is enabled and the mark is active,\n fill each of the elements in the active region, instead of just\n filling the current element.\"\n  \nUnlike text-mode's fill-paragraph, org-fill-paragraph is designed to \"fill each of the elements in the active region.\"\n The current behavior seems to be explained by this information.\n Thank you for your opinions!\n    submitted by    /u/tttuuu888  \n [link]   [comments]",

It seems reddit has also signed some exclusive deal with Google allowing only Google to index it.\n \nThe way Reddit know handles blocking by other users. Sometime ago I began to notice that so many responses had some error like deleted and unavailable. Something I remarked on in this thread - Why do some reddit users especially on r/emacs keep messing up threads their involved by deleting their posts or making them unavailable? I don't see why some people should disrupt a technical discussion by blocking some participants who can't see what is going. It is not as though this Twitter or Facebook, this is simply a technical forum and the discussions don't often veer into the political. What kind of mindset does it take to block someone because you don't want them to read your views on technical issues, and it is not as though the person blocked cannot login using another account to see the thread?\n \n These two issues are making this forum less appealing.

I don't have much to go on but my assumption was that when the rust-analyzer was working or Rust LSP was communicating it was causing it to panic and crash but this was just an assumption and I was having trouble getting much out of --debug-init. This user was able to downgrade to version 29.3 and it solved their problems.\n Recently I've completely uninstalled rust, emacs and doom emacs and found wayland-emacs on the aur which I didn't notice last time. I've reinstalled Rust and now I'm going to attempt to install this AUR package and go from there. Another issue I was having was opening Fish shell in Doom Emacs with Term which wasn't an issue before until installing Rust.\n It's also important to note that I've had this Arch + Hyprland install for about 2 weeks and Doom Emacs hasn't given any issues what so ever until installing rust and rust-analyzer but also I upgraded around the same time and I know there was an upgrade 2 days ago. Thanks for reading, I wanted to try and be thorough so I apologize for the length of this.\n P.S The user on Arch I was talking about with a similar issue was using X11\n EDIT: solved, I use the pacaman package manager to uninstall emacs-wayland and installed emacs instead. So far rust hasn't crashed when editing or coding rs files in doom and rust-analayzer is working. Must install with rustup component add rust-analyzer though, not your package manager. and using vterm this time with no issues.. yet ;)\n    submitted by    /u/HaK_0ryX  \n [link]   [comments]",

I was thinking that having a single \"log buffer\" into which the messages would be written would prevent buffer spamming, and then I could just show the operator a different particular message in each window. Playing around with different things, trying to use indirect buffers with some sort of region narrowing seemed to be a good possible option.\n I didn't have much luck with this though:\n  (let ((org-dates (list \"2020-04-05\" \"2023-08-02\" \"2021-09-08\" \"2019-08-04\"))) (delete-other-windows) (split-window-right) (split-window-right) (split-window-right) (balance-windows) (dolist (earlier-journal-entry org-dates) (pop-to-buffer (make-indirect-buffer (get-buffer-create \"*Org Roam Daily Reflection Log*\") (generate-new-buffer-name \"*indirect*\"))) (let* ((start (point)) (org-msg (concat \"\\n\\n* No daily journal entry for \" earlier-journal-entry \".\"))) (insert org-msg) ;; (org-mode) (narrow-to-region start (point))))) \n In particular, the narrowing doesn't seem to work right.

I have tried several solutions, but they all are just solutions which means tabs will be filled with 'x' no of spaces. not tabs with TABS.

          "description": "I have quite a few projects and meeting and i keep track of them by using columnview dynamic block to show them in the project (each meeting has a property which points to the project and :match searches for the property). Columview has an option to add Links (so i just need to click on it and see what has been discussed). But this link feature doesnt work if the item are in a different file. \n So when capturing a meeting with org-capture i just created another property like:\n :LINK: [[file:~/org/meetings.org::*%\\1][%\\1]]\n which is essentially a link to itself, where %\\1 is the Meeting Title and the org headline and add this Property to the columnview. That way i can click on it form a project and see what the meeting was about.\n Now the Problem: the headline might not be unique (e.g. weekly repeating meeting) and there for i thought it might be a better idea to use a custom_id for example. So i tried to use a capture template like this:\n * %^{Meeting}\n :PROPERTIES:\n :PROJECT:\n :ATTENDEE:\n :LINK: [[file:~/org/meetings.org::*%\\1][%\\1]\n :CUSTOM_ID: %<%Y%m%d%H%M%S>-%(string-replace \" \" \"-\" \"%\\\\1\")\n :LINK2: [[id:%<%Y%m%d%H%M%S>-%(replace-regexp-in-string \"\\s\" \"-\" \"%\\\\1\")][%\\1]]\n :ID: %(org-id-new)\n :END:\n I try to replace the whitespace in the headline as this would be no valid ID. But that doesnt work it gets evaluated but the whitespaces are not replaced. i could reuse :ID: aswell but dont know how in a capture template.

I'm writing both python and rust, and my issue is that when I select a completion for a function name or class, it always puts opening and closing parenthesis after it, automatically. Meaning, I type:\n my_obj.beginning_of_metho\n and it (corfu) gives me the option:\n beginning_of_method\n I select it, and what it inserts is:\n my_obj.beginning_of_method(argname1, argname2)\n Which is right 80% of the time, and infuriating that 20% of the time that I needed to pass that bare function somewhere. Its more annoying with class names, it puts parens in when I'm just trying to make a type hint. \n I've seen this behavior with rust-analyzer, jedi-language-server and pyright, so I don't think its server specific, and I've seen it with lsp-mode and eglot so I don't think its specific to those modes. I'm using corfu, but I haven't figured out a switch in corfu to change this behavior.\n The ideal behavior in my opinion would be when I select the method name, it inserts just that:\n my_obj.beginning_of_method\n And then if I type an open paren\n my_obj.beginning_of_method(\n At that point it would insert the args with the closing paren.\n my_obj.beginning_of_method(argname1, argname2)\n Has anyone else figured out how to do this?

I used it years ago, then I forgot about it for a while, and recently came back.\n So I was wondering about the current best way to filter the posts by tags, so that I can focus on specific groups of posts instead of the entire stream. I was looking at Mike Zemansky's approach to filter the posts using a hydra and a macro. It looks pretty good, and I was working towards that. However, I realized that this approach was 7 years old. \n Hence, I was wondering if there are any better or improved ways to filter posts today, that were not referenced in Mike Zemansky's post? I believe in his code, emacs looks for all unique tags in the total feed, defines shortcut or hydra keys, and finally creates a hydra that the user can use to search for those posts. So it seems simple and nice. \n But as I said, I was not sure if there was a package to do this now, or do I have to write that code myself in my `.spacemacs` file.

And the ZK method seems well suited for also keeping track of those things.\nIs there some wisdom in keeping the things separate? Or do you just let it all live together?\nWhat about journaling?

Does anyone actively disagree that Luhmann's \"Register\" and similar documents in modern zettelkästen would naturally be called indexes in the absence of interference from the German word? If you disagree, what does the English word 'register' mean to you, and in a zettelkasten context, how does it differ from an index?

The promise of data ownership and flexibility was alluring. However, as time passed, I found myself gravitating back to cloud-based solutions.\nNow, I'm feeling the pull towards local files and Markdown again. It's as if I'm caught in a perpetual swing between the convenience of the cloud and the freedom of local storage.\nThis pattern has me wondering:\nIs this back-and-forth between local-first and cloud-based systems common in the PKM community?\nFor those who've made multiple switches, what ultimately made you settle on one approach (if you have)?\nAre there solutions that effectively bridge this gap, offering the best of both worlds?\nHow do others manage the trade-offs between sync convenience and data sovereignty?\nI'm starting to think this isn't just a fleeting concern, but a fundamental tension in how we approach PKM. The desire for true ownership of our data and the freedom to use multiple tools seems to persist, even after trying various solutions.\nHas anyone else found themselves in this PKM pendulum? How have you reconciled these competing needs in your own systems?",
