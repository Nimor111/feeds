Around the time I left the standard way seemed to define all your effects through composing the various Monads provided by mtl. Towards the end of my time with Haskell however the consensus seemed to be forming that you really only need Reader over IO, using a sort of \"God Object\" like AppT or Env that holds all of your configurations and application state, and you would define more granular \"XMonad, YMonad, ZMonad\" types for particular effects, which the base AppT would then instance.\n Coming back I see a lot of buzz around algebraic effects, in particular polysemy seems to be the standout example. It seems pretty ergonomic, although I still have no clue how type level lists work or when they were introduced, so that's something I'll have to get up to speed on. Is this something that I should be using going forward, or is it still in research mode, and I should stick with the standard mtl for now?\n    submitted by    /u/ryanworldorder  \n [link]   [comments]",

See the readme file for more instructions.\n This should work as it is, although there is still some room for improvement. Most importantly, how to print proper umlauts instead of escape characters in the files and how not to surround strings with \"\".

We have had some success via this subreddit in the past, so the content of this post may ring a bell to some.\n Chordify is a music platform that you can use to automatically detect the chords in any song you like. This way we help musicians to play all of their favourite music in an easy and intuitive way. You can try it at https://chordify.net\n Now, the backend for our website and apps, that are used by millions of people worldwide, is written in Haskell! We serve the user using primarily Servant, Persistent and Esqueleto. We also make use of a custom Redis caching layer; you may know us from https://hackage.haskell.org/package/redis-schema\n We are looking for a new proactive, independent and creative functional programmer to improve the Chordify backend infrastructure, core technology, and launch new ideas to join our team of experienced developers in our offices in Utrecht or Groningen. You'd get the opportunity to work with advanced type systems to power a website that serves millions.\n More information (e.g. expectations, salary range, secondary benefits) and a form to apply can be found at https://jobs.chordify.net. If you have any questions, feel free to ask them in this thread, or reach out to me at [menno@chordify.net](mailto:menno@chordify.net) \n We strive for diversity in our team, and encourage people of all backgrounds and genders to apply.\n For transparency: this is explicitly NOT a remote job. We do allow working from home, but expect our colleagues to be in the office at least 50% of their time.\n    submitted by    /u/Luchtverfrisser  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I'm relatively new to Haskell programming, so please don't be too harsh if this is a silly question.\n There's a particular behaviour I'm accustomed to in vscode with other languages that Haskell's extension doesn't seem to provide, and I'm curious if any solution is available.\n In most languages, when you type out a functions name and then type the opening bracket for the function call, you get a popup showing the function signature, as well as the name of each function parameter as you type.\n In Haskell, you only get the function signature popup when you're typing the name of the function itself, so you have to memorize the order of the function parameters, then go about actually typing them out. Sometimes, when there's an error over a function, you don't even get the popup when you hover over the function name, meaning you have to go elsewhere and type out the function name to check the order of its arguments.\n Some of this annoyance seems to be down to a fundamental incompatibility between Haskell and vscode; vscode expects a C-style language, where function calls are characterized by brackets, so can't understand function calls without brackets. It also obviously can't give parameter names, since parameters in Haskell can have multiple names because of pattern matching.\n Is there any solution to this issue, or is it just an annoyance you have to deal with?\n    submitted by    /u/ZestyGarlicPickles  \n [link]   [comments]",

Serokell has developed an online testing platform for administering practical and theoretical Haskell problems. Haskell is a complex language, offering a wide range of techniques and features for programmers. It’s simply not feasible for a novice or intermediate programmer to master them all. The goal of the Haskell certification is to help standardize what it means to ‘know Haskell’ at various levels of experience.\n As a community driven effort, we are soliciting self-nomination for volunteers to take part in the organization and decision-making around the certification process. These volunteers will help determine how the certification process evolves and which questions are relevant to the various experience levels of a Haskell programmer. Volunteers from organizations that use Haskell professionally are especially welcome.\n Please send your self-nomination to certification@haskell.foundation by the end of July 10th 2024.\n    submitted by    /u/jmct  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I'd like to announce a new release of csound-expression on hackage. The CE is a music framework for haskell with focus on ease of use and feature rich as it rides on top of the powerful audio programming language Csound. It is a DSL to build Csound programs. So the library embeds Csound in Haskell. \n It's a bug fix release. Many algorithms in the low-level renderer csound-expression-dynamic were rewritten and fixed. In the previous version unforunately there were severe bugs in effectful expressions and in if-then-else blocks. But now they are fixed. \n Also I've updated the library to include new Csound opcodes (audio processing units from 6.18 version).\n Happy music making with Haskell!\n About the future of the csound-expression:\n I've started the implementation of more tiny csound-core package. It offers a missing layer of low-level building of type-safe Csound expressions. In the previous version I've created lots of abstractions to make music making more pleasant for FP style. But this layering makes it kind of hard to debug rendered code. So I'd like to create a tiny imperative style core that will allow me to debug produced Csound code. And the rest of the code should be expressed in terms of this library. I'm not there yet. I've built the core library and it turned out very well. But now I need to rewrite FP abstractions on top of it. I'm not there yet. But I hope that gradually I will make it. \n Also I plan to deprecate GUI features as FLTK was deprecated in Csound and it's not packaged with Csound anymore. I think maybe it would be better to substitute them with JS+OSC.\n Links: * github * hackage\n    submitted by    /u/anton-kho  \n [link]   [comments]",

(liftM Just) \n I'm a little confused initially, so I open my code editor and get the type annotation for lift, which makes it clear instantly: it takes a value in the base monad to produce a value in the transformed monad, with that same base and Maybe as a precursor.\n So I implement it on my own:\n lift :: (Monad m) => m a -> MaybeT m a lift x = MaybeT $ do x' <- x return $ Just x' \n My code editor suggests a refactoring here, which I end up agreeing with:\n lift x = MaybeT $ do Just <$> x \n And then the thought occurs to me that lift could be implemented generally, like so:\n lift x = MonadT $ do return <$> x \n But then the author asks, as an exercise: why is it that the lift function has to be defined separately for each monad, whereas liftM can be defined in a universal way?\n So I know I must've gotten something wrong somewhere here; but where exactly? Is it that using return makes sense in the context of Maybe, but it doesn't in some other monad?\n    submitted by    /u/cateatingpancakes  \n [link]   [comments]",

I actually wanted to earlier but got discouraged by an (at that time) very clunky tooling experience, and I also found it annoying that I had to use pragma's to for example enable exhaustive type checking (which imo always should be default). At the time I instead decided to dive into Purescript, which I have been enjoying quite a lot ever since. I have probably written somewhere around 10k lines of purescript by now. However, I feel that purescript is quite niche and has some annoying limits due to primarily running on node or in the browser. For example, I don't see myself ever doing proper parallel processing in purescript. I also feel that purescript might be more limited in context of future job opportunities. These are the reasons for which I am considering to give learning Haskell a second try.\n Much learning material seems to be targeted at OOP programmers who are new to FP. I obviously don't need the the whole FP sales pitch with my background. What I need is more something along the lines of \"I am comfortable with FP, monads, type classes and monad transformers, and now I want to learn Haskell without getting bored by the learning material\".\n I have read the excellent purescript book called \"Functional programming made easier\" https://leanpub.com/fp-made-easier.

          "description": "As a researcher who primarily uses interpreted language, I’ve recently been exploring compiled languages, especially functional languages. Right now I’m looking at Scala, and I really like its features. However, the jvm dependency, while great for some purposes (I do a lot of work in clojure), is a concern for others. One reason I’m looking at compiled languages is for building cli tools as static binaries that can be flexibly copied into docker containers, over ssh, etc.\n I’m curious how practical scala native would be for this purpose, or if I’d be better off using another language for cli tools. What if I wanted to do something that depends on third-party libraries, like image processing?\n Thanks for the help. \n    submitted by    /u/mister_drgn  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have half a year to prepare to that and to be honest I've been avoiding this as the plague because I find Scala utterly complicated. I'll dearly miss the simplicity of Go with errors as values and everything being async IO by default.\n My first question is: if you had to move from Go to Scala how it was your journey?\n Second, do you need to deal with exceptions everywhere like in Java doing Scala FP? And, how can I know which function will/can throw an exception? For example, in Scala is pretty normal to consume Java libraries, how can I know if I need to put a try/catch? \n    submitted by    /u/fenugurod  \n [link]   [comments]",

Here's an example using classic untyped actors (based on https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/current/actors.html):\n import akka.actor.Actor class MyActor extends Actor { private var num = 0 def receive = { case \"incr\" => num += 1 case \"decr\" => num -= 1 case \"get\" => sender() ! num } } object MyActor { trait Trait { def incr: Unit def decr: Unit def get: Future[Int] } class Client(ref: ActorRef) extends Trait { import akka.pattern.ask override def incr: Unit = ref ! \"incr\" override def decr: Unit = ref ! \"decr\" override def get: Future[Int] = (ref ? \"get\").mapTo[Int] } } \n This is inspired by the Erlang/Elixir style of having modules with a 'client' portion that wraps the actor's 'protocol' ie the messages that it sends or receives, in a normal class with normal methods. This 'client' class in Scala can also implement an interface which can be used by callers to abstract away the 'implementation detail' of being an actor under the hood.\n val myActorClient = new MyActor.Client(ref) myActorClient.incr myActorClient.decr myActorClient.get.map(println) \n    submitted by    /u/yawaramin  \n [link]   [comments]",

Specifically I'm looking for anything that compares and contrasts control flow driven (ie. exceptions) and data driven (unions, tuples, monads of various flavors, etc.) error handling.\n Other free food for thought: It seems like as of 2.13 the Scala ecosystem had pretty well settled into data driven error handling of various flavors. With Scala 3 there are new options on the horizon for control flow based error handling. Interestingly things like boundary break syntax for error handling in ox looks very much like monadless syntax, but works totally different under the hood.\n disclaimer: when I say control flow driven error handling, I don't mean the anti-pattern of intentionally using exceptions for control flow\n    submitted by    /u/kag0  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I'm just considering a rewrite of a webapp-server from Express.js to HTTPurple. The server does the following things:\n  \nManages user sessions and injects user auth to all requests (to resolve an issue with opening protected raw files in new tabs, which is probably a terrible idea that needs rework anyways)\n Proxies paths starting with /api to backend servers\n Interprets other paths as paths to static files and serves them, if they exist\n Finally serves index.html if paths don't match anything\n  \nAll other routing is done in the SPA.\n Why do I want to rewrite the server? There is a very fine-grained role-based authorization scheme managed by the backend. For UX-reasons, some backend responses contain a permission object with some requests (e.t. GET /api/entities/ returns { data: ..., permissions: { create: true } }.\n Setting up accounts for all possible combinations of permissions is tedious, and for some combinations/new functionality, roles don't even exist yet, so I would like to inject permissions to (some) /api/... requets after they return from being proxied to the backend. Express' imperative handler will not let me access the responses after a handler has matched, but with pure functions this should be trivial.\n So, are my use cases supported/possible with HTTPurple?

Magit has a lot of views and these views often list items that can be in turn viewed in multiple ways. This list & item interaction model has a lot of good karma with respect to both architecture and user interaction.\n I'm mainly picking on `org-agenda-list', but not using the full window width always has bad voodoo in Emacs. When I see complex agenda views with a lot of information to the right of the list of items, I think it's neat, but I also think it should be left & right window for those cases so that the functionality can be remixed and viewed in a mix & match kind of way. This is one of the main reasons I'm not building on top of agenda.\n Another reason this works with magit is because of collapseable sections for showing details of items. Vertical organization can hold arbitrary amounts of detail while left-right organization in a single window, well, this isn't a web browser. Organizing information left-right in sections and controlling reflow are likely to not obtain a good result.\n This is related to casually spiking more work on afterburner, only at the pace that I am getting value out for now.\n    submitted by    /u/Psionikus  \n [link]   [comments]",

The release is coordinated with emergency Emacs 29.4 release.\n Please upgrade your Org mode or Emacs ASAP.\n The vulnerability involves arbitrary Shell code evaluation when previewing attachments in Emacs MUA (gnus-based: at least, mu4e, Notmuch, Gnus itself) or when opening Org files.

So in exactly the same way as the SCHEDULED items are shown on a time grid now, I would like to see notes, clocks, state changes etc for all TODOs.\n If such a view is not possible, I would like to implement it. Is there any advice you can give, or a suggestion, on how I could manipulate the time grid view to display data I parsed from logbooks? I could format it while parsing in any way it is needed but the display of information on the time-grid I am not familiar with.\n    submitted by    /u/Own_Flan_3327  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "This might be kind of an obscure question, but here goes anyway:\n The LaTeX memoir document class has a nice feature to add breaks within a chapter, called \\pfbreak (plain/fancy break). What it does is add a couple of lines between paragraphs, when the break is in the middle of the page, and adds 3 asterisks to the top or bottom of the page, when the break is between pages.\n In a regular LaTeX document, I can get it to work fine, but in Org Mode, I'm struggling. The break in the middle of the page works, but if the break is between pages, I don't get the 3 asterisks.\n I figured all I would have to do is add #+LaTeX_HEADER: \\documentclass{memoir} to the in-buffer settings, and then use $\\pfbreak$ when I wanted to add a break, which seems to be somewhat right, since it works in the middle of a page.

That's simply because although it's a fork, the latter appears to be behind the former in commits. The forked code looks to be the unmodified v0.1 of the original, whereas the original is now at v0.4. But if anyone (e.g. u/github-alphapapa himself :-) ) thinks there's more going on there, and that the fork actually is the one to use, let me know.\n †† For example, in the traditional org. chart, a parent node with multiple child nodes would connect to its children using a single line with branches off it to each child (and the parent).

          "description": "Hi all, I'm currently trying to generate MkDocs from my collection of org files, to have some sort of static documentation site based off my notes.\n My approach so far has been converting org to markdown with pandoc, to then feed all markdown files to mkdocs along with some custom css.\n This seemed quite straightforward, however I soon realised there are a few caveats: - pandoc org parsing is not 100% accurate and some elements are missing (e.g.: task priorities are not parsed to their own AST element) - mkdocs extends markdown with custom syntax, this md block for instance:  ??? Drawer Lorem Ipsum  will be rendered as a collapsible drawer in the resulting html. This led me to write some custom pandoc filters, for example to convert a :NOTES: org drawer to a ??? NOTES md block.\n In all fairness, it's becoming a bit complex and there's a lot of stuff I'm not covering yet.\n So the reason for this post is to ask you for guidance about what approach to use, I see 3 options: 1. continue with the current approach of using pandoc, adding more logic/filters when needed 2. use a different, more complete, org parser and then generate mkdocs-compatible markdown myself 3. write something entirely in Elisp, similarly to projects like ox-hugo.\n I'm a bit of an Elisp newbie, so I'm not sure how feasible it is for me to tackle option 3, other than that feel free to suggest other options.\n Thank you for taking the time to read this!\n    submitted by    /u/zuegg  \n [link]   [comments]",

I am curious to get some early feedback before attempting to crystalize it.\n Fully specified, fully decideable schedules are appopriate when scopes and times are known. I can imagine people who have jobs that are relatively static find the features of vanilla org mode to be appropriate.\n However, for open-ended work, which is endemic to small companies in their high-growth and product development phase, these tools (and many, many others) fall down in a lot of ways. Most work is optional, even aspirational. The payoff of any piece or an ensemble of pieces is uncertain. The bandwidth is scarce and must be triaged. Managing is i…",

          "description": "Hello all!\n I've been using Emacs for a while so far, but there is a thing that bothers me quite a lot: dual-space CJK fonts and their alignment.\n CJK programming fonts usually provide both half-width characters (for Latin alphabets) and full-width characters (for CJK characters). Thus, when rendering, the width of a full-width characters must exactly equal to that of two half-width characters.\n This is where Emacs fails; even fonts like Sarasa Gothic (which I know that they line up nicely elsewhere) will not line up when I actually use them. This is especially annoying when editing tables on Org-mode or Markdown, since the columns don't line up.\n I've noticed for two Korean programming fonts I purchased (semteulche and hesalche) the characters line up if and only if the font height is set to exactly 110 and 120 respectively (or their integer multiples). I could repeat this process for all fonts, but in my HiDPI screen, I'd like to have my fonts taller than at least 130.\n Basically, what happens is below:\n \\\"hesalche\\\", height 120. They line up nicely.\n \\\"hesalche\\\", height 140 (which is my preferred font height). Columns start breaking up.\n \\\"hesalche\\\", height 240. 240 is an integer multiple of 120, so the columns are back straight.\n Is there a way to fix this problem?\n Here is the relevent section in my WIP configuration file.\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/rangho-lee  \n [link]   [comments]",

Also it should automatically output the current buffer to stdout and argv arguments could be easier to retrieve.\n Sure common lisp would probably be better for most answers but my brain has been trained to do things in a emacs buffer and by god thats how its gonna be!\n Long story short, lots of tweaks could be made to make elisp code shorter albeit harder to read. I considered byte compiling the code but it was actually more bytes! Maybe the solution is to use keyboard hotkeys?

          "description": "Sorry for the confusing title, but I'm having trouble describing my problem.\n I find window behavior in emacs is very difficult to understand. There are many commands that either create a new window or replace the current buffer with a \"temporary\" buffer (eg help window). And some commands simply replace the buffer in current window, some replace the buffer in the other window, still others create a new split. And when something takes over an existing window, sometimes when quitting it returns the previous buffer, and other times it removes the window altogether.\n So far I have not been able to discern a method to this madness and I am often surprised by what happens. A lot of winner-undo.\n First question: is there any underlying logic here I'm not seeing? Or is it just a free for all?\n Second question: how do you handle this? Memorize/internalize how each command will behave? Rely heavily on winner mode? Something else? \n I recently stumbled on popper.el so was thinking to give that a try.

Everyone else on my team uses Visual Studio (obviously) and the files are encoded with `UTF-8-BOM` or `utf-8-with-signature-dos` in Emacs speak. Emacs somehow wasn't reading these files properly and kept saying the encoding is ISO-LATIN-1 and would just print the BOM characters literally on the screen. I had no clue about all this except that I saw 3 weird characters every time I opened any file. So yesterday I decided to dig deep and gather whatever I can to fix this. After trying a few approaches what worked is `(prefer-coding-system 'utf-8-with-signature-dos)`. The files are read properly now and the language server is also happy. I use Sharper to build and run my project and it started failing after this change. It uses `shell-command-to-string` and others to run `dotnet` commands in the project. The commands fail with\n 'ï»¿dotnet' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.\n The first 3 characters are BOM and windows command prompt cannot handle this encoding.

However, my project does not have TS, it's an older React project in plain JS.\n Now the problem is typescript-language-server will report type errors and throw the error on some JSX components that these cannot be used as JSX components which is really annoying. Is there any way to resolve this? In VSCode for example there is an option javascript.validate.enable\": false to add to the editor config and it will not validate the JS files anymore, however, it will still provide code fix suggestions, like imports for example.\n If there is no way to do this, is there a way to at least somehow get the import fixes working or connect eglot to some eslint server if such exists instead of typescript-language-server?\n Thanks!\n EDIT: \n The eglot code-actions do not work at all, I cannot fix imports anymore. Good thing is that I was able to get both eglot / eslint reports to show up in Flycheck, but code actions do not work and it still reports the type errors as well.

However, recently I have noticed that more people recommend project.el because it is lighter and has the backing of the Emacs maintainers. Therefore, I want to give it a try.\n One confusion about project.el is how to specify a project if no version control exists.\n For example, suppose I have the following directory:\n \\---myproject | +---subproject1 | \\---.git | | Makefile | \\---subproject2 \\---.git | Makefile \n How to specify myproject as a project? Note that the myproject itself is under VC. \n By projectile, I just add a empty .projectile to myproject.\n From Emacs docs:\n  \nWhether a given directory is a root of some project is determined by the project-specific infrastructure, known as project back-end. Emacs currently supports two such back-ends: VC-aware (see Version Control), whereby a VCS repository is considered a project; and EDE (see Emacs Development Environment). This is expected to be extended in the future to support additional types of projects.\n  \nTherefore I have to write a back-end by myself? or use EDE which seems rarely used?\n Thanks.\n    submitted by    /u/chansey97  \n [link]   [comments]",

It does the job for me but I'm curious if there is a way to make full use of c-mode functionality to do that without having to write a super complicated elisp function that checks if the symbol at point is a C type and then indents it to the right column (with potential backtracking also). \n I think the short answer is probably no but I'm curious how you would deal with this if you were in my situation or/and if you personally had to do any \"hacks\" to your c-mode config to fit some project's guidelines. \n I quickly skimmed through manual, it probably has all the answers I need but nothing really stood out to me at first glance.\n    submitted by    /u/ismbks  \n [link]   [comments]",

If you have any questions or encounter issues, please report them on GitHub :)\n P.S.\n I also tested the themes using the emacs -nw command.

          "description": "Hello! I'm a writer, and a programmer. I've in the past obviously leaned towards vim for my text editing & writing, and have become very comfortable in that environment with vim movements.\n Recently I've decided to give emacs a try (as I've always wanted to), and after hearing about org-mode (& org-novelist, export with pandoc, etc) I wanted to try and move my workflow over to emacs for writing. I have a few questions though:\n What is the best way to move around a text file, in your experience? I'm of course reading through documentation, but things like sexp movement don't benefit much from prose! In Vim I could move to any line and any word with a pretty quick series of inputs: is this possible in emacs?\n What are some must haves in the config? i'm doing vanilla (please don't recommend evil--I want to experience emacs for what it is) This is specifically for writing. I know emacs has thousands of commands, and I can only imagine it has a similar amount of settings (setq's? what are these called?)\n I already have lived a long life with capslock as ctrl (started after i got a HHKB, couldnt' go back) but is there a way to use meta/alt as spacebar instead? I know I said no evil, but space as my leader key has been something of a game change in terms of ergonomics for me.\n Finally I plan on just using bleeding edge, building from source. I know theres some exciting things that have just came out, or will be coming out in 30. Has anyone had any issues using the --pgtk with wayland? It's hard to find any communication about this back and forth online (i suppose a lot of emacs folks are still on mailing lists or on matrix and not reddit/discord)\n I'll appreciate any feedback, even if it's not regarding a question.

This is fine, but also seems like it requires a lot of additional packages, also from EmacsWiki. \n Anyone ever tried these solutions? I can go searching through EmacsWiki for all the dependencies and download them if I need to, but the Git repo is absolutely gigantic to try to get small amounts of packages so a bit of a pain. But if they're the miracle cure, I'll do what it takes.\n Also open to other packages that do the job.

Now, I recently got the opportunity to change systems so, I did.\n In a new Debian 12 installation, I have my Emacs installation and, when testing Src code blocks with *:async*, I noticed that my Emacs was still being blocked. This is a fresh installation.\n What I did:\n Run a src code block from the documentation that worked on the MacOS system, but didn't in the Debian. Async should put an ID and then replace it:\n  \n+begin_src bash :session execute-asynchronously :async yes\n echo \"Execute session blocks in the background\"\n sleep 20\n echo \"Using the :async header\"\n +end_src\n  \nWhat happened:\n  \nIn MacOS, an ID is put in the results, Emacs doesn't get worked and after the 20 seconds I get the result. Works perfectly.\n \nIn Debian, Emacs gets blocked, with the message 'Executing Bash code block at position 480'.\n \n Things I've tried:\n  \nEmacs -Q for a minimal example, same issue.\n \nSearched for the ob-async github, nothing related and, no 'requirements' I may have missed, or packages.\n \nSearched the web for answers, apparently, this is not an issue that I can find logs about, and given that I am in a new installation, I'm at a loss at what else to check... \n \n At this point, I'm not sure what do debug, since usage of src code blocks is a must and, the support of Emacs in Linux should be better as I understand, for example, I don't have issues with gpg in Debian, while I couldn't configure it on MacOS.\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/MinallWch  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "org-transclusion-http is an extension for org-transclusion that lets you transclude content over HTTP. If you have pandoc installed on your system, org-transclusion will convert HTML documents to Org format and transclude them. It handles link anchors (\"fragments\") in HTML as well as Org mode documents.\n After installing org-transclusion-http, run M-x org-transclusion-add-all in an org-mode buffer containing the following text:\n # Transclude ~org-mode~ document #+transclude: [[https://ushin.org/software.org#emacs]] # Transclude HTML document #+transclude: [[https://ushin.org/software.html#emacs]] \n If you are connected to the internet and you have pandoc installed, the contents of those two files should asynchronously load, and the section of each document which matches the #emacs tag will be displayed in place of each #+transclude: link.\n org-transclusion-http is now available on NonGNU ELPA, so you can try it out on Emacs 28+ by running M-x package-refresh-contents then M-x package-install RET org-transclusion-http!\n If you have any questions of comments, feel free to email or join our XMPP (bridged to Matrix) group chat.

I use it for everything, from keeping notes, scheduling tasks to keeping bookmarks.\n Recently, after reading an article on using Emacs as a password manager through auth-info and epa packages, I started to implement it in my own workflow. \n I wonder if this is seen as a security risk for some reason. I know Emacs is open source and packages are open source but there are many packages one uses and it is not possible to audit everything even if you knew Elisp to that extent (which I don't). I am not using some obscure code but lots of some rather well known packages mainly related to org.\n I am somewhat worried that if I use epa package and decrypt some stuff in Emacs that there will be a small posibility that one of tens of packages is spying on me and may see the decrypted data. It seems like a case of paranoia to me but I'm curious to what your thoughts on this are.\n    submitted by    /u/Own_Flan_3327  \n [link]   [comments]",

Not just within a single buffer or same window - between windows, tabs and frames. \n So this is what I want:\n  \nI would be typing something in one buffer (matter of fact I'm typing this very message in an Emacs buffer), let's call it t1/w1/b1, okay?\n \nThen I would move the cursor to the top of the buffer, to fix a mistake.\n \nThen for whatever reason I would switch to another window, right next to my current window&buffer - let's call it t1/w2/b2, and then type some other stuff.\n \nThen, I would switch to another tab (I'm using tab-bar-mode) where it finds t2/w1/b1\n \n Now, is there a way to:\n  \nPressing a key to jump to the previous tab, window, and buffer? So in my case pressing the key would take me first to t1/w2/b2, pressing it again to t1/w1/b1 at the top of b1, and then if I press again - to the end of it.\n \nSeeing and using the jumps history in the minibuffer.\n \n Is there a good package that works this way? Emacs has powerful position system, how is something like this is not a thing? Or maybe I just don't know about it yet? \n Doom Emacs uses better-jumper, but it works within a single window or buffer, it can't take you across different windows, tabs and frames. And because of that, it feels super unpredictable, I never know where better-jumper-jump-backward would take me next.\n There are Evil marks and built-in Emacs markers, but they also don't seem to have cross-window-tab-frame functionality.\n What is you recommendation for this problem?\n    submitted by    /u/ilemming  \n [link]   [comments]",

Not about Emacs. Not about the packages I use. The truth is that I'm dissatisfied with myself using Emacs, mostly because I'm lazy, that's the sad truth. Emacs is not for lazy people like me. Emacs is a demanding teacher. It requires you to be focused, focused and disciplined. So I decided to completely change my approach. I stopped compulsively trying any piece of package I found on Reddit. I decided to read and study Lisp, starting from the basics, the commands and the basic architecture.\n My frustration is driven by my ignorance. Above all.\n Emacs isn't for me when I think I can find a baked solution on satckoverflow.\n Emacs is not for me if I expect to have every package well documented in detail.\n Emacs isn't for me when I think one package can solve all my problems.\n Emacs is not for me if I think Emacs can organize chaos in my head.\n But I also found the main problem in Emacs: it causes dependency.\n Once you try it you can't stop using it, you can't stop thinking about it, you can't stop trying to find new solutions. Learning Emacs must be done in an organized and programmatic manner.\n I'm not a developer, nor a programmer, I'm mostly an aspiring programmer (I use R and a little Python), but the way Emacs forces me to stay focused on what I'm doing, to organize my notes, my documents, my GTD is something new and somehow irreplaceable.\n Thank you all.

          "description": "I have released version 0.6.0 of Kele, the spritzy Kubernetes management package for Emacs. Changelog here.\n Note: This release bumps the minimum required version of Emacs to 29.\n This release introduces the notion of kind-specific keybindings. Some resources have special \"actions\" associated with them, e.g. \"restarting\" Deployments or getting logs from Pods. kele-resource now has a dedicated column for these keybindings that, when defined, are dynamically filled in based on the selected resource kind. For now, there is only one resource-specific keybinding—R to restart a Deployment. Try s-k deployments to check it out.\n https://preview.redd.it/5orkdwttqb5d1.png?width=890&format=png&auto=webp&s=c4e4da9c9ea2fc30a47556085f7c23c5e7483f5c\n In addition, individual bindings within kele-resource are disabled based on your permissions for the given context/cluster. In other words, if you don't have permission to list Pods within the selected cluster, Kele will disable the l keybinding with a helpful message.\n https://preview.redd.it/jkvqq4tuqb5d1.png?width=772&format=png&auto=webp&s=474adba750c5dffb6a8f58cb03566fc92ff4cbdf\n Lastly, this release fleshes out the resource listing functionality. Some highlights:\n  \nIn addition to opening a resource from the list view (RET), you can now also delete/kill the resource at point with k;\n The list view now shows the owner resource(s) for every list item; hitting RET with your cursor over the owner cell will instead open the owning resource;\n The list view now supports listing across all namespaces.\n  \nhttps://preview.redd.it/aiqz20qhrb5d1.png?width=1490&format=png&auto=webp&s=d0dd6d1b8e675b74bce5a16e7f844ba8cb14348b\n For more details, see the Kele documentation. As always, please open an issue for any peculiar behavior you notice, or feel free to start a discussion if you'd like to give general feedback or throw ideas around.\n Enjoy!\n    submitted by    /u/jinnovation  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "So I've noticed that recording a macro when having a special input-method enabled (say TeX) and using isearch, the macro is terminated by ringing of the bell. I've found that one of the functions called is isearch-with-input-method (isearch-x.el), and it calls exit-minibuffer; commenting out that call, even though some things behave funny, at least doesn't terminate the macro. It also works if I disable the input-method temporarily, then use isearch, and simply turn it back on if I have to input something specific to the input-method; that however rules out any searching for special characters, which isn't ideal at all. Is there a way to remedy this? It seems strange to me that one shouldn't be able to record a macro simply due to using an input method... Help greatly appreciated!

          "description": "What's the best way to sync installed package versions between different computers?\n I have been using use-package with :ensure t for a long time (with the default package.el as the backend). But I've read posts from experienced Emacs users suggesting to not do this. Instead, they recommend using package-install manually and then check ~/.emacs.d/elpa into their dotfiles repo, so that you sync the exact set of installed packages between computers. This is supposed to make the config more reproducible, since after a git pull every computer will have the same \"Emacs state\".\n This idea appeals to me, especially since I've noticed that (i) sometimes my config doesn't bootstrap correctly on new computers, (ii) sometimes package upgrades break my setup and I want an easy way to roll everything back when I need to just get work done, and (iii) I've started relying more on GitHub packages (via package-vc-install-from-checkout) and would like to avoid having to repeat this on new hosts.\n Some more concrete questions for those who follow this approach:\n  \nIf you sync your installed packages in this way, what exactly do you sync (i.e. what's your `.gitignore`)? \n I guess you *should* sync the `*.el` files, otherwise there's not much point.\n I guess you *shouldn't* sync the natively compiled {`*.eln`, `*.so`, `*.dylib`} files.\n But what about the byte compiled `*.elc` files? Are these portable across different operating systems, different processor architectures, different Emacs ports, and different Emacs major versions?\n \n After syncing, do you need to do anything special to make things work? \n For example, is `package-recompile-all` required?\n \n  \nOr is all this a fools errand, and I should instead switch tox e.g. elpaca, straight, etc.? Since I left Spacemacs and Doom Emacs some years ago, I've mostly stuck to the default package.el when I use Emacs (I regularly use Vim as well).

I use emacs as both an editor and also a \"runner\" i.e. all of my long running tasks run inside shell or vterm. I usually can find the shells that I need but, I'd like a way to group shells / text editors / direds together according to \"projects\" (and have the ability to switch to buffers/shells only within that project) In addition, I'd like these projects to be permanent and restore-able. I.e. I quit emacsclient, have projects open and associated buffers (shells and text). Then the next day I can reopen emacsclient and restore the same setup. I've tried a bunch of ways to do this (projectile, project.el, perspectives, beframe, tabmode) but can't seem to be able to find a setup that ticks all the boxes above. I'm also honestly a little overwhelmed by the choices here :D Thanks for any pointers!\n    submitted by    /u/RiceTuna  \n [link]   [comments]",

One of the ways I do this is with +default/org-notes-search (from search.el, maybe it's a doom thing? It just wraps ripgrep on org-directory), which displays two windows; a list of results on the bottom and a preview of the currently selected result on the top window.\n I don't hard-wrap my text files; I rely on visual-line-mode instead. This makes searching kind of annoying, because I can't get the preview window (the top one) to wrap long lines. The closest I've been able to get is by doing this:\n `(add-hook 'occur-mode-hook 'visual-line-mode)`\n which sort of enables visual-line-mode in the preview window... but only sometimes, and only if I click in that window to focus its buffer. I can then go back down to the results and flip through results in the same file, but when I Get to the next file I have to refocus the results buffer again.\n Anyone have an idea of how I can get this to work seamlessly?

And I am quite sure it is related to Nvidia because all the flickering goes away when I downgrade to nvidia-525. I am now on Nvidia 550 and the issue persists. \n I have an RTX2060 with Gentoo.\n After some testing, I find that all OpenGL related applications especially with lower version of OpenGL like 3.x are having the same issue. I even wrote a bunch of SDL window to render simple textures to test that. All the others with vulkan does not have the same issue.\n I have messed around with Minecraft recently, and the launcher has an option of running OpenGL on Zinc, which is an OpenGL implementation on top of Vulkan. If I run Minecraft with Zinc enabled, the flickering is gone.\n I believe Emacs is using OpenGL to draw on screen. Is there any workaround for me to run Emacs' OpenGL call via Zinc?

They used to be based on creating their own overlay, and in my forks they are configured with `:image-data-fun` with org-mode custom links. So I commented out their minor mode definition, as they are no longer relevent; previewing images is done with `org-display-inline-images` like all other custom links.\n  \nhttps://github.com/hermanhel/org-krita (used github because I want to pull-request)\n \nhttps://codeberg.org/Hermanhel/org-xournalpp (don't want to create gitlab account)\n \n story: \n I was revamping on my solution to include visual illustrations in org-mode. I passed on them 2 because they were painful to use with that custom overlay, and they make huge overlays which is hard to adjust size. I used org-excalidraw for a bit, it was great, but the export tool it used excalidraw_export does not function properly at all in my KUbuntu 24.04 environment. I see the author's demo works perfectly in macOS, so maybe it is because of different svg library(excalidraw's own svg export does not display font correctly on my machine).\n I saw excalidraw use a image-data-fun, so I played around a bit and made org-krita and org-xournalpp the same. It is kind of weird that lambda do not work when I was testing, I had to declare my own functions and use function's symbol in `:image-data-fun`.\n enjoy.\n    submitted by    /u/HermanHel  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Good afternoon, Emacsen\n I don't honestly use tree-sitter much -- my main language is well handled by the venerable vhdl-mode. However I had been using it many moons ago for a Typst document. I had all the libraries obtained, and snagged typst-ts-mode for the part where it does things with the tree-sitter output.\n I distinctly remember there being syntax coloring when I was using it before.\n I recently opened the same Typst document, and it's not doing anything with syntax highlighting. I dutifully updated Typst, the tree-sitter libraries, and typst-ts-mode and still no joy. I can turn on treesit-explore-mode and see tree-sitter correctly interpreting the code. So far, so good I guess. That's the main engine. (Also (treesit-language-available-p 'typst) returns true, so I think I'm pretty solidly in the tree-sitter active camp.)\n However I have been reading Mickey Peterson's article on tree-sitter (https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/how-to-get-started-tree-sitter), trying to make sure there wasn't some step I left out along the way. Also the tree-sitter Emacs documentation at https://emacs-tree-sitter.github.io/syntax-highlighting/. This last claims that there exists a function tree-sitter-hl-mode. I tried M-x tree-sitter- and about this time, completion offers up nothing. There are no tree-sitter functions! This is Emacs 29 and it was built with tree-sitter support so I would imagine that the basic functions would be there.\n Any ideas what went pear-shaped here? I started a ticket at typst-ts-mode's repo but I am not entirely sure if the issue is that I forgot to set something up, or if it is indeed that package.\n Thanks! I think I will remove the call to use typst-ts-mode and see if there's any difference in behavior. I THINK there's a slight snag when that buffer loads, but I'm not 100% certain just yet.

          "description": "We all know that Emacs is more than an editor. You can spend an entire life learning Emacs. It never stops and it adapts to anything you want to do with a computer. \n Using one, or several terminal emulator buffers inside Emacs can be extremely useful. What's you use case?\n As for me, one thing I do often is create a keyboard macro that gathers information from one or several shell or REPL output to place it inside text file either for documentation or to create unit-test code. And sometimes I write some elisp code to do some of that. Being able to interact with an Erlang and Python REPL for example, with the OS shell of a local or remote computer and Emacs Lisp together (including with eshell) greatly enhance what can be done quickly. \n Not all Emacs terminal emulators are made equal. I wrote a comparison table for the ones I know and what I have tested. That might be useful for others. It's here: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pierre-rouleau/pel/master/doc/pdf/shells-comparison.pdf \n  \nThis is part of a larger set, the index is accessible in the top-left corner.

I am facing the following problem: I have a structure note on Financial Reporting, and I am trying to find an efficient way to display all the contents of the links of that structure note in a single document. I currently do that by manually opening notes and copy pasting their title and contents in the end of the file. I would really appreciate that if someone could point me to a less-manual way of doing that!",

Writing ideas in the form of notes is an essential act, and hugely impacts my thinking. For example, I spent the morning writing this little diatribe. In the process, my thinking improved, but I still have a long way to go. Knowledge emerges through continuous stress testing of ideas, mostly through writing.\n★★★★★\nIn knowledge work, the Pareto Principle suggests that 20% of the activities contribute to 80% of the achievement, making it especially pertinent in knowledge management.\nInitially, whether we are zealous explorers or hesitated, confused overthinkers, the one activity that provides the most value is the habit of routinely writing notes, which are proxies for ou…",

During the last few sessions that I have been using my Zettelkasten, I have rediscovered old forgotten thoughts that have enhanced the thinking I was doing in the present.\nOne of the keys to this is that I use my Zettelkasten almost every time I have to think about some of my projects.\nFor example, suppose I'm having trouble developing a character's personality in a fiction story. What I do is create a structural note that aims to answer the question, \"What is the ideal workflow for developing the personality of a fictional character?\" In this way, the structural note is not about the specific project of that story: the thinking is decontextualized (from its original project), which makes it easier to use tha…",
