Right now I am getting it to work with just two client connections, but I would like to make that scale very soon.\n I'm mainly using jaspervdj's websocket library, which I will then serve with wai/warp. The jaspervdj's chat server tutorial forks a new process for every client connection, and have it serve that connection until it is closed, which I don't think would be as concurrent as I would like it to be. Ideally, I would like to have a way to\n  \nmultiplex sockets (like select() from C), so that I only fork to serve connections that actually have messages arrived.\n or go through sockets in a round-robin fashion, skipping the ones that do are not ready.\n  \nI'm having trouble finding a way to do this; mainly, I'm not sure how to check if a client connection has messages ready. My main concern is that receiveData is blocking (according to the docs), so there is no way to skip msg <- receiveData conn if it has to wait because it hasn't received anything yet.\n What would be the ideal/scalable way in Haskell for handling potentially a large number of long-running websocket connections?\n    submitted by    /u/Zestyclose-Orange468  \n [link]   [comments]",

For example:\n moveSlowly :: Method -> IO () moveSlowly (Move) = putStrLn \"Slowly moving forward...\" moveSlowly m = perform m \n This pattern is known as the Decorator Pattern in OOP languages.\n Is there a way for me to generalize this behavior and possibly even compose these \"overriding\" functions? For example, let's say I have another function:\n attackWithAxe :: Method -> IO () attackWithAxe (Attack) = putStrLn \"Swinging axe...\" attackWithAxe m = perform m \n Ideally I would be able to \"compose\" these 3 functions using something like\n  moveSlowly <|> attackWithAxe <|> perform \n preferring the first match found from left to right.\n  \nOne possibility is to create a record of functions where each field corresponds with one constructor. I turn perform into a record with the default implementation and then I can override each behavior at will using a record update. When I actually want to perform an action just I extract the function from the final record.\n This kind of works, but implies code duplication (ADT constructors = Record labels) and I'm not sure how to \"compose\" from left to right.\n  \nThanks to @MorrowM_ for the recommended design.

Functors are almost always explained and shown examples with the map function because obviously a functor defines it's mappable behavior when the map function is applied to it. But my understanding of functors as a type where when a function is applied to it, it morphs the underlying data and returns a functor of the same type seems to me like a map structure where the keys are the f a and the f b are the values.

That purpose could be just to understand functional programming or computer science in the abstract, yet even that eventually requires application of concepts at some level. \n There is another variant of the posted question which is, what domain was the catalyst for you learning Haskell (either because of a compelling application or just because you could)? Understanding either variant of this question can lead to a pedagogical approach focusing on teaching Haskell+application as a way to jump start intuition and to understand the language’s patterns and capabilities for newer learners and seasoned learners alike.\n    submitted by    /u/xeltius  \n [link]   [comments]",

As it's currently set up, I have test-specific dependencies (e.g., hspec etc.) attached to each test suite, rather than declared as a dependency of the compiler itself. The project is hosted on GitHub and I set up some workflows to run tests for PRs etc.\n However, I've encountered a number of pain points during the development process relating to building and testing:\n  \nCI takes a really long time to run (5min for what is still a small project). It spends most of its time rebuilding all of the dependencies. I tried cacheing it according to advice I found here, which helps with just a plain stack build step, but Stack still seems to insist on rebuilding all the test dependencies every time the action is run.\n \nstack test tries to rebuild the whole project after I run stack build, eating into local development speed. This is an open issue. The suggested workaround of building with --test --no-run-tests still incurs noticeable build time overhead because it also rebuilds all the test suites.\n \n I'm wondering if folks here have suggestions for best practices for setting up Stack projects, with respect to improving build times for both CI and local testing? Or if people could point me to well-established Haskell projects managed with Stack, that I could look to as examples?

This includes UnliftIO, which is considered \"the good way\" to do MonadBaseControl stuff, and some libraries even require UnliftIO instead of MonadBaseControl for unlifting IO.\n However, it seems that UnliftIO has zero support for Either-based error handling and ReaderT eff IO just assumes that you are using exceptions. Particularly after writing quite some Rust, I think that Either/Result is just a superior way to do error handling (specially with syntactic support or some abstractions to convert and generate error types). Unchecked exceptions in my opinion are bad, and feel like I'm back in Python-land where your program can crash at any time from anywhere without any guidance from type signatures.\n Are we supposed to forget about Either and typing and just embrace exceptions, or is there any hope in this regard? Can UnliftIO support this in any way? (I consider wrapping-throwing-catching-unwrapping Lefts more of a workaround)\n    submitted by    /u/xcv--  \n [link]   [comments]",

They are translations of Forbus and de Kleer's justification-based and assumption-based (JTMS and ATMS) algorithms.\n TMS algorithms are classic AI approaches to reasoning about logical implication relationships. Code using a TMS defines nodes representing sentences or logical ideas, and how some nodes can be used to conclude other nodes. We can also identify \"nogood\" or contradictory sets of nodes. Some nodes are distinguished as assumptions, and the TMS lets us reason about how the belief or disbelief in each assumption impacts whether we should also believe or disbelieve other nodes.\n  \nIn the JTMS, the believe/disbelieve setting for each assumption is set directly, and the JTMS maintains the believe/disbelieve status of each node based on the current assumption beliefs.\n In the ATMS, there is no setting of \"current\" beliefs. Instead, the ATMS tracks the minimal consistent sets of assumptions which justify belief in each node.\n  \nPlease do not look for beautiful and pure functional algorithms here! At this point the implementations are direct translations of the original imperative Common Lisp implementations, implemented as a monad transformer, and using STT. A non-stateful re-implementation remains an interesting idea for the (non-short-term) future! I wrote this library to give myself a bit more insight into how these algorithms work on the inside, and some deeper practice with the state thread libraries than I'd had before, but I hope you find them interesting or useful.\n  \nThe Hackage page\n The Github repos\n Wikipedia entry on reason maintenance\n A standard reference on the subject, probably available at a library near you\n  \n[Edited for a typo.]\n    submitted by    /u/jpmrst  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have a set of functions that I can use for that:\n base :: a -> [a] -> [a] base = (:) one :: (a -> a) -> [a] -> [a] one f (x:xs) = base (f x) xs one _ x = x two :: (a -> a -> a) -> [a] -> [a] two f (x:xs) = one (f x) xs two _ x = x --etc. \n However, one and two are basically identical, and also look very recursive. It feels like there should be some way to write one function that would work for all length functions, but I have no idea how that would work.\n Any help would be appreciated!\n    submitted by    /u/CoByte  \n [link]   [comments]",

Getting rid of the library or coding its functionality myself is out of the question since it's a complex library and I don't have time to redo it; also, including its whole dependency tree is not viable since it has 10 or so dependencies, and then each dependency has 10 other dependencies and so on.\n How can I make my project compile with the library while using ghc?\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/HairyPassenger6262  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm a bit FP maniac and cannot imagine myself getting back to JavaScript or TypeScript. I'm super rusty with everything frontend-related, but was considering three options:\n  \nElm - I like the simplicity a lot; have some concerns about its future\n ReScript - kind of Scala's uncanny valley: on one hand semantics are very close, on the other it's just not it, having hard times to get used to syntax; among all options seems to be the most future-proof\n Scala.js - obviously the comfort zone, but no idea if it's a viable option for the frontend\n  \nMy requirements are:\n  \nI have very limited resources - so don't have time to write own libs (perhaps just bindings), which means I really want to use all JS libs possible (React, sliders, widgets etc). This is where I have the most concerns about Scala.js (scalajs-react looks great, but seems to be the only big thing ported properly) and most sympathy for ReScript\n It has to be an Electron app. Seems to be possible with all options, but wanted to raise since it means the bundle-size doesn't matter (although performance does!)\n  \nSo, my question - is it worth to try out Scala.js (with scalajs-react, I think) or go with more conventional options? With scalajs-react is it possible to integrate existing React UI components?\n    submitted by    /u/MysteriousGenius  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I’m responsible for making a performance test framework for our enterprises data layer. \n My requirements are:\n  \nThere will eventually be several “scenarios” we are interested in the performance of our application under, but starting with just one\n The scenario should be repeatable and consistently arrange the “state of the world” prior to each test to isolate performance issues to code as opposed to changes in underlying data\n Each scenario starts, should run a set of “actions” that create side effects the application should respond to. Some actions run in parallel, some serially.\n Measure certain things\n  \nI have a decent mental map of how to do everything but #3. Previously (in c#.Net) I achieved this by modeling the problem (different applications) as a graph — for example:\n Run Action A Then Run Action B, C, D When B is done kick off E When C is done kick off F When D is done kick off G\n While it seemed like the right way to go about this, it always felt unnecessarily complicated and harder for others to follow for what should of been such a simple thing. \n Other considerations: The main “performance” concerns of my application is how it responds to CRUD events in the database. I had looked at Gatling, but it seems much more focused on web-app requests and I’m not sure how it would help me to mitigate my particular performance concern \n Any advice on the SIMPLEST way to achieve such a goal?\n    submitted by    /u/Employee-Weak  \n [link]   [comments]",

This game is an MMOFPS and is being built to work with the retail client of the game with no access to the original source code. It's amazing how much the small group of devs have done in their free time to get the game to where it is now, but there are some elusive bugs that have been problematic (plus a number of features to still implement). We'd love for it to be an MMO again, but more dev support seems to be the only way to make that a possibility with limited time of the 2-3 devs.\n Here's where you could come in. The repo is here: https://github.com/psforever/PSF-LoginServer I'm not one of the devs working on the server code due to lacking those skills, but I am involved in the team and help where I can and can get anyone in touch with the right people to get plugged in and up to speed. The community Discord is also here: https://discord.gg/0nRe5TNbTYoUruA4\n How to make it sound more enticing... Do you want 100s or 1000s of people thanking you for your amazing dev skills to make this once flourishing game be populated again with players from around the globe? Do you want to see your code come alive and potentially break the Guinness World record for the largest FPS battle (current record is the game's sequel PlanetSide 2 at 1158 players)? Do you want to challenge yourself and put one more feather in your cap and resume that will definitely get you that next 6 figure gig?

          "description": "Ok, apologies for the title. \n Don't really know how to name what I'm looking for so here's an attempt at describing what I'm trying to do.\n  \nI have a bunch of case classes with N amount of vals/ contractor params. Examples: Foo(a: String, b: String), Bar(c: BigDecimal, d: Set, e: Option). And so on..\n \nI would like to have a \"rule\" or mechanism of some sort that would enforce compile time that for each companion object of these classes need to declare a corresponding val for each of it's companion class constructor parameters. \n \nLet's say I have a class ParamRules(rule1: String, rule2: String)\n \nNaive idea in my head looks like that:\n \n case class Foo(a: String, b:String)\n object Foo extends MagicMechanism(Foo) ( val a_rules = ParamRules(...) val b_rules = ParamRules(...) )\n And with that compiler is satisfied.\n If the object Foo doesn't implement a \"rule\" for one of there constructor params it fails compilation.\n  \nIt doesn't have to look like that it could be entirely different I just want to dynamically enforce this interface user to provide rule for each of the params in the class. \n  \nLet me know if I'm day dreaming, over engineering or simply having a stroke and if you need any more explanation.\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/yodlowy  \n [link]   [comments]",

The code base that supports the examples/discussion is written in scala. \n I wanted to experiment with scala and compare it to the scripting languages that I am more familiar with for this type of work (R, python, stata). Bottom line is that data science in scala is a bliss! I enjoyed mill to manage dependencies, ammonite to run investigative workflows, and smile to train/deploy statistical models. Also, writing data transforms, which is the bulk of most data science workflows, is so much easier in scala.\n I hope you will find the content interesting/useful, and I would welcome any type feedback.

My favourite language by far is Scala, mostly because of their support for FP and monads compared to the other two. I just started in a new job where I am able to decide what language to use for our new backend. I would love to use Scala, however, finding the appropriate libraries/frameworks for Scala seems like a hassle. For Java/Kotlin its a no brainer : Spring Boot.\n Because of this, I'm not sure if its worth to go for Scala even. \n I have been looking at:\n Rest api:\n Play - No support for Scala 3 yet?\n Http4s\n Cask\n Akka http\n DI:\n No library - Cake pattern (or any other way without any library)\n MacWire \n Datebase access:\n Quill\n Doobie\n Slick\n ScalikeJDBC \n Trying to find out what we should choose is giving me a headeache. In my earlier job we used\n Akka Http, Cake pattern and ScalikeJDBC, but I don't want to use this stack just because I have experience in it. For example, a quick google search has shown me that the cake pattern really is not a good way to do DI (although I personally didn't have any strong problems with it, although it did became a little bit messy when the code base grew big). It just seems much simpler just to pick Kotlin + Spring boot.\n What do you guys think?\n    submitted by    /u/just_a_random_it_guy  \n [link]   [comments]",

Most of it 'just works' <3 However, there are some things I am not able to figure out and I was wondering if the more experienced folk here might have a tip or two. Some issues I am facing:\n  \nThe headings do not get anchor links. The README is quite long, and I would really like to have anchor links and perhaps even some sort of a TOC.\n \nI cannot figure out how to create internal links. For instance, [[*heading 1][heading link]] does not work.\n \nMore an annoyance than a limitation: I am using inline-code markup for commands like mv ~/xyz ~/abc. The markup for this would be ~mv ~~/xyz ~~/abc~. This is not rendered correctly by gitlab. \n \n I would be very grateful for helpful links, tips, and suggestions. \n Cheers!\n    submitted by    /u/mmiri-ifuru  \n [link]   [comments]",

Pressing C-c C-x C-o tells me so...\n Another small but quite annoying change is that on starting the capture I get a prompt to select tags.

          "description": "Most of us are familiar with tree-style thinking that org-mode seamlessly enables, where a parent node has an infinite amount of tree children. From a gardening perspective this works great if you're not breeding and instead just saving seed, as you can structure the data as follows, where each subheading is a genetic descendant of the parent:\n ​\n ** San Marzano Tomato\n :PROPERTIES:\n :WHATEVER: WHATEVER\n :END:\n *** Plant 1\n :ID: sjkjlfkjh\n :YIELD: Xlbs\n [inline image]\n notes\n *** Plant 2\n :ID: oijiohiuhi\n :YIELD: Ylbs\n [inline image]\n notes\n **** Plant 2, Gen 1\n etc\n ​\n So I use emacs and org-mode for everything (of course), and being able to snap pics and add properties on the fly would be AMAZING for organizing anything cultivation related with minimal friction/overhead. Where organization and documentation tends to be most important is in breeding, and I'm unsure how I'd represent say a San Marzano and Roma cross elegantly. Of course I could create a new tree for each cross, but I recall reading org having some functionality (probably using tags and unique ID's) to make this seamless or somehow superior, I believe it was presented as a sort of directed acyclic graph using tags. Using org-mode at all for this would be great since HTML exports would be a freebie.\n ​\n This isn't complicated, but I'm just wondering how you might organize something like this so I don't have an 'a-ha' moment later and decide to restructure everything (but who am I kidding.. that's half the fun). I'm sort of thinking a tree per cross may end up best, since it'll work most naturally with org-mode, and the top level node can include inline images of each parent in the cross, and properties like :ID-FATHER:, :ID-MOTHER: etc.\n    submitted by    /u/AphexPin  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I have been using org-noter to read epubs in org-mode, which works fine until recently. When it is a pdf file, everything still works as before. However, when it comes to an epub file, org-noter will not work. I'm not sure why this happened but didn't want to bother to dig into this issue because it is not the first time this package breaks down on me. Consequently, I need to think of a different way to read epubs and take notes in org-mode. Since I already use calibre to manage my ebooks, my new workflow simply combines using calibre links and xdg-open.\n The native ebook viewer in calibre allows us to export links to specific locations in the book. The link looks like \"calibre://view-book/someid/somefomat?open_at=somelocation\". Using xdg-open with this link opens the specified book at the exact location. The default viewer enables highlights and other annotation methods, which is also a plus. So all I need to do is to add a new link parameter for \"calibre\" in org mode and define a follow method. Below is a snippet.\n  \n(org-link-set-parameters \n \"calibre\" \n :follow 'my/calibre-follow \n ) \n (defun my/calibre-follow (path) \n (call-process \"xdg-open\" nil 0 nil (concat \"calibre:\" path)))\n  \nIt is a very simple implementation but it does the job. If you have a similar workflow of reading ebooks and taking notes, maybe this can help. Feel free to add anything.

          "description": "Hi,\n Recently a weird orange marker (like an orange ball) started to show up in the thin grey bar in the left margin next to newly-capture tasks. The orange ball survives a refile to elsewhere, however if I use \"Alt-up\" to move it in the org hierarchy, the orange ball disappears.\n Any ideas what this is? See screenshot.\n Thanks!\n https://preview.redd.it/44fetbpxtvs81.png?width=607&format=png&auto=webp&s=b108084af7e4719fbc736a8ba901a62b77c21367\n    submitted by    /u/Individual-Cookie586  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I've read the topic about Emacs being a user friendly and how it's userbase is low compared to vim (3% to 25%). I know Emacs is a powrful tool, I use it org on my phone, dired, its shell, vterm, etc. But, I got to this point because when I, 6 years ago, migrated from Windows, wanted to have all my tools to be open-source. To get the basic functionality on Emacs, like select, copy, paste, you have to learn its special keybindings. I know you do that in vi/vim too. But, focus on Emacs being friendly and then users being able to explore lisp and expand their configuration. Make Emacs a 'bait', kind-of mentality. \n There are a lot of starter configs, but none currently compares itself to an modern IDE, doesn't make org-mode feel like Typora or some paid/closed application, but Emacs has the potential. \n The last point made, I know there are, at least brought up in the discussion, how the GUI app was made and how it functions, that makes it limited in many aspects. We have hooks, like after-change-major-mode-hook, so we can have diffrent UI depending on the major mode (one for org, python, c, etc), and get inspiration from ides. \n And, lastly, all of this together, except for the architeture for the GUI, may make users think that Emacs got lost somewhere. We all know that we love Emacs because it can be what we want. All of us got an all white screen and made it ours, behave like we wanted. How enabling cua-mode(brought up inthe discussion) can change this? Imo, users simply would have a better start in UI, but get all the expandability that Emacs has.\n ​\n Anyway. I did some lisp to get my functions, I write my articles in org, but have no time to thinkering about it.\n    submitted by    /u/ProjectFresh9279  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "In the official docs on keybinding conventions, https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Key-Binding-Conventions.html it says \"Don’t define C-c letter as a key in Lisp programs\", and while \"C-x\" isn't mentioned, my understanding is that anything beginning with \"C-x\" is reserved for Emacs itself. It also states \"Sequences consisting of C-c followed by any other ASCII punctuation or symbol character are allocated for minor modes\".\n However, many downloadable packages provide functions that are intended to be globally accessible, independently of major of minor modes. Many packages that I use, such as Magit, rg, projectile, suggest global keybindings to access their functionality (or even provide functions that will set \"default\" keybindings in the sacred \"C-c letter\" space!)\n These are all over the place - Magit uses \"C-x\", Tide uses \"M-,\" and \"M-.\", and so on. The most common case seems to be, the package recommends binding some functions to key combinations in the \"C-c letter\" space, but doesn't actually perform the binding itself.\n I'm wondering if there have been any discussions of this topic in the emacs community, and if there is any consensus or tentative directions proposed.\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/_just_the_anus_  \n [link]   [comments]",

But that implementation wasn't generic enough to support more planned features in ox-hugo.\n I prefer TOML over YAML (but that's a discussion for another day) and so I decided to pick just that and develop a generic library that would convert Lisp data to TOML. That was roughly a week back when I wrote this post: https://scripter.co/defining-tomelr/.\n Fast forward to today; I ended up creating tomelr.el and I wrote about it in https://scripter.co/presenting-tomelr/.\n The end-user wouldn't typically care if the front-matter was in TOML or YAML because that front-matter is mainly for Hugo's consumption. But it would be more of a ox-hugo maintenance headache if I were to keep supporting both.\n And so YAML support will be going away ..\n ox-hugo v0.11.0 Release\n https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/releases/tag/v0.11.0\n Why am I posting this here?\n If you are an ox-hugo user and set org-hugo-front-matter-format to \"yaml\", try removing that customization (or set it to \"toml\") and see if the latest version of ox-hugo causes any problem for you.\n Theoretically, it should make no difference in the final website created by Hugo.

So I could use, for example:\n (define-key org-mouse-map (kbd \"C-l\") 'org-open-at-point) \n This means that I can use C-l to open a link. But if the point is not on a link, C-l will does its original function. This works as intended.\n However, it doesn't work if I try to use an evil keybinding which is only active in normal mode:\n (evil-define-key 'normal org-mouse-map (kbd \"RET\") 'org-open-at-point) \n If it worked, I could use RET to open a link when I'm in normal mode.\n Some additional info: if the point is on a link, and I execute (evil-normalize-keymaps), then RET starts to work, but it will try to open links everywhere, not just on links. If I execute (evil-normalize-keymaps) when the point is not on a link, then RET doesn't work afterwards. So it seems that (evil-normalize-keymaps) is affected by where the point is.\n Is this a not-implemented feature of evil?\n    submitted by    /u/geza42  \n [link]   [comments]",

This is the successor of the pdf-continuous-scroll package. Making it a new package (instead of an update), was necessarry because this package provides a general 'display engine' which can be used also by other packages, like doc-view.\n Besides having extracted the 'display functionality' into a separate package, the code and functionality of the engine has been simplified, so that it is (even) easier to understand and maintain, and also it should increase compatibility with complementary packages (like pdf-tools and doc-view).\n The engine works very fine, although I would be very happy if anybody has an idea for a solution of the remaining (minor) issue described in the README. It seems to be working quite well also with most/all pdf-tools-modes, although it is not straightforward to make everything work flawlessly.

There's also the bufler package that I want to try, but it's not installing properly from MELPA, so I'm still looking for a good solution.\n My current workaround is to work in different frames, and use projectile-switch-to-buffer, but sometimes it would be good to quickly switch in one frame.\n Appreciate any help and suggestions.

          "description": "I'm currently learning both emacs and webdev. I'm trying to not go too far down the emacs configuration and customization rabbit hole out of the gate so that I can actually progress on the odin project. But its too intriguing to not build out some automation and QoL implementations. \n A recent fix I implemented showed me the power of being able to quickly customize built in or added package functionality to be what I want it to be. But it raised the question on best practices for doing such things. \n The example in question was navigating tags with web-mode and emmet-mode both enabled. There is some built in navigation for elements but I found one bit confusing/inefficent.\n ex: \n I use ul>li*5 to make a list with 5 items in it. It smartly jumps between the first <li></li>. I enter some text and use \"C-c C-e n\" to move to the next element. But its at the start of the next element i.e. before the < in <li>. So I wrote a very quick and dirty macro in lisp and bound it to \"C-x t\". You can see that very crude and terrible implementation below. \n My core question here is whether such an implementation is better as a macro that calls the web-mode-element-next command and makes adjustments from there or is it better to just go in and make changes to web-mode-element-next and call it normally. Granted I'll utimately make a better solution that moves the point to the end of tag after > probably finding the character with regex or something. I just don't know lisp well enough yet. \n ​\n My next-tag function - very crude just showing a code structure sample.\n (defun next-tag() (interactive) (web-mode-element-next) (forward-char) (forward-char) (forward-char) (forward-char)) (global-set-key (kbd \"C-x t\") 'next-tag) \n    submitted by    /u/timmymayes  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I realize Evil vs. traditional emacs bindings is a thoroughly discussed topic. I'm currently poring over numerous discussions in a search of this subreddit. But one discussion I haven't seen is what set of bindings is best supported/implemented outside of the standard text-editing experience. The discussions naturally tend to focus on which bindings are better for each user for editing text. But what about for everything else? \n For instance, qutebrowser is a fantastic web-browser built for keyboard focused input. It uses vim style bindings natively, but can be configured to use emacs style bindings (and there exists a community maintained configuration file to do just that). A possible issue however with attempting to use emacs style bindings for qute browser is that any features you do use, such as god-mode, might require significant manual configuration to implement. Firefox has addons for vim style experiences (I haven't found an up to date and not abandoned addon for an emacs style experience in firefox). \n Emacs has its functions for almost everything, including email clients, terminal/shells, and file management. These would naturally tend to be best supported using traditional emacs bindings, because in my experience, evil-mode, while fantastic, often lacks somewhat in documentation for the various things it's implemented in. But dedicated applications may offer support for features not easily replicable in emacs currently. \n Overall, this seems like something of a wash so far. but perhaps I'm missing something.

I need to override that. I need to find a way to change the value in that slot and then pass the structure to a function, essentially \"deceiving\" that function.\n Let's say I have:\n (cl-defstruct (toy (:constructor toy-create) (:copier nil)) (color nil :read-only t)) \n Somewhere within that third-party package, it creates an instance of toy, e.g.:\n (setq stupid-toy (toy-create :color 'red)) \n Now, let's say I need to change :color to 'green and pass this \"new object\" into some function.\n I'd try overriding slot-accessor function - toy-color, right before calling that function:\n (cl-labels ((toy-color (x) 'green)) ;; now, whatever within (break-it) asks for toy's color, it should be 'green, right? (funcall 'break-it stupid-toy))) \n It seems that doesn't work. My fake toy-color fn doesn't get called. Maybe because :color is read-only?\n What are my options here? I cannot use copy-toy because copier-fn is disabled (see above) Can I create a new struct type that inherits from toy through :include option, but :color no longer read-only?\n How do I create/clone a new struct from the old one?\n Remember, in my example, the struct has only one slot; the real struct type that I'm dealing with has over dozen of slots - I need to find an elegant way of cloning the struct, changing a single slot value and keeping remaining slots intact.\n    submitted by    /u/ilemming  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I made a deep dive into Emacs, Orgmode, and Elisp in 2020 and migrated almost all of my writing, editing, and task-management tools to it. Spent a significant amount of time learning the ins and outs of it.\n At some point I was tempted by shiny tools like OmniFocus (a fantastic tool, no doubt), Nisus Writer, Roam Research, and some more.\n After some time I realized I have isolated islands of tools not inter-operating, and I have little to no control over these tools, at least not in a consistent way (JavaScript in Roam, Apple Script and JS in OmniFocus, etc).\n So again I came back to Emacs + Org two weeks ago, having left it for several months. Now, as if my mind has been digesting all the infos that I have accumulated the months before I left it, I suddenly feel like all pieces fall together, I am quickly hacking Emacs Lisp for my workflow automations, my fingers are flying over the keyboard (using Karabiner Elements and \"God Mode\" https://medium.com/@nikitavoloboev/karabiner-god-mode-7407a5ddc8f6) and I get sooo much more done in a way not possible by the other tools I used! Everything is connected to each other now: My writing, documenting, my task management, my text editing and every bit of a text tranformation. This is such a wonderful way to get things done.\n Thank you to all the maintainers of Emacs, Orgmode, and all the wonderful packages like ivy, counsel, org-ql, and many more!\n Also, I am very happy with this community, that has helped me get a better understanding of the ins and outs of Emacs and Elisp.\n    submitted by    /u/pragmat1c1  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello,\n Recently my Emacs got automatically updated from 27.1 to 28.1 (thanks Snap!) and oh boy am I regretting this.\n First, I had to re-install use-package because none of the packages seemed to work. Then I had to update all of the packages. Then Emacs almost took my system down with CPU usage because it was apparently recompiling packages without letting me know in either the messages or warnings buffers. Together with a bunch of stuff in between made this a fun adventure.\n Anyway, I'm lucky that people over at the Emacs Matrix room were able to help out, otherwise I'd be very much dead in the water. Especially considering my newness to Emacs.\n However, as the title says, there's still one issue remaining that irks me to no end. Emacs has lost the ability to collapse/expand headers of org-mode files. It could be a conflict between evil-mode and org-mode, but how do I tackle this? I have no idea.\n When I did C-h k <Tab> under an org file heading, I got this description:\n TAB (translated from <tab>) runs the command evil-jump-forward (found in evil-motion-state-map), which is an interactive native compiled Lisp function in ‘evil-commands.el’. It is bound to TAB. (evil-jump-forward &optional COUNT) Go to newer position in jump list. To go the other way, press C-o. \n I don't consider having a huge or complicated config, so I'm not sure why the breakage happened like it did. If you have suggestions for future-proofing my config so that above disasters don't happen (or at least the chance of them get minimized), then please do let me know. Here's my init.el\n Thanks in advance.\n Edit:\n Thanks to @yantar92:matrix.org I think I know the root cause: https://github.com/emacs-evil/evil/issues/1604 - Seems like Evil-mode is not yet fully adapted to work with Org-mode in Emacs v28.

          "description": "I've run into this issue in a few recent elisp experiments. I want to use format strings with custom expandos to represent points of key-value data (that is, I want to print a formatted string from a object which has keys and values, like a bibtex entry).\n Normally I could do this with format-spec, and associate certain keys in the original object with certain expando letters. But often the data I am formatting either has many fields (more than 26, so a format-spec gets unwieldy), or has a few core fields common to all data points, but could have any arbitrary fields beyond those (so it is impossible to assign expandos to all field names). Biblatex entries for example have a reference key, 133 defined field names, and facility for users to define and use whichever fields they want! Even expandos for a-z, A-Z and 0-9 wouldn't cover all that.\n On the assumption that the field names are always unique within a single object, a good solution to this might be somthing like format \"%(field-name-1) -- [%(field-name-2):%(field-name-3)]\", so as to print something like foo -- [a:b]. The idea is that the expando names (field-name-1, field-name-2, etc.) are programmatically checked against the entry (or against a list generated programatically from the entry), so there is no need for an explicit list of expandos like format-spec uses. I think I have seen a few packages do things like this before, but can't remember exactly where.\n Is there a standard way to do this?\n TIA!\n    submitted by    /u/Jack-o-tall-tales  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "This question might sound provocative but it isn't my intention. I'm genuinely curious why emacs has the concepts of \"major\" and \"minor\" modes. \n I'm no elisp guru but to me it seems that a minor mode can do everything a major mode can: they both have hooks, key bindings, custom variables, etc. The only real difference AFAIK is that major modes are mutually exclusive. And even the latter wouldn't be hard to implement for minor modes by adding something like a boolean variable is-mutually-exclusive or a parameter. Yet the separation increases code complexity by separating the two and adding little idiosyncrasies to each.\n Moreover, the distinction introduces undue cognitive overhead by having us think of a mode as being the \"main\" or \"most important\" one in any given context. Why is that? Why e.g. should I think of js-mode as being somehow more \"major\" than lsp-mode even though the latter is the main driver of my editing process? It feels like maybe major and minor modes were abstractions designed to guide the process of creating packages but nowadays I see that as doing more harm than good.\n So, why not treat them on an equal footing? Do away with major and minor, and just have modes. To me it would decrease code complexity and reduce the cognitive overhead. But I'm not the expert here so I'm really curious about what you think about all this.\n    submitted by    /u/M-x_  \n [link]   [comments]",

After looking around for a function that does that I couldn't find it, so I thought a good training might be to try to write it from sratch. I came up with:\n (defun inwit/replace-org-link-description (link new-description) (setq content-start-point (org-element-property :contents-begin link)) (setq content-end-point (org-element-property :contents-end link)) (setq len-thing-to-remove (- content-end-point content-start-point)) (setq len-thing-to-add (length new-description)) (setq offset-delta (- len-thing-to-add len-thing-to-remove)) (delete-region content-start-point content-end-point) (goto-char (+ content-start-point offset-delta)) (insert new-description) ) \n However, this doesn't quite work, especially if it is run sequentially over several links in a buffer, because the substitutions (both the deletions and the insertions) start missing the correct spots after the first replacement, which works fine. What is happening here? I know that delete-region leaves the point where it should, and I thought that also insert does place the point after the insertion. However, I don't see how sequential calls to this function in a map loop can miss the right spots after the first one. It's like the numbering of the positions in the buffer does not update with my substitutions.\n In other words, is there a way to update the buffer so the following calls to my function can refer to the actual positions of the already modified buffer? Or, am I missing the point and there is a much better way to approach this task?\n    submitted by    /u/inwit_  \n [link]   [comments]",

Specifically, git couldn't read my global config file. However, if I ran git from a non-Emacs terminal everything worked properly.\n I did a little research and learned that Emacs sets the following two environment vars:\n shell GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL=/dev/null GIT_CONFIG_NOSYSTEM=1 \n These settings make git ignore my global config. Hooray for a problem half solved! Now I need to figure out how to un-set these variables in an Magit-friendly way.\n What I've Tried\n  \nAfter unsetting these variable in a shell session in vterm I can use the git command again but magit is still broken. \n I also tried unsetting those environment vars in the script that I run to launch Doom but that didn't work.\n Finally, I also read in the FAQ that I should try exec-path-from-shell, which I am already using. I tried executing the exec-path-from-shell-initialize function interactively but that did not seem to help.\n  \nDoes anyone know how to configure magit to unset these variables?\n System Information\n  \nWSL 2\n Ubuntu 20.04\n Latest version of Doom (as of 4/4/22)\n Emacs 28.1\n  \n   submitted by    /u/tompurl  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi, one of the main challenges I have when writing elisp is that I can't use edebug effectively.\n I write python during the daytime, and as flawed as Python (and its debugger) is, I have managed to create a comfortable workflow with dap-mode:\n  \nSet a debug point\n Run the debugger until it hits the breakpoint.\n dap-hydra shows a bunch of useful keybinds\n dap-ui-repl pops up, which lets me interactively try out expressions, inspect variables, and more.\n  \nMeanwhile, the current state of my elisp debugging is:\n  \nedebug-defun and (optionally) set breakpoint. However, the breakpoint is not visible in the buffer, so it's easy to lose track of.\n Run the function until debugger stops the execution. At this point, a new keymap is introduced with binds I don't know, that overwrite many of my regular keybinds. They can be inspected with ?, it's just a bit... jarring to have half your keyboard change meaning.\n edebug-eval-expression can be used to open a minibuffer to evaluate expressions. It's kind of nice, but it's not a replacement for a proper window repl as it doesn't show history. I often want to evaluate an expression, and look at the result as I'm evaluating the next expression.\n  \nApparently ielm and running eval-defun is one way to get the workflow I want, but I'm having some issues there (probably related to my config). There is some discussion on it here: https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/36918/edebug-repl-ielm\n All of my issues can be solved, and I think ielm is the way to do it, but this just makes me wonder: How do experienced elisp programmers use edebug? It doesn't seem standard to rely on ielm.\n    submitted by    /u/ntwmbc  \n [link]   [comments]",

However, upon doing so, I received the following warning whenever Emacs attempted to compile any file:\n Warning (comp): C:\\Users\\<omitted>\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\\\libgccjit-554575/fake.s:4: Error: junk at end of line, first unrecognized character is `\"' Disable showing Disable logging Warning (comp): C:\\Users\\<omitted>\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\\\libgccjit-554575/fake.s:4: Error: file number less than one Disable showing Disable logging Warning (comp): c:\\emacs\\bin\\libgccjit-0.dll: error: error invoking gcc driver Disable showing Disable logging Warning (comp): <filename>: Error: Internal native compiler error failed to compile Disable showing Disable logging \n (Where <filename> is the name of each file Emacs attempted to compile, of course.)\n Curiously, when I launch Emacs from MSYS2 MinGW (64-bit), the errors disappear, and Emacs is successfully able to compile all files. What is going on here, and how may I fix it? All I know at this point is that the problem is probably unrelated to the dependencies to libgccjit.dll: using dumpbin libgccjit.dll /dependents revealed that Emacs’s bin folder already contains all dependencies of libgccjit.dll.\n    submitted by    /u/brdrcn  \n [link]   [comments]",

Reading the docs for org-startup-truncated, I expected this to make org mode respect the default.\n Does anyone know what might be causing this? \n I also noticed that the message shown after I run M-x toggle-truncate-lines seems to be backwards (i.e. it says that truncation has been enabled when it stops wrapping)\n Edit: I apparently had a hook that was enabling visual-line-mode in org mode, which was toggling truncate lines.

          "description": "Good evening!\n I recently installed lsp-mode for the Node TypeScript project (using ts-ls) I'm working on at the moment, mainly just because I wanted lsp-rename. The problem is, it only works within src: If I rename a variable, then all files in src get updated, but not in my test directory, tests.\n A lead: If I delete .lsp-session-v1, then open a file in the test dir, then start LSP (and thus import the project) from that buffer, then lsp-rename (on a file in src) will also affect that one file in the test directory, but not others. ~/.emacs.d/.lsp-session-v1 contains no mention of the test file or dir in this case. It also doesn't work any more if I restart Emacs after this.\n I thought lsp-workspace-folders-add sounded good, but it doesn't appear to do anything except make it so that the rename doesn't even work across the files in src any more either.\n Tried renaming test to tests, didn't work. The fact that it searches src even though .lsp-session-v1 only mentions the root directory indicates that it has some fixed folder mappings. Adding more of these would probably be the best solution. But how do I do this? I'm not very advanced with this package or Emacs in general.\n    submitted by    /u/LemongrabThree  \n [link]   [comments]",

Originally the Feynman technique involved with writing your thoughts, questions that you have and things that you learn in a notebook and review them later. Using a notebook is really inefficient to me coz it's hard for me to carry around one to take notes. I used to leave voice messages to myself via my phone and later on manually transcribe them and move them to an org file to organize them.\n Finally I spend a bit of time and created a bot that converts telegram (just because it was easier at the moment. Otherwise it would be easy enough to create backends for the bot to use matrix or whatever) voice messages to org-mode entries and store them in an org-file. It's trainable as well. So one can train it to be more precise. Therefore the more you use it the more precise it can get.It still is rough around the edges and I need to feature tune it, but it is usable and I use it all the time. I thought other people might have the same needs as I have so it might worth sharing.\n Heads up though, the bot is in golang (coz I wanted to finish it up fast, but I have plans to create a native Emacs module for it to replace the golang implementation)\n The repository is at: https://devheroes.codes/lxsameer/Orion\n Also it comes with a text to speech engine (Rigel dir in the same repo) as well that spins up a tcp server and reads out anything that it receives over the socket. This one is trainable as well. Since I use Emacs as my window manager (thank you folks who made EXWM) I wrote a simple client that reads any text that i want in any program for me. Refer to the read me for more info and you can find the elisp client at: https://devheroes.codes/FG42/FG42/src/branch/master/core/cubes/rigel/core.el\n Hope you find it useful and looking forward to your feedback :)\n    submitted by    /u/lxsameer  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Edit: I think I figured it out but I'm going to leave this in case it helps someone else. The \"dimness\" of the rendered face was coming from the italic property of the face (which is not set in the face customization). All italic strings just get dimmer with any TERM configuration that doesn't support italics (like xterm-256color or screen-256color). If I set $TERM to rxvt-unicode-256color, italics actually work!\n Due to issues with WSLg in Windows 11 (a long and disappointing story), I've switched back to using emacs in the terminal. Everything works as expected, except for a couple of face colors in Org Agenda.\n Though the attribute face sample in the customize facility looks correct, the actual face is always a dimmed version of that color (and that is how it appears in Org Agenda as well). This has the effect of making the text nearly illegible in most cases, and I refuse to choose an artificially bright color here because it appears correctly on other devices.\n I have cleared all other face attributes and still this odd issue persists. I've even inspected the face applied to the preview (\"sample\") text itself in customize and nothing seems out of the ordinary.\n Why is it not displaying the color that I have chosen??\n In this image, with foreground set to brightwhite, the face sample looks gray.\n In this image, with foreground set to color-82, the face sample look like a dark green.\n I've also fiddled with the color \"themes\" of my terminal, but those settings have no effect on Emacs, it seems that Emacs is displaying exactly the colors it wants to.\n Any ideas?\n    submitted by    /u/bakuretsu  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "There are at least two fundamental ways of reading email. The first, and the one I think is more common, is to open the inbox and choose an email to read from the list. Let's call it the random access method. The other method is to open an email, preferably the oldest unread one, and when you are done open the next one by pressing a \"next email\" button. Let's call it the linked list method. \n When I read email using the random access method I frequently ignore email I feel are annoying to deal with. I also get drained of energy by having to repeatedly choose which emails to read. The linked list method on the other hand side steps both issues: I only have to make the single decision to read email and then I read the entire inbox.\n This package was born from the realization that I like the linked list method, and that I would like to handle more things this way. So what el-secretario does is that it turns different sources (e.g. org-mode todo items or RSS feeds) into linked list-style inboxes. And it doesn't stop there, it can also link different lists together so that email, org-mode items and RSS feeds come under the same unified inbox.\n Package link: https://sr.ht/~zetagon/el-secretario/\n    submitted by    /u/Zetagone  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi all,\n It's been around a year since I jumped into Doom with no prior Emacs experience, so far I've become quite comfortable with using org mode (with evil) for writing reports.\n At this point I'm really interested in learning more about emacs, and possibly starting from scratch, as I've heard it's much better for learning than a pre-rolled config.\n Thing is, the few things that I've tried to do so far often ended up breaking my thesis setup, and I'm pretty hesitant to further experiment since \"I broke my text editor, so I didn't meet the deadline\" is really not a risk I want to take. \n My goal is to somehow have a separate vanilla emacs installation/configuration, that I can just tweak from scratch, but which is totally isolated from the installation/configuration that I use to write my thesis.\n What would be a good (important: foolproof) way to accomplish this?\n    submitted by    /u/manoftheking  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi All,\n I apologize for the possibly annoying question, but I'm struggling to get Emacs 28's nativecomp to work. There are plenty of guides/posts online about installing libgccjit with Homebrew to get it to work.\n But, I've been using MacPorts for a long time and really don't have any desire to use both MacPorts and Homebrew.\n When I install any of the usual suspect Emacs packages in MacPorts (emacs-app, emacs-mac-app, etc), I get the same issue when Emacs starts up: it floods the *Warnings* buffer with stuff like:\n  \nWarning (comp): collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status Disable showing Disable logging\n Warning (comp): libgccjit.so: error: error invoking gcc driver Disable showing Disable logging\n Warning (comp): /Applications/MacPorts/Emacs.app/Contents/Resources/lisp/outline.el.gz: Error: Internal native compiler error failed to compile Disable showing Disable logging\n  \nNow, this is totally normal when GCC and/or libgccjit are not present, and a web search of these errors will find several forums posts and bug reports, etc. The Homebrew crowd just installs some specific GCC package and all is well for them.\n I pretty quickly realized that macOS's clang is aliased (or soft-linked, or something- I didn't investigate) to gcc. So, I suspected that I needed to install the real GCC from MacPorts. Since my $PATH has my ports directory prepended, running gcc from a shell does in fact call the correct, true, GCC.\n However, I suspect that Emacs still doesn't see the correct GCC when it starts up. If you're familiar with macOS and Emacs, you might know what I'm talking about when I say that I do use the exec-path-from-shell Emacs package, but I assume that it does its thing too late in the start-up process to help me.\n Does anyone know a straight-forward way to either change the GCC path(s) for Emacs early enough to matter, or just some other way to get nativecomp working with only using stuff from MacPorts?\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/ragnese  \n [link]   [comments]",

I can click on any search result on it, view/edit the target file, while in the meantime the search panel doesn't disappear. But in counsel-ag, the bottom search panel disappears when I hit the Enter or Esc key on a search result.

To begin, I am not sure what the definition of 'completion' in the context of emacs is, so I am using the term quite vaguely. It is unfortunate, but is perhaps a good indication of where my emacs knowledge stands right now. \n I have figured out that packages like selectrum and vertico shape how minibuffer suggestions appear on the screen. From the vertico page, I then moved on to consult. My current understanding is that packages like ivy/helm/consult provide enhancements to emacs commands (and perhaps also introduce some new commands) for buffer selection, register selection etc., including algorithms and interfaces for showing sensible possible options for the minibuffer prompt. \n However, where I totally get lost is company. What does company do? I am experimenting with lsp-mode, and it suggests using company. Does company also do the same thing as consult? \n Any comments and suggestions like links to pages which explain this ecosystem would be awesome.\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/mmiri-ifuru  \n [link]   [comments]",

The second idea that swirled out of the Ambassador of Cool was the notion of eufriction. @ZettelDistraction lifted it from Bob Doto2, but it would have been lost to me if he hadn't shared it here.\nBelow is a zettel I created from this interaction. I've reproduced it in its entirety so you can laugh, critique, criticize, slam, skip any part or theme in the zettel, or ignore the whole thing.\nThe numbered entries below are direct quotes from @ZettelDistraction.\nI found this along with Bob Doto's essay2, a lively ZK exercice.

          "description": "I got this book two hours ago, zoomed through and finished reading. There are some good bits here, for sure: I will certainly pay more attention to headings in my notes. Also, for the intended audience of that book---students who must study for a test, and need to learn that material---it is likely useful and a good read. I might even recommend it to a high schooler.\nThat said, my note's title is from the perspective of what utility I perceived for me.  The advice seemed pat, too cut-and-dried, proclaimed with a finality that stuck the wrong cord in me. When I read the bibliography, I found something very curious for a book from 2018: the references by decade are: 7 from 2010s, 39 from 2000s, 62 from 1990s, 50 from 1980s, 18 from 1970s. Nothing wrong with old references: I have cited 19th century books often enough and once a 17th century book in a paper in computer science, but the relative balance caught my eye.  These 80s/90s skew is curious, although a tad more explained by the original date of publication (2007). Surely more ink has been spilled on this topic this decade, some refining the cited works, others casting grave doubt on some other cited works? FWIW, I have a Ph.D. in Cognitive Science and am quite familiar with some lines of research here and which I find rather dubious (won't name names, sorry).\nSo, some good stuff here,  no doubt about it, great material for a longish blog post, but the hefty 250+ pages that it is is a stretch.\nI normally don't write bad reviews, preferring to keep my mouth shut. But this has been strongly recommended here---enough for me to purchase this---so I felt obliged to add a counter argument.  Just my 2¢.\nBest regards,\n  Abhijit",

Do you put the connections and links under a References header to separate in into different types of content?\nThe image below is an example of a note where I feel like I've managed to maintain the singular point of the note (what the concept of \"in process\" notes is in my system) fairly well but I can also see how paragraphs 2 and 3 could be seen as separate ideas to the main idea of the note. In that case, wouldn't it make sense to have that text appear as bullets under the Reference header?\nI know there's no one way to use a zettelkasten but your thoughts on the way of thinking about atomicity when linking would be helpful.\nTa!",

To make sure that I'm understood and to include all potentially important information, I'll elaborate.\nI have an outline whose filename is 202204091330 s2 Obsidian.md. It lists links in the same vein as the outline example from your post about the script. This file is in the home folder of my Ubuntu 21.10. The output of zettel_outline --version is zettel_outline 0.1.1 (2016-01-23).

At a closer look, I find the whole content of a Zettel that wasn't linked to, spread 16 times thorough it. Unlike the other Zettels, the <!-- § --> part doesn't include its unique identifier. I checked my Zettelkasten to see if its unique identifier happened to be that of another Zettel, but it wasn't the case.

What are the defining characteristics of each and how are they related according to your vocabulary?\nHow I use the terms:\nA zettelkasten is a collection of notes in which the notes are not categorised into different folders, but organised via unambiguous links between each other (and optionally tags). There is no restriction on the type of notes that a zettelkasten can contain.\nA wiki is a special kind of zettelkasten that only contains notes about objects. The links between notes are usually created automatically: a link is inserted whenever a term is mentioned that refers to an object on which there is a note in the wiki. A personal wiki would be a wiki on which only one person works, which is usually not intended for the public.\nIs that how other people use the terms as well? @ctietze's comment here suggests that that's not the case – curious as to what other people mean by it...",
