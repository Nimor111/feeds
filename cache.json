The main observation being that with by-name evaluation (e.g. in Haskell) it is not possible to define inductive data types because the data types can always contain hidden computations. This has several consequences: it is no longer correct to apply mathematical induction to these data types (at 40:00) and exceptions can occur in unexpected places (at 1:05:24).\n Robert Harper proposes a mixed system where by-value evaluation is the de…",

I started making my own DSL to do this, but writing a simplifier for algebra is not at all trivial and I suspect finding the simplest equivalent expression probably requires some kind of non-determinism/backtracking (not sure if algebra has a sensible normal form), so I've hit a 'maybe I should see if someone else has already done this' wall.\n Ideally I would like:\n  \nAn eDSL for expressions containing at least basic arithmetic, surds, and named variables (easy enough to do by itself)\n A robust simplifier (speed is not especially important)\n Num and Fractional instances (or at least the ability to make my own out of it) \n Not super fussed if they're strictly lawful or not, I'd just like to be able to use them in Num/Fractional polymorphic functions like the matrix operations in Linear\n \n  \nThe closest library I've managed to find on hackage is th-cas, which has the same sort of DSL I'd like, but a pretty half-hearted simplifier that can't really handle the outputs of any matrix operations.\n Does what I want (more or less) already exist for Haskell?\n    submitted by    /u/ratherforky  \n [link]   [comments]",

Most of the speed is achieved using a token-matching heuristic, where the similarity scores are only computed between pairs of names sharing an entire token, with token inventories being precomputed and stored in a hashmap.\n It works pretty much exactly as I want so far, but as a Haskell beginner I'm sure there are improvements that can be made, and I figured this would be a good place to ask.\n Thanks in advance!\n    submitted by    /u/osoleve  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I am following Get Programming in Haskell by Will Kurt and in Unit1 Ch.5 closures are introduced.\n Specifically Listing 5.5 shows\n ```\n genHostRequestBuilder host =\n (\\apiKey resource id -> getRequestURL host apiKey resource id) \n exampleUrlBuilder = genHostRequestBuilder \"http://amazon.com\"\n genApiRequestBuilder hostBuilder apiKey =\n (\\resource id -> hostBuilder apiKey resource id)\n myExampleUrlBuilder = genApiRequestBuilder exampleUrlBuilder \"api-key\"\n ```\n where closures are being used to make a function that at first accepts host, api key, resource, id as parameters but in the end just the resource and id since the host and api key are often redundant when making api calls to the same site.\n My attempt at the above was different but I'm able to get the correct answer, ie. a valid url to make an api request\n ```\n exampleUrlBuilder2 = exampleUrlBuilder \"my-api-key\"\n ```\n Thus it seems like this closure is overly complicated and in the process I discovered that I can create an alias for a function partially applied to one parameter?

But QualifiedDo let's you use do-notation to build non-Monads. So let's say I make a module that looks like this\n module SetDo where import Data.Set (Set) import qualified Data.Set as Set fmap :: Ord b => (a -> b) -> Set a -> Set b fmap = Set.map return = Set.singleton ma >>= mf = Set.unions $ Set.map mf ma \n And this makes everything work!

          "description": "I'm a student, and after learning Haskell in a club last year and using it extensively in a side project recently, I feel like it's currently the language I'm most comfortable with. As I prepare to apply for internships for next summer, I'm wondering if it would be a bad idea to prepare for leetcode-style questions in Haskell.\n Does anyone have experience using it in a \"regular\" internship interview? (By regular I mean ones where you don't expect to use any Haskell in the job.)\n I guess I'm worried that either the interviewer will just decline to let me use the language, or otherwise let me but still have a negative view of it. In that case I could offer to use a more mainstream language, but I'd be less practiced in it.\n But I also think using Haskell and it's type system helps me tremendously in thinking through difficult problems, so in that way I could see it as an advantage.\n Any advice from either side (interns or interviewers) would be great.

The mocks are dispatched dynamically by name and type. Only the call site and the test cases are aware of a mock, so the changes are small and never require restructuring of the application for testing.\n I wrote it to make writing tests more enjoyable and I hope you enjoy it too!\n PS: [ANN #2] to record the arguments of the function calls and expecting calls, typeable-mock needs to process the arguments and result of arbitrary functions. The solution turned out to be more general than mocks needed, so I published it as a separate library https://hackage.haskell.org/package/variadic-function\n    submitted by    /u/lykahb  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi there,\n I'm trying to obfuscate some data in a dataset to practise Haskell and I'm running into some difficulties, particularly with regards to memoisation.\n The dataset contains some IP addresses which I want to anonymise by shuffling the last octet (e.g., mapping 192.168.0.1 to 192.168.0.231) and some email addresses, where I want to tokenise the username (e.g., mapping alice@gmail.com to v38j8a@gmail.com, where v38j8a is just a string generated randomly). Importantly, these IPs and email addresses can appear numerous times, and I want to mapping to be 1-1 (e.g, alice@gmail.com is always mapped to v38j8a@gmail.com). It seems pretty clear that I need to memoize my obfuscation functions.\n I've written some parsers and such that takes care of all this but without any memoization. I'm trying to use the MemoTrie library, but I'm running into difficulty - as I'm making heavy use of System.Random, basically everything I'm working with is in the IO monad, and MemoTrie seems to have little support for that. I can memoize an Int -> Int function but not an Int -> IO Int.\n Would anyone here know how to extend MemoTrie to support the IO monad? The MemoTrie documentation for adding your own data types isn't great and it's unclear how to write a sensible implementation of HasTrie. Alternatively, I can get the results that I want in a relatively straightforward manner by just using unsafePerformIO. Is this a reasonable solution? It feels kind of 'dirty' using unsafePerformIO, but I can't immediately see any negative consequences that might arise in this setting.\n Thanks very much for any help.\n Edit: an example of using MemoTrie and unsafePerformIO to handle the IO monad can be seen here: https://github.com/ocharles/dhall-build/blob/master/MemoIO.hs\n    submitted by    /u/HHHQuestions  \n [link]   [comments]",

It would seem to me that, since ExpHist is defined by a Config with an epsilon and a windowSize, and a Vector of Buckets with a size and a timestamp, that the empty for the Monoid would be empty from ExpHist with a Config with (0L, 0L), and plus from Semigroup would start with the empty ExpHist, use a Config taking the maximum of each element from the Configs of the two ExpHists, and simply call addAll on the ++ of the buckets Vectors from the two ExpHists. This seems sound, because the comment on addAll says all timestamps in the vector being added must be >= the time of the ExpHist being added to... which, given that we're starting with empty, will be 0.\n My main question, then, regards the soundness of combining two Configs simply by taking the max of each field, especially epsilon. My intuition is \"take the greater possible error,\" but I'm not sure that's correct.\n Does anyone have any ideas here?\n    submitted by    /u/ResidentAppointment5  \n [link]   [comments]",

(see article about this: https://github.com/rssh/notes/blob/master/2021_06_27_automatic-coloring-for-effects.md )\n  \nScalaJS:\n  \nImplemented support for non-monadic objects in awaited statements (i.e., `js. Promise`) - now it is possible to use await(js.Promise) inside an async block.\n Implemented JSFuture, which looks like 'promise' from the js side, but as typed monad on scala side.\n \n  \nAlso, during the year passed from the 0.1 version, we tested it in few internal projects.\n    submitted by    /u/rssh1  \n [link]   [comments]",

There are many new ideas and Scala3 became the ingenious technology to make them happen.\n Scalqa stands for 'Scala Quick API'. It is built around fast proprietary collections, which support unboxed processing of primitive types.\n It also provides a standardized way to define opaque data based on Java primitives. Data elements naturally inherit built-in specialized collections.\n A simple J.Benchmark test\n import scalqa.{*, given} val array: Array[Int] = (1 to 1000).toArray J.Benchmark( (\"Array\", () => array .map(_.toLong).filter(_ % 2 == 0).sum), (\"Iterator\", () => array.iterator.map(_.toLong).filter(_ % 2 == 0).sum), (\"Scalqa Stream\", () => array.~ .map(_.toLong).filter(_ % 2 == 0).sum), ) \n yields output\n Final Result. Total length is about 12 secs --- ------------- ------- --- ------ --- --------- Num Name Ops/Sec % Memory % Avg Value --- ------------- ------- --- ------ --- --------- 1 Array 29.8k 30 97.6kB 100 250500.0 2 Iterator 27.3k 28 45.9kB 47 250500.0 3 Scalqa Stream 97.4k 100 517B 0 250500.0 --- ------------- ------- --- ------ --- --------- \n Memory consumption clearly indicates unboxed processing.\n The value proposition is: Scalqa is much simpler and faster than general language API. Also, one can immediately be efficient with opaque types, which otherwise would take long time to get right.\n The project feature set is complete, but any good ideas (based on feedback) will still be taken in before version 1.0 in late Fall.\n Any discussion will be appreciated, for larger questions please use the new GitHub discussions feature.\n PS. The documentation is still \"work in progress\", sorry for any inconsistencies you might come across.\n    submitted by    /u/edolgy  \n [link]   [comments]",

I decided to try new things and bought a farm and spent the last 5-6 years growing food, working outside etc. However, I find myself wanting to go back and at least pick up contracts/gigs to make some additional income, invest more into my retirement etc.\n It has been 6 years since I looked at Scala and I know things have changed since.\n A few questions: 1) what is the easiest/best way to get back in the game and refresh/catch up on everything that happened in the language? and 2) will anyone even consider me after a multi-year unrelated gap in my resume? When I \"retired\", I was at the senior level but obviously do not expect to get back at that level (no ego here).

          "description": "Hi,\n I am not a full-time developer/coder. But I have been coding for the last ~17 years.\n I have mainly used java. For almost a decade I did not even use a build tool other than ANT and used Netbeans. Then I shifted to maven.\n Now I want to shift to Scala 3. That requires changing the build tool also.\n I don't have a problem when it comes to Scala. Somehow I am not still comfortable with the build tool. I feel I would prefer either mill or Maven, over SBT. Mill because it is said to be faster than SBT and seems more powerful. Maven because it seems to provide the maximum support amongst all build tools in the JVM ecosystem. For example, the Gluonvm plugin works fine on maven, the Gradle plugin is still a mess, and I am not even sure about the status of this in SBT or mill.\n Q1) Do you think it is good to use maven to work with Scala while I captch up and become more familiar with the scala ecosystem. Is it even possible? Workable? Sane?\n My requirements are simple - simple maven projects, quarkus, javafx, gluovm (with graalvm build support). I have some legacy java code I wish to maintain, this is impoart for time being. So if I can universally use the same build tool for java also, it would be nice. \n Note: Wire (a mobile messaging app) seems to be experimenting with scala and JavaFx, and their build tools seem to be maven: https://github.com/makingthematrix/scalaonandroid/tree/main/HelloFXML3 \n tagging /u/makingthematrix \n Q2) If not maven, then SBT or Mill, which one fits the above more. My personal bias is more towards Mill, but it has a much smaller ecosystem, so I wonder if it will provide anything close to out of box support for Gluonvm for example.\n ​\n Thanks a tonne\n    submitted by    /u/ivanvelikanov  \n [link]   [comments]",

Or simply - what would you recommend?\n From what I've explored just messing around, Play, Scalatra, Jooby, Vert.x. Thinking of a FastAPI/Flask/Falcon equivalent ideally.\n How do you find Java interop generally? Is it as simple as using a Java library from Scala?\n In a similar vein, what's your preferred database interaction library? (I Love SLQAlchemy Core in Python, and Dapper in .NET).\n I'm also very very curious, coming from Python originally, how you think the migration from 2.x to 3.x will go. (Especially in terms of timeline). Python 2 to 3 was long and a bit painful, but from everything I've read it should be a faster and more comfortable transition for Scala.\n Lastly - it seems SBT is still the tool of choice? Are build times still tricky even with Scala 3? Is it worth hanging around for those to improve, or looking into Mill, or trying to get Gradle to play nice?\n My goal is to dive in and get familiar with the Scala world, but also, evaluate it for use at work.\n Warm thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/DanManPanther  \n [link]   [comments]",

I feel this isn't the best workflow, especially if I end up jumping immediately onto another call.\n This usually isn't a problem, but I've actually been travelling a bit over the last couple of weeks, and as it happens, I've left a number of important handwritten notes (incl interview notes) back in my home office.\n This has caused me to reflect on how I work. I've realised, particularly for interview notes, but also other types, that it would suffice for me to just take a photo and embed that into org.

Let me paint you a picture: I'm a CS major who wants to do research. I read a lot, and I'm expected to write a lot. In the past year I worked into getting those things in Emacs (and for 95% of the cases I succeed). Although it all became centralized around org-mode, I realized those systems never gave me feedback, like \"how much did I wrote today\" or \"I spent X time reading those stuff\" or, more simply, \"I did Y tasks today, and Z this week\". Once a task is done, she is just gone into the void.\n More recently, through some amazing work of karlicoss, I discovered the whole #quantifiedself and wondered how order may see this and/or solve this problem?

          "description": "Hello!\n I'm fairly new to org-mode, and have just been familiarizing myself with the basics for the past few days. After going through some excellent posts, I decided to try out org-mode for taking down and organizing lecture notes, and thought I could first try it out on a MOOC that I am taking.\n Now to the real question. As someone who has always taken down notes on paper using a pen, I do not plan to move away from it, and infact would like to org-mode to supplement it. Being a grad student in Computer Science, and Engineering, I realize that apart from taking down notes on a paper, I would need to annotate PDFs, to add notes that, have blocks of code from different stages at different points in the notes.\n Thus, I may potentially have upto 5 sources of notes (yes, seems like a lot): (i) a majority on pen-paper, (ii) annotations in a PDF, (iii) normal notes and points in a normal org-mode text window, and (iv) blocks of code and (v) diagrams. Is there a good way to combine these different sources in org-mode and make it seem streamlined and efficient? Essentially, a good workflow for me to add pdf's and diagrams/code to my pen-paper notes and organize them. Is it even feasible, as I am still fairly new to org-mode?\n Breaking it to a simpler need, what is the best workflow to integrate lecture slides (with annotations) with handwritten notes? \n Note: Please don't provide answers such as \"Just listen in class don't take notes constantly, or you will miss out\", it doesn't for me. I'm someone who relies on writing a lot to understand information, and pen-paper notes has worked well for me. I would love to supplement it with other sources to make it better :)\n Edit: I have come across org-noter, and though I find it to be cool, I don't understand most of it, and it seems for a pro-org-mode user! If someone does suggest it, I'd highly appreciate it if someone explains what it does for a noob user.\n    submitted by    /u/ThreeForElvenKings  \n [link]   [comments]",

In typical calendars, repeating events can be specified with rrules. However, while I see that org mode has repeaters, I haven't figured out how to do several things that I can do with rrules.\n Examples:\n (1) repeat on the last day of every month\n (2) repeat on every 1st and 15th day of every month\n (3) repeat every Mon, Wed, Fri\n ​\n Is it possible to encode these repeat patterns in org mode? If so, how?\n If not, is there some extension package which enriches org mode with more sophisticated datetime patterns?\n Thanks in advance for any info you can offer!\n    submitted by    /u/the88doctor  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I find imenu very helpful for quickly jumping back and forth between defuns in buffers containing lots of function definitions. However, when this command is invoked in an org-mode buffer, the relevant units cease to be defuns and become org headings instead. This makes sense in most cases, but when the org buffer is visiting a literate configuration file, it would be nice if imenu behaved as it normally does in programming modes. Example:\n ``` * Section one\n +begin_src emacs-lisp :results silent\n (defun function-one () \"This is not a useful function.\")\n +end_src\n  \nSection two\n  \n+begin_src emacs-lisp :results silent\n (defun function-two () \"This is not a useful function, either.\")\n +end_src\n ```\n When invoked here, I would like imenu to let me choose between function-one and function-two rather than between * Section one and * Section two.\n Is there a way to modify imenu so that it behaves as I'm describing? Alternatively, is there a similar command or package that provides this sort of functionality?\n    submitted by    /u/Benthamite  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I updated org yesterday from 9.4.4 to 9.4.6 and found that when marking a recurring task done, it was permanently marked DONE instead of having its timestamp updated and todo status left as TODO. An inactive timestamp was also recorded in the logbook, but LAST_REPEAT in the properties drawer was not updated.\n Looking at the version 9.4 release notes, I saw that org-loop-over-headlines-in-active-region now defaults to t. I checked the docstring, as the release notes suggest, and while I can't say that I found it very enlightening, something told me I should try changing it. I set it to nil and marking tasks done in their own file buffer started to work as before, but marking them done from the agenda was still a problem. Reading a little further, I saw a new and related variable, also defaulting to t, called org-agenda-loop-over-headlines-in-active-region. I set that to nil and now everything seems to be working as before.\n Still, after reading the docstrings and the manual, I don't understand what these variables really do. Plus, since the release notes are for 9.4 I imagine they were already defaulting to t in 9.4.4, which worked fine for me. Finally, I cannot seem to find anybody else having reported the same problem. All of which is to say that I am not confident that I have really solved it. Maybe I \"solved\" a side-effect of another problem instead?\n Can anybody give me a bit of insight that will either give me confidence in my solution or help me find the real problem?\n    submitted by    /u/WitnessTheBadger  \n [link]   [comments]",

Embark detects the target object at point and provides the user with a set of action commands which can operate on the target.\n Embark in Action\n Recently we made a few developments, which improve the accessibility of Embark:\n  \nA detailed action indicator, which is enabled by default.\n The target at point is highlighted.\n By pressing the embark-act key, you can cycle between targets, if multiple targets are detected.\n  \nAs an alternative to the detailed action indicator you can configure which-key or use the minimal indicator which shows a brief message in the echo area. The minimal indicator is mainly useful if the keybindings are already familiar. With the minimal indicator it is still possible to request keybinding help by pressing C-h. In order to act with a single key press on the target, Embark offers the embark-dwim command, which performs the default action. The command embark-dwim corresponds to a left click and the command embark-act can be seen as a right click, which opens the context menu.\n  \nGithub: https://github.com/oantolin/embark\n MELPA: https://melpa.org/#/embark\n  \n   submitted by    /u/dmendler  \n [link]   [comments]",

For exampl, Ctrl-b enables bold on the email webapp instead of shifting the cursor back. This solution also only works for a limited set of keybidings, i.e. no kill/yank combo in emacs.\n Another possible solution is to use something like GhostText (https://github.com/fregante/GhostText) in the browser.

It seems that it's not the optimal position (for common typist at least), and the \"correct\" finger seems to be pinky.\n I think I developed this habit because I swapped [<->( and ]<->), and because I'm a heavy Lisp coder my pinky is almost always hovering above (. Therefore I unconsciously adapted to use ring finger to press p. However it does seem to cause lots of unnecessary hand movement.\n Does anyone else share such experience adapting to suboptimal hand positions? I guess anyone aware of this has already rebind <backspace> and <return>, but where to put (, for Lispers? I'm currently considering put it to where ; was, but there're already bunch of quite frequent bindings on ; (;, M-;, C-M-;) and it's a bit messy to move 5 frequent bindings at once (I always move anything-( together with ().

Everything I've done so far seems to work, except for certain keys acting slow.\n When I hit \"C-x\" or \"C-h\", the \"C-x\" or \"C-h\" is slow to appear in the minibuffer (perhaps a half second delay). Many other keys and key combos (including \"M-x\", \"C-g\", and \"C-s\") seem to work/appear fast in emacs, and Vim responds quickly to \"C-x\", so I have no idea what could be causing this. With my old keyboard, \"C-x\" appeared immediately in the minibuffer after the key combo was hit so this short delay is new. It's incredibly weird that it only happens with some keys but not others, it only happens in emacs and not Vim, and it only happens with my new kinesis advantage 2 keyboard and not my all keyboard.\n Does anyone have any idea what could be causing this or how I could fix it? Any ideas or guidance would be much appreciated as I have no idea where to even start looking for the cause of the problem. Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/the88doctor  \n [link]   [comments]",

Just want to explore how things are done the emacs way.\n The motivation is more than purely exploratory, though. While evil is the best vim emulation I found, there are still small niggles and I find myself fighting a little when customising packages and keybindings.

          "description": "In my LaTeX projects, I usually have one file main.tex and sub-directories including other tex files which are ultimately included in then main.tex. The way AUCTeX handles this is by setting TeX-master to point to main. Instead of setting this variable locally in each file, I used to have a \".dir-locals\" file in each sub-directory to set TeX-master.\n Since dir-local variables are inherited, I wanted to make it so that I can set TeX-master in the root directory once for all files. For example, having the following structure:\n  - main.tex - sub1.tex - .dir-locals.el - sub/ |-- subsub1.tex |-- subsub2.tex |-- subsub |-- subsubsub1.tex |-- subsubsub2.tex \n and then have in .dir-locals.el \n lisp ((latex-mode . ((TeX-master relpath \"main\")))) \n Then in both main.tex and sub1.tex, TeX-master would main but in subsub*.tex, TeX-master would be ../main, and subsubsub*.tex TeX-master would be ../../main and so on.\n Having an eval statement would not work since I wouldn't be able to get the path to the directory. The way I solved this is by advising hack-local-variables-filter to handle this particular value.\n What do you think of this solution?

I think it appeared after I marked a file for deletion in the Dired buffer with d and then deleted it with x.\n Sadly, I was not able to find anything while searching around. Google's search operators absolutely hate trying to search for a !. Even when doing stuff like intext:(\"! Dired\") or allintext:(\"! Dired\"), the AND operator didn't help much either. Not even the <string> +<string> operator worked, which is supposed to force an exact match.

          "description": "Hi all, wanted to raise a discussion about a thought I had. \n As a moderately experienced Emacs user (8 years), I've invested a LOT of time into learning and configuring Emacs (including email, RSS, browsing, calculator, etc). I can say that it does what I want and how I want it. I won't go into the fact that it's a never ending process because tastes and interests (+ jobs) change. \n I would reckon that we all stick to Emacs, at least in some small part due to the sunk cost fallcy. Basically it means a price already paid in the past on our actions keep influencing our decisions in the future even though it shouldn't. From the link: \n  \nPeople demonstrate \"a greater tendency to continue an endeavor once an investment in money, effort, or time has been made.\"\n  \nThe question of whether the time invested in Emacs is worth the productivity gained is discussed here all the time. My view is to justify it by a combination of the following: believing in FOSS, (related to that) text centricity, and it could be viewed as a mental hobby, a creative outlet. \n However I might admit that I exhibit some sunk cost fallacy thinking. It becomes clear when I realize that I WON'T recommend Emacs to new users - unless they are going to invest large amounts of time learning it, like I did. \n What are your thoughts on this? would you admit that there's some irrational thinking in choosing Emacs over some other tools, e.g. the longer you use it the more you're convinced it's the best even though new tools are keep being developed.\n    submitted by    /u/Deep-Fox6860  \n [link]   [comments]",

The --debug-init option gives no additional output. \n This only happens with the -nw option. The gui works normally. \n Anybody know what's going on here?\n PS: I'm on MacOS and using the emacs-plus distribution from Homebrew.\n EDIT: After some investigation it turns out the following code inside my init.el file was the issue: \n (defvar startup/file-name-handler-alist file-name-handler-alist) (setq file-name-handler-alist nil) (defun startup/revert-file-name-handler-alist () (setq file-name-handler-alist startup/file-name-handler-alist)) (add-hook 'emacs-startup-hook 'startup/revert-file-name-handler-alist) \n Anybody know why this would cause the error on emacs28?\n    submitted by    /u/jmhimara  \n [link]   [comments]",

I had previously kept the whole thing in latex, and have a format which I'm really happy with. I'm turning that into a custom class, which I will use in the export.\n Some of the headings have dates attached to them. The class file I've made redefines the the LaTeX section command to have two arguments: \\\\section{<date>}{<heading title>}.\n The most obvious way I can see to store these associated dates in org mode is in a property, like :DATE: 2018. \n Is there a way that I can inject these property's values into the section strings in the export? The only similar functionality I have found so far is the strings in the third argument of org-latex-classes, but that only interpolates the heading title, and doesn't provide any way of getting further information into the string.\n If this is just not possible at the moment, would anybody else be interested in it if I were to try to implement it?\n    submitted by    /u/Jack-o-tall-tales  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm glad I know them but they weren't for me.)\n Recently I redefined the evil-insert function to add toggle-korean-input-method to the end, and this achieved what should be the default behavior for Vim/Evil Mode imo, switching the language input method to what it was before leaving input mode last time.\n I won't reproduce the whole redefined function since all I did was repeat the whole function in my init.el while adding one line after (evil-insert-state 1), like this:\n (evil-insert-state 1) (toggle-korean-input-method) )) \n The obvious solution might have been to advise the function, which was the first thing I tried but it resulted in breaking the evil-insert function. Here's the advice I tried:\n (advice-add 'evil-insert :after #'toggle-korean-input-method) \n Maybe I did it wrong but it made Evil Mode unusable, and the Emacs manual says advising a function called by other functions is is bad practice so I went with redefinition, clunky though it is.\n Frankly I don't entirely understand why this works the way it does, but it's made me very happy and maybe it'll be helpful to others :)\n    submitted by    /u/lj-read-it  \n [link]   [comments]",

Only when used correctly can they help you actually get real work done. \n It hasn't taken me long to figure out that the only real way to \"master\" (use competently) org-mode/emacs is to just dive in, figure out what YOU want out of your management system, and go for it. \n if you find your self at a dead end, it's probably not a limitation of the system, but a limitation on your specificity of your goal / problem. \n However complex, labyrinth-ian both systems get, they will never be outpaced by other \"note taking \" apps . \n Why? \n ​\n because org-mode and emacs are both more about the processing of text than simply note-taking. \n ​\n I really think that the future of org-mode however, is to move away from some of the architectural constraints of emacs.\n    submitted by    /u/SpellLegitimate  \n [link]   [comments]",

One of the exercises is about detecting anagrams in a list.\n There are lots of ways to do it, but decided to try something that was less about manually iterating through the characters in a word myself and more about using built-in functionality.\n (defun anagrams-for (word anagram-list) (cl-loop for drow in anagram-list with tmp-drow = drow unless (equal (downcase word) (downcase drow)) do (setq tmp-drow drow) unless (cl-mismatch (cl-sort word '< :key 'downcase) (cl-sort drow '< :key 'downcase)) collect tmp-drow)) \n First, that with tmp-drow = drow absolutely does not work as I expect. The cl-loop is supposed to set variables in a let* manner, but when that with is called, drow is still unset. That's why I do the setq later.\n Second, cl-sort is destructive, so I thought I'd be able to copy the value into tmp-drow and avoid the rearranging of pointers that it performs.

Then i tried out tide in web mode, and boy it was a good change. tide works out of the box, very well, fast enough and it didn't eat up so much ram either. i am not very familiar to elisp tracebacks, so just moved on to tide, instead of going deeper. i feel somewhat guilty for that, but i just don't know where to start or where to look at, cause lsp-mode code is huge and i don't know where to begin.\n Anyway, did anyone else have this problem?

I do have experience with self-hosting some stuff on my own domain, so I'm looking for a web application I can self-host which allows me to use emacs over a web browser.\n There are many pieces of information about this, such as\n  \nshell apps: gotty, web-console, gateone, shellinabox, butterfly, webssh: most seem no longer maintained and there's no clear indication regarding conflicts with key mappings between the browser/app and emacs ;\n more specific emacs/orgmode apps: cloudmacs, organice, orgmodweb, filestash, org-web: they are more limited by nature, but I might use them if they have support for custom agenda views which I use heavily ;\n the use of chrome web app mode or spacemacs to resolve the keymapping problem.\n  \nSo, before going through each and every combination, or having to torture my muscle memory, does anybody have a thorough (and positive) experience of using emacs, or at least org-mode, in a browser on a daily basis ?\n    submitted by    /u/Born-Deranged  \n [link]   [comments]",

I Installed linux and wordpress on a raspberry-pi-4(which I'm going to use as a local web server to host the blog), and was able to get wordpress up and running nicely with some themes and plugins.\n When searching: does emacs work with wordpress, I saw this org2blog emacs package: https://github.com/org2blog/org2blog .\n Anyways, my goal is to use this local pi linux web server to host a simple wordpress blogging website. At 1st I just want to have a single web page, where I post a professional photo of myself with a hyperlink to my github projects. Eventually, I would like to do full blown blog posts with all kinds of stuff, like for example, if I'm applying for a particular freelance project, lets say python web scraping, I would want to create a simple python web-scraping application, push the completed project to github, then write a blog post, where I show step by step with coding blocks, how I developed and built the application from scratch. That way I can demonstrate to the client that I have the necessary skills required to complete that particular freelance gig.\n If there's any extra wordpress themes/plugins that you'd recommend for this use-case, then let me know.\n Also, I'm new to wordpress, so I'm not sure how remote wordpress development works, I would like to develop the blog using emacs on my laptop, test it to make sure that it works correctly and does not crash wordpress, then push the changes remotely to wordpress on the pi linux web server.\n Thanks in advance for the help!\n    submitted by    /u/zeta_00  \n [link]   [comments]",

You can define individual services, and then bring up an overview buffer from which you can start, stop, and view the status of each service. You can also bring up an output buffer for each running service.

Feel free to tell me if I didn't, and suggest where to ask otherwise. I am an aspiring lisp / scheme hacker. One thing that I would really get into is gnu guix, the distro which is powered by the guile programming language. \n So far, all my attempts to combine emacs and geiser whilst hacking guix have gone suboptimally. The main thing that doesn't work for me is the ability to jump to a symbol's definition using M-. or M-,. This is what I have used browsing emacs lisp code, and I feel this is instrumental to learning the language and how stuff works when you kinda know the basics, but not more than that.\n Thus, I would love to know how I would have to set guile and geiser up so that I will be able to use that most useful function.\n Maybe I am missing something super obvious here that I have not mentioned.

On the Mac, I want Emacs to use Menlo, but on Linux I want FiraCode. When I'm not plugged into the monitor, I want size 11, but I need it the font at size 14 on large resolutions (i.e., greater than 1600).\n I'm just starting to learn elisp, so I get into trouble pretty quickly. I was hoping to craft something like the following, but also taking into account (string-equal system-type \"darwin\"). and swapping FiraCode for Menlo in that situation.\n ;; set the font size based on resolution (if (> (x-display-pixel-width) 1600) (add-to-list 'initial-frame-alist '(font . \"Fira Code-11\")) (add-to-list 'default-frame-alist '(font . \"Fira Code-14\"))) \n Then, it occurred to me that I'm not unique in my situation, and I should just ask if anyone else has Elisp that handles this situation. Will you Emacs wizards share Elisp where you handle this sort of thing?\n In the meantime, I'm off to find a good Elisp tutorial so I won't need to ask for this kind of help in the future.

I've written a linear algebra library in Elisp so from a straight coding point of view I'm okay, but I'm not very verse in how to interact with the Emacs ecosystem.\n What I'd like to do is to write simplified version of the ob-clojure. One that doesn't depend on running CIDER. The current integration with CIDER seems to be a legacy requirement from when Clojure didn't come with a REPL.\n I'm currently use Octave in a literate mode and it's pretty great. I can make plots in-line to my notes and then export it all to HTML. ex: https://geokon-gh.github.io/rocks/orbital.html . With Clojure the equivalent is a bit problematic b/c the core language is very bare so you need to use libraries and this is all managed typically through a deps.edn central config file (or in ob-clojure's case, lein). So that suddenly is not very REPL-y and orthogonal to the literal workflow.\n Fortunately this seems to be something you can get around now a days withadd-lib https://insideclojure.org/2018/05/04/add-lib/\n The idea would be to launch an inferior clj process with something like\n clj -Sdeps \"{:deps {org.clojure/tools.deps.alpha {:mvn/version \\\"0.11.935\\\"}}}\" \n Then you can in a literate way, add libraries on the fly and do the normal literate workflow like in Octave.\n I found a template for how to write a new language support https://code.orgmode.org/bzg/worg/raw/master/org-contrib/babel/ob-template.el\n It seems relatively straightforward - but I'm unclear on how to launch a clj inferior mode and pipe things in/out of it. Is there some canonical way to do that? (I'm okay if this only works on Linux)\n Any just general tips and suggestions would be welcome :) and if this is all a bit more complicated than I make it out to be, please let me know. I don't want to have to sink a month into this\n    submitted by    /u/geokon  \n [link]   [comments]",

That Time Has Come to refactor while preserving the muscle memory of my existing bindings. \n I'm aware of bind-key.el and general.el. Bind-key is sweet, especially for the tight integration with use-package, but I think I need something with a bit more beef, like general.el, not least for its concept of layers, something I crudely reinvented in my own system. \n I'm also considering -- seriously! -- the native menu system in Emacs. I don't know why it's so disliked. It's essentially a visual leader-key framework built rather elegantly from keymaps. No need for which-key.el or transient.el for prompting and discoverability. You can even use it with a mouse of course. I figure that I can't go wrong sticking with a framework already built into Emacs.\n An essential requirement for me: I code in Org Babel. I already structure my keybinding code with Org outlines and tagging to make it all easily navigable. This approach I need to keep. \n Am I overlooking any packages? I'm facing a year of work. Naturally I must start off right. BTW, I've never used Vim and I am not interested in going down the pure Evil route as in Spacemacs, super-impressive though it is.

          "description": "I use gnus, and I've been learning about org-capture. I like what I've seen several people do, which is to create a capture template for responding to emails. Since this will only ever be invoked from a buffer where you are viewing an email, the template can include clever things, like a link to the email you want to reply to. There is a good example here.\n It seems to me the obvious thing to do is to make this whole process as seamless as possible, and just make the TODO entry a link to a response---the template should include an org link which, when activated, opens a reply message to the original message, just as if I had pressed r in gnus.\n The 'just as if...' is the tricky bit. I make extensive use of posting styles, and keep all of my email config in gnus.el, which is only initialised when gnus is loaded. I want all this to apply properly when I follow the link, even if I don't happen to have opened gnus directly yet in that session (obviously, the link will still have to trigger loading gnus.el). I think this rules out a simply mailto link.\n Even if it didn't, I'm not sure if mailto links can do responses. Standard responses, as written in gnus and pretty much everything else, are generated from the original email (to the original sender, subject should be Re: original subject and so on).\n I know that org links can include arbitrary elisp. Perhaps the answer is a function (a preexisting one, or a wrapper around such), and clever use of some of the org capture expandos?\n How might I do this? Any ideas would be great.

I'm still trying to figure out the best way of navigating around, and this question is very vague. \n I mainly do embedded linux work. And it kind of seems to me like there are two approaches to navigating to files as you work on a project. \n The first approach is that you open a terminal, and move around with cd. When you find a file you want to edit you open up emacs for that particular file, then close emacs when you are done editing. \n The the second approach is that you just open emacs, and navigate using dired or going to recently opened buffers, never closing emacs. I might also have a terminal open to try running the code.\n It seems to me that emacs lends itself more to the second approach, and perhaps vim is more suited for the first? No idea if that is true, but I've kind of settled into the second approach. I also have just been using the emacs GUI which I also imagine also lends itself to the second approach. \n I'm curious how other people have their workflow setup.

It is my hope to develop a system that allows me to write productively for my field and accrue a vast body of knowledge along the way. From what I have read thus far on the forum, articles about the Luhmann's numerical system have piqued my interested because I do want to use it in my system; however, I am still trying to grasp exactly how the new UID, aside from Luhmann's numerical one, is used for linking to other notes in the digital slip-box. I am currently deepening my understanding of this system by reading How To Take Smart Notes.\nPertaining to software, I am in need of advice. I have both Obsidian and Zettlr downloaded, having used Obsidian in the past for note taking but not as well organized as I would have liked. The latter software is a recent find; I have no experience with it. Yet I am open to suggestions concerning other applications available for Linux.\nWith regard to my studies, I am in the midst of my coursework and trying to figure out my niche, but I do have an affinity for Plato and Spinoza. What led me to the field in the first place was the Islamic philosophers, namely Al-Farabi and Ibn-Rushd (Averroes). Anyhow, I look forward to perusing the forum for past insights and discussions.",

I'm not sure though what is the best way to take notes from a textbook if you are learning a topic for the very first time (psychology 101, history 101, neuroscience 101, etc.)?\nIf you were to be incredibly systematic with it, I imagine it'd take an incredibly long time because they tend to be information dense. So what level of note-taking is the right one? At the most abstract, you could reduce the textbook down to a paragraph summary. You could reduce it down into a set of notes based on the key concept of each chapter. Or you could be extremely detailed and create a note for every concept you come across. The advantage of that is it might help you see how everything is connected and you have a large set of notes to hook new notes from. The disadvantage would be that it is an incredible time sink and that a lot of the concepts aren't worth having notes on because you will internalize them as you do with common words.",

And indeed it would be stultifying to assume that the meaning in context2 is partially identical to context1 simply because of the shared referential sub-structure.\nQuestion: for the advocates of links only: is there a simple way to differentiate multiple referential contexts. I.e., to allow for the same edge/link to be given different meaning.\nThis could be via named links -- not just links named for their nodes, or multi-links, or some in-note context to mimic this behavior.\nDoes such a thing exist?",

Being able to search for and link notes to notes, or references to notes, or notes to references without having to \"manually\" link the items in markdown (for example).

In my role I find my reading notes often come in handy because I am asked to articulate a position or make some recommendation on something, but I think it would feel strange to start to have a mass of notes on the internal workings of my employer. I wonder if this is something people do, or if they keep it more for personal projects (or for those spaces where the personal and professional overlap).",

          "description": "Reading Christian Tietze's and Sascha Fast's blog posts on the importance of tracking inspired me to track how many Zettels I create.\nI figured that keeping a list of Zettels created daily would be useless without a workflow to integrate it in. So, I watched Brian Crain's presentation on optimizing productivity, which was cited in one of the blog posts from the Zettelkasten blog. Also, I read this article from the Quantified Self website that I found along the way.\nI decided that I want to do something similar to Brian Crain. From tracking how many pomodori he completed, he gained the ability to achieve two things: notice a standard for his good days/weeks/months/quarters/years, and compare how well he did with how well he is doing. I want to achieve the same from tracking how many Zettels I create.\nFrom looking at his setup, I'd have to track the following:\nTotal from a year\nTotal from the first to the fourth quarters\nMonthly average\nWeekly average\nNumber of weeks in which I get my weekly average or above it\nDaily average\nNumber of days in which I get my daily average or above it\nHe tracked more, but this is all I could understand from his presentation and slides.\nMy problem is setting up an user interface to manage all of this in a way that is simple and allows me to get every item easily. Brian Crain didn't talk much about his setup. Also, I have zero knowledge in using spreadsheets. So the question is: How do I achieve what I want to accomplish?\nReally appreciate any help you can give me.",

          "description": "After reading so many threads full of thoughtful and in-depth responses, I thought its was finally time to introduce myself. Greetings!\nI have kept a paper zettelkasten for the past six months or so, which has benefitted from everyone's discourse and guidance here. So, thank you all! I hope to contribute a meager offering now and then to this already robust discussion forum.\nRelated to my zettelkasten, I use 3x5 index cards filed in an Amazon prime shipping box--it quickly became too unruly for a small file box. I also have experimented with some GTD task management systems in there as well, though my zettelkasten is still the star of the show. I file them using folgezettel numbering, which has proved to be a dangerous business, although I am beating it into submission slowly but surely. The folgezettel debates and related articles are quite fascinating.\nThe subject matter in my zettelkasten began, as is customary, with zettelkasten itself, but quickly branched out to catalog all of my various other record keeping systems: bullet journaling, morning pages, hobonichi 5-year, and filing methods. It's true that I am a stationary person first and foremost, and that's probably why I chose a paper system.\nI also am particularly interested in how one might use the zettelkasten to chronicle their own personal experiences in the world to create meaning. I found How to Take Smart Notes rather confining in that it had a strong bias towards synthesizing academic research. I'd like to pivot away from academic towards the subjective. I hope maybe by using my zk to record stories and experiences, it could one day contribute to a work of fiction or memoire.\nAnyways, looking forward to continuing to follow this forum and learning from everyone's expertise!

I love to read what others are saying about their adventures.  Reading the discussions, in that and other threads, sometimes makes my head hurt.  I'm not sure if I'm smart enough to think so abstractly about such things.  I admire all those here who share their thoughts about how they think about thinking.\nI did not want to interrupt or hijack that discussion, but I would like to share my initial reaction:  \"What would a Shared Zettelkasten look like?\".\nI think that I understand, from what I've read here, and elsewhere, that a Zettelkasten is a personal database, where one keeps notes and builds upon research and thoughts which are read and created while living life.  The hope is to generate and discover new and interesting things while revisiting and exploring new and unfamiliar territory.\nThe basis of my question is, why should everyone have to start from zero and build upon things that they happen to discover.  The \"standing on the shoulders of giants\" resonates with me.  I'm just wondering if there is some way to share a Zettelkasten (or many).  Maybe this does not make any sense.  Maybe this already exists (Yahoo groups, Discord, Discourse, Reddit, etc.)?\nJust wondering if anyone else has any similar thoughts.",

E.g.: In my first, failed Zettelkasten attempt, I had a Zettel on the Feynman Technique. In that Zettel, I cited some random blog post I found. I had doubts about the technique, so I read another random blog post. This resulted in a Zettel that looked something like this:\nSome description of what the technique is about [citekey1][citekey2].\n\nThe steps:\n\n1. do x [citekey1][citekey2].\n2. do y [citekey1][citekey2]. Optionally, do z [citekey1].\n3. do a [citekey1][citekey2].\n4. do b [citekey2].\n\nYou do step number two because of reason c [citekey2].\n\nI ask:\nIf I had wanted to show how the two sources differed in their description of the technique, was the resulting Zettel the best way to do so, or should I have made separate Zettels for each source?\nIn general, how should I approach citations in my Zettelkasten so I don't question what I do like in the scenario described?\nI appreciate your comments in advance.",
