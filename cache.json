Both Ogma and Copilot are open-source software written in Haskell.\n Applicants for this internship must be U.S. Citizens and meet a minimum 3.0 GPA requirement. Prior experience is not required. Knowledge of the following will be considered a plus: Haskell or other functional languages, C/C++, Bash, git, Docker, Linux, NASA Core Flight System, Robot Operating System, FPrime. Please note that the academic level listed in the opening is merely indicative and students at other levels (e.g., PhD) will also be considered.\n For further details, or if you have any questions, see intern.nasa.gov and the specific listing at https://stemgateway.nasa.gov/public/s/course-offering/a0B3d000001OkSrEAK/onsite-virtual-improving-testing-capabilities-for-cfsrosfprime.\n Even though the deadline for applications is Aug 31, it will remain open for a few more days.\n I will be at ICFP during Mon 4 Sep - Sat 9 Sep.

I'm particularly interested in integration tests, as it's harder to spot unintended interactions between the many functions that make up the algorithm than it is to spot bugs in a single function in isolation.\n I'm familiar with the QuickCheck paper, and I typically test functions by randomly generating test cases and, where possible, testing properties. The constraints that my rebalancer enforces define a set of properties that are easy to test, but they are not sufficient to guarantee optimality. It seems that the only general way to test for optimality would be to compare the output of my rebalancer to the output of an alternative rebalancer that tries to s…",

PrintTest constructor of TestOutput now has an extra field used to report progress. Supply const (pure ()) as this extra field value if you want to skip progress reporting (#311).\n foldGroup now takes [b] instead of b as its last argument to allow for custom fold strategies. This is a backwards incompatible change, but you can get the old behavior by applying mconcat (#364).\n Dependency loop error now lists all test cases that formed a cycle (#340).\n Dependencies can now be defined pattern-free with sequentialTestGroup (#343).\n Added --min-duration-to-report flag that specifies the time a test must take before tasty outputs timing information (#341).\n When a test failed with an exception, print it using displayException instead of show (#330).\n The -p/--pattern option can be specified multiple times; only tests that match all patterns are run (#380).\n Fix color scheme to make info messages visible in terminals with white background (#369).\n When parsing of a command-line option failed, report received option (#368).\n Support WASM (#365).\n  \nYou can give it a try using the following cabal.project:\n packages: . packages: https://hackage.haskell.org/package/tasty-1.5/candidate/tasty-1.5.tar.gz https://hackage.haskell.org/package/tasty-hunit-0.10.1/candidate/tasty-hunit-0.10.1.tar.gz https://hackage.haskell.org/package/tasty-quickcheck-0.10.3/candidate/tasty-quickcheck-0.10.3.tar.gz https://hackage.haskell.org/package/tasty-bench-0.3.5/candidate/tasty-bench-0.3.5.tar.gz https://hackage.haskell.org/package/tasty-rerun-1.1.19/candidate/tasty-rerun-1.1.19.tar.gz \n If all goes well, the release is scheduled for mid September.\n    submitted by    /u/Bodigrim  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Does anyone have experience in writing some very simple games in a functional language. I tried it and failed miserably. My approach was really bad. I tried to do an OO approach and everything got tangled in IORefs, IOs and a billion functions that do a lot of stuff and are difficult to refactor. \n I would like to know if someone has tried this before and how they went about it. Let's say you have this very simple game, at the start you can choose how many players can play, they choose their name, the deck is shuffled, the players are put in a circular queue and the game begins. To play, simply write the card you want taken out of the pool in the order chosen. The game loop ends when no cards are left in the pool. How would you design something like this? How would you add on top? Is it possible to use an OO approach, where different \"objects\" can communicate with each other, or is another pattern better? \n Thanks! \n    submitted by    /u/BadRealistic2278  \n [link]   [comments]",

Given several lists ordered by priority, I want to gather unique elements from them. There needs to be at most n elements overall. For each list there is its own limit k of elements I want to take from it. Only the elements that are actually taken (so, overall unique) come towards filling the limits. I attached some test cases in a separate file in case you want to give it a shot by yourself first.\n I decided to give it a go using Haskell as it is pretty abstract and I couldn't come up with anything elegant using Python.\n The imperative version seems pretty straightforward, although I haven't programmed it.\n Here's my solution: https://gist.github.com/EgZvor/12268b0d439bd916c693c38b1fd853c8 .

          "description": "A few days ago someone on discourse came with an interesting way of using (or abusing?) the block argument extension which allows this \n example = fmap do \\x → x^2 + 1 do [1, 2, 3] \n to compile. Basically it allows to use do to replace $ or parenthesis. Beside the fact that it can be a good idea or not it makes me look at the BlockArgument doc.\n I've learn a few usefull stuff. \n  \nThe grammar is ambiguous regarding the extent of lambda abstractions, let expressions, and conditionals. The ambiguity is resolved by the meta-rule that each of these constructs extends as far to the right as possible.\n  \nThe \"as far to the right as possible\" means that we don't need the second do.\n so\n example2 = fmap do \\x -> x^2 + 1 [1, 2, 3] \n shoud work and does !. Also \n  \nThey include do, lambda, if, case, and let expressions.\n  \nSo we shouldn't need the first do because lambda does the same job.\n example3 = fmap \\x -> x^2 + 1 [1, 2, 3] \n But it doesn't compile.\n Neither does\n example4 = fmap \\x -> x^2 + 1 do [1, 2, 3] \n So my question why is that example2 works but example3 and exapmle4 don't ? Is it a bug or am I misunderstanding the doc ?\n    submitted by    /u/maxigit  \n [link]   [comments]",

Equivalently, it could return Cont r Void. \n After a quick search I found that the above type was already suggested in 1991. What's the reason behind the current callCC type in Haskell? Is it just because of the lack of RankNTypes or Void support from when it was introduced?

It covers splitting test cases, input parsing, and output formatting for some common patterns so that you can focus on the algorithm as a pure function.\n I am a Haskell enthuiast who likes to use Haskell for solving coding challenges in competitive programming (like in CodeForces). Over the years, I settled on a common pattern for most solutions which I wanted to share with you all. Most of the times, my main function is just parsing the input into test cases, solving each test case, and then format the output. So, all my IO resides on a single line main program where as the actual solution is a pure function from some input type to some output type.\n Formalizing this pattern in the template, I have a solve function for input type i and output type o:\n solve :: (Parser i, Formatter o) => Splitter -> Solution i o -> IO () solve splitter solution = interact $ unlines . map (format . solution . parse) . splitter . tail . lines \n I defined 2 type classes - Parser and Formatter - to support parsing and formatting for some common input/output types. Splitter and Solution on the other hand are just type alias.\n class Parser i where parse :: [String] -> i class Formatter o where format :: o -> String type Splitter = [String] -> [[String]] type Solution i o = i -> o \n I have added few useful instances for Parser and Formatter type classes, but more can be added easily. For the Splitter on the other hand, I just created couple of common splitters - fixedSizeSpliiter when each test case has fixed number of lines and dynamicSizeSpliiter when number of lines per test case can be derived from the first line of each test case.\n Feel free to share your experiences, improvements, or suggestions.\n    submitted by    /u/mihassan  \n [link]   [comments]",

My question: if I want to implement a generic version of Free Monad (it's generic enough a little bit like ZIO, Cats but it doesn't need to be production grade), is this the right direction?\n I have this question because I want to play with this concept by implementing it myself. Then I started to search online, finding an explanation like this. I understand the point (though not thoroughly understand everything regarding this term I suppose); however, when checking the examples on the internet, most of them use `List[A] => Option[A]`, or tap in Cats.FunctionK. I am confused generally how it's implemented. Is the example in the video is good enough, or some other implementations are recommended as references?\n Many thanks for answering my elementary school level question.\n    submitted by    /u/scalausr  \n [link]   [comments]",

I understand that concepts like Maybe(Haskell) and Result(Rust) are monads but I used them only as Higher Kinded types and had a very intuitive(as opposed to formal) understanding of what they do. I think of them mostly as tags added to a primitive type. Like type Email = Email String (as a quick example), where we say that an Email is a special type of string.

I was thinking of using Scalatra but I read some posts and received some feedback indicating that Scala devs prefer a different stack. I remember encountering something like this in the Rust community where backends written in Rust often don't use ORMs ( but there are ORMs available).\n Despite my best efforts, I keep finding new frameworks mentioned here in Reddit that I couldn't find searching on my own. I've also noticed that a lot of articles about Scala are kind of old. How do you keep up with new libraries/frameworks? So I want to reach out to the community and ask: what kind of stack would you use as a backend?\n I am familiar with Postgresql, but it might be the case that in the Scala community there is a special DB framework (like Datomic is for Clojure). I like Functional Programming but I don't want to use monads. I settle with a simple flavor of FP(like Elixir). I've read that effects are easier to use over monads and that Scala has support for effects but I am unfamiliar with the subject.

          "description": "I was looking for a good language to implement a personal project I have (a search engine). After listening to Martin Odersky's talk \"Simply Scala\" at ScalaIO Parris 2022, I decided to give Scala a try. I practiced some Scala 3 and everything worked great. So far I really like the language. I am at the stage of selecting the libraries that I will use for the project. I wanted to implement the backend in Scala but after I stumbled with the Lift framework and after reading other posts on Full Stack Scala, I really want to give it a try. Specially since my UI is going to be simple. I was thinking of using Scalatra for the backend and maybe Lift in the front end (if the UI gets complex enough). But I noticed that both frameworks only have stable versions that are compatible with Scala 2. This article (https://medium.com/@takezoe/scalatra-now-supports-scala3-4eb8988484a7) claims that Scalatra supports Scala 3. It makes sense, since (as I understand) Scala 3 is binary compatible with Scala 2. But the Scalatra docs only covers the Scala 2 version. There are no docs for the Scala 3 version. Is this because there is no meaningful difference between the APIs of the two versions? I also read a post that mentioned that Akka did not fully support Scala 3( I tried finding it again to link it here but I couldn't find it). This gives me the impresion that Scala 3 is still not supported by most libraries.\n I have not tried to run any test projects because I still need to learn how to use sbt (I started learning Scala a couple of days ago). But I got cold feet. Before I proceed, in order to spare myself unnecessary hurdles, I would like some advice. Should I learn Scala 2 and wait until the ecosystem migrates to Scala 3? Or is it recommended to stick to Scala 3 and work around the few incompatibilities that some frameworks might have?\n    submitted by    /u/glznzuriel  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi,\n I use org-roam and regularly use org-attach to add clippings or even as a save location for babel file outputs (e.g., generating a diagram or figure).\n I'm also a bit naughty, and don't always keep my files entirely atomic. Such that I quite often will retrospectively org-store-link on a heading, assigning it a new ID. But when I do this, any attachments in that section now break, as the results of (org-attach-dir) now are generated from the new ID, not the file-level one. I also generally like the idea of having a single (org-attach-dir) per file; but also to have that (org-attach-dir) be based on the file ID. \n Is there a way to have (org-attach-dir) use the root/file-level ID for generating its file path? \n Thank you very much for any advice.\n ​\n Notes:\n I've looked through the archives, with some related posts found but which don't quite match my needs.\n  \nQuestion on setting up org-attach folder per file. :: I'd still like to automatically generate from ID\n How to enable org-mode to search attachment in parent header's attachment folder :: this seems to be my question! But there wasn't any satisfactory answer at the time. tag u/shelper9527 \n  \nI've tried to set the DIR property to the value of (org-attach-dir) at the root, but I don't think its possible to dynamically set properties like this? This would be ideal, as I could do this only for new files, so not breaking files that already exploit inherited IDs.\n I've tried looking into the org-attach-use-inheritance, but it seems its not designed to enforce only using the root property.\n I suppose there is some advice-add magic that could be done to (org-attach-dir)? This would be satisfactory, but less preferred as I don't like over-coupling my org notes to my specific emacs dotfiles.\n    submitted by    /u/gillash  \n [link]   [comments]",

I've used roam to learn new things and better organize and consolidate what I do know, and the results have been excellent so far.\n I'm now trying to extend my system to handle problem sheets and exercises. When I'm working through a math book, I'd like to record of the exercises I solve.\n So for example, if I was working through Hartshorne's Algebraic Geometry, I'd like to be able to create a node/org file \"Solutions to Hartshorne.org\" with the chapter titles as headlines and in each headline I'd have environments like:\n #+begin_problem\n Give an example of an irreducible polynomial f in R[x, y], whose zero set Z(f) is not irreducible.\n #+end_problem\n #+begin_solution\n BLAH BLAH\n #+end_solution\n What I'm hoping for is a good, lightweight LaTeX package or class defining such environments that I can include in the header or setup files so that I can export my org file to PDF and get a nice solution manual. I'd prefer to be able to easily customize the solution numbering to match that of different books i.e. alphabetical, roman, numbers etc. I'd also like to handle problems with multiple parts well. I'm not too worried about the other aspects of the formatting.\n I realize this may be more of a LaTeX question, but hopefully I can get some advice here on how to set up the kind of system I want.

          "description": "I'd like to create links to inline latex equation in org mode in a way that makes the referenced equation obvious just from looking at it, without actually following the link.\n Let me clarify this a bit. When I write a latex file, I can create an equation with a label \"myeq\". Then when I compile the document, the equation is going to appear with a number next to it, and if I reference \"myeq\" in the text, the reference is going to turn into hyperlink with the number of the equation.\n In contrast, the closest thing I can do in org mode, is adding a #+NAME property to the equation, and referencing it with a standard org-mode link. This translates nicely to latex links if I export it to latex, however, it is sort-of inconvenient if I look at the file in org-mode because the #NAME property disappears when I compile the latex fragments, so I can't tell which equation a given link is pointing to without following it.\n Any ideas how to solve this problem?\n    submitted by    /u/acosmicjoke  \n [link]   [comments]",

I know there is a built-in cua mode but I don't like it that much. So ergoemacs it is. I did install ergoemacs from the elpa package repository and tried to follow the directions they give but there are problems, the official site https://ergoemacs.github.io/ asks me to add:\n (package-initialize) (require 'ergoemacs-mode) \n to my emacs init file. When I add those I get the error of:\n ⛔ Warning (initialization): An error occurred while loading ‘/home/user/.emacs’:\n Wrong number of arguments: (3 . 4), 2\n To ensure normal operation, you should investigate and remove the cause of the error in your initialization file. Start Emacs with the ‘--debug-init’ option to view a complete error backtrace.\n Then I realised the line: (custom-set-variables '(package-selected-packages '(org ergoemacs-mode)) already exists so I didn't had to do anything about it, but then It wanted me to add:\n (setq ergoemacs-theme nil) ;; Uses Standard Ergoemacs keyboard theme (setq ergoemacs-keyboard-layout \"us\") ;; Assumes QWERTY keyboard layout (ergoemacs-mode 1) \n Which I don't know where to add or how to add them. Can someone tell me, this worked perfectly when I last tried emacs.\n Answers such as \"why not give emacs keybinding a chance?\" or \"why not use evil mode?\" are prohibited since they literally are the opposite thing I'm asking here.\n    submitted by    /u/flakanat  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "As an active Emacs user and package developer, I've been contemplating the structure of tabulated-list-mode in Emacs Lisp, particularly its use of vectors. While vectors are efficient for indexed access, they present challenges when dealing with complex data structures or transformations.\n Much of my work involves parsing data from JSON API responses, which naturally form alist, plist, or hash-table structures. In the current iteration of tabulated-list-mode, a two-stage process is necessary: first, normalization into vector format (I find it hard to imagine a structure where the entry format (ID [DESC1 ... DESCN]) could originate from), followed by rendering through tabulated-list-print. This process can introduce performance inefficiencies.\n In real-world scenarios where normalization to the tabulated-list's vector format is unavoidable, the efficiency advantage of vectors is somewhat negated, and can even result in an overall performance loss due to the extra conversion step.\n I'd propose using lists instead of vectors in tabulated-list-format and tabulated-list-entries. This change could potentially allow for greater flexibility and better alignment with common data inputs. However, I understand that historical decisions and compatibility concerns may limit the feasibility of such changes.\n In the interim, I suggest enabling tabulated-list-print to act as a transducer, reducing the need for multiple iteration passes. This could significantly streamline the rendering of non-vector-compatible data while preserving compatibility and performance.\n I've noted that some libraries also struggle with this issue, resorting to workarounds and hacks, as evidenced in the magit-repolist-columns documentation string.\n I welcome your thoughts, advice, and any potential solutions or alternatives. If there are potential pitfalls I've overlooked, I'm keen to learn about them too.\n    submitted by    /u/elgrekoo  \n [link]   [comments]",

Computer: Why do you say yes almost all the time? User: Right now I feel like I could cry. Computer: Is it because right now you feel like you could cry that you came to me? \n I read \"The language Instinct\" of Chinese translated version in 2016 before met Emacs 2 years later in 2018, so have no impression of Emacs in this great book.\n (P.S. \"the language insticnt\" was by the first time to be translated in Chinese and introducded to the masses in 2015 which is 21 years after Professor Pinker published it in 1994).\n I am very shocked, this book re-forged my mind afterwards. After its reading, I set off to throw away various tools of note-taking and mindmaps, then encountered Emacs 2 years later.\n ​\n https://preview.redd.it/0avj2de0ozlb1.png?width=1079&format=png&auto=webp&s=70830590c6e9789e1b24f37077a2cafbfb47b222\n ​\n    submitted by    /u/AbstProcDo  \n [link]   [comments]",

Is there a way to just casually write LaTeX directly into the org file to make the notes look nicer without having to make a whole other .tex file? I've installed all the necessary packages for LaTeX and I've used C-c C-x C-l to preview the LaTeX, but the LaTeX gets unformatted everytime I close and open the file again. Also, I don't want to have to press those keys everytime i want to preview the LaTeX. Is there a way to write the LaTeX and have it auto-format instantaneously? I've tried org-fragtog, but it doesn't seem to work.

And I really hate to tie any workflow of mine to the phone. I recalled having read something about it, and some searching brought me back to Mickey's post. Jackpot! Emacs to the rescue, with Mickey's help.\n I ended up doing things a little differently, since my setup is not the same. I store my passwords in a .gpg file, and wanted to retrieve the totp key from there, instead of from auth sources. And I also preferred to use oathtool for the main task, instead of the adapted version of Jürgen Hötzel's `totp.el'. Which, as a bonus, spared me of handling the base32 decoding.\n But Mickey's post was really useful in showing an alternative and laying the ground work.

In other words, the work may end up being done as several sessions in a single day, or even across multiple days. Either way, it can be useful to log what was done at each \"visit\". I've tried a couple of methods, in particular with a view to being able to produce some kind of time-filtered status report, perhaps via a clock table (cf. this question) :\n  \nUse org-add-note (C-c C-z) to add a timestamped note to the task, in the same way that state change notes get added. That's nice and quick in terms of adding the info, but I've never been able to find a way of getting that into any kind of time-filtered report, \n Create a sub-headline for each \"visit\" -- usually using org-capture with a C-0 prefix. I'll clock into and then out of that and that means a clock table can pick up the sub-headline to use as my note of progress for that visit. It's tolerable, but it still restricts that progress note to just a headline, and I 'll often want to say more than that. \n  \nHow do others log progress in tasks?

Specifically using that link https://snapcraft.io/install/emacs/fedora \n But emacs has this \"twitchy\" behavior where it goes \"back\" for a brief moment and returns to the current \"state\". Let me give me example to illustrate the behavior better: Suppose I am the beginning of a line of text, then I run `C-k` to delete it. The line is deleted, then it shows up again for a brief moment, and then not anymore. Just to clarify, let me add the sequence of events:\n  \n(line present) Displays line\n (deteles line) `C-k`\n (line deleted) No display line\n (line deleted) Displays line for a brief moment\n (line deleted) No display line\n  \nThis behavior happens with basically everything, meaning the new \"state\" (a word is typed, a buffer is switched, etc) is displayed and then momentarily goes back to the previous \"state\" (when the word had been typed, etc).\n My problem felt similar to this https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/112uuse/emacs_29060_is_bit_jumpy_scrolling_when_using/ but it isn't because I emptied my `init.el` and the problem still persists. Also, when I run `emacs -nw` in the terminal, then there is no problem. So, it is something with the rendering, but I have no idea how to even tackle this.

Is there any way that FlyMake shows how to fix error suggestions or is that simply not a feature of FlyMake? Like in the screenshot example, I want FlyMake to make the suggestion to import java.util.Scanner since I am using a scanner, not just simply tell me that there's some error because it can't find a Scanner object, that kind of stuff.\n    submitted by    /u/Difficult_Feed8985  \n [link]   [comments]",

So started with trimming my setup down to the bare minimimum\n ``` (use-package magit :custom (magit-display-buffer-function #'magit-display-buffer-traditional))\n (use-package forge :after magit) ```\n and found that to be working well, i.e. I didn't have to manually \"start\" forge by running e.g. forge-pull. I then re-introduced my setup piece by piece to see when it breaks. (Luckily it's not very big.)\n In the end I made this change, where the relevant bit is this:\n  (use-package forge :after magit - :general + :config (mes/despot-def forge-post-mode-map \"c\" '(\"submit\" . forge-post-submit) \n That is, I swapped the use of :general to :config when bringing in forge. (I'm still using :general when setting up magit as using :configresulted in keybindings going missing.)\n I can't pretend I know what's going on here, but my gut tells me there's some \"interesting\" interaction between straight.el, general.el going on.\n I'd love an explanation, but I'll be happy enough if this post will reduce someone else's head scratching when observing something similar.\n    submitted by    /u/magthe0  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "For ages I have tried and failed to come up with an Org mode approach to answering the eternal question we often ask ourselves:\n  \nWhat (TF!) did I work on this week?\n  \nOr, more to the point, I want to get Org mode to answer the following question, often asked of us by our managers:\n  \nWhat did you work on this week?\n  \nIn other words, I'd like to get Org mode to generate a share-able report that:\n  \nDraws from some pre-defined subset of all my org files. For example: all files in org-agenda-files plus whatever is in org-agenda-text-search-extra-files\n Includes any given headline (from the above files) if and only if it has a clock entry in a specified period -- last week, two months ago, etc\n Lists the headlines in chronological order (ascending, or user-selectable)\n Displays the headline itself, plus the relevant clock entry and associated text (i.e. it's not just an clock table)\n Is exportable using org-export-dispatch << This is important because the report is for more than just my own benefit. So, a mere dynamic view within emacs is not sufficient. I need to be able to produce a PDF, or HTML, or the like.\n Can do all this based only on the data and meta-data in the headlines themselves. That is, it should achieve my desired data output format without enforcing on me a data storage format. I'm adding this requirement because my (partial) solution to the problem so far has been to store my daily notes in a datetree format (fed by org-capture), which encodes information not just with a heading's data and meta-data but also in its position. But that is neither a complete solution, nor a good one even where it does go part way.\n  \nHow would/do you achieve this or something like it?[1]\n thx!\n [1] Ideally, using Org out-of-the-box, without having to write a bunch of lisp. But, failing that, I'd take pointers to lisp approaches. (TBH, I'd take the lisp itself, if you had it, but that would be above and beyond the call on your part! :-) )\n ​\n    submitted by    /u/TeeMcBee  \n [link]   [comments]",

It's slowly but steadily getting traction and activity, to the point that you might have even seen it mentioned at Sacha's blog.\n Over there, one of the things that we are still missing is content from people with questions, or small tips/tricks to share. I was thinking of automating some of this work I've been doing and I started working on a small bot that could post a comment on every \"self\" post asking the OP to also take a look at the alternatives. \n The question is: would that be ok with the mods and the community here? If a bot posting on every comment is too much I can maybe make a rule for limiting to 2-3 submissions a day, but more than anything I would like to know if the community at large would consider this alternative or if most are actively in favor of sticking to reddit.\n    submitted by    /u/rglullis  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "In some of the projects I work with, there might be 25+ imports at the beginning of a file and I almost never need to look at them. On the other hand, I almost never use code folding, and my config already has so many packages in it that I wondered if I could hide those imports using only built-in functionality. Surprisingly, hideshow.el apparently doesn't have this functionality built in, so I took a crack at making it happen.\n After some fiddling, I came up with this: \n (defun rex/php-fold-use-block-initially () \"Hide the initial block of `use' statements in PHP buffers.\" (interactive) (save-excursion (goto-char (point-min)) (ignore-errors (re-search-forward \"^use \")) (set-mark (point)) (while (ignore-errors (re-search-forward \"^use \"))) (ignore-errors (hs-hide-comment-region (region-beginning) (region-end))) (deactivate-mark t))) (add-hook 'php-mode-hook hs-minor-mode) (add-hook 'php-mode-hook rex/php-fold-use-block-initially) \n This does what I want, but it's not elegant and it seems pretty fragile (then again, it hasn't broken yet and I've been using it for a couple of days now). Because it does work, I figured it might help someone else too if I shared it, ymmv. \n EDIT: In order to hide import/include/whatever keyword your language uses to include code from libraries or elsewhere, you would need to change the regex pattern \"^use \" to \"^include \" (for instance) and add the appropriate mode hooks. \n P.S. Now that I think of it, this function should actually be generalized to accept the pattern as an argument...\n    submitted by    /u/skyler544  \n [link]   [comments]",

I profiled it and it was pointing at a function called redisplay_internal taking up almost all of the usage, but when I expanded it the sub-functions didn't take up as much as redisplay_internal. Emacs -Q causes the redisplay_internal usage to drop considerably and the lag to go away. I'm wondering if anyone has had this issue or if not how I could go about further dissecting what is going on since profiling didn't lead me in the right direction.\n I have a sneaking suspicion doom modeline may be part of the issue since one of its functions has come up in the many profiling runs I've done. Disabling it seemed to help briefly, but redisplay_internal tends to stay higher than the emacs -Q profiling(in that it is lower than running M-x commands in cpu usage).\n EDIT: After singling out parts of my config it seems that doom-modeline is indeed the culprit.

I am a emacsclient user: I run emacs --fg-daemon with systemd user session and connect to emacs server through emacsclient (both GUI and TUI).\n The problem I am having now is: after running Emacs GUI client (v29.1 from Ubuntu 22.04 snap install) for a few hours, opening three dozons of buffers plus 1 LSP (gopls), I switched to Emacs client TUI. TUI hangs quickly (less than 1 sec) after connected to the server:\n  \nI see my active buffer of GUI in TUI for 0.5 sec => based on my understanding, this should not happen: a new client should not render the active buffer of another client\n Emacs TUI switched to scratch\n Emacs TUI stopped unresponsive\n Open another Emacs GUI client and this instance worked fine\n  \nWhat's the right way to debug this issue? Is there a way to dump the threads and stacks of the runtime? My hunch is LSP may be the problem. I hope to investigate before asking for more help.\n Thank you!\n    submitted by    /u/sherlockmao  \n [link]   [comments]",

What steps have you taken to make the user experience as smooth as possible?\n So far, I've come across Bozhidar's[1] post, which has been quite helpful. What's currently bothering me the most are:\n 1) Non-functioning keyboard shortcuts like \"Super + arrows\" for window manipulation. This is a known bug[2] across all WSLg applications due to the lack of support for this mechanism in non-native Windows' windows.\n 2) The inability to open files in the Windows system using Emacs (WSL2). This is particularly frustrating for Org files, of which I have quite a few on my disk.\n 3) Duplicate icon on the taskbar. I know it's a minor issue, but it's quite annoying. When I pin a shortcut for Emacs using \"Pin to taskbar,\" then open Emacs using the shortcut, it doesn't \"overlay\" the pinned application. Instead, a new icon appears next to it.\n [1] https://emacsredux.com/blog/2021/12/19/wsl-specific-emacs-configuration/\n [2] https://github.com/microsoft/wslg/issues/22\n    submitted by    /u/AsterOps  \n [link]   [comments]",

Currently I just have a basic html and css file and it's still very minimal but I am wondering if I should incorporate something like php to be able to make blog posts in markdown or org mode rather.\n I do not have very much experience in web dev but am pretty decent in other back end and system languages and find php to be sorta similar to bash. Creating a blog from scratch kinda seems like the long route to a simple solution but it's more of a learning experience as well as having control over the skeletal structure and knowing whats behind everything. This will also give me control over the customization of the pages. Any help would be greatly appreciated thank you \n EDIT: After a few responses and reading over a couple tutorials I've learned you can basically build your own blog directly in Emacs.

And there's one thing it does that I want it to not do, but I can't identify the name of the behavior to google for how to configure it off (or if it's attributable to eglot or one of the other modes that eglot interacts with).\n  \nconst auto sources: const std::set<SourceDetails> = get_filtered_sources(config, source_options);\n  \nThe text I'm rendering here with strikethrough isn't struck through on my terminal, but it's rendered in a different text color and it's always displayed, but isn't part of the text of the buffer. When I declare a variable with auto it will annotate it with the type of the variable. Or when I call a function it will sometimes tag the names of the arguments like so:\n  \nconfig.get<std::string>(tag: \"the_key_sought\");\n  \nI would like it to not do this - these annotations unconditionally inserting itself into the flow of text pushes things out of alignment, makes rectangular yank more confusing, etc.\n Does anyone know the name of this behavior or (even better) how to configure my eglot+clangd setup to not do this?

However, this approach isn't any faster than using org-babel-load-file in my opinion:\n (if (file-exists-p (expand-file-name \"config.el\" user-emacs-directory)) (load-file (expand-file-name \"config.el\" user-emacs-directory)) (org-babel-load-file (expand-file-name \"custom-init.org\" user-emacs-directory))) \n org-babel-load-file only auto-tangles during startup when it detects a modification; otherwise, it loads the cached stuff.\n The fact that Emacs initially loads the init.el file and then needs to access a different file, regardless of the method used, is what introduces a speed penalty.\n I was thinking about giving up on the Org literate setup, but right now, I don't have much time to redo my Emacs configuration in plain Emacs Lisp. I know there are cool stuff like the outshine mode, etc.. However, I'm wondering if there might be another way. Maybe there's a way to have Org mode directly add everything tangled into the \"init.el\" file? That would make Emacs load much faster without the need of a server/client thing.\n Also, do you think Org really adds a layer of unnecessary abstraction for a literate config, to the point where I should think about giving up at some stage?

Here's what I've done for that:\n I've created an init.el file with the following contents:\n (require 'org) (org-babel-load-file (expand-file-name \"config.org\" user-emacs-directory)) \n And here's the content of the config.org file:\n * Configuration #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp (menu-bar-mode -1) (tool-bar-mode -1) #+END_SRC \n Both of these files are located in the ~/.config/emacs directory.\n However, the config.org file doesn't seem to be sourced in the init.el file, and I'm not quite sure why. I've watched a couple of YouTube videos and visited some websites, and I'm following the exact steps they're showing, but it's not working for me.\n Could you folks assist me in figuring out what I might be doing wrong here?\n    submitted by    /u/hemogolobin  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I've been playing with Emacs 29's native tree-sitter for indentation and other ideas. First impression: it's really so very powerful compared to the bad old days of regexp matching and even ppss. It just understand the code. So far so good.\n That said, I've been trying to assess performance impact for applications that run frequently, e.g. via font-lock. Finding node at point is insanely fast: a fraction of a µs. But to my surprise, tree-sitter actions like \"find all parent nodes starting from the current node\" tend to vary in duration from (still very fast) 2–10µs to hundreds of µs or even several ms, depending on where the search starts from. I certainly expect some variability as you navigate from different depths within the syntax tree, but repeatable factors of 1000 seems a bit extreme, and make it hard to predict performance for latency-sensitive code.\n Does anyone have insight into this performance variability? Do you experience it as well? Perhaps it depends on the parser backend (I've tried only python so far)? Or is it fundamental to the TS algorithm?\n An example simple code to try, from various code locations in a large-ish file:\n (benchmark-run 100000 (let ((n (treesit-node-at (point) 'python))) ; or whichever language you have (while n (setq n (treesit-node-parent n))))) \n Multiply the result by 10 and that is the number of µs each \"navigate up from node\" operation takes.\n    submitted by    /u/JDRiverRun  \n [link]   [comments]",

In Android Studio select Run > Attach to Process.

The process is described in the emacs repo file ./java/INSTALL, but here are some additional details. My initial build of emacs with this library crashed at start up. I will describe in a separate post how I debugged this.\n I browsed to https://android.googlesource.com/platform/external/libpng and made a git clone of the repo. I then used magit to select branch android13-release. There was no Android.mk file in that branch, so I looked for it in older release branches. The newest release branch that had an Android.mk was nougat-release, so I copied that file outside the repo, went back to branch android13-release and moved Android.mk into the repo directory.\n I compared the file to Android.bp but saw essentially nothing that was needed to change. I set LOCAL_SDK_VERSION := 25, but am unsure if that variable has any significance. I eventually compared Android.mk to CMakeLists.txt, and discovered that I had missed a file needed in my_src_files_arm: arm/palette_neon_intrinsics.c\n Building without that extra source file caused no complaint from the build, but emacs crashed at start up.\n To build with the libpng library I added the following option to configure:\n --with-ndk-path=$HOME/projects/android/libpng\n After the build it is a good idea to check that the expected library files are actually in the build directory:\n ls cross/ndk-build\n    submitted by    /u/johan_widen  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "tldr: I think Emacs 29 is slower than 28 so I downgraded it. \n Longer version: I have 2 Apple laptops, one super new, the other super old. I ran either 29 or 30 on them in the past months. In the last couple of weeks I focused on the 29 branch, running the pretests and as of last week, installed the official 29.1.\n I guess I began to see slowness or lagging, since I explicitly began a bankruptcy on the older laptop - initially thinking I have too much packages. Everything was lagging: browsing org files, startup times, describe-variable took couple of seconds to return results, M-x completion with vertico had a noticeable lag with each key press, key press latency in writing, eglot jumping to definitions. So much so that I really started thinking about replacing my old laptop.\n Yesterday I decided that I want to test whether it's due to Emacs. I reverted back to 28.2 on both laptops. It was night and day. The new laptop flies; the old laptop runs smoothly so I even reverted the bankruptcy, adding back all the packages I removed and it's still as smooth as I remember Emacs running in the past. \n This is not a bug report. It's my own observation, running multiple versions of Emacs on old and new hardware, sometimes compiling from source, sometimes downloading from https://emacsforosx.com/. I just want to raise awareness, see if people have a similar experience. If enough evidence arises, perhaps someone who knows what they're doing can run benchmarks or profiling and we'll go from there.\n    submitted by    /u/troll-gpt  \n [link]   [comments]",

This is something i've struggled with again and again, and it has, once or twice, lead me away from emacs. But now i want to understand this:\n What is the proper order to configure and load stuff in my config, so that everything works correctly?\n Currently i'm facing an issue with standard-themes. Normally, themes are what i put below \"emacs internal configs\" but at the top of my \"external packages\". But the standard-themes-light theme doesn't load correctly. Centaur tabs are dark, org-mode code blocks aren't proplerly backgrounded. If i switch themes after starting emacs, and switch back to standard-light, everything is fine. I tried loading the theme as the last thing in my init.el, but that didn't change the behavior.\n This is only one issue currently. I've had others in the past.\n Since i'm pretty new to writing my emacs config from scratch, could some of the \"veterans\" explain what i should be putting where? Does splitting the config into a few files help? What's the \"best practice\" here?\n    submitted by    /u/domsch1988  \n [link]   [comments]",

I want to use Emacs for managing a lot of my Markdown notes in a specific folder, and also implements Org-Mode. I have thousands of notes in my folder. Coming from Obsidian, there was a very nice extension called Omnisearch that would index the content of my notes and allows me to search them easily (title and content). In Emacs, I think that rg.el (frontend for ripgrep) could allow me to easily search through my notes. I heard about org-roam and some built-in search but I’m not interested in this package. I will start with mardown-mode and org-mode, and may try Denote in the future.\n My pain points and questions are the following:\n ​\n  \nDo you know which package could best match the search features of Omnisearch? As a beginner I’m a bit lost with the sheer amount of packages to do search (helm-rg, helm-ag, helm-org-riffle, deft, rg.el, counsel…). I settled on rg.el but I am not sure.\n When I open Emacs, it always start at the directory ~/. If I only want to manage the files in the notes directory, how should I go about that? Should I always use Dired to go to the directory and then exit? Or should I create a project (project.el ) for the directory containing all my notes? I see that a lot of package have features to interact with projects. I am a bit unclear about when to create a project or not.\n I installed Helm because it is always mentioned (I prefer a single package to do the thing rather that the popular alternative that is a combination of a lot of small packages), but should I even use Helm at all if I want to use Emacs to write, edit and search notes?

          "description": "I’ve had to do some PowerShell scripting at work recently, and I prefer to do all of my coding in Emacs whenever possible. I have tried various packages for PowerShell, but have found them either incomplete or unmaintained; so about two weeks ago, I decided to try and write my own package, named koopa-mode. \n koopa-mode is a minimal major mode for PowerShell that has the following features:\n  \nSyntax highlighting and formatting\n The ability to spawn – and send code to – a PowerShell process in a new buffer\n Autocompletion for cmdlets\n  \nThis is a work in progress and there are a few bugs. Nested indentation does not work as expected and there is this weird bug when using koopa-mode in Windows where autocomplete appends white space to cmdlets. I also started writing Emacs Lisp two weeks ago and have very little experience with LISP, so it is also likely my code is inefficient or just flat out awful. \n With that said, I love Emacs and want it to thrive, and someone suggested awhile back that the best way to support Emacs is to contribute to it. I wholeheartedly welcome any code contributions or suggestions and hope someone gets some use out of this mode.\n    submitted by    /u/sch0lars  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello\n I have a particular issue related to indentation when using braces and brackets inside tabular-like environments handled by AUCTeX. I am using AUCTeX 13.2.1 with Emacs 29.1.\n Things work all right within regular content. As such, the following code is correctly formatted\n latex { xxxx { zzz } } [ yyy ] \n Custom environments are also correctly formatted\n \\begin{aaaa} { xxx } [ yyy ] \\end{aaaa} \n However, tabular as well as any other tabular-like environment handled by AUCTeX does not respect indentation; here, what I mean by handled is those environments whose formatting is set to LaTeX-env-tabular as well any other environment I append using LaTeX-add-environments and set to LaTeX-env-tabular.\n As an example, as soon as talltblr is on the list handled by AUCTEX, Emacs does not indent content inside brackets\n \\begin{talltblr}[ caption = {Somthing}, label = {tab:something}, % ... ] { colspec = {Q[l] X[c,m] Q[3cm,mode=math]}, hlines, vlines, row{1} = {font=\\bfseries}, } X & X & X \\\\\\\\ Y & Y & Y \\end{talltblr} \n I expect the following would be the correct formatting\n \\begin{talltblr}[ caption = {Somthing}, label = {tab:something}, % ..., ] { colspec = {Q[l] X[c,m] Q[3cm,mode=math]}, hlines, vlines, row{1} = {font=\\bfseries}, } X & X & X \\\\\\\\ Y & Y & Y \\end{talltblr} \n One obvious solution is to remove or not to include environments in the list. However, I really like how AUCTeX formats tables. It adds required indentation between & and \\\\ to show where inner environments start. Hence, the code is much clearer and more readable with multiple inner and nested tabulars. The indentation would be a great addition to it.\n I ask this question in hope that perhaps someone has already sorted it out. I would also be grateful for any clues and pointers to start with.\n Thanks\n    submitted by    /u/_-Big-Hat-_  \n [link]   [comments]",

The pattern may or may not be obvious at first, or it may end up going in a different direction than what I expected, or it may end up being noise.\nMy idea is that I would create a note documenting what interests me about the story and have a structure note representing the broader trend, but curious if others have thoughts on the merits and demerits of this kind of approach within a zettelkasten framework.\nThe concern I have is that I will fall prey to the collector's fallacy, and end up with a bunch of notes that are little more than \"So this happened.\"",

Thanks in advance for any thoughts.\nWhen I use this function, The Archive copies the title of the note and the identifier, and pastes them like this:\n[[201930091959 Alexander Gordon]]\nIt was my understanding, from reading the forum and blog posts over the years, that best practice was NOT to include the title of the note in any link, as the title may well change in the future and rather to link using the unique ID. So, I do this, with only the ID actually linking:\n[Alexander Gordon][[201930091959]]\nAny thoughts? Why does The Archive include the title when generating the link?\nCheers.",

After this change, I noticed that I had some knowledge gaps I wanted to fill and some skills I wanted to improve.\nI read technical documentation and watch online courses or webinars about technologies that were not my area of expertise, practices that are mostly in the software engineering world, new network or security concepts, and other stuff related to the so called \"soft skills\", such as How to Write Technical Documentation, How to become Persuasive, Give successful presentation, foreign languages. And on top of that I have lots of family concerns such as, family psychology, recurring tasks, hobbies and other.\nFor all the above, my brain cannot keep everything and thus the search some months ago brought me in front of some new to me methods, like zettelkasten, BASB, How to Take Smart Notes and lots of software. But to be honest, I haven't found my own workflow yet, what system to follow and what software to combine. I hope \"building-a-second-brain-and-zettelkasten\" will be something I could use for tasks and knowledge, but we'll see \nI read so many great forum posts here and shared workflows, I watch your great videos in youtube and I try to adjust my workflow when I see something that could make it better.\nI'm glad that I join zettelkasten.de forums",

I look forward to your critiques/feedback:\nIn Indian philosophy, light can be understood as both physical and metaphysical. \n\nPrakasha refers to manifested light. There are three types: \n* ordinary fire (_jada agni_), \n* sunlight (_saura agni_), \n* lightning (_vaidyuta agni_).\n\nThe original spiritual light is _jyoti_. \n\nHow does physical light interface with the metaphysical?\n* Physical light sustains life on Earth, for example, sunlight provides energy through photosynthesis. \n* [[Prometheus stole fire and was punished for giving power to humans]]\n* Light enables creation, as consciousness is the first element required.  \n* Light is involved in metaphysical visions too:\n1._Krishna_ grants _Arjuna_ a glimpse of his effulgent divine form, which _Sanjay_ also perceives through inner sight. \n2. The _Nachiketa_ and _Yama_ story conveys spiritual light's ability to illuminate the knowledge of death and immortality.\n\nSource: link",

Perhaps many of you have used dictation for your notes, but I find that Whisper has extremely high quality and gets things like punctuation, hyphenation, capitalization and so forth correct even with my strongly Indian accent. One of the benefits I have seen from doing this is that my notes have become somewhat more conversational than before. I find this to be a benefit rather than something bad, because it seems to be capturing what I am thinking now somewhat better. Perhaps this conversational tone of the note might be more relatable a few years down the line, but that is just a guess.\nAll the whisper models of all sizes are free but Macwhisper provides a free way of accessing these for the three smallest models. If you want to use the larger models you have to pay a one-time fee of $20 to make that possible. Perhaps other free tools even with the large models will become available soon. In terms of privacy, one of the good things here is that the model is sitting on your computer so the data never leaves the computer and it seems safe even for private notes for that reason.",
