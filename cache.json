But since the Haskell community probably has more experience with recursion schemes, I'm also asking here.\n In short, I'm writing a multi-stage compiler for a toy language, and I want to simplify folding and transforming my ASTs.\n Recursion schemes are perfect for this, but to use them I need to first \"functorialize\" my AST type, and then recover the concrete type by wrapping it into Fix. In ReScript syntax it looks like this:\n // \"Functorialized\" AST to allow recursion schemes inject custom data in place of nodes type exprF<'a> = Id(string) | Int(int) | Call(exprF<'a>, exprF<'a>) // Concrete expression type of arbitrary depth. // We add an extra wrapper to avoid defining it like 'type expr = exprF<expr>', // which would be self-referential and rejected by the compiler. type rec expr = Fix(exprF<expr>) \n The problem is, of course, that I now need to insert that Fix wrapper everywhere when constructing expressions or pattern-matching on them:\n let testData = Fix(Call( Fix(Id(\"square\")), Fix(Int(5)) ) \n Is there a way to avoid doing this, or at least automate it? Does it require specific language features, like Haskell's HKTs or OCaml's [@@unboxed]?\n I'd appreciate any thoughts!

Despite having little math background other than the few math classes that are typical for a computer science major, and not being able to come up with many relevant examples, I enjoyed reading through the book and tried my best to follow along every part, except coends.\n However, I struggled with the challenges in the book. I had to look up for solutions, or just failed to understand them at all, for more than half of them. I also didn't realize until the last few chapters that I kind of got natural transformations wrong. I thought it's a morphism of F a -> G a, but really it maps any object a to a morphism F a -> G a. I noticed that my retention for the knowledge is low. In other words, I forget the details of concepts in the book pretty fast. I tried to explain to myself verbally the concepts I learned, but I can feel it's wonky sometimes.\n I'd like to ask what are the next steps for me? Should I go through a different text, maybe \"Category Theory for the Working Mathematicians\", or others like \"Category Theory in Contexts\", hoping that maybe they'll solidify and expand my learning from a different aspect? Or should I learn a few other branches of math that I'm interested, and come back to category theory and see how they relate? Or?\n    submitted by    /u/machai_montgomery  \n [link]   [comments]",

The room will open at 18:00.\n We plan to have 1-2 short talks starting at 19:00 (topics to be announced). Depending on interest there might also be a short Show & Tell session giving people the opportunity to show off or talk about something they work(ed) on for 5-10 Minutes each.\n There will be time to discuss the presentations with some snacks and non-alcoholic drinks being provided afterwards with an option to acquire beer for a reasonable price.\n The meetup is open ended but we might have to relocate to a nearby bar as a group if it goes very late.. There is no entrance fee or mandatory registration, but to help with planning we ask you to let us know in advance if you plan to attend here https://forms.gle/Paiw6D4QJzTKzcmM6 or per email at haskellvienna.meetup@gmail.com. \n We especially encourage you to reach out if you would like to participate in the show&tell or to give a full talk so that we can ensure there is enough time for you to present your topic.\n We hope to welcome everyone soon, your organizers: Andreas(Andreas PK), Benny, Chris, fendor, VeryMilkyJoe, Samuel\n    submitted by    /u/Fendor_  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi every, I am reading the book \"Thinking with types\" and I get confused about implicitly universally quantified. Sorry if this question is silly because English is not my first language.\n In the book, the author says that\n broken :: (a -> b) -> a -> b broken f a = apply where apply :: b apply = f a \n  \nThis code fails to compile because type variables have no notion of scope. The Haskell Report provides us with no means of referencing type variables outside of the contexts in which they’re declared.\n  \nQuestion: Do type variables have no scope or they are scoped within \"the contexts in which they’re declared\" (type signatures if I am not mistaken).\n My understanding is that type variables in type signature are automatically universally quantified, so\n broken :: (a -> b) -> a -> b \n is equivalent to\n broken :: forall a b. (a -> b) -> a -> b \n forall a b. introduces a type scope. However, without the ScopedTypeVariables extension, the scope of a and b is the type signature where they are declared, but not the whole definition of broken.\n This quantification is to ensure that a and b in the type signature are consistent, that is, both occurrences of a refer to the same a, and both occurrences of b refer to the same b.\n Question: Is my understanding correct?\n Thanks.\n    submitted by    /u/Reclusive--Spikewing  \n [link]   [comments]",

Yampa prides itself in being a long-standing community project. It has now been around for 20 years!!! See https://github.com/ivanperez-keera/yampa#features for details on Yampa's features.\n This new release introduces a new type of integral that implements the trapezoid integration rule. Simulations executed at low sampling rates can behave in ways that violate expected physical laws (e.g., systems may gain energy over time due to inaccuracies in the calculation of positions and velocities). This new integral behaves in a more stable way in such cases. Thanks to Github users idontgetoutmuch , miguel-negrao and thalerjonatha…",

I have two related problems, I'm at my wits-end and I was hoping for some advice.\n The problem basically boils down to injecting context into an Aeson FromJSON parser. If I wish to read a file of JSON objects that refer to each other, I would like to be able to replace an identifier reference with the actual object when it is read. For example\n  data Region = Region { regionID :: Text , regionName :: Text , regionType :: RegionType , regionParent :: Maybe Region , regionLocale :: Maybe Locale } \n with data like\n  [ { \"id\": \"ES\", \"name\": \"Spain\", \"type\": \"Country\", \"locale\": \"es\" }, { \"id\": \"ES-CL\", \"name\": \"Castille and León\", \"type\": \"Subnational\", \"parent\": \"ES\" } { \"id\": \"ES-GA\", \"name\": \"Galicia\", \"type\": \"Subnational\", \"parent\": \"ES\", \"locale\": \"ga\" } ] \n I have an elaborate system of placeholders and normalisation at the moment to sort out the parent references to \"ES\" and I was wondering if there was something, a la Jackson, that would handle references naturally.\n I have lots and lots of other examples of this sort of need to reference other items.\n The other aspect of this in injecting this information, hopefully using the ReaderT pattern, into another parser that will use this data. As an example,\n  data Location = Location { locationID :: Text , locationName :: Text, , locationRegion :: Region } \n and \n  [ { \"id\": \"S\", \"name\": \"Santiago de Compostella\", \"region\": \"ES-GA\" } ] \n where the Galicia data, with all its useful information such as locales and holidays, replaces the \"ES-GA\" reference.\n I have wasted waaay to much time trying to figure out how to achive this and would appreciate any useful* advice.\n * With the caveat that I do not regard \"embed it into code\" as \"useful\".

          "description": "I've been researching how to use optimal evaluation to optimize Discrete Program Search and, eventually, I arrived at a simple algorithm that seems to be really effective. Based on the following tests:\n f 1001101110 = 1010100110 f 0100010100 = 1001101001 \n Solving for 'f' (by search), we find:\n xor_xnor (0:0:xs) = 0 : 1 : xor_xnor xs xor_xnor (0:1:xs) = 1 : 0 : xor_xnor xs xor_xnor (1:0:xs) = 1 : 0 : xor_xnor xs xor_xnor (1:1:xs) = 0 : 1 : xor_xnor xs \n My best Haskell searcher, using the Omega Monad, takes 47m guesses, or about 2.8s. Meanwhile, the HVM searcher, using SUP Nodes, takes just 1.7m interactions, or about 0.0085s. More interestingly, it takes just 0.03 interactions per guess. This sounds like a huge speedup, so, it is very likely I'm doing something dumb. As such, I'd like to ask for validation.\n I've published the Haskell code (and the full story, for these interested) below. My question is: Am I missing something? Is there some obvious way to optimize this Haskell search without changing the algorithm? Of course, the algorithm is still exponential and not necessarily useful, but I'm specifically interested in determining whether the HVM version is actually faster than what can be done in Haskell.\n Gist: https://gist.github.com/VictorTaelin/7fe49a99ebca42e5721aa1a3bb32e278\n    submitted by    /u/SrPeixinho  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi, I'm reading <Get Programming with Haskell> book on Manning MEAP website and have difficulties in understanding its chapter 21, titled \"Hello World! - introducing IO types\". In my opinion, it seems to give wrong information. Below is an example:\n \"If main isn't a function, it should follow that neither is putStrLn. ... As you can see, the return type of putStrLn is IO(). Like main, putStrLn is an IO action because it violates our rule that function must return values.\"\n The author seemed to think \"IO ()\" isn't a value, which I don't agree with. So I googled and found the following on Haskell wiki https://wiki.haskell.org/Introduction_to_Haskell_IO/Actions:\n \"PutStrLn takes an argument, but it is not an action. It is a function that takes one argument (a string) and returns an action of type IO (). So putStrLn is not an action, but putStrLn \"hello\" is.\"\n So I think the author is completely wrong on that, isn't it? On the other hand, however, I read lots of good reviews on the book on Amazon website. Am I misunderstanding something?

Its goal is to make interacting with Cassandra easier, in a type-safe manner, while trying to avoid introducing a complex API.\n Most of the API stays the same as its Scala 2 counterpart, the only notable difference is how typeclasses are derived. Whereas in Scala 2 for a case class we'd do RowMapper[Hotel] in Scala 3 we can do case class Hotel(...) derives RowMapper.\n In future releases we hope to get these APIs much closer by providing similar methods.\n https://github.com/nMoncho/helenus3/releases/tag/v1.0.0\n    submitted by    /u/nmoncho  \n [link]   [comments]",

To some degree I find this odd as well and I still don't see the value of it.\n How Scala had and still do lots of compromises because it's so dependent on the JVM which has a totally different model. \n Overall complexity of the language. I would say that this is better at Scala 3, but still, I find the language really, really hard.\n How easy it is to start mixing up functional and non functional code which defeats the whole purpose of writing the functional code. OCaml suffers from this as well, but I would say that is way harder to do the same on Haskell or Erlang.\n  \nThanks!\n    submitted by    /u/fenugurod  \n [link]   [comments]",

It offers APIs for manual composition as well as a macro-based Layer.init method that automatically wires multiple layers. Layers use a new Memo effect to manage the lifecycle of components and support any other effects that may be required by their initialization. Developed by @hearnadam @kitlangton\n Caliban Integration: The Resolvers effect integrates with Caliban and kyo-tapir to serve GraphQL queries.

          "description": "I have an enterprise CRUD appliaction, consisting of multiple services such as equipment, tasks, clients, eployees etc. They're not microservices at all, but rather modules within the mononlith Scala app.\n At first every service had its own algebra, e.g.:\n  trait Employees[F[_]]: def addEmployee(person: Person): F[Unit] def vacation(employeeId: UUID): F[Unit] def findByDepartment(departmentId: UUID): F[Option[Employee]] \n Basically a DAO. Sometimes it also does some authorization checks, but mostly its about communicating with the storage. It was cool at first:\n  \nDifferent implementations for different storage targets\n I see dependencies of every function e.g. def findEquipment[F[_]: Equipment: Employees]\n Additional type-safety - it's nice to see that a particular function works with Employees only\n Testing\n  \nHowever, after some time:\n  \nWe've picked a single storage target\n There's no big difference in terms of dependencies with def findEquipment(equipment: Equipment[IO], employees: Employees[IO])\n Type-safety is a win in 10-20% of functions because many have 4+ algebras or even Async\n For testing I just use the same implementations with empty DB - DB is an important aspect of behavior that I need to carefully duplicate for each testing implementation\n  \nTagless Final is advertised for DAO in almost every tutorial, but does it really make any sense? I switched to more concrete services and hardly going to regret. I still have TF, but for much lower-level things: Logging, Tracing, Queing etc. What is your experience? To me it looks like TF make sense in DAO only in educational materials.\n    submitted by    /u/MysteriousGenius  \n [link]   [comments]",

Given that there are now several build tools, SBT, Mill, Bleep, Scala-Cli (sorta), Bazel, Gradle, and Maven, that can be used to compile and build Scala code, maybe there is enough examples to figure out a portable standard?\n    submitted by    /u/MrTesla  \n [link]   [comments]",

Why interactively: you don't want it to run 50 times in a row when calling org-agenda, for example.

It looks ugly compared to my emacs theme or website theme. \n The pain plus the bliss of writting in org-mode made me wonder if there's a way to write in org-mode and export it to notion. I guess if I have the bulk of the doc done at some permanent form(don't need to edit much) I don't care where it is on anyway.

How can I fix this problem to make `\\(fr<Tab>\\)` works properly? \n By the way, I also want to know how can I make an abbreviation like `fr`, which I can expand it in a latex fragment. I have try `(setq cdlatex-env-alist'((\"limit\" \"\\\\lim_{?}\" nil)))` and `(setq cdlatex-command-alist\n '((\"lim\" \"Insert fraction env\" \"\" cdlatex-environment (\"limit\") t nil)))` but this seems only works for the abbreviation at the beginning of a line.\n    submitted by    /u/DendyLi618  \n [link]   [comments]",

Additionally, the previously provided `convert-to-org.py` script can now be executed directly within Emacs, allowing for document conversion without leaving this productive environment.\n Although these are just two minor main updates, their impact is significant. It reminds me of a saying: \"No matter how simple the functionality, the complexity behind it is immeasurable.\" To ensure compatibility with org-roam, I've changed the working logic of org-zettel-ref-mode from generating a new file and directly overwriting it each time to incremental updates.

They don't even show a key has been pressed with ctl-h k. However, chords like shift-ctl-left/right work just fine!\n Note: I access Linux via ETX remote desktop from my Macbook.\n I checked xev and Linux is seeing the keys. I also tried 29.1 (emacsformacosx.com) on my Macbook Pro M1 and it works fine. Any ideas? I'm pretty fuzzy on stuff like xmodmap.

Until very recently (last 2-3 weeks), refreshing the feeds was an operation that took maybe 1-2 minutes but it was fine because I continued to be able to use Emacs while the operation was in progress. In the last 2 weeks or so that changed: now when I refresh the feeds Emacs becomes unusable for maybe as long as 3-4 minutes. As in even receiving keyboard input for M-x commands is unreliable. \n I'm curious if anyone else has seen this behavior? And perhaps has identified a root cause? And a fix?\n Relevant info:\n - I do and have always run emacs-next from guix which currently sits at 30.6.0.\n - I run the latest elfeed and elfeed-org updated approx weekly via straight.el and then, about year ago, via elpaca.\n - I have always run elfeed with the default value for elfeed-use-curl (t).\n - My workstation is fairly beefy: 24 x i5s with lots of RAM. \n thx\n EDIT: I've recently started running the profiler during elfeed refreshes to see if it might point me in a useful direction.

And of course I want to make these notes in emacs, and not switch over to some other editor like some kind of barbarian. :)\n Is there any way I can escape or bypass or otherwise allow myself to make notes during a drill session? \n Ideally, I'd like something where the drill session only \"takes over\" the relevant buffer, but still allows other windows and for the user to switch to/from the drill buffer/session.\n Then I could have two windows, one with my drill session running, and during the session if I think of a note, I switch to the other buffer, make my note, and switch back and do more drill stuff.\n EDIT: as /u/queyenth points out, just doing e from the drill prompt lets you escape out of the drill prompt. The idea is to edit the question, but you can do off and do whatever you like, and then just do org-drill-resume and it, well, resumes exactly where you left off.\n So, the solution is: when I'm looking at a drill question and my ADHD brain spews a bunch of related things and I need to get them out of my head or I'll forget them:\n  \nDo e, which org-drill says means \"edit\" but to me means \"escape the very agressive drill prompt\".\n \nMake notes, play Tetris, deflect cosmic rays to flip bits on my hard drive, etc.\n \nDo org-drill-resume.\n \n    submitted by    /u/desquared  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I've been using Emacs for all my (rather limited) text editing and bash scripting needs for years, and am finally getting round to seriously learning c++, partly thanks to the excitement in recent years over things like lsp-mode, eglot and tree-sitter. \n A quick search through this sub, however, shows frustrated posts every couple of years over emacs' performance as a c++ ide. My (perhaps optimistic) suspicion is that it'll be more than sufficient for my purposes, given that I'm a long way off from million line codebases and so on, so I probably won't need or want full ide functionality for a while. \n So, assuming that my needs are fairly simplistic, is it reasonable as a beginner programmer learning c++ to be using emacs for (more-or-less) my entire learning environment, or am I missing out in ways I don't yet understand? I currently have pdf-tools for reading a textbook in one fullscreen frame on one monitor, and then 2 windows side-by-side on another monitor - the cpp file (or header or makefile or whatever) I'm editing on one side, and the other side for the output of M-x compile (which I've bound to C-c c) or a M-x shell (bound to C-c s).\n I would love some recommendations for things that I don't yet know I'll want. For example, syntax highlighting in c++-mode seems good enough so far - do I want to be using c++-ts? If so, is the grammar on the tree-sitter github page the one to use? Do I want ide style features like symbol/definition navigation, corrections, reformatting, completion as you type? Any suggestions for configs focused on those sorts of features? I'm not a fan of big starter kits like doom, but would love to read other people's configs for things that I can apply myself.\n I know this is all a bit vague, so apologies for that.

Let me know what you think and if you have any feedback/ideas on usability/features that you think would be important for the first release and I'll try to incorporate it before releasing.\n Added a corfu (and corfu-popupinfo) mode, inspired by Manueljlin's if emacs was made by zoomers post.

          "description": "First of all comint infrastructure is a thing that powers M-x shell and M-x run-python and probably other things that im not aware of.\n Its a nice thing because you can use it as a framework to make your shell or repl or interpreter more interactive in very standard emacsy way, by communicating with external processes.\n It gives you code completion (using *Completions* buffer), syntax highlighting (according to the article below), and it can pass those code completion candidates to normal emacs buffer.\n Run M-x run-python, create a new buffer with python-mode, AND you will have context aware code completion in your buffer (try it)\n BUT it does NOT give you code navigation, cause it doesn't integrate with xref, and it's not a full terminal emulator.\n I read the source code of comint.el, python.el, shell.el and found this brilliant article: https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/comint-writing-command-interpreter\n Main problem (besides xref), that i have with comint is that it is dumb terminal (as opposed to xterm-256color terminal), meaning it isn't a full terminal emulator.\n It doesn't interpret ANSI escape sequences, essentially only supporting raw input and output.\n So my question is: Why is that? And how do i fix that?\n To be clear emacs does have full terminal emulators like vterm or ansi-term.\n But i think it would be awesome to have those advantages that comint already has and also have a perfect development environment for creating tui programs.\n I hope this post doesn't feel like a rant or is unclear.

Luckily, this is the default in marginalia, so no manual advices are needed if I use that :)\n Sorry for bad formatting, I'm blaming the android app.\n I've recently had the pain of working with tramp over a slow connection and noticed that minibuffer completion during find-file on a remote path was painfully slow, constanly freezing, and sometimes triggered forbidden reentrant calls.\n I put my poor emacs debugging skills to the task and noticed a large number of test -e ... commands going through tramp, coming from a large number of calls to file-exists-p on remote paths triggered by the completion (was using fido at the time). This seems to hurt other completion packages that are based around completing-read from what I could tell (tested a bit with vertico).\n I tried ido instead and it was blazingly fast in comparison. I couldn't find anything about this through basic googling so thought I'd ask here: I see vertico and friends being recommended here a lot, and while I generally prefer these alternatives over ido, not playing nice with tramp is a pretty big pain point.

          "description": "Hello! I've been recently trying to get more intentional about treating Emacs Lisp like 'any other programming language' and so I have a question about package development.\n Let's say that you are developing two packages that depend on different versions of the same package. You are using Eask/Cask/Eldev/Keg/etc and so you have two projects: foo and bar that both depend on some third package baz, but one of them is 'stuck' at an earlier version. The packages are otherwise unrelated. For the argument's sake, you cannot upgrade. How do you get completion, documentation, jump to definition etc pointing at the correct version of baz? Do you clear up your load path every time you switch between the projects?\n Or to put question differently, when you develop foo.el, how do you get elisp completion and documentation relevant only to what foo.el should be able to access and not to anything defined in your configuration? Right now if I open any .el file elisp-completion-at-point will happily suggest any function or variable that I ever defined in init.el. I can of course start a new session and load only foo.el . But then I lose all my customization to get accurate completions.\n This is a pretty common scenario within the larger programming ecosystem and most languages/tools handle it without the developer ever thinking about it, but I have not seen anything on the topic in Emacs Lisp specifically. Any pointers would be appreciated.\n Edit: Some clunky wording in 3rd paragraph.\n    submitted by    /u/icejam_  \n [link]   [comments]",

If not, a plain tree-format directory tree browser would also be okay for me. Let me know if you have some recommendations.\n    submitted by    /u/supercodingemacs  \n [link]   [comments]",

However I've now run across something kind of weird.\n I had two meetings yesterday that I had scheduled and they did show up in the Agenda day view, however now they're showing up again today with the marker \"1x\". However I did not mark them as repeating. \n So for instance I have:\n * Appointments ** NAO Meeting at HQ Auditorium SCHEDULED: <2024-08-19 Mon 08:30>--<2024-08-19 Mon 13:00> ** Appt w/ Optometrist SCHEDULED: <2024-09-05 Thu 8:00>--<2024-09-05 Thu 9:00> ** 1-on-1 Meeting w/ Michael SCHEDULED: <2024-08-19 Tue 14:00 +7d> \n Both the NAO and 1-on-1 meeting were yesterday.

As far as I can tell from the Org docs and the Agenda docs, I created the timestamp correctly. In the first instance I put in a duration (it was a long block of time) and the second does repeat, but once a week. \n If I start to accumulate a lot of old entries this is going to get really problematic after a week or two. Any ideas on what I did wrong?\n SOLVED: Took a bit to actually get the RIGHT search engine terms because most things were just pointing back to Org Agenda docs. However the FAQ at this location (https://orgmode.org/worg/org-faq.html#scheduled-vs-deadline-vs-timestamp) seems to have answered it. I just want a timestamp, not a scheduled for most things I think.\n    submitted by    /u/remillard  \n [link]   [comments]",

The elisp function would then continue as normal without waiting for the compilation buffer to finish.\n I know compilation mode has hooks to handle this, but I need to generalize this, not only for compilation mode.\n What is the use case? I am the author of conner. With it, you can define arbitrary commands that can be ran with arbitrary \"runners\", such as compilation mode, various built-in terminals, or have the command be interpreted as elisp code.\n I would like to have the option of running hooks after a command finishes, but since the runners are interchangeable, and can be defined by users, I would need a generalized way to achieve this.\n Is it possible to run the function that runs the commands in a separate process, and wait for all child processes to finish or something like that? Although that would most certainly open a separate emacs instance or something, and I would like it to run in the current one.\n Thanks.\n    submitted by    /u/Emotional-Put2919  \n [link]   [comments]",

However I've run into a very weird issue that I cannot figure out what's going on. \n I have two machines that both have access to a home network drive. On that drive, I've got a folder called Notes and that's got notes.org and a bunch of Denote files. So far so good. \n On one machine (the laptop) I can launch Emacs and do org-agenda n and it'll pull up the day's schedule and current TODO list. On the desktop machine, if I do the same, it seems to just hang. There are no error messages, just silence. I've had to process kill Emacs a few times now to try different things.\n Any idea what org-agenda is doing that would cause it to hang?\n UPDATE: I went into .emacs.d and deleted everything pertaining to org-mode persistence, history, and things like that. That seems to have solved the issue for now. I guess between the two Emacs sessions, something got out of sync.

But that would not be optimal because that would free some slightly less convenient key combinations which could be taken by some slightly less useful functions, & c., so an optimal result would move many functions from less convenient key combinations to more convenient key combinations. So it would have generally simpler key bindings maybe very different from the default ones.

Will emacs source be too tangled with the text-editor part for such thing, or is there some obviously better way to build a lisp mindmap app?\n ps: for reference, the mindmap app I'm thinking about is one with emacs-like lisp runtime and keybinidng system.

It's really just an optimized early-init.el and an init.el that strives for fast startup times and sensible default settings. All the magic that is necessary is included. This is really nice because there's a lot of conflicting information online about the best way to optimize GC, etc. in early-init.el and this project does it for you. I've seen similar settings but I also saw some new stuff I didn't know about. \n It is designed to keep those two files in git so you can update Minimal-Emacs. Setup additional modules for user customization in pre-early-init.el, post-early-init.el and pre/post for init.el as well. \n It's up to the user to add to the base.

After a bit of trying out different configs I got it working with the OAuth 2.0 setup of my employer. \n Now I'm trying to actually use it, but I find it somewhat unexpected; perhaps that's because I have used org-gcal for a while and was expecting something similar, i.e. synchronizing of the calendar entries into an org file which can be linked to my org-agenda (and calfw).\n For example, a very frequent occurrence is to schedule meetings with other people (in person). This generally works by everybody looking at their calendar to find a spot in e.g. the next week where all of us are available. Is this possible with Excorporate? To me it seems it's only possible to check the calendar entries for a given day (via M-x calendar, moving to the date, pressing d or e), but not get a list of all the events, or all the events in a week/month. \n Furthermore, creating events seems to be possible via the API (https://github.com/emacsmirror/excorporate/blob/master/excorporate.info, chapter 6 API Usage), but this functionality is not exposed as an interactive function.

It's not far from the beach to the next big settlement. Forum Zettelkasten is written on a big sign at the entrance to the village.\nThe street is a hive of activity. The people here seem very friendly and open. Small groups have formed on many corners, chatting animatedly. I approached them to listen to some of their conversations. They noticed me and greeted me warmly.\nUnfortunately, I don't understand their language. Some words sound familiar, others are completely new to me. Now I'm standing right next to them. The word Zettel is repeated several times - the word I had already read on the big sign. I try to say it in my own language. They don't seem to understand me either.\nLuckily I always have a piece of paper and a pencil with me when I'm out and about. I draw a few lines and some symbols. The joy is great. The others also know this way of communicating with strangers.\nWhat does your journey look like? Do you have a map [1]?

I've decided to start using it for my research on courses about machine learning applied to geology, machine learning itself or geology itself. I'm used to writing stuff down linearly in my paper notebook - not only am accostumed to it, but I also feel pretty good doing so. It makes more sense to me, I guess, to jolt down in a notebook something thorough and linear as a course, more sense than writing atomic notes at least. I'm not sure if I'm \"stuck to the hold habits\" or that's actually somewhat the way to go. I wanted to try Zettelkasten to be more dynamic in my note-writing, as well as faster - for as much as I like and absorb better on paper, I roughly take one hour per page. Insanity.\nMy \"notes\" in my notebook are more of a summary of the thing I am consuming than simplified notes per se; I like to make them so that when I need to check the subject in the future once it is forgotten, I will be able to quickly comprehend it again. Which is why I am feeling using the notebook, rather than Zettelkasten, makes more sense.\nOr perhaps I can make atomic notes on the subject and link them on an \"index\" of some sort in my Zettelkasten? An index such as \"Course X/Y/Z\" with the individual atomic notes?\nThanks for any input.",

Somehow it bothered me that parts of the box looked very tidy, while others looked quite chaotic.\nInitially, my activities to improve this situation were still very sporadic and unsystematic. I lacked a ‘method for tidying up’. But it wasn't so easy to find. Even my favourite source ‘How to take smart notes’ by Sönke Ahrens didn't help me.\nWhy don't I use Marie Kondo's method? She already helps me tidy up my socks. Why can't she also improve the situation in my Zettelkasten ? Thought, done: Since 14 May 2023 (create date, Zettelkasten), I have been tidying up using the method.\nBut I can do even better. Today, while I was tidying up my Zettelkasten, I was offered the note ‘Simplicity’. And Google was kind enough to point me to ‘The Five Elements’ within Feng Shui via ‘The Principle of Clarity’.\nAnd yes, Feng Shui has been identified by scientists and philosophers as both non-scientific and pseudoscientific, and has been described as a paradigmatic example of pseudoscience. But it has helped me to find a different way of looking at my Zettelkasten. Looking at WOOD, FIRE, EARTH, METAL and WATER makes new connections that were invisible without this framework.\nI also added \"The Five Principles\" which helped me to find the right balance to tidy up my Zettelkasten.\n\n  \nWhat experiences have you had?

If not, how to convert literature notes into permanent notes?\nToday I was reading the book Atomic Habits on my iPad in the kindle app and there was an option to take notes on a specific line/word in the book. I read about 20-25 pages and marked a lot of information (there is an option - I can mark lines and words in blue, red, orange and yellow colors). So, as I was reading I took a lot of literature notes in the app (in total 15-20) and it was not one note that contained all the literature notes. I wrote all these notes with my own words and I noticed that I was describing some ideas very differently but the essence remained the same and I referred to what the author wanted to convey, but in different words. And sometimes I even supplemented these ideas with my own thoughts.\nNow I am using Obsidian and wrote down these ideas from my iPad to my computer in Obsidian as literature notes. Some of them were similar, so I filtered them out. But I do not think these are literature notes. They seem like permanent notes. In my case, when I make such notes, are they permanent or literature notes? And sorry for my bad English. If I made any mistakes, please correct me. I will be very grateful for any answer!",
