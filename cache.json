I had to generalize the types of course to add r but it was trivial to do. There's a few things I haven't converted yet like msplit, but I don't expect to run into any issues.\n I ended up with these shift/reset operators:\n resetT :: MonadFail m => LogicT r m r -> LogicT r' m r resetT = lif‚Ä¶",

Importantly, these IPs and email addresses can appear numerous times, and I want to mapping to be 1-1 (e.g, alice@gmail.com is always mapped to v38j8a@gmail.com). It seems pretty clear that I need to memoize my obfuscation functions.\n I've written some parsers and such that takes care of all this but without any memoization. I'm trying to use the MemoTrie library, but I'm running into difficulty - as I'm making heavy use of System.Random, basically everything I'm working with is in the IO monad, and MemoTrie seems to have little support for that. I can memoize an Int -> Int function but not an Int -> IO Int.\n Would anyone here know how to extend MemoTrie to support the IO monad? The MemoTrie documentation for adding your own data types isn't great and it's unclear how to write a sensible implementation of HasTrie. Alternatively, I can get the results that I want in a relatively straightforward manner by just using unsafePerformIO. Is this a reasonable solution? It feels kind of 'dirty' using unsafePerformIO, but I can't immediately see any negative consequences that might arise in this setting.\n Thanks very much for any help.\n Edit: an example of using MemoTrie and unsafePerformIO to handle the IO monad can be seen here: https://github.com/ocharles/dhall-build/blob/master/MemoIO.hs\n    submitted by    /u/HHHQuestions  \n [link]   [comments]",

The arrests conducted under this new law seem arbitrarily targeted, and many commentators have described them as being directed by President Xi personally, to suppress dissent.\n However, IOHK is still incorporated in Hong Kong, despite being (to use their own description) \"a fully decentralised remote working organisation\". IOHK appears to be well-funded, having (again, from their website) \"400+ people across 50+ countries\", and therefore would appear to have had every opportunity to leave Hong Kong, if they did not support the actions of the CCP.\n In the past, people on this subreddit have loudly and forcefully condemned US-based companies like Facebook, and US defense contractors, for their use of Haskell, and have stated they would not work for those companies.\n Is anyone else equally disturbed by this funding arrangement for the Haskell Foundation? At what point would it become disturbing to accept money from a remote company that is happily headquartered in an authoritarian regime?\n    submitted by    /u/alancelet  \n [link]   [comments]",

In the official wiki I found https://ihp.digitallyinduced.com/ which looks like an incredible piece of software engineering and I immediately watched their 25 minute video of demonstration and quite fell in love with it. BUT I am worried that using this would take away a lot of classical Haskell, because to me it seems a lot like Django or similar frameworks. With their different custom syntax operators like |> I feel like I‚Äôd be more learning their framework than actually Haskell. Is that a legitimate concern? My main goal is not to build a wonderful web app that makes me $$$ but just to build something with Haskell that is useful and that I can extend over time. \n Would a more lightweight framework be more appropriate and if so which? Is my impression of it not being really haskelly wrong?

Going back-and-forth between tuples and hlists mostly works but I ran into some troubles with the union operation.\n union:: (IsHList a l, IsHList b r, IsHList c (Concat l r)) => a -> b -> c -- infers nicely union l r -- infers nicely union l _ :: (\"foo\" := String, \"bi\" := String, \"bar\" := Int, \"baz\" := Double) -- uh oh union _ r :: (\"foo\" := String, \"bi\" := String, \"bar\" := Int, \"baz\" := Double) \n The blame lies with this type family implementation which recurses on the first argument:\n type family Concat l r where Concat '[] a = a Concat (x ': xs) a = x ': Concat xs a \n I found a way to make it work by going through type classes. If someone wants to try for themselves, here is a test case:\n l :: Proxy '[1,2] l = Proxy r :: Proxy '[3,4] r = Proxy cat :: IConcat a b c => Proxy a -> Proxy b -> Proxy c cat _ _ = Proxy c1 :: Proxy '[1,2,3,4] c1 = cat l _ -- _ :: Proxy '[3,4] c2 :: Proxy '[1,2,3,4] c2 = cat _ r -- _ :: Proxy '[1,2] c3 = cat l r -- c3 :: Proxy '[1,2,3,4] \n And here is my solution https://gist.github.com/Tarmean/fc553829a044979e9c5c8b4d226270b1\n You might notice that my solutions is an ugly pile of hacks.

          "description": "Hey everyone, I've been working through Types and Programming Languages by Pierce lately and really enjoying it. Throughout the book you work through the theory and implementation of the lambda calculus, the simply typed lambda calculus and it's variants (including System F). However as far as the implementation of these languages go you only go as far as implementing type checkers and parsers to form ASTs in OCaml (translating the code in the book to Haskell is fairly easy). \n I'm interested in learning more about how functional languages like Haskell are compiled to something lower level in the real world, different techniques used for memory and speed optimisations often talked about on this subreddit, how to \"desugar\" syntax into it's core IR language (like system F) prior to compiling it to something lower level.. all that jazz.. I've considered picking up a book/course on compilers however a lot of them have an inclination towards compiling imperative and OO languages which I have no interest in doing. I came across this http://dev.stephendiehl.com/fun/ which seems to match up to exactly what I'm looking for. However I can see it's been discontinued or the author has other priorities at the moment.\n Is there an alternative to Write You a Haskell? Or something that can at least serve as a complement to TAPL? I'm interested in learning more about LLVM if that option is available since it's interesting to me that some modern languages like Rust are compiled to/with LLVM.\n I'm aware of this https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/the-implementation-of-functional-programming-languages/ however fear it may be outdated. Correct me if I'm wrong.\n Cheers\n    submitted by    /u/mitbull420  \n [link]   [comments]",

The outcome would be similar in spirit to that of the existing OverloadedStrings GHC extension, however, the latter I believe \"only\" infers the type (Data.String.IsString a) => a for a string literal l during type checking and then desugars them to fromString l, where fromString :: (Data.String.IsString a) => String -> a is from the typeclass Data.String.IsString.\n This comes in handy when usi‚Ä¶",

How exactly would I make the example code work?\n I'd eventually like to see this work on the Emacs babel side, but I won't get greedy yet. Emacs babel is just a wrapper apparently for feeding multiple lines into a non-project global REPL, i.e., fraught.\n A really good tutorial on this would be nice to find, BTW. Most of what I've seen is just someone's stream-of-consciousness hypnosis ramblings, i.e., leaving a beginner to do guess-and-test over and over. And beginner books don't talk about it either; rather, you simply put code in a file and load it at the REPL as you work through these books.

(see article about this: https://github.com/rssh/notes/blob/master/2021_06_27_automatic-coloring-for-effects.md )\n  \nScalaJS:\n  \nImplemented support for non-monadic objects in awaited statements (i.e., `js. Promise`) - now it is possible to use await(js.Promise) inside an async block.\n Implemented JSFuture, which looks like 'promise' from the js side, but as typed monad on scala side.\n \n  \nAlso, during the year passed from the 0.1 version, we tested it in few internal projects.\n    submitted by    /u/rssh1  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi folks \n I am proud to release a project, which took me a decade to develop (though first 5 years I worked in Java). There are many new ideas and Scala3 became the ingenious technology to make them happen.\n Scalqa stands for 'Scala Quick API'. It is built around fast proprietary collections, which support unboxed processing of primitive types.\n It also provides a standardized way to define opaque data based on Java primitives. Data elements naturally inherit built-in specialized collections.\n A simple J.Benchmark test\n import scalqa.{*, given} val array: Array[Int] = (1 to 1000).toArray J.Benchmark( (\"Array\", () => array .map(_.toLong).filter(_ % 2 == 0).sum), (\"Iterator\", () => array.iterator.map(_.toLong).filter(_ % 2 == 0).sum), (\"Scalqa Stream\", () => array.~ .map(_.toLong).filter(_ % 2 == 0).sum), ) \n yields output\n Final Result. Total length is about 12 secs --- ------------- ------- --- ------ --- --------- Num Name Ops/Sec % Memory % Avg Value --- ------------- ------- --- ------ --- --------- 1 Array 29.8k 30 97.6kB 100 250500.0 2 Iterator 27.3k 28 45.9kB 47 250500.0 3 Scalqa Stream 97.4k 100 517B 0 250500.0 --- ------------- ------- --- ------ --- --------- \n Memory consumption clearly indicates unboxed processing.\n The value proposition is: Scalqa is much simpler and faster than general language API. Also, one can immediately be efficient with opaque types, which otherwise would take long time to get right.\n The project feature set is complete, but any good ideas (based on feedback) will still be taken in before version 1.0 in late Fall.\n Any discussion will be appreciated, for larger questions please use the new GitHub discussions feature.\n PS. The documentation is still \"work in progress\", sorry for any inconsistencies you might come across.\n    submitted by    /u/edolgy  \n [link]   [comments]",

Back in 2013 I got into Spark and Scala working for a startup and kind of burned out by 2015. I decided to try new things and bought a farm and spent the last 5-6 years growing food, working outside etc. However, I find myself wanting to go back and at least pick up contracts/gigs to make some additional income, invest more into my retirement etc.\n It has been 6 years since I looked at Scala and I know things have changed since.\n A few questions: 1) what is the easiest/best way to get back in the game and refresh/catch up on everything that happened in the language? and 2) will anyone even consider me after a multi-year unrelated gap in my resume? When I \"retired\", I was at the senior level but obviously do not expect to get back at that level (no ego here).

So if I can universally use the same build tool for java also, it would be nice. \n Note: Wire (a mobile messaging app) seems to be experimenting with scala and JavaFx, and their build tools seem to be maven: https://github.com/makingthematrix/scalaonandroid/tree/main/HelloFXML3 \n tagging /u/makingthematrix \n Q2) If not maven, then SBT or Mill, which one fits the above more. My personal bias is more towards Mill, but it has a much smaller ecosystem, so I wonder if it will provide anything close to out of box support for Gluonvm for example.\n ‚Äã\n Thanks a tonne\n    submitted by    /u/ivanvelikanov  \n [link]   [comments]",

Or simply - what would you recommend?\n From what I've explored just messing around, Play, Scalatra, Jooby, Vert.x. Thinking of a FastAPI/Flask/Falcon equivalent ideally.\n How do you find Java interop generally? Is it as simple as using a Java library from Scala?\n In a similar vein, what's your preferred database interaction library? (I Love SLQAlchemy Core in Python, and Dapper in .NET).\n I'm also very very curious, coming from Python originally, how you think the migration from 2.x to 3.x will go. (Especially in terms of timeline). Python 2 to 3 was long and a bit painful, but from everything I've read it should be a faster and more comfortable transition for Scala.\n Lastly - it seems SBT is still the tool of choice? Are build times still tricky even with Scala 3? Is it worth hanging around for those to improve, or looking into Mill, or trying to get Gradle to play nice?\n My goal is to dive in and get familiar with the Scala world, but also, evaluate it for use at work.\n Warm thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/DanManPanther  \n [link]   [comments]",

Tweaked Indigo to change how it deals with large arrays destined for the GPU. While I was there I fixed some other stuff ...and also added the ability to dynamically load shaders.

The aim of the project is to pull data down from multiple entity's public REST APIs (let's call them cryptocurrency exchanges). For each entity, I have to make numerous individual API calls without breaching that entity's API rate limit. The aim is to execute the API pulls from each of these entities in parallel/concurrently in order to save time. I have everything working now using parallel collections, but this is non-optimal because 1. CPU is underutilized on each thread because the bulk of the time is spent waiting between API calls and 2. more entities in parallel mean more cores.\n Could someone advise me on the best way to tackle this with a concurrency based approach? \n If possible, I would also like to keep the project structure close to what I have now. Each entity is represented by an object that extends a trait called Entity. The trait contains a method called getData that executes all the HTTP requests that are needed for that specific entity, waiting a specific amount of time between calls to avoid breaching the entity's rate limit. Each implementation overrides an apiLimit value as well as other functions for handling the specific entities HTTP responses.\n Thanks in advance!\n    submitted by    /u/EthelMerman  \n [link]   [comments]",

It also supports runtime constraints.\n Actually, Iron is almost full-vanilla (By vanilla I mean \"without macro/black magic\"). Inline methods, implicit conversions and opaque types are powerful enough to use them for 90% of the library. Thank you Dotty.\n Usage\n Passing a value A to a parameter/variable/return requiring a Constrained[A, B] will (using a given method) implicitly get a Constraint[A, B] (alias: ==>[A, B]) and use Constraint#assert. If the result is false, a compile time error is thrown.\n Example: ```scala import io.github.iltotore.iron., constraint., numeric.constraint.*\n inline def log(x: Double ==> Greater[0d]): Double = Math.log(x) ```\n Using to type aliases, we can sugar even more our constraint: ```\n    submitted by    /u/Il_totore  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello!\n I'm fairly new to org-mode, and have just been familiarizing myself with the basics for the past few days. After going through some excellent posts, I decided to try out org-mode for taking down and organizing lecture notes, and thought I could first try it out on a MOOC that I am taking.\n Now to the real question. As someone who has always taken down notes on paper using a pen, I do not plan to move away from it, and infact would like to org-mode to supplement it. Being a grad student in Computer Science, and Engineering, I realize that apart from taking down notes on a paper, I would need to annotate PDFs, to add notes that, have blocks of code from different stages at different points in the notes.\n Thus, I may potentially have upto 5 sources of notes (yes, seems like a lot): (i) a majority on pen-paper, (ii) annotations in a PDF, (iii) normal notes and points in a normal org-mode text window, and (iv) blocks of code and (v) diagrams. Is there a good way to combine these different sources in org-mode and make it seem streamlined and efficient? Essentially, a good workflow for me to add pdf's and diagrams/code to my pen-paper notes and organize them. Is it even feasible, as I am still fairly new to org-mode?\n Breaking it to a simpler need, what is the best workflow to integrate lecture slides (with annotations) with handwritten notes? \n Note: Please don't provide answers such as \"Just listen in class don't take notes constantly, or you will miss out\", it doesn't for me. I'm someone who relies on writing a lot to understand information, and pen-paper notes has worked well for me. I would love to supplement it with other sources to make it better :)\n Edit: I have come across org-noter, and though I find it to be cool, I don't understand most of it, and it seems for a pro-org-mode user! If someone does suggest it, I'd highly appreciate it if someone explains what it does for a noob user.\n    submitted by    /u/ThreeForElvenKings  \n [link]   [comments]",

However, when this command is invoked in an org-mode buffer, the relevant units cease to be defuns and become org headings instead. This makes sense in most cases, but when the org buffer is visiting a literate configuration file, it would be nice if imenu behaved as it normally does in programming modes. Example:\n ``` * Section one\n +begin_src emacs-lisp :results silent\n (defun function-one () \"This is not a useful function.\")\n +end_src\n  \nSection two\n  \n+begin_src emacs-lisp :results silent\n (defun function-two () \"This is not a useful function, either.\")\n +end_src\n ```\n When invoked here, I would like imenu to let me choose between function-one and function-two rather than between * Section one and * Section two.\n Is there a way to modify imenu so that it behaves as I'm describing?

          "description": "I updated org yesterday from 9.4.4 to 9.4.6 and found that when marking a recurring task done, it was permanently marked DONE instead of having its timestamp updated and todo status left as TODO. An inactive timestamp was also recorded in the logbook, but LAST_REPEAT in the properties drawer was not updated.\n Looking at the version 9.4 release notes, I saw that org-loop-over-headlines-in-active-region now defaults to t. I checked the docstring, as the release notes suggest, and while I can't say that I found it very enlightening, something told me I should try changing it. I set it to nil and marking tasks done in their own file buffer started to work as before, but marking them done from the agenda was still a problem. Reading a little further, I saw a new and related variable, also defaulting to t, called org-agenda-loop-over-headlines-in-active-region. I set that to nil and now everything seems to be working as before.\n Still, after reading the docstrings and the manual, I don't understand what these variables really do. Plus, since the release notes are for 9.4 I imagine they were already defaulting to t in 9.4.4, which worked fine for me. Finally, I cannot seem to find anybody else having reported the same problem. All of which is to say that I am not confident that I have really solved it.

It's fairly important that I can query the data I'm storing so that I can look for interesting bits of data or trends.\n A MVP of this might be a random prompt for a handful of questions: * How do you feel right now? 0-3 * How energetic do you feel right now? 0-3\n How might y'all implement something like this?

          "description": "In my LaTeX projects, I usually have one file main.tex and sub-directories including other tex files which are ultimately included in then main.tex. The way AUCTeX handles this is by setting TeX-master to point to main. Instead of setting this variable locally in each file, I used to have a \".dir-locals\" file in each sub-directory to set TeX-master.\n Since dir-local variables are inherited, I wanted to make it so that I can set TeX-master in the root directory once for all files. For example, having the following structure:\n  - main.tex - sub1.tex - .dir-locals.el - sub/ |-- subsub1.tex |-- subsub2.tex |-- subsub |-- subsubsub1.tex |-- subsubsub2.tex \n and then have in .dir-locals.el \n lisp ((latex-mode .

I think it appeared after I marked a file for deletion in the Dired buffer with d and then deleted it with x.\n Sadly, I was not able to find anything while searching around. Google's search operators absolutely hate trying to search for a !. Even when doing stuff like intext:(\"! Dired\") or allintext:(\"! Dired\"), the AND operator didn't help much either. Not even the <string> +<string> operator worked, which is supposed to force an exact match. I also tried to search for more generalized strings, because that's what the search engine is built more towards nowadays, but even with a verbose 'exclamation mark' did not help me much.\n Thus, I gave up and came here.

          "description": "Hi all, wanted to raise a discussion about a thought I had. \n As a moderately experienced Emacs user (8 years), I've invested a LOT of time into learning and configuring Emacs (including email, RSS, browsing, calculator, etc). I can say that it does what I want and how I want it. I won't go into the fact that it's a never ending process because tastes and interests (+ jobs) change. \n I would reckon that we all stick to Emacs, at least in some small part due to the sunk cost fallcy. Basically it means a price already paid in the past on our actions keep influencing our decisions in the future even though it shouldn't. From the link: \n  \nPeople demonstrate \"a greater tendency to continue an endeavor once an investment in money, effort, or time has been made.\"\n  \nThe question of whether the time invested in Emacs is worth the productivity gained is discussed here all the time. My view is to justify it by a combination of the following: believing in FOSS, (related to that) text centricity, and it could be viewed as a mental hobby, a creative outlet. \n However I might admit that I exhibit some sunk cost fallacy thinking. It becomes clear when I realize that I WON'T recommend Emacs to new users - unless they are going to invest large amounts of time learning it, like I did. \n What are your thoughts on this? would you admit that there's some irrational thinking in choosing Emacs over some other tools, e.g. the longer you use it the more you're convinced it's the best even though new tools are keep being developed.\n    submitted by    /u/Deep-Fox6860  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm glad I know them but they weren't for me.)\n Recently I redefined the evil-insert function to add toggle-korean-input-method to the end, and this achieved what should be the default behavior for Vim/Evil Mode imo, switching the language input method to what it was before leaving input mode last time.\n I won't reproduce the whole redefined function since all I did was repeat the whole function in my init.el while adding one line after (evil-insert-state 1), like this:\n (evil-insert-state 1) (toggle-korean-input-method) )) \n The obvious solution might have been to advise the function, which was the first thing I tried but it resulted in breaking the evil-insert function. Here's the advice I tried:\n (advice-add 'evil-insert :after #'toggle-korean-input-method) \n Maybe I did it wrong but it made Evil Mode unusable, and the Emacs manual says advising a function called by other functions is is bad practice so I went with redefinition, clunky though it is.\n Frankly I don't entirely understand why this works the way it does, but it's made me very happy and maybe it'll be helpful to others :)\n    submitted by    /u/lj-read-it  \n [link]   [comments]",

Only when used correctly can they help you actually get real work done. \n It hasn't taken me long to figure out that the only real way to \"master\" (use competently) org-mode/emacs is to just dive in, figure out what YOU want out of your management system, and go for it. \n if you find your self at a dead end, it's probably not a limitation of the system, but a limitation on your specificity of your goal / problem. \n However complex, labyrinth-ian both systems get, they will never be outpaced by other \"note taking \" apps . \n Why? \n ‚Äã\n because org-mode and emacs are both more about the processing of text than simply note-taking. \n ‚Äã\n I really think that the future of org-mode however, is to move away from some of the architectural constraints of emacs.\n    submitted by    /u/SpellLegitimate  \n [link]   [comments]",

The cl-loop is supposed to set variables in a let* manner, but when that with is called, drow is still unset. That's why I do the setq later.\n Second, cl-sort is destructive, so I thought I'd be able to copy the value into tmp-drow and avoid the rearranging of pointers that it performs.

          "description": "I have used lsp mode with web mode along with some other minor modes for web app developments. But the performance was too bad for me, of course i don't have a state of art computer (pretty old one actually), but thats really no excuse for pure performance, by poor performance i meant ram usage, speed, processor usage etc. For example when working on a react project in typescript (tsx created by CRA), the ram usage increased up to several gb and eventually or immediate there were input lags and really slow and sluggish performance. meanwhile i found vscode very performant on same machine on same project. lsp isn't slow for any other mode, i use it frequently for go, python, c/c++, they work smoothly. Then i tried out tide in web mode, and boy it was a good change. tide works out of the box, very well, fast enough and it didn't eat up so much ram either. i am not very familiar to elisp tracebacks, so just moved on to tide, instead of going deeper. i feel somewhat guilty for that, but i just don't know where to start or where to look at, cause lsp-mode code is huge and i don't know where to begin.\n Anyway, did anyone else have this problem? If so, did you find any solution? I looked into the git issues but not much luck. I am liking tide very much, great project.\n If you are wondering about my emacs configs here they are.\n    submitted by    /u/AsifShimon  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm also looking to integrate org-roam in my workflow as soon as v2 is stable.\n We've only recently been handed work laptops, so currently I'm travelling with both laptops, which is not really convenient. As the work laptop (Windows 10) is heavily secured (no admin access, no installs of apps in user context either, lots of security-related logging and alerts, ssh client disabled), I guess that the only way to use emacs on this thing is over https (which is monitored as well, mind you). I do have experience with self-hosting some stuff on my own domain, so I'm looking for a web application I can self-host which allows me to use emacs over a web browser.\n There are many pieces of information about this, such as\n  \nshell apps: gotty, web-console, gateone, shellinabox, butterfly, webssh: most seem no longer maintained and there's no clear indication regarding conflicts with key mappings between the browser/app and emacs ;\n more specific emacs/orgmode apps: cloudmacs, organice, orgmodweb, filestash, org-web: they are more limited by nature, but I might use them if they have support for custom agenda views which I use heavily ;\n the use of chrome web app mode or spacemacs to resolve the keymapping problem.\n  \nSo, before going through each and every combination, or having to torture my muscle memory, does anybody have a thorough (and positive) experience of using emacs, or at least org-mode, in a browser on a daily basis ?\n    submitted by    /u/Born-Deranged  \n [link]   [comments]",

At 1st I just want to have a single web page, where I post a professional photo of myself with a hyperlink to my github projects. Eventually, I would like to do full blown blog posts with all kinds of stuff, like for example, if I'm applying for a particular freelance project, lets say python web scraping, I would want to create a simple python web-scraping application, push the completed project to github, then write a blog post, where I show step by step with coding blocks, how I developed and built the application from scratch. That way I can demonstrate to the client that I have the necessary skills required to complete that particular freelance gig.\n If there's any extra wordpress themes/plugins that you'd recommend for this use-case, then let me know.\n Also, I'm new to wordpress, so I'm not sure how remote wordpress development works, I would like to develop the blog using emacs on my laptop, test it to make sure that it works correctly and does not crash wordpress, then push the changes remotely to wordpress on the pi linux web server.\n Thanks in advance for the help!\n    submitted by    /u/zeta_00  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello everyone,\n TL;DR: How to get M-. and M-, to work in geiser / guile the way they work for emacs lisp?\n I hope I chose the right community to ask this. Feel free to tell me if I didn't, and suggest where to ask otherwise. I am an aspiring lisp / scheme hacker. One thing that I would really get into is gnu guix, the distro which is powered by the guile programming language. \n So far, all my attempts to combine emacs and geiser whilst hacking guix have gone suboptimally. The main thing that doesn't work for me is the ability to jump to a symbol's definition using M-. or M-,. This is what I have used browsing emacs lisp code, and I feel this is instrumental to learning the language and how stuff works when you kinda know the basics, but not more than that.\n Thus, I would love to know how I would have to set guile and geiser up so that I will be able to use that most useful function.\n Maybe I am missing something super obvious here that I have not mentioned.

The bad thing is the ids are UUIDs meaning they contain no information whatsoever on what they‚Äôre actually for. This is annoying when you‚Äôre editing a link (IMHO).\n So I made something that creates human readable links. This turns out to be a bit involved, as generating UUIDs is stuck somewhere deep inside another function you really don‚Äôt want to mess with (separation of concerns apparently is not a thing in org-id code?).\n What it does is when you store a link ( C-c l) it checks whether there already is an ID property.

          "description": "Hello Everyone. I'm using Emacs everywhere - on my linux laptop and work mac laptop, and whenever I get a chance I'll use my large monitor for better screen real estate. I'm determined to use one init.el file, rather than maintaining several.\n I find I need to adjust the default font anytime I switch machines or screen sizes. On the Mac, I want Emacs to use Menlo, but on Linux I want FiraCode. When I'm not plugged into the monitor, I want size 11, but I need it the font at size 14 on large resolutions (i.e., greater than 1600).\n I'm just starting to learn elisp, so I get into trouble pretty quickly. I was hoping to craft something like the following, but also taking into account (string-equal system-type \"darwin\"). and swapping FiraCode for Menlo in that situation.\n ;; set the font size based on resolution (if (> (x-display-pixel-width) 1600) (add-to-list 'initial-frame-alist '(font . \"Fira Code-11\")) (add-to-list 'default-frame-alist '(font . \"Fira Code-14\"))) \n Then, it occurred to me that I'm not unique in my situation, and I should just ask if anyone else has Elisp that handles this situation. Will you Emacs wizards share Elisp where you handle this sort of thing?\n In the meantime, I'm off to find a good Elisp tutorial so I won't need to ask for this kind of help in the future. Much appreciated.\n    submitted by    /u/cmjennings  \n [link]   [comments]",

I've written a linear algebra library in Elisp so from a straight coding point of view I'm okay, but I'm not very verse in how to interact with the Emacs ecosystem.\n What I'd like to do is to write simplified version of the ob-clojure. One that doesn't depend on running CIDER. The current integration with CIDER seems to be a legacy requirement from when Clojure didn't come with a REPL.\n I'm currently use Octave in a literate mode and it's pretty great. I can make plots in-line to my notes and then export it all to HTML. ex: https://geokon-gh.github.io/rocks/orbital.html . With Clojure the equivalent is a bit problematic b/c the core language is very bare so you need to use libraries and this is all managed typically through a deps.edn central config file (or in ob-clojure's case, lein). So that suddenly is not very REPL-y and orthogonal to the literal workflow.\n Fortunately this seems to be something you can get around now a days withadd-lib https://insideclojure.org/2018/05/04/add-lib/\n The idea would be to launch an inferior clj process with something like\n clj -Sdeps \"{:deps {org.clojure/tools.deps.alpha {:mvn/version \\\"0.11.935\\\"}}}\" \n Then you can in a literate way, add libraries on the fly and do the normal literate workflow like in Octave.\n I found a template for how to write a new language support https://code.orgmode.org/bzg/worg/raw/master/org-contrib/babel/ob-template.el\n It seems relatively straightforward - but I'm unclear on how to launch a clj inferior mode and pipe things in/out of it. Is there some canonical way to do that? (I'm okay if this only works on Linux)\n Any just general tips and suggestions would be welcome :) and if this is all a bit more complicated than I make it out to be, please let me know.

That Time Has Come to refactor while preserving the muscle memory of my existing bindings. \n I'm aware of bind-key.el and general.el. Bind-key is sweet, especially for the tight integration with use-package, but I think I need something with a bit more beef, like general.el, not least for its concept of layers, something I crudely reinvented in my own system. \n I'm also considering -- seriously! -- the native menu system in Emacs. I don't know why it's so disliked. It's essentially a visual leader-key framework built rather elegantly from keymaps. No need for which-key.el or transient.el for prompting and discoverability. You can even use it with a mouse of course. I figure that I can't go wrong sticking with a framework already built into Emacs.\n An essential requirement for me: I code in Org Babel. I already structure my keybinding code with Org outlines and tagging to make it all easily navigable. This approach I need to keep. \n Am I overlooking any packages? I'm facing a year of work. Naturally I must start off right. BTW, I've never used Vim and I am not interested in going down the pure Evil route as in Spacemacs, super-impressive though it is.

Since this will only ever be invoked from a buffer where you are viewing an email, the template can include clever things, like a link to the email you want to reply to. There is a good example here.\n It seems to me the obvious thing to do is to make this whole process as seamless as possible, and just make the TODO entry a link to a response---the template should include an org link which, when activated, opens a reply message to the original message, just as if I had pressed r in gnus.\n The 'just as if...' is the tricky bit. I make extensive use of posting styles, and keep all of my email config in gnus.el, which is only initialised when gnus is loaded. I want all this to apply properly when I follow the link, even if I don't happen to have opened gnus directly yet in that session (obviously, the link will still have to trigger loading gnus.el). I think this rules out a simply mailto link.\n Even if it didn't, I'm not sure if mailto links can do responses. Standard responses, as written in gnus and pretty much everything else, are generated from the original email (to the original sender, subject should be Re: original subject and so on).\n I know that org links can include arbitrary elisp. Perhaps the answer is a function (a preexisting one, or a wrapper around such), and clever use of some of the org capture expandos?\n How might I do this? Any ideas would be great.

I'm still trying to figure out the best way of navigating around, and this question is very vague. \n I mainly do embedded linux work. And it kind of seems to me like there are two approaches to navigating to files as you work on a project. \n The first approach is that you open a terminal, and move around with cd. When you find a file you want to edit you open up emacs for that particular file, then close emacs when you are done editing. \n The the second approach is that you just open emacs, and navigate using dired or going to recently opened buffers, never closing emacs. I might also have a terminal open to try running the code.\n It seems to me that emacs lends itself more to the second approach, and perhaps vim is more suited for the first? No idea if that is true, but I've kind of settled into the second approach. I also have just been using the emacs GUI which I also imagine also lends itself to the second approach. \n I'm curious how other people have their workflow setup. Anyone else run emacs in a GUI along side a terminal, or is that just weird? \n Thanks, \n -Hunter\n    submitted by    /u/EMWaveHunter  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I installed which-key today to discover available key bindings. Problem is, if I type C-x, which key shows some bindings in the mini buffer, which often does not fit there, and it shows 1/3 (page 1 of 3). But how do I get to page 2 or 3? If I click on the mini buffer or click on the scroll bar of mini buffer, or type anything else, the mini buffer disappears! What to do?\n Update: After further observation, I noticed two things:\n  \nI was wrongly using the next page command. I should have been using 'C-h n C-h n' to get to third page of which-key popup window instead of 'C-h n n'\n \nHowever, if I use C-h, when the which-key popup window opens up now with available key binding information, it has now two pages, and I cannot use 'C-h n' to get to the 2nd page. As soon as I type C-h, emacs interprets it as me invoking C-h C-h and reacts accordingly. How do I solve this case?\n \n    submitted by    /u/Imagi007  \n [link]   [comments]",

If I understand correctly, this requires that I specify the commands that are to be autoloaded in a :commands block. For some modes, I have found that this is easy and it works. However, for some modes like geiser, I've tried specifying the obvious entry points (e.g. geiser, run-geiser, and geiser-repl) but portions of geiser are still loading and being shown in the features variable. Is there a way to determine what is causing these features to be loaded? I have tried with :defer set both to t and nil with no effect. Perhaps one complication is that geiser already defines some autoload functions (none of which should be called during initialization, I think) and I am not sure how those interact with :commands and :defer.\n    submitted by    /u/_chococat_  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I'd like to hear about the layouts you've selected, particularly the placement of modifiers to be harmonious with Emacs keystrokes.\n Background, for normal, sane people who don't know what I'm talking about:\n One rabbit-hole on the edge of the custom / mechanical keyboard world is minimizing the number of keys so your fingers never have to stray far from the home row. Some boards, like the Ferris, have only 34 or 36 keys so you are never more than one key away.\n These keyboards make heavy use of 'layers' - additional custom 'modifier' keys you hold down to generate numbers, symbols, arrow and function keystrokes etc..\n For this, keys do double-duty where tapping generates a character, but holding down applies a modifier. E.g. you may have shift on F, so tapping F makes an f character, but holding it down while tapping another key it applies shift to that other key. This is referred to as \"home row modifiers\". Typically you'd make it symmetrical, with J as another shift, so you can use opposing hands for modifier and keystroke.\n But with Emacs, you often type modifier-key sequences that travel around the keyboard, like C-x C-k, for which alternating hands would be awkward. So I'm interested in the directions people have gone with their own keymap and what they've settled on.\n I'm playing with a Ferris Sweep, developing my own keymap, mostly as a 'game' in my spare time, but it may yet work out and become my working keyboard. I'm thinking of having Ctrl on a thumb just to deal with these Emacs sequences.\n    submitted by    /u/Private_Frazer  \n [link]   [comments]",

However, it looks like each face is assigned to a single color, so I would have to figure out how to switch to a different face for each sentence in a paragraph.

          "description": "I never used EXWM, but if I'm not wrong it allows you to switch between different workspaces, where each workspace has its own frame configuration. For instance, I can do a vertical split in workspace 1, than move to workspace 2 which will be a new empty frame, not vertically splitted. Then, if I want I can move back to workspace 1 and find again the vertical split and the buffers opened in that workspace. I didn't manage to find anything similar to this for regular Emacs, every time I want to open a new empty frame without changing the configuration of the frame I'm currently using, I need to open a new Emacs X window, while I would like to do everything in the same Emacs window. Why you don't just use EXWM, you might ask. Because for now I'm quite skeptical about its usefulness for me, so I want to take my time to understand if it's something that might actually improve my workflow. In the meanwhile, I would really love a feature like the one described above. I started only very recently to use Emacs so sorry if the feature I'm looking for is something obvious or basic.

I thought a way for me to get into using emacs would be learning a new language, and looked into C++. I found this great guide for using C++ with emacs, but frankly I'm a bit intimidated by how many extensions and how much configuration are required. It makes me want to just use a more standard IDE.\n I guess I have two questions for more experienced users: 1. Am I looking at this the wrong way? Is coding with emacs at odds with using an IDE, and I should be looking at a different work flow entirely, rather than forcing emacs to have ide like features? 2.

          "description": "Hello there,\n https://github.com/overdr0ne/gumshoe\n What is it?\n Gumshoe quietly keeps tabs on your movements so you can retrace your steps if you ever need a reminder. It does not keep track of every move you make, rather, only when you exceed some minimum Euclidean distance from the last tracked position, like a leash, or when you idle in one place for a while. It is a lot like the global-mark-ring, but expanded, and a lot like Evil's jump list, but works more generically.\n Why?\n Basically, I tend to get lost when searching around large code bases(yes, lsp and tags help a lot too), or when I‚Äôm getting lots of interruptions, or when I just sorta space out... Specifically, I made this as a replacement for Vim‚Äôs jump list which, in Evil‚Äôs implementation at least, logs only for certain evil commands-- not at all general, and just doesn‚Äôt work when you‚Äôre not using evil for movement. I found a few other movement tracking packages, and the global-mark-ring, but they were either too manual, or had bad granularity of tracking, so I made this and thought I'd share.\n Does anyone do anything similar?

In my role I find my reading notes often come in handy because I am asked to articulate a position or make some recommendation on something, but I think it would feel strange to start to have a mass of notes on the internal workings of my employer.

          "description": "Reading Christian Tietze's and Sascha Fast's blog posts on the importance of tracking inspired me to track how many Zettels I create.\nI figured that keeping a list of Zettels created daily would be useless without a workflow to integrate it in. So, I watched Brian Crain's presentation on optimizing productivity, which was cited in one of the blog posts from the Zettelkasten blog. Also, I read this article from the Quantified Self website that I found along the way.\nI decided that I want to do something similar to Brian Crain. From tracking how many pomodori he completed, he gained the ability to achieve two things: notice a standard for his good days/weeks/months/quarters/years, and compare how well he did with how well he is doing. I want to achieve the same from tracking how many Zettels I create.\nFrom looking at his setup, I'd have to track the following:\nTotal from a year\nTotal from the first to the fourth quarters\nMonthly average\nWeekly average\nNumber of weeks in which I get my weekly average or above it\nDaily average\nNumber of days in which I get my daily average or above it\nHe tracked more, but this is all I could understand from his presentation and slides.\nMy problem is setting up an user interface to manage all of this in a way that is simple and allows me to get every item easily. Brian Crain didn't talk much about his setup. Also, I have zero knowledge in using spreadsheets. So the question is: How do I achieve what I want to accomplish?\nReally appreciate any help you can give me.",

Greetings!\nI have kept a paper zettelkasten for the past six months or so, which has benefitted from everyone's discourse and guidance here. So, thank you all! I hope to contribute a meager offering now and then to this already robust discussion forum.\nRelated to my zettelkasten, I use 3x5 index cards filed in an Amazon prime shipping box--it quickly became too unruly for a small file box. I also have experimented with some GTD task management systems in there as well, though my zettelkasten is still the star of the show. I file them using folgezettel numbering, which has proved to be a dangerous business, although I am beating it into submission slowly but surely. The folgezettel debates and related articles are quite fascinating.\nThe subject matter in my zettelkasten began, as is customary, with zettelkasten itself, but quickly branched out to catalog all of my various other record keeping systems: bullet journaling, morning pages, hobonichi 5-year, and filing methods. It's true that I am a stationary person first and foremost, and that's probably why I chose a paper system.\nI also am particularly interested in how one might use the zettelkasten to chronicle their own personal experiences in the world to create meaning. I found How to Take Smart Notes rather confining in that it had a strong bias towards synthesizing academic research. I'd like to pivot away from academic towards the subjective. I hope maybe by using my zk to record stories and experiences, it could one day contribute to a work of fiction or memoire.\nAnyways, looking forward to continuing to follow this forum and learning from everyone's expertise!

I love to read what others are saying about their adventures.  Reading the discussions, in that and other threads, sometimes makes my head hurt.  I'm not sure if I'm smart enough to think so abstractly about such things.  I admire all those here who share their thoughts about how they think about thinking.\nI did not want to interrupt or hijack that discussion, but I would like to share my initial reaction:  \"What would a Shared Zettelkasten look like?\".\nI think that I understand, from what I've read here, and elsewhere, that a Zettelkasten is a personal database, where one keeps notes and builds upon research and thoughts which are read and created while living life.  The hope is to generate and discover new and interesting things while revisiting and exploring new and unfamiliar territory.\nThe basis of my question is, why should everyone have to start from zero and build upon things that they happen to discover.  The \"standing on the shoulders of giants\" resonates with me.  I'm just wondering if there is some way to share a Zettelkasten (or many).  Maybe this does not make any sense.  Maybe this already exists (Yahoo groups, Discord, Discourse, Reddit, etc.)?\nJust wondering if anyone else has any similar thoughts.",

E.g.: In my first, failed Zettelkasten attempt, I had a Zettel on the Feynman Technique. In that Zettel, I cited some random blog post I found. I had doubts about the technique, so I read another random blog post. This resulted in a Zettel that looked something like this:\nSome description of what the technique is about [citekey1][citekey2].\n\nThe steps:\n\n1. do x [citekey1][citekey2].\n2. do y [citekey1][citekey2]. Optionally, do z [citekey1].\n3. do a [citekey1][citekey2].\n4. do b [citekey2].\n\nYou do step number two because of reason c [citekey2].\n\nI ask:\nIf I had wanted to show how the two sources differed in their description of the technique, was the resulting Zettel the best way to do so, or should I have made separate Zettels for each source?\nIn general, how should I approach citations in my Zettelkasten so I don't question what I do like in the scenario described?\nI appreciate your comments in advance.",
