It's capabilities are way beyond what I experienced back when I was last writing Haskell and has made it so much easier to quickly look up documentation and get autocomplete without having to scroll through hackage documentation for all of the functions and types that I forget.\n However, my experience using it with neovim has been less than stellar. I seem to have nothing but issues with it, and I can't tell if it's a neovim problem or an HLS problem. I'm using the haskell-tools.nvim plugin with the standard nvim-cmp and lspconfig plugins. Most other language servers work reasonably well, but this one seems particularly finicky and I can't figure out why.\n I'm currently having an issue where if I type anything for about 4-6 seconds after opening the first haskell file in the editor (while the language server is starting) it causes HLS to completely hang and become unresponsive. I'm also having issues with nvim-cmp screaming at me about misplaced dollar signs in snippets (I'm assuming because the haskell suggestions contain things like $ and $!).\n I decided to temporarily install vscode to see if that would do it. Everything worked completely flawlessly out of the box, absolutely no issues. The problem is, I would really rather not use vscode if I don't absolutely have to.\n Has anyone been able to get a working config for haskell in neovim that plays nice? I'm thinking of maybe scrapping haskell-tools and configuring things directly to see if that helps, otherwise I've spent so much time fiddling with the editor that I may have to leave it and come back later when things improve.\n    submitted by    /u/lucid00000  \n [link]   [comments]",

To have a computational effect, there must be function application involved, so it uses terms like functorial context, applicative effect and monadic effect. However, it confuses me because the functor (->) a represents function application, as with State s and Reader r.\n Thanks\n    submitted by    /u/Reclusive--Spikewing  \n [link]   [comments]",

So I cannot simply complie this with `ghc test.hs`, since I will get the complaint that ghc cannot find the module I need.\n So what is the recommended work around? I know you can use cabal or stack to build a project and the specify dependencies in the .cabal file. But this seems heavy duty for a single haskell file. Specifically, using `cabal init` will create a directory `app`, the file `CHANGELOG.md`, and the .cabal file, just for this single haskell file. Further `cabal init` asks quite a lot, including asking about which license to use, leading me to believe `cabal init` is meant for much more heavy duty projects.\n Using stack has a similar amount of, if not more, overhead.\n tldr; Is using `cabal init` or `stack new` the best way to create a stand alone `.hs` file depend on hidden packages?

          "description": "I'm working my way through the excellent Crafting Interpreters book and decided to do the first part in Haskell instead of Java. Everything has been going swimmingly until we got to closures, which introduced a subtle problem involving variable shadowing. To fix this, the book introduces a semantic analysis pass where all the variables get resolved to their proper scope before any actual interpreting happens.\n This analysis pass uses a Map Expression Int, mapping from an expression to a location in the stack of scopes of the program where the variable can be found. In Java, because `Expression` is a separate object with its own object ID, this works out fine. In my Haskell version I have implemented Expression something like the following:\n data Expression = Grouping Expression\n | Unary UnaryOperation Expression\n | Binary BinaryOperation Expression Expression\n | Literal LiteralContents\n | Variable String\n | Assignment String Expression\n -- etc\n deriving (Show,Eq,Ord)\n This has worked very well so far, however it does introduce a problem with regards to the Map Expression Int: Any Variable \"abc\" will be considered equal, even if they come from very different nodes in the AST. The derived functions for Eq will not do here.\n What is the recommended way to solve this? So far I've come up with:\n  \nTry and fake the Java way of object equality by using `StablePtr` and friends, though that may not work too well with the (hash)map.\n Add a unique integer to every node in the AST to disambiguate them.\n Add the original source location to every Expression, so that different references to the same variable would be disambiguated by their source location. This feels a bit dirty though, since it would bleed implementation details from the scanner/parser into the interpreter.\n  \n   submitted by    /u/WJWH  \n [link]   [comments]",

For example, I can see how Yesod handles messages and keeps type safety. But not being able to add a new language or reword things without recompilng is more than a bit meh to my eye.\n In my current application, I'm looking at calendar definitions. I'd like to be able to have a file saying \"Pentecost is the 50th day after Easter Sunday. Easter Sunday is supposed to have a definition but it got messed up and it's now effectively an arbitary list of dates. Australia Day is on the 26th of January.\" etc. etc. and then, if I'm reading JSON and there is a named calendar, just get the calendar defintiion.

But in the ghcup tui all tools are marked with a grey check mark (with a little \"1\"), if I try to set a tool as default. I would expect two green check marks.\n On my Laptop everything works as expected. I don't know why it in not working on my PC. Any idea?\n Edit: I completely removed .ghcup and .cabal folders from my home directory and installed everything from scratch. With the same result.\n I can install everything and get a green check mark, but if I try to set it with \"s\" I get the single grey check mark with a \"1\"\n I think I found the answer. The problem is the font I use in the terminal. The check marks change depending on the font I use. If I use DejaVu Sans Mono I see two green check marks. Some other fonts show two grey check marks. I assume that what I thought was a \"1\" is actually a cut-off second hook.\n    submitted by    /u/Voxelman  \n [link]   [comments]",

Loading an image representation from a jpg file runs substantially slower than doing the same thing in other compiled languages, like Go and Nim.\n 2) Friday seems pretty far out-of-date, and I run into dependency conflicts when I try to use friday-devil.\n Can anyone suggest alternate possibilities? Or is there something more I could do with Juicy Pixels, to run it more efficiently? I tried adding ghc-options: -O2 in the executable stanza of my cabal file, but this didn't have any discernible effect.\n To further complicate things, ideally I'd like to find a solution that allows compiling the program as a static binary.

I have managed to implement everything up to appending trees, which is what this question is about. \n Source code exists here. Because it was a lot of work trying to figure out exactly how to implement append, I reused the functions in the source code. In my version, however, I do not use a Measured (there is no value, this comes later in the paper). Apart from that, everything is the exact same. However, on every single function (appendDigits1, appendDigits2, appendTree1, etc.) there is the error described in the title whenever I use Node2 or Node3 as an input for any of the functions that expects a as an input. For example: \n addDigits1 m1 (One a) b (One c) m2 = appendTree1 m1 (Node3 a b c) m2 \n causes the error in the title, where \n appendTree1 :: FingerTree (Node a) -> a -> FingerTree (Node a) -> FingerTree (Node a) \n This is of course strange, because in the source code, they use the exact same abstraction where they feed appendTree1 a Node type as second input, without trouble. When I edit all occurrences of a to Node a, the error simply moves to the Node type itself, saying that Node3 constructor cannot take Node a as an input and expects a, even though Node3 (Node2 a b) (Node2 c d) (Node2 e f) is a perfectly valid output.

Around the time I left the standard way seemed to define all your effects through composing the various Monads provided by mtl. Towards the end of my time with Haskell however the consensus seemed to be forming that you really only need Reader over IO, using a sort of \"God Object\" like AppT or Env that holds all of your configurations and application state, and you would define more granular \"XMonad, YMonad, ZMonad\" types for particular effects, which the base AppT would then instance.\n Coming back I see a lot of buzz around algebraic effects, in particular polysemy seems to be the standout example. It seems pretty ergonomic, although I still have no clue how type level lists work or when they were introduced, so that's something I'll have to get up to speed on.

          "description": "Topps Euro 2024 Stickers Tracker\n Hi everyone!\n In case anyone is collecting the Topps stickers for the current Euro 2024 tournament, I have created a small program which keeps track of your duplicates and the ones you still need.\n Essentially, you add the stickers you've got in files/Got.txt and it generates a list with your duplicates (together with how many extra copies of each sticker you've got) and the ones you still need. See the readme file for more instructions.\n This should work as it is, although there is still some room for improvement. Most importantly, how to print proper umlauts instead of escape characters in the files and how not to surround strings with \"\". If anyone knows the solution to this please chime in! :)\n I hope this would be of help to someone. It certainly is it me as I couldn't find a similar app for this tournament.\n Happy swapping!\n    submitted by    /u/marullos_trahaniotis  \n [link]   [comments]",

We have had some success via this subreddit in the past, so the content of this post may ring a bell to some.\n Chordify is a music platform that you can use to automatically detect the chords in any song you like. This way we help musicians to play all of their favourite music in an easy and intuitive way. You can try it at https://chordify.net\n Now, the backend for our website and apps, that are used by millions of people worldwide, is written in Haskell! We serve the user using primarily Servant, Persistent and Esqueleto. We also make use of a custom Redis caching layer; you may know us from https://hackage.haskell.org/package/redis-schema\n We are looking for a new proactive, independent and creative functional programmer to improve the Chordify backend infrastructure, core technology, and launch new ideas to join our team of experienced developers in our offices in Utrecht or Groningen. You'd get the opportunity to work with advanced type systems to power a website that serves millions.\n More information (e.g. expectations, salary range, secondary benefits) and a form to apply can be found at https://jobs.chordify.net. If you have any questions, feel free to ask them in this thread, or reach out to me at [menno@chordify.net](mailto:menno@chordify.net) \n We strive for diversity in our team, and encourage people of all backgrounds and genders to apply.\n For transparency: this is explicitly NOT a remote job. We do allow working from home, but expect our colleagues to be in the office at least 50% of their time.\n    submitted by    /u/Luchtverfrisser  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I'm relatively new to Haskell programming, so please don't be too harsh if this is a silly question.\n There's a particular behaviour I'm accustomed to in vscode with other languages that Haskell's extension doesn't seem to provide, and I'm curious if any solution is available.\n In most languages, when you type out a functions name and then type the opening bracket for the function call, you get a popup showing the function signature, as well as the name of each function parameter as you type.\n In Haskell, you only get the function signature popup when you're typing the name of the function itself, so you have to memorize the order of the function parameters, then go about actually typing them out. Sometimes, when there's an error over a function, you don't even get the popup when you hover over the function name, meaning you have to go elsewhere and type out the function name to check the order of its arguments.\n Some of this annoyance seems to be down to a fundamental incompatibility between Haskell and vscode; vscode expects a C-style language, where function calls are characterized by brackets, so can't understand function calls without brackets. It also obviously can't give parameter names, since parameters in Haskell can have multiple names because of pattern matching.\n Is there any solution to this issue, or is it just an annoyance you have to deal with?\n    submitted by    /u/ZestyGarlicPickles  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Greetings, I'm working on my computer science master's thesis and I'm having trouble finding open-source standalone tools or Intellij/VS code plugins that would provide me with code quality metrics through static analysis on package, class, and/or method levels. Most of what I've found were refactoring or lining tools, and a few paid tools/services that would give me somewhat useful metrics. \n I reckon I could cobble something together that I could use but it would be a significant time investment. So, I figured I could ask the Scala community for recommendations before I start doing it myself. Any suggestions?\n P.S. The list of metrics that I'm interested in isn't that strict, but generally, it should be at least one of these metric sets: Maintainability Index, Halstead metrics, QMOOD metrics, MOOD metrics, and a few others.\n P.P.S. \"MetricsTree\" would be an ideal tool if it weren't capable of handling only Java source code. I thought about compiling scala code and then decompiling class files into Java source code but that can skew the metrics too much. \n    submitted by    /u/Plane-Objective-8856  \n [link]   [comments]",

We got a lot going on right now and upgrading sbt is not something we want to do in the next month (we have 2 months to transition to VS Code). \n From what I understand, to get any kind of useful IDE features in VS Code, you need to use Scala Metals, but Scala metals only works with sbt 1.0+? \n I tried running some basic metals commands and they don't seem to exist for my version of sbt.

To add, diffs show spaces and, its like mostly obvious which indentation level it is. If it isn't, you have indent rainbow, which trivializes tracking.\n Same story with merge conflicts - sometimes you would be able to get braces mismatch regardless, and its harder to fix than indentation mismatch. \n Well, now we have (), that are the second source of unpronouceable clutter, and [] which are, as well, in some places, yet not as common.

Here are the details of the two offers:\n 1. First Offer: This is a B2B position in a well-established outsourcing company focused on a betting project. The project is run out of Poland and involves working with Scala on a platform that is already up and running for a major client in the betting industry. The role offers about 50-60% higher compensation compared to the second option. The job provides a flexible work schedule, allowing for mid-day breaks like going to the gym. However, I have some ethical concerns regarding working in the betting industry. 2. Second Offer: This is a permanent employment (CIM) position at another outsourcing company, but on a project that is just about to start. The project involves Python and AWS, and the salary is lower. The work hours are strict, from 9 to 18, with little flexibility. \n Given the market trends, I’m inclined towards the more stable option, even though stability sometimes seems illusory if the employer decides to let you go. I have experience with both Scala and Python and try to remain language-agnostic in my career.\n My question for you is:\n • Considering the current state and future of Scala in the industry, do you think the first offer has a significant advantage in terms of career development? \n Thank you for your help!\n    submitted by    /u/korash04  \n [link]   [comments]",

The documentation is very short and to be honest i feel like it doesn't cover even half of questions one can have while learning the library. There are only few examples for the most basic cases, then when it comes to the Contexts section there are almost none. I have no idea when to use \"lazy val ctx = new PostgresJdbcContext(SnakeCase, \"ctx\")\" and when to simply use \"quill: Quill.Postgres[SnakeCase]\" from the Getting Started section.\n There are 6 JDBC dialects provided by the library - H2Dialect, MySQLDialect, PostgresDialect, SqliteDialect, SQLServerDialect, OracleDialect. I wanted to ask if Quill can also be used for other databases maybe for some more generic queries, or is it better to choose a different tool for other RDB?\n    submitted by    /u/Time_Competition_332  \n [link]   [comments]",

I got very interesting because it sounded completely different from OOP and maybe knowing both could enhance my skill set and problem solving.\n Anyway, I started learning, and immediately hit the wall with all 3rd party libraries and understanding what is useful, what is not. What libraries I should learn, which I should not. Seems that Scala without Cats is not pure FP. There is a akka library, which is so big and heavy, that I even consider If I want to touch that.\n In .NET you kinda have everything out of the box, most of the thing you want to achieve, you can by using standart library. And in Scala, seems that standart library is minimal on purpose.\n I would like to ask if anyone could share some tips or steps in understanding what should I learn in Scala. What are you actually using in your work environment. In real life scenarios.\n I feel like choice fatigue is starting to settle in me.\n    submitted by    /u/uwuuwywu  \n [link]   [comments]",

Right now I’m looking at Scala, and I really like its features. However, the jvm dependency, while great for some purposes (I do a lot of work in clojure), is a concern for others. One reason I’m looking at compiled languages is for building cli tools as static binaries that can be flexibly copied into docker containers, over ssh, etc.\n I’m curious how practical scala native would be for this purpose, or if I’d be better off using another language for cli tools.

The server does the following things:\n  \nManages user sessions and injects user auth to all requests (to resolve an issue with opening protected raw files in new tabs, which is probably a terrible idea that needs rework anyways)\n Proxies paths starting with /api to backend servers\n Interprets other paths as paths to static files and serves them, if they exist\n Finally serves index.html if paths don't match anything\n  \nAll other routing is done in the SPA.\n Why do I want to rewrite the server? There is a very fine-grained role-based authorization scheme managed by the backend. For UX-reasons, some backend responses contain a permission object with some requests (e.t. GET /api/entities/ returns { data: ..., permissions: { create: true } }.\n Setting up accounts for all possible combinations of permissions is tedious, and for some combinations/new functionality, roles don't even exist yet, so I would like to inject permissions to (some) /api/... requets after they return from being proxied to the backend. Express' imperative handler will not let me access the responses after a handler has matched, but with pure functions this should be trivial.\n So, are my use cases supported/possible with HTTPurple?

While react-native-svg has served React Native developers well for basic vector graphics, it often falls short when it comes to replicating the more complex effects seen in web applications. We’ll be integrating Skia for rendering sharp, efficient 2D graphics and Reanimated for creating fluid, responsive animations. Step-by-step, we’ll explore the setup, key coding techniques, and best practices to implement a dynamic image slider that is both smooth and visually stunning.\nSkia is an open source multiplatform 2D graphics engine which supports GPU-accelerated rendering on Android, iOS and others, and can be used in the React Native ecosystem.

I think the presenter had either an Australian (or maybe Kiwi/Tassie) or South African accent.\n Any suggestions?\n Incidentally, I did ask ChatGPT for its input.

The first was David Wilson, who doesn't sound very Australian. The second was System Crafters, but that Just Is David Wilson. The third reply was the charm though, and makes me think ChatGPT must be having a particularly bad day, hallucinations-wise, because it said:\n  \n...another prominent Australian YouTuber who focuses on Emacs and Org mode is 'Protesilaos Stavrou'\n  \nAgain, I know accent doesn't map perfectly to nationality, but clearly Prot doesn't sound remotely Australian. Thing is, ChatGPT actually seemed to be \"aware\" of the issue, because it went on to say:\n  \nWhile not exclusively Australian, his content is highly relevant and valuable for Emacs and Org mode users.\n  \nSo there you go, Prot.

Almost all of my use-cases work perfectly with the export: =C-c C-e l p= and I'm done. However, sometimes I am in need of just raw regular ascii text of the content.\n Here's the problem: I write using semantic line breaks, Headers, annotations with comments, etc. All the good org-mode stuff. So I just export it to ascii instead of trying to copy from the buffer. Unfortunately, in ascii export it breaks off each line at 72 characters.\n Now, I know there is a variable (org-ascii-text-width) but I tried setting it to a very large value and it just breaks. I can't adjust this value per export. Is there any way I can just turn off the hard-line wrapping feature of the ascii export? \n Sorry for the long-winded explanation of a very simple problem, but after awhile searching I haven't found a very satisfactory answer (besides a mailing list response of 'No you can't, just write an elisp macro to undo it.)\n    submitted by    /u/lynnlei  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Think about how you probably use magit, especially the log, where you tend to visit commits alongside the history, with the log in one window and particular log items in another window. Magit has a lot of views and these views often list items that can be in turn viewed in multiple ways. This list & item interaction model has a lot of good karma with respect to both architecture and user interaction.\n I'm mainly picking on `org-agenda-list', but not using the full window width always has bad voodoo in Emacs. When I see complex agenda views with a lot of information to the right of the list of items, I think it's neat, but I also think it should be left & right window for those cases so that the functionality can be remixed and viewed in a mix & match kind of way. This is one of the main reasons I'm not building on top of agenda.\n Another reason this works with magit is because of collapseable sections for showing details of items. Vertical organization can hold arbitrary amounts of detail while left-right organization in a single window, well, this isn't a web browser. Organizing information left-right in sections and controlling reflow are likely to not obtain a good result.\n This is related to casually spiking more work on afterburner, only at the pace that I am getting value out for now.\n    submitted by    /u/Psionikus  \n [link]   [comments]",

Please help!\n Edited to add: After reading Micky Peterson's guide \"Demystifying Emacs' Window Manager\" I think I understand the display-buffer-alist better now. I also tried saving a layout to .emacs.desktop and I'm reading through that, too. I think what is causing issues for me is the Treemacs sidebar window is special and doesn't use a window.

The default is ivy--regex-plus.\n Now, it's not like Ivy is not matching the command, but it's definitely not in the top results.

And indeed, it works just fine for regular text buffers. However, I was saddened to find out it doesn't seem to work with VTERM, my terminal emulator of choice within emacs.\n Is there another mode I have failed to find?

Thanks!\n PD: To anyone who might say it might be silly to start on this if I'm new to elisp, it's the way I like to learn, doing and improving as I go, most often times it works pretty well, but in this case I'm lost as to where to start.\n Edit: I'm looking for resources, other than the Elisp manual, which is the only thing I'm currently reading but I don't know if reading the manual top to bottom will point me in the right direction, thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/Agreeable-Item-675  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I am entering my senior year of my BSc. in Data Science (primarily use R and python). I first learned about Emacs my freshman year and was intrigued by the potential -- keyboard-focused, modularity, customization, etc. I started using and configuring vanilla Emacs as my \"daily driver\" about 18mo ago. Within the last 6mo I have used `org-agenda` to organize my schedule, Jupyter notebooks for class assignments, and record most* of my notes using `denote` (*need to spend some time configuring latex for math notes). \n This summer, I completed a Data Science internship at a medium-ish sized tech company. Although most of my classwork is in Jupyter notebooks, the dev team discourages the use of notebooks. Experiments are mostly organized in python files but it does seem that others still use Jupyter notebooks to tinker with code snippets or intermediate plotting. All development is done remotely across a number of servers and docker containers.\n Needless to say, my \"little\" Emacs configuration was not up to the task. The jump from using Emacs for my homework assignments to fleshing out a reliable IDE that I can be used on the job is overwhelming. I struggle to envision how I would make that jump. I am aware of `tramp` and `lsp-bridge`, for example, but have read a lot of complaints about latency or `magit` being slow. Alternatively, one could install Emacs on given server ... but how common is it that companies allow you to do that? \n For those that use Emacs professionally: How do you use Emacs at your company? Do you run Emacs locally but develop over tramp, what is that experience like? If not, does your company allow you to install Emacs on a server? \n    submitted by    /u/Impossible_Win_9059  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Recently I found out that Emacs can deal with so-called noncontiguous regions. I cannot find very much information about these on the internet, the Emacs manual or the Emacs help system. But I'm curious about these noncontiguous regions and want to see if I can use them for something. As an example, something I want to do is to narrow to a noncontiguous region. But to be clear, narrowing to a noncontiguous region is not the problem I want solved here. I just want to learn how to use noncontiguous regions. \n I'll try to define a clear question. If I want to create a noncontiguous region that contains the columns 4 to 7 on rows 1 and 2 then I can do this using a rectangular region(at least interactively, but I imagine I can recreate that in elisp too). But what if I want to create a noncontiguous region containing columns 4 to 7 on lines 1 and 3 but not line 2. Then I cannot use rectangular regions(as far as I know). Is there a way to do this? I'm not necessarily asking for an interactive way to do it. An elisp solution is fine and even prefered. \n I've found the variable region-extract-function that perhaps could be useful, but I'm not sure how to use it. In particular, I don't know when the function that this variable is bound to is called. \n I also found the library zones.el. But from the documentation it seems like it doesn't actually define noncontiguous regions, just something that looks and feels like noncontiguous regions. So this doesn't really satisfy my curiosity. And I'm mainly interested in learning the builtin functionality, so a third party package like this isn't really what I'm looking for.\n    submitted by    /u/objective_porpoise  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I understand the title may be vague or nonsensical. But I had to make one, and that was the best I could come up with. A longer version of my question follows.\n I am an amateur Emacsist. I've got a solid understanding of all things *nix, lisp, and configuring a text editor (from prior vim experience). I've been eagerly building up a very comfortable .emacs for the past few months, and have been loving the experience in general. However, there is one thing that bothers me which I don't believe bothers others as much, if not at all: When I try to use some package that adds to or modifies the fundamental Emacs experience — something that modifies things like buffer management, text editing or whatnot — it often clashes with my own previous customizations or even default Emacs behavior. \n For instance, If I were to use a modal editing package like Evil mode, I'd need to rebind keys to work correctly for every package I added. Think Magit for instance. Another time I faced a similar issue was when I tried popper.el. It's a great package, but It's job is to augment default buffer-handing behavior. I often ran into issues where a buffer created by a function from one package ended up in the wrong place due to popper. This is not a devastating problem as I could always just place the buffer where I want it manually, but that's the point, sort of. \n I have a very large config, and adding anything that changes the fundamental experience of Emacs becomes a software project of its own with the involvement of design, and large refactors and whatnot. I wonder if that's the case with you guys.\n Does anyone else have the same experience? Is this something I just have to settle for and solve bottom-up by solving the problems as they arise?

For example, when editing a React typescript component, if i just hit <TAB>, or create a new line, it indents 4 spaces from the last line. But if I highlight the region and hit <TAB> then it seems to indent based on LSP rules and indents it by 2.\n The same is true when I'm in C++ mode. While writing, and hitting tab when I'm on the line, I get the following header:\n #pragma once namespace some_name_space { class SomeClass { public: SomeClass() private: int someMember; } } \n But if I highlight the buffer and hit <TAB>, or call lsp-format-region, then I end up with:\n #pragma once namespace some_name_space { class SomeClass { public: SomeClass(); private: int someMember; } } // namespace some_name_space \n Which i assume is different because when I do that, it's calling clang-format (based on the fact that the endspace ending comment get added.)\n Is there a way to make it so that indentations will use lsp to formatting rules if lsp mode is enabled?\n    submitted by    /u/Faleira  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi folks,\n I've been searching for a package that enables the simple \"one tab per project\" workflow, so each project is isolated in its tab.\n I used tabspaces for some time but I faced several issues with it. Then, I switched to the more lightweight project-tab-groups which creates a \"tab group\" per project, but with some limitations. The latter was simple enough to inspire me to create the package I'm looking for, one-tab-per-project (or otpp).\n The idea is simple, install the package and its dependency unique-dir-name (another package of mine, created specifically for otpp), enable otpp-mode and you are good to go. Whenever you switched to a project project-switch-project (C-x p p), otpp will switch to a dedicated tab. And in case of conflicting projects names, otpp will resolve the conflict by renaming the similar tabs.\n  \nhttps://github.com/abougouffa/one-tab-per-project\n https://github.com/abougouffa/unique-dir-name\n  \nLooking for your feedback!\n    submitted by    /u/abougouffa  \n [link]   [comments]",

Something strange is happening with the published diagnostics. Eglot is showing the actual position of the diagnostic 1 line after and 1 character before the actual reported location of the error. Here's a screenshot of the file as well as the message from the server. The error is because the 2nd line is missing a comma. As can be seen in the event log, the server is publishing the right location for the error, which is line 3 character 4. But the error actually shows up in line 4 character 3. Other language server work just fine with my emacs so it is likely that I'm doing something wrong. Is this because of a mismatch of 1-based and 0-based indexing between the server and the client? Is there a setting that I need to tweak? I took a cursory look at the LSP spec but couldn't find anything about negotiation of indexing. Any help is appreciated.\n https://preview.redd.it/vz4777rtk3bd1.png?width=670&format=png&auto=webp&s=1d727ccc966c420605209bfabc5623c978e4c23a\n This is GNU Emacs 29.1 on Windows 11.\n    submitted by    /u/samvidmistry  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I've been working on technicolor, an abstraction above the APIs that various custom themes and theme packs use to access the colors for the currently loaded theme in emacs (like doom-themes' doom-color and modus-themes' modus-themes-get-color-value).\n The impetus is straightforward: if you are a user of a variety of themes or theme packs and you want to use your current theme's color palette somewhere in elisp, but struggle to homogenize your code across all the possible themes you might have loaded at any given time, technicolor might be worth a look.\n It works by letting you define a \"universal palette\" of colors, which is a list of colors that can sensibly be accessed in a specified collection of themes, e.g. '(red green blue). You can then set rules for each theme (or group of themes) for exactly which color in the theme's palette the universal color accesses. You can set these rules on a per-theme basis within a theme pack as well.\n From there, accessing the current theme's color reduces to (technicolor-get-color 'color), where color is an element of your universal palette. Technicolor will dispatch the appropriate API function, which you might have to write yourself, depending on the theme. \n It also provides some basic color manipulation wrapping the color library, with the same ethos that accessing the colors should be via the universal palette.\n    submitted by    /u/nanowillis  \n [link]   [comments]",

If I run emacsclient E, if I C-x k on E, the client exits. However, if I C-x k on those other buffers, they're killed normally and the client continues running. Is there a way so that killing that \"E\" buffer doesn't exit the client?\n \nI need some recommendations for packages that help me handle buffers. C-x b is getting way too annoying, especially combined with the previous point where if I kill the \"launching file\" it kicks me out of the client.

Would it be possible upon opening an Inform 6 file to have the mode dynamically identify such objects and format them correctly, or is that impossible? Currently I’m having to add the names of new objects manually to the package just to get it to format code correctly, and honestly even without doing that the package seems to get confused fairly easily.\n \nAre there any good tutorials on creating a language major mode from scratch?

My configuration below modifies the `jinx-include-faces` to only check comments; text in `org-mode` and `text-mode` are also checked.\n However, I noticed that jinx behaves different in org-mode and prog-mode. Specifically, spelling errors in a comment of a code block are only flagged when I open the `org-edit-special` buffer. The text properties for a given comment in an src-block is `(font-lock-comment org-block)`. When I add `(org-mode font-lock-comment-face)` to my definition of `jinx-include-faces` spell check is effectively turned off across my `org-mode` buffer (`jinx-mode` is still active). I am aware of `jinx-exclude-faces` and that many faces in `org-mode` are excluded by default. Yet when I remove faces like `org-block` from that list, the entire src-block including variable definitions and functions are flagged as misspelled.\n Has anyone implemented `jinx` in `org-mode` in this way?\n (use-package jinx :hook (org-mode text-mode prog-mode conf-mode) :custom (jinx-include-faces '((conf-mode font-lock-comment-face) (prog-mode font-lock-comment-face)))) \n    submitted by    /u/Impossible_Win_9059  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello all!\n I've been using Emacs for a while so far, but there is a thing that bothers me quite a lot: dual-space CJK fonts and their alignment.\n CJK programming fonts usually provide both half-width characters (for Latin alphabets) and full-width characters (for CJK characters). Thus, when rendering, the width of a full-width characters must exactly equal to that of two half-width characters.\n This is where Emacs fails; even fonts like Sarasa Gothic (which I know that they line up nicely elsewhere) will not line up when I actually use them. This is especially annoying when editing tables on Org-mode or Markdown, since the columns don't line up.\n I've noticed for two Korean programming fonts I purchased (semteulche and hesalche) the characters line up if and only if the font height is set to exactly 110 and 120 respectively (or their integer multiples). I could repeat this process for all fonts, but in my HiDPI screen, I'd like to have my fonts taller than at least 130.\n Basically, what happens is below:\n \\\"hesalche\\\", height 120. They line up nicely.\n \\\"hesalche\\\", height 140 (which is my preferred font height). Columns start breaking up.\n \\\"hesalche\\\", height 240. 240 is an integer multiple of 120, so the columns are back straight.\n Is there a way to fix this problem?\n Here is the relevent section in my WIP configuration file.\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/rangho-lee  \n [link]   [comments]",

There are many commands that either create a new window or replace the current buffer with a \"temporary\" buffer (eg help window). And some commands simply replace the buffer in current window, some replace the buffer in the other window, still others create a new split. And when something takes over an existing window, sometimes when quitting it returns the previous buffer, and other times it removes the window altogether.\n So far I have not been able to discern a method to this madness and I am often surprised by what happens. A lot of winner-undo.\n First question: is there any underlying logic here I'm not seeing? Or is it just a free for all?\n Second question: how do you handle this?

Everyone else on my team uses Visual Studio (obviously) and the files are encoded with `UTF-8-BOM` or `utf-8-with-signature-dos` in Emacs speak. Emacs somehow wasn't reading these files properly and kept saying the encoding is ISO-LATIN-1 and would just print the BOM characters literally on the screen. I had no clue about all this except that I saw 3 weird characters every time I opened any file. So yesterday I decided to dig deep and gather whatever I can to fix this. After trying a few approaches what worked is `(prefer-coding-system 'utf-8-with-signature-dos)`. The files are read properly now and the language server is also happy. I use Sharper to build and run my project and it started failing after this change. It uses `shell-command-to-string` and others to run `dotnet` commands in the project. The commands fail with\n 'ï»¿dotnet' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.\n The first 3 characters are BOM and windows command prompt cannot handle this encoding. Is there a way to fix this, either from Emacs side or from the windows command prompt side?\n EDIT: This is with GNU Emacs 29.1 on Windows 11.\n    submitted by    /u/BrainFuckPlusPlus  \n [link]   [comments]",

In VSCode for example there is an option javascript.validate.enable\": false to add to the editor config and it will not validate the JS files anymore, however, it will still provide code fix suggestions, like imports for example.\n If there is no way to do this, is there a way to at least somehow get the import fixes working or connect eglot to some eslint server if such exists instead of typescript-language-server?\n Thanks!\n EDIT: \n The eglot code-actions do not work at all, I cannot fix imports anymore.

The experience was great for most of the time but sometimes I'd get terrible stuttering which I eventually diagnosed to fringe rendering.\n As it turns out, the NS redisplay draws fringes by converting the bitmap into a vector where each pixel is a square. Both the 'copy' and 'fill' methods of such an NSBezierPath are incredibly slow on my system (perhaps rasterising a path was cached at some point but now on ARM MacOS Sonoma it is not?), with 90% of the cpu time being spent inside -[NSBezierPath copyWithZone:].\n I've come up with a patch that changes fringes such that they're drawn using masked CGImages, which completely eliminates this slowdown when drawing fringes.

          "description": "I have been using projectile for years and it works nicely. However, recently I have noticed that more people recommend project.el because it is lighter and has the backing of the Emacs maintainers. Therefore, I want to give it a try.\n One confusion about project.el is how to specify a project if no version control exists.\n For example, suppose I have the following directory:\n \\---myproject | +---subproject1 | \\---.git | | Makefile | \\---subproject2 \\---.git | Makefile \n How to specify myproject as a project? Note that the myproject itself is under VC. \n By projectile, I just add a empty .projectile to myproject.\n From Emacs docs:\n  \nWhether a given directory is a root of some project is determined by the project-specific infrastructure, known as project back-end. Emacs currently supports two such back-ends: VC-aware (see Version Control), whereby a VCS repository is considered a project; and EDE (see Emacs Development Environment). This is expected to be extended in the future to support additional types of projects.\n  \nTherefore I have to write a back-end by myself? or use EDE which seems rarely used?\n Thanks.\n    submitted by    /u/chansey97  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello everyone!\n I am looking for a way to customize my C indentation style in Emacs to fit my school style guidelines.\n One of the guidelines I am trying to implement goes like this: \"Each variable declaration must be indented on the same column for its scope\", see my example below for clarity. \n Example:\n int main(void) { int a; int b; int c; } int main(void) { int a; char b; float c; } int main(void) { int a; char b; unsigned char c; } \n As you can see I have to indent the variables on the same column as their longest neighboring type name basically (C89 style).\n So far, I have dealt with it by remapping my TAB key to insert actual tabs with this elisp snippet: (local-set-key (kbd \"TAB\") 'tab-to-tab-stop) so I can indent everything manually. It does the job for me but I'm curious if there is a way to make full use of c-mode functionality to do that without having to write a super complicated elisp function that checks if the symbol at point is a C type and then indents it to the right column (with potential backtracking also). \n I think the short answer is probably no but I'm curious how you would deal with this if you were in my situation or/and if you personally had to do any \"hacks\" to your c-mode config to fit some project's guidelines. \n I quickly skimmed through manual, it probably has all the answers I need but nothing really stood out to me at first glance.\n    submitted by    /u/ismbks  \n [link]   [comments]",

The theme has been tested on WSL2 running on Windows Terminal, but if you encounter any issues, please let me know on GitHub.\n You can find theme on Github.\n Key Features:\n  \nCustomizable colors for comments, keywords, strings, numbers, etc.\n Support for various modes including org-mode, term, ivy, swiper, and more.\n Compatibility with Emacs 24 and later.\n Easily modifiable to suit personal preferences based on the provided code.\n  \nSince I'm not familiar with Emacs package managers yet, you can install and use the theme manually as long as autothemer is installed.\n Feel free to customize the theme according to your preferences. If you have any questions or encounter issues, please report them on GitHub :)\n P.S.\n I also tested the themes using the emacs -nw command. Both the dark and light themes work perfectly in the terminal. However, the dark-dimmed theme isn't fully compatible because I couldn't find a suitable color to replicate the greyish tone used in the GUI version.\n    submitted by    /u/ladroid  \n [link]   [comments]",

My first idea to learn more about this visual tool was to apply it to my Zettelkasten strategy.\nLet's take a closer look. A Wardley map allows us to visualize the **Evolution **of business components over time. It starts from the unstable beginnings to more stable, standardized components. These components fall into four stages: genesis, custom, product, and commodity.\nFirst: Genesis components are novel and new.

          "description": "Hi everyone,\n\nCan Zettels be printed onto paper without programming or maestro? I record notes digitally and want to keep them in an A5 spiral binder for reference. I use both The Archive and ia Writer to make Zettels.\n\n\nan I automatically update the format of all my Zettels so they're consistent? I've tried different templates and would like to remove the YAML formatting instead of a simplified design and one that doesn't hide tags and ID numbers when printed.\n\n\nMy current workflow involves using Zettels to take notes as I learn more about ADHD. Some of these Zettels contain strategies for coping with ADHD and include links to other Zettels that provide additional context and research.\nI want to carry these notes in an A5 binder so that they are available when needed. Many of the programming solutions are over my head, but there could be an easy way to update Zettels to the same format and print them. I know iA Writer has an export template function, but I'm no coder. \nThanks for any advice you can provide!",

So I'm wondering if instead of focusing on reducing the idea I should be adding more of the 'therefores' onto the notes?\nFor example, I have the following notes, which were titles only in the paper version but I have expanded on slightly in the digital.\nThe patient's art is only understood through therapy, (Naimberg 1953)\nArt seeks reaction, (artlust, 2024)\nArt can only truly be understood in relationship\nTo me, the third one is the 'therefore' of the first two. This is particulary obvious in the digital version where I expand slightly on 'art seeks reaction', because reaction can only happen in relationship. Initially I thought these are three seperate ideas, but now I'm not so sure.\nShould I combine the second two notes?",
