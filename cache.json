Which means I can't just free everything with free; I have to use the correct c function.\n My plan was to use the ReaderT monad to hold pointers of the allocated objects and create a typeclass for deletion which would trigger when things fall out of scope:\n class Collectable p where collect :: (MonadIO m) => p -> m () newtype CThing = CThing (Ptr ()) instance Collectable CThing where collect (CThing p) = ffi_c_delete_function_for_thing p \n I then created a newtype called 'Bin' for holding these objects:\n newtype Bin = Bin { unBin :: forall p . Collectable p => [p] } \n The reason for this is that it complained about impredicative polymorphism if I didn't create the newtype. It also didn't like:\n newtype Bin = Bin { unBin :: [forall p . Collectable p => p] } \n For the same reason.\n I then tried to call the delete functions on the environment:\n mapM collect $ unBin env \n But GHC complains again:\n Ambiguous type variable ‘a0’ arising from a use of ‘collect’ prevents the constraint ‘(Collectable a0)’ from being solved. \n Why can't it solve the constraint? I have defined a bin to contain only collectable objects!?\n As you have probably worked out by now, I have very little idea what I'm doing when it comes to higher rank polymorphism! send help!\n I have a backup plan (creating a type level list for the environment and using type families to construct the Collectable class), but it seems excessive\n    submitted by    /u/jamhob  \n [link]   [comments]",

So, the function I have so far\n findE n [] = []\n findE n (m:zs) = if (n == m) then findE n zs else m:(findE n zs)\n will work fine for when a == Integer but not for when the elements in the list are two-component tuples right? I was looking for how to improve my code so that it works for both cases. Also, it would be preferable if no modules need to be imported unless absolutely necessary to make this function universal for a lot of types.

          "description": "Hello folks! My apologies if the title sounds vague, I'm looking for advice or project ideas to get an introduction to frameworks such as Play, Akka and Spark. and to how they are being used in real world applications. I have some background in Rust, so getting familiar with Scala was pretty straightforward. I'm loving the language a lot and how natural it feels. \n However, I would like to start building some hobby projects by using the aforementioned frameworks if possible, but I'm not really sure where to start, or which of them is more beginner-intermediate-friendly. \n May I ask; does anyone mind suggesting a learning roadmap or drop some project suggestions/ideas? I'd deeply appreciate it. Thank you in advance. Stay safe and healthy everyone.\n    submitted by    /u/blureglades  \n [link]   [comments]",

He is my situation:\n I have a service that depends on the Firebase Admin SDK, specifically the auth module. So the live layer looks like a ZLayer[Has[FirebaseAuth], Throwable, Has[UserService]]. I'd like to mock the Firebase Auth SDK for testing, but I don't want to use the annoying emulator thing they have, it's too heavyweight and I don't want to deal with running another Docker container.\n UserService wraps around the auth SDK but has some custom logic. For example, UserService.getUserByEmail(email: String): Task[Option[UserId]] returns an effect that returns Some(UserId) (UserId being an internal domain object) if a user with this email exists, None if no user with the email exists, and fails if it was unable to complete either of these. In contrast, FirebaseAuth.getUserByEmailAsync(email: String): ApiFuture[String] returns a Java Future which fails with a specific error if a user with the email doesn't exist.\n For example, for mocking FirebaseAuth's getUserByEmail, I'd like to do something like (pseudo-code):\n  when (auth.getUserByEmailAsync(email1)) return Future.succeed(\"userid\") when (auth.getUserByEmailAsync(email2)) return Future.fail(NoSuchUserException) when (auth.getUserByEmailAsync(email3)) return Future.fail(BadEmailException) \n and use this somehow in my ZIO-test of my UserService.\n I can't find any examples of using Mockito in ZIO test. Does anyone have a code snippet they can share, or if this is better done through ZIO-test's own mocking system (I only saw mocking of ZIO services there so I am not sure if it can do more than that), can you explain how to do it?\n    submitted by    /u/crpleasethanks  \n [link]   [comments]",

I would like to incorporate org mode into my workflow but I'm not sure how. Here is what I'd like to do, perhaps someone can tell me the best way to accomplish that.\n I want to be able to create a TODO for each ticket that I am assigned. I want to be able to keep notes on that ticket as well as have a check list of things to do. To include such items as:\n  \ninvestigate bug\n create a pull request\n verify with test team\n  \nAdditionally I'd like to have custom states other than TODO and DONE. Something like TODO, IN PROGRESS, DONE, VERIFYING, and BLOCKED. Finally I would like to be able to assign tags to different tickets so I can track them. So if tickets 1,2,&3 all deal with the UI, then they get tagged with \"UI\". If tickets 4 & 5 are done on the backend with Java, I'd like to tag them as \"JAVA\" and \"BACKEND\". Then I'd like to be able to filter based on my tags.\n What is the best way of doing this in org mode? Should I be making a new document for each ticket? Just have one really big document with all my tickets? Is there something about this that I'm missing? I'd appreciate any clues you guys could toss my way.\n    submitted by    /u/burningEyeballs  \n [link]   [comments]",

To me this is pretty much the only thing holding me back from using orgmode for all pdf generation.\n Many thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/ourobo-ros  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I've recently found the Google Maps feature that allows you to save places and organize them into lists (e.g., restaurants you have been recommended), and then choose to show in the map or not the places in a given list. I find it really useful and would like to start using it more, but I don't think those lists are a good way to organize a large amount of places, and have some privacy issues with Google Maps. I would rather use org-mode to organize them, and then export them whenever I want to some other open maps application, or maybe keep them synchronized automatically. Do any of you know of something that implements this or something similar?\n    submitted by    /u/--ignacio  \n [link]   [comments]",

For both tables, I can calculate values in the last column one at a time by doing M-x org-table-recalculate or C-c *, but iteratively updating the table using M-x org-table-iterate or C-u C-u C-c * only works for the second table. For the first table, if I run org-table-iterate, I get the message \"Table was already stable.\" Is this a bug, or am I not understanding how named columns are supposed to work?\n I am running Org 9.4.6 and Emacs 27.2 on Windows 10\n Update: I posted this question on StackExchange and someone pointed out the following from the Org manual. So it turns out I didn't understand how named columns work 😄\n  \nThe documentation (C-h i g(org)Advanced Features) says: \n Important: Please note that for these special tables, recalculating the table with ‘C-u C-c *’ only affects rows that are marked ‘#’ or ‘*’, and fields that have a formula assigned to the field itself. The column formulas are not applied in rows with empty first field. \n  \n​\n    submitted by    /u/cottasteel  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I used to have 3 monitors on my desk, but when I started working from home, I just had the 1 monitor, and for various reasons, I still only have the 1 and it's unlikely to change.\n I used to have several small, single-purpose frames off on a second monitor, and one of them was for compilation output. It's been 18 months with just one monitor, and I still haven't found a solution that I like.\n Currently, I've got a child frame that pops up compilation output in the middle of my main frame. It hides itself if the compilation succeeds. I don't really like this because there's a lot of extra handling that I have to do, focus switching is weird (like if I'm in my web browser and click on the child frame, it's in focus, but the main frame doesn't come to the front. I have to click on a buffer in the parent frame), and it doesn't play nicely with which-key, etc.\n I've tried some solutions where the buffer switches to the compilation output and the buffer hides itself afterwards, but those are honestly kinda janky. \n So I'm on the verge of going back to a compilation frame--dedicated or not--but then the cues that compilation is still ongoing or has failed or succeeded might be hidden if I'm working on something else. (I used to try modifying the modeline in every active buffer, but that caused weird conflicts with doom modeline and other things that also wanted to play with the display.)\n There's a tradeoff with everything; I'm not looking for a perfect solution, I'm just curious what other people do.\n    submitted by    /u/vjgoh  \n [link]   [comments]",

Compared to GNU ELPA, there is no need for a copyright assignment (the only requirement is that packages do not endorse non-free software, but that is the case for most Emacs-related software to begin with).\n As can be seen here, I have already added contributed a number of popular packages and am waiting for a few packages to be fixed before they are added (I log the progress on these issues on my homepage).\n Going forward, I'd like to know what packages there would be an interest in adding to the archive? Note that a lot of popular packages are already on GNU ELPA, but I am specifically interested in the packages that are currently just available on MELPA or in no other package archive.\n (P.S. I am not interested in a flame-war on whether or not NonGNU ELPA makes sense or not. I just want to gather a list of popular packages.)\n    submitted by    /u/_pkal  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello all! I would be grateful for any help with a question about org-mode. I love using org files, and displaying them in Emacs is wonderful: I have my config set up to present subtrees indented, hide leading stars, etc.\n However, I would like to improve how my .org files look when accessed by other editors (or when printed out). Without the illusion of indentation that comes from editing .org files in Emacs, the documents are (at least in my opinion) extremely hard to decipher at-a-glance; there is no obvious visual relationship between headings and subheadings.\n Ideally, I would like for the content under subheadings to actually be indented in the text files, so that they would be easy to read/skim in other editors. My searching led to me to this page in the manual, which seems to explain that this can be done if the following settings are used:\n (setq org-adapt-indentation t org-hide-leading-stars t org-odd-levels-only t) \n However, even after adding these settings to my config, the behavior doesn't change: when I save a .org buffer, it is written to disk without hard indentation. Did I misunderstand something about how this works/should work (perhaps I missed something obvious)? Has anyone else had better luck making this happen?\n Many thanks in advance for any help.\n    submitted by    /u/NeatSea7  \n [link]   [comments]",

While doing it, I got carried away with the latest commit message, which related to adding my consult-dir and embark configurations into Doom.

This is helpful if you do not want to bind the command to a hotkey, but still want to pass the Universal Argument into it.\n I recently encountered a situation with the anki-editor package where I wanted to pass the Universal Argument into the anki-editor-push-notes function. I did not want to create a keyboard shortcut for this command because I will use it less than once a day. First I tried things like M-x anki-editor-push-notes(4) and M-x (anki-editor-push-notes '(4)) but neither of those worked. Then, following this guide, I created a wrapper function that calls (anki-editor-push-notes '(4)). This worked fine. I could call my wrapper function which would in turn call the function I really wanted to run with the Universal Argument passed in; however, I figured out a more succinct way. Pressing C-u M-x anki-editor-push-notes will pass the Universal Argument into the command. In my opinion this is better because I don't have to have that extra function in my init.el and I don't have to remember two slightly distinct commands.\n I figured if I didn't know about this and the author of this guide may not have known about this, then there may be other people on the subreddit who do not know about this.

If I want to pivot to an unrelated project/task, I open a new Emacs frame and edit the relevant files to that project there.\n  \nI'm curious to know if this is the standard in the Emacs community.

So I have a function for inserting the sections from parsed 'result-groups' (a group is all the DOM material for one result):\n (defun my/w3m-insert-duckduckgo-section (group) (let ((href (cdar (cdadar group))) (title (caddar group)) (body (cddr (nth 1 group)))) (magit-insert-section (result) (magit-insert-heading (insert (format \"%s\\n\" title))) (insert (format \"%s\\n\" \"this-is-the-body\"))))) \n I'm using the \"this-is-the-body\" string in place of an actual body at the moment, because I haven't got round to learning about parsing DOM text yet.\n I run this in a loop over all the groups, inserting each one. This runs inside a root section I insert first.\n This inserts the relevant text, but with no special properties (e.g. magit sections normally have certain faces) and no newlines. Everything is on one line, just running on to the next result.\n If I run something like this in a scratch buffer, the result is correct:\n (magit-insert-section (root) (magit-insert-section (result) (magit-insert-heading (format \"%s\\n\" \"Header text 1\")) (insert (format \"%s\\n\\n\" \"this-is-the-body\"))) (magit-insert-section (result) (magit-insert-heading (format \"%s\\n\" \"Header text 2\")) (insert (format \"%s\\n\" \"this-is-the-body\")))) \n Running eval-last-sexp after this in the scratch buffer works exactly as expected (standard magit section text properties, newlines are printed correctly). What's most stange is that if I use eval-expression to run the above form in a w3m buffer, it works correctly! Correct faces and properties etc.\n So, why do the newlines and properties not show up in the w3m buffer when I call the forms programatically vs interactively, and how can I fix this?\n TIA!\n    submitted by    /u/Jack-o-tall-tales  \n [link]   [comments]",

The interesting detail is that the author accomplished full text justification without tweaking the spacing between words. That's how you usually accomplish that effect in e.g. MS Word or other desktop publishing applications. The space between words is stretched.\n\nBut here, there's only ever 1 space between words.\nSo the author had to write everything to fit. Conversely, that means words and sentence structures had to be picked because of their length to properly fill the available space.\nMatt Gemmell points out that this is not a feat one is likely to accomplish for the lulz. It's serious effort. And that document sure as heck is long! Now that's some plain text dedication",

But I have never understood what it means to write notes in your own words. Most of the time I just copy a passage with minor changes or I translate an English passage as if I copied it.\nI thought about different strategies. I could first read a paragraph, then close the book, then rewrite some ideas from memory without looking at the text. Or I could simply read the text and not bother with the information within and just write my thoughts that could come into my mind. Or I could write the note as if I explained it to my mom.\nNote that I write my zettel notes in Romanian so when I read a text in English I translate it in Romanian. Not that it helps.\nAm I missing something? Can you tell me how can I write a zettel note without copying from the text or write it in my own words?",

Also, I write in a notebook first, then transcribe the writing into my computer to avoid editing while writing.\nHowever, when there are gaps, I'm not too keen on the idea of referring to resources until I can fill in the gaps. It means that I have to switch from writing to reading. Reading is low effort to me while writing is demanding. I'm most energetic in the morning. Thus, I'd rather use my mornings to write than to read if I have anything to write about.\nBut, if I split the tasks, I need to do something about what I've written so I can address the gaps and re-use the text. I've tried multiple approaches to deal with this to no avail.\nSo I ask: What is your approach to handle gaps in your understanding when processing reading notes?",

I feel like I'll learn the principles better if I can immediately start implementing the practices, and that means I need to choose what software I'm going to use (definitely not a card-and-box system - my handwriting isn't up to the task).\nMy existing workflow involves 1) highlighting and commenting on scholarly papers and ebooks in Mendeley; 2) highlighting and scribbling in the margin of hard copy books; 3) saving popular press articles to Evernote from Chrome. Then I write in Word. As you can see, something to process and organize notes and move them smoothly to the writing process is greatly needed.\nSince I already have several programs in this process, my top consideration for Zettelkasten software is that it be intuitive and work out-of-the-box without me having to hack any fixes.\nI have seen that some people use Evernote for Zettelkasten and I wonder if that's the way to go, to avoid proliferating software. It would be nice if I could click from my note on an article to easily see the article itself. However, looking at the earlier thread on Evernote, it seemed to get a bit technical with people figuring out plug-ins and fixes - I wonder if there's software I will find more simple and intuitive for Zettlekasten.\nThanks very much in advance for your help!",

          "description": "On the zettelkasten subreddit I came across a post linking to an article on the method (shared by the author of the article). In it he was making some bold proclamations, so I thought I'd ask what this community thought?\nThe core argument seems to be\n\n  \nToday, however, I shall provide one fundamental component of Luhmann's system. This fundamental component is missing from an estimated 96% of digital zettelkastens.\nLuhmann outlines this fundamental component in the very beginning of his paper on how his zettelkasten works.\n\n    \nInformation is an intra-systematic event. It results when one compares one message or entry with regard to other possibilities. Information, accordingly, originates only in systems which possess a comparative schema—even if this amounts only to: \"this or something else.\"\n\n  \n  \nYou see, built into every single note in Luhmann's system is one requirement: he must decide where the note belongs. It forces associations, and associations stand as the fundamental building block of human memory. One must decide if the note is associated with this or something else. It is a comparative schema built into the very root of Luhmann's antinet zettelkasten, which surfaces the magic of his system.\nUnfortunately, this fundamental component is watered down to near extinction in the world of digital zettelkastens.\n\n\n(Source: https://daily.scottscheper.com/num/243/)\nThe idea of \"must decide where the note belongs\", while true, misses the point of multiple context within the zettelkasten, as Luhmann was trying to come up with an alternative to filing notes using folders. Or is he just rehashing the classic Folgzettel Debate?\nEdited by @ctietze: Added source link for attribution",

          "description": "Hello everyone,\nI usually take a ton of notes from narrative non-fiction books I read: story ideas, research etc... Those should be considered \"literature notes\" in the context of zettelkasten. I find it confusing having these notes in a single file, so I split them by topic or anecdote. But I don't like to have my computer crammed with tons of files. When I read a new book on the same topic, rather than creating new notes and linking them, I tend to group the notes I already have with new notes who adds info to the same topic or details to the same anecdote. Still, I keep a reference to the original source (in the form of citation).\nTo better explain what I do:\nI read a book about a writer and I take a note on an episode of his life (which we'll call NOTE 1).\nAnother episode of his life goes to a different note (NOTE 2) in the same folder.\nI read another book and I find some detail on the same episode as NOTE 1. I don't create a new note but I add it to NOTE 1 and eventually add a citation for the new source.\nI read a book about a chemist and I take a note about one of his discoveries in the specific folder of that book/project. It isn't directly related to the episode of NOTE 1, but I think linking them can bring to a new perspective. I create NOTE 3 and link NOTE 1 and NOTE 3.\nIs that a good practice, or is it better to have a single file for the notes coming from a book, then different super short notes for concepts I want to keep from each book?",
