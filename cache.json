Heavily influenced by GNURadio, this project allows easy modulation/synthesis of data on the command line and it makes use of the Pipes library, keeping the runtime memory footprint as low as possible.\n I'm looking to extend this by adding:\n  \nMore modulation types\n Demodulation\n A set of components that can be composed together at runtime.\n  \nThat last point is an interesting one. I'm aware that Pipes speed mainly comes from fusion optimisation. I was thinking that it would be nice to have something similar to gcc's libgccjit, allowing JIT optimisation of a composed pipeline, increasing performance. Another nice side-effect of this approach is that by using the type system, you could have runtime typechecking of the pipeline, preventing uncomposable components to be connected. I couldn't find anything in GHC that facilities this unfortunately.\n Feedback appreciated!\n    submitted by    /u/hexagonal-sun  \n [link]   [comments]",

Still confused, I bounced to Wikipedia[2]. At this point I think I understand what they are, and how they differ.\n Suppose A is a type in some collection of types U, and B is a type family from A to U. That is, an input to B is some member of the type A, and an output from B is an entire type from U. Then:\n (1) Sigma [x:A] B(x) is the collection of pairs (x,y) for x:A and y:B(x).\n (2) Pi [x:A] B(x) is the collection of function-like things mapping every input x:A to some y:B(x).\n (3) Therefore, every element of a pi type can be seen as a cross section of the corresponding sigma type.\n If (3) is correct, then the title of this post is wrong -- the title suggests that the pi type itself, rather than each of its members, is a cross section of the corresponding sigma type.\n Have I understood?\n [1] https://haskellweekly.news/episode/51.html\n [2] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependent_type\n    submitted by    /u/JeffreyBenjaminBrown  \n [link]   [comments]",

The solution presented in this paper essentially makes this the canonical method of pattern matching, ie. pattern matching is reduced to dictionary dispatch. The connections to OO vtables is obvious I hope.\n  \nI decided to give it a try and implement a simple interpreter that doesn't have an Expression Problem (which means that both types and operations can be added without modifying existing code).\n This is a simple implementation I started with…",

Perhaps, this means that whenever you encounter a piece in your list, you hold onto it and ignore future pieces of that type, or you possibly drop the old piece in favor of the new piece of the same type, or perform some kind of combining function on the pieces. Whenever you have all the pieces needed to construct a MyProduct, you do so and stop pulling off the list.\n Of course, you also have to take into account the possibility that the list terminates before we receive all the required pieces, so we wrap the return type in Maybe:\n  constructMyProduct :: [SomePiece] -> Maybe MyProduct constructMyProduct = undefined \n What are some good solutions to this problem?

The more I learn, the more I am aghast at how messy the OOP paradigm can be. Haskell has types and typeclasses, and that's it! No need for interfaces, sub/super classes, constructors, scoped variables, none of that stuff.\n I love Haskell!\n    submitted by    /u/unreas0nable  \n [link]   [comments]",

Let's say for example we want to model the standard astronomical measurement for a star in the sky. It's made up of two parts, i.e., a right ascension α and a declination δ. How could I create a Haskell type for a star location out of these two? How would it be preferable to anything C++ might do, object or structure-wise? And how could I build in the allowable angle ranges of 0 ≤ α ≤ 360 ◦ and −90 ◦ ≤ δ ≤ 90 ◦ respectively. In SQL I can restrict a field to certain allowed values, ranges. How to do this in Haskell? So my audience is a math class that has heard of C++ but not Haskell and is thinking of a language for numerical analysis of, say, Calculus.\n    submitted by    /u/teilchen010  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have a simple data structre like this: \n data Document = Document { title :: String, content :: [String], wordCount :: Int } \n I want to have besides the default constructor where I have to provide a title and the content another one where I just have to provide the title and the content or just the title. And I also want to have a constructor function that creates out of a completely different data structure a Document. \n I find it pretty nasty to name all these constructor functions differently. Especially since I encountered this problem with a lot of different data structures. So I decided to use ad-hoc polymorphism provided by a generic type-class: \n class Factory a b where create :: a -> b \n Which I use like this: \n instance Factory String ([String] -> Document) where create title words = Document { title = title, words = words, wordCount = 0 } instance Factory String Document where create title = Document { title = title, words = [], wordCount = 0 } instance Factory RawDocument Document where create RawDocument{..} = create title (splitOn \" \" content) \n Now I can use simply the create function everywhere with the defined input types. And it scales nicely with all my data structures. \n Do you see any problems with this approach? I'm really not sure if I'm missing something. \n I'm just facing one problem:\n - Either I define the factories in the same module as the data structure, but then I need to live with the name shadowing warnings for values like title and words (I would hate to name them differently since they describe the same thing)\n - Or I have a separate Factory-Module but then I have to live with the orphan instance warnings.

I'm trying to insert links from my pandoc-compiled lhs pages to the raw lhs.

Here's what I ended up with, which is working:\n -- | Create a field that is the URL to the given version of the current item -- or non-existent (suitable for use in @$if(...)$@) if there is no such -- version. versionedUrlField :: String -- ^ version -> String -- ^ key -> Context a versionedUrlField version key = field key $ \\i -> let empty' = fail $ \"Cannot find routed \\\"\" ++ version ++ \"\\\" version for item \" ++ show (itemIdentifier i) lhsFilePathCompiler = (getUnderlying >>= (load . setVersion (Just version) :: Identifier -> Compiler (Item String)) >>= getRoute . itemIdentifier) in maybe empty' toUrl <$> lhsFilePathCompiler \n The strange part of this is the explicit type given to load . setVersion (Just version). I'd like this code to work regardless of how the resource I'm loading was compiled, but ghci does not seem to be able to give me the appropriate type make this polymorphic, and I'm not sure what it is, either, if it's even feasible.\n Alternatively, I'm very open to \"here's a much better way to accomplish the same than your versionedUrlField function\" :)\n (If anyone wants to use this as is, feel free. However, if you're using a copyFileCompiler or the like for your versioned file, you will either want to change the explicit type above or replace just copyFileCompiler with copyFileCompiler >>= getResourceString, both of which feel gross.)\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/steve_wolfman  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I'm looking into sequences. I start with the typically obtuse Wikipedia page on sequences here, then I try to imagine how all this might look in Haskell. I want to stay away from series for the time being, i.e., keep them separate.\n Here's one Haskell sequence (with a bit of example here), and here's another. These seem to be completely different. I'm looking at Tom Apostol's Calculus and his short bit on sequences, also SICP, and both have examples of limits of sequences, i.e., long sequences. This seems to be about streams, so I'm guessing the second Data.Containers.Sequence is more germane?\n Somewhere I found this:\n A geometric sequence (or progression) is a sequence of elements from an ordered,numeric type (i.e., a member of both classes Ord and Num) such that consecutive elements have a fixed ratio.\n geometric :: (Ord a, Num a) => a -> a -> a -> [a] geometric r m n | m > n = [] | otherwise = m : geometric r (m*r) n \n So this isn't trying to be fancy at all, it's just using lists. But then this talks about Cauchy sequences\n data Real = Cauchy { modulus :: Nat -> Nat , sequence :: Nat -> Rational } \n So this isn't list-land anymore, although I don't know what it is for or how to use it. If anyone has any wisdom or tips or insights, I'd appreciate. In general, I find the world of Haskell and numerical analysis very fragmented, hit-and-miss, like a scavenger hunt. It seems Haskell can bring a lot to the numerical analysis table, though.\n    submitted by    /u/teilchen010  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Greetings.\n In Haskell, a top-level function and a lambda function which do the same thing have the same type. How can this be, when the lambda might capture some aspects of its environment? I'd imagine a regular function is just a pointer, like in other languages, but that can't be all it is. Do lambdas dynamically allocate space for their captures, and store a pointer with the function objects, so that every function is really a function pointer plus a capture pointer, which would be null in the case of non-capturing functions? Am I wrong to even think of Haskell objects in terms of physical memory?\n    submitted by    /u/i_lack_chromosomes  \n [link]   [comments]",

ZIO is still quite new and changing fast. Someone posted a video of a bug they found in Cats Effect 3 related to memory that I can't find right now but that is to say it's possible for there to be bugs in the runtime engine itself. It would be a legitimate question for my team to ask: what happens if there is a bug in the core of the runtime that we can't architect around? Is there a risk that we have to refactor a whole codebase in the future out of ZIO?\n Basically, how do I assure my team that it's stable enough to use in production? \n I know this question would come up (or should) with every dependency added to the codebase, but this is a big one. If you're using a third party JSON parsing library (e.g.) and encounter a serious bug, you have more options s.a. using a different library, writing a small library that only addresses your use case (or even just the use case where the dependency has the bug), architecting around it so the bug is not on the execution path anymore, or forking the library and fixing it if you can. With a library like ZIO where the whole app runs on top of it, you may have no choice but refactor the whole thing.\n    submitted by    /u/crpleasethanks  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I'm a college student going for CS degree. We were taught the basics of programming/OOP with Java, and therefore most of our generalized CS classes had Java support.\n I've always hated scripting languages, loose typing, and manual memory allocation so it was hard to pick another language to try to learn (and C# is just close enough to understand but just different enough to drive me nuts). I love what I've learned of Scala so far, and want to make sure I don't get anything wrong.\n I've been successful in following a number of tutorials in Java and converting their code to Scala because I don't save many projects of my own. Everything runs and is great but I feel like I'm probably making some noob mistakes.\n What are some tips for a new Java-to-Scala dev student who very strongly leans towards OOP and away from functional programing?\n    submitted by    /u/VarianWrynn2018  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'd much prefer searching through org nodes to find the file I need (typically PDFs or saved HTML files, in my case).\n However, I've found the default ID generation a bit strange. I realize I can use relative directories, but it seems I would need a directory per file if I wanted only one file attached to a node. I'm just a bit hesitant to not use relative directories and continue to name my files in human-readable format since it makes me a bit more \"locked-in\" (in a sense) to org-attach, otherwise.\n So...I guess I'm just looking for ideas and inspiration.

Currently I do all my task, project management and timelog planning through Toggl and Evernote. I use Evernote as a filing cabinet, storing important documents like contracts, tax documents etc, for quick retrieval. However I would like to get away from Evernote, due to its lack of privacy and encryption features. \n Ideally, I would like to have everything in org-mode, that is: \n  \nNotes (I'm quite ok with plain text notes)\n Files (like a plain text note such as tax agreement, which then links to the actual document)\n Time tracking for tasks and calendar apointments\n Maybe an Agile Results (a productivity system) workflow\n How can I get my tasks in org-mode etc. on my phone on iOS?\n  \nIs this possible to achieve in org-mode and if so, could you suggest a possible workflow? I have also looked at Joplin as a possible candidate, but it's time tracking and todo features are insufficient for me. \n Thanks, in advance \n Best regards, \n ​\n David\n    submitted by    /u/dsbahr  \n [link]   [comments]",

Notably, if I do:\n (use-package evil-org :after org ... ;;config for evil-org ) (use-package evil-org-agenda :after (org evil-org) ... ;;config for evil-org-agenda ) (use-package org-agenda :after (org evil-org evil-org-agenda) ... ;;config for org-agenda ) \n ... and then call org-agenda, the order of configuration is 1. org-agenda, 2. evil-org-agenda, 3. evil-org - the opposite order of what I'd expect.\n Here's a pastebin of my config with the use-package macros expanded and cleaned up a bit, so if someone would be willing to help me understand the life cycle, I'd really appreciate it. I think I understand the beginning:\n  \nI call org-agenda using C-c a\n org-agenda requires org and triggers org's loading\n The eval-after-load 'org block in evil-org's block is triggered and does its setup of hooks. At this point, evil-org isn't truly loaded yet, since its config block inside an eval-after-load 'evil-org doesn't run.\n  \nHowever, after this point I'm lost. We've just established that evil-org isn't loaded, but the next thing to run is the stuff inside org-agenda's config block, which requires (org evil-org evil-org-agenda) to be loaded - which implies we skipped both the eval-after-load 'evil-org mentioned above as well as evil-org-agenda's config block, which only required (org evil-org).\n The documentation for eval-after-load specifies that if FILE is loaded, the body is evaluated immediately afterwards. How then is it possible for org, evil-org, and evil-org-agenda to go from unloaded to loaded without triggering the stuff inside (use-package 'evil-org ...) or (use-package 'evil-org-agenda ...) first?\n    submitted by    /u/summetria  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi. Couple days ago I saw a video on youtube about EXWM, that blew my mind. So I thought to switch from dwm to EXWM, but I never used emacs, I'm learning it now, that's quite easy. The thing that most impressed me besides emacs in itself was the Lisp language, such a cool language!\n I switched from Windows to Linux because it is more flexible and it lets you customize a lot of things. I wish to have a Dynamic OS, but with Tilling Window Manager like dwm It is a tough task to achieve, so maybe EXWM + Emacs can do what I want.\n But before I dive into the emacs world I have a few questions:\n Can I have a statusbar integrated with modeline likes this:\n https://preview.redd.it/s6wkhsea65k71.png?width=1047&format=png&auto=webp&s=7d4846e51146409e7d25a78866773027c67e44e2\n Can I have custom mini-buffers that does stuff like show a playlist of music/videos and support custom formatting style and images?\n Can I have an image frame in different workspaces as background and still be able to write text? Its similar to the concept of setting a wallpaper with feh or hsetroot and make emacs transparent, but on emacs buffers instead on the X11 thing. There are some DEs that allow you to have different wallpapers per workspace.\n I know I can intercept a function call and adds other funcionality, like change the wallpaper with hsetroot. But doing like that I would see my wallpapers behind the emacs, I want to see like if I had spawned sxiv in a buffer with EXWM.\n Since emacs is a GUI application, I believe all of this is possible. I don't care If I will have to write 1000 lines of e-lisp or more, if this is possible, I will do my best to accomplish it.\n    submitted by    /u/Inphynithus  \n [link]   [comments]",

I could find the exact pattern that's doing the match and remove it—it's likely that I don't need it for anything I'm doing anyway—but honestly, there are zero times when I want that buffer parsed for errors.

I used to use thunderbird, and with the lightning extension I got a very clear, graphical interface for planning out my week (synced using a google calendar) and adjusting the time-blocks dynamically during the week.\n I recently moved to mu4e and in terms of emails, it is absolutely and utterly fantastic. However, I have not been able to find a good planning replacement. I know and use org-gcal which is very good in terms of syncing with google calendar. However, I really miss the ease with which I could view my time-blocks. org-gcal has a weekly view mode, but it does not have any way of showing 'blocks' of time - every event is just a single line (which often doesn't fit in the column).\n I know the emacs universe is too vast for any one person to know and try all the packages. So, I would like to ask for tips and suggestions from people on here. If you time-block using emacs and would like to share how you go about doing it, I'd be very interested to know.\n Cheers\n    submitted by    /u/MrEyff  \n [link]   [comments]",

This tends to annoy me a bit on the rare occasion that I have to use emacs inside a terminal since many of the shortcuts I am habituated to aren't available.\n My guess is that xterm sends extra escape codes that other terminals that emacs is able to detect and support, but I would love to know if someone knows for sure.

          "description": "TLDR: What's the easiest way of tracking the value of an org statistics cookie through a git commit tree?\n Background\n I use org-mode and git to track my reading habits. I have a document tree with a heading for each book, and three possible todo states: TBR, Read and DNF. The document is thus structured as follows:\n * Books [X/Y] ** TBR Title 1 ** Read Title 2 ** DNF Title 3 \n The value of X is the count of how many titles below it are marked Read, while the value of Y is the count of how many values are marked either Read or TBR. DNFs don't enter into the statistics at all.\n With this document, I sometimes add new books to be read, and when I've read a book, I switch the todo status from TBR to Read. If I try the book and don't want to finish for one reason or another, I mark it DNF.\n The document is version controlled, so I can go back and see how the list has changed with time. I thought it might be fun to try and plot how the size of the list of books has changed with time, but I don't know how to automatically extract the statistics cookie for each commit.\n Any suggestions?\n    submitted by    /u/CutOnBumInBandHere9  \n [link]   [comments]",

Usually I jot down things in bullet points as I read with a text. But this has been causing some issues. The actual writing takes a bit, and can be enough to get me out of the flow of reading. This usually leads to frustration as I try to write as fast as I am thinking, resulting in a barely legible scrawl. Either that or I take very few notes as I try to stay engaged with the reading material So, I wonder, am I taking notes too often? Should I wait until I am done with a certain section before jotting down ideas? The mental block I have there is that I will forget what I wanted to write down by the time I get to a stopping point.\nMaybe it is not the frequency of notes, but the medium. Or maybe both. I have tried using a computer, and that does help with speed somewhat. However, that works best with digital texts, and I mostly read printed ones. Another approach I have thought of is using index cards. That does make processing later a bit easier, and you can group notes freely to see relations, but it can also get messy. What are your thoughts on using a computer for notes? Index cards?\nMy goal is to have a system where I can read fluidly while writing down things I would like to process later.

Please let me know what you think.\nIf you have a Zettelkasten, you need to constantly create Zettels so it grows to give you richer connections. A day in a Zettler usually looks like this:\nCreate Zettels and make connections.\nRead sources.\nProofread Zettels.\nHowever, you need to manage the overall process so working with a Zettelkasten doesn't become all you do everyday. E.g.: In the worst case scenario, you'd spend the entire morning, afternoon, and evening creating Zettels, reading, and proofreading respectively. That gives you no time for anything else!\nThe part of the process to manage is reading time because everything else depends on it. E.g.: If you don't read, you can't create Zettels, and without Zettels, there's nothing to proofread.\nI think that we can manage reading time in the same way that we adapt the routine of short knowledge cycles:\nStart with 1 hour of reading.\nRead, create Zettels, and proofread. Keep track of the time spent on each activity.\nReflect on the overall process.\nBased on your reflection, change the time alloted for reading.\nRepeat steps 2 through 4 until you reach a point where you are satisfied with the work you do for your Zettelkasten, and don't lose time for other things in your day.",

There is a difference, a sliding scale, a spectrum in ZK work focused on literature, just as there is a spectrum of other types of \"X-driven ZK work.\" Moving my skills \"up\" the scales is a goal, and it is always possible to move on the scale. I have to be vigilant that I don't backslide. Thinking and writing about the processes used in ZK work help clarify meaning. Some processes are counterproductive to our goals and there is a good chance we are blind to this - from @Will comment here\n\n\nHow would you rank the different tasks in terms of their utility to your zettelkasten? Here is my current ranking from top (highest utility) to bottom\nCreating Combinations of Ideas\nCreating Variations of Ideas\nCreating Nonobvious Connections (e.g. conceptual connections)\nReformulating Ideas from Literature\nAdding Notes to a Structure Note\nCreating Connections based on Keywords (Obvious Connections)\nCopying and Pasting Ideas from Literature\nUnsure: \n* Creating Metacognitive Knowledge not for yourself, but for the zettelkasten\n* Clarifying Notes\n* Organizing Old Notes",
