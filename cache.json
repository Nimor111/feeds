The room will open at 18:00.\n We plan to have 1-2 short talks starting at 19:00 (topics to be announced). Depending on interest there might also be a short Show & Tell session giving people the opportunity to show off or talk about something they work(ed) on for 5-10 Minutes each.\n There will be time to discuss the presentations with some snacks and non-alcoholic drinks being provided afterwards with an option to acquire beer for a reasonable price.\n The meetup is open ended but we might have to relocate to a nearby bar as a group if it goes very late.. There is no entrance fee or mandatory registration, but to help with planning we ask you to let us know in advance if you plan to attend here https://forms.gle/Paiw6D4QJzTKzcmM6 or per email at haskellvienna.meetup@gmail.com. \n We especially encourage you to reach out if you would like to participate in the show&tell or to give a full talk so that we can ensure there is enough time for you to present your topic.\n We hope to welcome everyone soon, your organizers: Andreas(Andreas PK), Benny, Chris, fendor, VeryMilkyJoe, Samuel\n    submitted by    /u/Fendor_  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi every, I am reading the book \"Thinking with types\" and I get confused about implicitly universally quantified. Sorry if this question is silly because English is not my first language.\n In the book, the author says that\n broken :: (a -> b) -> a -> b broken f a = apply where apply :: b apply = f a \n  \nThis code fails to compile because type variables have no notion of scope. The Haskell Report provides us with no means of referencing type variables outside of the contexts in which they’re declared.\n  \nQuestion: Do type variables have no scope or they are scoped within \"the contexts in which they’re declared\" (type signatures if I am not mistaken).\n My understanding is that type variables in type signature are automatically universally quantified, so\n broken :: (a -> b) -> a -> b \n is equivalent to\n broken :: forall a b. (a -> b) -> a -> b \n forall a b. introduces a type scope. However, without the ScopedTypeVariables extension, the scope of a and b is the type signature where they are declared, but not the whole definition of broken.\n This quantification is to ensure that a and b in the type signature are consistent, that is, both occurrences of a refer to the same a, and both occurrences of b refer to the same b.\n Question: Is my understanding correct?\n Thanks.\n    submitted by    /u/Reclusive--Spikewing  \n [link]   [comments]",

Yampa prides itself in being a long-standing community project. It has now been around for 20 years!!! See https://github.com/ivanperez-keera/yampa#features for details on Yampa's features.\n This new release introduces a new type of integral that implements the trapezoid integration rule. Simulations executed at low sampling rates can behave in ways that violate expected physical laws (e.g., systems may gain energy over time due to inaccuracies in the calculation of positions and velocities). This new integral behaves in a more stable way in such cases. Thanks to Github users idontgetoutmuch , miguel-negrao and thalerjonatha…",

I have two related problems, I'm at my wits-end and I was hoping for some advice.\n The problem basically boils down to injecting context into an Aeson FromJSON parser. If I wish to read a file of JSON objects that refer to each other, I would like to be able to replace an identifier reference with the actual object when it is read. For example\n  data Region = Region { regionID :: Text , regionName :: Text , regionType :: RegionType , regionParent :: Maybe Region , regionLocale :: Maybe Locale } \n with data like\n  [ { \"id\": \"ES\", \"name\": \"Spain\", \"type\": \"Country\", \"locale\": \"es\" }, { \"id\": \"ES-CL\", \"name\": \"Castille and León\", \"type\": \"Subnational\", \"parent\": \"ES\" } { \"id\": \"ES-GA\", \"name\": \"Galicia\", \"type\": \"Subnational\", \"parent\": \"ES\", \"locale\": \"ga\" } ] \n I have an elaborate system of placeholders and normalisation at the moment to sort out the parent references to \"ES\" and I was wondering if there was something, a la Jackson, that would handle references naturally.\n I have lots and lots of other examples of this sort of need to reference other items.\n The other aspect of this in injecting this information, hopefully using the ReaderT pattern, into another parser that will use this data. As an example,\n  data Location = Location { locationID :: Text , locationName :: Text, , locationRegion :: Region } \n and \n  [ { \"id\": \"S\", \"name\": \"Santiago de Compostella\", \"region\": \"ES-GA\" } ] \n where the Galicia data, with all its useful information such as locales and holidays, replaces the \"ES-GA\" reference.\n I have wasted waaay to much time trying to figure out how to achive this and would appreciate any useful* advice.\n * With the caveat that I do not regard \"embed it into code\" as \"useful\".

Meanwhile, the HVM searcher, using SUP Nodes, takes just 1.7m interactions, or about 0.0085s. More interestingly, it takes just 0.03 interactions per guess. This sounds like a huge speedup, so, it is very likely I'm doing something dumb. As such, I'd like to ask for validation.\n I've published the Haskell code (and the full story, for these interested) below. My question is: Am I missing something? Is there some obvious way to optimize this Haskell search without changing the algorithm? Of course, the algorithm is still exponential and not necessarily useful, but I'm specifically interested in determining whether the HVM version is actually faster than what can be done in Haskell.\n Gist: https://gist.github.com/VictorTaelin/7fe49a99ebca42e5721aa1a3bb32e278\n    submitted by    /u/SrPeixinho  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi, I'm reading <Get Programming with Haskell> book on Manning MEAP website and have difficulties in understanding its chapter 21, titled \"Hello World! - introducing IO types\". In my opinion, it seems to give wrong information. Below is an example:\n \"If main isn't a function, it should follow that neither is putStrLn. ... As you can see, the return type of putStrLn is IO(). Like main, putStrLn is an IO action because it violates our rule that function must return values.\"\n The author seemed to think \"IO ()\" isn't a value, which I don't agree with. So I googled and found the following on Haskell wiki https://wiki.haskell.org/Introduction_to_Haskell_IO/Actions:\n \"PutStrLn takes an argument, but it is not an action. It is a function that takes one argument (a string) and returns an action of type IO (). So putStrLn is not an action, but putStrLn \"hello\" is.\"\n So I think the author is completely wrong on that, isn't it?

I wanted to learn to compose a bit, and the traditional method is counterpoint. So I did what any barely musically literate nerd would do: I started to write a program to verify that a counterpoint composition follows the rules when played against a given melody. Frankly it was an uphill battle. But finally, this weekend, I got it working.\n https://github.com/ludflu/counterpointer-report\n The main thing that stymied my earlier efforts was that I didn't understand the nature of musical intervals in a formal way. Every explanation I learned described it as a mathematically naive music student might require, which makes sense if I were trying to play the oboe or whatnot. Or, things would be explained in DSP terms, explaining how overtones work, etc. And that also makes sense, but....\n But what I really needed, was for someone to tell me that musical intervals are calculated using integers mod 12. Which actually makes a ton of sense when you think about how human's perceive relative pitch. Did you know that humans are the only animals we know of that perceive relative pitch? I'm pretty sure I learned that from David Huron's excellent book.\n Eventually I thought to ask someone over in /r/musictheory and things mostly worked out from there since I could use the Haskell modular-arithmetic library for the intervals, and Euterpea for representing notes and playing them via MIDI.\n Finally I had to hack around some broken stuff because Euterpea, though its a marvelous library, is not actively maintained and so needed some work to get it to run with modern Cabal. AND PortMIDI-haskell doesn't agree with Clang on OSX. But I was able to patch all those things locally to get everything running, and I submitted PRs to try and fix them up for everyone else.\n    submitted by    /u/ludflu  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello,\n I need to find the nth prime number. This is what I have so far:\n module Prime (nth) where nth :: Int -> Maybe Integer nth n | n < 1 = Nothing | otherwise = Just ([x | x <- [2..n], isPrime x] !! (n-1)) isPrime :: Int -> Bool isPrime 2 = True isPrime n | n < 2 = False |otherwise = all (map (\\x -> n `mod` x /= 0)) [2..root] where root = (floor . sqrt . fromIntegral) n \n Some of the errors I get are (seems that both functions are wrong):\n Couldn't match expected type ‘Integer’ with actual type ‘Int’ • In the expression: x In the first argument of ‘(!!)’, namely ‘[x | x <- [2 .. n], isPrime x]’ In the first argument of ‘Just’, namely ‘([x | x <- [2 .. n], isPrime x] !! (n - 1))’Couldn't match expected type Couldn't match type ‘[Bool]’ with ‘Bool’ Expected: [Int] -> Bool Actual: [Int] -> [Bool] • In the first argument of ‘all’, namely ‘(map (\\ x -> n `mod` x /= 0))’Couldn't match type ‘[Bool]’ with ‘Bool’ Expected: [Int] -> Bool Actual: [Int] -> [Bool] • In the first argument of ‘all’, namely ‘(map (\\ x -> n `mod` x /= 0))’ \n The second error is not really clear for me, I thought that all returns Bool (a -> Bool) -> [a] -> Bool), why would it be [Bool]? Also, any hint for the first function?

          "description": "So I've been diving into the world of algebraic effects systems as an alternative to mtl-style classes for granular effect tracking. One thing I haven't quite figured out yet is how to handle errors in the middle of a computation that uses a custom effect type. For example, let's say I have an effect for talking to the database:\n  data DB :: Effect where DBWrite :: Item -> DB m () DBRead :: Key -> DB m (Maybe Item) \n and types for errors and the database environment\n ``` data DBError = DeadLockError | ConnectionError\n data DBEnv = DBEnv Connection ```\n and let's say I have the interpreter:\n  runDBIO :: (IOE :> es, Error DBError :> es) => DBEnv -> Eff (DB : es) a -> Eff es a runDBIO env = interpret \\_ -> \\case ... do handling here ... \n Now the recommended way to instrument all of this is to wire up all of your effect handlers at the start of your program:\n  main = do env <- getDbEnv result <- runEff . runError @DBError . runDBIO env $ program case result of Left -> ... do something ... Right -> ... do something ... \n This all makes sense. But what if I want to handle the error at a deeper level in the program and not at the very top level? The Error DBError effect doesn't manifest in the type list until the runDBIO interpreter is applied. For example,\n  tryWriteDBOrSendEmailPage :: Item -> Eff [Email, DB] () tryWriteDBOrSendEmailPage item = do catchError (dbWrite item) $ \\_ e -> emailPage $ \"Something went wrong: \" ++ (show e) return () \n This doesn't work here because the type signature doesn't contain Error DBError, but the underlying implementation of DB uses it. If I add Error DBError to the effect list, wouldn't that be a totally separate effect from DB, so it wouldn't be able to throw and catch in the same context? Should I manually expose effects for TryDBWrite and TryDBRead that return an Either? Not exactly sure what to do here.\n    submitted by    /u/ryanworldorder  \n [link]   [comments]",

It's capabilities are way beyond what I experienced back when I was last writing Haskell and has made it so much easier to quickly look up documentation and get autocomplete without having to scroll through hackage documentation for all of the functions and types that I forget.\n However, my experience using it with neovim has been less than stellar. I seem to have nothing but issues with it, and I can't tell if it's a neovim problem or an HLS problem. I'm using the haskell-tools.nvim plugin with the standard nvim-cmp and lspconfig plugins. Most other language servers work reasonably well, but this one seems particularly finicky and I can't figure out why.\n I'm currently having an issue where if I type anything for about 4-6 seconds after opening the first haskell file in the editor (while the language server is starting) it causes HLS to completely hang and become unresponsive. I'm also having issues with nvim-cmp screaming at me about misplaced dollar signs in snippets (I'm assuming because the haskell suggestions contain things like $ and $!).\n I decided to temporarily install vscode to see if that would do it. Everything worked completely flawlessly out of the box, absolutely no issues. The problem is, I would really rather not use vscode if I don't absolutely have to.\n Has anyone been able to get a working config for haskell in neovim that plays nice? I'm thinking of maybe scrapping haskell-tools and configuring things directly to see if that helps, otherwise I've spent so much time fiddling with the editor that I may have to leave it and come back later when things improve.\n    submitted by    /u/lucid00000  \n [link]   [comments]",

To have a computational effect, there must be function application involved, so it uses terms like functorial context, applicative effect and monadic effect.

Here's is a pseudocode version of it:\n  class { function(\"/route\")(SourceParamsReads(Reads)) { println(\"a log here prints successfully\") Params => println(\"no logs here or beyond print successfully\") function(Params.session) { id => val source = Params.source val user = ( groupId = Params.groupId userId = Params.userId ) val future = ... future.map {...} } } \n There's more in the ellipses but hopefully this is enough information. the Params variable has no references anywhere else in the application, just before the arrow and inside it.\n    submitted by    /u/PalmRaccoon  \n [link]   [comments]",

It would have to be a project deployed to the cloud, scalable, reliable, performant (but not extremely performant - jvm performance is fine). It will have to be maintained for years to come - by you, your team and your successors.\n Whatever you choose, you will have to recruit a team or train your coworkers - let's assume that they are mostly java users, good old spring booters, but they are not against the idea of learning a new language and paradigm.\n Would you choose Scala for such a project if given a choice? Do you feel confident that you'd be able to sell this idea to your manager? Do you believe that with Scala it would be cheaper to maintain or more profitable than with other languages?

Pseudocode-ish:\n ``` type A <: T type B <: T\n trait Foo[t <: T]\n object Foo1 extends Foo[A]\n objet Foo2 extends Foo[B]\n def someFunc[t <: T](foo: Foo[t]): Unit = { somethingThatKnowsHowToTakeTypes[t].foobar }\n Seq( Foo1, Foo2 ).map(someFunc) ```\n This leads to type erasure concerns, even though to me it seems obvious that that Sequence is of a type where each object inside is a Foo of some concrete type that fits the constraints. I can get around it by introducing some wrapper case class that I can stick Foo1 and Foo2 into, which retains it's type as an explicit member. And then inside someFunc I have to manually use that type member explicitly. Feels clunky and it feels like something I'm tricking the compiler into doing. Not to mention at some point I did get it to compile, only to fail at runtime if I didn't create the correct implicit typetag in scope.\n Second example:\n Sequence of (Foo[t <: T], Bar[t <: T]), and Bar/Foo have methods that operate on or return t <: T. I store in a 2-tuple because inside a lambda I want to do something like Foo.read(...).map(Bar.transform) where Foo.read returns something typed by t and Bar.transform takes something subtyped by t. I assume since I pair them up in a 2-tuple, the Seq of these such objects could recognize that it's some paired object, but instead the compiler complains about expected vs supplied types.\n    submitted by    /u/kebabmybob  \n [link]   [comments]",

Ideally, I'd like to write something like this\n class Processor: data: HashMap[Axis, Data] def process(axis: Axis) = doStuff(data(axis)) \n Unfortunately, this code has different performance and correctness characteristics:\n  \nIt's possible for me to forget to initialize Data for some of the axes.

When I got my first interview for a international remote job I had about 1.5 years of Scala experience, but 4 years total experience. I went pretty far but didn't get it because lack of experience. After that, I've had up to a dozen of these kinds of interviews, for a remote international team, but I never managed to get a job. Now finally I have found a new job but it is not a great project and not what I want.\n I am not the most enthusiastic person when it comes always being up to date and reading blogs and stuff and also for the past years, I have not been a person who got assigned to the more complex stuff in my company. Otherwise I have a pretty good basis for algorithms and coding challenges (although I failed the last one which was live coding using lots of Scala generics).\n Now, it seems to me that when recruiting for a remote team, especially for a senior position, the stands for a Scala developer are pretty high and the projects are not simple (relatively, like more distributed stuff).\n Does anyone have more insights how this compares to other languages. A lot of people that I know which I wold think were at my level as a developer or even sub, got remote jobs or jobs away from my country, and I am feeling stuck. I keep wondering if it would have been easier to find this kind of remote job if i stayed with C# or moved to Java, and not due to lack of opportunities in the Scala world....\n    submitted by    /u/PierreGargoyle  \n [link]   [comments]",

The stack I've been working with was the typelevel with tagless final so 90% of our code was in the functional style. I got an offer from one of my previous employers for a Senior Java role and as usual they are using the Java Spring enterprise stack. \n I'm considering the switch because of the better work-life balance, increased pay and more remote friendly. But what's making me doubt is Java. I haven't used Java (or any OOP language) in an production setting before and mainly throughout my career only used functional languages. Has anyone done a similar shift? Like moving from purely functional scala to Java EE style? And if so how was the adjustment? \n I did a quick read through some Spring code bases and it just seems like most of the work is just using the spring annotations correctly, which I don't really like since it's seems like doing \"config\" instead of actual coding.\n So anyone with any experience on making a similar switch and how that went? \n    submitted by    /u/lordGwynx7  \n [link]   [comments]",

Most of what I've found were refactoring or lining tools, and a few paid tools/services that would give me somewhat useful metrics. \n I reckon I could cobble something together that I could use but it would be a significant time investment. So, I figured I could ask the Scala community for recommendations before I start doing it myself. Any suggestions?\n P.S. The list of metrics that I'm interested in isn't that strict, but generally, it should be at least one of these metric sets: Maintainability Index, Halstead metrics, QMOOD metrics, MOOD metrics, and a few others.\n P.P.S. \"MetricsTree\" would be an ideal tool if it weren't capable of handling only Java source code. I thought about compiling scala code and then decompiling class files into Java source code but that can skew the metrics too much. \n    submitted by    /u/Plane-Objective-8856  \n [link]   [comments]",

I use org-mode and evil-mode extensively for notes and generally want text to wrapped at say 80 lines (easier readability, better use of screen-real estate when you're using a tiling window manager or a terminal multiplexer). For those who do something similar, looking for some advice:\n  \nFor wrapping text, can someone share a binding to toggle using text width of 80 and/off? Also useful to visually select text and set that to wrap at text width of 80 if you don't want the all text wrapped in the file. For the latter, I often visually select the text and use a binding for fill-region-as-paragraph but this joins paragraphs separated by a line. \n \nThis:\n  \nThis is some notes blah blah blah\n \n  \nlooks better than this\n - This is some notes blah blah blah \n , right? I find myself needing to manually adjust for the former--how to have it be done automatically?\n  \nDo you have wrap at column 80 for everything? I feel like if you have text at several indents deep, those lines are too short because they still get wrapped at column 80. I'm wondering if perhaps wrapping at 80 characters starting from first non-space character to the last character on the line might be better, but I'm not sure of any editors that allow for this behavior by default and in this case it would be better to stick with consistent behavior vs. some custom solution that might not cover all edge cases.\n  \nMuch appreciated.\n    submitted by    /u/immortal192  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Per previous post about using Org and Agenda, I've gotten things setup pretty well so far. However I've run into a very weird issue that I cannot figure out what's going on. \n I have two machines that both have access to a home network drive. On that drive, I've got a folder called Notes and that's got notes.org and a bunch of Denote files. So far so good. \n On one machine (the laptop) I can launch Emacs and do org-agenda n and it'll pull up the day's schedule and current TODO list. On the desktop machine, if I do the same, it seems to just hang. There are no error messages, just silence. I've had to process kill Emacs a few times now to try different things.\n Any idea what org-agenda is doing that would cause it to hang?\n UPDATE: I went into .emacs.d and deleted everything pertaining to org-mode persistence, history, and things like that. That seems to have solved the issue for now. I guess between the two Emacs sessions, something got out of sync. Wish I knew what though, or how to avoid it in the future.\n    submitted by    /u/remillard  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Is there a way to ignore dollar-sign when using calc to grab a rectangle?\n The specific case is using emacs to edit ledger-cli entries, and I want to total the values in a split-transaction. Here's an example:\n 2001-01-04 * (797) City of Austin Assets:Checking:UFCU:Bjorg -$59.62 Expenses:Util/Austin:Electric $23.29 Expenses:Util/Austin:Water $4.23 Expenses:Util/Austin:Water $5.48 Expenses:Util/Austin:Solid Waste $17.91 Expenses:Util/Austin:Water $8.71 \n So if I want to total all the entries using rectangle command and copy into calc like: C-x * r and then execute calc-vector-sum (or \"u +\" inside calc), I can't select a rectangle with \"$\" in it. Otherwise, I get an error like:\n calc-do-grab-rectangle: $’s not allowed in this context\n I understand I could reformat the text so the \"$\" won't get selected, for example adding spaces between \"$\" and the amount like this:\n 2001-01-04 * (797) City of Austin Assets:Checking:UFCU:Bjorg -$59.62 Expenses:Util/Austin:Electric $23.29 Expenses:Util/Austin:Water $ 4.23 Expenses:Util/Austin:Water $ 5.48 Expenses:Util/Austin:Solid Waste $17.91 Expenses:Util/Austin:Water $ 8.71 \n I can then make sure I select the rectangle without the \"$\" before using C-x * :\n It'd be nice if I can tell emacs calc to ignore \"$\", but I'm not that conversant with elisp. As far as I can tell, the \"not allowed in this context\" error is throwing an exception in calc-aent.el when it's checking something with a defvar \"calc-dollar-values\"?

          "description": "I see that Emacs has many superfluous key bindings, especially C-f, C-b, C-p, C-n, C-a, C-e, C-d, C-v, M-v, which are for functions with already dedicated keys on the keyboard. The dedicated keys are easily accessible on my custom keyboards, so these default bindings do not benefit me at all, and they occupy convenient places for some more useful functions.\n Is there a keymap for Emacs designed to override these bindings with some functions which are useful and by default less easily accessible?\n A naive idea would be to replace the bindings with whatever I want. But that would not be optimal because that would free some slightly less convenient key combinations which could be taken by some slightly less useful functions, & c., so an optimal result would move many functions from less convenient key combinations to more convenient key combinations. So it would have generally simpler key bindings maybe very different from the default ones. That design requires some serious thought, so reinventing this would be difficult, so I would rather look if someone has already done something like that.\n    submitted by    /u/matj1  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "A few days ago I found out about Open RSS. So far I only use it to get beautifully crafted feeds of YouTube channels and playlists with video descriptions and thumbnails. \n I could have just used the feeds provided by YouTube instead, only if entries would have thumbnails and video descriptions.\n I could have just used an “intelligent” reader like Feedly. But I don’t like proprietary garbage with integrated AI that just ends up making my life harder. And also it’s not Emacs. \n I could have just an alternative frontend like Invidious. But playlist feeds don’t have thumbnails and videos, entries obviously link to invidious instances and not to YouTube directly and these public instances are slow. I didn’t have the resources to selfhost my own instance and just wanted a convenient, performant solution. \n I could have just used Elfeed in conjunction with Elfeed-tube. These packages are actually great, but I’m a Gnus user. \n For anyone with similar opinions and experiences Open RSS might be very well worth a try. For me it hits a perfect sweet spot. It’s also privacy-friendly and is developed in a transparent fashion. Although the source code is not publicly available, at least as far as I know. But that’s understandable as they’re kept alive by their user’s donations.\n Mark, the developer of Open RSS, is quick to reply if one encounters any issues and already helped me out once.\n    submitted by    /u/schwinghmmr  \n [link]   [comments]",

It's really just an optimized early-init.el and an init.el that strives for fast startup times and sensible default settings. All the magic that is necessary is included. This is really nice because there's a lot of conflicting information online about the best way to optimize GC, etc. in early-init.el and this project does it for you. I've seen similar settings but I also saw some new stuff I didn't know about. \n It is designed to keep those two files in git so you can update Minimal-Emacs. Setup additional modules for user customization in pre-early-init.el, post-early-init.el and pre/post for init.el as well. \n It's up to the user to add to the base. If you start with this kit then proceed to watch System Crafters Emacs from Scratch series, it will get you up and running very quickly. \n James put a lot of effort into this base starter kit and I am digging it, no cap FR as the whippersnappers are accustomed to proclaiming. ;-)\n    submitted by    /u/JamesBrickley  \n [link]   [comments]",

After googling I found out that the problem has already been solved in magit over a year ago. Because I'm updating the Emacs packages once in a month, I was wondering why it is still in my local magit installation.\n The reason is that the release versions on NonGNU Elpa and Melpa Stable are still version 3.3.0, which was released on Oct 4, 2021. Does somebody know the reason why there are no new releases on those archives?\n Yes, I know I could use Melpa Unstable, but I don't want it, because I'm serving a lot of my colleagues with an Emacs configuration and I don't want to use unstable package versions.\n Yes, I know I could ask directly on GitHub, but I don't want to create an account for just one question.\n    submitted by    /u/Wumpitz  \n [link]   [comments]",

After a bit of trying out different configs I got it working with the OAuth 2.0 setup of my employer. \n Now I'm trying to actually use it, but I find it somewhat unexpected; perhaps that's because I have used org-gcal for a while and was expecting something similar, i.e. synchronizing of the calendar entries into an org file which can be linked to my org-agenda (and calfw).\n For example, a very frequent occurrence is to schedule meetings with other people (in person). This generally works by everybody looking at their calendar to find a spot in e.g. the next week where all of us are available. Is this possible with Excorporate? To me it seems it's only possible to check the calendar entries for a given day (via M-x calendar, moving to the date, pressing d or e), but not get a list of all the events, or all the events in a week/month. \n Furthermore, creating events seems to be possible via the API (https://github.com/emacsmirror/excorporate/blob/master/excorporate.info, chapter 6 API Usage), but this functionality is not exposed as an interactive function. Does that mean I have to write my own helper functions here?

          "description": "Hello fellow Emacs enthusiasts!\n I've noticed an interesting behavior difference between fill-paragraph in text-mode and org-fill-paragraph in org-mode, particularly when working with selected regions.\n Here's what I've observed:\n  \nIn text-mode, fill-paragraph respects the selected region and only operates within it.\n In org-mode, org-fill-paragraph doesn't seem to respect the selected region and operates on the entire paragraph.\n  \nI've created a GIF to illustrate this difference:\n https://i.redd.it/7trbpcthrqgd1.gif\n I initially thought this was a bug and submitted a report, but it was determined not to be one.\n I'd like to open this up for community discussion to get your thoughts and insights.\n In org-mode, the behavior remains the same whether a region is selected or not. When no region is selected, I believe this behavior is appropriate.\n However, the issue arises when a user explicitly selects a region, expecting the fill operation to be limited to that selection.\n I think org-fill-paragraph should respect the selected region, similar to how fill-paragraph works in text-mode.\n What do you think about this behavior?\n  \nUpdate: Now that I've reviewed the org-fill-paragraph function documentation again, I understand the current behavior.\n  \nThe REGION argument is non-nil if called interactively; in that\n case, if Transient Mark mode is enabled and the mark is active,\n fill each of the elements in the active region, instead of just\n filling the current element.\"\n  \nUnlike text-mode's fill-paragraph, org-fill-paragraph is designed to \"fill each of the elements in the active region.\"\n The current behavior seems to be explained by this information.\n Thank you for your opinions!\n    submitted by    /u/tttuuu888  \n [link]   [comments]",

It seems reddit has also signed some exclusive deal with Google allowing only Google to index it.\n \nThe way Reddit know handles blocking by other users. Sometime ago I began to notice that so many responses had some error like deleted and unavailable. Something I remarked on in this thread - Why do some reddit users especially on r/emacs keep messing up threads their involved by deleting their posts or making them unavailable? I don't see why some people should disrupt a technical discussion by blocking some participants who can't see what is going. It is not as though this Twitter or Facebook, this is simply a technical forum and the discussions don't often veer into the political. What kind of mindset does it take to block someone because you don't want them to read your views on technical issues, and it is not as though the person blocked cannot login using another account to see the thread?\n \n These two issues are making this forum less appealing.

I don't have much to go on but my assumption was that when the rust-analyzer was working or Rust LSP was communicating it was causing it to panic and crash but this was just an assumption and I was having trouble getting much out of --debug-init. This user was able to downgrade to version 29.3 and it solved their problems.\n Recently I've completely uninstalled rust, emacs and doom emacs and found wayland-emacs on the aur which I didn't notice last time. I've reinstalled Rust and now I'm going to attempt to install this AUR package and go from there. Another issue I was having was opening Fish shell in Doom Emacs with Term which wasn't an issue before until installing Rust.\n It's also important to note that I've had this Arch + Hyprland install for about 2 weeks and Doom Emacs hasn't given any issues what so ever until installing rust and rust-analyzer but also I upgraded around the same time and I know there was an upgrade 2 days ago. Thanks for reading, I wanted to try and be thorough so I apologize for the length of this.\n P.S The user on Arch I was talking about with a similar issue was using X11\n EDIT: solved, I use the pacaman package manager to uninstall emacs-wayland and installed emacs instead. So far rust hasn't crashed when editing or coding rs files in doom and rust-analayzer is working. Must install with rustup component add rust-analyzer though, not your package manager. and using vterm this time with no issues.. yet ;)\n    submitted by    /u/HaK_0ryX  \n [link]   [comments]",

I was thinking that having a single \"log buffer\" into which the messages would be written would prevent buffer spamming, and then I could just show the operator a different particular message in each window. Playing around with different things, trying to use indirect buffers with some sort of region narrowing seemed to be a good possible option.\n I didn't have much luck with this though:\n  (let ((org-dates (list \"2020-04-05\" \"2023-08-02\" \"2021-09-08\" \"2019-08-04\"))) (delete-other-windows) (split-window-right) (split-window-right) (split-window-right) (balance-windows) (dolist (earlier-journal-entry org-dates) (pop-to-buffer (make-indirect-buffer (get-buffer-create \"*Org Roam Daily Reflection Log*\") (generate-new-buffer-name \"*indirect*\"))) (let* ((start (point)) (org-msg (concat \"\\n\\n* No daily journal entry for \" earlier-journal-entry \".\"))) (insert org-msg) ;; (org-mode) (narrow-to-region start (point))))) \n In particular, the narrowing doesn't seem to work right.

I have tried several solutions, but they all are just solutions which means tabs will be filled with 'x' no of spaces. not tabs with TABS.

          "description": "I have quite a few projects and meeting and i keep track of them by using columnview dynamic block to show them in the project (each meeting has a property which points to the project and :match searches for the property). Columview has an option to add Links (so i just need to click on it and see what has been discussed). But this link feature doesnt work if the item are in a different file. \n So when capturing a meeting with org-capture i just created another property like:\n :LINK: [[file:~/org/meetings.org::*%\\1][%\\1]]\n which is essentially a link to itself, where %\\1 is the Meeting Title and the org headline and add this Property to the columnview. That way i can click on it form a project and see what the meeting was about.\n Now the Problem: the headline might not be unique (e.g. weekly repeating meeting) and there for i thought it might be a better idea to use a custom_id for example. So i tried to use a capture template like this:\n * %^{Meeting}\n :PROPERTIES:\n :PROJECT:\n :ATTENDEE:\n :LINK: [[file:~/org/meetings.org::*%\\1][%\\1]\n :CUSTOM_ID: %<%Y%m%d%H%M%S>-%(string-replace \" \" \"-\" \"%\\\\1\")\n :LINK2: [[id:%<%Y%m%d%H%M%S>-%(replace-regexp-in-string \"\\s\" \"-\" \"%\\\\1\")][%\\1]]\n :ID: %(org-id-new)\n :END:\n I try to replace the whitespace in the headline as this would be no valid ID. But that doesnt work it gets evaluated but the whitespaces are not replaced. i could reuse :ID: aswell but dont know how in a capture template.

I'm writing both python and rust, and my issue is that when I select a completion for a function name or class, it always puts opening and closing parenthesis after it, automatically. Meaning, I type:\n my_obj.beginning_of_metho\n and it (corfu) gives me the option:\n beginning_of_method\n I select it, and what it inserts is:\n my_obj.beginning_of_method(argname1, argname2)\n Which is right 80% of the time, and infuriating that 20% of the time that I needed to pass that bare function somewhere. Its more annoying with class names, it puts parens in when I'm just trying to make a type hint. \n I've seen this behavior with rust-analyzer, jedi-language-server and pyright, so I don't think its server specific, and I've seen it with lsp-mode and eglot so I don't think its specific to those modes. I'm using corfu, but I haven't figured out a switch in corfu to change this behavior.\n The ideal behavior in my opinion would be when I select the method name, it inserts just that:\n my_obj.beginning_of_method\n And then if I type an open paren\n my_obj.beginning_of_method(\n At that point it would insert the args with the closing paren.\n my_obj.beginning_of_method(argname1, argname2)\n Has anyone else figured out how to do this?

I used it years ago, then I forgot about it for a while, and recently came back.\n So I was wondering about the current best way to filter the posts by tags, so that I can focus on specific groups of posts instead of the entire stream. I was looking at Mike Zemansky's approach to filter the posts using a hydra and a macro. It looks pretty good, and I was working towards that. However, I realized that this approach was 7 years old. \n Hence, I was wondering if there are any better or improved ways to filter posts today, that were not referenced in Mike Zemansky's post? I believe in his code, emacs looks for all unique tags in the total feed, defines shortcut or hydra keys, and finally creates a hydra that the user can use to search for those posts. So it seems simple and nice. \n But as I said, I was not sure if there was a package to do this now, or do I have to write that code myself in my `.spacemacs` file.

This is acheived by changing the text properties of the code with the spaces taken from the formatted code.\n This can be useful when working in a team and the codebase is poorly formatted, or when you don't like the coding style and you want to view the code in the style you like.\n This can be seen as an ~equivalent~ to Resharper's Virtual Formatter, which I just heard about when I started working on this package, but never used it actually.\n The current implementation requires treesit, so you will need Emacs 29+ with Tree Sitter support.\n https://github.com/abougouffa/virtual-format\n Examples\n Original code\n before\n Visually formatted\n after\n Looking forward for your feedback!\n    submitted by    /u/abougouffa  \n [link]   [comments]",

I take care to kill the buffer on each iteration, but it doesn't seem to matter. But! If I let a function process only 500 files, then finish, then run it again for the next 500 and so on, it works out.

It's easy to use, automatic history and off device. But how do you deal with Personal Information in your Notes? Some of it might not be particularly interesting, but when you start using Due Dates and make Tasks on where to go, or whome you interact with, this could be different. Maybe you take a reminder to pick up some medication specific to a Illness you have.\n This might be even more of a problem if you use Org notes at work. Certainly most companies wouldn't want you to commit customer data to github/lab.\n So, how do you deal with this? So far the obvious thing is to keep Notes that are work related in their own folder and either not sync that or keep it on our own hosted gitlab instance.\n With personal notes this is a tougher call. I want them on two PCs and my phone. My experience with Syncthing over three devices in the past has been less than stelar. Any other recommendations that work reliably so i can finally leave google keep and todoist behind?

          "description": "I have two Linux computers and a Windows computer. I use Emacs on all of them. \n I've been looking for at handy way to share the Emacs configuration file between the computers. The basic step consists in letting the .emacs file on each computer load a common configuration file from a shared directory in Dropbox. With this in place, if I make a customization change on one computer, it is automatically available to the others.\n At least in theory.\n The challenge is that this sharing of a configuration file causes a lot of problems, because in many cases I want different configurations on the three computers. For example:\n  \nPath names to files will be different on my Linux and Windows computer.\n Font names are different.\n I have some project-specific configuration for a project that exists on one computer, but not on the others.\n  \nAlso, if I install a new Emacs package on one computer, it will not get automatically installed on the others, and this may cause configuration problems.\n All of this can be solved by a very strict discipline about what goes where in various configuration files. But what I'd really like to know is this: Has any of you successfully created such a setup that actually works very well? If so, what insight can you share?\n    submitted by    /u/oz1cz  \n [link]   [comments]",

A perspective is an independent workspace for Emacs, similar to multiple desktops in Gnome and MacOS. This integration allows you to easily know which project you're currently in, and focus on files that only belong to the current project when switching buffers.\n ⚠️ NOTE: This package has come to life adapting the great package persp-projectile by Bozhidar Batsov with ChatGPT. I didn't write a single line of code. What inspired me to create this package is my recent effort to avoid most third party packages, specially if they prefer a newly defined interface over the built-in Emacs interface.\n Also special shutout to Natalie Weizenbaum for making such a great package!\n I would appreciate any feedback, I'll try to submit the package to MELPA next.\n https://youtube.com/watch?v=CkiKLR7B634&feature=shared\n  \nIf this post reminds you of another, its NOT a mere coincidence.

          "description": "I've posted about the ekg notetaking app for emacs before. After a brief hiatus, I'm back working on it, and I'm pretty excited about the latest changes.\n A few weeks ago I also put out a new version of llm with a new module, llm-prompt, which allows templatized prompts that have easy and effective context filling, something that hasn't existed yet in any emacs module, AFAIK. The new version of ekg uses this new feature.\n Previously, the ekg-llm library would send the contents of the note, along with instructions to the LLM, which would then append to the note. Now, we also send the latest notes with the same tags, and similar notes, as part of the llm request context. This turns out to be a really important enhancement to the quality of the llm responses, and now using ekg is, IMHO, the best way to interact with LLMs. You can also edit the responses before you save them into a note (or just not save them at all). This is something else that can help improve the response quality. At times, the responses I'm getting are really magical - it really is what many people call a \"second brain\", but for real. I find myself using it constantly as a default way to interact with LLMs.\n I give an intro to ekg and talk about using it as a \"second brain\" in this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC_h3syRKro\n The other improvements to this version of ekg are primarily Markdown improvements (using markdown instead of org-mode is kind of necessary if you are using it to talk to llms), fixing issues and getting inline links to work.\n    submitted by    /u/ahyatt  \n [link]   [comments]",

Please help!\n Edited to add: After reading Micky Peterson's guide \"Demystifying Emacs' Window Manager\" I think I understand the display-buffer-alist better now. I also tried saving a layout to .emacs.desktop and I'm reading through that, too. I think what is causing issues for me is the Treemacs sidebar window is special and doesn't use a window.

So I tried mu u i. Ivy suggested many mu4e commands, but mu4e-update-index was not near the top.\n As I've learned since, completion-styles, set to (basic partial-completion emacs22), explains how mu-u-i matches.\n Ivy uses its own \"completion styles\" that are different from the default ones. The default is ivy--regex-plus.\n Now, it's not like Ivy is not matching the command, but it's definitely not in the top results.

The distinction I was trying to make was between direct and indirect claims.\nI'm currently working on taking more effective notes using the Zettelkasten method and have encountered a challenge when dealing with claims attributed to secondary sources.\nFor example, academic articles typically contain numerous references to outside sources. Many of the claims discussed are not original but rather derived from these secondary sources.\nMy struggle is with how to properly document these secondary claims in my notes when I'm unfamiliar with the sources being referenced. I feel uncomfortable directly citing them. However, these claims are often relevant and interesting, and I want to include them in my Zettelkasten for future reference.\nHere are some questions I have:\nHow do you approach taking notes on claims that are attributed to secondary sources when using the Zettelkasten method?\nDo you cite the original source, the secondary source, or both in your notes?\nHow do you ensure accuracy and avoid misinterpretation when you're not directly familiar with the primary source?\nAny strategies for efficiently exploring the primary sources when they seem particularly crucial to your understanding of the topic?\nI’d appreciate any advice or strategies that have worked for you when navigating this aspect of academic note-taking.

The promise of data ownership and flexibility was alluring. However, as time passed, I found myself gravitating back to cloud-based solutions.\nNow, I'm feeling the pull towards local files and Markdown again. It's as if I'm caught in a perpetual swing between the convenience of the cloud and the freedom of local storage.\nThis pattern has me wondering:\nIs this back-and-forth between local-first and cloud-based systems common in the PKM community?\nFor those who've made multiple switches, what ultimately made you settle on one approach (if you have)?\nAre there solutions that effectively bridge this gap, offering the best of both worlds?\nHow do others manage the trade-offs between sync convenience and data sovereignty?\nI'm starting to think this isn't just a fleeting concern, but a fundamental tension in how we approach PKM. The desire for true ownership of our data and the freedom to use multiple tools seems to persist, even after trying various solutions.\nHas anyone else found themselves in this PKM pendulum? How have you reconciled these competing needs in your own systems?",

This thought could be a bit conceited, therefore I have to add that I'm a bit like that too.\nEnough of shit-talking, I created this discussion to present my workflow.\nA bit of context:\nMy current zettelkasten is in fact an evolution of a blog I started ten years ago. Even with my efforts to save this blog over time (manual backup, git) I think I lost a few things.\nThen I started to want things simpler, markdown it is then. Static site generators (Hugo, Pelican, Jekyll).\nDuring the pandemic I started engaging cross-thought with my father about music. The game was to listening to a re…",

          "description": "Working with my Zettelkasten constantly evolves, as my needs change over time. It seems to be an endless journey to improve my personal knowledge management system. By chance, I discovered \"Wardley Mapping\" by Simon Wardley [1]. It's a method for understanding how to develop your strategies. My first idea to learn more about this visual tool was to apply it to my Zettelkasten strategy.\nLet's take a closer look. A Wardley map allows us to visualize the **Evolution **of business components over time. It starts from the unstable beginnings to more stable, standardized components. These components fall into four stages: genesis, custom, product, and commodity.\nFirst: Genesis components are novel and new. Second: Custom components exist for a specific use case with some proof of value. Third: P…",

The major change was my first contact with the Zettelkasten framework (2). It was hard for me to change my personal organization from thinking in \"folders\" to \"tagging\" (3). My current challenge is to use analytical reading to improve my notes (4).\nWhat will the next steps be? What are your recommendations?\nReferences\nhttps://learnwardleymapping.com/book/.",

Struggled as to what category to put this under - I guess it pertains to workflow, writing and the zettelkasten method more broadly...\nI'm a PhD candidate and (inconsistently) use techniques shared here to organise my notes and ideas. It's been a slow burn for me, but more and more I'm seeing the potential benefits of the zettelkasten approach. But I had a question about dealing with the messiness of writing over the long term alongside note-taking in the zettelkasten.\nI'll try and give a specific example. I'm currently working on one chapter of my thesis. I'm going through a literature note for something that I read for this chapter, and I'm seeing ideas that could be worthy to turn into their own seperate notes/zettels, and I could see potential use for them in a specific ch…",
