It can be achieved without newtype wrapping or having orphan instances, using the DerivingVia GHC extension:\n newtype SqlUUID a = MkSqlUUID a instance (a ~ UUID) => FromField a where fromField field = ... -- The definition is not really interesting, same as you would write for a UUID minus the MkSqlUUID wrapping instance (a ~ UUID) => ToField a where toField (MkSqlUUID uuid) = ... -- Again, not really interesting -- In another module: newtype UserId = MkUserId UUID deriving FromField via (SqlUUID UUID) deriving ToField via (SqlUUID UUID) \n I've tested this and it seems to work but I'm not a very experienced haskell so there might be some downsides/pitfalls using this method that I'm not aware of. Let me know what you think :)\n Edit: probably should've been more clear. It doesn't solve the orphan instances problem in general but previously I needed an orphan FromField UUID and ToField UUID so I can do deriving FromField for my UserId type.\n    submitted by    /u/Actual_Ad4965  \n [link]   [comments]",

As a hobby project, I am building a collaborative web-based code editor with a Haskell-backend and a Typescript+React frontend.\n I have finished implementing the Operational Transformation logic (the core logic behind resolving multiple asynchronous edits to a central document) in Haskell, and am now in the process of designing the backend. Architecturally, I think clients communicating with the server via WebSockets would be the obvious choice.\n To that end, what would be the best tool to set up WebSocket servers? I’ve spend some time googling about yesod-websockets and Network.Websockets (jaspervdj/websockets), but I am having trouble deciding which would be best for my context.

What would you recommend to someone who just finished this book, but doesn't have any other significant coding experience they can put on their resume?\n    submitted by    /u/Common-Program-2617  \n [link]   [comments]",

Here is a screenshot:\n https://imgur.com/a/EeN4vW9\n I would say that autocomplete is essential when authoring HTML with Tailwind because otherwise you have to keep referring to the cheat sheet, and if you make a typo or attempt a sizing that doesn't exist then there is no type safety to tell you.\n And info hovers are also useful for reading code because it shows you the actual CSS for each class (otherwise you again have to refer to the cheat sheet all the time or memorize all of the tailwind classes).\n Instructions:\n First install the tailwind extension for VS Code: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss\n Then you will need to create a tailwind.config.js file. You can use this:\n module.exports = { content: [\"./src/**/*.hs\"], theme: { extend: {}, }, plugins: [], }; \n In order for the VS Code extension to work, it seems that it needs a local/project install of tailwind and postcss, so you can run this:\n $ npm init $ npm install tailwindcss $ npm install postcss \n Finally, the crucial step: in your VS Code settings.json add these two settings to configure the extension:\n  \"tailwindCSS.includeLanguages\": { \"haskell\": \"html\" }, \"tailwindCSS.experimental.classRegex\": [ \"class_ \\\"([^\\\"]*)\" ], \n I believe that the above regex should also work if you are using blaze-html instead of Lucid (but I have not tested it).\n Good luck! \n Btw, here is an additional repo I found with info on Tailwind CSS in Haskell: https://github.com/obsidiansystems/obelisk-tailwind-example\n    submitted by    /u/bitconnor  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'd definitely appreciate if I could, say, dynamically compile and link these scripts for maximum performance, and have the scripting language just be Haskell. A core principal of this engine is that you may have multiple instances of a game being managed by the same process (for example, a server and client being run simultaneously, multiple servers, some of which might have different scripts, etc). A script could contain anything from a map file to a custom game mode, to say, admin commands, and I want these to have as much isolation from raw IO as I can.\n    submitted by    /u/VincyThePrincy  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "After reading https://graphitemaster.github.io/aau/ I'm feeling that using signed integers in Haskell makes even less sense than in imperative languages, but unsigned integers (Words) are almost never used. It feels strange for correctness oriented language. I've looked at functions in Data.List and 4 out of 5 functions taking integer parameters (replicate, take, drop, splitAt) are actually doing n' = max n 0 with their argument, and only one ((!!)) throws an error with negative argument. In Data.Vector a ton of functions is taking integer parameters, and I've checked only the analogs of functions from Data.List and they behave the same (indexing throws, while other functions have this \"wrap to 0\" behavior for negative values).\n Isn't it sweeping problems under the rug?

          "description": "One of the things that amazes me about Haskell is the rabbit holes I'm ceaselessly cascading down. For example, what I thought was an innocent question turned out to be my latest rabbit hole, i.e. apparently Haskell doesn't have real recursive types. Apparently, what I thought was a recursive type, e.g.\n data Peano = Zero | Succ Peano \n is not really a recursive type, although I'm not sure why. My previous question about what turned out to be the omega combinator brought up the true nature of Haskell recursive types and the mysterious newtype \"workaround\". So this talks about a real natural number recursive type (as does my previous question)\n MyNat = One :+: MyNat \n MyList a = One :+: (a :*: MyList a)\n I can't truly fathom what's being done/said here, e.g., no idea what is meant first paragraph in by a typed tagless-final interpreter. Simple blind acceptance, which is just hand-waving, isn't my style. And the logic programming course it references is, well, my latest rabbit hole. Can somebody give me some intro material to this whole issue of what really is a recursive type. This all started, BTW, with trying to understand what a type equation meant. Can you guess how many pdfs and web pages I've opened since then? Fazit: Somebody (me?) needs to pull all these threads together into one big Haskell-Omni textbook. The existing beginner texts are too handwavy, IMHO. There's a kiddie version of Haskell and a grownup's version. The kiddie version is pretty much useless, again, IMHO, unless it's to spur you on to the bigger stuff.\n    submitted by    /u/teilchen010  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Sorry for the wall of text, but I've been reading a lot of guides and not really getting the answer I need. If anyone wants to help a complete newcomer, I could really use it.\n I've read some monad tutorials/lectures and I think I have a beginner's understanding. Basically what I took away was \"without unsafePerformIO, which you should not use, Monad types like M a can't be converted to a. Instead you compose your Monad functions with pure functions using operators like <$> or >>=.\" I also think I understand this distinction between \"pure\" and \"monad\" functions helps the haskell compiler be extremely cool.\n That sounds really good, but I'm having trouble understanding how to structure an application around this. I'm trying to teach myself Haskell by writing an interactive fiction game. So far I have an RPG-style dice roller written, but it's deterministic. I'm creating a seed from the system time inside of a do, using the <- operator. I then use (basically) randomRs (_,_) (mkStdGen seed). Because I used do and I wasn't sure what to do after that though, so I tried using unsafePerformIO and I'm almost certain this is why my dice roller rolls the same numbers every time.\n Do I have to make all my roll-processing functions and the entire skill system speak IO Int and pass up and down an updated stdGen? I am pretty sure the answer is \"no,\" since I can use bind to invoke pure functions. But if that's true, I'm not sure how to apply that while designing a whole application.\n I guess what I'm unsure of is how to structure something larger than a few functions around all of this.

To do so, I intend to prepare a minimal case that reproduces the issue on the compiler version that the GHC developers would most prefer. I'm having trouble doing that though:\n 1) Which is the GHC version that would be the most useful for GHC developers? 8.10.7, the one the majority of the users currently use (me included)? 9.2.1 which is the latest stable release? Or GHC HEAD? \n 2) Unless the answer to (1) above is GHC 8.10.7, what's the easiest way to obtain that GHC version, very preferably without polluting my system globally? I've built GHC HEAD using the great nix-shell provided by https://github.com/alpmestan/ghc.nix, which allowed me to build it without installing any system dependencies globally. But I can't figure out how to run the resulting GHC, I have ./inplace/bin/runghc which I can use to interpret .hs files and I have ./inplace/bin/ghc-stage2, but that one results in a billion linker errors when I try to compile anything. I've also tried installing GHC versions via ghcup, but that one also fails because I think I'm supposed to install some system dependencies, but I really don't like doing that if at all possible.\n It might be a good idea to update the report a bug page in the GHC wiki with this information.

          "description": "Hello everyone, as a means to learn Haskell I've decided to write a very basic Web3 implementation in it, everything has been great so far but I'm having a really hard time trying to encode integers that are greater than 8 bytes because of the data types. I've come across some useful libraries but settled on using Data.Binary. Here's an example of something I want to do in Elixir:\n ```elixir\n This just gives you a 32 bytes representation of that number\n <<3214000000000000000000::signed-256>>\n  \n<<0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 174, 59,\n  \n53, 195, 127, 137, 120, 0, 0>>\n ```\n On Haskell I've tried and it works with smaller numbers (Whatever fits into Int64), but with bigger ones:\n ```haskell\n B64.encode $ BL.toStrict $ runPut $ putInt64be 3214000000000000000000\n <interactive>:61:48: warning: [-Woverflowed-literals]\n Literal 3214000000000000000000 is out of the Int range -9223372036854775808..9223372036854775807\n \"AAB4iX/DNTs=\"\n ```\n Which does not give me the correct representation since the value is out of bounds (I think the number it sticks with is 4266531174538018816 (maxBound :: Int64) rather than the one I passed)\n ​\n So, I wanted to ask, what are my options to encode these numbers in the same way I can do on the first Elixir example?

I have successfully connected the joy cons and I'm reading the input in the stepping function (6th argument of play - called periodically) instead of the event handling function (5th argument), as the latter only recognizes keyboard and mouse input. Here is an excerpt of what I'm doing in the step function, the full details of handleSwitch can be seen here (essentially read input if the buttons are pressed when the stepping function is called, interpret the input and update the scene).\n stepGame :: Float -> C.System' () stepGame dT = do ... ASTM.forkSys (Switch.handleSwitch dT) ... \n Unfortunately, the player may respond to the first few inputs but then the game crashes. I thought it was a race hazard so I wrapped handleSwitch in forkSys (creates a new thread for switch input) but the issue persists.\n Any ideas on what might be going wrong and how to fix this?

We have tests for lib now (with lib listed under test `dependencies:`), and exe depends on lib in the same way, but there is an aspect of the exe I'd like to test.\n I have tried to use `verbatim` in my package.yaml to get hpack to pass along `build-tool-depends`:, which should allow me to reference a `project:executable`. I do see it does include it at the bottom of that `test-suite` in the generated Cabal output, but I still get a `Could not find module` in the test file itself (what I am importing there is listed in the `executable` section `other-modules:`) when running `stack test`.\n I have also tried referencing the exe in the new test with `build-tools:`. It makes it into the cabal file, but without the project name prefix I originally included, and does not seem to help either.\n Any possible things I am missing or should try instead? It generates a cabal file with what I thought should work, but it does not seem to be exposing the module I am trying to import from exe in the test. Thanks so much! \n Versions: * Stack resolver: lts-18.15 * Cabal: Cabal-3.2.1.0 * Running on a M1 Mac 12.1 in a Rosetta terminal (should not be ARM related, as it builds/tests just fine without the above attempt, just giving for context)\n ==== QUOTE END ====\n Remark from me (u/Martinsos): We also read that one solution is to move all the exe code to the lib and then exe just becomes an extremely thin wrapper. However, I love having this separation between exe and lib, on one hand to make sure that lib doesn't in any way depend on exe, and also because external/hackage dependencies are nicely separated, so I would rather avoid that if there is a nicer way to do it.\n    submitted by    /u/Martinsos  \n [link]   [comments]",

Is there anything I can do to make this part of the program go faster?\n Ideally I want something like this:\n for each state in possible_future_states: new thread(target=BFS, args=variables updated with this state being chosen) \n Thank you for reading this. Any advice is greatly appreciated.\n ​\n EDIT:\n This is my current attempt\n https://pastebin.com/8sMRCxR6\n    submitted by    /u/Commie1984  \n [link]   [comments]",

So then i tried to cabal install gloss but it outputs the following error message:\n cabal: Missing dependency on a foreign library: * Missing (or bad) C library: GL This problem can usually be solved by installing the system package that provides this library (you may need the \"-dev\" version). If the library is already installed but in a non-standard location then you can use the flags --extra-include-dirs= and --extra-lib-dirs= to specify where it is.If the library file does exist, it may contain errors that are caught by the C compiler at the preprocessing stage. In this case you can re-run configure with the verbosity flag -v3 to see the error messages. cabal: Failed to build OpenGLRaw-3.3.4.1 (which is required by gloss-1.13.2.1). See the build log above for details. \n So naturally i tried to install the library with cabal, OpenGlRaw but that gave the same error message except the gloss part. I tried to find information about this library but couldn't find anything useful for me, I am using nixos but the error appears on a secondary computer with fedora as well. I have opengl installed through my NixOS configuration and i have tried several c compilers or other openGL packages.

If it was modified to pass in a starting string, it would still produce a list of random length strings, so the even if the parameter is the same, the results will be different almost all of the time.\n Or is it not a pure fn, and is it then fairly easy to write non-pure functions in Haskell?\n TIA\n ​\n    submitted by    /u/Mag_hockey  \n [link]   [comments]",

Everything about it is great!\n Except compilation times, even incremental. Now, I do everything on my laptop (Thinkpad with OK specs), because I like to use ssh to a FreeBSD VM and use raw Vim, and when the VM is local it doesn't care about network interruptions or a wonky ISP. I like a normal SSH session because of the scroll history, and I like to use i3wm to lay out and manage terminals and using mosh or something would require tmux which I find more awkward.\n If I try out a high-end server just to compare compilation times, it's more than twice as fast. How to take advantage of that?\n Is there something like a distcc for SBT, or another way to leverage remote CPU power? Even if I have to put it in my local network? I guess I could run the build environment on a build server and only expose the sourcecode via NFS or such to the laptop (which should recover after a network interruption), or some edit-over-ssh tool.\n What is everyone else doing?\n    submitted by    /u/androidthepandroid  \n [link]   [comments]",

To demonstrate this, I took the http4s g8 template, set it up with Scala 3.1.0, added sbt native-image, started the nativeImageRunAgent and ran a single request against GET /joke. After stopping the server, the native-image run agent generated the reflective configs that are required for this path of execution. Comparing the generated Scala 2.13 with the Scala 3 configs yields a bloated version for Scala 3 that contains these additional rules:\n { \"name\":\"org.http4s.Header$Raw$\", \"fields\":[{\"name\":\"0bitmap$1\"}]} , { \"name…",

          "description": "So I see that Lightbend is investing heavily in Akka (and Akka Serverless). I also noticed the hype around Akka for .Net. However, my experience with Akka has been one of a somewhat struggle and I am curious to know if things have changed in the last few years.\n My (only) attempt with Akka was 3-4 years ago when I wrote a web-service based on it. I remember how some things that would have been trivial if carried out with Future/Cats-effect/ZIO required quite a lot of coding in Akka. Two examples that I can think of:\n Concurrent requests:\n Some requests to the service required gathering information from several different actors asynchronously before returning a response. This required me to follow the \"Aggregator Pattern\": Sending the requests to the relevant actors and then changing context to accumulate (and keep track of) the responses . If I wanted to add an optional timeout I also had to set a timer with a Timeout message and cancel it once all responses arrived. It felt to me like this could have been more easily carried out with a Future.sequence(...) (if timeout is not necessary) or with parTraverse(...)/foreachPar(...) (Cats-effect/ZIO) with an optional .timeout(...) setting.\n Asynchronous execution:\n I many cases I found out that some synchronous tasks took longer than I initially thought, hurting my actor's responsiveness. However - if I decided to make those tasks asynchronous I had to write a new actor specifically for them. Compare this with wrapping a synchronous piece of code with a Future/IO/ZIO and it seems like a lot of boiler-plate for a relatively-simple refactor.\n What's common to both of those cases is the sense that I had to personally take care of behaviors that could/should have been abstracted away for me... \n I was wondering if programming in Akka still feels so low-level...\n    submitted by    /u/TheOtherNoamC  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "This is a post introducing the new changes of Iron v1.2.0.\n What is Iron ?\n Iron is a type constraints (or type refinement) library for Scala 3. It uses Dotty's inline and opaque types to evaluate constraints at compile-time.\n Here is a simple example: ```scala def log(x: Double > 0d): Refined[Double] = x.map(Math.log)\n log(-1d) //Compile-time error ```\n Features of 1.2.0\n Release 1.2.0 brings two key features: an imperative-styled DSL and constraints relations/consequences.\n Imperative DSL\n Iron brings a new imperative-styled DSL directly inspired by Martin Odersky's Representing Monad with Capabilities (HOPE 2021).\n Here is the \"imperative\" form of our log(x) method presented above: scala def log(x: Double > 0d): Raw[Double] = refined { Math.log(x) }  In this example, x is automatically unboxed via an implicit conversion only available inside refined and Math.log(x) is automatically boxed into a new Constrained.\n Capabilities work for other kind of monads. If you want to use capabilities in your project, I highly suggest you to watch the talk linked above.\n Consequences\n A consequence has basically a definition analoguous to logical implication => (do not confuse it with Scala's functions). It is used to convert a Constrained value to another Constrained.\n While a default implementation exists for all conversions, this new typeclass allows you to define specific relations (like transitivity, reflexivity etc...) that have two major benefits: - Check some conversions at compile-time where (for example, we know that a constrained value A / B can't be converted to A / Not[B]). - Avoid unnecessary evaluations at runtime.\n Note that Consequences are not exclusive to mathematical/numerical values.\n That's all for this release. For further information, check the release on Github.\n Happy new year!\n    submitted by    /u/Il_totore  \n [link]   [comments]",

At this point I have working versions of two of the more useful of their tools, the justification- and assumption-based truth maintenance systems (JTMS and ATMS).\n Truth maintenance systems track the relationships among possible beliefs, reasoning rules, incompatible/contradictory beliefs, and the conclusions we might draw from them. The JTMS stores a single context of which beliefs we might adopt; the ATMS tracks all of the various environments which might support the possible beliefs without contradiction. TMSes can guide search in reasoning engines, or can directly serve as models for program domains.\n The JTMS and ATMS code here are simple translations of F&dK's implementation, translated with minimal changes into Scala. Part of my motivation is to have a deeper look at their code, and I'll likely add documentation in the next few weeks, and possibly additional tool translations.\n On Scaladex or Github.

To give you some context, I never professionally worked with Scala so I have a lot of assumptions which certainly aren't applicable.\n My first question would be about Tagless Final and ZIO. Because ZIO embeds its own Error type as ZIO[R, E, A], if using ZIO as a Tagless Final, it becomes possible to abstract and hide away one layer or Errors. So I have been trying to separate System errors from Business errors in the sake of having a Domain layer curated of error handling for the System errors.\n System error would be, what I qualify as lower level and environmental errors, as network connection drop, remote service being unreachable, etc. Business erro…",

Easy tasks like displaying a table of all D&D sessions is achievable with the column mode, but how about more complex aggreagations? For my studies, I created tiddlers for every subject including information for CP, semester, and category. In my overview, each semester is listed as seperate heading with the subjects being displayed by category as description lists and the CP summed up for each category. Please refer to the screenshot.\n In TiddlyWiki I can use filter expressions to select any tiddler (entry) from the wiki and extract data from it. This data can be transformed into arbitrary HTML, which is rendered when the article is visited. This query and transformation is done in the Wiki's own syntax, which is a part of the reason I wanted to switch to Emacs.\n How would I recreate this in OrgMode? I'm okay with having all information in one file and don't mind to learn elisp.

I heavily rely on tags to organize the notes and a feature that I wasn't able to find in org-roam is the possibility to have a list of all the tags I created, so that I can select a tag from this list and obtain a list of files with that tag. I know I can use org-roam-node-find, type the name of a tag and filter the files with that tag. However, given the large amount of tags I'm using, it's very hard to memorize all of them and I don't always know the exact name of the tag I'm looking for. Therefore, having a complete list with all the tags would be very helpful for me.

          "description": "Hi, I recently started using emacs and I'm coming from vscode (with vim emulation, I can't leave vim keybindings), and one of the things that are keeping me from going all-in with emacs, is the fact that there is no \"clear\" way to customize emacs and get what you want, or at least it's not clear to beginners.\n For example, in vscode there is syntax highlighting for a huge amount of languages, and if I want more complete support for a specific language I can install an extension easy peasy from the extension tab, in emacs, on the other hand, I would have to search for a package, install it, learn what it can do and configure it. It's somewhat daunting for someone who is not an expert like me.\n Do you guys have any advice on how to customize emacs in a simple yet efficient way (I know there are some pre-configured distros like doom or space, I still have to look into those)? My aim is to be able to add whatever feature to my emacs config easily because I want it to be feature rich.\n In the end, emacs seems to be a really powerful tool compared to vscode (which I think is already pretty powerful), but it's not clear *how* you should use it...\n    submitted by    /u/Dumb-Ptr  \n [link]   [comments]",

'(((kbd \"SPC\") . some-function) ;; I know space can be bound to like this ((kbd \"RET\") . some-other-function) ;; and return like this ((kbd \"CTRL\") . function3) ((kbd \"META\") . function4) ((kbd \"CAPSLOCK\") . function5) ;; But the last three kbd functions yield the string argument itself )) \n Is binding to ctrl and meta alone possible at all? If so, how would one accomplish this within a minor mode definition?\n Thanks\n Edit: After I posted here I found a similar problem to mine, which the poster solved with an OS-level workaround. This would not really be a great solution for me since it would also change behavior outside of Emacs.

Let me try to explain:\n I've written a minor-mode for reading that affects some already buffer-local variables, like indicate-empty-lines, or blink-cursor-mode, etc. These are variables that might already have buffer-local values that I want to persist as I'm toggling my minor mode on and off (in my specific case, I want to turn reading-mode on when I enter view-mode, and off when I exit that mode).\n My current implementation can be found in my emacs configuration, but it doesn't work correctly and I feel like there might be a better way built-in to Emacs.

However, if I already have two windows open, they end up opening a third window by splitting the current window. The behaviour up until yesterday (...) was that in case of two open windows in the frame, the commands would use the non-current window. \n I have been going through my config and can't figure out what changed!

This is my solution to that problem.\n OneWayOut (owo) can export all your OneNote notes to Emacs Org Mode (or any Pandoc-supported Markdown, as of today), and allows you to tailor the results to your best liking by:\n  \nGiving you complete control over the Pandoc call \n \nAllowing you to post-process the Pandoc output with tailored Markup Packs.\n \n You can see a test OneNote note and its Emacs Org Mode and Pandoc Markdown exports here https://github.com/alopezrivera/owo#results\n Markup Packs are markup-format-specific functions containing search and replace queries executed at runtime against the text output by Pandoc. If search and replace doesn't cut it, you can add a postprocessing scriptblock to increase your freedom. They effectively give you control over how all is rendered, including\n - Headers\n - Metadata (eg: note creation date) \n - Other markup elements such as horizontal lines, custom indentations and formatting, and whatever else you might be able to conjure up with the text in your notes\n OneWayOut is built on the foundation of ConvertOneNote2Markdown (https://github.com/theohbrothers/ConvertOneNote2Markdown), by SjoerdV (https://github.com/SjoerdV), and improved by nixsee (https://github.com/nixsee/) and theohbrothers (https://github.com/theohbrothers).\n All feedback or suggestions are welcome!

I can only think of putting them all in the same file(s), generating the autoloads file for it (with update-file-autoloads), and then loading the generated file instead of the original. The problem with this is that it would then load all the functions in the file instead of only the requested one, wouldn't it?

With my article, you may have a go-to to send out for rising the awareness in peers.\n Maybe you know some positive examples and want to share them in the comments below?\n I once read about a research department(?) in the early eighties where secretaries were using GNU/Emacs and even creating lots of Elisp functions \"just because nobody told them that this is actual programming. They just did this because this made their life easier.\" (paraphrased from my memory).\n So, is there a good story you know where non-tech-savvy people were using \"nerdy\" tools like GNU/Emacs? \n Ceterum autem censeo don't contribute anything relevant in web forums like Reddit only\n    submitted by    /u/publicvoit  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "author": null,
          "description": "Hi,\n Recently, I came up of an idea that we can practice natural language (for me, it's English) speaking using subtitle files, as they already have timestamps along with subtitle texts, so that we can loop over specific parts of a video file easily by taking advantage of those timestamps, instead of setting the start time and end time of the playback manually and then looping over it.\n And then I thought of a package, subed, which jumped into my eyes when I was wandering around Sacha Chua's blog (kudos to @sachac). And I found it was perfect for this idea after playing with it for ~10 minutes.\n Here are the steps: 1. Open a subtitle file, say foo.srt, subed will automatically open the accompany video file having the name foo.mp4/foo.mk4/foo.avi etc using mpv. 2. Then in the subtitle buffer, only these three key bindings will do the job: 1. C-c C-l toggles looping over the current subtitle By default, there is an extra second before and after the time span, as specified in the config subed-loop-seconds-before & subed-loop-seconds-after. 2. M-n moves the point to the next subtitle, and it automatically seek the playback to the corresponding timeline. 3. M-p moves the point to the previous subtitle and seek the playback to the right position of the timeline.\n Although the package is designed to be used to edit subtitles efficiently, it could also shine in language speaking/shadowing.\n If you're also learning foreign languages, I believe this workflow can help you.✌\n    submitted by    /u/whatacold  \n [link]   [comments]",

While the auto-composition-mode is no longer guilty, my problem is still that ligatures have a very bad performance. I guess ligatures having bad performance in emacs are known, because they're mentioned in the doom FAQ.\n I recently installed emacs (doom) on a new manjaro installation and since I started using it I've been noticing that moving on a buffer and inserting text feels very laggy, and after a couple of minutes that becomes increasingly noticeable to the point where it's really hard to type, taking up to a couple of seconds to see the input being written on the screen.\n So I decided to investigate further into this, and tried disabling minor modes one by one, until I noticed the problem went away when I disabled the auto-composition-mode. I repeated the experiment disabling only that mode, just to be sure it wasn't because of some other mode that I failed to notice.\n I was wondering if there's something I could do about the performance of this mode. I know I could just disable it globally, but I would like to keep it enabled so the ligatures don't go away. I am using Fira Code.\n I'm using Emacs 29.0.5 (installed through the package emacs-git on AUR), with Harfbuzz.\n All help is very appreciated.

Looking for automated detection tools, I noticed a lack thereof, so I wrote my own (teaching myself elisp in the process). Just stumbled upon it today again and thought it might be of interest in r/emacs. https://github.com/ioah86/repetition_error_finder\n There are likely some bugs, but I hope people will find it useful as I did back then.

Jens Larsen is a very popular jazz guitarist, and pedagogue, he has recorded hundreds of videos available on his website and on Youtube, all with the material to learn or perfect your jazz art on the guitar.

Then I would ‏‏‎ like to create one note per title: - the name of the video becomes the file name - the note only contains a property #+Link: with link. Given that there are more than 800 videos, I would like to automate the process, but I do not know how to proceed. Could you please show me the way, and tell me how to create a script/macro in order to do it?

ChkTeX is good, but sometimes gets things wrong (or makes suggestions which are not appropriate). Recognising this, it also reads a config file, and recognises certain magic comments, which can ignore warnings, or define new warning rules (it's a really amazing tool, check it out if you write TeX!).\n I recently had to write quite a few such magic comments, all in the same format, for ignoring different warnings (the comments are all very similar, just with a different diagnostic number in each). This quickly got boring, and this kind of programmatic text manipulation is exactly what emacs is good for. So I was about to write a set of functions like chktex-ignore-warning-at-pt and chktex-ignore-warning-at-pt-global (for writing to the config file).\n But then I thought that I can't be the first person to want to do this, and stuff like this (interacting with error information in configurable ways) surely can't be restricted to TeX. I thought there might something like a flymake-ignore-error-function variable, which I could set to my function, and there would be lots of flymake infrastructure for this -- but there isn't. Is there any such infrastructure already in emacs for interacting with errors in this way (ignoring, ignoring globally, finding docs etc. Of course, the specifics would have to be implemented in each specific backend)? I'm asking mostly because -- though it would be easy for me to just write my own functions and forget about it -- it seems like a useful general capability and if it doesn't exist yet, maybe it should?

How do I set up init.el so that Emacs will load a theme that is needed first, but then configure properly afterward?\n My example: Starting from scratch, I want to load monokai-theme from melpa and set it:\n (require 'package) (add-to-list 'package-archives '(\"melpa\" . \"https://melpa.org/packages/\") t) (custom-set-variables '(custom-enabled-themes '(monokai)) '(custom-safe-themes '(\"d9646b131c4aa37f01f909fbdd5a9099389518eb68f25277ed19ba99adeb7279\" default)) '(package-selected-packages '(monokai-theme))) (custom-set-faces ) \n If monokai-theme is already downloaded, this works fine. But I want to have emacs download the package automatically if not already present. I use the following block:\n (when (not package-archive-contents) (package-refresh-contents) (package-install-selected-packages) ) \n If I add this below the customize variables, it installs monokai-theme but doesn't load it. I need to restart emacs. If I add this above the customize variables, it doesn't work because package-selected-packages is not loaded yet.\n There's a catch-22 here since each piece needs the other to run first.\n I want to see if I can configure most things in customize, but maybe customize is not right for this job?

With a little recent help from the emacs.stackexchange.com forum participants, I have written up a few Emacs functions to refresh the TD Ameritrade access token for its API, and to submit custom buy/sell orders for equities (although it could be for options trading too, but that's not my cup of tea). At some point in the future, I hope to write Lisp code to stream TDA data using the API and make trading decisions from within Emacs. For the near foreseeable future, however, I'll be relying upon watching the Thinkorswim desktop application to make decisions to buy/sell. Screen real estate is precious, as I need to see the charts, studies, order flow, etc.\n In a nutshell, I only need to tell Emacs: 50.35 RET and then perhaps 15 seconds later 51.25 RET. I have installed KeyboardMaestro, for systemwide keyboard shortcuts offering a variety of options, including executing scripts and so forth.\n I have two (2) Emacs options for order submission, either calling the curl executable, or running url-retrieve-synchronously.\n Any ideas regarding how to do this Emacs order entry quickly and save screen real estate would be greatly appreciated.\n BACKGROUND: There are certain custom orders available through TDA that cannot be executed programmatically from within Thinkorswim, but that should be possible through the API.

Now, there is one piece missing: whenever I push to my git repository, mini-frame-mode opens to prompt me for my git auth data.

Hopefully someone here knows what I am doing wrong.\n The situation: I am in my home directory. I want to add a note to the file ~/work/notes/todo.org.\n What I currently do: I enter \"wo C-j not C-j do <Enter>\", which is basically bash-style completion with C-j instead of the tab key and does not feel very helm-y.\n What the internet tells me to do: I have seen multiple posts of users claiming that I should be able to do this the helm way, e.g. entering \"todo\" first, then remembering the folder and narrowing with \"work\". However, this does not work for me. Even if I remove all my custom init settings, helm-find-files just doesn't do that.\n So what am I doing wrong? Is there a setting I need to enable?\n Other things I am aware of: I know there is also helm-find, but that a) is not fuzzy and b) takes upwards of 60 seconds (!) to find a file in my home directory even if I enter the complete file name, which is clearly not acceptable.There is also helm-projects-find-files, which seems to be for individual software projects and wants me to set up a project tree.\n I am aware that without some form of indexing, finding a file by name might just not be feasible. In that case, it would suffice if I could look for \"notes\", find nothing, then add a space and \"work\" and helm would be smart enough to expand those directories in reverse order. It feels like that is what the helm project page advertises anyway, but it just doesn't happen when I try it.\n Thanks in advance!\n    submitted by    /u/BettaGeorge  \n [link]   [comments]",

But I often find myself frustrated, when changing a buffer takes more effort than you'd think it'd be necessary.\n Then I end up wishing I'd have mixed results, including recent files, input history, maybe project files, and so you could switch between them. ivy has different actions and that's cool, but can it change the data source on the fly?\n    submitted by    /u/CtrlAltCool  \n [link]   [comments]",

Couldn't be happier with my productivity, and the community is great! Tons of tutorials, terrific documentation on almost all the packages I need, and just generally cool, helpful folks. I've followed the community's advice on a whole lot of matters, including keybindings: I read people saying that CUA bindings would interfere with the bindings of many Emacs packages, that made sense to me, so I've learned and ingrained Emacs bindings into my brain. It's great! Until those terrible, dark times when...I need to leave Emacs.\n And discover that Emacs has trashed my muscle memory.\n Whenever I'm in a browser (can't use EWW for everything...right??), I find myself constantly closing tabs when I meant to cut text. I save files when I mean to search. If I use another app for long enough, I eventually do adapt back to CUA, but if I'm rapidly switching back-and-forth between Emacs and anything else, I start making mistakes the moment I relax into autopilot.\n How do y'all handle this? Do you extend Emacs bindings out to the rest of your system (and does that work across platforms)? Do you suck it up and tread carefully outside Emacs?

          "description": "I've long been a bit jealous of Mac users with the Choosy application that prompts the user for which browser they'd like to use every time they open a link. The only open source Linux alternative I've found is Braus, but I struggled to get it working. So, I let the matter drop - it wasn't important enough to me at the time. \n However, it's starting to feel a bit more necessary in Emacs (for me). My entire life is in org files - both personal and professional. I tend to use separate browsers for work and personal use, so I'd love if anyone has clever solutions for this every time I open a link in Emacs. I should add, there are also times when I just want to use eww if I'm just looking up some documentation or static content. \n I'm guessing I could either create some bindings for each browser function or I could manipulate the browser function to actually run a custom elisp function that opens a prompt. I'm just a bit curious if anyone else has felt the same way and if you have any insights you might be willing to share.\n    submitted by    /u/Spinoza-the-Jedi  \n [link]   [comments]",

How would you do it and why?\n  \nWhat writer/programmer friendly layouts you can recommend for inspiration? (40% or 60%, not bigger). I am not interested to learn about letter layouts (qwerty, dvorak, etc) but more about positions / layering of universal keys (delete, backspace, enter, navigation, numbers, etc) I saw miryoku layout, is there smng else to learn from?\n \nAre there other resources you can recommend related to above? \n \n p.s.

It will be called with each potential candidate, in \n the form of either a string or a cons cell whose car is a string, and \n should return non-nil to accept the candidate for completion, nil otherwise.\n  \nTo my understanding, the predicate function needs to take one input argument which is a string or cons cell and when read-buffer is called it will pass every open buffer to the function and will only output those buffers that returned a non-nil value. At least this is what I understand from the docstring. \n However, in practice, how exactly would you call read-buffer with this function as its 4th argument.

Then emacs says \"no definitions found for \"own-variable'\". So it somehow falsely thinks that the final single quote is also part of a symbol name. How do I find what is being used to decide what's the searched symbol name?\n I tried profiling, and debug-on-entry for xref-find-definitions but that seems to be too late. The symbol name is already been made.\n I have an impression that Org mode uses \"pcomplete-completions-at-point\" for this completion but I did not manage to use debug-on-entry for that.

Recently, though, it was persuasively brought to my attention that threads are fundamental to how emails work, so I have introduced some redundancy to my system in order to make the threads work. Now I find myself conflicted about how to resolve these three constraints:\n  \nMake \"sent\" messages visible anywhere, as sometimes I use a different computer at a different location. For this, I've made an email account which has the sole purpose of receiving BCC of all emails I send, and so I subscribe to this SENT inbox to get those messages.\n \nI use the GCC field to store a local version of my email upon sending, which has the advantage of storing the BCC recipients that are omitted from my SENT emails (especially useful when I send an \"undisclosed recipients\" email).\n \nI wish to see things in both my Sent folder and in-thread in my usual inbox location. This is working except that I end up with duplicates of message I've sent. I expect one in my sent folder and another in my inbox, but I am receiving two in my inbox, and (gnus-summary-ignore-duplicates t) doesn't seem to make any noticeable difference, even though one of the messages I end up with in my inbox states \"this is a duplicate\".\n Any improvements or alternatives that meet the needs of synchronizing mail across machines, maintaining a \"sent\" box, and allowing email threading in my inbox?\n \n    submitted by    /u/WorldsEndless  \n [link]   [comments]",

So if i start typing sudo like below, if i am fast enough it will end up ignoring some of my input characters and i end up with suo or sdo sometimes.

This package makes it possible to run, and interact, with shell commands that are run completely detached from Emacs. The name of the package comes from dtach, which is the program that makes this package possible. \n As a user you start shell commands in dedicated sessions using dtache. Here is a list of some of the features that these sessions offer:\n - The user have access to all of the output from a session\n - The user gets a notification when a session has finished\n - Sessions are automatically labeled success or failure\n - Sessions can be started on remote hosts\n - The user can easily rerun a session\n - Sessions can be opened in a compile mode, which effectively makes it mimics M-x compile\n For a more thorough walk through of the package, and how to use it, you can watch this video which I have created: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=if1W58SrClk\n And the package itself you can find at https://gitlab.com/niklaseklund/dtache\n    submitted by    /u/squirelpower  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Please comment your thoughts. Discussion could result in most universally valuable features being implemented in future builds.\nFunction 1 (software-implemented): Optional Visual Hierarchical Display of Saved Searches\nWithout affecting any other functionality, saved searched should be able to be organized into a visual expandable drop-down hierarchy, which again does not affect any other functionality, so does not implement hierarchical structuring into any aspect of the application other than the visual representation of the saved searches in the sidebar. This has obvious beneficial functionality without breaking the app. Feel free to discuss.\nFunction 2 (user-implemented): Bundled Tags\nRight now, if I have tags #apple #banana & #pear, I am able to create a saved search called \"Fruits\" which saves the search query as \"#apple OR #banana OR #pear\". It would be advisable, in some instances, for you as the user to add the category name itself as a tag to the existing search parameters, such that the new search query is now saved as \"#apple OR #banana OR #pear or #fruits\". This allows the saved search to function as a category as well as a tag.\nI call these types of saved searches \"Categories\", and the tags that represent the saved search redundantly \"Category Tags\"\n^^^ Combining the above two functions does not deviate from to the existing principles underpinning the stated purpose of this application, yet it does serve to improve the functionality in terms of specificity (via Tags) and inclusion (via Categories).\nFurther extending these functions, one can imagine a nested list of category tags\nFor examples of infinite-depth, internally-nested collapsible lists - which would all be great functionality add to the \"Saved Searches\" sidebar of the Archive - check out the Workflowy app: https://workflowy.com/\nThe concepts in this post are not property of their author.

          "description": "tl,dr\nI'm looking for an objective(-ish) measure of the one-thought-only measures. Any ideas?\na small background:\nRecently, I have been getting into learning programming, and I stumbled into Uncle Bob's lectures on clean coding (available on youtube, as of now). In there he outlines that there is this principle that a good function, is a function that does one thing, and does it well.\nHowever the one thing was up for interpretation. (for example It used to be a fuction that can fit into a screen. which is not really that well of a measure). He goes on to say that they came up with a good objective measure:  a function that no one can meaningfully extract another function from.\nIt seems like a very well solution for a definition problem.\nThe need for \"one thought\"\nThe same sort of definition problem is also present in the case of a zettel. Although assuming one thought per zettel might not be essential nor desireable for every type of zettelkasten, it can be useful for some, in order to make a synthesis of an unstructured body of knowledge and emerge with a structure.\nFor example, I might be trying to understand a school of though, this school may be offering argument A as a an argument for their belief.  However, argument A is made up of 5 parts, each part can be argued against, in seperate ways, and the arguments against may be challenged in different ways and so on. One might try to gather arguements againts and try to categorize them, summerize them, and essentially refactor them.  In this situation, if each zettel only contain one and only one thought, it would be much more of an elegant workflow to put them against each other.\nThe need for objectivity\nAn objective measure, can be extremely useful, in order to maintain the flow, and unload a cognitive load of \"is it too big or too small?\" \nThe matter\nWhat are your thoughts on this matter?",

          "description": "I'm a fan of Cal Newport's work. He also seems to frequently produce high quality work (multiple best-selling books, consistent blog posts, articles for good publications, and a large number of academic papers).\nIn a recent podcast episode, Cal Newport made a distinction between proactive and reactive methods of information management.\nProactive information management attempts to takes information when first encountered and put it into some sort of knowledge management system (such as a Zettelkasten), maybe even before there is a specific \"need\" for it.  This information can then be retrieved at a later date, and new potentially novel connections can form between the information in the system.\nHe states his method of working is more reactive and project based, citing the overhead of inputting information to and maintaining such systems.\nReactive information management seems to be more on-demand and project based. When you are working on a particular project, you go out and find sources relevant to that article.\nHe also mentioned that over time (if you write enough) you will have been exposed to a lot of interesting ideas, and often when working on a project, a few potential starting points will come to mind which then you can follow to more relevant citations.\nhttps://overcast.fm/+b1V0JshqM/34:55\nOne question when using a reactive project based method is what projects to work on? This is where I can see the value of novel connections in a Zetellkasten in generating ideas.\nI'm curious what peoples' thoughts on this are?",

          "description": "I've recently become involved in some qualitative research that involves using the program NVivo to analyse interview transcripts. Basically, the interview transcript is imported into NVivo, then you go read each sentence and attached thematic tag(s).\nI think this would be an interesting way to organise research and notes, with the understanding that the tagging system would evolve over time.\nFor example,\nIf you are working on a specific article, you could browse through previous semi-related tags and tag sentences that might be relevant to that article.\nOr if you are working on a longer project, tags could start general but then over time be refined and become more specific as you work out the structure of the project.\nThe only way I can think to implement something like this in existing note taking apps is to have one sentence per note, then as many required tags per note, but this seems unmanageable.\nI'm curious what other think of this idea?",

But sometimes I want a visual of my Zettelkasten and some added functionality to interact with my notes. This is where Obsidian comes in. Not to mention the mobile app as well on iOS makes entering things quickly, on the go, a breeze.\nDoes anyone else use these two brilliant applications in their workflow?

I find 220104-1342 to be easier to grasp (as well as shorter). There are probably almost as many preferences for how to format an ID as there are users. It seems to me that a default ID option field,  perhaps using date tokens, would fit quite naturally into Advanced Prefs, and could make a lot of users happy.",

Looking at ideas for creating a tool for thinking, I came up with a tool that prompts me to refine the edits to zettel titles and 'summary relevance.'\nThis 'tool for thinking' results from a python program tied to Keyboard Maestro that prompts me to review titles and summaries of the last ten days of newly created zettel. As an anchor, it is tied to my practice of morning journaling. It reminds me and makes it convenient to examine each zettel title and the one-sentence 'relevance' statement to see if it makes sense and stands up to scrutiny. This is added to the bottom of that template. (pictured below) Automatic, easy peasy, the cognitive load of the initiating behavior habit off-loaded to the computer. This is not an excuse for not editing the body of each zettel. A new zettel will be on the list for ten days. That means ten opportunities for giving the zettel some love.\nI'm unsettled on the format. In its current form it is a bit hard to read. I will make changes for readability.\nIf you're interested in how this is done, have questions about my use-case, or just want to chat let me know.\nBelow are pictured titles and a one-sentence summary/meaning of the zettel I'm working on. These are the ideas I'm currently wrestling with. They represent a ten-day window of new zettel.\nThis is generated with nothing held back. I would love to talk to you about anything on this list. If any of this is of interest to you, please start a thread here, DM me, or get in touch via email.",

It has the following characteristics:\nNotes are identified by unique, sequential numbers (0001, 0002 etc.).\nNotes may be linked using the wikilink syntax ([[0001]]).\nNotes may have \"parent\" and \"descendant\" notes; they may also be linked to project notes.\nBibliographical annotation is supported with BibTeX references.\nNotes may have tags (identified by #hashtags).\nNotes have a YAML(ish) frontmatter to keep metadata and are (preferably, but not necessarily) written in Markdown.\nThe aim of this project is to develop features to ease the creation, navigation and linking of notes in one or multiple note repositories.\nA sidebar functionality makes the minor-mode particularly useful for working with structure notes:\n\nOther functionalities include: creating descendant notes, integration with helm, helm-ag and helm-bibtex; \"killing\" and \"yanking\" to notes, searching for tags and backlinks; navigation commands for visiting the parent, following links.\nSome details of the implementation might be too personal, but the code may at least be useful as a starting point. I'm calling it a phi minor mode because this is how I named my system long ago.\nMore information and a setup guide are available on the GitHub project documentation.\nMerry Christmas! 🎄",
