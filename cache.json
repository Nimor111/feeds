This is just a nice to have, but at least some fading-in/out would be great.\n 3) Assuming that I only develop in the frontend part of the obelisk project, then the dynamic stuff of the web app will happen in the clients' browser, resulting in a very low server load, right?\n  \nEdit 1: https://buildmedia.readthedocs.org/media/pdf/reflex-frp/latest/reflex-frp.pdf#section.2.1 is a great resource for how to build a reflex app!\n    submitted by    /u/WieseligerWurmWerfer  \n [link]   [comments]",

There are too many, and folks who know where they are get burned out reposting them. There have been many attempts to gather them, https://haskell.org/documentation being the most obvious, but none of them have fully succeeded. We could really do with some more systematic, scalable (crowd-sourced, lightweight) approach.\n  \nThen I experimented and set up https://haskell-links.org . This is version 1, providing:\n  \nA searchable read-only view of the Haskell links collected with lambdabot, the popular #haskell IRC bot.\n \nA redirector/link shortener/memory aid, for jumping to any of these links via their short ID. Eg: \n https://haskell-links.org/doc https://haskell-links.org/books https://haskell-links.org/ghc-guide\n \nCollected links to other Haskell search tools, making this a fast way to get to anywhere in Haskelldom.\n \n After contemplation and discussion on #haskell, I believe version 2 should allow web editing and use its own database. But I wanted to share this one as it's a nice simple setup. I hope you might find useful ! Help is welcome, see README.\n Best, -Simon\n    submitted by    /u/simonmic  \n [link]   [comments]",

As a step I tried to follow along with the official tutorial for client side (in Go, as my clients will be that - though it doesn't matter) and try matching server side with Haskell. So, for now I have this proto file (it might be important that eventually, I will need to use proto3):\n // The greeting service definition. service Greeter { // Sends a greeting rpc SayHello (HelloRequest) returns (HelloReply) {} } // The request message containing the user's name. message HelloRequest { string name = 1; } // The response message containing the greetings message HelloReply { string message = 1; } \n Using proto-lens I can generate nice lenses for HelloRequest and HelloReply by following this. However, it is not useful much. I would have to write a lot of boiler-plate for implementing SayHello.\n Therefore, my next best bet was proto3-suite (is that the right one?) Generating the code works nicely:\n stack exec -- compile-proto-file --proto proto/helloworld.proto --out lib \n Which will give me a very promising Proto.Helloworld with data Greeter = ..., but I simply cannot use it (with stack)..\n It seems that that repo is maybe outdated as the resolver is fairly old, and regardless there are always version conflicts.\n What is the way to go for gRPC with Haskell nowadays?

          "description": "Greetings all! I am brand new to this subReddit, not to mention Reddit in general. If anyone here has the time and the will to lend an ear (or an eye) to my plight and provide me with some much-needed advice, I'd be mostly greatly appreciative:\n ​\n As the title says, I am coming up to the final segments of HPFFP (currently on parser combinators/monad transformers), and I am trying to discern the path forward after finishing this book. \n Now, here's the caveat: I am NOT a career software developer. This has actually been my first real deep dive into computer programming in general (*prior to getting into Haskell, I had finished the HTML/CSS/Javascript certifications on FreeCodeCamp, but Haskell blossomed into a total love affair beyond my control). \n So, most advice I see online about what to do after finishing HPFFP could be more-or-less distilled down to \"just get your hands dirty writing code in Haskell.\" But, I feel like the implicit assumption there is that the person receiving the advice already has a decent amount of experience writing computer programs. As for myself, I really have no clue about where to go next; I really enjoyed learning about how all of the concepts from category theory map onto the language (e.g. writing Monoid/Functor/Applicative/Monad instances for custom datatypes and whatnot), but at this point, it's really just pure intellectual enjoyment - like solving a challenging puzzle or something like that. \n It occurred to me that the natural thing to do would be to try to use Haskell for web development, and I have been eyeballing the Yesod book published by O'Reilly. But, would a book like that already assume that I've done backend development in another language before? If so, are there better resources available in this particular domain? Or, am I just not really ready to start actually using Haskell to accomplish something practical yet?\n    submitted by    /u/Beneficial_Shirt_781  \n [link]   [comments]",

For example:\n moveSlowly :: Method -> IO () moveSlowly (Move) = putStrLn \"Slowly moving forward...\" moveSlowly m = perform m \n This pattern is known as the Decorator Pattern in OOP languages.\n Is there a way for me to generalize this behavior and possibly even compose these \"overriding\" functions? For example, let's say I have another function:\n attackWithAxe :: Method -> IO () attackWithAxe (Attack) = putStrLn \"Swinging axe...\" attackWithAxe m = perform m \n Ideally I would be able to \"compose\" these 3 functions using something like\n  moveSlowly <|> attackWithAxe <|> perform \n preferring the first match found from left to right.\n  \nOne possibility is to create a record of functions where each field corresponds with one constructor. I turn perform into a record with the default implementation and then I can override each behavior at will using a record update. When I actually want to perform an action just I extract the function from the final record.\n This kind of works, but implies code duplication (ADT constructors = Record labels) and I'm not sure how to \"compose\" from left to right.\n  \nThanks to @MorrowM_ for the recommended design.

Is it accurate to view functors as much relating to the map function as it is to relate it to the idea of a map such as a hash map? Functors are almost always explained and shown examples with the map function because obviously a functor defines it's mappable behavior when the map function is applied to it. But my understanding of functors as a type where when a function is applied to it, it morphs the underlying data and returns a functor of the same type seems to me like a map structure where the keys are the f a and the f b are the values.

I tried cacheing it according to advice I found here, which helps with just a plain stack build step, but Stack still seems to insist on rebuilding all the test dependencies every time the action is run.\n \nstack test tries to rebuild the whole project after I run stack build, eating into local development speed. This is an open issue. The suggested workaround of building with --test --no-run-tests still incurs noticeable build time overhead because it also rebuilds all the test suites.\n \n I'm wondering if folks here have suggestions for best practices for setting up Stack projects, with respect to improving build times for both CI and local testing? Or if people could point me to well-established Haskell projects managed with Stack, that I could look to as examples? (A lot of the bigger projects I've looked at seem to either use just Cabal, or use Stack + Nix.)\n    submitted by    /u/jwongsquared  \n [link]   [comments]",

My parse function takes that list of Tokens and does the parsing using mainly pattern matching returning a parse tree and the tokens it could not parse.\n  data Token = Lambda | Dot | LParen | RParen | Ident String deriving Show \n So now, I realized the error messages I can generate are terrible because while I have the tokens where the problems begin, I have no idea where in the source file the tokens come from. The way I would solve this in an OO language is that I would add some fields to Token listing things like source file, column and line.\n So I tried something like:\n  data Position = Pos String Int Int \n and then\n  data Token = Lambda Position | Dot Position | LParen Position | RParen Position | Ident String Position deriving Show \n But this is just awful. Now, my parse function is broken because all my pattern matches are wrong. What's the \"right\" way to do this?

I just wanted to understand if this is a general trend in the industry that I must get used to. I get how scala can be smarter and more mathy etc. which is cool but what's with attitude ? Now with python becoming more and more popular, I have a hard time understanding where these people are‍ coming from... just a thought nothing personal\n    submitted by    /u/gloriagaseous  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Disclaimer: I'm a Java guy, so maybe there is an explanation that's trivial in /r/scala, but out of my reach.\n There used to be a couple of hacks to create green threads in JVM, like Quasar. As far as I know, implementing green threads for Java today is made by changing the JVM. Meanwhile, in Scala and before Project Loom:\n from Cats Effects: Concurrency in IO is facilitated by fibers, which are lightweight, interruptible threads that are managed completely by the runtime.\n from ZIO: Powered by highly-scalable, non-blocking fibers that never waste or leak resources\n Well... how? JVM threads are backed by OS threads. Is the Scala compiler inserting context switch here and there in Cats/Monix code? do Scala language construct allow to create green-threads? Kotlin gets coroutines in the compiler, but Cats/Monix are libraries, not compilers. Or Scala libraries can alter the way the compiler work?\n I'm curious...\n    submitted by    /u/pgris  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm a bit FP maniac and cannot imagine myself getting back to JavaScript or TypeScript. I'm super rusty with everything frontend-related, but was considering three options:\n  \nElm - I like the simplicity a lot; have some concerns about its future\n ReScript - kind of Scala's uncanny valley: on one hand semantics are very close, on the other it's just not it, having hard times to get used to syntax; among all options seems to be the most future-proof\n Scala.js - obviously the comfort zone, but no idea if it's a viable option for the frontend\n  \nMy requirements are:\n  \nI have very limited resources - so don't have time to write own libs (perhaps just bindings), which means I really want to use all JS libs possible (React, sliders, widgets etc). This is where I have the most concerns about Scala.js (scalajs-react looks great, but seems to be the only big thing ported properly) and most sympathy for ReScript\n It has to be an Electron app. Seems to be possible with all options, but wanted to raise since it means the bundle-size doesn't matter (although performance does!)\n  \nSo, my question - is it worth to try out Scala.js (with scalajs-react, I think) or go with more conventional options? With scalajs-react is it possible to integrate existing React UI components?\n    submitted by    /u/MysteriousGenius  \n [link]   [comments]",

Some actions run in parallel, some serially.\n Measure certain things\n  \nI have a decent mental map of how to do everything but #3.

          "description": "I made a post about this over a year ago and there were a few people interested, but nobody followed through and contributed to the project so I'm back again to find fresh faces that might be interested :)\n This is for a game called PlanetSide 1 which has officially shut down, but is now a community made emulator being written in Scala. This game is an MMOFPS and is being built to work with the retail client of the game with no access to the original source code. It's amazing how much the small group of devs have done in their free time to get the game to where it is now, but there are some elusive bugs that have been problematic (plus a number of features to still implement). We'd love for it to be an MMO again, but more dev support seems to be the only way to make that a possibility with limited time of the 2-3 devs.\n Here's where you could come in. The repo is here: https://github.com/psforever/PSF-LoginServer I'm not one of the devs working on the server code due to lacking those skills, but I am involved in the team and help where I can and can get anyone in touch with the right people to get plugged in and up to speed. The community Discord is also here: https://discord.gg/0nRe5TNbTYoUruA4\n How to make it sound more enticing... Do you want 100s or 1000s of people thanking you for your amazing dev skills to make this once flourishing game be populated again with players from around the globe? Do you want to see your code come alive and potentially break the Guinness World record for the largest FPS battle (current record is the game's sequel PlanetSide 2 at 1158 players)? Do you want to challenge yourself and put one more feather in your cap and resume that will definitely get you that next 6 figure gig?

And so on..\n \nI would like to have a \"rule\" or mechanism of some sort that would enforce compile time that for each companion object of these classes need to declare a corresponding val for each of it's companion class constructor parameters. \n \nLet's say I have a class ParamRules(rule1: String, rule2: String)\n \nNaive idea in my head looks like that:\n \n case class Foo(a: String, b:String)\n object Foo extends MagicMechanism(Foo) ( val a_rules = ParamRules(...) val b_rules = ParamRules(...) )\n And with that compiler is satisfied.\n If the object Foo doesn't implement a \"rule\" for one of there constructor params it fails compilation.\n  \nIt doesn't have to look like that it could be entirely different I just want to dynamically enforce this interface user to provide rule for each of the params in the class. \n  \nLet me know if I'm day dreaming, over engineering or simply having a stroke and if you need any more explanation.\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/yodlowy  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm currently a Scala data engineer located in East Asia, using Spark as ETL tool in my daily work.\n For some reasons, I want to immigrate to European or North American countries and settle down. \n I'd like to ask, what is the minimum requirements for a Scala Data engineer to pass interview for companies like FAANG?\n Should I start practicing Leetcode now? Is it possible that the algorithm questions in the interview would be easier for data engineers? How far do a data engineer have to brush up his/her Leetcode level to find a job overseas. \n I'm asking these questions, because in my native country, Spark ETL engineers seldom write algorithm code in an interview while they are still able to have the same salary level with other kind of engineers such as backend engineers.\n    submitted by    /u/AloneObligation3626  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hey all, I've been looking for a way to use org-gcal with multiple files. So org-gcal takes org-mode files and syncs scheduled items with your google calendar. But the problems is that it syncs only between 1 file and 1 google account. I have one google account but I scatter my todos inside different files for different projects. What do you think would work the best?\n My current thought is I should create a single file that maybe gets updated every time I update a scheduled item, and sync that single file with my calendar.\n One crux of this solution might be how to copy the todo items and connect back to its source. I’m using org-roam so theoretically I can make store an id to point to the original item without much overhead? \n Do you see any problems with this approach? Have you done something similar? How would you do something like this? Many thanks.\n    submitted by    /u/XtremePocket  \n [link]   [comments]",

Can anyone suggest a tutorial that broadly goes over how they structure their “life” (multiple types of todos. Calendar, goals, etc…) in org mode files?\n I’m also a little unclear and how to do something distributed without org mode. Do I manually have to sync files over GitHub?

When I add the Lisp code under section 9.1 \"Clock setup\", then I go to clock in a task with \"C-c C-x C-i\", I receive the following message in the echo area:\n Symbol’s function definition is void: bh/is-task-p\n Anyways, I am just curious: does anybody know of any documents similar to this one that are more up to date?

I normally set my org-refile-targets as such:\n (setq org-refile-targets '((\"~/Dropbox/org/work.org\" :maxlevel . 2))) \n This works fine. So I tried to do the same in my org-capture templates. Here’s an example:\n (\"n\" \"CPB Note\" entry (file+headline \"~/Dropbox/org/cpb.org\" \"Refile\") \"** Note: %? @ %U\" :empty-lines 0 :refile-targets '(((\"~/Dropbox/org/work.org\" :maxlevel . 2)))) \n With this I get the error, “org-refile-get-location: Wrong type argument: listp, quote”.

I have clock-in enabled in my template, but after entering all the data and C-c C-c, I get this:\n ** Test :2022:2022_04:MORE:TAGS: :LOGBOOK: :END: \n In other words, the CLOCK: line is missing from :LOGBOOK:\n It used to be:\n ** Test :2022:2022_04:MORE:TAGS: :LOGBOOK: CLOCK: [2022-04-28 Thu 12:25]-- :END: \n or something like that (can't reproduce), but the CLOCK line was added with the current time as the start time. Any ideas on what might be wrong? The template is defined as:\n (\"h\" \"Hours\" entry (file+headline \"~/Data/hours/log.org\" \"Hours 2022\") \"* %? :%<%Y>:%<%Y_%m>:%^g\\n\" :clock-in t :clock-keep t :empty-lines-after 1) \n And yeah, no clock has been started. Pressing C-c C-x C-o tells me so...\n Another small but quite annoying change is that on starting the capture I get a prompt to select tags. It used to be that pressing TAB after some characters would autocomplete the TAG and add a trailing colon (:) which made it possible to immediately select another TAG. It now only completes the TAG, so I need another action to start typing the start of the next TAG which is annoying.

          "description": "Most of us are familiar with tree-style thinking that org-mode seamlessly enables, where a parent node has an infinite amount of tree children. From a gardening perspective this works great if you're not breeding and instead just saving seed, as you can structure the data as follows, where each subheading is a genetic descendant of the parent:\n ​\n ** San Marzano Tomato\n :PROPERTIES:\n :WHATEVER: WHATEVER\n :END:\n *** Plant 1\n :ID: sjkjlfkjh\n :YIELD: Xlbs\n [inline image]\n notes\n *** Plant 2\n :ID: oijiohiuhi\n :YIELD: Ylbs\n [inline image]\n notes\n **** Plant 2, Gen 1\n etc\n ​\n So I use emacs and org-mode for everything (of course), and being able to snap pics and add properties on the fly would be AMAZING for organizing anything cultivation related with minimal friction/overhead. Where organization and documentation tends to be most important is in breeding, and I'm unsure how I'd represent say a San Marzano and Roma cross elegantly. Of course I could create a new tree for each cross, but I recall reading org having some functionality (probably using tags and unique ID's) to make this seamless or somehow superior, I believe it was presented as a sort of directed acyclic graph using tags. Using org-mode at all for this would be great since HTML exports would be a freebie.\n ​\n This isn't complicated, but I'm just wondering how you might organize something like this so I don't have an 'a-ha' moment later and decide to restructure everything (but who am I kidding.. that's half the fun). I'm sort of thinking a tree per cross may end up best, since it'll work most naturally with org-mode, and the top level node can include inline images of each parent in the cross, and properties like :ID-FATHER:, :ID-MOTHER: etc.\n    submitted by    /u/AphexPin  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I have been using org-noter to read epubs in org-mode, which works fine until recently. When it is a pdf file, everything still works as before. However, when it comes to an epub file, org-noter will not work. I'm not sure why this happened but didn't want to bother to dig into this issue because it is not the first time this package breaks down on me. Consequently, I need to think of a different way to read epubs and take notes in org-mode. Since I already use calibre to manage my ebooks, my new workflow simply combines using calibre links and xdg-open.\n The native ebook viewer in calibre allows us to export links to specific locations in the book. The link looks like \"calibre://view-book/someid/somefomat?open_at=somelocation\". Using xdg-open with this link opens the specified book at the exact location. The default viewer enables highlights and other annotation methods, which is also a plus. So all I need to do is to add a new link parameter for \"calibre\" in org mode and define a follow method. Below is a snippet.\n  \n(org-link-set-parameters \n \"calibre\" \n :follow 'my/calibre-follow \n ) \n (defun my/calibre-follow (path) \n (call-process \"xdg-open\" nil 0 nil (concat \"calibre:\" path)))\n  \nIt is a very simple implementation but it does the job. If you have a similar workflow of reading ebooks and taking notes, maybe this can help. Feel free to add anything. I welcome any suggestions.\n    submitted by    /u/gooooolden  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "When I'm editing an Org file using Doom Emacs in insert mode and my cursor is on the line of a heading, the Tab key seems to demote the heading while Shift-Tab seems to promote the heading. On the other hand, in my personal config the Tab key in insert mode on a heading line seems to have behavior that is context dependent. For instance, if I have a single heading and nothing else in my org document the tab key seems to do nothing in insert mode. On the other hand, if I have multiple headings the tab key seems to cycle through several different heading levels, from one deeper than my previous deepest level, all the way up to the outermost level.\n In both my personal config and my Doom config, tab seems to be bound to org-cycle in insert mode. The values for the variables org-cycle-level-after-item/entry-creation and org-cycle-emulate-tab are identical for both my personal session and my doom session. I don't really understand how to dig deeper into what might be causing this discrepancy in behavior between the two different sessions of Emacs. I really like Doom's tab behavior, and would like to replicate it in my personal config. If anyone has any ideas on how I should go about understanding this better and achieving my desired config I'd appreciate it.\n    submitted by    /u/dargscisyhp  \n [link]   [comments]",

This works well, but then I have many-other-vars in the closure resulting in unnecessary saving of values and the previously small lambda function becomes quite cumbersome to view in subsequent inspections.\n I then resort to the following solution: ``` (defun make-hook (var) (lambda nil (do-something var)))\n (let ((var value) (many-other-vars other-long-value)) (add-hook 'mode-hook (make-hook var))) ```\n which then has the desired effect of having only the variable var in the closure. But this is counterproductive as now I have to define a function for each lambda I need (defeating the goal of creating anonymous functions on the fly).\n Is there a way to limit the closure to specific variables? Other languages have such features (like C++'s lambda functions) but I can't seem to replicate it in emacs-lisp.

I wrote a new major mode jsonian-mode which parses only as necessary and minimizes the regex usage for syntax highlighting. This means that navigating very large files is faster. The json-snatcher (jsonian-path) function does not blow its stack on large files. It also includes a pretty nice utility for editing multi-line JSON strings (jsonian-edit-string).\n Since I use this regularly for work, and am maintaining it anyway, I figured other people might find it useful as well. Let me know if you find this useful. If you end up using jsonian-mode and find something wrong, please file an issue.\n    submitted by    /u/iwahbe  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Until now I have written most of my Org and Markdown files with auto-fill-mode, never exceeding more than 80 characters per column. However, I've increasingly noticed many counterexamples, where each paragraph was a single long line of text. Some platforms like GitHub seem to encourage this practice, as newlines in comments are treated as newlines in the rendered page, contrary to vanilla Markdown.\n There seem to be some advantages to this approach. For example, writing prose with mixed-pitch-mode makes a lot more sense if lines are arbitrarily long, and I find it a lot more pleasant. But if I'm sharing a document with someone else, I wonder if generally they'd be annoyed at receiving a document without wrapping that requires them to enable visual-fill-column-mode and visual-line-mode, disable hl-line-mode, etc. I know I was at first before I discovered how to make the experience feel like I was using auto-fill-mode instead.\n I'm interested to hear /r/emacs 's thoughts on this!\n    submitted by    /u/elizadev  \n [link]   [comments]",

Hydra was great, but being able to toggle switches on and off quickly was something I always wanted to be able to do, and Transient makes it a lot easier--indeed, that seems to be its raison d'etre. \n I'm going through both the very dry and obtuse manual, but also the excellent writeups posted here and on github. However, I still have two questions that don't seem to have answers.\n  \nIs there any way to display information without providing a way to act on it? One of the things about hydra was it was possible to display the state of variables (and arbitrary text) as part of the formatting. I used this to give me information on the context I was operating in, like what the root directory was, or what the peforce root was. I don't actually want to change those values, I just need to know them. What I've done in the interim is define an empty interactive function. I still get the key as a weird little prefix, but my data is displayed.\n I'm making extensive use of transient-define-suffix that takes an argument and completes from a list. The description is a lambda that reads and propertizes the saved variable (shamelessly stolen and repurposed from /u/psionikus' examples posted here). However, when I set them, the display doesn't update. I found the undocumented function (so many undocumented things!) (transient--redisplay) but it feels like I'm doing something wrong if I have to put it at the end of every one of my suffixes.\n  \nI appreciate that the documentation is getting better over time, but I still find it frustrating that I can't, say, find a list of all the keyword-value pairs. They're scattered throughout the docs, so if you don't know or don't remember what you're looking for, it's nearly impossible to find.\n That said, I'm making progress. The best way to do it seems just to do it, and hack around until you find a solution.\n    submitted by    /u/vjgoh  \n [link]   [comments]",

Surely there's just a Option mode or something for this. Basically I'd like to denote a section of an org document as a code-block for formatting. Just like Markdown and ``` or Reddit with four spaces on the side.\n Is there anyway to mark a section that should be rendered as a fixed-width font when exporting?

I know how to make an elisp macro to find a specific file or to find one from a variable, but I was wondering if there's a way to incorporate patterns and interactive prompts like %^{PROMPT} into find-file.\n For my work I have to look at a variety of a given documents in multiple languages/editions, which are broken down into sub-books and chapters. For example, reading the Iliad in both Greek and English. However, this results in directories with hundreds of files each, sometimes more, and trying to find the same chapter in a different edition is a pain. For sake of example, let's use the Bible.\n All files have been systematically assigned a file name that follows the same exact pattern. Note: Edition is used as both the subdirectory and the first part of the filename.\n ./(Edition)/(Edition)_(Book_ID)_(Chapter)_read.txt \n Let's say I'm reading Genesis Chapter 1 in Greek. It's broken down by chapter at the following directory:\n ./grcbrent/grcbrent_002_GEN_01_read.txt ./grcbrent/grcbrent_002_GEN_02_read.txt ./grcbrent/grcbrent_003_EXO_01_read.txt \n But, now I want to compare it with Genesis Chapter 1 in Latin:\n ./latVUC/latVUC_002_GEN_01_read.txt \n So, is there an easy way to program a function that, while viewing ./grcbrent/grcbrent_002_GEN_01_read.txt, I don't know, reads buffer-file-name, replaces both the directory name and the first part of the filename until the first underscore with \"%^{Edition}\"(\"./%^{Edition}/%^{Edition}_002_GEN_01_read.txt\") to produce a minibuffer like the following:\n Edition: \n and after typing latVUC [RET] does (find-file \"./latVUC/latVUC_002_GEN_01_read.txt\") ?\n TLDR\n I want to be able to jump from version a of a file to version b, i.e. (./a/a_x_y.txt to ./b/b_x_y.txt) where b is typed in the minibuffer.\n I appreciate any help in figuring this out.

In the following video I show how to create a project, how to call the GitHub API, parse JSON, and create a binary to use our app from the terminal. I do this from Emacs and SLIME, the IDE for CL. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAtwcBh1QLg \n If you wrote some Elisp, you will notice differences. For example, the REPL is different, more featureful than IELM, that I don't use that much for Elisp. We have an interactive debugger with restarts (actions we can choose, in the video I go to the source file, I re-compile the function, I come back to the debugger and I choose \"retry\", and the call passes). As a developer we can set our own restarts, of course.\n Some other things I do are: co…",

I'm wondering if there are commands - built-in or from an external package - that would allow me to narrow the buffer to a rectangle, or otherwise edit text within the rectangle?\n My immediate use case is text that's effectively a table, like Hydra's \"awesome docstring\". Taking the first example from the repo README:\n \" ^Mark^ ^Unmark^ ^Actions^ ^Search ^^^^^^^^----------------------------------------------------------------- _m_: mark _u_: unmark _x_: execute _R_: re-isearch _s_: save _U_: unmark up _b_: bury _I_: isearch _d_: delete ^ ^ _g_: refresh _O_: multi-occur _D_: delete up ^ ^ _T_: files only: % -28`Buffer-menu-files-only _~_: modified \" \n Say I want to move the save command to be before delete, and I also want to remove mark command. Currently, I have to deal with manually un-reordering and realigning all the other entries to the right of the text I want to manipulate. A better workflow I imagine would be to narrow editing to a rectangle covering the first column of the Hydra docstring, and do my manipulation in that scope, without worrying about text around it.

The code is amply commented, and package configurations are as decoupled as possile. Perfect to learn how to write elisp and how to configure some of the more commonly-used packages.\n The system is pre-configured for python and Julia programming only.\n The config uses a customised leuven theme and embraces a colourful aesthetic.\n  \nGive it a go!

          "description": "Hiya!\n I've been using doom emacs for a while now and have been mostly happy with it. I've got a bit of spare time now, and have been trying to put together an emacs config from scratch. Not sure if I'm ultimately going to stick with this config or go back to doom for regular work, but I figure it'll at least be a good learning experience.\n Anyways, I've run into some baffling behavior with the general package for key binding. Specifically, once I set a new leader key, it acts in a \"sticky\" manner eternally. So if I rebind C-SPC as a leader and \"C-SPC h\" to help-command, it works in that \"C-SPC h\" works like \"C-h\". However, any time I use this, it disables the \"h\" key for the rest of the session. Whenever I type \"h\" alone, it behaves as though I pressed \"C-SPC h\". Same with spacebar. In a fresh session, both keys will work normally until I use them once with the leader. After that, the keys are broken until I restart emacs.\n Does anyone have any idea why this is happening and what should be done to correct it? Here's the relevant part of my init.el. Also, please ignore the specific rebindings; this is just an experiment to see what can be done with general and to figure out how it works.\n  (global-unset-key (kbd \"C-SPC\")) (use-package general :config (general-create-definer krm/global-leader :global-prefix \"C-SPC\") (krm/global-leader \"h\" 'help-command \"SPC\" 'set-mark-command)) \n    submitted by    /u/eatabagofbooger  \n [link]   [comments]",

Thank you very much to everyone who's filed issues against the GitHub repository (or reached out via email). It's wonderful to know that folks appreciate this effort, and I love being able to give something back to the community.\n Now: on to the good stuff!\n Packages are available for 18.04 LTS (\"bionic\"), 20.04 LTS (\"focal\"), 21.10 (\"impish\"), and 22.04 LTS (\"jammy\").\n Emacs 28 deprecates Xft and encourages using Cairo/HarfBuzz for font rendering; this build configuration is the one that my Emacs 27 packages were already using, so there should not be any changes there.\n The big new feature in Emacs 28 is native compilation, and as you might expect, these packages enable that feature. The only exceptions are the packages for 18.04 LTS (\"bionic\"); libgccjit packages aren't available for the version of GCC that ships with 18.04 LTS.\n The only packaging-related update I have to share is that the master branch of the packaging repository now has a README with release notes. I'm going to try to move more notes about the packaging process there over time.\n Enjoy, and please let me know if you have any trouble.\n    submitted by    /u/lunarsunrise  \n [link]   [comments]",

Hence, I set out and add some git stashing to my pre-commit hook to fix that myself.\n This is what I ended up with after some google-fu:\n ```sh\n #!/bin/sh # First, stash index and work dir, keeping only the # to-be-committed changes in the working directory. old_stash=$(git rev-parse -q --verify refs/stash) git stash push -q --keep-index --include-untracked new_stash=$(git rev-parse -q --verify refs/stash) # If there were no changes (e.g., `--amend` or `--allow-empty`) # then nothing was stashed, and we should skip everything, # including the tests themselves. (Presumably the tests passed # on the previous commit, so there is no need to re-run them.) if [ \"$old_stash\" = \"$new_stash\" ]; then echo \"pre-commit script: no changes to test\" exit 0 fi # Run lints/checks/tests/... script/check st=$? echo \"got status $st\" # Restore changes git reset --hard -q git stash pop --index -q # Exit with status from test-run: nonzero prevents commit exit $st \n ```\n Now, this works fine when I use it from the git-command line, however, I run into trouble when I commit via magit. It fails with the following error:\n ```\n error: pathspec ':/' did not match any file(s) known to git < normal testing output> error: could not restore untracked files from stash The stash entry is kept in case you need it again. \n ```\n Anyone have any idea what is causing the difference between git-cli and magit here?\n    submitted by    /u/Foo-jin  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I've recently needed to make a minibuffer completion with annotations. The manual says you need to set completion-extra-properties, and I was able to make annotations, my :annotation-function looks something like this:\n (defun my-annotation-fn (s) (let-alist (cdr (assoc s minibuffer-completion-table)) (concat \" \" .version \" \" .description))) \n Now, this works, but the annotations do not show up aligned (because every column in each row is delimited by fixed number of spaces), and that doesn't look very clean.\n Of course, it is possible to calculate the exact number of required spaces for every column in each row, even though it would slightly sophisticate the annotation-function.\n Another alternative (I think) is to extend the prompt for Marginalia and let it do its magic. But then it would only work for those who use Marginalia package. \n So my question is, is there a convention or a simpler method of aligning the annotations?\n    submitted by    /u/ilemming  \n [link]   [comments]",

I believe that dropping it will result in a far more number of potential people and human work for Emacs' development.\n Personally, although I have already signed it as student, I'm not so sure in the future when being employed cause there's a term: contact us when you change your employer.\n Side note: I signed it to propose apply-right-partially, the function was rejected in favor of explicit lambdas. A bit sad at first, then I realized its usage may lead to breakages later: what about when the applied FUN's parameters have optional arguments added to the right?

So it does slow down the Emacs startup time. But the package is not activated, i.e it's key bindinds are not yet available.\n Eg.

Typically I will google what I am trying to do, come across some posts on reddit or stackoverflow, find some sample code (ie. This is the function I wrote and bound to this key to do x and y), and incorporate that into my own emacs config. \n Here's a simple example, say I want to figure out how to copy the full path of the current filename into the buffer so I can later make a reference to it in my org notes. If I google that, I'll see a dozen different ways to do this and they mostly all work great, but in the spirit of doing everything inside emacs I can't help but wonder... there must be a better way? I feel like there must be some repository of very useful and common elisp code \"snippets\" where I could just search for \"get current filename\" and be presented with elisp code I can immediately use, and I feel like that could all be done directly inside my current document and just inserted as a code snippet!?

I mean, honest question - who cares? No, really, I'm curious; perhaps there's an answer I'm just not aware of. How often do you use the cal, calc, and email apps in emacs in your workflow.\n Then as far as more killer emacs apps like Magit, to borrow a phrase, \"there's an app: plugin for that\" in neovim: https://github.com/TimUntersberger/neogit\n What functionality does emacs offer that simply can't be implemented as a neovim plugin?

          "description": "I've read the topic about Emacs being a user friendly and how it's userbase is low compared to vim (3% to 25%). I know Emacs is a powrful tool, I use it org on my phone, dired, its shell, vterm, etc. But, I got to this point because when I, 6 years ago, migrated from Windows, wanted to have all my tools to be open-source. To get the basic functionality on Emacs, like select, copy, paste, you have to learn its special keybindings. I know you do that in vi/vim too. But, focus on Emacs being friendly and then users being able to explore lisp and expand their configuration. Make Emacs a 'bait', kind-of mentality. \n There are a lot of starter configs, but none currently compares itself to an modern IDE, doesn't make org-mode feel like Typora or some paid/closed application, but Emacs has the potential. \n The last point made, I know there are, at least brought up in the discussion, how the GUI app was made and how it functions, that makes it limited in many aspects. We have hooks, like after-change-major-mode-hook, so we can have diffrent UI depending on the major mode (one for org, python, c, etc), and get inspiration from ides. \n And, lastly, all of this together, except for the architeture for the GUI, may make users think that Emacs got lost somewhere. We all know that we love Emacs because it can be what we want. All of us got an all white screen and made it ours, behave like we wanted. How enabling cua-mode(brought up inthe discussion) can change this? Imo, users simply would have a better start in UI, but get all the expandability that Emacs has.\n ​\n Anyway. I did some lisp to get my functions, I write my articles in org, but have no time to thinkering about it.\n    submitted by    /u/ProjectFresh9279  \n [link]   [comments]",

It also states \"Sequences consisting of C-c followed by any other ASCII punctuation or symbol character are allocated for minor modes\".\n However, many downloadable packages provide functions that are intended to be globally accessible, independently of major of minor modes. Many packages that I use, such as Magit, rg, projectile, suggest global keybindings to access their functionality (or even provide functions that will set \"default\" keybindings in the sacred \"C-c letter\" space!)\n These are all over the place - Magit uses \"C-x\", Tide uses \"M-,\" and \"M-.\", and so on. The most common case seems to be, the package recommends binding some functions to key combinations in the \"C-c letter\" space, but doesn't actually perform the binding itself.\n I'm wondering if there have been any discussions of this topic in the emacs community, and if there is any consensus or tentative directions proposed.\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/_just_the_anus_  \n [link]   [comments]",

But that implementation wasn't generic enough to support more planned features in ox-hugo.\n I prefer TOML over YAML (but that's a discussion for another day) and so I decided to pick just that and develop a generic library that would convert Lisp data to TOML. That was roughly a week back when I wrote this post: https://scripter.co/defining-tomelr/.\n Fast forward to today; I ended up creating tomelr.el and I wrote about it in https://scripter.co/presenting-tomelr/.\n The end-user wouldn't typically care if the front-matter was in TOML or YAML because that front-matter is mainly for Hugo's consumption. But it would be more of a ox-hugo maintenance headache if I were to keep supporting both.\n And so YAML support will be going away ..\n ox-hugo v0.11.0 Release\n https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/releases/tag/v0.11.0\n Why am I posting this here?\n If you are an ox-hugo user and set org-hugo-front-matter-format to \"yaml\", try removing that customization (or set it to \"toml\") and see if the latest version of ox-hugo causes any problem for you.\n Theoretically, it should make no difference in the final website created by Hugo.

Does anyone still use it?\n \nnntwitter: Uses gnus, with every user you follow becoming an individual feed. I've tried it, and while it kind of works, I follow ~200 people, so it takes 30 minutes or so to refresh. Plus I want to create a single time-ordered feed to read, and haven't worked out how to create a virtual group to do this yet.\n \ngnus-twit: From larsmagne, which also uses gnus.

But if the point is not on a link, C-l will does its original function. This works as intended.\n However, it doesn't work if I try to use an evil keybinding which is only active in normal mode:\n (evil-define-key 'normal org-mouse-map (kbd \"RET\") 'org-open-at-point) \n If it worked, I could use RET to open a link when I'm in normal mode.\n Some additional info: if the point is on a link, and I execute (evil-normalize-keymaps), then RET starts to work, but it will try to open links everywhere, not just on links. If I execute (evil-normalize-keymaps) when the point is not on a link, then RET doesn't work afterwards.

It seems to be working quite well also with most/all pdf-tools-modes, although it is not straightforward to make everything work flawlessly.

There's also the bufler package that I want to try, but it's not installing properly from MELPA, so I'm still looking for a good solution.\n My current workaround is to work in different frames, and use projectile-switch-to-buffer, but sometimes it would be good to quickly switch in one frame.\n Appreciate any help and suggestions.

Is there a way to clear the whole doom emacs history / cache, if not what is the way of doing it manually i.e removing / purging those files that store them so it gets regenerated. I am a bit paranoid in a sense that to know where some stuff is like zshhistory for my zsh.\n Example - Reset Doom emacs remembering Recent files (Space + f + r)\n Update: I figured this much atleast.. that there is a recentf file inside cache directory but there are other files as well which seems a bit scattered but good to know tho.\n Thanks in Advance.\n    submitted by    /u/SHuRiKeN1812  \n [link]   [comments]",

Most of them are due to compatibility reasons, e.g. some other packages depends on org-mode may use an old name for certain kind of functions. But this should not be an issue at all, because there is an \"org-compat.el\" which takes care of them.\n However, I find that, org-compat.el was never loaded in my emacs, even though I have (require 'org) in the first place, in org.el, org-compat was already required. I even tried to directly load the org-compat.el myself using (require 'org-compat). But none of the definition in the file was loaded.\n I wonder if that has anything to do with native-compilation. Anyone has an idea of how to fix this issue? I have to manually go to the org-compat.el file every single time after I restart emacs to make it works.\n Not only was org-compat.el not loaded, the org-macs.el was also not loaded.

          "description": "I'm currently learning both emacs and webdev. I'm trying to not go too far down the emacs configuration and customization rabbit hole out of the gate so that I can actually progress on the odin project. But its too intriguing to not build out some automation and QoL implementations. \n A recent fix I implemented showed me the power of being able to quickly customize built in or added package functionality to be what I want it to be. But it raised the question on best practices for doing such things. \n The example in question was navigating tags with web-mode and emmet-mode both enabled. There is some built in navigation for elements but I found one bit confusing/inefficent.\n ex: \n I use ul>li*5 to make a list with 5 items in it. It smartly jumps between the first <li></li>. I enter some text and use \"C-c C-e n\" to move to the next element. But its at the start of the next element i.e. before the < in <li>. So I wrote a very quick and dirty macro in lisp and bound it to \"C-x t\". You can see that very crude and terrible implementation below. \n My core question here is whether such an implementation is better as a macro that calls the web-mode-element-next command and makes adjustments from there or is it better to just go in and make changes to web-mode-element-next and call it normally. Granted I'll utimately make a better solution that moves the point to the end of tag after > probably finding the character with regex or something. I just don't know lisp well enough yet. \n ​\n My next-tag function - very crude just showing a code structure sample.\n (defun next-tag() (interactive) (web-mode-element-next) (forward-char) (forward-char) (forward-char) (forward-char)) (global-set-key (kbd \"C-x t\") 'next-tag) \n    submitted by    /u/timmymayes  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I realize Evil vs. traditional emacs bindings is a thoroughly discussed topic. I'm currently poring over numerous discussions in a search of this subreddit. But one discussion I haven't seen is what set of bindings is best supported/implemented outside of the standard text-editing experience. The discussions naturally tend to focus on which bindings are better for each user for editing text. But what about for everything else? \n For instance, qutebrowser is a fantastic web-browser built for keyboard focused input. It uses vim style bindings natively, but can be configured to use emacs style bindings (and there exists a community maintained configuration file to do just that). A possible issue however with attempting to use emacs style bindings for qute browser is that any features you do use, such as god-mode, might require significant manual configuration to implement. Firefox has addons for vim style experiences (I haven't found an up to date and not abandoned addon for an emacs style experience in firefox). \n Emacs has its functions for almost everything, including email clients, terminal/shells, and file management. These would naturally tend to be best supported using traditional emacs bindings, because in my experience, evil-mode, while fantastic, often lacks somewhat in documentation for the various things it's implemented in. But dedicated applications may offer support for features not easily replicable in emacs currently. \n Overall, this seems like something of a wash so far. but perhaps I'm missing something.

Is there something potentially wrong with my setup or is this just how company mode is?\n For comparison: https://i.imgur.com/eE54LAK.png\n Specifically I wanted response. to show the Body function but it wasn't showing up and that got me confused.\n Edit: Had to reinstall all LSP packages and now it shows better completions.

(funcall 'break-it stupid-toy))) \n It seems that doesn't work. My fake toy-color fn doesn't get called. Maybe because :color is read-only?\n What are my options here? I cannot use copy-toy because copier-fn is disabled (see above) Can I create a new struct type that inherits from toy through :include option, but :color no longer read-only?\n How do I create/clone a new struct from the old one?\n Remember, in my example, the struct has only one slot; the real struct type that I'm dealing with has over dozen of slots - I need to find an elegant way of cloning the struct, changing a single slot value and keeping remaining slots intact.\n    submitted by    /u/ilemming  \n [link]   [comments]",

This is a minimal config (Emacs 26.3):\n (electric-pair-mode t) (setq electric-pair--skip-whitespace nil) (setq electric-pair-skip-self nil) ;;it's hard to indent in reddit (setq electric-pair-pairs '((?\\( . ?\\)) (?\\[ . ?\\]) (?{ . ?}) (?* . ?*) (?` . ?`) (?$ . ?$))) (setq electric-pair-text-pairs '((?\\( . ?\\)) (?\\[ . ?\\]) (?{ . ?}) (?* . ?*) (?` . ?`) (?$ . ?$))) \n Basically the paired character are the brackets, the dollar sign, the backtick and the asterisk. The intended behaviour is that none of these should \"skip\". (Meaning that typing } near another } should result in }}). \n The brackes do not skip, but the other chars do skip! For example, if the point is at $|$ and i type another $ what i get is $$|. The dollar sign gets skipped! \n Also, something i notices is that the double quote char (\") gets paired even if it is not in my config file. Why is that? How should I configure electric-pair?\n    submitted by    /u/cidra_  \n [link]   [comments]",

Spent a significant amount of time learning the ins and outs of it.\n At some point I was tempted by shiny tools like OmniFocus (a fantastic tool, no doubt), Nisus Writer, Roam Research, and some more.\n After some time I realized I have isolated islands of tools not inter-operating, and I have little to no control over these tools, at least not in a consistent way (JavaScript in Roam, Apple Script and JS in OmniFocus, etc).\n So again I came back to Emacs + Org two weeks ago, having left it for several months. Now, as if my mind has been digesting all the infos that I have accumulated the months before I left it, I suddenly feel like all pieces fall together, I am quickly hacking Emacs Lisp for my workflow automations, my fingers are flying over the keyboard (using Karabiner Elements and \"God Mode\" https://medium.com/@nikitavoloboev/karabiner-god-mode-7407a5ddc8f6) and I get sooo much more done in a way not possible by the other tools I used! Everything is connected to each other now: My writing, documenting, my task management, my text editing and every bit of a text tranformation. This is such a wonderful way to get things done.\n Thank you to all the maintainers of Emacs, Orgmode, and all the wonderful packages like ivy, counsel, org-ql, and many more!\n Also, I am very happy with this community, that has helped me get a better understanding of the ins and outs of Emacs and Elisp.\n    submitted by    /u/pragmat1c1  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Prompted by Maggie Appleton’s recent update to her post on Daily Notes Pages, I was fondly remembering a time when I had a teeny little script that appended a single line of text to a kind of log. I didn’t want to use Day One for the kind of fleeting note that might trigger something else but as likely might not. So I returned to my original thought and repurposed it to work with The Archive.\nI borrowed ideas from Better Journaling with The Archive (and BitBar). I don’t have Keyboard Maestro and I didn’t want BitBar, but the principles are absolutely sound, so I adapted them to create a single script:\n#!/bin/sh\n# Open a daily journaling note\n# Create the note if it does not exist\n\nZK_PATH=\"/Users/path/to-your-notes\"\nDAY=`date +%Y%m%d`\n\nNOTE=\"${ZK_PATH}/${DAY}${HOUR}.md\"\n\nif [[ -f \"$NOTE\" ]]; then\n    open \"thearchive://match/${DAY}\"\nelse\n    echo \"# Journal Note\" >\"${NOTE}\"\n    echo \"Date: \"`date +\"%d %B %Y %H:%M\"` >>\"${NOTE}\"\n    echo \"Tags: #journal\" >>\"${NOTE}\" \n    echo \"\" >>\"${NOTE}\"\n    open \"thearchive://match/${DAY}\"\nfi\n\nThe script runs from an Alfred workflow. The first time on any given day it creates the note and opens it. Next time, it just opens the note. And as brunoc noted, because the note has a specific tag it is easy to find all such notes and see whether there is anything there I need to act on.\nI’m pretty sure that this could be more elegant, probably by testing for the absence of the note rather than its existence. Another nicety would be to capture some input and append it to the day’s note without even opening it. The previous little script might offer a start for that. But hey, it works as intended and that’s good enough for me right now.",

I have two Zettelkasten in The Archive, one for academic and more general non-fiction work (around 1400 notes) and one for fiction work (around 1450 notes).\nThe question I have for you is about déjà-vu in your ZK. I very regularly make new notes, only to discover, either when I add them to the ZK or much later, that I already made almost the same note at an earlier date.\nDoes this happen to you? Do you see it as a problem, or as a sign that the topic is important to you? If you notice such double entries, do you not enter the new note, do you merge them, or do you enter the new note specifically as ‘alternative’ to the other one?\nAny other insights are also welcome.",

Also, for the intended audience of that book---students who must study for a test, and need to learn that material---it is likely useful and a good read. I might even recommend it to a high schooler.\nThat said, my note's title is from the perspective of what utility I perceived for me.  The advice seemed pat, too cut-and-dried, proclaimed with a finality that stuck the wrong cord in me. When I read the bibliography, I found something very curious for a book from 2018: the references by decade are: 7 from 2010s, 39 from 2000s, 62 from 1990s, 50 from 1980s, 18 from 1970s. Nothing wrong with old references: I have cited 19th century books often enough and once a 17th century book in a paper in computer science, but the relative balance caught my eye.  These 80s/90s skew is curious, although a tad more explained by the original date of publication (2007). Surely more ink has been spilled on this topic this decade, some refining the cited works, others casting grave doubt on some other cited works? FWIW, I have a Ph.D. in Cognitive Science and am quite familiar with some lines of research here and which I find rather dubious (won't name names, sorry).\nSo, some good stuff here,  no doubt about it, great material for a longish blog post, but the hefty 250+ pages that it is is a stretch.\nI normally don't write bad reviews, preferring to keep my mouth shut. But this has been strongly recommended here---enough for me to purchase this---so I felt obliged to add a counter argument.  Just my 2¢.\nBest regards,\n  Abhijit",
