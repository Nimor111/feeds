For example perhaps you’re writing a logger and want to call a function log. That’s a problem because the Prelude also defines a function called log. You can’t use either one without disambiguating. Usually you will disambiguate by qualifying the identifier like MyLogger.log. This is fine but it is a little annoying because it duplicates the name of the module. If you later refactor this module by changing its name, you’ll also have to update a…",

I’ve looked into it a bit, as well as other functional languages and realized I’ve been using functional programming for most of my career without really considering it. I use power query from excel for data migration, and it is a functional language called “m code” that is related to F#.\n I think it may be worth while to learn Haskell, mainly as it forms the foundation of many Domain Specific Languages in the research papers I’ve been reading, but it led me to think maybe Haskell has untapped potential on AI driven development.\n Because Haskell’s stigma as a “whitepaper” language, and often not used outside of the academic setting (just as viewed from outside observation), wouldn’t code quality in training datasets naturally be of a higher quality than the sea of sloppy JavaScript and terabytes of poorly written Python scripts?\n Has anyone experimented with ai generated Haskell code? \n    submitted by    /u/synthapetic  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I've been fascinated by haskell for many years. Until recently, however, I didn't have a compelling enough project for me to grit my teeth and work through all the issues associated with learning to program in a language properly.\n Last year, my wfie and I walked the Camino Santigo and, since I had plenty of time to think and not much else to do, I started to think about how to better plan the daily stages. It takes 30-40 days to complete and guidebooks tend to give stages for a \"normal\" pilgrim; we discovered that we started flagging at about 25km or so.\n So building a Camino planner that optimises the stages for the entire journey, based on people's preferences in terms of distance, time, accommodation etc. became that project.\n You can give the result a spin at https://de-calixtinus.org It's a yesod website that uses dynamic programming to plan out the route. The source code is at https://github.com/charvolant/de-calixtinus\n I'm painfully aware that this has been a learning project. You can see traces of it where, for example, I've become comfortable with something like applicative programming but haven't got around to rethinking previous stuff in the light of my new knowledge. Yesod is a bugger to learn and the scaffolding makes it wilfully obscure, so you can see where I've been going through things in a step-wise fashion, slowly pulling stuff in from the scaffolding once I've understood what's going on. The fields work, but there's obviously more stuff needed. The configuration is trapped partway between where it was a stand-alone program and where it became a web application. And so on.\n If any kind soul wanted to look over the code and suggest improvements or completely better ways of looking at things, I'd be most grateful.\n    submitted by    /u/orlock  \n [link]   [comments]",

If there's a more appropriate place for asking questions like this, please let me know.\n I'm very inexperienced with statically typed language (haven't used one in years), but I work in a research lab where we use Clojure, and as a thought experiment, I'm trying to work out how our core Clojure system would be implemented in Haskell. The key challenge seems to be that Haskell doesn't allow polymorphic lists--or I saw someone call them heterogeneous lists?--with more than one concrete type. That's gonna cause a big problem for me, unless I'm missing something.\n So we have this set of \"components.\" These are clojure objects that all have the same core functions defined on them (like a haskell typeclass), but they all do something different. Essentially, they each take in as input a list of elements, and then produce as output a new list of elements. These elements, like the components, are heterogeneous. They're implemented as Clojure hashmaps that essentially map from a keyword to anything. They could be implemented statically as records, but there would be many different records, and they'd all need to go into the same list (or set).\n So that's the challenge. We have a heterogenous set of components that we'd want to represent in a single list/set, and these produce a hetereogeneous set of elements that we'd want to represent in a single list/set. There might be maybe 30-40 of each of these, so representing every component in a single disjunctive data type doesn't seem feasible.\n Does that question make sense? I'm curious if there's a reasonable solution in Haskell that I'm missing. Thanks.\n    submitted by    /u/mister_drgn  \n [link]   [comments]",

However, after examining the code, it will still run separate transactions unless you call withTransaction and run everything in TransactionM.\n I thought about using some thread local state to store the current SqlBackend and use that if it's available, but I'm not sure if it's the right approach.\n How is this generally handled? We just want to have a single transaction per request, ideally with the ability to commit it and/or start a new one.\n    submitted by    /u/Standard-Function-44  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Lean 4 has a very cool feature that allows monadic do-blocks to contain imperative loops and mutable variables. This paper provides the motivation and theoretical underpinning.\n Since the concept is portable to any purely functional language supporting monad transformers, I thought it would be a fun experiment to implement it as a GHC plugin. The resulting plugin, donuts, allows for writing imperative style code such as this:\n guessPass :: IO Bool guessPass = do let Mut guesses = [] let Mut n = 1 :: Int whileL (n < 5) $ do putStrLn $ \"Enter guess #\" <> show n input <- getLine guesses := input : guesses when (input == \"secret123\") $ earlyReturn True n := n + 1 putStrLn $ \"All wrong: \" <> intercalate \", \" guesses pure False \n which the plugin desugars to monad transformer applications: ExceptT for control flow and StateT for mutable variables. Note that this works for any monadic do-block, not just IO.\n The imperativity is local in the sense that mutable variables are only mutable within the confines of the enclosing do-block's body statements as well as the bodies of loops occurring in that block. Similar restrictions apply for control flow commands such as earlyReturn, breakL, and continueL.\n    submitted by    /u/aaron-allen  \n [link]   [comments]",

Additionally, using (++) on Strings is poor performance and our professors would not like it. \n I thought of using Debug.Trace to do this, but the Documentation recommends not to use it in production since it forces a value to be computed instead of being lazy. \n What can I do?\n    submitted by    /u/cybercoderNAJ  \n [link]   [comments]",

There must be a way to keep uniformity and readability in Haskell; autoformat should like it, too.\n PS I still can't figure out how to make code snippets readable.

It's Tom Schrijver's Soar With Haskell and am finding this quite good. It covers some of the territory that Allen and Moronuki cover, but in a more accessible manner (albeit in less depth).

          "description": "I've just switched over to ghcup and away from exclusively stack. I'm also trying to use Emacs' org-mode Babel, which is Jupyter notebook-style literate programming with more functionality than the Jupyter, IMHO. The going is not smooth getting the code blocks in the org-mode text to work, as they are run in a ghci session -- with all the restrictions such as multiple line versus single line to deal with. So when working with Haskell on org-mode, I first start a project with cabal init inside a directory, e.g., .../myproj. This will just be a skeleton, since I will throw my org-mode Babel files in this directory too. Next, I want to install Hackage packages, so I add them to the myproj.cabal build-depends section and do cabal run. Now, since org-mode's Babel is sending my Haskell code blocks to ghci, can that ghci session see and use the packages of myproj? If I do :show paths in the ghci buffer it reports .../myproj so no need to do a :cd <myprojdir> Very well. But my question is, does the ghci session see, can use my included packages from the project? As I understand, packages are installed per project (ergo per directory). But is there a global way with ghcup to install a package for all projects to use? For example, if I want QuickCheck globally and not have to include it per project, is this possible? Similarly, if I want to open a ghci REPL anywhere, how can I access packages?\n    submitted by    /u/teilchen010  \n [link]   [comments]",

Copilot is typically used as a high-level runtime verification framework, and supports temporal logic (LTL, PTLTL and MTL), clocks and voting algorithms.\n Copilot is being used at NASA in drone test flights. Through the NASA tool Ogma [1] (also written in Haskell), Copilot also serves as a runtime monitoring backend for NASA's Core Flight System, Robot Operating System (ROS2), and FPrime (the software framework used in the Mars Helicopter) applications.\n This release drastically increases the test coverage of copilot-core.

It is possible when the ho function does not store functional arguments in variables but only invokes (as in map). This is the work of Olena Kravchenko during her GSoC-2023 project. More details can be found in Olena-s presentation: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1H5rIQlqeektpZAnC547YnlPoXChrH99UOLMy4kY-pRQ/edit?usp=sharing and GitHub discussion: https://github.com/rssh/dotty-cps-async/discussions/79.\n Added compile-time checks for attempts to use direct syntax when the compiler plugin is not enabled. It is possible to freely mix code compiled with and without a plugin, if you accidentally forget the plugin when it was needed, you will receive a compile-time error.\n  \nLogic module:\n  \nExtend API, add a few examples in tests, and an implementation of CpsLogicMonad over LazyList.\n  \nURL: https://github.com/rssh/dotty-cps-async \n    submitted by    /u/rssh1  \n [link]   [comments]",

The code would be perhaps harder to read. Sometimes less efficient as well. \n What are your thoughts on this? Would you say FP and immutability make sense for some more or less complex algorithms? \n Also, once again I'm no FP expert but I'd tend to think it's okay to have mutable state if the method do not produce any real side effects. As long as no class instance variables or global variables are mutated by a method, having some \"var\" inside a method can be an okay choice if it makes the code more readable and efficient. Why would it be so bad to have a \"var\" inside a pure method? \n I'd love to hear your thoughts. \n Thanks in advance!\n    submitted by    /u/yinshangyi  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I am one of these \"Scala as better Java devs\", working like that for years, but from time to time I am trying to explore more of Scala world with Cats Effect.\n Everytime I try to make some basic apps with Cats Effects by myself, I end up thinking that it provides a lot of great solutions for the problems I introduced by using it.\n What I understand is that making my code pure functional, will make some things like - testing or blocking IO handling easier, but at the cost of wrapping classic lines of codes in framework specific constructs. Is it worth it? I don't feel that my code is better and more secure when I use Cats Effect compared to my FP+OOP Scala mix.\n I am used to Akka stack for backend - mostly classic actors, cluster, Akka Streams for data processing (like IoT management system for example), and just Scala for internal tools and game development. I don't see what is the benefit of dropping my current way of using Scala and use Cats Effect/Zio instead.\n The worst thing is - that pure functional programming with Cats Effect or Zio is so popular in Scala world, that I can't find any job not mentioning it (well, maybe some big data ones).\n Do you have any suggestions that could help me find answers for my question? Maybe effects are not suitable for my use cases? Are they better for solving some special niche problems? Which ones? Thank you in advance!\n    submitted by    /u/ByerN  \n [link]   [comments]",

My interviewing skills have gotten much stronger, but I haven't gotten any new tech screens for months. Just rejection after rejection. Needless to say, I'm branching out.\n F# is pretty much a no-go at this point. At any given time, it is entirely possible that there is not a single public job posting for an F# position. The positions that do pop up aren't often particularly good ones. Even so, I apply and get rejected without a tech screen.\n I'm currently examining Scala as an option, since many companies use it as a functional language. This would be very similar to my experience using C# as a functional language, and my direct FP experience in F#.\n I'd like to know what I would have to do to successfully make that transition to Scala. Specifically, what is the minimum that I'd have to learn about Scala to talk my way in? Or, is there a way I can sell myself such that I don't have to do any additional learning before I start a role as a Scala engineer?\n Thus far, I've gotten all rejections without tech screens for Scala positions just like everything else.

I’m studying engineering, so I’m seriously eyeing the inline LaTeX rendering capabilities of org-mode for notetaking. I first downloaded MiKTeX and installed it with the provided installer (it seems like dvipng is included in MiKTeX) then tried configuring org-mode to render with dvipng, by adding the following to my init.el file:\n (setq org-preview-latex-default-process 'dvipng) (setq org-latex-create-formula-image-program 'dvipng) (setq org-preview-latex-process-alist '((dvipng :programs (\"latex\" \"dvipng\") :description \"dvi > png\" :message \"you need to install the programs: latex and dvipng.\" :image-input-type \"dvi\" :image-output-type \"png\" :image-size-adjust (1.0 . 1.0) :latex-compiler (\"latex -interaction nonstopmode -output-directory %o %f\") :image-converter (\"dvipng -fg %F bg %B -D %D -T tight -o %O %f\")) )) \n However, if I type some inline LaTeX in an org-mode file and try to compile it with C-c C-x C-l, I get the following message: \n Creating LaTeX previews in region... org-compile-file: File \"c:/Users/USERNAME/AppData/Local/Temp/orgtexTelk2W.dvi\" wasn’t produced. Please adjust ‘dvipng’ part of ‘org-preview-latex-process-alist’. \n Does anyone know what I might have done wrong? I read this post, but no log files seem to have been generated for me. If I run \"latex c:/Users/USERNAME/AppData/Local/Temp/orgtexTelk2W.tex\" in the command line it generates a dvi file of the same name; running \"dvipng c:/Users/USERNAME/AppData/Local/Temp/orgtexTelk2W.dvi\" seems to also generate a proper png image with the same name.

This orders.org will then have a header \n * Order B7 Blinds :sometag: \n then I make it TODO and add details of the ordering to the note. I come from the relational database world where the instinct is not to crowd everything into one table, rather create a new table to normalize. But is that \"best practice\" with org-agenda?

I'm in it and emacs most of the day.\n However, the one aspect I have never quite understood is why TODOs seem the same as headings. My natural expectation is that when taking notes, especially with meetings, I want to slot in a TODO based on the context of the notes at that time. But with a TODO being a heading, all the plain text notes below it come under that heading. So I tend to have a heading at the bottom of the notes section called Tasks or something under which I enter the TODOs for that meeting, but that approach does lose the context location from the full notes--not a major issue, but flipping about to record TODOs does disrupt flow.\n So, what am I missing? I did search on this a bit and think identified that some people just use headings for the full notes, and any plain text under a heading is just brief explanation or extra detail for that heading but may be omitted altogether. However, the way headings are formatted by default with bold doesn't feel natural for note-taking (I use Prot's Modus themes, and then a mixture of formatting from System Crafters videos).\n Or maybe I have missed something really obvious.

Whether you edit files in Metanote or use other app to edit files in external folders, or retrieve updates from iCloud or Git, Metanote can now automatically detect changes to files and update them accordingly. Your content will always stay up to date.\n Agenda Filter support is now available, allowing you to filter schedules and to-do items directly by category, todo keyword, and tag.\n Buffer outlines now support clicking to jump to a specific headline.\n Customization of Todo Keyword icons and colors is now possible.\n More intuitive and convenient multi-buffer management is now provided. You can now directly switch buffers from the Buffer list.\n Various other optimizations have been made, resulting in increased stability.\n  \n​\n Regarding file synchronization, Metanote can add any external directory that supports folder-level File Provider and automatically detect file updates. Unfortunately, many cloud drives only support file-level File Provider. We have implemented the ability to add individual files to Metanote, which is still in testing and is expected to be launched in next version. Therefore, the best regular file synchronization solutions for now are:\n ​\n  \niCloud, which supports folder-level File Provider and can be directly added to Metanote.\n Git, where most Git app's directories can be directly added to Metanote. For example, with PolyGit, when you git pull, Metanote will automatically update the file content.\n Other apps that support synchronization. Most document editing apps can be directly added to Metanote, such as Obsidian and Logseq. When files in these apps are updated, Metanote will automatically handle the edited files.\n  \n   submitted by    /u/metanote-team  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "There are some of macOS-specified shortcuts like `S-c` (yank) `S-s` (save-buffer) ... on `--with-ns` compilation on emacs.\n However I think some of these shortcuts are not just appending the existing keybindes on emacs (which is expected), but making the existing keybinds unusable.\n For example, I cannot press `C-x-C-s` or `C-s` on `--with-ns` version on emacs. It is wierd that these keybinds cannot be scannable for emacs. When I press it, emacs simply do not responding. The minibuffer waits for next input like `C-x-C-` even if I pressed multiple times `s`, and when i pressing other key on keyboard, It responds and that other binding is executed. I'm able to use `S-s` for saving and `S-f` for I-search instead, but these keybindings are not comfortable for my hands, so I really want to use the original one.\n Is there anyone experiencing same thing on macOS? Or if anyone has ideas on how to fix it, I'd really appreciate it.\n    submitted by    /u/phdppp  \n [link]   [comments]",

Suppose I have the following:\n (setq org-attach-preferred-new-method 'id) (setq org-attach-method 'cp) (set org-id-method 'ts) (setq org-attach-store-link-p 'attached) \n and I then create a brand new heading and attach a file -- call it myfile.org -- to it.\n I will end up with the following:\n  \nthe heading having had a property drawer created and an ID property inserted, with a value of something like 20240403T211636.762842\n a copy of myfile.org placed in <something>/20/240403T211636.762842/, and\n a link added to org-stored-links as (\"attachment:myfile.org\" \"myfile.org\")\n  \nThen, if Igo somewhere else entirely -- another file in my vast Org estate, say -- and use C-c C-l to run org-insert-link and choose that new link, I'll end up with this inserted:\n [[attachment:myfile.org][myfile.org]] \n (which may well be rendered to look like myfile.org, but it's the above text underneath nevertheless.)\n Finally, if I follow that link, e.g. using C-c C-o to org-open-at-point -- I'm taken to the attached file, <something>/20/240403T211636.762842/myfile.org\n How does Org know where that file is?\n    submitted by    /u/TeeMcBee  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Based on valuable feedback and the challenges many of us face during online coding interviews or sessions, I've pushed a significant update to the Chrome-Emacs extension that extends its compatibility to more environments.\n This includes experimental support for vscode.dev, codesandbox.com, GitHub Codespaces, and other online Monaco-based editors where direct API access is unavailable.\n The update relies on simulating user interactions to achieve real-time synchronization from Emacs to the browser. Given the complexity of these platforms, the feature primarily supports synchronization from Emacs to the browser, with additional nuances due to the simulation approach.\n Important to Note:\n This experimental feature heavily relies on the presence of some default keyboard shortcuts within these web editors. These shortcuts are essential for simulating actions such as selection, deletion, and text navigation.\n For a detailed explanation and the full list of these shortcuts, please refer to our documentation on experimental Monaco support.\n I also primarily tested it on Linux. Although I have translated shortcuts to be Mac-compatible too, I haven't tested it extensively.\n Try It Out: If you’re interested in testing this feature or want to see how Chrome-Emacs can enhance your coding sessions, visit the Chrome Web Store.

Emins will run only on 8086 processors attached to VT52 terminals, eliminating all that overhead of window systems, multitasking OSes and all that #ifdefed C code. Lisp will be replaced with the direct control and numeric accuracy of the native instruction set. Key bindings will be limited to standard ones on C-a to C-z. Although this will make writing hard, it will save a lot of work and compositions that, let’s face it, are often written but not read.

For a while I've been mostly successfully being able to use Emacs in Termux for org-roam on my mobile phone. \n However, in the past few months any org-roam 'look-up' operations, like org-roam-node-insert, org-roam-node-find, &c. have become slower and slower. Worse, in the past couple of months, after doing one or two such operations it seems to get stuck indefinitely, and trying to cancel out with C-g does nothing the first time, and kills Emacs the second time.\n I'm not sure whether the issue is that my org-roam file library has continued to grow or whether it's to do with changes to Android (there have been a few Android OS updates in that time period). Or whether the issue is with accessing a larger sqlite database or whether it's to do with the actual file-lookup operations (more org-roam files over time).\n Is anyone in a similar situation? Any ideas of how to resolve this? Maybe at the Termux level? (I saw, for instance, a Termux 'no-root-ram-booster' [ https://github.com/White9shadow/no-root-ram-booster ] but haven't tried it or know whether it would be at all relevant.

          "description": "I would like to do a debug-like \"step through\" of a 3.5K-line elisp program. It's org-brain and I can't really figure out where/what the first function call is. org-brain works by having a set of org files and the headings in org files to be ID'ed (UUID in a PROPERTIES drawer) then create a quasi-graph view of the org files and heading hierarchies in a graph/network-like child, parent, friend relationships between files and headings. So I'm trying to figure out how this whole thing starts. My guess is it takes org-element to parse out the ID attached to a file or headings, then creates some graph store cache. Or maybe not...\n Investigations found a use of org-refile here that will gather up all the headings in a designated directory, and, yes, org-brain does utilize org-refile, but just for actual refiling. Dead end. The org-brain author, who wants to not maintain anymore did say this:\n  \nThe entries are cached and stored in memory after the first \"scan\" of a session. I think there are ways to store the cache to disk.\n  \nbut I can't find how this is being done. AFAICT, org-brain simply starts with some location entry, a file or heading, and simply works-crawls in whatever direction from there, i.e., there is no cache in memory or hash table. That is, org-brain is nothing but the visualization and not a graph database management app. There is something referring to .org-id-locations, but I don't believe this is used in org-brain to create a cache. Any ideas? I basically need to step/trace through this monster. I'm guessing if I can find it's very first action, I'll have my best shot at figuring out if indeed everything is read and cached.\n    submitted by    /u/teilchen010  \n [link]   [comments]",

The connection is restored and the X window reappears automatically (it changes the position of the icon for Emacs on the taskbar upon reconnection). So compiling from source with with-x-toolkit=lucid seems to be a workable solution and now appears to work better than the X410 (and likely VcXsrv) solution.\n Sometimes, the X window GUI still does crash or whatever and I cannot bring it back - in which case I restart WSLg by opening a PowerShell terminal and enter wsl --system and kill the process associated with ps aux | grep /usr/bin/weston. My Emacs daemon remains running (though it seems to kill off the Python or whatever shell that was running from it, unfortunately) and I can reopen my GUI with emacsclient -c.\n The pure GTK build still hangs and becomes unresponsive as before (presumably from a network disconnection) so that does not appear to be fixed; for the time being the Lucid build is a workable solution.

          "description": "After recently discovering Org-Roam, I’m looking to migrate to a full Emacs setup, but there’s one non-negotiable feature I need to transfer: block references.\n Block references are links in one file to a block of text in another file by means of a uuid. The text is transcluded so you can preview the contents in any file it’s referenced and you can even see the number of backlinks to the original reference. There’s only one plugin that offers at least the uuid-based text block transclusion feature: Roam Block.\n So far, the solutions involved migrating everything from Logseq or Roam to Emacs Org-Mode, but losing block references by imputing the original referenced text in its place. I suspect the solution might look like obtaining the SQL or database file where all block uuids are referenced and somehow transfer this mapping to have the same uuid transcluded the same content. \n If anyone has some ideas as to how to achieve this, I’m more than either to start a conversation on the how. Please understand that I’m trying to keep block references, and cannot leave them out of the solution. So far I’ve found org-transclusion, two org-Logseq scripts on Awesome Logseq, and a roam-migration script, but none of these solutions seem to migrate the block references.\n This really seems like a no-brainer to solve, but I don’t know how would the solution look like. I’m open to any solution whether migrating from Logseq or Roam, as long as block references are migrated :)\n    submitted by    /u/marco_camilo  \n [link]   [comments]",

But I'm reluctant to make changes to my config file yet - when I have the time to look into that stuff properly, I want a vanilla setup, so I know I can follow any tutorial without worrying about one thing maybe breaking another, or whatever. \n With that in mind, I want to go through Euclid in org-mode.

          "description": "Some URIs can contain URI fragments, e.g. foo.bar/baz#locator where locator is the fragment. See RFC 5147. Is there a way to reliably handle these in emacs?\n Here's my usecase: I use ebib, which lets me store a PDF filepath in a bibtex entry, then open the file at the filepath with a command when I'm viewing that entry. One problem with this is that often (in my discipline at least) the bibtex entry doesn't relate to a file, it relates to some part of a file (e.g. where the entry is for a paper published in a collection, and my file is a PDF of the whole collection). The obvious way to get around this is to store a URI with a fragment in the bibtex file field (e.g. path/to/my.pdf#page=210 for a paper which starts on page 210 of the collection). \n However, as far as I can tell, emacs doesn't support using URI fragments in finding files. Am I right/wrong? Is there a good known solution?\n To be clear, I know I could write a custom file handler function for ebib specifically, but that seems a bit too specific. I'd rather have a general way of handling this, so that ebib doesn't have to do anything unusual. That way, other applications which deal with the same cases (e.g. citar, in the case above) will inherit the same functionality.\n TIA!\n    submitted by    /u/Jack-o-tall-tales  \n [link]   [comments]",

One is invoking sudo directly, which requires entering my password each time I use it. The other is using tramp; if I try to use it, then in order to terminate the ability to use sudo without a password, I need to terminate the created tramp sudo connection. I could probably solve it by closing such a connection automatically after a certain period, but I can't even find a function that lists all active tramp connections. I saw a discussion on the internet suggesting:\n (setq eshell-prefer-lisp-variables t)\n (setq password-cache t)\n (setq password-cache-expiry 10)\n But it doesn't do anything for my case.There's a command called 'tramp-cleanup-connection'. If I use it on a buffer where I opened a sudo connection, I see something like '/sudo:root@archlinux:', and choosing this connection to close doesn't do anything. Only using 'tramp-cleanup-all-connections' closes it, obviously.\n My apologies for any technical inaccuracies, i'm not even an emacs user (yet).\n    submitted by    /u/Electronic-Ferret-83  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I'm not talking about emacsserver here, something completely different. This may be a heretical idea, but I want to see where it goes. I have an idea for a note-taking program that's as nice-looking, performant and friendly as logseq or obsidian, but is fully backed by emacs and org-mode. I need features like tags, transclusion and backlinks, but also want all of Emacs: keyboard macros, eval'ed source blocks, LSP mode, etc. -- but over it all I want a smooth modern UI. I know some folks here will tell me how it's possible in emacs; believe me, I've looked into the options for some years now (org-roam, org-logseq, org-transclusion, org-roam-ui and more) and the ones I've seen are slow or fragile or never bore fruit, so just bear with me and see if we can explore this idea.\n What I'd like is to run emacs in a headless way and sync, in realtime, a set of buffers to a modern UI (maybe electron, who knows). Let's say we have a page in the UI, composed of a set of buffers (a buffer per block, maybe with sub-\"buffers\" transcluded into the UI), and the UI knows which emacs buffer corresponds to each block of text. My idea is the UI forwards keyboard & mouse events to emacs and receives buffer updates (including text props & overlays etc.), which it then displays in an integrated nice way. Could such a thing even be done? I don't want to scrape the emacs pixels -- I want to \"export\" the meaningful contents of the buffer for display over a socket protocol. Text, properties, overlays, images, etc. with their semantics. \n It seems like such a thing could be useful for other purposes as well, like using emacs to edit any text field in any app. Possibly even emacs could then run as an http service as the back end of a web app to run on Android or iOS. I'm sure I'm not the first to think of doing this; has anyone tried it before? What was learned?\n    submitted by    /u/simplex5d  \n [link]   [comments]",

After some searching I found some sample functions, and I bootstrapped them into this,\n ​\n (defun highlight-word () \"Highlight the current word you are on.\" (interactive) (backward-word 1) (set-mark-command nil) (forward-word 1)) (global-set-key (kbd \"C-c C-SPC\") 'highlight-word) \n At least with this I can be almost anywhere in the word and I can highlight it, and then, for example, select all other occurrence. \n ​\n After doing this I have a glimpse at what could be keybound.

          "description": "Hey guys,\n I am a relatively new Emacs user (vanilla keybindings), but I am already starting to feel severely crippled when I have to use non-emacs keybindings.\n I do as much as I possibly can in Emacs and I love it, but I sometimes have to reach for a capable web browser.\n I tried out Nyxt, eaf-browser, qutebrowser, vimium browser extension, using Emacs/readline keybindings in GTK2/3 by setting gtk-theme-name = \"Emacs\".\n Current setup:\n  \nFirefox: I want to support a mature and well-maintained non-chromium browser. I also use a custom user.js and UBlock Origin to enhance privacy and security. Pages load very fast. Minimal strain on cpu and enhanced battery life.\n Vimium: Far from perfect, as many standard emacs keybindings like M-> for (end-of-buffer), cannot be implemented. Setting ui.accelKey to 18, ui.key.chromeAccess to 0 and devtools.editor.keymap to \"emacs\" helped.\n GTK2/3: Setting gtk-theme-name = \"Emacs\" really helps and makes editing input fields feel great. Unfortunately this won't be supported anymore once firefox migrates from GTK3 to GTK4.\n  \nMaybe my standards are too high and I should just be happy with what I have.\n But so far I am not willing to give up on it, as my browsing experience is really the last puzzle piece missing to an otherwise perfect workflow.\n Alternative:\n Out of all the alternatives I like Nyxt by far the most.\n It truly supports emacs keybindings and I love the minibuffer. It is a joy to move around.\n If it only was possible to have extensions like UBlock Origin and maybe even swap out WebkitGTK in favor of Firefox's Gecko Engine, I'd make Nyxt my daily driver immediately and never look back. It would be a dream come true.\n I'd really appreciate if some of you guys with requirements similar to mine (vanilla keys, ad-blocking, security and privacy concerns) could share their workflow.\n Although a student on a very tight budget, I'll probably have to start donating regularly to Nyxt to keep my hopes alive.\n    submitted by    /u/schwinghmmr  \n [link]   [comments]",

I understand some of the possibilities and what it can do, but I'm struggling with even some basic tutorials and have some questions. I understand some conceptual things, like buffers/windows/frames, kill ring, etc., but I don't really know how to start integrating Emacs into my workflow. I come from VS Code and other IDEs like it.\n I began by skimming over this tutorial and these papers (1 and 2); however, when I try and use some of the macros they don't seem to work. For instance, if I try and use C-h r, Emacs reports \"C-h C-r is undefined\"; I don't get why this is the case, because I am holding down the CTRL key, then pressing h, then pressing r, then releasing CTRL, but it seems like Emacs is reading 2 separate presses of CTRL?. As well, I started watching this video to get the Emacs UI to look decent, but I'm not sure how I go about making a init.el file (like where do I save it, how do I access and edit the file, etc.). I know I can use C-x C-f to find a file, but it autofills c:/Program Files/Emacs; is this normal? I thought the init.el is in ~/<USERNAME>/AppData/Roaming/.emacs.d/init.el/?

(Upcoming changes from Google will disable Manifest V2 extensions in Chrome by June 2024.)\n Text, Scroll, & Selection Sync: Provides real-time text, cursor, and selection synchronization between Emacs and the browser.\n Enhanced File Management and Auto Major Mode Detection: Offers improved handling for a smoother experience, supporting features like linting and auto-completion.\n Editable Area Navigation: Quickly switch between editable fields in complex web pages with hints.\n  \nCompatibility Note: These enhancements are in a fork, requiring an accompanying fork of the atomic-chrome.el package for full benefits. They still work with the original package for basic functionalities, though.\n Collaboration over Competition: I admire the original atomic-chrome.el project and intend this fork as a contribution, not a replacement. My goal is to merge these improvements back into the original to benefit everyone. I also admire the original atomic-chrome extension.\n Difference from Other Extensions:\n  \nVs.

Please feel free to roast my config and poke holes in it and suggest some improvements :)\n Currently I have 2 folders core/ (for emacs internal stuff) and modules/ (for packages) where core/core-init.el is sourced (required) from my init.el and it in turn sources the rest of core/ and all from modules/. Previously, what I have done for modules is that I've put the (elpaca-wait) command in each module, so that after each module is read elpaca processes the queue immediately and activates the package (at least that's what I thought it did from how I understood it before).\n Since then, I've come to learn that elpaca processes the packages queue after reading the init file, so that made me think that it's enough to call (elpaca-wait) only once at the end of my init.el after all the modules have been read -- which is what I did, however, now on startup I get warnings about bunch of packages that says:\n  \nef-themes loaded before Elpaca activation (analogously for the others) and all of those packages are inactive and some of my settings for the font, theme, orderless, consult etc. aren't respected.\n  \nBefore I go ahead and refactor and fix everything, is my understanding correct that it is enough to write all package configs and then call (elpaca-wait) once at the end of my init.el for it to process and load all my package configs?

          "description": "Hey guys, I have jumped back to Emacs after using regular editors (for quite a while). I've been using avy and the likes to accelerate my navigations. And they are awesome! The one big problem I have with emacs is the scrolling. When it scrolls the whole screen changes, including the point, which loses all points of reference. I have tried using ways like scrolling only half a screen, smooth scrolling, or resorting to using my mouse (which sucks btw). In the end, I've settled down with good-scroll for full-screen scrolls, and repeated C-u C-n/C-u C-ps. And there's that.\n Except it isn't. Because now the problem becomes horizontal scrolling. For example, the code in the header image. If I were to, say, scroll down while reading the code, I don't really have a friendly way to scroll horizontally and back. Like, there's always this violent skip which makes me think \"oh where was I again?\" If I was using regular code editors like Kate, I can scroll horizontally using the mouse, and the scrolling will be smooth so I can conveniently track and read the code. But for hscroll, there's only C-e and M-m in emacs (at least to my knowledge). I guess there's M-f etc as well, but they move too slowly so it's not as efficient.\n So what I am looking for? Well something like C-l that places the point in the center, except this time it's horizontally centered as well. The other thing is during these horizontal scrolls and I move the point down, and the next line is not as long as the previous one, it skips back to the left and when the next line length is long enough, it skips back again. If there's something that can preserve horizontal point offset during these scrolls it'll be awesome. But not something like scroll-left because I have to manually scroll-right to get back.\n    submitted by    /u/42yeah  \n [link]   [comments]",

Heck, I'm scared I might unlearn vim itself.\n What I want to know is if it's possible to use emacs bindings inside emacs and my custom (vim) bindings outside it?

          "description": "First: I've searched for solutions and experimented but without success. Hopefully you have some ideas!\n The tl;dr is that I'm keen to find a way to edit files on remote Windows hosts using ssh as the protocol from a Linux host.\n I'm a Linux user through-and-through but have to manage Windows boxen sometimes. Modern Windows can run sshd, though, and combined with powershell, managing remote Windows hosts is actually bearable. However, I'd prefer to edit files within my local emacs session rather than through a terminal running ssh. The challenge is finding the right C-x C-f path spec to connect to a remote ssh host that works when that target is running Windows (with all those caveats).\n Some considerations:\n  \nI know that I can connect to Windows hosts remotely via ssh correctly and passwordless. I can edit the login shell, I've tinkered with both cmd.exe and pwsh.exe without much success.\n I do have the ability to target sh.exe or bash.exe, although I haven't managed to make that work either (by changing TRAMP connection properties for the remote host)\n I assume there may be something I need to set to make the connection \"aware\" that the remote is Windows despite connecting over ssh, though I'm not sure what that setting might be (for example, changing a line ending setting)\n  \nI'd love any ideas or help with this.\n    submitted by    /u/leothrix  \n [link]   [comments]",

I used my own config, then moved to Spacemacs, tried Doom and finally settled in Spacemacs.\n For personal stuff, I have a few annoyances but nothing major but, for work, there are a few things that hurt my productivity - I need to get things done and don't have much time to fix, so I am using VSCode instead.\n Some of the things that are blocking me: - multi-vterm refuses to work. It just says that it cannot find vterm-mode. vterm works, so the mode is there but nope - vterm keeps on scrolling down to the prompt, making going through logs or things like that impossible - LSP seems to be unable to find my .venv and use the pyright inside, even when I start it from the shell\n It is possible that I am 'holding it the wrong way' but I am not ready to change my full workflow for this.\n This is not a complain, just a post so people see what it is if you are not an expert - Google shows no solutions to these issues, no matter what I do and I don't have the time to fix them. I understand that Emacs is more of a 'here are the parts, put them together in any way you want' but that same approach, while mitigated by distributions like Spacemacs, make it way harder for people who need to get things done now, if you happen to hit any issues.\n    submitted by    /u/g_tb  \n [link]   [comments]",

My work is in Mechanical Engineering so its normally just about task management in the background while I have my CAE software & outlook in front. Work PC is windows and obviously I cannot change that. \n I discovered Emacs a few weeks ago, and its been rough trying to learn its systems since I have limited free time. I am really interested in org-mode, and the possibility of not only task management, but interlocking its systems with email, IRC (and therefore slack/discord), maybe learning VIM keybinds, etc but I really have no interest in using it as a coding interface, or in writing academic papers.\n Is emacs right for my use case?\n    submitted by    /u/kingnickolas  \n [link]   [comments]",

(defvar-keymap my/code-keymap \"d\" #'xref-find-definitions ) \n (defvar-keymap my/lsp-code-keymap \"d\" #'lsp-find-definition \"i\" #'lsp-find-implementation ) \n (defvar-keymap my/leader-keymap \".\" #'find-file \"/\" #'consult-ripgrep \"g\" #'magit \":\" #'consult-mode-command \"Q\" #'ave-buffers-kill-terminal\n \"f\" my/file-keymap \"p\" my/project-keymap \"w\" my/window-keymap \"b\" my/buffer-keymap \"r\" my/rings-and-regs-keymap \"e\" my/edit-keymap \"!\" my/error-keymap \"i\" my/insert-keymap \"t\" my/toggle-keymap \"c\" my/code-keymap ) \n (unbind-key \"SPC\" evil-motion-state-map) (bind-key \"SPC\" my/leader-keymap evil-motion-state-map)\n (add-hook 'lsp-mode-hook (lambda () (make-local-variable 'my/leader-keymap) (bind-key \"c\" my/lsp-code-keymap my/leader-keymap)) )\n ```\n Here I replace my-code-keymap with my-lsp-code-keymap if I am in an lsp-mode buffer. This nearly works, but making the keymap buffer-local doesn't seem to work. Thus once lsp-mode is turned on in any buffer, all buffers have their code keymap replaced. \n What I don't want to do:\n ``` (defvar-keymap my/not-wanted-lsp-code-keymap \"d\" (lambda () (if lsp-mode (call-interactively #'lsp-find-definition) (call-interactively #'lsp-find-definition)))\n \"i\" (lambda () (if lsp-mode (call-interactively #'lsp-find-definition) (message \"lsp is not available\"))) ) \n ```\n I want to avoid binding keys to some function that checks if lsp is bound and runs the appropriate command. This is because I don't want which-key showing the \"SPC c i\" option in non lsp buffers since it doesn't do anything because lsp is not available.\n Can keybindings even be buffer-local?\n I would appreciate examples of how this is handled in your config.\n    submitted by    /u/SaltyTranslator402  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "This is something that has bothered me for many years now, but I was always too lazy to dig in. Well, this time I'm at least not too lazy to ask:\n Is there a way to make Emacs buffer ordering be per-window and remembered separately for each window?\n The way I work is using eyebrowse to create \"screens\" or \"workspaces\" (I used escreen before eyebrowse, a long time ago). Each of these is usually further separated into windows. That means that certain buffers naturally end up \"belonging\" in certain workspaces. For example, my Clojure REPL always lives in screen 4.\n This setup is great, but the way buffer switching works doesn't play nice with it. If I jump from screen 1 to screen 4 and back to 1, my previous buffer will be my REPL, which is not what I want. Screen 1, and more specifically, the window in that screen that I'm working in, should remember which buffers were used in it recently, so that I can use previous-buffer/next-buffer predictably.\n I think I would expect all other buffers (ones not visited in that window) to be appended at the end, as I don't want to limit myself. I might want to switch to some of those some day.\n Does something like this exist? Is it possible at all?\n    submitted by    /u/jwr  \n [link]   [comments]",

Was using NValt some time ago, but it's become grossly outdated and unstable.\nI love the idea behind The Archive and its implementation is both visually and conceptually appealing. However, I've discovered a couple of issues with it:\nThe most annoying one is when I get past one page of writing text in a note - in a particularly long paragraph, the frame starts jolting every time I press \"Space\" - scrolling quickly down and up, until I start a new paragraph, and then this behaviour disappears. It might be that this problem has already been reported, but I could not find it in the forum - perhaps I was using wrong keywords.\nAnother issue is with the displaying of the Cyrillic letter \"и\" (which roughly corresponds to the Latin \"i\" as in the word \"Tim\") - for some reason, occasionally it starts to be displayed with a different background to the rest of the text - as if there was a rectangle behind it. I didn't have enough play with different fonts and themes (using PrettyFunctional with Dark mode and the UbuntuMono-Regular 20.0 pt. at the moment)\nI hope someone can advise me on how to overcome the above issues, thank you!",

Here comes a lot of bla-bla, just skip to the Itaic part: I summarised the introduction to the Zettelkasten (this -> °Link°) to get an overview etc. and used 1700 words, but i think thats to much especially if I took a look at the Luhmanns Archive. I worked like with a Word document, so I made different headings and summarised different chapters of the text under them. (I copied a lot although you're not supposed to do that)\nSo: how long should the different note types (literature and permanent) be, what should they contain and how many should I make on a certain topic or source?

Since then I always want to have a systematic study on how to prevent complications, plan my diet and exercises.\nI just need to figure out where to begin all this.\nMy current plan is to use the DK's Diabete's Handbook as a lead-in, which I hope could give me a systematic overview, and then I plan to add more articles and books to each part of the topic.\nThen I start my plan last week by reading the handbook,  but I notice I have no idea how to read a book. I admit it indeed sounds silly. I was a good student when I was in the college. Now I'm not. I don't know what to do when I go through each line, paragraph on the page.\nSo I'm wondering if anyone could share a realistic approach to read a book/books/article.

          "description": "Hello!\nYesterday, I experienced a situation that I'm surprised I didn't notice before.\nWhen we use object tags, we seek to identify the objects interacting in a note's main argument. However, there are times when those objects may refer to qualities one may or may not have.\nFor example, let's imagine I have two different notes where I explain the following ideas:\n(1) Being too strict causes problems\nIn note (1), we could identify the object tag #strict. While in note (2), we could identify #relaxed as an object tag. However, the important point is that this decision is arbitrary. I could perfectly well have written the notes as follows:\n(1a) Being too strict causes problems\nor\n(1b) Being not enough relaxed causes problems\nIn notes (1a) and (2a), I would have identified #strict. In notes (1b) and (2b), I would have identified #relaxed. However, all notes talk about the same object idea: there is a right amount of strictness/relaxation that avoids problems.\nSo, my question is the following:\nHow would you handle this situation?\nDo I accept this arbitrariness and continue using both object tags?\nOr, do I try to find a way to avoid this arbitrariness?\n\nThe example I showed is a simplification of a text I am processing about Semantic Versioning: https://semver.org/\nThe paragraph that provoked this situation was the following:\n\n  \nIf the dependency specifications are too tight, you are in danger of version lock (the inability to upgrade a package without having to release new versions of every dependent package). If dependencies are specified too loosely, you will inevitably be bitten by version promiscuity (assuming compatibility with more future versions than is reasonable)\n\n\nUsing too tight or too loosely dependency specifications casues problems :-)",

Specifically, in the video above, it seems that elaborative encoding might not be as effective without the schema being represented well to the learner first when they are a novice.\nIt seems that a lot of the ideas around ZKM or just Zettelkasten more generally are heavily founded upon deep processing or elaborative encoding from a more constructivist flavor.\nI was wondering if there was more of a need for worked examples as one develops knowledge within their ZK and even as one works on getting better at the method itself (ZKM).\nWould love to hear if any others have thoughts on this.\nNote: I know that Math is focused on this video. But, it seems to me that zettling is a practice/skill. And, even a lot of what we develop within the ZK should be able to used in some skill. So, worked examples seems relevant. Feel free to pick at that assumption too!",

          "description": "TL;DR: LLMs are unreliable, but oh my, this unreliable?!?\nI have been working through a beautiful (and funny!) book, A.C. Grayling's \"The History of Philosophy\" (2019). My main interest has been the ideas therein and less biography, but I decided to have a note each for the major philosophers I care about, and started using Claude 3 Opus (the latest model from Anthropic, claimed to be GPT-4 level) for just the biography part. What could possibly go wrong?!?\nWell, in the dozen philosophers I have had Claude write a short bio for, maybe nothing wrong was seen. But then, I am hardly an expert on Thales (born around 624 BC) so wouldn't have spotted a small lie here or there.\nSo I asked it to write a biographical note for someone I know well --- me. The results were horrendous. I report them in full detail (with correction) here: https://amahabal.substack.com/p/dissecting-the-people-make-errors (as part of the bigger question in response to someone saying \"but people make errors, too!\").\nBeware!",
