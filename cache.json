          "description": "Seeing people publishing their Tic Tac Toe games here, I decided to show my fully functional, documented, local 3D chess game written in Haskell. A quick glance at the software stack and features:\n  \nVulkan for the rendering.\n The package effectful to keep the game logic independent from orthogonal aspects like logging, window handling, memory management and debugging.\n The package apecs for the overall game architecture.\n GLTF for importing 3D models from Blender.\n Features include moving pieces, 3D rotation, smooth zooming, a skybox, lighting and jumping knights :-)\n  \nAs you will recognize in the linked repository, the chess game is merely a running example of a larger endeavour: while implementing the game, I separated the reusable parts of the game into separate packages. The result of this process is hagato (Haskell Gamedev Toolkit), a collection of loosely coupled, easily combinable sub-libraries which can be used or ignored as desired, thus allowing developers to select features and technologies at will while remaining in full control of the overall game architecture. It makes use of the new cabal feature which allows one to put multiple public libraries into a single package.\n I published some additional packages on Hackage while implementing the game: apecs-effectful for integrating apecs into effectul, resource-effectful for managing resources in effectful, and chessica which implements the pure chess logic used in the 3D game.\n However, the chess game was just a testbed, to be honest. My overall goal is to use hagato now to implement the game I wanted to build in the first place, but I cannot share any details yet.\n    submitted by    /u/typedbyte  \n [link]   [comments]",

The corresponding functor laws are:\n traverse pure = pure -- purity law traverse (f <=< g) = traverse f <=< traverse g \n The paper An Investigation of the Laws of Traversals proves the latter law, but only when the monad is commutative, which suggests that this doesn't hold in general.

As far as I can see, there is no way to tell, from the docs alone, that this type is a re-export of Prelude.IO.

Haskell allows you to declare nominal types, e.g. newtype Age = Age Int or newtype Count = Count Int. Now those two types should be represented by distinct objects in Hask. There is, of course, an isomorphism between them.\n But how would one distinguish which one is which?\n If we want to represent all possible Haskell types, should we have an infinite number of objects structurally equivalent to Int, because each one could represent a different possible name?\n One approach would be to define Haskell types as pairs of objects from Hask with objects in a separate category of names.\n But then how would you enforce the fact that one name can be used for at most one type?

Personally, I feel much less inspired to be involved, because even modest changes require a huge amount of make-work on top of the actual labor involved to make the change.\n Thus why I'm writing this as a reddit post rather than going through the proposal process---if anyone is inspired by these, please feel free to take the ball and run with it!\n  \nMeta-issues aside, proposal #165 was just announced here, wanting to add an obviously-good function to base. Why does this have to be a proposal, instead of just a PR? There are the \"how should we implement this function\" concerns, which a PR can tackle, and then the \"let's make sure we don't break every downstream user.\"\n The latter is the concern of the community, but it ought not be; why don't we just add compiler support to prevent this from happening? Thus, my proposal:\n GHC should not emit ambiguous usage errors for functions that shadow ones defined in base. Instead, just use the non-base one, emit a warning saying \"hey, sorry!\" and be done with it. If you want the current behavior, promote the warning to an error via -Werror=....\n Now we can freely add to base without requiring any would-be contributor to build all of stackage and perform a breakage analysis.\n    submitted by    /u/isovector  \n [link]   [comments]",

What was the logic behind it?Map comes from functor, but what about the others and how to generalize the idea of the original people that set this up.Thank you very much for your time\n Edit: a person on 4chan directed me to the MapReduce programming model. Apparently, it was not the exact origin because they got the idea from Lisp:\n https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MapReduce#cite_note-map-5\n Lisp developed map as part of their goal to create list programs (unbounded arguments functions). They implemented, as part of that, recursion and functionals (functions that take functions as arguments). map was part of that:\n http://jmc.stanford.edu/articles/lisp.html \n And reduce and filter are called catamorphism now. So that would be the track to figure out the origin and to generalize the concept.\n https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3540543961\\_7 \n Thank you !\n    submitted by    /u/HamzaM3  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "What's a good solution for making interactive web animations using Haskell? I want to be able to animate reduction graphs and include math symbols.\n The interactivity could be as simple as slowing/speeding the animation, and allowing for automatic \"stop points\", like a slide show. Or it could go as far as to allow the content to be dynamically generated by user input. And perhaps people could click on graph nodes and see them expand.\n Reanimate sounds almost ideal, with its support for LaTeX. But unfortunately, it is all rendered in batch, not providing for any interactivity.\n FRP solutions sound very attractive. But reflex seems to be stuck on the outdated GHCJS, and I haven't been able to get it to build (using macOS on Apple Silicon). The newer JS output in GHC doesn't yet have DOM support. And even if I used one of those, figuring out how to interact with a LaTeX renderer might be tricky.\n The diagrams library supports some animation, but it's limited, and the never-seems-to-be-arriving version 2.0 is supposed to replace the animation support with something new.\n Another closely related option is Purescript, which seems to have a few FRP libraries, but I'm not sure how well any of them will work for this application.\n Another option would be to use or interface with a JavaScript library that does interactive animations, such as paper.js or Greensock.\n I figure that depending on the animation, pre-rendering some content may be desirable for performance, and that could be tricky.\n I'm leaning toward using Reanimate because, even though I have to give up on interactivity, it seems to have excellent support for LaTeX integration. So it's probably easiest for prototyping, and I could switch to some other toolset later once I know what I want it to look like.\n    submitted by    /u/qseep  \n [link]   [comments]",

However, not all combinations of these three are valid. For example, a coin with denomination GR1 from the year 1923 could only have come from the Warsaw mint. On the other hand, the same denomination in a different year might belong to the Paris mint.\n My initial thought was to enforce these constraints using a smart constructor, but since this is a pet project aimed at learning, I would prefer to check it at compile time if possible.\n Here's the model I've come up with so far:\n data Denomination = ZL10 | ZL5 | ZL2 | ZL1 | GR50 | GR20 | GR10 | GR5 | GR2 | GR1 deriving (Eq, Ord, Bounded, Enum) data Mint = Warsaw | Paris | Birmingham deriving (Eq, Show, Bounded, Enum) type family OneOf xs where OneOf '[] = Not IdPred OneOf (x : xs) = Or (EqualTo x) (OneOf xs) type Years a = Refined (OneOf a) Year newtype Year = Year {getYear :: Int} deriving (Eq, Ord, Num, TextShow, Show, Lift) type GR1EmissionYears = Years '[1923, 1925, 1927, 1928, 1930, 1931, 1932, 1933, 1934, 1935, 1936, 1937, 1938, 1939] type GR2EmissionYears = Years '[1931, 1932, 1933, 1934, 1935, 1937, 1938, 1939] type GR5EmissionYears = Years '[1923, 1925, 1927, 1928, 1930, 1931, 1932, 1933, 1934, 1935, 1936, 1937, 1938, 1939] -- [...] \n I could of course glue it all into a single union type, listing all the cases explicitly:\n data Coins = Gr1Warsaw1937 | Gr1Paris1937 | Gr1Paris1939 - ... \n But that will make it quite hard to e.g. filter and extract all coins of year 1937.\n I'm wondering if anyone has any thoughts on how to approach this problem.

I've spent already 6 days and I don't get it still\n for example:(fmap . fmap) (const 'h') [Just \"huy\",Nothing,Just \"huyhuy\"]\n I've understood how we get the final type\n Here it is:\n (.) :: ((g x -> g y) -> (f (g x) -> f (g y))) -> ((x -> y) -> (g x -> g y)) -> (x -> y) -> (f (g x) -> f (g y)) fmap . fmap :: (x -> y) -> f (g x) -> f (g y) (fmap . fmap) (const 'h') :: (b -> Char) -> f (g b) -> f (g Char) (fmap . fmap) (const 'h') [Just \"huy\",Nothing,Just \"huyhuy\"] -- -- :: List (Maybe String) -> List (Maybe Char) \n Here is a full signature\n (fmap . fmap) (const 'h') [Just \"huy\",Nothing,Just \"huyhuy\"] -- :: ((Maybe String -> Maybe Char) -> (List (Maybe String) -> List (Maybe Char))) -> ((String -> Char) -> (Maybe String -> Maybe Char)) -> (String -> Char) -> (List (Maybe String) -> List (Maybe Char)) \n But not I'm trying to understand how it evaluates\n As I understood, composition will apply first and we get this:\n (.) fmap fmap = \\x -> fmap (fmap x) \n Then we apply const 'h' like this\n fmap (fmap const 'h') fmap (fmap (const ‘h’)) [UPDATED] \n And then we wait for our list, so inner fmap will evaluate first, right? Like this:\n fmap f lms case lms of [] -> [] (x:xs) -> const 'h' Just \"huy\" : map f xs -- 'p' (x:xs) -> const 'p' Nothing : map f xs -- 'p' (x:xs) -> const 'p' Just \"woohoo\" : map f xs -- 'p' [] -> [] -- 'p':'p':'p':[] -- \"ppp\" \n Am I right?

Unfortionately, there are no tutorials for the tool, and to run the code you have to copy it into a haskell file and run it locally on your machine. :( \n Anyways, if you like the tool, or have any comments, suggestions or improvements feel free to comment them below or answer this anonymous feedback form here: https://forms.office.com/e/nd6sJ3Gq0U \n Any and all commments with be tremendous help to my project, but also Im just proud of this language and want others to see it :)\n    submitted by    /u/d1r3w00lf  \n [link]   [comments]",

That's all my experience with Haskell. And having experience working with Typescript, which has a lot of really cool typing features, I'm wondering if one can replicate them in Haskell. Specifically, my question is about type mappings and conditional types. In Typescript, one can define an interface (basically, a record type):\n ```ts interface Person { name: string; age: number; married: boolean; }\n interface Profile extends Person { friends: Array<Person>; job: { title: string; salary: number; onVacation: boolean; }; } ```\n And then it's possible to create a new type out of this one by recursively replacing all numbers and boolean with strings:\n ```ts // This type gets a type argument T and recursively replaces all its boolean and number fields with strings type AllStrings<T> = { [Key in keyof T]: T[Key] extends number ? string : T[Key] extends boolean ? string : AllStrings<T[Key]>; };\n function parseBadJSON(badJSON: AllStrings<Profile>): Profile { // mapping logic } ```\n Moreover, you can see record type inheritance with extends keyword.\n I had a task at my job where I needed to parse a JSON that stores all values as strings, and I needed to map it to a JSON with numbers and booleans, where they were supposed to be, so that's how I achieved the correct typings for my mapping function (parseBadJSON).

I then installed everything else haskell related using ghcup (stack, cabal, ghc, and hls). When I then started working on my assignment the code had some imports like Random and HUnit. So in order to get that to work I tried to install those using Cabal. At this point I noticed that I also needed llvm so I installed llvm@13 using brew and added the path to $PATH. I then did cabal install --lib random and it worked! However, I have found out that this is probably no the preferred way of using cabal and I wanted to switch to a stack project which leads me to my question.\n Is there a good way to remove this libraries that I installed? I have found that the files are installed in the .cabal/store/ghc-8.10.7. In this folder I have HUnt-1.6.2.0-18526221 and rndm-1.2.1.1-c70f7c08. Can I just remove those files? Or is there a better way to do it? I basically do not want random and HUnit to be installed for every Haskell projekt I'm working on moving forward. Some noteworthy things might be that when I do cabal list --installed they don't show, but I can compile the code without any issues.\n I hope I was able to explain my issue and appreciate any help I can get.

          "description": "Hi all,\n I created scala-sbt-codespaces-template — a GitHub repository template for Scala 3 development in GitHub Codespaces. 🙂\n The repository gives you a minimal sbt project, ready to be extended, within a fully-fledged, cloud-based development environment at one click. All you have to do is create a new repository based on this template repository (or alternatively fork it) and click “Create codespace on main”, that’s it.\n Such Codespaces template repositories exist for many languages, but I couldn’t find one for Scala. The repository is so simple and small that I wasn’t sure whether I should even post this here, but maybe it comes in handy for some of you.\n If you do give it a spin, please let me know what you think and what should be improved/added.\n All the best\n Lucas\n EDIT: Following u/BrilliantArmadillo64’s suggestion, I renamed the repo to reflect that it’s sbt-based.\n    submitted by    /u/typeduke  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi everybody,\n The Scala tooling is a common complain within the community, lately, we have been lucky to get more and better tools, like scala-cli, metals, etc.\n Time ago, I had to do some work with js where I was able to try Vercel/Netlify, those tools are super handy, for example, Vercel allows to deploy js projects that use next.js with minimal effort, also, it provides Preview Environments to each Pull Request, this is something that I really wanted to get in Scala.\n Last year I started building a similar tool (https://codepreview.io), as of now, it only supports Preview Environments, still, different to Vercel, codepreview actually let's you try the whole application, imagine a scala backend, scala.js frontend, postgres database, all of them packaged as a temporal app on every Pull Request (with it's unique domain).\n It's been a few months since we have been using codepreview on internal projects + a few customer projects, so far, the feedback has been good.\n Unfortunately, the project isn't as nice as Vercel, it would be lovely to get this installed with a few clicks like Vercel does, instead, I need to do a few manual steps for every project. Besides this, there are also some other improvements to make but I'm not fully confident on what to prioritize. Which is why I'm coming here to ask for help.\n My offering is, I'll grant a trial/free license to whoever is willing to give codepreview a try, I'd only ask for feedback, which should help me to prioritize the future work.\n So far, we have been working mainly with projects that use https://github.com/sbt/sbt-native-packager, still, projects building fat jars should also work smoothly.\n Thanks.\n    submitted by    /u/AlexITC  \n [link]   [comments]",

We moved from IntelliJ to VSCode + Metals a while back because of the lack of Scala 3 support in IntelliJ. But I'm having serious problems with the debugger, to me it's nearly worthless. It can't do the simplest things, like just step over code, it jumps to what feel like totally random places deep in the ZIO codebase. The only way I can get it to sometimes work is by using {} brackets so that I can put pure Scala code, no ZIO's, on their own lines, and only break there. Then run from break point to break point, stepping is essentially useless.\n Is it just me, or are others having the same experience? Any good tips, or workarounds? Has IntelliJ started to catch up with Scala 3 support?

          "description": "Recently I have been looking at alternatives to Unity3d for gamedev. As part of this I created a very simple hex-based tic-tac-toe game using Scala.js and the 3d library Babylon.js. It also uses Vite.js for quick dev turnaround, Electron.js for native packaging, and ScalablyTyped to create a Babylon.js facade.\n I was quite happy with the result. It was especially nice to program in Scala again (after a long break) and be able to imagine using it for both client and server code. Now I need to consider whether it is right for me, as there are a number of business issues around using Javascript, but at least the technical side seems possible.\n Since there were a few pains getting all the different libraries to play nicely together, I thought the result may be useful to other people. No tutorial, but my notes are in the README and the code is all available on Github. Be aware I am not a Scala expert, but the code works as far as I have tested it.\n I broke the code into a few pieces for libs for possible reuse, or other people to look to for ideas\n  \nHexTacToe https://github.com/jarrahtech/HexTacToe - the game itself\n kassite https://github.com/jarrahtech/kassite - Scala.js for (hopefully) functionality common to multiple Scala.js/Babylon.js games - currently has tweening and some shader material stuff. No tests yet - need to work on that\n babylonjsfacade https://github.com/jarrahtech/babylonjsfacade - Scala.js facade of Babylon.js 6.2 (generated within the Github project by ScalablyTyped). I made this a separate project so that the others didn't need to import and build it (as it is quite large)\n  \nalso a couple of other libs which are less important for demonstrating the technologies:\n  \nhex https://github.com/jarrahtech/hex - Scala/Scala.js cross-building hex grid library\n jarrah-util https://github.com/jarrahtech/jarrah-util - Scala/Scala.js cross-building common game code/maths lib\n  \nHope its helpful for someone else,\n Charles.\n    submitted by    /u/cordinc  \n [link]   [comments]",

In fact, some seem to say it is declining, and the numbers might bear that theory out somewhat.\n But most things I've read about the language are absolutely awesome!\n Two of the main problems I have heard are:\n  \nToo much change. Apparently the leap to Scala 3 was a little rushed and tooling is still catching up. This has left companies with a choice of either using legacy or investing in something that keeps changing.\n Too much power. It almost seems as though the power of Scala is limitless. Most articles I've read list a huge reel of concepts. Some of the ones that I can recognise seem powerful to the point of abusability, like metaprogramming. This also makes the language harder to learn.\n  \nPotential intervention to address criticisms:\n  \nA promise to freeze changes to the language and other core parts for a period of, say, three years (exempting bug fixes).\n  \nWhat do you think?

          "description": "Hello everyone,\n In my team we do use zio quite a bit in our codebase, usually with for-comprehensions. I just discovered the zio-direct project and it looks promising. The direct coding style can be a lot simpler to work with and more familiar to folks who are new to FP. I was wondering what has been people's experience with moving to zio-direct. What worked well and what didn't? Any gotchas one needs to be aware of? What are some reasons moving to zio-direct might be a bad idea?\n Thanks\n    submitted by    /u/lazy-lambda  \n [link]   [comments]",

What I understand is the developer should own his own company so that the contracts is between the two businesses ie the client and the developer. And in some cases there's a talent recruitment firm in the middle. \n My question is does the job application process differ from normal employment job offers. \n Does the job application require you to apply as a business or individual say my company is scalaconsults. \n What if you are a 3 man outfit. All partners in your business, can you still apply for such job contracts. How does the interview process go now that you are more than one.\n Incase of b2b scala jobs on linkedin where do I show that this is my business, this is my crew, this is what I've done. Coz on linkedin it seems like an individual process not business.\n Once your employed can you subcontract the work.\n Sorry for the many questions.

For example, the documentation for my purescript-tecton library can be found at purescri.pt/tecton. Accordingly, PureScript Domains is now PureScript Domain (although previously-registered subdomains remain active).\n Second, a purescri.pt URL will automatically be activated for any package added to purescri.pt/registry. By default, it will redirect to the corresponding GitHub repository, but you can change this behavior or opt out through a simple pull request.\n If you would like to participate, please visit purescri.pt for details.\n Thanks for reading!\n    submitted by    /u/nsaunders1  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Usually org-mode manual is pretty exhaustive and very useful source of information. However it doesn’t offer an exhaustive list of all build-in properties, nor detail if and in what form they can be overwritten by user, and what happens if user so does anyway.\n This kind of list is the exact thing I am trying to parse together for myself. My current strategy is using the add propety function which lists all available properties, the Reserved Properties -listing under Properties section, which offers a glossary explanation of individual properties, and searching the Index for word ‘Property’, and once I find a new link, I visit it and hopefully find other properties near it.\n However, this is pretty slow way to gather the list, and it doesn’t really distinguish between useful properties, properties user can use if they want, and system-breaking properties.\n Usually better documentation is written in the relevant chapter of the manual, if the property is intended to be used.\n Has anyone written about this online? I found some youtube videos discussing some of the properties related to clocking, but generally it seems this information is written from the opposite direction from my approach: from usecase to property, not from property to usecase.\n I don’t have any good reasoning behind wanting this information. I just want to write it down in my notes, and while doing it gain some insight into org-mode as a system.\n What I mean by system breaking is something like CLOCKSUM_T. I haven’t yet tested the behaviour, but as this is used to calculate todays clocked time for a heading and it’s children, it is very clear that either the users input is overwritten, or the clocksum is inaccurate. This might not be strictly system-breaking, but neither does it make sense inside the system.\n    submitted by    /u/stepbroImstuck_in_SU  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm particularly interested in hearing how others utilize org-roam in their workflows.\n I've developed a system where I create index pages for each major subject. These org-roam files are tagged with :index: and usually left empty. \n For instance, if I were learning Python, I'd create three index pages: Python, Theory, and Examples, with the last two having backlinks for the first one.\n When I take notes related to a particular subject, I create a new note and insert a backlink to the corresponding index page. This way, when I need to find a specific note, I can simply visit one of the index pages and review its backlinks, instead of trying to remember what name i gave to the specific note.\n While this method has been somewhat effective for me, I'm wondering if there might be a more efficient or more organized way to approach this. I'd love to hear about any tips, tricks, or workflows you use in org-roam when learning new topics.\n Thanks\n    submitted by    /u/jenescript  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I may be missing something stupid. When I put links in Org-mode files they appear normally, i.e. the whole [[/link][caption]] thing is hidden and I just see the caption with an underline, can click on it, etc.\n I also have my Emacs configured (somehow) to color characters overflowing my fill-column something jarring, and I usually use auto-fill-mode and have no problems with that.\n For example if I have fill-column set to 3 and have a line abcde, de will be colored to mark they're over the line limit.\n However, it seems that whatever's coloring my isn't taking into account what Org-mode does to hide links. So if I have a link [[/link][caption]] which has 18 characters in its raw form but only 7 (caption) are getting displayed, those 7 characters count as 18 characters towards the line limit!\n For example if I have fill-column set to 20 and have a line [[/link][caption]] foo, I expected to see no characters marked as over the limit because I'm seeing just caption foo, but in fact the final oo are marked as over the limit because in that regard it counts as a 22-character line.\n Sorry for the verbose explanation. Does anyone have a solution for this? I could make the color less jarring but this is lowkey driving me crazy.\n    submitted by    /u/edenworky  \n [link]   [comments]",

Now, I am using doom emacs with the :tools editorconfig setting. All works when I open .cpp and .py files. But, when I am editing and org file, and I use org babel to edit a cpp file, the editor config settings are not read when I use ctrl-c ctrl-' to edit the file.

Sometimes I have internet, sometimes I'm on a vpn that blocks package downloads, and sometimes I don't have access to internet at all. This makes it difficult to download and install the Emacs packages I normally use through melpa and elpa. I'd like to version control my .emacs.d for when I have internet access, and keep it on a thumbdrive when I don't. \n But I'm not entirely sure what the best way to go about this is portably. Do I just \n  \nCreate a folder called offline-packages\n Download each package I use from git\n add this line to my .emacs.d? (add-to-list 'load-path \"~/.emacs.d/offline-packages/my_package\")\n  \n(require 'my_package)\n Can I just do git add elpaand just commit the entire folder under version control?

          "description": "TLDR: side windows are awesome, you should use them.\n A while ago I posted https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/12jfsan/fixed_window_layout_like_cedet/ and got a reference to https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/demystifying-emacs-window-manager - and that has been life-changing. I've ordered the book purely to appreciate the insights in this article. I'm of course convinced I will find a lot of good stuff in it, but I haven't even began digging into it. But I did create the following little snippet that has in the last 24h already improved my quality of life significantly:\n ``` (setq switch-to-buffer-obey-display-actions t) ;; Introduce a bottom side window that catches ;; compilations, deadgreps etc. (add-to-list 'display-buffer-alist '(\"\\deadgrep.\\|\\Compilation\\\" (display-buffer-in-side-window) (side . bottom) (slot . 0) (window-parameters (no-delete-other-windows . t))))\n (defun deets/side-window-resize (enlarge) (let ((bottom-windows (window-at-side-list (window-normalize-frame nil) 'bottom))) (dolist (window bottom-windows) (when (symbolp (window-parameter window 'window-side)) (if enlarge (window-resize window (window-height window)) (window-resize window (- (/ (window-height window) 2))))))))\n (defun deets/side-window-toggle (arg) (interactive \"P\") (cond ((null arg) (window-toggle-side-windows)) ((listp arg) (deets/side-window-resize t)) ((symbolp arg) (deets/side-window-resize nil))))\n ;; Remove our side-windows (global-set-key (read-kbd-macro \"C-x w\") 'deets/side-window-toggle) ```\n When compiling or grepping, the window is placed a the bottom. I can quickly enlarge/shrink the window, and toggle it. Very happy with this, and I'm already thinking about further improvements.\n    submitted by    /u/__deeetz__  \n [link]   [comments]",

So do these two keybindings have different functionality in different contexts, or are they always the same? Because why have two enabled by default?

          "description": "Hey guys,\n I'm very new to Emacs so bear with me..\n I've been using ESS at work to run my R code in Emacs, and it usually works very well (apart from lsp/eglot and flycheck being very slow). However when I run a large amount of R code using polymode-eval-buffer or similar, the code will run, however I will be unable to interact with Emacs the whole time, mousing over Emacs shows the windows loading symbol as my cursor, but doesn't say \"not responding\". The file isn't particularly long, ~800 lines, and if I run it in two halves using polymode-eval-buffer-from-point-to-end or polymode-eval-buffer-from-beg-to-point it works as expected.\n The code takes a long time to run, loading in a couple million spatial points and doing stuff with them, which I'm sure is the main reason it happens, but running this code in Rstudio doesn't freeze it!\n I've read online in various places that setting ess-eval-visibly to nil or nowait solves some peoples issues, but doesn't change anything for me...\n Thanks for any help you guys can give!\n    submitted by    /u/bepppi  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Microsoft Access has a few virtues, like being a desktop app and rather robust in its ability to customize (by Microsoft standards). At its most basic, it will read from and write to a database, usually through Forms that have been customized to display certain information from a database in a certain layout. And because it works with one source of truth (e.g., it can connect to SQL and PostgreSQL databases), multiplayer data entry and collaboration is more feasible than in a purely plain text method being shared by a syncing service.\n The problem is, Microsoft Access is one sin shy of being the devil. It’s proprietary and buggy, and coding in VBA is a nightmare compared to most languages, especially our beloved elisp. Someone said MS Access is the best worst way to make a database program, and I think that sums it up well.\n I know emacs can interface with SQL databases, but are there any packages that try to accomplish something like Microsoft Access, i.e., rapid application development via forms that display and allow editing certain fields from a database? If not, what would be the best practices in building this functionality?\n    submitted by    /u/jMilton13  \n [link]   [comments]",

Yesterday I set up Syncthing to synchronize that folder between all of my computers.

I've managed to get LSP working for js/jsx.\n LSP provides autocomplete functionality: once I start typing out a js keyword, LSP gives me completion candidates. Things look like this:\n https://i.imgur.com/4heaW4J.png\n What you can see *beneath* the list of LSP auto-completion candidates is a list of candidates produced by auto-complete-mode. \n So if I hit 'tab', I get completion for the auto-complete-mode candidate. Not the currently-selected LSP candidate. \n This is frustrating as hell. I can work around it manually, but that adds a cognitive tax that I'd rather live without. \n Now, I could disable auto-complete-mode.

(my-org-mode mode with a keymap containing \"C-c a\"). I can add a hook for org-mode to also enable my-org-mode, and on change-major-mode hook to disable my-org-mode.\n Then I could make this mode have higher precedence than org-mode using 'emulation-mode-map-alists. (Basically what this is saying but for every mode I define bindings for)\n Could do the same for a \"global map\" that will have lower precedence than the mode-specific ones.\n Then for the bindings I don't define it should \"just work\".\n Is this a decent idea for trying to achieve what I want or am I way overcomplicating this?\n Also are there any packages that could help me do this or do I have to code it up myself.

No layout list, but layout-switch with vertico more or less covers it.\n The problem with that one is it doesn't seem to save/restore the location for each window..\n ex: If I make a layout which is split into a top and bottom window A and B, with code on top and an org file on bottom, and then switch to some other layout.. and then back, it'll prooperly restore the window layout for A and B and bcak to those files... great! HOWEVER, if A and B are the same file, but different locations within it, that doesn't work.. both windows A and B will switch to the same file, the same position within it. \n I guess I could look into saving window layouts to registers and popping around that way, but I was sure there was a more sophisticated way of doing it.\n (I forget if Bufler does this .. I use filetree as my buffer-list replacement, and bufler doesn't work well when Tramp with remote sessions are alive.. so I've generally ignored Bufler the last year or two.)\n Thanks for reading :)\n    submitted by    /u/FrozenOnPluto  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "For those of you using Python with a language server: do you install the language server (e.g. pyright or pylsp) globally, or in the virtual environment (e.g. as a developer dependency)? Why?\n Personally I am still not sure what I think is better. Installing a language server in each venv seems a bit of overkill, especially since I am always going to use the same language server and the people I work with on Python projects don't need the (same) language server (as they use something like VSCode with Pylance). \n On the other hand, installing the language server in the venv saves me a bit of work creating the relevant config files to ensure they run the commands with the right binary (e.g. I don't need to create a mypy.ini files to ensure mypy runs from the venv, nor do I need a pyrightconfig.json to point the server to the venv).\n I found a way to get both pyright and pylsp working on Emacs, whether they are globally installed or installed in the venv.

          "description": "I need a piece of elisp that would return the project name for the buffer at point. Seems simple, right? The problem is, I can't find a way to do this reliably. Let me explain.\n If I have a dir structure like this:\n . ├── projects ├── proyecto-uno ├── .git ├── readme.org ├── proyecto-dos ├── proyecto-tres \n And the current buffer is readme.org, getting the project name - 'proyecto-uno' is fairly easy, if you're using projectile, you can do (projectile-project-name), right? Alternatively, you can use: (magit-toplevel), which returns full path, i.e., ~/projects/proyecto-uno/ and then you can just grab the last segment.\n Now, it gets tricky when you're using git-worktrees and the structure of the project is like this:\n . ├── projects ├── proyecto-uno ├── .git ├── readme.org ├── proyecto-dos ├── .bare ├── master ├── development ├── .git ├── readme2.org ├── proyecto-tres \n The current buffer is readme2.org. How do you get the project name? (projectile-project-name) returns development (and I want 'proyecto-dos'). (magit-toplevel) returns full path to \"development\" dir not to 'proyecto-dos'. \n So then you may suggest, why don't you check, if the buffer is inside a worktree? And that I don't know how to. I assumed I could use (magit-inside-worktree-p), but it always returns t, regardless of where it's called from, readme2.org, or from inside 'proyecto-uno' dir. \n So how do I find the project name reliably?\n    submitted by    /u/ilemming  \n [link]   [comments]",

Without the state juggling and flow control of transient, you cannot make the same level of expressive user interface.\n Some of the topics that get beyond the surface and require thinking about how you would use this software to build applications\n  \nFlow control\n History & state\n Custom infixes\n  \nIn particular you can also be forgiven for thinking custom infixes are some kind of crazy extensibility without much practical value. This is far from the truth. Attaching complex values to your user input command sentences and quickly modifying any part of these sentences allows you to express a lot of rich commands in a short time. That is the secret to the efficiency of magit, and magit doesn't even use very complex flow control. Infix overriding allows your interface to reflect and follow the state of the application.\n I'm not terribly incentivized to go beyond the showcase, which at worst contains working examples for just about every behavior. It is less complex code than magit and made of examples that demonstrate behavior in isolation.

Please read the launch announcement to learn more about what this release entails.\n The pilot projects (including Symex.el) are accepting financial contributions and will distribute them to sources of value including contributors and antecedent projects in a process that we all have a say in.\n We couldn't have gotten this far without the support and participation of this fantastic community, so thank you! I hope, with your help, that we'll manage to prove that non-adversarial economics is not only possible but much better in just every way, not least of which is bringing us together in creating value rather than pushing us apart as our world does today.\n I can't wait to see what we'll accomplish together!\n    submitted by    /u/iguanathesecond  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have just noticed that github has added an outline option (the right-most icon at the top of the file info), which might allow you to skip quickly through the increasingly large \"upgrading\" section.\n Do note this assumes some amount of knowledge about Getting Things Done, so that might turn out to be a blocker anyway :) \n The info file is here : https://github.com/Trevoke/org-gtd.el/blob/org-gtd-3/org-gtd.info And obviously you might want to download it and load it inside emacs with C-u h i. For the info file, in addition to questions about things that make sense and don't, I have questions about how things get displayed through the interface, what links make sense or are surprising, what is helpful, etc.\n If you choose to help, I'll be extremely grateful!

I like Edebug because it allows to follow the computation even in a single form, from the inside out. Like, given something like\n (+ 3 (/ 4 n))\n I can see exactly not only what n is, but also what are the intermediate results. The closest thing I found for now is Sly's stickers, but I wondered if there was an actual equivalent. Otherwise, I find CL's debugger a bit difficult to use in step-mode, but that could easily being me not having read the manual thoroughly. So, does a CL-Edebug exist, much like CIDER's for Clojure? And if not, can I use SLIME/Sly to step between forms (from inside out)?\n P.S., IIUC Sly is the improved (better?) version of SLIME.

This makes it much harder to search through the notes since I've to decrypt them each. So I was thinking if giving up the mix for having all the notes to be encrypted in one directory would fix that, like having all the notes encrypted by default but all of them also decrypt at once, so they become easier to search & query. But I don't know even how to do that, the best came to my mind is to encrypt the directory itself, but I also have no idea of how this can be done :P \n Any suggestions? \n p.s.

This adds a certain friction - you would need to think about the abbrev naming (can't freely use short names) and the importance/frequency of the abbrev.\n Instead, lam allows you to quickly define context specific abbrevs on the fly. The best part is that since abbrevs can execute elisp, you can do a lot more than just simple text expansions. \n Want to hear from you on how you use abbrevs and if this approach can open up new workflows for you.\n    submitted by    /u/chandergovind  \n [link]   [comments]",

My journey with Linux has led me to an insatiable desire for optimization, beginning with vim/neovim and permeating nearly every aspect of my digital life. I have hand-crafted scripts for everything. The only thing left is to unify my coding and writing experience in one place.\n I use vim for coding, and I'm very happy with it. However, when it comes to writing, the visual representation of equations and figures help me concentrate on content. While vimtex (a vim plugin) offers a solution for creating LaTeX-based PDFs, the fusion of code and text hinders my thought process. For me, writing on a computer has to be similar to putting pen on a paper, where the focus is on content, not on the representation. For this reason, I sought an alternative solution and my search led me to TeXmacs. Here's how my notes look. No ugly LaTex -- equations/figures look nice, etc.\n TeXmacs is nice and all, except that it's not vim. I can't use all of my fancy plugins (jump between files, write custom snippets, define custom actions, etc). It seems that emacs can be made just as powerful as vim, while also having the ability to display inline equations and images. This seems like the answer to all my questions, except that I only looking at the positives.

I see that this reddit is far more active, and there are likely to be many expert users of orgmode here. So hopefully someone can suggest a solution. Thank you.\n New to org mode (used it briefly about 8-10 years ago). It is great. However, I would find it more helpful if I could do the following. Please see the example below with checkboxes.\n * Question - [X] Box 1 Some notes on Box 1 about what to do, and follow up notes when it is done. - [X] Another Box: box 2 Some notes on box 2 about what to do, and follow up notes when it is done. \n When I check the boxes next to Box 1 and \"Another Box: box 2\" the lines \"Box 1\" and \"Another Box: box 2\" are grayed out (originally they are white when the boxes are not checked). This is great and I like that. However, the \"Some notes...when it is done\" are not grayed out even after the boxes are checked. They stay white. Is there an easy way to ensure that any notes below a checkbox are also grayed out when the checkbox is checked? Do I have to, or can I, mark it as notes or something else which would give this effect? Thank you.\n    submitted by    /u/thoughtful-curious  \n [link]   [comments]",

There's a hierarchical structure here, sort of like this:\n @anywhere @computer @work @home \n So from my agenda, I'd like to be able to filter for e.g. @work when I'm on my work computer, and have all tasks labeled as @anywhere, @computer, or @work show up. The problem is, org's Tag Hierarchy seems to work in the opposite way that I want; when I create a hierarchy like this:\n (setq org-tag-alist '((:startgrouptag) (\"@anywhere\") (:grouptags) (:startgrouptag) (\"@computer\") (:grouptags) (\"@work\") (\"@home\") (:endgrouptag) (:endgrouptag)) \n Then filter by e.g. @work, I only get @work-tagged entries. On the other hand, when I reverse the hierarchy like this:\n (setq org-tag-alist '((:startgrouptag) (\"@work\") (:grouptags) (\"@anywhere\") (\"@computer\") (:endgrouptag) (:startgrouptag) (\"@home\") (:grouptags) (\"@anywhere\") (\"@computer\") (:endgrouptag)) \n I can filter by @work or @home and get the results I want, however I can't filter by @computer and see all @work/@home/@computer/@anywhere-tagged entries. And, unfortunately, if I add a grouptag section for @computer, it includes children of that group in @work and @home now, corrupting those groups.\n So my question is: is there a better way to filter to include a child in a hierarchy OR its parents? FWIW I've also tried using the | operator in my filter query (e.g. @work|@anywhere) but org doesn't seem to parse it, and it does no filtering (it gives me a message like @work|@anywhere filter ignored because tag/category is not represented).\n ​\n (btw, I'm using doom emacs, in case that happens to be relevant here)\n    submitted by    /u/C-x_M-c_M-butterfly  \n [link]   [comments]",

I know they are powerful tools and I'd like to know what am i missing. \n I also know that maybe i do not really need them if i can't see their value, but I'm keen to know their strengths.\n    submitted by    /u/cidra_  \n [link]   [comments]",

Also, I don't want to think about whether to use org-copy-visible or evil-yank--99% of the time I just want to evil-yank and also don't want the emphasis markers copied to clipboard (e.g. copy paste to document or terminal).\n Basically:\n  \nShould rely on org-copy-visible which probably does a better job than trying to parse selected text using regex\n \nCustom function or overloading evil-yank only for org-mode where org-copy-visible is relevant.

But not always:\n  \nIf I launch emacs from a terminal (Gnome Terminal) and use my command or evaluate the form above, it works all right.\n If I do nohup emacs > /dev/null 2>&1 & so I can close the terminal from which I started Emacs, the command works until I close that terminal. After I close it, the command or the form do nothing.\n The normal way to use it for me is from an Emacs session started by a desktop file (I believe, because all this stuff is GUIed away. And also the real normal way for me would be to open a frame connected to a server session, but that's now utterly broken and matter for another post). When evaluated in such an instance, the terminal that opens is not very collaborative and says\n  \n bash: Error in ~/.profile.mine: directory ~/src/scripts/by_others not found.: No such file or directory bash: /usr/share/Modules/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/local/texlive/2022/bin/x86_64-linux:[more paths…]: No such file or directory bash: readlink: command not found...

Packages providing this file are: 'coreutils' 'coreutils-single' Install package 'ncurses' to provide command 'tput'? [N/y] \n Using my ignorance I guessed that the terminal that Emacs launches is somehow tied to the terminal that launched Emacs and that I don't know how to fix it.\n I know that I should report this to Gnome developers but you know that would be a waste of time.\n I'm on Emacs 30.0.50 (pure GTK build, in case it matters) and it was the same in v. 28.2.\n    submitted by    /u/tokujin  \n [link]   [comments]",

How about the source code of the interpreter for elisp and LAP?\n Q2. Are there any known semantic differences among interpreted elisp, interpreted bytecode, interpreted LAP, and native code?\n Q3. What's the current development of JIT compiler for elisp->LAP and for LAP->native? If the JIT compilation flow for elisp->native is finished, will bytecode and LAP be abandoned? If so, when will that happen?\n References\n  \n[1] \"LAP stands for Lisp Assembly Program. It is an internal representation of the bytecode instructions in a more symbolic form.

If Emacs reboots and the container is no longer there, project attempts to open the file in TRAMP, and TRAMP hangs until I press q to allow tramp to exit.\n I can think of two ways to hypothetically fix this:\n The first is by modifying the project-find-functions list. It's a list of functions which are ran in succession until one of them returns a truthy value. My current project-find-functions is (project-try-vc project-try-local). I believe in my case project-try-vc is returning t.\n The second is by telling TRAMP to move on after a failure, allowing the boot to complete even when some projects are not accessible. I'm thinking an advice might be necessary to achieve this.\n Are there any other options?

Perhaps mass exporting all my .org files as pdfs/epubs and then syncing them to my e-ink device.

I'd like to be able to change the bg/fg colors dynamically based on the current DOOM theme. \n I've successfully written a function that changes the XML data to the new bg/fg color of the xml in-place, and hooked it to doom-load-theme-hook. However, xenops still renders a new preview for the exact same text.\n For example, say i have a xenops LaTeX snippet \n \\(S^1\\) \n generated for the theme doom-zenburn.\n I can change the theme, and the XML file for the associated to the above snippet has its colors updated. In fact, if the preview is visible inline, and I change the theme, the preview changes its colors. This is expected behavior.\n However, when I enter the LaTeX snippet and exit it again, xenops regenerates the snippet for the new theme. Is there a way to prevent this? I don't want to generate new snippets per theme as this would take up unnecessary disk space and compute resources.\n My gut tells me it's not possible.

Then it goes on to say that the XDG-compatible location is in ~/.config/emacs. This is all well and good, and I want to use the XDG-compatible model, but I still have ~/.emacs.d which appears to contain my elpa, melpa, and org libraries that I've installed. I'm just getting going with this config, so I haven't installed much yet.\n Is there a way to make the packages install somewhere else? I'd rather have them in $XDG_DATA_HOME, which for me is in ~/.local/share.

One of the warnings was not to use docker-tramp anymore due to the built in tramp-container.el\n At a quick glance of the .el and errors it produces, I'm getting the feeling that was designed around local containers (Docker running locally with the Emacs), but not for a remote container\n For example, I use Tramp via multi-hop, so that I can ssh to a server where the containers are running, and run the docker ps and open a shell within the images _over there_\n So a bookmark would look something like:\n /ssh:[foo@someserver.com](mailto:foo@someserver.com)|docker:bar@container:/path/within/docker\n tramp-container.el looks like the same syntax (/docker) as docker-tramp, but I wonder if it only works locally?\n I'll have to try docker-tramp again and see if remote still works there, or am I out of luck on this astoundingly handy behaviour. (or perhaps a local docker daemon can reach out to remote docker daemons, or I can run some ssh tunnels to pretend local is remote, or something..)\n edit: Looks like I had a defcustom override for the docker tramp so it was using 'sudo docker' on the target very old system; so I added a override tramp-docker-program for the new module, but still no dice.

          "description": "A literate org mode document that tangles, using noweb an org file into a theme file is a nice way of organizing themes by the files and sections they customize instead of by the sections needed by the file. See: https://gitlab.com/stefan.koch.micro/dotfiles/-/blob/master/emacs/stefan-theme-tangle.org\n Details:\n I spent the weekend setting up my own color theme. What I did not like about how this is done is that the color theme file is broken into sections by the need of the functions to define it. What I wanted to do was to setup the theme organized by the mode or functionality. Since others sharing has helped me in the past, I thought I would share this with the community. (See: The Proximity Principle at https://kula.blog/posts/proximity_principle/)\n I had been using the following techniques anyway, so I was most of the way there:\n  \nUsed GNU Stow to manage my dotfiles (Brandon Invergo' Using GNU Stow to manage your dotfiles: https://brandon.invergo.net/news/2012-05-26-using-gnu-stow-to-manage-your-dotfiles.html\n Used literate config file using org-babel. This lets you write an org file with emacs lisp source code blocks that are saved to an .el file when it is tangled.) See Literate Programming here: https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/intro.html#literate-programming\n  \nBut, this still made me sequence the code in the sections that the theme file required. I did not want that. So noweb came to the rescue. Using noweb, you can have a source block that will include references to source blocks defined in other areas of the org file. This allowed me to organize the file the way I wanted to. The top of the file is the skeleton for the theme file with the sections defined, and the sections below each add to the theme section as they need.\n In case you missed it above, see https://gitlab.com/stefan.koch.micro/dotfiles/-/blob/master/emacs/stefan-theme-tangle.org for the full details.\n    submitted by    /u/StefanKochMicro  \n [link]   [comments]",

[Academics don't want you to know this secret trick: this free software setup is workable for writers of all kinds.] Professor Chappell's guide walks you through the software installation, which includes git for version control, Pandoc for document processing, and the VSCode editor with plugins for Pandoc citations and document export. After the one-time software installation, the writer begins each document with a Markdown template. The Markdown template includes some LaTeX macros for page formatting--Prof Chappell recommends installing the MikTeX LaTeX distribution. Modifying the Pandoc LaTeX template is unnecessary (though I have done this to avoid repetition): add LaTeX packages and macros to the Markdown document template as needed.\nThe setup is interesting and will get you part of the way to a Zettelkasten with VSCode. The installed software and workflow are compatible with Zettlr and Obsidian, though this requires additional configuration.",

This contains each of the individual pieces of the system (atomic ideas).  But then my enthusiasm dies down as I realize this image is essentially MULTIPLE ideas in one graphic, triggering analysis paralysis as I consider how to capture this within my Obsidian-based Zettelkasten.\nMY QUESTION FOR YOU\nBefore you read on, pretend you ran into this information.  Your goal is to use your Zettelkasten to help you write strategy documents for your company AND to write articles for product managers in startups to help them launch better products.\nHow would YOU capture the gold within this infographic within your Zettelkasten?\nOPTIONS I'M CONSIDERING\nNow that you've considered your own solutions, here's a few I thought of.\nCreate one Obsidian Canvas, capturing the entire infographic (a Card for each part of the flowchart and each checklist).  Then begin creating Zettels or linking existing Zettels for each individual component, replacing each Card with a Note instead as I go.\n\n\nTechnically, this option violates the \"Atomic Notes\" rule since my first Zettel would be this full infographic - I'd be essentially capturing a contextualized idea, then breaking it down, which may not yield surprise insights as going bottom-up should.\n\nCreate an Overview Zettel (simple text file) with each item written out, then use this Overview Zettel to create individual Zettels from there.\n\n\nSame concept as #1, but in a text file rather than a Canvas.\n\nKeep this infographic in my Lit Note (aka Reference) and create individual zettels as I go.\nDoes one of these align with what you would do?  If so, which one and why?  If not, how would your approach differ from any of mine?\nThanks in advance!",

Tell us about the state of your zettelkasting journey.\nI'll start.\nI finally released my project that extends The Archive, showing an \"Idea Explorer\" on demand for every note. This can be thought of as a way to look at \"note sequences.\" Sequences that develop an idea. I'm looking for collaborators to develop this idea further. Idea Explorer - an extension exclusively for The Archive.\nThis past week I've had the opportunity to practice and work on my technique for onboarding videos into my ZK. Speed and timing are critical—speed in taking notes and timing in reviewing the event. I feel I've gained a little success making a rough, rough draft during the presentation, then immediately after, as part of the process of watching a video, I expand my notes as I would if they were highlights from an article. Having a few minutes of uninterrupted time immediately after the video presentation to fill in my thoughts on my note is critical.\nI'm looking to do more of this. I get excited when I onboard live streams or Zoom events more than videos where I can start, stop, and replay the action. They feel more dynamic, and they spark my juices.\nMaybe I should try sketch-noting. It just feels like my skills at sketching are so poor that I'd miss stuff with the fast pace of a live presentation. Maybe this would be best reserved for youtube videos.\n\nMy ten day zettel production",

For zettelkasten fans, you'll note that it has some familiar references and suggested readings including by our friends Markus Krajewski, Ann Blair, Iaian McGilchrist, Alex Wright, Anthony Grafton, Dennis Duncan, and Mortimer J. Adler to name but a few.\nMany are certain to know his award winning 1998 book The Professor and the Madman which was also transformed into the eponymous 2019 film starring Sean Penn. Though he didn't use the German word zettelkasten in the book, he tells the story of philologist James Murray's late 1800s collaborative 6 million+ slip box collection of words and sentences which when edited into a text is better known today as the Oxford English Dictionary.\nIf you need some additional motivation to check out his book, I'll use the fact that Winchester, as a writer, is one of the most talented non-linear storytellers I've ever come across, something which many who focus on zettelkasten output may have a keen interest in studying.",
