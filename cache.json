Most of my colleagues rely on Nextflow and Snakemake, so I should consider these, but before I start to learn an entirely new language I wanted to explore the Haskell ecosystem for possible solutions. Strong typing should in theory be a perfect match for a pipeline manager. And having this in Haskell would simplify replacing some of my R code with Haskell eventually.\n So far I saw three tools:\n  \nFunflow: https://github.com/tweag/funflow\n Porcupine: https://github.com/tweag/porcupine\n Bioshake: https://github.com/PapenfussLab/bioshake\n  \nIs here anybody who uses any of these in production and could share their experiences?

My confusion is how State implements =>.\n The state type is defined as:\n newtype State s a = State { runState :: s -> (a, s) } \n And its monad instance is defined as:\n instance Monad (State s) where return x = State $ \\s -> (x, s) (State h) >>= f = State $ \\s -> let (a, newState) = h s (State g) = f a in g newState \n I understand what the first let statement does\n let (a, newState) = h s \n We are unwrapping the function h from the State and applying that function to the input state s.\n What I do not understand is the next two lines\n  (State g) = f a in g newState \n It appears we are not unwrapping a function from the state f, but simply applying f to the value returned by State h? How does this work?\n I understand what is supposed to be happening, I just don't understand how it works. I think what we are trying to do is take the stateful computation from the left side of >>= then create a new function which applies function h to an input state, then applies the function in f to the new state to create a new function g.\n If someone could explain this better, I would greatly appreciate it. I am teaching myself and I don't know where else to go to get my questions about this answered.

I wonder if we could model these type rules explicitly, like in the following pseudocode:\n type TypeSystem = [TypeRule] data TypeRule = TypeRule { premises :: [TypingRelation] , conclusion :: TypingRelation } data TypingRelation = ... \n This would allow us to generalize our typeCheck function:\n typeCheck :: TypeSystem -> Expr -> Either TypeError Type typeCheck rules expr = ... \n We could then declare a type system explicitly instead of implementing its rules implicitly, or create a type system more dynamically by providing a dedicated language for type rules:\n hindleyMilner :: TypeSystem hindleyMilner = ... parseRules :: FilePath -> Maybe TypeSystem parseRules path = ... \n This would allow us to play around with different type systems in a more declarative way, i.e. we could observe the impact of different rule sets on the result of the type checking phase without modifying the type checking process itself.\n I am not saying that this additional degree of flexibility outweighs the costs in general, since modeling and processing the type rules in a generic manner introduces a significant amount of complexity (as far as I have thought it through). But I think such a system could provide some benefits for educational purposes (e.g., an interactive playground for declaring and executing type rules).\n One could transfer this idea to evaluation rules, too.\n I am motivated to implement such a system, are there any obvious roadblocks (other than the inherent complexity)? Are type rules suitable to be modeled explicitly?\n    submitted by    /u/typedbyte  \n [link]   [comments]",

Please take this as a genuine question and try to answer if possible -- I really want to know. Please educate me if my question is ill posed)\n Haskell programmers do not appreciate runtime errors and bugs of any kind. That is why they spend a lot of time encoding invariants in Haskell's capable type system.\n Yet what Haskell gives, it takes away too! While the program is now super reliable from the perspective of types that give you strong compile time guarantees, the runtime could potentially space leak at anytime. Maybe it wont leak when you test it but it could space leak over a rarely exposed code path in production.\n My question is: How can a community that is so obsessed with compile time guarantees accept the totally unpredictability of when a space leak might happen? It seems that space leaks are a total anti-thesis of compile time guarantees!\n I love the elegance and clean nature of Haskell code. But I haven't ever been able to wrap my head around this dichotomy of going crazy on types (I've read and loved many blog posts about Haskell's type system) but then totally throwing all that reliability out the window because the program could potentially leak during a run.\n Haskell community please tell me how you deal with this issue?

          "description": "I'm currently working on a project that relies JSON comparison for tests instead of standard equality (yeah, I know). For particular reasons, we ignore part of the JSON when comparing between the expected and the actual value. Currently, the code is something like this: \n ```haskell import qualified Data.HashMap.Strict as H\n deleteValues (Object o) = Object $ H.delete \"values\" -- Currently removed \"values\" key. deleteValues _ = Object H.empty ```\n We had to change our JSON and we added a new key, which we don't want to consider when testing. This key can appear on several positions, not only at the top level like values.\n For example, we have something like this:\n json { \"values\": [], \"info\": \"ok\", \"key_to_remove\": 0, \"details\": null } \n Here the key_to_remove is only at the top level. But we could have something like:\n  { \"values\": [], \"info\": \"ok\", \"key_to_remove\": 1, \"details\": { \"info\": \"ok\", \"key_to_remove\": 2 } } \n The nesting can keep going on, and I really would like to avoid manually traversing the object looking and deleting the key.\n The idea is to remove all key_to_remove from the JSON object, independent of the position or value that it holds.\n  \nEdit: solution:\n haskell deleteKey :: Text -> Value -> Value deleteKey k (Object o) = Object $ H.delete k (deleteKey k <$> o) deleteKey k (Array arr) = Array (deleteKey k <$> arr) deleteKey _ v = v \n    submitted by    /u/valcron1000  \n [link]   [comments]",

This is very different than in other languages where a numeric literal like 2.718 is hard coded in the compiler to be a specific type ( double or something ) and you cast the value at runtime to be something smaller or larger as needed.\n 42 :: Num a => a fromInteger (42 :: Integer) 2.71 :: Fractional a => a fromRational (2.71 :: Rational) \n    submitted by    /u/teilchen010  \n [link]   [comments]",

I had all this code like:\n g x y = Ploop <$> f x y <*> h x y <*> k x y \n and I figured I could write a little Applicative wrapper that would manage all of that repetitive application of x and y for me. The interface is something like:\n data User = User { pubKey :: PublicKey , names :: Set Text , emails :: Set Text , legalName :: Maybe Text } mergeUsers :: Merge [Text] User User mergeUsers = User <$> required pubKey .?

In other words, I cannot have the following type family:\n ```haskell\n -- For \"Els 0\", I am naively copying the relevant part of the type signature from \"getFirst\" above. type family Els idx where Els 0 = (e : es) Els n = e : Els (n - 1) ```\n Is my conclusion that it is impossible to write a getIdx function such that it an be called like getIdx @1 myHList correct?

          "description": "I know that ZIO test has its own mocking setup, but I am not sure how well it works to mock dependencies that aren't ZIO services, such as a 3rd party SDK. He is my situation:\n I have a service that depends on the Firebase Admin SDK, specifically the auth module. So the live layer looks like a ZLayer[Has[FirebaseAuth], Throwable, Has[UserService]]. I'd like to mock the Firebase Auth SDK for testing, but I don't want to use the annoying emulator thing they have, it's too heavyweight and I don't want to deal with running another Docker container.\n UserService wraps around the auth SDK but has some custom logic. For example, UserService.getUserByEmail(email: String): Task[Option[UserId]] returns an effect that returns Some(UserId) (UserId being an internal domain object) if a user with this email exists, None if no user with the email exists, and fails if it was unable to complete either of these. In contrast, FirebaseAuth.getUserByEmailAsync(email: String): ApiFuture[String] returns a Java Future which fails with a specific error if a user with the email doesn't exist.\n For example, for mocking FirebaseAuth's getUserByEmail, I'd like to do something like (pseudo-code):\n  when (auth.getUserByEmailAsync(email1)) return Future.succeed(\"userid\") when (auth.getUserByEmailAsync(email2)) return Future.fail(NoSuchUserException) when (auth.getUserByEmailAsync(email3)) return Future.fail(BadEmailException) \n and use this somehow in my ZIO-test of my UserService.\n I can't find any examples of using Mockito in ZIO test. Does anyone have a code snippet they can share, or if this is better done through ZIO-test's own mocking system (I only saw mocking of ZIO services there so I am not sure if it can do more than that), can you explain how to do it?\n    submitted by    /u/crpleasethanks  \n [link]   [comments]",

Debug.Trace comes from package debug and Halogen.HTML.CSS comes from package halogen, both of which I have there.\n What do I need to do please?\n Is there any tool that can take a look at the import statements used in a project and solve the dependencies based on that?\n    submitted by    /u/puzzle-game  \n [link]   [comments]",

So for example I'd like to do forward search (whilst in org file find corresponding place in pdf), and reverse search (whilst in pdf find corresponding place in org file). The closest I can currently get is to add #+LaTeX_HEADER: \\synctex=1 to the org file which gets me reverse search in the pdf and be directed not to the org file, but to the intermediate tex file that org creates when compiling org to pdf. \n I feel like org to pdf bidirectional linking should be possible in 2021.

Is there a way to do this with the existing options, or do I need some sort of a function?\n ​\n What I have now (with nil):\n *** This is some sub-header Text goes here, a bunch of lines(footer pointer here) (footer pointer here)this is where the footer ends when i use C-x f **** This is the sub-header of the above header <nothing here, have to move footnote manually> \n Here's what I want:\n *** This is some sub-header Text goes here, a bunch of lines(footer pointer here) **** This is the sub-header of the above header (footer pointer here)this is where I want the marker to be when I hit C-x f \n Any suggestions?

The idea would be to read ONE document really long in 4 or 5 different columns. I noticed that if I open an emacs instance I do not need too much width, so I can exploit the height of my laptop enlarging vertically the file, but the height is limited to around 25 cms in a laptop. Because org does not wrap the content on default, I can open an instance vertically in 1/5 of the screen width, so 4/5 of the screen are not used at all! There is an option to open a subsection on the right of the first instance, but why not opening different columns and see all the long document or almost, so that in one single screen we may have an outline on 2-3- 4 or even 5 columns on almost all the document. So that we may scroll one column for instance the second and so the all the columns also scroll accordingly, so that we can see for instance almost all the chapters of a huge book , then could open some paragraphs title of chapter 33 and 56, and compare them together, move content in seconds etc. The simple idea is that people say mindmaps give more an helicopter vision of all the document(and in fact mind maps take all the screen), everyone in the org community debates if files should have links or stay in a single file.Why not giving to the users the possibility to open multiple columns with scrolling integration, so that the user can see huge documents with a glance, be more creative, modify things, search occurrences, it would be genial imo, because org supports different colors per level on default, and would be really easy to spot the structure and be more efficient, combine new ideas creatively, never miss the big picture, etc\n    submitted by    /u/ndrokky  \n [link]   [comments]",

After sudo pacman -S emacs, cloning my config repository (which is just my init.el), and launching Emacs for the first time, examination of the load-history variable shows that the Org files being loaded are the built-in versions.\n I believe this is the root cause of two bugs I've been experiencing. \n First, the first time an Emacs session is launched, calling save-buffers-kill-emacs fails - which, in my workflow means the mos…",

I think this might be related to https://github.com/akermu/emacs-libvterm/issues/229, however, I'm not sure as the workarounds of setting line-spacing to nil did not seem to work for me.\n Another issue I have that might be related is that emacs will not take up the full height of my screen in windowed mode when the menu bar is hidden. It seems like it is incorrectly setting a maximum size that accounts from the height of the menu bar, as the issue does not appear when the menu bar is set to always be visible.\n To add to this, when in vterm, once I get to the bottom there is a space that slowly shrinks with each line return and then comes back.\n It just seems like emacs is having issues figuring out the correct number of lines my display supports, and vterm is incorrectly getting the height and width of the window.\n    submitted by    /u/just_insane  \n [link]   [comments]",

Not that I don't do it myself - but I'm trying slowly to get myself away from naively sharing my info (especially sensitive) with 3-rd parties... The clouds like AWS I guess could be alright but with adding of some strong encryption.\n And this is how the next question comes up:\n 3) How do you encrypt your data if using 3-rd party cloud/medium for synchronization/backup, if you do use them?\n And overall:\n 4) What's your workflow here in general?

Her mother, Laura Hardyman, wanted to give her a middle name of Violet, after one of the child's grandmothers. I told that, while I appreciated the sentiment, I simply couldn't bring myself to agree to giving her a middle name of Vi! Not, that is, unless she was given a second middle name of Emacs for balance. To my astonishment, Laura agreed to the compromise, with the proviso that my last name was added as a third middle name. Thus the child's legal name is Alice Violet Emacs Raiter Hardyman. (This compromise was reached almost literally as we were filling out the birth certificates. If I had had time to reflect on the matter, I would have tried to get the name Edwynna thrown in there as well. Oh well; Laura probably wouldn't have agreed to it anyway.) Anyway, recently a friend suggested to me that I should ask you to be the child's virtual godfather. Since none of us are religious, I'm not sure what being a virtual godfather would mean. But in any case, I figured you might enjoy hearing about it. b \n From: Richard Stallman To: Brian Raiter Subject: Re: Virtual Godfather Reply-to: rms@gnu.org The Church of Emacs does not have gods, so it would not make sense to have godfathers. But I could be her editorfather . I guess it would be good for me to meet her sometime.

This means that if the meeting occurred yesterday, and today is a new month, I can't easily change the month quickly.\n Would it be possible to create a similar command, in which I can easily change the date up and down by scrolling?\n I need help with this as I'm trying to use Yasnippet to keep track of work meetings.\n Thanks in advance.\n ​\n FOLLOWUP question: Would it be possible to insert the date/time stamp (the same one that uses the ( c-. ) keybinding) inside a snippet?\n    submitted by    /u/manylights  \n [link]   [comments]",

But in reality the urgency is like \"eh\", and despite being brought up bimonthly on emacs-devel, no one yearns for it enough to do it. Anyway, I decided to take it up. With the generous help from guys on emacs-devel, the bulk of the work is now completed.\n Seeing that native-comp had benefited from publishing the code for people to test out and report problems before the work finalizes, I want to follow Andrea's example and publish the code for the tree-sitter integration. Please try out the code, and tell me if there is anything not working as expected or can be improved, especially on the font-lock and indent interface. Thanks.\n https://archive.casouri.cat/note/2021/emacs-tree-sitter/index.html\n And yes, I'm aware of other efforts to provide tree-sitter features to Emacs (and authors of them offered me great help), but they are different. My only comment for \"why didn't you...\" is that I'm an evil bastard desperate for attention, and I have the code.\n EDIT: “offered me great help” kind of came out wrong, I meant “provided me great help”.

Some details:\n  \nI'm mostly interested in writing code + version control, taking notes (I prefer a zettelkasten-like approach, so back-links are a key feature), and academic writing (usually in markdown or latex).\n I don't care about calendar or email unless it's very easy to integrate with gsuite / outlook (too hard to collaborate in my work environment without using those).\n I want something lightweight and fast (at least compared to a \"modern\" IDE like JetBrains or VSCode).\n I'm fairly set on using vim keybindings, so if I went with emacs I'd be using evil.\n I'm not familiar with lisps at all (but definitely willing to acquire that skill if emacs can offer me a better long-term solution).\n  \nGiven the requirements above org-mode + org-roam seem like the biggest draws for me, but these are my (maybe unfounded?) concerns:\n  \nI get anxious about format lock-in for my notes. I know the `.org` syntax is widely supported, but it seems (from my reading at least) like emacs is the only place it gets the \"first class\" treatment.\n Performance. I've heard emacs can be slow, is this something that's generally expected/accepted? Are there things I can do to make it faster without sacrificing productivity for the activities described above?\n I have heard some people say that evil doesn't always work nicely with plugins they want to use. If my main use-cases are the ones listed above, can I expect evil to (generally) work well?\n  \nEmacs looks really appealing, but those concerns are holding me back... Given all that, do you think emacs is a good fit for me?\n Do any of you have a similar set of use-cases for your emacs use? If so, how satisfied are you with your setups?\n ​\n Thanks in advance for your advice!\n    submitted by    /u/BlithePanda  \n [link]   [comments]",

We're talking one file for each week, going back 2 years at a time.. it adds up. lots and lots. Loading org-agenda with all my files takes about a minute as I see tramp reads every org file, authenticates, and moves on to the next one... \n Obvious problem #2: \n TRAMP was not designed (I don't think so anyway) to handle org-agenda searches with IVY, going through every single file and looking for the characters through ssh... This is painfully slow. We're talking 15 minutes or more before I see a reaction. \n ​\n So ok. I get the idea that the way to run Emacs this way, with files connected via SSH, is probably via Emacs on terminal. Or, I could probably just have X11 or something else to remote in remotely. \n I also tried sshfs, which works on the Mac fine, but it doesn't do a thing for Emacs and searching through the files. Same speed. Because well, it's still ssh and it's still doing the same thing. \n ​\n So my question is... What do you folks do? Anyone uses org-mode agenda through TRAMP? I know this is half an org-mode question, but I'm looking for an advice for TRAMP, or maybe something else that works for you.\n    submitted by    /u/jtr3322  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I want to create a filter group for ibuffer that collects the many buffers gdb makes (mostly to organize them, but also to make killing them once I'm done debugging easier).\n However, they don't seem to have a common major mode... gdb-frames-mode, gdb-locals-mode, inferior i/o, etc all appear when I use gdb-many-windows (which I use because it's great).\n Is there some way to sort all of these into their own category in ibuffer? Or perhaps a way to directly do what I want, quickly clear out all GDB related buffers? Or, even smarter - make GDB clean itself up once the debugging session ends?\n This is how it looks now.\n EDIT:\n I'm (partially) dumb - it cleans up all of these buffers if you do\n (gdb) quit\n at the prompt - leaving just 1 buffer around (the gdb console itself).

          "description": "I've created the mu4e thread folding package (https://github.com/rougier/mu4e-thread-folding) which works nicely but is a bit slow because there are a lot of information that needs to be stored in several overlays and the code has become a bit complex.\n I've tried an alternative method which is much faster and easier to maintain (I think). The code is available here: https://gist.github.com/rougier/98e83fb50e19fb73fe34a7ecc5fc1ccc\n The idea is to add a specific character to thread children (non-breaking space in my case but any other specific character would work I think). Then it's really easy to parse the buffer to detect children. Threads are folded by displaying a summary (such as \"--- 5 hidden messages (2 unread) ---\") using an overlay. To unfold the thread, I simply search for this specific overlay and delete it.

The issue is, evil-collection will bind e.g. M-<return> to outline-insert-heading in outline-mode, but then org-keys.el remaps outline-insert-heading to org-ctrl-c-ret in org-mode - with the end result being that M-<return> is bound to org-ctrl-c-ret in org-mode instead of org-meta-return!\n There are a couple instances of this issue, and evil-org-mode doesn't fix most of them. Mostly, what I want to know is if there's a canonical way to keep the evil-collection bindings for outline-mode (which I use to edit a specific document format for my job), while at the same time preventing org-keys.el from remapping those evil-bound versions.\n I thought loading org first might prevent this issue, but that doesn't seem to be the case; here's a init.el to reproduce it. Just open an org mode buffer and do C-h k M-<return> to see that org-meta-return isn't being bound correctly.

So I guess side question - tips for getting started with basic org mode?\n However that aside, main question is: is there a way to represent math quickly in a text format and have it display like it would if written manually on paper? I know emacs can display images in buffers almost like Microsoft Word can... Some kind of \"render this math as an image of how it should look on paper\"?\n I assume the profs use some sort of tool to generate pretty formatted math for stuff like HW and exams, but I have no idea what they use. It almost looks like the kind of output you get from typing \"one line\" math into Wolfram alpha.\n A big important thing though is speed - if it's some kind of super complex markup lang that'll take me forever to write, no good. I gotta be able to generate this about as fast as I could write it on paper, or at least a basic thing I could go back and pretty up after class.\n Does something like that exist?\n    submitted by    /u/Gangsir  \n [link]   [comments]",

However, after spending some time in the evil codebase, I'm wondering if it's necessary at all.\n The only immediate use I can see for this is to handle how \"0\" works, which is the only place this function is actually used in the evil codebase. That is, if a count argument has been started, you want 0 to be interpreted as being a part of the count argument (e.g. d 10 j) while if a count argument hasn't been started, you want 0 to be interpreted as evil-beginning-of-line (e.g. d0).\n Since evil-beginning-of-line is a motion, I'm pretty sure any use of it will pass through evil-read-motion, which uses evil-keypress-parser - which contains logic that makes me think evil-redirect-digit-argument might not be necessary.\n evil-keypress-parser has a specific hardcoded check for evil-beginning-of-line's wrapper function. This hardcoded check seems to do the exact same thing evil-redirect-digit-argument already does - i.e. if you hit a 0 and it's not the first number in the sequence, just add it to the count argument, and if you hit a 0 and it is the first number in a sequence, interpret it as evil-beginning-of-line and complete the key sequence.\n I tried removing the use of evil-redirect-digit-argument and changing the hard-coded check (a two line change) and everything seemed to still be working: d0, d10j d203k, etc.\n Is there a reason for evil-redirect-digit-argument to exist that I'm missing?\n    submitted by    /u/summetria  \n [link]   [comments]",

I know I can export the graphic in the inline wolfram language interpreter and then load the image into an inline python block, but it's a very ugly and tedious hack.\n    submitted by    /u/HawkinsT  \n [link]   [comments]",

I would much rather wanderlust fetch them from my keyring via secret-tool.\n This works fine for sending email. Wanderlust hands the file to msmtp, which has secret-tool integration.\n But how do I best go about fetching email? I need IMAP exclusively, and not just for fetching email, but also for managing folders on the server.

For files I use ranger, ueberzug and sxiv for images, neomutt for emails, tmux for tabs and sessions, and there's so many other terminal applications that do the job that is never supposed to be done by vim. Vim is just a great text editor. How can it be said that vim can't view images or browse github or reply to emails but emacs can... I mean there's a tonne of terminal applications that do those jobs.\n I have no grudge against emacs but I'm a terminal user, I use dwm to manage windows, most of the fancy terminal applications that do emails and stuff.... So to move forward with emacs, I wish to know the benefits I'd have. To make it more simple I'll break it down into two parts :\n  \nemacs as editor or vim\n emacs as not an editor or the terminal\n  \nFor the first part IG everyone would agree upon vim. Isn't that the reason why we have evil mode? and IDK the answer to the second part and I can't even say because I've used terminal applications but haven't explored the 'other than text editor' capabilities of emacs. So I want y'all to point out where the simplest tool(the terminal) fails to do the job that emacs can.\n    submitted by    /u/zim0369  \n [link]   [comments]",

I also provides the content of the hunks, but obviously without properties (this makes sense -- git doesn't deal in propertised text). I thought it would be cool to have a swiper-like interface where the hunk text I see in my ivy listing does have the properties it has in the buffer -- it would make it easier to spot what's what. \n Simple then, for each hunk, I'll just lift the text, with properties, between the start and end line. I thought there would be a function for this, but I can't find one. I know a few ways I could do it (e.g. go to the beginning of the start line, get the char number, goto end of end line, get the char number and use buffer-substring), but it seems like such a basic thing I'm sure there must be a good, canonical way.\n Is there?\n    submitted by    /u/Jack-o-tall-tales  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello fellow Zettelkasteners. I have heard that zettel notes should be written in one's own words. But I have never understood what it means to write notes in your own words. Most of the time I just copy a passage with minor changes or I translate an English passage as if I copied it.\nI thought about different strategies. I could first read a paragraph, then close the book, then rewrite some ideas from memory without looking at the text. Or I could simply read the text and not bother with the information within and just write my thoughts that could come into my mind. Or I could write the note as if I explained it to my mom.\nNote that I write my zettel notes in Romanian so when I read a text in English I translate it in Romanian. Not that it helps.\nAm I missing something? Can you tell me how can I write a zettel note without copying from the text or write it in my own words?",

Also, I write in a notebook first, then transcribe the writing into my computer to avoid editing while writing.\nHowever, when there are gaps, I'm not too keen on the idea of referring to resources until I can fill in the gaps. It means that I have to switch from writing to reading. Reading is low effort to me while writing is demanding. I'm most energetic in the morning. Thus, I'd rather use my mornings to write than to read if I have anything to write about.\nBut, if I split the tasks, I need to do something about what I've written so I can address the gaps and re-use the text. I've tried multiple approaches to deal with this to no avail.\nSo I ask: What is your approach to handle gaps in your understanding when processing reading notes?",

I feel like I'll learn the principles better if I can immediately start implementing the practices, and that means I need to choose what software I'm going to use (definitely not a card-and-box system - my handwriting isn't up to the task).\nMy existing workflow involves 1) highlighting and commenting on scholarly papers and ebooks in Mendeley; 2) highlighting and scribbling in the margin of hard copy books; 3) saving popular press articles to Evernote from Chrome. Then I write in Word. As you can see, something to process and organize notes and move them smoothly to the writing process is greatly needed.\nSince I already have several programs in this process, my top consideration for Zettelkasten software is that it be intuitive and work out-of-the-box without me having to hack any fixes.\nI have seen that some people use Evernote for Zettelkasten and I wonder if that's the way to go, to avoid proliferating software. It would be nice if I could click from my note on an article to easily see the article itself. However, looking at the earlier thread on Evernote, it seemed to get a bit technical with people figuring out plug-ins and fixes - I wonder if there's software I will find more simple and intuitive for Zettlekasten.\nThanks very much in advance for your help!",

In it he was making some bold proclamations, so I thought I'd ask what this community thought?\nThe core argument seems to be\n\n  \nToday, however, I shall provide one fundamental component of Luhmann's system. This fundamental component is missing from an estimated 96% of digital zettelkastens.\nLuhmann outlines this fundamental component in the very beginning of his paper on how his zettelkasten works.\n\n    \nInformation is an intra-systematic event. It results when one compares one message or entry with regard to other possibilities. Information, accordingly, originates only in systems which possess a comparative schema—even if this amounts only to: \"this or something else.\"\n\n  \n  \nYou see, built into every single note in Luhmann's system is one requirement: he must decide where the note belongs. It forces associations, and associations stand as the fundamental building block of human memory. One must decide if the note is associated with this or something else. It is a comparative schema built into the very root of Luhmann's antinet zettelkasten, which surfaces the magic of his system.\nUnfortunately, this fundamental component is watered down to near extinction in the world of digital zettelkastens.\n\n\n(Source: https://daily.scottscheper.com/num/243/)\nThe idea of \"must decide where the note belongs\", while true, misses the point of multiple context within the zettelkasten, as Luhmann was trying to come up with an alternative to filing notes using folders. Or is he just rehashing the classic Folgzettel Debate?\nEdited by @ctietze: Added source link for attribution",

          "description": "Hello everyone,\nI usually take a ton of notes from narrative non-fiction books I read: story ideas, research etc... Those should be considered \"literature notes\" in the context of zettelkasten. I find it confusing having these notes in a single file, so I split them by topic or anecdote. But I don't like to have my computer crammed with tons of files. When I read a new book on the same topic, rather than creating new notes and linking them, I tend to group the notes I already have with new notes who adds info to the same topic or details to the same anecdote. Still, I keep a reference to the original source (in the form of citation).\nTo better explain what I do:\nI read a book about a writer and I take a note on an episode of his life (which we'll call NOTE 1).\nAnother episode of his life goes to a different note (NOTE 2) in the same folder.\nI read another book and I find some detail on the same episode as NOTE 1. I don't create a new note but I add it to NOTE 1 and eventually add a citation for the new source.\nI read a book about a chemist and I take a note about one of his discoveries in the specific folder of that book/project. It isn't directly related to the episode of NOTE 1, but I think linking them can bring to a new perspective. I create NOTE 3 and link NOTE 1 and NOTE 3.\nIs that a good practice, or is it better to have a single file for the notes coming from a book, then different super short notes for concepts I want to keep from each book?",

From Wikipedia:\n\n  \nThe multi-armed bandit problem models an agent that simultaneously attempts to acquire new knowledge (called \"exploration\") and optimize their decisions based on existing knowledge (called \"exploitation\"). The agent attempts to balance these competing tasks in order to maximize their total value over the period of time considered.\n\n\nIn the case of the Collector, the \"agent\" explores indefinitely and adds to their collection but postpones making the decision to do something with it. Wikipedia gives a list of practical applications of the multi-armed bandit problem, but I can't resist pointing out that the problem of deciding which professor's class to take is almost never counted among such lists, perhaps because professors compile them. Someone choosing among Zettelkasten implementations without really settling on one is another.\nGiven that the multi-armed bandit problem has a name, has been extensively studied since at least the middle of the twentieth century and has been solved in important cases, one question is whether some of these solutions could guide the Collector toward more productive uses of their time.",
