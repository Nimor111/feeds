Jordan provides abstract and inspectable JSON parsing and serialization, using the Applicative (for parsing) and Divisible (for serializing) typeclasses.\n Jordan has you define ToJSON and FromJSON classes in terms of instructions, such as \"serialize a string\" or \"parse an object with these fields\". These instructions are then evaluated by various interpreters, which actually do the work of parsing or serializing. This has a few benefits:\n  \nIntermediate structures are entirely avoided: there is no Map.Map Text JSONValue anywhere in the library, and JSON fields are directly parsed using permutation parsers. This also means that we can always serialize a JSON directly to a bytestring, avoiding the need for anything like toEncoding from Aeson\n Since JSON interaction is kept abstract, you can generate documentation for parsers and serializers, directly from their definitions. This is provided in jordan-openapi.\n This library provides a fun excuse to use contravariant functors, so you can feel like a super small functional programmer\n  \nThe github page for this project is located here. While I'm not gunning to replace Aeson or anything, I would really appreciate any feedback anybody has to offer!\n    submitted by    /u/THeShinyHObbiest  \n [link]   [comments]",

But having implemented the core transport protocol in dart, I do have some doubts...\n Having come through all the options, I've read that people use Swift across all platforms (iOS/Android/Mac/Windows) for applications logic, as Swift is an LLVM compiler, so it produces very fast binaries that run on Android without JVM.\n So, I am now thinking, wait a second - Haskell GHC is also an LLVM compiler. A short google search shows that people do compile Haskell code to both iOS and Android. And we already have most of the protocol logic implemented in Haskell - people use our SimpleX chat via terminal...\n While this all seems doable, the compiler configuration and low level bindings are a bit over my head - I am an application developer, so lots to learn here. Would anybody here who has the experience with Haskell on iOS / Android be interested to join the project (terms TBD) to at least help us set it all up, if not get involved longer term?\n    submitted by    /u/epoberezkin  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Errata: This is a repost with a different title of a post I just deleted, since the old title \"Is Haskell a better Python?\" created substantial confusion, and Reddit does not allow the changing of post titles. The original post-thread can be found here: https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/qbvfsh/beginning_programmer_here_is_haskell_a_better/\n ​\n I'm just a noob with a copy of \"Haskell From The Very Beginning\", but I'd like to ask:\n ​\n Is Haskell a better Python? As in, Python is a deliberate attempt to make a very accessible programming language, but guess what? The textbook I just bought has 127 functional pages (albeit extremely concise ones).\n ​\n I'm wondering if Haskell might be a better Python for people beginning to code; i.e, people complain about Monads this,\n https://preview.redd.it/kqvdmwedanu71.png?width=892&format=png&auto=webp&s=4165714f28e616ac30685a8095ca34fcb68427c1\n that, but a lot of it comes down to people starting with imperative paradigms.\n ​\n The benefits, likewise, are substantial. Haskell, in comparison in other programming languages, is very hard to make bad code in (because it simply won't compile). For non-programmers coming into programming, Haskell is a way to learn to code but also to produce a relatively high-quality of code, whereas Python etc might be easier to learn, but it's far easier to produce spaghetti code in other languages. Moreover, selling Haskell as \"a better Python\" to non-programmers also helps enlarge the Haskell community, leading to better library, compiler, and other forms of support, while making it so that many future programmers start from a functional paradigm instead of an imperative paradigm.\n ​\n Edit: I did contact Haskell Foundation about this subject, but I'd like to message them permission to post e-mail contents first, and I'd rather finish a few Haskell textbooks beforehand so I don't feel like a poser before I do so.\n    submitted by    /u/Instrume  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I lately grokked that Haskell just reveals the very nature of imperative program, or sequential code, that a thread of execution (by machine, as well as reasoning by human), is essentially single item (thus monadic) data dependencies chained together.\n IO has a phantom (yet magical) RealWorld item in the chain (though only at type level, not present at value level), you can imagine every IO step receives a new version of the RealWorld from the previous step. While ST has an even more general abstraction of it.\n Human brains seem to take single threaded reasoning for granted, so procedural code would appear more \"natural\" to humans. But data dependency is inherently \"multi-threaded\", thus how referential transparency is more \"natural\" to the physical nature.\n We human perceive a single RealWorld despite multiple versions of it along the temporal axis. But thinking the data dependency way, no such single RealWorld actually exists at all, just as in Haskell (at value level).\n Then we have real difficulties in reasoning about effects (mutation done to the \"world\") applied, if not sequentially organized. How \"unnatural\" we human are. Anyhow, imperative programs reflect this bug/feature of our cognitive workings, including monadic Haskell.\n    submitted by    /u/complyue  \n [link]   [comments]",

I am from a group of researchers from Monash University in Australia who are interested in making visual tools to assist in teaching and learning the Haskell language. I created the Chameleon type debugger to help Haskell programmers better understand types and solve type errors. You can check out our talk and our paper at ICFP2021. \n If you know Haskell (whether you are a beginner or a veteran), I want to invite you to participate in my online user study (code challenge). You can check out some features of the Chameleon debugger during the study. The study is anonymous, and it will take you about 10 - 15 minutes to complete. But it will help us immensely. Click this link to proceed https://blend.ercu.be. \n P.S. I know this is a form of self-advertisement after all. And therefore I have checked with the mods beforehand. To my surprise, they quite welcome my post here.\n Thank you,\n Shuai, Interactive Haskell Type Inference Exploration Team\n    submitted by    /u/tonynotworking  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Lists in Haskell are often used as persistent generators rather than data structures. This usually works very well, but can result in massive space leaks. Consider the contrived example below:\n main = print leak list = enumFrom <$> [0..] bigNumber = 10000000 leak = map (\\n -> list !! n !! bigNumber) [1..100] \n I reworked this example to avoid space leaks by defining a Gen typeclass which supports generators of infinite lists:\n {-# LANGUAGE FunctionalDependencies #-} module Main where main = print noleak genlist = EnumFrom <$> [0..] noleak = map(\\n -> gens !! n `idx` bigNumber) [1..100] bigNumber = 10000000 -- For potentially terminating generators, val :: a -> Maybe b and next :: a -> Maybe a class Gen a b | a -> b where val :: a -> b next :: a -> a newtype EnumFrom = EnumFrom {value :: Int} instance Gen EnumFrom Int where val = value next = EnumFrom . (+1) . value idx :: Gen a b => a -> Int -> b idx a n = val $ iterate next a !! n \n Although this approach works, simply being able to use a list would be far more convenient.\n My question: is there a way to make lists not leak space, or is there at least a solid library for non-memoizing iterators and generators?\n Edit: Thank you for the answers given so far!

I had written the entire thing (still rather small here) using the normal string (or [Char]) type. Though after reading up on how I could make a strip function I found out using Text is apparently a lot better overall and already has a strip function built-in (tho no replace from to). So I ported my program to using Text and noticed that some functionality just flies out the window which I did use quite a lot (Pattern matching for example), or is rather cumbersome to use (Concatenation, especially to normal strings; comparing with normal hard coded strings (less so than concat))\n So how should I replace such things when using Text? Constantly writing T. (as the package says one should) isn't really all that nice either, though I mind that less. I'm mostly missing the pattern-matching/recursion stuff and being able to easily compare/concat a Text to a hardcoded string. The constant T.append (T.pack \"my string\") myText just feels really verbose and unwieldly compared to \"my string\" ++ myText... The program does a lot of string (or well... text) manipulation, using pattern matching and concatenation quite a lot\n I'm currently on ghc 9.0.1\n    submitted by    /u/nevatalysa  \n [link]   [comments]",

I noticed in the library documentation that (at least according to package naming scheme), this library also seems to have an encoding of type families in Java. This seems to be backed up by the fact that one of the linked papers in the readme of the project also uses type families. \n This is more surprising to me. I know Java generics are Turing complete, but as far as I know, there are no academic results that would lead me to believe that type families can be emulated in Java (as I remember, the paper essentially uses an encoding of grammars as a kind of fluent interface in the proof of Turing completeness).\n Does anyone know anything about this seeming emulation of type families in Java?

So far I tried to \"dump\" the dependencies used by cabal using cabal freeze, and stack ls dependencies when using stack. An issue that I found is that while cabal uses my system-wide GHC (8.8.4), stack uses the GHC version defined by the resolver (8.6.5). Then, different base versions result in very different dependencies versions.\n Nevertheless, the test suite passes if I build the project using stack test --system-ghc (it uses GHC 8.8.4). I'm not really sure what dependencies are being used in this case (GHC 8.8.4 base or stack resolver base?).

Which means I can't just free everything with free; I have to use the correct c function.\n My plan was to use the ReaderT monad to hold pointers of the allocated objects and create a typeclass for deletion which would trigger when things fall out of scope:\n class Collectable p where collect :: (MonadIO m) => p -> m () newtype CThing = CThing (Ptr ()) instance Collectable CThing where collect (CThing p) = ffi_c_delete_function_for_thing p \n I then created a newtype called 'Bin' for holding these objects:\n newtype Bin = Bin { unBin :: forall p . Collectable p => [p] } \n The reason for this is that it complained about impredicative polymorphism if I didn't create the newtype. It also didn't like:\n newtype Bin = Bin { unBin :: [forall p . Collectable p => p] } \n For the same reason.\n I then tried to call the delete functions on the environment:\n mapM collect $ unBin env \n But GHC complains again:\n Ambiguous type variable ‘a0’ arising from a use of ‘collect’ prevents the constraint ‘(Collectable a0)’ from being solved. \n Why can't it solve the constraint? I have defined a bin to contain only collectable objects!?\n As you have probably worked out by now, I have very little idea what I'm doing when it comes to higher rank polymorphism! send help!\n I have a backup plan (creating a type level list for the environment and using type families to construct the Collectable class), but it seems excessive\n    submitted by    /u/jamhob  \n [link]   [comments]",

I learned following the Coursera course from the wonderful Martin Odersky, but I quickly realised that my company was still in the middle of its transition from Java to Scala, with most of our code base looking more like scalaified Java than pure FP Scala like I learned at the beginning.\n I like functional programming, I've liked it from the first moment I learned common Lisp even thou the language felt antiquated, and, well, I wouldn't say I cried, but I was somewhat moved by the....purety ? Mathematicality ? of scala ( don't judge, IK my sense of esthetic is somewhat weird ). \n Things seem to be somewhat moving in this direction at work, and I wanted to accompany this, and satisfy my own curiosity, by learning the move fp-extremist stuff I could find in Scala. \n I could easily find resources on cats and the rest of the typelevel ecosystem, but then I discovered ZIO and that became my latest obsession. I like the project, I like how ZIO code looks and what the whole obsessive typing of everything thingy brings to me as a Dev.\n And then I tried to learn Zio 2.0 ( because why start with the old one when the next one is almost there ? ) but I have a hard time finding learning resources.\n Which bring me to my question ( thanks for reading my life story if you did ) : is the Zionomicon, and Zio in general, worth the time and money I would invest ?\n \n TLDR : weirdo ranting on his new fp zealotry wants to know if paying 50+ bucks for the Zionomicon is worth it\n    submitted by    /u/WiIzaaa  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have good scripting knowledge in a few high-level languages (PowerShell mainly, plus Python and general Bash/awk scripting), and I'd like to break into a more rigorous programming paradigm. Another potential plus is that my company product is written in Java. I don't implement any code, but I do handle its technical implementation and design augmentations for customers. I may find an opportunity to leverage Scala in the JVM for some side projects to help me practice. \n At any rate, my motivation for learning Scala is that it seems well-aligned with my goals and circumstances for entering a more programmatic world.\n  \nBooks\n After looking around, I've picked out 3 books:\n  \nProgramming in Scala Fifth Edition\n \nHands-on Scala Programming: Learn Scala in a Practical, Project-Based Way \n \nProgramming Scala: Scalability = Functional Programming + Objects\n \n I saw a lot of good things about Programming in Scala Fourth Edition, and being that it's written by Martin Odersky, it seems like a solid choice. However, the Fifth Edition claims to have been overhauled for Scala 3, and it's too new for me to find any reviews on how this overhauled edition has turned out.\n Hands-on Scala Programming has good reviews and seems like it might be oriented toward a beginner specifically with its \"project-based\" approach. However being published in 2020, I'd expect it to have been written for Scala 2. I figured if I am jumping into Scala, I should go for a Scala 3 book.\n The book by Dean Wampler seems like a solid book, but I can't find much info on it in terms of reviews.\n Does anyone have experience with any of these books and could provide their 2 cents on it?\n Thank you!\n    submitted by    /u/OPconfused  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "This is a post introducing the new changes of Iron v1.1.2.\n What is Iron ?\n Iron is a type constraints (or type refinement) library for Scala 3. It uses Dotty's inline and opaque types to evaluate constraints at compile-time.\n Here is a simple example: ```scala def log(x: Double > 0d): Refined[Double] = x.map(Math.log)\n log(-1d) //Compile-time error ```\n New features of 1.1.2\n Mathematics\n This release make Iron closer to mathematics by providing two features: - A new A / B alias which has the same meaning than x € A / B(x) in mathematics. The old A ==> B alias is kept but deprecated for retrocompatibility reasons.\n  \nA new algebraic system allowing the user to write their constraint like a mathematical equation: ```scala\n  \ndef acos(x: Double / (-1d <= ?? <= 1d)): Refined[Double] = x.map(Math.acos) acos(1d) //Right(0) acos(1.5) //Error ```\n Check this page for further information.\n Compile-time evaluation support for composed constraints\n Before 1.1.2, constraints like And, Or, Not etc... Weren't evaluable at compile-time. They were evaluated at runtime only. This update now allows you evaluate complex/composed constraints at compile-time: scala def acos(x: Double / (Greater[-1d] && Less[1d])): Refined[Double] = x.map(Math.acos) acos(1.2) //Compile-time error \n Note: Compile-time evaluation is also supported by the new algebra system.\n Links\n  \nGithub\n Release\n An interactive example on Scastie\n  \nFeel free to ask here if you have a question or a review.\n    submitted by    /u/Il_totore  \n [link]   [comments]",

Basically, I need this test to pass:\n scala val testValue: Seq[Byte] = ??? assert(method(testValue))(approximatelyEquals(Coordinate(azi1, ele1))) //values from spec catalog correlating byte sequences to expected Coordinate values \n The signature of approximatelyEquals is\n scala def approximatelyEquals[A: Numeric](reference: A, tolerance: A): Assertion[A] \n I am unsure of how to make this work with the Coordinate class. I need an instance of Numeric for Coordinate, but it doesn't make much sense, since for example it's not possible to order points on a globe.\n Basically what I need is to make sure that the elevation and azimuth values are close to the azimuth and elevation values that are expected.

There was a new shiny amazing library to explore every month... And now there's just promises in the air and Scala 3 hasn't really taken off, and seems like it just won't.\n There's also the job offers. From what I've seen, only some companies in Europe are hiring (mainly in the Netherlands), and the positions they offer are that of a Senior Scala Engineer with no possibility of growing.\n Also, the speed in which the Scala ecosystem grew in the previous years left every company using Scala, having a mix of styles in their software.

I'm interested in building an Scala 3 extensible app, whose behavior could be extended, customized via plugins. Bonus points if those plugins could be loaded/unloaded on runtime and their clients be notified accordingly.\n Possible solutions I've thinking about so far:\n  \nOverriding DefaultPluginManager from https://pf4j.org/ so the class can be aware of sbt generated classes (may not work with bloop/metals generated random name directories). But have trouble with Akka classloader, so I 'm not sure if it'll ever would work.\n Use https://github.com/moditect/layrry which is based on Java Modules. Not tried yet. Sbt does not recognize module-info.java which is essential for it to work. Possible solution is implement an Sbt Plugin. But, I don't know if at the end this would work in development mode which is important.\n Mess with an OSGI runtime and spend 3 months figuring out how to make it work with Scala ecosystem.\n Implement the application around https://github.com/softwaremill/macwire and hope the wiredInModule feature (which support dynamic loading) would be ported to Scala 3 soon.\n Building a sort of dynamic bundler that compiles the application along with extensions using Scala 3's given/implicits feature. (although technically that would not be a plug-gable architecture)\n distage-extension-plugins looks very promising but it's no ported to Scala 3 yet.\n Using a DI framework like Airframe, but it doesn't support dynamic loading.\n Using Guice? :-(\n  \nIs there any more Scala principled way of achieving that? or another paradigm that helps building a dynamic app ecosystem through plugins/extensions in Scala? or another long-term software management strategy or architecture that could work?\n PD: The reason I really really need Scala 3 is because I want to make it around new ADT implementation and use type-class derivation from them.\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/josemanuelp2  \n [link]   [comments]",

My previous work has been in Haskell, which I liked. I guess my question is: Is Scala worth it now? I have a larger Java codebase I'll be integrating with, and I get to choose what JVM technologies to use, and other folks have expressed interest in Scala as well. I'd feel guilty for pushing Clojure on them, just because I know it, but I've also been there and done that, and I like types now.\n Coming from Haskell, are there functional libraries I should build upon but allow for escape hatch style mutability for some of my not so functional teammates? We're a small team, and pedagogy will be a part of the gig. \n I'm looking for honest opinions of the language and what essential reading material/libraries would be for someone more comfortable with FP in general.

          "description": "JVM primitive numerical types are limited to Byte, Short, Int, Long, Float and Double. For over two decades everyone was forced to use those primitives, whenever computational performance was important. Luckily, with Scala3 there is a choice.\n Let's define an opaque type Price, which will have all the functionality of a Float, will be as fast as a Float, but will be distinct from a Float. We will need to import Scalqa.\n import scalqa.{*,given} type Price = Price.TYPE.DEF object Price extends Float.Opaque.Data.Numerical[Price](\"Price\"): inline def apply(inline v: Float): Price = v.toOpaque override def value_tag(v:Price) : String = \"$\"+v.toFloat extension(inline x: Price) // Optional custom methods inline def isNotExpensive: Boolean = x < 100 object TYPE: opaque type DEF <: Float.Opaque = Float.Opaque \n By extending Float.Opaque.Data.Numerical Price inherits numerical methods which match those for a Float primitive. Even better, all those methods are inlined, so when used, they will be reduced to primitive calls.\n Consider the following example:\n  var price : Price = Price(9.99f) var primitive: Float = 5.99f price = price * 2 primitive = primitive * 2 \n when de-compiled to Java, it is clear: the Price is treated same as a Float:\n  float price = 9.99F; float primitive = 5.99F; price *= (float)2; primitive *= (float)2; \n We can use Price with the same ease as a primitive without any concern for impact on performance.\n On the other hand Price is distinct from a Float, so the following will fail.\n  def discount(v: Price): Price = v * 0.75f discount(5.99f) // Fails // Type Mismatch Error: // Found: (5.99f : Float) // Required: Price \n    submitted by    /u/edolgy  \n [link]   [comments]",

Unlike contravariant functors, covariant functors seem not operate on type-class instances, but on concrete data-types. Are covariant and contravariant functors in two distincly different categories?

Also not sure how to deal with the mutable aspects of dart in the purescript side.\n If this is a feasible work to do under two months I would give it a try and ask for some help in order to build a robust open source backend with the goal of becoming a real ASAP.\n Is there any information relative to making new backends including standardized tests?

Two main features set it apart from similar PureScript (or Haskell) libraries:\n  \nSQL like DSL\n  \nThe eDSL used tries to stay as close as possible to regular SQL. IMO, this has the advantage of making the translation from PureScript to SQL transparent, specially for more complex queries.\n So far, most common usage SQL keywords are supported, e.g., SELECT INSERT DELETE UPDATE UNION PREPARE, etc.\n  \nQuery mapper \n  \nQuery result rows are always expressed as records, with projected columns as keys. The query mapper can also be used independently from the DSL, in case raw SQL strings are needed.\n Feedback is highly welcomed.

His org file is here:\n https://github.com/tlestang/org-mode-reproducible-research/blob/main/org-mode-examples/RR.org\n The initial C++ code block works great to produce the array initial_data, but the subsequent python code block to plot the array doesn't work:\n #+header: :var timeseries=initial_data :results file :dir \"./figures/\" #+begin_src python import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt timeseries = np.array(timeseries) plt.plot(timeseries[:,0], timeseries[:,1]) plt.savefig(\"timeseries_vis.png\") return \"timeseries_vis.png\" #+end_src #+RESULTS: [[file:figures/timeseries_vis.png]] \n If I run the above I get: \n #+RESULTS: file:figures \n and no actual png output file is produced. If I run the block in :session mode that gives me IndentationError: Unexpected Indent. If I remove the indents and re-run I get SyntaxError: return outside function. I can get rid of this error by re-writing it as a function, and it then works. But I'd really like to know what is wrong with the original code, and how can I run it without :session? \n Many thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/ourobo-ros  \n [link]   [comments]",

When you are surfing on the web, and you come across a tutorial that you were looking for hours, and you consider that tutorial or parts of it a piece of gold to avoid boilerplate and save tons of hours of re-googling, how do you store that information using org-mode? \n Technically speaking, we are talking about non-actionable information that could be used potentially in the future. Do you use org-roam for this kind of stuff or what? And how do you organize the files, independent from your GTD workflow (if you have)? \n Would love to hear your methods, since I have a lot of tabs temporarily saved in bookmark on Firefox but I know that I would like to store that information filtered and processed by me.

From the documentation you have two options: inline or in a file-wide section. My footnotes are often too long to fit inline, so I can change the name of that section but CANNOT make a section-per-entry arrangement, which is what I really want. The way I have worked around this with my blog is to always have the entry I am publishing at the top of the file, so using org-footnote-new finds that entries footnote section first and inserts things where I want them to be. I've used this compromise successfully for quite some time, but it depends on the fact that you are not going to add footnotes to anything but the top entry.\n Now I am converting footnotes in a non-orgmode date made by someone else, and moving the elements to the top of the file is not an option. Does anyone know of a way of implementing an entry-by-entry footnote section (say, for every * entry, or every ** entry as the case may be) without moving the single entry to the top of the buffer? The goal is for each entry to have a working footnote section of its own, which works nicely with org-footnote-action.\n    submitted by    /u/WorldsEndless  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I'm going kinda crazy trying to understand what's going on here...\n Do org blocks allow TAB indentation without going into special editing mode via C-c ' ?\n I have the following relevant settings in my custom-set-variables block (i.e. edited via customize-mode.\n  '(org-edit-src-content-indentation 0) '(org-src-preserve-indentation nil) \n I used these settings because I was getting sick of editing code in the source block and having all the lines jump 2 spaces to the right.\n org-src-tab-acts-natively is set to t as well. \n But now when I write\n #+begin_src python def hello(): | #+end_src \n the cursor is stuck at the start of the line and I can't use TAB to indent to add a new line, i.e. to make it look like:\n def hello( ): print(\"hello) \n TAB used to work -- or atleast, I thought it was working. This github comment suggests that this facility was never actually available, and we always had to use C-c ' to edit code properly.\n Now, I have also set org-adapt-indentation to nil, because I prefer org-headings, sub-headings and text to be aligned with the buffer edge. If I set it to 1, it looks like there is some aligning going on when I hit TAB, but this is not perfect. Does this explain the \"pseudo-indenting\" that I had before, and there really is no inherent TAB indent in org blocks?\n    submitted by    /u/nonreligious  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I just started learning Common Lisp, mostly because there is a university class I could take in the future in which they just assume you already know the language going in; and so I downloaded the Portacle IDE, which is a bundle of (a forked version of?) Emacs, SBCL, QuickLisp, and Git. \n Currently, I am only using Emacs for my rudimentary Lisp programming, because I don't quite understand how to use Emacs properly. To put it into perspective, I find the much maligned text editor Vim far easier to use than Emacs, even though I had never really used the terminal in such a involved manner before I started programming with Vim. \n If I decided to download the \"regular\" version of Emacs to use for every programming language I know later in time, would that interfere with Portacle's version of Emacs?\n    submitted by    /u/AP145  \n [link]   [comments]",

This looked very useful but I can't find the package name or video anymore. Does this ring a bell for anyone? I believe the package was quite new.\n Bonus question, I'm looking to combine a weekly and daily entries automatically. I would like to have a list of todo's for the week, defined in my weekly entry, and display those at the top of my dailies automatically (creating the weekly if no exists yet).

I'm not sure exactly what I mean by all packages, I think I mean packages/settings that weren't installed using use-package ensure, or straight inside the use-package configuration, or maybe even that the packages weren't installed via MELPA, but by cloning a git repository. \n In any case there was a comment that (briefly) explained how to configure the package setup and behavior using a use-package configuration; I thought I'd saved it but didn't, now I can't seem to find it. If anyone has any idea what I'm going on about, please let me know!\n EDIT: I believe what I was looking for was use-package emacs and storing Emacs settings like (setq inhibit-startup-screen t) there, as raised in this post, found by u/graduale and u/scbagley. From other comments, it sounds like you can also configure built-in packages like dired using use-package as well, so that's helpful.

It seems that in my v28.0.60 if I open a tramp connection to a remote server that is behind a VPN, if the VPN connection is killed, emacs completely freezes. (to test, I just open a dired remote directory, and sever the connection. Instant beachballing.) I've tried setting tramp verbose mode to 10 and sending SIGUSR2, but am having trouble getting useful information (for me). Once the freezing happens, I can't recover and its becoming extremely frustrating. SIGUSR2 can at least let me get back into emacs, but in a debug mode. The only message I could see was about a premature ending and Forbiddent reentrant tramp. (I don't have the exact messages right now, but could get them.)\n I do have a copy of my v26 emacs, and it does not have the same problem. When the VPN/remote connection is killed, emacs locks up for a few seconds, before it simply times out, and I can keep going. Annoying, but not a show-stopper.\n In each case, I am starting with emacs -Q option and the only extra command I'm using before opening files is ido-mode.\n I did stumble on  this issue  which mentions that start-file-process-shell-command was changed between v26 and v28. Is what I am noticing something related to that?\n The behavior is very different between versions on the same computer (and ssh configuration), and I am loading things with the \"-Q\" option for no init file. Any pointers to how to track this down would be helpful. Did I compile without some magic flag in the configuration that was needed?\n    submitted by    /u/ThwompThwomp  \n [link]   [comments]",

In my current job, I do a lot of investigation into our production issues. org-mode is a huge part of my daily workflow, and I wanted something that would make it easier to save NewRelic queries (and their results) in org-mode as I typically will export an org-mode heading to html to format the text in a way that is easy to share between many different services (Confluence/Jira/Github/ect.). \n If there are any other NewRelic and Emacs users out there hopefully this is useful! Also, I'd love some feedback elisp wise as it's my first serious attempt at writing a package for Emacs. A lot is still pretty rudimentary like error handling, but if you have interest in something like this let me know as it currently meets my needs, and I'm wondering if I should take it further. \n https://github.com/mack1070101/nrql.el\n    submitted by    /u/mack1070  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi guys, I'm sharing a minimal recipe to build emacs with native compilation in macOS. More precisely, to add native compilation to your already working build procedure. I've found that it's extremely simple nowadays but also that instructions are scattered around the web, often outdated, sometimes hit-and-miss, sometimes buried deep inside complex build scripts that do a bunch of other things. So I wanted to get an up-to-date minimal working recipe and actually understand what I was doing instead of blindly copy&pasting code. The outcome gladly surprised me as trivial.\n Assuming you have brew installed and have checked out emacs-28:\n  brew install gcc brew install libgccjit ... ./configure --with-native-compilation ... \n Remarks:\n  \ngcc is not the compiler used during the traditional build. Instead, the clang installed alongside your macOS command line tools will be picked as usual. But gcc will be the one compiling elisp to native code (please correct me here if I'm wrong).\n \n--with-native-compilation flag is not required (it's already the default!) but by adding it you ensure that any issue while enabling native compilation gets reported loud and clear. If there is any problem, try this in order to diagnose it: https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/jit/intro/tutorial01.html.\n \nBe prepared for long build times. Also, you might feel disappointed the first time you launch your new build of emacs. But this is likely because the JIT compiler is compiling your packages (you may see a bunch of compiler warnings in *Messages*, new files appearing in ~/.emacs.d/eln-cache and some processes burning your CPUs).\n \nI'm on Big Sur 11.6.\n \n EDIT: I've been using it for a while it's really, but really, snappy! Now that I'm typing in this reddit textarea it feels clunky as in 2 hours average latency.\n    submitted by    /u/nnenneplex  \n [link]   [comments]",

I tried installing v. 28, but the problem persisted.\n I then noticed that, if I loaded and evaluated the file org-compat.el (in org-mode's lisp directory), the problem didn't occur. The function referred to in the error message (org-file-name-concat) is defined in that file, and is conditional upon a specific version of Emacs.\n I discovered that the problem was caused by an incompatibility of sorts between the (old) version of org-mode installed with Emacs on my machines, and the (newest) version of org-roam installed by straight.\n Apparently, Emacs loads the old, default version of org-mode rather than the newer one installed later by straight (something which other users have noticed before).\n My fix consisted in deleting the old version from my machines.\n On Linux, I deleted the org directory on /usr/share/emacs/27.2/lisp/\n and on Mac, on /usr/local/Cellar/emacs-plus@27/27.2/share/emacs/27.2/lisp/\n I wanted to shared this information with other users who might be experiencing similar issues.\n    submitted by    /u/pailanderCO  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I've written a transient.el menu with enough columns of shortcuts that the text starts to wrap at the right part of the screen when viewing on a smaller laptop display. Is there a best practice to modify the size of a transient's window? Ideally I'd like to remove the wrapping continuation lines of the transient's buffer, as the wrapping disrupts the layout of all the text. I'd also like to limit the transient window's height, though I've been playing around with transient-display-buffer-action without luck. If I could limit the window height and width, I'm guessing transient-scroll-up and transient-scroll-down would allow me to see whatever parts of the transient buffer are hidden by making the window smaller...\n The only working solution I've found is to use the predicate keywords (e.g., :if, :if-nil) to change up my transient's column arrangement depending on which computer I'm on, for example:\n (transient-define-prefix my-transient () [\"MISC\" [:if (lambda () (string= system-name \"MY-LAPTOP\")) (\"R\" \"Avy Char in Line\" avy-goto-char-in-line) (\"P\" \"Pop Mark\" avy-pop-mark) (\"DEL\" \"Other Buffer\" other-window)] ] [\"Help\" [:if (lambda () (string= system-name \"MY-LAPTOP\")) (\"SPC\" \"Avy char\" avy-goto-char)] ]) \n But I would prefer the solutions in the first paragraph if possible.

Git-Modes provides three simple major modes for editing Git configuration files.\n Previously these modes were available from Melpa as three separate packages named gitattributes-mode, gitconfig-mode and gitignore-mode. These packages have been removed and you should remove them locally too and then install git-modes, but make sure that it is already available before you do. That can take a few hours.\n The motivation for merging the packages into just one is that while many users may only regularly edit .git/config and maybe .gitignore, it is not such a bad thing if a major mode is ready to go when they first open .gitattributes.\n More in the announcement.\n    submitted by    /u/tarsius_  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm looking to write a function that will return a hierarchical list of all open Org files as well as the headings inside of them, and allow me to insert a link to any one of them, without having to leave the current buffer to store a link, or enter the heading manually.\n You can kind of patch this together using counsel-org-goto-all, which provides an alist of all headings from all open Org files, with entries (HEADER . MARKER). Just write your own Ivy action that uses (concat \"file:\" (marker-buffer (cdr x)) \"::*\" (car x)) in order to build the destination of the link and pass it to org-insert-link, then call that action on a goto-all candidate.\n However, this feels pretty bootleg, and doesn't work when linking to files. I tried concatenating the results of calling counsel-outline-candidates and counsel-buffer-or-recentf-candidates, but this doesn't give a nice hierarchical structure, and you have to start doing a bunch of ugly conditional stuff to tell if you're dealing with a file or a heading inside the action.

(Maybe a theme problem of coloration?)\n ex: In Selectrum/marginalia/orderless if I hit find-file and start typing something, and the filter list is say 10 items long.. if the mouse _happens_ to be in the bottom couple inches of screen, well, Selectrum will show a full width highlight on the row the mouse is on; which can mean that as you're typing, you're seeing two highglight lines - the one that is targetted by seledtrum if you hit (say) return, and the one the mouse is over. Its annoying since they colour the same (maybe fixable in theme, I'll check.) \n Likewise, in buffer+ buffer listing, the mouse will highlight a row, as will the one I'm looking at with the keyboard.\n Changing themes (if a buffer supports a face for mouse at all) all over the place could be error prine and annoying.\n What I think I'm proposing is .. define (say) a minor mode that causes the mouse pointer to be ignored, hidden, or even blocked (don't let the mouse enter the confines of the window the mode is applied to?) ... then I could add some hooks on say prog-mode to add this minor mode (as well as minibuffer, say).

But their user interfaces are always operated only from within the minibuffer.\n Are there any Emacs Lisp packages like these which could display almost exactly what you would see in the minibuffer, but in an actual buffer as a major mode instead, along the lines of ibuffer but for listing arbitrary strings and not just listing buffers?\n I would like a tool that works in Emacs sort of like how you would use \"dmenu\" to make a menu from text taken from STDIN. But for my use case, I would like to take an arbitrary newline-separated list of strings and make an interactive menu out of it in a separate Emacs buffer. Also it would be nice to have the ability to re-order list elements, the ability to mark elements (like you would do with files in Dired), and the ability to copy the list of marked items to the kill ring or else insert the list of items as a string into some other buffer, the same way that pressing \"Enter\" in Dmenu will dump the selected items to STDOUT.\n So for example, I would maybe select a region of my text buffer, press my key chord to turn that text it into a menu buffer in a new window, filter/rearrange/select elements, then press Enter and replace the region from whence it came.\n Does anyone know of a major mode like this, or a way of configuring something like Vertico to work in the way I described?

Specifically, I want <return> in my normal mode to call markdown-edit-code-block, but only when markdown-mode is active.\n I didn't want to add a binding that checks what the major mode is with cond and whatnot, as it didn't seem like a very clean or modular solution. Instead, I created a second minor mode with the one binding I need for markdown-mode and set it as a buffer-local variable. Now, when my normal mode activates, it checks whether the variable is non-nil, and calls it.\n It works, but since I don't know everything about emacs, I'm wondering if anyone has encountered this problem before and if there's an even simpler solution that I'm missing.\n    submitted by    /u/flora_best_maid  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi,\n I have recently switched to emacs from vim and so far my experience has been pretty good (still trying to get used to elisp). One of the things which I had setup in my vimrc was a compilation command which would compile my code, I had heard that emacs had a command called `compile` and I tried to use that. I had noticed that when I did not have evil mode enabled the `compile` command would behave the way I had wanted and use the windows on the screen, however once I had turned on evil mode the compile command would not use the windows on the screen as I had wanted, I think that the best way to illustrate this would be through some images of it works with evil mode right now and how I want it to work:\n Whenever I have one window open and I run `compile build.bat` the compile command would make a new split and put the compilation buffer in there and this is fine:\n https://preview.redd.it/xqro9chktrt71.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=8e8849d1b3306b59a875758543201aab26c6f9d0\n However, the problem primarily arises when I try to compile my code on the second split, if I open a new file on the window with the compilation buffer open and run `compile build.bat` like before, evil mode will cause emacs to open a new window and run the code there, I want it to behave like it did without evil mode enabled and simpy switch to the other window in a split on the screen and run it there (I have drawn an arrow showing where I want to to open the compilation buffer which emacs did without evil mode enabled):\n ​\n https://preview.redd.it/q3v36gp8urt71.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=aa8544c214cfd3322fba73cfbf9f0d3557456282\n    submitted by    /u/asimpleperson123  \n [link]   [comments]",

Here's an example, maybe you can help figuring out the term?\n  \nVisit a couple of files in a project folder (e.g. root has a .git/)\n Visit a couple channels on IRC via erc for team chat with colleagues\n Open 2 emails from your boss for reference\n  \nI usually navigate around by C-x b and filtering from there; sorted by recency, it makes switching back and forth simple.\n But let's say I have a potato computer and usually only 1 frame with 1 window open at a time or whatever, so the default is I look at 1 buffer. When I'm in IRC, I want to switch to other IRC buffers easily -- look at other channels, direct messages, whatever. Focus on these, don't show any other buffer in the suggestions.\n When I've switched to the project code, let's say I want to focus on other project buffers. (project.el and projectile do this already)\n Same with email: When I'm reading mail, show another mail buffer plz. Don't show me the IRC buffers or code.\n  \nI bet this has a name and tons of implementations, but I cannot figure this out. Like the ibuffer groupings work, maybe, but for buffer switching, ignoring stuff that's not in the current group.\n Any hints what to look for to narrow down the list of all buffers to \"related\" buffers?\n To write this myself, I'd filter (buffer-list) by condition(s), and pick a conditions based on context. E.g. if major mode is ERC, filter buffers by erc-mode:\n (require 'seq) (seq-filter (lambda (buf) (let ((buffer-major-mode (with-current-buffer buf major-mode))) (eq buffer-major-mode #'erc-mode))) (buffer-list)) \n Is that a thing already?\n    submitted by    /u/divinedominion  \n [link]   [comments]",

I am attempting to get Emacs set up to my liking for a lot of things (Python, Org Mode, LaTeX), but I am running into a problem.\n You see, I keep running afoul of company-mode, in that it decides at the last minute to produce a list of words associated with what I'm typing, and then, when I press enter (for a completely unrelated reason), it accepts the first choice, despite the fact that I had already typed what I wanted.\n No biggie, I just need to unset <return> for 'company-complete-selection, right?

Trouble is, not all information is saved in such a case. In particular, any other BCCs I have on the message are lost. This is a problem for the times I need to do \"undisclosed\" recipients lists. The answer seems like FCC field, which I notice NotMuch attempts to add on its own on the occasions I have mistakenly tried to write something through a NotMuch route.

          "description": "tl;dr; Do most people set their org-roam-directory to be the same as org-dictionary? And those that do not - why not?\n I have used pure org for my note taking & TODOs so far. However I do think I would benefit from org-roam/zettelkasten for subset of what I need - keeping a personal knowledge base (debugging history, analyzing problems, keeping track of stuff that has a potentially longer-term benefit, more wishy-washy \"plans\").\n What triggered this question was the fact that org-roam does not reuse org directory but has a separate variable for its roam directory. So I wondered if there was a reason to have org files that are not also roam files. One reason that came up was that the number of roam files can grow significantly and org-agenda would get slower and slower. So...\n My current setup idea is this:\n  \nI separate out org files from roam (or rather have roam files in a subdirectory of org directory)\n Use roam for knowledge-base, journal etc\n I generally won't do TODOs etc in roam files, but instead have a TODOs/Schedules in ordinary org (and these files are going to be part of agenda files)\n  \nBasically - use org-roam for idea/note taking that might or might not be related to tasks but don't actually mix tasks into the zettels. Zettels could be referenced/linked to from tasks if needed (i.e. if some information/knowledge could be useful to get the task done)\n I read through https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/hg2m5s/zettelkastenorgroamorgbrain_is_crap/ as an example of discussion of problems/benefits (though I realize that's for roam v1 and quite out of date I expect most problems to be the same currently).\n Does anyone use a similar split? How is it? What would I miss (I can imagine referencing agenda items from zettels might be useful etc). If you think I should just merge the two and use org-roam - how do you deal with agenda? Fixed set of agenda files (subset of roam files)?\n Hope the above makes sense...\n ​\n Edit: Added TL;DR\n    submitted by    /u/podtatranec  \n [link]   [comments]",

However, when I tried it with my flutter project it didn't work although it booted up the dartanalyzer I'm wondering if dart-server still works or is a viable option for dart/flutter dev in emacs.\n Also, what're your thoughts on eglot, does it stay out of my way until I request for features just like dart-server (e.g. C-c ? to give details about symbol under point, or M-/ for auto completions, rather than constant popups in miniframes and the echo area)\n This subreddit has been so helpful in my journey with emacs... thank you all\n EDIT:: sorry for wasting your time, after trying a few times, dart-server seems to work in the flutter project (also some things still aren't working, like flycheck support and intelligent completion with M-/). However, I'm still curious about eglot... I'd like some of the lsp features, but mainly on-demand\n    submitted by    /u/hungry_m8  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi guys, My emacs has been quite slow (esp. with lsp-mode/lsp-dart), I've downloaded gccemacs to hoping for some performance gain... I noticed that it took around 129 secs to startup ((emacs-init-time))); I tried it again, and this time, it took around 5.7 secs so I think it was compiling the .el files on the first run. Next thing I did was to start the normal emacs build to compare; This took around 150 - 200 secs, but like 10-12 secs on subsequent launches. When I tried gccemacs again, It took just as long as the first time again.\n It seems that the .elc files are not fully compatible between the two and so they are recompiled... Is there anything I can do about this? I'd love to use the gccemacs, but doesn't seem to be stable yet as I keep on getting comp warnings pop up in a Warnings buffer which is disturbing.\n I thought gccemacs would compile down to .eln while the normal emacs would compile to elc\n My gccemacs is v28.0.5 and normal emacs is like v27.2 Thanks in advance.\n    submitted by    /u/hungry_m8  \n [link]   [comments]",

I read Wiki pages with eww and I would like jump to urls with the same visual approach as evilem-motion-*, i.e., where the candidates are prefixed by letters.\n Defining the motion\n I followed the definition of the evilem-motion-* motions to create a new one based on shr-next-link:\n (after! evil-easymotion (evilem-make-motion evilem-motion-shr-next-link #'shr-next-link :scope 'line)) (map! :after eww :map eww-mode-map (:prefix \"g\" :n \"<tab>\" #'evilem-motion-shr-next-link)) \n Which works as intended, but only highlight links in the current line while I wanted to highlight all the links in the window. This happend because I am using :scope 'line.\n Defining the window scope\n I managed to understand what was the scope handled by evil-easymotion, i.e., everything recognised by the thing-at-point function. But I didn't find any predefined thing matching the window. Thus, I have created a new one:\n (defun window-bounds-of-window-at-point () \"Return the start and end points of a window.\" (save-excursion (message \"%d-%d\" (window-start) (window-end)) (cons (window-start) (window-end)))) (put 'window 'bounds-of-thing-at-point 'window-bounds-of-window-at-point) \n And then I changed the scope of evilem-motion-shr-next-link from 'line to 'window.\n Problem\n Everything work well, except that (window-end) returns a different value when I run evilem-motion-shr-next-link via the eval prompt, i.e., pp-eval-expression, or via my keybinding.\n For instance, on (eww \"https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/IntegerAtPoint\") with the cursor at the beginning, the debuging message in window-bounds-of-window-at-point returns:\n  \n1-870 via the keybinding\n \n1-1531 via the eval prompt\n \n Questions\n  \nDoes someone know why there is this difference between the two approaches to call the function?\n \nIs there a simpler and more efficient solution to what I am doing?\n \n Thank you in advance!\n Edit: Fix the formatting\n    submitted by    /u/Zar_Rok  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello all. I am trying to create a website in HTML, and I would like to use Emacs org mode for that. The goal is to replicate this, https://html5up.net/dimension, in org mode. The index.html file looks something like this:\n <html> <!-- start main html block --> <head> <!-- start head definition like title, css..--> <head> <!-- start head definition like title, css..--> <body> <!-- start main body --> <body> <!-- end main body --> <html> <!-- end main html block --> \n Within the main body, you have stuff like <div>...</div>, <header>...</header>,<footer>..</footer>...etc. The head definition for css, title, language is easy. In my org mode, I do this:\n #+HTML_HEAD: <title>Tab title for website</title> #+HTML_HEAD: <meta charset=\"utf-8\" /> #+HTML_HEAD: <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no\" /> #+HTML_HEAD: <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"assets/css/main.css\" /> #+HTML_HEAD: <noscript><link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"assets/css/noscript.css\" /></noscript> \n Basically, copy the content between <head>....</head> in the #+HTML_HEAD. The <body>...</body> is automatically create when you type stuff in the ... body of the document. That is fine too. The problem is the nested div, header, footer within body. \n To simplify the problem, the snippet in the body has this form:\n <X id/class = \"Y\"> ...some code here... </X> \n where X can be head if you do <head>...</head>, and Y is the keyword you use in the document for class and id, e.g:\n <div class=\"logo\"> <i class=\"fas fa-fighter-jet\"></i> </div> \n How do I enter the above code in Org mode? Additionally, how do I nest them? What about the code in between them, use org-babel block?\n    submitted by    /u/Artistic-Boss-2430  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have run into two questions that someone may have the answers to.\n  \nTrying to use any processor other than 'basic' results in an error. For testing my configuration is very simple:\n  \n (use-package org :demand t :pin gnu :config (setq org-cite-export-processors '((latex natbib) (t basic)))) \n If I export to latex with this setup, it results in org-cite-store-export-processor: Unknown processor natbib error. Only basic works. The biblatex, natbib, and csl exporters all result in the same error. Is it really going to force me to perform a (require 'oc-xxx) for each of them?\n  \nThe styles seem a bit limited to me. Is there an option to provide a reference in place without a bibliography? One common use case is produce a list of publications in a chosen order (e.g., NSF-style CVs require \"Five relevant publications\"). With latex, this is commonly done with \\nobibliography and \\bibentry. Unfortunately, I don't see support for either in the table provided in the very nice Introduction.\n  \nIs it possible to not insert a bibliography? It would make sense that if citations are used and exported to latex without the #+print_bibliography directive that it automatically inserts \\nobibliography.\n For inserting references rather than citations, is there a style I am missing? It might make sense to have an r style that inserts the full reference in place (if exporting to latex, it would use \\bibentry while basic would simply insert the reference text).\n Anyhow, I appreciate hearing whether I am missing something on these issues.\n    submitted by    /u/atomicham  \n [link]   [comments]",

Checking load-history showed that nearly all the org.*.elc files that were getting loaded were from the built-in version of Org instead of the one cloned by straight. \n Maybe I was just hallucinating that it was ever working: at least if that's the case, it provides a way for my best present theory to be true, which is that the built-in Org is getting loaded as a side-effect of me having a literate configuration. I printed the load-path variable at the beginning of my init.el file (which is basically just (org-babel-load-file \"~/.emacs.d/config.org\")), and the straight version of Org wasn't on the path yet. This has me thinking that when Emacs hits \"org-babel-load-file\" it loads the only version of Org available on the path - i.e. the built-in version.\n If so, what's the fix? Does keeping a literate config force you to do some ugly workarounds with setting the load-path manually prior to running \"org-babel-load-file\" or pinning what version of a package you use through straight, or is there some cleaner option I don't know of?

          "description": "I used to have 3 monitors on my desk, but when I started working from home, I just had the 1 monitor, and for various reasons, I still only have the 1 and it's unlikely to change.\n I used to have several small, single-purpose frames off on a second monitor, and one of them was for compilation output. It's been 18 months with just one monitor, and I still haven't found a solution that I like.\n Currently, I've got a child frame that pops up compilation output in the middle of my main frame. It hides itself if the compilation succeeds. I don't really like this because there's a lot of extra handling that I have to do, focus switching is weird (like if I'm in my web browser and click on the child frame, it's in focus, but the main frame doesn't come to the front. I have to click on a buffer in the parent frame), and it doesn't play nicely with which-key, etc.\n I've tried some solutions where the buffer switches to the compilation output and the buffer hides itself afterwards, but those are honestly kinda janky. \n So I'm on the verge of going back to a compilation frame--dedicated or not--but then the cues that compilation is still ongoing or has failed or succeeded might be hidden if I'm working on something else. (I used to try modifying the modeline in every active buffer, but that caused weird conflicts with doom modeline and other things that also wanted to play with the display.)\n There's a tradeoff with everything; I'm not looking for a perfect solution, I'm just curious what other people do.\n    submitted by    /u/vjgoh  \n [link]   [comments]",

I love using org files, and displaying them in Emacs is wonderful: I have my config set up to present subtrees indented, hide leading stars, etc.\n However, I would like to improve how my .org files look when accessed by other editors (or when printed out). Without the illusion of indentation that comes from editing .org files in Emacs, the documents are (at least in my opinion) extremely hard to decipher at-a-glance; there is no obvious visual relationship between headings and subheadings.\n Ideally, I would like for the content under subheadings to actually be indented in the text files, so that they would be easy to read/skim in other editors. My searching led to me to this page in the manual, which seems to explain that this can be done if the following settings are used:\n (setq org-adapt-indentation t org-hide-leading-stars t org-odd-levels-only t) \n However, even after adding these settings to my config, the behavior doesn't change: when I save a .org buffer, it is written to disk without hard indentation.

While doing it, I got carried away with the latest commit message, which related to adding my consult-dir and embark configurations into Doom.

Flymake log says: *** No rule to make target 'check-syntax'. Stop.\n So I did a way simpler project, just a file.c and a Makefile, with default flymake and that worked fine. So I removed the check-syntax part from the Makefile and put it on a flymake.mk, all three files in the same directory. Now again with the custom init and doesn't work either. First of all, I tried to see if the custom init was being selected, and it does, when I run (flymake-proc--get-fi…",

          "description": "tldr; You can use C-u M-x command-name to pass the Universal Argument into an interactive command. This is helpful if you do not want to bind the command to a hotkey, but still want to pass the Universal Argument into it.\n I recently encountered a situation with the anki-editor package where I wanted to pass the Universal Argument into the anki-editor-push-notes function. I did not want to create a keyboard shortcut for this command because I will use it less than once a day. First I tried things like M-x anki-editor-push-notes(4) and M-x (anki-editor-push-notes '(4)) but neither of those worked. Then, following this guide, I created a wrapper function that calls (anki-editor-push-notes '(4)). This worked fine. I could call my wrapper function which would in turn call the function I really wanted to run with the Universal Argument passed in; however, I figured out a more succinct way. Pressing C-u M-x anki-editor-push-notes will pass the Universal Argument into the command. In my opinion this is better because I don't have to have that extra function in my init.el and I don't have to remember two slightly distinct commands.\n I figured if I didn't know about this and the author of this guide may not have known about this, then there may be other people on the subreddit who do not know about this. So I am just trying to share a cool thing I learned.\n    submitted by    /u/echostrike36  \n [link]   [comments]",

If I want to pivot to an unrelated project/task, I open a new Emacs frame and edit the relevant files to that project there.\n  \nI'm curious to know if this is the standard in the Emacs community. I sometimes think this workflow is a bit too resource intensive, and it seems wasteful to execute init.el several times and load all my packages etc. every time I do something new (although it takes <5 sec to load, which I'm happy with).\n An alternative would be running one instance of Emacs, then doing e.g. C-x 5 2 to open a new frame (but now init.el is not re-evaluated) every time I want to work on a different project/task. This also feels a bit resource heavy -- maybe the resolution of this problem is just to not open so many things at once!\n What is your workflow, and do you think it's efficient memory wise, or helpful in terms of organization?\n    submitted by    /u/nonreligious  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I'm trying to write an emacs w3m filter for duckduckgo lite. I thought it would be cool to leverage magit-section, and have each result in its own section. So I have a function for inserting the sections from parsed 'result-groups' (a group is all the DOM material for one result):\n (defun my/w3m-insert-duckduckgo-section (group) (let ((href (cdar (cdadar group))) (title (caddar group)) (body (cddr (nth 1 group)))) (magit-insert-section (result) (magit-insert-heading (insert (format \"%s\\n\" title))) (insert (format \"%s\\n\" \"this-is-the-body\"))))) \n I'm using the \"this-is-the-body\" string in place of an actual body at the moment, because I haven't got round to learning about parsing DOM text yet.\n I run this in a loop over all the groups, inserting each one. This runs inside a root section I insert first.\n This inserts the relevant text, but with no special properties (e.g. magit sections normally have certain faces) and no newlines. Everything is on one line, just running on to the next result.\n If I run something like this in a scratch buffer, the result is correct:\n (magit-insert-section (root) (magit-insert-section (result) (magit-insert-heading (format \"%s\\n\" \"Header text 1\")) (insert (format \"%s\\n\\n\" \"this-is-the-body\"))) (magit-insert-section (result) (magit-insert-heading (format \"%s\\n\" \"Header text 2\")) (insert (format \"%s\\n\" \"this-is-the-body\")))) \n Running eval-last-sexp after this in the scratch buffer works exactly as expected (standard magit section text properties, newlines are printed correctly). What's most stange is that if I use eval-expression to run the above form in a w3m buffer, it works correctly! Correct faces and properties etc.\n So, why do the newlines and properties not show up in the w3m buffer when I call the forms programatically vs interactively, and how can I fix this?\n TIA!\n    submitted by    /u/Jack-o-tall-tales  \n [link]   [comments]",

So, I deem the foundation to be layed out.\nThe next two branches that start to grow (in my Zettelkasten first) are:\nSpecialised applications of the Zettelkasten\nThinking tools that work within the frame work of the Zettelkasten Method. Cognitive Mapping is an example. (Big shoutout to u/thomasteepe for the term Integrated Thinking Environment (originally Integrated Thought Development Environment))\nThe first aspect is now what I am preparing in my Zettelkasten. So, I want to ask you if I forgot an important user case. In my Zettelkasten, I have the following:\nStudents\nTeachers (Mostly geared towards the German Schools System at the moment)\nBloggers\nVisual Artists\nFiction Writers\nNon-Fiction Writers\nLawers and judges\nTheologicans (and studying the bible)\nScientists\nHumanities\nNon-Scientists (~private use like dog training, cooking, hobbies, child upbringing etc.)\nAnything missing?\nLive long and prosper\nSascha",

Some research observed differences in cognitive performance between 15-20% based on nutrition intake (high cal/protein/fat vs low). From my own experience, if I'm hungry I get distracted more often and find it harder to enter the flow state of work.\nIn How Not to Die, the author points to research that observed consumption of burgers/meat lead to a very noticeable decline in cognitive performance minutes after consumption.\nIn his essay writing guide, Jordan Peterson recommends eating something high in fat and protein first thing in the morning before writing. He also talks about the importance of waking up early & working in the morning. Peterson also said in another interview that he solved a clients anxiety problems by making her eat more. This suggests a link between not getting proper nutrition and anxiety.\nThe Netflix documentary \"The Game Changers\", Connor McGregor puts part of the blame of his loss on eating too much steak - not having energy during the fight. This documentary argues vegetable-based diets are just as effective for building muscle as meat ones, as well as being more healthy for anyone interested.\nI haven't done much research into this question obviously \nMy question(s) to you is: have you experimented with different foods and consumption schedules to boost your cognitive performance during knowledge work sessions? Do you know any interesting resources to continue this line of research?",

          "description": "Hello fellow zettelnauts,\nI use the ##tag method from Sasha to signify a root link or parent link attached to a note. When I search for ## I also get all the H2 sections.\n##links to @#links, is there a way to have a saved search with a joker like to catch every terms beginning with @# like @#$ or @#catchall?\nTo organize myself I use ttt to signify a note as a terrain in french, meaning field, for me they work not like hubs. And I have the feeling I would appreciate to have a saved search with ttt AND my root tags to get an idea of where my energy is going.\nThank you",

          "description": "Hello, fellow Zettlers!\nBeing fresh to both Zettelkasten method and this forum, I have to first and foremost ask for your forgiveness if this was already discussed or perhaps it is stupidly obvious, but I struggled to find any threads relating to the following conundrum: how to deal with fields of knowledge or areas of practice, which are subject to significant changes in relatively short time frames?\nExample: I am a lawyer based in an EU member state, practicing in a global industry dealing with several fields of law (e.g. intellectual property or privacy law) which are subject to quite dynamic changes (due to legislative actions on EU and state level, ever growing case law, technological changes, etc.). Of course, some concepts fundamental to jurisprudence or terminology specific to a given field may stay relevant for some time. However, due to this high variability, when taking notes regarding more practical and recent issues I face the problem of dealing with \"volatile\" notes, which feel like they may unexpectedly, suddenly, in any moment become irrelevant, useless or even harmful (e.g. by severing an existing train of thought with a statement which is not true any more).\nMaybe this is my lack of understanding, but I feel there is a meaningful difference between evolution of sciences (regardless of its pace), where old models or theories give way to new ones, which explain given real phenomena better, or where new evidence provide a fresh look on the reality; \nlegal \"reality\" may change in an instant, rendering prior statements describing this \"reality\" not so much obsolete or outdated as simply not true any more (or true exclusively within a bound time frame).\nAre there any good practices or strategies helping to deal with such volatility of notes and tending the Zettelkasten without getting crazy?",

          "description": "A bit of background information may be useful. I'm from Uruguay. I graduated from high school with an engineering degree, then requested inscription for the faculty of engineering.\nHowever, I was a poor learner back then. Imagine short-term memorization on steroids. Effective short-term, not at all long-term. In other words, I remember nothing. Not even what an atom is.\nI'm not sure if this is important, but I'm adding it in case it is.\nI'm taking a gap year and now I'm working on choosing a career to pursue. I don't have the research skills necessary to get anywhere with this, so I don't know where to even begin. Also, at the same time, I can't do research on how to do research. Thus, I'm double stuck, if that's even possible.\nI've tried looking on Google, Reddit, and Wikipedia. Didn't help. Too much information, some of it not actionable, and I don't even know which is trustworthy.\nAny tips on how to get unstuck with this project? If research isn't important to complete it, some advice or resources on research would be helpful too. Research skills are crucial for most of what I do.",

          "description": "Michael Tsai featured a couple quotes from Matt Gemmell recently about monospace plain text and fully justified layout: \nhttps://mjtsai.com/blog/2021/09/30/manual-full-justification/\nThe linked twitter thread is worth a look.\nThe real banger is this document: https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/snes/588741-super-metroid/faqs/10114\nYou don't have to actually read it; it's a guide/walkthrough for a Super Nintendo game. The interesting detail is that the author accomplished full text justification without tweaking the spacing between words. That's how you usually accomplish that effect in e.g. MS Word or other desktop publishing applications. The space between words is stretched.\n\nBut here, there's only ever 1 space between words.\nSo the author had to write everything to fit. Conversely, that means words and sentence structures had to be picked because of their length to properly fill the available space.\nMatt Gemmell points out that this is not a feat one is likely to accomplish for the lulz. It's serious effort. And that document sure as heck is long! Now that's some plain text dedication",
