You could solve this by using different schemas or database or whatever else but we have Haskell at our disposal, so let's focus (but not constrain) the discussion on that.\n The goals are:\n  \nMake it very hard (but maybe not impossible) for tenants to access each other's data\n End up with a convenient interface\n Use an already established DB library\n  \nI've worked on a few projects with such multi tenancy and have never really been \"satisfied\" with how we've done this.\n Project 1 used template Haskell to generate \"repository\" code that had the filtering built-in. We were lucky enough that for our usecase this was fine. TH was not very pleasant to use and the approach is rather limiting.\n Project 2 was simply relying on the developers to not forget to add the appropriate filter.\n Project 3 uses a custom database library that has quite a lot of type level wizardry but it basically boils down to attaching the tenant id filter at the end of each query. The downside is that we basically need to reimplement everything that already exists in established DB libraries from scratch. Joins are a pain so we resort to SQL views for more complicated queries.\n Is there an established way people go about this? Maybe some DB libraries already can handle it?\n    submitted by    /u/dnikolovv  \n [link]   [comments]",

Most of the problems involve searching/traversal of the graph, and I'm pretty confused about how to approach the solutions idiomatically. I'm looking for some help in evaluating one the following options:\n  \nBasic recursion: Pass the state around during recursive calls, and use if-then-else to prune/terminate as necessary. This is the simplest choice, but results in similar-looking boilerplate code. \n Same as above but using the State monad.\n Model a search problem as a tuple of (start value, expanding frontier function, terminating condition), and provide implementations of the 2nd and 3rd items for each algorithm. This model is shown here and looks promising in reducing boilerplate.\n Read a novel academic paper, like Structuring Depth-First Search Algorithms in Haskell or Backtracking, Interleaving, and Terminating Monad Transformers and come up with an implementation. FWIW, it seems like the Data.Graph library implementation is based on the former paper (but for the purposes of the exercise I shouldn't use).\n Logic and Continuation: This option is mentioned in passing in some places but there is exactly zero online literature available as far as any practical examples go. None whatsoever. I don't even know why would I choose this option, other than it potentially reducing boilerplate. The H-99 problems aren't for infinite graphs, and ask for all answers, not the first one, so, fairness/interleaving isn't really a concern.\n  \nA somewhat related question had been asked before, although it focussed on a specific advent of code problem and lacked the research I've laid out above. Nothing against the question, just saying that the comments there don't preempt my question.\n What would be the most elegant option?

I love the idea of doing it in Haskell and also doing it properly™ (i.e. overengineering the hell outta it lol).\n I already have a program (involuntarily written in Java) to store/output the board state and determine whether someone won.\\ What I intend to create is the following: 1. a protocol between the Java program and 2. (see below)\\ this will contain things like \"NEWGAME\", \"TURN xy\", \"RESPONSE zw\", etc. 2. a Haskell program that implements that protocol to actually generate a good next move and send it back to the Java application, which 3. I will modify to be able to talk to my \"engine\"\n So what is your folks' opinion on how to structure the Haskell code / protocol?\\ I came up with this: - CECP-/UCI-like protocol: one move sent at a time, my program would need to store that somehow\\ however, I don't have any idea on how to elegantly do this in Haskell and wonder whether it can even be done idiomatically - get the complete board state as input each time and output the next move / new state; as easy as it gets and seems to fit really well with the functional paradigm BUT extremely inefficient and not what I would do if I was programming it in another language (also apparently not how most protocols work…)\n Dear, epic, most valued, mathematically blessed computer scientists, can you bestow some advice upon me, so I can maybe become worthy of joining your ranks one day?\n Thanks in advance and happy holidays! :)\n    submitted by    /u/TheKiller36_real  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Dear Haskellers,\n I have a question about streaming libraries (streamly, conduit, streaming, etc.). I am trying to write a little application to remap user input events (keyboard, mouse, etc.) so I am dealing with low-volume, lazy streams. Additionally, the actual remapping will depend on a user configuration file. \n I have gotten suggestions to use a streaming library to represent the basic datatype in my app, something I did look into but quickly abandoned because of a rather daunting amount of choice and considerations. However, now is the time for me to make a decision, since going back and refactoring everything after the fact is going to be a huge time-sink. So:\n I am currently under the impression that the biggest benefit of the streaming libraries is speed, and that that speed is generated by doing ghc-optimization tricks. I am also under the impression that speed is not that important in my domain, and that since I don't know which stream-transformations I will be composing at compile time (since I'll be reading the transformations from user-config), I wouldn't even be able to benefit from these performance gains.\n Is my understanding correct? Am I missing something? My home-rolled solution uses binary and a Chan and async to set up different event readers by parsing from lazy bytestrings, writing to the chan to merge the results, and then represents the input as a lazy, infinite list that then gets passed to my pure remapping engine. It seems to work fine. Am I setting myself up for some unforeseen disaster in the future? \n The reason I've been avoiding these solutions is also just because my productive time is limited and very unreliable, so the cognitive overhead of a completely new set of abstractions comes with its own cost.\n Thank you for any advice you may proffer.\n    submitted by    /u/janssen_dhj  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "This is a recurring issue for me when I do Advent of Code, which I do in Haskell - some problems are really suited for using memoization. I tried to condense my confusion to as close to the pain point as possible, and I am hoping someone here can help me understand where my thinking goes wrong. Here is a code block with a few different ways of calculating a Fibonacci sequence:\n import Data.Function.Memoize main :: IO () main = do -- slow print $ fib 35 -- fast print $ fibMemo 35 -- slow print $ (memoize fibMemo2) 35 fib :: Int -> Int fib 0 = 1 fib 1 = 1 fib n = fib (n-1) + fib (n-2) fibMemo :: Int -> Int fibMemo = memoize fib' where fib' 0 = 1 fib' 1 = 1 fib' n = fibMemo (n-1) + fibMemo (n-2) fibMemo2 :: Int -> Int fibMemo2 0 = 1 fibMemo2 1 = 1 fibMemo2 n = (memoize fibMemo2) (n-1) + (memoize fibMemo2) (n-2) \n Note here that two functions are really slow - both the first and last one. But in my mind, the second one (which is fast) is exactly the same as the third one (which is slow). What is the difference here? Both of them recursively call memoize on themselves, which tells me I am missing something critical.\n    submitted by    /u/JGuillou  \n [link]   [comments]",

We had a browser based program that used a VM to store our files, and we edited everything on jupyter notebook. I basically had everything setup for me in the class at school. I didn't initialize or setup any of the programs.\n ​\n The class inspired me to try and code more here at home, I just got a book, Learning Physics with Functional Programming. They use Haskell as the language. I've got a macbook, and I have no idea how to set anything up. I barely understand what I'm doing. Believe me I've been watching tutorial after tutorial, but there's always some error I get that these tutorials don't address. I'm trying to become code literate.\n ​\n In that case I thought maybe I could get help here? I went to Haskell.org, and used the terminal command from there to install GHcup. Afterwards, I opened up VScode and downloaded the Haskell extension. Then, I tried to start a new project and begin working along the book I bought. \n The problem is that anytime I set Haskell as my language for a new note in VScode, it gives the error that \"Project requires GHcup but it isn't installed. Source: Haskell (extension)\"\n ​\n I've tried going into my ~bash file to inspect the path of the GHcup file, but the terminal denies me access to it. I'm not even sure if that's what would help fix this either, but I saw a lot of reference to this on Haskell Troubleshooting forum links from VScode.\n ​\n Sorry for my incapability... this kinda makes me want to keep using my whiteboard for physics but I really want to be able to do bigger calculations on a computer, and not on Python.\n ​\n If I could get any help I'd appreciate it a lot\n    submitted by    /u/redflactober  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Although I have been studying functional programming in Haskell (and Agda) as part of my university course for over a year now, and we’ve covered the basics and more advanced topics like monads, states, writing interpreters etc., I’d like to start from scratch to revise and strengthen my knowledge, thus I composed a list of books to do so.\n Stage 1: Basics - Programming in Haskell\n Stage 2: Advanced topics - Real World Haskell - Haskell in Depth\n Stage 3: Specialised topics - Parallel and Concurrent Programming in Haskell - Functional Design and Architecture (early-access)\n To those who have read some (or perhaps all) of these books, would you recommend them in this order? Individual book opinions are welcomed too, or if you think I should take a look at another, non-mentioned book, feel free to share!\n Thank you in advance!\n PS: I am familiar with the book ‘Haskell Programming from First Principle’, which AFAIK covers not just the basics, but advanced topics as well. My only issue with it, and consequently the reason why it is not on the list, is that it has no physical edition available anymore, and I’d like to stick with those books that have one. About ‘Learn You a Haskell for Good!’; it had some rather poor reviews on the sub so I ditched it. ‘Programming in Haskell’ seems more professional and serious anyways. But if you’ve read both of them, do tell your experience.\n    submitted by    /u/azurerug  \n [link]   [comments]",

How can I know that whether it's really working properly, all the time, with every feature working?\n For example, how can I jump to functions defined in src/Lib.sh from reference in App/Main.hs?

I've narrow the actual problem down to 2 very stripped down scenarios, 1 that works, and 1 that doesn't. Both are being run in exactly the same simple IO function that just grabs a lazy bytestring that is being generated from an evdev file and feeds it to the function and tries to print the result.\n works :: L.ByteString -> [ByteString] works = L.foldrChunks chomp [] where chomp b acc = b : acc doesnot :: L.ByteString -> [ByteString] doesnot = fst . L.foldrChunks chomp ([], []) where chomp b (acc, bcc) = (b : acc, b : bcc) test :: IO () test = do withEvdev \"/dev/input/by-id/usb-Technomancy_Atreus-event-kbd\" $ \\byts -> do mapM_ print $ works byts -- mapM_ print $ doesnot byts \n The first function works as expected, it returns a lazy list of strict bytestrings that accumulate as keyboard events are generated. And the testing function prints out data as it comes in. The second function simply will not ever run. I've covered it with trace statements and changed the accumulator to undefineds and the pattern matches to underscores. Doesn't change anything. Somehow changing the accumulator to a tuple seems to turn the whole handling of the loop strict?\n    submitted by    /u/janssen_dhj  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I was just playing around with Haskell and there are a few things I couldn't understand about the syntax rules of let and do blocks.\n Consider the following code:\n listings = [x | i <- [0..10], let x = i * i, x > 20] -- [25,36,49,64,81,100] \n I was thinking instead of using this sugar, why not use a do block, which is a more common sugar. So I came up with this, following this:\n listing = do i <- [0..10] let x = i * i guard (x > 20) return x \n I actually prefer removing the do sugar as well, like this:\n listing = [0..10] >>= (\\i -> let x = i * i in guard (x > 20) >> return x) \n This got me thinking, can I use do so that I can avoid >>= and >>, but also keep it a one liner. So I followed this, this and this and got the following to work:\n listing = do {i <- [0..10]; let {x = i * i} in do guard (x > 20); return x} \n But I was hoping for something like this, which did not work:\n listing = do {i <- [0..10]; let x = i * i; guard (x > 20); return x} \n I am not really sure why. But I figured it might be because of let. I tried to get rid of it but I wasn't able to, unless I just remove all sugar and have something like this:\n listing = [0..10] >>= (\\i -> (\\x -> guard (x > 20) >> return x) (i * i)) \n Which is, funnily enough, shorted then the do version. Long story short, I don't understand the rules of do and let. Can someone explain in simple terms? By the way, is let also sugar, it doesn't seem like it to me, because my lambda seems to make a dependency on the ordering of variables, but I'm not sure. I didn't consider using where so I'm not sure of it's behavior.\n    submitted by    /u/Alternative_Bug_5096  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "There are things about data engineering I've really enjoyed, but after 2 years it has started to become quite stale and boring. The part of the job I have enjoyed the most is when I get to work with python and spark (the more software engineery stuff with data engineering). So given that scala is the language spark was written in, and what many data engineers had been using for a long time (and some still do), I decided it could be worthwhile learning.\n Also, I'd really like to transition into a more software engineering centric role in my next job, and have been learning Scala as a means by which to achieve this. My logic was that if I learn Scala the worst case scenario is that I get better at coding, (data engineering with python will only take you so far in terms of developing software engineering skills), and even though it is dying out as a language for DE in favour of python, it might help with employability for DE jobs. The upside is I may be able to get a Scala Developer/Engineer role that pays better, and which I may be better suited to and enjoy more.\n After reading a lot of posts on this subreddit, it seems people are growing increasingly pessimistic regarding the employability of scala, so I wanted some general advice regarding my approach. My current plan has been: Learn Scala -> Personal Projects -> Scala Data Engineer / Scala Engineer -> Scala Engineer/Developer. From what I have seen online Scala Engineer Jobs in my area (London) are very lucrative but I imagine there is a high barrier to entry, and worry that this transition isn't realistic.\n I'm currently working through the Scala RocktheJVM course and am enjoying what I have learnt so far, and will likely continue regardless.

          "description": "Hi. I wrote a quick minesweeper clone in scala.js w/ laminar to test them out. Website is here, code here.\n Besides the code not being the cleanest (beginner programmer – all advice welcome), there's one bug I haven't been able to crush: on Firefox you can accidentally right-click a cleared square and get a context menu popup. This is not desirable, as it at best slows you down and at worst leads to accidentally leaving the page via said menu.\n Relevant code from Main.scala:\n dom.document.addEventListener(\"contextmenu\", e => e.preventDefault()) \n On Chromium things work as expected – no context menu anywhere, ever.\n What I've tried:\n  \nonContextMenu --> { e => e.preventDefault() } literally everywhere: buttons, tbody, table etc.\n onContextMenu --> { e => println(\"here\") } similarly everywhere to find out that when right-clicking a disabled button, nothing on the page seems to receive the pointer event, meaning there's nothing to block it, which then leads to Firefox opening the context menu\n pointer-events: none; for disabled buttons, which breaks things on (at least some) mobile browsers since the browser thinks that a tap on a disabled button was \"really\" meant for its neighbour, which is... not good!\n  \nSo, is this something that needs to be fixed in Firefox, or am I missing something obvious?\n Thanks.\n edit. This is a Firefox bug https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1543196 \n Minimal reproducible example for this particular case just because:\n <!DOCTYPE html> <head> <style> body { margin: 0; padding: 0; height: 100vh; } </style> </head> <body oncontextmenu=\"return false;\"> <button>No context menu</button> <button disabled=\"true\">Context menu :(</button> </body> </html> \n ​\n    submitted by    /u/scalaccount  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Graal Native Image is a technology to compile Java code ahead-of-time to a lightweight native binary executable, which has the advantages of smaller resources, starts in milliseconds, no warmup needed, and reduce attack surface. The serialization in graalvm is tricky and slow since it doesn't support reflection, jit, and bytecode manipulation. Many performance optimization can't be applied in graalvm.\n In Fury 0.4.0 version, Fury can run on GraalVM native image efficiently and is super easy-to-use. Neither reflection nor meta config are needed. Fury generates all code for Fury JIT framework and MethodHandle/LambdaMetafactory at graalvm native image build time. Then use those generated code for serialization at runtime without any extra cost, the performance is great.\n Compared to native JDK serialization, Fury can be 46x faster than JDK, and less than half of the serialized size.\n See https://github.com/alipay/fury/blob/main/docs/guide/graalvm_guide.md for example and benchmarks.\n This is a big step for jvm serialization, please give it a try and share us with your feedbacks.\n    submitted by    /u/Shawn-Yang25  \n [link]   [comments]",

If you've got experience with Scala or have opinions on it, I'd love to hear from you!\n Why should I learn Scala? What are the pros and cons?\n I've heard that Scala is a powerful and versatile language, but I'm curious about the real-world experiences of those who have used it. What advantages does Scala bring to the table, and are there any drawbacks that one should be aware of?\n Here are a few questions to get the discussion going:\n Pros:\n  \nWhat specific features of Scala do you find most beneficial in comparison to other languages, especially Java?\n Have you found Scala to be particularly well-suited for certain types of projects or domains?\n How has Scala's support for functional programming influenced your coding style and project architecture?\n  \nCons:\n  \nAre there challenges or pitfalls you've encountered while working with Scala that newcomers should be aware of?\n How does Scala's learning curve compare to other languages, and what resources would you recommend for someone starting out?\n Are there any specific scenarios or types of projects where Scala might not be the best fit?\n  \nFeel free to share your experiences, tips, or any resources you think would be helpful for someone considering learning Scala.

          "description": "Hi all,\n I've been using org-roam for a while now, but I recently started to go a bit deeper with customization and wanted your opinion on my current workflow and possible ways to automate and improve it.\n Basically, I'm trying to use org-roam as an issue tracker with issue, task and time management, similarly to tools like redmine.\n Currently my workflow is as follows:\n  \nI have an issues.org file containing all issues and their state (TODO, STRT, etc.)\n Every time a new issue comes in, I add it to that file and assign an id with `org-id-get-create`\n For that new issue, I also create a new org file specific to that issue to track description, comments, etc. and roam-link the original TODO item to it\n I use org-roam-dailies to then reference the TODO item from issues.org, clock spent time and add tasks as sub items.\n  \nThis is working mostly fine for me, I'm able to build precise monthly reports over the issues I've been working on, however, there's a bit of a \"disconnection\" between dailies and the overall issues file.\n As the issue state is only recorded in issues.org, the agenda never shows the actual state of the issue when I clock-in, as that's only a roam-link to the original issue. Conversely, time tracking only happens at the daily-level and it's never reflected back to the original issue. Also, having tasks as sub-items in the dailies makes it easy to track all tasks by searching for roam back references, but at the same time it creates a lot of duplication because sub tasks are not carried over to the next day for example.\n Here I'm asking for your opinion, because I'm not sure if I'm just using org and roam the \"wrong way\" and I'm not supposed to try to achieve any of this, or if it's a somewhat valid approach and I just need to automate it.\n Thank you all!\n ​\n ​\n    submitted by    /u/zuegg  \n [link]   [comments]",

For instance, I have the following document called test-export.org\n #+title: Quarto export test #+begin_src python import matplotlib.pyplot as plt #+end_src #+begin_src python plt.plot([1, 2], [2, 4]) #+end_src #+begin_src python :eval no print(\"Hello World!\") #+end_src \n I first try using pandoc to just export to markdown format:\n pandoc test-export.org -t markdown --o test-export.qmd \n test-export.qmd then looks like\n ``` python import matplotlib.pyplot as plt ``` ``` python plt.plot([1, 2], [2, 4]) ``` ``` {.python eval=\"no\"} print(\"Hello World!\") ``` \n The problem is that Quarto expects \n ```{python} \n to denote Python code blocks. (I can understand that pandoc makdown conversion should not know to convert :eval no to #| eval: false in the code block but that is secondary).\n I could write a post-text-processing script to handle this but I wonder if there is a more direct way to at least get the language specification to be {python} instead of python or {.python ...}. I have also tried exporting to other Markdown flavors using pandoc, and using Org-mode's built-in Markdown exporter. I guess the built-in exporter targets the original Markdown\n # Table of Contents import matplotlib.pyplot as plt plt.plot([1, 2], [2, 4]) print(\"Hello World!\") \n so is even further away from the Quarto form.\n AFAIK the Quarto documentation only defines the Quarto -> Org transformation and not the other way around. \n Thanks for your suggestions.\n    submitted by    /u/hat_matrix  \n [link]   [comments]",

The only way to solve this is by going into my ~/.emacs.d/elpa/ directory and manually removing the files for the updated org mode version.\n For reference, all my configurations are in a ~/.emacs document.\n How can I update org-mode without loosing all my configs?\n Thanks a lot!\n P.S. I'm fairly new to programming and Emacs, sorry if this was not properly oriented or if there is information missing.\n    submitted by    /u/NiceNeedleworker5604  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Recently, I got in to emacs org mode. I installed Doom emacs and I have been making my org file to suit my university schedule. It's kinda fun I wont lie.\n While I was experimenting recurring tasks, trying to understand the difference between +1w, .+1w, and ++1w (still have no idea btw), I might have pressed something or done something bc now whenever I look at my org agenda my TODO tasks show up twice. Anyone know how to fix this problem? I couldn't find any documentation on this issue...\n EDIT: I think this problem is caused by C-c [ .I made a TODO, it appears on the Org Agenda, when I do \"C-c [\" it appears to duplicate the TODO on the Org Agenda.\n 5 TODOs\n makes 10 TODOs\n    submitted by    /u/Caxu  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I'm about a month into my emacs adventures with a primary focus with using it for org documents. I am on MacOS and use doom emacs currently as my distro. \n When exporting with LaTeX pdf I get: \"zsh:1: command not found: pdflatex\" in my Org PDF LaTeX Output buffer. LaTeX is installed on my machine and the export works fine from terminal emacs (emacs -nw) so from what I've read this is likely a PATH issue. However, the whole setting a PATH so that emacs can see where LaTeX is is over my head with my current knowledge as I have little experience in terminal. \n Is anyone able to explain how to go about letting emacs see where LaTeX is installed? Or maybe insight into a solution if this isn't the issue?\n I know where pdflatex is by running \"which pdflatex\" in terminal but do not know next steps.\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/wooltoque  \n [link]   [comments]",

I understand they are different, but I'm not getting why the one is able to be displayed and the other is not.\n I've read every article I could find on this sub and google about Emojis in Emacs on Windows, but most articles are either 2+ year old, or have some broken links and succeeded to fix this issue.\n I'm running native Emacs on Windows, I'm not using WSL. I'm using Emacs 28.2.\n I have installed all-the-icons. I also have installed \"Noto Color Emoji\" and put this in my ~/.emacs:\n (set-fontset-font t 'symbol \"Noto Color Emoji\")\n And evaluated. I've also tried with \"native\" windows emoji font: Segoe UI Emoji, but same story.\n I'm getting the emoji in the buffer, but it's invisible. If I copy it from, say, emojipedia and CTRL + y in a buffer, the cursor moves as if something was inserted, but nothing is shown as if I inserted a SPC.\n However if I CTRL+a CTRL+k and then paste it in, say, my browser, I get all the emojis I've inserted in the buffer.\n My question is - Has the Windows API changed(that is the reason, allegedly, why it didn't work in the past as I've read about this issue on this sub) or is there some other way to display emojis in Emacs buffer on Windows 10 that bypasses this API problem or whichever other problem there is.\n On my Linux machine everything works fine, however, unfortunately, sometimes I'm forced to use Windows and thus want to make it work here as well.\n    submitted by    /u/aqua_cap  \n [link]   [comments]",

When I have a citation link in my org file, I click on it and it opens embark showing all the actions I can take. Since it is a new note, I click on citar-open-notes, which automatically extracts the title and author and populates it into my capture template:\n  (org-roam-capture-templates '((\"n\" \"literature note\" plain \"%?\" :target (file+head \"${slug}.org\" \"#+title: ${title}\\n#+filetags: :paper:\\n#+author: ${author}\\n#+created: %U\\n#+STARTUP: latexpreview\\n\") :unnarrowed t))) \n Now, my bibtex file contains information about the paper's year, and journal and I was hoping to extract it automatically just like it does with the ${title} and ${author}, but it does not appear to be the case. So I was wondering how this can be achieved such that citar automatically extracts the other pieces of info in the citation. I tried searching the citar-org-roam github, but I was not able to find something like this in the documentation. So currently, I am just using the following:\n (use-package citar-org-roam :straight t :after (citar org-roam) :config (citar-org-roam-mode) ) ;; You can also use citar-org-roam to plugin to org-roam-bibtex, like so: (citar-register-notes-source 'orb-citar-source (list :name \"Org-Roam Notes\" :category 'org-roam-node :items #'citar-org-roam--get-candidates :hasitems #'citar-org-roam-has-notes :open #'citar-org-roam-open-note :create #'orb-citar-edit-note :annotate #'citar-org-roam--annotate)) (setq citar-notes-source 'orb-citar-source) \n ​\n    submitted by    /u/waterstrider123  \n [link]   [comments]",

To support this, I’ve developed a customized terminal experience on kitty. Basically, if I open a new tab, it will clone my current environment, including the container/remote, current directory, and current bashrc. And it also color-codes tabs based on the type of environment I’m in. \n I’m curious if it would be possible/interesting/desirable to recreate this setup in emacs, with the ultimate goal of using emacs as a customized ide + terminal emulator. \n Does anyone have thoughts on this? The first issue that I see is that so far, I haven’t found a tab bar for emacs that supports customizing the colors of the tabs. I’m sure this is possible, but I’m too new to emacs to know how difficult it would be (I have experience coding in multiple lisp dialects, so needing to code in order to customize is not a drawback). Thanks.\n (EDIT: I guess this is partly a question about customizing emacs and partly a question about using emacs as my primary terminal emulator.)\n    submitted by    /u/mister_drgn  \n [link]   [comments]",

However, due to Lisp paranthesized syntax it is possible to simplify it. I have now re-written it so it just needs one marker to mark which expression is to be evaluated as Lisp:\n 1 + 2 = %%3 1 + 2 = %%(+ 1 2) 1 + 2 = %%!escaped \n Due to Emacs being a text processing toolkit and a Lisp repl/environment, that basically let us use Emacs Lisp as a template language in text files. The intended use is file and code generators.\n The simplified syntax turnes out to be slightly harder to process than the one with start and end delimiters, however I think it might be worth, so here is an experiment to test the idea.\n Download and details about the usage details are in online repo.\n I appreciate critique and discussion, especially if you find a bug or some fundamental problem.\n    submitted by    /u/arthurno1  \n [link]   [comments]",

So the question: is there a way to make them share the same inbox, without having to download the mail twice?. Maybe with a separate process that fetches the emails, so that Gnus does not get stuck doing network operations.\n Additional info: My mail provider is Proton Mail.

PlusCal most resembles an imperative programming language\n  \nThe mode offers syntax highlighting for most TLA+ / PlusCal Syntax, and basic imenu navigation. Code formatting is work in progress (TLA+ having significant indendation is in my point of view a significant challenge).\n Any feedback is welcome.\n The work is inspired by tla-mode, and this page  has been an invaluable help.\n PS. No idea how advent of code submission work here, so feel free to edit the title to use as as submission if it makes sense.\n    submitted by    /u/Davidbrcz  \n [link]   [comments]",

I've found a few options:\n  \nTrying to build with msys2 -- doesn't seem to like my msys2 configuration from Chocolatey. At the very least, it won't install and run make successfully.\n Tried out a precompiled pdf-tools -- this is about 5-6 years old at this date, and while there's libraries, and I added it to load-path and brought it in with require, it still was not particularly happy. It acted as if it'd never been properly installed.\n  \nJust curious. The baked in DocView is adequate for my needs as if I were to print it properly, I'd use a full PDF viewer like Sumatra. However DocView is pretty grainy in rendering and my eyes would appreciate it if I found a slightly better solution.\n I'm editing Typst documents with live PDF update, so it's nice to have another pane with the rendered document on the fly (mostly -- it's not the live update their website Rust app has, but it's close enough for me for now.)\n    submitted by    /u/remillard  \n [link]   [comments]",

I appreciate that web-mode is designed for mixed syntax files, if you're say working with templates for front-end web-dev, however I have found it provides far superior syntax highlighting than js2-mode. I haven't noticed any other difference between js2-mode and web-mode apart from this, I guess I've only scratched the surface. I primarily work with js and json files for node.js back-end development and only touch front-end, where I guess web-mode would be excellent a minority of the time. The error highlighting seems to be same for both, driven by lsp-mode. I haven't touched ESlint yet (been using ts-ls so far), only just installed it.\n I guess my questions boil down to:\n Why should I use 1 over the other especially given the syntax highlighting preference?\n How does flycheck / flymake play into this, what are the differences?\n Is it fine to run 2 language servers for lsp-mode / how does that work? Using lsp-describe-session shows both of them running?\n As a side-note does anyone have a config with lsp-ui and peek that they're willing share for some inspiration / things I've missed.\n I also have tern running is this required?\n Thank you in advance.\n ​\n    submitted by    /u/PracticalViking  \n [link]   [comments]",

So my question is, is there a way to configure eglot to say \"when invoking clangd, always pass -header-insertion=never? And if not, would that be a useful addition? (Maybe a filter function to process the results of eglot--guess-contact?)\n    submitted by    /u/simplex5d  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi r/emacs. I've been using Emacs for a few years now but please, treat me as a total beginner!\n Magit is one of the most incredible tools available but it is frustratingly slow on big git repos, especially when they're located on a slow file system. I very often find myself giving 2-3 commands in a row and only seeing the output in a few seconds.\n E.g. I'd type (1) f u to fetch all, then (2) r e to trigger rebase elsewhere and then start typing (3) /mast so the counsel wrapper can find origin/master and then I press Enter. I basically do all steps (1)-(3) and will only see any output >5s later.\n This definitely breaks the workflow and I would at least expect Emacs not to freeze between inputs (1), (2) and (3) and just give me clues that there's a process running in background.\n Is it something possible or should I try to use some optimisation tricks to do less on every magit operation?\n Thanks\n    submitted by    /u/tereshkd  \n [link]   [comments]",

You can find the analysis in my EmacsConf2023 presentation - https://emacsconf.org/2023/talks/gc/ and https://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10213384 (reproducible analysis).\n The key takeaways from the above analysis:\n For users:\n  \nEmacs freezes due to GC are real\n … but not for all users\n When GC does get Emacs slower, it is either \n slow startup ⇒ increase gc-cons-threshold to 20-80Mb check gc-elapsed after startup\n slow and frequent GC ⇒ increase gc-cons-percetage to 0.2-1.0 but watch Emacs RAM usage\n \n  \nFor Emacs devs:\n  \nGC problem is very real for many users (9% of GCs are both frequent and slow)\n It is worth bumping gc-cons-threshold temporarily during startup\n Ideally, we should switch from Mark&Sweep to something more performant\n May increase gc-cons-percetage, but need to get user data for optimal numbers\n  \nFurther plans:\n  \nWith the collected data we can hopefully continue emacs-devel discussion on changing GC defaults and get somewhere. https://yhetil.org/emacs-devel/20230310110747.4hytasakomvdyf7i@Ergus/\n \nemacs-gc-stats package has now served its purpose, but I think that it might still be useful for people who want to toy around GC settings. I plan to add some kind of \"session summary\" command that will display the key statistics of current user session. It should help understanding the effects of GC customization on the performance.\n \n    submitted by    /u/yantar92  \n [link]   [comments]",

If there is a way to indicate the status of the Caps Lock and Num Lock keys I'm yet to discover it.\n There are other similar types whose light patterns programmable, but on this one they appear to be permamently lit.\n It seems that the keyboard vendors charge a hefty premium for a \"gaming\" keyboard with a UK layout, and my view is that if I have to reprogram the keyboard whether UK or US then I might as well stick to the cheaper US one and reprogram it.\n I got this one for all of £7.99 in baby pink because I could use the color therapy and I love the tactile feedback. I'm not sure how it will last though because one of the keys came off easily.\n UK keyboards have a smaller Left-Shift key with the key for \\ and | next to it, before the Z, and on this keyboard \\ is activated by Alt-Shift - and | is activated by Alt-, below theESC` key.\n I want to use Alt-= for the | key to keep it closer. Currently pressing Alt-= produces nothing until it is pressed again after which it produces ¸, some kind of tiny right-angled character.\n I have read a few guides which are general and are targetted for Linux from bottom up, but I'd prefer something Emacsy if there is one, and if EXWM requires additional consideration.\n PS. I got another even smaller one in baby blue with 61 keys which I also need to program, but that may have to wait, and boy I never had a glimmer of what Emacs pinky could feel like until I tried to use the basic navigation keys which require the Function and Alt keys to activate them.\n    submitted by    /u/vfclists  \n [link]   [comments]",

Issue being that, when I'm trying to send mail with the configured mail, I get asked the SMTP server, even though I have configured it through smtpmail-multi.el.\n I'm using Emacs Doom with Emacs 29.1. And Gnus IMAPS is using the auth-sources configured (maos-keychain-generic) correctly. Reading the smtp Emacs documentation, it apparently can use .authinfo?, which I'm not using but, another way in auth-sources that works when fetching but someone not when sending. This authentication also works when using IRC circe.\n ​\n Here's my configuration:\n (add-to-list 'smtpmail-multi-accounts '(gmail . (\"mymail@yes.com\" \"smtp.gmail.com\" 587 \"mymail@yes.com\" starttls nil nil nil))) (add-to-list 'smtpmail-multi-accounts '(gmail .

Can't install use-package on my mac installation of emacs.\n I've been using neovim for awhile but have been increasingly frustrated with not being able to understand how things work when they break down. Hoping to learn emacs for fun and maybe to even replace/improve my nvim workflows.\n Things went well at first. I followed the tutorial and got used to some basic navigation as well as window and buffer navigation. I LOVE being able to `C-h` for functions, keys, and variables.\n I decided it was time to start trying to configure things and installing packages. I'm not patient enough to watch 10 hours of system crafters videos and didn't really want to buy Mastering Emacs, so I decided to do some googling…",

I don't have a link to the article, but even as a slightly seasoned Lisper I thought the fainter parenthesis improved readability. \n So I'm wondering if/how it's possible to achieve this effect in emacs.

          "description": "ultra-scroll-mac: scroll like lightning\n Emacs-mac is a beautiful port, and was the first to offer pixel-precise smooth scrolling nearly a decade ago. But with modern high-resolution trackpads and high density displays, I found its scrolling handlers just couldn't keep up. On large, full-screen buffers in a heavy mode, trackpad scrolling verged on painful, and, maddeningly, was much worse in one direction than the other. And no wonder: modern trackpads deliver scroll events >50⨉ per second! The other key problem with all known smooth scrolling packages is they tend to stutter and loop back as you try to scroll across images taller than the window.\n This package solves both of these problems:\n  \nScrolling performance has been increased 25-50⨉ — you move your fingers, the page responds, instantly.\n Large image handling has been worked around so you can scroll right across them without any hiccups.\n As a bonus, dumb mice get pretty good smooth(-ish) scrolling too.\n  \nI'll be contributing the core scrolling functions upstream, so hopefully pixel-precision-scroll-mode (which inspired this package, and is recommended on other builds) can make use of some of these improvements in the future.\n Finally, this was all (to me) surprisingly hard to achieve, which you can read all about if you are a glutton.\n    submitted by    /u/JDRiverRun  \n [link]   [comments]",

But, rather than do that, is there any other option for setting variables automatically for modes besides a hook like this?\n Also, as a bonus question, if I wanted to also do something like enable show-paren-mode for all prog-mode buffers, which of the following do you consider \"better\" (assume that this is not something that is likely to change frequently):\n ;; option 1 (defun my-prog-mode-settings () (setq-local backward-delete-char-untabify-method 'hungry)) (add-hook 'prog-mode-hook #'my-prog-mode-settings) (add-hook 'prog-mode-hook #'show-paren-mode) ;; option 2 (defun my-prog-mode-settings () (setq-local backward-delete-char-untabify-method 'hungry) (show-paren-mode)) (add-hook 'prog-mode-hook #'my-prog-mode-settings) \n Obviously, I realize that it's not really important, but I feel like bike-shedding this morning.\n    submitted by    /u/ragnese  \n [link]   [comments]",

MOCs and hub notes feel like a dream for my personal organization. higher-order learning seemed extremely necessary. disregarding the idea of separate disciplines in lieu of an understanding rooted in existing knowledge seemed very helpful.\nnow it's been a couple months and my zettelkasten contains over 100 zettels; i'd say about 20 regarding personal knowledge management and then about 80 medical notes. that is the problem, though. i look at other notemakers' obsidian graphs and they're one big ideaverse of notes radiating from the center. my notes, conversely, are separated into blobs by discipline or level of abstraction from reality. (e.g. anatomy [tangible] vs. study concepts [intangible]) in essence, i want to keep watching my zettelkasten grow--it is helping me retain information--but i'm a bit scared that i'm not implementing higher-order learning correctly.\nthis is making me unsure whether a traditional, luhmann-esque zettelkasten is the best idea for medical study. what do you think? does anyone else have trouble connecting tangible, business-related zettels to more abstract zettels?",

After working with the archive for 2 years and reading a bunch of times the Getting Started I can say this one ticks all of the boxes for me. Yes the downside is learning emacs, although maybe not A LOT of emacs and just what's necessary to feel comfortable with Denote. Also, it doesn't rely on org-mode so you don't need to also be familiar with how org mode works and just stay within emacs for your note taking needs.

That is:\nHow do you manage questions, which can be ongoing on life? (\"How to be a good man in the 21st Century?\")\nHow do you navigate and evolve forming practices? (Like: the Zettelkasten method, which you hone in through practice, and evolve insight: \"this works for me, I should pay attention to that\")\nHow do you walk back on ideas that do not serve you anymore, or that you realize were false? (like an early 20st Century scientist witnessing the ether being disproved, meaning all theories and constructs pertaining to it become completely irrelevant apart from scientific history)\nI guess the underlying issue is \"transient\" content, which is a little bit at odds with the concept of permanent / evergreen note / Zettel. Now I know a Zettelkasten is personal, that truth is unattainable and everything is potentially transient – please bear with me here 🙂 I also know, in Luhmann's words, that the Zettelkasten is a \"septic tank\".\nAnd yet. What would be best practices for capturing accruing, unformed ideas and questions, which would free the user by knowing they will not pollute the system down the road if they turn out to be dead ends?\nIs it a simple matter of trusting that linking will isolate irrelevant content? Or should you prune links later, remove notes – but potentially destroying the path of thinking that led you to where you are now? Is it a much simpler matter of redirecting the energy of the system simply by altering the geometry of structure notes?\nAny insight and especially technical approaches would be hugely appreciated.
