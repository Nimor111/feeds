          "description": "Lean 4 has a very cool feature that allows monadic do-blocks to contain imperative loops and mutable variables. This paper provides the motivation and theoretical underpinning.\n Since the concept is portable to any purely functional language supporting monad transformers, I thought it would be a fun experiment to implement it as a GHC plugin. The resulting plugin, donuts, allows for writing imperative style code such as this:\n guessPass :: IO Bool guessPass = do let Mut guesses = [] let Mut n = 1 :: Int whileL (n < 5) $ do putStrLn $ \"Enter guess #\" <> show n input <- getLine guesses := input : guesses when (input == \"secret123\") $ earlyReturn True n := n + 1 putStrLn $ \"All wrong: \" <> intercalate \", \" guesses pure False \n which the plugin desugars to monad transformer applications: ExceptT for control flow and StateT for mutable variables. Note that this works for any monadic do-block, not just IO.\n The imperativity is local in the sense that mutable variables are only mutable within the confines of the enclosing do-block's body statements as well as the bodies of loops occurring in that block. Similar restrictions apply for control flow commands such as earlyReturn, breakL, and continueL.\n    submitted by    /u/aaron-allen  \n [link]   [comments]",

Here is an example in JS:\n /**\n * Reduces a sequence of names to initials.\n * u/function makeInitials\n * u/param {String} authors A comma-delimited list of authors.\n * u/param {String} sep A period separating the initials.\n * u/param {String} trail A period ending the initials.\n * u/param {String} hyph A hyphen separating double-barrelled names.\n * u/return {String} Properly formatted initials.\n */\n function makeInitials(authors, sep = \".\", trail = \".\", hyph = \"-\") {\n const rDot = new RegExp(`[\\\\s${sep}]+`);\n return authors\n .replace(/\\\"(?:\\\\.|[^\\\"\\\\])*\\\"/g, \" \")\n .replaceAll('\"', \" \")\n .split(\",\")\n .filter((author) => author.replaceAll(sep, \"\").replaceAll(hyph, \"\").trim())\n .map(\n (author) =>\n author\n .split(hyph)\n .filter((barrel) => barrel.replaceAll(sep, \"\").trim())\n .map((barrel) =>\n barrel\n .split(rDot)\n .filter((name) => name)\n .map((name) => name[0])\n .join(sep)\n .toUpperCase(),\n )\n .join(hyph) + trail,\n )\n .join(\",\");\n }\n This kind of stuff looks pretty much the same in Dart, Kotlin, PHP, Rust, etc. Somehow I can't figure out how to structure it in Haskell. There must be a way to keep uniformity and readability in Haskell; autoformat should like it, too.\n PS I still can't figure out how to make code snippets readable.

          "description": "I've just switched over to ghcup and away from exclusively stack. I'm also trying to use Emacs' org-mode Babel, which is Jupyter notebook-style literate programming with more functionality than the Jupyter, IMHO. The going is not smooth getting the code blocks in the org-mode text to work, as they are run in a ghci session -- with all the restrictions such as multiple line versus single line to deal with. So when working with Haskell on org-mode, I first start a project with cabal init inside a directory, e.g., .../myproj. This will just be a skeleton, since I will throw my org-mode Babel files in this directory too. Next, I want to install Hackage packages, so I add them to the myproj.cabal build-depends section and do cabal run. Now, since org-mode's Babel is sending my Haskell code blocks to ghci, can that ghci session see and use the packages of myproj? If I do :show paths in the ghci buffer it reports .../myproj so no need to do a :cd <myprojdir> Very well. But my question is, does the ghci session see, can use my included packages from the project? As I understand, packages are installed per project (ergo per directory). But is there a global way with ghcup to install a package for all projects to use? For example, if I want QuickCheck globally and not have to include it per project, is this possible? Similarly, if I want to open a ghci REPL anywhere, how can I access packages?\n    submitted by    /u/teilchen010  \n [link]   [comments]",

Through the NASA tool Ogma [1] (also written in Haskell), Copilot also serves as a runtime monitoring backend for NASA's Core Flight System, Robot Operating System (ROS2), and FPrime (the software framework used in the Mars Helicopter) applications.\n This release drastically increases the test coverage of copilot-core.

It relies on the wonderful hs-opentelemetry project by Ian Duncan for all open telemetry functionality.\n  \ngithub\n hackage\n  \nThis is being used in production at my work and has provided useful insights around performance bottlenecks, exception context, and overall visibility into code execution.\n The plugin makes it so that you do not need to manually insert instrumentation code into function definitions, improving maintainability and reducing noise. By defining rules in a config file, you can specify which functions to instrument based on their return type or constraint context. This gives you control over whether you want the blanket approach of targeting your application's primary monad/constraint or a more conservative approach of defining a type that explicitly indicates that it will be instrumented.\n A MonadUnliftIO instance must be available for a function to be instrumentable. In particular, pure functions are not eligible.\n    submitted by    /u/aaron-allen  \n [link]   [comments]",

I can see why it works. But until yesterday I did not know that this method had a formal name - \"church encoding\".\n My question is\n  \nWhy does church encoding improve the performance of parser combinators? Surely it avoids the \"wrapping\"/\"unwrapping\" data into/out of constructors. So the abstraction and application of lambdas must be cheaper, right?\n And how much?

In this example I probably would need  determinant :: Matrix -> Float \n This often means I am rewrapping xss in Matrix just to pass it to determinant, which is cumbersome and I don't know if that would cause performance issue?\n Is there a way in the function pattern matching to get xss and an additional variable to bind the whole Matrix xss so I can pass it around? I believe in rust for example they have a way to do that by using @ like\n  match x { Constructor(inner) @ whole => .... } \n    submitted by    /u/bxsx0074  \n [link]   [comments]",

I've been searching for a new job for nearly 8 months, but I have been unemployed for almost 13. This job market has been absolutely brutal for me. My interviewing skills have gotten much stronger, but I haven't gotten any new tech screens for months. Just rejection after rejection. Needless to say, I'm branching out.\n F# is pretty much a no-go at this point. At any given time, it is entirely possible that there is not a single public job posting for an F# position. The positions that do pop up aren't often particularly good ones. Even so, I apply and get rejected without a tech screen.\n I'm currently examining Scala as an option, since many companies use it as a functional language. This would be very similar to my experience using C# as a functional language, and my direct FP experience in F#.\n I'd like to know what I would have to do to successfully make that transition to Scala. Specifically, what is the minimum that I'd have to learn about Scala to talk my way in? Or, is there a way I can sell myself such that I don't have to do any additional learning before I start a role as a Scala engineer?\n Thus far, I've gotten all rejections without tech screens for Scala positions just like everything else. But it's not clear to me that the companies using Scala recognize the connection between Scala and my current F#/C# experience. \n    submitted by    /u/TyphonExpanse  \n [link]   [comments]",

Specifically, I'm interested in how ADTs are employed to create context data types like Option, Either, and Future, and how type classes such as Functor, Monad, and Applicative define behaviors for these contexts.\n Here's a bit more context on what I've been pondering:\n Algebraic Data Types (ADTs):\n ADTs allow us to construct complex data types by combining simpler ones. For instance, Option represents values that may or may not exist, utilizing ADTs like Some and None. Similarly, Either embodies values that can be of one of two possible types, using Left for errors and Right for succ…",

          "description": "Hey folks, \n I've been working professionally in Scala for the last year and a half and it was nothing but unrest.\n First, the Scala 3 migration started this painful event that fragments the already fragmented multi versions hassle that everyone needs to go through 2.12 / 2.13, and now 3. Have to mention, this is not only dependent on our codebase. For example, Databricks is still on 2.12, on the other hand, some new libraries are Scala 3 only, or Scala 2 support was deprecated.\n Then Akka became a non-open source, and we had to find a solution and picked the Typelevel ecosystem.\n There was another \"shock\" to the ZIO ecosystem when their leader left the project. Fortunately for us, we haven't invested in ZIO not a single hour, but this is another negative event in Scala ecosystem.\n After working for half a year with Typelevel, we wrote some services and a few internal libraries. It wasn't bad, maybe not as simple as Akka, but it worked as expected. However, it was a huge struggle for half of the team to understand this code and for some to even understand the concept.\n Then Pekko came out and we had another meeting, where 100% of the team voted against using Typelevel again.\n So, we are \"officially\" using Pekko for all our new services, which is basically the old Akka in maintenance mode. I don't see how this stack has any future.\n Now, it looks like a few experimental libraries evolve around virtual threads. My bet this is the future of Scala since they are simple yet powerful as Effect systems.\n But I hear more and more people are saying - until these are ready, there will be \"no Scala\", since the language in a rapid decline (sad, but true).\n Sharing this because I'm tired of the constant unrest in Scala, and curious what strategy your team has regarding this.\n Thanks\n    submitted by    /u/Confident_Cupcake861  \n [link]   [comments]",

Basically, I was trying to lift the api version into the type system to clean up some code so that the focus of the code was on the business logic instead of determining what api version to use in a bunch of places / passing around a isV1 boolean everywhere. This does mean that the api version would need to be determined at runtime, and nothing I've tried has made it able to get the client implicitly. I thought with everything sealed and having implicit defs for both of V1/V2 that it would work, but I'm guessing type erasure / something with subtyping makes it indeterminable. I tried classtags and the aux pattern, but couldn't get it to work. This is scala 2.12 btw.

This is probably whey templates in org-roam behave very different than org templates.\n Last weekend I finally spent time and address some of these issues. The commits are here:\n https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam/compare/main...dmgerman:org-roam:main\n for example.The first template will only work when creating a new file (see :create-file). It will ask for the node-title and use it to create the file (the slug).\n  (add-to-list 'org-roam-capture-templates `(\"A\" \"area\" plain \"%?\" :target (file+head ,(eval (dmg-roam-build-path \"areas/${slug}.org\")) ,(eval (dmg-roam-template \"plain.txt\"))) :create-file yes :unnarrowed t)) \n If the path is provided, the user will not be asked for the destination. if the template has :create-file no, and the file does not exist, the capture will be aborted.\n In contrast, this template will ask for a node id, and then search for the \"Tasks\" header. node and node+olp will not create a new file.\n  (add-to-list 'org-roam-capture-templates `(\"t\" \"todo\" entry \"*** TODO %?\\n%t\\n%a\\n\\n%i\" :target (node+olp nil (\"Tasks\")) :unnarrowed t)) \n If the node id is provided, the user will NOT be asked for the node id.\n    submitted by    /u/dm_g  \n [link]   [comments]",

So \"Project X\" and \"Project Y\" instead of ProjectX and ProjectY. I read the org-global-properties description but I still haven't got enough hang of car and cdr and cons to know for sure what it's on about.

One small thing that concerns me is that it doesn't appear to be handled very well by emacs' lisp mode. So if I have it as a vertical list, I get this:\n (setq org-global-properties '( (\"MEETING_ALL\" . \"Staff Finance \\\"Project X\\\" \\\"Project Y\\\"\") (\"FLAVOR_ALL\" . \"Strawberry Chocolate Vanilla\") ;; ... and so on )) \n None of this is the end of the world, I know, but I just wanted to check in case I'm really supposed to code it as some kind of nested parens monstrosity, but one that's at least indented according to some sensible aesthetic!

          "description": "I've been trying to use eshell as my main shell and have encountered a situation I have no idea how to solve. I see two ways to use sudo in eshell. One is invoking sudo directly, which requires entering my password each time I use it. The other is using tramp; if I try to use it, then in order to terminate the ability to use sudo without a password, I need to terminate the created tramp sudo connection. I could probably solve it by closing such a connection automatically after a certain period, but I can't even find a function that lists all active tramp connections. I saw a discussion on the internet suggesting:\n (setq eshell-prefer-lisp-variables t)\n (setq password-cache t)\n (setq password-cache-expiry 10)\n But it doesn't do anything for my case.There's a command called 'tramp-cleanup-connection'. If I use it on a buffer where I opened a sudo connection, I see something like '/sudo:root@archlinux:', and choosing this connection to close doesn't do anything. Only using 'tramp-cleanup-all-connections' closes it, obviously.\n My apologies for any technical inaccuracies, i'm not even an emacs user (yet).\n    submitted by    /u/Electronic-Ferret-83  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I'm not talking about emacsserver here, something completely different. This may be a heretical idea, but I want to see where it goes. I have an idea for a note-taking program that's as nice-looking, performant and friendly as logseq or obsidian, but is fully backed by emacs and org-mode. I need features like tags, transclusion and backlinks, but also want all of Emacs: keyboard macros, eval'ed source blocks, LSP mode, etc. -- but over it all I want a smooth modern UI. I know some folks here will tell me how it's possible in emacs; believe me, I've looked into the options for some years now (org-roam, org-logseq, org-transclusion, org-roam-ui and more) and the ones I've seen are slow or fragile or never bore fruit, so just bear with me and see if we can explore this idea.\n What I'd like is to run emacs in a headless way and sync, in realtime, a set of buffers to a modern UI (maybe electron, who knows). Let's say we have a page in the UI, composed of a set of buffers (a buffer per block, maybe with sub-\"buffers\" transcluded into the UI), and the UI knows which emacs buffer corresponds to each block of text. My idea is the UI forwards keyboard & mouse events to emacs and receives buffer updates (including text props & overlays etc.), which it then displays in an integrated nice way. Could such a thing even be done? I don't want to scrape the emacs pixels -- I want to \"export\" the meaningful contents of the buffer for display over a socket protocol. Text, properties, overlays, images, etc. with their semantics. \n It seems like such a thing could be useful for other purposes as well, like using emacs to edit any text field in any app. Possibly even emacs could then run as an http service as the back end of a web app to run on Android or iOS. I'm sure I'm not the first to think of doing this; has anyone tried it before? What was learned?\n    submitted by    /u/simplex5d  \n [link]   [comments]",

I also use a custom user.js and UBlock Origin to enhance privacy and security. Pages load very fast. Minimal strain on cpu and enhanced battery life.\n Vimium: Far from perfect, as many standard emacs keybindings like M-> for (end-of-buffer), cannot be implemented. Setting ui.accelKey to 18, ui.key.chromeAccess to 0 and devtools.editor.keymap to \"emacs\" helped.\n GTK2/3: Setting gtk-theme-name = \"Emacs\" really helps and makes editing input fields feel great. Unfortunately this won't be supported anymore once firefox migrates from GTK3 to GTK4.\n  \nMaybe my standards are too high and I should just be happy with what I have.\n But so far I am not willing to give up on it, as my browsing experience is really the last puzzle piece missing to an otherwise perfect workflow.\n Alternative:\n Out of all the alternatives I like Nyxt by far the most.\n It truly supports emacs keybindings and I love the minibuffer. It is a joy to move around.\n If it only was possible to have extensions like UBlock Origin and maybe even swap out WebkitGTK in favor of Firefox's Gecko Engine, I'd make Nyxt my daily driver immediately and never look back. It would be a dream come true.\n I'd really appreciate if some of you guys with requirements similar to mine (vanilla keys, ad-blocking, security and privacy concerns) could share their workflow.\n Although a student on a very tight budget, I'll probably have to start donating regularly to Nyxt to keep my hopes alive.\n    submitted by    /u/schwinghmmr  \n [link]   [comments]",

I understand some of the possibilities and what it can do, but I'm struggling with even some basic tutorials and have some questions. I understand some conceptual things, like buffers/windows/frames, kill ring, etc., but I don't really know how to start integrating Emacs into my workflow. I come from VS Code and other IDEs like it.\n I began by skimming over this tutorial and these papers (1 and 2); however, when I try and use some of the macros they don't seem to work. For instance, if I try and use C-h r, Emacs reports \"C-h C-r is undefined\"; I don't get why this is the case, because I am holding down the CTRL key, then pressing h, then pressing r, then releasing CTRL, but it seems like Emacs is reading 2 separate presses of CTRL?. As well, I started watching this video to get the Emacs UI to look decent, but I'm not sure how I go about making a init.el file (like where do I save it, how do I access and edit the file, etc.). I know I can use C-x C-f to find a file, but it autofills c:/Program Files/Emacs; is this normal? I thought the init.el is in ~/<USERNAME>/AppData/Roaming/.emacs.d/init.el/? Do I have to type that in to go to the file?\n Thank you guys so much in advance; as well, are there any other resources that I should look at first as a beginner?\n    submitted by    /u/sebnanchaster  \n [link]   [comments]",

(Upcoming changes from Google will disable Manifest V2 extensions in Chrome by June 2024.)\n Text, Scroll, & Selection Sync: Provides real-time text, cursor, and selection synchronization between Emacs and the browser.\n Enhanced File Management and Auto Major Mode Detection: Offers improved handling for a smoother experience, supporting features like linting and auto-completion.\n Editable Area Navigation: Quickly switch between editable fields in complex web pages with hints.\n  \nCompatibility Note: These enhancements are in a fork, requiring an accompanying fork of the atomic-chrome.el package for full benefits. They still work with the original package for basic functionalities, though.\n Collaboration over Competition: I admire the original atomic-chrome.el project and intend this fork as a contribution, not a replacement. My goal is to merge these improvements back into the original to benefit everyone. I also admire the original atomic-chrome extension.\n Difference from Other Extensions:\n  \nVs. GhostEditor: While a fantastic tool for bidirectional editing, it lacks real-time cursor and selection sync and is still based on Manifest V2.\n Vs. Edit with Emacs: Applies changes but not in live mode and isn’t bidirectional. It also doesn’t cater to online editors, operating on Manifest V2.\n  \nI'm eager to hear feedback, suggestions, and welcome contributions.\n The link to the extension in the Chrome Web Store is here.\n    submitted by    /u/elgrekoo  \n [link]   [comments]",

Please feel free to roast my config and poke holes in it and suggest some improvements :)\n Currently I have 2 folders core/ (for emacs internal stuff) and modules/ (for packages) where core/core-init.el is sourced (required) from my init.el and it in turn sources the rest of core/ and all from modules/. Previously, what I have done for modules is that I've put the (elpaca-wait) command in each module, so that after each module is read elpaca processes the queue immediately and activates the package (at least that's what I thought it did from how I understood it before).\n Since then, I've come to learn that elpaca processes the packages queue after reading the init file, so that made me think that it's enough to call (elpaca-wait) only once at the end of my init.el after all the modules have been read -- which is what I did, however, now on startup I get warnings about bunch of packages that says:\n  \nef-themes loaded before Elpaca activation (analogously for the others) and all of those packages are inactive and some of my settings for the font, theme, orderless, consult etc. aren't respected.\n  \nBefore I go ahead and refactor and fix everything, is my understanding correct that it is enough to write all package configs and then call (elpaca-wait) once at the end of my init.el for it to process and load all my package configs? If not, when should I call (elpaca-wait)?\n What is \"the best\" (a good, optimal) way of making as much use of Elpaca's async powers as possible?

          "description": "Hey guys, I have jumped back to Emacs after using regular editors (for quite a while). I've been using avy and the likes to accelerate my navigations. And they are awesome! The one big problem I have with emacs is the scrolling. When it scrolls the whole screen changes, including the point, which loses all points of reference. I have tried using ways like scrolling only half a screen, smooth scrolling, or resorting to using my mouse (which sucks btw). In the end, I've settled down with good-scroll for full-screen scrolls, and repeated C-u C-n/C-u C-ps. And there's that.\n Except it isn't. Because now the problem becomes horizontal scrolling. For example, the code in the header image. If I were to, say, scroll down while reading the code, I don't really have a friendly way to scroll horizontally and back. Like, there's always this violent skip which makes me think \"oh where was I again?\" If I was using regular code editors like Kate, I can scroll horizontally using the mouse, and the scrolling will be smooth so I can conveniently track and read the code. But for hscroll, there's only C-e and M-m in emacs (at least to my knowledge). I guess there's M-f etc as well, but they move too slowly so it's not as efficient.\n So what I am looking for? Well something like C-l that places the point in the center, except this time it's horizontally centered as well. The other thing is during these horizontal scrolls and I move the point down, and the next line is not as long as the previous one, it skips back to the left and when the next line length is long enough, it skips back again. If there's something that can preserve horizontal point offset during these scrolls it'll be awesome. But not something like scroll-left because I have to manually scroll-right to get back.\n    submitted by    /u/42yeah  \n [link]   [comments]",

Unsurprisingly, I belong in the same boat: using (neo)vim for the past 5 years and have setup a window-manager setup with bindings all very akin to vim (heck I even have a firefox addon to emulate vim inside my browser for moving around).\n Now, I don't wish to learn emacs the vim-way and would like to learn it with default keybindings (makes it easier to follow docs, works well with other packages, etc.) but I'm afraid that'll make me \"unlearn\" the bindings I have in place that are more vim like. Heck, I'm scared I might unlearn vim itself.\n What I want to know is if it's possible to use emacs bindings inside emacs and my custom (vim) bindings outside it?

Hopefully you have some ideas!\n The tl;dr is that I'm keen to find a way to edit files on remote Windows hosts using ssh as the protocol from a Linux host.\n I'm a Linux user through-and-through but have to manage Windows boxen sometimes. Modern Windows can run sshd, though, and combined with powershell, managing remote Windows hosts is actually bearable. However, I'd prefer to edit files within my local emacs session rather than through a terminal running ssh. The challenge is finding the right C-x C-f path spec to connect to a remote ssh host that works when that target is running Windows (with all those caveats).\n Some considerations:\n  \nI know that I can connect to Windows hosts remotely via ssh correctly and passwordless. I can edit the login shell, I've tinkered with both cmd.exe and pwsh.exe without much success.\n I do have the ability to target sh.exe or bash.exe, although I haven't managed to make that work either (by changing TRAMP connection properties for the remote host)\n I assume there may be something I need to set to make the connection \"aware\" that the remote is Windows despite connecting over ssh, though I'm not sure what that setting might be (for example, changing a line ending setting)\n  \nI'd love any ideas or help with this.\n    submitted by    /u/leothrix  \n [link]   [comments]",

(defvar-keymap my/code-keymap \"d\" #'xref-find-definitions ) \n (defvar-keymap my/lsp-code-keymap \"d\" #'lsp-find-definition \"i\" #'lsp-find-implementation ) \n (defvar-keymap my/leader-keymap \".\" #'find-file \"/\" #'consult-ripgrep \"g\" #'magit \":\" #'consult-mode-command \"Q\" #'ave-buffers-kill-terminal\n \"f\" my/file-keymap \"p\" my/project-keymap \"w\" my/window-keymap \"b\" my/buffer-keymap \"r\" my/rings-and-regs-keymap \"e\" my/edit-keymap \"!\" my/error-keymap \"i\" my/insert-keymap \"t\" my/toggle-keymap \"c\" my/code-keymap ) \n (unbind-key \"SPC\" evil-motion-state-map) (bind-key \"SPC\" my/leader-keymap evil-motion-state-map)\n (add-hook 'lsp-mode-hook (lambda () (make-local-variable 'my/leader-keymap) (bind-key \"c\" my/lsp-code-keymap my/leader-keymap)) )\n ```\n Here I replace my-code-keymap with my-lsp-code-keymap if I am in an lsp-mode buffer. This nearly works, but making the keymap buffer-local doesn't seem to work. Thus once lsp-mode is turned on in any buffer, all buffers have their code keymap replaced. \n What I don't want to do:\n ``` (defvar-keymap my/not-wanted-lsp-code-keymap \"d\" (lambda () (if lsp-mode (call-interactively #'lsp-find-definition) (call-interactively #'lsp-find-definition)))\n \"i\" (lambda () (if lsp-mode (call-interactively #'lsp-find-definition) (message \"lsp is not available\"))) ) \n ```\n I want to avoid binding keys to some function that checks if lsp is bound and runs the appropriate command. This is because I don't want which-key showing the \"SPC c i\" option in non lsp buffers since it doesn't do anything because lsp is not available.\n Can keybindings even be buffer-local?\n I would appreciate examples of how this is handled in your config.\n    submitted by    /u/SaltyTranslator402  \n [link]   [comments]",

Well, this time I'm at least not too lazy to ask:\n Is there a way to make Emacs buffer ordering be per-window and remembered separately for each window?\n The way I work is using eyebrowse to create \"screens\" or \"workspaces\" (I used escreen before eyebrowse, a long time ago). Each of these is usually further separated into windows. That means that certain buffers naturally end up \"belonging\" in certain workspaces. For example, my Clojure REPL always lives in screen 4.\n This setup is great, but the way buffer switching works doesn't play nice with it. If I jump from screen 1 to screen 4 and back to 1, my previous buffer will be my REPL, which is not what I want. Screen 1, and more specifically, the window in that screen that I'm working in, should remember which buffers were used in it recently, so that I can use previous-buffer/next-buffer predictably.\n I think I would expect all other buffers (ones not visited in that window) to be appended at the end, as I don't want to limit myself. I might want to switch to some of those some day.\n Does something like this exist? Is it possible at all?\n    submitted by    /u/jwr  \n [link]   [comments]",

I've tried variations of the above, like call-interactively, without success. I think I am missing something very obvious (emacs lisp novice here).\n Why do I want to do this? Because I want to use company-complete for arbitrary macros in latex as if they were \\ref.

This is not very surprising of course, and if you are building your own completion tables for use with completing-read-multiple, the problem can be avoided by keeping the value of crm-separator in mind. The problem is that sometimes the completion table is generated on the basis of input the user may have no control over. \n For example, in mu4e there's a function mu4e-view-save-attachments which does what the name suggests: it lists all attachments in a given message for the user to choose (possibly more than one) and then saves the selected attachments in a specific directory. If you are dealing with a message with files whose names contain a comma, selecting one of those files will lead to trouble. \n Now, I can just define a little function that will temporarily change the value of crm-separator to handle these cases, e.g.: \n (defun my/toggle-crm-separator () (interactive) (let ((original-separator \"[ \\t]*,[ \\t]*\")) (if (string= crm-separator original-separator) (let ((separator (completing-read \"Select one of the following options\" '(\";\" \",,\" \"-\")))) (setq crm-separator (replace-regexp-in-string \",\" separator crm-separator))) (setq crm-separator original-separator)))) \n Still, I wonder if there's a smarter solution out there. Off the cuff, I can imagine scanning the completion candidates to ensure none of them contain an instance of the value of crm-separator and, if they do, at least alerting the user of the need to pick a different value for crm-separator? But I don't know if there's a better way to handle this situation. \n Thoughts?\n    submitted by    /u/graduale  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Greetings everyone,\n I wanted to share a function that I've found incredibly useful while conducting qualitative data analysis of interviews. During this type of research, structuring my interview data and maintaining a clear overview is crucial. To assist with this, I've developed a function in Emacs Lisp that uses tags to extract specific headlines into a new buffer.\n This function, extract-headlines-by-tag, prompts the user to enter a tag. The function then scans the entire buffer, and for each headline that contains the specified tag, it extracts not only the headline but also its content. These extracted parts are then transferred into a new buffer. I've made the new buffer pop up for immediate review after the extraction process.\n Here's the piece of code:\n (defun extract-headlines-by-tag (tag) \"Extract headlines and their content from current buffer by TAG.\" (interactive \"sEnter tag: \") (save-excursion (let ((result-buffer (generate-new-buffer (concat \"/Extracted Headlines \" tag \"*\")))) (with-current-buffer result-buffer (org-mode) (insert \"* Extracted Headlines by Tag: \" tag \" *\\n\\n\")) (org-element-map (org-element-parse-buffer) 'headline (lambda (headline) (when (member tag (org-element-property :tags headline)) (with-current-buffer result-buffer (insert (org-element-interpret-data headline) \"\\n\"))))) (pop-to-buffer result-buffer)))) \n This has greatly improved the way I manage and analyze my qualitative interview data. Sharing it here in case it's of use to anyone else in similar situations.\n    submitted by    /u/525G7bKV  \n [link]   [comments]",

Instead of using a library which creates an intermediary JSON representation which is then converted to Lisp objects, my solution creates Lisps objects from the JSON stream without any intermediary steps.\n Measured by ~1 MB of clang LSP messages, it works ~8x faster than the current emacs JSON parser. Maybe it can be helpful for people whose LSP works slowly, as an alternative solution to emacs-lsp-booster (I didn't do any comparisons).\n You can check out the faster-json-parsing branch here: https://github.com/geza-herman/emacs/tree/faster-json-parsing. Is it based on master, but I think it can be easily applied to any recent version of Emacs (it's just one commit).\n This JSON parser misses some error handling, like for example it doesn't check for utf-8 encoding errors. So please consider it as a proof of concept, not as a production quality thing.

          "description": "I created an emacs extension named org-linker that allows users to link a file in org-mode (the attachment is identified as a UUID), offering a secure and flexible method for referring to other files in org-mode. Try it out!\n Comparison with org-attach\n org-linker differs from org-attach in its approach to file attachment. \n org-attach uses an org heading as a basic storing unit, which can lead to issues if not managed carefully (e.g. refiling or adding shadowing subtrees). \n On the other hand, org-linker assigns a unique UUID to each attached file, ensuring a more robust linkage system. By treating individual files as the fundamental unit, org-linker provides a safer and more flexible approach to handling attachments in org-mode documents. For example, this allows easy movement and copying of links across various org files and headings.\n Both tools have their strengths and are suitable for different use cases. However, if you prioritize a secure and straightforward attachment system, org-linker might be the preferred choice.\n Example\n For instance, if the root is /tmp/org-linker/, and the UUID for the transaction is 20240101-235959, and the file is readme.md, the file will be copied to /tmp/org-linker/20240101-235959/readme.md with the transaction recorded in /tmp/org-linker/db.tx. And an org-link [[linker:20240101-235959/readme.md]] is inserted at point.\n You can customize the uuid generator. In particular, you don't have to use timestamp.\n You can also remove the uuid easily by fuzzy searching with M-x org-linker/trash-folder-uuid, or just remove the uuid at point with M-x org-linker/trash-folder-at-point. The trashing function is customizable too.\n Contributions\n Feel free to contribute by submitting pull requests, raising issues, or sharing your ideas!\n    submitted by    /u/jin-cg  \n [link]   [comments]",

The stock transient that comes with Emacs 29.2 has the version 0.4.3.\n When magit 3.3.0 is installed, either from nongnu archive or directly from its tar file, it will pull down the latest 0.5.3 from the elpa archive.\n Is there a way to let magit not install transient 0.5.3 but use the built-in 0.4.3, which should satisfy the dependency requirement ?\n Edit: another package, transient-dwim, shows the same issue by pulling the latest transient even though this 2022-year package specifies transient 0.1 as its dependency.\n Solution:\n A temporary workaround until the bug reported by u/nv-elisp is fixed. Put this in init.el:\n (add-to-list 'package--builtin-versions '(transient 0 4 3)) \n Hope this is helpful and many thanks to all the people who chimed in!\n    submitted by    /u/ixlxixl  \n [link]   [comments]",

During my studies I started with atom and finally moved to VsCode, using vi/vim/nano/fish/tmux for server managing and quick file modifications.\n I imagine that moving all my dev working routine from VsCode to Emacs is going to be... Hard, specially for the first days but this is the way my future working routine is going to be so... I am really excited and affraid to.

          "description": "Okay, I've finally gotten around to setting up emacs-lsp-booster, and my first impression is: it works. And it works really well. I already liked LSP-Mode in general, but it was too slow for my very large Unreal project. I'd get constant timeouts, suggestions and completions just outright wouldn't work, and it was a very disappointing experience.\n I switched to LSP-Bridge because it promised better performance, and that was 100% true. It did completions where LSP-Mode and Eglot would choke, but it was a bit of a hassle to set up. I'm on a Windows machine and that always makes things a little more complicated for me. I had to make sure to write a project-root-finding-function or it wouldn't understand my project setup (devs: not everyone uses git, stop assuming that we do), etc.\n Ultimately, I'm switching back to LSP-Mode because it integrates with xref and helm and various other things a lot better. The LSP-Bridge built-in completion is adequate, but it worked in ways that I wasn't expecting/didn't like (the lsp-bridge-find-references function, for example, would split the buffer, and when I quit it, sometimes it would kill the buffer I'd been visiting as well. User error? A bug? Don't know.) You just end up having more flexibility with lsp-mode.\n What I can tell you is that no matter how you slice it, for a project of moderate to large size, you should be using something like lsp-bridge or emacs-lsp-booster. (For reference, based on my compile-commands.json file, there are about 17000 files in my project.)\n Also, it seems that the root of this problem is emacs' ability (or lack thereof) to parse JSON efficiently. That really should be looked at; emacs-lsp-booster is a project that shouldn't have to exist, but I'm grateful that it does.\n    submitted by    /u/vjgoh  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi, I have a feature in mind that I can't find, but am also struggling to articulate, so I'm still not sure if it exists or not!\n I'm thinking of something like literate programming, but without tangling, as the source code lives in files separately from the text. Instead of source blocks containing code in the literate document, the literate document instead specifies \"views\" into the source files. The views would be specified by a file name and a line number range, and that range of lines would be visible in the literate buffer as if that was where the text lived, but it actually lives in its own source file.\n So on-disk this \"view src block\" might look like this:\n ```\n +begin_view :file src/main.rs :lines 120-124\n +end_view\n ```\n Whereas in the emacs buffer it might look like this:\n ```\n +begin_view :file src/main.rs :lines 120-124\n let rectangle = Rectangle { length: 3.0, height: 4.0 }; let triangle = Triangle { length: 3.0, height: 4.0 }; print_debug(&rectangle); println!(\"Area: {}\", area(&rectangle));\n +end_view\n ```\n Editing text within this view would be propagated back to the source file, and adding a newline at the end of the view would increment the end of the line range.\n The motivations for this would be avoiding problems with eglot/lsp in an org document for example, or a document explaining some bits of code in detail, without committing to the full literate workflow.\n Does this have a name and does anyone know of any implementations of something similar to this?

Below I summarize my explorations, which I hope will be of help to someone else here doing elisp hacking.\n I have a large Org file (> 1MB) with more than 200 'transaction' tables that all have a fifth column with the header 'Notes'.

          "description": "Hi, everyone. I wanted to post a quick tip to help other noobs like myself. I love org-capture, but I sometimes want to make a completely new file out of quick note, rather than append it to an existing org-mode file. I searched and only found outdated or kind of hard-to-understand answers. So here is a quick snippet to put into your init.el and capture templates to enable creating a new file. \n (defun jj/open-new-project-file () (let ((fpath (read-file-name \"File name: \" \"~/Sync/inbox/\" nil nil nil))) \n As prescribed in the org docs, this creates a new function that will prompt you for a file name to create, starting in the directory you specify in the function. Then, in your org-capture templates add:\n (\"i\" \"New note in Inbox\" plain (function jj/open-new-project-file) \"#+title: %?\") \n This will use your function to create the file and set your cursor ready to type the title in your new org file.\n ​\n I hope this helps someone. I know most people would probably just append to an inbox.org file or similar. I was doing the same thing, but after reading Building a Second Brain, I'm trying to separate the notes into files that can be dragged-and-dropped via Treemacs into the PARA setup I've made. It's a little simpler than trying to use org-refile because in the PARA method, your directories are constantly changing and moving.\n ​\n This solution was heavily inspired by this post: https://www.jesseevers.com/org-capture-function/\n I just modified it to fit my own use case and thought someone searching on Google in the future might appreciate it.

My English is not perfect and I have problems understanding what to do to fix the grammar mistakes. Example:\n  \nThe noun phrase first element seems to be missing a determiner before it. Consider adding an article.\n  \nI don't understand what this hint suggests. The browser extension has a suggestion that you can click to fix the grammar mistakes. Does any Emacs mode have something similar? I thought that lsp mode use company mode to allow fixing grammar mistakes from dropdown menu, but I was told that the company mode only works with completion and doesn't work with lsp-grammarly.\n I can fix mistakes by hand, but I need to have a list of fixes to apply. lsp-grammarly had even more cryptic hints \"Correct article usage\". Those are only in browser extension but there is a proper grammar listed that I can apply.\n    submitted by    /u/jcubic  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have only my init.el file open and moving up and down makes new buffers appear in that list. This isn't consistent though. If i restart emacs, i can move through my init file just fine. And at some point, this just starts happening.\n Some of those buffers are empty, and some have just \"Lisp Expression:\" with nothing else written in them.\n I already tried stripping down my config and haven't been able to track it down. I ripped the whole completion setup out, threw out treemacs and such, ran without all the eglot and language modes and tried without org and evil configuration. Nothing seems to help.\n Is there a hook or option i can use to get more information on how or by what those buffers are created? Maybe write a verbose log on those events or such?

I'm just looking to see if anyone can help me make it so that backups are saved/taken care of silently in the background, and when hitting `C-x s`, it doesn't prompt me to save the backup file each time. Instead, it prompts for normal (non-backup) buffers.\n I don't know *why* it continually updates the backup files if I have a [/] in the header, but it does.

Currently, the way I start the daemon is with systemd. I enable and start the service as the documentation shows.\n The issue has to do with where the daemon creates the socket. Sometimes when I boot up my machine, everything works exactly as I expect it to: I can simply run `emacsclient -nc` and it pops right up. I can also set my shell environment variable EDITOR to emacsclient and open files easily that way. When things are working right, I note that the socket is in /run/user/userID/emacs/server.\n Probably half the time I boot up, the socket is in ~/.emacs.d/server/server, which means I have to pass the path to the socket to emacsclient for it to work. This means I have to change the scripts bound to my keybindings, etc., every time this happens. Pain in the butt. And for some reason I don't understand, setting EDITOR=emacsclient -cn -s /path/to/server doesn't work the way I want it to. It opens up a new frame, but does not open a buffer with the current file.\n So my questions more broadly are\n  \nHow does Emacs determine where it creates the socket? You would think it just looks at server-socket-dir, but there's obviously more to it than that, because it changes it up on me regardless of whether I explicitly set that variable.\n And does anybody have any hunches as to what could be causing it to seemingly randomly flip back and forth between socket locations?\n  \n   submitted by    /u/Exact_Willingness_25  \n [link]   [comments]",

These notes are spread over a lot of directories on my system and in different formats (.txt, .md, .doc). Migration to org-roam will make navigating through all of my notes much more comfortable and I already migrated most of my notes.\n The last notes I want to migrate have a \"directory context\". For instance holiday notes in my pictures directory. I am considering to copy/paste these files to org-roam and add a tag to the directory and delete the old note. The downside is that this is kinda an org-roam lock in, because migrating these notes back could be a PITA. If I use a special tag in the roam-note to the original directory then it is possible to migrate the files back with a simple elisp script I guess but could break when directories are renamed in the future. Hopefully I am making myself clear .\n Just before sending this to Reddit a light bulb went off. I could copy/paste the original note in the org-roam note in a code block and tangle it to this directory.

I'm thinking about installing Emacs (org-mode is the main selling point) and switching (at least from NeoVim) to Emacs/Doom Emacs. While I was reading about how to install it, I found that there are a couple of different emacs releases that can be installed: \n  \nIf I search Homebrew for the \"Emacs\" term, there is one cask called \"emacs\", let's call it \"standard\".\n But there is also \"emacs-plus\" which should be first tapped: https://github.com/d12frosted/homebrew-emacs-plus?tab=readme-ov-file\n  \nI have a couple of questions: \n  \nI'm wondering what is the \"correct\" way to install emacs on MacBook Pro M1 with Sonoma - standard or plus release.\n If emacs-plus is the correct way should I include those additional flags like \"--with-native-comp\" and if yes which ones?\n If emacs-plus is the correct way, what is better to use \"emacs-plus@29\" or just use the latest version? I guess that if I just use the latest version, then it will be updated whenever I run brew update and upgrade, and I'm not sure how things are going in emacs world with those updates. I used to have problems with NeoVim updates, as well as plugin updates, so at one point in time, I was afraid to run plugin updates :) Hope Emacs is more stable.\n  \nThanks in advance.\n    submitted by    /u/milnik79  \n [link]   [comments]",

And i want that box to use a color from my current theme. But i don't want to hard code the color value, but for it to use the dark or light color of the modus theme, depending on which is loaded on starting.\n So far i have tried using the function modus-themes-get-color-value but it doesn't seem to be available at the point the tab-line gets activated. Then i tried this at the very end of my init.el:\n (custom-set-faces '(tab-line ((t (:box (:line-width (5 . 5) :color ,(face-background 'tab-line)))))) ) \n Which seems to be run before the theme is loaded, as i'm getting a white box on the modus-vivendi theme.\n I tried setting this up in a use-package statement for the tab-line-mode, for the modus theme and for the emacs pseudo package. I tried adding :after (modus-themes) to the use-package statement for the tab-line. All without success. I don't even want it to track the theme when i change it after starting emacs. Just, get the background of the tab-line at start, after the modus-theme is loaded and use that for the box color.\n I feel like i'm somehow overthinking this. How can i get the tab-line border to look right regardless of the configured theme? Is this a case of having to set up a variable for your theme and then making this into a cond statement with hardcoded Color Values? This should work for now, but would mean i'd have to rewrite the any time i want to change themes.\n Just for completeness, here's the entire config, if anyone want's to take a look:\n https://gitlab.com/domsch1988/domacs\n    submitted by    /u/domsch1988  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm somewhat confused that this is not a more common problem, as I'm not sure how else I should be using org-agenda\n What I tried so far\n  \ndo not keep org-agenda-files open after generating agenda I don't understand that quiet though, I don't want a solution that closes buffers when I close the agenda buffer\n Prevent recentf from being flooded - Reddit I neither want to ignore all my org files though\n  \n   submitted by    /u/hertelukas  \n [link]   [comments]",

Well the first step is now done, we now have a way to make any elisp command callable by an LLM that does function calling. For example, here is me switching buffers by telling the LLM to switch buffers by just describing the buffer I want switched to. It's not exactly a huge time-saver, but it's cool and shows the potential.\n ​\n https://i.redd.it/fy6jnbp2w1kc1.gif\n In my llm package, I've created a new function calling branch after learning that Ollama will soon support function calling. Right now both Open AI and Gemini do this (but Gemini has some limitations). As part of that, I have a utility to use function calling to create function definitions for elisp functions (which aren't really rich enough in information to be passed to function calls as-is).\n I'll be thinking about interesting new interactions that can be built off by having the LLM just control emacs via a few predefined commands. But it's quite useful for certain things where you want the LLM to produce structured information. For example, I created a function that will create an example sentence given a word in a language, and then it can be passed to anki, etc. These things were a bit painful to do previously.\n As normal, I'm not planning on creating an actual end-user package here, but I want to encourage people to think about what can be done using function calling and, if there is something you want to put into a package, use the `llm` package to make it easy and portable (somewhat).

However I have been wondering if Emacs is on its way down.\n I guess it all started with the birth of NeoVim about a decade back. The project quickly grew and added features which made it better of an IDE than stock Vim (I think). Now i know Vim is not designed to be an IDE, but many NeoVim users seem to want that functionality. Today neovim has plugins t not only code and autocomplete, but also debug code in most languages. i lbelieve it has been steadily attracting users of stock Vim (and of course Emacs)\n Then enter, VSCode about 6 years ago. I guess this project attracted a lot of users from aother text editors (including Emacs). Today it has an extension for everything. Being backed by microsoft means its always going to be better.\n Now whenever I try to look up solutions for Emacs issues on the web, most posts i see are at least 10 years old. For example, I googled for turning Emacs into a web dev IDE. A lot of reddit and Stackoverflow posts that the search turned up were more than a decade old.\n I am wondering if Emacs is on a steady decline . The fact that it is not available by default on many systems seems to be an additional nail in its grave. Even on this sub, a lot of Emacs lovers who used to post regularly, like redguardfoo and Xah are no longer active\n This makes me sad. I absolutely hate having to install a browser disguised as a text editor (VS Code) which will be obsolete probably by another 5 years. I hope that Emacs stays around. Its infinite extensibility is what i love the most (and of course elisp) \n Would like to hear your thoughts\n    submitted by    /u/redditisinmyheart  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "🙏 Please toss an upvote on this issue—it needs 20 upvotes in 90 days to be merged. https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/204942\n Sometimes I use VS Code for work, to understand a plugin, and just to explore.\n Window splitting in VS Code drives me nuts. Window management is too closely tied up with tabs. You end up with an hierarchy of \"Editor Groups\" and \"Editors\" instead of being able to recall any buffer wherever you want. Then Quick Open (buffer switcher) opens a file multiple times—one per Editor Group. Using VS Code's `revealIfOpen` option partially addresses this, but reveals in the previous Editor Group—it can't recall the file into the Editor Group your cursor is currently in like in Emacs.\n We added `revealIfOpenInActiveGroup` to fix this. This allows you to make VS Code work just like Emacs buffers. Here are the docs for the Get Started page in VS Code docs:\n ### Simulating Buffers\n If you're coming from buffer-centric editors such as Emacs or vi, you can emulate that workflow with:\n \"workbench.editor.showTabs\": \"single\",\n \"workbench.editor.revealIfOpen\": true,\n \"workbench.editor.revealIfOpenInActiveGroup\": true,\n \"workbench.editor.closeEmptyGroups\": false,\n VS Code has a model where Editors live hierarchically within Editor Groups, and to split your screen you must use Editor Groups. Using `revealIfOpen` with `revealIfOpenInActiveGroup` causes Quick Open to move already-open Editors into the active Editor Group. This allows you to emulate buffer-centric environments—no tabs, split your screen, and you can view any Editor within any Editor Group without opening a file multiple times.\n PR (with video!): https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/pull/205442\n Issue: https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/204942\n Docs PR: https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docs/pull/7043\n    submitted by    /u/aguynamedben  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello!\nYesterday, I experienced a situation that I'm surprised I didn't notice before.\nWhen we use object tags, we seek to identify the objects interacting in a note's main argument. However, there are times when those objects may refer to qualities one may or may not have.\nFor example, let's imagine I have two different notes where I explain the following ideas:\n(1) Being too strict causes problems\nIn note (1), we could identify the object tag #strict. While in note (2), we could identify #relaxed as an object tag. However, the important point is that this decision is arbitrary. I could perfectly well have written the notes as follows:\n(1a) Being too strict causes problems\nor\n(1b) Being not enough relaxed causes problems\nIn notes (1a) and (2a), I would have identified #strict. In notes (1b) and (2b), I would have identified #relaxed. However, all notes talk about the same object idea: there is a right amount of strictness/relaxation that avoids problems.\nSo, my question is the following:\nHow would you handle this situation?\nDo I accept this arbitrariness and continue using both object tags?\nOr, do I try to find a way to avoid this arbitrariness?\n\nThe example I showed is a simplification of a text I am processing about Semantic Versioning: https://semver.org/\nThe paragraph that provoked this situation was the following:\n\n  \nIf the dependency specifications are too tight, you are in danger of version lock (the inability to upgrade a package without having to release new versions of every dependent package). If dependencies are specified too loosely, you will inevitably be bitten by version promiscuity (assuming compatibility with more future versions than is reasonable)\n\n\nUsing too tight or too loosely dependency specifications casues problems :-)",

Specifically, in the video above, it seems that elaborative encoding might not be as effective without the schema being represented well to the learner first when they are a novice.\nIt seems that a lot of the ideas around ZKM or just Zettelkasten more generally are heavily founded upon deep processing or elaborative encoding from a more constructivist flavor.\nI was wondering if there was more of a need for worked examples as one develops knowledge within their ZK and even as one works on getting better at the method itself (ZKM).\nWould love to hear if any others have thoughts on this.\nNote: I know that Math is focused on this video. But, it seems to me that zettling is a practice/skill. And, even a lot of what we develop within the ZK should be able to used in some skill. So, worked examples seems relevant.

          "description": "The most important thing the GPT for Zettel Critique does for me is point out areas where my note (thinking) is weak (has gaps) and offer suggestions like a patient and watchful tutor. This alone is a fine-tuned game-changer. If the GPT had a persona, it would be a smart, but not snarky, it would be patient, but not hold back, it would act with my best interests in mind. The GPT doesn't have a persona. It is a huge algorithm of 'linked knowledge,' and the benefit comes from its ability to pull out appropriate threads and apply them to the case at hand.\nMy role in this shindig is to be honest when reviewing the critique. I dream of \"What Would Richard Feynman Do?\" Maybe I should get this tattooed on my wrist. W.W.R.F.D. This would be a great slogan to go along with zettelkasting.  Try to be responsible and not give up independence to the machine. That doesn't mean that the GPT is wrong in its critique, it means the it should be viewed like any tutorial, describing best practices while leaving open the opportunities to think in ways that support your individual style and goals.",

However, after an eureka moment all constraints seem harmonious.\nIn his book A Thousand Brains Hawkins look for a uniform algorithm implemented by cortical columns, the neural unit of neocortex.\nMechanism\nBrain constantly tries to predict its inputs. When there is a mismatch between predictions and an input, the system immediately notices. Our model of the world being inaccurate deserves evolutionary attention.\nThe model we construct is not separate from our body. Neocortex, not being a simple I/O circuit stores data in reference frames  Meaning, we encode the location of a cup relative to our hand for instance.\nThe reasoning goes for abstract knowledge too. There are no \"is\" statements in the world.\nI'm trying to go through a paradigm-shift in my understanding of Zettling, from \"PKM\" to keeping a ZK. Here is a simple structure note I created to dive deep into a topic, short because I haven't split it into parts yet to work deeply. But I don't know how to proceed. Any help is much appreciated.",
