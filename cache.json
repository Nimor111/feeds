I think a lot of haskellers just use them without giving it much thought.\n But my question: what other languages offer such features? I know OCaml has its ppx mechanism that lets you do this (viz: ppx_deriving with more information on such things at the Ocaml metaprogramming page). I can't actually think of other languages that do it in quite this way.\n Of course a lot of very dynamic languages (in the SmallTalk family) let you do this. So I'm mainly interested in 1) typed languages (sorry Racket, doing 'TypedRacket' with macros is very cool, but quite different; a 'deriving' mechanism *for* TypedRacket would be in scope, if it exists) and 2) where this is done in a wholly separate phase, i.e. not at run-time.\n    submitted by    /u/carette  \n [link]   [comments]",

In scheme later changes can however still affect the closures env:\n (define n 2) (define foo (lambda (a) (define m 10) (+ a n (- m 3)))) ;; everything after here doesnt belong to the lambda env currently (define n 10) (write (foo 4)) ;; should use n = 10, but still uses n = 2 \n I know other people have used the IORef to solve this with actual mutability, but I wanted to know if there is another way of still using the state monad, before having to rewrite my entire program.\n The lambda environment should also affect the actual environment if it mutates an outer variable using set!.\n    submitted by    /u/GeroSchorsch  \n [link]   [comments]",

In the assembly generation stage, an abstract syntax tree is converted into a List of x64 instructions.\n To model a C language expression as an AST node, I used this algebraic type:\n data Expression = Value Int | Unary Uop Expression | Binary Bop Expression Expression\n The Expression type is used to represented nested unary and binary expressions such as -2, -(~2), 1+3, (6 *2) + (5* (9 -2)), etc... Uop and Bop are unary and binary operators, respectively.\n Parsing these expressions recursively looks like a classic fold operation, and I implemented my own folding function that works. But I can't help but feel there's a better approach to this, a better abstraction to traverse a recursive data structure and \"flatten\" it into a List.\n Obviously I can't use Foldable since the datatype is not kind `* -> *`. Would it make sense to use a phantom type so that Expression is of kind `* -> *`?\n Any thoughts or suggestions would be helpful. Thanks\n    submitted by    /u/JadeXY  \n [link]   [comments]",

And it also seems like the conduit code suggests you just compose things with await and yield, instead of using more standard combinators like fmap, mapM and fold (although their are Conduit specific versions of things like fmap and fold which one can use).\n I feel like the conduit interface is a bit more clunky and not as \"Haskell like\".

Have a journeyman level understanding of other languages, have worked in SW for three years and counting.\n I have been making my way through the haskell MOOC (the university of Helsinki one). I stumbled on these two books which, by the accounts I have read previously, seem to go into more depth mathematically with respect to haskell. In the mean time tryng build up on C++, and learning small bits of CL here and there as well to get more perspective and be a better problem solver overrall.\n So, what I'm asking:\n From my understanding, Hutton (Programming in Haskell) is drier than Bird (Thinking Functionally With Haskell), though both are solid texts with a good backing in math (i.e. strong on the \"equational reasoning\" front EDIT: category theory is welcome too), and wanted to see if there was a consensus on either of them, or at least consolidate people's different opinions and experience between the two, especially from people who have read both. There hasn't the been most testimony comparing and contrasting the two as I've seen scouring this subreddit.\n I ask because I would rather not approach FP just as a programmer but in addition and moreso as a computer scientist instead (in the way SICP aims to teach CS book and is not simply a Scheme tutorial).\n Other books that have come on my radar (for this purpose) are: The Haskell Book (aka Haskell from First Principles) and Introduction to Computation: Haskell, Logic and Automata.\n That's about all, cheers!\n    submitted by    /u/Glittering-Escape-74  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "We are working on a project and need to both create SVGs and read our created SVGs (or also user supplied SVGs, but we can specify which SVG elemtns are allowed).\n When reading svgs we need to know which shapes are contained in the svgs (only circles and rectangles are relevant for us). If there are shapes using the svg <rect>, <circle>/<ellipse> in the file this would certainly make life easier for reading the svg.\n Mainly based on another post https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/tlvopj/looking_for_svg_library_recommendations/ I've found the following libraries that supports both reading and writing:\n  \nsvg-tree: Features both reading and writing. But reading and writing seems to not be super easy but I was able to accomplish both things as a POC. Also the documentation is almost non existent. For an easier to use writing interface I imagine that we could also use lucid-svg.\n \ndiagrams with diagrams-svg and diagrams-input: Features both reading and writing. The writing api is amazing and really well documented! And I was able to read an svg file created by the library into a Diagrams type. But I was not able to find a way how I can find out what shapes are contained in this Diagram (what circles and rectangles are there in the file?). It doesn't seem to be easily possible, as it just saves Paths in the types and also in the file? But maybe I'm wrong. Unfortunately combining the writing API of diagrams and using the svg-tree library to parse them also doesn't seem to be easily possible, as again, only paths are saved in the file.\n \n Does someone know whether this is possible using diagrams? Or does someone have any suggestions on a different library we could use to read or write an svg? (e.g. a better writing interface that will work together with svg-tree)\n Any help is greatly appreciated! Thanks in advance!\n    submitted by    /u/monaceleste_  \n [link]   [comments]",

I've cobbled a few attempts together like these:\n -- #2 main = \\a -> putStrLn $ \"You chose: '\" ++ a ++ \"'.\" =<< parse -- or this messy attempt: -- #3 main = \\a -> parse >>= putStrLn $ \"You chose: '\" ++ (a :: AdventureOptions) ++ \"'.\" \n But I keep running into errors like \"Couldn't match expected type ‘[Char]’ with actual type ‘AdventureOptions’\" (with regards to a) or worse. I get what the error is saying; what I can't figure out is how to solve it inline.\n The working greet example (#1) has the function declaration of greet :: AdventureOptions -> IO () so I gather that that is how the compiler is inferring things there. How does one indicate that type in an inline fashion?\n Is \"casting\" a to AdventureOptions a possibility in some way? I know I've seen documentation regarding in-line type syntax, but can't find a solid example that is applicable here.

My first instinct would be to write a function to perform a double fmap with a given function and value, but that just sounds wrong\n how are you supposed to structure your code to prevent something like this?

          "description": "I've run into a tricky issue while trying to migrate to Scala 3. The main problem stems from a bug in Scala 2 Quill macros that affects schemaMeta. When you try to annotate schemaMeta with a type, it doesn't return the correct type for batch actions. If you let IntelliJ infer the type, it ends up generating a massive, unreadable type with a ton of compile-time IDs, rather than a simple SchemaMeta[YourType]. This causes problems, especially for Quill batch operations.\n Here’s what happens when using the Scala 3 migration flag \"-quickfix:cat=scala3-migration\":\n implicit val daoSchemaMeta: YourPostgresContext.SchemaMeta[YourType]{ def entity: io.getquill.Quoted[io.getquill.EntityQuery[YourType]] { def quoted: io.getquill.ast.Entity def ast: io.getquill.ast.Entity def id1796633896(): Unit val liftings: Object }} = schemaMeta[YourType](\"your_table\") implicit val daoInsertMeta: YourPostgresContext.InsertMeta[YourType] { def expand: io.getquill.Quoted[(io.getquill.EntityQuery[YourType], YourType) => io.getquill.Insert[YourType]] { def quoted: io.getquill.ast.Function def ast: io.getquill.ast.Function def id694044529(): Unit val liftings: Object }} = schemaMeta[YourType](_.id) \n Instead of just getting the expected SchemaMeta[YourType], you get this crazy output with compile-time IDs, which doesn't work with Quill batch actions. There's a related bug report here: https://github.com/zio/zio-quill/issues/1308.\n The kicker? Scala 3 requires explicit type annotations for all implicits, and we can’t bypass this even in \"migration mode.\" So, we’re stuck in a Catch-22: Quill macros don't play well with type inference in Scala 2, but Scala 3 forces us to annotate everything, leaving us blocked by Quill.\n This essentially pushes us to go all-in on Scala 3 and Protoquill, which means a major rewrite. Has anyone else hit this roadblock? Any advice?\n EDIT Resolved: Seems like slapping @nowarn on every implicit schema allows to supress this error\n    submitted by    /u/juwking  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "What do you think about open source software bounties? I keep seeing them, for instance SoftwareMill offering them in the ScalaTimes letter today, or com-lihaoyi a while ago, or John DeGoes in his new Golem venture.\n They seem to offer developers a chance to contribute to open source code, hone their coding skills, get experience, and they might also be getting paid for that work.\n I considered contributing to one of com-lihaoyi bounties, specifically, implementing support for ms sql. However, I noticed someone else got the torch. And that gets to my point. You have N developers working on the same thing. Sure it works to the advantage of the entity that issued the bounties. But 1 out of the N developers will be successful. What if a developer starts working on it, then drops the ball because it turns out it is too much work and she/he doesn't have enough time? As a matter of fact, com-lihaoyi increased the bounty for ms sql support because there is more work than it was originally anticipated (see the pull request here: https://github.com/com-lihaoyi/scalasql/pull/29 ). Right now, I am not sure where that work is at.\n I feel that these bounties might drag (some) developers in a rat race. You might argue that a monetary retribution is better than nothing, and in the end nobody forces you to do anything if you don't want to, and I agree 🤷‍♂️ . Maybe I am missing something about how the oss bounties work.\n I think the ideal process would be to hire a developer to commit and to do the work in a time frame agreed upon by both parties, and to pay her/him properly. But I understand that might not be always feasible due to lack of funds and time, hence the bounties. I would be interesting to see the real-life experience of a someone that issued bounties and how that turned out.\n    submitted by    /u/0110001001101100  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hey r/scala! If you're looking to get hands-on with some cutting-edge tech, check out Ergo. This isn’t a shill for just another blockchain, but an open-source platform packed with advanced scripting and cryptographic tools.\n You can experiment on the testnet or even fork your own chain to explore its potential. \n Ergo is built on Scala, and its scripting language, ErgoScript (which is also based on Scala), goes beyond Bitcoin’s scripting by using ErgoTree byte code. This allows for complex coin spending conditions, enabling things like ring signatures, multi-signatures, multiple currencies, atomic swaps, self-replicating scripts, and long-term computations. ErgoTree itself is a typed abstract syntax tree, essentially a smart signature that validates transactions based on custom rules. With Secret Data Predicates (digital signatures, secret keys) and Blockchain Context Predicates (transaction-specific conditions), ErgoTree supports a range of applications beyond crypto, such as (decentralised) CBDCs, new monetary systems, Local Exchange Trading Systems, and pretty much anything else you can think up, can be done on ergo!\n Many of Ergo’s solutions are grounded in formal research and have been presented at peer-reviewed conferences. While ErgoScript isn’t Turing complete on its own, Turing completeness can be achieved through transaction trees, as outlined in this peer-reviewed paper.\n For those looking to earn while they learn, there are various bounties up for grabs, with rewards in stablecoins like SigUSD and Gluon Gold. Check out open bounties on the reference client and interpreter/compiler, or join the upcoming ErgoHack.\n An (incomplete) list of all repositories that use scala can be accessed here\n    submitted by    /u/ergo_team  \n [link]   [comments]",

It sounds great to be honest.\n But…\n Is it too much? Is it too much effort to set up/learn?

For instance I could have assigned a tag about a topic to every annotation, or a rating of importance from 1 to 10, and so I could have the need to retrieve the title of the chapters and paragraphs of a book, or the chapters, paraghraphs and notes, or and here becomes interesting all the notes that have a specific rating with a sparse tree (chapters, paragraphs) and notes with importance > 5 or even more interesting across the books with a specific tag as for instance statistics all the notes with a rating >9\n IMPLEMENTATION\n I do not know what is the most convenient way, really I have not idea, but i confine that there are other avid readers that develop org mode that thought about a convenient workflow\n * annotating pdf of digital documents so that can see on the side the original pdf and another side the notes and assinging multiple tags and running researches across the org files\n * using org roam to make a kind of wiki using a lot of links,or a lot of org files in subfolders and run a research with a kind of specialized engine to retrieve what I need\n * see if can use SQL in org files so that for instance the headers of one level would be assigned to a table/column, and the nested ones will be automatically assigned with an id beloging to the table or something similar that will simplify to transform the org mode to SQL\n * org table files\n * Some SQL tables in Postgree sql via a star model or model vault key that will be queried in some way inside org mode\n CONCLUSION\n All I want is to capitalize the books i read in a way I can extract information, confront sources, highlights, adding notes etc\n    submitted by    /u/ivano_GiovSiciliano  \n [link]   [comments]",

I think I remember reading somewhere it was officially recommended to switch the file extension to .txt and not use the unique .org extension as they are functionally the same. Both are plain text formats, you might just have different txt files, that are not formatted in orgdown there too. Is that all or have I missed something? Is there an actual downside like a dependency of org-roam that you end up in dependency hell if you decide to use txt or another file extension instead of .org. Bc otherwise everytime you don't have an org parser around and are on a system like a tablet, it will straight up refuse to open the file, locking you out of your data complete. This can be avoided by using orgdown formatting, but utilizing the .txt extension. \n Cheers and thanks for your insights \n    submitted by    /u/Gold-Solution7258  \n [link]   [comments]",

I needed to come up with a more efficient system, so after thinking about it for a while I came to the realization that the only new information in my notes would be of the following type:\n  \nExplaining a certain step of a derivation in more detail. (by adding more steps)\n Adding additional information that was relevant. (an alternate explanation or my own explanation)\n Connecting the given information with some other piece of information. (like how you link stuff in Obsidian)\n  \nThat's how I came to the realization that if I could have like the comment feature that you usually have in word, but with more obsidian features for pdfs then that would be a game changer. For example, being able to upload a textbook to obsidian, then highlight a word/sentence or para (or the space in the between them) and then be able to write comments on it (both in Latex and normal text) or to be able to link that with other notes.\n I would be extremely grateful if somebody could let me know if there is a way to implement these features.\n Thnx!\n    submitted by    /u/Mental-Repair-6141  \n [link]   [comments]",

I keep my files on a shared google drive, I've also connected it to org-mobile on my phone and generally it works ok, I'm quite happy with it.\n However, I recently read a book about building a second brain and decided to tidy up the system a bit. While writing or linking notes is not a problem, I probably don't understand the idea of ​​tags/properties or I have something set up wrong with the search. No matter how I set tags in my notes, I can't search for them. It looks a bit like the search only works in a few files that I have in my org-agenda-files(and even then not always) and nowhere else.\n I want to be able to search for topics, e.g. by tags in my entire \"second brain\" without adding them all to my agenda. I'm just afraid that soon I'll have dozens (hundreds?) of files and emacs will take half an hour to start. What's the best way to do it?\n P.S.

Person A. And so on, where person name is a tag. But, tags go to the * ie List of tasks. So that would not work. The other way is write as above and search with C-c s name. Wondering if this is the only way or is there some other mechanism or a smarter way to do it.\n Pointing to the appropriate documentation would be enough. Thanks for your time.\n    submitted by    /u/AmbitiousEffort2365  \n [link]   [comments]",

In your init.el, please replace\n (with-eval-after-load 'org-transclusion (add-to-list 'org-transclusion-extensions 'hyperdrive-org-transclusion) (require 'hyperdrive-org-transclusion)) \n with\n (with-eval-after-load 'org-transclusion (hyperdrive-org-transclusion-mode +1)) \n Please see the hyperdrive info manual for installation and setup instructions. hyperdrive-org-transclusion augments the org-transclusion package by Noboru Ota by allowing you to transclude hyperdrive content over a network. You can also transclude specific Org document headings by linking to them.\n This package is similar in nature to org-transclusion-http, which also lets you transclude content over the network (HTTP, not hyper).\n Feedback welcome!

However, I can't actually use the feature since it just gives me a \"not authenticated / not authorized\" error when I try to do any copilot operation (such as copilot-diagnose).\n I'm wondering if there's a way I can just use my MS account that my employer provides. I'm able to use copilot from the gizmo that is in my taskbar and on my browser, but I don't see anywhere to change the authorization mechanism in copilot.el.\n I've dug into the copilot.el files a little, but I'm not really an elisp hacker and I can't make hide nor hair of how they work - the authorization routine doesn't have any reference to github or any other urls, just variables that don't seem to be set anywhere.\n Ideas?\n    submitted by    /u/steve_b  \n [link]   [comments]",

The reason I brought up even docker tramp is the website says that someone can do the same things with podman for these emacs version.\n I know there is a docker package in emacs that allows it to manage docker containers witihin emacs. But I don't need that level of control for podman. What do I need, as the title says, is to access the podman containers. To clarify futher, what I want to do is: say when I am working on a project and I want to evaluate a snippet of code using C-c C-c inside a org src code block, I don't want emacs to use my system's environment but the environment of the specific container I would like to use.\n If it were a whole file, eg, I would simply enter the podman container using eshell/vterm and evaluate the document, but, when I am writing in prog-mode instead of org-mode, the formatters and linters for that program would work if they are installed in the main system. But how do I use podman containters stuff? I mean there is good document, I think, for docker but not so much for podman.\n I tried researching on this but I could not find any example code since I don't know lisp to write my own. But I really could use someone's help in writing one. Maybe, since docker and tramp are related, going through tramp manual I might find some help. But has anyone here tried setting up emacs the way I want and used podman? And would it be easy to set up like that?\n EDIT: Sorry for not just paragraphing it properly. But the post did not even make any sense. My dyslexia kicked in and made such brutal mistakes. Appreciate the patience, and hope the post makes sense now.\n EDIT: Just to further clarify, emacs is not installed inside the container but installed in the system.\n    submitted by    /u/whatever4123  \n [link]   [comments]",

Clicking the 'M' and U(Mac)... changes the file ending standard to utf-8-unix and saves the file but then Tramp immediately changes the convention back to the wrong file ending conventions. This sets me up for another WTF debugging session. I've tried setting the file conventions with a local buffer variable but that doesn't help as the file immediately reverts to Mac line endings after each save. I have two questions:\n Q: First, I'm just looking for a work around here. Can I put something into my: \n `# -*- mode: shellscript; ... -*-` \n mode line that will force my desired file ending convention? Emacs and Tramp seem to be convinced that in this environment is should be utf-8-hfs-mac when I want utf-8-unix. I'm looking for a file-local temporary fix here but google seems to be convinced that I'm better off chasing the setting of these variable each time I have a problem like this and I do actually use TRAMP to edit files on foreign filesystems irregularly. So, most of the time TRAMP gets this right, it's just that this time, TRAMP is getting it wrong which is adding 3 items to my debugging stack making a simple problem hard to debug.\n Q: Second, I've searched for about 1.5 hours along the subjects of \"emacs line endings\", \"emacs normal mode\", \"emacs mode-line\" and none of them have answered my question. What subject should I be searching for to fix this?\n    submitted by    /u/cshilton  \n [link]   [comments]",

Will be working on some el code to prototype what we're discussing here, and will share back. Appreciate your time.\n \n Hi community. I've used Emacs for over 30 years. I've recently started using it again for python and react development. While I love some of what Emacs has to offer, it's continued to be a frustrating and problematic ramp. It's hard to get it where I need it as a professional developer.\n Even after all these years, I still feel Emacs has so much untapped potential, but there's problems holding it back.\n Rather than just walk away, I decided to write up and share my ideas. I want to give back to Emacs by collaborating on a solution that gets it used and driving real value for more people.\n The document shares ideas on how to help developers quickly get productive with Emacs on the tasks that matter to them. I deeply believe we can increase the number of developers who try Emacs, get value quickly enough to use it more, and promote its virtues to friends.\n https://github.com/gregfelice/emacs-dx/tree/main\n if you want to help build and launch this, hit me up on https://discord.com/invite/9F4DSE25r7\n    submitted by    /u/grokgov1969  \n [link]   [comments]",

I must say my config file is totally based in other config file I followed from System Crafter videos. I'm so happy and want to get more and more from Emacs. I use Intelij IDEA to develop on a Java project with Cuba framework, and I would like to use emacs instead. Mostly I only need autocompletion, Fast Class switching, Go to definition and so on...and launch gradle tasks like build, deploy. The things is I don't have idea how. I followed the config from the video \"From Vanilla Emacs to Java\" but I don't get autocompletion at all. Thanks \n    submitted by    /u/DevGiuDev  \n [link]   [comments]",

All this changed rapidly at this new company.\n Now, my team leader left the company and got replaced with another one who has never had a managerial position before and is trying to micromanage me, which I resent with a passion, not just because of my character (who if I am being honest, responds well to criticism under conditions) but also because I feel he is not quite on par with my own skill level (perceived or not). I mean, I would ideally like to have a superior who I admire (perceived or not) and can learn from, and then I would embrace and indeed welcome both the manager and the criticism.\n Anyway, Now how does this relates to Emacs?\n Well, this guy at work cannot understand the way I program. It seems extremely alien to him because I find myself using common Elisp and functional idioms.\n I have started naming thinks like (buffer-or-name) or what have you.\n The use of monoids, etc etc.\n So, Emacs has forever made me an alien to the standard workplace culture.\n I mean this guy wants me to take my nicely single purpose functions and put them\n all within a Class in one huge file.\n I do not know if I can take it.\n How is this funny?\n I do not know, I find it funny that a 50 year old program is causing such trouble for a person 50 years after its inception.\n Thank you for your time.\n With <3 pnoul\n    submitted by    /u/pnoulis  \n [link]   [comments]",

I had an idea for a package, but it's the sort of thing that feels like it must already exist, and I'd love to look at existing packages before reinventing the wheel. \n The basic idea would be that you could schedule code to run using org agenda entries with timestamps. For example, you could write an entry like \n * Update the package cache :exec: :PROPERTIES: :TaskName: update-package-cache :END: <2024-10-14 Mon 14:00-16:00 +1w> \n Then you'd define a search like +exec and associate functions to various task names. The package would provide a function/mode to set up timers to watch the agenda and run scheduled tasks when emacs is idle within the scheduled window. Maybe if the entry is a TODO, update the timestamp with org-mark-done.\n But yeah, this feels like the sort of thing that would already exist in some form. I've seen a few packages to notify about tasks, but not to act on them more generally. If anyone has any leads/thoughts, I'd appreciate it.

          "description": "Reading the thread of remaking emacs in a modern environment, apart from the C-core fixes and improvements, as always there were a lot of comments about elisp.\n There are a lot of people that criticize elisp. Ones do because they don't like or directly hate the lisp family, they hate the parentheses, believe that it's \"unreadable\", etc.; others do because they think it would be better if we had common lisp or scheme instead of elisp, a more general lisp instead of a \"specialized lisp\" (?).\n Just so you understand a bit better my point of view: I like programming, but I haven't been to university yet, so I probably don't understand a chunk of the most theoric part of programming languages. When I program (and I'm not fiddling with my config), I mainly do so In low level, imperative programming languages (Mostly C, but I've been studying cpp and java) and python.\n That said, what makes elisp a great language for emacs (for those who it is)?\n  \nIs it because of it being a functional language? Why? Then, do you feel other functional languages could accomplish the same? Why/why no?\n \nIs it because of it being a \"meta-programming language\"? (whatever that means exactly) why? Then, do you feel other metaprogramming languages could accomplish the same? Why/why no?\n \nIs it because of it being reflective? Why? Then do you feel other reflective languages could accomplish the same? Why/why no?\n \nIs it because of it being a lisp? Why?

If I turn it off, the problem goes away.\n This also only affects my Moonlander, a QMK keyboard. I tried using a standard keyboard and it was fine.\n I checked wevand the only difference is that the Moonlander registers the g input immediately (1 ms) after Ctrl, whereas the standard keyboard registered it around 100ms after.\n Is there a reason why keyboard-quit would not work if the interval between Ctrl and g is too short indisplay-line-numbers-mode? Is it because a keystroke will trigger some sort of background process or refresh - and that's the process I'm quitting with C-g if I do it too quickly?\n Thanks in advance if anyone has any ideas.\n    submitted by    /u/barnaclesaretasty  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "After receiving some great feedback from the Neovim community on a comparison I made between Emacs and Neovim, and later also a bunch of encouragement words talking about this idea on both r/neovim and r/emacs, I've been inspired to create something new*:\n Emacs-Kick — a lightweight, beginner-friendly Emacs configuration inspired by kickstart.nvim\n  \nGithub: https://github.com/LionyxML/emacs-kick\n  \nhttps://preview.redd.it/kg1oei01artd1.png?width=1239&format=png&auto=webp&s=1ad6022340c96739e2bb79a24dcb1979a4657a60\n What Makes Emacs-Kick Special?\n While there are many Emacs kickstarter configs out there, Emacs-Kick is focused on providing a simple and accessible setup for Neovim users who are curious about Emacs, without asking them to fully dive into the Emacs way of doing things.\n Key Features:\n  \nTerminal-first: No need for a GUI. Works seamlessly with tmux, zellij, lazygit, starship, and other terminal tools.\n Vim bindings by default: For a smooth transition from Neovim.\n Pre-configured Treesitter and LSP: Get up and running quickly with modern code features.\n Simple defaults inspired by kickstart.nvim: Familiar setup to help ease the learning curve.\n  \nThe goal of Emacs-Kick is not to replace Neovim but to act as a secondary tool that you can experiment with. Whether you're interested in trying out Emacs' unique features or just want to see what all the fuss is about, Emacs-Kick makes it easy to explore without being overwhelmed by complex setups like Doom or Spacemacs.\n I’m excited to share it with the community—feel free to try it out and reach out with any feedback or questions on GitHub. Let’s build something great together!\n    submitted by    /u/LionyxML  \n [link]   [comments]",

I desired to squash the commits and rebase my feature onto the current tip of master to stay updated.\n Here's what I did:\n  \nI switched to master, and made sure to pull the local branch to the tip.\n \nI switched to my working branch, and made sure the origin was pushed and up to date with the current commit level, and stashed the current modified files.\n I performed a rebase onto branch with r b and selected the local master branch.\n I rewrote the commit for the first commit of the series and squashed the rest.\n…",

So, I’ll dired my way to a path and try to create a new file right there, and instead jump over to an existing buffer elsewhere and totally not have created the new file I want.\n Anybody got suggestions on how I can force create a new file buffer right where I just navigated to with dired ,even if the buffer name matches some other buffer?\n My lame workaround is to create a weird name like xyzzyzzyzy.svelte , write or paste some code in it, save, c-x d to the dired, hit r to reload the directory list, and then rename the file to what I actually want.

          "description": "Recently someone asked about filling (aka wrapping) text within columns. It's a useful feature, so I added it to the simple package speedrect, which implements a little modal interface that comes alive during rectangle-selection mode.\n Just highlight a rectangular region of text (C-M-mouse-1 works great, or C-x SPACE then move), and hit f to wrap. The wrap width defaults to the rectangle's width (e.g. to expand an existing wrapped block). Otherwise, use a numeric prefix (e.g. M-20 f) or regular prefix (C-u f) to prompt for the width. The selected rectangle's height sets the height of the safe fill region (usually extending down to the next distinct \"row\" of data). If the newly filled text exceeds this height, additional lines are added below.\n speedrect has lots of other useful features for moving rectangles around, operating on them, and sending them back and forth to calc. To use it, just select a rectangle...\n    submitted by    /u/JDRiverRun  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "What is Aider\n Aider is an AI pair programming tool in the terminal. It allows you to pair program with large language models (LLMs) to edit code in your local Git repository. You can start a new project or work with an existing Git repo. Aider works best with GPT-4 or Claude 3.5 Sonnet and can connect to almost any LLM. The GitHub page for Aider is GitHub - Aider-AI/aider: aider is AI pair programming in your terminal, and the project currently has nearly 20k stars.\n Aider has performed well in solving real coding problems on SWE-bench.\n Introducing Aider.el\n Recently, the Cursor editor has been gaining popularity. As a long-time Emacs user, I don't want to switch to Cursor just because of AI. Currently, Aider only has plugins for Vim and VSCode, but Emacs has a tradition of integrating command-line tools. So I decided to write my own, as a humble attempt: GitHub - tninja/aider.el: aider emacs plugin forhttps://github.com/paul-gauthier/aider.\n This plugin offers the following advantages over using Aider directly from the command line:\n  \nPop-up menu: No need to remember commands. (aider-transient-menu)\n Git repository-specific Aider sessions in Emacs: It automatically identifies the Git repository of the current file and creates a new Aider session for it. Multiple Aider sessions can exist for different Git repositories, allowing you to work on several repositories simultaneously without interference.\n Region-based refactor support: You can select a region (e.g., a code block) in a file and ask Aider to refactor it.\n  \nIn fact, most of this plugin itself was generated using Aider / aider.el.\n If you're interested in AI-assisted programming and, like me, prefer not to leave the Emacs environment, perhaps you could give Aider and aider.el a try. I would appreciate any feedback or suggestions you have about aider.el. Thank you!\n    submitted by    /u/Sad_Construction_773  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Let me paint a picture for you all: I do some technical writing using org-mode (mostly papers on computer science), but I must confess I got a terrible spelling, both in my mother tongue and English, so spell checking is a must to everything I do. \n I used to use flyspell + enchant, but it would cause severe lag (I tend to write hole documents in one file), so I have changed to jinx, and it's amazing in terms of performance. One thing I think I could upgrade in my workflow, is that the suggestions are too far off the real word I mean, even thought the error is somewhat minor, most of the words I don't even know existed! \n On the other hand, I also have ltex installed, and its suggestions are 99% of the time on point, but it comes at the cost of only updating when I save the buffer and being somewhat slow. So to do a final pass is great, but to spell check while writing is impossible.\n One other thing I have seen in the past but never got my head around doing was using dabbrev to fix recurring mistakes, but I don't think this would solve the problem. Another (crazy) idea is to use some small LLM to better predict the word based on context, but if LanguageTool can do it without it (I think), is there any other way?\n So, anyone have tackled those difficulties?

While this works, I found it to accidentally trigger esc frequently when I try to do movement or C-g in Emacs, which is annoying.\n I’m wondering if there is a better solution.

The main focus is to offer a simple, Neovim-user friendly setup for those who are curious about Emacs, without asking them to fully transition or embrace the entire \"Emacs way\" of doing things.\n Some key features:\n  \nNo need for GUI, making it tmux, zellij, lazygit, starship, and terminal tool friendly\n Vim bindings as default\n Treesitter and LSP pre-configured\n Simple defaults based on kickstart.nvim for familiarity\n  \nThe idea is for Emacs to act as a secondary tool, not as a replacement for Neovim, so users can experiment and explore Emacs without feeling overwhelmed by setups like Doom or Spacemacs.\n The project is almost ready, and I’d love to get feedback from the Emacs community. This could also be a helpful entry point for Neovim users who want to dip their toes into Emacs without too much complexity.\n If anyone would be interested in testing it or offering feedback, I’d love to hear your thoughts!\n Wish me luck over at r/neovim 😊\n A preview: \n https://preview.redd.it/jhhn5wfhqssd1.png?width=1239&format=png&auto=webp&s=4a47ec15ecad880bad5e381cb40732b2cc90c42f\n    submitted by    /u/LionyxML  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Doing academic research, I often have cases where I want to reference, for example, a specific chapter from a book (like collective works, or collected essays from one author). I create these as individual items in my library (exported as bibtex by Zotero/better bibtex but I don't think that is important). I would like to be able to keep the notes for these chapters connected to the source book, but I can't figure out how to get citar-open-notes to recognise this. Calling citar-open-notes for a new library item creates a new org file with the appropirate metadata (including roam-refs) and the citekey as the filename; this is fine default behaviour, but I'd like it to first check if the citekey already exists as a roam_refs property in another file before creating a new one.\n Can I get it to do this somehow?

But every attempt, over decades, from pen and paper to Obsidian to Notion, has ended in a mess that becomes unusable. Once the system gets bloated, I start over with the best intentions, trying to keep things simple. I've lost countless hours in this cycle and hope to figure out where I'm going wrong before I start again.\nI have thousands of ideas, thoughts, journal entries, research, etc.\nI have various ways to jot things down quickly, but if I don't categorize them, I know I’ll never look at them again, especially long journal entries. I used to record notes, which are automatically transcribed, but now I have hundreds or even thousands of transcriptions that are effectively meaningless. I don’t know what I’ll do with them, so they just pile up, collecting, not connecting.\nIf I try to organize them, that creates friction, and after a valiant effort, things get out of hand. There are too many notes and too many ways to link them, and many are just the same idea phrased differently.\nEven with proper linkages, at some point, 200 notes on a topic become clutter, and there’s no way to distill it when I need it.\nSometimes I feel like all this effort to manually do what my brain cannot is futile. If I’m writing something and want to reference a topic, I get overwhelmed by too much information.\nShould I stop trying, or is there a method that can help someone like me?\nI was excited about AI in Obsidian or Notion, but the results were inaccurate or incomplete (e.g., “show me all my notes on a topic” or “how many notes do I have?” give partial results). Maybe I didn’t set it up correctly, but figuring it out was too overwhelming.\nBest,\nR",

I’ve developed an Ansible playbook that automates the setup of Raspberry Pis, including tools that could enhance your note-taking and text-processing environments.\nWhat’s Included:\nNetwork Configuration: Easily set up Wi-Fi networks, access points, and even USB gadget mode for Raspberry Pi.\nText Processing Tools: Install tools like Pandoc and TexLive, essential for converting notes. There's also a role for my Zettel Composer tool.\nEmacs Environment: If you work with Emacs, the playbook can build it from source and set up Spacemacs with integrated tmux.\nAncient Greek Texts: For anyone working with classical languages, there’s a setup for Diogenes with Thesaurus Linguae Graecae (TLG) data.\nSeafile Client and Sync Notifications: You can configure Seafile for seamless syncing of notes across devices and set up sync notifications to stay updated on changes.\nIf you’ve got a Raspberry Pi or a whole fleet of them, this playbook should help you get everything up and running quickly. It’s especially handy if you like to experiment with different setups or need consistency across multiple devices.\nYou can find the playbook here.\nEnjoy!",

I recently used them to get over a big hump.\nI was trying to learn something specific in programming. It is a huge library, and although I am a fluent programmer (having programmed everyday for the last two decades), I was resisiting this.\nWhat helped me over the hump was a combination of my Zk with Anki, a free flashcard system, which does spaced repetition. I think I now know the library I wanted to master really well: the size is what had been a hinderance and no longer seems to be. I made around 200 cards, and I know them inside out now.\nLong term, of course, it is the zettelkasten that will help me with the big picture. But @Sascha or others: have you experimented with Anki and if so how has it worked out?",

This got me wondering—what other editors have link-as-search?\nI searched the forums and found this thread where @Sasha mentioned that Zettlr has link-as-search functionality:\n\n  \nOne big reason for Zettlr is the link-as-search functionality. This is perhaps the most important feature implementation to make an app software-agnostic.\n\n\nZettlr's documentation covers link-as-search here.\nAdditionally, I found a thread on the topic of link-as-search vs link-as-direct\nDoes anyone know of any other editors with built-in link-as-search functionality?",

The analogy is:\nYou can tell if an Italian chef is still passionate about what they do not through the inspired specials or the amazing cannolis or tiramisu, but all you have to do is look at the red sauce. The red sauce is something they’re supposed to make fresh every day; It’s one of the main fundamentals of being an Italian chef. It’s also something that can easily become the mundane if they’re not careful. It’s in the fundamentals that a dip in passion is shown in.\nI’m VERY new to building my network of notes, so I’m curious, would most people put this analogy as a separate note like “Red Sauce Analogy” or would this live in a note for the overall concept titled “When passion slips, it shows in the mundane first”?",
