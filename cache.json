However I struggle with the second one...\n In theory it shouldn't be too complicated.. My approach was as follows:\n  \nRead the lines\n Split the lines in 3 different lists (depending in the first character)\n Sum up all values\n ---\n  \n1.-2. were no problem.\n With 3 I thought I can just use foldl like that \n foldl (\\ p c -> p + read (last c)) 0 testInputf\n where testInputf is a list of Strings ([String]).\n For me it would make sense that c is the whole String and last c is the last element of the String... However this doesn't seem to be the case here... if I write it like that Haskell throws an error saying, that \n  Couldn't match type ‘Char’ with ‘[Char]’ Expected type: [[String]] Actual type: [String] \n And I can't figure out why... Is there anything Im missing? Is there a general way of getting all last elements out of the Strings in a String List?\n For testing purposes Ive also tried using map \n map (read . last) testInputf \n which throws the same error and I can't figure out why...\n Thank you very much!\n    submitted by    /u/mathiscool42  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm a Haskell dev, but I use Kotlin in my day job. \n For those not familiar, Jetpack Compose is a compiler plugin for Kotlin which allows for a declarative React/VDOM style of UI programming by composing so-called \"composable functions\" (which is funny to me as a Haskell dev, because what is a function if not composable?) to build up the UI.\n The kicker is, at compile-time, these composable functions are eliminated -- and (as I understand it) compiled to some imperative code that updates the UI appropriately in a reactive manner as it's inputs change.\n Svelte works similarly, but for JavaScript.\n So in other words, you get something that looks a lot like a VDOM/React style UI -- but without the overhead of an actual VDOM!\n This is a fascinating idea to me, and I'd love to learn more about how such approaches work -- but at least in terms of compiler/DSL/PL-type features (basically anything that manipulates an AST), I find Haskell far easier to understand and read. So I was wondering if anyone has implemented anything similar in Haskell (or even a related language like Purescript).\n I know there's gi-gtk-declarative and Halogen (on the Purescript side) -- and while these are both excellent libraries for declarative UI programming, as far as I know, both of them are implemented via a VDOM -- not with a compilation step.\n Does anyone know of anyone who's attempted such a compile-time approach to declarative UIs in Haskell?\n    submitted by    /u/sintrastes  \n [link]   [comments]",

We are currently using it for upcoming experiments at NASA Langley.\n We'd like to also take this opportunity to publicly thank the team that creates BNFC, for their tool, their response to technical questions during the development of Ogma, and for accommodations made to help us speed up our release process.\n If you have any issues, feel free to open a ticket in the github repo directly.\n Happy haskelling,\n [1] https://github.com/NASA/ogma\n [2] https://github.com/NASA-SW-VnV/fret\n [3] https://github.com/Copilot-Language/copilot\n    submitted by    /u/ivanpd  \n [link]   [comments]",

Many people seem to rely on a combination of some environment and IO, in one way or another (RIO, ReaderT env IO, IO + explicitly passing some environment, Handle Pattern, record-of-functions in the environment, ...).\n I am currently experimenting with a slightly different approach and I am quite happy with the results so far. More concretely, instead of combining an environment with IO, we can combine it with a continuation-based version of IO (aka ContT/Codensity/Managed) like ...\n newtype Program e a = Program (e -> forall b. (a -> IO b) -> IO b) \n ... with instances for Applicative, Functor, Monad, MonadIO, etc. One can read the type as \"a program running with an environment of type e and producing a…",

That is to say, let the relation on records be induced by the subset relation on the sets of field labels.\n Example:\n data A = A {x, y: Int} data B = B {x, y, z: Int} \n Here, B has an extra field z, so we are justified in saying that A ≤ B.\n Now:\n  \nA function that takes A can also take B (and ignore all the extra fields).\n In other words, if f ∷ A → Y and b ∷ B, then f b ∷ Y is well-typed.\n \nA function that gives B can also give A (and forget all the extra fields).\n In other words, if f ∷ X → B and x ∷ X, then f x ∷ B is well-typed.\n \n This can currently be done by writing boring code, so having it as a feature would reduce the amount of boring code, which is good. In real life, records tend to be big, so the reduction is substantial.\n A dual construction can be offered for sum types: for example, a function that can take A + B can handle an A or a B as well.\n Is this less than ideal? What are the problems? In a dream world of infinite possibilities, where you can add subtyping to Haskell, how would you go about it?\n  \nI imagine there are some people here that know everything there is to know about type systems, some people that have no idea of what a type system with subtyping looks like (me — I only know C and Haskell), and many people somewhere in between.

For example - DList is created to be consumed partially & in a lazy fashion, while Acc is created to be a builder type that goes into full normalization to be converted into a storage type (like Vector or Seq).

Here are the 3 possible implementations we've considered each of them have drawbacks:\n  \nSimple data type data Version Natural Natural Natural\n \nSum type data Version = Major0Minor1Patch0 | Major0Minor2Patch0 | Major1Minor0Patch0 | Major1Minor1Patch0\n \nUse a sum type on each major minor patch version. This is the approach we are currently taking: ```haskell data Patch = Patch0 deriving (Eq, Show, Generic, Enum, Bounded)\n \n data Minor = Minor0 | Minor1 deriving (Eq, Show, Generic, Enum, Bounded)\n data Major = Major0 deriving (Eq, Show, Generic, Enum, Bounded)\n data Version = Version { major :: Major , minor :: Minor , patch :: Patch } deriving (Generic, Eq, Show) ```\n Requirements:\n Serialization/deserialization via aeson\n Complicated pattern matching\n This is important with event sourcing as some consumers may not care about minor version changes only major version changes.\n If we have a new major version and we don't handle it then we want to fail to compile.\n 1: Wouldn't give us strong compile-time guarantees. I don't know all actual versions we have.\n 2: Forces us to handle all versions even if the consumer does not care. I don't have a way to say I only care about Major versions.\n 3: Lets us handle only major version changes, and we know all possible major versions. However, we are representing a product and can introduce versions that don't really exist. e.g. if we have 0.1.0, 1.0.0, 1.1.0 then if we create a 1.2.0 we are now also representing 0.2.0.\n I'm curious if anyone has an alternative representation that might be better.

The plan is to patch entire head.hackage (which includes, for instance, pandoc) before cutting a final release of text-2.0.\n Thanks to Ben Gamari's efforts, text submodule in GHC source tree has been already bumped to 2.0-rc1. The next major release of GHC (9.4, ~Q3 2022) will ship with text-2.0.\n    submitted by    /u/Bodigrim  \n [link]   [comments]",

A disjoint union, as I understand, is just when you have a union of sets that have nothing shared; you \"summed\" the sets. So we imagine our List above a sort of disjoint union of Nil and Cons a (List a). Correct? What gets confusing is from a Wikipedia article on Algebraic data types :\n  \nIn set theory the equivalent of a sum type is a disjoint union, a set whose elements are pairs consisting of a tag (equivalent to a constructor) and an object of a type corresponding to the tag (equivalent to the constructor arguments).\n  \nThe disjoint union article was fairly understandable, but I'm not making the connection between my List above and this quote above about tags and constructors and constructor arguments.

To make this extensible I'd like some freer monads, more extensible effects style interface, composing the command enum like Either Op1 Op2.\n But my usecase could be seen as a mildly wonky Op-Based CRDT which means the operations commute and order doesn't matter. It would be really nice if internally I could store everything as (MVector Op1, MVector Op2)behind the scenes.\n This lead me to a number of questions:\n  \nIs there an array-of-sums representation that stores Vector (Either Op1 Op2) as (Vector Op1, Vector Op2)?\n Is there a better way to derive unboxed vector boilerplate? I have seen https://hackage.haskell.org/package/vector-th-unbox-0.2.2/docs/Data-Vector-Unboxed-Deriving.html before but it feels like DerivingVia should be able to handle it if the monad was constrained to be representational\n Are there interface ideas to manipulate unboxed vectors structurally? Say, lift projection functions like Vector (a,b) -> Vector a? In my case also things like pop one Op1 value, or take all Op2 values\n Is there an approach to structurally manipulate types in Haskell? Most code in Haskell only folds over the generic representation but e.g. StrictCheck has some tooling to add a functor at each level of a type, typescript has a bunch of tools for this like\n  \n \ntype ExtractPII<Type> = { [Property in keyof Type]: Type[Property] extends { pii: true } ? true : false; }; \n If people have ideas to any of these points I'd really like to hear about them!\n    submitted by    /u/Tarmen  \n [link]   [comments]",

Actually I don't have a lot of time grasping all of the concepts and so I began with basics of Scala and till now my experience is neither too good nor too bad.\n ​\n As of 2021 (or we can say almost 2022), what would be your advise for a beginer with statically typed language and how should I go about learning Scala so that I get a good grip in it?\n ​\n Additionally, when we say Java there are two things: 1. Pure Programming Side of Java, 2. JVM and of-course here I am not referring to the JVM side as I understand, since Scala anyways runs on JVM, that's a necessary thing.

          "description": "I understand the purpose of every course is learning, but I am already familiar with most of Functional Programming concepts (I often play with F# in my free time).\n But scala jobs in my area are already quite low, and whenever there is one, they seem to be preferring java experienced developer (since scala devs here are pretty low in number already).\n Some how I have ended up with almost 7 years of PHP and javascript experience. (We all know about the reputation PHP has in developer community). but every thing about scala excites me (The FP, big data, clustered & distributed systems)\n I want to get into scala but recruiters won't even reply to my application because of my background.so hence the questions, does the coursera course certificate help people landing a scala job. (or atleast get me an interview, I understand after that it depends on my skills)\n    submitted by    /u/masoodahm87  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I have been using Scala and following it for years. Scala is declining in usage because Java is becoming better and Kotlin is getting pushed hard and is a smaller step for many Java developers. Personally I really love the Scala language over all the other languages I have tried. I have been following on Twitter and on Reddit and the only thing I feel is that I want to stay as far away from that mess as possible. I sugest the leaders in the comunity to travel somewhere and get a professional mediator and resolve all issues. You don't have to be friends after that but at least stop making Scala look more like daytime soap opera than an excellent comunity with smart people. You all want this to succeed. Perhaps it is more complicated and I'm being naive but from a bystanders perspective it looks pretty bad.\n The reason why I went to all the Scala conferences was because of all the smart people and the technology. Please bring back that focus and become that comunity again.\n As said before I don't have the details. I'm just describing how it looks from my perspective and others might feel different or that it's to complex to resolve these issues.\n    submitted by    /u/0OOO00000OO00O0O0OOO  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello. I've posted this on r/functionalprogramming. In short: I'm not smart enough for Haskell, so I'm looking for other alternatives where immutability and pure functions are, if not mandatory, at least encouraged.\n In just a few days I hopped to Elm, Ocaml, back to Typescript and, finally, there and back again to Javascript(is programming-language hopping a thing?), after this book got me excited to give it a try. After reaching to chapter 8 with a certain hopelessness regarding (lack of) types, I ended up to this article with quite strong arguments against using JS if you want strong typing and functional proogramming facilities (\"Functional programming. Types. JavaScript. Pick two\"). The article mentioned PureScript and here I am. From Haskell syntax to strong typing, the language seems to have everything I'm looking for mentioned right at its home page.\n While learning Haskell, I liked pretty much almost everything. I really, really liked its syntax, the ways we can define types and type classes, its simplicity, and I think it was relatively easy to learn that. What got me really overburdened was how to \"change states\" and IO. From that point of view, is there something along the way that disapoint me?\n EDIT: this is being helpful: https://github.com/purescript/documentation/blob/master/language/Differences-from-Haskell.md\n    submitted by    /u/gooddevenv  \n [link]   [comments]",

I know that org-agenda can get pretty sluggish around a thousand files, but it's my understanding that org-ql is faster, although maybe not that faster. Any experience? Thanks!\n NOTE: this is not for TODOs but for general search, I've seen workarounds that exclude files not containing tasks nor projects from the search, but that's not what I'm interested in, I want to search every file and ideally using more structured queries like those of org-ql (vs deft).\n EDIT: I've been experimenting a bit with this:\n  \nI cloned this big nonsense ZK which is designed to stress-test note-taking apps.\n I converted all notes from md to org using pandoc: for f in *; do pandoc --to org \"$f\" > \"${f%%.md}.org\"; done. Not really necessary for what it follows, except for the file extension part, but anyway.\n Now, searching for some text with ripgrep is very fast, as expected, for example with 56/10000 matches:\n  \n```\n  \ntime rg -c \"to queer noises\" *.org | wc -l 56\n  \nreal 0m0.317s user 0m0.195s sys 0m0.316s ```\n  \nNow with org-ql the same search setting org-directory to be the ZK folder, requiring no grouping and just random order, and doing a (regexp \"to queer noises\") freezes, at least I've been waiting for minutes now for it to end. Repeating the search in a subset of that ZK with just a few hundred notes, it ends after some seconds, but it's still borderline usable.\n  \nSo I guess the answer is a sound NO, org-ql can't be reasonably used in a setup like this one. u/github-alphapapa do you have any objection to my methodology here? Thanks!\n EDIT: deft has also been terribly sluggish with this same ZK, both in generating the deft buffer and in searching through it, so the best option seems to be something like consult-ripgrep.\n    submitted by    /u/nnenneplex  \n [link]   [comments]",

I used vim to edit smaller files (like config files, etc.). I primarily used a graphical IDE for my \"real\" work (JetBrains tools specifically). After watching some videos on emacs (shout-out DistroTube), I decided to give emacs a try. I went for doom emacs since it seemed to be the most popular, and it had vim-like keybindings (evil mode). Once I learned the basics of org-mode, I decided that this would be amazing for taking notes in class. \n After a few weeks of taking notes in class, I am very happy with org-mode for taking notes. I really like the customizability of emacs (not org-mode specifically). \n Some of the features I use the most are:\n  \nInserting LaTeX snippets for complex math/comp. sci notes.\n Folding headers to keep my notes clean\n Adding TODO tags (with org agenda) to log assignments/exams\n Exporting org files to other formats (especially HTML) to share with classmates\n  \nWhat other features do you guys like to use for this purpose? And is there any feedback you can give me to make my experience even better?\n    submitted by    /u/tman5400  \n [link]   [comments]",

Even we use some plugin like org-edna/org-depend to express a dependant task of a headline h1 who isn't a descendant of h1, all functions on subtask can run only for descendant of a headline.\n For instance, what will happen if 2 projects p1 and p2 depend a same task t1. t1 is a descendant of p1. And we want know the progress of p2, the progress of t1 won't be integrated to calculation of progress of p2.\n To solve this problem, org mode should integrate the notion of symbolic link headline, like in tree based file system, we have file and symlink into a file. I don't think org mode will evolve into this direction, because it is designed to write documents.

This is the code I have: \n #+property: header-args :includes <stdio.h> #+property: header-args :defines cool_macro(x) x #+property: header-args :exports both #+property: header-args :results output #+begin_src C printf(\"cool_macro(7): %u\\n\", cool_macro(7)); printf(\"cool_macro(7): %u\\n\", cool_macro(7)); #+end_src \n As it is, both :exports and :results have no effect. I figured that if I place them above the :includes then they'll have effect, but I get a compilation error because it cannot find the macro, as if now both :includes and :defines doesn't have effect.\n If I place those 2 after the #+begin_src C then everything works as expected, but it's inconvenient since I want those to affect the whole buffer..\n #+property: header-args :includes <stdio.h> #+property: header-args :defines cool_macro(x) x #+begin_src C :results output :exports both printf(\"cool_macro(7): %u\\n\", cool_macro(7)); printf(\"cool_macro(7): %u\\n\", cool_macro(7)); #+end_src \n Am I doing something really wrong or what?\n Thanks.\n    submitted by    /u/mefff_  \n [link]   [comments]",

I looked into the Faces Wiki on Emacs found the remapping functionality - https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Face-Remapping.html. But it works just for the current buffer as far as i know. I want to avoid hooks for buffer switches to use the remapping, and preferably have this in my config, execute once, override the faces and be done at that point.\n What I am trying to achieve is force a few packages, which use custom face attributes (i.e helm-rg) to use the default attributes of my theme (i.e make the helm-rg-preview-line-highlight face force inherit/override itself from my mode-line face styles etc.). I am using doom-one theme - https://github.com/hlissner/emacs-doom-themes (on vanilla emacs, not doom)\n (set-face-attribute 'dst nil ;; This is Just a sample, there are more attributes not specified here :underline 'unspecified :slant 'unspecified :weight 'unspecified :height 'unspecified :family 'unspecified :foreground 'unspecified :background 'unspecified :inherit 'src) \n    submitted by    /u/asmodeus812  \n [link]   [comments]",

I can mark an issue as \"DONE\" and it closes the github issue, or change its content, or labels. \n And a few minutes ago I wrote a little code to insert my org-roam notes as rust documentation comments\n  \nIt's not much, but it is honest work and I am happy I am finally doing it. \n Quick demo of #2\n    submitted by    /u/verticaleyes  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Inspired by recent, well-known articles on Embark and on Avy, I've started testing Embark over the past few days - and it's already turning into the interface I always wanted and only sort of knew I needed. While it's extremely useful out-of-the-box, I've already found a few cases where I would want to use it but can't, because it doesn't understand the construct at point. Examples:\n  \nOrg mode timestamps - to provide operations like activate/inactivate, change, pop calendar to that date, bump by repeater, etc.\n \nOrg mode headlines - pretty much everything you can do on those, that Org mode has bound to countless weird keys. Including \"speed commands\", most of which could work without quitting the Embark \"prompter\", the way e.g. navigating to next/prev symbol works.\n \nOrg mode tables - embark-cycle could be able to switch between cell, row, column, whole table (perhaps also stopping at \"rowgroup\", \"column group\" and \"subtable\", which would be rectangular areas that are bound by hlines and column group markers) - each of those would have its own contextual commands available. For example, \"eval formula\", so one doesn't have to remember reference syntax and how many times to press C-u before pressing C-c =.\n \nSyntactic elements and expressions in programming language modes, allowing for e.g. language-specific actions.\n \n From the looks of it, it's not that hard to write any - the tricky bit being target classifiers. I'm going to take a stab at adding some classifiers and action keymaps for things I commonly interact with - but I'd like to avoid repeating work that might already be done better. Hence my question: are there any \"extension packages\" that enable Embark to recognize more target types? Or, are any of you already using hand-written ones (and if yes, can you share them)?\n    submitted by    /u/TeMPOraL_PL  \n [link]   [comments]",

After I practiced emacs over time; I started to like emacs.\n  \nI could use lynx inside emacs to form a psuedomultitab browser. Eventually I learned that emacs has a built-in browser eww. I favored that browser over lynx.\n \nIt was nice to be able to containerize workspaces, like for programming, school work, miscellaneous stuff, and just general browsing without having to deal with floating windows.\n \n I have Autism and ADHD; emacs helps with dealing with Autism, because it does not give much lack of sensory information; emacs is hyperresponsive, unlike VSCode, so it does not hurt my eyes when I try to do heavy-load tasks.\n emacs also helps with ADHD, since I can easily organize stuff with org-mode. I can also easily navigate buffers without a pointing device; I am uncomfortable with pointing devices (mouses and touchpads), despite using them for 11 years. Pointing devices seem to really mess with me and I can't control them as well (as I can with a keyboard).\n EDIT: My only complaint is that I wish I could display images in CLI emacs, like running viu on links to images after eww finishes loading. That complaint is not a criticism on emacs itself though.\n    submitted by    /u/Amicdict  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm really surprised how friendly this community is. I've never seen a more friendly online group ever. \n I am the guy that asked about \"Emacs-Lisp functions beneath the surface\" a few days ago. \n Anyway, I was watching this video and there is something that caught my attention more than anything else.

Why is Emacs considered a bloat Software, in some communities, then? 12 MB doesn't seem much. \n And what do people mean when they say that Emacs is bloat or memory intensive? Is the core bloated?\n There are definitely people that are more for debating than actually addressing problems or having a discussion. So I'm really curious, is it that there is actually a real reason they are saying it, or is it just that it's a common \"saying\" of Vim users and users who find Emacs \"too difficult\"? \n Or is it that an average user uses so many packages that Emacs becomes CPU and/or memory intensive? \n What do you consider a bloat software?\n Also, even the guy in the video said that at 18:20: \n  \n\"All these things that people have said about Emacs having a big footprint and being memory intensive blah blah blah it's all true\" \n  \nI would love to hear your perspective on this commonly brought up \"contention\".\n    submitted by    /u/aqua_cap  \n [link]   [comments]",

However, using count-words-region, I can see that I can actually only fit 234 characters on a line without it causing wrapping (I'm using global-visual-line-mode, although this problem persists when it's off). This causes problems with any functionality that tries to right align content - for instance, org-agenda will try to align content so that the last character in a heading's tags is on column 238 (i.e. on the right side of the screen), but since column 238 is actually beyond the right side of the screen, the tags end up on the following visual line. Instead of\n * TODO my task a :@home: * TODO my task b :@work: \n I end up with\n * TODO my task a :@home: * TODO my task b :@work: \n ...which is significantly less information dense and generally uglier. I was content to set org-agenda-tags-column to 0, but I've recently picked up ledger, and this issue has also started messing up the formatting in its reports. This also happens regardless of how I split windows - if I split vertically, window-text-width reports a width of 118, but I can actually only fit 114 columns.

I find it easier just ssh’ing into a Linux cloud vm in that this allows me to install whatever I need. So thats good but then I’m in emacs (spacemacs ) terminal not GUI. \n The reason I ask is that terminal only , there are problems displaying graphics e.g. matplotlib plots. So my workaround for this is Jupyter lab: jupyter lab --ip=0.0.0.0 --port=9090. My question is… is there any way to view plots in emacs given my setup? I’d prefer to have freedom to use emacs org mode and render plots than be forced to use Jupiter lab notebooks .\n Does anybody know, if possible, how I can display images in emacs using cloud vm?\n Thanks\n    submitted by    /u/darter_analyst  \n [link]   [comments]",

I tried rtags a few years back but it crashed frequently. When checking the state of things recently I noticed LSP was getting big so I decided to give it a try to switch full time. I installed a few more packages like lsp, helm (love it). I even read the beginner's elisp intro to understand its syntax.\n That's when the rabbit hole started and i read about spacemacs and doom emacs\n *** doom/spacemacs : an overwhelming layer *** I get the reason for those distributions : having a curated set of packages preconfigured to work together + load time optimisations for an out of the box working experience. (+vim like experience for those who like it) \n My issue was that after installing i did not know where to start. These 100+ packages must be worth learning right ? I expected a kind of interactive walkthrough like emacs's own tutorial but ended up on the web documentation instead, which was also overwhelming.\n I wonder how people who have never used emacs/vim can get started easily on this. Do they use only 1% of the available features ? Is there a master tutorial somewhere that i missed ? \n And for people who like tinkering/debugging with their config to have exactly what they want, i find it much easier on a minimalistic example than when 100+ plugins are involved.\n ** who are those distributions for ? *** I have the feeling that beginners would be better off with a simple config with discoverability improvements like which-key/helm\n And for seasoned user who like tinkering with the defaults, i find that building your config helps you understand how to use the plugin you're using\n So fellow doom/space users, what made you jump on that train ? How did you get to \"master\" this complex environment ? \n Cheers\n    submitted by    /u/Horrih  \n [link]   [comments]",

Now C-x b, switch to that buffer in shell major mode and bash completion doesn't work properly. It means if I want to cd /etc/ and the press TAB twice it doesn't prompts content of /etc directory of my remote machine but my local. If I want correct completion of remote shell I have to use TRAMP session. Does anyone fix that problem and found workaround?

          "description": "Hey guys! So I killed my mid-2011 MBA yesterday (sigh..RIP), and had to replace it asap with another MBA, so I now have an M1 running Big Sur. Don't get me started on all of the things I hate about this..BUT, one of the things I am disliking intensely the most is that I can no longer just type \"emacs filename\" at the command line, and invoke plain old non-GUI emacs. I've installed the GUI emacs from emacsformacsosx, and I have an alias so I can invoke it by typing \"emacs filename\", but of course it still invokes the efmo GUI version. I'm competent enough to sudo and follow clear step-by-step instructions (yeah, I'm one of those users that every sysadmin dreads..I know *just* enough to f everything up), but everything I've found assumes that you already have 'brew' or some other one (I forget the name)...and that's where I'm stymied. Does anybody have pointers to step-by-step directions for getting regular emacs back on my computer? (There are a lot of sites that say \"emacs comes already installed but it's not the best version\" but if that is true for Big Sur out of the box, for the life of me I can't find it (lots of files with emacs in the name do turn up when I do a 'locate' but none that seem to be actually executable).\n Thank you in advance!\n Annie\n    submitted by    /u/amitchell  \n [link]   [comments]",

In BODY, symbols of the type $N, where N is a non-zero, positive number, represent positional arguments. $* represents a list of optional remaining arguments. ,(+ $1 $2) expands to (lambda ($1 $2) (+ $1 $2)).

I hope my question makes sense. \n I regularly use remote Debian machines at work, interacting exclusively via SSH sessions. I was curious about using Emacspeak on them, as I’m visually impaired. Everything I’m reading is about setting up Emacspeak locally, though. I’ve found mention of a remote speech server, but haven’t found any guides on exactly how to get it to work. I use Windows as my primary OS at work. \n In summary, my usual workflow is: on Windows, SSH into Debian, and use a Windows screen reader to interact with the remote machine that way. If I can, I’d like to have Emacspeak running on the remote machine, with speech and sound output coming from my local Windows computer. The lag may make this unusable, I don’t know. I’d at least like to give it a shot, just to see what happens. Again, I’ve also never used Emacs in any way. I’m comfortable in Bash, though.

          "description": "I'm in the process of migrating back to emacs (for org-mode, especially org-roam) from vim land and want to recreate my workflow. I have a work-issued MacBook that's performance is less than optimal, especially for docker stuff. To remedy that, I have a beefy VM on my personal workstation that I ssh into then do all my work in nvim with tmux and it all works quite nicely.\n I'm trying to recreate that workflow with the Emacs GUI. I've found a few blog posts that talk about SSH forwarding the emacs server socket allowing you to open remote files in your GUI using TRAMP mode. This is not really what I want since I want pretty much all compute, (running makes tasks, using the lang server, etc) to be on my workstation VM and just have a window into it via the emacs GUI on my Mac.\n What I'm looking at doing now is running an emacs server in TCP mode on my VM, then connecting to that on my mac. What I've read so far is that it wasn't made for what I want, just because Windows doesn't support Unix sockets, and there are massive security concerns, which is not a concern for me since my VM is only accessible through a VPN.\n I guess my questions boil down to:\n  \nIs anyone using emacs server TCP mode to work on a remote machine with good or bad experience?\n Is there a better way to do what I want?\n Am I being a moron trying to use the GUI and should just use emacs in terminal mode like I was with nvim?\n  \nThanks for any info you can provide!\n    submitted by    /u/RyanTheKing  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "So, I was working in an org file with tables that needed to reference tables from different files. According to the org manual, you can do this with remote(<id>, <range>). This is problematic for a couple of reasons. First, it is very fragile. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. Maybe I was doing something wrong with the IDs, but it was very unstable for me. Second, it means that, if you sync your org files in multiple machines, you'll also have to sync the id. Finally, and this is the big one, accoring to the org manual, you assing an ID to a heading and the remote call will look for the first table under that heading. But what if you need the second table?\n Instead of fighting with the IDs problem, I decided to do some elisp magic to see if I could grab a table range from a remote table with file path and #:name. To my surpirse, it was very easy to do. All you need is this function somewhere in your init file:\n (defun j/remote-table-range (path name range) (with-current-buffer (find-file-noselect path) (org-table-get-remote-range name range))) \n Then, you have to add the #:name tag to the remote table:\n ;; Contents of ~/table-test/remote.org #+name: remote-t1 | C1 | C2 | | 1 | 2 | \n Then, from another table, you can call it like this:\n ;; Contents of ~/table-test/main.org | C1 | C2 | | | | #+tblfm: @1$1='(j/remote-table-range \"./remote.org\" \"remote-t1\" (string ?@ ?1 ?$ ?1)) \n The path can be absolute or relative, and you can reference any table in that file using the name argument. The wierd string call is explained here.\n And that's it. IMO, while it makes for longer formulas, it is way more convenient than the current remote function with IDs and have less limitations. \n I was amazed with how little code was needed for this. Man, do I love emacs...\n    submitted by    /u/ElCondorHerido  \n [link]   [comments]",

I didn't want to go with Spacemacs or Doom Emacs. \n Configuring init.el file got me thinking - What are all those functions? I know that ELisp is a dialect of a programming language called LISP, but knowing many languages ELisp seems so strange. It's absolutely peculiar. \n You all know that Python has been considered a \"pseudo code\" language in which you almost tell in human English what do you want to achieve.I actually believe that ELisp falls under that description much better. \n I don't understand what all those functions are doing below the surface. It seems to me that if I'd want to make a AI Chess game by my own rules, that the only thing I'd need to write in ELisp, would be: \n  \n(setq AI-chess-my-own-rules t) \n  \nAnd that would be it.\n Can I see the implementation of each function I have put in my init.el?How does, for example: \n  \n(load theme 'doom-gruvbox) \n  \nwork? \n Can I see the implementation? Or (scroll-bar-mode -1)? How does that work? Does that tells the X to stop drawing the scroll-bar in Emacs? What is the language that those functions are written in, and where could I see, inside or outside of Emacs, the implementation of it? \n And how is it possible that I can type a name of any function written in ELisp and it will just work? Aren't there any libraries? How does that work? \n I believe these are trivial questions for you, but I am really new in this. I fell in love with the Org mode, but Emacs seems so strange. I got used to parenthesis, I get it - That's the syntax. Fine. I don't have a problem with it.

However after it appears to be done, the Emacs frame is just...stuck. It's a blank frame. No *scratch* buffer, just a blank GTK frame. I'm running Emacs with emacs --debug-init for now, and calling kill -USR2 [the emacs pid] will bring it back. Sort of. The GTK frame is still blank, but if I press a key, the scratch buffer appears. Granted, it just freezes up again. My best guess is that it's related to garbage collection, but I wouldn't be sure how to tell.\n Native compilation\n So while I was using Doom Emacs, native compilation did make Emacs perform a bit better. However having moved away from Doom, I don't have the benefit of the compilation process being printed out anywhere when packages are update. Doom has a bunch of functions to have a CLI program, but all I really want is to be able to see if and when there's a problem in the native compilation process. I'm wondering if there's a simple way to go about this.\n Thanks, and have a Happy Thanksgiving to my fellow Americans!\n    submitted by    /u/alecStewart1  \n [link]   [comments]",

I found some rough edges that I have been trying to smooth out and wanted to share a particularly simple one. \n The EXWM wiki suggets merging framemove with windmove to move between workspaces on two different monitors. I found that framemove considers not just visible workspaces but also inactive (invisible) workspaces. Imagine the following setup\n Monitor 1: assigned workspaces 0 and 1; currently showing workspace 1\n Monitor 2: assigned workspaces 2; currently showing monitor 2. Focus is on workspace 2. \n Trying to move across frames using framemove could actually cause focus to not just switch to monitor 1 but also monitor 1 to change from showing workspace 1 to workspace 0. \n Turns out it was pretty simple to modify framemove to restrict to only considering currently active frames using the predicate function `exwm-workspace--active-p`. \n ​\n In case anyone else runs into this issue take a look at my forked version of framemove: https://github.com/jsilve24/framemove. \n ​\n Honestly, it seems rediculous that I forked this repo since my contribution is essentially nil. That said, I really wasn't sure a better way since the original library is on the emacswiki and also maintained by the emacsmirror github user. \n ​\n That said, hope this helps someone else.\n ​\n Cheers.\n    submitted by    /u/JustinSilverman  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I am annoyed that when I C-g out of my expand-region session my cursor does not return to its original location.\n In trying to resolve this annoyance I found that expand-region comes with a variable er/save-mode-excursion that is described as:\n  \nA function to save excursion state while expanding\n  \nI set this variable to (lambda (&rest body) () (save-excursion body)) and I found that this does not suit my needs for the following reasons.\n  \nThis variable does not seem to effect any er/ commands outside of er/expand-region. For example if I do er/mark-defun and then hit C-g my cursor position is not returned.\n I often use a key-chord bound to (lambda () (interactive) (execute-kbd-macro (read-kbd-macro \"\\C-g\"))). When I use this key-chord instead of actually hitting C-g my cursor position is not returned. I do not understand why this is.\n  \nNext I tried taking advantage of the deactivate-mark-hook to programatically hit C-u C-SPC.\n (add-hook 'deactivate-mark-hook #'(lambda () (let ((current-prefix-arg 4)) (call-interactively 'set-mark-command)))) \n This works great for my non expand-region region endeavours but when I try to use any er/ commands I get unpredictable behavior. I believe the problem is that expand-region resets the mark multiple times and therefore deactivate-mark-hook is called multiple times.\n My next idea is to make my own expand-region-minor-mode where I can probably solve this problem. Before I do this though I want to know if there are already existing solutions.\n    submitted by    /u/thirtySeven73  \n [link]   [comments]",

When you're done editing the element, you can do C-c C-c to dismiss the *Calc Edit* buffer and the original calc buffer will now have your edited element on the stack.\n However, on a version of Emacs I built off the emacs-28 branch about a week ago, also with emacs -q, calling calc-edit will instead bring up the *Calc Edit* buffer in a separate window, while the original calc buffer is still visible. Then, after editing the element and doing C-c C-c, the window layout becomes messed up: the original calc buffer remains at the bottom, but now there's another calc buffer and *Calc Trail* buffer in the place of where the *Calc Edit* buffer was. I attached an image to show what this layout looks like.\n Since this happens with emacs -q, it seems like it could be a bug, but searching around online doesn't show anyone else bringing it up, so maybe it's either a recent bug, or could it just be me? Can anyone confirm this behavior?\n This is all on macOS, by the way.\n ​\n https://preview.redd.it/pm14mfu5bv081.png?width=2606&format=png&auto=webp&s=f22d20d275a62dce7bc268a58acb98fd2deec086\n    submitted by    /u/Comfortable-Bit3236  \n [link]   [comments]",

However, this approach starts to break down in more complicated scenarios, such as:\n (local-leader-def :keymaps 'org-mode-map \"a\" '(:ignore t :wk \"attachments\") \"a a\" 'org-attach \"a d\" '(:ignore t :wk \"deletion\") \"a d d\" 'org-attach-delete-one \"a d G\" 'org-attach-delete-all \"r\" '(:ignore t :wk \"refile\") \"r r\" 'org-refile) \n First, this is kind of ugly - Org has a ton of features, and I try to use a lot of them, so some of my key sequences can get pretty long. I end up retyping the same prefix many, many times, sometimes with multiple layers of the (:ignore t :wk \"foo\") trick (as seen above).\n Second, (and more annoyingly, IMO) doing it this way \"shadows\" the which-key description for modes which share a prefix. That is, if I'm in ledger mode and type \"SPC m\", it yields the suggestion \"r -> refile\" instead of \"r -> ledger-report\" as it should.\n I've been futzing around with general's \":prefix-command\" and related facilities to try and figure out a way of avoiding this second issue, but so far I haven't been able to get anything to work. Since my current strategy is ad hoc and not based on any best practices I'm aware of, I thought I'd ask here if there's a canonical/idiomatic way of using general's capabilities to define groups of similarly-prefixed commands without breaking which-key.\n (Also, why is there a distinction between :prefix-command and :prefix-map?

          "description": "Hi everyone,\n I've been diving into learning some emacs over the last week or so as I'm interested in possibly switching over from using neovim (primarily because I want org-mode). I've been deep diving into a lot of new things and trying to set up alternatives for my major nvim workflows, but one that I've been having a ton of trouble with is searching and the previews for it in particular. In my projects I make heavy use of Telescope within neovim and one of the major reasons that I love it is the ability to preview grep results from files in my project directory within a separate window. I like being able to get more context from the search without actually opening up a new buffer. I've set up Ivy and Counsel and was trying to get the same functionality working, but I'm having a heck of a time with previewing. The closest I've come is realizing that after using counsel-projectile-rg that I can use ivy-next-line-and-call functionality to move the current buffer through the search results with C-M n or C-M p, however, that actually opens the buffer and populates my buffer list. Does anyone know if there's some sort of functionality to open a new preview window and navigate through those search results in it by default with C-j (I'm using evil mode). Essentially I'd always like this type of preview whenever I'm doing searches. Also, I'm not attached to any particular completion or search framework, so if this is easier in something like Helm then I'd be open to solutions from that as well.

          "description": "I'm currently using General for leader-key bindings, and I have various categories of keybindings under different prefix keys like \"f\" for files, \"b\" for buffers, etc. I use SPC as my leader key, so to access my file related commands I would press \"SPC f\", where I would be presented with a list (via which-key) of my file related keybindings.\n Ok I'm sure many of you are with me so far. Here is my question: I'd like to create keybindings for language-specific commands, but I don't want to create a separate prefix key for each language. What's the best way to manage that?\n One idea I've thought of is to use \"l\" (for \"language\") as a prefix key for whatever language mode I'm in. So if I'm programming in Scheme, and I press \"SPC l\" it would bring up my scheme keybindings. But if I was in javascript, and I press \"SPC l\" it would bring up my javascript bindings.\n However I'm not sure how to implement that. I'm a bit of a emacs noob to be honest.\n Is there some other recommended way to deal with this? I'm open to other ways of organizing.\n Another idea I thought of is to create another level of prefix keys under \"l\" where each key would bring up the keybindings for a given language. So maybe \"SPC l j\" would bring up the javascript menu, and \"SPC l s\" would bring up the scheme menu. This is something I probably could do without too much trouble, but I prefer the first approach.\n Any help appreciated, thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/chillpenguin99  \n [link]   [comments]",

So, I can press Windows + F where-ever and a new firefox window spawns. I want to do the same with emacs, but with new frames rather than emacs instances. (Frames are faster to create, and I have some idle timers that sync directories which would be unnecessarily duplicated when more than one emacs instance is spawned.)\n Is this possible? For reference, my firefox configuration in i3 is simply bindsym $mod+f exec firefox.

I keep this in the same document I maintain my work log. Recently I extracted this functionality into a package to clock in/out, and reports a summary of the last time: as well as accumulating all available times (which I use to show the time worked in a week). Link to the utimeclock repo. Locally I have the mode-line display the accumulated time for the day & week which I quite like. Although this would need some more work to split out from my init file (see this question) since it's piggy backing on which-function. ---- Before creating the package I checked on other time tracking utilities, as far as I can tell they're more verbose, and don't fit so easily into editing a text document which happens to contain a time log.

I only chose company because it seemed to be the most efficient and best choice, however I am doubting that now.\n I'm asking for help here as a last resort to find solutions or personal fixes of all kinds to get simple code completion (including variable names) inside emacs using whatever module is best. What I have in mind is VSCode-like code completion with the drop down menu we can go through, however if there's an alternate kind thats fine as well. Whatever help you have, keep in mind I'm a relative emacs newbie, so if it could be explained simply / explicit config lines that would be most helpful.\n Thanks in advance.\n    submitted by    /u/blueToyCar  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'll start to tinker with it soon-ish, but my elisp knowledge isn't the greatest, so I thought I'd ask here if anybody has ideas where to start. In particular, I have the hunch that child frames can be used to address the lack of snappiness, the empty lines issue and the lack of org-mode integration, but I haven't used them much myself, so perhaps someone with more experience has thoughts about their appropriateness. Also if there are other ideas how to improve editing text tables I'd love to hear them.\n Cheers!\n    submitted by    /u/swhalemwo  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi folks,\n Yesterday, I finished up putting my first custom keyboard together. It comes with a lot of extra keys, a couple of which are bound to 'Hyper' by default. 'Hyper' is a 'modifier' provided by QMK (the firmware that powers this board) that maps to pressing 'Control-Alt-Super-Shift' all together. Because there are no default mappings in the Hyper space, it seems like a good place to put some global Emacs shortcut keys that will absolutely-for-sure not ever get clobbered.\n While it would be easier to bind C-M-s-<foo> instead of H-<foo> and get more or less the same effect, I would like to be able to utilize C-x @ h (event-apply-hyper-modifier) as an option to 'gracefully degrade' on computers where I don't have my keyboard (for example: the Chromebook I occasionally play with Emacs on). That way those global binds can stay available and reasonably within reach. It doesn't seem possible to chain C-x @ mod application functions together, but even if it were possible, chaining 4 of them together would get really old really quickly.\n I would prefer for this to get handled by Emacs instead of getting handled by the OS, just for that extra level of 'don't need to account for some random specific machine configuration', but I'm open to suggestions on what to do there if no good options exist on the Emacs level. My main machine (the one the keyboard lives at) runs mostly Fedora Workstation, and sometimes Windows 10 Pro (though I almost never use Emacs in Windows).\n Thanks, all.\n    submitted by    /u/SoraFirestorm  \n [link]   [comments]",

Using TERM=\"xterm-256color\" changes nothing, and in fact using TERM=\"xterm\" is slightly better (in the sense that it's closer to the original theme).\n I suspect something fishy is happening though, as the real issues set in after I agree to run the Lisp from these themes. For example, let's say I'm running wombat theme but want to switch to taylor. Everything looks fine (or what I consider fine) in wombat, I navigate up to taylor and hit enter, the colors change to something that looks nice but probably isn't Taylor (maybe some previous selection that isn't wombat), but then as soon as I allow the Lisp from Taylor to run, I get an absolutely horrible scheme that is almost unreadable.\n All appears well in GUI Emacs, but I am not interested in using that unfortunately.\n I have also tried other, more esoteric settings for the TERM variable, but to no avail.

I've posted this to r/spacemacs as well, but I thought somebody here also experienced this problem.\n I've been experimenting with Org Agenda recently for my school schedule, birthdays and other TODOs. I saw on the Org layer site that it can have agenda notifications and I thought \"Great, I can have an useful agenda now that can remind me stuff!\"\n But I simply haven't been able to get it working no matter what, this is what I have for my org layer in .spacemacs:\n (org :variables org-enable-github-support t org-enable-reveal-js-support t org-enable-org-journal-support t org-enable-hugo-support t org-enable-sticky-header t org-enable-valign t org-enable-notifications t org-start-notification-daemon-on-startup t) \n Here's my Spacemacs config, if it's required. (also, I'm on the develop branch and it's up to date with HEAD).\n Anyway, if I add this in my agenda:\n * TODO Go for a walk <2021-11-12 08:30> * TODO Go shopping <2021-11-12 11:00> \n I don't receive any notifications for those 10 minutes prior.

I’m a PhD student in Archaeology, and I stumbled upon the world of Zettelkasten while trying to find a better way to make notes at the start of my PhD.\nI’ve jumped around quite a few different tools over the past year but there’s always been something that’s got in the way - apps were either too bloated or complicated or too buggy, or in some cases had awful font rendering.\nMy most recent favourite was iA Writer, and I think I was so attracted to it because I’ve learnt that I want something simple, minimal and distraction free.\nFor me, most options people seem to be using have too many bells and whistles and I want something that just gets out the way and leaves me with my text. iA Writer fit this bill perfectly but I found moving between notes and linking too cumbersome.\nSO I’ve purchased The Archive this week and I absolutely love it! Just as minimal and “clean” but with ease of navigation built in.\nI’m still in the process of getting familiar with The Archive but it seems to do everything I want it to. Before I was using subfolders but I’m thinking that I’m happy to lean in and just put all my notes in a single folder, and use tools like structure notes and other forms of hypertext to maintain connections and groupings where necessary.\nThe only thing I’m currently unsure of is how much to keep in my Zettelkasten. For example, my primary use case is academic writing, but I also want to keep notes relating to more personal topics of interest, e.g. notes about personal development, note taking, language-learning, etc. I’m not sure whether to combine everything or whether to keep my other interests separate.\nAnyways, looking forward to learning more from you all and getting to grips with the method and The Archive in greater depth.

A checklist supports the completion of the physical form of the zettel. A checklist can only provide prompts to complete the knowledge assimilation. This knowledge assimilation comes from contextual deep thinking that focuses on the second-order meanings exposed by the idea in the zettel.\nMy idea of a zettel-making-checklist is that it focuses on the structure, thereby freeing up cognitive cycles so I can focus on the zettel content.

          "description": "I've been working over the last week to read and process for my ZK a particular book.  It contains about 40 short articles by different authors with \"inspirational\" messages and discussions of life experiences.  I created a zettel for each article (these were fairly short, mostly one- or two-idea articles).  After a while, I created a structure note for the book, grouping and linking to each zettel/article.\nSo far, so good - normal use of a structure note.  The little \"aha\" moment came as follows...\nAt the end of each zettel, (because the zettel contained an inspirational idea), I added a \"What will I do?\" question.  I didn't want to just capture the idea, I wanted to see if I could incorporate it into my life in some useful manner.  The \"aha\" thought was to copy that question and its short answer from each zettel and paste that after the reference to the corresponding zettel on the structure note.  That way, I can simply scan down the structure note occasionally to remind myself of what I wanted to do, check my progress, pick out one item on which to focus for a few days, etc.\nSo the structure note became a way of reviewing my follow-up actions.  This is a simple addition that I've made to one structure note, and perhaps in retrospect, it is so evident as to be painfully obvious.  But it both simplifies and enhances the way that I interact with my ZK.  I have previously written zettels about various philosophies (regarding ethical behaviour) and have a few structure notes related to those.  If time permits, I may give them the same treatment.\nAs an aside, I did ask a question about this process before (of acting on ideas we bring into our ZK), which received a few interesting comments.

I use my Zettelkasten for maintaining references that are actually in use but Zotero holds lots of unused and unmaintained references (i.e. not in my ZK), especially webpages that i store offline just in case the source is changed or unavailable.\nIn Zotero it is easy to find duplicates which is the only maintenance i do. Zotero allows creating folders, tags to help with search but i find maintaining two separate systems is too much effort. I also don't worry much about unused references because i don't see them as backlog, they're just collecting dust. But i know there is good stuff in it and occasionally i'd simply like to dig into it and add something interesting to my Zettelkasten.\nI think what would be most helpful to me is a list of unused references sorted by creation date or in general allow communication between both systems for maintenance purpose only.\nIn previous discussions others mentioned that they use \"The Internet Archive\" to store webpages or don't store webpages in their RMS at all and instead paste the URL to the note1.

(the main thing I found was someone's setup for creating journal entries) A lot of new note-taking applications (e.g.: Roam, Craft) have the idea of creating a dedicated note for specific days of the year when you access the application. This allows for easy access to journaling, creating stuff that you'll see on specific days, idea entry that you can sort later, etc. which I personally find to be quite nice. I don't necessarily always have some specific title in mind for something I want to write about, or even links to other things.\nThis seems to be a bit at odds with how The Archive wants to nudge you into adding to your Zettelkasten. And just basically somewhat opposed to the idea of creating atomic notes that are heavily interlinked, since it's more of a scattered \"note\" that might just have thoughts about stuff on a specific day. But I also wouldn't want to give up the ability to link to things in my Zettelkasten (and have stuff in separate locations, because goodness knows I've used a lot of applications and have notes scattered everywhere), or searchability across everything, because I want to write stuff related to specific days. (I have made at least one note in the style of the linked post, using just YYYYmmdd, which maybe just solves the issue but I haven't done much with that idea yet so I'm not sure how it might work out long term)\nDoes anybody have experience working with \"Daily Notes\" in The Archive/Zettelkastens in general?
