          "description": "As a short \"introduction,\" I am a 16 year old student from Canada. I've been programming since I was 12, although it wasn't much until I was 14. I picked up python initially so I could \"show off\" to one of my friends, but I ended up getting hooked on writing C until about halfway through last year, in which I started learning Haskell. I'm firmly convinced that I won't leave Haskell anytime soon, as everything just feels superior to how I was doing stuff before, even if it was harder initially (and still, to a certain extent.) I want to eventually work in I.T, but I'm unsure of the availability of Haskell developer entry positions for once I could actually fathom getting a job working as a developer. I know I'm young and not locked into using any 1 language / stack, but I'm still kind of just wondering what I should consider doing for the future?

I had done this previously using hasql as can be seen here, which is quite ugly but did the trick.\n I can think of three approaches with persistent, one is to do something analogous to what I'm doing above: write the tags, collecting the ids and names in a mapping, do the same with the venues, then stitch all this together when inserting the events. This one I do not know how to do with persistent. The other would be to process the events one at a time, inserting the tags, then fetching them again, doing the same with the venue, and then inserting the event. This one I think I know how to do with persistent. The final one would be to write it all as raw sql and process it that way, which I'm really not fond of as an idea (and haven't looked into).\n Any pointers / help would be much appreciated.\n    submitted by    /u/gtf21  \n [link]   [comments]",

It’s an evaluation of effect systems / design patterns in pure functional languages, from first principles. It operates at the intersection of the academic literature and real world software development. Haskell was the most obvious language for this task, so I used a small program involving four key effects: environment, state, errors and I/O.\n A lot of my time was spent trying to understand the history of the domain and drawing out the most important criteria for working programmers. In the end I settled on: expressiveness, modularity, extensibility, ergonomics and performance. These are the basis for the comparison.\n I don’t expect anyone to have the time to read the whole thing, so this post summarises some of the key take aways: https://www.dantb.dev/posts/dissertation\n I also compiled a list of my favourite resources (there should be a few familiar names from this subreddit… 🙂): https://www.dantb.dev/posts/effects-bibliography\n This evaluation may be useful for people wanting to understand the trade offs involved in selecting tools and techniques in pure functional languages. This was one of my personal goals for the project, as someone who has used pure FP in Scala for several years but never went deep on the theory before. I saw a bit of a gap in the literature regarding the application of these design patterns from the perspective of a software developer, which is what I’m most interested in.\n The structure is broadly chronological and a lot of it is probably old news for experienced Haskellers. With that in mind, I'd highlight Chapter 7 which contrasts extensible effects with the earlier approaches.\n Comments are open 🙂\n Dan\n    submitted by    /u/dantb  \n [link]   [comments]",

Many of the formulas are what you would expect like:\n sin (x:+y) = sin x * cosh y :+ cos x * sinh y \n But the instances make no sense at all:\n instance Monad Complex where a :+ b >>= f = realPart (f a) :+ imagPart (f b) instance Applicative Complex where pure a = a :+ a f :+ g <*> a :+ b = f a :+ g b \n I'm not seeing how the bind definition works at all. f is going to return a real and complex number when applied to both a and b so you are going to have to scramble. Moreover unless f is linear there is no reason to believe that f(a +ib) = f(a) + i*f(b). It would seem to me a much more reasonable assumption would be to use numerical methods and compute a Taylor expansion for real a and then extend to b. That's still highly questionable but at least don't fail for functions as simple as f x = x^2. Similarly the definition for pure makes no sense at all.\n Haskell normally doesn't get obvious math wrong so I'm assuming the fault lies with me.

I think the issue is that it's light. Not just verbose, but lacking in substance. Since it isn't entirely vapid and having paid money for it, I will finish the book. It's just anemic. And the capstone projects are fun.\n Two books which worked well for me are Manning's The Joy of Clojure 2nd Ed. and PragProg's Programming Clojure 3rd Ed. This is of particular significance since at least 90% of the first seven chapters of The Joy of Clojure are redundant with Programming Clojure, which I read first. I feel like I'm getting less from reading Get Programming with Haskell than I did reading content I had already covered in another book. The content just isn't there.\n (Also, it's worth noting that the code examples are kind of crappy. I'm finding myself refactoring this \"expert's\" code because it's ugly and horribly redundant. One thing I like about Haskell is that it's beautiful, with minimal boilerplate, and code I write in Haskell looks great to me. I don't like looking at unsightly code, and his code is mostly that. But for the sake of learning, I can look beyond that.)\n So, with this in mind, what might /r/Haskell recommend as a second Haskell book?\n Edit: I should probably mention (admit?) that I am not a programmer, and if you exclude my Numerical Analysis textbook from grad school, those two Clojure books are the only programming books I've read. I have been programming at some level for decades, but I don't have a typical CompSci background.

          "description": "Recently I've asked myself how much of linear logic can be done in linear Haskell. I'm pretty sure that pure Linear Haskell isn't enough. Let's define:\n type Not a = a %1 -> () \n This is the type of \"obligations for an a\" or \"slots for an a\". I don't think that there's a way to implement Not (Not a) %1 -> a, which is a requirement for linear logic. But looking through the linear-base library I found the following function:\n alloc :: Int -> (DArray a %1 -> ()) %1 -> Vector a \n In other words: \"Give me a way to fill an array with n elements and I'll give you an array with n elements\". This means that alloc 1 is already what we want!!! linear-base (maybe accidentally?) implies all of linear logic. Of course it's a bit cheaty, alloc uses unsafeDupablePerformIO internally, but if the linear-base authors have decided that it's fine I'm okay with it.\n I wrote up some basics of linear logic in Haskell (over here). Using double negation you can implement both of the missing monoidal operations (& and ⅋/Par, the other two already exist: ⊗=(,) ⊕=Either) and interpreting Ur as ! also gives you ?. I've also done some laws including (iso-)mix and both exponential isomorphisms.\n I think it's a bit surprising that it's actually doable. I would have expected that it's either already done or deliberately impossible. But I haven't found anyone talking about doing it, the closest is this library by Edward Kmett which uses some magic to embed linear logic inside of linear Haskell. Unlike this approach I don't think it gives you linear logic for all of LinHask, but only for some types.\n    submitted by    /u/ant-arctica  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi all,\n I was wondering a while ago how Haskell \"decides\" if a given recursive type definition should be given by the least or greatest fixed point. In particular, for a given type equation there are two canonical solutions given by the least and greatest fixed point respectively. But certain types \"feel\" more like one than the other. For example, lists or Peano numerals \"feel\" like least fixed points, whereas streams \"feel\" like greatest fixed points (and in fact the LFP solution is just the empty type, ignoring bottom). So then how does Haskell decide which form to take if the user never specifies?\n So this got me thinking: are Haskell recursive datatypes always given by greatest fixed points? This does seem to make sense mathematically, as for example gfp X. (1 + X) would give the naturals plus a point at infinity, and this translates in Haskell to\n data Nat = Z | S Nat zero = Z one = S Z two = S (S Z) ... inf = S inf \n (i.e. we can implement a term representing an infinite stack of successors)\n So is this actually the case? Does Haskell justify recursive datatypes by greatest fixed points? Or maybe does it not really care about any mathematical justification (i.e. you just get what you get by making a tagged union and putting pointers to the right types)?\n    submitted by    /u/AccomplishedAd3790  \n [link]   [comments]",

Each of those functions can fail, eg if necessary argument is missing, file with wrong extension has been provided, the file doesn't follow the expected format. Based on what I know about haskell, using Maybe type as the return value of the functions seems reasonable to me, Nothing if it fails, Just result if it succeeds. What I'm having trouble with is how to actually utilize this in main. I do something like this\n let proc_args_result = proc_args args if proc_args_result == Nothing then die \"Invalid arguments\" else return() ... -- continue working with processed arguments \n the problem is that if I want to continue working with the processed arguments, I still have the Maybe value instead of the actual value of the result. Alternative is using\n case proc_args args of { Nothing -> die ... Just value -> ... -- continue here } \n but that will lead to uncontrollable indentation\n    submitted by    /u/grandoz039  \n [link]   [comments]",

Or is Haskell not (/no longer) a serious option for 3D graphics? In particular, is the OpenGL library a viable option today, or is it no longer worth looking into?\n Here's some of what I have found so far:\n  \nThe wiki page about Graphics. Unless I am mistaken, the last 3D-related edits on that page are more than 10 years old.\n The OpenGL page on the wiki. Here again the information seems to be a little dated.\n  \nThe exception (to the things I've found being old) is h-raylib, Haskell bindings to the Raylib library.

It hitched a ride to Mars on the Perseverance rover. The Mars Helicopter has, since its launch, completed 47 flights (and counting!). Credits: NASA/JPL-Caltech.

Anyways - under the above assumption I dived in with a real use-case but hit a few hurdles that probably mean I have a total misunderstanding and would appreciate any guidance!\n Heres a small, and yes very dumb example, but hopefully gets at my core misunderstanding - where I am not sure that I can recover the composition of these Arrows. Say we have these Arrows:\n ``` -- Adds 1 to the input plus1 :: Arrow a => a Int Int plus1 = arr $ (+ 1)\n -- Adds 2 to the input plus2 :: Arrow a => a Int Int plus2 = arr $ (+ 2)\n -- A program defined through a composition of arrows program :: Arrow a => a Int Int program = plus1 >>> plus1 >>> plus1 ```\n I'd like to be able to inspect the program, and reason able its structure. For example I may want to find paired compositions of plus1 and replace them with plus2 instead as a sort of optimization, e.g. plus2 >>> plus1.\n Using this very simple example to get a better understanding - is this possible?\n    submitted by    /u/tomwells80  \n [link]   [comments]",

Should they be tested regardless (e.g., because there is no guarantee from the outside that we used deriving to create them, so their implementation may be incorrect)?\n What about if A is defined using GADTs, some other extensions, or contains some constraints? Are there any circumstances under which a datatype definition and instances of standard classes generated via derivation may fail and should be tested?\n Note that I'm not talking about cases where the type is accompanied by user-written functions. In such cases, yes, the functions may be part of the abstract datatype's API and thus must be tested. I'm talking about the datatype definition itself, the constructors, record fields, and instances generated by GHC.\n    submitted by    /u/ivanpd  \n [link]   [comments]",

I’m completely fine with GHCi, I need an IDE where I can “navigate to declaration” to learn quicker. I know VScode has, but unfortunately it doesn’t work for external ones, even Base.hs, IO.hs, etc. IntelliJ idea Haskell plug-in seems buggy, because when I add even one dependency (aeson), it starts complaining about versions and “navigate do declaration” stops working. It seems it somehow tied to lts-18. I tried 8.10.7, but still complains. 2. I’m completely fine with all types of monads, types, and type classes, I learnt about massive compile optimization when I use foldr, main question is how to distinguish tail recursion and non-tail. 3. Where do we store all the libraries. I found Hoogle. Is there only one place, 4. Which libraries we do use for - formatting - linting - other “good things” 5. Do we have kind of “recommended” resources to pass through in order not to ask dumb questions? 6. Do we have kind of stack of libraries which we use in all apps, like in Scala: - cats - cats-effects - fs2 streaming - circe (json) - http4s (http) - postgres, dynamo libraries - etc. 7. Forums, blog posts to follow 8. Other staff I need to know/learn. 9. Is difference between 8 and 9 such big as between Scala 2 and 3. 10.

I want to create small programs that I can compile and run. So many guides and courses seem to rely to heavily on GHCI in my opinion. I understand many people learn this way, but what is the point if I don't know how to actually create a project?\n For instance, I'm trying to follow along with \"Learn You a Haskell\", but quickly got discouraged with all of the GHCI use. I tried to create a Haskell project in VS Code, but I'm not even sure what should go in main!\n I learned other languages effectively because I was able to create bite-sized projects and experiment. I just feel very limited by the approach that functional programming language guides take.\n So my questions:\n  \nHow did you guys learn to actually create, structure, and execute projects? Am I just doing a bad job at looking for this information? Like I said, I'm able to create a main.hs file, but am a bit stuck on what goes after \"main = \" lol.\n Is there a reason so many guides stick with REPL? I've seen this from many FP languages. I've been wanting to learn an FP language but I keep bouncing around because I keep running into this problem. How are people learning these languages without knowing how to set up projects? I just don't feel like that should be an afterthought!\n  \nSorry to rant a bit, just am confused as to why this is the case. Maybe I just learn differently than others, but I find slapping things in the REPL to be a very ineffective way of actually understanding the concepts.

I am a CS student and do code in several different languages, as part of learning, haven't done any project or industry work and I have very very weak grasp at maths (fine with relation and functions in maths now). I just started reading learn you a haskell for great good since yesterday. I don't get what 5 /= 5 means, 5/5 := 1 then why its says False? Haskell has module but not classes at all, right? Some important concepts to make a solid grasp on? I'm just curious about haskell and because it's so different and bla bla bla. But where are actually its applications because I'm desiring to become a future haskell dev these days, please give me big solid reasons to stick to it. \n Please be kind.

I worked on it for five years, and extracting a small part of it to a separate library was one of the nicest and most productive tasks I remember from those days :)\n I released Signals3 1.0.0 two months ago. It was a direct rewrite of the old version from Scala 2.11 to Scala 3 (hence the name). The whole thing is an implementation of the observer pattern and in Wire, it helped a lot to connect different parts of the app, made it react quickly to events, and made the code pretty and readable.\n Say, you sent a request to t…",

When I execute the code as-is with the extra bits commented out, I get a nice Scala array which I can call individual columns using println(s\"${flightData(1)}\"), but when I uncomment the extra code the output becomes a mess, I think due to the Array format being from java. I get the output [Ljava.lang.String;@35f983a6.\n My question is, is it possible to export the outputArr without converting it to a java format, so I can keep the legibility and pass it through to other functions? and if not, how can I format the gibberish output into something usable?\n    submitted by    /u/PikaXeD  \n [link]   [comments]",

Nowadays, if I ask it \"Why do sharks eat elephant eggs\" it doesn't tell me that sharks rarely get a chance to do so cause elephant eggs are so large and on land, but rather that elephants do not lay eggs.\n Today I decided to test it by asking how one would use Scala 3 macros to get the types of the inputs and outputs of a method. It had some decent suggestions to do that for someone that is new to macros, but a lot of its answer was false, suggesting people use something called QuotesContext, not recognizing properly what extension methods are available for the Symbol type, and worst of all, trying to splice Type values into an Expr.\n If they can manage to get chatgpt to actually tell the truth consistently (like saying \"I don't know how to do that\" rather than just lying) I think it will be a nice resource for discovering how to do stuff you don't currently know how to do.

I found it an interesting exercise ... and got some help from this forum earlier - thanks to those people.\n - It's entirely scala CLI. \n The scala-cli part was remarkably quick to get all the of the project boilerplate in place, publish out of CI etc. Even better - it cross compiled (super easily), and it cross platform tests really easily! And has different tests and capabilities for the JVM etc. I think these parts of scala-cli might still be subject to change... but it was amazingly easy / fast to get all of the \"project grind\" in place. \n Ultimately, there wasn't really a barrier, or a reason _not_ to (cross-)publish it - even something this small - and I think that's kind of fun :-).\n    submitted by    /u/quafadas  \n [link]   [comments]",

Having essentially used them for a rather long time, they have proven to be very useful to me and I wanted to share them with you.\n I did not want to write here when I published them, to try and fix any bugs or problems that would arise by their new bundled form, but they seem to be working properly so... here they are:\n  \nKLP is a general package, focusing solely on making the consistent naming as easy as possible, with a note_category_title.org, template. This allows for arbitrary categories to be easily defined, built and search through. Some use cases for it would be cheatsheet files, easily accessible notes on cli tools ... generally static notes.\n Org-lectures. Now this one, even though it shares quite a lot of elements with KLP (it was developed almost simultaneously) allows for the easy creation and management of courses and lectures files. By assigning a couple of keybindings and complementing it with a package like CDLatex or Yasnippets, a really fun workflow was created that allows me to take (in real time) lecture notes for my university courses.\n  \nFeel free to try them!\n P.S. My experience in writing packages is limited, so any feedback would be more than welcome (this is the reason why I decided to post here after all, :P).

This is very dynamic - I might want to suddenly have another column in the table (or remove it, or resize it), to add more information, or to not have something clutter the view.\n So far, it seems the agenda is very \"set in stone\", and I am going to be unable to do things on-the-fly. Only possible to spend time preparing a view, then use and re-use it.\n Is orgmode really this unflexible?\n    submitted by    /u/financier1337  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello\n I am using org-mode and org-attach via doom emacs. Whenever I have made notes and tried to attach something using either org-download-screenshot or org-download-clipboard, by default the heading has an \"ATTACH\" tag signifying that there is an attachment in this heading. Example shown below.\n ​\n https://preview.redd.it/dcx9pfdb9esa1.png?width=744&format=png&auto=webp&s=4b453b1d160882ee09624e84c5598ec222c5f3ec\n Now when I try to export this to GFM using pandoc, this is what it does\n ​\n https://preview.redd.it/2keyfcri9esa1.png?width=1110&format=png&auto=webp&s=57aa82093888ea635644fcedc5be3eaf376f21f4\n Essentially it exports the ATTACH tag out. I have a couple of questions.\n  \nWhat's the purpose behind the \"ATTACH\" tag? The reason I ask this is because I can easily set org-attach-auto-tag to nil and this tag is not attached and therefore not exported. But does it have other consequences that I might not be aware of. Reading the documentation, it doesn't appear so, but I am then left to wonder why this would be the default behavior.\n Is there a way to keep the org-attach-auto-tag to the default value of \"ATTACH\" but not have it exported. I tried setting the EXPORT_EXCLUDE_TAGS to ATTACH but then of course the whole content doesn't get exported.\n  \nThanks for your help.\n    submitted by    /u/CautiousCartoonist  \n [link]   [comments]",

An unfortunate mechanism that can't be turned off saves over your file with re-done spacing -- blank lines are added between headlines automatically, which isn't Org specification nor everyone's style. This clogs git, if you're using version control, with changes that are just whitespace. One may notice a toggle to turn off adding blank lines between headlines, but that just means turning blank lines off entirely, forgetting ones that you may have added. Fundamentally, as of now, Orgzly's parser doesn't try to remember the blank lines in your notes that you may have added with purpose.\n Metanote A newcomer, but it has stayed proprietary.\n  \nI have more hopes about are full-fledged Emacs with termux or Emacs on F-Droid.

I have been able to get everything working fine when it comes to LaTeX exports, but I would ideally like to also export to HTML.\n In many fields of mathematics it is common for papers to follow number conventions along these lines:\n 1. Section one Theorem 1.1. <equation here> (1.2) Corollary 1.3 2. Section two Lemma 2.1. \n In LaTeX I would typically achieve this behaviour by using the amsthm package, putting this in my preamble:\n \\usepackage{amsthm} \\numberwithin{equation}{section} \\newtheorem{theorem}[equation]{Theorem} \\newtheorem{corollary}[equation]{Corollary} \\newtheorem{lemma}[equation]{Lemma} \n Then LaTeX to produce the outline at the start of this post would look something like this:\n \\section{Section one} \\begin{theorem} <theorem here> \\end{theorem} \\begin{equation} <equation here> \\end{equation} \\begin{corollary} <corollary here> \\end{corollary} \\section{Section two} \\begin{lemma} <lemma here> \\end{lemma} \n This means that in org mode I can just add a few lines to my LaTeX preamble with header options and then just write:\n * Section one #+begin_theorem <theorem here> #+end_theorem #+begin_equation <equation here> #+end_equation #+begin_corollary <corollary here> #+end_corollary * Section two #+begin_lemma <lemma here> #+end_lemma \n However, I've been struggling to figure out how to replicate any of this functionality for the html export.

          "description": "Hi, newbie here. I am using Emacs and in particular Org mode for almost a month now. \n I have some tex document that I want to copy-paste to canvas, but it is a bit of a pain because I need to change say $\\tan (x)$ to \\(\\tan (x) \\) and what I do is a bit silly and tedious doing it one by one, and that might be the only way to do it, but I was wondering if there was a quicker way to do it? \n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/AncientOccasion4998  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I have been using emacs for several months at this point. A few months into it, people started talking about using straight.el instead of package.el, so I moved my configuration over to using straight.el. However, now people are saying package.el is the best option and that people should not really use straight.el anymore. I have had good experience with straight.el since some packages I like are not on melpa. Additionally, I have tried downloading and using emacs-29, and it seems to run into issues when using straight which makes me lean more towards using package.el unless there is some way to fix this. Which package manager should I use, and why (I have also heard about elpaca which seems to have nice UI and fixes some issues that straight has, so what about that versus straight and use-package)?\n    submitted by    /u/Far-Anywhere2876  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "This has been an issue for a while, and I hope someone can tell me what's really going on. I use transient-mark-mode and normally it works great. But once in a while it gets \"wedged\", where the region doesn't deactivate properly after something that should deactivate it. As a concrete example, if I mark a region and hit delete, the region is removed, but not deactivated. So if I move the point, it expands the region again, leaving the mark where it was. And if I just start typing, I only get the last letter, as each letter replaces the previous. The only way I've found to fix this is to exit emacs and restart it.\n Ideally, I'd like to figure out what setting gets \"bumped\" that makes this happen, and prevent it. Failing that, a way to correct it short of not using TMM would be nice. In the worst case, knowing what triggers it so I can maybe avoid it would be better than where I am now.\n    submitted by    /u/perkinslr  \n [link]   [comments]",

The issue is there for some packages and for some not. For example orderless functions have no such issue and the doc points to orderless.el as expected. php-mode is fine. Magit has the issue. \n Have you noticed anything like that in your setup? Is it native-comp related? Is there any way to guide Emacs so it knows where definitions are?

But for some reason it just points to wrong file. \n Just for some additional info: - I'm on MacOS - I use emacs-plus@29 compiled with brew - I use use-package with straight\n Any idea on how to solve it is highly appreciated.

Fine, but I also decided to use the vertico package.

I thought that by omit the helm line in the config scope and by changing (setq rtags-display-result-backend 'helm) to vertico would workout with my configuration, but it failed.\n So my question is: is it possible to combine vertico and rtags to work simultaneously?\n    submitted by    /u/jjaneto  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Emacs 29 has got new startup options: --init-directory. Here is how you can use it (for those daredevils who build their own Emacs, until 29 is finalized):\n In your shell, clone those repo(s) you would like to test:\n git clone https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs git clone https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude git clone https://github.com/jkitchin/scimax \n You can now run your Emacs from command line in respective directory:\n emacs --init-directory=~/spacemacs& emacs --init-directory=~/prelude& emacs --init-directory=~/scimax& \n Easy. \n I actually never tried anyone's setup before, but always had on my to-do to actually try those (+ Doom, but Doom seems to require slightly more fiddling). As a small review: Spacemacs and Prelude worked out of the box without any issues. Scimax is a bit older, and for some reason, it choked a bit during the installation. I had to press C-g once or twice to get it going. Also, every time Emacs starts, it is chewing on something until I press C-g. I haven't investigated on what. But other than that, despite all the warnings during the package installation, it seems to work quite well. I am impressed with the amount of polish and integration all three has done. I can certainly recommend any, especially Scimax for those of you who are doing lots of org, org-babel and who write scientific articles and reports. Spacemacs seems to be the most polished of them the three, visually and technically, while Scimax seems to be actually most useful, especially if you are an academic.\n If you are new to Emacs and learning, it is not worth spending hours chasing packages and configuring stuff. Install Emacs, and you can be going solidly in less than five minutes with any of those three. Probably Doom to, but can't be just cloned and auto-installed via provided init.el as those three guys.\n    submitted by    /u/arthurno1  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I've been using embark for some months now, I like it, I like the concept, the way it works, and it's already part of my workflow in a number of tasks. On the other hand I also find it somewhat overwhelming. The keymaps are very large, and comprise numerous tasks which could potentially be performed through Embark. As a result, unless the binding is already part of muscle memory, having to resort to the embark-verbose-indicator is a time consuming step, because the list is so long it feels like finding a binding in C-h m. True, C-h offers completion, but at this point I'm already wondering if it wouldn't have been faster doing the task without using Embark.\n So, it works very well for bindings I know by heart. Which are a few. For others, I can't help but feel I'd prefer to have less alternatives. Thus, I'm considering adopting a \"bottom-up\" approach to Embark. The idea would be drastically reducing the available Embark bindings, and then adding the ones for which I feel the need. The question is: is there a \"proper\" way to go about this? I don't think nuking embark-keymap-alist to just a few maps is the way to go, since the keymaps put the bindings in the proper context. But, on the other hand, going around disabling each binding seems tedious. So, any advice on this?\n    submitted by    /u/gusbrs  \n [link]   [comments]",

Now, I'd love the planner system to not show the Advanced Calculus until I complete all its prerequisites. But when I do complete all its prerequisites, I want it to automatically show the Advanced Calculus goal.\n Is this pre-provided by org-agenda? If not, could someone please suggest what modifications I might need to do in order to enable this?\n org-enforce-todo-dependencies seems relevant, but this seems to assume that one task's completion may only enable at most one other task (its parent), while I can imagine that there can be one-to-many such links.\n    submitted by    /u/digikar  \n [link]   [comments]",

Looking back, I have switched notebooks/editors 6 times in the past ~15 years for various reasons, either because I switched OS or the old tool could no longer satisfy my needs; it's just not sustainable and migrating contents ended up being a headache every time.\n It's only been a week, but so far, I like to think that I have found a forever home with Emacs.\n Here are some questions I have. I looked through some of the old threads but couldn't find the answer I need. Any relevant info is appreciated.\n  \nWhat are some suggested options for syncing Org-mode files across different OS platforms, preferably E2E encrypted? One combination appears to be file sync client + Cryptomator, though unsure if that'd prove to be problematic in the long term.\n \nHow do people keep their configs consistent across platforms (also backing them up)? Let's say that I carry around a Linux-powered laptop, but at home I switch between Windows and macOS for different purposes; each of them may have slightly different configs that correspond to the platform.\n \nIs there a built-in cheatsheet of sort, or a toggle reference tool that can be customized, for a beginner to use as a reference while learning common keystrokes and commands? I have been killing by searching with apropos and then yanking to a separate org file; it works, just somewhat clunky. (Love the terminology, by the way.)\n \nI plan to be using Emacs for academic purposes as well ­ drafting papers, processing data with scripts, so on and so forth.

I tried those, and also with local-set-key, but no bliss.\n For the sake of concreteness, here is one actual case I'm trying to have one such binding: I'd like to bind ' in the minibuffer for find-file and related commands which takes me to consult-find at the current location. So I have: \n (defun gb/consult-find-for-minibuffer () \"Search file with find, enter the result in the minibuffer.\" (interactive) (let ((dir (file-name-directory (minibuffer-contents))) (file (file-name-nondirectory (minibuffer-contents)))) (gb/minibuffer-quit-and-run (funcall-interactively 'consult-find dir file)))) ;; http://oremacs.com/2015/07/16/callback-quit/ ;; But this version comes from Ivy. (defmacro gb/minibuffer-quit-and-run (&rest body) \"Quit the minibuffer and run BODY afterwards.\" (declare (indent 0)) `(progn (put 'quit 'error-message \"\") (run-at-time nil nil (lambda () (put 'quit 'error-message \"Quit\") (with-demoted-errors \"Error: %S\" ,@body))) (abort-recursive-edit))) \n I currently bind this with:\n (define-key minibuffer-local-map (kbd \"'\") `(menu-item \"\" gb/consult-find-for-minibuffer :filter ,(lambda (cmd) (when (memq current-minibuffer-command '(find-file find-file-other-window find-file-other-frame project-find-file)) cmd)))) \n But I find this procedure somewhat clumsy, and would prefer to use vertico-multiform for that.\n So, is there a general procedure to use vertico-multiform to make a keybinding on the minibuffer-local-map for specific commands?\n    submitted by    /u/gusbrs  \n [link]   [comments]",

I think it was to to with the plain text and almost complete lack of graphical interest. I just started feeling really flat emotionally. Like the screen I was looking at was utterly uninteresting.\n So I went back to windows for a while, using VS Code, a graphical git client and so on and strangely there I felt the opposite, like the graphical density with so much on the screen was almost overwhelming after months without all that graphical clutter. That faded over a week or two and I found myself adding a few non-Emacs apps with more graphical elements alongside Emacs to mix things up.\n This was quite strange, I learned to program using VT terminals and actually worked in places where my daily computer was a vax system with a VT terminal and never felt anything like this.\n I'm not intending this as a slight against Emacs, but I found it was interesting that my brain just started to shut down a little due to the lack of stimulating stuff on the screen. I was wondering if anyone else has had a similar experience? I know some of you guys pretty much live in Emacs 24/7, do you find it overwhelming to use a very graphical application after that?

          "description": "So I was just going through my older journal entries and found the following entry: \n  \nI do not think that AI is the right choice for a lot of our things if the underlying problem of freeing humans always remains. It makes more sense to me to be a part of a group where the focus is on freeing our time through removal of shackling of our time than to build AIs that feed the capitalist to extract more wealth from underpaying humans and from keeping them subjugated to 8 hour work days no matter how advanced the AI is. Eventually, the AI is going to be a prime worker for the capitalist than for the betterment of humanity. \n I refuse to be a part of this process and that is why I am choosing not to get into those domains in any which way. \n Emacs therefore remains my stronghold that I would like to curate and build my freedom from. If one cannot free themselves from 8 hour senselessness, then they can build stuff to free up time and work from home and do other more productive and happiness, mental peace bringing things. Productive here means that doing what I really want to do and doing it rather than producing as much value for the capitalist who would rather discard me if there was a more productive person or an AI.\n  \nThis reminded me about one of the prime reasons why I wanted to use Emacs - it's extensibility that enabled me to build shortcuts and workflows that help me with shaving off sufficient amount of time which I spent on repetitive tasks. The trick however is to not to be vocal about your efficiency to your bosses because the time saved will be used against you to staff you with more work whether you want it or not. \n Go use the time saved to spend with your loved ones, yourself, exercise, learn something, do nothing or even just calm and rest. It's your reclaimed time. \n Who else does this?\n    submitted by    /u/shaggy_amreeki  \n [link]   [comments]",

Jinx provides the jinx-correct command to correct the nearest misspelling via completion or all misspellings in the whole buffer if invoked with a prefix argument.\n For performance reasons Jinx directly binds to the libenchant native library and lazily checks only the visible portion of the current buffer. Libenchant provides backends like Hunspell and Nuspell which also power the spell checking in word processors or browsers.\n I am interested in your feedback. The package is still young, so expect some rough edges.

For example, while pcomplete opens a new window for completion it does not switch to it automatically and it does not escape the spaces. This means that every time I have to add quotes myself or escape the spaces manually. I would also like pcomplete to be like orderless and vertico and allow me to select entries the same way.\n I am now using corfu with eshell and it is a bit less frustrating but it is still not smooth as much as zsh completion system is. For example, I have to press escape otherwise I cannot stop the corfu autocompletions once it is activated.\n So my questions are:\n ​\n  \nIs there a way to make pcomplete escape spaces and special characters when completing in eshell? Ideally I should not have to switch to the pcomplete window but it should be done automatically.\n Is there a way to use vertico and orderless, rather than pcomplete, or even in tandem with pcomplete?

          "description": "Hello,\n I am kinda posing a question in the form of a package here: basically, what’s the most efficient way to bind keys? It’s one of those questions I had neglected to ask for so long that I’m a little afraid to ask now, cuz keyboard macros are kind of a core feature to Emacs. Anyway, here's what I wrote:\n https://github.com/Overdr0ne/skey\n I felt like there was a missing define-keys function, so I tried to provide it in this package. Rather than writing:\n  (define-key some-map (kbd \"x\") #'my-func) (define-key some-other-map (kbd \"x\") #'my-func) (define-key some-map (kbd \"y\") #'my-other-func) (define-key some-other-map (kbd \"y\") #'my-other-func) etc...  skey lets you write:  (skey-define-keys '(some-map some-other-map) '((\"x\" my-func) (\"y\" my-other-func) etc...)) \n As of this writing, skey is 9 lines of code in one function. Is there already a standard way to do this? Is everyone just using raw define-key, maybe in a loop? general? use-package’s :bind? Reinventing your own key definers? I explain more in the readme some of the ways I bind keys, but I was just curious how other people are doing things.\n Suggestions for additional features to this package are welcome, but I would be just as happy to learn that there’s a simple, standard way to do what this package does. Maybe add lazy loading by default or something? I dunno, this is kind of a weird post lol...\n    submitted by    /u/SamTheComputerSlayer  \n [link]   [comments]",

The default tab styling and workflow for Tab Bar mode is not ideal for me, and I couldn't really get Eyebrowse mode to not freak out keybinding wise no matter what I did.\n With this in mind, going forward and ignoring the two above, I'm wondering, is there something similar to like 'i3' window manager, but within Emacs itself?\n Looking for something similar where it has like 5 window options where you can just swap between them on the fly, etc. Plus something that could save those buffers for later use would be great.\n ​\n Not sure if I qualify as someone who should just learn Projectile or something though since I have a few web dev projects I swap out to sometimes. I usually have Treemacs on the left pane with code being edited in Emacs on the right. I also need a separate screen for two split vterm terminals, and a separate screen for an org mode buffer notes pane.

I think Emacs is very well suited for this new text-based smart-ish assistant tech interface-wise (much more so than VS Code). \n There are some \"open-source\" alternatives for the open-AI generative LLMs there, like LLAMA https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp trained and leaked by Meta, and made available in c++ and actually runnable even on a MacBook Air. Sure it's not as great as Codex, GPT-4 and such, but it's a start (there are also open datasets with lots of code https://huggingface.co/datasets/bigcode/the-stack, so maybe in the future the gap will close). \n Maybe we should work on something like this? \n ​\n Very interested in what the community thinks about this in general.\n    submitted by    /u/_puhsu  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi, silly question:\n I'm hoping to use Doom emacs with agda-mode, but when I do there are some features that just don't work. For instance, in vanilla agda-mode, if I wanted to to type unicode symbols such as $$\\Sigma$$, I would be able to via by beginning the slash. However this does not work in Doom. However, here i have to type C-x 8 RET GREEK CAPITAL LETTER SIGMA, which is pretty inconvenient. This issue does not go away when turning evil mode off\n Additionally when in evil mode there are some agda-mode keybinds beginning with C-u that I really wish could work. I'm not sure what they get remapped to, if anything. \n Thank you for any help in understanding this. I'm very new to emacs (need to use it because the vscode agda extension is buggy), and I'm partial to doom. So I really hope I can find a way to make this all work\n    submitted by    /u/winniethezoo  \n [link]   [comments]",

The currently available packages either don't work at all (most of them for some reason), or lag, or are quirky, or all at the same time.\n My goal is to try to make something like vim-smoothie in emacs. I want to make this scroll line by line, instead of by pixel with pixel-scroll-mode because that just makes it laggy, and not smooth at all.\n So, here's the basic idea. When you call one of the scroll functions, of which there are four (page up/down and half page up/down) they calculate how many lines you'll need to scroll for. They generate a number, positive or negative depending on the direction. This number is then passed to a function that will …",

My function works well enough, but it's a bit slow, taking usually about 1.2 seconds. I ran the emacs profiler on my function and found that the majority of the time was spent on calls to org-table-align invoked by org-table-move-column and org-table-export. In my case, those calls to org-table-align are unnecessary. Since neither org-table-move-column nor org-table-export provide an option to not invoke org-table-align, I made my own modified versions of those function that just comment out the calls to org-table-align. By doing this, my function now runs in 0.2 seconds, a 6x speedup!\n While the speedup is nice, I would prefer to not have my own modified version…",

          "description": "Hi all,\n I love Edwina mode, but I'm suspicious that it's interferes somehow with the process of opening links to external buffers.\n When I try to open a link to a specific part of an org-file, using org-open-at-point for instance, it opens the file correctly, but then fails to jump to the right header etc. The same happens when, for instance, I open a link contained in a help buffer to view a function; it opens the correct file but fails to jump to the right part of the code.\n The reason I suspect Edwina mode is because when I switch it off everything works fine again. So it seems that somehow Edwina is interfering with this process.\n Has anyone else had this problem? I'm trying to look into it but I'm new to elisp and I'm not sure exactly where ti begin\n Thanks for any ideas,\n Mike\n    submitted by    /u/carvakatavacchedaka  \n [link]   [comments]",

In addition it makes some configuration recommendations that you might also find useful.\n Efficiency With The Mark Ring (EP 2):\n Discusses the differences between global and local marks. It also explains when and how marks are added to these mark rings.

          "description": "I'm new to emacs, and I've learned the basics, installed some packages, and configured it to my liking the last 2 weeks or so. I'm using the basic emacs keybindings (no evil).\n One thing that has repeatedly caused me some headaches, is custom keybindings, either for functionality of packages that don't provide their own keybindings, or for custom functions. For instance,\n  \nI want to configure a binding for consult-line (searches for occurrences, lists them in consult, allows to jump to match), something I'm probably going to use frequently. So I go for `C-c slash` , vaguely inspired by vim, which I've used for a while in the past.\n I try it in my config file and it works.\n I want to use it in org mode and realize it's already bound to something else there. Shit.\n  \nHow to best avoid this \"in advance\", such that it's unlikely to happen in the future, even if I install more packages or use more modes? I guess letting my own commands start with `C-c` is a bad idea.\n I thought about starting all custom commands with something else, like `C-some_key...` where `C-some_key` kind of works as something like a personal leader key. But when I use the same leader/prefix key for all personal keybindings, no matter what they do, I feel this breaks the logic of the seperation that we have with `C-x` vs `C-c` for instance. Whereas using multiple such preface keys seems to escalate keybindings and memorization efforts.\n Also using C might be difficult, as C-something is already bound to a bunch of stuff (eg `C-v` for scrolling). What else would be a good option? How are experienced people handling their personal keybindings?\n EDIT made: clarified that the binding I was trying to use was C-c slash-key, somehow it only displayed C-c, which made it confusing\n    submitted by    /u/throw_ag  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi, I would like to build an Emacs configuration from scratch. I know there are some alternatives out there such as Prelude, Purcell's Emacs.d, and Crafted Emacs but I would like to build my own.\n By modular configuration I mean a configuration in which things are split up in separate files. For example:\n ;; in the main init file: (require 'php) (require 'javascript) (require 'dired) \n If I don't want to use Emacs to code in a certain language I can just comment out the require statement.\n I've noticed that people who built modular configurations did not rely on use-package and they just used the built-in features.\n I was wondering if it's possible to build a modular configuration using use-package? I guess use-package is just a macro and what it does it groups things together. Right?\n I think what I need to do is to just put all those use-package chunks into separate files? For example, all dired related stuff into a dired.el file:\n (use-package dired :ensure nil :after all-the-icons-dired :bind (\"C-x C-j\" . dired-jump) :hook (dired-mode . all-the-icons-dired-mode) :custom (dired-auto-revert-buffer t) (dired-listing-switches \"-agho --group-directories-first\")) (use-package dired-narrow :after dired :bind (:map dired-mode-map (\"/\" . dired-narrow))) (use-package dired-subtree :after dired :bind (:map dired-mode-map (\"<backtab>\" . dired-subtree-cycle) (\"<tab>\" . dired-subtree-toggle))) (use-package all-the-icons-dired :after all-the-icons) \n and PHP related stuff in php.el, so on.. even if the use-package stuff is just 3 lines of code in that file (I may add more stuff in that file in the future).\n I can go with a programming.el that contains all languages but I think having a separate file for each language is better because I can disable and enable the languages I want easier in main.el.\n Please share your thought about this. I would be grateful for any suggestion.\n    submitted by    /u/zoliky  \n [link]   [comments]",

Huge codebase.\n Development happens on Windows 10 per company policy. I think I can survive the hostile OS with some mix of git bash/msys2/wsl2. Most devs are apparently happy to use some proprietary commercial ide, some vscode, some qtcreator, some vim on the build server.\n I'd like to give emacs at least a try but I've grown accustomed to use either lsp-mode or more recently eglot with clangd backend. It usually works flawlessly with locally buildable smallish projects and sane build systems (be it autotools, cmake, meson, never really had an issue). \n Problems I foresee:\n  \ngenerate compile_commands.json: hope I'll be able to install bear on the build server and that bear will actually work\n separate dev environment and build server: could I maybe generate compile_commands.json in the linux build server and copy it and have it working on the windows dev machine? \n emacs on windows, native or wsl2? in the latter case cmdline or with some xserver, which one? I just need a few packages, vertico, consult, marginalia, etc. Org-mode would be nice. I think I could live without magit, but that would be sad.\n  \nDo I have any chance to keep my usual workflow? should I give vscode a try and live happy(ish)?\n Is there maybe a dumber setup for code completions and symbol look up that doesn't rely on clangd?\n    submitted by    /u/fightinforlostcauses  \n [link]   [comments]",

Value-giving properties include: Accuracy/Completeness, Reliability, and Usefulness.\nAn evaluation of thinking would look like this:1\nsymb.\n  designation\n  comment\n\n\n\n\n  !!\n  Brilliant\n  Best idea, not easy to find\n\n\n  !\n  Great\n  Thought changes the course of the debate\n\n\n  \n  Best move\n  Theoretically best thought\n\n\n  Excellent\n  Almost as good as best thought\n  \n\n\n  Good\n  All right\n  \n\n\n  …",

          "description": "How has your week been? What are your plans for the coming week? Tell us about the state of you zettelkasting journey.\nMy week has been busy with medical issues that prevented me from making many new notes. I feel good now. \nI got my first two essays back from the professor in my food writing class, and I feel good about them. I am of a different generation than everyone else in the class, including the instructor. There are a couple of writers in the class that seem to be able to write a first draft of a 'writing prompt exercise' that is far more polished than my 'shitty first drafts'. They are modeling a skill that I aspire to.\nWhile journaling this morning, I found a gem in an entry from one year ago today. It's very meta, and this is all very circular.\n\n  \nZettelkasting and journaling are like workouts. You have a busy day ahead. Why journal? Journaling is not just another task. At first, you stumble with form.  Like when you are a beginner at weight training, you struggle with repeatedly getting to the gym. You think it will help your physical health, but at first, you feel sore, tight, and tired, not at all the pinnacle of health. Eventually, if you stick with it, you might find a coach that helps with form, you might set up your environment so going to the gym feels natural, you might start to feel strength building, and you've started progressing on the climb to physical health.\nAll these weight training actions can be applied to zettelkasting and journaling. They train your mental health in the same way exercise trains your physical health. It's a slow process at first. You can't see the improvements day to day or even week to week. Improvement only comes with consistency.\n\n\nI think I'll move this gem from my journal to my ZK. I have a couple of relevant notes on the mental health benefits of journaling.\n\nMy seven day zettel production",

          "description": "Hi,  newbie here.  I'm not overly confident or comfortable with notion, have seen hypernotes that seems easier for me, however I've been using Notion for a while.  I like notion as I can directly link out to a google doc.  I've sort of constructed the page to use notion and files embedded as if it were scrivener.  I digress.  I am writing a phd.  I do a lot of literature reviews etc.\nMy question here is there really much value in having a tool that presents a map of notes as per obsidian.  If I build my zettelkasten in notion which is basically a relational database is this not sufficient.  I do really want to concentrate on writing.  As notion supports my writing very well the idea of having the zettel database in the same tool is appealing to me.\nAny thoughts please?\nthank you Zoe",

          "description": "A \"morgue file\" is a collection of notes, articles, and files kept by investigators or journalists for possible future use. Today, I have developed a morgue file that in my zettelkasten that collects items that I think might provide fodder for my fiction writing.\nI write speculative fiction and so I track newspaper articles or reports that I think might serve as the germ of a story. Then, as part of my writing process, I'll make a new (structure) note and include links to articles or pieces that might inspire pieces of my story (whether character, setting, or plot).\nFor example, I recently learned about Point Nemo, a \"spacecraft cemetery\" in the Pacific Ocean that is a \"pole of inaccessibility,\" the location farthest from any land. This was intriguing enough, so I did some more cursory reading and learned (among other things) that it is also a remarkably lifeless part of the ocean because it is so far from land. Also, in spite of not being officially identified as the \"pole of inaccessibility\" until 1992, Point Nemo is near where H.P. Lovecraft placed R'lyeh, the lost city where Cthulhu is imprisoned!\nAt any rate, I now have a cluster of notes about Point Nemo that is forming the gensis of a story about scavengers trying to salvage material in this remote location. The real-life details are helping me flesh out the skeleton of a plot and raising more questions for me to explore. (For example, I know next to nothing about what might be involved in this salvage operation, so I now have some more reading to do!)\nI thought I'd share in case others are interested in using their zettelkasten to generate ideas for fiction, and to learn from others who might implement a similar practice. Do you have any other tips or advice? Pitfalls to avoid?",
