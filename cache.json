          "description": "Hi,\n I'm fairly new to Haskell and am struggling with how to ensure type safety of my domain model. I'm modelling \"Weather Station\", which currently looks as follows:\n ```haskell data MeasurementType = Rain | Humidity | Pressure | Temperature | WindStrength | WindAngle | GustStrength | GustAngle\n data Measurement = MeasuredRain (Meter :/ Hour) | MeasuredHumidity (Double) | MeasuredPressure (Pascal) | MeasuredTemperature (Kelvin) | MeasuredWindStrength (Meter :/ Hour) | MeasuredWindAngle (Degree) | MeasuredGustStrength (Meter :/ Hour) | MeasuredGustAngle (Degree) \n data TimeSeries = TimeSeries { measuredProperty:: MeasurementType, values:: Map UTCTime Measurement }\n data Sensor a = Sensor { identifier :: a, supportedMeasurements :: [Core.MeasurementType] }\n -- each sensor supports different measurement types, ideally it should also be type checked type GetMeasurements a = Sensor a -> TimeRange -> NonEmpty MeasurementType -> IO [TimeSeries] ```\n What I would like to achieve is to ensure TimeSeries measuredProperty match Measurement type. That is, it shouldn't compile when one tries to create time serie of type Rain while putting e.g. MeasuredWindAngle inside.\n The measuredProperty is needed to group time series and e.g. compute an average from each serie type. That is, separate average for Humidity, Rain etc..\n Basically, each weather sensor will return many different measurements, where the measurements can be duplicated among different sensors. Therefore, I'd like to combine all measurements into a single list, group by type and then aggregate.\n Moreover, each sensor has a different set of supported measurements. Ideally, this should be reflected in the type system as well. That is, one shouldn't be able to ask for Pressure where the given sensor only supports [Temperature, Humidity].\n Anyone can give me any clues on how to achieve this?\n    submitted by    /u/onliner10  \n [link]   [comments]",

The amount of work required for the lectures prevented me from diving deeper into any language than what was required, but they all seemed to be decent with their individual benefits and drawbacks.\n But then came Haskell, it felt like an enlightenment.

And the specific reason I'm asking about this is that notarizing GHC for Macs is currently on the to-do list.\n Notarization is part of Apple's fight against malware. Codesigning is another. I am still learning how they work and what the consequences are.\n Does the lack of a notarized installable affect you? (Example of missing notarization here.) If so, how? It helps to be specific: Did you get started with GHCUp? Stack? Something else?\n What other pain points exist when you (or your students/classmates/colleagues/bosses) get set up to work with Haskell? What's the biggest pain point?\n I'll have access to a Mac soon, but I don't want to base my effort on one data point. :)\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/chreekat  \n [link]   [comments]",

If there was a convention to be made for writing C bindings, this is the obvious default. Kudos for defining new Bool/Int/Float types, it's refreshing to remember Prelude is a module like any other one;\n Probably saves a few thousand characters per library, plus makes Haddock easier on the eyes;\n  \nReasons to keep prefixes:\n  \nOpenGLRaw did it first and it still holds the gl prefix, same with gl;\n No need to explicitly qualify imports;\n Names stay at 1:1 to the API reference, if one exists;\n  \nThere obviously is no one true answer to this question, I'm merely looking for the public opinion on this.

It is a \"piece of circuit\" that can be joined or not, but the ways in which the join can be activated are constrained, so this is not actually join. Circuits are compiled. Do HOFs compile to \"piece of circuit\" guarded by switches?\n How would one model a concurrent list comprehension (dynamic cardinality) in a circuit? This should be possible with applicative because the continuation is pre-fabbed and reused, though here we need multiple instances of it. Can a circuit do this or do you need to print the continuation C times to the board, thus constraining the list cardinality by amount of \"memory\" on the board? Is this the essence of applicative – you do not know how much memory you will need?\n Can we encode dynamism into the frequency domain? A single physical circuit on the board, and multiple input signals multiplexed through the circuit simultaneously?\n    submitted by    /u/dustingetz  \n [link]   [comments]",

Once complete, it compiles and functions more or less as expected. I could spot the head would likely give trouble on empty lists (which it did) and that groupBy could produce some strange groupings, but wild to see the skeleton of a decent sort function produced so easily.

The compiler cannot know whether you intended this -- while it increases time complexity it may reduce space complexity. Thus it will not float the definition out from under the binding of x.\n In contrast, in the first function, fib' can be moved to the top level by the compiler. The where clause hid this structure and made the application to x look like a plain eta expansion, which it is not. \n  \nI cannot really understand how the compiler optimized the first definition of the function and not the second, apparently the redefinition of the function has an impact on time complexity.\n I know that a big part of FP optimization comes to know how to dance with the compiler, it's patterns and to lay stuff out for it to make \"better\".

Then I want to sum the scores. I first did this with a sum and a map, but then realized I could do it in a single fold. Code like this:\n main :: IO () main = do contents <- readFile \"input02t\" let input = lines contents -- This takes ~2 seconds to run print $ sum $ map (score . readEntry) input -- Same answer, but this takes ~10 seconds to run print $ foldr ((+) . score . readEntry) 0 input \n The time difference shocked me, because I expected equivalence.

I found lots of good advice in this blog post, and several others by the same author. (I tried to put it to work in my own code, restricting the domain of a finicky function, which felt like a nice, if small, win.)\n Anyway, I feel like I'm still only scratching the surface. Reading posts like this or the \"types\" section in the \"State of the Haskell ecosystem\" gets me really excited, but doesn't leave me with much in the way of practical advice.\n Are there are good/recommended resources for digging deeper into this kind of stuff? I stumbled across Thinking with Types today, which seems like it could be a good fit. I also see there's a chapter on \"Basic Type Level Programming\" in Production Haskell. I've also found various blogs and reddit posts, of course, but nothing super-comprehensive. (And \"Type-driven development\" sounds cool, but I'm not ready to branch into Idris yet.)\n I'd love any recommendations, pointers, tips-and-tricks... whatever you've got to offer! Thanks!\n ​\n \\Any feedback is welcome, by the way, if anybody feels like digging through beginner code. It feels weird to work/learn in a vacuum. Looking at it now I already see some deficiencies, but I'm sure there are plenty that I don't see...*\n    submitted by    /u/spaceispotent  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I'm a bit confused on monadState type class and don't really know where to start to understand them. When talking about an example like:\n function1 :: monadState Int m => String -> m String \n I know that String would be the input and that m String is supposed to be the output, but how would that be formatted? Also, does the monadState Int m have any interference with the input string? To further the example, if funtion1 were to be a function where it counts words in a string and returns the string with the count, would be as simple as having the format as something like:\n funtion1 s = s ++ m \n or is there some monad stuff to worry about? Obviously somewhere in function1 would be the actual code to count the words in the string. Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/Usual-Area-280  \n [link]   [comments]",

My (very hacky) solution right now involves stripping the `Forall` constructor, splitting the bare function, then comparing the two types on their type constructors (in this case, `Identity`).\n I'm wondering if there's a better way to go about this, because I'm having trouble extending my current solution to broader applications.

Why is this the case, that errors are not handled with `Either`? Also, how can I handle these errors?

It's fairly basic at the moment but I've already migrated a couple of projects to it, and it really is nice to have. Positive points:\n  \nYou have one source of truth regarding the supported compiler versions for your projects: your cabal file. \n No codegen is involved! You do not have to occasionally re-generate your CI file, which means that you can keep all the peculiarities and weird hacks you used to have. This tool only concerns itself with providing a list of OS and GHC versions. Some of which you can still exclude in the action file.\n  \nCoincidentally (or not), the next release of Flora will bring this stanza to the forefront (see associated announcement).\n Since the idea is to really be intertwined with the Haskell Github Action, the list of supported compiler is shared between this tool, the setup action and Flora.\n My thanks to David Christiansen for the idea of the CLI tool. The idea for it is to both disappear inside the future cabal status command, and that it becomes part of the official Haskell actions.\n    submitted by    /u/TechnoEmpress  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm successfully hosting multiple websites with SSL on this VPS, including an application built with Scotty.\n The app is basically just an editor in which you can write programs in a DSL I implemented. When you press \"Run\", the contents of the editor is sent to the backend as a POST request, and the program is evaluated server-side. The server then responds with the result.\n The problem arises in the fact that the DSL in question allows for infinite loops. Thus, when the backend evaluates the given program, it might not terminate. When this happens, the app is down for at least a minute seconds and the process consumes ~100% of the CPU on the server.\n Is there a reliable way (in my current Linux/Docker/Scotty stack) to automatically kill the process if it runs for more than, say, 8 seconds?\n What I've tried so far:\n  \nSetting a timeout of 8 seconds using scottyOpts\n Defining a health check in the Dockerfile that runs every 30 seconds\n  \nThe health check helps in the sense that it automatically restarts the container if the service does not respond, but this still yields significant downtime.\n Let me know if the post does not fit the sub.\n Cheers!\n    submitted by    /u/biografmeddem  \n [link]   [comments]",

The obvious thing to do is find out what types round is dealing with, i.e., round :: (RealFrac a, Integral b) => a -> b , and then assume it doesn't work to try to divide the outcome of round by a integer. And don't be fooled when the naked literals, e.g., 844.666 / 100 do work, since it's really fromRational 844.666/fromInteger 100. Which is not what (round $ num * f) / f is giving us. So round results in an Integral, (round 844.666 :: Integral b => b) , which needs to be passed to fromIntegral. But now I'm confused. Integral is a class. Can someone explain exactly what's going on here?\n    submitted by    /u/teilchen010  \n [link]   [comments]",

It was a painful and long debate; I didn't post anything immediately after, but now that I think about it the debate eventually boiled down to, as I called it,\n A BROKEN PACKAGE IS BETTER THAN AN INSECURE PACKAGE. \n If Haskell cannot manage to (at least pretend to) successfully update a dynamic library dependency without recompilation and/or large-scale ad-hoc per-package manual patching and/or 100x performance penalty due to uneliminated indirection, then it's Haskell's fault for doing so. Packages in other languages can get broken by security patches as well; it's just that they often (at least pretend to) work and Haskell breaks too often.\n I never realized that security patches are his first and foremost concern since he never seemed to have expressed that explicitly regarding this issue.

In addition most stages require IO to pull some data needed for the actual validation.

          "description": "To make this clear upfront: I want to ask the following questions out of genuine curiosity. Because while in theory the concept sounds awesome, I don't get the way it was implemented. And I was already close to filing a bug report for this issue that then turned out to be \"intended behavior\".\n  \nThe other day I ran into the situation that I had two type aliases that both mapped to Lists of something. Then I wanted to implement an extension method on both of these types with the same signature.  type A = List[Int] type B = List[String] extension (a: A) { def doSomething: Unit = ??? } extension (b: B) { def doSomething: Unit = ??? }  But the compiler refused to do that because of the methods being identical after type erasure. Okay, I get that.\n But before I proceed with the core story here,…",

          "description": "If you're wondering why, well, just to reduce my dependency cone and possibly build times. No deeper reasons.\n Replaced sbt-assembly with sbt-native-packager's dist command to build a zip file. Unzipped that. Then added the resulting directory into my Docker image. The image now has everything needed to run the app, no fat JAR required.\n Replacing sbt-buildinfo was slightly trickier. I decided to roll the replacement by hand and 'sacrifice' a couple of things that sbt-buildinfo provides. Let's cover all of them:\n  \nname: I can just hard-code the project name, it's not like it's going to change all the time\n version: just need to plug in the output of git describe here\n scalaVersion: do I really need this info in my health page? Not really. I can just look up the version, pull up my repo, and figure out the Scala version there\n sbtVersion: same argument, I don't really need this in my app's health page\n buildTime: just need to plug in the output of date -u -Iseconds here (e.g. 2022-11-25T03:11:49+00:00)\n startTime: bonus, sbt-buildinfo doesn't provide this but it's trivial to add, just run val startTime = java.time.Instant.now.toString eagerly when the app starts up.\n  \nOK, so above in a couple of places I mention plugging in the output of shell commands, how to do that? Pretty simple. In the project code we just have a file like this committed in the repo:\n // Info.scala package build object Info { val name = \"my-app-name\" val version = \"TBD\" val buildTime = \"TBD\" val startTime = java.time.Instant.now.toString } \n And at build time we just replace this file with a generated one:\n # build.sh printf ' package build object Info { val name = \"my-app-name\" val version = \"%s\" val buildTime = \"%s\" val startTime = java.time.Instant.now.toString } ' \"$(git describe)\" \"$(date -u -Iseconds)\" sbt test dist unzip target/.../my-app-name.zip \n Yes, that's printf in Unix shell.

It has nothing to do with Elon Musk's takeover, actually, as I've been feeling like this for some time, drastically limiting its use. For me, Twitter is like that family dinner where the conversation is monopolized by your uncle's political views, and you're compelled to listen, just because he has a strong voice, he's family and can't tell him to shut up.\n You can choose to stay on Twitter, who knows, I might return in the future, too 🤷‍♂️ but right now it's no longer a healthy environment for a programming community. It's due to all the noise, as outrage generates attention, and outrage is encouraged by Twitter's features. Even when speaking of programming, I don't want inflammatory tweets in my feed, from some ignorant fool, advising Elon to rewrite the whole thing in Go, alongside all the reactions to it. And I'm sure that many Twitter users can agree that engagement has gone off a cliff lately for anything that's not related to politics.\n Some of us are trying out Mastodon. As a full disclosure, out of my Twitter followers, I could find about 4% of them on Mastodon, so around 200 people, some of them inactive. But for me that's enough, plus I found interesting people from other adjacent communities.\n Mastodon may prove to be counterproductive, too, as it's another social network, and maybe there's something wrong with social networks in general. But I like that it has that original web 1.0 vibe to it, and that it is “federated”, like email. Maybe you'd like to try it out, too.\n  \nI added some notes on how to migrate from Twitter, maybe you'll find it useful:\n alexn.org/wiki/mastodon/\n This is not a call to arms 🙂 it's just a suggestion, as I'd love to see more of you there.\n Cheers 🤗\n    submitted by    /u/alexelcu  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I was playing with Scala, trying to see if I like it and if I am willing to invest more time into it. I would like to use the cfor macro from Spire in a numerical code snippet where performance is important, but how should I do it? The canonical way seems to be to add the library to the build.sbt file, but here I am not writing a full project, I am just playing with the REPL to get a taste of the language, so there is no build.sbt file. Surely there must be some easier way to use libraries, right?\n (And, in general, if one just wants to have fun solving problems from \"Project Euler\", so just writing code snippets in the REPL, or in some light text editor and then compiling them, how does one do it? It seems that the first steps in the Scala world must be Coursier, SBT, Maven etc., which makes things very professional and kills all the geekish fun. Is there a way to avoid them?

          "description": "Hello dear Scala community !\n I have a very dumb ( or not, I am not sure ) question.\n Recently at work we kinda started a debate on how to handle errors in our applications : we use tapir + http4s and cats-effect's IO everywhere and current urrent practice is to throw everything in the IO's error channel and eventually catch it somewhere upstream. \n But by switching to mainly using http4s clients to sttp clients to communi6between our services we often find our business logic kinda sandwiched between a source of data producing IO[Either[E,A]] and an API description which expects the same.\n Lifting everything into the IO error channel to caste it again into the same input shape seems to be a waste of information and effort, while also not getting any help from the compiler to handle those errors. This kinda leads me to lean toward using EitherTs....which is metwith some resistance as it does tend to add some complexity to the code.\n In this context I found out about this wonderful article https://guillaumebogard.dev/posts/functional-error-handling/ which seemed to reflect exactly my own...erm...reflexions. After reading it, I thought I found the perfect middle ground ! Put errors not in the output type of your functions, but give it the capability to fail thru MonadError from cats and Raise from cats-mtl. Maybe lift everything into a neat context function type an bam everyone is happy.\n I started experimenting. Everything was very neat and tidy until....and here comes my dumb question....where do I get MonadError and Raise instances for IO ? Is there another lib ?\n I found tofu which seems to cover pretty much anything I need but they don't publish for scala 3. Do I have to rewrite both for the IO monad ?\n    submitted by    /u/WiIzaaa  \n [link]   [comments]",

I tag each with their respective tag, that way I can filter by customer in org-agenda.\n After marking DONE, I archive the task/projects to a single archive2022.org file. My main objective for maintaining an archive is for generating clocktables and analyze time spent with each customer, which task/projects took me the most time, etc., and eventually bill that time.\n For some comments I read in reddit, it seems that some users apply some zettlekasten-oriented packages for task management (ex: org-roam).

          "description": "Hello, I'm using the \"olivetti\" package with a line width of 80 characters (olivetti-body-width 80). The text is centered. This setting works fine for a fixed-pitch font. However, when I'm using a variable-pitch font such as Times New Roman, the 80 characters per line allow up to 100 characters per line to fit. This is due to the nature of variable-pitch fonts where characters are not equal in width like monospaced fonts.\n 100 characters per line is too long for optimal reading and increasing the font size doesn't help. The font is already at a large size. \n What would be the solution? To reduce the olivetti 80 characters per line setting to 70 characters per line which will compensate for the variable pitch font? But that will cause the programming modes that use a fixed-pitch font to have short lines.\n    submitted by    /u/zoliky  \n [link]   [comments]",

I did a very manual setup on my work pc which uses windows (i'm not a dev yet so stuck with windows at my current marketing job). \n The problem is as I make new strides on my home config I cannot easily mirror the setup at work. On top of that I am also working on going all-in on org mode across my devices. I can figure out the org file syncing with syncthing no problem but as I develop my org setup I don't want to be having disparate versions of my config. \n Are there any guides or walkthroughs on this type of thing? I know I\"ll probably need to figure several things out based on my specific setup but figure there might be something out there like resolving moving between the ~/ and C:/ locations and any other issues I might not realize I'd run into.\n    submitted by    /u/timmymayes  \n [link]   [comments]",

As you can probably tell from the preview command I'm on an M1 OSX system and straight as my package manager. This block works in my other config, so unsure if it's related to the fact nano uses fixed width in the main text (whereas I had variable pitch in my other config... or some other factor.

Without having to use a hot-rodded version, I was looking for some info on a few basic customization tips that almost anyone new to emacs would want to do. For example, I figured out how to change fonts, window size and basic foreground/background colors and put those commands into my \"init.el\" file, so now it looks better (and is more usable for me).\n It would be nice to figure out how to make Emacs use the mouse for basic cut and paste from the clipboard. also, if you are in the command line, it would be great if the up-arrow key would give you command history (is that possible ?). Is there a list somewhere of the top \"5\" things a new emacs user would want to do to make Emacs more useful/friendly out of the box ? ... and how to do it ?\n    submitted by    /u/964racer  \n [link]   [comments]",

What is the workaround for this?\n \nThe intellisense messages on the right side of the screen are often truncated due to a lack of space on my screen. How can I view the entire message when this is the case? Surely there's a better way than just flycheck-list-errors since I have to actually visually search where in the list the error/warning corresponding to my current line is. Add further to this fact the ID columns on that interface is often truncated\n \n https://preview.redd.it/vg876qu8055a1.png?width=943&format=png&auto=webp&s=38676201480eb5e8cad654d87ee999683e9bbc10\n (And tangentially related: why does flycheck-list-errors provide a different error list than consult-lsp-diagnostics? I have an example of this which I can produce upon demand.)\n ​\n  \nWhen LSP shows some information about what I'm typing in the minibuffer, how can I choose to view that information in full? See the image below. You can even see the \"1/3\" page label. How do I access those pages? If I press ESC so I can press K, pressing ESC gets rid of the message in the minibuffer and then attempting to press K will simply yield LSP :: No content at point.\n  \n​\n https://preview.redd.it/q1e8so0c055a1.png?width=629&format=png&auto=webp&s=6a0b2cc1d971ae4bba8c30af8f29834e897d17b6\n  \nnext-error / flycheck-next-error does not let you navigate to warnings (despite warnings appearing in the flycheck 'error' list).

Strangely, other keys like M-S-Arrow etc seem to work fine.\n Does anyone know what I've done here or have an idea of what I need to do to restore the default date picking behaviour?

Then it inserts \\cref{...} with a proper string.\n This works but ideally though I would have a proper list of macros available from Cleveref: \\cref{}, \\Cref{}, \\namecref{}, \\pagecref{} etc. on top of regular macros.\n Does anyone have or know about a working solution?\n    submitted by    /u/FranekW  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello,\n I'm new to emacs and I built v28.2 on my Pop! OS Linux instance. I'm trying to get my init file to work to set the initial window (frame) size.\n I've created an init.el file in my .emacs.d folder in home (i.e., ~/.emacs.d/init.el), but it doesn't seem to be executed.\n When I start emacs, it looks like this:\n Figure 1. Initial Emacs Window (roughly 900x900)\n What I want is for it to look like this:\n Figure 2. Resized Emacs Window (roughly 2500x1100)\n But it always starts out as Figure 1 and the only way to get it to Figure 2 is if I open my init.el (right-click in Nautilus and select emacs).\n And here is a third view showing my .emacs.d (shown by C-x C-f of ~/.emacs.d), the contents of the init.el file and the value of my user-emacs-directory (which is ~/.emacs.d/):\n Figure 3. .emacs.d folder, init.el file, and user-emacs-directory variable value.\n I've also tried renaming the init.el file as .emacs and putting it my home folder with the same result.\n What am I missing here?\n EDIT: responses based on replies:\n  \nuser-init-file shows \"~/.emacs\", which, as noted above, I tried along with .emacs.d/init.el without success\n When normally opening emacs, my/set-initial-frame is not defined. If I open the .emacs file from Nautilus, it opens the frame correctly and my/set-initial-frame is defined. If I rename the .emacs file to \"foo\" and open that from Nautilus, it doesn't set the frame and my/set-initial-frame is not defined.\n No errors in *Messages* buffer\n There is no emacs folder in .config\n initial-frame-alist is always 'nil' (when it works and when it doesn't)\n Not sure if I'm running emacs server, but server-mode variable is 'nil'\n  \nNote the original .emacs content I found here.\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/phlepper  \n [link]   [comments]",

When I type fast, I would have to wait a few seconds for the letters to appear one by one.\n When I shrink down the size of the GUI frame, Emacs becomes very snappy and responsive. I have noticed a positive correlation between Emacs lag and the size of the frame -- this is the weirdest thing I've come across since I started using Emacs years ago. Running no configuration with `emacs -q` is the same thing -- significant latency when the frame is big.\n Has anyone been faced with this issue?

I can manually change all of the text but I've done that a few times and tried a few things now and I don't know what I need to do to replace the \\225, \\247, type characters that come over from whatever windows type character they are.\n Also, I am on Windows 10, using emacs 28.2 and doom-emacs.\n Attached are screenshots of what it looks like and what buffer output I get trying to convert all this.\n https://preview.redd.it/cnue745lmp4a1.png?width=1125&format=png&auto=webp&s=d80f3a9dfa392eb9b628816954a9c645c6b5ed4a\n ​\n https://preview.redd.it/yg41ea4nmp4a1.png?width=677&format=png&auto=webp&s=fb29213e71abc376f6cdc011d83f025437e02b15\n ​\n https://preview.redd.it/tjojzg1omp4a1.png?width=789&format=png&auto=webp&s=c84948856e8981dfccea67991aa3456f62dfb57c\n    submitted by    /u/tritoneparadox5  \n [link]   [comments]",

Any time I'm editing an org mode file my cursor will automatically \"suck back\" to the last text on the screen. For example, I type a sentence, finish with a period then hit space twice to start the new sentence. If I don't type something immediately (like less than a second) the cursor is pulled back to the period, removing the space(s).\n Needless to say it's rather annoying behavior. It's 100% consistent and what I gave was just an example, it's happening in any scenario...using spaces or tabs, happening in lists, etc.\n This is Doom Emacs and I'm running this in 28.1 on Void Linux but it was there in 27.x as well.\n Let me know if there any more info I can provide and TIA for your help.\n    submitted by    /u/RipKord42  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "As a newcomer here I just wanted to share my point of view for the community and any maintainers. Emacs has already expanded my mind and I'm beginning to grok the power of having a Lisp system at my fingertips. Now I can get through the more research-intensive install (on macOS at least) to find the best build and install flags. And I can get through learning and customizing any historical quirks of software going on 50 years strong..\n But one big obstacle to me, which isn't customizable, is that the cursor is always in view. Even in the GUI there is this trait which makes it feel like a terminal application (which it did start as). It fundamentally changes how one selects and navigates text (select text, scroll back up and select region disappears). In a world where every other GUI app doesn't behave this way, it is a big change. It feels like a constraint. This will force me deeper into keyboard centric navigation which is fine. I just think cursor flexibility should not be overlooked and for younger people who are switching from other editors and have used the mouse their whole lives, I can see it hurting adoption.\n This is probably very hard to implement, going against how it has always worked, but I think that would be good to at least have an option to let cursor scroll off screen. Let me know what you think. Kinda related: does anyone know of a package that makes the select region wrap around words instead of going edge to edge on screen?\n    submitted by    /u/amasunbey  \n [link]   [comments]",

I could probably still use it, but for permanence I decided to switch to Emacs since I'm extremely picky with my editors. \n To be honest, the first time I tried it I was disappointed how hard it was do something simple as save a file, copy/paste and whatnot. However, the \"steep learning curve\" everyone talks about is just a matter of having a nanosecond of patience. Then speed comes later. What I love about the keybindings is it confines all of my work to the keyboard and the bindings are ergonomic if you also use the right Ctrl and shift keys. My workflow is honestly magnitudes better, being able to jump at lightning speed, completely neglecting arrow keys and the mouse. Also, for the first time ever, I am using all ten fingers to type. \n The question: I've set up a theme which I like, auto pairing brackets, indent and auto-complete. Curious if there's a way to get linting support? i.e. underlining missing semicolons, typos. \n Also, can I integrate a terminal into emacs as well?

I'm thinking I may have to read up on org-agenda. \n I keep a personal journal, and at this point, it's almost a thousand small markdown files no larger than 4k - one for (almost) each day. I refer to each one just simply by linking to the <date>.md and then make my journal entry there. \n On the upside, I can check what I did this day a year, two year, etc ago by doing \"ls *-12-06.md\".. but on the other hand, it's really inefficient. \n I was wondering if it would be more efficient to make an org file for each year and then have header lines for each day, plus additional ones for each topic underneath.

It is not even registered as a keypress: 'C-h c <tab>' just ignores the <tab> keypress. C-i is recognized as a tab press, and in the terminal things seem to work normally.\n I am on Monterey 12.5, emacsplus@28, using a doom config. I tried to find help online but so far was unsuccessful. I have disabled mission control key bindings, including the use of tab to shift focus, but it still seems to happen. Did somebody solve a similar problem? Does it have to do with the shell from which the emacs GUI is started? It might also be something basic about macOs, with which I am completely inexperienced. Thank you for any ideas how to find out what is happening.\n ​\n ​\n https://preview.redd.it/4noo0sr2q54a1.png?width=1346&format=png&auto=webp&s=e3ab47d203bc1fc86a87e99833feb9cb62c4d694\n    submitted by    /u/un_dude  \n [link]   [comments]",

I don't have cable and don't watch much TV outside those times) and I like to track what I've already watched. I had one set-up in Obsidian, but one thing I didn't like was the lack of portability (Dataview can only be read within Obsidian).

          "description": "I’ve been tinkering with lisps of some form since I had to learn racket a few years back in uni and have felt stuck at the point of just starting to feel comfortable with the language(s). I’ll do some advent of code problems in a lisp and things seem to go well but as soon as I get stuck it feels impossible to find a solution that makes any sense. In terms of elisp I’ll write simple functions but when digging into plug-in source code feel like there is no amount of study that could make me competent in the language. Is this just the start of the valley of imposter syndrome where you know enough to know what you’re ignorant about or the inability to make the paradigm shift to thinking in a “lispy / function” way? Not meaning to rant just curious how people broke through this barrier if anyone has felt the same.\n    submitted by    /u/Doomer1999  \n [link]   [comments]",

Few folks pointed me in the right direction so I started working on this at https://codeberg.org/sochotnicky/age-mode\n The package is... experimental. There are a few known bugs (and many unknown I am sure). But things work in happy-path scenarios when you have correct identities defined and whatnot.\n I mostly copied over things from EPA package and adjusted for GPG->age differences (fortunately age is much simpler to work with). So when things are set up right you can get transparent age file decryption on file open and encryption on save. There's a few other accessory functions as well.\n Package needs some refactoring, more documentation, better error handling, support for different ways to specify recipients/identities, figuring out why editing over TRAMP saves unencrypted files and more. If someone feels like helping out I'd be happy to accept patches :-)\n I haven't really done that much elisp coding, but I've enjoyed the process so far.

As a vimmer interested in emacs due to the vast customization capabilities and especially org-mode, I looked into trying it out for myself. It seemed as though the easiest way to get an idea of the potential of emacs was to install doom. I used the official guides on the repo and tried out both emacs-mac and emacs-plus with native comp. On my M1 macbook pro I experienced major cursor lag (when navigating through text files using vim bindings), they were so severe especially after coming from vim that i ended up removing doom entirely. Vanilla emacs didnt feel a 100% smooth either. Whats even weirder is that weeks after uninstalling emacs itself my computer still had a process running called emacs with 99% cpu useage and high gpu useage. After doing some digging, it seems that there are rendering issues on retina displays specifically that really mess up the responsiveness of the app. I read about different things to try such as using fira code as the font, changing the line highlighting behavior etc.\n ​\n Anyways, Before trying to fix something that seemed broken I want to try to install another build again, and I'd also be comfortable with vanilla emacs and configuring it on my own if it means stable performance. So what I want to know specifically is the following:\n In your opinion what are reliable distros and build options out of the following distros for M1 on a retina display in terms of responsiveness and light cpu/gpu useage?\n - emacs-mac\n - emacs-plus\n - emacsformacosx\n and would you ppl suggest with native comp or without?\n    submitted by    /u/drax19  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Tweaking emacs with satisfication is not easy, but I am trying to think how it would work efficiently. The problem of the naive emacs keybindings is that it over relies on the ctrl key, default layout of modern computer keyboard makes it effort-some to do navigation. In my opinion, the alt (or meta) key should be paid more attention as we can balance between those two kinds.\n The first thing I found is that using arrow keys to navigate is fine, but not efficient, as its up and down arrow is not so coherent, and most of times we need rely on the thumb to hit the keys separately. While ctrl-n and ctrl-p can be an alternative to move around between lines, the same as alt-n and alt-p, for which I would suggest that using it as forward-paragraph and backward-paragraph. It can be smoother as oppose to the ctrl-<down> and ctrl-<up>, in the mean time, you can utilize the other combinations such as alt-f, alt-b to move forward word or backward. In that sense, alt key becomes a bold version of ctrl key, since it jumps fast and corresponds to every navigation key that ctrl has. We can therefore switch between those two modifier keys to move in a small pace or in a larger pace without intervening the arrow keys. At the same time, we can assign more combinations to the prefix key alt-s corresponding the ctrl-x. If we can stay mostly at the left region, the keystroke would be more efficient. If we can utilize those two kinds to the best, we can balance the left and right region, such as buffer navigation uses right hand-side alt-[ and alt-], and buffer switch uses alt-\\.\n I also want to listen to your suggestions, as I believe everyone has their own opinions and configurations to make a balance, not be overloaded, while be efficient.\n Edit: I have remapped caps to ctrl.\n    submitted by    /u/OutOfCharm  \n [link]   [comments]",

I question Vim's perceived efficiency with its keybindings and modal workflow but know it is universally available and quick to load.\n Testing Emacs for the first time opened my eyes and challenged what I thought I ever knew about it. The wealth of its built-in package manager with repos and extensibility is incredible. I thought it was all terminal focused but found out about the GUI and that a large majority of the community is using it. Now I am comfortable in the terminal but far from elite and have never tried a full terminal workflow. I'd like to hear from professional programmers and admins. What is your preferred choice?\n I want to know and grok the possibilities of using an editor inside a terminal, do you have more functionality, are you able to pipe things easier, etc. I know the benefits of the GUI in graphics and keybindings but is there feature loss or pain points when using something like vterm. Emacs is very flexible and there is many, many ways to complete work.\n In your opinion, should a person that wants to be the best programmer and admin possible focus on using GUI or Terminal Emacs?

I have spent around 3 months with Doom Emacs now and in that time I also started following along system crafters videos to build my own config but I have to say that unfortunately, I'm a person that switches often between a lot of different languages and platforms and tools. \n e.g. While I'm working as a freelancer in RJSX I also develop blender plugins and I'm also learning unreal engine 5 and WebGL on the side.\n For someone like me, I was finding that I'd have to spend 3-4 days dedicatedly crafting an environment for every new requirement I have. I do a lot of different minor development-related things and this was really killing my will to work. \n But, emacs did force me to learn evil mode for editing and I have to say I'd always use that till the day I die now. I cannot imagine how I didn't. I also added a magit plugin and an org mode plugin on vscode and also using the vspacecode plugin for spacemacs like keybindings now. \n My affair with emacs would definitely continue for a long time, I'm sure. But unfortunately, the barrier of entry is rather high for someone like me who wants to do a lot of things and honestly for the time being I'd have to hop back to VSCode to edit a lot of different things. I am a little disappointed but still hopeful that I'd be back some time.\n    submitted by    /u/_analysis230_  \n [link]   [comments]",

I don't get the usual autocompletion, the errors listed by flycheck all appear in the first in the first lines and don't get removed if i correct the acutal error, ....\n And this only happens in the very first file which started the server ! On top of that I've also noticed that it only happens when I have more than one listed lsp workspace folder using pyright.\n My current workaround is to kill the buffer and reopen the file again but it would beetter if I could get rid of it entirely.\n I use doom emacs with pyright and lsp and I also use pyenv for my virtualenvs with the pyenv package which allows emacs to automatically detect the local version I set for a project and use it. \n It's very weird and I have a hard time finding the root of the problem so if someone had a similar issue at some point or as any clue on what to do it would be very much appreciated !\n    submitted by    /u/TheHentaiSama  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I'm looking for a way to pin packages to specific commits in straight.el and I came across this answer here on reddit - https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/iyzs29/is_there_a_way_to_pin_a_package_to_a_specific/g6frovq/ with this example.\n (use-package diminish :demand :straight (diminish :host github :repo \"myrjola/diminish.el\" :tag \"v0.45\")) \n but according to the answer this:\n  \nBut I think this only applies to the initial checkout, and the real way is to run straight-freeze-versions, which creates a lockfile. Then straight-thaw-versions applies whatever versions are in there to the package repos.\n  \nI think I also saw a :ref option in an answer here on reddit but I can't find the either the :ref and :tag option in the straight README. There is a :branch option though and that is the one I want to stick to, but it may not be safe if changes or some fixes which I may not want are backported to it.\n My idea then is to clone the repo I want, create a branch from the commit hash I want and point straight to it. If I don't make any changes to it than that \"branch\" will be good with straight forever, and I should be able to use the :fork option if I want to retain a reference to the original configuration.\n Is this cloning and creating an unchanging branch a good idea? I have read about the lockfiles but at this stage it is all a bit much for me. I want something I can wrap my head around for now and get to the advanced stuff later.\n For instance I want to stick to org 9.3.8 in one of my profiles. Can I set the :branch to release_9.3.8?\n    submitted by    /u/vfclists  \n [link]   [comments]",

But if I'm opening a file, I just want it to jump straight to the file and not waste time showing the dashboard.\n It seems that there is a pretty trivial solution in cases when Emacs is invoked from the command line: just check if there are command-line arguments that look like files, and make Emacs behave accordingly.\n However, I want Emacs to behave this way even when I invoke it from the GUI: when I double-click on a file, or select 'Open with Emacs'.\n I've done some snooping around the startup code, and it looks like in the latter case, the file that we're about to open does not show up as a command-line argument, so the above solution doesn't work. Yet there must be a way for Emacs to know that it needs to open a file (otherwise it'd just open normally and not immediately display the file in a buffer). So what can I check to know if Emacs was called in this way?\n    submitted by    /u/andyjda  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hey all, using doom emacs on a mac, and projectile automatically lists /~ as a project. I'm not sure how this happened, as I don't have a .git directory in home or anything. I wouldn't mind so much, but if I accidentally select that directory as a project emacs hangs so badly that I have to reboot the machine. For some reason I can never find the process ID for emacs for osx to kill -9 it so I have to do a forced reboot with the power button.\n Anyone know a workaround for this? I could just be careful not to select ~ as a project but I'd rather nip this in the bud. It seems that projectile-globally-ignored-directories would ignore ~/code, which isn't great for me, and I'd rather not re-organize my directory structure over this.\n    submitted by    /u/grep_Name  \n [link]   [comments]",

Currently, I switch to the other window with ace-window o (C-x o in my case) then mazimize that one with zoom-window-zoom (bound to z in my case). The nice thing with zoom-window-zoom is that it toggles... so z again unmazimizes the window. Then I C-x o again to get back to the first window. So, to fill my screen with the other window: C-x o, z, z, C-x o. Muscle memory at this point. But I want to be able to hit one key and maximize the other window, and hit it again to unmaximize the other window, and have my pointer where it was in the first window at the end.

So I wrote a little python code in org mode blocks (why not a .py file? just because I like org) to create another .org document with the sql database tables for a quick overview and not having to exit emacs. So now I like to build a function in emacs-lisp to execute the code blocks in the org mode file to automatically generate the tables when you call it, but I'm very new to emacs-lisp and don't know where to start. Any suggestions for that? . \n Is there a package that does something similar?\n https://preview.redd.it/26l7blnykr0a1.png?width=1306&format=png&auto=webp&s=2193c8397719cb6d9206dd20d4fc79ebbaad5215\n    submitted by    /u/GidiomGates  \n [link]   [comments]",

Forgot to escape.\n When I now use undo, the whole text resets to an almost ancient state, sometimes from 10-30 minutes ago.\n So I have to redo-undo.\n Now I'm still stuck with the y instead of the code and I have two options: \n Type all again from the ancient state.\n Type the code again, I accidentally deleted by pressing y without escaping first.\n \n  \nIs there any way I can prevent this time-consuming mess? It can't be that everyone who works with Emacs constantly loses text / code and hours of work.

But none of the walkthroughs and tips I’ve found online awknowledge multiple Fastmail addresses on a single account. \n TL;DR: One Fastmail account, but several aliases/virtual addresses. So myemail@fastmail.com has addresses coolguy@mydomain.com and supercool@mydomain.com and wow@mydomain.com. The Fastmail client has a drop down for send from, and automatically sends email from the right alias when I reply. How do I duplicate this?\n I see no reference to send from or reply-to in any of the setups. Manually editing the from: line when sending from mu4e does nothing… the from and reply lines are just overwritten to whatever I have set for sending email. \n Thanks for any help or pointing me to appropriate resources.

For example, I was trying to figure out how to call a function that could create a new org entry from an org template, with certain values passed in as parameters. I kept running into a wall, until I realized that I needed to set a global variable to a plist containing the values, and then access those values using elisp in the template. This would be a sure sign that someone doesn’t know what the hell they’re doing in any other language I know of, but it seems to just be how things work in the EMacs/elisp world. I can only imagine how bad my code would be if I learned by hacking on EMacs…. \n Is this just a function of EMacs being an older system that was developed before more best practices were developed?

Well, compared to Niklas Luhmann it's still ligheting fast, but thats another story. ;-)\nSearching is something I do a lot while working with my Zettelkasten. As I said before, title search is the feature I miss the most in The Archive.\nOn the other hand, I asked myself: would a combined search of title and content not even be better?\nTo check that out, I made a little Python script that I just pusblished on GitHub (for the first time, by the way – quite exiting!). This is the link:\nhttps://github.com/ralfzosel/zk-smart-search\nThe installation chapter is quite short – probably too short, if you never used Python before.

Trust that something surprising or magical will happen.\n\n  \nI realized that in a few months, let alone years, at this rate most of my time would be spent on the maintenance of memories [notes]. I, as others have found, would be too busy maintaining these memories to use them. 1\n\n\nWhat does \"use\" mean? I can use a note's contents to reignite ideas in me. They can spark new, novel ideas and connections with established knowledge. Some balance between creation, review, and maintenance has to be made in zettelkasting. In that sense, zettelkasting is like dog training. Dog training is hard work, and it is often not fun to train, but the rewards of a well-trained dog show up throughout the day.\nReviewing zettel has been a focus of mine, and I highly recommend it. Looking at notes created yesterday, three weeks ago, six months ago, and last year is a great start. If we develop notes sporadically, we'll probably only have one or two notes to review. Slowly and steadily, we plow through our notes, and in time, we will have reviewed every note multiple times.\nI think Minto is confused about how much time it takes to review a couple of notes (if atomic, focus on a single idea) and how a short review over and over builds, reinforces knowledge, and shows not only new connections but whole new ideas.\nIs it true that the ideas captured in our notes are not worth reviewing? I suggest the next to capture, the review is the most essential piece in a ZK workflow.\nMinto, Robert. \"Rank and File.\" Real Life, 2021, https://reallifemag.com/rank-and-file/.&#160;↩︎",

I'm Tracy, from Ontario, Canada.\nI've been slowly familiarizing myself with some of the zettel intros, posts, and concepts, while also trying to be realistic and conscious about the way my brain works and what will be a sustainable habit to introduce into my existing notes system. Currently, my notes span across academia, professional work, personal stuff, grocery lists, conceptual ideas, project sketches/outlines, and even video game progress plans.\nThese notes are captured in Zotero attachments, paper bullet journals, google docs, iOS Notes App, liquidtext pdf editor, the reminders app... I don't think I'll be able to so cleanly bundle everything into one tool, but I like the idea of taking the things that really engage and interest me and giving them their own space in the archive so I can make cross-disciplinary connections or revelations!\nI am afflicted with the \"it needs to be perfect\" to start with, and something I've been working on is just doing something \"poorly\" or \"haphazardly\" to get that attitude out of the way. My first zettel in the archive software was just me testing the archive syntax (which is new to me) and reflecting on how it feels with my style of note-taking.\nAnyways, looking forward to learning more about zettelkasten, knowledge practices, my own brain processes, and the challenge of sorting, retaining, releasing, and integrating knowledge in a way that is helpful to my own goals",

          "description": "I was watching this video from Cal Newport's podcast where he briefly mentions Zettelkasten. The video is about how he uses a simple marking system while reading and how it makes note taking unnecessary for a professional writer. His definition of the Zettelkasten method is something like take notes on everything you read, regardless if it is relevant to your current project. As an example he gives Ryan Holiday. We know that is a poor definition of a Zettelkasten and Ryan is not a good example either. He takes copious notes, but there is no linking in his system. While I don't agree with his characterization of the Zettelkasten, I think it is true that some people use it that way.\nAnyway, my point is not to complain about his characterization of the Zettelkasten, he mentioned another thing…",

Complex systems theory allows you to see links between disciplines, which also can make hard to focus on one thing at a time.\nI struggled through my endless master thesis process. It got me sick for real. Concentrating was sometimes impossible even for whole weeks. Gracefully I ended it well a few months ago and now I'm a researcher, in the meantime I prepare myself for doing my phd (hopefully 2024 in Berlin).\nWith renovated energies, I'm gradually managing to find a new flow for my work and personal life. A really important part is to develop a workflow, combining project management, journaling, synchronization/backing between home and work devices, code software integration.\nI use to take notes by hand in a notebook. I have several of them filled with research logs, scientific articles notes, theory notes, ideas, day/week journals. I tried (space)emacs and org-mode a couple of years ago, learned the basics to left it completely a month later.\nNow I decided to base my workflow on digital notes. I've sneak into doom emacs with org-roam, obsidian and vscode with dendron.\nI'm inclining in favor of having a note-taking workflow integrated with vscode instead of emacs, as I program in vscode.\nSince deciding on digital note-taking systems choice paradox led to paralysis analysis. But today I finally started with a weakly planner on markdown, in any case it will be not worse than writing it on a physical notebook that will be forgotten.\nThanks for maintaining this nice community.\nAll the best\nC",

In a blog post I'd remove the last subsection, but for my private cesspool I'm inclined to keep it \n202211261601 Endnotes require direct access via chapter marks\n  #endnote #usability\nTo make book endnotes as usable as footnotes, each page or page spread needs to show all relevant information the reader requires to find the appropriate endnote.\nPaperback endnotes are usually not optimized for \"direct access\" (aka \"random access\" as in computer RAM[[202211281004]]): Endnotes are often counted from 1 on a chapter-by-chapter basis. Then the endnotes of a book will be sectioned by chapter.\nUsability problem\nNon-fiction paperback books usually only print the author and book title at the top of pages, so you don't have an easy way to know which chapter you're in.\nExample usage of bad endnotes\nIf you're on page X and want to know what endnote Y is about, you need to page back until you find the beginning of the chapter, or look up the chapter's page range in the table of contents first. Then you can navigate to the approriate section in the endnotes.\nRandom access vs bad sequential access\n\"Random/direct access\" would be possible if one of the page headers contained the current chapter title to make finding the appropriate section in the endnotes easier. Then you'd have all the information, the complete address, to de-reference the number Y.\nIf you page through the book, and simultaneously advance the endnote sections and leave a bookmark there, you would get \"sequential access\" that relies on a process like this.",

Ok, I don't understand why you would use the popular timestamp thing. Sure, you know when the note was created, and you fixed the issue with duplicate titles (which, really, who experiences?) Other than that, what? Then you have this unclean 12-digit number in front of your note title; amazing.\nI've been trying to use Luhmann's 1,2,3b,3c etc., system, which works fine, but there is no convenient way to use it (I am using Obsidian). I used this 12-digit timestamp on hundreds of notes, and it's simply useless. I need something else!\nYes, I researched other solutions, but they were not convincing and too geeky, as I recall. I wonder if someone had the same experience as me. The 12-digit timestamp prefix is missing the point of the Zettelkasten, IMO.

If you understand memory merely as the ability to parrot something that you have stored, memory is something completely different than if you are talking about availability. Do I have a good memory if I can name the back of an index card, but I can't access its contents when I'm supposed to be using it?\nMemorization takes into account a small part of this problem: It is a common recommendation that one practice \"Active Recall\" and not merely repeat the material (e.g., by reading through it several times).\nAfter \"Active Recall\", the key is to make content available when you actually need it, not just in the test situation. There is a difference between memory and the repertoire at one's disposal.\nBut it is difficult to operationalize the situation of actual use.\nThesis: You should start with simple memory techniques and then work your way up to more complex ones.\nTranslated with www.DeepL.com/Translator (free version) (slightly edited by myself)",
