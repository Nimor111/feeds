The corresponding functor laws are:\n traverse pure = pure -- purity law traverse (f <=< g) = traverse f <=< traverse g \n The paper An Investigation of the Laws of Traversals proves the latter law, but only when the monad is commutative, which suggests that this doesn't hold in general.

          "description": "I'm trying to figure out whether it's possible to tell from Haddock documentation whether a given data type is a distinct type with the same name or a re-export of a type defined in another module.\n For example, if I search for IO on Hoogle, the result for data IO a points to many different modules, e.g. the Hedgehog.Internal.Prelude module from the hedgehog package: https://hackage.haskell.org/package/hedgehog-1.2/docs/Hedgehog-Internal-Prelude.html#t:IO. As far as I can see, there is no way to tell, from the docs alone, that this type is a re-export of Prelude.IO. However, this must be the case since the following code typechecks:\n import qualified Hedgehog.Internal.Prelude test1 :: Hedgehog.Internal.Prelude.IO () test1 = (pure () :: Prelude.IO ()) \n If I, on the other hand, search for e.g. Query on Hoogle, I will get lots of data types called Query that are not the same, ie. not re-exports. For example:\n  \nhttps://hackage.haskell.org/package/postgresql-simple-0.6.5/docs/Database-PostgreSQL-Simple.html#t:Query\n https://hackage.haskell.org/package/aws-0.24/docs/Aws-DynamoDb-Commands-Query.html#t:Query\n  \nWhich means that the following will not typecheck:\n import qualified Aws.DynamoDb.Commands.Query import qualified Database.PostgreSQL.Simple test2 :: Aws.DynamoDb.Commands.Query.Query test2 = (undefined :: Database.PostgreSQL.Simple.Query) \n Hence my question: given the Haddocks for two datatypes with the same name, is there a way to tell if they're the same?\n    submitted by    /u/runeks  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "The standard way to map Haskell to category theory is to use the category Hask, where objects represent types, and arrows represent functions between types. It's known that this is an approximation - for example, it ignores bottom values. But I want to talk about another way in which it fails to match the Haskell type system.\n In Hask, we can talk about an object representing Int, one representing Bool, one representing (Int, Bool), one representing Either Int Bool, etc.\n However, this only handles the structural types in Haskell. Haskell allows you to declare nominal types, e.g. newtype Age = Age Int or newtype Count = Count Int. Now those two types should be represented by distinct objects in Hask. There is, of course, an isomorphism between them.\n But how would one distinguish which one is which?\n If we want to represent all possible Haskell types, should we have an infinite number of objects structurally equivalent to Int, because each one could represent a different possible name?\n One approach would be to define Haskell types as pairs of objects from Hask with objects in a separate category of names.\n But then how would you enforce the fact that one name can be used for at most one type? You could end up with the same name being paired with two different types.\n    submitted by    /u/qseep  \n [link]   [comments]",

Why does this have to be a proposal, instead of just a PR? There are the \"how should we implement this function\" concerns, which a PR can tackle, and then the \"let's make sure we don't break every downstream user.\"\n The latter is the concern of the community, but it ought not be; why don't we just add compiler support to prevent this from happening? Thus, my proposal:\n GHC should not emit ambiguous usage errors for functions that shadow ones defined in base. Instead, just use the non-base one, emit a warning saying \"hey, sorry!\" and be done with it. If you want the current behavior, promote the warning to an error via -Werror=....\n Now we can freely add to base without requiring any would-be contributor to build all of stackage and perform a breakage analysis.\n    submitted by    /u/isovector  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "What's a good solution for making interactive web animations using Haskell? I want to be able to animate reduction graphs and include math symbols.\n The interactivity could be as simple as slowing/speeding the animation, and allowing for automatic \"stop points\", like a slide show. Or it could go as far as to allow the content to be dynamically generated by user input. And perhaps people could click on graph nodes and see them expand.\n Reanimate sounds almost ideal, with its support for LaTeX. But unfortunately, it is all rendered in batch, not providing for any interactivity.\n FRP solutions sound very attractive. But reflex seems to be stuck on the outdated GHCJS, and I haven't been able to get it to build (using macOS on Apple Silicon). The newer JS output in GHC doesn't yet have DOM support. And even if I used one of those, figuring out how to interact with a LaTeX renderer might be tricky.\n The diagrams library supports some animation, but it's limited, and the never-seems-to-be-arriving version 2.0 is supposed to replace the animation support with something new.\n Another closely related option is Purescript, which seems to have a few FRP libraries, but I'm not sure how well any of them will work for this application.\n Another option would be to use or interface with a JavaScript library that does interactive animations, such as paper.js or Greensock.\n I figure that depending on the animation, pre-rendering some content may be desirable for performance, and that could be tricky.\n I'm leaning toward using Reanimate because, even though I have to give up on interactivity, it seems to have excellent support for LaTeX integration. So it's probably easiest for prototyping, and I could switch to some other toolset later once I know what I want it to look like.\n    submitted by    /u/qseep  \n [link]   [comments]",

However, not all combinations of these three are valid. For example, a coin with denomination GR1 from the year 1923 could only have come from the Warsaw mint. On the other hand, the same denomination in a different year might belong to the Paris mint.\n My initial thought was to enforce these constraints using a smart constructor, but since this is a pet project aimed at learning, I would prefer to check it at compile time if possible.\n Here's the model I've come up with so far:\n data Denomination = ZL10 | ZL5 | ZL2 | ZL1 | GR50 | GR20 | GR10 | GR5 | GR2 | GR1 deriving (Eq, Ord, Bounded, Enum) data Mint = Warsaw | Paris | Birmingham deriving (Eq, Show, Bounded, Enum) type family OneOf xs where OneOf '[] = Not IdPred OneOf (x : xs) = Or (EqualTo x) (OneOf xs) type Years a = Refined (OneOf a) Year newtype Year = Year {getYear :: Int} deriving (Eq, Ord, Num, TextShow, Show, Lift) type GR1EmissionYears = Years '[1923, 1925, 1927, 1928, 1930, 1931, 1932, 1933, 1934, 1935, 1936, 1937, 1938, 1939] type GR2EmissionYears = Years '[1931, 1932, 1933, 1934, 1935, 1937, 1938, 1939] type GR5EmissionYears = Years '[1923, 1925, 1927, 1928, 1930, 1931, 1932, 1933, 1934, 1935, 1936, 1937, 1938, 1939] -- [...] \n I could of course glue it all into a single union type, listing all the cases explicitly:\n data Coins = Gr1Warsaw1937 | Gr1Paris1937 | Gr1Paris1939 - ... \n But that will make it quite hard to e.g. filter and extract all coins of year 1937.\n I'm wondering if anyone has any thoughts on how to approach this problem.

The playlist containing the first episode is here:\n https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLD8gywOEY4HaG5VSrKVnHxCptlJv2GAn7\n We also have a GitHub repository with the code samples from the episodes:\n https://github.com/well-typed/unfolder\n And we have a public Google calendar listing the planned schedule:\n https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/embed?src=c_327de9ca66caa0307fd99de5b0e3fdd2ad1111ae857bd21659166c74b2b974f0@group.calendar.google.com\n (or ICal: https://calendar.google.com/calendar/ical/c_327de9ca66caa0307fd99de5b0e3fdd2ad1111ae857bd21659166c74b2b974f0%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic.ics )\n    submitted by    /u/kosmikus  \n [link]   [comments]",

My first step is to use it in a toy project to send ping-pong messages between two processes.\n I add distributed-process as a dependency and in extra-deps in stack.yaml file, but I get dependency errors. After adding the recommended dependencies, I am finally stuck with incompatible versions of base. The one in the stack lts version and the one in the library hashable do not match.\n I see that there's a config setup for lts-19.28 here, but it doesn't seem to work for me when I create a new stack project with 19.28 resolver.\n Is there any other way I can get this to work? I am using GHCup for managing my Haskell installation and these are the versions if it matters.\n GHCup 0.1.19.2\n Stack 2.9.3\n    submitted by    /u/slarker  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello,\n if I understand correctly, then the lambda calculus consists of just variables, function application and abstraction.\n Given the term \"λa. (λ b. a b) a\" can you help me to understand what exactly the amounf of subexpressions of this lambda expression are?\n The lack or use of parentheses both still confuse me. I have read that sometimes most parentheses are ommitted and that the abstraction chooses its body greedily, that is, extends itself as far right as possible. My idea is:\n  \nThe expression itself is a (not proper) subexpression\n The first lambda body extends over all the remaining symbols (?) meaning that we have an abstraction of the form λa. M where M a subexpression.\n M itself is an application again (λ b. a b) a\n a is a subexpression of M\n (λ b. a b) is another one\n Lastly, this is λ b. M' for some M' which in this case is a b. Now is a b an application? It has to be since the language doesn't contain something like Var Var, but it does contain the application (X Y) for some terms of the language, right?\n  \n​\n It's still a little confusing for me, could someone maybe point me to the right solution?

Lambdas in this encoding simply add an extra inhabitant to their child term.\n My extension here uses GADTs (and HKTs) to make this work with patterns as well.

That's all my experience with Haskell. And having experience working with Typescript, which has a lot of really cool typing features, I'm wondering if one can replicate them in Haskell. Specifically, my question is about type mappings and conditional types. In Typescript, one can define an interface (basically, a record type):\n ```ts interface Person { name: string; age: number; married: boolean; }\n interface Profile extends Person { friends: Array<Person>; job: { title: string; salary: number; onVacation: boolean; }; } ```\n And then it's possible to create a new type out of this one by recursively replacing all numbers and boolean with strings:\n ```ts // This type gets a type argument T and recursively replaces all its boolean and number fields with strings type AllStrings<T> = { [Key in keyof T]: T[Key] extends number ? string : T[Key] extends boolean ? string : AllStrings<T[Key]>; };\n function parseBadJSON(badJSON: AllStrings<Profile>): Profile { // mapping logic } ```\n Moreover, you can see record type inheritance with extends keyword.\n I had a task at my job where I needed to parse a JSON that stores all values as strings, and I needed to map it to a JSON with numbers and booleans, where they were supposed to be, so that's how I achieved the correct typings for my mapping function (parseBadJSON).

Please view on Desktop if possible.\n TL;DR - Okapi, a web framework that I started working on last year, now uses an Applicative instead of a Monad. This has made the framework a lot more consistent and easier to understand. It also makes it possible to automatically generate OpenAPI specifications from your endpoint definitions. It should be possible to generate clients as well, but I haven't worked on this yet. You can learn more at the new documentation website: https://okapi.wiki/. Would you u…",

          "description": "Hello!\n I'm currently taking a Functional Programming course, and we are using Haskell. I had a really hard time setting everything up, but I think I finally have something that is somewhat working. I'm using a M1 Mac so I decided to install ghcup using brew. I then installed everything else haskell related using ghcup (stack, cabal, ghc, and hls). When I then started working on my assignment the code had some imports like Random and HUnit. So in order to get that to work I tried to install those using Cabal. At this point I noticed that I also needed llvm so I installed llvm@13 using brew and added the path to $PATH. I then did cabal install --lib random and it worked! However, I have found out that this is probably no the preferred way of using cabal and I wanted to switch to a stack project which leads me to my question.\n Is there a good way to remove this libraries that I installed? I have found that the files are installed in the .cabal/store/ghc-8.10.7. In this folder I have HUnt-1.6.2.0-18526221 and rndm-1.2.1.1-c70f7c08. Can I just remove those files? Or is there a better way to do it? I basically do not want random and HUnit to be installed for every Haskell projekt I'm working on moving forward. Some noteworthy things might be that when I do cabal list --installed they don't show, but I can compile the code without any issues.\n I hope I was able to explain my issue and appreciate any help I can get. If there are any issues with the way I installed llvm or haskell stuff that would also be extremely appreciated. It feels like I have spent way to much time on just setting stuff up and would need to start doing some actual programing...\n    submitted by    /u/Geeky_Swimmer  \n [link]   [comments]",

The repository seems fairly inactive, is many versions behind modern LLVM, and recent github issues documenting build issues have been met with silence. This seems like a very basic package for a language that is supposed to be well suited to writing compilers. I did not expect to have this issue at all. Even flipping Python seemingly has more up to date LLVM bindings.\n So I'm sadly considering abandoning using haskell for my project. Are there other bindings I'm not aware of?

We moved from IntelliJ to VSCode + Metals a while back because of the lack of Scala 3 support in IntelliJ. But I'm having serious problems with the debugger, to me it's nearly worthless. It can't do the simplest things, like just step over code, it jumps to what feel like totally random places deep in the ZIO codebase. The only way I can get it to sometimes work is by using {} brackets so that I can put pure Scala code, no ZIO's, on their own lines, and only break there. Then run from break point to break point, stepping is essentially useless.\n Is it just me, or are others having the same experience? Any good tips, or workarounds? Has IntelliJ started to catch up with Scala 3 support?

          "description": "Recently I have been looking at alternatives to Unity3d for gamedev. As part of this I created a very simple hex-based tic-tac-toe game using Scala.js and the 3d library Babylon.js. It also uses Vite.js for quick dev turnaround, Electron.js for native packaging, and ScalablyTyped to create a Babylon.js facade.\n I was quite happy with the result. It was especially nice to program in Scala again (after a long break) and be able to imagine using it for both client and server code. Now I need to consider whether it is right for me, as there are a number of business issues around using Javascript, but at least the technical side seems possible.\n Since there were a few pains getting all the different libraries to play nicely together, I thought the result may be useful to other people. No tutorial, but my notes are in the README and the code is all available on Github. Be aware I am not a Scala expert, but the code works as far as I have tested it.\n I broke the code into a few pieces for libs for possible reuse, or other people to look to for ideas\n  \nHexTacToe https://github.com/jarrahtech/HexTacToe - the game itself\n kassite https://github.com/jarrahtech/kassite - Scala.js for (hopefully) functionality common to multiple Scala.js/Babylon.js games - currently has tweening and some shader material stuff. No tests yet - need to work on that\n babylonjsfacade https://github.com/jarrahtech/babylonjsfacade - Scala.js facade of Babylon.js 6.2 (generated within the Github project by ScalablyTyped). I made this a separate project so that the others didn't need to import and build it (as it is quite large)\n  \nalso a couple of other libs which are less important for demonstrating the technologies:\n  \nhex https://github.com/jarrahtech/hex - Scala/Scala.js cross-building hex grid library\n jarrah-util https://github.com/jarrahtech/jarrah-util - Scala/Scala.js cross-building common game code/maths lib\n  \nHope its helpful for someone else,\n Charles.\n    submitted by    /u/cordinc  \n [link]   [comments]",

In fact, some seem to say it is declining, and the numbers might bear that theory out somewhat.\n But most things I've read about the language are absolutely awesome!\n Two of the main problems I have heard are:\n  \nToo much change. Apparently the leap to Scala 3 was a little rushed and tooling is still catching up. This has left companies with a choice of either using legacy or investing in something that keeps changing.\n Too much power. It almost seems as though the power of Scala is limitless. Most articles I've read list a huge reel of concepts. Some of the ones that I can recognise seem powerful to the point of abusability, like metaprogramming. This also makes the language harder to learn.\n  \nPotential intervention to address criticisms:\n  \nA promise to freeze changes to the language and other core parts for a period of, say, three years (exempting bug fixes).\n  \nWhat do you think?

What I understand is the developer should own his own company so that the contracts is between the two businesses ie the client and the developer. And in some cases there's a talent recruitment firm in the middle. \n My question is does the job application process differ from normal employment job offers. \n Does the job application require you to apply as a business or individual say my company is scalaconsults. \n What if you are a 3 man outfit. All partners in your business, can you still apply for such job contracts. How does the interview process go now that you are more than one.\n Incase of b2b scala jobs on linkedin where do I show that this is my business, this is my crew, this is what I've done. Coz on linkedin it seems like an individual process not business.\n Once your employed can you subcontract the work.\n Sorry for the many questions.

          "description": "I've recently noticed a trend in my workplace where Scala is losing its footing in favour of alternative languages like Golang. Our latest projects no longer use Scala, and we've even gone so far as to refactor some complex legacy Scala code into more streamlined Golang. \n As someone who loves Scala, it's been a bit disheartening to see this shift in adoption. Has anyone else experienced a similar transition within their organizations? And for those who have, what do you think are the driving factors behind this change?\n    submitted by    /u/itecyo  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "This Release Candidate version of Indigo (a Scala 3 pixel art 2D game engine for Scala.js) is the result of six months work and will hopefully become a full release after undergoing a bit more testing. Feel free to take it for a spin! 🚀\n It contains a good number of general improvements that are based on real usage during the production of our biggest demo to date, hopefully coming soon-ish!\n The main bulk of the work is a total replacement of all GLSL based shaders in favour of programs written using Ultraviolet. Ultraviolet is a Scala 3 shader program writing library that is currently aimed at WebGL + GLSL. The purpose of this work is to begin to separate Indigo from Scala.js and WebGL, so that the project can look at supporting other rendering technologies (WebGPU is the next likely target), and one day, other platforms like the JVM and/or Native. Custom GLSL shaders will still be supported for the for the foreseeable future, but existing shaders will require very minor modification to be compatible.\n Indigo's website is slowly going through a necessary rebuild, so for now it's advisable to check out the release notes below if you decide to try this version out. Alternatively, do come and say hello on our Discord server if you need any help, or even just to show off what you're making. 😁\n https://github.com/PurpleKingdomGames/indigo/releases/tag/v0.15.0-RC1\n    submitted by    /u/davesmith00000  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Usually org-mode manual is pretty exhaustive and very useful source of information. However it doesn’t offer an exhaustive list of all build-in properties, nor detail if and in what form they can be overwritten by user, and what happens if user so does anyway.\n This kind of list is the exact thing I am trying to parse together for myself. My current strategy is using the add propety function which lists all available properties, the Reserved Properties -listing under Properties section, which offers a glossary explanation of individual properties, and searching the Index for word ‘Property’, and once I find a new link, I visit it and hopefully find other properties near it.\n However, this is pretty slow way to gather the list, and it doesn’t really distinguish between useful properties, properties user can use if they want, and system-breaking properties.\n Usually better documentation is written in the relevant chapter of the manual, if the property is intended to be used.\n Has anyone written about this online? I found some youtube videos discussing some of the properties related to clocking, but generally it seems this information is written from the opposite direction from my approach: from usecase to property, not from property to usecase.\n I don’t have any good reasoning behind wanting this information. I just want to write it down in my notes, and while doing it gain some insight into org-mode as a system.\n What I mean by system breaking is something like CLOCKSUM_T. I haven’t yet tested the behaviour, but as this is used to calculate todays clocked time for a heading and it’s children, it is very clear that either the users input is overwritten, or the clocksum is inaccurate. This might not be strictly system-breaking, but neither does it make sense inside the system.\n    submitted by    /u/stepbroImstuck_in_SU  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm particularly interested in hearing how others utilize org-roam in their workflows.\n I've developed a system where I create index pages for each major subject. These org-roam files are tagged with :index: and usually left empty. \n For instance, if I were learning Python, I'd create three index pages: Python, Theory, and Examples, with the last two having backlinks for the first one.\n When I take notes related to a particular subject, I create a new note and insert a backlink to the corresponding index page. This way, when I need to find a specific note, I can simply visit one of the index pages and review its backlinks, instead of trying to remember what name i gave to the specific note.\n While this method has been somewhat effective for me, I'm wondering if there might be a more efficient or more organized way to approach this. I'd love to hear about any tips, tricks, or workflows you use in org-roam when learning new topics.\n Thanks\n    submitted by    /u/jenescript  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I may be missing something stupid. When I put links in Org-mode files they appear normally, i.e. the whole [[/link][caption]] thing is hidden and I just see the caption with an underline, can click on it, etc.\n I also have my Emacs configured (somehow) to color characters overflowing my fill-column something jarring, and I usually use auto-fill-mode and have no problems with that.\n For example if I have fill-column set to 3 and have a line abcde, de will be colored to mark they're over the line limit.\n However, it seems that whatever's coloring my isn't taking into account what Org-mode does to hide links. So if I have a link [[/link][caption]] which has 18 characters in its raw form but only 7 (caption) are getting displayed, those 7 characters count as 18 characters towards the line limit!\n For example if I have fill-column set to 20 and have a line [[/link][caption]] foo, I expected to see no characters marked as over the limit because I'm seeing just caption foo, but in fact the final oo are marked as over the limit because in that regard it counts as a 22-character line.\n Sorry for the verbose explanation. Does anyone have a solution for this? I could make the color less jarring but this is lowkey driving me crazy.\n    submitted by    /u/edenworky  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I’m just getting started with org-mode in Emacs and am looking at options for keeping my org files in sync between computers — specifically, between two Macs. A complication is that on one of the Macs I am limited in what software I can install, for work-related reasons (for example, syncthing might not be an option, Dropbox is probably OK, as is iCloud Drive).\n It’s most important to me that the syncing should be robust, reliable, and secure. I’d like to have files sync automatically in the background, rather than having to trigger a sync manually before leaving one machine or starting on the other. Similarly, it would be good if I don’t have to remember to close all buffers before I leave a machine (i.e. if conflicts and simultaneous editing aren’t a problem, or at least that resolving conflicts doesn’t risk losing data). Also in terms of avoiding data loss, I’d like to be able to make backups of the files, ideally with versioning in case I need to go back and fix something.\n End-to-end encryption would be desirable if it’s cloud storage (which might make iCloud Drive preferable to Dropbox). Being able to sync to an iOS app like Beorg would be nice too, but is less important.\n However, one concern I have about iCloud (apart from some suggestions that it's not always reliable) is that it seems like you can’t always guarantee that all files are really stored locally on the Mac, rather than only in the cloud, even if you don’t select “optimize storage\" (see for example https://eclecticlight.co/2022/02/21/can-you-back-up-icloud-documents/ ). So, it seems that backup solutions aren’t guaranteed to be able to see and backup the files stored in there (if they happen to be online only). Otherwise, I’d be happy to do my own backups of the directory with something like rsync to my NAS.\n Are there any solutions that fit my wishlist, or am I being too demanding in what I’m looking for? Any pointers would be very welcome!\n    submitted by    /u/argopenguin  \n [link]   [comments]",

However, I was curious about whether org mode could display information more like a \"storyboard.\" Either horizontally or (maybe better for not having to scroll so much) tiling.\n I imagine this would work with the top level heading defining a card / unit and then units would be displayed horizontally or in a grid, rather than a vertical list.\n Is this something that already exists?\n    submitted by    /u/encomun  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "hi everybody,\n I wonder... why is using javascript injection NOT a common method to retrieve the URL, title and selection inside a web-page? Here is a simple AppleScript that does that. it would be trivial to write a function that calls this script, parses the output and is used by the user in whichever way wanted.\n  #!/usr/bin/env osascript set jsCommand to \"console.log( 'get url,title' );document.URL + ';;' + document.title + ';;' + window.getSelection().toString();\" tell application \"Google Chrome\" execute front window's active tab javascript jsCommand end tell \n I realize that using AppleScript only works on MacOS. But there must be a way to do it in other platforms. This seems to be a way more practical way to retrieve this info than starting an org-capture from the browser.\n    submitted by    /u/dm_g  \n [link]   [comments]",

(my-org-mode mode with a keymap containing \"C-c a\"). I can add a hook for org-mode to also enable my-org-mode, and on change-major-mode hook to disable my-org-mode.\n Then I could make this mode have higher precedence than org-mode using 'emulation-mode-map-alists. (Basically what this is saying but for every mode I define bindings for)\n Could do the same for a \"global map\" that will have lower precedence than the mode-specific ones.\n Then for the bindings I don't define it should \"just work\".\n Is this a decent idea for trying to achieve what I want or am I way overcomplicating this?\n Also are there any packages that could help me do this or do I have to code it up myself. I don't mind coding it but would like to save some time.\n Thank you\n    submitted by    /u/zackattackz  \n [link]   [comments]",

No big deal, I've worked 100% over tramp before. But, I set up projectile to find my remote project, and while it loads the project, and Messages tells me its caching files, I have no files found, ie projectile-find-file has nothing to choose from, nothing gets completed. I've never seen projectile do this before, and I'm not sure how to debug it. Can you get a log from the cache population? The project is in a git repo that seems to be detected otherwise.

Switching between 2 or 3 or more layouts would be awesome.\n No need to save them between emacs sessions, but that could be interesting as well.\n Ideally such concepts as..\n - layout list\n - layout create\n - layout switch\n - layout kill\n I've been fiddling with 0blayout package, which covers most of it. No layout list, but layout-switch with vertico more or less covers it.\n The problem with that one is it doesn't seem to save/restore the location for each window..\n ex: If I make a layout which is split into a top and bottom window A and B, with code on top and an org file on bottom, and then switch to some other layout.. and then back, it'll prooperly restore the window layout for A and B and bcak to those files... great! HOWEVER, if A and B are the same file, but different locations within it, that doesn't work.. both windows A and B will switch to the same file, the same position within it. \n I guess I could look into saving window layouts to registers and popping around that way, but I was sure there was a more sophisticated way of doing it.\n (I forget if Bufler does this .. I use filetree as my buffer-list replacement, and bufler doesn't work well when Tramp with remote sessions are alive.. so I've generally ignored Bufler the last year or two.)\n Thanks for reading :)\n    submitted by    /u/FrozenOnPluto  \n [link]   [comments]",

Installing a language server in each venv seems a bit of overkill, especially since I am always going to use the same language server and the people I work with on Python projects don't need the (same) language server (as they use something like VSCode with Pylance). \n On the other hand, installing the language server in the venv saves me a bit of work creating the relevant config files to ensure they run the commands with the right binary (e.g. I don't need to create a mypy.ini files to ensure mypy runs from the venv, nor do I need a pyrightconfig.json to point the server to the venv).\n I found a way to get both pyright and pylsp working on Emacs, whether they are globally installed or installed in the venv.

Let me explain.\n If I have a dir structure like this:\n . ├── projects ├── proyecto-uno ├── .git ├── readme.org ├── proyecto-dos ├── proyecto-tres \n And the current buffer is readme.org, getting the project name - 'proyecto-uno' is fairly easy, if you're using projectile, you can do (projectile-project-name), right? Alternatively, you can use: (magit-toplevel), which returns full path, i.e., ~/projects/proyecto-uno/ and then you can just grab the last segment.\n Now, it gets tricky when you're using git-worktrees and the structure of the project is like this:\n . ├── projects ├── proyecto-uno ├── .git ├── readme.org ├── proyecto-dos ├── .bare ├── master ├── development ├── .git ├── readme2.org ├── proyecto-tres \n The current buffer is readme2.org. How do you get the project name? (projectile-project-name) returns development (and I want 'proyecto-dos'). (magit-toplevel) returns full path to \"development\" dir not to 'proyecto-dos'. \n So then you may suggest, why don't you check, if the buffer is inside a worktree? And that I don't know how to.

          "description": "Since 0.4.0 shipped, I updated the accompanying guide I wrote.\n Since I also updated my screen-capture workflow for video recording (for champagne), it's perhaps time to answer some questions about the deepest, darkest corners of building applications with transient.\n On the surface, you can be forgiven for thinking transient is similar to hydra. Without the state juggling and flow control of transient, you cannot make the same level of expressive user interface.\n Some of the topics that get beyond the surface and require thinking about how you would use this software to build applications\n  \nFlow control\n History & state\n Custom infixes\n  \nIn particular you can also be forgiven for thinking custom infixes are some kind of crazy extensibility without much practical value. This is far from the truth. Attaching complex values to your user input command sentences and quickly modifying any part of these sentences allows you to express a lot of rich commands in a short time. That is the secret to the efficiency of magit, and magit doesn't even use very complex flow control. Infix overriding allows your interface to reflect and follow the state of the application.\n I'm not terribly incentivized to go beyond the showcase, which at worst contains working examples for just about every behavior. It is less complex code than magit and made of examples that demonstrate behavior in isolation. However, if the demand is interesting and severe, I may be spurred into finishing a richer demonstration.\n    submitted by    /u/Psionikus  \n [link]   [comments]",

Everything is scaled down, the fonts, the windows, etc. I can fullscreen the frame, but the fonts are still all tiny. \n Odd thing is that any other program I open up inside an emacs frame is scaled just fine... so it's only emacs text buffers that have this issue.\n Running  emacs 29 pre-release compiled with native comp and x minimal emacs config with a handful of packages, mappings, and a few fns.. nothing fancy latest pop_os dell xps 15 3840 x 2400 resolution no exwm specific config other than exwm-enable (did try the example config)  all the font scaling and randr stuff seems to be set fine.\n Not sure where else to look.. \n Any pointers much appreciated!!

I want a simple solution where a single key-press can update the log file on demand. Moreover, I don't want to accidentally edit it so I want the read-only mode with single key-press update feature. I have the following pipeline:\n  \nOpen the log file and convert to read-only-mode (C-x C-q key-press).\n When read-only-mode is activated then we remap the 'g' key to the revert-buffer. One possible solution is to use `current-local-map` function but the downside is that remapping will be activated in all the files opened with that major-mode.

          "description": "Hi all,\n pretty much the title question. I asked the same on r/lisp but I realize it's better suited here. I like Edebug because it allows to follow the computation even in a single form, from the inside out. Like, given something like\n (+ 3 (/ 4 n))\n I can see exactly not only what n is, but also what are the intermediate results. The closest thing I found for now is Sly's stickers, but I wondered if there was an actual equivalent. Otherwise, I find CL's debugger a bit difficult to use in step-mode, but that could easily being me not having read the manual thoroughly. So, does a CL-Edebug exist, much like CIDER's for Clojure? And if not, can I use SLIME/Sly to step between forms (from inside out)?\n P.S., IIUC Sly is the improved (better?) version of SLIME. Is it right?\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/a-searcher  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I've been using org-roam for a while, and it's going great; however, I sense some inconvenience with having a big amount of encrypted org files, especially when they don't use the same key. This makes it much harder to search through the notes since I've to decrypt them each. So I was thinking if giving up the mix for having all the notes to be encrypted in one directory would fix that, like having all the notes encrypted by default but all of them also decrypt at once, so they become easier to search & query. But I don't know even how to do that, the best came to my mind is to encrypt the directory itself, but I also have no idea of how this can be done :P \n Any suggestions? \n p.s. I use disk encryption already if that matters, but I want extra protection.\n    submitted by    /u/larrasket  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I recognize that asking such a question might seem peculiar; however, please allow me to elaborate. My journey with Linux has led me to an insatiable desire for optimization, beginning with vim/neovim and permeating nearly every aspect of my digital life. I have hand-crafted scripts for everything. The only thing left is to unify my coding and writing experience in one place.\n I use vim for coding, and I'm very happy with it. However, when it comes to writing, the visual representation of equations and figures help me concentrate on content. While vimtex (a vim plugin) offers a solution for creating LaTeX-based PDFs, the fusion of code and text hinders my thought process. For me, writing on a computer has to be similar to putting pen on a paper, where the focus is on content, not on the representation. For this reason, I sought an alternative solution and my search led me to TeXmacs. Here's how my notes look. No ugly LaTex -- equations/figures look nice, etc.\n TeXmacs is nice and all, except that it's not vim. I can't use all of my fancy plugins (jump between files, write custom snippets, define custom actions, etc). It seems that emacs can be made just as powerful as vim, while also having the ability to display inline equations and images. This seems like the answer to all my questions, except that I only looking at the positives. I hesitate to succumb to the illusion of greener pastures, as vim has served me impeccably, save for the aforementioned limitations. Thus, I must ask: is Emacs the solution I seek?\n    submitted by    /u/medwatt  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "So I use tags for my org tasks like: @anywhere, @computer, @work, and @home. There's a hierarchical structure here, sort of like this:\n @anywhere @computer @work @home \n So from my agenda, I'd like to be able to filter for e.g. @work when I'm on my work computer, and have all tasks labeled as @anywhere, @computer, or @work show up. The problem is, org's Tag Hierarchy seems to work in the opposite way that I want; when I create a hierarchy like this:\n (setq org-tag-alist '((:startgrouptag) (\"@anywhere\") (:grouptags) (:startgrouptag) (\"@computer\") (:grouptags) (\"@work\") (\"@home\") (:endgrouptag) (:endgrouptag)) \n Then filter by e.g. @work, I only get @work-tagged entries. On the other hand, when I reverse the hierarchy like this:\n (setq org-tag-alist '((:startgrouptag) (\"@work\") (:grouptags) (\"@anywhere\") (\"@computer\") (:endgrouptag) (:startgrouptag) (\"@home\") (:grouptags) (\"@anywhere\") (\"@computer\") (:endgrouptag)) \n I can filter by @work or @home and get the results I want, however I can't filter by @computer and see all @work/@home/@computer/@anywhere-tagged entries. And, unfortunately, if I add a grouptag section for @computer, it includes children of that group in @work and @home now, corrupting those groups.\n So my question is: is there a better way to filter to include a child in a hierarchy OR its parents? FWIW I've also tried using the | operator in my filter query (e.g. @work|@anywhere) but org doesn't seem to parse it, and it does no filtering (it gives me a message like @work|@anywhere filter ignored because tag/category is not represented).\n ​\n (btw, I'm using doom emacs, in case that happens to be relevant here)\n    submitted by    /u/C-x_M-c_M-butterfly  \n [link]   [comments]",

When the point is then moved to (via arrow key for example) the view would jump back to the point. \n I know I read this somewhere, but I just can not find it. Someone know what I mean?\n Thanks\n    submitted by    /u/Schievel1  \n [link]   [comments]",

Looks like it's the best open alternative for copilot.\n There is also a VSCode extension https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=HuggingFace.huggingface-vscode \n Nothing for Emacs, but I think adding it would not be that hard (the above extension itself is a fork of a TabNine extension). \n Semi-related interesting post https://thakkarparth007.github.io/copilot-explorer/posts/copilot-internals.html#reverse-engineering-preview on reverse engineering the copilot extension (how it prompts the LLM to add context about your project).

I didn't really like this approach, so I made something better, a very simple function that between a given list of Zettlekasten:\n (setq zettlekasten-paths-alist '((\"Main\" . \"~/Some/Path/\") (\"Zettlekasten2\" . \"~/Other/Path/\"))) (defun switch-zettlekasten () (interactive) (let* ((keys (mapcar #'car zettlekasten-paths-alist)) (prompt (format \"Select Zettlekasten:\")) (key (completing-read prompt keys)) (chosen-zettlekasten-path (cdr (assoc key zettlekasten-paths-alist)))) (setq org-roam-directory chosen-zettlekasten-path) (setq org-roam-db-location (concat chosen-zettlekasten-path \"org-roam.db\")) (org-roam-db-sync))) \n I have personally bound this to C-c n s since C-c n is the prefix for org-roam related commands.

I use this binding extensively in my workflow and it mostly works well, but there are a few scenarios where jumping backwards doesn't seem to work.\n First, when I'm in Org Agenda and press Enter on a todo item (org-agenda-switch-to) to go to the corresponding org file, I'm unable to jump back to the Org Agenda buffer - C-o takes me to a seemingly random location. I tried fixing this with advice:\n  (advice-add 'org-agenda-switch-to :before #'better-jumper-set-jump) \n but the location in Org Agenda still doesn't seem to be in the jump list.\n Second, when in helpful mode (when looking up docs with e.g. helpful-key or helpful-callable) I can't figure out how to go back after following a link in the docs (i.e. after pressing Enter over a link). In helpful mode better-jumper-jump-backward just doesn't seem to do anything and I'm at a loss as to how I'm supposed to navigate.\n I'd really appreciate any help from those more familiar with setting up these libraries than I am.\n    submitted by    /u/polarbearwithagoatee  \n [link]   [comments]",

If Emacs reboots and the container is no longer there, project attempts to open the file in TRAMP, and TRAMP hangs until I press q to allow tramp to exit.\n I can think of two ways to hypothetically fix this:\n The first is by modifying the project-find-functions list. It's a list of functions which are ran in succession until one of them returns a truthy value. My current project-find-functions is (project-try-vc project-try-local). I believe in my case project-try-vc is returning t.\n The second is by telling TRAMP to move on after a failure, allowing the boot to complete even when some projects are not accessible. I'm thinking an advice might be necessary to achieve this.\n Are there any other options? Does anyone out there have a solution to this already?\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/FederalPirate2867  \n [link]   [comments]",

My rough notes sync from my e-ink device to my laptop, where I use Obsidian to transform my e-ink notes into more fleshed out notes (Evergreen notes).\n I like being outside and work/study from different places and one hurdle I run into is I don’t have a way of accessing my nice fleshed out Obsidian notes on my e-ink device. Usually I have to have my laptop/phone next to me and reference my notes from there, which is not ideal. \n Now, this has me wondering if I can warrant myself switching to emacs and org to have my computer notes (org files) easily accessible on my e-ink device. \n I have been doing a bit of searching and I guess org-publish and then accessing a website on my e-ink device could work. Perhaps mass exporting all my .org files as pdfs/epubs and then syncing them to my e-ink device. (I don’t know if that method could keep backlinks)\n But as I have never used org and this is just my speculation I came here to ask: Is this feasible? Do any of you have a similar setup? \n Thanks.\n    submitted by    /u/Pacco911  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'd like to be able to change the bg/fg colors dynamically based on the current DOOM theme. \n I've successfully written a function that changes the XML data to the new bg/fg color of the xml in-place, and hooked it to doom-load-theme-hook. However, xenops still renders a new preview for the exact same text.\n For example, say i have a xenops LaTeX snippet \n \\(S^1\\) \n generated for the theme doom-zenburn.\n I can change the theme, and the XML file for the associated to the above snippet has its colors updated. In fact, if the preview is visible inline, and I change the theme, the preview changes its colors. This is expected behavior.\n However, when I enter the LaTeX snippet and exit it again, xenops regenerates the snippet for the new theme. Is there a way to prevent this? I don't want to generate new snippets per theme as this would take up unnecessary disk space and compute resources.\n My gut tells me it's not possible.

One of the warnings was not to use docker-tramp anymore due to the built in tramp-container.el\n At a quick glance of the .el and errors it produces, I'm getting the feeling that was designed around local containers (Docker running locally with the Emacs), but not for a remote container\n For example, I use Tramp via multi-hop, so that I can ssh to a server where the containers are running, and run the docker ps and open a shell within the images _over there_\n So a bookmark would look something like:\n /ssh:[foo@someserver.com](mailto:foo@someserver.com)|docker:bar@container:/path/within/docker\n tramp-container.el looks like the same syntax (/docker) as docker-tramp, but I wonder if it only works locally?\n I'll have to try docker-tramp again and see if remote still works there, or am I out of luck on this astoundingly handy behaviour. (or perhaps a local docker daemon can reach out to remote docker daemons, or I can run some ssh tunnels to pretend local is remote, or something..)\n edit: Looks like I had a defcustom override for the docker tramp so it was using 'sudo docker' on the target very old system; so I added a override tramp-docker-program for the new module, but still no dice.

(measured via time emacs --eval \"(save-buffers-kill-terminal)\" It's possible that some of this is due to no longer loading things that have been added into Emacs over the time that my configuration has grown (when was org-mode made native??) - and a side benefit of elpaca is that it complained about this and made me fix it.\n But does multi-threading improve both installation time AND start-up time?\n    submitted by    /u/kentrose  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "A literate org mode document that tangles, using noweb an org file into a theme file is a nice way of organizing themes by the files and sections they customize instead of by the sections needed by the file. See: https://gitlab.com/stefan.koch.micro/dotfiles/-/blob/master/emacs/stefan-theme-tangle.org\n Details:\n I spent the weekend setting up my own color theme. What I did not like about how this is done is that the color theme file is broken into sections by the need of the functions to define it. What I wanted to do was to setup the theme organized by the mode or functionality. Since others sharing has helped me in the past, I thought I would share this with the community. (See: The Proximity Principle at https://kula.blog/posts/proximity_principle/)\n I had been using the following techniques anyway, so I was most of the way there:\n  \nUsed GNU Stow to manage my dotfiles (Brandon Invergo' Using GNU Stow to manage your dotfiles: https://brandon.invergo.net/news/2012-05-26-using-gnu-stow-to-manage-your-dotfiles.html\n Used literate config file using org-babel. This lets you write an org file with emacs lisp source code blocks that are saved to an .el file when it is tangled.) See Literate Programming here: https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/intro.html#literate-programming\n  \nBut, this still made me sequence the code in the sections that the theme file required. I did not want that. So noweb came to the rescue. Using noweb, you can have a source block that will include references to source blocks defined in other areas of the org file. This allowed me to organize the file the way I wanted to. The top of the file is the skeleton for the theme file with the sections defined, and the sections below each add to the theme section as they need.\n In case you missed it above, see https://gitlab.com/stefan.koch.micro/dotfiles/-/blob/master/emacs/stefan-theme-tangle.org for the full details.\n    submitted by    /u/StefanKochMicro  \n [link]   [comments]",

I suspect that many users have themselves customized that variable to put all backup files in a single directory, in which case they would also be affected.)\n If you use emacs/emacsclient as EDITOR and an external tool opens an unencrypted file containing some sensitive data in a directory on a tmpfs file-system, then the backup file would by default be created in the same directory, so it would not hit a disk and be discarded after a reboot.\n Note that this only affects you, if the visited file is not encrypted. So if you, for example, visit ~/.authsource.gpg, then the backup file is also encrypted, regardless of where it resides.\n Please update to release 1.3.0 or snapshot 20230420 and delete all files ~/.config/emacs/var/backup/!tmp!... and ~/.config/emacs/var/backup/!dev!shm!....\n This gets you back to how Emacs behaves by default.\n  \nThe default isn't so great either. No backups are created for files in /tmp, but for files in /dev/shm backups are created. To prevent that you would have to use a custom backup-enable-predicate function. (If you don't do that, then the backup files sticks around until a reboot, but at least then they get discarded.)\n  \nThis issue was discovered a day ago (https://lonely.town/@wasamasa/110227701055899570) and was reported an hour ago (https://github.com/emacscollective/no-littering/issues/200).\n In the future, please report security issues privately.\n    submitted by    /u/tarsius_  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have wanted an easy way to refile all headings from scratch.org file to files in dropbox. I thought of an elisp form at the top of the file which will act like a button by evaluating with eval-last-sexp command.\n I also wanted this refiling thing for the files in Dropbox. Every file would refile to a specific file.\n I couldn't create those elisp forms that will act like buttons easily. It was harder than i thought. I found org-refile function hard to work with programmatically. \n After wasting so much time about this problem, i found a rather simpler and maybe even intuitive solution.\n I add local variables to each org file. An org-refile-targets and org-archive-location variable for every file. This solution doesn't give a one click way to refile all headings to a file, but it does give a simpler and focused way to refile and archive headings to specific org-files. \n I found this solution very satisfying for my workflow.

If I want to keep the item, I promote it by either moving it to another file, or removing its timestamp.\n For each item, if I haven't promoted it by the time its timestamp rolls around, then org-mode deletes the entry\n  \nThis means I want a plugin or a command or something that will delete items with expired timestamps. I looked through the org manual, and found C-u C-u C-c C-x C-s (https://orgmode.org/manual/Moving-subtrees.html) that will archive items under these circumstances. I want to delete them.\n I suppose I could set up the archive file to be /dev/null !

This contains each of the individual pieces of the system (atomic ideas).  But then my enthusiasm dies down as I realize this image is essentially MULTIPLE ideas in one graphic, triggering analysis paralysis as I consider how to capture this within my Obsidian-based Zettelkasten.\nMY QUESTION FOR YOU\nBefore you read on, pretend you ran into this information.  Your goal is to use your Zettelkasten to help you write strategy documents for your company AND to write articles for product managers in startups to help them launch better products.\nHow would YOU capture the gold within this infographic within your Zettelkasten?\nOPTIONS I'M CONSIDERING\nNow that you've considered your own solutions, here's a few I thought of.\nCreate one Obsidian Canvas, capturing the entire infographic (a Card for each part of the flowchart and each checklist).  Then begin creating Zettels or linking existing Zettels for each individual component, replacing each Card with a Note instead as I go.\n\n\nTechnically, this option violates the \"Atomic Notes\" rule since my first Zettel would be this full infographic - I'd be essentially capturing a contextualized idea, then breaking it down, which may not yield surprise insights as going bottom-up should.\n\nCreate an Overview Zettel (simple text file) with each item written out, then use this Overview Zettel to create individual Zettels from there.\n\n\nSame concept as #1, but in a text file rather than a Canvas.\n\nKeep this infographic in my Lit Note (aka Reference) and create individual zettels as I go.\nDoes one of these align with what you would do?  If so, which one and why?  If not, how would your approach differ from any of mine?\nThanks in advance!",

Tell us about the state of your zettelkasting journey.\nI'll start.\nI finally released my project that extends The Archive, showing an \"Idea Explorer\" on demand for every note. This can be thought of as a way to look at \"note sequences.\" Sequences that develop an idea. I'm looking for collaborators to develop this idea further. Idea Explorer - an extension exclusively for The Archive.\nThis past week I've had the opportunity to practice and work on my technique for onboarding videos into my ZK. Speed and timing are critical—speed in taking notes and timing in reviewing the event. I feel I've gained a little success making a rough, rough draft during the presentation, then immediately after, as part of the process of watching a video, I expand my notes as I would if they were highlights from an article. Having a few minutes of uninterrupted time immediately after the video presentation to fill in my thoughts on my note is critical.\nI'm looking to do more of this. I get excited when I onboard live streams or Zoom events more than videos where I can start, stop, and replay the action. They feel more dynamic, and they spark my juices.\nMaybe I should try sketch-noting. It just feels like my skills at sketching are so poor that I'd miss stuff with the fast pace of a live presentation. Maybe this would be best reserved for youtube videos.\n\nMy ten day zettel production",

          "description": "In case some haven't been watching, I'll mention that Simon Winchester's new book Knowing What We Know on knowledge to transmission was published by Harper on April 25th in North America. For zettelkasten fans, you'll note that it has some familiar references and suggested readings including by our friends Markus Krajewski, Ann Blair, Iaian McGilchrist, Alex Wright, Anthony Grafton, Dennis Duncan, and Mortimer J. Adler to name but a few.\nMany are certain to know his award winning 1998 book The Professor and the Madman which was also transformed into the eponymous 2019 film starring Sean Penn. Though he didn't use the German word zettelkasten in the book, he tells the story of philologist James Murray's late 1800s collaborative 6 million+ slip box collection of words and sentences which when edited into a text is better known today as the Oxford English Dictionary.\nIf you need some additional motivation to check out his book, I'll use the fact that Winchester, as a writer, is one of the most talented non-linear storytellers I've ever come across, something which many who focus on zettelkasten output may have a keen interest in studying.",

          "description": "I'll go first again. But please take all this as an invitation to share your adventures. As you see, mine are boring and you are probably doing more interesting stuff.\nTypical of when I'm in class, my note take is slowed. More accurately, my refactoring of notes into atomic-sized notes has slowed. I will add as many words to my ZK, but each note is bigger. Because of the speed of the class, I don't feel I have time to refactor the notes I've captured from reading, say, \"Read Hot Epic.\" I keep all the ideas captured from the story in a single note, hoping to atomize the note sometime. In the meantime, I have all the ideas, and because of my search skills, the ideas are not lost.\n@Sascha's article Why the Single Note Matters is a real eye opener. Care and attention must be paid to each and every note. The effort in this practice is what is called zettelkasting. The rewards are a supportive ZK partner. If you consider this a downside, the downside is that this activity siows time. You will naturally slow down. In a non-pressure environment, this is a good thing. Not so sure it works in a classroom setting with a schedule to keep up with.\nI've started a list in my journal of projects to advance once I've completed the food writing seminar. That way, they can be off my mind and safely on a list. (Classic GTD principle)\nI'm reading - Fisher, M. F. K.. The gastronomical me, Penguin Random House Publisher Services. 1989.\n\nMy ten-day zettel production",

          "description": "I recently watched the documentary Aby Warburg: Metamorphosis and Memory (Wechsler, 2016) via Kanopy (for free using my local library’s gateway) and thought that others here interested in the ideas of memory in culture, history, and art history may appreciate it. While a broad biography of a seminal figure in the development of art history in the early 20th century, there are some interesting bits relating to art and memory as well as a mention of Frances A. Yates whose research on memory was influenced by Warburg’s library.\nOf specific \"note” is the fact that Aby Warburg (1866-1929) had a significant zettelkasten-based note taking practice and portions of his collection (both written as well as images) are featured within the hour long documentary.
