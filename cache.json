So here are a few reasons you may consider switching:\n ​\n - More \"hasqly\" API featuring Session where appropriate.\n - No dependency on hasql-pool.\n - Safer identifier escaping that uses PQescapeIdentifier() rather than a custom Haskell implementation.\n - More minimal/fundamental poll / await combinators for receiving notifications, rather than a monolithic waitForNotifications that accepts a callback.\n - Correct reconnection handling: it's possible for a libpq connection object to be temporarily disconnected from Postgres, and this library will not throw an exception in this case.\n - Backend PID from notification payload is not thrown away.\n ​\n Thanks and don't hesitate to file an issue or ask a question.\n    submitted by    /u/mdgsvp  \n [link]   [comments]",

I used to develop in many programming languages such as Rust, Ruby, Python, C++, C#, Java, Kotlin and Swift. So I got used to all those programming approaches, design patterns etc. After all, I had seen the functional programming way and really loved the idea and that gave me another way of thinking. I'm still learning. \n I think I understood what a monad is, even that knowledge helped me in oop way of programming. And now I'm learning about monad transformers. I have read a few blogs and pages about them but they are still not that clear to me. \n Could anyone please explain those to me? Maybe with examples or comparisons to oop. \n Because such questions always have answers out there but they are usually either so high level therefore only the ones who have experience in the field can understand or so basic examples and information that no one can properly understand the \"needs\" and the importance of it so it becomes useless. It is why I'm asking here to the community. \n Thank you for your answers in advance\n    submitted by    /u/akirova  \n [link]   [comments]",

I thought this would be fairly straightforward.\n Here is a distilled version of my attempt:\n data As = A1 | A2 | A3 data Bs = B1 | B2 | B3 type A = As type B = Bs \n And then, despite the appearance of various syntactic innovations, I've had no success. Essentially, I'd like to do something of the sort: type C = A | B, but that does not work.\n So my questions are:\n  \nIf there is a way to properly do this, how to do so?\n \nIf there is not -- why not? Haskell is very well thought out and so there must be some reason for disallowing such action. Perhaps it's not so much that the action is itself problematic, but that it would interfere with other language semantics. In any case, I'm curious what the reason is. \n \n Edited: As an aside: the project I'm working on involves parsing. As such, I wanted to create a simple parse tree for a basic 'arithmetic grammar', as in \"3 + 2 - 5\", etc. To start off, I wanted to create a binary tree and within that tree I wanted the nodes to be able to hold types that were either binary operations or numbers. I don't think this is optimal, but it was what was driving the original attempt. The project is in large part for learning as well. So upon trying to do something like: type NodeVal = Op | Val, errors arise. I'm adding this aside for some context.\n Thank you.\n    submitted by    /u/Ellipsoider  \n [link]   [comments]",

The same code works on Linux, so I'm assuming this is a longstanding Windows issue given all the warnings I've seen about using Haskell on Windows. And the same thing happens on every GHC version I've tried (8.8.4, 8.10.7, 9.2.5, and 9.4.4).\n The error message is `Access violation in generated code when executing data at 0x7ffd3aa06366` with a stack trace that points to an invocation of a method inside a struct field. The weird thing is that if I call the same method in the same Haskell function that the struct is created, it works fine. Which makes it sound like the struct got destroyed or relocated in memory. But if I print the C struct's address and the address of all of its method field, they're exactly the same as when it was created.\n My first thought was that the garbage collector had freed up its space, but that shouldn't be possible since there is a persistent reference to the struct stored in an `IORef`. And using `StablePtr` didn't have any impact.\n Anyone run into something like this before, or have better ideas how to debug it?

          "description": "I was reading through https://www.fpcomplete.com/blog/2018/04/async-exception-handling-haskell/ where the author claims it is never safe to recover from asynchronous exceptions. The safe-exceptions package also claims it.\n Now, I'm not sure what recovering means here, but if it really means catching an exception, doing something and not re-throwing it all the way until the program exits, it sounds extreme. One practical example is as follows: a chat application attempts to send a message to another user, but delivery times out asynchronously, i.e. a caller-imposed timeout. Or perhaps the user cancels the action by pressing a button. Whatever was trying to send the message should do its own cleanup and rethrow, via bracket. However, at some point the application is going to have to present an error gracefully to the user and ignore the exception, not just clean up and crash. Or maybe it wants to reattempt delivery at a later point.\n So, what does it really mean that recovering from async exceptions isn't safe? In the previous example, it's true that one might not trivially know whether the action completed, failed or did something inbetween, but recovery is still theoretically possible, e.g.: explicit state syncing or reporting back what step failed (did we receive an acknowledgement from the server or did we cancel before?). Perhaps it means that recovery cannot always happen locally and you might often need to propagate exceptions upwards. But taken to the extreme, it seems to imply that async exceptions must always result in a crash, albeit a safe one.\n    submitted by    /u/edgmnt_net  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I am looking for a PostgreSQL only database library that can be easily used by Haskell beginner. It is not for me specifically but few of the college undergraduate students I intend to mentor. They would be building a typical multi-tenancy system, so you can expect typical, `tenant`, `user`, `emails`, `clients`, etc. kind of models/tables. And of course, the application domain entities.\n Avoiding the cost of learning EDSL that many Haskell DB libraries provide, I found out that only postgresql-typed and postgresql-simple allow to write only raw SQL queries easily. As I extensively use pgtyped for production Node.js application, I am thinking about using postgresql-typed. While I could find many resources for postgresql-simple, the same cannot be said try for postgresql-typed.\n I was able to get running with postgresql-typed and execute typical CRUD operations, but I fear that it may not support few of the important PostgreSQL constructs down the line. Also, the database must exist at the time of compilation of the project which is different from pgtyped as it generates TypeScript files at development time which we commit in the repository. I also get the feeling that after a while compilation time could increase exponentially as more queries gets added. I am already counting 50+ queries (Good thing is that the queries are not dynamic).\n So, my questions are:\n  \nAre my concerns valid about using postgresql-typed? (Slow compilations, need for DB at compile time, etc.)\n Lack of literature/articles around it? (Building own connection pool abstraction, etc.)\n Or any other recommendation? (Sticking to plain SQL and not EDSL)\n  \n​\n P.S - Kindly redirect me to right forum if this is not a right place.

Given a Haskell function I want to generate a second one that is slightly different, for example:\n foo i [] = [] foo i (x:xs) = i : foo xs \n should allow me to generate\n foo' i [] = 1 foo' i (x:xs) = 1 + foo' xs \n that mirrors the recursive structure of the function. I CAN'T change the original function foo to use something like recursion schemes.\n My initial idea was to use TemplateHaskell, get the name of the function, lookup its definition and then change it accordingly. But as the documentation states\n  \nThe Maybe Dec field contains Just the declaration which defined the variable - including the RHS of the declaration - or else Nothing, in the case where the RHS is unavailable to the compiler. At present, this value is always Nothing: returning the RHS has not yet been implemented because of lack of interest.\n  \nSo my second guess was to use write a QuasiQuoter and surround the original function with it. I can use ghc-exactprint to parse the function, but that gives me a HsSyn AST, not a template haskell AST.

The output appears to be complaining about which GHC I am using. In short, I am wondering whether there is any up-to-date, authoritative guide I can follow to fix my configuration so I can work through this stuff. Examples on the web seem to be mostly a bit old and piecemeal.\n    submitted by    /u/bhliebs93  \n [link]   [comments]",

Second, there's a whole logic to what files should be read: either you want to read only one file, and the application should try each directory for the category and give you the content of the first file that is available, or you want all available files merged together. Also, relative paths in the environment variables should be ignored.\n So I created xdg-basedir-compliant. It was fun to create because thanks to Polysemy, I could easily do TDD with non-IO interpreters.\n I hope the API is practical.

The idea of Scala's partial function/currying should hold here (i.e. when applying a single value x_i, return a function that is defined only for a subset of its input domain). For example, when n = 2 define f(x, y) = sin(x + y), then trivially, f(2, y) = sin(2 + y).\n  \nHowever, the dimension (n > 0) may vary from case to case and may even be provided in input. Partial application for n = 2 is:\n def leftPartialFunction(f: (Double, Double) => Double)(x: Double): Double => Double = f(x, _) \n but how can this be generalized for arbitrary n?\n For example, how can I apply the function in position i?Something like this I assume would not work ...\n def partialFunction(f: IndexedSeq[Double] => Double)(xi: Double): IndexedSeq[Double] => Double = .... // cannot work well with indexed seq as they are not \"disjoint\" \n ​\n    submitted by    /u/dns281784  \n [link]   [comments]",

I would envision my requirement being met if the slick abstractions would be mixins, and my class StorableCoffee would extend Coffee and mix into itself the storage features from slick.\n Then I would be able to pass into the domain model StorableCoffee, but to the model that would just be a Coffee.\n So since I've never coded in scala, my questions are:\n  \nis it possible to achieve my goal without convoluted scala3 artifacts and slick or another library?\n if not, what are the possible hacks I could employ?\n  \n   submitted by    /u/flavius-as  \n [link]   [comments]",

Surprisingly, age is a huge deal breaker when finding jobs, especially DEV jobs in Korea. And it's hard to find Scala jobs in my home country because only few people are using it, and I prefer to work in English environment.\n I would say my skill is in somewhere between beginner and mid level (hoping it's learning toward to mid). I have limited experience in Cats or IO like that, but I am happy to use it and learn it more. And I can do some front-end dev also.\n Is there any good countries to find Scala jobs more easily? In my view defining 'GOOD' is,\n  \nplaces where plenty of find jobs exists\n gives working visa easily\n decent salaries\n  \nI think 1 and 2 is most important, 3 is somewhat negotiable.\n I know economy is not good recently, but what else I can do, I need money.\n Thanks in advance.\n    submitted by    /u/peno8  \n [link]   [comments]",

The examples, however, show only observables that change their state via user action or timer ticks.\n I think I need to somehow create an Observable that would represent the query, so that when the query succeeds/fails the content of the page gets updated accordingly. I was thinking about using http4s library as this is what I use on the backend, but the documentation for http4s describes only very simple case of client code, where the calls are represented by IO[String] values that are synchronously executed.

          "description": "I am watching this great talk by Daniel Spiewak motivating effects. In particular, there is a point where he mentions that you can't do retries with Future, but you can with effects. Of course you literally can do retries with futures (e.g. here), but you risk repeating side-effects that aren't properly contained in a transaction. Why is this not the case for effects?\n Example: say I want to log a statement then read a value from a database. In the case of a future retry, suppose the first attempt logs successfully then fails to read. The retry logs the statement again then reads from the database (successfully), resulting in two logs instead of 1. Why would an effects implementation only log once, supposing the same scenario?\n    submitted by    /u/The-_Captain  \n [link]   [comments]",

I was able to convert my markdown files to org, using pandoc and following some online answers about removing the property drawers that pandoc creates and automating the conversion.\n The admittedly vague question that I have is how to use the tools of org mode to help organize the information. In obsidian I used tags, included nested tags. (I also had some \"structure notes\" for topics linking to notes) But I wonder what is a good way to do this in org. I'm focused right now on transferring my literature notes, which are notes on one article, book, or chapter. Should I use properties instead of tags? \n Would anyone be willing to share how they structure their literature notes (or anything similar)? Examples would be great.\n I should also say that I'm currently using citar and am considering using denote (and citar-denote). So if anyone is using those tools and have advice on setting that up, it would also be appreciated.\n    submitted by    /u/encomun  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I've been learning org mode and this year is the ear I want to fully dump my notion based system and migrate into org-mode. Most things I have figured out how to solve but I wanted to get a temperature check on how best to save myself duplicate data entry as I manage my daily/weekly/monthly/quarterly reviews. \n The Goal\n Each day I will use org-roam daily capture template to generate a form with two main sections: \n  \nMorning Stack\n Evening Stack\n  \nThese will be largely data capture and routine outlines for myself. I'll likely utilize a 'metric' capture with gnuplot for things like my weight, sleep rating, mood etc. Direct links to my repeated routines i.e. mindset, gratitude type stuff. \n In Notion I currently will use the relational database system to have each thing nested and rolled into each other so for example my weekly review has each of the 7 days of that week linked into it and I use a database roll up to grab the data entries for easy review that week. \n In this at the end of each week I have a baseline of information of what happened that week ready to review, it also has some of its own higher level routines & processes built in there too. \n I've considered using org-refile copy but its a little bit more of a manual process. I'm thinking some of that might be able to be automated either through some elisp or macros. However, before I go through doing all of that I figured I'd ask here for any insight since many of you are much more familiar with org and its tricks than I am.\n Ultimately I want to roll from daily into annual.

I'd like to also include estimate vs actual effort. \n I'd like to be able to review a list of tasks (buffer only or across multiple files) to determine the difference between when they were created, time to completion, and time active (in a certain state).

I love dired-do-kill-lines to pare down my directory listings as I work on them. \n In the same spirit, I wrote the following (naive) function for getting rid of lines in the org-agenda. \n (defun alec-org-agenda-kill-line () \"Kills a line from an org agenda, like `dired-kill-line'. It does so naively, so be careful using this!\" (interactive) (read-only-mode -1) (delete-region (line-beginning-position) (line-end-position)) (delete-char 1) (read-only-mode 1)) (define-key org-agenda-mode-map (kbd \"M-k\") #'alec-org-agenda-kill-line) \n I've used it a bit and love it so far. For now I've just got this defun for killing one line at a time.

I'm trying to enter this so that it shows in my org-agenda. I've done this in the following way:\n * TODO Biology class <2023-01-31 Tue 10:00-12:00 +1w> :PROPERTIES: :LAST_REPEAT: [2023-03-18 Sat 0:00] :END: * TODO Biology class <2023-02-03 Tue 10:00-12:00 +1w> :PROPERTIES: :LAST_REPEAT: [2023-03-18 Sat 0:00] :END: \n When I activate the agenda view and go to yearly view (via the command org-agenda-year-view) I see the entries every Tuesday and Friday at the right time, but I also see them appear well beyond the LAST_REPEAT date that I fixed inside the PROPERTIES section.\n So my question is: am I understanding wrong the usage of LAST_REPEAT? Is this the expected behavior? What should I do to make those entries not show beyond a given day (i.e., once my courses are over)?\n Besides my particular question, I'm open to any suggestions as to how I could be doing this in a better/more practical way. I'm reading the manual online and this is what I've came up with, but it might be far from optimal.\n Thanks in advance for all your help.\n    submitted by    /u/Gus_Gustavsohn  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "For consult users (or the consult curious) minad just added a wonderful new feature to consult: consult-info. I bind it to M-s i. You can choose one or more info manuals to search (comma separated), and then it acts much like consult-grep and friends, searching over the info nodes. \n Really great for quickly peeking at some topic without the usual rigamarole of entering Info. It's also simple to bind a key to a command to go right to searching your most used info nodes.\n If you add embark into the mix, the power amplifies again: you can narrow down to just the search terms you want using the regular consult \"two stage\" filtering (e.g #process#async), then embark-export these live filtered results to a Collections buffer, effectively building your own clickable custom index (or three) for the topic(s) you are investigating.\n Clearly the fastest way to RTFM.

Say I have in project A a .projectile; whenever I start emacs, I can do projectile-switch-to-project and I can choose project A out of the list.\n Here, say in project A, I open many files: fileB, fileC, fileD...etc. Let's say I have fileB takes up the whole window (via C-x 0) . I can then easily switch between existing files that I have opened with projectile-display-buffer . I can then choose the buffer/files I want and press Enter. This is all good.\n The problem is this would switch to that buffer but split the screen horizontal. Using the current example, I have fileB and using projectile-display-buffer and pick fileC would result in a horizontal split: fileB on the left, fileC on the right.

          "description": "I am confused by the Tramp documentation regarding the auto save feature. According to the documentation (emphasis mine):\n  \n4.20 Auto-save, File Lock and Backup configuration \n To avoid TRAMP from saving backup files owned by ‘root’ to locations accessible to others, default backup settings in backup-directory-alist have to be altered. \n Here’s a scenario where files could be inadvertently exposed. Emacs by default writes backup files to the same directory as the original files unless changed to another location, such as ~/.emacs.d/backups/. Such a directory will also be used by default by TRAMP when using, say, a restricted file /su:root@localhost:/etc/secretfile. The backup file of the secretfile is now owned by the user logged in from TRAMP and not ‘root’. \n When backup-directory-alist is nil (the default), such problems do not occur. \n  \nFirst, it states that the default value of backup-directory-alist must be changed to avoid saving root files as a normal user in a local directory.\n But then, it says that it does not happen with the default value.\n When running Emacs (both -q and -Q, master from Dec 4th), it behaves like the first paragraph: when opening a file using su (or remote ssh+su), it warns about writing a local backup and aborts opening if you say no. Therefore, it looks like the last sentence \"When backup-directory-alist is nil (the default), such problems do not occur. \" is wrong.\n Is it actually wrong, or am I misunderstanding it?\n    submitted by    /u/noi-gai  \n [link]   [comments]",

This makes it easier to keep tracks of prompts because you'll always see the prompt associated with every line of output currently visible in the buffer.

I am not a power user of Emacs with C++, but for what I understood LSP with clangd is now pretty mature. Moreover, IIUC, LSP provides code navigation via Emacs' xref.\n Historically the usual way to explore code was using a tag utility, like ctags, etags, rtags or gtags. I've tried searching online, but the resources I found are pretty outdated, and I suspect they are not even aware of LSP.\n So the question is:\n  \nwould you say an external program is still the best way to explore C++'s code on Emacs, or is clangd + xref enough? Is it becoming the de facto standard? Is there something that a tag program can do but clangd can't (or viceversa)?\n \nI have heard that C++ code can be quite difficult to index, due to complex include nests, preprocessor directives and what else (because C++!). Is this problem still relevant in 2023? If yes, what solution handles it best?\n \n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/alessandrobertulli  \n [link]   [comments]",

By default it shows the information in the echo area through eldoc, which is not quite convenient because usually it's far from where the cursor is. A better solution is provided by eldoc-box, which shows information in a child frame, like this.\n As can be seen in the screenshot, the child frame blocks some part of the window. I'm wondering if possible to set the child frame transparent so that I can see the code below. I tried to set eldoc-box-frame-parameters with (alpha . 0.5) but it has no effect. What do I miss?\n Moreover, the eglot shows the information with some formatting. There is a long line separating different kinds of information, which is fine for the echo area, but in the child frame, it is wrapped into several pieces, occupying additional lines. I'm curious if there is a way to change the format. \n Another question which is related is that the documentation is truncated. I'd rather to see a long child frame to show all the information, which is usually possible if there is no redundant things like the wrapped line. I cannot find an option in eglot to turn off the truncation. Is there any solution for this problem?\n Thanks for reading this long post!\n    submitted by    /u/linwaytin  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "When Emacs 28 was about to come out, I remember John Wiegley said something like it took on average about 30 minutes for a user to natively compile it. Later on I also came across one online article saying it takes a lot more time to do native compilation.\n But according to my experience, on my mediocre desktop, it probably takes less than 10 minutes for native compilation. And I wonder if I'm doing it in a correct way. I run `./configure --with-native-compilation` then `make -j$(nproc)`. I also tried `make NATIVE_FULL_AOT=1 -j$(nproc)` per EmacsWiki. But the compilation time is always very well under 10 minutes. After compilation, the evaluation of (native-comp-available-p) returns t.\n Am I doing it correctly or am I missing something?\n    submitted by    /u/shadowsock  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I am a mathematics graduate student who has been dabbling with Emacs for a little under a year, on and off. I have the following use case, and I've felt a little overwhelmed at the possible choices of packages, so I'd like some advice on how to set up something that works for me.\n In my studies I often find myself encountering problems and ideas that I had thought about a long time ago, but can no longer reconstruct. What I'd like to create is a system where I can dash off my summary of a theorem or proof technique that I encounter, and be able to link these documents to each other. More specifically, I'd like to have a big folder filled with LaTeX files (or org files) that are tagged somehow so I don't have to keep track of them myself. I want to be able to refer to specific theorems/definitions/equations in other files in the system, as I would in LaTeX. And, importantly, I want to be able to produce a nicely formatted PDF from a selection of these files, with all the internal links to equations, definitions etc. working properly. So for example if this semester I'm studying harmonic analysis, I want to produce notes on all the theorems and techniques I pick up, and by the end I should be able to stitch them together in a PDF. If next semester something I'm studying relies on one of those theorems, I want to still be able to point to the corresponding file and again include it in a different PDF. A nice plus would be the ability to smoothly manage citations and references to books, papers etc.\n There are packages in the so-called personal knowledge management ecosystem (org-roam, deft, org-brain, Zetteldeft etc.) that seem to do what I'm looking for. I'd appreciate anyone who's tried out a bunch of them giving their opinion on what makes the most sense to do. If anyone's done something similar, any advice, links or helpful blog posts describing your setup would be very appreciated.\n    submitted by    /u/gerretsen  \n [link]   [comments]",

((lambda (tag) (svg-tag-make tag :inverse t :radius 12)))) (\"#\\\\+BEGIN_SRC \\\\(perl\\\\)\" . ((lambda (tag) (svg-tag-make tag :inverse t :radius 12)))) ) ) \n As you can see the lambda expression for the languages is exactly the same in both cases, so I wondered if it was possible to factor that out and try something like this:\n ​\n  (fset #'mh/myl (lambda (tag) (svg-tag-make tag :inverse t :radius 12)) (setq svg-tag-tags '( (\"#\\\\+BEGIN_SRC \\\\(elisp\\\\)\" . ((lambda (tag) (svg-tag-make tag :inverse t :radius 12)))) (\"#\\\\+BEGIN_SRC \\\\(perl\\\\)\" . ((lambda (tag) (svg-tag-make tag :inverse t :radius 12)))) (\"#\\\\+BEGIN_SRC \\\\(python\\\\)\" . (#'mh/myl) ) ) \n So the idea is to store the lambda in the function-slot of a symbol and then use that symbol instead of the lambda but for reasons that are beyond me it does not work. (If it worked for python you would of course use this approach for all the other languages as well and then would only need to update one place should you ever want to change the appearence of the svgs).\n I have tried every conceivable permutation of quoting (or not quoting), of sprinkling in some call to symbol-function etc but I cannot make it work. Some variations compile fine but in the end none of them work.\n And I wonder: Why does this not work? What is it that I do not understand about symbols and lambdas?\n And what would be the proper way to do that (provided it is possible at all)?\n Many thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/ghiste  \n [link]   [comments]",

TAG is either a SVG image that will be displayed using the 'display property or a function that accepts a unique string argument (match-string 1) and returns an SVG image. \n The second part about the function in TAG is clear and that is what all of the examples use.\n But what does \" a SVG image that will be displayed using the 'display property\" mean?\n Assuming mysvg is a variable holding an svg I would have guessed that it should be one of this variants but none work:\n (setq svg-tag-tags '( (\"PATTERN1\" .

('display mysvg)) (\"PATTERN3\" . mysvg) ) ) \n Here is the code for mysvg:\n  (setq mysvg (svg-create 80 80 :stroke-width 5)) (svg-circle mysvg 40 40 25 :stroke-color \"red\") \n So how is that supposed to work - does anybody understand this?\n Many thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/ghiste  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "As a good emacs citizen I've been delving deeper and deeper into integrating emacs to my tasks. Fiddling with some basic elisp (not a programmer) I could facilitate a lot of repetitive stuff I got to do in my masters and in my professional work. It's beautiful.\n Now, there's another thing I would like to do. As a masters student, it's important to always check a lot of websites from the government and research institutions to look for opportunities. There might be some useful notice about a financial support, or a important upcoming event etc. Looking for these, I have to manually check at least a couple dozen websites weekly, and I'm getting tired of doing all this work manually. It usually goes like this: copy a link from a list, paste into the browser, leading to a news page from some research institution, check if there's a new entry, go to the next link...\n Does anyone have a cool idea of how this could be done more easily? I thought about RSS feeds, but a lot of the websites don't have them. Also thought about doing some scripting with EWW, in a way that it goes jumping around a given list of websites so that at least I can speed up all the checking. It would also be really cool if there's a way to check if a given link has changed overtime, maybe by downloading the html's to a temp directory and comparing the files?\n Either way, it's something that would be really useful for years and years to come. Does anyone have a suggestion?\n    submitted by    /u/tmting  \n [link]   [comments]",

It's not lost on me that it's a bit old but I've failed to figure out any solution to a question I had.\n ​\n I had to make an adjustment to the capture template as it was creating each new TODO in as a sub-level of tasks.\n (setq org-capture-templates '((\"t\" \"Todo [inbox]\" entry (file \"~/org/gtd/inbox.org\") \"* TODO %i%?\") (\"T\" \"Tickler\" entry (file+headline \"~/org/gtd/tickler.org\" \"Tickler\") \"* %i%? \\n %U\"))) \n Now I've working through refile and I've noticed that refile only allows me to move the current item to a sub-item in the existing defined file. This makes sense in some cases, however, I think it'd be more useful to be able to create new top level headings in the gtd.org file. Say a new project emerges is one case....\n ​\n I have tried change the max level setting, to no avail as well as setting \n org-outline-path-complete-in-steps \n which did appear to work at first, but this was unsuccessful as well. \n ​\n So I'm curious, am I thinking about this the wrong way (as a general practice in org-mode... ) or have a messed up some settings here.\n ​\n I'll add that I'm completely open to advice in org mode and even my GTD process (I'm new to both.... although I read the book years ago)\n    submitted by    /u/Neat_Objective  \n [link]   [comments]",

What is the best approach for that? Is there any way to make the hook aware of its context?\n ​\n Some more info about my use-case: this is for my work-in-progress package sticky-shell, whose main purpose is to define a minor mode in a shell buffer, displaying a header with the latest prompt. This makes it easier to keep track of which command was run, even in cases where the command has many lines of output. I've noticed that, some times, the command can be quite long and not fit within a single header-line. For these cases, I've come up with `sticky-shell-shorten-header-mode', which is an additional mode shortening the header.\n I would like this additional mode to be \"tied\" to the sticky-shell-mode, so that when sticky-shell-mode is disabled, sticky-shell-shorten-header-mode is also automatically disabled. \n I'd also like users to be able to turn on/off shorten-header-mode whenever they want, and choose whether to run a sticky-shell-mode hook to automatically enable the shorten-header-mode every time they enable sticky-shell-mode.\n In my mind, all of these features would be accomplished by keeping the two as separate modes, and constructing a hook for sticky-shell-mode that will be context-aware, so that when sticky-shell-mode is enabled the hook automatically enables shorten-header (if the user opts in to this feature), and when sticky-shell-mode is disabled, the hook automatically disables shorten-header.\n ​\n Does anybody have suggestions for this?

          "description": "Hello all,\n I have been using Emacs for a while now, and had set it up very well to suit my old Ubuntu system (used Emacs 27.1). Now having switched to Mac, I am facing several issues. I am unsure whether it is due to the usage of the 28.2 Emacs version or the Mac that is causing these issues. I have listed them all below. Please provide any help you can for any of the issues.\n  \nWhen I do C-x 5 f , the new frame which is opened has the default settings of font and not what is on my ~/.emacs . However the theme (cobalt-blue) is as defined on my init file. The piece of code I use for font is (set-frame-font \"Monospace Bold\") . Is this sufficient to keep the font same across all buffers and frames I open on my Emacs? If not, how do I fix this issue? If you think there is something else that is overriding this command and leading to my problem, please let me know. I will provide more details from my init file.\n To open Emacs from terminal I followed the steps provided here. However, I am unable to open a specific Emacs file from my terminal. Whenever I try to do emacs file.py it opens the only the emacs GUI front page without loading the contents of file.py. It says on the terminal -bash: .emacs: Permission denied. How do I fix this issue and open the file.py on Emacs?\n The keyboard for Mac is different from the one I used for my Ubuntu system. The Command key plays the role of the Control key here, but has many more features. I added the line (setq mac-command-modifier 'control) to map my Command key to Emacs control key. However, this messes up everything because the fundamental operations using Command key (such as closing files using Command-q ) is not working. So is there a good key mapping (For Control and Meta keys) for Emacs for MacOS that someone can suggest?\n  \n   submitted by    /u/InstinctsInFlow  \n [link]   [comments]",

As far as I know these aren't easily achievable from Finder or the command line, so it's nice to have an Emacs interface for them.\n Sharing here in case people are interested: it needs some more work (see some of the TODOs in the code for example), but I could turn this into a proper package. Any feedback on the code is welcome.\n I'm also wondering if people can think of different ways to achieve this: Emacs has been around for a long time so I'm sure it has some functionalities to deal with remote files already.

However, solving simple issues like enabling pdf-mode or even making use some of the org-mode features feels like a struggle.\n I have hard time actually understanding the internal documentation of emacs - a similar feeling I had with linux when I started. That made me realise how the most valuable resources for learning linux were community created guides and users explaining how they do things: and especially how they refer to documentation.\n Where can I find similar resources for emacs? I mainly am interested in personalising orgmode, like creating templates and macro commands. But also more fundamental things such as where to store work-files, and how to separate personal use of orgmode.\n    submitted by    /u/stepbroImstuck_in_SU  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Good morning,\n I have been struggling with company for awhile and have read the docs on company and still haven't come up with the solution to the problem I've got. I've searched for solutions to this, but not unexpectedly, searching for emacs company doesn't really get to frequency discussions of the company.el module because company is such a common business word. Anyway, I am open to other suggested completion methods or frameworks, I'm not married to it. First I'll describe the problem:\n I'll be writing code and it'll try to suggest completion. I don't have a good screenshot of this, but sometimes I want to complete something like: my_long_signal_name. I start typing and the suggestions and the completion company provides is my_loNG_SIGNAL_NAME. It doesn't appear to correctly maintain the case of the original it's retrieving the suggestion from. \n I thought this was something to do with the dabbrev module, but honestly I thought I told it how to handle cases in the configuration and this clearly isn't helping.\n (message \"---- Company\") (use-package company :config (setq company-dabbrev-ignore-case 'keep-prefix) (setq company-dabbrev-downcase nil)) (use-package company-statistics :hook (after-init-hook . global-company-mode) (after-init-hook . company-statistics-mode)) \n For awhile I just got rid of it. Emacs vhdl-mode has tab-completion that works pretty well, just doesn't provide the dropdown which is nice if there's some confusion as to selection.\n Anyone have a SANE company setup that preserves the case of the suggestion? I have thought maybe I ought to use the etags backend perhaps, and like I said, I've gotten rid of it for awhile, though I do like it's path name suggestions in other non-source code documents so I'd kind of like it back.\n Also open to other completion modules, company just is generally frequently recommended.\n Any ideas on how to properly setup company or another module for this behavior?

I currently have a home brewed config that's simple enough for my usage that I don't need to rely on the daemon to speed up opening a frame. It should take less than a second but recently for some reason when I open Emacs on KDE the task bar shows the icon for Emacs that then closes to give place to what I think it's the Emacs Client simply because the title bar shows \"Emacs (Client) *scratch\\*\" but every process monitor shows it's a regular Emacs instance.\n This didn't happen before. I've been using Emacs frequently and after about a month of continuous usage I began experiencing this behaviour. No matter how I start Emacs, from command line, from the apps menu, from a key combo shortcut. Always the same.\n I tried hiding the emacsclient.desktop file from my user's menu with no luck. This happens in KDE regardless of distro. I have an Arch, Manjaro, Garuda and openSUSE TW, all with KDE and all behaving the same. Even when I completely remove my customization files, the regular, old, white Emacs shows the same behaviour. None of these machines have used the daemon/emacsclient in their current installations so I know there's no lingering config from the past.\n Any idea where I can look and/or explain this behaviour.\n    submitted by    /u/xplosm  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I'm working with a server that requires a password and one-time code to log in over ssh (no key-based login possible), and this does basically work with tramp after adding the OTP-prompt to `password-word-equivalents`.\n However, tramp is having trouble filling in the password automatically even though it does find a corresponding entry in `auth-sources` (I'm using the `pass` backend which works fine). I think the issue is that the server _first_ asks for the one-time code, and _then_ for the password.\n Thanks to the power of the recursive minibuffer, I'm able to call `password-store-otp-token-copy` and `password-store-copy` when tramp asks for one-time code and password, search for the right entry, then paste the code/password back to the prompt.\n Ideally, I would like to \"teach\" tramp to find the password on its own so I don't need to manually find and paste it every time. Is there a way of telling it which secret to use for which prompt? Alternatively, would it be possible somehow wrap the login process in an elisp function that automates the task?\n I'm asking here since I'm a little bit stuck on where / what to look for in the tramp / auth-source source code; I've read the manual pretty extensively but can't find much on the topic. Luckily it's not a huge issue since the ssh connection is re-used for subsequent logins so I only have to do this once or twice a day, but automating the login process would still be a nice improvement.\n Thanks in advance for the help!\n    submitted by    /u/real_complex  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I am trying to get a Jupyter-like experience in org mode using org mode. I mostly followed the \"Replacing Jupyter Notebook with Org Mode\" blog post by sqrtminusone and added some additional config to have conda-environment-aware IDE features in Python mode. You can see my current config here: https://github.com/martibosch/snakemacs \n The issue is that, although python-mode is activated within jupyter-python src blocks, I do not get proper indentation when I use the tab key. This is expected since org-src-tab-acts-natively is set to nil in my config (following the config by sqrtminusone. However, if I set it to t, everytime I use the RET and TAB keys (bound to org-return and org-cycle respectively) within jupyter-python src blocks, I get the switch-to-buffer behavior (e.g., conda environment activation from conda.el), which makes the editing slow and completely unpractical (tons of \"Switched to conda environment\" messages). \n How can I get TAB indentation in my jupyter-python blocks without having this switch-to-buffer behavior?

In particular, I can't seem to be comfortable with the behavior of consult-line. By default, it lists the candidates from point on, and candidates above point in the buffer are listed below, after the end of buffer one. This seems odd to me (or my preferences), and I'd like the search in the minibuffer to mirror the actual buffer: what is above is above, what is below is below. There exists the option consult-line-start-from-top, which I tried, and indeed organizes things this way.

          "description": "I have released a slightly updated version of labrat, a simple command-line program for printing labels with little cermony and that can be invoked from within Emacs or from a shell.\n You can read about it and how to install it on github here.\n This is from the README:\n \n  \nMotivation\n  \nI need to print labels. And in my case, mostly I need file folder labels. I typically want to print to a Dymo LabelWriter, of which I own several variants. The problem is that I work almost entirely in Linux, but the simple task of printing a file folder label has required opening a GUI application, such as the very fine glabels, or worse, switching to a machine running Windows or to a Mac to run Dymo’s proprietary GUI. The Dymo GUI is particularly irksome because it takes a long time to start up and demands that you register every time you open it.\n I wanted a way to print a file label from the command line, or even better, from within my editor, Emacs. After giving up looking for such a thing without success, I decided to write my own. Hence labrat. With it—after due configuration—printing a file folder label is as simple as:\n $ labrat 'First Line of Label-->And the Second Line'\n Or, you can preview the label in your previewer of choice (mine is qpdfview) by adding the -V flag:\n $ labrat -V 'First Line of Label-->And the Second Line'\n Even better, I have included with labrat an elisp file (labrat.el) that will invoke labrat to form a label with the text of the paragraph at or before point. So within Emacs, you can bind keys to the commands, labrat-print and labrat-view to print or view the current or prior paragraph as your default label. Thus, in Emacs, I have C-z C-l C-l bound to labrat-print and C-z C-l C-v to labrat-view, and I can type a label in any buffer and get it generated with very little ceremony.\n    submitted by    /u/lstrang  \n [link]   [comments]",

Here is a view of categories, subcategories and wiki page. It's very easy to navigate to any page I want by traversing the category tree. Organically, the categories and subcategories evolve over time. A wiki page can be under multiple (sub) categories.\n Category Tree in MediaWiki\n But installing MediaWiki means I need webserver+php+mysql stack, which I want to avoid if possible. If I have to backup, replicate, migrate, and update MediaWiki to a new machine it's not going to be easy. On top of this MediaWiki wiki syntax also sucks. Despite all these headaches, I still see this setup as valuable for providing me with category tree navigation and knowledge hierarchy.\n I know there is org-roam but it's not providing me these kind of dynamic category trees and allow a page to have multiple parents. For me these category hierarchies are more important than back links.\n I can use projectile + nested folders but I want the ability to one sub category available under multiple parent category. Creating and managing symlinks may work but it won't scale if I have 300+ wiki pages which should be filed under multiple parent categories.\n MediaWiki also provides a breadcrumb of clickable category links like below:\n Wiki > Subjects > Computer Science > Programming Languages > Clojure\n Is it possible to achieve \n  \nsimilar Category hierarchy, \n navigable dynamic category tree and\n multi-parent subcategories (i.e a category or page can belong to multiple parent categories)\n  \nany ideas/pointers to solve this with Emacs?\n    submitted by    /u/sagopi  \n [link]   [comments]",

OS, with Emacs installed from terminal, emacs 27.1.\n I posted a few months ago about getting Vuiet set up. I liked it a lot, but it was very minimalistic. Really only good for mindlessly playing a handful of tracks, and at that, you kinda had to know who you were looking for. It also had a few weaknesses, like constantly throwing up my debugger every time a particular song's lyrics couldn't be found.\n I finally gave in and switched to Spotify from YT Music since my partner uses it, and also I discovered Smudge, which looks awesome!\n ​\n Thing is, it doesn't actually work, because some functions are not defined yet. Something something spacemacs lazy loading. I'm not sure how to fix this but I know Spacemacs has some behavior which causes packages to not be completely loaded if they're not invoked - I think somehow this is what's causing the issue.\n So, I try to run: `global-smudge-remote-mode`\n This is the output:\n `smudge-connect-player-status` not defined.\n Any attempt to run another smudge function then causes emacs to hang indefinitely and it must be killed (That's dangerous!!!)\n I also noticed that when I first launch emacs, I only have access to functions which are defined in `smudge.el`, not ANY of the dozen or so other .el files included with this repository.\n Only smudge.el functions on startup.\n So I'm hoping this is a relatively simple configuration change I need to make in order to load this package properly and prevent the crashes.

It is split into 3. On the left I have 2 panes with code and on the right I have the repl.\n This setup is fixed. As in, it doesnt really change much. \n I use the terminal heavily for a bunch of coding and non-coding things while I am coding. Having the terminal on a separate window is very quick for me to switch and do something.\n I am curious what other peoples terminal workflow is. How do you integrate the terminal into your workflow? If you use term or v-term, how do you make switching easy and seemless?\n Thanks\n    submitted by    /u/Self-Built  \n [link]   [comments]",

For example:\n ``` -std=gnu99 -I/usr/local/include -I/usr/include -I./include\n Deps produced by cmake\n -I./build/_deps/webp-src/src -I./build/_deps/vec3_static-src/include -I./build/_deps/cglm-src/include ```\n However, it's kind of annoying to keep fiddling with these files all the time. Is there anyway to configure lsp-mode or whoever is complaining about missing C-headers to actually look inside the _deps folder created by cmake, without using a compile_flags.txt?\n Like a global system-wide compile_flags.txt ?\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/heartchoke  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I use org-mode to create many of the documents I produce for both latex and html. However, I am having an issue that is the fault of the University's content management system, and I am hoping there is a quick option in org-mode (though reading through the docs and source, I don't see it).\n Basically, the CMS system first runs the HTML file through its own XML validator, which is rather stupid. There are two errors that prevent it from serving my ox-html output.\n First, the default ox-html mathjax declaration uses:\n <script id=\"MathJax-script\" async src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mathjax@3/es5/tex-mml-chtml.js\"> </script> \n But, technically, the async should be a keyword/value pair, async=\"1\" (value doesn't matter). I can fix that by customizing org-html-mathjax-template.\n Second, the default ox-html mathjax converter leaves the ampersand & character untouched. This is valid and fine, except when one has to go through a stupid XML validator, which says that & is the HTML start of a character code.\n Is there an option to enable ox-html to also convert & to &amp; in mathjax formatting? Obviously, ox-html does that already for text. I can do it after the publish with some elisp, but that seems like a PITA (one I am willing to do though).\n Any suggestions are welcome!\n    submitted by    /u/atomicham  \n [link]   [comments]",

Common Lisp?). Particularly as it relates to concurrent operations, error-handling, and automated testing. I'm guessing it will eventually be beneficial to reach into tools written in Rust and Golang and other languages via methods other than stdout/stderr/stdin but that's down the road a bit.\n So...the ask...any Lisp experts out there have insight as to which Lisp variant might be particularly good for:\n 1) tight integration with Emacs and elisp\n 2) integrating with other third-party APIs and particularly SaaS REST APIs\n 3) ability to leverage non-Lisp ecosystem tooling with a level of effectiveness similar to, say, Python's glue extensions \n Note: Yes, Python is quite effective at this sort of thing itself and I did consider exploring how I could graft Python to elisp for this task. For now, I think I would like to stick with Lisps.

This took a lot of effort and compiling of other libraries to make it work.\n ​\n Emacs GUI comes up and many of my packages start and run. The issue is, the font I want is not being picked up. I want to use Fira Code as a font. The ttf files are installed in my ~/.local/share/fonts directory. I ran fc-cache for the system to detect them. fc-cache says there are 10 fonts in my ~/.local/share/fonts directory. The desktop font selection tool sees them and is able to use them for other GUI elements. \n ​\n When I use Options->Set Default Font it pops up a small GUI that only knows a few fonts. It does not start the system font selection tool. My home PC does bring up the system font selection tool.\n ​\n In my custom-vars.el, which is loaded by init.el I have the following:\n (custom-set-faces\n ;; custom-set-faces was added by Custom.\n ;; If you edit it by hand, you could mess it up, so be careful.\n ;; Your init file should contain only one such instance.\n ;; If there is more than one, they won't work right.\n '(default ((t (:family \"Fira Code\" :foundry \"CTDB\" :slant normal :weight medium :height 113 :width normal)))))\n ​\n This works on my PC at home, but not my RHEL8 computer. There are no messages in the *Messages* buffer and there is no *Warnings* buffer. The GUI comes up and runs with some horrible default font that is hard to read. \n ​\n Any ideas on what I am missing or doing wrong? Is it something I missed in compiling emacs?

Do you jump in and say, \"here take this config file to help make things easier\" or the like?\n This little project was born out of that frustration.\n Presenting, Emacs Bedrock\n Yes, I am an Emacs evangelist, and all around me know it. (Sorry guys.) I vacillate between giving people too much help or too little, I think. The ideal is to encourage new folks just enough to get over the initial hump and get them figuring out what they need to customize to get Emacs to work for their specific needs.\n This is just a little side project for me. I've had the ideas for this bubbling ever since Emacs 29 packed in so many nice features I wondered just how many of my 3rd-party packages I really needed. (Answer: I still have over 100 installed!)\n This package doesn't focus on setting a nice theme (though it does use modus-vivendi) or doing fancy package customization stuff. This aims to be brutally simple so that new users can inspect it and try it out.\n I'd love to get some feedback.

When searching the same files with vim/gvim the search is super fast and I am able to quickly jump through the file and find all patterns matching the string.

Using async it is possible to send email asynchronously, but you may loose your email if something goes wrong. Emacs now has built-in support for sqlite which can be used as a safe and simple mechanism (sqlite supports accessing a DB using multiple processes) for inter-process communication between the main emacs process and the emacs process that async spawns and to persistently store emails to be send and errors that occur during sending. This also enables retrying to send an email that failed to be send. Furthermore, for queued emails we can flush them in parallel. \n I've now put this into a package on github that tries to load mu4e, but does not fail if the user is not using mu4e, but gnus. This should work on Emacs 29 (sqlite support) for any email client that uses the gnus and smtpmail functions to send email. However, since this queues emails in sqlite anything that displays queue sizes would have to be adviced to use async-email-sending--num-queued-emails instead.\n https://github.com/lordpretzel/async-email-sending\n    submitted by    /u/lordpretzelor  \n [link]   [comments]",

If I choose a region in the code window, and run py-execute-region (\"C-c |\"), it's insanely annoying that a new window gets created each time, below the two existing windows, with the same code buffer in it.\n How do I save my sanity? Expected operation would be that the region gets executed in the python buffer, without creating any new windows.\n I'm not sure if I'm using python-mode.el or python.el. Is there any easy way to tell? Is there an easy way to choose one or the other at runtime? I don't see any python-mode.el in my dotemacs, I'm not sure where any non-default version would be loaded.\n I'm running Emacs 25.2.2.\n I found this but wasn't able to solve the problem, sharing it as a starting point for anyone else: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24119221/customize-window-splitting-in-emacs-python-mode\n ​\n Thank you!\n ​\n    submitted by    /u/nasadiya_sukta  \n [link]   [comments]",

I've come up with this note about the difference about the Web and Internet terms and would like some advices on how could I improve it? Maybe I can create specific notes about the definition of Internet and Web and link them? Create a note about the relationship between those two terms? Help me make it better!   \n**Date:** 01/24/2023 (11:21)\n**Tags:** #web #internet\n\n---\n\n# Web and Internet Are Different Terms\n\nIt is common to observe people using the terms _Web_ and _Internet_ in such a way that it appears that both define the same concept: a giant invisible network that interconnects people and realities. However, it is important to understand that both terms have different meanings, although they are connected.\n\nThe Internet is the medium through which all information travels between servers and users. This information, being very general, needed to be contained in standards so that all connected devices could understand and communicate with each other. Therefore, the Internet is made up of applications that exercise this function of regulating communication through protocols.\n\nThe Web is an Internet application. It allows users to interact with servers through websites: interactive pages that allow navigation between files and pages present on the server.\n\n\n## References\n---\nW3Cx. **Introduction to Web Accessibility**: Course Information, Time to practice. edX.\n\nCiriaco, D. **Qual a diferença entre Internet e World Wide Web?** Canaltech.

          "description": "It takes me about 20-30 minutes to create 1 Zettel sometimes because my linking process often involves sifting through my Slipbox to find the right note to place my note behind. As my Slipbox grows, it becomes cumbersome to keep this up.\nI see plenty of posts share abstract advice for linking Zettels together and implementing Folgezettel.\nEach link should create knowledge\nCreate a new Zettel when you're starting to branch into a second idea\n\"Find\" Zettels that match your topic (but don't you dare use the Search function to do it!)\nYou need Folgezettel / you don't need Folgezettel (I personally like the structure, so I've chosen to keep it)\nWhat I'd like to learn from experienced users is this: What are the PHYSICAL steps you take when you've completed a Zettel and you're linking it to your other Zettels?\nBy physical steps, I mean what you actually do, GTD-style Next Actions.\nFor instance, here's my physical action steps.\nSearch my index for the topic of interest\nLook within that cluster to find a Zettel that's either a source of that idea or similar to that idea.\nNumber the new Zettel after the one I chose from #2.\nUse the Obsidian search function for a few keywords within my Zettel to find relevant links, adding context phrases as I do so.\nBut the problem is that as my Slipbox grows, I'll slowly forget the Zettel clusters and may make less-than-ideal connections. Any guidance here would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!",

Meanwhile, the family has something to listen to once in a while without needing to visit. This could e.g. keep grandparents that don't live nearby in touch with their grandchildren, and a kind of conversation going.

We didn't keep going, but revisiting the episodes is so nice. A couple of episodes had her 4 year old siblings too and hearing their tiny little voices and enthusiastic stuttering is bringing us joy.\nI'm glad we did it, and I am now wishing we had more of these sorts of memories.\nhttps://mastodon.social/@screenbeard@aus.social/109630263269445123\n@nighthawk it was just at an age where they had heaps of questions and I could explain stuff to the best of my knowledge.

Here it is without modification.\n\n  \nDescribe a zettelkasten.\nThe zettelkasten system was developed by the German sociologist and philosopher Niklas Luhmann, who used it to store and organize his notes and ideas as he wrote and researched. The name \"zettelkasten\" comes from the German word \"zettel,\" which means \"slip,\" and \"kasten,\" which means \"box.\"\nIn a zettelkasten, each note is given a unique identification number and can be linked to other notes through the use of cross-references. This allows for the creation of a web of interconnected ideas that can be easily navigated and explored.\nThe zettelkasten system has gained popularity in recent years as a tool for organizing and managing knowledge, particularly among writers and researchers. It is seen as a way to facilitate creative thinking and problem-solving by allowing for the easy access and retrieval of ideas and information.",
