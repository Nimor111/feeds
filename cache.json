More background information here. The recent \"Ask Me Anything\" session with the CEO of Reddit didn't really address the concerns of people, and some subreddits decided that they would shutdown indefinitely.\n I think /r/haskell as a community should be discussing what action to take. On a personal level, this subreddit is pretty dear to me, as it has been my go-to place to keep up to date with the Haskell news over the years, and has been an invaluable source of information when I first started learning the language. So I guess my (kind of open-ended) question is: what is the stance of /r/haskell regarding the events happening on the broader Reddit? I am aware that a bunch of communities are migrating to some federated, open-source alternatives, most popular being Lemmy. Would us as a community consider such a mass exodus? The admin of functional.cafe, a Mastodon instance for the FP community, has recently been gauging interest in spinning up a Lemmy instance, maybe some arrangement could be made through cooperative effort?\n I have created this thread to hopefully seed some useful discussion surrounding these. I am looking forward to hear what the community thinks in general.\n    submitted by    /u/lonelymonad  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I've been coding in Haskell for over 6 years and I still feel as if the lack of dot completion (i.e. completion after typing identifier. in the code editor) is the single thing I miss most compared to mainstream languages. In Haskell I find myself constantly jumping to type definitions, searching for documentation, or even grepping the project to recall the name of a function, when in (say) Rust or Typescript I could type foo. and have the editor show me what I need 90% of the time.\n Edit: Here's a concrete example. I was working on some code with a variable vec :: Vector Int and needed to split it into two vectors based on some predicate. I recall that there is a function for doing exactly this, but can't remember the name. In Haskell this is a situation where I usually find myself Googling for the Data.Vector documentation on Hackage. In other languages I would just type vec. and scan through the completion options to find what I need. This sort of thing happens many times per day and I feel like it makes a big difference in productivity.\n    submitted by    /u/polarbearwithagoatee  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I've been looking for a while, but I haven't been able to find \"good\" resources on utilizing laziness effectively in practical Haskell.\n ​\n There's Hutton's explanation in Programming in Haskell, Bird actually seems to go quickly into laziness (chapters 1,2 of Thinking Functionally With Haskell), but I haven't seen anything like, say, a Serokell article on how to manage laziness in practical terms.\n ​\n Maybe I'm just not trying hard enough? What I'm looking for is:\n --Laziness beyond the lazy infinite list (that's just an iterator / generator function with better syntax).\n --How to effectively exploit laziness to improve algorithmic efficiency.\n --How to avoid space leaks mostly reliably.\n --When space leaks occur, best practices in locating and debugging them.\n ​\n I do have Okasaki (Purely Functional Data Structures) and Bird (Algorithm Design with Haskell), but I haven't seriously gone through them. Are those books sufficient to master laziness / non-strictness to go from \"laziness is a 60-40 double-edged sword\" to \"laziness works for me 90+% of the time\"?\n ​\n \n ​\n It matters because, well, you have firms that deliberately choose a strict dialect of Haskell (SC, Mu), you have firms that go to -XStrict by default (NRI, Key.me), and, well, Purescript is strict, Idris is strict; Haskell is rare in making non-strict / lazy evaluation its default, and as functional programming becomes increasingly mainstream, Haskell's main long-term selling point will be its experiment with lazy-by-default.\n ​\n However, lazy-by-default is best known for the resulting space leaks, not for its expressiveness advantages. For I myself, I'd like to have a list of resources to understand how to get pervasive laziness not to screw me, but rather be a useful tool, and I think it'd be useful to be able to redirect skeptics and newbies to a laziness resource list.\n    submitted by    /u/Instrume  \n [link]   [comments]",

Instead of giving a single process 8 cores you spawn 8 pods with cpu:1.\n My question is - how much of a reason do I have to give my cats-effect app 8 core vs spawning 8 instances?\n And also how much of a bottleneck is the process of serialization with cats services trying to do a lot of concurrent IO aka web servers? It's anecdotal since I was not there but at work, it was observed that NodeJs is dying very fast under the pressure of grpc encoding/decoding. But it seemed to me to be a mistaken judgment since it should be the same in cats/tokio/what-have-you so I think it was just easier for them to ramp up those core numbers with scala.\n    submitted by    /u/lionflzcfxpcuugdsh  \n [link]   [comments]",

By incorporating side effects, we extend this representation to I => F[O], where F[_] denotes the ability to handle side effects.\n Resources\n To build an app, we rely on resources such as app information, input arguments, a logger, and configuration settings.\n With t…",

Currently I do just about everything in Python, SQL with a sprinkle of R. I know some Scala 2, Java and C++ as well. To me, Scala always felt like the ideal marriage of having a great type system and not having the annoying things you'd associate from static typing.\n I think the pessimism hurts adoption as folk like myself become skeptical. That's sad because at least in theory the language does exactly what people like me need: a pragmatic yet principled way to make software. Scala 3, especially, looks flexible enough for scripting and interactive stuff with for example polynote.

Does it work differently?\n I'm having trouble in migrating some code that uses Refined from Scala 2 to Scala 3.\n The code is:\n import eu.timepit.refined.api.{Refined, RefinedTypeOps}\n import eu.timepit.refined.numeric.Interval.Closed\n object Example {\n type MyType = Int Refined Closed[1, 3]\n object MyType extends RefinedTypeOps.Numeric[MyType, Int]\n val good: MyType = MyType(1) // 2.13: works\n val bad: MyType = MyType(42) // 2.13: correctly fails with error re 42 > 3\n }\n It works fine with Scala 2.13.11 (with dependency \"eu.timepit\" %% \"refined\" % \"0.11.0\"), compiling per the comments.\n However, with Scala 3 (I tried 3.0.0, 3.3.0) the line with good fails compilation with the error \"object MyType in object Example does not take parameters\".\n It looks like an apply method implemented using RefineMacro.implApplyRef disappeared for the Scala 3 version of eu.timepit.refined.api.RefinedTypeOps. \n Does the Scala 3 version still support compile-time validation of literal values to refined types? \n If so, how?

For example the industry was happy to adopt React even though it introduces breaking changes with major version updates.\n  \nWhat are your takes on this matter?

As I delve into the ZIO documentation and source code, I feel like I'm missing a few pieces to fully grasp how they fit together. I'd greatly appreciate your insights in helping me form a complete picture.\n ​\n In the `ZIO[R, E, A]` effect, the type parameter `R` is referred to as the environment type or the ZIO environment of type `R`. The ZIO environment can be constructed by composing ZLayers. By using accessor methods provided by the ZIO datatype, we can access the ZIO environment of a specific type to execute the effect.\n ​\n Here's where I am seeking clarification: Is it correct to say that ZIO constructs the ZIO environment of the required type `R` from the ZIO environment built by composing the layers? The ZIO environment constructed from the layers will have a different type, but ZIO effects need a specific ZIO environment of a particular type.\n ​\n Furthermore, I am curious about the role of ZEnvironment in all of this. How does it fit into the overall picture?\n ​\n I am grateful for any insights or explanations you can provide to help me better understand these concepts and their interactions.\n ​\n Thank you in advance!\n    submitted by    /u/Sensitive_Network497  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "As a follow-up to this old thread, I am pleased to announce the first release of the Kreuzberg Library.\n The library's primary purpose is to simplify the creation of declarative ScalaJS components.\n The concept is straightforward:\n  \nComponents can subscribe to models, which contain some state.\n Components declare event bindings (e.g., click events) that, in turn, modify models.\n If a model changes, the components emit new HTML (including event bindings and sub-components).\n The new HTML gets rendered.\n  \nAdditionally, Channels are included, which offer n:m communication and can be incorporated into event bindings (as sources and sinks).\n HTML rendering can be performed via Scalatags and Scala XML, but other mechanisms can also be implemented.\n The rendering engine can be changed. Currently, there are two simple client-side engines available: a simple imperative, and a ZIO-Based.\n A proof-of-concept RPC system is also available. You can declare a trait for a service, and macros will generate a stub for the client (ScalaJS) app and dispatcher code for the server side. In the examples, this is used to implement a TODO app with server-side storage.\n Components, Models, and Channels are identified by IDs, which are currently auto-incremented. This isn't entirely functional. I've experimented with other ideas, like creating IDs via a State-Monad, but they ended up being less practical.\n I'd love to hear your thoughts on this.\n    submitted by    /u/dernob  \n [link]   [comments]",

I even let it run for entire day and nothing happened.\n I've tried basic troubleshooting: reinstalling IntelliJ Idea (2023.1.2), running different versions of sbt ( 1.9.2, 1.8.3, 1.8.2, 1.7.3 ), reinstalling Scala (2.13.19 and 2.13.17), disabling Windows Defender, installing different JDKs (19, 17, 11, 1.8), removing .lock, file, checking logs - they are empty. I even upgraded from Windows 10 to Windows 11.\n I know that Scala works better on Linux, but I tested a similar scenario on my friend's Windows 10 laptop and it worked like a charm. \n Here's screenshot of my last attempt:\n https://preview.redd.it/28f2b7ajou5b1.png?width=1232&format=png&auto=webp&s=30ef0f584998bae20641a352c08ee6307dcc70a3\n Honestly, i have no idea what else I can do. I've read through many GitHub issues for sbt and nothing has helped. Has anyone else encountered simillar problem? Any tips or suggestions on what I can do next would be greatly appreciated.\n    submitted by    /u/sirCanister  \n [link]   [comments]",

Ultimately, this is what works:\n ```purescript type GraduatedFields r = ( graduatedMax :: Number , graduatedMin :: Number | r )\n type GridFields r = ( gridCellSize :: Size , gridOrigin :: Point | r )\n type HorizontalFields r = ( isOpposite :: Boolean | r )\n type CommonPanel a = { alignmentFocusName :: String , data :: Record () | a }\n data Panel r = Graduated (CommonPanel (GraduatedFields r)) | Grid (CommonPanel (GridFields r)) | Horizontal (CommonPanel (HorizontalFields r))\n ```\n But if I simply switch the () to {} (which I thought was the same thing) for GraduatedFields, for instance, this no longer compiles:\n ``` Could not match kind\n Type \n with kind\n Row Type \n while checking that type GraduatedFields r has kind Row Type while inferring the kind of CommonPanel (GraduatedFields r) in type constructor Panel ``` Why is this the case?

          "description": "I decided to integrate some GoJS code into a PureScript Halogen application. I have some funding to do this, so it's not just a hobbyist project (though it started that way).\n Creating the Halogen components would be simple enough if one takes inspiration from gojs-react. The issue is that there are no PureScript bindings for the GoJS types themselves, but GoJS does provide .ts.d declarations, which means I could use purescript-read-dts, but that library's maturity/usability seems somewhat ambiguous, according to an author's post from 3 years ago.\n Conceptually I'm thinking of generating the bindings, trying to call the code from just PureScript, and adjusting the bindings manually for implicitly effectful computations. I'm not an experienced PureScript (or Javascript really) developer so I'm wondering what the community thinks of such a project. I know it's big.\n    submitted by    /u/amuricys  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Recently I've been using org mode to store web bookmarks. I'd like to keep track of files using org mode, too.\n My goal is to have headlines to act as some sort of \"abstraction\" over my heterogeneous collection of bookmarks + local files. I can tag them, sort them, reference them (through ids), annotate them in the same way (despite web bookmarks and local files being so different).\n The idea is to just use attachments: attachments do use the usual ID property, the data dir is global (~/data). Inheritance for attachment is off for the sake of simplicity and to avoid problems when refiling.\n Whenever I want to index a file I just use org capture, i specify a file path (or file on point if using dired) and it automatically creates creates a headline with the file attached (moved) in it. \n The only difficulty i see so far is to make org attach a file during a capture. It looks feasible, though.\n Does anyone here a similar workflow? I'd like to read advices or some experiences in this regard\n    submitted by    /u/cidra_  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "In my setup I use a file for each \"project\" i.e.\n  \nTasks - personal tasks\n Work - for work tasks\n Config - for tasks related to updating my config\n Game Design - tabletop game design tasks\n Programming Study - for learning / growing my programming knowledge\n  \nYou get the idea. Each of these have a filetag so that everything is tagged and I have use categories for top level task types i.e. tasks/meetings/reminders etc (this lets me use category icons)\n The issue I have is for negative filtering. Say I want to filter out JUST my work and config tasks for say the weekend when I can work on a variety of personal projects.\n The documentation (here) states:\n C-u / Hide entries matching a tag. You can successively call this command to hide several tags. \n If I call this and use Work it filters out work options. I call it again and the prompt is pre-filled with the text \"-work\" if i change it to \"config\" then work comes back. So I though maybe it should be \"-work-config\" when i do this it removes config but brings back work. I'm at a complete loss on how to apply multiple negative filters.\n I've also tried using \\ for the Tag filter only mode not the more universal / filter. There same thing if I exclude work and run \\ again and exclude config it brings work back\n    submitted by    /u/timmymayes  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "So I'm building out my capture templates and I'm mostly squared away (borrowing a bit from Norang actually).\n One of the capture templates I use is for \"reminders\" these are tasks that I want to show up as a reminder on the agenda but are not TODO entries. A common use for me on these is for meetings. I drop the meeting on my calendar but capture it with a \"meeting\" capture template that clocks the meeting and I just notate my meeting notes within. \n To accomplish this I have a top level heading called Reminders and under that I store them:\n If its a one off I use the <2023-06-08 Thu 14:30> type of active timestamp so it shows on the agenda.\n If it is a recurring I use the following which I found online. the 3 means to show every 3rd day of the week. (1 2 3 4 5) would show mon-fri etc. \n ** Weekly Marketing Meeting 11:00-12:00 :Reminder: <%%(memq(calendar-day-of-week date) '(3))> \n My one off reminder capture template uses %^T to prompt for and insert an active date+time which works perfectly. \n I try to include this snippet of text in my capture template where I can just manually update the days I want the reminder to trigger for recurring ones like so\n (\"!\" \"recurring reminder\" entry (file \"~/Orgfiles/refile.org\") \"* %? :REMINDER:\\n %U\\n <%%(memq (calendar-day-of-week date) '(1 2 3 4 5))> \n \\n%a\\n%i\" :empty-lines 1)\n However when I run the capture I get this output\n  <%%![Error: (void-variable date)]> \n Ideally I'd love to use a prompt for \"which days to repeat\" where I could input 1 3 5 and get a m/w/f repeater output into the entry. \n I'm still learning so this might be really simple elisp issue creating the erorr and void variable situation here. \n ​\n    submitted by    /u/timmymayes  \n [link]   [comments]",

There are many Emacs packages which can configure process environments, for example, direnv, but they lack the ability to go a step further and define shell functions and aliases, which is often required by \"virtual environment\" tools. For those who prefer interacting with shell commands via shell-command rather than shell, eshell, or term, env-commander-mode is here to assist.\n  \nIf you are a fellow shell-command enjoyer, you may also be interested in shell-command-x.el which I posted about recently.\n    submitted by    /u/elizadev  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi,\n lately when I am coding I get annoyedd by the autocompletion popping up. Mostly it is just visual noise and it essentially does not interfere with typing, but combined with copilot it just becomes a noisy kindergarten. I was wondering if there are others out there with similar concerns and how you would tackle this ? \n I have rebound my tab to company-completion for while, but I found it to be a bit uneven, for instance you´'d get nothing if no completion was found, making you doubt if it was working at all. Also, since then I have moved to vertico and from what I gather its completion trigger is organised differently and it also does not solve my copilot issue. \n The reason for this post is that all info on completion is about automating all the tings and shower you with info while doing the dev, b/c we want to be vscode so much. \n Instead I was looking for some inspiration regarding a different paradigm, an on-demand approach with the option to get more info on the class/function/type, or in the case of copilot, a snippet.\n thx. \n    submitted by    /u/Sndr666  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I'm using eglot + pylsp to edit Python files. Most of the time it works fine, but occasionally (frequently enough to be very annoying, but infrequently enough to be hard to reproduce!) it seems to get \"out of sync\", and I get a bunch of random errors that don't match the file I'm editing.\n For example, I'm currently editing a file that has no genuine errors or problems, but flymake-show-buffer-diagnostic reports 1 error [\"unmatched ')'\"] and 30 warnings (indentation errors, \"unexpected spaces around keyword\", etc.).\n Saving the file makes no difference.\n C-x C-v reloads the file and the errors disappear. Running eglot-reconnect also fixes the errors.\n eglots-events-buffer is a bit hard to interpret but it looks like at least some of the spurious errors are being received from pylsp.\n I don't know how to track down this problem as I don't know which component has the problem. Presuambly it's not flymake, but is Eglot sending the wrong file data? pylsp reporting the wrong thing? Some kind of JSON RPC issue? Something else I'm missing?\n Any tips on how to track down the issue?\n My eglot config is minimal:\n ```\n (use-package eglot\n :ensure t\n :defer t\n :hook (python-mode . eglot-ensure)\n :bind ((\"C-c r\" . eglot-rename)\n (\"C-c C-r\" . eglot-rename))) ```\n I'm running\n emacs 28.1 (same problem occurs with 29)\n pylsp v1.7.4\n ​\n ubuntu 22.04\n    submitted by    /u/chimprich  \n [link]   [comments]",

But modus is obvious masterpiece.\n This is emacs, so obviously I want to modify if something bother me.\n As a result, I finally started making a theme that felt fine to me. (I say fine because, I don't think it is complete or perfect)\n 📜 Info\n There is no science or principle behind this theme. Just some colors lying on your screen. If many of you do not like it, i might tweak and change some colors for community purpose. Or else, i might improve and add some goodies.\n Screenshots are here: https://github.com/idlip/haki/blob/haki/gallery.org\n As of now, I dont plan on making light theme, I'm not a light theme user. But if many want light variant, I might take it up in near future.\n ⭐ Features\n  \nUsually in themes, background of mark region, completion bar gets noticed. So i made haki-change-region, which changes region color in many places on the fly.\n There are variables like haki-*-font, which has respective use cases to look good in org, markdown, elfeed.\n Also for meow or evil users, you can use haki-modal-mode-line which changes the mode-line border color accordingly to states.\n  \nToo long, Don't wanna read;\n  \nhttps://github.com/idlip/haki.\n It is available in melpa!\n Screenshots => https://github.com/idlip/haki/blob/haki/gallery.org\n  \nAs a side note, I manage my whole system (nixos) and emacs in literate org-mode and it has been great.

Its primary features are:\n  \nThe names of process buffers can be customized on a per-command basis; for example, the buffer name for the command ls -la can be automatically set to *shell:ls*, *shell:ls -la*, or any other number of desired values.\n \nWhen a command completes, its output buffer can emulate special-mode; this is useful for quickly dismissing (with quit-window) or quickly re-running the command (with revert-buffer).\n \nWhen a command completes, the point can be moved to the beginning of the output buffer if the command wasn't interactive; this is useful for paging through the output of commands like grep --help.\n \n The project readme also contains some tips and tricks for a smoother experience. The goal of the package is essentially to make shell buffers display when and where you want them, depending on the kinds of commands you run, and for those buffers to behave more like native special emacs buffers like help-mode.\n    submitted by    /u/elizadev  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "So my post isn't meant to bash on Magit, but rather I am trying to understand what kind of issues people had with the git CLI that made them love Magit. \n I remember before entering the world of emacs, people would say the two packages that would change your life would be Magit and org-mode. I have been using emacs for a few months now and I can safely say that I never use org-mode and still use the git CLI as I find it faster. Really the package that I felt was unique and made me stick with emacs was Tramp. The ability to open a remote file in an instant, with no subscription fee (looking at you Jetbrains) and without it interfering with my workflow was amazing.\n Now I am a young adult (~26yr) and am still early in my career as a software engineer so maybe I am just ignorant, but really the only git commands I use are git diff, status, pull, push branch and merge. And honestly in my bubble of using git, Magit is not really that much different than just using the CLI. Heck in the terminal I can even create aliases and chain commands with && which is even faster.\n Are there git commands that I don't know about that feel horrible or are the projects and responsibilities I deal with still small enough that I do not see the downfalls of using the CLI for much larger projects?\n TLDR: What aspects of Magit make it a better experience for version control than just using git in the terminal?\n EDIT: I want to thank each and everyone that replied. It seems that the way I commit code (multiple files at a time) is super elementary and for better debugging and readability people actually commit specific LINES of code not even files, which Magit in unmatched for. I learned a lot of new tools in this post specifically ediff and git bisect which I had not heard off. I plan to take these lessons forward in my career. I apologize if was not able to reply to everyone but I do promise I read your message. Thanks again.\n    submitted by    /u/JoeKazama  \n [link]   [comments]",

Inside the .projectile files there is a +/../common line to include the common dir when looking for project files.\n The three project dirs include a compile_commands.json that also knows how to compile files in the common dir.\n Each project may set different defines or compiler flags to compile common code.\n Now I have two problems:\n - if I open a file inside project_a and then try to open a file in common with C-p f it switches to a new project root and from now on common is a project on its own (probably because it detects a git repo?)\n - if I jump to a symbol inside project_a defined in common, new project root again, clangd looks for compile_commands.json inside it, doesn't find it and fails to resolve symbols.\n I want each project to behave like a single one including common dir both in project navigation and in clangd.\n Any idea?

Biggest thing holding me off from switching are the Keybindings. Just Moving the cursor is already such a strech. I've installed Evil mode but you have to configure it with every other plugin and often end up with doubled behaviour and not everything working as expected. It's still very hacky and i'm not sute if i should be using it.\n My Question is if i should just commit to the default binding? I've heard that they are subjectively bad and cause pinky strain and don't allow a fast workflow, and i can see that being the case. But maybe it just comes down to practice.\n Any of you had the same experience coming from Vim? Who uses the default bindings? Do you experience any problems with them?\n Thank you in advance!\n    submitted by    /u/ppNoHamster  \n [link]   [comments]",

Here is an example from customize-face:\n https://i.imgur.com/KdaaC2J.png\n I speculate this happens because the default colours now assume 256-colour terminal, and indeed if I switch to 256 colours in the terminal emulator the settings look readable:\n https://i.imgur.com/dE2jUCv.png\n The question is how do I easily revert to earlier settings from Emacs 27?

          "description": "Many packages like org-krita/org-yt/org-excalidraw/org-xournalpp allow custom files to be displayed inline by means of a custom link type. However, they don't work when the file is linked as an attachment, which makes me think that there may be a better way to achieve this. \n ​\n The org-display-inline-images function uses some functions and variables from image.el such as image-file-name-regexp and create-image to respectively check if the file is an image and to create the image descriptor to display it inline.\n The packages above (except org-yt which is more general) kind of work the same way: there is a project binary file (e.g. .xopp) that gets converted to an image format such as .png and .svg and then it gets displayed inline.\n Would it be possible to define a custom image handler (e.g. for .xopp) that would work exactly the same as, let's say, .png, except that it performs a conversion (.xpp -> .png) before actually handling it? And then the second questions: would it be a silly idea?\n    submitted by    /u/cidra_  \n [link]   [comments]",

In Doom, it's provided by a package called vertico. Then other packages provide fuzzy matching in vertico.\n To get out from M-x I had to press Escape 3 times. And this is without bringing up how unintuitive the keybindings are (like moving around).\n Emacs could do with much needed polish. Without Doom Emacs (and its configuration) and the amazing packages people provide, I don't think I could use Emacs.\n It's no wonder Emacs isn't really brought up in conversation. I would like to see improvements in usability. It needs built-in quality-of-life improvements to be more accessible to people. Emacs being extremely powerful and extensible means nothing if the average person isn't able to use that to their benefit.\n I hope I didn't come across as too criticising; I do love Emacs and spend most of my day in it.

Ledger is great, but required to create transactions in ledger. Struggled with parsing bank/card pdfs, manually creating entries and nothing worked. Eventually realized that I can just copy the text from pdf into emacs and then format it using emacs macros. Then next task was to convert the transaction lines into ledger entries. This gave birth to `ob-ledger-convert` or `ob-lc` to provide `lc` src blocks in the org mode which when executed convert the given transactions into ledger format. It does need parsers and I have provided some of the parsers used by me in the `ob-lc` module. New parsers can be added easily.\n This post is to share the enthusiasm of the emacs being such a fascinating machine which lets you do anything you want and also to get the feedback from the community on the package.\n The sample org file provided in the repo provides a gist of how to use the module.\n ob-ledger-convert: jayrajput/ob-ledger-convert: Convert anything to ledger in emacs org babel (github.com) \n ​\n    submitted by    /u/redmango2022  \n [link]   [comments]",

But it has turned out that something as simple as a high contrast theme with a pure white background and black text is beyond my abilities. \n For some reason, M-x set-background-color white sets the background to gray when running emacs in a terminal. Even setting the background color to #ffffff results in a gray background (and in me shouting frustrated at the monitor). I can get pure white with xemacs, but I'm mostly working on our development servers remotely over slow ssh connections, so xemacs is out of the equation. \n Of the standard themes, whiteboard comes closest, but is also gray background, smudged and hard to read on e-ink. Literally every light theme I've downloaded has been some variant of smudgy yellow, gray or teal for the background. Grayish text on grayish background is virtually illegible on e-ink. \n I found an \"e-ink\" theme here: https://emacsthemes.com/themes/eink-theme.html. This gets me black text on a white background... mixed with white text on a white background (#includes and other syntax highlighting), so also not useable. \n Can it really be that difficult to get real black text on real white background? What is the obvious thing I'm missing? I'm happy to have some syntax highlighting in (dark) gray, but the main text needs to be pure black, and most importantly the background should be actual white. \n Please help, my inability to get something so trivial to work is hurting my self-esteem!\n    submitted by    /u/jimmyriba  \n [link]   [comments]",

Please, install it and later (after few weeks) submit the results to emacs-gc-stats@gnu.org\n Usage:\n Add\n (require 'emacs-gc-stats) (setq emacs-gc-stats-gc-defaults 'emacs-defaults) ; optional (emacs-gc-stats-mode +1) \n to your init file to enable the statistics acquiring.\n When you are ready to share the results, run M-x emacs-gc-stats-save-session and then share the saved emacs-gc-stats-file (defaults to ~/.emacs.d/emacs-gc-stats.eld) by sending an email attachment to <mailto:emacs-gc-stats@gnu.org>.\n You can use M-x emacs-gc-stats-clear to clear the currently collected session data.\n The following data is being collected after every command:\n  \n GC settings gc-cons-threshold and gc-cons-percentage\n  Emacs version and whether Emacs framework (Doom, Prelude, etc) is used\n  Whether gcmh-mode is used\n  Idle time and Emacs uptime\n  Available OS memory (see memory-info)\n  Emacs memory allocation/GC stats\n  Current command\n  \n   submitted by    /u/yantar92  \n [link]   [comments]",

Chances are, if you are looking for an icon that looks good and appropriate, it's probably in there.\n The public API largely remains the same, but there are some backward incompatible changes in the private APIs. Please refer to the README for details.\n Judging from Github searches, these changes do not appear to cause too much breakage, but I could be wrong.

When I display the vector in emacs, the entries look exactly as I would expect.\n However, when I save them to the database, each entry not only includes the text that I want, but a bunch of elisp code around it that appears to be coding the relative position of the text within the org file. It's as if the text has a bunch of Metadata attached to it that is invisible within emacs but becomes visible when taken out of emacs and put into the database. I've tried many different ways but all end with the same outcome.\n It's clear that there's a problem with the methods im using, so I'm wondering if anyone has been able to successfully do something like this before or has some suggestions as to why this is happening and how to fix it.

          "description": "Recently I have been doing some programming in python. I have got it working nicely in Emacs - I may share my configuration another time.\n I'm have a problem with imports though. In Python you bring in a library by \"importing\" it. I often have to edit libraries that are part of the project I'm working on. The problem is that in Python 3 you can't unload a library, nor can you replace it with a newer version.\n This is a problem because Emacs python-mode is based around the idea of sending python code to a python shell. This works fine unless imports get involved. Once imports get involved you run into the problem that python will never re-import a library after it has imported it once. So, if you're editing a library the only way to update to the new version (which could be what you just wrote) is to stop the python process and start another one.\n Is there a fix for this? Has anyone written a package to at least make constantly restarting python more convenient?\n    submitted by    /u/RobThorpe  \n [link]   [comments]",

(This can be done in a pretty non-invasive way via hooks)\n Highlighting of matches on all visible lines in buffer. This is a noticeable patch to core consult code. Instead of creating a patch/fork, I just put into a separate file which I load after consult itself, it redefines quite a few core functions. It might break with newer consult versions.\n  \n​\n Feel free to try: https://gist.github.com/lazy/4f609cf2b956de2531885747e3c3bf88\n Save it to \"consult-patch.el\" file, open in emacs, M-x eval-buffer, run consult-line, search for something like \"let\" and enjoy.\n ​\n UPD: gist was updated at least once. Overlay caching didn't move overlays between windows. Now it doef.\n ​\n P.S. I saw another approach to doing that: https://github.com/minad/consult/pull/774. But minad decided not to merge it due to perf and personal preference. Mine is a little better performance-wise: it checks for highlighting only visible candidates and caches the highlight overlays (of which there can be many). But I am not sure if I will be able to overcome minad's personal preference, so don't want to bother with PR. If someone wants to polish this code and try merge into mainline, I won't mind.

However, one can infer when this command is finished, that is to say when the server is up and running, by looking at the output (i.e. when the string \"Server is running!\" is observed in the output).\n I want to code up an Elisp function that calls the command, wait until the server is up and running, and only then execute the next step. How would I best do this?\n My current method is check the relevant process-buffer every 0.5 sec (with sleep-for) to see if the known regex pattern is observed, however this seems a bit sub-optimal. In particular I am unable to use Emacs until the pattern is observed (even though my process is async).\n I have tried to read up on process filters as my understanding is that they are functions which receive output from processes, but I can't figure out a way to \"wait\" until the regex pattern is observed via filters.\n Does anyone have any idea how to reliably achieve this, or any pointers on where I should look to understand process filters better to get to my solution?\n    submitted by    /u/fast-90  \n [link]   [comments]",

Funny enough, I feel like I’m procrastinating organizing my life cause I’m thinking “wait I need to get org mode set up first”.\n The problem is, I’ve seen people say it takes YEARS to understand emacs and that it has an incredibly high learning curve. I wouldn’t mind using something like doom or centaur, but at the same time, it seems weird to use a preconfigured editor and not understand what’s going on underneath the hood, especially if there’s an issue and I don’t know how to fix it. You think that’s a big deal or is using those preset editors perfectly fine? I’m looking to use vim bindings so I wonder if I should just stay with doom.\n I’m planning on reading “Mastering Emacs”, working through the built in tutorial, the elisp tutorial (maybe, but it seems weird to not understand the language the entire applications is built and configured in), and maybe Emacs from Scratch and the org mode udemy tutorial by Rainer Konig.\n After all that maybe I’ll know enough to build my own config, or at least understand a lot of what goes on in doom or centaur or something.\n    submitted by    /u/Altruistic-Carpet-43  \n [link]   [comments]",

But one of the things I liked more, was that help buffers and other popup windows, get focused straight away, so they are easier to navigate and to close, just by using the normal movement keys and q. I always thought it was much nicer than the default in GNU Emacs, where the popup window is not focused so you use C-M-v and C-M-V to scroll it and C-x 1 to get rid of the help window.\n After a short period of XEmacs, I brought with me that XEmacs behavior for help buffers to GNU Emacs. I've been doing that for more than 20 years.\n Well, from the XEmacs changelog: \n  \nImprove: Help buffer behaviour synced with GNU (Mats Lidell)\n  \nI laughed so hard :D\n    submitted by    /u/noi-gai  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi folks, \n I found the following in Section 16.10 of the Emacs Lisp Info Manual for Emacs 28.2: \n \"Normally, well-designed Lisp programs should not use with-eval-after-load. If you need to examine and set the variables defined in another library (those meant for outside use), you can do it immediately—there is no need to wait until the library is loaded.\"\n Some obvious exceptions to setting variables \"immediately\" spring to mind, such as modifying a library's keymaps with define-key(). The keymaps must already exist, of course, which happens only after the library is loaded. I don't doubt that the manual authors had situations like that in mind with their beginning caveat, \"Normally . . .\" \n But more generally: what if the library, upon loading, overwrites -- with its own default values -- the values the user had earlier set? \n It seems to me that it's safer to put all setq()s and whatnot into with-eval-after-load and be done with it. Or are there benefits to the blunter \"don't bother waiting\" approach that I'm missing? \n This comment from the Info Manual is tormenting me: I would sooner die than write an ill-designed Lisp program!\n    submitted by    /u/tdavey  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Helm is useful in most cases, but it is sometimes very annoying because it doesn't let me put what I want, maybe because it's not in the list. Sometimes helm lets me do that by choosing question mark [?], but that's not always the case.\n One example I experienced today. I'm using spacemacs with helm. I did find-file to a remote directory with TRAMP. So I'm in dired. From there I put M-x shell and it asked me the remote shell path. The default shown in helm text area is \"/bin/sh\" which is a reasonable default. But helm does not let me press enter there. So I can't open a remote shell.\n I thought there would be a way to just force put \"/bin/sh\", but I couldn't find any ways. C-f, C-z or whatever didn't work. I'm pretty surprised that helm does not have any unified way to fallback if there are no ways for a mature feature that existed such a long time.\n BTW, for that specific issue, I solved it with this elisp code, but I'm still curious if there's a way to fallback on helm.\n  (defadvice shell (around disable-helm activate) \"Disable helm-mode when calling `shell'.\" (if helm-mode (progn (helm-mode -1) ad-do-it (helm-mode 1)) ad-do-it)) \n    submitted by    /u/followspace  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "If anyone is interested, I've created an Atom backend for Gnus, which can be found here.\n I posted it to the Emacs development mailing list, but unfortunately it doesn't seem like there's much interest in it currently.\n The only major remaining issue with it is that it doesn't use Gnus' inheritance system, since I keep running into weird issues trying to implement it. If anyone is interested in helping with this I can provide more details. This doesn't affect usage at all, but it kinda sucks because I designed the backend to be very modular so it would be simple to quickly build custom backends.\n To use it, add (or browse) Atom feeds as servers, with the address being the URL of the feed (without a \"http://\" or \"https://\" prefix due to a limitation with how Gnus parses group names in some cases unfortunately). For example:\n (add-to-list 'gnus-secondary-select-methods '( nnatom \"somewebsite.tld/feed.xml\" (nnatom-name \"<optional custom name for the group>\"))) \n Each \"server\" will contain a single group with a name taken from the feed or 'nnatom-name'.\n Some design notes:\n  \nAtom feed entries (articles) can contain both a summary and \"content\" (or both, or neither). nnatom saves both, and allows viewing either by making the article multipart when needed.\n Every piece of data extracted from the feed is handled by a separate function, and all Gnus backend interface functions are generic, which allows very simple creation of derivative backends theoretically (you only need to implement a set of parsing functions for your feed).\n Every feed has it's own file for data storage, and those are the only files modified directly by nnatom.\n  \n   submitted by    /u/dsemy  \n [link]   [comments]",

The autocomplete feature is great, but causes me issues when I am navigating through the code. \n A simple example is: when I comment a line in my code, and try to move to the line above or below, I can't do it. This is because the auto-complete pops up, and it scrolls through those options rather than go up or down in my code. As a result, every time I need to comment -> move left -> move up, instead of just moving up. Commenting is just one example. There are several other times (changing variables and so on) where this happens.\n I want the autocomplete to help me when I am trying to finish a variable or call a function, not unnecessarily bother me like this. Do you guys know of any solution to fix this? Maybe changing the keys for scrolling through autocomplete might help (although that might make it difficult to use it in normal circumstances, I am open to ideas).

I haven't had much luck finding examples of how reference/bibliographic cards are numbered or referred to ? Since they're generally kept in a separate  slip box, how are they numbered? Do they branch out too (i.e. 1a2b) or no ?\nWould love to hear or see some examples.\nThanks!\nP.S. Er, it looks like this may have been posted in the wrong category.

The extension is called Zettel View, and it contributes a Zettlr-like display of Zettels to the VS Code Explorer View, as shown below.\n\nClicking on any file in the Zettel View window opens the Zettel markdown file in an editor window and causes the file explorer to highlight the selected file.  Since I installed the \"Auto-Open Markdown Preview\" VS Code extension, the markdown preview of the selected Zettel also appears.\nThe Zettel View extension for VS Code is available on my GitHub account.\nZettel View makes some assumptions about Zettels. First, Zettels are markdown files with the extension .md. Second, a markdown file's H1 or level-one header has the form # ID TITLE (the ID is to the left; some prefer the ID on the right). Third, ID matches a regular expression specific to my ID scheme. Fourth, ID.md is the filename of the Zettel markdown file with the header # ID TITLE.\nThe second and third assumptions are hard-coded but could be made configurable in later versions of the extension. The fourth assumption isn't enforced: a mismatch between ID.md and the filename will appear as a discrepancy between the Zettel selected in the Zettel View and the file explorer. A warning will be emitted in that case.\nZettr has the built-in configuration setting, \"Display files using first heading level 1 if available.\" A community plugin for Obsidian called \"File Explorer Markdown Titles\" once produced a similar display in the Obsidian file explorer. Unfortunately, that plugin no longer works with newer versions of Obsidian. Since VS Code is more valuable for my work than Obsidian, it made more sense to develop a VS Code extension than to modify the plugin to work with the current Obsidian API. I plan to move to VS Code the Pandoc and LaTeX integration I configured in Zettlr.",

Adding this routine to my 'monk morning' has helped keep it consistent.\nI'm reading:\nCreating Technical Manuals: A Step-by-Step Approach to Writing User-Friendly Instructions. Cohen, Gerald and Cunningham, Donald H.. 1984.\nThe Art of Brevity: Crafting the Very Short Story. Faulkner, Grant. 2023.\nThe Planets: A Cosmic Pastoral: [Poems]. Ackerman, Diane. 1976.\nI'm working on ideas for new statistical summaries of my ZK.\nSummer is here in the northern hemisphere: mowing, weeding, long walks, farmers market, lots of tick checks.\n\nMy ten day zettel production",
