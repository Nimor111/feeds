However, when I package these libraries with my program they are not recognized as safe to run on others' systems, so in order to run my program a user has to go through a launch, crash, allow library to be run cycle for each of the libs I link against until everything is allowed. This is obviously a no-go from a user friendliness perspective.\n I figured if I could link against the Mac frameworks for the libs that they should be signed (as they've been released as frameworks) and the user would only have to go through this allow process for just my app executable (until I get it signed). However, I'm not sure how to link against the frameworks.\n I tried repointing the executable to the framework dylibs using the install_name_tool, but the versions differ between the homebrew and framework versions of the libs, which made my app not run -- I've since thought better of trying to use this method in case there were incompatibilities between the entry points of the lib versions.\n My next thought was that I would have to link to the frameworks at build-time, but adding the -framework ghc option when I run stack build doesn't seem to have any effect -- it still points to the homebrew versions. Maybe the Haskell bindings are set to point at the homebrew versions only?\n This is the first user-facing application I've developed on Mac, so I'm in a bit over my head. I'd like to have the standard DMG/drag-the-app-into-Applications installer for the app, as I don't know that homebrew would be the friendliest install method for my target audience.\n Any help or suggestions are appreciated!\n    submitted by    /u/paul_schnapp  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello. I’m a professional Golang developer. I previous worked with Java for 10 years and Python for a few years as well.\n I tried to learn Haskell back in 2016 with the book “Real World Haskell. But I found the book to be really dry and frankly boring. It was a struggle to get through. And after about 8 chapters I saw very little “real world”.\n I find that most education material seems to run all examples in the repl. And that is just off putting to me. Especially when I see “real world” apps and I can’t understand what’s going on.\n Also I find that too many tutorials focus way too much on math problems. And that’s cool. But how do I get from math problems to building entire apps. To me there doesn’t seem to be any real progression.\n I know plenty of languages and I found I learn better by trying to build real things. Yet I find most Haskell tutorials and education shy away from showing real world applications. And reading source code is confusing since it’s hard to distinguish between built in functions and user defined functions.\n Anyway is there a middle ground between these heavily mathematical examples. And actual real world application. There seems to be a lot of ceremony in real world Haskell apps.\n I do enjoy the Haskell type system. And I like it’s expressiveness. I wish I could enjoy it like others do. I just have never got that “aha” moment because it’s hard to just jump in and get dirty with the language.\n Any suggestions?\n    submitted by    /u/branh0913  \n [link]   [comments]",

I've already coded a function for doing a specific move, i.e : play [1,2,3,4] (3,2) = [1,2,1,4]. [1,2,3,4] would be the number of objects on each tile, and (3,2) would be removing 2 objects from the third tile. I also coded a function that gives a list of all the posible plays on a specific board position, i.e: possiblePlays [1,2,3] = [(1,1), (2,2),(2,1),(3,3), (3,2), (3,1)] The problem i'm having is that now i have to code a function that tells me if a board position (like [1,2,3,4]) is \"winnable\": a board position is winnable if a play exists that can lead to the other player getting a not winnable board position. i.e: isItWinnable [] = False (because you can't make another move, so you lose) isItWinnable [1] = True (because you get to remove the last object). I think these could be the base cases, but i'm having a lot of trouble thinking the recursion.

What are existing best practices, and so forth.\n More specifically, for my current project, I want to model several geometric primitives (e.g., circle, sphere, triangle) such that I can effectively reason about them and use effective type-checking. I will render them with different backends, and will handle that elsewhere (e.g., JavaScript), but I want to be sure I am effectively modeling the geometric types.\n I'd like to use Haskell.\n The obvious way to go about this would be to begin writing data types in Haskell and potentially use that to generate other code via Template Haskell. Is there a flaw with this approach? I've considered using XML, or using Haskell to generate XML as an intermediate, but I'm not sure if that's necessary or flawed in some way.\n In general, I'd also like to use whatever approach I develop to model systems in the future. I'm not sure what the best way of going about it is. I'm wondering if anyone has any experience with this, or can point me to some references, so that I don't begin coding something that is doomed to be suboptimal for reasons known to those who know.

          "description": "Now that I have used backpack in raaz which has internally simplified the package quite a bit. However there are some ergonomic issues in their use at-least in raaz.\n  \nFirstly, I am not sure why backpack performs the mixing and matching in the .cabal file. I feel it makes the .cabal file rather large and unwieldy. The raaz.cabal is close to 900 lines of code with no real way to split it up. It is probably one of the biggest file in the repository\n \nThe documentation story is not very nice. Say Module A which depends on Signature Sig in an internal module. Now suppose the top library wants expose a version of A with some module mixed in for Sig, all the documentation of the functions defined are lost. One can solve this as this can be seen here. https://github.com/raaz-crypto/raaz/blob/master/raaz/Raaz/Digest.hs Documenting the functions in the source module (A in this case) is not useful because it is not visible one has to repeat this again in the outside exposed module. Whereas writing the documentation close to the function definition (in module A) make more sense.\n \nMismatch between documentation for hackage vs created by cabal haddock.\n \n I think 2,3 are probably bugs, or there is a way to handle it that I do not know about, but 1 is a design choice. It is curious because ghc supports .bkp files which is not recommended though. Currently .bkp files are only used to include test cases in ghc the compiler or to demonstrate backpack.\n    submitted by    /u/piyushkurur  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I am reading Functional Programming in Scala book, In the chapter 3 & 4 the author has introduced list and optional types for data structure and error handling. What I observed is, the author is creating a data type and data constructs and using Companion object or trait body to declare the functionalities. He is using pattern matching, based on the match respective case function is executed and on top using higher order functions to work with this data types by generalizing the pure functions and passing these pure functions to HOF\n For Example \n trait List[A]\n case object Nil extends List[Nothing]\n case class Cons[A](head:A,tail:Cons:List[A]) extends List[A]\n In the book, He used a companion object List\n object List {\n // some functions to manipulate the list data type \n }\n ​\n the pattern is similar for option data type as well but all the functions are implemented in trait body\n My question is what is the need to do things this way ?. May be I am not seeing the big picture and looking from the perspective of creating data types and HOF's to manipulate them. How does this helps composing program.\n    submitted by    /u/Sensitive_Network497  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Dear Orgers... :)\n In the org manual, \"7.5.3 Capturing column view\", in https://orgmode.org/manual/Capturing-column-view.html#Capturing-column-view says:\n  \nSince column view is just an overlay over a buffer, it cannot be exported or printed directly. If you want to capture a column view, use a ‘columnview’ dynamic block (see Dynamic Blocks). The frame of this block looks like this: \n #+BEGIN: columnview :hlines 1 :id \"label\" \n #+END: \n This dynamic block has the following parameters: \n ‘:id’ - This is the most important parameter. Column view is a feature that is often localized to a certain (sub)tree, and the capture block might be at a different location in the file. To identify the tree whose view to capture, you can use four values: \n -- ‘local’ - Use the tree in which the capture block is located. \n -- ‘global’ - Make a global view, including all headings in the file. \n -- ‘file:FILENAME’ Run column view at the top of the FILENAME file. \n -- ‘LABEL’ - Call column view in the tree that has an ‘ID’ property with the value LABEL. You can use M-x org-id-copy to create a globally unique ID for the current entry and copy it to the kill-ring.\n  \nSince the option for ‘LABEL’ says, \"Call column view in the tree that has an ‘ID’ property...\", my question is: how do you capture a column view that is in the same file, but another tree?\n For example\n  \nchapter \n subtitle\n another subtitle that tries to capture the tree with logs\n \n another chapter \n tree with logs (that can be seen as column-view)\n \n  \nAs always, thank you very much for your generous help, time and attention... :)\n Best regards...\n    submitted by    /u/edumerco  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm not sure what I need to inherit.\n I'm using Doom Emacs and have only just switched from (neo)vim so don't really know what I'm doing yet\n Edit: I noticed that if I do not add any custom formatting to todo's with org-todo-keyword-faces this is default behaviour, but I can't get it to work for customized faces.\n    submitted by    /u/dwdwdan  \n [link]   [comments]",

I've been watching a tonne of videos and reading through the manual.\n One thing that I'm wondering about is whether to use tags or custom properties for adding people to a task? The idea would be that if a task has a status of WAITING that I'd want to add the associated person to that task. Then when having a meeting with that person I'd be able to pull up a list of all the tasks that are associated with that person.\n In my current system (in Notion) I actually have a page per person, so that I can write some notes about them, such as favorite food etc. In that setup the tagging of a person to a task and the person's info page is one in the same (2 tables that are linked). I'm wondering what the best way to setup this kind of functionality in org-mode would be?\n TL;DR: Tag or properties for adding people to tasks?\n Thanks in advance!\n    submitted by    /u/practicalSloth  \n [link]   [comments]",

Is this possible to do in emacs? \n Also any tips for switching to emacs? I feel a lot slower with emacs to switch and edit file even though I find things like file browsing directly from emacs is much nicer than what is in gvim.\n So can the vanilla emacs match gvim in terms of text editing, and are there any features which are possible in gvim but not in emacs?\n    submitted by    /u/Suitable-Yam7028  \n [link]   [comments]",

Anyway, this little snippet \"works for me\" and might be of interest to others. All self-contained in a use-package form. If starting as a daemon do the desktop read after the first frame is created, else do it immediately after emacs-startup-hook is triggered. The only thing that scuppered me a little was not checking the supplied emacs.service systemd config - it hardcodes the Emacs path, starting the wrong Emacs version and causing straight.el to recompile everything on startup : solution to that is copying /usr/lib/systemd/user/emacs.service to ~/.config/systemd/user and altering the paths to your own Emacs version (Debian paths there).\n The settings of desktop-save and desktop-path in combination with needing a desktop-read call are, on observation, what caused much confusion out there in google land. \n Maybe not news to many, but I thought I'd share the snippet as googling showed it's still an issue for some.\n ​\n  (use-package emacs :custom (desktop-path '(\"~/.emacs.d/var/desktop\")) (desktop-save t) :init (defun rgr/restore-desktop() (when (fboundp 'alert) (alert (message (format \"loading desktop from %s\" desktop-path)))) ;;I include the run-with-timer despite being able to get this to work without as it's a timing ;;issue and a little delay does no one any harm (run-at-time \"1\" nil (lambda() (desktop-read) (desktop-save-mode 1)))) (add-hook 'emacs-startup-hook (lambda() (if (daemonp) (add-hook 'server-after-make-frame-hook 'rgr/restore-desktop) (rgr/restore-desktop))))) \n    submitted by    /u/RichieHHam  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I'm a very keyboard-centric person, however sometimes I still like to use the mouse to scroll down certain files in emacs (usually docs and the like). Plus, I don't really like scrolling line by line, so I've been trying to have emacs scroll smoothly.\n Sadly, I've found the emacs smooth scrolling experience to be janky at best: no matter what workarounds I use (I've tried several, including all of those listed on the emacswiki page as well as good-scroll.el), smooth scrolling feels sluggish, not fluid, and often unresponsive.\n I wonder what the root cause for this is. Most of the explanations I've read revolve around emacs' lack of animation support. For example, the github page of smooth-scroll.el states the following:\n  \nScrolling sometimes pauses or stutters. It's unclear exactly why, but one factor is that Emacs lacks animation support. Emacs has timers for updating the screen contents, which is enough for playing simple animated GIF files, but not enough for video playback or frame-perfect smooth scrolling.\n  \nMy question is the following: what would it take to fix it? I know that emacs is very old, and some features might just be outside of its capabilities (at least for now). Is smooth scrolling support one such feature?\n I understand that emacs wasn't made with smooth scrolling in mind, and I don't mean to criticize and/or diminish the amazing work that went into it. I'm extremely happy with my emacs experience--smooth scrolling would just be the icing on the cake.\n Thank you in advance!\n    submitted by    /u/M-x_  \n [link]   [comments]",

I like that they're relatively light weight.\n I've used helm for a long time, and it's honestly very good, but I'm mostly only using it for its locate functionality now. I use everything search on windows, which in combination with the .dir-locals.el lets me set a search instance depending on the directory I start the search from. I know about projectile, of course, but it's slower and more finicky than everything. (With everything, I can set up a search that spans many directories on many drives and make it a named instance, and then just query the named instance in the arguments.)\n Helm's locate is the only decent and maintained way to do this that I've found.

          "description": "I've written a book using org-mode and I'm trying to export as an HTML/website, similar to this example. That was written using R and Bookdown, but since it all ends up as CSS/HTML, I don't see why the same thing can't be replicated with org-mode. \n I've been trying to use org-publish to do this, but I'm running into a couple of issues. \n  \nI can't seem to replicate the book structure of the above example -- it all comes out as one single long HTML file. I'm using separate files for each chapter, and then a main.org file where each chapter is included via #+INCLUDE statements. What is the best way to achieve this? In other words, I want a front page with a TOC, and then each chapter to be a separate page and to have previous and next links for navigation.\n \nI've been using the org-ref package to cross-reference figures/tables/sections in the book, but it doesn't seem to work across multiple files. E.g. if I am in chapter 4 and I want to reference something in chapter 2 (using the label: and ref: keywords respectively), org-ref doesn't seem to recognize it. Any way around this?\n \nLastly, I'd very much appreciate any examples of books like this being made in org-mode and exported as HMTL/websites, for inspiration. Or \"book-themed\" CSS templates that can be implemented painlessly. The only one I'm aware of is the org-mode manual itself, but aesthetically it is very far from what I'm looking for.\n \n    submitted by    /u/jmhimara  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I use emacs to read a lot of PDFs, using the excellent pdf-tools package.\n But (like emacs users everywhere), I was not happy with a couple aspects of the default behavior.\n In particular, I use pdf-occur a lot, but the default behavior of display-buffer is to split my PDF frame vertically into two windows with the top window showing a too-small-to-read view of the PDF and the bottom window showing the list of occurrences.\n Maybe there is a better way, but this is what I did (which I share in case it helps someone else).\n  (add-to-list display-buffer-alist '(\"^\\\\*PDF-Occur\\\\*$\" (display-buffer-pop-up-frame) (pop-up-frame-parameters . (auto-hide-function . delete-frame)))) \n This causes the *PDF-Occur* buffer to be displayed in a newly-created (\"pop-up\") frame instead of splitting the frame with the PDF document into two windows. (The auto-hide-function causes that frame to be deleted when one \"quits\" the window in that new frame. That is, when you press q in that buffer, the newly-created frame is deleted.)\n However, there is a secondary problem. When you select the occurence you care about in the *PDF-Occur* buffer and press RETURN, it splits that frame vertically and displays the PDF in the lower-half of that frame (again, in a too-small-to-read format).\n I fixed that by adding a function to the hook for the *PDF-Occur* buffer's mode like this:\n `` (defun my-pdf-occur-buffer-mode-hook () \"CauseRETURN' in this buffer to use the window already displaying the PDF and return focus there.\" (make-local-variable 'display-buffer-alist) (setq display-buffer-alist (cons '(\".*\\.pdf$\" (display-buffer-reuse-window) (reusable-frames . t)) (default-value 'display-buffer-alist))))\n (add-hook 'pdf-occur-buffer-mode-hook #'my-pdf-occur-buffer-mode-hook) ```\n Of course, I'm happy to learn if you have critiques of how I did this—or about any of this.\n    submitted by    /u/cfraizer  \n [link]   [comments]",

This is possible with chemacs2. \n I followed the README but I'll add that one should also delete their package-quickstart.el and other similar files that use hard-coded paths, before moving everything around. \n Once you have your usual emacs in .emacs.default, you can for example create an empty .emacs.future (or any other name), and set it as a profile in .emacs-profiles.el. \n Next, you can download emacs and build from source with native compilation if you'd like. Do not make install, rather we'll use the path to the newly built executable. \n Since chemacs2 keeps everything emacs as calls to the default directory, you won't have to change much. \n What you can do now, is alias to the more recent emacs executable with the future profile. For example, I put the emacs repo in ~/emacs. Meaning that I can do :\n alias ef=\"/my/home/emacs/src/emacs --with-profile future\" \n To use a different profile with the built from source executable. \n Thanks to that I have two different versions of emacs with different init files, living together.\n    submitted by    /u/NoisyFrequency  \n [link]   [comments]",

Indeed, this is often an issue that comes up when I am teaching newcomers Emacs. So, why don't I hear about this being used more? Why don't I use it? Why was one of my joys in adopting EXWM the ability to use emacs shortcuts INSTEAD of CUA in other progams? Essentially I went the opposite direction.\n Even for those years when I was learning emacs, no part of me ever longed to regain the key bindings that were used everywhere else, and that is strange in retrospect. Was it because learning new keybindings was part of the emacs experience? Or because CUA bindings are already only relevant to Windows users and not Mac keybords? Was it because there is something qualitatively different about killing, yanking, and emacs' undo style than the copy-paste-undo of everything else? I admit, whenever I am forced into non-emacs programs, I do long for the kill ring.\n What do you think? Why is CUA-Mode so rarely brought up as a first step (and therefore rarely brought up at all)?\n    submitted by    /u/WorldsEndless  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello r/emacs.\n ​\n I have recently set up a neat feature for Emacs that I wanted to share with you. I am going to give you a short description of what this is supposed to be here, but for more details, and the required code snippets you can check my github repository where I also host my dotfiles.\n ​\n So, if you are tiling window manager user, you have probably heard of scratchpads. If you haven't, they are floating windows with predefined dimensions which are automatically hidden when they lose focus. Why is this useful you may ask? Well, I personally dislike leaving Emacs, especially when I want to write a large piece of text. But there are some things (mostly when I am doing something on the web, such as creating this reddit post) which I can't directly do in Emacs. This project tries to solve this project.\n ​\n I have basically set up my window manager of choice (qtile, but I do plan to try and make this for other window managers such as i3) to create a scratchpad of Emacs which opens in a placeholder file and an emacs command which when ran, copies the whole buffer to the clipboard and then deletes it from the file so it can be used again. This allows me to write everything in Emacs, in a small floating window which is visible whenever I need it and then hides itself when unneeded, using a placeholder file which is always empty and waiting for text to fill it. The setup is honestly very handy and I really like it, as the alternatives are somewhat annoying to use imo. \n ​\n For more details, check the aforementioned git repo. I hope you will enjoy it. I personally really like the idea and as I couldn't find anyone who has done something similar, I thought I should share this here so you guys can see the idea and adopt it if you like. I will gladly answer any of your questions about this and try to persuade you that its got a reasonable use-case.\n    submitted by    /u/AuroraDraco  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi. So, I made this thing awhile back originally in the context of developing a programming language which used a lot of Unicode math symbols (basically forcing variable-width fonts) and significant whitespace. Now I use it for all of my personal note files, and it seems like other people might find it useful so I'm releasing it.\n https://github.com/tenbillionwords/spaceship-mode\n ​\n spaceship-mode\n What this basically does is:\n  \nspaceship-mode makes spaces at the start of a line have their width automatically adjusted to align with previous text as they would in a fixed-width font. Example pictured.\n tabble-mode is an implementation of elastic tabstops.\n  \nTogether these make it possible in principle to do every kind of alignment I have ever seen being useful in an actual programming or plaintext-note-taking situation.\n Using spaceship-mode absolutely requires adhering to the convention of using tabs for indentation and spaces for alignment. Unfortunately, that means these modes work very badly with stock Emacs, yet I am not providing any kind of user-interface features such as commands to help use and maintain the indentation conventions, or any keybindings at all. It wouldn't do to just quickly slap something together, because Emacs' assumption of fixed-width fonts is fairly deeply entrenched in its design, and peeps have very different preferences and methods for dealing with indentation in general. (And I'm not providing my own full setup because...reasons.) So if you want to get this working well, you'll have to do some work to integrate it into your own system. The “Example Setup” in the readme may give some indication of how to start doing this.\n P.S. Thanks to the r/emacs folks who originally helped me figure out how to do this!\n    submitted by    /u/tenbillionwords  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I'm working on a game development project using literate programming in org-babel. The problem I'm having is the following.\n Say I have a table called \"sprites\" that defines positional indexes into a sprite sheet:\n #+NAME: sprites | Name | Row | Col | |--------+-----------| | Bob | 2 | 3 | | Joe | 5 | 6 | \n That gets passed into a block of C++ code as a variable and used for rendering. So far so good. But now I want to use that data to show the sprites in the org document itself. I have a macro that takes an integer index and links to the sprite image (presliced from the sprite sheet for simplicity):\n #+MACRO: sprite [[ ./path/to/sprite-$1.png ]] \n This gets called like:\n {{{sprite(123)}}} \n Which works fine. But can I make a macro that takes two arguments and multiplies them (row * width + col) together, like so:\n {{{sprite(2,3)}}} \n ... and links the sprite for Bob? Or am I limited to simple text replacement? If macros aren't the right tool for this, what is?\n And one step further, can I somehow just do:\n {{{sprite(Bob)}}} \n ?\n    submitted by    /u/xtapol  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I have a large Hydra for smartparens navigation/actions, and because I want to restrict the height of the Hydra window to preserve space for the main window, the Hydra hints get cut off at the right edge of the screen. So I created a second Hydra and linked Hydra #1 and Hydra #2 together via designated keys (as explained here). \n The problem is that I’ve memorized many of the bindings associated with both Hydra #1 and Hydra #2, and I want to use all bindings at any time, regardless of whether Hydra #1 or Hydra #2 is showing. This means I have to add every binding relevant to smartparens to BOTH defhydra definitions. This takes up a lot of space in my init.el, and it’s not as simple as copy-pasting because I don’t want hints that show up in Hydra #1 to show up in Hydra #2 (and vice versa), so I have to change the string hints to nil or change nil to string hints as appropriate. \n I’ve partially solved this last problem by having Hydra #2 inherit the bindings of Hydra #1 with the following:\n (set-keymap-parent hydra-smartparens2/keymap hydra-smartparens1/keymap) \n However, I can’t simultaneously have Hydra #1 inherit Hydra #2's bindings, as this creates the error cyclic keymap inheritance. Thus, unless I’m missing something (and I hope I am), some copy-pasting from Hydra #2 to Hydra #1 is still necessary.\n It would be great if I could have a single Hydra for smartparens that possessed a height limit and could be scrolled to see the hints that get cut off, like which-key allows. Different displays vary greatly in the horizontal screen real estate they allow. Should I check out hercules.el, or is there an obvious solution I’m missing? \n P.S. I’m not complaining about Hydra, it is a genius package!\n    submitted by    /u/jMilton13  \n [link]   [comments]",

And is there a port better compatible with M1?\n I saw that mitsuharu Yamamoto’s port was appreciated, but recent posts (1 year ago... there is not a lot of osX users here!) seems to indicate that the NS version was more stable...\n In the past, I used eMacs and org with Ubuntu and WSL, but as I am switching my workflow to Mac, I am tinkering on having a native app installed (rather than using a VM for emacs...). I’ve used my Mac M1 extensively, and faced hundred of bugs and issues with intel based software (from VDI and OBS support to screen through Bluetooth etc)\n Thanks for your feedbacks!\n    submitted by    /u/nokrah16392  \n [link]   [comments]",

Ok, so I can pull the :caption property from the table's plist, but the value is wrapped in triple parentheses when I format it to a string: (((This is Caption))) When I try to do things like mapconcat it, the type object is displayed a bit differently: (#(\"This is Caption\" 0 15 (:parent #0))) \n So now I'm closer, I know this is a list of text properties, right?

For my extension, I would like the file to be opened in the side window with that window having focus, but with the Deft buffer window still visible. I have had some success getting this to work, but I came across a situation with different behaviors depending whether one \"presses\" the file widget (by hitting [RET] when the point is on a file widget), or one \"clicks\" the file widget (by clicking the widget with the mouse):\n  \nIf the file is opened by hitting [RET] (invoking widget-button-press), the file is opened in the side window below and the file’s window now has focus. This is the desired behavior that I want.\n If the file is opened by clicking with the mouse (invoking widget-button-click), the file is opened in the side window below, but the focus remains with the Deft buffer. This is not the desired behavior.\n  \nTo demonstrate this phenomenon, I have made a \"minimal\" example of it in a package I call \"Daft\": \n https://github.com/shankar2k/daft\n How can I make a widget-button-click action that can switch focus to a different window other than the current one?\n    submitted by    /u/cottasteel  \n [link]   [comments]",

For example, here's the output:\n stack traceback: [C]: in function 'assert' tests/multivalues-test.fnl:17: in main chunk [C]: in function 'xpcall' /home/andreyorst/.luarocks/bin/fennel:4398: in function ? [C]: in ? make: *** [Makefile:32: test] Error 1 \n Here, when I press RET on the tests/multivalues-test.fnl:17: in main chunk line, Emacs tries to open \" tests/multivalues-test.fnl\" file (two leading spaces are included as part of the path (reddit strips those even in backticks for some reason)).\n I've tried modifying compilation-error-regexp-alist-alist variable by adding there the following regex as per this SO question answer\n (add-to-list 'compilation-error-regexp-alist-alist '(fennel \"^.*\\\\([a-zA-Z/][^\\n:]+\\\\):\\\\([0-9]+\\\\):\" 1 2)) \n But no luck, Emacs still tries to open path with leading spaces.

Although I'm quite happy with my workflow on my iMac I'm having a hard time making a good workflow for creating zettels on my iPad. That's why I'm looking for help.\nI've been trying to populate some front matter on a new note using this iOS shortcut for iAWriter: https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/05a688e941954398aafab768f75966fc. The shortcut adds a filename following the convention used by The Archive and adds title, date, and tags. The problem is that it works sometimes while fails most of the time for no apparent reason.\nAs you can see image 1 (sucessful-shortcut.png) shows how it looks when the shortcut properly works, and image 2 (fail-shortcut.png) shows when it fails.\n\n\n\nDo you have any insight into what's happening? If you use iA Writer, is there another way to add a front matter to a new note on iPad (other than manually)?\nA simple workflow is really important for me to work with The Archive and iA Writer on the iPad, so if you have figured this out I'd love to learn from you.

(Like a skeptic tank)\nHis notes are really short (generally 1 to 3 sentences).\nI see nobody else using the Zettelkasten in this way. Lot of people create longer notes and try to synthesize before putting the ideas into the system.\nLast but not least: the system is created for academic research in mind.\nMy frictions:\n1) When I think and want to create new notes... having to search existing notes in the Zettelkasten stops my thinking flow.\nI am wondering if it’s not better to just create note without connection when I think... and only then look at the possible connections. But that will create a lot of duplicates.\nOr thinking more deeply before putting the note and find the connections. (But I feel I don’t leverage the Zettelkasten fully by this way)\n2) When I want to create a new content... going to the Zettelkasten kills my creative flow. As I am not creating academic content (but marketing content)... The most important in the content isn’t the information, but the emotion (you can only put emotion in a content with your first brain in a specific mood)\nBecause of this 2 things... I am wondering if a Zettelkasten is the best tool for me.\nAnd if it is... I am wondering why only luhmann work in a very atomic way without bothering of the quality of the note. And why mainy people create longer note with digital zettelkasten.\nMy question:\nI deliberately don’t ask a specific question because at this point, I don’t really know what is the good question to ask myself.\nMaybe: How to determine the best way of organizing the process and scope of permanent notes ?\nThanks for reading.\nDamian",

Inbox consists of notes I might need to work upon in the future.  My inbox keeps growing much faster in volume than my core notes. There're three main sources of its growth.\nFirstly, I regularly read professional feeds with a wide range of information that I have no time to integrate right now. Mostly this is a specific momentarily info that might be unavailable in the future (or simply hard to find) so saving it seems pretty important to me.\nOn the one hand, this inbox propagation seems natural to me - I find that diving into that knowledge dump from time to time turns out pretty useful. And the power of weak connections works with notes as much as with people.\nMaybe somebody wants to comment on this? Have you been in a similar situation?",
