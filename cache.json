Actually, profiling shows that 50% of runtime is spent in expression evaluation, so I'm keen to optimise this as much as possible.\n ​\n Here's an explicit example. Our expression has a simple data type definition.\n infixl 4 :+: infixl 5 :*: data Expr = Const Double | Var !Int | Exp !Expr | !Expr :*: !Expr | !Expr :+: !Expr deriving (Eq, Generic, NFData) \n Next, evaluation is done by plugging in a vector of parameters. Specific parameters are chosen by the Int in the Var constructor, which just acts as an index for the vector.\n type ParamState = Vector Double evalWith :: ParamState -> Expr -> Double evalWith params expr = case expr of Const c -> c Var x -> params ! x Exp a -> exp (evalWith params a) a :+: b -> evalWith params a + evalWith params b a :*: b -> evalWith params a * evalWith params b \n I can now define an equation of 6 variables as an expression, and evaluate with a vector of parameters. If I just write out the equation as a Haskell function, criterion says that it takes 9ns to run. The same equation in my Expr data type takes 70ns.\n This is by no means slow, but if half of my runtime is spent in evalWith, then every nanosecond counts!\n So, any ideas on improvements? Inlining evalWith seems to do nothing, I suppose due to the function being so simple already. Any help or insights would be appreciated :)\n    submitted by    /u/aramend  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Intuitively speaking, a foldable allows you to list all it's elements and a functor allows you to apply a function to all its elements. But if a foldable contains elements surely you can map over them! Well no... Sometimes you don't want to and sometimes you actually can't.\n Consider Set for example. Given a set you can turn it into a list. But since Set is implemented using some sort of balancing tree that makes use of the Ord instance to provide fast membership lookup, simply fmaping over it will destroy that carefully crafted structure. It is possible to write a Functor Set instance, but it would make it useless as a set.\n But these are just \"arbitrary\" rules that we impose on the data structure. Here is an example of a foldable for which no functor instance can be implemented:\n data OnlyInt b where OnlyInt ::Int -> OnlyInt Int instance Foldable OnlyInt where foldMap f (OnlyInt i) = f i \n I also see no laws for foldables that would forbid data WeirdBool a = WeirdBool a (a -> Bool) to be foldable.\n All three of these data types are foldables that aren't traversable, simply because they already fail to be functorial. What eludes me is, whether or not there are any foldable functors, that cannot have a traversable instance. If foldable+functor would be equivalent to traversable, then could you write sequenceF :: (Functor f, Foldable f, Applicative m) => f (m a) -> m (f a)? I sure as hell can't. But just because you cannot proof that equivalence in haskell doesn't mean it isn't true (I think Gödel's incompleteness theorem applies, but I only know the pop-science interpretation).\n However if they aren't equivalent, then there must be a data type that is foldable and functorial. But I have failed to find one so far...\n I think about it from time to time and would really like to know the answer.

But doing this always has the cost of needing to introduce types to serve as the per-constructor tags, and I was wondering if I could do better.\n I realized that with DataKinds and PolyKinds, it was possible to refer to any constructor in the same type argument, so I decided to see what would happen if I tried it:\n {-# Language DataKinds, GADTs, StandaloneKindSignatures, PolyKinds #-} import GHC.Types type Foo :: forall k. k -> Type -> Type data Foo tag a where First :: a -> Foo 'First a Last :: Foo 'Last () \n And, well...\n :6:23: error: • Data constructor ‘First’ cannot be used here (it is defined and used in the same recursive group) • In the first argument of ‘Foo’, namely ‘'First’ In the type ‘Foo 'First a’ In the definition of data constructor ‘First’ | 6 | First :: a -> Foo 'First a | ^^^^^^ \n Is this restriction serving an important purpose? Could it be relaxed to some extent such that this case, at least, would succeed?\n    submitted by    /u/c_wraith  \n [link]   [comments]",

I am working on a little side project, likely one of my first more serious projects with Haskell that actually works and is teaching me a lot while working on it.\n This project has one purpose: to be a tool that can be installed to a Unix system, configurable with YAML, that can add, commit and push from several local repositories to remotes. \n For example I have a knowledge base of markdown documents that I like to have synced to a private GitHub repo, and for that I had a little shell script doing it. \n Then the idea arose in my head to create something more powerful and configurable that could do this for multiple repos. Of course I love Haskell and want to learn more, and I thought this might be a good way to roll up my sleeves and absorb a lot of knowledge in practice.\n I am sure the code I wrote is not following the best practices, I just have really given it my best with my current knowledge.\n I look forward for your opinions and recommendations.

I want to write a parser for a simple DSL using Megaparsec and for this I'm following the Megaparsec tutorial here. At the beginning of the tutorial the author provides the following example for constructing a parser for the string \"abc\": haskell -- Parsec as defined in the library is: -- type Parsec e s a = ParsecT e s Identity a type Parser = Parsec Void Text mySequence :: Parser (Char, Char, Char) mySequence = do a <- char 'a' b <- char 'b' c <- char 'c' return (a, b, c) Here is what I'm trying to understand, char has the signature: char :: (MonadParsec e s m,‏‏‎‏‏‎‏‏‎‏‏‎­Token s ~ Char) => Token s -> m (Token s) see docs here. In our case m is Identity and (Token s) is Char, so char 'a' should return Identity Char and therefore the do block in mySequence should resolve to value of type Identity (Char, Char, Char), or am I missing something? My question is, how can the type of mySequence be of type Parser (Char, Char, Char) instead of Identity (Char, Char, Char)? Is this some monad transformer magic in ParsecT that allows for this? Similarly later in the tutorial the author introduces the following example using <|>: haskell pScheme :: Parser Text pScheme = string \"data\" <|> string \"file\" <|> string \"ftp\" <|> string \"http\" <|> string \"https\" <|> string \"irc\" <|> string \"mailto\" Same thing here, string \"data\" <|> string \"file\" has the signature: haskell <|> :: Identity Text -> Identity Text -> Identity Text So how come that it can be resolved to Parser Text and not Identity Text?

Things for example you miss when using imperative languages or even other functional languages.\n    submitted by    /u/attitude12136  \n [link]   [comments]",

In 2020 I crowded sourced feedback and ideas on the designing Chameleon on Reddit. As a result, I was overwhelmed by a generous amount of participation and lots of constructive feedback from the wholesome r/haskell community. This time we are running an extended study with more advanced interactive features of Chameleon.\n If you are interested in helping us with our human-centered programming tool research or checking out our Haskell type-level interactive tools, please click this link to proceed https://blend.ercu.be/consent. We use telemetrics to gather usage data for this study, but it is totally anonymous. We won't ask you for personal data (email, name, phone number, etc.). It will take you about 20 - 30 minutes to complete. But in turn, it will help us immensely.\n If you are interested in this research, there're links to the paper and video at ICFP 2021.

          "description": "Edit: New example of using Servant with Okapi here. If anything, I think Okapi could make a nice prototyping tool for getting something out the door quickly. Read more about how to embed Okapi apps into Servant here.\n Hello Community,\n Over the past few weeks I've been working on a new server-side microframework called Okapi (I'm open to name suggestions).\n Okapi is a monadic parser, but for HTTP requests. It's inspired by F#'s Giraffe and the simplicity of web frameworks in other programming languages like Python and Ruby. It's meant to be a simple, idiomatic alternative to other frameworks in the Haskell ecosystem. A summary of what Okapi is can be found here.\n If you're interested in testing Okapi out, take a look at the documentation. I recommend going through the crash course (still finishing it) to get a feel for what you can do with this library.\n To see an example of what a web server built with Okapi looks like, take a look at this implementation of the realworld backend spec. You can use it to compare it to other implementations of the same spec. The Okapi implementation passes all the required tests and is a good idea of what you can expect from the framework.\n Okapi is still in the early experimental stage, so I would highly recommend NOT to use it for production projects or important side projects. The API is subject to major changes. The main reason why I want to show Okapi to the community this early in its' development is to get feedback as soon as possible to make sure this is something worth investing more time into. I'd love to hear opinions from Haskellers and non-Haskellers of all skill levels and backgrounds.\n If you'd like to open an issue or PR, the repo is here. Contributions are more than welcome.\n Here are some more interesting links:\n  \nMotivation behind Okapi\n Inspiration for Okapi\n Another example\n GitHub repo\n Edit: Servant+Okapi Example\n  \n   submitted by    /u/MonadicSystems  \n [link]   [comments]",

Since it's not feasible to change what that command does, would it be problematic to introduce cabal add which updates the cabal file?\n Even better, IMHO would be something akin to how git command work. Namely, by simply having a script on your path named git-*, that script is interpreted as a sub command. So git-stuff would allow git stuff.

Relive the horrors of undergrad physics, but this time in Haskell!\n I know that the author has written about using Haskell to teach physics before and has been working on this book for a while so maybe people have seen it before but didn't know it was slated to come out this year. The page for the book had been live for a little bit last year but then it disappeared. However it seems to be back up now because early access for the book has opened.

Just compile and run any file without bothering about project configs and whatever.\n Since moving to my laptop and trying to do the same here, I consistently get messages about missing modules.\n Example:\n \"Could not find module ‘Control.Monad.Par’\"\n I've tried reading about how to do it, but introductory guides to Cabal all talk about setting up project stuff, which was not at all necessary on the old system.

In order to execute those functions, I store the functions and the commands that correspond to them in a Map String (String -> Either String (String, Core)) but this doesn't work that well because the user may want to load a file into the program meaning that some functions may be IOs so what would be a better way to do what I want (without having to make everything IO)?\n Thanks\n    submitted by    /u/rhl120  \n [link]   [comments]",

I can make an Eq instance of Person, but if I follow that path, I would repeat the same code for all my Entity. Since I know how to equate any Entity, I thought that I could write an Eq instance for my Entity class, but the compiler complains that Entity is a constraint, so now I don't know how to implement this.

          "description": "Hey everyone,\n I'm trying to accomplish some SVG drawing with Haskell. Any language, really, but my go to is Haskell. I'm not really opposed to another language if anyone has a really great library in another language but that's perhaps off topic. I'm having trouble finding a library that really does everything I want.\n What I'm trying to do is draw a series of SVGs that are all varied but similar in many ways. So code sharing is important, which is why I can't do this in SVG and I need a programming language to generate them. I need to load in SVGs that I'm using from other sources as icons and also fonts and things like that.\n This is what I've looked into and found.\n svg-tree seems to be the library with the ability to read in SVG files and parse them into internal docs to manipulate.\n lucid-svg, which is recommended by svg-tree for doing actual drawing, doesn't seem to have this, but is much better for providing a drawing API, which I'll be using a lot of.\n svg-builder is very similar to lucid-svg, same up sides, a bit of an annoying use of hard to read operators for the attributes instead of just using tuples and lists, in my opinion, but fine, no reader still though.\n blaze-svg seems to not have any parser either, have much less documentation, and have a less nice API for drawing.\n I don't think the svg-tree data types are compatible with lucid-svg, but that'd be nice if they were based on each other.\n Does anyone know of a good setup for what I'm trying to do?\n    submitted by    /u/dskippy  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I've been writing a simple GUI app using reactive-banana, and I've run into a problem. The GUI displays one of two meshes: mesh A or mesh B; the user can switch between them by clicking a checkbox. My event network looks like this:\n ---checkbox---+ | -------A------+---AorB---+ | | -------B------+ +---mesh--- | --------drawParams-------+ \n The problem is that every time I click the checkbox, the mesh now being visualized (either A or B) is regenerated, which takes quite a while. The event network doesn't trigger it -- changes A shows no activity -- but a trace in the (pure) generation function shows that the mesh being activated is being regenerated.\n (It used to be worse; before switching with switchB, I was generating AorB with, essentially, liftA3 ifThenElse, which made both of the meshes regenerate every time the checkbox was clicked!)\n I note, however, that merely changing the draw parameters does not result in a rebuilding of the mesh; apparently the value of AorB is cached in some way. Is there a way in reactive-banana to request this behaviour; that is, to tell it to cache the value of some Behavior so it doesn't have to recompute it when using it further down the network? Failing that, is there some simple way to do the caching myself? (I can just about see how to do it using IORefs and something like imposeChanges, but a simpler way would be better.)\n    submitted by    /u/gilgamec  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I understand that this might come across as rude, and I apologise in advance if it does, but is anyone able to give me some rationale for why the Yesod forms API is the way it is? It seems to me to be incredibly overcomplicated. There's a mess of boilerplate, what with creating a data type and generating a widget from it, even if you need all of two fields, as in the case of a login form. In particular, controlling the layout and appearance of the form seems to be extremely cumbersome. The applicative API seems basically useless, given that you don't have any control over appearance - as soon as you want to do something as simple as tweak the label font size you have to drop to the monadic API.\n I'm coming from Flask here, so my reference point that you just write your form in a jinja2 template, in which you have full and straightforward control over the form's layout and appearance, then you access the form data from a request like so:\n ``` @app.route(\"/login\", methods=(\"GET\", \"POST\")) def login(): \"\"\"Log in a registered user by adding the user id to the session.\"\"\" if request.method == \"POST\": username = request.form[\"username\"] password = request.form[\"password\"]\n  # do things with username and password \n ```\n Why not have something similar in Yesod, simply write the form as a Hamlet widget, and access the form data by name, instead of all this stuff with creating a datatype and generating the widget from it using generateFormPost and runFormPost? I'm new to Yesod, so I understand I'm probably missing a lot of information. But I don't think I require much expertise to state that I'm finding the API pretty unpleasant to use.\n    submitted by    /u/sullyj3  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello, everyone. I am learning about programming with monads. I discovered the following while traversing a data structure with a State monad, but it's easier to demonstrate with the IO monad. \n If I use boolean operators, they will only evaluate the arguments that they need. e.g.: \n Prelude> False && undefined False Prelude> True && undefined *** Exception: Prelude.undefined \n So far, so good. This is what you'd expect. However, if I use the liftM group of functions to lift && to a monad, this no longer works. e.g.:\n falsify :: IO Bool falsify = putStrLn \"It is a falsehood.\" >> return False verify :: IO Bool verify = putStrLn \"Verily, it is so.\" >> return True liftedAnd :: Monad m => m Bool -> m Bool -> m Bool liftedAnd = liftM2 (&&) \n Then, calling it in ghci:\n *Main> falsify `liftedAnd` verify It is a falsehood. Verily, it is so. False \n So, you can't use liftedAnd for flow control. It's easy enough to write an AND function that behaves properly:\n mAnd :: Monad m => m Bool -> m Bool -> m Bool mAnd x y = x >>= \\b -> if b then y else return False \n Now, in ghci:\n *Main> falsify `mAnd` verify It is a falsehood. False \n So, my questions are:\n  \nWould someone please explain why liftM2 behaves this way?\n Is there somewhere in the standard libraries to look for properly behaved && || if/then/else etc. for monads?\n Am I missing some key fact about liftM2? Perhaps I am not using it in the intended way.\n  \n   submitted by    /u/Defrigeration  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello!\n I have some experience with Java, Kotlin and Scala. My favourite language by far is Scala, mostly because of their support for FP and monads compared to the other two. I just started in a new job where I am able to decide what language to use for our new backend. I would love to use Scala, however, finding the appropriate libraries/frameworks for Scala seems like a hassle. For Java/Kotlin its a no brainer : Spring Boot.\n Because of this, I'm not sure if its worth to go for Scala even. \n I have been looking at:\n Rest api:\n Play - No support for Scala 3 yet?\n Http4s\n Cask\n Akka http\n DI:\n No library - Cake pattern (or any other way without any library)\n MacWire \n Datebase access:\n Quill\n Doobie\n Slick\n ScalikeJDBC \n Trying to find out what we should choose is giving me a headeache. In my earlier job we used\n Akka Http, Cake pattern and ScalikeJDBC, but I don't want to use this stack just because I have experience in it. For example, a quick google search has shown me that the cake pattern really is not a good way to do DI (although I personally didn't have any strong problems with it, although it did became a little bit messy when the code base grew big). It just seems much simpler just to pick Kotlin + Spring boot.\n What do you guys think?\n    submitted by    /u/just_a_random_it_guy  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I'm probably going to butcher this question.\n I have a trait being used as a variant type (for a dummy interpreter) with a bunch of Conversion methods. Here's a simple example:\n ```scala sealed trait Variant\n case class Fixnum(i: Int) extends Variant case class Flonum(f: Double) extends Variant case class Str(s: String) extends Variant\n // Variant <-> Int here, figure the others exist as well... given Conversion[Int, Variant] = Fixnum(_) given Conversion[Variant, Int] = _ match case Fixnum(i) => i case Flonum(f) => f.toInt case _ => throw Exception(\"type err\") ```\n Now, I can use the above to pass my Variant type to any function that takes an Int and it works as expected. However, what I can't seem to do is use an Int as a generic type parameter like so (shortened for clarity):\n ```scala // works fine.. def unaryIntPrim(f: Int => Variant)(xs: List[Variant]): List[Variant] = xs match case x :: xs => f(x) :: xs\n // doesn't compile.. def unaryPrim[A](f: A => Variant)(xs: List[Variant]): List[Variant] = xs match case x :: xs => f(x) :: xs ```\n I can understand why unaryPrim doesn't compile, but presumably there's a type constraint I can add to A to ensure \"can be implicitly converted from a Variant\" or an implicit argument I can add that ensures the conversion is possible?\n I can get rid of the compile error by matching against the type (x : A), but it warns that the type check cannot be performed at runtime, which makes me think that isn't going to work either.\n Any thoughts on how I might be able to accomplish the above would be great.

Should I build a multidimensional array first and query afterwards the data I need from it?

Also, it mitigates redundant index checks when storing bytes to byte arrays sequentially in GraalVM CE.\n Results of benchmarks from Intel® Core™ i9-11900H are here as usually.\n BTW, If you had a positive experience with the library that saved your time due to handy derivation, reduced compilation time of your project due to efficiency of derivation macros, or reduced your spending on infrastructure due to efficient parsing and serialization, then please support its development and testing on different platforms by:\n  \nsponsoring my account on GitHub\n \nmentioning jsoniter-scala in articles and video records\n \nsending your feedback to Gitter chat or GitHub issues\n \n    submitted by    /u/plokhotnyuk  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "So, I'm a mentor for FIRST Robotics Competition. I want to transition my team of novice high-school students from Java.\n EDIT: I shouldn't have assumed that people would just be familiar with FIRST... I've had a few questions asking exactly what I my use case is. Essentially, students are given 8 weeks to build a robot for a competition. We aren't told the rules in advance, so everyone has the same 8 week period to design, build, and program the robot.\n However, off-season teams tend to do things like write general purpose code (e.g., movement) or streamline processes, make practice robots, etc.\n The library used in the competition (optional; teams can also create low level code from scratch, but almost nobody does) is called WPILIB. It's primarily a Java and C++ framework, which you can read about here.\n I recently became an F# evangelist and found that functional programming has greatly reduced the fragility of my code by way of ensuring a correct data model.\n I am looking to move our team to possibly using Spring and definitely using Scala or Kotlin.\n One of my fellow mentors has suggested that object oriented design is easier to reason with in the case of a robot, and suggested Kotlin as our next language.\n I suggested that functional programming can definitely be used to model a Robotics systems and ensure that invalid states are explicitly rejected while making the program easier to debug and test.\n Regardless of which language we pick, everyone will be learning it (and Spring) from scratch. \n What are your thoughts? Which language will better suit what we're trying to do?\n EDIT 2: We have decided on Kotlin for the main application code for now, but if Scala makes more sense for certain use cases (e.g., programming autonomous mode functions) we will be open to writing those modules in Scala. I still welcome any discussions.\n    submitted by    /u/sonicbhoc  \n [link]   [comments]",

Day 2 is a task where we have to parse a file, where each line contains a command. Each command updates one of 2 variables. I've tried to implement this using a functional programming style. I convert the commands to (Int, Int) tuples, where each element is a delta introduced by the command. Then, I need to sum these tuples element-wise (like a vector sum). Doing this sum was not very nice, because Scala seems to disallow tuple destructuring in (anonymous) function parameter position. Am I missing something?\n Also, do you have suggestions how I could make my code more idiomatic? I would love to hear them!\n Thank you in advance!\n  def problem1_tuples(input: Iterator[String]): Int = { // input is an iterator of lines val (position, depth) = input.map(s => ( applyRegex(s,forward_pattern), // returns update for first value in tuple or 0 applyRegex(s,down_pattern) - applyRegex(s,up_pattern) // update for second value )).fold((0,0))((a,b) => (a._1 + b._1, a._2 + b._2)) // this is *ugly* position * depth // the challenge asks for the product } \n    submitted by    /u/flo-l  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi, r/orgmode!\n Since citations in orgmode are now native (hurray!), I've come to wonder whether it is possible to use the same document as the source for the citations.\n Via org-babel blocks it is possible to write a bibliography in orgmode and tangle it to a bib-file. This mechanism is sufficient if you decide to use only one or two org documents for literature summaries, reading lists etc. like Gregory Stein does. But it becomes unwieldy, if you want to use a single file per book/article with self-contained bibliographic information, because you have to create a lot of single bibliographies, that clutter up the org-folder.\n The selfcontainment of bibliographic information seems very attractive for me because single files can be shared without thinking about needed supplementary files. Further, it would be possible to copy bibliographic entries between files and create project-specific bib-files for LaTeX use, without having a huge bibfile, of which the most part stays unused, and still have a consistent bib-key.\n As far as I can see Nicolas Rougier's org-bib-mode doesn't do that, but uses a corresponding bib-file.\n Do you know ways to achieve that or do you think it's a rather stupid idea, that brings a lot of hassle with it?\n Thank you!\n    submitted by    /u/Hero_D0t  \n [link]   [comments]",

The last meetup was rather unhelpful in this regard since we dove into a specific use-case.\n I plan to try once more providing a more general introduction to Org (and Emacs) debugging. Tentatively, I plan to talk about: 1. Running Emacs with clean configuration + latest version of Org 2. Bisecting config to find configuration-related issues 3. Using Emacs profiler and sharing profiler results 4. Answer any questions on the first three topics\n After the introduction, we can continue with interactive debugging if there is anyone experiencing performance (or other) issues with Org and willing to share screen.\n Note that using microphone and/or camera should not be required. Jitsi does have chat.\n The time will be the same: 9pm SG time (4pm Moscow; 8am New York; 1pm London). Sat, Mar 26\n I will post the link to the meeting one hour before the meeting start.\n    submitted by    /u/yantar92  \n [link]   [comments]",

Okay writing elisp just always used a simple checklists in whatever pocketable devices I had at the time. Random youtubes or org-mode pages tends to show simple agenda view but what I _think_ I'm looking for is more complex and I'm not sure org-agenda/etc can do it as is? (Presumably there are org query APIs I could hijack and make my own major mode viewer, but trying to reduce TODOs not add more ;)\n With hundreds of to-dos, perhaps org-mode/agenda/whatever can save me? The rate of adding to-dos exceeds the rate of completing them sadly :)\n Ideally plainorg or beorg can render it as well.\n Current Workflow:\n - many are dated to-do's - the date by which I'd like to see them\n - many are undated, but tagged (home, work, cycling, etc etc) and/or prioritized (high, medium, someday, etc)\n What I'd like to see is a single view including (in order):\n (by default, ignore tags; but be nice if the below could also be filtered down to 1 or more tags as well)\n - dated yet unfinished tasks for today\n - tasks that are pass due (dated for yesterday or earlier, and not checked off)\n - tasks that are undated, sorted by priority (descending)\n I don't want to have to cycle views for this, which is the trick; every to-do system in the planet can let you show upcoming or late to-dos, or the ones by tag, or the undated ones. I want the combined single view, so can glance and go.\n Most to-do applications (such as Apple Reminders) let you create smart lists that you pick very specific criteria, without OR functionality; so date for tomorrow, but not date for tomorrow+undated; a specific priority, but no sort by priority after picking two priorities say, that sort of thing.\n    submitted by    /u/FrozenOnPluto  \n [link]   [comments]",

It will point to /summaries/papers/some.pdf which doesn't exist. So I have to manually edit the link to file:../papers/some.pdf\n This manual step is annoying the deeper the hierarchy is. Is there a better way which adjusts the relative links automatically when I move subtrees up and down the hierarchy?\n    submitted by    /u/chrido  \n [link]   [comments]",

I want to add a project open command which would check org-roam for a node associated with this project and create one if it can't find one (The idea is that this node would contain the project's support material a la GTD). I had originally thought to use org-roam-protocol's roam-ref, but I think I don't understand how the file-ref which org-roam-protocol requires works.\n It seems intended mostly for citation purposes, which I think could work (maybe there'd be a way to get from emacs back to the projectwarrior project eventually?). But to do that, I think I'd need to write some sort of custom citation format. Unfortunately my Google-fu is failing me at the moment, as searching \"new org-ref protocol\", \"custom org-roam-ref citation format\" and several other related results hasn't brought up any results that pointed me in the right direction. So, here's the question(s):\n  \nIs there a way I can suppress the warnings from org-roam when I put a ref that is plaintext? This isn't actually my preferred solution, but I figure I'd start here.\n Is there a place I can find instructions on how to create a custom whatever-it-is that org-roam is expecting in the ref field?\n Is there another approach to opening (or creating if necessary) an org-roam node from the command line? Would something like emacsclient (open-this-node <node-uuid>) that might be simpler and easier to create?\n  \nThank you in advance for the help!\n    submitted by    /u/doulos05  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi, \n I am trying to wrap my head around completions in emacs. To begin, I am not sure what the definition of 'completion' in the context of emacs is, so I am using the term quite vaguely. It is unfortunate, but is perhaps a good indication of where my emacs knowledge stands right now. \n I have figured out that packages like selectrum and vertico shape how minibuffer suggestions appear on the screen. From the vertico page, I then moved on to consult. My current understanding is that packages like ivy/helm/consult provide enhancements to emacs commands (and perhaps also introduce some new commands) for buffer selection, register selection etc., including algorithms and interfaces for showing sensible possible options for the minibuffer prompt. \n However, where I totally get lost is company. What does company do? I am experimenting with lsp-mode, and it suggests using company. Does company also do the same thing as consult? \n Any comments and suggestions like links to pages which explain this ecosystem would be awesome.\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/mmiri-ifuru  \n [link]   [comments]",

Around 30% of my regular work day is dedicated to emails really. Extremely vital\n Manage personal calendar appointments via outlook (clients go through my secretaries)\n Manage personal To-do lists\n Listen to music, mostly through spotify or youtube \n Browse interesting subreddits here and there\n listen to podcasts and audio books.\n  \nThat basically summarizes it. \n Now I’ve actually read and watched a fair share of information regarding EMACS. The ORG intrigues me quite a bit. But I don’t really know if i’m barking up the wrong tree.\n Do you think something like EMACS, as a window manager (on arch probably, which I installed before and liked the Pacman a lot) can replace all these different softwares (from outlook, preview, spotify [which i know has a cli version!], MS word, MS excel, safari) and act as a seamless “one-stop-shop”?\n Or am I better just sticking out to my iMac and dealing with current workflow. \n Thanks in advance!

It comes with automagic point-synchronization between source file buffers and their AST buffers as well as a lot of other small quality-of-life features focused on making CodeQL query development a low-friction experience on emacs. \n For LSP support emacs-codeql recommends and cleanly integrates with eglot. It also depends on Projectile for project-root detection for eglot's new workspaceFolders initialization, which is required for the CodeQL language server to operate properly.\n Since the intersection between emacs users and emacs users that also use this one very specific static analysis toolchain is likely not that big, I don't expect this to be very popular. But I wanted to share it with the broader community to save someone else the hassle just in case.\n I'll be putting a lot of mileage on this package myself, so expect a pretty active feature churn in the coming months.

I should have explained where I was coming from with this. I have the opportunity to onboard college students to Emacs for work.

          "description": "Hey,\n I just started a new job where I will mainly work on a DSVM (Data Science Virtual Machine), an offering from Microsoft Azure that comes with pre-installed libraries, languages and, amongst other things, emacs. However, after getting in and starting to re-create my .emacs.d I realized that it runs an old CentOS installation for which only emacs 24.3 (https://centos.pkgs.org/7/centos-x86_64/emacs-24.3-23.el7.x86_64.rpm.html) is available. Has anyone been in the same situation? I started using emacs with version 26 so I'm not sure exactly what I'll be missing (other than the fact that certain packages already doesn't install, like use-package which I rely heavily on). Is there a way to build a newer emacs on this old CentOS?\n On my local machine I have to use Windows, but I can still install Emacs 28 so I'm trying to figure out how I could run emacs locally and use TRAMP or something else to edit and ideally also run things on the DSVM. Does this sound like a reasonable workflow? I'm new to TRAMP, but am trying to figure out the setup as we speak.\n To summarize:- Can I build a newer emacs than 24.3 for CentOS 7? I assume not as otherwise someone normally would have done it already (EDIT: MIght have been too fast to post https://justyn.io/til/compile-emacs-28-on-centos-7/)\n - Are there any obvious issue with the TRAMP workflow outlined above where only emacs is installed locally, but all libraries, Python etc. are installed on the virtual machine/remote that I'm SSH-ing into? Would something simple like running a python mode w/ LSP, Flycheck etc. where all the executables are also on the virtual machine work?\n    submitted by    /u/haakonhr  \n [link]   [comments]",

It essentially introduces categories for text. Each character in the buffer belongs to a category. The user can change the current category and every character inserted from then on will belong to the new category. The user can store a category which deletes all of its characters but remembers their position so they can be restored later. A category can also be completely erased. Lastly, the categories can be visualized in a separate buffer and the user can navigate through them in this buffer.\n The main thing I use it for is adding all debugging extra code into a different category. I can switch to the main category and correct the bugs and when I am done, I can erase all the extra code as it all belongs to a different category.\n    submitted by    /u/pcorrectness  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm very content with it until I noticed one big problem: \n If the scrolling doesn't stop exactly at full lines, that is, if the top of the frame is cutting the top half of some line, then as soon as the user starts editing with the cursor, the Emacs buffer will \"adjust\" itself such that the top of the frame is starting with a whole line, often through scrolling a few pixels up or down. This results in a visual jitter when the user is done scrolling (e.g. with the trackpad) and right after one starts using the keyboard to edit the text.\n I'm not sure if I've articulated the behavior clearly enough, but I'd love to know if others are facing the same issue, and whether there are workarounds for this.

For example, helm-mini shows file size,name, absolute path etc., all in different columns.\n How can you show something, but not make it searchable. Say I have a special source for various user-defined commands, and I want to provide not only the name, but also a short description of it, or its keybindings etc, without including them in the filtering, like helm-M-x does.\n  \n​\n EDIT:Here the answer by the current helm maintainer (I think) -> https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm/discussions/2493 (Summary: Use :match-part to only match against parts of the options). Thanks a lot for the extremely fast answer. Also, there really needs to be a better helm documentation. It is such a great tool, but anything other than the most basic extensions requires you to dive into the source code/ask the maintainer, which is less than ideal, I think.\n    submitted by    /u/Kram33r  \n [link]   [comments]",

It seems to me that's great if you're always at your computer AND you have the discipline to always work in a clocked-in state. But I have many little or big tasks or projects around the house that I'll work on or complete, and I'd like to be able to add to the task an estimate of the amount of time I spent on it without using the clock-in/out system. \n For example, today I changed my laptop battery, worked on my digital multimeter, and then checked all my batteries in my battery drawer, threw away the bad ones. I'd like to be able to just mark these tasks as DONE and also directly (and easily) add the hours worked. I might not know the exact start and end time I worked on the project, and I don't want to have to go fudge some clock-in/out time. (Unless there's a super easy way to fudge it!) I suppose it would be something like an HOURS_WORKED property.\n And I'd also like to be able to generate a report of all such activity/time for the day, for the week, for the month, etc. Ideally, that could somehow be combined with my clock report, but I'd be happy even if it were a separate report. \n Maybe this functionality is already in clock-in/out feature set? If not, is there some package or methodology that might help me out here? (I know there is ALWAYS...

          "description": "Hey r/emacs, long time Vim user here trying to make the switch to Emacs and get it to stick (this time). And one of the recommendations I've seen when it comes to successfully switching is to figure out your emacs workflow and patterns rather than trying to shove Vim into Emacs (evil-mode aside).\n One of the core parts of my Vim workflow was fuzzy finding a file (any file, anywhere) in a project. And I see that there's a way to get similar functionality with projectile or project.el. The problem I've found is on large projects it's too slow, and breaks my focus. But this got me thinking. I very rarely need to jump between many far flung regions of the project I'm working on. And actually, having to search through all files in the project (as quick as it may be) gets annoying in my Vim workflow where there are many files with the same or similar names. \n So instead, what I'm imagining would work well for me is to fuzzy search for all files in a sub directory of a project. I.e: in executing a custom project-find-file I would first get the option to find a subdir in the project, and then it would operate as regular project-find-file from that subdir.\n Being new to emacs/elisp are there any pointers for how to do this, I would imagine ideally with project.el? Or alternatively, how do you deal with navigating to files quickly (without breaking your focus/flow) in large projects with emacs?\n Thanks in advance! 🙏\n    submitted by    /u/joshleeb  \n [link]   [comments]",

I originally wanted to learn Emacs because of Org-Mode, but have since started doing most of my writing in a markdown buffer using writeroom-mode, where I previously just wrote with Vim in a terminal.\n I'm using a standard US keyboard on a 2013 Macbook Pro (still going strong), but I use ä ü ö ß all the time. The situation is basically exactly what is outlined in this older post. I have had the same key combinations baked into my fingers for years and I'd like to keep it that way. Right now, I have this in my user-config:\n (setq ns-alternate-modifier 'none\n ns-right-alternate-modifier 'meta)\n It works wonderfully, all good, I thought. But now at some point the umlauts go haywire: for example, ä eventually becomes \\303\\244 and I'm not sure what could be triggering the change or how to fix it. I get that it's UTF-8, but why it ends up like that in the first place is beyond me. Is there an obvious fix here or something that I'm missing? Thanks in advance for any input.\n UPDATE: \n The link that u/graduale posted ended up being super helpful, as it was indeed some sort of encoding issue having something to do with the existence of the \"null-bytes\" as discussed in that thread. Found them with C-s C-q C-SPC, got rid of them and using revert-buffer-with-coding-system cleaned everything up after I selected the encoding.

          "description": "​\n Hey all,\n flymake-swi-prolog is an Emacs package implementing a simple Flymake backend for SWI-Prolog, it provides diagnostics about Prolog source code in prolog-mode buffers.\n Here's how it may look when you write some code that makes no sense:\n flymake-swi-prolog\n This is the first Emacs package I've authored, I use Emacs a lot but I haven't written a lot of Elisp outside of my config file before, so the implementation is mostly based on the example backend from the Flymake manual. Any comments or suggestions are welcome!\n Under the hood, flymake-swi-prolog uses diagnostics.pl, which is a tiny Prolog package I've written to expose the diagnosis performed by the SWI-Prolog built-in IDE in a way that is both human-readable and easy enough for me to consume from Elisp.\n    submitted by    /u/eshelyaron  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi all, in an endeavor to truly understand the difference between a REPL and an interactive shell, I've came across this article On Repl-Driven Programming (hackernews comments). The author described two important features that Lisp REPLs have and other languages such as Python/Ruby lack. These two features are:\n  \nbreakloop. If you call an undefined function, the debugger will be in a breakloop (what the L in REPL truly stands for), and in there you can edit the code, without restarting the function call. In emacs if would of be like if we encounter a (void-variable foo) error and the debugger pops up. And then we recursively edit the source code and then the debugger will go back one step in the stack and the code runs like no error has happened.\n \nhot reloading. If you define a class, and instantiate a few instances, changing the class definition while the program is running will dynamic be reflected on the instances without restarting the REPL. In emacs, I feel like the main emacs runtime already has some of this using eval-defun or eval-sexp, but it's not as automatic as other languages mentioned. \n \n  \nMy questions are: \n Do we have breakloop and hot reloading in Emacs? Are there any other tricks that Emacs has for REPL-driven development? \n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/FVIIIvWF  \n [link]   [comments]",

It is easy to add any additional feature and package later if you need one.\n There are several reasons for keeping the configuration to a bare minimum, one is that it’s easier to keep track of all the packages and keystrokes. It is better to have a setup that you use 90% of the time, than having a cluttered setup that will just make it difficult to keep up with gazillions of preinstalled packages that usually end-up being unused.\n This configuration tries not to be a one-size-fits all configuration, but it tries to be an Emacs configuration that suits most of the developers, and I keep it personable, clean, easy and sensible.\n    submitted by    /u/joeljuliano  \n [link]   [comments]",

I use Emacs to write documentation, and a lot of times my files end up with some internal markup that looks like this: [TK: Where is the event handler defined?] in-line with the text. (\"TK\" is writer speak for \"to come\"), since the only common English words that have 'tk' in them are \"pocketknife\" and \"hotkey\", and case sensitivity matters.)\n I added \"TK\" to hl-todo-keyword-faces, but I discovered that hl-todo uses a regexp like (^|\\s)(<keyword>), so the opening bracket confuses hl-todo and it doesn't show up in the todo lists.\n I wrote a quick perl script to place a space before the bracket, and it worked, and now the magit-status buffer says my documentation folder has 59 TODOs over 41 markdown files-- which is great!-- but it won't list them! Which is not great.\n So:\n  \nRemembering to include the space in [ TK: ...] is a pain in the neck, and looks terrible. Is there a way to modify the regexp such that the opening bracket is a legal character to hl-todo without hacking hl-todo's source in the elpa folder?\n \nHas anyone seen this where Magit-todo won't list the TODOs?

In order to differentiate them in Agenda, I have adopted a policy of appending their repetition amount in the headline itself, like this:\n *** TODO Clean/Organize Garage for 10 minutes .+1w SCHEDULED: <2022-03-19 Sat .+1w> Spend at least 10 minutes cleaning up the garage. (I'll probably do more, but 10 min minimum.) \n This makes it clear to me that this is a repeated task. So for example, if the above case is overdue by 3 days, I might just CANCEL the task to get it out of my hair, and let it roll forward to next Sat. But I wouldn't want to CANCEL a one-off task. I'll let it sit in my Agenda or reschedule it. \n Do you do something similar? Or is there a more emacsian way to do this? I do use org habits for some things, and they are obviously not an issue because they are clearly differentiated from one-off tasks. I like my system, but it's sort of an anti-pattern since it's not automated or checked.

I really appreciate the work hilsner did making doom btw, I use it constantly\n I mainly use emacs for org mode and some light coding. I do use vim bindings. I'm on a mac\n With Doom I feel like there is a lot of extra stuff that I don't need or understand. I like the idea of building something from scratch that is leaner and fits my needs. Also, if I have a question, it's hard to know if it's a doom thing or an emacs thing. I would just learn emacs\n Does that make sense high level? Would it be a crazy amount of work to configure it to what I use emacs for now? I'm willing to do some work to get to a good place, but don't want to be stuck fiddling with it forever either.

The problem is that the prefixes are mostly acronyms, which I like to put in small capitals, and exporting \\autocite[\\textsc{abc};][]{author2022} to LaTeX for somehow doesn't work (it gets converted to \\autocite[\\textsc{abc};][]\\{author2022\\}).\n How can I produce the citation with a prefix that ends in a semicolon?

After each run the scripts upload everything (binaries produced and scripts used) here:\n https://corwin.bru.st/emacs-28\n In addition to what gets posted to the alpha FTP site, the scripts make and upload \"NATIVE_FULL_AOT\" versions (from the emacs-28 and master branches, currently).\n If you aren't familiar, passing NATIVE_FULL_AOT=1 to make triggers full ahead-of-time native elisp compilation. In the case of Windows builds, this means the build will include DLLs for most/all elisp sources distributed with Emacs. These DLLs can be used without additional pre-requisites apart from what is included in emacs-<version>.zip (or emacs-<version>-installer.exe). This is useful when you can't --don't want-- to put GCC/libgccjit on a Windows system where you use Emacs.\n Thanks much for all of the help testing out the builds I've been making and in advance for your feedback on the AOT versions.\n    submitted by    /u/mplscorwin  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm still learning the editor (and the language), but the part I'm having the most trouble adapting to is C-z C-x C-c C-v commands that are standard with Windows. Given that I've used those commands since I've used computers in general, I don't think it's going to be easy to switch over.\n I've seen that there is a mode that sort of removes that possibility, CUA mode, but it seems like it would interfere with most of the slime commands. C-c and C-x seem to be very busy keys.\n And so I have thought of a solution that I think would work, and it's crackpot enough that I think trying it will be fun. I'm not completely sure it will work, and so am requesting community input.\n OK, so here's the plan. I'm going to de-mothball my custom keyboard which allows me to remap keys. Then I would remap the Caps-Lock key to one of the F13-F24 keys, and then using that as the Control for emacs sequences. C-c would be (Caps lock)-c and C-x would be (Caps lock)-x. I think that's possible to change in my init file? Emacs has proven to be a remarkable beast in its extensibility and I'm like 90% sure that this is doable.\n Anyway, I am wondering if there is some obvious problem with this plan, other than the glaringly obvious one which is that it's less trouble to just learn the shortcuts.

Running 27.2 and I use ibuffer with ibuffer-formats and ibuffer-saved-filter-groups to organize all my types of files and directories I'm working on. I want a column that contains the directory paths to the buffers' files. I want this so I can display it with ibuffer-formats and filter on it in ibuffer-saved-filter-groups to keep track of files with the same name but for different projects.\n I've defined a couple of simple columns but can't figure out how to do this for path. I looked at the standard ones in ibuffer.el like filename but the code is a bit beyond my pay grade. I'd really appreciate any help or pointers for this. Some day I'll have time to become an emacs-lisp guru, but that time, unfortunately, is not now.\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/quantum_mattress  \n [link]   [comments]",

Based on my experience over the years and specially in the recent times, not many people know about the wonderful world of Emacs and why it is such a fascinating tool. To me they are missing out a chance to enjoy Emacs. So, a while ago I've decided to create a video series and talk about Emacs Lisp in context of a long running project to create an \"editor\" with Emacs Lisp, In hope to help more people to enjoy the tool that changed the way I use computers and brought me joy over all these years.\n Yesterday, I recorded the 4th episode of the video series. I thought to myself that It might be a good idea to share it on this subreddit as well. I have a looooooong term plan for this series and looking forward to your feedback.\n Like to the latest episode(4): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NE1XUfrrGYI\n Link to the playlist: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkfndJuDzsA&list=PLlONLmJCfHToFfk1WgTOwZMfIr062jIN9&index=1\n Cheers\n    submitted by    /u/lxsameer  \n [link]   [comments]",

Sometimes I will open a python file before realising I am in the wrong conda environment.

If I do:\n (add-hook 'conda-postactivate-hook (lambda () (eglot-reconnect)))\n Note I am using the conda.el package for conda environment switching.\n This does not work, instead I get the error \"Error running timer: Process EGLOT (test/python-mode) not running\"\n Is there a way for me to cleanly restart Eglot in the buffer as though I had changed environments before visiting the file?

I was half watching a video on YouTube, and when it finished, a new video automatically played, which talked about a system called Zettelkasten. As it was explained, I realised this was exactly what I had been looking for, for years. Over the last few years I have read hundreds of books and listened to thousands of podcast episodes and diligently made notes on much of that content and then placed it in Evernote never to be seen again!\nI'm still deciding on what tools to use to create my own Zettelkasten, and the Evernote tomb could be revived and used as a kind of fleeting notes folder, and then slowly go through the 12,000+ notes in there and transition them into literature/permanent notes, to convert that information into useable knowledge.\nSince discovering that video, I have listened to an audiobook version of \"How to take smart notes\", watched several videos from Bryan Jenks, Martin Adams and others, in order to have a really good understanding of how to go about setting up my first zettelkasten.",

I'm in the process of adding Structure Notes to my Zettelkasten and your script is perfect for part of the job involved.\nHowever, I've run into the problem described in this post's title. To make sure that I'm understood and to include all potentially important information, I'll elaborate.\nI have an outline whose filename is 202204091330 s2 Obsidian.md. It lists links in the same vein as the outline example from your post about the script. This file is in the home folder of my Ubuntu 21.10.

At a closer look, I find the whole content of a Zettel that wasn't linked to, spread 16 times thorough it. Unlike the other Zettels, the <!-- § --> part doesn't include its unique identifier. I checked my Zettelkasten to see if its unique identifier happened to be that of another Zettel, but it wasn't the case. The Zettels from the outline don't link to this Zettel and this Zettel doesn't link to them.\nAny idea of what I could be doing wrong? I'll include any information you need on demand.",

What are the defining characteristics of each and how are they related according to your vocabulary?\nHow I use the terms:\nA zettelkasten is a collection of notes in which the notes are not categorised into different folders, but organised via unambiguous links between each other (and optionally tags). There is no restriction on the type of notes that a zettelkasten can contain.\nA wiki is a special kind of zettelkasten that only contains notes about objects. The links between notes are usually created automatically: a link is inserted whenever a term is mentioned that refers to an object on which there is a note in the wiki. A personal wiki would be a wiki on which only one person works, which is usually not intended for the public.\nIs that how other people use the terms as well? @ctietze's comment here suggests that that's not the case – curious as to what other people mean by it...",

          "description": "Hi everyone!\nI'm in the process of switching over from Obsidian to the Archive, in an attempt to make my note taking less distracted and more future-proof. As I understand it now, the best way to future-proof linking files is to enclose only the note ID in square brackets and put the title outside of it, instead of enclosing the whole title in brackets. I realize that by doing that I'm giving up easily linking whenever I go back to Obsidian, Zettlr, Bear or other note-taking apps, right? While this is of some concern to me, my main concern has to do with the seemingly immense work that would go into changing all the links in my Zettelkasten to this new format. I currently have around 700 notes and I don't even know how many links. To do this manually would take so much time and energy that I'm doubting if it's worth it. Does anyone maybe know of a way to do this efficiently, without having to manually change all the links?",

As a visual thinker and sketchnoter my first idea was to use this method to combine visual thinking with networked thinking. Taking smart notes is great, but taking smart sketchnotes would be even greater.\nTo summarize the content of a book like this within one sketchnote is not that easy. So I started to summarize one main aspect witch is important for a reader of Ahrens’ book to work with the Zettelkasten method. It’s the major workflow starting with filling the inbox till using the content of the growing slip-box to produce an output of higher value. I added the tools I’m using in this process and also the page numbers from the book as a reference for further reading and understanding the underlying method.\nYou are also working with Obsidian and Zettelkasten?

          "description": "Hi Zettlers,\ndoes anyone speak (write and read) Sanskrit? If yes, how does it feel compared to English or other languages you speak?\nI am asking because I think about learning Sanskrit to improve my thinking.\nExample: To me, German is very sensitive compared to English. In German, tiny differences in wording make a huge difference in meaning and tone. English is much more simple.\nA (translated) quote that is very telling:\n\n  \nFrench is a noble park, Italian a big, bright and colourful wood. But German is more like a primeval forest, as thick and mysterious, as lacking big trails and yet full of hidden paths. You can’t get lost in a park, and not that easily and dangerously in the Italian wood’s brightness; but in German can disappear in the thicket within four, five minutes. Because the paths are so difficult to follow, most try to march as straight as possible through it. Actually, this is against it’s against the nature of this language. Sure, it has a principal direction, but yet invites by hundred trails and hidden paths left and right to depart from it, and soon back to it.\n\n\n\nI butchered the quote through translation because it makes heavy use of the peculiarities of the German language.\nThat is the reason why translations from German into English are very difficult.\nThat is the reason why I plan to provide my own translation of the core texts of Luhmann in some distant future.\nLive long and prosper\nSascha",
