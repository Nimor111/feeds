Conveniently, I can express this using QuantifiedConstraints, and make properly make use of that constraint in the function's body. The problem is that I never seem to be able to call that function in a way that it satisfies this quantified constraint, and I don't know how to tell Haskell that it does actually satisfy this constraint forall t :: Foo in this case.

These proposals can be:\n  \nCommunity RFCs that seek the community’s input on a project\n Community projects that will be executed primarily by the proposer, but seek administrative or financial support from the HF\n HF projects that a community member would like us to execute\n Other topics of relevance to the community\n  \nVolunteers wanted!\n We presently have three openings on the working group, and we’re seeking volunteers. Members are expected to attend a monthly meeting, to participate in and moderate discussion threads regarding specific proposals, and to evaluate proposals for their technical merits. From time to time, committee members may also be asked to help a community member revise their proposal. The ability to communicate well and respectfully is important for any potential member.\n These discussions have a real impact on the Haskell ecosystem, so this is an opportunity to give back in a meaningful way.\n If you are interested, or if you know someone who might be, please get in touch with me at director@haskell.foundation! You don’t have to be a long-term Haskeller, or someone who is deeply embedded in Haskell development - we have members with this background already. If you are unsure as to whether you would fit in, please get in touch, and we can have a chat about it.

Monads in Clean are therefore just a helpful tool to facilitate sequences of computations. In Haskell, however, monads like IO seem a bit hacky with their lots of magic in the background, where only the compiler developers themselves probably know how they actually work. This magic has always irritated me and distorted the idea of monads.\n This brings to mind the idea of creating a resource like a file completely referentially transparent as a mere program object, and manipulating it, just as you can do with numbers or other simple values, without actually causing anything outside of the programming. You're just describing the transformations. And only when you actually want to perform all these operations in the real world you add “*World” and continue working with an unique object standing for an entity in the real world.\n    submitted by    /u/ThyringerBratwurst  \n [link]   [comments]",

Thanks! \n I am looking for an async programming model like boost asio (the proactor design pattern) in haskell. I am not sure how to articulate it for a web search but essentially what I am looking for is to translate a toy asio server in C++ with callbacks to haskell. \n I can (and did) implement this using forkIO + Chan but I am curious if the following has a name in haskell.\n type Context mkSocket :: Context -> IO Socket recvData :: Socket -> (Buffer -> IO a) -> IO () runContextFor :: Duration -> Context -> IO () \n Here, each Context should be able to manage its own event backend (epoll, select, IOCP) without depending on the haskell runtime. Ideally, I should be able to run the event loop every once in a while manually. Am I going in the right direction here?\n In spirit of the X-Y problem, what I am trying to solve is a reader on a socket forkIO $ forever (recvFrom sock 512 >>= doSth) should be interruptible and I should be able to interrupt this \"blocking\" wait on the thread. I guess I can do the following but they don't feel clean\n  \nby closing the socket and forcing an exception on all readers\n set a socket receive timeout and exit the \"blocking\" wait periodically\n use a System.Timeout.timeout on a read and poll\n  \n   submitted by    /u/taxeee  \n [link]   [comments]",

We were lucky enough that for our usecase this was fine. TH was not very pleasant to use and the approach is rather limiting.\n Project 2 was simply relying on the developers to not forget to add the appropriate filter.\n Project 3 uses a custom database library that has quite a lot of type level wizardry but it basically boils down to attaching the tenant id filter at the end of each query. The downside is that we basically need to reimplement everything that already exists in established DB libraries from scratch. Joins are a pain so we resort to SQL views for more complicated queries.\n Is there an established way people go about this?

Most of the problems involve searching/traversal of the graph, and I'm pretty confused about how to approach the solutions idiomatically. I'm looking for some help in evaluating one the following options:\n  \nBasic recursion: Pass the state around during recursive calls, and use if-then-else to prune/terminate as necessary. This is the simplest choice, but results in similar-looking boilerplate code. \n Same as above but using the State monad.\n Model a search problem as a tuple of (start value, expanding frontier function, terminating condition), and provide implementations of the 2nd and 3rd items for each algorithm. This model is shown here and looks promising in reducing boilerplate.\n Read a novel academic paper, like Structuring Depth-First Search Algorithms in Haskell or Backtracking, Interleaving, and Terminating Monad Transformers and come up with an implementation. FWIW, it seems like the Data.Graph library implementation is based on the former paper (but for the purposes of the exercise I shouldn't use).\n Logic and Continuation: This option is mentioned in passing in some places but there is exactly zero online literature available as far as any practical examples go. None whatsoever. I don't even know why would I choose this option, other than it potentially reducing boilerplate. The H-99 problems aren't for infinite graphs, and ask for all answers, not the first one, so, fairness/interleaving isn't really a concern.\n  \nA somewhat related question had been asked before, although it focussed on a specific advent of code problem and lacked the research I've laid out above. Nothing against the question, just saying that the comments there don't preempt my question.\n What would be the most elegant option?

I love the idea of doing it in Haskell and also doing it properly™ (i.e. overengineering the hell outta it lol).\n I already have a program (involuntarily written in Java) to store/output the board state and determine whether someone won.\\ What I intend to create is the following: 1. a protocol between the Java program and 2. (see below)\\ this will contain things like \"NEWGAME\", \"TURN xy\", \"RESPONSE zw\", etc. 2. a Haskell program that implements that protocol to actually generate a good next move and send it back to the Java application, which 3. I will modify to be able to talk to my \"engine\"\n So what is your folks' opinion on how to structure the Haskell code / protocol?\\ I came up with this: - CECP-/UCI-like protocol: one move sent at a time, my program would need to store that somehow\\ however, I don't have any idea on how to elegantly do this in Haskell and wonder whether it can even be done idiomatically - get the complete board state as input each time and output the next move / new state; as easy as it gets and seems to fit really well with the functional paradigm BUT extremely inefficient and not what I would do if I was programming it in another language (also apparently not how most protocols work…)\n Dear, epic, most valued, mathematically blessed computer scientists, can you bestow some advice upon me, so I can maybe become worthy of joining your ranks one day?\n Thanks in advance and happy holidays! :)\n    submitted by    /u/TheKiller36_real  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Dear Haskellers,\n I have a question about streaming libraries (streamly, conduit, streaming, etc.). I am trying to write a little application to remap user input events (keyboard, mouse, etc.) so I am dealing with low-volume, lazy streams. Additionally, the actual remapping will depend on a user configuration file. \n I have gotten suggestions to use a streaming library to represent the basic datatype in my app, something I did look into but quickly abandoned because of a rather daunting amount of choice and considerations. However, now is the time for me to make a decision, since going back and refactoring everything after the fact is going to be a huge time-sink. So:\n I am currently under the impression that the biggest benefit of the streaming libraries is speed, and that that speed is generated by doing ghc-optimization tricks. I am also under the impression that speed is not that important in my domain, and that since I don't know which stream-transformations I will be composing at compile time (since I'll be reading the transformations from user-config), I wouldn't even be able to benefit from these performance gains.\n Is my understanding correct? Am I missing something? My home-rolled solution uses binary and a Chan and async to set up different event readers by parsing from lazy bytestrings, writing to the chan to merge the results, and then represents the input as a lazy, infinite list that then gets passed to my pure remapping engine. It seems to work fine. Am I setting myself up for some unforeseen disaster in the future? \n The reason I've been avoiding these solutions is also just because my productive time is limited and very unreliable, so the cognitive overhead of a completely new set of abstractions comes with its own cost.\n Thank you for any advice you may proffer.\n    submitted by    /u/janssen_dhj  \n [link]   [comments]",

I want the type signatures in the API to be as clean as possible, and avoid the need for so many type ascriptions in code using the API, which is why I'd like to make this work somehow.\n I have a typeclass A with a non injective associated type Context\n class A a where type Context a \n so many instances of A can have the same Context.\n Some instances of A are also instances of the class AA, that has two additional associated types, B and C.\n class (A a) => AA a where type B a type C a problematic :: Context a -> B a -> C a -> a \n The intention is that given a Context, the combination of B a and C a uniquely identify a, but I don't know how to express this.\n I know it's possible to make constraints like\n class A a where type B a = b | b -> a \n , but what I need is some kind of constraint with multiple parameters, like (Context a, B a, C a) -> a.

          "description": "This is a recurring issue for me when I do Advent of Code, which I do in Haskell - some problems are really suited for using memoization. I tried to condense my confusion to as close to the pain point as possible, and I am hoping someone here can help me understand where my thinking goes wrong. Here is a code block with a few different ways of calculating a Fibonacci sequence:\n import Data.Function.Memoize main :: IO () main = do -- slow print $ fib 35 -- fast print $ fibMemo 35 -- slow print $ (memoize fibMemo2) 35 fib :: Int -> Int fib 0 = 1 fib 1 = 1 fib n = fib (n-1) + fib (n-2) fibMemo :: Int -> Int fibMemo = memoize fib' where fib' 0 = 1 fib' 1 = 1 fib' n = fibMemo (n-1) + fibMemo (n-2) fibMemo2 :: Int -> Int fibMemo2 0 = 1 fibMemo2 1 = 1 fibMemo2 n = (memoize fibMemo2) (n-1) + (memoize fibMemo2) (n-2) \n Note here that two functions are really slow - both the first and last one. But in my mind, the second one (which is fast) is exactly the same as the third one (which is slow). What is the difference here? Both of them recursively call memoize on themselves, which tells me I am missing something critical.\n    submitted by    /u/JGuillou  \n [link]   [comments]",

I didn't initialize or setup any of the programs.\n ​\n The class inspired me to try and code more here at home, I just got a book, Learning Physics with Functional Programming. They use Haskell as the language. I've got a macbook, and I have no idea how to set anything up. I barely understand what I'm doing. Believe me I've been watching tutorial after tutorial, but there's always some error I get that these tutorials don't address. I'm trying to become code literate.\n ​\n In that case I thought maybe I could get help here? I went to Haskell.org, and used the terminal command from there to install GHcup. Afterwards, I opened up VScode and downloaded the Haskell extension. Then, I tried to start a new project and begin working along the book I bought. \n The problem is that anytime I set Haskell as my language for a new note in VScode, it gives the error that \"Project requires GHcup but it isn't installed. Source: Haskell (extension)\"\n ​\n I've tried going into my ~bash file to inspect the path of the GHcup file, but the terminal denies me access to it. I'm not even sure if that's what would help fix this either, but I saw a lot of reference to this on Haskell Troubleshooting forum links from VScode.\n ​\n Sorry for my incapability... this kinda makes me want to keep using my whiteboard for physics but I really want to be able to do bigger calculations on a computer, and not on Python.\n ​\n If I could get any help I'd appreciate it a lot\n    submitted by    /u/redflactober  \n [link]   [comments]",

Cmd+Tab doesn't respond immediately, or it is frozen for a moment then the selection moves quickly a few more icons to right.\n I tried VS Codium + Metals to edit the same project and it is more responsive but I don't like it as much as IntelliJ.\n I also run a Windows 10 VM in desktop parallels and, believe it or not, I installed the same version of IntelliJ and it is more responsive than the mac version. I think I am going to continue on windows in the short term.\n I am just curious about few things if you don't mind sharing your experience:\n  \ndo you use Intellij on Linux and if yes, what is the performance like, assuming that you don't run it on apple hardware?\n if you run IntelliJ on a newer mac with the apple CPU, what is the performance like?\n any suggestions/recommendations on how to improve the performance of IntelliJ on the mac?\n  \nAnd just a side note, because I read the MBP 2019 16\" intel has some problems handling external monitors, I should mention I do use an external 4K Dell monitor, but I do not experience the problems described in this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlUmnVYPcKM .\n Thank you\n ​\n ​\n    submitted by    /u/0110001001101100  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I observed lately that there is a lot of division in Scala community. There are multiple groups of users, some more vocal than others.\n This is counterproductive as people have different requirements, tastes, styles, and backgrounds.\n In my view, this goes against what Scala stands for, a Scalable language:\n \"A programming language designed to adapt to the evolving needs of its users.\"\n However, not all users have the same requirements. There is no one solution for everyone.\n Is there a way in 2024 to make the Scala community more inclusive and accept that every group has its pros and cons for the technical choices they make?\n Here are some groups I observed, mainly around async handling:\n  \nPeople who try to write everything with IO.\n People who keep using Scala Future.\n People who use plain threads / scala-async / project Loom / direct style.\n  \nWhile you may have a preference for one group, we should all agree that there is nothing wrong with choosing one or another. It's just a matter of personal preference and the overall requirements and trade-offs.\n It's essential to recognise that outside the Scala community, some of these paradigms represent the majority.\n For example, Scala Future behave the same as the Kotlin CompletableFuture, the Java CompletableFuture, the NodeJS Promise.\n What's nice about each group is that people coming from Haskell/familiar with IO monad may be at home in group 1.\n People coming from Java/Kotlin/Javascript will be at home in groups 3 and 2.\n People coming from Python will be at home in group 3.\n So, instead of being consumed by division. Can the community be joined by the diversity and cooperation instead?\n It's a Scalable language where everyone can be at home. We all have to win with Scala being a multi-purpose language as it was intended.\n Much love to each of the groups, have a wonderful day!\n    submitted by    /u/Previous_Pop6815  \n [link]   [comments]",

You can attach predicates (also called \"refinements\") to type and ensure they pass at compile-time or runtime:\n scala val x: Int :| Positive = 5 val y: Int :| Positive = -5 //Compile-time error val z: Either[String, Int :| Positive] = -5.refineEither //Left(\"...\") \n Check the README for further information.\n Main changes\n Doobie & Skunk support\n You can use Iron types in your query and tables. Here is an example using iron-doobie:\n ```scala import doobie.* import doobie.implicits.*\n import io.github.iltotore.iron.* import io.github.iltotore.iron.constraint.all.* import io.github.iltotore.iron.doobie.given\n opaque type CountryCode = Int :| Positive o…",

The book defines its own Monad trait, and asks for some implementations. I want to verify that my implementations satisfy the Monad laws, so, I'm attempting to create some tests.\n Let me first show a test I wrote for testing Monoid left identity law.\n trait Monoid[A]: ... trait MonoidLaws { this: AnyFunSpec & ScalaCheckPropertyChecks => def leftIdentityLaw[A: Arbitrary: Monoid]: Unit = val instanceM = summon[Monoid[A]] \n The tests are called as shown below:\n describe(\"Integers form a Monoid under addition\"): import MonoidInstances.intAddition leftIdentityLaw[Int] rightIdentityLaw[Int] associativityLaw[Int] \n Along the same lines, Monad and Monad laws:\n trait Functor[F[_]]: ... trait Monad[F[_]] extends Functor[F]: ... def leftIdentityLaw[A: Arbitrary, B: Arbitrary[A => F[B]]](using mA: Monad[F]): Unit = it(\"should satisfy the left identity law\"): forAll { (x: A, f: A => F[B]) => mA.unit(x).flatMap(f) shouldBe f(x) } \n However, the leftIdentityLaw test doesn't compile. What would be the corect type signature for it?\n Edit:\n After some trial and error, I found the a working solution, but I don't like it having an unused arbAToFB name.\n trait MonadLaws[F[_]] { this: AnyFunSpec & ScalaCheckPropertyChecks => def leftIdentityLaw[A: Arbitrary, B: Arbitrary](using arbAToFB: Arbitrary[A => F[B]], mA: Monad[F]): Unit = it(\"should satisfy the left identity law\"): forAll { (x: A, f: A => F[B]) => mA.unit(x).flatMap(f) shouldBe f(x) } \n ​\n    submitted by    /u/sarkara1  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "There are things about data engineering I've really enjoyed, but after 2 years it has started to become quite stale and boring. The part of the job I have enjoyed the most is when I get to work with python and spark (the more software engineery stuff with data engineering). So given that scala is the language spark was written in, and what many data engineers had been using for a long time (and some still do), I decided it could be worthwhile learning.\n Also, I'd really like to transition into a more software engineering centric role in my next job, and have been learning Scala as a means by which to achieve this. My logic was that if I learn Scala the worst case scenario is that I get better at coding, (data engineering with python will only take you so far in terms of developing software engineering skills), and even though it is dying out as a language for DE in favour of python, it might help with employability for DE jobs. The upside is I may be able to get a Scala Developer/Engineer role that pays better, and which I may be better suited to and enjoy more.\n After reading a lot of posts on this subreddit, it seems people are growing increasingly pessimistic regarding the employability of scala, so I wanted some general advice regarding my approach. My current plan has been: Learn Scala -> Personal Projects -> Scala Data Engineer / Scala Engineer -> Scala Engineer/Developer. From what I have seen online Scala Engineer Jobs in my area (London) are very lucrative but I imagine there is a high barrier to entry, and worry that this transition isn't realistic.\n I'm currently working through the Scala RocktheJVM course and am enjoying what I have learnt so far, and will likely continue regardless. Any advice/thoughts would be much appreciated.\n    submitted by    /u/New_Performance5582  \n [link]   [comments]",

Website is here, code here.\n Besides the code not being the cleanest (beginner programmer – all advice welcome), there's one bug I haven't been able to crush: on Firefox you can accidentally right-click a cleared square and get a context menu popup. This is not desirable, as it at best slows you down and at worst leads to accidentally leaving the page via said menu.\n Relevant code from Main.scala:\n dom.document.addEventListener(\"contextmenu\", e => e.preventDefault()) \n On Chromium things work as expected – no context menu anywhere, ever.\n What I've tried:\n  \nonContextMenu --> { e => e.preventDefault() } literally everywhere: buttons, tbody, table etc.\n onContextMenu --> { e => println(\"here\") } similarly everywhere to find out that when right-clicking a disabled button, nothing on the page seems to receive the pointer event, meaning there's nothing to block it, which then leads to Firefox opening the context menu\n pointer-events: none; for disabled buttons, which breaks things on (at least some) mobile browsers since the browser thinks that a tap on a disabled button was \"really\" meant for its neighbour, which is... not good!\n  \nSo, is this something that needs to be fixed in Firefox, or am I missing something obvious?\n Thanks.\n edit. This is a Firefox bug https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1543196 \n Minimal reproducible example for this particular case just because:\n <!DOCTYPE html> <head> <style> body { margin: 0; padding: 0; height: 100vh; } </style> </head> <body oncontextmenu=\"return false;\"> <button>No context menu</button> <button disabled=\"true\">Context menu :(</button> </body> </html> \n ​\n    submitted by    /u/scalaccount  \n [link]   [comments]",

Conversely, time tracking only happens at the daily-level and it's never reflected back to the original issue. Also, having tasks as sub-items in the dailies makes it easy to track all tasks by searching for roam back references, but at the same time it creates a lot of duplication because sub tasks are not carried over to the next day for example.\n Here I'm asking for your opinion, because I'm not sure if I'm just using org and roam the \"wrong way\" and I'm not supposed to try to achieve any of this, or if it's a somewhat valid approach and I just need to automate it.\n Thank you all!\n ​\n ​\n    submitted by    /u/zuegg  \n [link]   [comments]",

(I can understand that pandoc makdown conversion should not know to convert :eval no to #| eval: false in the code block but that is secondary).\n I could write a post-text-processing script to handle this but I wonder if there is a more direct way to at least get the language specification to be {python} instead of python or {.python ...}. I have also tried exporting to other Markdown flavors using pandoc, and using Org-mode's built-in Markdown exporter. I guess the built-in exporter targets the original Markdown\n # Table of Contents import matplotlib.pyplot as plt plt.plot([1, 2], [2, 4]) print(\"Hello World!\") \n so is even further away from the Quarto form.\n AFAIK the Quarto documentation only defines the Quarto -> Org transformation and not the other way around. \n Thanks for your suggestions.\n    submitted by    /u/hat_matrix  \n [link]   [comments]",

Instead, I am greeted by this: (invalid-function org-assert-version), and a message saying there was a problem in loading the configuration file. Running Emacs --debug-init on the terminal would create a long list of errors.

I did found some sty files, but all of them have multiline definitions, so I cannot just put a #+LATEX_HEADER: behind every line. neither can I just make a macro and deal with it manually as it is more than 1000 lines long.\n Is there a way to use it directly or any convenient way to change it?

I can't seem to translate what I have in my head into code, which is an unusual and frustrating experience for me.\n What I'd like to do is, when I'm specifically working on a Python project, have my frame set up so that there's a main window with the buffer I'm working on, then to the right is a python REPL, and to the left is a switchable choice between an xrefs list and a directory tree. What I'd like to do is set up the position and sizing of all of these by mouse-dragging them to how I want them, then saving that configuration somehow. Then, crucially, having this configuration and sizing be entered when I visit a python buffer and python-mode launches, and exited back to \"normal\" emacs when I leave python-mode except in a couple of instances.\n Has anyone done something like this? If so, could you share your config? I don't know what it is about Emacs's window manager but each one of these requirements has so many moving pieces in different parts of the system that I just have trouble wrapping my head around the whole.\n    submitted by    /u/Venthorn  \n [link]   [comments]",

I check the load-path and see that lsp-mode is no longer its part, even though it was a user selected package. I do a package-reinstall for it, restart Emacs and it no longer starts: on mac, the icon jumps at the bottom of the screen for a second and goes away. Adding --debug-init isn't helpful. Since my package directory is versioned, I git restore it, and it does not help, neither does deleting the ELN cache.\n Then I wipe my package directory and install user selected packages one by one, and everything goes fine until I get to helm-org. Install it, and Emacs fails to start. Restore an older copy of package directory (not using git restore) which does not have it, Emacs starts. This package has been installed for ages without any issues before.\n What is this I don't even. Of course for now I fixed my setup with helm-org removed, but how do I get to the bottom of the issue?\n    submitted by    /u/kastauyra  \n [link]   [comments]",

I also opted to use a simple indentation based heuristic for figuring out the context as a default. There's customization options to specify different kinds of context functions depending on the major mode. I've included a simple one for org-mode using headings. \n In the future, I might try to add some tree-sitter support when I get a chance to dig into it.\n I named it window-stool cause it acts like a little stool that you can use to glimpse the contents above what your window can normally see.\n I've been using it for a little while, ironing out kinks along the way so hopefully there aren't too many issues with others using it, but I'd appreciate any feedback for problems that crop up.

I did the built-in tutorial and followed a couple of SystemCrafters’s “Emacs From Scratch” videos, and I’m facing a dilemma right now.\n Of course, evil-mode is hugely popular and has a lot of support, often being called the best vim emulator. Even SystemCrafters uses it, which to me, is a big vouch for using it.\n However, in reading some other reddit posts about others asking this same question, many people said that it had compatibility issues with some plugins, and relying on vim emulators has always left a bad taste in my mouth from other editors. Also, as a new emacs user, I don’t know how much of the emacs experience changes with evil-mode, and I don’t have the knowledge to be able to thoroughly understand and debug any issues that might come up from using it.\n So, I’m mostly just looking for some affirmation and anecdotes, good and bad, about evil-mode: if it will hurt me as a new user, and generally any heads-ups that could help me.

          "description": "Over the past decade, pixel density of displays has increased significantly. On Mac, the \"Retina\" display concept represents a doubling of display density, from ~100 to ~200ppi. On HDPI Retina displays, applications are presented with and work in \"virtual\" pixels of 2x2 physical screen pixels, so that font sizes, icons, etc. remain \"normal\". Then raster, vector and font drawing can make use of all the tiny pixels, for higher quality. My question is, how does Emacs on different systems handle HDPI display?\n My build (emacs-mac) provides some limited support for varying DPI. You can provide parallel high-res versions of image files named like file@2x.ext which are substituted for low-DPI images (without the @2x) automatically. You can similarly embed the text property :data-2x in generated image data. But standalone high density images (like Retina screenshots) must be scaled appropriately (often by 0.5x) to \"light all the pixels\" and not appear overly large.\n What do other ports do to accommodate high-DPI? Nothing? Do you just select very large font sizes? What if you have multiple displays with significantly different pixel density connected? How is image display handled? This seems like an area where some coherent treatment and documentation would be very helpful. But perhaps the underlying OS/display systems vary so greatly in their treatment of HDPI it limits this kind of progress?\n    submitted by    /u/JDRiverRun  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "So I followed the mastering emacs guide to installing tree-sitter but am left a bit confused about what actually these additional major modes are and have some questions.\n  \nWhat is the difference between the installing the package tree-sitter and building emacs with tree-sitter? Which one should I use given both options? \n Do these new ts major modes serve to replace existing modes or do they sit on-top of the regular modes? So If I was using rustic package for rust development, does rust-ts-mode essentially replace the rustic package or would I still need it? \n How would you tell emacs to use tree-sitter mode if there are no default major modes for the language to begin with? For example rust or go don't have built-in modes like python or bash do so a command like (setq major-mode-remap-alist '((go-mode . go-ts-mode))) would not work unless you explicitly install the go-mode package.\n  \n   submitted by    /u/JoeKazama  \n [link]   [comments]",

As the toolkit scrollbars in Emacs are nevertheless handy, I tinkered a bit to solve both problems: * 1: on-demand-scroll-bar-mode is an alternative to scroll-bar-mode that shows vertical scroll bars only when needed https://github.com/florommel/on-demand-scroll-bar * 2: custom-css allows to load arbitrary CSS snippets to style Emacs's GTK widgets. It comes with a dedicated mode to change the scrollbar visuals, as this requires special care. However, you can also adapt all other GTK widgets inside Emacs (menu bar, tool bar, context menus). The package requires a C module to be built and loaded and works only with GTK builds of Emacs. https://github.com/florommel/custom-css\n Both packages are experimental. Of course, they can be used independently from each other.\n    submitted by    /u/florommel  \n [link]   [comments]",

Either because I managed to configure something and someone needed help (like typescript on a React environment) or I needed help doing something and I was \"afraid\" of sharing it.\n Unfortunately my dotfile (yes, it was a ~/.emacs file) was ugly, old, slow and full of personal stuff.\n I managed to make it faster (0.6 seconds loadtime with ~95 packages on Linux), somewhat organized and (I hope) free of personal stuff.\n This config focuses on having the SAME (or close) user experience on both TUI and GUI. \n Nowadays you can do things on tmux, for example, and you want to use Emacs as a sole editor with `emacs -nw` (the same fashion Neovim users do), others times you may want Emacs also as your terminal emulator and project organizer, you may want to start several instances of Emacs for gnus, ERC or other stuff, on either TUI or GUI. This config aims this situations, so nothing should be missing from GUI to TUI. You can even start it as a daemon and use at the same time on terminal and GUI without breaking anything.\n On this screenshot we have TUI (left) and GUI (right):\n https://preview.redd.it/esot9k1zw89c1.png?width=2880&format=png&auto=webp&s=c338016527f3c76f235c6e848d6db63759f5202f\n It is made in a single file, using as much of default Emacs as possible, so you can fork it, customize or get inspired. It is not, by any means an \"Emacs Distro\".\n I'd love some nice feedbacks (preferably on Github issues so we can track and reuse issues).\n Github: https://github.com/LionyxML/lemacs\n Install instructions on Readme.org\n ​\n    submitted by    /u/LionyxML  \n [link]   [comments]",

I understand they are different, but I'm not getting why the one is able to be displayed and the other is not.\n I've read every article I could find on this sub and google about Emojis in Emacs on Windows, but most articles are either 2+ year old, or have some broken links and succeeded to fix this issue.\n I'm running native Emacs on Windows, I'm not using WSL. I'm using Emacs 28.2.\n I have installed all-the-icons. I also have installed \"Noto Color Emoji\" and put this in my ~/.emacs:\n (set-fontset-font t 'symbol \"Noto Color Emoji\")\n And evaluated. I've also tried with \"native\" windows emoji font: Segoe UI Emoji, but same story.\n I'm getting the emoji in the buffer, but it's invisible. If I copy it from, say, emojipedia and CTRL + y in a buffer, the cursor moves as if something was inserted, but nothing is shown as if I inserted a SPC.\n However if I CTRL+a CTRL+k and then paste it in, say, my browser, I get all the emojis I've inserted in the buffer.\n My question is - Has the Windows API changed(that is the reason, allegedly, why it didn't work in the past as I've read about this issue on this sub) or is there some other way to display emojis in Emacs buffer on Windows 10 that bypasses this API problem or whichever other problem there is.\n On my Linux machine everything works fine, however, unfortunately, sometimes I'm forced to use Windows and thus want to make it work here as well.\n    submitted by    /u/aqua_cap  \n [link]   [comments]",

Since it is a new note, I click on citar-open-notes, which automatically extracts the title and author and populates it into my capture template:\n  (org-roam-capture-templates '((\"n\" \"literature note\" plain \"%?\" :target (file+head \"${slug}.org\" \"#+title: ${title}\\n#+filetags: :paper:\\n#+author: ${author}\\n#+created: %U\\n#+STARTUP: latexpreview\\n\") :unnarrowed t))) \n Now, my bibtex file contains information about the paper's year, and journal and I was hoping to extract it automatically just like it does with the ${title} and ${author}, but it does not appear to be the case. So I was wondering how this can be achieved such that citar automatically extracts the other pieces of info in the citation.

          "description": "My work involves a fair amount of time spent in the terminal, in docker containers, on remote machines via ssh, and sometimes in containers on remote machines. To support this, I’ve developed a customized terminal experience on kitty. Basically, if I open a new tab, it will clone my current environment, including the container/remote, current directory, and current bashrc. And it also color-codes tabs based on the type of environment I’m in. \n I’m curious if it would be possible/interesting/desirable to recreate this setup in emacs, with the ultimate goal of using emacs as a customized ide + terminal emulator. \n Does anyone have thoughts on this? The first issue that I see is that so far, I haven’t found a tab bar for emacs that supports customizing the colors of the tabs. I’m sure this is possible, but I’m too new to emacs to know how difficult it would be (I have experience coding in multiple lisp dialects, so needing to code in order to customize is not a drawback). Thanks.\n (EDIT: I guess this is partly a question about customizing emacs and partly a question about using emacs as my primary terminal emulator.)\n    submitted by    /u/mister_drgn  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Two days ago I wrote a small experiment that lets me include Lisp as a template placeholders. It looks something like this:\n 1 + 2 = {{ 3 }} 1 + 2 = {{ (+ 1 2) }} 1 + 2 = {{! escaped }} \n I used Mustache-like syntax, to basically just delimit Lisp region from the rest of the text. However, due to Lisp paranthesized syntax it is possible to simplify it. I have now re-written it so it just needs one marker to mark which expression is to be evaluated as Lisp:\n 1 + 2 = %%3 1 + 2 = %%(+ 1 2) 1 + 2 = %%!escaped \n Due to Emacs being a text processing toolkit and a Lisp repl/environment, that basically let us use Emacs Lisp as a template language in text files. The intended use is file and code generators.\n The simplified syntax turnes out to be slightly harder to process than the one with start and end delimiters, however I think it might be worth, so here is an experiment to test the idea.\n Download and details about the usage details are in online repo.\n I appreciate critique and discussion, especially if you find a bug or some fundamental problem.\n    submitted by    /u/arthurno1  \n [link]   [comments]",

That said, what do you consider bread & butter?\n Even if I don't share your views, I will try to make sure that sources of high value with at least a significant fraction of users are represented.

          "description": "I'd like to use Gnus: its usage paradigm looks appealing and I'd like to use it to navigate mails, newsletters, newsgroups and RSS feeds together with a handful of features like scoring and filtering and big customization - as expected fro Emacs.\n However, I'd like not to renounce (yet?) to the comfort of GUI mail clients (Thunderbird, Evolution, Geany, any is good for me...) in some situations. So the question: is there a way to make them share the same inbox, without having to download the mail twice?. Maybe with a separate process that fetches the emails, so that Gnus does not get stuck doing network operations.\n Additional info: My mail provider is Proton Mail. The question applies mainly to Linux systems. It would be useful to have a similar setup even using Emacs for Android - but I guess it's a chimera.\n Thank you in advance for your help\n    submitted by    /u/cidra_  \n [link]   [comments]",

I appreciate that web-mode is designed for mixed syntax files, if you're say working with templates for front-end web-dev, however I have found it provides far superior syntax highlighting than js2-mode. I haven't noticed any other difference between js2-mode and web-mode apart from this, I guess I've only scratched the surface. I primarily work with js and json files for node.js back-end development and only touch front-end, where I guess web-mode would be excellent a minority of the time. The error highlighting seems to be same for both, driven by lsp-mode. I haven't touched ESlint yet (been using ts-ls so far), only just installed it.\n I guess my questions boil down to:\n Why should I use 1 over the other especially given the syntax highlighting preference?\n How does flycheck / flymake play into this, what are the differences?\n Is it fine to run 2 language servers for lsp-mode / how does that work? Using lsp-describe-session shows both of them running?\n As a side-note does anyone have a config with lsp-ui and peek that they're willing share for some inspiration / things I've missed.\n I also have tern running is this required?\n Thank you in advance.\n ​\n    submitted by    /u/PracticalViking  \n [link]   [comments]",

I finally understood what people mean by \"Don't let your editor get in your way\". It just stopped me from learning this new technology, and had me configuring and finding good packages that allow me to program with it in emacs, and occasionally debugging the previously installed packages like lsp, because either the autocompletion box doesn't show up, or lsp just spits some errors and shuts down.\n Then I used vscode, and wow!

          "description": "Dear Zettlers,\nI am in the process of restructuring my training regimen to align it with the new role of fitness in my life. (You can have a badly translated version of my last article here)\nI am building an inventory of training stimuli for that. I am doing something similar like a factor analysis. For many years, for example, my aerobic endurance (roughly, what you normally associate with endurance if you are not into sports science) training was distributed over many different other training sessions that you'd normally not associate with aerobic endurance. Like that I could skip long sessions of running, biking etc. and use that freed up time and energy for other training while still having a solid aerobic base (for recovery between bouts of intensity and between exercise sessions).\nI thought that I'd create something similar for knowledge work. Examples are items like reading physical books, attributes like screen time (to highlight a benefit of physical books over ebooks) or requirements like daily empty time slots (like my dog walks in which I do nothing, but just listen to the sound of the world).\nSo, what should be considered?\nLive long and prosper\nSascha",

But I don't know if this is good practice. The other options I could use are:\nuse two tags: \"#good #technician\".\nuse only the core of the idea: \"#technician\".\nWhat do you recommend me to do?\nBecause in this note, I just want to refer to good technicians (I don't want to talk about technicians in general).

I saw that he wrote an interesting looking handbook in the mid-1920s and was curious if anyone has come across or even read it? It looks like it went into three editions up to the 1950s. I'm not seeing any English translations at present. I suspect it has material on using card indexes as databases and may be focused on business use, but may also have some connections to note taking practices of the time. I've also found several references to Porstmann's work and that of George Christoph Lichtenberg which makes me even more curious about the potential note taking connections.\nPorstmann, Walter.

My issue here is that I often don't know what information is going to come out of the article until I've read it.  Should I just take my best guess? (am I just overthinking it)?\nShould I keep it on a separate task list or someday/maybe list?  My issue here is that I almost never get to the things on my someday/maybe list because I'm never looking at it when I'm working on a current project, and my task lists quickly get cluttered if they aren't immediately actionable.\nOther ideas?

I'm so glad to have discovered this forum.\nA question has been nagging me ever since I started my ZK journey, and that is: what do I do if I'm into multiple topics?\nMy interests are all over the place: I'm into photography, sociology, history, theology, philosophy, linguistics, and education.\nI am not sure whether I should have one giant slip box for everything or multiple ones for topics that have stuff in common. But that would also raise a conundrum. I'm into photography, and I'm into art history, so those two topics could be in one slip box. But then I'm also into history in general, so should art history be a part of the box with history or photography? Again, this is just an example, not an actual dilemma.\nI'm going through Ahrens' book but I don't know if it will touch on this particular topic. He does mention that Luhmann wrote on all sorts of subjects, which seems to indiciate he had a single slip box system for everything.\nHas anyone here dealt with this?",

Chris Rock writes headlines for his jokes on slips of paper and then arranges them on either tables or small bulletin boards to outline his set list for presenting jokes for his performances.\n\n\nIf there are interesting contemporaneous news items which appear, he'll include a newspaper or other material to represent the related joke for inclusion into his set. This makes a fascinating means of outlining his material and seems to fall within the realm of my search for zettelkasten output processes. Even if Rock doesn't use index cards to write or store his jokes like comedians in the past have, he's using a slip-based method for outlining and arranging them as part of his output process.\n\nKevin Hart: Chris, I'm so... I'm so, uh blown away by what I'm discovering that is your process.\nChris Rock: My process.\nKevin Hart: This all your shit?\n\n\nChris Rock: Well, this here would be, uh, bullet points for tonight. Every card represents a joke or a reference that I choose. I don't wanna forget. You know what I mean? Like, you can remember all your jokes, but some nights, I'm like, 'ehhh, I'm not gonna close with this one. I'm gonna close with that one'.\nKevin Hart: You have it down to a science where you can bullet point the time.\nChris Rock: You can. And by the way, sometimes, something happens in the news.\nKevin Hart: You got jokes on the bench.\nChris Rock: I have jokes on the bench.\n\nKevin Hart: I'm going to tell you I'm not only impressed by that, but I'm disappointed in myself.

MOCs and hub notes feel like a dream for my personal organization. higher-order learning seemed extremely necessary. disregarding the idea of separate disciplines in lieu of an understanding rooted in existing knowledge seemed very helpful.\nnow it's been a couple months and my zettelkasten contains over 100 zettels; i'd say about 20 regarding personal knowledge management and then about 80 medical notes. that is the problem, though. i look at other notemakers' obsidian graphs and they're one big ideaverse of notes radiating from the center. my notes, conversely, are separated into blobs by discipline or level of abstraction from reality. (e.g. anatomy [tangible] vs. study concepts [intangible]) in essence, i want to keep watching my zettelkasten grow--it is helping me retain information--but i'm a bit scared that i'm not implementing higher-order learning correctly.\nthis is making me unsure whether a traditional, luhmann-esque zettelkasten is the best idea for medical study. what do you think? does anyone else have trouble connecting tangible, business-related zettels to more abstract zettels?",

That is:\nHow do you manage questions, which can be ongoing on life? (\"How to be a good man in the 21st Century?\")\nHow do you navigate and evolve forming practices? (Like: the Zettelkasten method, which you hone in through practice, and evolve insight: \"this works for me, I should pay attention to that\")\nHow do you walk back on ideas that do not serve you anymore, or that you realize were false? (like an early 20st Century scientist witnessing the ether being disproved, meaning all theories and constructs pertaining to it become completely irrelevant apart from scientific history)\nI guess the underlying issue is \"transient\" content, which is a little bit at odds with the concept of permanent / evergreen note / Zettel. Now I know a Zettelkasten is personal, that truth is unattainable and everything is potentially transient – please bear with me here 🙂 I also know, in Luhmann's words, that the Zettelkasten is a \"septic tank\".\nAnd yet. What would be best practices for capturing accruing, unformed ideas and questions, which would free the user by knowing they will not pollute the system down the road if they turn out to be dead ends?\nIs it a simple matter of trusting that linking will isolate irrelevant content? Or should you prune links later, remove notes – but potentially destroying the path of thinking that led you to where you are now? Is it a much simpler matter of redirecting the energy of the system simply by altering the geometry of structure notes?\nAny insight and especially technical approaches would be hugely appreciated.

How do you \"enter\" the Zettel, per se?",

I am wondering whether dividing my permanent notes into different folders (related to subject type, such as microsensors, frequency domain concepts, animation techniques, guitar tricks) would be beneficial or harmful in recollection.\nPlease let me know if more info is required to solve this issue.",
