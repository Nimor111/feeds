For example the Semigroup-Monoid proposal could not be implemented with this approach.\n I propose a different approach that doesn't require a superclass, but selects a subset the class methods and gives them a name.

And I was very excited that GHC immediately compiled the code without any problems and the program ran for the first 1000 digits in 10.36 sec. Although it is currently completely unfair to compare this with other implementations since the JS back-end is not optimised in any way it is nonetheless not completely uninteresting and the result was 0.081 sec for the hand-written JS code with node. That's a factor of 128 faster.\n The second program had to create a 1024 pixel wide Mandelbrot bitmap and compiled and worked equally well. It took 77 sec compared with 0.74 sec for the node version which is about 104 times faster.\n Although the numbers might seem far away from a decent performance I am still very excited about the seamless experience and intend to explore this further for future work. Congratulations to the dev team!!!\n There is indeed an optimisation flag -O here as well and when activated the code runs about ten times as fast compared to the above. Therefore the difference to hand-written JS code shrinks considerably.\n    submitted by    /u/tkx68  \n [link]   [comments]",

I found mainly resources about how to structure Haskell libraries not applications. Of course, I’m also thankful for other tips. This is my first serious Haskell project and I love working on it and improving it :)\n Link to the repo: https://github.com/mkoppmann/eselsohr\n    submitted by    /u/gubbsy  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm modelling \"Weather Station\", which currently looks as follows:\n ```haskell data MeasurementType = Rain | Humidity | Pressure | Temperature | WindStrength | WindAngle | GustStrength | GustAngle\n data Measurement = MeasuredRain (Meter :/ Hour) | MeasuredHumidity (Double) | MeasuredPressure (Pascal) | MeasuredTemperature (Kelvin) | MeasuredWindStrength (Meter :/ Hour) | MeasuredWindAngle (Degree) | MeasuredGustStrength (Meter :/ Hour) | MeasuredGustAngle (Degree) \n data TimeSeries = TimeSeries { measuredProperty:: MeasurementType, values:: Map UTCTime Measurement }\n data Sensor a = Sensor { identifier :: a, supportedMeasurements :: [Core.MeasurementType] }\n -- each sensor supports different measurement types, ideally it should also be type checked type GetMeasurements a = Sensor a -> TimeRange -> NonEmpty MeasurementType -> IO [TimeSeries] ```\n What I would like to achieve is to ensure TimeSeries measuredProperty match Measurement type. That is, it shouldn't compile when one tries to create time serie of type Rain while putting e.g. MeasuredWindAngle inside.\n The measuredProperty is needed to group time series and e.g. compute an average from each serie type. That is, separate average for Humidity, Rain etc..\n Basically, each weather sensor will return many different measurements, where the measurements can be duplicated among different sensors. Therefore, I'd like to combine all measurements into a single list, group by type and then aggregate.\n Moreover, each sensor has a different set of supported measurements. Ideally, this should be reflected in the type system as well. That is, one shouldn't be able to ask for Pressure where the given sensor only supports [Temperature, Humidity].\n Anyone can give me any clues on how to achieve this?\n    submitted by    /u/onliner10  \n [link]   [comments]",

Kudos for defining new Bool/Int/Float types, it's refreshing to remember Prelude is a module like any other one;\n Probably saves a few thousand characters per library, plus makes Haddock easier on the eyes;\n  \nReasons to keep prefixes:\n  \nOpenGLRaw did it first and it still holds the gl prefix, same with gl;\n No need to explicitly qualify imports;\n Names stay at 1:1 to the API reference, if one exists;\n  \nThere obviously is no one true answer to this question, I'm merely looking for the public opinion on this.

Even the names of program resource files are hashed before installing resource files.\n Raku didn't have to hash, but it did because some file systems don't support unicode file names.\n The end result is that it's possible for a raku module repository to host a library written by different authors and for raku programs to import different versions of the same library written by different authors. I think this is almost the most advanced module system.\n I think haskell can do the same by differentiating name, version, and author of a library or a program when installing them onto a system. Then, haskell can install and import multiple versions of a library written by different authors.

          "description": "Not going to start flooding the sub with chatbot posts, but ChatGPT managed to output a functional program (discounting some empty lists) for grouping and sorting text:\n  \n write a haskell program to process text into groups and sort based on the first letter of the line\n  \nHere is a simple Haskell program that processes text into groups and sorts each group based on the first letter of each line:\n import Data.Char import Data.List -- This function takes a string of text and returns a list of groups, where -- each group is a list of lines that start with the same letter. The groups -- are sorted alphabetically based on the first letter of each line. processText :: String -> [[String]] processText text = -- First, we split the text into a list of lines let lines = lines text -- Next, we group the lines by their first letter grouped = groupBy (\\x y -> (toLower . head) x == (toLower . head) y) lines -- Finally, we sort the groups alphabetically by their first letter sorted = sortBy (\\x y -> (toLower . head . head) x < (toLower . head . head) y) grouped in sorted -- This is an example of how to use the processText function main :: IO () main = do let text = \"hello\\nworld\\napple\\nbanana\\ncat\\ndog\" let groups = processText text putStrLn $ show groups \n The output of this program when run on the example text given in the main function would be:\n [[\"apple\"], [\"banana\"], [\"cat\"], [\"dog\"], [\"hello\", \"world\"]] \n  \nNeeded some minor cleanup to compile: sortBy takes an a -> a -> Ordering, not a a -> a -> Bool, and the lines variable name needed changing to not match the function. Once complete, it compiles and functions more or less as expected. I could spot the head would likely give trouble on empty lists (which it did) and that groupBy could produce some strange groupings, but wild to see the skeleton of a decent sort function produced so easily. Like AI art, this could be pretty useful for brainstorming, if the results aren't outright useful themselves.\n    submitted by    /u/binarySheep  \n [link]   [comments]",

The compiler cannot know whether you intended this -- while it increases time complexity it may reduce space complexity. Thus it will not float the definition out from under the binding of x.\n In contrast, in the first function, fib' can be moved to the top level by the compiler. The where clause hid this structure and made the application to x look like a plain eta expansion, which it is not. \n  \nI cannot really understand how the compiler optimized the first definition of the function and not the second, apparently the redefinition of the function has an impact on time complexity.\n I know that a big part of FP optimization comes to know how to dance with the compiler, it's patterns and to lay stuff out for it to make \"better\". But unlike tail recursion, this trick doesn't seem as clear to me.\n I'd be most grateful for a clarification on how this works for a beginner haskeller, thanks :-).\n    submitted by    /u/Deleted_1-year-ago  \n [link]   [comments]",

I don't think the specific problem is important in this case, but I have run into some counter-intuitive behavior. \n My code reads inputs from a file, then does some simple computation (parse String -> Tuple, then \"score\" that tuple which is just Tuple -> Integer). Then I want to sum the scores. I first did this with a sum and a map, but then realized I could do it in a single fold. Code like this:\n main :: IO () main = do contents <- readFile \"input02t\" let input = lines contents -- This takes ~2 seconds to run print $ sum $ map (score . readEntry) input -- Same answer, but this takes ~10 seconds to run print $ foldr ((+) . score . readEntry) 0 input \n The time difference shocked me, because I expected equivalence.

          "description": "I'm putting the finishing touches on my second \"real\" Haskell project*, and now that I find myself (mostly) able to get some (simple, practical) stuff done with the language, I'd like to spend some time learning more about how to put types to work.\n I mostly-get some of the basic big ideas: make invalid states un-representable, e.g. Use a type that encodes your constraints in some way (like NonEmpty!). I found lots of good advice in this blog post, and several others by the same author. (I tried to put it to work in my own code, restricting the domain of a finicky function, which felt like a nice, if small, win.)\n Anyway, I feel like I'm still only scratching the surface. Reading posts like this or the \"types\" section in the \"State of the Haskell ecosystem\" gets me really excited, but doesn't leave me with much in the way of practical advice.\n Are there are good/recommended resources for digging deeper into this kind of stuff? I stumbled across Thinking with Types today, which seems like it could be a good fit. I also see there's a chapter on \"Basic Type Level Programming\" in Production Haskell. I've also found various blogs and reddit posts, of course, but nothing super-comprehensive. (And \"Type-driven development\" sounds cool, but I'm not ready to branch into Idris yet.)\n I'd love any recommendations, pointers, tips-and-tricks... whatever you've got to offer! Thanks!\n ​\n \\Any feedback is welcome, by the way, if anybody feels like digging through beginner code. It feels weird to work/learn in a vacuum. Looking at it now I already see some deficiencies, but I'm sure there are plenty that I don't see...*\n    submitted by    /u/spaceispotent  \n [link]   [comments]",

One issue I have run into is in comparing the types of arguments in polymorphic functions. \n I would like to be able to take a function of type, say, `Identity a -> b` and compare the first argument for equality with a known type `Identity a`. I would like to use the `eqType` function in GHC.Core.Type, but I don't know how to correctly separate the function type to do so.\n There are helper functions like `splitFunTy_maybe`, but that cannot be directly applied to my function type since it is wrapped in a `Forall` type constructor. My (very hacky) solution right now involves stripping the `Forall` constructor, splitting the bare function, then comparing the two types on their type constructors (in this case, `Identity`).\n I'm wondering if there's a better way to go about this, because I'm having trouble extending my current solution to broader applications.

In fact, I'm going to try the Advent of Code in it, as a forcing function.\n I'm trying to get a better handle on performance. For example, I really don't understand why the foldl' implementation in Data.List,\n  foldl' :: (b -> a -> b) -> b -> t a -> b {-# INLINE foldl' #-} foldl' f z0 = \\ xs -> foldr (\\ (x::a) (k::b->b) -> oneShot (\\ (z::b) -> z `seq` k (f z x))) (id::b->b) xs z0 \n works so much better in GHCi than my naive implementation,\n  foldl' f !z [] = z foldl' f !z (x:xs) = foldl' f (f z x) xs \n Sure, that one is better than just using foldl or foldr, but it still takes about 2 s in GHCi or runghc to sum 1 to 10M. Compiled, it takes 0.2 s (reasonable), but plain-vanilla Python or Scheme (guile) only take about 0.5 s.\n The Data.List implementation takes about 0.5 s, much more in line with what I expect a reasonable interpreter to do, but I don't understand how it does it.\n Can someone walk me through it? I'd like to figure out how to make things run quickly in GHCi for while I'm going through Advent of Code problems. More generally, how should I think about performance?\n (And yes, I've read the comment in the code, but I didn't understand it.)\n Edit: In particular, if someone could help walk me through the comment in https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.17.0.0/docs/src/GHC.List.html#foldl%27, I'd appreciate it.\n    submitted by    /u/oddthink  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have a MultiTree data structure, which looks like this:\n ```haskell\n data Node a = Node a a deriving stock (Functor, Show, Foldable, Traversable, Generic) type MultiTree b = FreeT Node [] (b)\n -- from the free package: -- newtype FreeT f m a = FreeT { runFreeT :: m (FreeF f a (FreeT f m a)) } -- data FreeF f a b = Pure a | Free (f b) ```\n Basically a multitree is a list of trees of lists of trees of... As an example:\n ```haskell\n trees :: MultiTree Text trees = FreeT [ Free (Node (FreeT [ Pure \"John\", Pure \"Mary\", Pure \"Andy\"]) (FreeT [ Pure \"runs\", Free (Node (FreeT [Pure \"eats\"]) (FreeT [Pure \"lettuce\", Pure \"garlic\"])) ]) ) ] ```\n Now what I'd like to do is to use the lens library to do a breadth first traversal trees ^.. cleverTraversal which gives [\"John eats lettuce\", \"Mary eats lettuce\", \"John eats garlic\", \"Mary eats garlic\", \"Andy eats lettuce\", \"Andy eats garlic\"].\n The reason I got inspired to do this with lenses is that I came across the plate and levels functions in lens, and those seemed like the right tools to, respectively, traverse recursively, and breadth first traverse. And FreeT has a Plated instance, so I was hoping it would all work magically.

It's fairly basic at the moment but I've already migrated a couple of projects to it, and it really is nice to have. Positive points:\n  \nYou have one source of truth regarding the supported compiler versions for your projects: your cabal file. \n No codegen is involved! You do not have to occasionally re-generate your CI file, which means that you can keep all the peculiarities and weird hacks you used to have. This tool only concerns itself with providing a list of OS and GHC versions. Some of which you can still exclude in the action file.\n  \nCoincidentally (or not), the next release of Flora will bring this stanza to the forefront (see associated announcement).\n Since the idea is to really be intertwined with the Haskell Github Action, the list of supported compiler is shared between this tool, the setup action and Flora.\n My thanks to David Christiansen for the idea of the CLI tool. The idea for it is to both disappear inside the future cabal status command, and that it becomes part of the official Haskell actions.\n    submitted by    /u/TechnoEmpress  \n [link]   [comments]",

After searching and reading some articles, I'm not sure what's recommendation to achieve this?\n Background:\n I have a project where it heavily depends on Future for operations. I have no problem with that. However, when writing the code, I want to be able to, for instance, test my logic instead of testing against Future. Also I know there exist libraries like ZIO, cats-effects, Monix, and Fs2. I may use it in the future. Before that happens, I don't want to choose one or the others too early. Then I found some articles talking about tagless final; but there are also some caveats regarding to applying tagless final such as complexity.\n ​\n Any advice that I can apply for decoupling my code's business logic from Future in a simpler way? Would simply provide a thunk (method or function) do the trick? For example, `Future { myFunc() }` - but with this it looks like the next step or function that handles this still couples with Future object. I appreciate any advice.

Multistage validation\n I would like to break down the validation into several stages. Errors from each stage should be accumulated into the \"final list of errors\", and a validation stage should only run on data that was successfully validated by the previous stage. In other words: each stage should return a list of validation errors along with the data that passed the validations of that stage. In addition most stages require IO to pull some data needed for the actual validation. An example using 2 stages:\n case class ValidationStatus[E]( errors: List[E], leftForValidation: List[Unvalidated] ) sealed trait Errors1 def validationStage1(values: NonEmptyList[Unvalidated]): IO[ValidationStatus…",

Because while in theory the concept sounds awesome, I don't get the way it was implemented. And I was already close to filing a bug report for this issue that then turned out to be \"intended behavior\".\n  \nThe other day I ran into the situation that I had two type aliases that both mapped to Lists of something. Then I wanted to implement an extension method on both of these types with the same signature.  type A = List[Int] type B = List[String] extension (a: A) { def doSomething: Unit = ??? } extension (b: B) { def doSomething: Unit = ??? }  But the compiler refused to do that because of the methods being identical after type erasure. Okay, I get that.\n But before I proceed with the core story here,…",

          "description": "If you're wondering why, well, just to reduce my dependency cone and possibly build times. No deeper reasons.\n Replaced sbt-assembly with sbt-native-packager's dist command to build a zip file. Unzipped that. Then added the resulting directory into my Docker image. The image now has everything needed to run the app, no fat JAR required.\n Replacing sbt-buildinfo was slightly trickier. I decided to roll the replacement by hand and 'sacrifice' a couple of things that sbt-buildinfo provides. Let's cover all of them:\n  \nname: I can just hard-code the project name, it's not like it's going to change all the time\n version: just need to plug in the output of git describe here\n scalaVersion: do I really need this info in my health page? Not really. I can just look up the version, pull up my repo, and figure out the Scala version there\n sbtVersion: same argument, I don't really need this in my app's health page\n buildTime: just need to plug in the output of date -u -Iseconds here (e.g. 2022-11-25T03:11:49+00:00)\n startTime: bonus, sbt-buildinfo doesn't provide this but it's trivial to add, just run val startTime = java.time.Instant.now.toString eagerly when the app starts up.\n  \nOK, so above in a couple of places I mention plugging in the output of shell commands, how to do that? Pretty simple. In the project code we just have a file like this committed in the repo:\n // Info.scala package build object Info { val name = \"my-app-name\" val version = \"TBD\" val buildTime = \"TBD\" val startTime = java.time.Instant.now.toString } \n And at build time we just replace this file with a generated one:\n # build.sh printf ' package build object Info { val name = \"my-app-name\" val version = \"%s\" val buildTime = \"%s\" val startTime = java.time.Instant.now.toString } ' \"$(git describe)\" \"$(date -u -Iseconds)\" sbt test dist unzip target/.../my-app-name.zip \n Yes, that's printf in Unix shell.

It has nothing to do with Elon Musk's takeover, actually, as I've been feeling like this for some time, drastically limiting its use. For me, Twitter is like that family dinner where the conversation is monopolized by your uncle's political views, and you're compelled to listen, just because he has a strong voice, he's family and can't tell him to shut up.\n You can choose to stay on Twitter, who knows, I might return in the future, too 🤷‍♂️ but right now it's no longer a healthy environment for a programming community. It's due to all the noise, as outrage generates attention, and outrage is encouraged by Twitter's features. Even when speaking of programming, I don't want inflammatory tweets in my feed, from some ignorant fool, advising Elon to rewrite the whole thing in Go, alongside all the reactions to it. And I'm sure that many Twitter users can agree that engagement has gone off a cliff lately for anything that's not related to politics.\n Some of us are trying out Mastodon. As a full disclosure, out of my Twitter followers, I could find about 4% of them on Mastodon, so around 200 people, some of them inactive. But for me that's enough, plus I found interesting people from other adjacent communities.\n Mastodon may prove to be counterproductive, too, as it's another social network, and maybe there's something wrong with social networks in general. But I like that it has that original web 1.0 vibe to it, and that it is “federated”, like email. Maybe you'd like to try it out, too.\n  \nI added some notes on how to migrate from Twitter, maybe you'll find it useful:\n alexn.org/wiki/mastodon/\n This is not a call to arms 🙂 it's just a suggestion, as I'd love to see more of you there.\n Cheers 🤗\n    submitted by    /u/alexelcu  \n [link]   [comments]",

I've already considered sticking it in something like cloud run or a plain old VM using free tier, but I'm hoping there might be some lower maintenance and more magical - ideally a java flavoured Vercel or thereabouts? 😉 \n The app currently hosts a Graphql api and also performs polling of an event stream (event sourcing), so I don't think a 'cold start' option would be viable unless I rework the polling and perform the work in-line trigger based 🤔 \n Thanks in advance!\n    submitted by    /u/absolutejam  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello dear Scala community !\n I have a very dumb ( or not, I am not sure ) question.\n Recently at work we kinda started a debate on how to handle errors in our applications : we use tapir + http4s and cats-effect's IO everywhere and current urrent practice is to throw everything in the IO's error channel and eventually catch it somewhere upstream. \n But by switching to mainly using http4s clients to sttp clients to communi6between our services we often find our business logic kinda sandwiched between a source of data producing IO[Either[E,A]] and an API description which expects the same.\n Lifting everything into the IO error channel to caste it again into the same input shape seems to be a waste of information and effort, while also not getting any help from the compiler to handle those errors. This kinda leads me to lean toward using EitherTs....which is metwith some resistance as it does tend to add some complexity to the code.\n In this context I found out about this wonderful article https://guillaumebogard.dev/posts/functional-error-handling/ which seemed to reflect exactly my own...erm...reflexions. After reading it, I thought I found the perfect middle ground ! Put errors not in the output type of your functions, but give it the capability to fail thru MonadError from cats and Raise from cats-mtl. Maybe lift everything into a neat context function type an bam everyone is happy.\n I started experimenting. Everything was very neat and tidy until....and here comes my dumb question....where do I get MonadError and Raise instances for IO ? Is there another lib ?\n I found tofu which seems to cover pretty much anything I need but they don't publish for scala 3. Do I have to rewrite both for the IO monad ?\n    submitted by    /u/WiIzaaa  \n [link]   [comments]",

However, when I'm using a variable-pitch font such as Times New Roman, the 80 characters per line allow up to 100 characters per line to fit. This is due to the nature of variable-pitch fonts where characters are not equal in width like monospaced fonts.\n 100 characters per line is too long for optimal reading and increasing the font size doesn't help. The font is already at a large size. \n What would be the solution? To reduce the olivetti 80 characters per line setting to 70 characters per line which will compensate for the variable pitch font?

          "description": "I've recently started using an M1 Mac for work, having previously used linux, and am finding the performance of magit to be extremely slow.\n I'm wondering if it's some oddity of my setup in particular, although my colleague notices the same issues. \n We are both using emacs-mac, his installed from homebrew via the railwaycat formula, mine built from the emacs-28.1-mac-9.1 tag using nix. I understand that this has a perf fix after a MacOS change to `vfork` last year.\n Some examples of the kind of performance issues we're seeing: it takes a few seconds to open the git status buffer (even on very small projects with little git history - longer on larger projects), and going through a diff to stage selected hunks seems to take a second or two for each one, which seems very high and is frustrating when you have a lot of changes to look through when trying to create a logical commit. On linux all these operations felt more or less instantaneous.\n I've seen suggestions for improving performance by disabling parts of the status screen etc., but I'd rather avoid doing this if possible, and not sure if this would help with peformance when staging something. The fundamental issue seems to be around slowness when emacs creates processes, rather than anything specific to magit, I just notice it with magit in particular as it creates a lot of git processes.\n I just wondered if this was considered 'normal' on MacOS and everyone just puts up with it, in which case I'll have to learn to live with it too. But I'm a bit baffled by the fact that there just seems to be very little discussion online about the problem.\n If anyone has any insight, even if it's just to share that they see the same behaviour so I no longer feel like I'm going insane, it would be much appreciated :-)\n    submitted by    /u/actionshrimp  \n [link]   [comments]",

Flycheck shows many errors such as:\n  \nThe method <methodname> is undefined for the the type <type> log cannot be resolved\n  \nWhen I open my projects in VS Code, these errors do not show up. For further context, this is a Spring Boot project that uses Maven. I'm also able to build this project from the shell with no issues. Trying to build through lsp-java fails because of the errors it is seeing.\n I've tried the following in trying to resolve this:\n  \nTried using OpenJDK 11, 15 and 17\n I made sure that the JAVA_HOME path and the /usr/bin/java symlink are pointing to the same version of the JDK (I tried this with the three version of the JDK I have installed on my system)\n Made sure I deleted the ~/.emacs.d/workspace directory when changing the JDK configuration to ensure I'm working off a fresh configuration\n  \nI'm not sure what else to try. I'm hoping to get some guidance on what else I can try. I'm confused why I'm not seeing these errors in VS Code which as far as I know, they use the same backend - I'm using the Red Hat extension which also uses Eclipse JDT.\n Has anyone else come across something like this before?

          "description": "Hey all\n I'm toying with using project.el in place of projectile, since I barely use any of projectile's features other than switching between known projects.\n One thing I'm struggling with is the workflow element. Along with projectile I have perspective and persp-projectile, and I have bound p in the projectile-command-map to projectile-persp-switch-project which gives a great experience when flipping back and forth between related code repositories, something I have to do often.\n Unfortunately I can't seem to replicate this great experience. I briefly tried using persp-mode with persp-mode-project-bridge but there doesn't seem to be an analogue for projectile-persp-switch-project.\n What this means is that using Projectile I can have a 2-window split in one \"project\" and 6 in the other, and flipping between them is nice and smooth. Whereas in Project each time I switch the flow is broken, since the default action is to present a menu and maybe open a single file.\n I'd love to hear from people who maybe use Project+<something> and have a similar workflow/experience to what I'm aiming for.\n If it helps, my config is based on vertico+consult+embark.\n As always, thanks in advance for your suggestions/support!\n    submitted by    /u/hairlesscaveman  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hey everyone! I posted yesterday about some difficulties I have had with virtual environments and Emacs, trying to finally set up Emacs as a Python IDE. I have elpy set up, and have managed to get that working. The only issue left is I have no idea how to wrap my head around pyvenv, which came included. Trying pyvenv-workon prompts me to set WORKON_HOME, which I'm unsure about since I run Windows 10, and when I try to activate venvs I've already made and have stored on my computer it doesn't seem to work. Any advice on how I can use pyvenv effectively and program with Python well in Emacs, or any good documentation sources on what exactly is going on? I've tried reading the manuals, couldn't really make heads or tails of the virtual environments content.\n    submitted by    /u/JCWalrus  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi guys! I want to use different input methods for different evil modes in emacs. To be more specific, I use colemak for English input (and basically everything else inside emacs), but qwerty for Chinese input. \n As I've been exploring, I found several possible ways of implementing this: letting fcitx handle the input methods and interface with it using `fcitx.el`, or let emacs handle everything and use `pyim` for Chinese input. \n I feel like both methods are bad. For fcitx, I'm not sure if the package could change fcitx state as buffers, major/minor modes change. Even it is possible, I suspect that it will be a huge hacking work (I'm a noob with elisp). For the native input methods, I'm not sure how to make the system input methods ignore emacs. Also, letting emacs handle its own inputs seems... inelegant.\n Do you have any good solutions for inputting Chinese in emacs, with colemak as the default English input? Any help would be appreciated!\n    submitted by    /u/Ok-Look6156  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Recently I've been developing a package for my own use to give suggestions while typing. While there are packages that do this, I couldn't find any that were aimed at my use case exactly.\n That is, to suggest something useful while typing based on the current context.\n At the moment I have this setup so there are multiple back-ends which can be enabled at once based on the current context, this way I can have different suggestions based on what I'm working on so:\n  \nWhen typing in code, suggest using code completion or dabbrev.\n When typing in comments, suggest using statistical word prediction, falling back to dabbrev.\n  \nI've been interested in how good word prediction can be, at the moment I'm using N-gram's generated by code-comments of the project I'm working on as input as well as every commit message, the user-manual and some NLTK texts as well. So far it's quite nice but doesn't feel like a game-changer and might need some tweaking to improve it's behavior.\n While I'm aware other auto-completion frameworks might support this functionality, I find it useful to separate blocking completion from this kind of suggestion generation.\n Is anyone doing something similar in Emacs already, any comments?\n  \nThis is the repository if anyone is interested although this isn't yet documented and internals may change.\n    submitted by    /u/ideasman_42  \n [link]   [comments]",

I go back to my pretty vanilla zsh shell and feel that it's a little… lacking.\n I understand zsh's completion system is quite configurable. I'd love it if I could make completion inside of zsh feel more like how it behaves in Emacs. In particular:\n  \nWhen I hit tab to complete something, I want to be able to hit the down key to start cycling through the candidates.\n When I find the candidate I want, tab should fill it in instead of moving to the next candidate.\n If I'm completing a path, after hitting tab whilst completing a directory, I should immediately see the contents of that directory, which I can then pick the file I want and hit tab again.\n Fuzzy completion ala Orderless would be awesome: hitting space during completion acts as a pattern separator.\n  \nDoes anyone have enough zsh-fu to know how to get something like what I described in the shell? I would prefer to do everything with configuration (i.e. no packages) but that's secondary to getting the behavior that I want.\n Thanks in advance. :)\n    submitted by    /u/varsderk  \n [link]   [comments]",

I used vanilla Emacs without many issues for a while, but decided to use Prelude yesterday.\n Oh, it's so nice, but at the same time... I know I can disable guru-mode, plus customize the few things that irk me... but maybe there's a better starter kit?\n My objectives are:\n  \nNo modal editing: I know vim basics, but I don't want a modal editor.\n I work most frequently with Python, Java, and Rust. Prolog, Puppet, Ansible I also do frequently. Wide language support would be nice. I'm a believer of LSP, so I'd like to use LSP.\n I write a lot of AsciiDoc for work. Being able to integrate aspell and Vale would be a big plus (recommended plugin for Vale is https://github.com/tpeacock19/flymake-vale , which is not in MELPA- maybe a straight.el-using starter kit would be helpful? Or perhaps I should just submodule/subtree/subrepo it?)\n Reasonably similar to vanilla Emacs- I don't want to be too lost without my configuration.\n Multi-account email client? I already mbsync two personal accounts (GMail and Yahoo) for backup purposes, might consider handling work email in Emacs too.\n I work significantly on RHEL 8 systems, which ship Emacs 26.1, and also on a RHEL 9 box (27.1).\n  \nThoughts, suggestions?\n    submitted by    /u/koalillo  \n [link]   [comments]",

What is the workaround for this?\n \nThe intellisense messages on the right side of the screen are often truncated due to a lack of space on my screen. How can I view the entire message when this is the case? Surely there's a better way than just flycheck-list-errors since I have to actually visually search where in the list the error/warning corresponding to my current line is. Add further to this fact the ID columns on that interface is often truncated\n \n https://preview.redd.it/vg876qu8055a1.png?width=943&format=png&auto=webp&s=38676201480eb5e8cad654d87ee999683e9bbc10\n (And tangentially related: why does flycheck-list-errors provide a different error list than consult-lsp-diagnostics? I have an example of this which I can produce upon demand.)\n ​\n  \nWhen LSP shows some information about what I'm typing in the minibuffer, how can I choose to view that information in full? See the image below. You can even see the \"1/3\" page label. How do I access those pages? If I press ESC so I can press K, pressing ESC gets rid of the message in the minibuffer and then attempting to press K will simply yield LSP :: No content at point.\n  \n​\n https://preview.redd.it/q1e8so0c055a1.png?width=629&format=png&auto=webp&s=6a0b2cc1d971ae4bba8c30af8f29834e897d17b6\n  \nnext-error / flycheck-next-error does not let you navigate to warnings (despite warnings appearing in the flycheck 'error' list).

Am I missing sth here? because like this I dont see any merit over the ordinary highlighting \n ​\n ​\n https://preview.redd.it/fclidwrjx25a1.png?width=417&format=png&auto=webp&s=8700e5574b90d77177700a6a14352d7e11f33ed6\n    submitted by    /u/RepublicWorried  \n [link]   [comments]",

Therefore I've read multiple times that switching to WSL makes emacs much more performant. Also using a VM with Unix might help.\n I've tried that and basically have seen 0 improvement, especially with LSP and maggit. I've built emacs from source to be sure that native comp, etc, is enabled.\n Using only the Linux file system (not using /c/...) made emacs a little better but still far from my Linux experience with it :( my config works really well on Linux, so I don't think it is problematic?\n I am using emacs for very different purposes such as: unity c#, c++ dev (sometimes with VS), .Net, org mode, org roam, trump edit, etc... Which makes it hard to live only in the wsl Linux file system as far as I've been able to test (a pain with unity, a pain with VS, a pain with / and \\, a pain with crlf and lf, etc...)\n Does anyone have a good way to have a performant emacs on windows please? Does the native window switch on v29 improves anything?\n Emacs is such a good piece of software, it makes me really sad that after battling for months to try to solve the problem, I find myself on the verge to switch editor again because I cannot ditch windows...\n    submitted by    /u/Aeiorg  \n [link]   [comments]",

The catch: These times are not consistent from day to day, as they are related to the length of the day and the time of sunrise and sunset. As such, a simple daily timer doesn't work. Various online services give times for Zmanim, such as this one (New York for an arbitrary example). \n I'm interested in setting up Emacs to give Zmanim times.

          "description": "As a newcomer here I just wanted to share my point of view for the community and any maintainers. Emacs has already expanded my mind and I'm beginning to grok the power of having a Lisp system at my fingertips. Now I can get through the more research-intensive install (on macOS at least) to find the best build and install flags. And I can get through learning and customizing any historical quirks of software going on 50 years strong..\n But one big obstacle to me, which isn't customizable, is that the cursor is always in view. Even in the GUI there is this trait which makes it feel like a terminal application (which it did start as). It fundamentally changes how one selects and navigates text (select text, scroll back up and select region disappears). In a world where every other GUI app doesn't behave this way, it is a big change. It feels like a constraint. This will force me deeper into keyboard centric navigation which is fine. I just think cursor flexibility should not be overlooked and for younger people who are switching from other editors and have used the mouse their whole lives, I can see it hurting adoption.\n This is probably very hard to implement, going against how it has always worked, but I think that would be good to at least have an option to let cursor scroll off screen. Let me know what you think. Kinda related: does anyone know of a package that makes the select region wrap around words instead of going edge to edge on screen?\n    submitted by    /u/amasunbey  \n [link]   [comments]",

I would think such an interop system would allow one to interact with Emacs' buffer functionality in particular. \n I'm not really sure that such a thing is very practical or would interest many people. But I recently wrote a Python interop library that allows me to use Python libraries from within Common Lisp, and I found it really helped my own understanding of Lisp quite a bit. \n I'm just wondering if anything like that has been done.

          "description": "So Atom has shut down. I could probably still use it, but for permanence I decided to switch to Emacs since I'm extremely picky with my editors. \n To be honest, the first time I tried it I was disappointed how hard it was do something simple as save a file, copy/paste and whatnot. However, the \"steep learning curve\" everyone talks about is just a matter of having a nanosecond of patience. Then speed comes later. What I love about the keybindings is it confines all of my work to the keyboard and the bindings are ergonomic if you also use the right Ctrl and shift keys. My workflow is honestly magnitudes better, being able to jump at lightning speed, completely neglecting arrow keys and the mouse. Also, for the first time ever, I am using all ten fingers to type. \n The question: I've set up a theme which I like, auto pairing brackets, indent and auto-complete. Curious if there's a way to get linting support? i.e. underlining missing semicolons, typos. \n Also, can I integrate a terminal into emacs as well? So far having the screen split with emacs and terminal (GNOME on Ubuntu) is working fine, but wondering if there's an even better way. \n Thanks.\n    submitted by    /u/DistilledProblems  \n [link]   [comments]",

Solargraph has this capability but I can't find where / if lsp-mode can use this method or not.\n    submitted by    /u/pedzsanReddit  \n [link]   [comments]",

There are a few known bugs (and many unknown I am sure). But things work in happy-path scenarios when you have correct identities defined and whatnot.\n I mostly copied over things from EPA package and adjusted for GPG->age differences (fortunately age is much simpler to work with). So when things are set up right you can get transparent age file decryption on file open and encryption on save. There's a few other accessory functions as well.\n Package needs some refactoring, more documentation, better error handling, support for different ways to specify recipients/identities, figuring out why editing over TRAMP saves unencrypted files and more.

As a vimmer interested in emacs due to the vast customization capabilities and especially org-mode, I looked into trying it out for myself. It seemed as though the easiest way to get an idea of the potential of emacs was to install doom. I used the official guides on the repo and tried out both emacs-mac and emacs-plus with native comp. On my M1 macbook pro I experienced major cursor lag (when navigating through text files using vim bindings), they were so severe especially after coming from vim that i ended up removing doom entirely. Vanilla emacs didnt feel a 100% smooth either. Whats even weirder is that weeks after uninstalling emacs itself my computer still had a process running called emacs with 99% cpu useage and high gpu useage. After doing some digging, it seems that there are rendering issues on retina displays specifically that really mess up the responsiveness of the app. I read about different things to try such as using fira code as the font, changing the line highlighting behavior etc.\n ​\n Anyways, Before trying to fix something that seemed broken I want to try to install another build again, and I'd also be comfortable with vanilla emacs and configuring it on my own if it means stable performance. So what I want to know specifically is the following:\n In your opinion what are reliable distros and build options out of the following distros for M1 on a retina display in terms of responsiveness and light cpu/gpu useage?\n - emacs-mac\n - emacs-plus\n - emacsformacosx\n and would you ppl suggest with native comp or without?\n    submitted by    /u/drax19  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Tweaking emacs with satisfication is not easy, but I am trying to think how it would work efficiently. The problem of the naive emacs keybindings is that it over relies on the ctrl key, default layout of modern computer keyboard makes it effort-some to do navigation. In my opinion, the alt (or meta) key should be paid more attention as we can balance between those two kinds.\n The first thing I found is that using arrow keys to navigate is fine, but not efficient, as its up and down arrow is not so coherent, and most of times we need rely on the thumb to hit the keys separately. While ctrl-n and ctrl-p can be an alternative to move around between lines, the same as alt-n and alt-p, for which I would suggest that using it as forward-paragraph and backward-paragraph. It can be smoother as oppose to the ctrl-<down> and ctrl-<up>, in the mean time, you can utilize the other combinations such as alt-f, alt-b to move forward word or backward. In that sense, alt key becomes a bold version of ctrl key, since it jumps fast and corresponds to every navigation key that ctrl has. We can therefore switch between those two modifier keys to move in a small pace or in a larger pace without intervening the arrow keys. At the same time, we can assign more combinations to the prefix key alt-s corresponding the ctrl-x. If we can stay mostly at the left region, the keystroke would be more efficient. If we can utilize those two kinds to the best, we can balance the left and right region, such as buffer navigation uses right hand-side alt-[ and alt-], and buffer switch uses alt-\\.\n I also want to listen to your suggestions, as I believe everyone has their own opinions and configurations to make a balance, not be overloaded, while be efficient.\n Edit: I have remapped caps to ctrl.\n    submitted by    /u/OutOfCharm  \n [link]   [comments]",

I question Vim's perceived efficiency with its keybindings and modal workflow but know it is universally available and quick to load.\n Testing Emacs for the first time opened my eyes and challenged what I thought I ever knew about it. The wealth of its built-in package manager with repos and extensibility is incredible. I thought it was all terminal focused but found out about the GUI and that a large majority of the community is using it. Now I am comfortable in the terminal but far from elite and have never tried a full terminal workflow. I'd like to hear from professional programmers and admins. What is your preferred choice?\n I want to know and grok the possibilities of using an editor inside a terminal, do you have more functionality, are you able to pipe things easier, etc. I know the benefits of the GUI in graphics and keybindings but is there feature loss or pain points when using something like vterm. Emacs is very flexible and there is many, many ways to complete work.\n In your opinion, should a person that wants to be the best programmer and admin possible focus on using GUI or Terminal Emacs?

I got a really nice development environment for RJSX and as a matter of fact, I would still be using that as my main editing suite for RJSX and using it professionally but I have to admit. I have spent around 3 months with Doom Emacs now and in that time I also started following along system crafters videos to build my own config but I have to say that unfortunately, I'm a person that switches often between a lot of different languages and platforms and tools. \n e.g. While I'm working as a freelancer in RJSX I also develop blender plugins and I'm also learning unreal engine 5 and WebGL on the side.\n For someone like me, I was finding that I'd have to spend 3-4 days dedicatedly crafting an environment for every new requirement I have. I do a lot of different minor development-related things and this was really killing my will to work. \n But, emacs did force me to learn evil mode for editing and I have to say I'd always use that till the day I die now. I cannot imagine how I didn't. I also added a magit plugin and an org mode plugin on vscode and also using the vspacecode plugin for spacemacs like keybindings now. \n My affair with emacs would definitely continue for a long time, I'm sure. But unfortunately, the barrier of entry is rather high for someone like me who wants to do a lot of things and honestly for the time being I'd have to hop back to VSCode to edit a lot of different things. I am a little disappointed but still hopeful that I'd be back some time.\n    submitted by    /u/_analysis230_  \n [link]   [comments]",

I don't get the usual autocompletion, the errors listed by flycheck all appear in the first in the first lines and don't get removed if i correct the acutal error, ....\n And this only happens in the very first file which started the server ! On top of that I've also noticed that it only happens when I have more than one listed lsp workspace folder using pyright.\n My current workaround is to kill the buffer and reopen the file again but it would beetter if I could get rid of it entirely.\n I use doom emacs with pyright and lsp and I also use pyenv for my virtualenvs with the pyenv package which allows emacs to automatically detect the local version I set for a project and use it. \n It's very weird and I have a hard time finding the root of the problem so if someone had a similar issue at some point or as any clue on what to do it would be very much appreciated !\n    submitted by    /u/TheHentaiSama  \n [link]   [comments]",

Then straight-thaw-versions applies whatever versions are in there to the package repos.\n  \nI think I also saw a :ref option in an answer here on reddit but I can't find the either the :ref and :tag option in the straight README. There is a :branch option though and that is the one I want to stick to, but it may not be safe if changes or some fixes which I may not want are backported to it.\n My idea then is to clone the repo I want, create a branch from the commit hash I want and point straight to it. If I don't make any changes to it than that \"branch\" will be good with straight forever, and I should be able to use the :fork option if I want to retain a reference to the original configuration.\n Is this cloning and creating an unchanging branch a good idea? I have read about the lockfiles but at this stage it is all a bit much for me. I want something I can wrap my head around for now and get to the advanced stuff later.\n For instance I want to stick to org 9.3.8 in one of my profiles.

But if I'm opening a file, I just want it to jump straight to the file and not waste time showing the dashboard.\n It seems that there is a pretty trivial solution in cases when Emacs is invoked from the command line: just check if there are command-line arguments that look like files, and make Emacs behave accordingly.\n However, I want Emacs to behave this way even when I invoke it from the GUI: when I double-click on a file, or select 'Open with Emacs'.\n I've done some snooping around the startup code, and it looks like in the latter case, the file that we're about to open does not show up as a command-line argument, so the above solution doesn't work. Yet there must be a way for Emacs to know that it needs to open a file (otherwise it'd just open normally and not immediately display the file in a buffer).

I'll want to see that error or output and then get back t my side by side arrangement and continue right where I am in the first. Currently, I switch to the other window with ace-window o (C-x o in my case) then mazimize that one with zoom-window-zoom (bound to z in my case). The nice thing with zoom-window-zoom is that it toggles... so z again unmazimizes the window. Then I C-x o again to get back to the first window. So, to fill my screen with the other window: C-x o, z, z, C-x o. Muscle memory at this point. But I want to be able to hit one key and maximize the other window, and hit it again to unmaximize the other window, and have my pointer where it was in the first window at the end. I'm not attached to ace-window or zoom-window-zoom... they were just what I happened across. I realize this may be more complicated if I have more than two windows open, but I very seldom do.

          "description": "The variable gc-cons-threshold is the threshold beyond which Emacs will run garbage collection. So if more memory is allocated than this (in bytes) the garbage collector runs. The default value is 800000 - just 7.6MiB! Starting Emacs and looking at gcs-done gives 67 for me (the garbage collector has run 67 times) and (emacs-init-time) gives \"5.464376 seconds\".\n At the start of my init.el, I've put:\n ;; Don't collect garbage while initialising. (setq gc-cons-threshold most-positive-fixnum) \n And at the end:\n (setq gc-cons-threshold (* 1024 1024 100)) ; 100 MiB \n You could also put (garbage-collect) at the end to collect garbage if that tickles your fancy.\n Now gcs-done is 12 (for some reason), and (emacs-init-time) is \"3.598263 seconds\", which is a decent improvement of nearly two seconds. I have a very heavy and badly-written configuration file, so I need all the help I can get 🙂.\n You could probably get away with higher values of gc-cons-threshold, but bear in mind that the larger the threshold, the rarer the garbage collection, but the longer it takes. So you might end up with tiny but noticeable pauses while you're typing, which would be annoying.

Lets create some more...\ntags: books/fiction/the grapes of wrath\n\ntags: books/science/outline of history/my-notes\n\ntags: books/travelogue/wind sand & stars\n\nNow, if you recall I'd noted earlier I was (yes 'was' the issue is fixed) wrestling with a regex/wildcard issue when bam! the idea came to me: paths for tags that can expand via wildcard & globbing. An example...\nbooks, books/, books/*    # all return tag-path books/\nbooks/fiction             # returns all tags within tag-path books/fiction\nbooks/*/wind sand & stars # returns the 'relative path' for wind sand & stars \n\nLots more wildcard patterns too...

          "description": "I use The Archive. Occasionally, I find notes that are no longer needed, and I move them from The Archive into a \"cold storage\" folder. This could potentially leave \"dangling links\" around. At other times, I want to link to a source file on my hard drive, but rather than using an inline file:/// link, which is prone to breaking, I just drop another zettel link inline (eg see the source file [[202212152155]] on my hard drive).\nNaturally, when running across these links, clicking on them in The Archive gives no results, and leads to nowhere. This requires me to then copy the zettel id out, and paste it into a file-system-wide search. Ideally, this would be a smoother process.\nI'm interested in any suggestions for making this process smoother.\nI notice there's a contextual menu in The Archive, when clicking on these links.

This is a note that I took yesterday (translated by DeepL):\n\n  \nGood music is made to give us strength. Old war music, a lot of video game music, some movie music.\nOther music is made for us to give it power. Pop music is made to be about itself. It's all about itself. It wants us to focus our attention on it.\nListen to good music!\nMusic is part of the cultural environment of us humans. It is the most primal form of cultural transmission of meaning. It is (without singing) meaning in its purest form: Harmony through form in form in form.\n\n\nI have no study to provide evidence for my thesis. However, my n=1 is very positive. I, personally, like to listen to traditional war music. Now, that I started my cold adaptation (cold shower + shiver walks aftwards (walking in cold with few clothes on)) I feel like nordic war music is appropriate.\nBut gaming music is my personal favorite. For people, that don't like to listen to music at all: Ambience sounds like campfire sounds, thunder and rain etc. are also power giving.\nI like this more than binaural sounds.

Well, compared to Niklas Luhmann it's still ligheting fast, but thats another story. ;-)\nSearching is something I do a lot while working with my Zettelkasten. As I said before, title search is the feature I miss the most in The Archive.\nOn the other hand, I asked myself: would a combined search of title and content not even be better?\nTo check that out, I made a little Python script that I just pusblished on GitHub (for the first time, by the way – quite exiting!). This is the link:\nhttps://github.com/ralfzosel/zk-smart-search\nThe installation chapter is quite short – probably too short, if you never used Python before.

Trust that something surprising or magical will happen.\n\n  \nI realized that in a few months, let alone years, at this rate most of my time would be spent on the maintenance of memories [notes]. I, as others have found, would be too busy maintaining these memories to use them. 1\n\n\nWhat does \"use\" mean? I can use a note's contents to reignite ideas in me. They can spark new, novel ideas and connections with established knowledge. Some balance between creation, review, and maintenance has to be made in zettelkasting. In that sense, zettelkasting is like dog training. Dog training is hard work, and it is often not fun to train, but the rewards of a well-trained dog show up throughout the day.\nReviewing zettel has been a focus of mine, and I highly recommend it. Looking at notes created yesterday, three weeks ago, six months ago, and last year is a great start. If we develop notes sporadically, we'll probably only have one or two notes to review. Slowly and steadily, we plow through our notes, and in time, we will have reviewed every note multiple times.\nI think Minto is confused about how much time it takes to review a couple of notes (if atomic, focus on a single idea) and how a short review over and over builds, reinforces knowledge, and shows not only new connections but whole new ideas.\nIs it true that the ideas captured in our notes are not worth reviewing? I suggest the next to capture, the review is the most essential piece in a ZK workflow.\nMinto, Robert. \"Rank and File.\" Real Life, 2021, https://reallifemag.com/rank-and-file/.&#160;↩︎",

Currently, my notes span across academia, professional work, personal stuff, grocery lists, conceptual ideas, project sketches/outlines, and even video game progress plans.\nThese notes are captured in Zotero attachments, paper bullet journals, google docs, iOS Notes App, liquidtext pdf editor, the reminders app...

My first zettel in the archive software was just me testing the archive syntax (which is new to me) and reflecting on how it feels with my style of note-taking.\nAnyways, looking forward to learning more about zettelkasten, knowledge practices, my own brain processes, and the challenge of sorting, retaining, releasing, and integrating knowledge in a way that is helpful to my own goals",

We know that is a poor definition of a Zettelkasten and Ryan is not a good example either. He takes copious notes, but there is no linking in his system.

Complex systems theory allows you to see links between disciplines, which also can make hard to focus on one thing at a time.\nI struggled through my endless master thesis process. It got me sick for real. Concentrating was sometimes impossible even for whole weeks. Gracefully I ended it well a few months ago and now I'm a researcher, in the meantime I prepare myself for doing my phd (hopefully 2024 in Berlin).\nWith renovated energies, I'm gradually managing to find a new flow for my work and personal life. A really important part is to develop a workflow, combining project management, journaling, synchronization/backing between home and work devices, code software integration.\nI use to take notes by hand in a notebook. I have several of them filled with research logs, scientific articles notes, theory notes, ideas, day/week journals. I tried (space)emacs and org-mode a couple of years ago, learned the basics to left it completely a month later.\nNow I decided to base my workflow on digital notes. I've sneak into doom emacs with org-roam, obsidian and vscode with dendron.\nI'm inclining in favor of having a note-taking workflow integrated with vscode instead of emacs, as I program in vscode.\nSince deciding on digital note-taking systems choice paradox led to paralysis analysis.

The only thing I'm still confused about is how I should deal with citing the sources of my information.\nFor example, let's say there's a passage like this:\n\n  \nIt’s important to understand the layers that make up a design, because getting those layers to work together is the key to creating designs that look good, that solve problems, and that ultimately influence your users.\n\n\nFor the Zettel, should I always start it with \"According to [so and so]...\", or should I just omit that and essentially present the idea as my own? And if I come across another source that slightly expands on this, how should I express that? And how should I deal with a source contradicting this information?",

In a blog post I'd remove the last subsection, but for my private cesspool I'm inclined to keep it \n202211261601 Endnotes require direct access via chapter marks\n  #endnote #usability\nTo make book endnotes as usable as footnotes, each page or page spread needs to show all relevant information the reader requires to find the appropriate endnote.\nPaperback endnotes are usually not optimized for \"direct access\" (aka \"random access\" as in computer RAM[[202211281004]]): Endnotes are often counted from 1 on a chapter-by-chapter basis. Then the endnotes of a book will be sectioned by chapter.\nUsability problem\nNon-fiction paperback books usually only print the author and book title at the top of pages, so you don't have an easy way to know which chapter you're in.\nExample usage of bad endnotes\nIf you're on page X and want to know what endnote Y is about, you need to page back until you find the beginning of the chapter, or look up the chapter's page range in the table of contents first. Then you can navigate to the approriate section in the endnotes.\nRandom access vs bad sequential access\n\"Random/direct access\" would be possible if one of the page headers contained the current chapter title to make finding the appropriate section in the endnotes easier. Then you'd have all the information, the complete address, to de-reference the number Y.\nIf you page through the book, and simultaneously advance the endnote sections and leave a bookmark there, you would get \"sequential access\" that relies on a process like this.",

Ok, I don't understand why you would use the popular timestamp thing. Sure, you know when the note was created, and you fixed the issue with duplicate titles (which, really, who experiences?) Other than that, what? Then you have this unclean 12-digit number in front of your note title; amazing.\nI've been trying to use Luhmann's 1,2,3b,3c etc., system, which works fine, but there is no convenient way to use it (I am using Obsidian). I used this 12-digit timestamp on hundreds of notes, and it's simply useless. I need something else!\nYes, I researched other solutions, but they were not convincing and too geeky, as I recall. I wonder if someone had the same experience as me. The 12-digit timestamp prefix is missing the point of the Zettelkasten, IMO. I'm looking for alternatives and am eager to listen to others' experiences with ID prefixes methods for Zettelkasten. Thanks!",

One of my purposes in starting a ZK was to capture brief memories or \"snapshots\" of my past, with a focus partly on what happened and partly on how I felt (at the time) or feel (now) about that event.  I don't pursue this in any organized way, either in relation to time or theme.  I simply deal with memories as they arise, prompted by a discussion with a friend or family member, or from looking at a photo.  The order is thus random. But I hoped that as I gathered a large number of brief memories and connected them together, they would form a somewhat coherent personal history that was also intimately tied to other zettels, such as those expressing personal values and beliefs.\nThis is now coming to fruition, although there is still…",

If you understand memory merely as the ability to parrot something that you have stored, memory is something completely different than if you are talking about availability. Do I have a good memory if I can name the back of an index card, but I can't access its contents when I'm supposed to be using it?\nMemorization takes into account a small part of this problem: It is a common recommendation that one practice \"Active Recall\" and not merely repeat the material (e.g., by reading through it several times).\nAfter \"Active Recall\", the key is to make content available when you actually need it, not just in the test situation. There is a difference between memory and the repertoire at one's disposal.\nBut it is difficult to operationalize the situation of actual use.\nThesis: You should start with simple memory techniques and then work your way up to more complex ones.\nTranslated with www.DeepL.com/Translator (free version) (slightly edited by myself)",
