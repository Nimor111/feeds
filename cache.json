The part of resolution order makes sense to me (with some configuration of OVERLAPS/OVERLAPPABLE).\n But I know why I can't write this - the a in the instance definitions match all types! And the instance resolution simply does not use the constraints to resolve the instances. My understanding of the reasoning for this design is that Haskell would become internally inconsistent, because in different contexts, prettyOrShow could have different behavior for the same types in different contexts. Great - I love that - super safe. But in this case I DONT CARE. I want to write this out of convenience - so I don't care about safety here - if the behavior is inconsistent I will still sleep deeply and peacefully . If we had dependent constraints or something similar, perhaps this would be easy - but as it stands - this is not...\n Is there a way to do what I want to do? Make it as grimy as you like.

Building it with dynamic linking does work though (by removing the ghc-options under the swoogle executable), but I'd like for it to be consistent between CI and the dev environment, for the most part. \n Discrepancies in CI and dev\n  \nDockerfile\n GitHub Actions file\n cabal.project.freeze\n swapi.cabal\n  \nThis has more to do with how cabal resolves the dependencies. So this is the result of the most recent job: (GitHub Actions, PasteBin).\n My question here is, despite freezing the dependencies (and committing it), why does cabal resolve them differently? Locally it all builds, and runs just fine. But in the CI it seems to be complaining about conflicting versions of base, for example. At one point it also complained about req, and some other libraries. I think I'm missing something obvious to make it consistent between both environments. I don't understand where it pulled that new base version from.\n I'll try to provide more information if ever what I've provided so far is insufficient.

They were able to build everything just fine after some minor adjustments, but I have had problem after problem... and I'm stumped, so I'm turning to you for help.\n The project I'm trying to build is open source (https://github.com/fossas/fossa-cli). When I got this new system set up, I ran the instructions on our HACKING.md page and immediately tried to build. This failed because I didn't have llvm installed, so I brew install llvm'd, symlinked into $PATH, and tried again. This failed due to:\n install_name_tool: error: unsupported load command (cmd=0x80000034) `install_name_tool' failed in phase `Install Name Tool'. (Exit code: 1) \n My teammate who has the M1 already and I compared notes, and he found that he had installed llvm@12. So I removed llvm and its $PATH symlink, installed llvm@12, installed its symlink, and now it compiles! Yay!\n ... But I can't link. I'm now failing on this:\n Building library for byteorder-1.0.4..

You could call main to run all the tests, or call hspec XyzSpec.spec to run just the tests you currently care about.\n Problem is that GHCi can only load one component at a time. That means I can't do :r to reload code changes that aren't in the test component. If I'm changing library code, then restarting the repl from Cabal all the time isn't convenient as it is slow.\n As a hacky solution, if I add the library's src dir to my test's hs-source-dirs then it works really nicely. Things reload very quickly. But once you start needing build dependencies in the library, you also need to add them to the test project. This starts to feel a bit messy, build tools for other languages don't require hacks like this.\n Is there a better way to do this? I know there's stack test --file-watch but this is very slow. I'm looking to to make tiny changes rapidly, and the time it makes you wait while it builds the project over and over is inconvenient when compared to the instant reloading in GHCi.\n    submitted by    /u/adamMatthews  \n [link]   [comments]",

While it's always a relief when I stumble across a combination that gives a massive speedup, it's often not clear to me why certain things make a big difference in some contexts but not in others (especially bang patterns and INLINE/INLINABLE pragmas). This makes me worry that I may just be overfitting my code to the quirks of the GHC version that I'm currently using (currently 8.10.7 on a 64-bit Ubuntu 20.04 machine), and that some of the fruits of my labour will be lost in future when I upgrade. So my questions are: \n  \nHas anyone measured and publicly reported the amount of work that it took them to maintain the speed of high-performance Haskell libraries across GHC versions?\n Is there any guidance anywhere on what kinds of performance optimisations are likely to remain beneficial across GHC versions?\n  \nIn case a concrete example would help, I've written a generic foldl' function for linear data structures (lists, pairs of lists, etc.). In a benchmark that I've written for a Wordle solver that I'm working on, I found that I can improve its performance by about 10% by unrolling one recursive call. I then tried unrolling two recursive calls, and the performance was about 8 times worse! So I tried adding INLINE, and the performance was about 16% faster than the original unrolled version. Here's the code for the different versions: GenericFoldl.hs. Is there any good reason for me to think that future GHC versions will continue to make similar decisions about what to inline, so that the performance of unroll2_genericFoldl' won't suddenly plummet after an upgrade?\n    submitted by    /u/Osemwaro  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "In Bird's book on algorithms in Haskell:\n  \n3.3 Arrays\n One of the main differences between functional and procedural algorithms is that the former rely on lists as the basic carrier of information while the latter rely on arrays. In functional algorithms input usually consists of a list of values, whereas in procedural algorithms input values are usually assumed to be presented as the elements of an array. For a procedural programmer array updates are destructive: once an array is updated by changing the value at a particular index, the old array is lost. In functional programming, data structures are persistent because any named structure may be referred to at some other point in the computation and therefore has to continue to exist. Consequently, any update operation, even at a single index, has to be implemented by making a new copy of the whole array. Because they cannot be changed but only copied, purely functional arrays are known as immutable arrays. It is possible to get round this problem and allow mutable structures by encapsulating the operations in a suitable monad, but we will not introduce monads in this book.\n Wholesale or monolithic updates, on the other hand, are ﬁne. Changing all or some of the entries at one go involves copying the array only once. Haskell provides a number of such wholesale operations in the library Data . Array. The purpose of this section is simply to describe the main functions in this library.\n  \nWhat does \"wholesale or monolithic update\" mean? Does it mean exactly \"any update operation, even at a single index, has to be implemented by making a new copy of the whole array\"?\n Is a data structure with \"wholesale or monolithic update\" a mutable or immutable one?\n Does library Data .

What are good projects to take on as a beginner Haskeller? I’m only up to the IO section in LYAH so do I need to learn about Monads or something before I can do anything useful?

This means effects are low-boilerplate, easy to understand, and that users of similar libraries can easily get along with cleff.\n It supports higher-order effects implementation, and provides a set of easy-to-use combinators for that. The expressiveness of these combinators are on par with polysemy's Tactics language, and also harder to use incorrectly.\n It uses a ReaderT IO monad as the underlying Eff monad implementation, instead of free monads. \n Therefore, the overhead of effects is reduced greatly (and gives pretty impressive microbenchmark results).\n IO-based effect implementations provides good interaction with exceptions and concurrency (no more losing changes to State due to exceptions).\n \n  \nThe library and documentation are already available on Hackage: https://hackage.haskell.org/package/cleff.\n    submitted by    /u/day_li_ly  \n [link]   [comments]",

You can define a function that takes Void, but you can never call it. To call it, you would have to provide a value of the type Void, and there just aren’t any. As for what this function can return, there are no restrictions whatsoever. It can return any type (although it never will, because it can’t be called).\n  \nThen it proceeds to explain that a singleton set is actually type ()\n This doesn't make sense to me - why isn't a function that is the equivalent of { return 32 } the same as a morphism mapping an empty set to a non-empty set? And why can't you call a function whose argument is the equivalent of an empty set? And finally, how is () the equivalent of a set with a single member?\n UPDATE: While typing this, I think it finally clicked - still looking for confirmation. An Empty set can only map to an Empty set because there are no elements to transform. Which is why () is some universal element because it implies that you can map a set with one thing to any one other thing. Is this right?\n    submitted by    /u/RoboZoomDax  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "So for the purposes of my final year project I'm writing a non-deterministic language by Haskell for the purposes of learning Haskell and to understand language design! Non-determinism in the language arises in the presence of control flow for example : n := 0 Do (n < 10)-> if P.x -> S [] Q.x -> R fi Od So if any of the guards (P.x,Q.x) are True then their statements S,R can be carried out. The caveat here however is that both of the guards could be evaluated to True which means both statements have to be executed. The branch taken that finishes first however is the branch which ultimately gives the final result so for example if the two guards where checking if n is an even number and if n was less than say five then both branches would have to be taken. ​ After just completing a class on Parallel Computing, my first thought was to use threads but then I came across numerous articles and blogs about how the List Monad can handle non-determinism. ​ So my two approaches where to either use threads which I do have some experience with or to see if the List Monad could actually work. I'm inclined to use threads given that each branch obtains its own instance of the program therefore it would make sense to use them but I am quite aware that Haskell‍ is more or less magic so I figured there's probably another way to achieve the effect I desire. ​ Could something along the lines Lisp's amb be of any use? I found the Haskell implementation https://wiki.haskell.org/Amb but it appears to generally be used for more trivial programs than anything else. ​ My apologies if this post isn't allowed, was just looking to rubberduck a bit\n    submitted by    /u/sharctic03  \n [link]   [comments]",

What I've noticed is that when a module doesn't get reloaded, it gets to keep the value of any top-level IORefs too (the value of anything really)! \n Here's an example of how I've been using this feature; Say I have a Server.DevServer module that imports most of the project and sets up an environment that enables serving most of t…",

          "description": "Hello fellow Haskellers,\n today I released new version of headroom, this release (release notes) brings support for managing license/copyright headers in Dart, Kotlin and PHP source code files. Also it fixes annoying issue in copyright year updater feature and finally makes headroom fully compilable with GHC 9 (9.0.2 or newer).\n In case you never heard of headroom - it's small command line utility that manages license/copyright headers in your source code files. All needed is to create Markdown templates for license/copyright, fill-in some variables and that's it. It can also do some nice stuff like above mentioned feature that updates years in copyrights for you. Also some languages have extended support, where for example in Java/Scala/Kotlin files you can use class package name as template variable, and in Haskell it can even extract and reuse variables from whole Haddock module header. This release also automatically checks for new versions once per week and notifies user to command line (using this GitHub REST API) - no data collection or telemetry bullshit is happening), but if you don't like it, it can be easily disabled in configuration.\n Headroom is already few years out, but I'm always happy to hear ideas about new features or improvements, feel free to open new issue or PR in such case.\n    submitted by    /u/xwinus  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Ok, I've been learning akka, and I'm trying to wrap my head around thread safety. Let's recap\n JAVA THREAD MEMORY MODEL\n All threads have their own little slice of memory exclusive to that thread. Periodically the JVM will sync the thread memory values to main memory, but it's not guaranteed when that will happen. This is why different threads can see different values of a variable.\n Volatile of course bypasses this by making a given variable always be read/written from/to main memory. Synchronized enforced the other piece of this, ensuring that only one thread at a time can interact with it to prevent race conditions.\n AKKA ACTOR THREAD MEMORY MODEL\n So I do not totally understand this, but here is what I do understand. AKKA has its own thread pool, and is purely message based. A given actor is executed on any available thread when a message is present for that actor.\n The first thing that trips me up is that Akka only executes a message on a given actor one at a time. Ie, a given actor will process messages synchronously. I could be wrong about this, please tell me if I am. This just seems like a bad model for concurrency vs a more traditional approach like the thread-per-request model of a traditional webapp like Spring.\n The second thing is that while this kind of message processing rule would prevent race conditions, it feels like memory consistency would still be an issue. If an actor can be operated on by multiple threads, even if those threads can't touch it concurrently, how do all the threads see the same state value? Wouldn't there be a risk of memory consistency issues? Are actors somehow made entirely volatile?\n CONCLUSION\n I clearly do not understand some key stuff here. Guidance would be appreciated.

It was my big introduction to functional programming and by the end of the project I understood functional programming just well enough to be interested in it. Since then I have studied it extensively in languages that are not purely functional, mainly TypeScript, and this has motivated me to pick up Scala again.\n I know that Scala 3 has just come out. Obviously I would like to work with the latest version. However my experience with other major software updates leaves me a bit wary. I have seen in other ecosystems major updates causing widespread compatibility issues with common libraries resulting in a highly complicated process of figuring out what will and will not work with the new version.\n On that note, I'm hoping for clarity on a few points:\n 1) does scala 2 code compile in a scala 3 project?\n 2) will third party libraries written for scala 2 still be compatible with Scala 3? I'm inclined to say yes because it all compiles to Java bytecode but I just want to be sure.\n 3) any other pitfalls that someone with limited scala experience who will be starting with Scala 3 should know?\n Thanks in advance.\n    submitted by    /u/Droid2Win  \n [link]   [comments]",

The part that I can remember ​ case class Node[T](v: T, left: Option[Node[T]]=None, right: Option[Node[T]]=Node) { def map[R](f: T => R): R = f(v) def flatten = ... // flatten def flatMap = ... // which combines map and flatten } But I can't remember the part about flatten (the problem I suppose is I don't know what I want to flatten for that ⠀Node object), and then flatMap.

Few more discussions followed:\n  \nPerfect Int Loop\n Perfect Time Library\n Boost data processing speed with heavy ops\n  Void Request Pattern\n  GUI Could Be Easy\n  Creating New Numerical Types\n  \nSo the feature set was pretty much complete long time ago and it took many months to refactor, refactor, and refactor. At this stage there are no good ideas on how the project can be improved any more, so it is time to stabilize the code base. From now on the future releases will be binary compatible with version 1.0 and any large changes will be rejected unless absolutely necessary.\n Maintenance wise, based on experience, I expect to spend from 1 to 4 hours a week to fix any incoming bugs and make a new release every 1-3 months. Otherwise, I will move on to invest/trade markets full time, using Scalqa as enabling technology.

I'm a Java developer and I'm using Intellij Idea Ultimate.\n Usually, I use asdf for managing different versions of java, elixir, etc... What is a recommended tool in the Scala world? I see that there is a CLI called coursier. Or should I continue working with asdf? I'm asking this because it seems to me that coursier gives us the option to install additional tools like scalafmt? \n Also, should I pick Intellij Idea for Scala 3? Any first-hand experience here - I saw a couple of posts over here, but they are a couple of months old, so I'm wondering if the situation is better now, or maybe to try with Neovim + native LSP + Metals?\n ​\n To be honest, I expected that tooling will be much more mature for Scala because it is almost mainstream language :)\n ​\n Thanks in advance for your suggestions.\n    submitted by    /u/milnik79  \n [link]   [comments]",

And most other books provide algorithms just an illustration for some neat language feature. The thing is, to get a job as Scala developer these days (in competitive firms) one needs to be a competitive programmer, master of Leetcode, and Scala doesn't seem to have strong ecosystem in that regard as Java, Python or C++. Edit: in DIY spirit and as a learning exercise i'm thinking of translating Sedgewick Algorithms from Java to idiomatic functional Scala, if anyone wants to join this effort or aware of similar ones please let me know Edit 2 (in regards to comments on 'reinventing the wheel' below): if Scala is so great as a language and functional programming flagship, where are all the libraries of functionally implemented algorithms replacing conventional CLRS style imperative/mutable implementations?\n    submitted by    /u/Icy_Egg9244  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Most developers choose the path of least resistance. Effect systems are not low resistance and its very hard for experienced functional programmers to explain why its so great. Even ZIO that makes it a little bit more straight forward is still a huge leap from where most programmers are. \n Compare this to say Rust. Rust requires more from the programmers but the rules around borrowing and lifetimes are relativly easy to understand it takes a while to learn fully. But the motivation is there because its performance and its measurable. Do you want your programms to be 2x+ fast then writ it in Rust.\n Effects systems are very abstract concepts. First that you are describing a program in a program. Then the notion that non purity is bad. Monads, functors etc. There is alot to understand because in the long run you need to understand them.\n I'm currently learning and I like it. Not that I'm fully aware of all benefits but I like learning. \n When I look at the majority of programmers that I have worked with. They like their job and they program in whatever language they happened to end up with and very few wants to invest in learning a whole new paradigm. It's so hard to get developers to let go of Java 8 some times. Most Java developers have probably never used records in Java. \n So what am I getting to. I don't know actually :-D just something I have been thinking about. \n What do you think. Can effect systems ever be mainstream? I can't really see it ever happening if most developers doesn't suddenly become super interested in learning new stuff.\n Also if you believe it can go mainstream how us it going to happen?\n    submitted by    /u/0OOO00000OO00O0O0OOO  \n [link]   [comments]",

The reason is that we are a data engineering team, and none of us are familiar with Golang stack. We re-code it to improve maintainability.\n The logic is extremely simple, the HTTP server just listens for POST requests, based on the extract the payload in raw bytes and forward to Kafka. There are mappings of 1:1 between the URI and Kafka topic so that we know where to forward the events, something like https://blah.com/api/v1/app_events -> app_events Kafka topic. These mappings are fixed and provisioned from a config file.\n Previously, with the Go (Gin) version, with 1 Core, we are able to reach 2.5K RPS. Now, with the Akka HTTP version, we could not go higher than 1.1K RPS.\n The Akka HTTP version is 10.2.7.\n Initially, we thought It could be the Kafka producer that slows the server down, but it wasn't, without the Kafka producer, RPS did not improve.\n Is this a valid outcome? That we have to accept that Go(Gin) is >2x faster than Akka HTTP?\n ==== Updated =====\n I was just performed another loadtest because I suspected at my usage of optionalHeaderValueByName directive.

Boopickle seems to support Scala 3 by now (though not chameleon which sloth uses to abstract away boopickle).\n Since Scala 3 should enable this kind of functionality without the headache inducing macro code required on 2.x, what would people recommend as a Scala 3 solution for client-service communications, with as little boilerplate as possible, and ideally using boopickle (it's much smaller than the equivalent json and I like the obfuscation) ?\n It's all Scala front-to-back, no need to care about any other language or format, and I'm not opposed to switching it all out in order to move to Scala 3.\n Thank you for any suggestions.\n    submitted by    /u/androidthepandroid  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello, \n I am currently working through a purescript book and really enjoying everything I’m learning! I’m currently working through implementing stock Prelude functions. Apply and flip were easy enough to understand:\n apply :: forall a b. (a -> b) -> a -> b apply f x = f x\n flip :: forall a b c. (a -> b -> c) -> b -> a -> c flip f x y = f y x\n Now, for the implementation of applyFlipped, the book implements it as:\n applyFlipped :: forall a b. a -> (a -> b) -> b applyFlipped = flip apply\n So from my understanding, applyFlipped accepts two arguments: a parameter of type a, and a function that accepts a parameter of type a and returns a parameter of type b. Because purescript is implicitly right-associative, that would mean that the function with explicit parameters would read:\n applyFlipped x f = (flip (apply x f))\n My question is: why does the compiler interpret this as flip with parameters apply, x, and f, rather than interpreting it as apply with parameters x and f (which wouldn’t compile), whose result is a parameter for flip?\n    submitted by    /u/helplesslyclever  \n [link]   [comments]",

So for example if I have in window 1 a block of text that is at a third level, when I am going to paste in window 2 `at a specific point` at a 5th level, is `not` going to be recognized that need to be pasted \"under\" the 5th level and so be recognized as a 6th level the heading(from window 1) and at a 7th level the relative subheading. \n I would rather select multiple files in window 1 and paste in window 2:\n 2) I would like to select multiple headings, or subheadings in window 1 an then just paste them in window 2, so far I have been able only to do it one per time, instead I was expecting to cut in window 1 all the text I needed and then paste all in window2 (I mean like when I am using a resource browser on a PC and I select with control click all the items i need(not consequential) and then paste on a certain point in window 2\n    submitted by    /u/ivano_GiovSiciliano  \n [link]   [comments]",

So far, I have successfully managed to convert all my configuration files and custom shell scripts into Org files that tangle into the proper file formats, but I have been unsuccessful in doing so for my custom snippets. I have several snippets meant for Org-mode, an example being a file with its content being the following:\n # -*- mode: snippet -*- # name: user-config # key: uc # -- #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle user-config.el $1 #+END_SRC \n The snippet will create a source block that will tangle its contents into `user-config.el'. The problem with this is that I cannot get such a file out just by doing what I normally do to tangle files. I tried the following:\n #+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle test.sh # -*- mode: snippet -*- # name: user-config # key: uc # -- #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle user-config.el $1 #+END_SRC #+end_src \n I tried to distinguish the real source block from the one that I wish to be exported literally by using indents and different capitalisation but the file I get by tangling this is\n  # -*- mode: snippet -*- # name: user-config # key: uc # -- #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle user-config.el $1 \n It clearly cuts off at the first #+END_SRC block. It's not a crippling issue but seeing how I have a whole directory of non-Org files in a repository of only Org files is quite uncomfortable.

          "description": "I read the emails in my Gmail account in Gnus but I don't store the emails locally, and instead use Gnus's nnimap backend to fetch them. I occasionally want to link to an email from an Org file and want to know how to do it in a robust way. Linking to an email that is still in my INBOX works, but as soon as it expires the link is dead. I thought using gnus-cache-enter-article (bound to *) would instruct Gnus to keep the email around so the link would continue to work, but it doesn't: oddly Gnus still shows the starred email in my INBOX even if it is marked as expired, but the Org link stops working.\n I don't delete any email from my Gmail account so in principle I could have long-lasting links to emails there. I bet somebody has already figured out what to do. I can think of a few possibilities:\n  \nMaybe there's a way to process the links to point to [Gmail]/All Mail instead, which seem to last longer, but I believe the also stop working after a while (I'm not sure they do, but I have a vague recollection of testing this once, maybe the Gmail IMAP implementation is responsible for the impermanence).\n \nMaybe * doesn't keep the links working, but Gnus has several other ways of marking messages to be kept and one of those methods works (I'm no expert on Gnus!).\n \nMaybe there's a convenient way to keep locally copies of the messages in another Gnus backend? Like maybe I can copy a message to some other account which I only use for local storage, and link to that copy instead?\n \n Does anyone have a good method for this, using any of those ideas or a different better one?\n    submitted by    /u/oantolin  \n [link]   [comments]",

My code snippet below seems to be working (having tested thoroughly though), but I wonder if there is a more elegant way to achieve this:\n (add-hook 'buffer-list-update-hook #'(lambda () (when (bound-and-true-p lsp-ui-mode) (define-key evil-motion-state-local-map (kbd \"K\") #'lsp-ui-doc-glance)))) \n    submitted by    /u/yep808  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "So, to understand my problem, let me explain my situation.\n I am Greek and naturally a lot of my files are in greek. To make org export to a latex pdf properly, if it has greek characters, you need to add some packages to it. I have those in my org-latex-packages-alist and everything exports just fine. \n However, when we get to exporting org-roam files (or any file that contains file links for that matter), there is a problem. The org latex export backend typically exports a link like \\href{file_name}{description}. If the file name is in greek (which odds are it is), latex starts to freak out a bit. Org will export perfectly to latex, but latex won't export to pdf. To my understanding, it doesn't understand the greek characters in the file name (which it should as it understands them everywhere else) and it chooses not to export.\n After a lot of searching, I did manage to find a solution to this in this post. Basically, if the link is of the form \\href{\\detokenize{file_name}}{description}, it exports perfectly. From what I understand, that command just makes it recognize any unicode character for file names. \n So my question is, can you configure the org latex export backend to export links in the form \\href{\\detokenize{file_name}}{description} and not \\href{file_name}{description} as it does by default. I couldn't find any option that changes how hyperref makes its links in the hyperref manual, nor could I find how org exports its links to latex in the org-export manual, so if anyone here knows, it would help me greatly.\n Thanks in advance!\n    submitted by    /u/AuroraDraco  \n [link]   [comments]",

Recently I got back into it (mainly via vim -> evilmode) and I am currently hacking away on my own config. (The stream series \"Emacs from Scratch\" by System Crafters was insanely helpful.)\n I am a physics postgrad and use R for data analysis and yihui's suite of R packages for any type of write-up/publishing.\n  \nRMarkdown: Simple Markdown syntax to write documents with R code blocks mainly to avoid writing LaTeX directly and for reproducibility.\n bookdown: Write scientific reports in RMarkdown and export them to html (Github Pages) and pdf with references and citations.\n blogdown: Publish my personal website via a simple RMarkdown syntax and easy to use R-functions. (Not thaaaat important to me, I don't blog regularly)\n  \nI have realised that I can do most of those things also using orgmode. Is someone here who made a similar switch from the RMarkdown ecosystem to orgmode, who could point me in the right direction regarding workflows, packages or tutorials etc? I am slowly getting paralysed by the amount of possibilities I have with emacs and now orgmode....\n ​\n edit: I mainly want to switch to emacs with orgmode to get away from RStudio.

But the problem was I couldn't leave the lisp expressions as it is if I have to submit the paper somewhere. S…",

I am/was very happy with neovim's current state of plugins, ecosystem, lua configuration and vi's philosophy on editing text.\n However I've reached a point where I \n A) have become very interested in lisp languages and\n B) realized that I would like a much more flexible and complete computing environment that goes beyond my text editor. \n Funnily enough this problem was solved many years ago by the dark side (just a joke 🤣). So I'm pretty excited to dive into Emacs, learn all about it and I know today its exactly the tool Id like for the rest of my computing career.\n I wanted to ask however to other emacs users, especially ex-Vimmers if readily slapping evil on emacs to make myself comfortable (at least on the text editing side) can hinder me from learning all the ins and outs of emacs?\n I have grown very accustomed to vim's text editing experience. Its so precise and short. I'm very used to changing text with up to 3 or 4 keystrokes to a precision that is very hard to get out of. I mean this in the best of ways, I really like Emacs and am having a lot of fun learning it. I'm just asking to better understand how I should go about this. I'd imagine that the text editing part is such a minor attribute of the power of Emacs and what its capable of that maybe it wouldn't make a difference how one chooses to edit text.\n Thanks in advance 👍\n    submitted by    /u/BeyondWordsRJ  \n [link]   [comments]",

I upgraded to org-roam v2 about two months ago after using v1 for a few months before that. I felt org-roam-server quite useful primarily for visualizing which ideas link to which others. However, I haven't felt the same introauitiveness with org-roam-ui (the server counterpart for v2). And the graph always seems too cluttered and rather difficult to use for purposes of idea-link visualization. Has anyone else felt this? Is it just a matter of getting used to?\n PS: org-roam-ui certainly is useful for checking nodes and obtaining a visually appealing overview of the personal knowledge base. But something feels off. I wonder if it is related to different coloring algorithms, wherein org-roam-server seems to color \"daughter\" nodes close to the parent node, especially if the parent node is a \"hub\", whereas org-roam-ui seems to use no such heuristic.

The build was a little buggy, but after building, I decided to install it using 'make install' - having followed some comments on this sub and elsewhere that the side-by-side install would work, since the default directory would be my 'local', separate to where Arch puts pacman packages (where my normal Emacs is) - for safety I used the prefix option and called it 'TRANemacs'.\n But the background-only transparency emacs remained a bit buggy so I decided to uninstall using 'make uninstall'. Upon running my normal emacs, everything seemed to work normally except that the Cinnamon task bar shows an empty icon where the Emacs logo should be. Further digging shows that emacs has a logo, but emacs-client (which I guess is what gets started) doesn't. I reinstalled emacs with pacman but there is no change.\n Further to that, worth noting that it seems like 'make uninstall' did not cleanly remove everything related to TRANemacs, but I don't think the files left behind (e.g. the site-lisp folder) are very important.\n I'm not great at solving this sort of problem.

Especially considering that the likelihood of the bug actually being in helpful is not very high, it's more probable that it's somewhere else in my config -- I've seen it before, just less often.\n By digging through Emacs source, I've been able to find that the actual source of the message is face-attributes-as-vector, a function defined in xfaces.c. Deep in the C code. That's the only place anywhere I can find this error message text.\n Now I'm trying to trace the calls to it to find out just where and what resulted in the nil :family and nothing seems to work, neither trace.el nor Edebug -- it just prints the message and goes off on its merry way. Manually advising it with something to the tune of (defun trace-face-attrs (a-plist) (message \"Tracing: %s\" a-plist)) (advice-add 'face-attributes-as-vector :before #'trace-face-attrs) doesn't result in advice function getting called either.\n It's like the function isn't actually getting called at all.\n How do I get at the root of this damned thing?\n    submitted by    /u/rn3aoh  \n [link]   [comments]",

And running it manually solves my problem. Now, I would like to have it to run automatically when the *Python* buffer is longer than X lines, but can't find how to do it. \n One related issue is that I shouldn't run into a long buffer limitation than quickly, i.e. I should prevent very long variables (e.g. long lists) from being entirely printed in the buffer. For instance, when print() is called, I would like to only print the first and last 10 entries of a variable if it is longer than e.g. 100 lines. However, here again, I can't find how to do it...\n ​\n Any help would be much appreciated, thank you a lot in advance! :)\n    submitted by    /u/wehrad  \n [link]   [comments]",

Is there any way to customize the tab-bar-switch-to-tab command to have an ido like completion? If not, is it something that can be implemented and how could I go about implementing that - asking for pointers to start with.\n    submitted by    /u/ginkx  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello everyone,\n I'm a writer who lives in Germany (12 published novels with Random House), and I started using emacs a year ago and am falling in love more and more. It is perfect for organizing material for my novels, and I even use Mu4e for e-mails by now.\n I would be happy to try to write my next novel with emacs. But there is one thing that just drives me crazy writing prose in emacs, and I wonder whether there is a solution to it. (Olivetti Mode or Writeroom mode do not solve this, regrettably.)\n When writing prose, I don't want to have a blank line between each paragraph, but to have them indented instead. It just looks awkard to me, to have lines of dialogue like this:\n \"I met another woman\", he said.\n .\n \"Who is it?\"\n .\n \"You don't know her.\"\n .\n She gave him a furious stare.\n ​\n ​\n It reather should look like this:\n ​\n \"I met another woman\", he said.\n ..... \"Who is it?\"\n ..... \"You don't know her.\"\n ..... She gave him a furious stare.\n ​\n (Reddit deletes blank space, I had to put dots there.)\n But the indentation shouldn't be Tabs or Spaces, it should just be how emacs displays the buffer.\n Is there a way to make this possible, a way to write prose without blank lines between the paragraphs and to have the first line of each paragraph indented?\n Formatted text properties like \"indent more\" insert spaces. Maybe this is the way emacs is made, and there is no way to just visually indent (like in a word processor) without putting characters in the document.\n Thank you so much for any help on this!\n Titus\n    submitted by    /u/TiMueller  \n [link]   [comments]",

I've now had the profiler start by default and tried to look at the profiler report right after I notice the lag, but that hasn't given me any clues. \n I'm thinking of resetting the profiler every few seconds or so to see if that helps, but I'm wondering if anyone here knows of another way to figure out what's going on. \n I've been reluctant to bisect my init since as I said before sometimes hours go by without running into this problem.\n    submitted by    /u/graduale  \n [link]   [comments]",

Unless there's something else out there or someone has started on something, I'd be more than happy to contribute, I just need some guidance on getting up to speed on everything required for a fully-functional major mode.

I messed around with counsel-fzf but what I got was fuzzy-finding in the current directory rather than the entire project.. \n I am trying out helm now and I keep running into this annoying issue when trying to use helm-fuzzy-find. Am I doing things right? Any suggestions on getting fuzzy finding working in emacs where whenever I trigger it, it searches the root project directory??\n ​\n THANKS!\n    submitted by    /u/EquivalentCancel6  \n [link]   [comments]",

Both are great softwares, and have their strengths and weaknesses.\n I'd like to share my thoughts, and see what you think.\n ​\n Pro for Emacs:\n  \nUnparalleled editing experience.\n Great support for tables, org-babel, etc.\n Highly customizable. Writing an elisp function is a lot faster than writing a plugin.\n A long history, a strong community. I'm really impressed how many great changes happen every year.\n  \nCons for Emacs:\n  \nBad support for multimedia, and I see little hope that this will be solved. (eaf might be a solution but I use macOS instead of Linux)\n Had to write many configs myself. Although I've made it comfortable for myself now, I think I'd have to throw more effort at it in the future.\n  \n​\n Pros for Logseq:\n  \nModern UI (it is not a clear win compared to emacs though)\n User-friendly note-taking. And I don't have to maintain my config. For example, using [[page]] to reference or create another page, viewing all journals in one page, etc.\n More note-taking related functions. For example, Zotero support, taking notes with, NLP (not yet, but in their roadmap), etc.\n FLOSS!\n  \nCons for Logseq:\n  \nHard to migrate. The format is too customized. But I think it is a common problem for doubly-linked note systems.\n Org-mode support is not that great. Inter-operatability is not as good as expected.\n  \n​\n There are also different considerations w.r.t. note taking:\n  \nWhen pressing enter, Logseq insert a new node as default instead of a newline as in Emacs.\n  \n​\n To me, Logseq seems to be a very modern and promising note system, while Emacs remains a lot more reliable. It is really hard to choose between those two.\n    submitted by    /u/aur3l14no  \n [link]   [comments]",

This works for individual tasks in the org file, but this is quite cumbersome if I wanted to upload my entire org file's scheduled tasks. I tried org-gcal-sync-buffer when I was in the org file, but it only uploaded the individual tasks that already had the org-gcal property to the calendar and ignored the other scheduled tasks. Is there a solution to upload everything in the org file at once?\n 2) I was wondering if a solution had already been implemented for dealing with recurring tasks in org mode and being implemented into the calendar yet? It seems like this is something others had wanted but I did not see any solutions.\n Thanks\n    submitted by    /u/waterstrider123  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I have been using org-roam for some time now and have a collection of multiple org files which are org-roam nodes stored in a folder called ~/Roamnotes. While capturing notes, I have setup org-roam to directly write to *.org.gpg files so that they get encrypted upon creation. Emacs uses EasyPG Assistant to encrypt and decrypt files automatically. So during my routine org-roam-node-find operation where I am trying to open one of the org-roam nodes (or files), EasyPG starts automatically decrypting all the nodes in my org-roam folder. This is normal and logical.\n My problem: The process of decryption is quite slow and I think could be handled by multi-processing the decryption of nodes via an external program or if possible in an async way.\n ​\n Is there a way to do this better? My roam notes collection is growing bigger and bigger and I fear that there might come a point where I might have to start the org-file decryption, take a nap and come back to it once I am awake.\n It is important for me to store my roam notes encrypted as I use them on my work and my personal computer (synced via syncthing) and it contains some quite sensitive information. One option I thought was to only encrypt files with sensitive information and keep the rest open, but this adds an overhead of always keeping in mind what I want to encrypt and what not.\n    submitted by    /u/shaggy_amreeki  \n [link]   [comments]",

I've been playing with it for just a few days now, and I've already found some of the KMs very helpful.\nThanks, @Will, for many of them!\nI was wondering if anyone had ever created a KM for inserting a link to a structure note on a zettel.\nFor me, I put my links to the structure note and other zettels at the very bottom of each zettel. I've used the naming convention for structure notes that includes the • between the UID and the text title.\nI was thinking if there was a way to set it up so it worked something like this:\nI place my cursor in the appropriate location in my zettel.\nI enter the key combination for the KM to insert my structure note link.\nIt then gives me a prompt, asking me which structure note I want to link to (it would limit it to those zettels with the • in the title).\nI select the appropriate structure note.\nIt automatically enters that structure note as a link in the format of UID and text title of the structure note.\nIs this possible? Is it unnecessary?\nThe reverse of this would be a time saver too. For me, I often add a link to my newest zettel to my structure note immediately after I create the zettel. So, if there was a way to go back to my structure note and use a KM to create a link to the most recently created zettel (of even a prompt to choose from one of the more recently created zettels) that would save time too.\nOr, have you guys found ways to save time and do this without a KM macro?",

That note is also connected to coaching and therapeutic ideas.\nI had some epiphanies and good concepts while working on those notes, and that created 2 other notes.\nAt first, I was writing everything in the first note \"Transform information into knowledge\" which was becoming almost like the start of an article. The \"flow\" got to me and I wrote some good ideas and made some good connections.\nI'm new to Zettelkasten but I remember the Permanent / Evergreen notes should be atomic and if possible, quite short.\nSo I splited my \"Transform information into knowledge\" note into 5 different notes.\nI now have 5 different notes, linked together, talking about the same idea.\nIn a MOC about Therapeutic Changes, I added all those 5 notes.\nIt's a bit confusing to me because naturally I would have kept \"Transform information into knowledge\" and let that note because a bit longer and like an \"index\" of all the others ideas, and put that note into my Therapeutic MOC.\nAnd when I see examples here and there I feel like permanent notes are not \"that short\" and even sometimes, not that atomic.\nWhat's the best method here in your opinion ?

And this is not a personal choice, but a requirement of my profession.  But the \"output\" of a Zettelkasten, as far as I understand it, is a chain of associations of my own ideas, not some kind of source Wiki.\nBut I need both and more: on the one hand, I need to relate my sources to each other, i.e. \"who quoted whom\", \"who learned from whom\", \"who wrote letters with whom\", etc and all based on the originals. On the other hand, I want to process my ideas and thoughts on quotations, excerpts, themes, etc. in a Zettelkasten. But beyond that, I need to make sure that my Zettel always refer to the sources from which they are inspired.\nThe question I have is: what is the best way to do this? Do I need two \"boxes\", one for the verbatim quotes with sources and a proper Zettelkasten for my ideas? If so, how do I connect the two boxes? Or should I do \"double bookkeeping\" and always write the original quote and source on each Zettel?\nTo reiterate: I know how a wiki works, and I think I also know how to set up a Zettelkasten; what is not yet clear to me is how to connect these two systems.",

          "description": "Hello Zettelkasten friends,\nI've made a few packages for working with my archive in Emacs, and thought you might like to take a look.\nThe general package, \"zk,\" is a basic set of functions for working with notes -- creating new notes, creating links, finding backlinks, renaming, searching, etc. It uses only built-in features of Emacs --- so no external dependencies. And it can be extended and modified in all the ways that Emacs can be extended and modified. My thought is that it could provide a baseline for people to fork and craft a set of functions to their own liking.\nIt just became available on Melpa and you can see a demonstration here: https://youtu.be/BixlUK4QTNk\nThe other package is called \"zk-index,\" offers two additional interfaces for browsing your notes.\nThe \"ZK-Index\" interface is a persistent listing of notes, in a dedicated buffer, that can be sorted (by date of modification or creation) and narrowed down by title or note contents.\nThe other interface, called \"ZK-Desktop\" (included in \"zk-index\"), offers a way of working with smaller selections of notes, for specific projects for example. You can select notes from the index to \"send to the desktop,\" where you can arrange them however you want, add commentary about the arrangements, etc. Like working with notecards on a desktop.\nYou can see a demontration of the index and desktop features here: https://youtu.be/7qNT87dphiA\n\n\nNote that \"zk-index\" is still a work in progress, so it's only available in the dev branch of the zk repository. But it's been working for me, so if you give it a shot and have some notes, please let me know, either here or in Github Issues!\nOn compatibility, \"zk\" is fairly configurable, so it should be able to work with your current archive, maybe with a little configuring. I started my own note-taking using \"The Archive,\" and the format of my notes and hasn't changed at all, so these packages should (I hope!) work with your existing archive.\nLet me know what you think!",

          "description": "This post may belong better on the KM or AppleScript forums, but I thought I'd ask here first mainly because I bet someone will have a far easier process than I'm trying to build.\nAfter writing a Zettel in The Archive, I want to remind myself to review it in a day, and after that, remind myself for a few days later.  A progressive review kind of thing.\nI have a KM macro that:\nPrompts me for the number of days, from a pre-made list.\nWrites a tag (#ReviewXDays, where X is the number of days) to an inserted 2nd line on the Zettel\nCopies the Zettel's h1 (from the 3rd character to the end of the line)\nCreates an Apple reminder \"Review such-and-such Zettel\" with a due date of the number of days out\nIt all works except the calculated Reminders date at the very end.  I think it must be either a variable type problem, or a syntax problem in the AppleScript.  I have a temporary KM Action before the last step that displays the date I'm trying to use.  If I simply copy that (correct-looking) result and paste it as a constant string in the final KM action, it works.  It just won't accept the variable version of that date.\nThe error is some variation of \"execution error: reminders got an error: can't get date (1/27/2022)\", depending on the tweaks I've tried in the script syntax.\nHas anyone\ncreated some kind of progressive review automation for themselves that's better than this\nworked with pushing a due date to Reminders via AppleScript\nThe image is of the last few actions, where the \"make new reminder\" line in the AppleScript is where I fail.\n\n...and here is my KM macro (1st time sharing, hope I do this right):\nAdd Review Tag\nThank you all.",

It is no different with us humans. People who have a strong persona come across to us as dishonest, insincere, insecure and/or generally untrustworthy.\nHowever, we humans have a special tolerance for people with strong personas because we usually have a personas ourselves. In a sense, we humans play a kind of social poker game and are familiar with the rules. We are, in a sense, talented and skilled at interacting with untrustworthy people. We have the security of being practiced.\nDogs, on the other hand, have no persona. The difference between a publicly displayed mask (persona) and a self hidden behind it is not understandable by them. What t…",

          "description": "Over the years of being a middlingly-talented web developer, I've learned a dislike of spaces in file names.  I know they are valid in filenames, and are at least addressed in URLs/URIs, but they seem to add just a little fragility to what is otherwise pretty solid without spaces.\nI'm about to embrace wholeheartedly the community's recommendation of a unique ID in the filename, followed by the plain English name.  I see the automation benefits of having the (Markdown) h1 in the Zettel being the same as the file name, so that leans me towards accepting spaces.  But one of my goals here is a pretty rigorous future proofing, portability, and stability.\nHave you all given this some thought and decided that spaces in file names are just not a problem at all?  If so, my set of files are still small enough that I can swap strategies.\nThank you for any advice you can give.",
