          "description": "TL;DR: New to Haskell and looking for an existing tool that can automatically insert traceShow statements for debugging. Also open to alternative suggestions or better ways to debug. Thanks in advance! \n Hello, Haskell enthusiasts! 👋\n I'm new to Haskell and I've been exploring the language through a project I'm working on. To debug my code, I've been manually inserting `traceShow` statements from the Debug.Trace module. While I find this method effective, it's also quite time-consuming.\n Problem Statement:\n I'm wondering if there's an existing tool that can automate the insertion of `traceShow` statements into Haskell code at key points. This would significantly streamline my debugging process.\n haskell\n -- Example: Original Code getMiddle2 :: String -> String getMiddle2 sourceString | isOddLength = takeMiddle 1 | otherwise = takeMiddle 2 where sourceLength = length sourceString ... \n What I Would Like the Tool to Produce:\n haskell\n -- Example: With traceShow statements getMiddle2 :: String -> String getMiddle2 sourceString | traceShow (\"Checking isOddLength:\", isOddLength) isOddLength = traceShow (\"Taking middle 1:\", takeMiddle 1) takeMiddle 1 | otherwise = traceShow (\"Taking middle 2:\", takeMiddle 2) takeMiddle 2 where sourceLength = traceShow (\"Source Length:\", sourceLength) length sourceString ... \n What I've Considered:\n I've thought about crafting a tool myself that involves parsing the Haskell source code into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) and then traversing this tree to insert `traceShow` statements. But before going down that rabbit hole, I wanted to consult the community. Is there already a tool out there that can help me with this?\n Open to Suggestions:\n Being new to Haskell, I'm also open to any advice or alternative approaches for debugging or learning the language. If there's a better way to do things, I'm all ears! 🐰\n Thank you for any recommendations, experiences, or advice you can share.

          "description": "A variation of this question have been asked before, unfortunately, I am not bright enough to understand them. So I am asking this question to hopefully get a more concrete answer from a particularly generous haskeller.\n When I researched the type of IO in haskell, I get this from ghci info:\n (GHC.Prim.State# GHC.Prim.RealWorld -> (# GHC.Prim.State# GHC.Prim.RealWorld, a #))\n I am not quite sure what any of this means, but from what I gather, this abstracts to something like this: IO _ := (RealWorld -> (RealWorld, _ )). This looks like the state monad, which has type: [W, W × _ ], for a choice of state handling type W. The StateT monad I see in documentation is a little different since it has monad composition StateT (s -> m (a, s)), so I guess I should say that we require the monad m to be the idenitity monad. \n My question is, why do we need to use these primitive types? Somehow, this makes it possible for IO functions to interact with the outside environment, like call other programs or writing to the file system. But how does that happen exactly? \n Second, what is this RealWorld? Is it a bitestring? An integer? A constant? When updating the state, what actually happens? \n Lastly, the ST monad, which has definition: ST s a. This type allows us to perform mutations to inside variables but it does not allow effects. From what I gather, this does in fact mutate memory. It also has a function to \"escape\" the ST wrapper, called runST. Obviously, this makes practical sense, but what is stopping up from simply writing a function runIO that escapes the IO. That would most certainly be a bug, but what is preventing us from doing it?\n    submitted by    /u/Alternative_Bug_5096  \n [link]   [comments]",

I've recently made another video about my 3D game engine project Game :: Dangerous (written in Haskell), which can be found as follows.\n Project repos: https://github.com/Mushy-pea\n Video: https://youtu.be/wOSQ1cYoZXM?si=bF2UtM_zr8OYOPHi\n I'm interested in what people think about some of the design choices I've made. One of the most interesting things to me about software development is how design and implementation interact. So briefly, the engine is not a development framework such as Unity or Unreal (nor anywhere near that complex) but more similar to GZDoom for example. It's a program that loads a text file, within which is encoded environment geometry, game logic scripting and references to asset files. The game logic scripting is implemented through a virtual machine in the engine that runs a bytecode form of the engine's custom scripting language.\n I spent a long time deciding how to implement a map editor, when I probably should have decided early on and developed it in parallel. What I eventually decided to do (in June 2022) was to write a local web server that loaded the same map files as the engine, allowed their state to be queried and modified through API requests from a client and could save that state back to the same text file format. That server now makes up about 20% of the Haskell code in the main repo and shares some static libraries with the engine. I've also started writing the web client that provides a UI for the map editor, a prototype of which is shown in the video.\n Anyway, thanks for reading and looking forward to feedback if anyone feels like it.\n    submitted by    /u/Mushy-pea  \n [link]   [comments]",

I was reading Learn You a Haskell and stumbled across this operator -: here, \n  \nHaskell ghci> landLeft 2 (landRight 1 (landLeft 1 (0,0))) (3,1)  When we apply the function landLeft 1 to (0,0) we get (1,0). Then, we land a bird on the right side, resulting in (1,1). Finally two birds land on the left side, resulting in (3,1). We apply a function to something by first writing the function and then writing its parameter, but here it would be better if the pole went first and then the landing function. If we make a function like this: haskell x -: f = f x  We can apply functions by first writing the parameter and then the function: haskell ghci> 100 -: (*3) 300 ghci> True -: not False ghci> (0,0) -: landLeft 2 (2,0)  By using this, we can repeatedly land birds on the pole in a more readable manner: haskell ghci> (0,0) -: landLeft 1 -: landRight 1 -: landLeft 2 (3,1) \n  \naccording to my expert research at this point in time there was no pipe operator in Haskell, so I looked up and found this page.\n here two operators are mentioned -: and :-, used together, could allow us also use expression in infix notation, instead of just functions.\n I checked in ghci and there are no such operators available. are these old operators that were removed? what's their story?\n    submitted by    /u/_hammi  \n [link]   [comments]",

At my dayjob, I have expressed my feelings towards Java and expressed I would like to do something more \"mathematically motivated\" and coined Scala and their effect systems as examples. My teamlead, who himself is a developer, wanted me to give him a bit more of an explanation of what I meant by this, so I set out to gather some information I can present to him.\n But\n I am confused as to how I can unite the following two descriptions of effects:\n  \nRob Norris in his talk 'Functional Programming with Effects' talks about mathematical functions and then talks about effects as basically ways to be able to do the stuff we're used to in programming like functions not being total, mutability, ... He then talks about the 6 most known 'effects' and wants to be able to compose them, then concludes that basically an effect is an `F[_]` which is a Monad.\n Cats-Effect, from the docs says that their typeclass hierarchy describe, fundamentally, what it means to be a functional effect. But their typeclass hierarchy is for their specific runtime and focusses almost exclusively on asynchrony, parallelism and concurrency. I don't see `Option` or `Either` fitting in here.\n  \nSo what gives? I am really confused at this point, but I would really appreciate if someone could shed some light on this. \n Bonus question: In the same talk, Rob Norris says that there are a lot of other effects out there. How do I find them? This sounds silly, but does he just mean like \"custom monads\" that we might define in our business which are only applicable in our custom business environment, or does he mean more powerful abstractions which are just more complex than the ones he showed?\n    submitted by    /u/Migeil  \n [link]   [comments]",

The code for the project is open source on Github, so in theory it should be doable. However, apparently most of it is in Scala, and my programming experience is already very limited to basically only some beginner Python.\n How doable would it be to use The Guardian's code as a base to create something similar myself, given this background? I'm willing to invest time and learning into it, but just wanted to ascertain the scale of the undertaking before committing to that.\n I'd appreciate any opinions or advice on this. Thank you very much!\n    submitted by    /u/THParryWilliams  \n [link]   [comments]",

You can get some deep dives into its design from previous blog posts. I’ll summarize it here as JSON, plus functions, plus types and contracts. One of its main use-cases is generating JSON configurations for other programs (Terraform, GitHub actions, etc). Functions allow you to generate large configurations without repeating information; types and contracts help detect problems early when the configuration is malformed and determine where the problem is.\nIn the JSON world, the role of contracts is served by JSON Schemas, which likewise specify the form that some JSON-encoded data should have.

I use it mostly for academic-writing, but I plan to explore more possibilities. \n If I posted this a year ago, probably I would say that I wanted some people's settings and just borrowed them. But the more I use org-mode (and Emacs), the more I appreciate the space for personalized settings. So, I decide to start building up my own settings as a rookie.\n Here is my question. I feel that I understand some basics of org-mode, but I am not familiar with \"how powerful\" it is--with all the great things I can do in org-mode. So, I am looking for a comprehensive introduction or settings of org-mode. It does not have to be for beginners, but I would like to see how a powerful org-mode environment looks like, probably with many useful packages.\n Suggestions?

But I find that org mode, and to some extent emacs, has too much friction for my liking.\n In the first place, it is not trivial to use with a mobile phone. Right now I have an emacs instance running inside termux, and notes have to be ported over with Syncthing. This necessitates (at least ideally) running a spare machine 24/7 to sync with. Not to mention that using my smartphone probably increases my risk of cancer at least slightly.\n If I have to write something down, I'm reluctant to open a new emacs window, navigate to my buffer, and then write down the point.\n Also, the default org-agenda views are much inferior to the typical calendar or timetable.\n Sorry for the emotional nature of this post.

Not long ago, they started detecting ad blockers in the browser while browsing YouTube, so as a company, they can change whatever they want overnight.\n I want to emphasize that I don't have a lot of money to spare, and I'm taking this step more for my peace of mind, to make sure I won't have any issues in the future. However, I would still like to ask for your advice, are you satisfied with Fastmail, have you had any problems with their service while using Mu4e and Emacs?\n I've noticed that they also support a feature called 'masked mail' and an option to add additional emails. If, for example, I want to display an email address on my CV that isn't my primary address and I'd like to deactivate it at some point, would it be better to use the option to add a new address or the \"masked mail\" option instead?

Finally I made a whole document with full details on the server in that point in time, which was pretty interesting as I could have this as a template for future incidents and have certain commands saved for this.\n And I got the idea, wouldn't it be interesting to have org mode files like these but for testing specific vulnerabilities?, even using a tool like NixOS or Guix to make commands that will get the old version x.x.x of nginx and I could test a vulnerability there, so it is also reproducible and everyone can use the org file and test this vulnerability?, basically more of a study and proof of concept rather than something more 'heavy' as in business related.\n ​\n Does anyone have a similar use case?, I would love to hear for them as I want to go into the DFIR route.\n ​\n TLDR.

          "description": "I use pdf-tools for reading and recently started using bookmark+ and dired+ for navigating. Unfortunately these two great packages seems to conflict. \n One of the issues I noticed was that the bookmark+ command for bookmarking a pdf location in a pdf-tools buffer didn't work; it gave an empty buffer warning. Turns out bookmark+ creator Drew Adams had already suggested a workaround which I discovered here: https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/72786/bookmark-plus-and-pdf-tools-pdf-view-error\n So that solved or at least patched that issue. But then I noticed that with dired+ installed and any fairly large pdf opened in pdf-tools, emacs will freeze if you attempt to do dired-jump or helm-find-files. Dired-jump without dired+ is not affected by the size of the pdf at all and just opens the underlying directory immediately. But with dired+ anything above about 1mb or so hangs it for quite a while, anything around 10mb or more just freezes it for minutes on end to the point that unless you want to go make yourself lunch and coffee, you will have to force kill emacs to keep working.\n As a noob, non-techie, non-developer, I just wanted to ask, what is the right way of asking about possibly getting this issue fixed, because I love these two packages and would love to have both in working order, but obviously don't have the coding know how to do it myself. Of course if anybody knows of a fix that's already out there for this issue, I'd love to know about that as well.\n    submitted by    /u/jcdix  \n [link]   [comments]",

Don't make me get back to that please) for development.\n By the way, I've seen several configurations scattered around the web, and something tells me that I've ended up in another anarchic realm (which is, something I both hate and love), as if that of distros -being the same except for one thing- wasn't enough.\n Of interest are: Python, Go, Bash, Clojure, Elixir, yaml (Docker, Terraform, Ansible), json, csv\n I would also appreciate the general must-have extensions, currently I'm getting lost navigating Doom Emacs and Melpa packages.\n Thank you!\n    submitted by    /u/Spatolone  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I am not skilled in drawing, but after trying PlantUML, I found that I can create visual representations directly using code. This has greatly aided my spatial imagination. \n Take, for example, the usecases diagram:\n @startuml :user: -right-> (Right) :user: -up-> (Up) @enduml \n https://preview.redd.it/1bx7h7sa7vub1.png?width=152&format=png&auto=webp&s=6271256f6855b88a93a62abf63569f1bc542ded5\n With the use of directional terms like \"up\" and \"right,\" you can intuitively draw the diagram as shown. it lowers barrier for non-artists - no drawing ability needed and focuses thought process on structural elements and relationships. \n When immersed in text, our spatial imagination can often become less active. For example, when trying to imagine the hierarchical structure of an article such as org-mode, our mental representation tends to be more like a bullet structure in an editor, rather than a graphical tree structure. \n PlantUML addresses the challenge of limited spatial imagination by providing an intuitive text-graph syntax. One notable feature is the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) functionality.\n Consider the following example:\n @startwbs !theme mono Emamcs ** Texting Editing ** Note taking ** File Manager ** Literature Programming @endwbs \n https://preview.redd.it/95b2mg6w9vub1.png?width=567&format=png&auto=webp&s=2e0f00c54e4d411ec731eba7b23a46a665ed78fc\n The WBS feature in PlantUML facilitates the effortless transformation of a vertical structure into a horizontal representation. This allows me to mentally interpret and visualize the PlantUML code, automatically converting the vertical structure into a spatially-oriented horizontal structure in mind. Consequently, it effectively resolves the issue of my limited visual imagination and improving it continually.\n ​\n    submitted by    /u/AbstProcDo  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I just tried out eglot today, and I must say that I am very very impressed. However, like all software, the julia language server has a few quirks that need to be worked around. Long story short, I have two folders (not nested or anything):\n  \nfolder1 - A git repository of a large julia project that I cloned. Starting eglot here only works partially. Anything imported from other packages is a missing reference.\n \nfolder2 - A folder I created with various scripts that I wrote for the project in folder1. It contains a Project.toml detailing the necessary julia environment for those scripts to work. Starting eglot here works flawlessly. Both functions defined in folder1 as well as the other packages folder1 relies upon are referenced correctly.\n \n Is there a way for me to start eglot in folder2 but have it work as if I have started it in folder1? \n I believe one potential solution might be to tell Project.el that the git repository in folder1 belongs to the project in folder2, but I couldn't find a command for doing so.\n Alternatively, can I tell eglot in folder1 to connect to the language server that was started by eglot in folder2?\n edit: Hope the question makes sense, and apologies if not everything is phrased in the correct language. I'm pretty new to both eglot and project.el. Many thanks in advance for any help or hints!\n    submitted by    /u/ImJustPassinBy  \n [link]   [comments]",

After searching for some packages, I found none that really suited me.\n So I decided to write my own: https://github.com/pedroangelo/theme-rotation.el\n Check it out and tell me what you guys think. I've also included a sort of related work section in the README that discusses similar packages, and why I didn't found them to my taste. \n PS: I wrote this package for my personal use. But if more people find it useful, I'd be quite satisfied with myself.\n Also, do you think I should work towards getting it published in MELPA?

          "description": "While a for-loop is a straightforward construct in other programming languages, the loop macro, despite its power, can present challenges due to its intricacy. I find myself frustrated by its complexity.\n However, its conceptual abstractions are intriguing. Take, for example, the following code snippet:\n (loop for i below 10 sum i) \n The utilization of the term \"below\" in this context is particularly striking. Contrastingly, in languages like JavaScript, I typically read \"i < 10\" as \"i less than 10,\" pronouncing the two words \"less than\" in order to read the \"<\" symbol.\n The act of reading \"<\" as \"less than\" momentarily interrupts my cognitive flow between the two words. The loop macro condenses it as a single word, \"below,\" allowing me to pronounce \"i < 10\" more succinctly and smoothly, without interruption. Another viable alternative could be \"under.\"\n Moreover, the expression `1 < i < 10` can be read as \"from 1 to 10.\"\n (loop for i from 1 to 10 sum i) \n It enhance code readability mentally and streamline cognitive processing. \n    submitted by    /u/AbstProcDo  \n [link]   [comments]",

This is like 'setq', but is meant for user options instead of plain variables. This means that 'setopt' will execute any 'custom-set' form associated with VARIABLE.\n  \nSo basically it looks like a customize-set-variable but shorter. Indeed, both are defined almost next to each other, with most of the interesting bits duplicated.\n After reading its source code, I have the impression that its only major difference with customize-set-variable (besides the fact that customize-set-variable is also a user command) is related to user theme.\n I am not sure about the impact of using one over the user, do you guys have an opinion about this ?

I need a tool that does basically this: I type a search phrase (name) and it shows every entry in an org file that contains this name, and if there's no entry with this name (i.e. heading with this name), automatically creates it.\n So it's basically deft, but deft works on multiple files which I find extremely inconvenient. I read the docs, but found no way to configure it to work on a single file.\n I believe it is possible to do with a simple org-capture using a custom function that checks if there is a heading in an org file and creates it if there is not. But elisp is high above my knowledge level right now and I don't want to invent the bicycle given how simple my problem is.\n I am extremely overwhelmed with options, but I think there must be some simple way to do this that does not require writing some custom code and (preferably) installing more plugins than I already have.\n    submitted by    /u/chesheersmile  \n [link]   [comments]",

I didn't try it in a vm first and thought I could just get away with having both on my machine with no problems. Stupid, I know. I ended up removing KDE and reinstalling gdm, but now I'm missing all of my GTK icons when I start up Emacs.\n https://i.imgur.com/fRdlr8o.png\n The strange part is, that only sometimes the usual GTK icons will show up, and it's always when I least expect it. I suspect that some of the config changes that happened when I installed KDE conflicted with my GTK and my QT themes.\n I've tried removing gtk3.0 and gtk4.0 folders from my ~/.config directory, removing ~/.local/share/icons, and inspecting ~/.themes, but I see nothing related to icons there. I'm just wondering what could be causing this behavior, and if it's conflicting with other applications on my system I haven't discovered yet. GNOME tweaks says I'm using Yaru-magenta-dark, which appears to be working everywhere except for Emacs.\n Interested what people's thoughts are on this.

Rebuilding from source feels like I'm punching open a hole someone intentionally closed.\n Is there a workaround for what I'm trying to do?

          "description": "In my quest to create a personalized note-taking system, I chose to use Emacs. While I'm aware of various existing packages like roam, zk, and org-journal, I wanted a solution that precisely catered to my needs, without unnecessary features or the loss of essential ones. This drove me back to Emacs from Logseq, as I realized I only required a simple system for taking daily notes.\n With that in mind, I crafted a configuration to facilitate note-taking and accomplished a feature I had long desired: integration with Raindrop to fetch my bookmarks. Surprisingly, it was a straightforward process.\n This experience has reaffirmed my belief in the versatility of Emacs, allowing it to be tailored to meet one's unique requirements. I'm now fully immersed in the world of Emacs.\n Feel free to take a look at my configuration and offer any tips, code suggestions, or ideas on how to further enhance, simplify, or expand it.

For the keywords colors, it was mostly fine, and at first I only checked that and was content with it. \n Things went a bit sour when I starting writing code, in particular the indent-rules. I have used mainly the following so far : - cmake-ts-mode - c++-ts-mode - yaml-ts-mode\n Over the past two weeks there has not been a work day where I did not have to complete or \"fix\" indentation rules to my liking.\n On the one hand it is much easier than before to tweak things, where either there was a customizable variable, either you were screwed. Now you can add rich rules, kind of easily\n On the other hand, the out of the box experience was much worse, barely usable indentation especially for the c++ mode which, despites its 4 presets, lacks the many quick toggles from cc-mode. \n I do commend maintainers though for their amazing core implementation, the api + utilities make debugging tree sitter rules a breeze. \n How has your treesitter Journey been so far ?\n    submitted by    /u/Horrih  \n [link]   [comments]",

In particular, I realized I could maintain state during macro execution using a register. IMO I found a cool solution and I'm proud of myself.\n My problem: I've been attending a class and downloaded all the lectures. Unfortunately, each lecture is in a folder named [lecture-xyz], and its subtitle twin is [lecture-xyz]_subtitles. It was annoying to find the current lecture because nothing was sorted. I decided to prefix each folder with a number so they would sort correctly in my file manager (and dired).\n The Initial Approach: I'd jump between the course website and my file manager, renaming folders one by one.

There are also more manual ways of doing this, with hooks (post self insert hooks?).\n However, I am struggling to find any documentation on any electric functions, and different other major modes do these kind of things in different ways. My question is: what is the best way to do what I am after? If there is one function that I can bundle both of these features in, then that might be better. But maybe it's best that I keep these separate in case the user wants to enable, for example, layout mode but not pairs mode.\n I'd love to hear from developers of major modes with experience implementing such a feature!\n    submitted by    /u/CountMoosuch  \n [link]   [comments]",

Despite this, and despite nuking all of my Projectile projects/caches (to be 100% sure), anytime I open a library directory within my monorepo; Projectile will consider that a new project and act accordingly (i.e. I can no longer search outside of that library's directory). To put it more explicitly:\n / monorepo-root | |--libraryA |--libraryB \n ... when I initially enter my project and search for a file, I can see that Projectile is correctly searching through all directories. However, when I then enter into, say, libraryA and again try to search for files in the monorepo, Projectile is only searching under libraryA (I understand it as being seen as a different project in Projectile's eyes).\n Am I missing something?\n    submitted by    /u/codethrasher  \n [link]   [comments]",

With this I also have the default directory synchronized and can easily use C-x C-f to edit files. Tab completion works too, as long I do not sudo -i .\n If I do - completions will break, which is not ideal because I have several scripts in the root path which I need to complete.\n If I leave the eshell way and use mx-shell oder eat-shell etc. I will have tab completion everywhere but the directory is not synched.\n I know I can just type C-x C-f /ssh:user@host|sudo::/file\n But the hostnames we are using are quite long and generic.

          "description": "Hej fellows,\n through work, I have discovered TimeTimers some years ago. I have found it easy to work with, which is why I've bought one for myself. However, I've been meaning to have something like this in emacs, because I've noticed that no matter the package (be it built-in or tmr), I am missing the convenience that a TimeTimer provides.\n First off, I'd like to know if any of you know a package that does this or something like this: conveniently display (in the modeline, maybe?) a bar or clock that shows the passage of time in a continuous fashion, i.e. showing a graphic representation (like a bar going from full to empty or a pie chart going from full to empty) instead of changing numbers (the customary form of representing a timer in my experience).\n If that's not a thing -- and I'd be flabbergasted about that to be frank --, I'd love to get some tips on how to implement this. If I were to choose, I'd preferably have a timetimer implemented as a decreasing progress bar in the mode line. The width would be depending upon the \"available space\" (dunno if there is a way to find that out for different configurations of modelines), the progress bar would be recalculated in regular intervals and the (pseudo-)continuous steps would be calculated depending on the time input when setting the timer. Maybe, the progress bar could \"blink\" (i.e. disappear and reappear) an amount of times to be set by a variable. For graphical representation, I am eyeing the SVG-LIB by Nicolas Rougier.\n I am grateful for tips and pointers, I am a bit at a loss as to where to start.\n Have a good day!\n    submitted by    /u/olivuser  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi everyone! Last week I released version 0.4 of ekg, which is an extensible tag-based, sqlite-backed note taking application for emacs.\n This version has been in the works for months, and has notable improvements:\n Drafts! You can now save (with C-x C-s) long notes and they will be tagged with \"draft\" and not show in other places until you commit the note.\n Magic tags! You can now have tags that automatically execute some elisp, useful for special notes that need some different editing. The standard example is setting your input method for notes with a tag indicating it's in a different language.\n LLM integration! Now you can have LLMs response to your notes inline, with prompts configured based on your tags. We use the new GNU ELPA llm package, so we support whatever it supports (right now Open AI and Google Cloud Vertex's APIs)\n File notes! Just like you can have notes on URLS, can you now have notes on files! It's basically a way to annotate any file. And because of how our prompt, template, and prefixing rules work, the directory structure can control the templates and prompts for any LLM integration you have.\n Also, here's a video demonstrating these features!\n Thanks to everyone who contributed to this release, notably Jay Rajput, Umar Ahmad and Qingshui Zheng!\n ​\n    submitted by    /u/ahyatt  \n [link]   [comments]",

When an imported library changes the only sensible way to deal with it is to stop the python process and start another one. (That's because in Python the built in \"import\" statement doesn't reload the file. You could reload each library with reload, but that would be tricky.)\n For that reason, I would like to use M-x compile. It's suitable for that kind of thing and I've used it for running programs written in other languages. (I think this is a fairly well known Emacs trick).\n The problem is Venvs. My projects use venv. If I just start a fresh python using M-x compile then it won't be in the right venv. I've thought about writing a batch file to solve this problem.

          "description": "Hello Emacs users, I'm currently trying to re-do my own emacs configuration but after facing thousands of issues, indenting buffers is the one thing that's going to turn me bald in a matter of hours.\n I'm trying to work with multiple languages, Go, Rust, Python, JS/TS, etc. The one thing I haven't figured out correctly is proper indentation without having to do keyboard gymnastics. I know that Emacs is more of a DIY thing, so any light shed here would be of great help. \n I've already tried (add-hook …), using the :config section in my (use-package go-mode) declarations and more but none of them are having any visible effect. \n Furthermore, I saw this issue with Go and I heavily suspect other programming languages won't come out as clean as I think. \n Every time I edit a Go file, when adding a new line to anything that needs indentation (e.g: a function body, if, for, etc.) Two “4 spaces” tabs are inserted no matter what. Even when I press the <TAB> key I have to backspace ALWAYS, also some closing delimiters like }) don't align properly, but I suspect that's another issue maybe fixed by puni.\n ​\n The “best” thing I could do to prevent newlines from getting messed up on creation was turning off electric-indent, I've heard mixed opinions on that, some say it's great, some say it's terrible, I don't really know. Without electric-indent I don't have to backspace two tabs on a newline, but TAB still creates those two tabs, even when my modeline reports (TABx4). Here is a snippet of the important stuff in my configuration file. \n (setq-default c-basic-offset 4 tab-width 4 indent-tabs-mode t standard-indent 4) ;; jsjsjsjs (electric-pair-mode 1) ;; Disable electric-indent messing up my code >:( (setq electric-indent-inhibit t electric-indent-mode nil) \n If any of you could spare your elisp-fu powers to me, I would be extremely thankful.

On the school computers we have to input given commands in the Linux console to get access to the \"import cv2\", but I do most of my work home and I have a windows.\n I was then wondering how I can download (?) and make it so I can import \"cv2\" and use it's commands like \"cv2.imread('plane.jpg')\" and so on. I've searched on google but found nothing useful.\n I'm kind of just starting out so I don't understand what it means to \"mix\"/\"import\" OpenCV into emacs and such things. I have downloaded OpenCV (I think) but I couldn't just start emacs and start using the functions from \"import cv2\".\n ​\n Short question: How can I use the \"import cv2\" on emacs and start working with pictures? As beginner friendly as possible.\n Thank you in advance!\n    submitted by    /u/Rodolf_cs  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm also finding Voice control and dictation software to be severely lacking. But I do feel like with the right Emacs set up I should be able to do more with less)\n Has anyone had success using emacs to help deal with their RSI? On a basic level I'm thinking of things like auto capitalizing sentences after. Or some kind of English friendly hippie expand to auto complete words using context. In the dream version maybe you can occasionally dictate words and then feed that through Local LLM to fix up the inevitable problems. Also, personally, something like a super abbreviation module that was great at auto completing words or guessing it words only using the left side of a split keyboard.\n The ultimate irony here is I'd love to take on some of these projects myself, but I can't effectively type anymore. Sad panda. After a few days of rest I'm able to test new keyboard, I got excited for a few hours, and then spend the rest of the day watching the pain in my right forearm intensify. I'm hoping to get up to some base level of functionality using existing tools that I can use the bootstrap my own development.\n Anyway, if there's anything you know of or directions you can put me in I greatly appreciate it.\n (if my current depression is coming through this post please excuse me, chronic pain is just a bitch and AA so when you can't do any of the things that you would normally do to take your mind off it.

Basically, what I mean is that, as also the case with jupyter notebooks, if I am doing an analysis and I run a cell which updates a variable itself in a self-referential way, without forgetting to run the cell where it was initialized, I get the wrong output. Is there a way to make sure one if I run an src block that depends on another src block, that the dependent src block will run before the one that I am currently running. I realize, I would need to manually tie these together.

As an MWE, I imagine the functionality kind of looking like...\n #+name: initialize #+begin_src python x = 5 #+end_src #+begin_src python :preamble (call_src \"initialize\") x+=1 #+end_src \n I tried...\n (defun call_src (name) (org-babel-goto-named-src-block name) (org-babel-execute-src-block)) \n but it seemed not to load the variables before running the cell (possibly because I am using Jupyter-Emacs w/ asynchronous src blocks). \n Any help is appreciated.

This package isn't for end-users, it's for others who are writing llm-based functionality to do so in a way that is agnostic of the llm backend. That way the user can use the LLM they have access to. LLMs are \"large language models\", very large systems that are able to deal with natural language with surprising naturalness.\n To start, we provide functionality for creating embeddings, and for LLM chat, in both sync and async versions. There are only two providers to start with: Open AI and Google Cloud Vertex. There's obviously more that are possible, such as Anthropic's API, or Llama 2.\n The difficulties with providing an interface to Llama 2, by the way, is that there seem to be a lot of different ways to install and use it, so it isn't clear that there's a good interface I could provide that would be widely useful. But it's pretty easy to write your own, and maybe I'll provide an interface that just goes to some command-line utility and executes it.\n If you are an author of a package that does something with LLMs, I'd encourage you to use this package, so your users can have some control of what backend they are using. And if you want to help expand the number of LLMs we have access to, please send a pull request if you have FSF papers.

          "description": "Recently I declared init bankruptcy, upgraded to emacs 29 and configured for my webdev needs from scratch. \n About 75% of my configuration was plain sailing. Most of the remaining 25% is related to completions. \n One massive problem I have is the *completions* minibuffer. I hate it. \n I don't want a minibuffer for completions. I'm trying to bend company to my needs. But the *completions* minibuffer pops up anyway. And when it does, it is very intrusive. It changes the layout of my frames. And when I make it go away, the buffer that I'm working in is repositioned. \n At the moment, it is the bane of my workflow. I'm working on a complex set of problems that require a lot of focus. And having my frames re-arranged unpredictably messes with my head. \n My understanding is that the *completions* minifbuffer can't be removed. Is there a way to prevent it from being invoked? \n ​\n ​\n    submitted by    /u/imacarpet  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I've been using Rene's Sublimeless Zettelkasten for a few years, building up a note archive that uses datetime ID links. I think The Archive follows the same convention.\nFor example, if I create a note called \"Test note\" now, the text file will have the name 202310191918 Test note.md, and the link inside the software will look like this: [[202310191918]] Test note.\nIt would be interesting to try an alternative app/software at some point. I've looked around quite a bit, and I'm surprised about how few there are who supports this link ID syntax. Most software like Obsidian, Roam, and the like, uses the \"[[full title inside the brackets]]\" style, making them unable to parse my note link syntax. Some allows for choosing slightly different ID types, but usually never this specific one which I thought was one of the simpler ones.\nFor example, clicking the \"test note\" link in Obsidian would just result in the software creating a blank note called 202310191918.md. The only software I'm aware of can parses the datetime link ID type, are these two:\n1Writer for iOS mobile phone\nThe Archive for MacOS\nI haven't found anything that supports the datetime link ID for neither Android nor Windows. Are any of you aware of any software I've missed that can be used? All platforms are interesting, from iOS/Android to Windows/Linux/Mac. I'm aware it's a possibility to edit all of my notes using a Python script or similar to make them compatible, but that would break compatibility with the software I use today. Happy for any tips.

          "description": "Most of Will's ZK focuses on self-improvement ideas. Is self-improvement a bad thing?  I don't think so. He needs a lot of improvement. They are reminders. Once he hears or reads an idea, it seems so naturally intuitive. He thinks, \"I've heard that before.\" He's unsure if capturing the idea in a note or writing it into the world makes a difference.\nAs soon as Will makes such a declaration, Will finds a truckload of notes that don't exactly fit the self-improvement line of ideas. Notes on ideas from Python, materials engineering, atmospheric science, architecture, self-driving cars, dog training, uji, vision, and many others. These others only make up a fraction of Will's ZK.\nWill is hunting for interesting things to take notes on that are not philosophically based on self-improvement.\nThis evolving process is happening from the bottom up. He is finding it to be quite enjoyable and is training his mind, enjoying the journey rather than just the end result.\nIs Will off base? Is this a thing?

This is to become our reading file, in which Margot and I are supposed to note down the books we’ve read, the author and the date.\n\n\nNiklas Luhmann (December 8, 1927-1998), famous for his own 90,000+ slip reading file, was a year and a half older than Anne Frank (June 12, 1929-1945) who received her first card index file in February 1943 (likely between the 27th, the date of her diary entry mentioning it and the prior diary entry on February 5th). It was given to her by her father at the age of 13. As would have been commonplace, she was intended to use it as a \"reading file\" to note down the books she'd read along with the author and the date.\nOne can only wonder at how many entries she would have made over the span of her life had it not come to such an abrupt end.\nFrank, Anne.

What are your personal views on AI, specifically ChatGPT and related models, in relation to how we engage with knowledge and conduct research?\nRecently, I had the opportunity to work with ChatGPT-4. I've been inputting numerous academic papers for analysis and summarization. From my perspective, this is one of its most valuable applications. I'm exploring worlds of CFS and Fibromyalgia, and as someone who isn't currently in academia (though I have past experience), ChatGPT has empowered me to undertake my own research. I believe I can do so reliably, evaluating various sources to draw practical, science-based conclusions. It has also allowed me to simplify complex topics by explaining concepts in clear, jargon-free language.\nA couple of additional questions: Are there any drawbacks to this approach?
