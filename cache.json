More background information here. The recent \"Ask Me Anything\" session with the CEO of Reddit didn't really address the concerns of people, and some subreddits decided that they would shutdown indefinitely.\n I think /r/haskell as a community should be discussing what action to take. On a personal level, this subreddit is pretty dear to me, as it has been my go-to place to keep up to date with the Haskell news over the years, and has been an invaluable source of information when I first started learning the language. So I guess my (kind of open-ended) question is: what is the stance of /r/haskell regarding the events happening on the broader Reddit? I am aware that a bunch of communities are migrating to some federated, open-source alternatives, most popular being Lemmy. Would us as a community consider such a mass exodus? The admin of functional.cafe, a Mastodon instance for the FP community, has recently been gauging interest in spinning up a Lemmy instance, maybe some arrangement could be made through cooperative effort?\n I have created this thread to hopefully seed some useful discussion surrounding these. I am looking forward to hear what the community thinks in general.\n    submitted by    /u/lonelymonad  \n [link]   [comments]",

In Haskell I find myself constantly jumping to type definitions, searching for documentation, or even grepping the project to recall the name of a function, when in (say) Rust or Typescript I could type foo. and have the editor show me what I need 90% of the time.\n Edit: Here's a concrete example. I was working on some code with a variable vec :: Vector Int and needed to split it into two vectors based on some predicate. I recall that there is a function for doing exactly this, but can't remember the name. In Haskell this is a situation where I usually find myself Googling for the Data.Vector documentation on Hackage. In other languages I would just type vec. and scan through the completion options to find what I need. This sort of thing happens many times per day and I feel like it makes a big difference in productivity.\n    submitted by    /u/polarbearwithagoatee  \n [link]   [comments]",

What I'm looking for is:\n --Laziness beyond the lazy infinite list (that's just an iterator / generator function with better syntax).\n --How to effectively exploit laziness to improve algorithmic efficiency.\n --How to avoid space leaks mostly reliably.\n --When space leaks occur, best practices in locating and debugging them.\n ​\n I do have Okasaki (Purely Functional Data Structures) and Bird (Algorithm Design with Haskell), but I haven't seriously gone through them. Are those books sufficient to master laziness / non-strictness to go from \"laziness is a 60-40 double-edged sword\" to \"laziness works for me 90+% of the time\"?\n ​\n \n ​\n It matters because, well, you have firms that deliberately choose a strict dialect of Haskell (SC, Mu), you have firms that go to -XStrict by default (NRI, Key.me), and, well, Purescript is strict, Idris is strict; Haskell is rare in making non-strict / lazy evaluation its default, and as functional programming becomes increasingly mainstream, Haskell's main long-term selling point will be its experiment with lazy-by-default.\n ​\n However, lazy-by-default is best known for the resulting space leaks, not for its expressiveness advantages. For I myself, I'd like to have a list of resources to understand how to get pervasive laziness not to screw me, but rather be a useful tool, and I think it'd be useful to be able to redirect skeptics and newbies to a laziness resource list.\n    submitted by    /u/Instrume  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Some years ago, I wrote myself a tool to download financial transactions from my bank and put them into a ledger journal. I found that manually entering the transaction with the hledger interface was too tedious for me.\n The tool uses the german FinTS standard, so the number of supported banks is limited.\n I've now released a new version that is mainly written in Haskell instead of Python. I did that because I noticed that I am much more likely to work on Haskell projects in my free time, simply because it is more fun for me.\n Unfortunately, this complicated the setup process somewhat, as one can no longer just run pip install fints2ledger. I would love to improve this in the future but don't really know a better way.\n Code feedback is also appreciated, especially from the perspective of people not too familiar with Haskell.\n Link to the tool: https://github.com/MoritzR/fints2ledger\n    submitted by    /u/TheOnlyHonk  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "We are glad to announce streamly 0.9.0 release. streamly-0.9.0 and streamly-core-0.1.0 have been available on Hackage for some time now, you can find reference documentation and some guides on https://streamly.composewell.com as well. The website also has functionality to search across multiple streamly packages.\n This release did a major revamp of the API to make it easier to comprehend and less error prone to use. Now there is a single \"Stream\" type instead of the polymorphic \"IsStream\" type class. There are explicit concurrency combinators to enable concurrent behavior on the same type instead of using different types for that purpose.\n Dependency on GHC rewrite rules has been removed for more robust behavior and better programmer control, though it required splitting the stream type into the default direct-style type \"Stream\" and the CPS type \"StreamK\".\n The package has been split into two, streamly-core intends to depend only on boot libraries (currently has some more deps due to backward compatibility), streamly provides higher level functionality like concurrency.\n Parser functionality has been released. Parsers fuse with streams and are compatible with folds i.e. parsers are folds with more power.\n See the following docs for more details:\n  \nChangelog\n Upgrade guide\n  \nYour feedback is important to us we did the API revamp based on the feedback from users.\n    submitted by    /u/hk_hooda  \n [link]   [comments]",

I tried building the haskell equiavlent using guards and if-else-thens and in the process i realised there's probably no way to build a freely floating independent block of code in a function that has other conditionals in haskell???....Or is there a way to do it?\n    submitted by    /u/changuchakkaram  \n [link]   [comments]",

A quick glance at the software stack and features:\n  \nVulkan for the rendering.\n The package effectful to keep the game logic independent from orthogonal aspects like logging, window handling, memory management and debugging.\n The package apecs for the overall game architecture.\n GLTF for importing 3D models from Blender.\n Features include moving pieces, 3D rotation, smooth zooming, a skybox, lighting and jumping knights :-)\n  \nAs you will recognize in the linked repository, the chess game is merely a running example of a larger endeavour: while implementing the game, I separated the reusable parts of the game into separate packages. The result of this process is hagato (Haskell Gamedev Toolkit), a collection of loosely coupled, easily combinable sub-libraries which can be used or ignored as desired, thus allowing developers to select features and technologies at will while remaining in full control of the overall game architecture. It makes use of the new cabal feature which allows one to put multiple public libraries into a single package.\n I published some additional packages on Hackage while implementing the game: apecs-effectful for integrating apecs into effectul, resource-effectful for managing resources in effectful, and chessica which implements the pure chess logic used in the 3D game.\n However, the chess game was just a testbed, to be honest. My overall goal is to use hagato now to implement the game I wanted to build in the first place, but I cannot share any details yet.\n    submitted by    /u/typedbyte  \n [link]   [comments]",

The corresponding functor laws are:\n traverse pure = pure -- purity law traverse (f <=< g) = traverse f <=< traverse g \n The paper An Investigation of the Laws of Traversals proves the latter law, but only when the monad is commutative, which suggests that this doesn't hold in general.

As far as I can see, there is no way to tell, from the docs alone, that this type is a re-export of Prelude.IO. However, this must be the case since the following code typechecks:\n import qualified Hedgehog.Internal.Prelude test1 :: Hedgehog.Internal.Prelude.IO () test1 = (pure () :: Prelude.IO ()) \n If I, on the other hand, search for e.g. Query on Hoogle, I will get lots of data types called Query that are not the same, ie. not re-exports. For example:\n  \nhttps://hackage.haskell.org/package/postgresql-simple-0.6.5/docs/Database-PostgreSQL-Simple.html#t:Query\n https://hackage.haskell.org/package/aws-0.24/docs/Aws-DynamoDb-Commands-Query.html#t:Query\n  \nWhich means that the following will not typecheck:\n import qualified Aws.DynamoDb.Commands.Query import qualified Database.PostgreSQL.Simple test2 :: Aws.DynamoDb.Commands.Query.Query test2 = (undefined :: Database.PostgreSQL.Simple.Query) \n Hence my question: given the Haddocks for two datatypes with the same name, is there a way to tell if they're the same?\n    submitted by    /u/runeks  \n [link]   [comments]",

But I want to talk about another way in which it fails to match the Haskell type system.\n In Hask, we can talk about an object representing Int, one representing Bool, one representing (Int, Bool), one representing Either Int Bool, etc.\n However, this only handles the structural types in Haskell. Haskell allows you to declare nominal types, e.g. newtype Age = Age Int or newtype Count = Count Int. Now those two types should be represented by distinct objects in Hask. There is, of course, an isomorphism between them.\n But how would one distinguish which one is which?\n If we want to represent all possible Haskell types, should we have an infinite number of objects structurally equivalent to Int, because each one could represent a different possible name?\n One approach would be to define Haskell types as pairs of objects from Hask with objects in a separate category of names.\n But then how would you enforce the fact that one name can be used for at most one type?

          "description": "As a follow-up to this old thread, I am pleased to announce the first release of the Kreuzberg Library.\n The library's primary purpose is to simplify the creation of declarative ScalaJS components.\n The concept is straightforward:\n  \nComponents can subscribe to models, which contain some state.\n Components declare event bindings (e.g., click events) that, in turn, modify models.\n If a model changes, the components emit new HTML (including event bindings and sub-components).\n The new HTML gets rendered.\n  \nAdditionally, Channels are included, which offer n:m communication and can be incorporated into event bindings (as sources and sinks).\n HTML rendering can be performed via Scalatags and Scala XML, but other mechanisms can also be implemented.\n The rendering engine can be changed. Currently, there are two simple client-side engines available: a simple imperative, and a ZIO-Based.\n A proof-of-concept RPC system is also available. You can declare a trait for a service, and macros will generate a stub for the client (ScalaJS) app and dispatcher code for the server side. In the examples, this is used to implement a TODO app with server-side storage.\n Components, Models, and Channels are identified by IDs, which are currently auto-incremented. This isn't entirely functional. I've experimented with other ideas, like creating IDs via a State-Monad, but they ended up being less practical.\n I'd love to hear your thoughts on this.\n    submitted by    /u/dernob  \n [link]   [comments]",

I started with example based tests and also tried with property based testing. Had some doubts and got it clarified in stackoverflow. My intention was to have a defined set of rules for the UserAlgebra. Since the interpreters are expected to follow the same rules, it would be easier to develop. Usually, I start with an InmemoryInterpreter implementation. Later another interpreter would be implemented for the real persistence based repository. \n Slowly, I got pulled in cats-laws && disciple with scalacheck until I ran into a considerably long phase that I dont understand why the compilation fails. \n Here is the snippet. https://scastie.scala-lang.org/itsnashter/HxcapljGSZylOtLyssJbLg/2. Can experts take a look to help me understand the following? \n  \nWhat is the general convention to test the tagless final algebraic resources? I dont want to use unsaferunSync() even in tests. \n Is having laws for repositories like \"create and get\" ( & rest like mentioned in scastie) really needed ? The Laws look like they were meant for structures like Monad. \n Cats laws seem interesting but there is not much to understand for a beginner like me. Are there any blogs? \n  \nI have gone through the following - https://www.iteratorshq.com/blog/tagless-with-discipline-testing-scala-code-the-right-way/\n    submitted by    /u/ItsNashter  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi, I've been using Scala on the backend for a many years and like many of us, I use Future for concurrency.\n But, I'm trying to understand why would I use Future in ScalaJS (just started learning) with JS being single threaded.\n One use-case I found is:\n I wrote a test website in ScalaJS with two links using ScalaTags. Each link/page randomly does a heavy computation and then renders a simple but very long HTML. I want to display a spinner when I click on either of the hyperlinks, until the computation ends and the dom is rendered. Without Future, on clicking either of the hyperlinks the page takes a while to update the dom, it kinda halts the browser, and then it renders my big azz ScalaTags HTML. The spinner does not get displayed (I toggle between display = none & display = block).\n But, when I set the dom to display the spinner in a Future, and then call the render function in another Future for the page clicked using QueueExecutionContext, now, I can see the spinner. \n Kinda weird! JS is still single threaded so why would the use of Future result in different behavior?\n Does this also mean that I should be using Future whenever I'm updating the dom?\n    submitted by    /u/Expensive-Photo7425  \n [link]   [comments]",

However, I do have a couple of questions that I hope you can help me with:\n ​\n 1) What technology stack should I consider?\n ​\n After careful consideration, I have made the decision to use tapir and http4s for my projects. However, I am currently torn between ZIO and Cats. Personally, I am leaning towards ZIO as it seems to offer a comprehensive and user-friendly effect system. Nevertheless, I am aware that Typelevel/Cats is more widely adopted in the industry. Could you please advise me on which one has a greater demand in the market?\n ​\n 2) Is it necessary for newcomers to have knowledge of Akka?\n ​\n I have some experience with GraphQL and have been exposed to RPC-like concepts and classic MVC patterns. However, I feel hesitant about diving into actors, as they remind me of the unnecessary complexity I encountered with redux-saga. Would it be mandatory for me to learn Akka for my first few projects, or can I initially focus on other aspects?\n ​\n Thank you in advance for your assistance!\n ​\n P.S. #1 I would greatly appreciate it if you could also recommend any helpful materials such as books or project ideas to aid me on this journey.\n ​\n P.S. #2 As a more serious and long-term project idea, I am considering developing a \"Job Aggregator (Scraper)\" or a \"Job Board.\" Personally, I lean towards the first variant as it aligns more with data processing, and I am eager to spend time designing a system that can scrape data in real-time and notify subscribers. \n P.S. #3 I would like to extend my appreciation to ChatGPT for its assistance in crafting this beautifully written post in English.\n View Poll\n    submitted by    /u/PilipchukBogdan  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Dear Fellow Scala Enthusiasts!\n I'm pleased to announce that Tyrian 0.7.0 has just been released. 🚀\n Tyrian is a Scala 3, Elm-like frontend web framework for Scala.js, and I'm particularly excited about this release. There's only a few real changes in it, but they're good ones! ...some of them are also quite fundamental to how Tyrian works, so please report any problems or come and say hello on our Discord server if anything looks odd: https://discord.gg/b5CD47g 😅\n First, one of the most requested features has finally been implemented: Tyrian now has frontend routing as standard. You can now make multi-page SPA's with minimal fuss.\n Second, Tyrian's tiny runtime has been completely rewritten, resulting in super snappy start up times, and better performance than ever thanks to the wizards behind Cats Effect 3.5. (Please don't forget that Tyrian works equally well with both CE and ZIO.)\n Third, another oft requested feature: You can now start Tyrian apps just by embedding the script in a page. No more launching via JavaScript if you don't want to!\n Finally, a small but welcome usability improvement around our CSS property naming. Properties are now available in `camelCase` as well as their original `kebab-case`.\n Full details are in the release notes: https://github.com/PurpleKingdomGames/tyrian/releases/tag/v0.7.0\n All examples and Tyrian's g8 template have been brought up to date, the docs site will probably lag behind a bit as usual. 😬\n I hope you give it a go, and don't be shy about hoping onto our Discord server if you need any help ...or even if you just fancy chatting about frontend dev, game dev, or to generally heap praise on Scala.js.\n Happy routing!\n    submitted by    /u/davesmith00000  \n [link]   [comments]",

All you have to do is create a new repository based on this template repository (or alternatively fork it) and click “Create codespace on main”, that’s it.\n Such Codespaces template repositories exist for many languages, but I couldn’t find one for Scala.

          "description": "So I'm building out my capture templates and I'm mostly squared away (borrowing a bit from Norang actually).\n One of the capture templates I use is for \"reminders\" these are tasks that I want to show up as a reminder on the agenda but are not TODO entries. A common use for me on these is for meetings. I drop the meeting on my calendar but capture it with a \"meeting\" capture template that clocks the meeting and I just notate my meeting notes within. \n To accomplish this I have a top level heading called Reminders and under that I store them:\n If its a one off I use the <2023-06-08 Thu 14:30> type of active timestamp so it shows on the agenda.\n If it is a recurring I use the following which I found online. the 3 means to show every 3rd day of the week. (1 2 3 4 5) would show mon-fri etc. \n ** Weekly Marketing Meeting 11:00-12:00 :Reminder: <%%(memq(calendar-day-of-week date) '(3))> \n My one off reminder capture template uses %^T to prompt for and insert an active date+time which works perfectly. \n I try to include this snippet of text in my capture template where I can just manually update the days I want the reminder to trigger for recurring ones like so\n (\"!\" \"recurring reminder\" entry (file \"~/Orgfiles/refile.org\") \"* %? :REMINDER:\\n %U\\n <%%(memq (calendar-day-of-week date) '(1 2 3 4 5))> \n \\n%a\\n%i\" :empty-lines 1)\n However when I run the capture I get this output\n  <%%![Error: (void-variable date)]> \n Ideally I'd love to use a prompt for \"which days to repeat\" where I could input 1 3 5 and get a m/w/f repeater output into the entry. \n I'm still learning so this might be really simple elisp issue creating the erorr and void variable situation here. \n ​\n    submitted by    /u/timmymayes  \n [link]   [comments]",

I would prefer to use Neovim instead though. \n I feel like emacs seems like a walled garden — where I’ll start to feel like everything I do on a computer needs to be done in emacs, as opposed to using a variety of different purpose-built tools together for task management and note taking.\n I could just use: - Markdown and LaTeX plus vimwiki to take notes - Task- and time-warrior for an agenda and to-do list - Ledger for financial management - Various shell or Python scripts to tie things together\n I’ve seen that people switch to emacs entirely for org-mode, however, and I can’t shake the feeling that I should maybe switch over.\n Edit: I definitely used “walled garden” the wrong way here; I meant that I might feel like I have to use emacs to do everything instead of having more flexibility to use other software. I see what y’all mean though, I don’t have to use it for everything if I don’t want.\n    submitted by    /u/Altruistic-Carpet-43  \n [link]   [comments]",

All has been well (after some tweaking) so far, but I have an issue where starting a new section title with the word \"Discussion\" turns the word red and into a different font, and it shows up in a different font in my Table of Contents. Adding a letter or taking one away fixes it. Not capitalizing it fixes it. Writing \"Conclusion and Discussion\" fixes it but \"Discussion and Conclusions\" does not. Only the word Discussion turns red and changes fonts. I have no idea where to begin troubleshooting this :) Anyone have any ideas?\n EDIT: the tex export shows the line \\section{{\\bfseries\\sffamily Discussion} and Conclusions} where the section header is. So something in org thinks I want the word Discussion to automatically change font family for some godforsaken reason.

Which means that both server and client will be on localhost.\n You can also specify a TCP socket allowing the server and the client to live on separate hosts. Is this right?\n Finally, if and when this happens when you edit files with emacsclient do you edit files on the client side or on the server side? Would this be a good use for editing files both on the server and the client? Or you should have something separate to edit files on the server? i.e. use git or ssh or nextcloud\n  \nThank you very much for your help.\n    submitted by    /u/Satrapes1  \n [link]   [comments]",

However, when viewed in EWW only the poster's profile picture is shown. This is not the case for images that show up as \"previews\" of webpages, e.g. in this tweet, both the profile picture and the previewed image of aircraft from the article both show up in EWW.\n I thought this issue would explain why, but the images I see in Firefox are .jpg, not webp. This might still be a nitter issue, but I would be interested to understand why this has happened.\n    submitted by    /u/nonreligious  \n [link]   [comments]",

How would I best do this?\n My current method is check the relevant process-buffer every 0.5 sec (with sleep-for) to see if the known regex pattern is observed, however this seems a bit sub-optimal. In particular I am unable to use Emacs until the pattern is observed (even though my process is async).\n I have tried to read up on process filters as my understanding is that they are functions which receive output from processes, but I can't figure out a way to \"wait\" until the regex pattern is observed via filters.\n Does anyone have any idea how to reliably achieve this, or any pointers on where I should look to understand process filters better to get to my solution?\n    submitted by    /u/fast-90  \n [link]   [comments]",

Funny enough, I feel like I’m procrastinating organizing my life cause I’m thinking “wait I need to get org mode set up first”.\n The problem is, I’ve seen people say it takes YEARS to understand emacs and that it has an incredibly high learning curve. I wouldn’t mind using something like doom or centaur, but at the same time, it seems weird to use a preconfigured editor and not understand what’s going on underneath the hood, especially if there’s an issue and I don’t know how to fix it. You think that’s a big deal or is using those preset editors perfectly fine? I’m looking to use vim bindings so I wonder if I should just stay with doom.\n I’m planning on reading “Mastering Emacs”, working through the built in tutorial, the elisp tutorial (maybe, but it seems weird to not understand the language the entire applications is built and configured in), and maybe Emacs from Scratch and the org mode udemy tutorial by Rainer Konig.\n After all that maybe I’ll know enough to build my own config, or at least understand a lot of what goes on in doom or centaur or something.\n    submitted by    /u/Altruistic-Carpet-43  \n [link]   [comments]",

I always thought it was much nicer than the default in GNU Emacs, where the popup window is not focused so you use C-M-v and C-M-V to scroll it and C-x 1 to get rid of the help window.\n After a short period of XEmacs, I brought with me that XEmacs behavior for help buffers to GNU Emacs.

If you need to examine and set the variables defined in another library (those meant for outside use), you can do it immediately—there is no need to wait until the library is loaded.\"\n Some obvious exceptions to setting variables \"immediately\" spring to mind, such as modifying a library's keymaps with define-key(). The keymaps must already exist, of course, which happens only after the library is loaded. I don't doubt that the manual authors had situations like that in mind with their beginning caveat, \"Normally . . .\" \n But more generally: what if the library, upon loading, overwrites -- with its own default values -- the values the user had earlier set? \n It seems to me that it's safer to put all setq()s and whatnot into with-eval-after-load and be done with it. Or are there benefits to the blunter \"don't bother waiting\" approach that I'm missing? \n This comment from the Info Manual is tormenting me: I would sooner die than write an ill-designed Lisp program!\n    submitted by    /u/tdavey  \n [link]   [comments]",

Sometimes helm lets me do that by choosing question mark [?], but that's not always the case.\n One example I experienced today. I'm using spacemacs with helm. I did find-file to a remote directory with TRAMP. So I'm in dired. From there I put M-x shell and it asked me the remote shell path. The default shown in helm text area is \"/bin/sh\" which is a reasonable default. But helm does not let me press enter there. So I can't open a remote shell.\n I thought there would be a way to just force put \"/bin/sh\", but I couldn't find any ways. C-f, C-z or whatever didn't work. I'm pretty surprised that helm does not have any unified way to fallback if there are no ways for a mature feature that existed such a long time.\n BTW, for that specific issue, I solved it with this elisp code, but I'm still curious if there's a way to fallback on helm.\n  (defadvice shell (around disable-helm activate) \"Disable helm-mode when calling `shell'.\" (if helm-mode (progn (helm-mode -1) ad-do-it (helm-mode 1)) ad-do-it)) \n    submitted by    /u/followspace  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "If anyone is interested, I've created an Atom backend for Gnus, which can be found here.\n I posted it to the Emacs development mailing list, but unfortunately it doesn't seem like there's much interest in it currently.\n The only major remaining issue with it is that it doesn't use Gnus' inheritance system, since I keep running into weird issues trying to implement it. If anyone is interested in helping with this I can provide more details. This doesn't affect usage at all, but it kinda sucks because I designed the backend to be very modular so it would be simple to quickly build custom backends.\n To use it, add (or browse) Atom feeds as servers, with the address being the URL of the feed (without a \"http://\" or \"https://\" prefix due to a limitation with how Gnus parses group names in some cases unfortunately). For example:\n (add-to-list 'gnus-secondary-select-methods '( nnatom \"somewebsite.tld/feed.xml\" (nnatom-name \"<optional custom name for the group>\"))) \n Each \"server\" will contain a single group with a name taken from the feed or 'nnatom-name'.\n Some design notes:\n  \nAtom feed entries (articles) can contain both a summary and \"content\" (or both, or neither). nnatom saves both, and allows viewing either by making the article multipart when needed.\n Every piece of data extracted from the feed is handled by a separate function, and all Gnus backend interface functions are generic, which allows very simple creation of derivative backends theoretically (you only need to implement a set of parsing functions for your feed).\n Every feed has it's own file for data storage, and those are the only files modified directly by nnatom.\n  \n   submitted by    /u/dsemy  \n [link]   [comments]",

I also want them to *not pair when point is next to a word. I thought I had everything I wanted with this:\n (defun my/text-electric-pair-inhibit (char) ;; Account for buffer-end weirdness (unless (eq (following-char) 0) (or ;; (electric-pair-inhibit-if-helps-balance char) ;; TODO This logic isn't quite right, check out how ;; `electric-pair-inhibit-if-helps-balance' does it. ;; (electric-pair-conservative-inhibit char) ;; Don't pair after before a word (memq (char-syntax (char-before)) '(?w ?.))

I get a few different bugs. Most of the time, the pairing works but the inhibition doesn't (characters still pair immediately before or after a word character). Sometimes different characters with the same syntax class behave differently (e.g. \"=\" and \"/\", one will be inhibited and the other not). \n I'm really confused.

The autocomplete feature is great, but causes me issues when I am navigating through the code. \n A simple example is: when I comment a line in my code, and try to move to the line above or below, I can't do it. This is because the auto-complete pops up, and it scrolls through those options rather than go up or down in my code. As a result, every time I need to comment -> move left -> move up, instead of just moving up. Commenting is just one example. There are several other times (changing variables and so on) where this happens.\n I want the autocomplete to help me when I am trying to finish a variable or call a function, not unnecessarily bother me like this. Do you guys know of any solution to fix this?

Getting used to text-operation stuff (like C-a/M-f) to some extent makes consistency.\n - I use Japanese keyboard on desktop and laptop so that I can remap <muhenkan>, <henkan>, and <katakanahiragana> key (they are on my thumbs position) to control, shift, and escape key. I want my keyboard layout to be the same on desktop and laptop, so thumb clusters keyboards are not my choice.\n - I use meow for modal editing. I've used evil, but I didn't like to configure evil key bindings for every different mode. I also didn't like to disable evil completely for some modes. I just wanted to use j/k and J/K (I map J/K to scroll up/down faster) in certain modes like magit, that do not require much text editing. The thing I like the most about meow is its motion mode. In motion mode, I can use j/k and J/K to scroll, and if I wanted to dispatch keys that are bound in major-mode maps, I can simply prefix them with SPC key (the default is Hyper key, I changed it). In magit for example, I can dispatch k (magit-discard) by pressing SPC-k. Any keys that are not in motion mode map follow the major mode map. I do not use meow keypad because I'm comfortable with pressing control key. But for those who are not, meow keypad might be good.\n ​\n What do you think?

I've never used Vim before, and I don't think I ever will. I have a keyboard with thumb clusters, which eliminates the issue of the \"Emacs pinky\" entirely. In fact, I find myself preferring chorded commands because they make me feel like a Jedi, with my keyboard as a lightsaber of sorts. It all started with cut/copy/paste when I was a child, and Emacs' style of running commands feels more like magical sorcery to me.\n Moreover, I use a different keyboard layout than the standard \"QWERTY,\" so the default movement keys in Vim (\"HJKL\") are less convenient for me.\n I've noticed that switching between insert and normal mode in Evil Mode throws me off a bit, but maybe I just need to get used to it. I often hear people say that Evil Mode is a superior way to edit text compared to the default Emacs keybindings. However, I wonder if this preference is mostly driven by those who started with Vim and are already used to modal editing.\n I'm curious to hear your thoughts. In your opinion, what makes modal editing either superior/inferior? I'm particularly interested in hearing from those who have switched from Emacs to Vim (lol), especially if they inadvertently got used to Emacs keybindings first.\n Looking forward to your insights!\n    submitted by    /u/MysteryLiezer  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm coming from NeoVim and VSCode and both of those have a pretty easy way to fuzzy search for files in the current directory. VSCode has this built in and NeoVim can do this through telescope.\n It feels like there isn't a \"simple\" solution to this in emacs. find-file more or less requires me to type the path. Yes you get tab completion, but that's still pretty slow in comparison. And beyond that i seem to get into selectrum, orderless, marginalia and what not, which for one doesn't seem to solve this problem either, and feels needlessly complex for what i'm trying to do.\n So, my workflow has always been that i open my editor in my main projects directory. When i want to open a file, i press a hotkey and start searching with file and folder names. In 99.99% of cases i know exactly how the file is named and where it's located. I just don't want to have to type out the path. I'd rather type the parts of the path that are unique and get there quickly.\n What's the simplest solution for this? All i really need is a wrapper around fzf. fzf.el would do what i need, but doesn't work on windows. There is a fork of fzf.el that \"should\" fix that but i can't get it to work. I'm also not too sure how to point use-package to a random git repository rather than what's on melpa.\n    submitted by    /u/domsch1988  \n [link]   [comments]",

YOU can implement the features that were impossibly hard for the previous generation. YOU can implement an object-at-point highlighter that is more performant and correct than ever.

Now everyone is about to have their tree exposed to package developers, not just lisp. The other languages always had a tree, it was just hidden.

Nothing seems to work like it should.

But Emacs has provided the latest clue.\n I was trying to update my packages via M-x package-display-packages. This brings up the list of packages as expected, but when I try to 'update all' via 'U', I get the message \"waiting for refresh to finish\". Only it didn't, after many minutes, when it usually takes a few seconds.\n This lead to many rabbit holes, until I discovered that the problem happens on my home wifi network, but if I switch to my cellular network (via a phone hotspot), the problem disappears - I can refresh my package list almost instantly.\n This makes me suspect other issues with services hanging when on my home network (but not on my cell data) may be related. \n So: how does Emacs connect to elpa/melpa/etc? I'm hoping understanding this better might help me resolve my network issues.\n Other observations:\n  \nwhile the package update hung, I could still load webpages, including those for the repositories I use (elpa, melpa)\n \nusing curl -I to connect to the repositories also worked, even while I couldn't refresh the package list.\n \nI build Emacs from source, and the problem existed on the previous build yesterday (which was several months old), and the latest build from sources pulled last night.\n \n As I said, not an Emacs issue, but maybe Emacs not being able to contact the repositories is a clue to the network issue?\n Any suggestions?\n Thanks,\n    submitted by    /u/plantarum  \n [link]   [comments]",

Problem is, whenever I make a change in the org file, and tangle the changes, the git repo for my dotfiles now sees two different files being modified (obviously) with the same changes. It makes it really cumbersome to do proper commits, since if I did many changes and I'd like to do various commits for each of them, I have to add not only the changes in the org file, but also hunt down the same modifications in the init and early-init files (mostly init tho).\n I recently tried to fix this by dropping all of the init.el contents into some other file, call it \"real-init.el\". Then, I would have a very minimal init.el that would check if init and early-init exist, and if they don't, it would tangle the org file and restart emacs. I would just keep track of the org file and the minimal init file in the git repo, and since the init file is very minimal and wouldn't change very often, it would be a fine compromise.\n For some odd reason, while the files did get tangled, emacs would just restart indefinitely.

          "description": "I've spent quite a lot of time in LISP-land over the last few years and have internalized and begun to rely on a lot of nifty paredit features, for example slurping and barfing.\n When writing and editing, for example, JavaScript or C++ code I end up situations where I instinctively try to slurp identifiers with, obviously, no success.\n Even though there are relatively few cases where this would make sense in non-sexp code, there are the cases of the misplaced parens, for example.. given the code:\n some_nifty_function_call(my_sweet_sweet_variable, another_splendid_variable, awesomest_variable_of_them_all); \n If I decide that I want to wrap one of these arguments in a function, I'd place the cursor before the argument and enter the function name followed by a left-paren, the mode will be kind and automatically insert a closing paren and I end up with the following, with the cursor inside the parens of `awesomify`\n some_nifty_function_call(my_sweet_sweet_variable, awesomify()another_splendid_variable, awesomest_variable_of_them_all); \n This is where I'd like to do the equivalent of a slurp, effectively moving that closing paren to the end of the next expression - after ànother_splendid_variable`, but before the comma.\n ​\n I figure I can't be the first one to experience the want for something like this. Does it exist? If not, does anyone have a good idea how to implement a minor mode for this?\n It doesn't have to be 100% fool-proof for my needs, and I figure it wouldn't be too hard to just make a dumb language-agnostic implementation for the exact example above. But I'd also like it to be DWIM:y enough and handle more complex expressions, in which case the mode would somehow need to hook into the syntax model of the language.\n Discuss! Or.. fight! Or insult me. I'm thankful for basically any thoughts on the matter that could move me in the right direction.\n    submitted by    /u/tinkerorb  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "For a long time, I didn't annotate my reading materials because I preferred reading on my tablet instead of my computer. And I never found a good app to use on my Android tablet either. And of course, without proper conversion to org-mode, all of those notes seemed useless.\n Then I discovered org-noter. I was excited but couldn't use it. The automatic window handling was frustrating, and I couldn't invest the time to fix it. Recently, I needed to take notes from multiple books, so I tried org-noter again, but I still can't find the best workflow.\n My initial issue was with the way how org-noter creates a \"special\" layout with a dedicated window. It sometimes even creates another frame - which I especially hate, even setting org-noter-always-create-frame to nil still occasionally creates a frame. I guess not a huge deal, I can live with that.\n After taking some notes, I noticed they were out of sync the next day. I tried to fix each note's page number manually - :NOTER_PAGE: prop, but it would randomly change the page numbers in other notes. Yes, I would open a page in pdf-tools, then I call org-noter-sync-current-page-or-chapter to check if the note and the page numbers match and fix them (when needed). But it also would change page numbers in some other notes. I can't figure out why. Clearly, either I'm doing something wrong, or I need to set some vars or it's just a bad combination of things, versions of pdf-tools, poppler, Emacs, etc. on my machine causing these issues. Maybe (like so many things) it just never properly worked on Mac?\n I want this tool to work, but I am struggling to find a workflow that fits. If my notes are consistently out of sync, I can't see the point of using org-noter. Can someone please advise me on their workflow, tips, and configuration?\n    submitted by    /u/ilemming  \n [link]   [comments]",

To help me with that, I have made a little function that shows me the current progress I have made today when I press s-#.\n It even has a \"graphical\" aspect to it, the color changes bit by bit from gray to green, and it simulates a \"bar\" that fills up. The number of characters/pages needed for my daily goal to be done is in a variable I have in my init file.\n I am sorry I opened a new thread, I wanted to post this in the thread \"Emacs for literature\", but I don't know how to post a picture in an answer to thread. So here is the Minibuffer a few times during the day, to give you some idea of what I mean.\n It is in German, the translation would be: 92.791 characters, 30 pages, equals 56 percent [today new: 0/2] Current page 93 percent, scene 1 page, chapter 1 page.\n In the modeline, I also show what \"page\" I am on. It just divides the length of the Buffer through the average number of characters on a standard page (3000 characters). Must seem like a very un-Emacsy way of doing things to you, but it helps me to get a feeling of getting things done somehow. :) \n https://preview.redd.it/unxa09de2l1b1.png?width=2560&format=png&auto=webp&s=09c7e520182c65caa1f4513aa336507c96b71fdc\n    submitted by    /u/TiMueller  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Howdy! I'm running Gentoo and using EXWM.\n I'm trying to set it up so that startx launches emacsclient. I start the server with emacs --daemon --eval \"(require 'exwm)\" -f exwm-enable (I've tried running this both from TTY and from within .xinitrc). In .xinitrc I start emacsclient with exec emacsclient -c.\n Once I've started the server and run startx, Emacs works perfectly the first time. But if I exit with C-x C-C (or switch to TTY2 and killall emacsclient) and run startx a second time, Emacs freezes and the frame shows up smaller and in the top-left corner of the screen.\n If it helps here's my .xinitrc:\n # Disable access control for the current user xhost +SI:localuser:$USER # Make Java applications aware this is a non-reparenting window manager export _JAVA_AWT_WM_NONREPARENTING=1 # Set default cursor xsetroot -cursor_name XC_crosshair # Set keyboard repeat rate xset r rate 200 60 # Start emacs # emacs --daemon --eval \"(require 'exwm)\" -f exwm-enable exec emacsclient -c \n And here's the relevant bit of my init.el:\n (use-package exwm :straight t :config (require 'exwm-config) (setq exwm-workspace-number 1) (exwm-enable)) \n Also there's this in early-init.el that might be relevant but I doubt it:\n (push '(fullscreen . maximized) initial-frame-alist) (push '(ns-transparent-titlebar . t) default-frame-alist) (setq frame-inhibit-implied-resize t frame-resize-pixelwise t) \n How can I find out what's causing the issue? I just can't understand why it works the first time but not the second time.\n Thanks in advance!\n    submitted by    /u/Tristan401  \n [link]   [comments]",

I've ordered the book purely to appreciate the insights in this article. I'm of course convinced I will find a lot of good stuff in it, but I haven't even began digging into it. But I did create the following little snippet that has in the last 24h already improved my quality of life significantly:\n ``` (setq switch-to-buffer-obey-display-actions t) ;; Introduce a bottom side window that catches ;; compilations, deadgreps etc. (add-to-list 'display-buffer-alist '(\"\\deadgrep.\\|\\Compilation\\\" (display-buffer-in-side-window) (side . bottom) (slot . 0) (window-parameters (no-delete-other-windows . t))))\n (defun deets/side-window-resize (enlarge) (let ((bottom-windows (window-at-side-list (window-normalize-frame nil) 'bottom))) (dolist (window bottom-windows) (when (symbolp (window-parameter window 'window-side)) (if enlarge (window-resize window (window-height window)) (window-resize window (- (/ (window-height window) 2))))))))\n (defun deets/side-window-toggle (arg) (interactive \"P\") (cond ((null arg) (window-toggle-side-windows)) ((listp arg) (deets/side-window-resize t)) ((symbolp arg) (deets/side-window-resize nil))))\n ;; Remove our side-windows (global-set-key (read-kbd-macro \"C-x w\") 'deets/side-window-toggle) ```\n When compiling or grepping, the window is placed a the bottom. I can quickly enlarge/shrink the window, and toggle it. Very happy with this, and I'm already thinking about further improvements.\n    submitted by    /u/__deeetz__  \n [link]   [comments]",

Why does this even happen?\n I have been using vim with same config from 2 years and it never needs any corrections. \n And why is emacs so slow when it has many packages that it requires a daemon to be launched first if you want quick access to client? My vim also has tons of packages and it starts almost immediately. \n You might say why the fuck would I want to even use emacs then? I need this for org-mode. I wrote many of my previous notes in org and even today it feels like org mode is best organising thoughts and also makes it easy to export to other formats.

So do these two keybindings have different functionality in different contexts, or are they always the same? Because why have two enabled by default? (Maybe for user convenience of different keyboard layouts, but this is a bit too confusing more than necessary, maybe the devs meant to implement keyboard layout detection but failed..?).\n This All may seem dumb to be asking, (like why not just rebind C-- to zoom out and get over with it) but I'm confused thinking that there probably should be a good reason this is not by default in Emacs yet.\n Maybe I'm just thinking too highly of the \"intelligent design behind Emacs\"?

I use various VIM flavors, VS Code, notepad, and have tried emacs, Zettlr and Obsidian. I'm fairly comfortable using any of those but am mainly using Zettlr right now.

I haven't figured out a good way to just pipe those notes into Zotero where I'd prefer them. My \"inbox\" is Zotero.\nWhy am I looking at Zettelkasten after all these years? Because I'm adventuring out into new phases in my life where I think notetaking and writing are going to become far more important. Mainly in the area of Genealogy. Genealogy has overlap with many topics/cross-overs in history, anthropology, social sciences, archive/library science, DNA, general research, writing. I need a better way to process and use information. While I have degrees in history, anthropology, and engineering, I've work in more practical fields, mainly Tech, for years and am well out of practice in research and writing.\nSince I haven't seriously written or researched in years, I need to shake the rust off. As part of that effort, I want better techniques to process and store what I've read. I think the \"commonplace\" tradition (and I fit Zettelkasten in that category for this discussion) is the only methodology that seriously considers the process of taking notes and tying them together. There is, I believe, a fairly complete workflow from figuring out what to read, how to read it, how to take notes about it, how to process those notes (including storage), how to tie notes together, and how to use them for output.\nAlso, it seems to be the most amenable method to fit into my plain text workflow.\nI do have more specific questions, mainly around my notes in Zotero and what to do with them, but I will post them separately.",

          "description": "I am wholly unsurprised that Harold Innis (1894-1952) maintained a card index (zettelkasten) through his research life, but I am pleased to have found that his literary estate has done some work on it and published it as The Idea File of Harold Adams Innis (University of Toronto Press, 1980). The introduction seems to have some fascinating material on the form and structure as well as decisions on how they decided to present and publish it.\nFor those unaware of his work, primarily as a political economist, he wrote extensively on media and communication theory including the influential works Empire and Communications (1950) and The Bias of Communication (1951). \nWhile I appreciate the published book nature of the work, it would be quite something to have it excerpted back down to index card form as a piece of material culture to purchase and play around with. Perhaps something in honor of the coming 75th anniversary of his passing?\n(Originally published with aggregated replies at https://boffosocko.com/2023/05/25/harold-innis-the-idea-file/)",

Some of my structure and sub-hub notes have gotten large, and I find I'm looking at refactoring them. Thinking about structure note size, I'm not sure smaller is better in the age of fast search. I have a bunch of search tools/extensions that help focus link creation and finding stuff for the output side of zettelkasting. A technique I'm stealing from someone on the forums is when placing a note on a structure note to look closer at links already on the structure note for link candidates. The fact that they are placed in a particular section of a structure note means the note is surrounded by ideas that relate. Or maybe I can figure out a way to link to a section of structure notes. (I already have a method of linking to a specific place in a note but don't use it in this workflow.)\nPython programming continues to be exciting, and having a large collection of notes as a playground has been fruitful. I've expanded \"Idea Explorer\" to provide more information about a note thread. It now has tabs for the \"Tag Map\" and a tab with all the one-sentence summaries of the notes listed together.  I continue to work with trending for my ZK dashboard. Part of which is behind \"My Ten-day Zettel Production.\"\nOnce again, writing precedes my thinking.\n\nMy ten-day zettel production.",

After the one-time software installation, the writer begins each document with a Markdown template. The Markdown template includes some LaTeX macros for page formatting--Prof Chappell recommends installing the MikTeX LaTeX distribution. Modifying the Pandoc LaTeX template is unnecessary (though I have done this to avoid repetition): add LaTeX packages and macros to the Markdown document template as needed.\nThe setup is interesting and will get you part of the way to a Zettelkasten with VSCode.
