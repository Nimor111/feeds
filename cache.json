          "description": "I'm looking into sequences. I start with the typically obtuse Wikipedia page on sequences here, then I try to imagine how all this might look in Haskell. I want to stay away from series for the time being, i.e., keep them separate.\n Here's one Haskell sequence (with a bit of example here), and here's another. These seem to be completely different. I'm looking at Tom Apostol's Calculus and his short bit on sequences, also SICP, and both have examples of limits of sequences, i.e., long sequences. This seems to be about streams, so I'm guessing the second Data.Containers.Sequence is more germane?\n Somewhere I found this:\n A geometric sequence (or progression) is a sequence of elements from an ordered,numeric type (i.e., a member of both classes Ord and Num) such that consecutive elements have a fixed ratio.\n geometric :: (Ord a, Num a) => a -> a -> a -> [a] geometric r m n | m > n = [] | otherwise = m : geometric r (m*r) n \n So this isn't trying to be fancy at all, it's just using lists. But then this talks about Cauchy sequences\n data Real = Cauchy { modulus :: Nat -> Nat , sequence :: Nat -> Rational } \n So this isn't list-land anymore, although I don't know what it is for or how to use it. If anyone has any wisdom or tips or insights, I'd appreciate. In general, I find the world of Haskell and numerical analysis very fragmented, hit-and-miss, like a scavenger hunt. It seems Haskell can bring a lot to the numerical analysis table, though.\n    submitted by    /u/teilchen010  \n [link]   [comments]",

How can this be, when the lambda might capture some aspects of its environment? I'd imagine a regular function is just a pointer, like in other languages, but that can't be all it is. Do lambdas dynamically allocate space for their captures, and store a pointer with the function objects, so that every function is really a function pointer plus a capture pointer, which would be null in the case of non-capturing functions? Am I wrong to even think of Haskell objects in terms of physical memory?\n    submitted by    /u/i_lack_chromosomes  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello, I may have an opportunity coming up to drive more FP adoption at work and I am particularly interested in showing how ZIO can help us be more productive and avoid entire classes of bugs I have seen pop up often (e.g., resource leaks and OOMs). \n A big question I foresee being asked is what happens if there is a bug in the runtime engine. ZIO is still quite new and changing fast. Someone posted a video of a bug they found in Cats Effect 3 related to memory that I can't find right now but that is to say it's possible for there to be bugs in the runtime engine itself. It would be a legitimate question for my team to ask: what happens if there is a bug in the core of the runtime that we can't architect around? Is there a risk that we have to refactor a whole codebase in the future out of ZIO?\n Basically, how do I assure my team that it's stable enough to use in production? \n I know this question would come up (or should) with every dependency added to the codebase, but this is a big one. If you're using a third party JSON parsing library (e.g.) and encounter a serious bug, you have more options s.a. using a different library, writing a small library that only addresses your use case (or even just the use case where the dependency has the bug), architecting around it so the bug is not on the execution path anymore, or forking the library and fixing it if you can. With a library like ZIO where the whole app runs on top of it, you may have no choice but refactor the whole thing.\n    submitted by    /u/crpleasethanks  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'd much prefer searching through org nodes to find the file I need (typically PDFs or saved HTML files, in my case).\n However, I've found the default ID generation a bit strange. I realize I can use relative directories, but it seems I would need a directory per file if I wanted only one file attached to a node. I'm just a bit hesitant to not use relative directories and continue to name my files in human-readable format since it makes me a bit more \"locked-in\" (in a sense) to org-attach, otherwise.\n So...I guess I'm just looking for ideas and inspiration.

          "description": "Hello,\n I like using bitmap fonts, they're significantly clearer to me, but they're generally pretty small. The typing latency in emacs is already pretty poor, but with small fonts it becomes almost unbearable, comparable to working over SSH.\n Originally I thought it was syntax highlighting & other plugins, but if i open emacs in the terminal it runs great... which implies it's the font rendering???\n How is the font rendering implemented?

I have a document tree with a heading for each book, and three possible todo states: TBR, Read and DNF. The document is thus structured as follows:\n * Books [X/Y] ** TBR Title 1 ** Read Title 2 ** DNF Title 3 \n The value of X is the count of how many titles below it are marked Read, while the value of Y is the count of how many values are marked either Read or TBR. DNFs don't enter into the statistics at all.\n With this document, I sometimes add new books to be read, and when I've read a book, I switch the todo status from TBR to Read. If I try the book and don't want to finish for one reason or another, I mark it DNF.\n The document is version controlled, so I can go back and see how the list has changed with time. I thought it might be fun to try and plot how the size of the list of books has changed with time, but I don't know how to automatically extract the statistics cookie for each commit.\n Any suggestions?\n    submitted by    /u/CutOnBumInBandHere9  \n [link]   [comments]",

Each update of the cursor position hence requires a full re-rendering of the pdf page, which is quite slow at high resolutions. If anyone knows of a better way to do this, that would be fantastic!\n    submitted by    /u/orgtre  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello,\nHow are you all taking reading notes? I have been using a notebook (a bit smaller than A5 size) to take mine. Usually I jot down things in bullet points as I read with a text. But this has been causing some issues. The actual writing takes a bit, and can be enough to get me out of the flow of reading. This usually leads to frustration as I try to write as fast as I am thinking, resulting in a barely legible scrawl. Either that or I take very few notes as I try to stay engaged with the reading material So, I wonder, am I taking notes too often? Should I wait until I am done with a certain section before jotting down ideas? The mental block I have there is that I will forget what I wanted to write down by the time I get to a stopping point.\nMaybe it is not the frequency of notes, but the medium. Or maybe both. I have tried using a computer, and that does help with speed somewhat. However, that works best with digital texts, and I mostly read printed ones. Another approach I have thought of is using index cards. That does make processing later a bit easier, and you can group notes freely to see relations, but it can also get messy. What are your thoughts on using a computer for notes? Index cards?\nMy goal is to have a system where I can read fluidly while writing down things I would like to process later. How are you accomplishing this?",

Please let me know what you think.\nIf you have a Zettelkasten, you need to constantly create Zettels so it grows to give you richer connections. A day in a Zettler usually looks like this:\nCreate Zettels and make connections.\nRead sources.\nProofread Zettels.\nHowever, you need to manage the overall process so working with a Zettelkasten doesn't become all you do everyday. E.g.: In the worst case scenario, you'd spend the entire morning, afternoon, and evening creating Zettels, reading, and proofreading respectively. That gives you no time for anything else!\nThe part of the process to manage is reading time because everything else depends on it. E.g.: If you don't read, you can't create Zettels, and without Zettels, there's nothing to proofread.\nI think that we can manage reading time in the same way that we adapt the routine of short knowledge cycles:\nStart with 1 hour of reading.\nRead, create Zettels, and proofread. Keep track of the time spent on each activity.\nReflect on the overall process.\nBased on your reflection, change the time alloted for reading.\nRepeat steps 2 through 4 until you reach a point where you are satisfied with the work you do for your Zettelkasten, and don't lose time for other things in your day.",

          "description": "(new to zk)\nGiven all the discussion of how L-style ID's can be association-brittle relative to using just links, I was wondering if the following has an implementation in any digital system.\nI'd like the following:  an L-style ref to \"position-sequence\" extended to differentiate between paths through the sequence --based on context --  in which one context path may share some im/proper subset of the other.\nExample: given say \nHere we have the shared edge (xa,xb) = (1b,1ba). And indeed it would be stultifying to assume that the meaning in context2 is partially identical to context1 simply because of the shared referential sub-structure.\nQuestion: for the advocates of links only: is there a simple way to differentiate multiple referential contexts. I.e., to allow for the same edge/link to be given different meaning.\nThis could be via named links -- not just links named for their nodes, or multi-links, or some in-note context to mimic this behavior.\nDoes such a thing exist?",
