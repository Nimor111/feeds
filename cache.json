          "description": "I have used conduit a bit (not extensively, but somewhat) but I'm poking around at other streaming libraries, and I've noticed most of them design their streams much like lists, for example, in streamly, SerialT m a analogous to [a], and has the same usual Functor, Applicative and Monad instances.\n conduit on the other hand, has it's last parameter being a \"result\" type, which is NOT the output type of the stream, it's just a completely different single value. And it also seems like the conduit code suggests you just compose things with await and yield, instead of using more standard combinators like fmap, mapM and fold (although their are Conduit specific versions of things like fmap and fold which one can use).\n I feel like the conduit interface is a bit more clunky and not as \"Haskell like\". But I suspect there's a benefit of this... there's surely a reason why one would make the interface quite a bit different to what people are used to manipulating, namely lists?\n Could someone give some examples of things which work nicely in conduit but are clunky in more \"list like\" streaming libraries?\n Or are more recently developed streaming libraries just better than conduit in every way (which I find hard to believe)?\n    submitted by    /u/clinton84  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi,\n A bit of background: I come from more of a math/physics background, and got drawn into functional programming late in college, then took a compilers course in my last semester (in OCAML) and got really into it. Have a journeyman level understanding of other languages, have worked in SW for three years and counting.\n I have been making my way through the haskell MOOC (the university of Helsinki one). I stumbled on these two books which, by the accounts I have read previously, seem to go into more depth mathematically with respect to haskell. In the mean time tryng build up on C++, and learning small bits of CL here and there as well to get more perspective and be a better problem solver overrall.\n So, what I'm asking:\n From my understanding, Hutton (Programming in Haskell) is drier than Bird (Thinking Functionally With Haskell), though both are solid texts with a good backing in math (i.e. strong on the \"equational reasoning\" front EDIT: category theory is welcome too), and wanted to see if there was a consensus on either of them, or at least consolidate people's different opinions and experience between the two, especially from people who have read both. There hasn't the been most testimony comparing and contrasting the two as I've seen scouring this subreddit.\n I ask because I would rather not approach FP just as a programmer but in addition and moreso as a computer scientist instead (in the way SICP aims to teach CS book and is not simply a Scheme tutorial).\n Other books that have come on my radar (for this purpose) are: The Haskell Book (aka Haskell from First Principles) and Introduction to Computation: Haskell, Logic and Automata.\n That's about all, cheers!\n    submitted by    /u/Glittering-Escape-74  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "We are working on a project and need to both create SVGs and read our created SVGs (or also user supplied SVGs, but we can specify which SVG elemtns are allowed).\n When reading svgs we need to know which shapes are contained in the svgs (only circles and rectangles are relevant for us). If there are shapes using the svg <rect>, <circle>/<ellipse> in the file this would certainly make life easier for reading the svg.\n Mainly based on another post https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/tlvopj/looking_for_svg_library_recommendations/ I've found the following libraries that supports both reading and writing:\n  \nsvg-tree: Features both reading and writing. But reading and writing seems to not be super easy but I was able to accomplish both things as a POC. Also the documentation is almost non existent. For an easier to use writing interface I imagine that we could also use lucid-svg.\n \ndiagrams with diagrams-svg and diagrams-input: Features both reading and writing. The writing api is amazing and really well documented! And I was able to read an svg file created by the library into a Diagrams type. But I was not able to find a way how I can find out what shapes are contained in this Diagram (what circles and rectangles are there in the file?). It doesn't seem to be easily possible, as it just saves Paths in the types and also in the file? But maybe I'm wrong. Unfortunately combining the writing API of diagrams and using the svg-tree library to parse them also doesn't seem to be easily possible, as again, only paths are saved in the file.\n \n Does someone know whether this is possible using diagrams? Or does someone have any suggestions on a different library we could use to read or write an svg? (e.g. a better writing interface that will work together with svg-tree)\n Any help is greatly appreciated! Thanks in advance!\n    submitted by    /u/monaceleste_  \n [link]   [comments]",

Some concepts were definitely a bit hard to grasp at first, but after figuring them out, I was almost instantly able to see how using said concept could be more beneficial than an imperative approach. That being said, I was somewhat disappointed when I learned that Haskell is considered to be \"niche\" in the software industry and that there aren't as many jobs for it as there are for other FP langs like Scala (and of course Java), but there are certainly still a few. \n For the minority of Haskell programmers who do it for a living, what exactly do you program?

Stuck on this gem and hope to get some insight from you all:\n Context: I'm working towards a text adventure app where you put the name of the adventure in as a command line argument: `LaunchAdventure --adventure myAdventure:`.\n This works:\n -- #1 greet :: AdventureOptions -> IO () greet (AdventureOptions a ) = putStrLn $ \"You chose: '\" ++ a ++ \"'.\" main :: IO () main = (greet =<< parse) >> putStrLn \"And just for testing\" \n Where parse is of type parse :: IO AdventureOptions (I'm using the optparse-applicative package as part of this experiment).\n What I want to do is to see if I can get rid of thegreet function completely. I've cobbled a few attempts together like these:\n -- #2 main = \\a -> putStrLn $ \"You chose: '\" ++ a ++ \"'.\" =<< parse -- or this messy attempt: -- #3 main = \\a -> parse >>= putStrLn $ \"You chose: '\" ++ (a :: AdventureOptions) ++ \"'.\" \n But I keep running into errors like \"Couldn't match expected type ‚Äò[Char]‚Äô with actual type ‚ÄòAdventureOptions‚Äô\" (with regards to a) or worse. I get what the error is saying; what I can't figure out is how to solve it inline.\n The working greet example (#1) has the function declaration of greet :: AdventureOptions -> IO () so I gather that that is how the compiler is inferring things there. How does one indicate that type in an inline fashion?\n Is \"casting\" a to AdventureOptions a possibility in some way? I know I've seen documentation regarding in-line type syntax, but can't find a solid example that is applicable here. And is a lambda even the right thing to attempt here at all?\n    submitted by    /u/KopperThoughts  \n [link]   [comments]",

Implementing interfaces/typeclasses for some types for certain transformations to be applicable on those types and then getting these other auto-derived transformations for the type so seamlessly is mind-blowing. And then the main recipe is this whole abstraction for the parser itself which is wrapped in generic parser type that as I understand allows for seamless composition and maybe... better semantic meaning or something?\n Now the problem is though I understand at least some of the design abstractions for this specific problem (and still learning functions like *> and <* which still trip me), I dont get how to scale this skill to spot these clever abstractions in other problems and especially how to use typeclasses.

I have found a quite simple universal lambda term which does the job.\n I have documented the construction of a universal lambda term in this paper.\n It gives a short introduction to lambda calculus. Then it introduces a programming notation for lambda calculus similar to Haskell/Ocaml in order to make lambda calculus more readable for functional programmers.\n In this notation some basic functions for booleans, pairs, numbers and optional values are introduced.\n In order to encode lambda terms the usual G√∂del numbering has been avoided. Instead of G√∂del numbers the basic idea of algebraic data types has been used.\n Based on the structure of an encoded lambda term, a lambda term is constructed which reduces an encoded lambda term to normal form or loops infinitely in case no normal form exists.\n    submitted by    /u/hbrandl  \n [link]   [comments]",

A lot has changed in Cabal and GHC in the last few versions.\n Any help would be really appreciated. A lot of people in aerospace and at NASA use Mac, so this would be really helpful to increase adoption of Copilot.\n If someone more knowledgeable than me can help, you can find a bit more info in this discussion: https://github.com/Copilot-Language/copilot/discussions/537\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/ivanpd  \n [link]   [comments]",

While those were great books, I still don't feel confident about writing entire projects in fp scala.

Are there any resources (books preferably) which teach, in a practical way, to write a server or a web api or any large project in a functional way? For beginner fper. Most of the videos on YT assume a high working knowledge of fp in scala already. I can write things in oop way in scala (tranlating code from python), however I would love to learn functional style.

          "description": "I don't want to revisit the flame wars about optional braces. I respect people who don't like using braceless syntax but I personally love using it in Scala 3.\n My question is, Is there any scala syntax that allows you to pass multiple parameters to method calls without having to use open and close parantheses? This would be extremely useful in libraries such as the extremely practical lihaoyi's scalatags. For example. Instead of:\n  body( div( h1(id:=\"title\", \"This is a title\"), p(\"This is a big paragraph of text\")` ) ) \n If there is some syntax which denotes the indented lines are parameters, maybe something like\n  body ~ div ~ h1(id := \"title\", \"This is a title\") p(\"This is a big paragraph of text\") \n In this case the ~ indicates that the following indented region is a set of parameters, so we don't even have put commas after each parameter.\n I haven't thought through this completely, so there might be flaws in this approach, but till now I haven't been able to think of big issues except for ~ probably being used in some libraries already.\n    submitted by    /u/realmagadheera  \n [link]   [comments]",

I needed to come up with a more efficient system, so after thinking about it for a while I came to the realization that the only new information in my notes would be of the following type:\n  \nExplaining a certain step of a derivation in more detail. (by adding more steps)\n Adding additional information that was relevant. (an alternate explanation or my own explanation)\n Connecting the given information with some other piece of information. (like how you link stuff in Obsidian)\n  \nThat's how I came to the realization that if I could have like the comment feature that you usually have in word, but with more obsidian features for pdfs then that would be a game changer. For example, being able to upload a textbook to obsidian, then highlight a word/sentence or para (or the space in the between them) and then be able to write comments on it (both in Latex and normal text) or to be able to link that with other notes.\n I would be extremely grateful if somebody could let me know if there is a way to implement these features.\n Thnx!\n    submitted by    /u/Mental-Repair-6141  \n [link]   [comments]",

I keep my files on a shared google drive, I've also connected it to org-mobile on my phone and generally it works ok, I'm quite happy with it.\n However, I recently read a book about building a second brain and decided to tidy up the system a bit. While writing or linking notes is not a problem, I probably don't understand the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãtags/properties or I have something set up wrong with the search. No matter how I set tags in my notes, I can't search for them. It looks a bit like the search only works in a few files that I have in my org-agenda-files(and even then not always) and nowhere else.\n I want to be able to search for topics, e.g. by tags in my entire \"second brain\" without adding them all to my agenda. I'm just afraid that soon I'll have dozens (hundreds?) of files and emacs will take half an hour to start. What's the best way to do it?\n P.S.

          "description": "I was playing aroung with org-attach features lately, and stumbled upon something that looked weird to me. When using the uuid method to create attachment folders, orgmode uses the first two characters of the uuid to create a first folder, then the rest of the ID to create the actual attachment folder. It fails if using a uuid of less than 2 characters as far as I could test.\n It is not obvious to the eyes, a bit like a phishing site, I noticed it while deleting all attachments on a node, Emacs yes/no prompted me if I wanted to use recursive deletion. I was surprised because I understood that the 'uuid' method was supposed to store attachments in a flat directory structure named after the node's UUID, under the `org-attach-id-dir` directory.\n At first, I thought it was a bug (most probably in my config as always), but I could track down the process to this function in charge to generate the folder name:\n (defun org-attach-id-uuid-folder-format (id) \"Translate an UUID ID into a folder-path. Default format for how Org translates ID properties to a path for attachments. Useful if ID is generated with UUID.\" (and (< 2 (length id)) (format \"%s/%s\" (substring id 0 2) (substring id 2)))) \n Looking at this function, the bug theorydoes not stand as it looks very intentional on the developers part. So I am wondering why it was built like that.\n It does not impair the attachment functionalities at all, everything I tested works fine, but first I am curious, and second the way I found out about it bothers me. I wonder if multiple nodes were to share the same first two UUID characters, would they all get their attachment folders deleted by a recursive deletion meant for only one of them ? If yes, I think that would qualify as a bug with data loss on top of that.\n The docstring does not help me understand its purpose any better, so I thought I'd ask.\n    submitted by    /u/fred982  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have to hold Ctrl for a split-second, then g for it to work.\n Oddly this is only an issue if I'm focused on a buffer with display-line-numbers-mode on. If I turn it off, the problem goes away.\n This also only affects my Moonlander, a QMK keyboard. I tried using a standard keyboard and it was fine.\n I checked wevand the only difference is that the Moonlander registers the g input immediately (1 ms) after Ctrl, whereas the standard keyboard registered it around 100ms after.\n Is there a reason why keyboard-quit would not work if the interval between Ctrl and g is too short indisplay-line-numbers-mode? Is it because a keystroke will trigger some sort of background process or refresh - and that's the process I'm quitting with C-g if I do it too quickly?\n Thanks in advance if anyone has any ideas.\n    submitted by    /u/barnaclesaretasty  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "After receiving some great feedback from the Neovim community on a comparison I made between Emacs and Neovim, and later also a bunch of encouragement words talking about this idea on both r/neovim and r/emacs, I've been inspired to create something new*:\n Emacs-Kick ‚Äî a lightweight, beginner-friendly Emacs configuration inspired by kickstart.nvim\n  \nGithub: https://github.com/LionyxML/emacs-kick\n  \nhttps://preview.redd.it/kg1oei01artd1.png?width=1239&format=png&auto=webp&s=1ad6022340c96739e2bb79a24dcb1979a4657a60\n What Makes Emacs-Kick Special?\n While there are many Emacs kickstarter configs out there, Emacs-Kick is focused on providing a simple and accessible setup for Neovim users who are curious about Emacs, without asking them to fully dive into the Emacs way of doing things.\n Key Features:\n  \nTerminal-first: No need for a GUI. Works seamlessly with tmux, zellij, lazygit, starship, and other terminal tools.\n Vim bindings by default: For a smooth transition from Neovim.\n Pre-configured Treesitter and LSP: Get up and running quickly with modern code features.\n Simple defaults inspired by kickstart.nvim: Familiar setup to help ease the learning curve.\n  \nThe goal of Emacs-Kick is not to replace Neovim but to act as a secondary tool that you can experiment with. Whether you're interested in trying out Emacs' unique features or just want to see what all the fuss is about, Emacs-Kick makes it easy to explore without being overwhelmed by complex setups like Doom or Spacemacs.\n I‚Äôm excited to share it with the community‚Äîfeel free to try it out and reach out with any feedback or questions on GitHub. Let‚Äôs build something great together!\n    submitted by    /u/LionyxML  \n [link]   [comments]",

I desired to squash the commits and rebase my feature onto the current tip of master to stay updated.\n Here's what I did:\n  \nI switched to master, and made sure to pull the local branch to the tip.\n \nI switched to my working branch, and made sure the origin was pushed and up to date with the current commit level, and stashed the current modified files.\n I performed a rebase onto branch with r b and selected the local master branch.\n I rewrote the commit for the first commit of the series and squashed the rest.\n‚Ä¶",

          "description": "Recently someone asked about filling (aka wrapping) text within columns. It's a useful feature, so I added it to the simple package speedrect, which implements a little modal interface that comes alive during rectangle-selection mode.\n Just highlight a rectangular region of text (C-M-mouse-1 works great, or C-x SPACE then move), and hit f to wrap. The wrap width defaults to the rectangle's width (e.g. to expand an existing wrapped block). Otherwise, use a numeric prefix (e.g. M-20 f) or regular prefix (C-u f) to prompt for the width. The selected rectangle's height sets the height of the safe fill region (usually extending down to the next distinct \"row\" of data). If the newly filled text exceeds this height, additional lines are added below.\n speedrect has lots of other useful features for moving rectangles around, operating on them, and sending them back and forth to calc. To use it, just select a rectangle...\n    submitted by    /u/JDRiverRun  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "What is Aider\n Aider is an AI pair programming tool in the terminal. It allows you to pair program with large language models (LLMs) to edit code in your local Git repository. You can start a new project or work with an existing Git repo. Aider works best with GPT-4 or Claude 3.5 Sonnet and can connect to almost any LLM. The GitHub page for Aider is GitHub - Aider-AI/aider: aider is AI pair programming in your terminal, and the project currently has nearly 20k stars.\n Aider has performed well in solving real coding problems on SWE-bench.\n Introducing Aider.el\n Recently, the Cursor editor has been gaining popularity. As a long-time Emacs user, I don't want to switch to Cursor just because of AI. Currently, Aider only has plugins for Vim and VSCode, but Emacs has a tradition of integrating command-line tools. So I decided to write my own, as a humble attempt: GitHub - tninja/aider.el: aider emacs plugin forhttps://github.com/paul-gauthier/aider.\n This plugin offers the following advantages over using Aider directly from the command line:\n  \nPop-up menu: No need to remember commands. (aider-transient-menu)\n Git repository-specific Aider sessions in Emacs: It automatically identifies the Git repository of the current file and creates a new Aider session for it. Multiple Aider sessions can exist for different Git repositories, allowing you to work on several repositories simultaneously without interference.\n Region-based refactor support: You can select a region (e.g., a code block) in a file and ask Aider to refactor it.\n  \nIn fact, most of this plugin itself was generated using Aider / aider.el.\n If you're interested in AI-assisted programming and, like me, prefer not to leave the Emacs environment, perhaps you could give Aider and aider.el a try. I would appreciate any feedback or suggestions you have about aider.el. Thank you!\n    submitted by    /u/Sad_Construction_773  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Let me paint a picture for you all: I do some technical writing using org-mode (mostly papers on computer science), but I must confess I got a terrible spelling, both in my mother tongue and English, so spell checking is a must to everything I do. \n I used to use flyspell + enchant, but it would cause severe lag (I tend to write hole documents in one file), so I have changed to jinx, and it's amazing in terms of performance. One thing I think I could upgrade in my workflow, is that the suggestions are too far off the real word I mean, even thought the error is somewhat minor, most of the words I don't even know existed! \n On the other hand, I also have ltex installed, and its suggestions are 99% of the time on point, but it comes at the cost of only updating when I save the buffer and being somewhat slow. So to do a final pass is great, but to spell check while writing is impossible.\n One other thing I have seen in the past but never got my head around doing was using dabbrev to fix recurring mistakes, but I don't think this would solve the problem. Another (crazy) idea is to use some small LLM to better predict the word based on context, but if LanguageTool can do it without it (I think), is there any other way?\n So, anyone have tackled those difficulties?

The main focus is to offer a simple, Neovim-user friendly setup for those who are curious about Emacs, without asking them to fully transition or embrace the entire \"Emacs way\" of doing things.\n Some key features:\n  \nNo need for GUI, making it tmux, zellij, lazygit, starship, and terminal tool friendly\n Vim bindings as default\n Treesitter and LSP pre-configured\n Simple defaults based on kickstart.nvim for familiarity\n  \nThe idea is for Emacs to act as a secondary tool, not as a replacement for Neovim, so users can experiment and explore Emacs without feeling overwhelmed by setups like Doom or Spacemacs.\n The project is almost ready, and I‚Äôd love to get feedback from the Emacs community. This could also be a helpful entry point for Neovim users who want to dip their toes into Emacs without too much complexity.\n If anyone would be interested in testing it or offering feedback, I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts!\n Wish me luck over at r/neovim üòä\n A preview: \n https://preview.redd.it/jhhn5wfhqssd1.png?width=1239&format=png&auto=webp&s=4a47ec15ecad880bad5e381cb40732b2cc90c42f\n    submitted by    /u/LionyxML  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Doing academic research, I often have cases where I want to reference, for example, a specific chapter from a book (like collective works, or collected essays from one author). I create these as individual items in my library (exported as bibtex by Zotero/better bibtex but I don't think that is important). I would like to be able to keep the notes for these chapters connected to the source book, but I can't figure out how to get citar-open-notes to recognise this. Calling citar-open-notes for a new library item creates a new org file with the appropirate metadata (including roam-refs) and the citekey as the filename; this is fine default behaviour, but I'd like it to first check if the citekey already exists as a roam_refs property in another file before creating a new one.\n Can I get it to do this somehow?

It provides a simple and lightweight way to access the web from within the Emacs environment. EWW was originally written by Lars Ingebrigtsen and is now maintained by the GNU Emacs project.\n One of the key features of EWW is its ability to display web pages inline, without requiring an external browser. This is achieved through the use of an HTML renderer, shr.el, which renders HTML pages directly within the Emacs buffer. EWW also supports viewing PDFs inline, using the doc-view-mode, and can be customized using the mailcap mechanism.\n EWW has several unique features that set it apart from other web browsers. It can display images inline, if Emacs was built with image support, and can block specific images completely by customizing shr-blocked-images. Additionally, EWW uses the colors declared in the HTML page, but adjusts them if needed to maintain a certain minimum contrast.\n Users can interact with EWW using a variety of commands, including eww-copy-page-url to copy the URL of the current page into the kill ring, and eww-bookmark-kill to delete bookmarks. EWW also provides a buffer for managing bookmarks, which can be accessed using M-x eww-bookmarks.\n EWW is highly customizable, with many variables and options available for tweaking its behavior. For example, the eww-history-limit variable controls the number of history entries kept, and can be set to nil to allow the history list to grow indefinitely. Additionally, users can customize image display using shr-inhibit-images and shr-blocked-images.\n Overall, Emacs EWW provides a convenient and flexible way to access the web from within Emacs, making it an attractive option for developers and power users who value the integration and customization offered by the Emacs environment.\n    submitted by    /u/epiphanicalDeduction  \n [link]   [comments]",

It turned out that a lot of it was less task-oriented and more introspective: things about my future, things about how I should engage with parts of the world, and so forth. The only \"next action\" I could get for these was to journal about it.\n Now, I'm attempting to determine how I should organize journal-notes like these. I think extracting parts of my introspective writing into its own note, and linking those notes together would have value to me (I don't particularly think I'd want to duplicate a full-on Zettelkasten system, but parts of it seem useful to pick up). But I don't really know. A lot of the systems I've read about are either about explicit actionability (GTD, PARA...) or about synthesizing sources and finding interesting connections (Zettelkasten). Is there anything for structured introspection? does anyone do that, and what does your system look like?\n    submitted by    /u/ValuableBuffalo  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hey folks!\n I just hacked together a clone of Python's instructor library and I'm looking for early feedback. That library makes using LLMs programmatically very convenient and it seems elisp would benefit from that.\n The core of what Instructor does is allow coders to define a class in Python and then to use that class to define the function-calling / JSON structured output of the LLM as well as instantiate that class based on the response of the LLM. So I tried to replicate this with defstructs as I could.\n Here's the link to the repo (obviously it's called instructor.el). It's fewer than 100 lines of code at the moment. https://github.com/Trevoke/instructor.el\n And the basic usage pattern looks like this:\n (setq llm (make-llm-ollama :chat-model \"llama3.1\")) ;; for valid types see the help for `make-llm-function-arg' and look at the type. (instructor-defstruct dnd-character (name nil :type string :description \"The character's name\") (class nil :type string :description \"The character's class\") (race nil :type string :description \"The character's race in the D&D setting\") (skills nil :type (list string) :description \"The skills the character has\")) (instructor-call :llm llm :type 'dnd-character :prompt \"Make a starter character for D&D 5th edition.\") ;; (#s(dnd-character :name \"Eilif Stonefist\" :class \"Fighter\" :race \"Human\" :skills ;; [\"Acrobatics\" \"Athletics\"])) \n    submitted by    /u/Trevoke  \n [link]   [comments]",

I didn't structure it this way, it's something provided to me. In any event I think I have all the submodules fetched, however I'm getting a strange reaction from magit on this last one I know about.\n In this directory, at the command line if I issue git status it comes back with information about the version controlled module. It's in a detached HEAD state, but that's alright for the moment. Basically it reports just fine.\n If I am in magit, and I start at the top, and then open submodules on the way down, when I get to this submodule it says \"Corrupt Git configuration\". I find this puzzling since Git status seems to work.\n Any ideas on what is going on here?

I really don‚Äôt have much time to keep switching between editors, so I‚Äôm looking for something I can stick with long-term.\n Here‚Äôs some context:\n  \nI type at around 150 WPM, so I want something fast and efficient.\n I‚Äôve been using both Neovim and Emacs for about two months, and I‚Äôm comfortable with the keybindings of both.\n I like Neovim because it feels simpler and more straightforward, which is great since I‚Äôm learning a lot of new things (programming, using i3wm, etc.).\n However, Emacs is appealing because it seems to be this all-in-one tool where you can do everything from text editing to managing your entire workflow. Plus, I have to admit, using Emacs makes me feel a bit superior, like it‚Äôs a ‚Äúpower user‚Äù tool, which makes my decision even harder.\n  \nOne important thing: I also want to focus on building actual projects rather than spending too much time customizing my editor. Neovim feels more minimal, which might help me stay focused, but at the same time, I wonder if I‚Äôd be missing out on something Emacs offers, like Org mode for note-taking, which I‚Äôve heard is amazing.\n Ultimately, I want to commit to one text editor for life. I don‚Äôt want to spend months switching between them or tweaking configurations. My goal is to focus on programming, taking notes, and building real projects‚Äîwithout getting too distracted by endlessly customizing my editor.\n So, should I stick with Neovim and its simplicity, or is it worth diving into Emacs for its extra features and potential? I‚Äôd really appreciate your advice, especially from anyone who‚Äôs been in a similar position.\n Thanks in advance for your help!\n    submitted by    /u/Icy-Wrap-4410  \n [link]   [comments]",

I implemented some enhancements that someone else kindly shared on the web.\n However, I noticed that there is no customization or command for discovering projects recursively.

I'm running a recent self-built emacs off master.\n When I edit my .bashrc, I use eglot with a bash lsp server. Eglot (or something called from it, maybe in project.el?) thinks everything in $HOME should be managed by this server, and runs a giant find . command, which eventually times out and restarts the LSP server endlessly.\n A possible solution to this is to tell emacs that my dotfiles are in an opt-in project that only contains those dotfiles, nothing else. (I'd rather not have to put all my other dirs under ~ into some ignore list -- that's why yadm is so nice, because it's opt-in, not opt-out.) If I could teach emacs that the dotfiles are backed by the actual bare git repo, that would be even nicer, but mostly I just want to avoid eglot trying to manage my whole home dir.\n Any advice?

That's when I find out about that https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam-ui do not work (Node.js version Node.js v20.13.1, ‚ñ≤ Next.js 14.2.12) anymore. I think it still works on lower version of node.\n The package still works now for me as emacs doesn't build it and just use the prebuilt one(2 years old) included in the git repo.\n There's 2 main things I found out about it:\n  \nMost of them on https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam-ui/forks don't build now (on my setup) for the above reason. They have identical next.config.js. I don't know how to fix it (so it build on my setup, which involves editing next.config.js and possibly the project to adapt for node20), so if someone knows please comment. I think it still build with node.js v12 because in odomanov's fork, the build 3 months ago went through and that one's using github action https://github.com/actions/setup-node/releases/tag/v2 which appears to use node12.\n \nhttps://github.com/odomanov/org-roam-ui have built some interesting thing called \"desk\" similar to https://github.com/cpbotha/org-roam-canvas 's effect. the latter uses obsidian's graph and emacs to make html, odomanov on the other hand made something like this:\n \n click on the \\\"open desk\\\" button\n will open this \\\"desk\\\" where you can have small snippet of node's html previews to drag around\n and on a side note 3. That's all there is. the only other works on org-roam-ui I'm aware of is https://github.com/ikoamu/publish-org-roam-ui (which builds on https://github.com/uncomfyhalomacro 's fork) which replaces the websocket communication to emacs to get org-roam-nodes with a js stub thus made org-roam-ui static. \n    submitted by    /u/HermanHel  \n [link]   [comments]",

Right now I'm only covering the few languages I've been working with lately, but I'm interested in expanding the approach further so it covers multiple languages and is easy to adapt.\n A few questions:\n  \nam I re-inventing the wheel? Is there already a package that provides this feature? The only similar one I found in package-list-packages is ll-debug, which seems simple but also not actively maintained, and adding modes to it isn't super intuitive\n if no to the above questions: is this something people would be interested in? Ideally this package would be: simple to setup with minimal overhead, easy to customize and to add support for new languages. I can't guarantee it will be ready soon, but I'm already working on it for my own workflows, so it's in the early stages (unless I find a better approach: see questions above and below)\n I'm curious what approach to debugging you all use: am I making a mistake by keeping things so simple? what are some more complex debugging capabilities, and are there ways to run these in a way that is consistent across languages (like the debug-print approach)?\n  \n   submitted by    /u/andyjda  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi everybody,\n If your org-roam database is large, chances are you are waiting more than 1 second for org-roam-find-node to show candidates.\n This is a package that improves the performance of org-roam-find-node. It runs between 4-10 times faster, while maintaining total compatibility. In fact, you can enable/disable the package without any adverse effects.\n The package also extends the org-speed-commands with a hydra, accessible with the letter m. Only two commands are accesible: org-roam-refile and org-roam-extract-subtree (open an issue if you would like to see other commands).\n The only potential issue is if you use a custom template. One of the areas where org-roam spends a lot of time is formatting the template. To reduce this time the template can be a function (which is much faster than processing the template string). The template function provided in the package should be good enough for most users, but adding a new template function is easy. See code for details.\n It is a minor mode, so to enable and disable simply run org-roam-gt-mode\n https://github.com/dmgerman/org-roam-gt\n if somebody can point me to information on how to upload it to a repo of packages, I'll do that. In the meantime, download it from github.\n    submitted by    /u/dm_g  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Since installing Emacs 31, I noticed a strange issue: if I try to look at the documentation of pcase, Emacs becomes very, very slow. It takes a few seconds to a) show the result in Vertico and b) open the documentation. Even evaluating (describe-function 'pcase) is extremely slow. I discovered that, for some reason, not loading lsp-mode and related packages improves the issue. I've also tried disabling and sequentially re-enabling packages from my config but couldn't find the culprit. To do that, I tried to put my config in a catch statement (to stop the execution at a certain point), like this:\n (catch 'my-exit ;; I want to execute this (throw 'my-exit \"Stop here\") ;; I don't want to execute this ) \n I'm pretty sure that what I did there is probably stupid, but I'm not an Elisp expert. Anyway, after putting all my config in the catch-throw statement (even with the throw as the last line), I couldn't reproduce the bug.\n I initially experienced the (describe-function 'pcase) bug on macOS and thought that this was in some way OS-specific, but I compiled Emacs 31+ on my Linux machine today and the same thing happens.\n At this point, I'm just very curious about what is happening. If someone has a clue, I'd appreciate it!\n    submitted by    /u/kofm  \n [link]   [comments]",

If you prefer a clean environment, you may want to manage this manually.\n \n \n Improved synchronization mechanism for overview files, preventing multiple overview files from being created for the same source file. Also improved the robustness and stability of this feature. \n A hash table is now used to map source files to overview files. One great thing is that you don‚Äôt need to manually set the hash table file location.\n The overview file header now includes a new property block: #+SOURCE-FILE: to confirm the mapping.\n New commands: \n org-zettel-ref-check-and-repair-links - Check and repair links between source files and overview files.\n org-zettel-ref-maintenance-menu - Display a menu for org-zettel-ref-mode maintenance operations.\n org-zettel-ref-refresh-index - Manually refresh the overview index.\n org-zettel-ref-rescan-overview-files - Rescan the overview directory and update the index.\n org-zettel-ref-status - Display the current status of org-zettel-ref-mode.\n \n \n  \nCheck on Github: https://github.com/yibie/org-zettel-ref-mode\n If you like, start it!\n    submitted by    /u/yibie  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Running into a weird issue with a recent upgrade. So I upgraded from emacs 26 to emacs 28.1 on Ubuntu. Normally, I operate emacs in terminal mode (emacs --daemon, emacsclient -t) using Terminal.app from MacOSX.\n Problem I'm having is that as of this upgrade, I can no longer paste text into a terminal buffer in char mode. If I cmd-C \"hi\" and Cmd-v it in a buffer in `term-mode` in character mode, the console just freezes up (i.e. all further keys aren't doing anything, I can't C-x b to get to another buffer, etc.). I have to Ctrl-G to get back control.\n My lossage output looks like\n ESC [ 2 0 0 ~ h i ESC [ 2 0 1 ~\n Which is what I'd generally expect with terminal shenanigans, and lossage confirms that it invokes `term--xterm-paste`. So I tried manually invoking term--xterm-paste and, yep, that freezes up the console too.\n Invoking help on term--xterm-paste doesn't give any obvious hints, and it's a compiled C function so now I'm at a bit of a dead-end. Any suggestions for how to debug this further would be much appreciated!\n ETA: confirmed issue is happening with an `emacs -Q` run and `M-x term` running /bin/bash, so I don't think it's my configuration (at least, not my emacs configuration).\n    submitted by    /u/fixermark  \n [link]   [comments]",

I believe it's time for another rewrite. I was brainstorming about some of the features this so-called rewrite needs: 1. Client-Server Architecture: Although Emacs has a client mode, it's not meant to use with a server on another computer. 2. GPU Acceleration: This is the new cool trend. :) 3. Safe Multithreading: While Elisp provides facilities for multithreading, they're practically useless because there is no grantee for a thread to give the process back. 4. Proper GUI Library: And better mouse support. It's also impossible to write good GUI code for Emacs due to threading issues. 5. Image-based: This is also cool. Imagine installing an Emacs distribution just by installing an image. 6. Elisp Support: We need to keep it backwards compatible.\n Please share your thoughts.

Once the system gets bloated, I start over with the best intentions, trying to keep things simple.

I used to record notes, which are automatically transcribed, but now I have hundreds or even thousands of transcriptions that are effectively meaningless. I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôll do with them, so they just pile up, collecting, not connecting.\nIf I try to organize them, that creates friction, and after a valiant effort, things get out of hand. There are too many notes and too many ways to link them, and many are just the same idea phrased differently.\nEven with proper linkages, at some point, 200 notes on a topic become clutter, and there‚Äôs no way to distill it when I need it.\nSometimes I feel like all this effort to manually do what my brain cannot is futile. If I‚Äôm writing something and want to reference a topic, I get overwhelmed by too much information.\nShould I stop trying, or is there a method that can help someone like me?\nI was excited about AI in Obsidian or Notion, but the results were inaccurate or incomplete (e.g., ‚Äúshow me all my notes on a topic‚Äù or ‚Äúhow many notes do I have?‚Äù give partial results).

I‚Äôve developed an Ansible playbook that automates the setup of Raspberry Pis, including tools that could enhance your note-taking and text-processing environments.\nWhat‚Äôs Included:\nNetwork Configuration: Easily set up Wi-Fi networks, access points, and even USB gadget mode for Raspberry Pi.\nText Processing Tools: Install tools like Pandoc and TexLive, essential for converting notes. There's also a role for my Zettel Composer tool.\nEmacs Environment: If you work with Emacs, the playbook can build it from source and set up Spacemacs with integrated tmux.\nAncient Greek Texts: For anyone working with classical languages, there‚Äôs a setup for Diogenes with Thesaurus Linguae Graecae (TLG) data.\nSeafile Client and Sync Notifications: You can configure Seafile for seamless syncing of notes across devices and set up sync notifications to stay updated on changes.\nIf you‚Äôve got a Raspberry Pi or a whole fleet of them, this playbook should help you get everything up and running quickly. It‚Äôs especially handy if you like to experiment with different setups or need consistency across multiple devices.\nYou can find the playbook here.\nEnjoy!",

I recently used them to get over a big hump.\nI was trying to learn something specific in programming. It is a huge library, and although I am a fluent programmer (having programmed everyday for the last two decades), I was resisiting this.\nWhat helped me over the hump was a combination of my Zk with Anki, a free flashcard system, which does spaced repetition. I think I now know the library I wanted to master really well: the size is what had been a hinderance and no longer seems to be. I made around 200 cards, and I know them inside out now.\nLong term, of course, it is the zettelkasten that will help me with the big picture.

It really meets all my needs, it's amazing!\nHowever I have never used IDs for my notes, but used the title directly; so all the links in my notes are like this: [[note-title]]. I know that Sublimeless ZK works with IDs so I added to all my notes an ID before the file name according to their creation date so that I could see them in the application.\nThe problem is in the links inside the notes (those I don't plan to change because they are exaggeratedly too many xd).\nI already read the README on GitHub of the application, but I understand little or almost no code, so my question is: \nAn apology if the question is very naive but I really loved Rene's app and would love to use it as soon as possible with my existing notes.\nBest regards and thanks for reading,\nAntonio",
