          "description": "Hello everyone! I've got some exciting news to share.\n Earlier this year, I've released the first version of HVM, a massively parallel functional runtime that aims to be the ultimate target for pure functional languages like Haskell, Elm, Kind and many others, and finally unleash the inherent parallelism of the functional paradigm. HVM's first version was very limited; it could only parallelize algorithms that recursed in a perfect binary tree fashion, it lacked IO and had some synchronization bugs. Soon, we'll be releasing an updated version, which fixes these bugs, includes IO primitives, and a new workstealing-based scheduler, which is capable of generalizing to basically any functional program that isn't inherently sequential. For example, it can use all cores on the computation of Fib(n), achieving maximal performance!\n The most exciting news, though, is that a GPU runtime is on the works. I've just, right now, finished the very initial prototype, a self-contained, 1200-LOC file that evaluates a busy recursive function on the GPU. It is performing about 680 million rewrites/second on 4096 cores of my Laptop RTX 3080. That's 4x more than single-thread performance, on the very first attempt of the very first prototype. I believe we'll soon be reaching record benchmarks on GPUs. Several API improvements and stability features will also be included on the upcoming update.\n We're ahead of very exiting times for functional programming, and I hope this encourages language developers to target the HVM! Imagine a working STG->HVM compiler? We're also interested in hiring a CUDA professional to help us profile and improve the GPU back-end. If you know someone who'd be interested, please let me know via DM! And be welcome to visit our Discord community and ask anything on the #HVM channel.\n    submitted by    /u/SrPeixinho  \n [link]   [comments]",

Actually maybe I'm just reinventing some existing wheel, but I've never seen it used.\n For example:\n class Encoding a where encode :: a -> String \n Now I have to do:\n instance Encoding (a, b) where encode (a, b) = encode a <> encode b instance Encoding (a, b, c) where encode (a, b, c) = encode a <> encode b <> encode c -- and so on until the limit of either tuple size or patience is reached \n You can see code like this across endless number of libraries, including base\n Why cannot I instead have something like this:\n instance Encoding (a, b) where encode (a, b) = encode a <> encode b instance Encoding (..., b) where encode (a@..., b) = encode a <> encode b \n Never mind the specific syntax, it can be whatever, but the idea is to define instance for all tuple sizes recursively.\n Is it maybe possible already?\n That would also require (and allow) some size-polymorphic operations to add/split the first/last tuple elements, in a type safe way.\n I've no idea why it doesn't already exist.\n    submitted by    /u/epoberezkin  \n [link]   [comments]",

We're currently covering higher order functions, and our professor wants us to write a function that acts as a form of simple memory storage. Here's the part of the assignment that's stumping me:\n -- We'll consider a different way to represent memory. Memoryf is a function from variable names to values. type Memoryf = String -> Int -- The function memf1 gives all variables the value of zero memf1 = \\_ -> 0 -- The following commands use the function putValue to modify our memory function: memf2 = putValuef \"z\" 3 memf1 memf3 = putValuef \"y\" (-2) memf2 memf4 = putValuef \"x\" 1 memf3 -- putValue should take three arguments: -- 1. The name of a variable, x -- 2. The variable value m -- 3. A Memoryf function -- putValue should assign x to m and return the updated Memoryf function putValue :: String -> Int -> Memoryf -> Memoryf putValue x m memf = _________________________ -- Write your code here -- Example output: -- (putValue \"x\" 5 memf4) \"x\" -- 5 \n My thinking is that calling putValue should add something to the effect of \"if memf x is called, return m\" but I have no idea how to write this. The furthest I've gotten is:\n putValue :: String -> Int -> Memoryf -> Memoryf putValue x m memf = (\\x -> m) \n which is useless because it will return the value of m for any variable, and thus doesn't work as a store of value.\n I'd greatly appreciate any guidance y'all have to offer.

It doesn't seem a coincidence that 2 most popular languages - JavaScript and Python - make it really easy to integrate with JSON.\n - make cross-platform compilation \"manageable\" (including mobile and web), not just \"possible\".\n - solve problem of compiled binary size - it should be at least 5x, better 10x smaller – even if it comes at cost of 10x longer compilation time (so that we would only use it for production builds).\n - at the same time, make interpreted tests execution simpler - I still can't figure out how to do it, waiting for several minutes until it builds with most cores idling is very time consuming... Maybe this is a solved problem, and there is a simple answer how to do it.\n - make networking and cryptography more trustworthy - with exodus of some maintainers into Rust-land they are at risk of abandonment – I will share more comments on this subject a bit later.\n ​\n These are all issues that Haskell Foundation and community can help solving, we could chip in some time/money too if there is some concerted effort.\n    submitted by    /u/epoberezkin  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "This past month I've been working on implementing my first OOP language with Haskell .. implementing the syntax and context analysis was very easy for me because I'm very aware of the fact that we build parsers using stateful monads using one of the already available libraries (like parsec for example)... so that went easy after defining the context-free grammars that is not left-recursive, and then implementing the parsec-functions to every non-terminating symbol in the grammars... so that went easy with no hiccups... \n But after I dived into the context analysis that's where shit hit the fan.. it seemed that my programming model has either been very bad or I'm a bad software-engineer because functions started to become very ugly due to many parameters that are passed to the functions, and many other reasons that I don't how to start to explain, but in summary whatever makes haskell beautiful I managed to make it very ugly and complicated with my architecture design..\n So my question is: we already have stateful monads and parsers like parsec as an architectural model to implement the syntax analysis and context analysis. Are there also standardized models to implement the other steps in compilers like the context analysis? Is there literature that answers this question in regard to Haskell?\n Edit: while implementing the context analysis I became very aware of the fact that need zippers because I needed to be very aware ot the context of every variable and method which then I did and made the job much easier, so maybe that's part of the answer that I'm seeking?\n    submitted by    /u/Suitable_Use_2730  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I'm trying to write FFI bindings for librrd. My code can be found here: https://github.com/thomasbach-dev/hs-rrd/tree/context-bindings\n This is the first time I use FFI and I have not come very far. I can query the version of the library and do some calls to rrd_*_error which run but return empty results. So I'm not even sure I am missing something very basic here.\n This is what I observe: The tests in general run fine, until I enable the one defined here: https://github.com/thomasbach-dev/hs-rrd/blob/context-bindings/test/RRDTool/LowLevelSpec.hs#L41 which calls rrd_get_context. The tests simply crash then:\n $ cabal test --test-show-details=always Running 1 test suites... Test suite hs-rrd-test: RUNNING... Test suite hs-rrd-test: FAIL \n Started in a repl I get the following:\n ghci> :add *RRDTool.LowLevel Ok, two modules loaded. ghci> rrd_get_context cabal: repl failed for hs-rrd-0.1.0.0. The build process segfaulted (i.e. SIGSEGV). \n The code of rrd_get_context can be found here: https://github.com/oetiker/rrdtool-1.x/blob/2db8afce06e64f86133fae21b7b6b730df540293/src/rrd_thread_safe.c#L43 It basically does some calls to pthread.\n Can someone help on what to do next?\n EDIT: I looked into this a bit deeper. The problem actually does not seem to be the calls to pthread, but the way I read the rrd_context_t in Haskell (i.e. the peek). I changed my test to simply call the raw functions in C and look at the returned pointer address. That works ok and I do not get a null pointer. So I guess it has to be the peek which triggers the segmentation fault.\n This also happens when I simply call rrd_new_context which according to the C code ( https://github.com/oetiker/rrdtool-1.x/blob/2db8afce06e64f86133fae21b7b6b730df540293/src/rrd_error.c#L121) only does a malloc and then returns the pointer.\n So either the memory pointed to is already taken away from my process (not sure what the proper wording is here) or my Storable instance is broken.\n    submitted by    /u/thomasbach  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "There's a bad dynamic in America's STEM education where kids going into college computer science out of high school hit a brick wall . . . largely made of math they've never seen before. In general, CS is not at all what they thought it would be. Then they switch/flunk out. So if higher-ed physics, engineering, math has a long, gentle preparatory on-ramp in K-12 with math, comp-sci has absolutely nothing -- or maybe just some \"learn to code.\" And so I've been trying to put together a high-school-level on-ramp for real CS . And I'm basing it on Haskell. Why Haskell? Because the top-tier schools all do some sort of typed functional programming eventually. Functional seems to be the fault line between the top schools and the 2nd-tier. So for example I mix in discrete math with Haskell. You could say I'm high-school-izing the Doets, van Eijck text The Haskell Road to Logic, Maths, and Programming. Or even the Paulson ML for the Working Programmer, another fantastic book. Great, you might say. Trouble is I'm all alone -- as far as I know. For example, if you look at the AP Computer Science stuff, it's basically learn to program Java with a smattering of data structures and algorithms tacked on. Not really much help for a kid walking into Cornell or CMU. Every high school effort I've come across so far has hardly ever been more than \"learn to code,\" typically Python. So my question to you is, should I keep going -- or give it up for a bad job? Am I really on to something, or am I tilting at windmills? The fact that I'm so alone on this is ominous. I've contacted lots of big name professors -- and they're sympathetic but in the long run apathetic simply because they're awash in 96th-percentile applicants. Yeah....

I come from a math background so I thought it'd be fun to implement some theorems in abstract algebra in Haskell. From what I understand, there are classes of functions in Haskell like <> for example which represents an associative operation. What I'd really like is to implement a homomorphism type that sends f (x * y) to f(x) * f(y). The trouble I am having is that in mathematics we will always demand a proof that a map is a homomorphism before we give it its status as one. Is this not the case in Haskell? In other words, do we need to manually check that an operation is a homomorphism or is there some way for Haskell to recognize one (perhaps with a bit of assistance from the programmer/type system/something else)?\n    submitted by    /u/No_News_3567  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I've encountered a design issue several times, and I'm wondering what approach is most consistent with Haskell idioms/best practices.\n I'm implementing a data structure, call it Z a, with an interface for manipulating it where almost all of the functions in the interface return a Z a, with many of the form Z a -> Z a or b -> Z a -> Z a. But for a few of the functions there's no valid result for some edge case inputs, and it makes sense in those situations to return Maybe (Z a). \n Now at that point, it makes sense to have every function in the interface return Maybe (Z a) because I can then sequence my operations nicely with >>= \n z :: Z a z >>= op1 >>= op2 >>= (op3 x) >>= (op4 1 2) \n or something like\n pipe :: (Foldable t, Monad m) => a -> t (a -> m a) -> m a pipe = foldM (&) z :: Z a pipe z [op1, op2, op3 x, op4 1 2] \n This is pretty convenient, I suppose, but then just one or two operations that have a Maybe result changed the entire interface to the data structure. An alternative would be to make the data structure itself an instance of Monad and make everything again -> Z a. There are several advantages of internalizing, e.g., I can carry some extra information in the Nothing case or even have several failure paths; and several disadvantages -- the non maybe'd functions now have to do the boilerplate to check for the Nothing-ish inputs and pass them along for every function, whereas Maybe does that automatically.\n My question is what are the Haskell best practices/idioms for this decision. Where is the boundary for the choice between internalizing the Monad instance in the data structure type itself and just using something like Maybe for *all* the functions in the interface. \n I hope my question is clear.

When with effect systems and asynchronous stuff in general(eg NodeJs which only has 1 thread) where you have n threads to handle a much bigger m of concurrent connection you dont have that.

          "description": "Hello, guys! I have the technical question.\n Need to merge the payload if the reference number(refNo) is the same in different messages. Limitation is that I can only use a KTable and if the key is an even number I don't need to merge the payload. Additionally, the order of incoming messages should not change the result.\n ​\n For example, if we have an empty topic and incoming messages are:\n ​\n 1: { key: \"1\", value: {refNo:1, payload:{data1}} }\n 2: { key: \"2\", value: {refNo:1, payload:{data2}} }\n 3: { key: \"3\", value: {refNo:2, payload:{data3}} } // this one should be not effected and left how it is\n ​\n Expected result:\n ​\n 1: { key: \"1\", value: {refNo:1, payload:{data1, data2}} }\n 2: { key: \"2\", value: {refNo:1, payload:{data2}} }\n 3: { key: \"3\", value: {refNo:2, payload:{data3}} }\n ​\n The only way I can think of to do this is to use two times .groupBy and join with the original topic everything again.\n ​\n  \nFirst change the key to refNo, save the key to the value itself, and join the payload during aggregation.\n Secondly .groupBy revert key to the initial state.\n The last step joins everything to the original topic because I lost one message during grouping by.\n  \n​\n I'm pretty sure there's an easier way to do this. What is the most optimized and elegant way to solve this issue?\n ​\n Thank you in advance.\n    submitted by    /u/invzbl3  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm someone who's familiar with both functional and oo paradigm and have experience working on industrial/research project with both. Although I work with different languages and paradigms for work and study purposes, I personally prefer Haskell over other languages I work with.\n Recently, I decided to learn a new language (for fun, for job hunt etc) and am thinking of Scala. Since I love Haskell, I wanted to start with Functional Programming in Scala. However, seems like the book doesn’t cover Scala 3. Should I worry about it and use some other resource? Or should I just go with Scala 2.x?\n Also, since I haven’t started learning, I'd appreciate if you let me know if I should learn it or something else (maybe \"Go for elixir since you like strictly functional stuff\")?\n Thanks!\n Edit: Thank you all for your valuable comments. I made up my mind to give Scala a try. Probably I will start with 2.x and move to 3 after getting some head around it.\n    submitted by    /u/pptx704  \n [link]   [comments]",

Now if your other project doesn't use SQL but they need your core object it will drag all the libraries with it.\n If you separate out the core domain class into a submodule that doesn't contain any dependencies, then you can import that to other projects, but then it's suddenly not package-by-feature. Or can we achieve a hybrid model where the core object is separate and then all the rest, SQL, HTTP, API, JSON are in one other module that is the app.\n    submitted by    /u/EloZash  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm not new to the JVM; I've done previous work in Java (1.6/Android) and spent a large chunk of time writing Clojure. My previous work has been in Haskell, which I liked. I guess my question is: Is Scala worth it now? I have a larger Java codebase I'll be integrating with, and I get to choose what JVM technologies to use, and other folks have expressed interest in Scala as well. I'd feel guilty for pushing Clojure on them, just because I know it, but I've also been there and done that, and I like types now. Coming from Haskell, are there functional libraries I should build upon but allow for escape hatch style mutability for some of my not so functional teammates? We're a small team, and pedagogy will be a part of the gig. I'm looking for honest opinions of the language and what essential reading material/libraries would be for someone more comfortable with FP in general. I'm not opposed to pragmatism either; it's one thing I like about Scala. It seems like there's a lot of excellent libraries because of the existing JVM ecosystem.

So the service call fails and scheduler blows up and goes away, leaving my app running without the 15-minute scheduled tasks that were supposed to happen.\n How would you structure an app with futures or tasks or any effect system (leaving aside actors) to supervise the system as a whole such that:\n  \nIf a service connection in the connection pool happened to get disconnected and we just found out, my_svc_pool should safely dispose of it and replace it\n If scheduler blows up on waking up and trying to perform its task, app should replace it with a fresh one\n  \n   submitted by    /u/yawaramin  \n [link]   [comments]",

My goal for this project is to make \"CSS in PureScript\" more practical for real-world use cases, meaning: * Extensive type-level validation * Minimal syntactic overhead * Broad CSS coverage * Alignment with W3C specifications * Exhaustive testing\n If you're interested to take a look, a good place to start might be the Zen Garments example, adapted from Dan Mall's CSS Zen Garden submission in order to assess the library's CSS coverage.\n From there, you might like to see some examples of CSS errors that will fail to compile. Some of these issues are significantly more complicated than e.g. providing a <length-percentage> value where a <length> was expected (although those cases are covered too).\n Hopefully the next step would be to try it out for yourself, using the large test suite as a reference wherever the (WIP) docs currently fall short.\n I am looking forward to any feedback you might have to offer! I would also like to note that contributions are welcome, so please let me know if you are interested via Twitter or [email](mailto:nick@saunde.rs); or, if you have something specific in mind already, just review the contributing guidelines and then open an issue.\n Thanks for reading!\n    submitted by    /u/nsaunders1  \n [link]   [comments]",

This was done in the context of a\nTweag open source fellowship, under the supervision of Dominic Steinitz. These\nimprovements are part of the upcoming 1.0 release of the library.\nBriefly, what’s Monad-Bayes about? Like Church, Gen and\nPyropyro (among other probabilistic programming languages), it allows a user\nto specify a Bayesian model as a program, and automates the process of\ninferring the specified distribution. Unlike other languages, it is a\nfirst-class library of its host language (Haskell), rather than an embedded\nlanguage. This means that any language feature in the host language is\navailable to you. It also means that you can have distributions over absolutely\nanything. For in…",

          "description": "On a previous post, we explained how to write tests for\nstateful systems using traces — sequences of stateful actions — that can be\ncombined and modified to write complex test cases easily and transparently. This\npost elaborates on the combinators used to generate new traces from previously\nexisting traces.\nWriting generators for property-based tests is an art, and there’s often a\ntrade-off between how many test cases are generated and how meaningful each of\nthem is. When considering stateful systems, this problem is exacerbated, because\nany action taken now may constrain the available actions for the future. This\nmeans that the test generator will already need to track how the state evolves\nfrom each step to the next in order to generate valid inputs. We think that\nthis is problematic bec…",

          "description": "Hi, I'm very new to org-mode although it already looks like something that I've been trying to invent myself (in much more lame ways) for many years.\n One thing that I don't immediately see from them the manual - is there some \"standard\" or well-know way to work with the outline-organized data that have multiple dimensions?\n Here is what I mean by that:\n Say, I have a lab diary where I track number of processes - each process every day:\n * Day 1 ** Morning sync up meeting with the team my notes on it ** Ongoing Experiment 1 checking out the night results, trying new approaches ** Something else ... * Day 2 ** Morning sync up meeting with the team ... ** Ongoing Experiment 1 ... ** Something else ... * Day 3 ... \n And this is how it goes!\n So, the first dimension here is the timeline: Day 1, Day 2, ... while the second one is the processes that repeat every day.\n Clearly, depending on task, it would be handy to see this outline from the different points of view: sometimes considering the \"time\" dimension to be the outer one, sometimes to see the \"process\" dimension to be the outer:\n Time dimension is outer:\n * Day 1 ** Process 1 ** Process 2 ... * Day 2 ... \n Process dimension is outer:\n * Process 1 ** Day 1 ** Day 2 ... * Process 2 ... \n One can easily come up with a case of three or for dimensions like. E.g. \"Date/[Home|Work]/Habit/Successes\".\n Turning the tree inside out to follow the day by day progress for one of experiments would be very helpful. As well as tracking the daily successes in the second example.\n Is there a built-in feature or packages or a known workflow for such case?\n Like best practice(s) for such data organization, turning the outline inside out, making different OLAP-like views into the outline?\n thanks :)\n    submitted by    /u/Zestyclose-Painter-3  \n [link]   [comments]",

I've started tinkering with custom agenda views, and I've got this fairly basic custom view happening with the following code:\n  (setq org-agenda-files '(\"~/Documents/projects\")) (setq org-agenda-custom-commands '((\"p\" \"Programming todos\" ((tags \"programming\"))))) \n Now, I have a number of projects in that projects directory whose top-level headline is marked with the WAIT TODO keyword, but whose children are marked with regular TODO. My logic here is that I want to mark an entire project as waiting or blocked without having to mark every subtree or subtask as waiting, too.\n The problem is, when I use my custom agenda view, the project headline appears (albeit greyed-out), and all its children appear. Is there a way to exclude an entire tree from appearing in a custom agenda view if its headline or one of its parents is marked with a certain keyword, in this case, WAIT?\n Thanks in advance for any help!\n    submitted by    /u/the_plonkmaster  \n [link]   [comments]",

Something I'm kind of wanting to is a way to mark something as delegated to X person. I don't need them to see that I delegated it, just to remind myself that I told them to do something and to follow up.\n ​\n I started out with a regular org file for each context, then ended up creating new org files for each \"thing\", which created my mess. Today I decided to try creating dailies in org-roam to see how that works out.\n ​\n Any suggestions for how to keep life organized in org or org-roam when you've got so much going on.

          "description": "A thought occurred to me today while I was getting ready, mentally preparing. I realized that I was feeling a bit stressed about the day but that the thought of my todo and agenda buffers had a calming effect. I thought to myself, \"it's alright, you're organized and at least if there is chaos it is somewhat documented chaos and you don't have to hold it all in your mind.\"\n Last weekend, I took the time to do a much needed cleanup of my init.el file. I got rid of all the cruft of comments, things I'd tried but given up though not yet deleted. I made a move to using straight.el as my package manager. I switched from Ivy to Helm. I just did some things I'd been meaning to do for a while. I cleaned up my todo file and recommitted to using 'C-c a a' more throughout the day.\n I assume that many of you, like me, find a certain \"gee, that's neat\" quality to getting some of this working. A sense of satisfaction maybe. I like learning new ways to do things, maybe cleaner, tighter. But the thing that I keep coming back to even more than all that is that this technology, this nerdy system, has a way of calming me and making me feel better. It feels like the world has more and more information each day, more chaos, etc. Using org-mode helps me live in the world.\n I was curious to see if any of you have had similar thoughts about it?\n    submitted by    /u/kregerator  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Howdy. It would be much easier for me to do my note-taking if org-roam-node-find had the following behavior: - Pressing TAB changes the text in the search bar to whatever the suggestion list has highlighted. I'd like it to just replace the entire thing instead of doing that default step-by-step completion if possible. - Pressing ENTER opens or creates the exact match of what's entered in the org-roam-node-find search bar. \n Currently, I'm having some issues. My PKM note hierarchy uses dots as delimiters. Take the note res.lore.sw as an example (my note about Star Wars). I created it first. Now I want to create res.lore as an index for all the lores I've written about, but org-roam-node-find won't let me create it, because it matches with the Star Wars note and opens it. I'd instead like to be able to either press TAB to set the highlighted file as the new search, or press ENTER to open or create the exact note id entered into the search bar.\n My current org-roam config is pretty much the minimum:  (use-package org-roam :ensure t :init (setq org-roam-v2-ack t) :custom (org-roam-directory \"REDACTED\") (org-roam-complete-everywhere t) (org-roam-capture-templates '((\"d\" \"default\" plain \"%?\" :if-new (file+head \"${title}.org\" \"#+title: ${title}\\n#+date: %U\\n\") :unnarrowed t))) :config (org-roam-setup) (org-roam-db-autosync-mode)) \n    submitted by    /u/Tristan401  \n [link]   [comments]",

And something I have come to realise is that a lot of stuff could be implemented really fast by sending arbitrary key sequences. \n Keyboard macros seem limited to me : they look more like a succession of commands than a succession of keys.\n Two examples I could not achieve with macros (maybe I'm doing it wrong)\n - Prepare a command : for example I want to prepare a call to isearch, with foo pre-typed into the minibuffer. When I do it the macro way, the macro will execute the command isearch foo\n - Define an alias for partial key-bindings : let's say I want to alias C-x r to C-r, so that i can type C-r t instead of C-x r t (which is bound to #'string-rectangle). I could not make a keyboard macro work since C-x r is not bound to anything\n Is there anyway to send arbitrary key sequences to the emacs interpreter from elisp ?\n ​\n Thanks !\n    submitted by    /u/Horrih  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I'm looking for a way to bypass org-agenda dispatcher (unsure about the terminology here: I'm talking about the buffer you get immediately upon calling org-agenda), and thought of a simple way of doing it. \n (defun my/org-agenda () (interactive) (setq my/agenda-views nil) (dolist (cmd org-agenda-custom-commands) (add-to-list 'my/agenda-views (cons (car (cdr cmd)) (car cmd)))) (let ((view (cdr (assoc (completing-read \"Select an agenda view: \" my/agenda-views) my/agenda-views)))) (org-agenda nil view nil))) \n That worked just fine, but I thought it'd be nice to be able to pass restrictions (to buffer, subtree, etc.) to the function, perhaps using C-u as a prefix for a buffer restriction and C-u C-u for a subtree restriction. So I figured this should work: \n (defun my/org-agenda-restr (&optional arg) (interactive \"P\") (when arg (org-check-for-org-mode)) (setq my/agenda-views nil) (dolist (cmd org-agenda-custom-commands) (add-to-list 'my/agenda-views (cons (car (cdr cmd)) (car cmd)))) (let ((restr (cond ((equal arg '(4)) 'buffer) ((equal arg '(16)) 'subtree))) (view (cdr (assoc (completing-read \"Select an agenda view: \" my/agenda-views) my/agenda-views)))) (org-agenda nil view restr))) \n But it doesn't. For some reason, no matter which custom view I try to call, I get a CRM prompt asking me to choose a keyword. \n Now, I thought maybe I was passing the wrong type of object as the third argument for org-agenda, So I tested using this, and it looks like what I'm passing as the third argument is a symbol, which I thought is what it wanted: \n (defun my/test (&optional arg) (interactive \"P\") (let ((restr (cond ((equal arg '(4)) 'buffer) ((equal arg '(16)) 'subtree)))) (when (symbolp restr) (message \"Yes\")))) \n So I'm going wrong somewhere, but cannot figure out where.\n    submitted by    /u/graduale  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I'd like to have a completing-read type command that can perform commonly used file moving/copying operations. For example, I'm constantly syncing a couple of projects to a remote machine where they run. Currently I bind a key for each one to an rsync shell command call like so:\n (defun myprojectA-sync () (interactive) (shell-command (concat \"rsync -a --progress --exclude-from='~/myprojectA/.syncignore' ~/myprojectA/ remotemachine1:~/myprojectA/ && echo 'Done.'\")))) (map! :leader :desc \"Sync my project A from local machine\" \"c b\" #'myprojectA-sync) \n It'd be helpful to have one single command to call a completion list that can run the pre-defined file operations for Project A, B, C, etc. I don't see why they couldn't act on multiple machines (remotemachine1, remotemachine2, etc.) or use different commands (mv, scp, rsync, etc.).\n Is there some feature/package that already exists to do something like this? \n If not, does anyone have suggestions for a novice in elisp when it comes to writing the function? My thoughts so far were just a bunch of lists like\n (setq sync-names '(\"Sync project A\" \"Sync project B\")) (setq sync-method '(\"rsync\" \"scp\")) (setq sync-dest-dir '(\"remotemachine1:~/dir1\" \"remotemachine2:~/otherdir\")) \n to call shell-command wrapped in competing-read.\n    submitted by    /u/tdstoff7  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I've been using emacs to write tex documents for a long time, and recently switched to spacemacs, with evil mode. I use the reftex command reftex-reference to insert \\ref commands. In spacemacs evil mode, when I use this, the reference is inserted *before* the cursor (point), so that it's off by one character. I would like to know if it's possible to configure this to insert after. I'm asking here because I think this is a general evil-mode issue rather than a specific spacemacs configuration issue. Details below.\n Here's what happens:\n Have a tex file with some text like the following, with the cursor at the rectangle marker, and with the buffer in evil's \"normal state\" (like vim's normal mode), not insert mode.\n \\begin{theorem}\\label{mylabel} theorem text \\end{theorem} Now some words▮ \n Note that this is what happens when there's a space *after* \"words\" in the text; in evil's normal state, the cursor is a block that occupies the position of a character.\n Then I use the reftex-reference command and select \"mylabel\". The inserted text I get is\n Now some words\\ref{mylabel}▮ \n with the inserted \\ref *before* the trailing space. Then the space appears *after*. I believe the line that actually does the inserting is line 510 of reftex-ref.el.\n ​\n To be clear, this is not because the final character is a space. If I delete the space after \"words\", positioning my cursor on the final \"s\", then the inserted reference looks like\n Now some word\\ref{mylabel}s \n with the cursor positioned on the final \"s\".\n ​\n So, the problem seems to be that reftex-reference is doing the insertion on the *left* side of the \"normal state\" cursor, not the right. I would like it to insert on the right. Does anyone here know how this can be configured?\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/EVenbeRi  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I guess this is a rhetorical question because I doubt anyone knows why but it turns out that dired buffers return nil for buffer-file-name instead of the path to the directory they are viewing.\n I believe this has cost me a ton of time but I did learn a lot along the way. lsp-docker highest level function is lsp-docker-start. It calls lsp-workspace-root which calls buffer-file-name which, if starting from a dired buffer, returns nil so lsp-workspace-root returns nil and the LSP server is not started.\n This is my first venture into LSP mode and I was doing something slightly different, a basic low level function was returning nil, so I assumed I was way off track in my set up, and I needed to dig deeper. And, indeed, I came up with a solution. I was documenting what I had found for myself so I wouldn't forget and started asking myself more questions.\n I went back and tested lsp-workspace-root in a file that had LSP mode enabled and it returned the proper path for the workspace. I then restarted everything, loaded lsp-mode but didn't start it, and went to the directory of the project. Sure enough, lsp-workspace-root returned nil (as it had before). I then looked at the code and started to try and follow it step by step. That's when I discovered that dired buffers have no buffer-file-name. I opened TAGS (an arbitrary file within the project) and now lsp-workspace-root returns the proper workspace.\n I think I could have set up my LSP stuff with a simple YAML file had I tried lsp-docker-start from a file rather than a dired buffer and saved the time spent coming up with the solution I pointed to.\n Anyhow... live and learn I guess.\n    submitted by    /u/pedzsanReddit  \n [link]   [comments]",

I initially found it in google but now, since I know it exists, how can I quickly find info about this param directly in emacs? For example I want to find a manual page where this param is mentioned. Is there anything like apropos-EVERYTHING command that will look for a word (or regex) in all documentation? \n Even more. I now know that info about :narrow param for clock table can be found in org manual on a page called The clock table. I know it from google. How could I find this page using emacs? \n How would you find that page in emacs manual?\n P.S. I know about describe-* and apropos-* (and info) functions but I don't see any function that does the search across everything. There are also similar questions in the internet and there is a suggestion to search the documentation with grep or zgrep which I don't find useful. They just search in *.info files which when opened don't behave as info pages. Is greping the only way?\n    submitted by    /u/reliktary  \n [link]   [comments]",

They render the same text in the same file, in the same theme, with the same font (as per M-x describe-font), but they look quite different.\n Here's a screenshot showing the two side by side: https://screenshots.200ok.ch/screenshot_2022_10_26-a7bdddc0.png\n The version to the left is quite thin, the weight seems off. However, the weight is the same. Changing the weight will not remove this discrepancy. \n Both Debian and Guix have the bold variant of Fira installed: https://screenshots.200ok.ch/screenshot_2022_10_26-36be0060.png\n Generally speaking, the bold variant works insofar that I can use it globally: https://screenshots.200ok.ch/screenshot_2022_10_26-5620acc4.png\n However, when used in a font-face, it won't become bold: https://screenshots.200ok.ch/screenshot_2022_10_26-bb7ddfd5.png\n I'm happy if anyone can point me to the necessary change to make the new install look the same as before.

This all works fine and has for years.\n Except that I find that I suddenly have to deal with email hosted on office365. It does IMAP, so I can read my mail, but it warns\n `Notice: far side store does not support flag(s) 'P'; not propagating.`\n The consequence of this is that the changes I make locally aren't reflected on the server. Refiling or deleting mail doesn't have any effect. That means my INBOX is just going to grow and grow and grow and eventually that's going to be a problem. (Nevermind that if I decide to peek at my mail from my phone or something, it's going to be a confusing mess.)\n In a previous life, I managed with davmail, but dear $DEITY in heaven, I'd really rather not have to do that again.\n Anyone know if mbsync (or the office365 account) can be configured to make things Work Right(TM)?\n    submitted by    /u/ndw  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I just found out that I can emacs as my IRC client with ERC which is great. However, there are a couple of issues that I am wondering if Emacs supports: the first is that the message prompt is terminal style, which means that it keeps moving as I receive messages. Is there a way to replicate the interface of other IRC clients where there is a separate frame for inputing messages?\n The second issue is that it seems that receiving files from an XDCC server does not work. Is there some special configuration for it to work?\n    submitted by    /u/Tohiko  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "In my config https://github.com/vidbina/dotfiles/tree/reorg-for-lit-prog/emacs#-text you may spot that I use visual-fill-column-mode and adaptive-wrap-mode to improve the readability of text in Emacs.\n ⚠️ The gotcha is that I sometimes have bits of context that I want to exclude from being \"wrapped\" such as tables. My current UX on this is poor as I usually want to see the table fully extended while simultaneously sneaking a peak at text in the paragraphs around it. Is there a way to do this (exclude a region from being wrapped) or is there a term that describes what I'm looking for that I should factor into my web-search queries?\n 🤔 There is never really a use case where the wrapped table is even readable for me so it's just a lost piece of screen real estate when I wrap the buffer. It may as well be folded away to be conjured up through something similar to C-c C-v v where can open expanded code into a preview buffer (to see how all the noweb refs resolve). How do you deal with wrapping when tables are present? Hoping to learn what I can improve about my usage to minimize this \"pain\".\n 💡 For now I keep toggling between the wrapped and non-wrapped states and now that I'm typing this, I'm thinking that I can open a cloned frame or buffer. That way I can show the table non-wrapped or extended in one buffer, while I look at the wrapped peripheral text in a cloned buffer and thus have a way to keep the wrapped states apart. This however does alter the layout of buffers which is again a bit of a UX killer as it disturbs the y-flow of the text in the original buffer if you catch my drift.\n Looking fwd to getting schooled. Thanks for helping think along. 🙏🏿\n    submitted by    /u/vidbina  \n [link]   [comments]",

And do it for every of the languages of interest until it either works out or finally fails.\n I wasn’t able though to confirm from the elisp reference that this is possible)\n Sorry for the probable naivety of this question - I’m really not that familiar yet with Emacs internals and not speaking from arrogance here - just trying to describe my thought process trying to both explain what I need and not to overload the reader with complexities of my setup.\n Probably there is some true and very different way to solve tgis question that I’m not aware of.\n Thank you :)\n    submitted by    /u/Zestyclose-Painter-3  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm trying to set Org's org-tag-alist variable so that a directory containing all my projects can easily have the type of project categorised according to some default tags. Unfortunately, the .dir-locals.el file uses different syntax (dot notation?) to what I'm already barely used to with regular Emacs Lisp, so I'm struggling to make it work. In particular, I'm trying to get some group tags in that variable, but I'm utterly clueless because I just haven't had the time to learn Emacs Lisp yet.\n Could anyone supply a minimum working example of a .dir-locals.el snippet that adds group tags to Org mode?

I would like to try out some possible fixes: it looks like most issues are simply due to the fact that many functions are only defined for the GTK framework, and not Mac's NextStep/Cocoa framework.\n Also, if anybody wants to help out with this effort, please let me know.\n ​\n UPDATE:\n  \nif you're interested in understanding Emacs C source-code, take a look at this section of the official manual: I found the part about Writing Emacs Primitives especially helpful. Many thanks to u/7890yuiop!!!\n If you're interested in the xwidget patches I'm working on, I've created this fork of the emacs mirror.

Going through his stuff, I found a CD-R with the label \"emacs backup.\" I pop the disk into my computer; and while the computer recognizes it, it says the disk is unreadable. So I Google what emacs even is. He was into coding, and was even trying to create his own pixel art computer game thing. I figure the backup could be related to that kind of stuff.\n How do I get this CD to open? I installed emacs on my computer (I think?) and nothing changed? \n (I do realize he could have also used it as a journal. Honestly, I want answers to questions, and I'll never get them, now.

The last included commit was cbd04ad3d572850775f18bde868c71abcde733ed.\n Anyway, this build use a new \"trampolines\" target for make. This target pre-compiles (AOT) trampolines, infrastructure that allows natively compiled elisp to call redefined elisp primitives, which are then included with the installer, zip and no-deps.zip distributables. While redefining primitives is discouraged, it does happen, especially via advice APIs.\n Including these trampolines should enable installing and running (e.g.) packages that advise elisp primitives. Previously (in all 29 snapshots and GNU windows binary distributions of Emacs 28) that might have failed because Emacs unconditionally creates trampolines on the fly if they do not exist when needed. Precompiling the trampolines should prevent Emacs from triggering async native compilation even when native-comp-available-p was returning nil, to make them.\n TIA for bug reports & feedback!\n PS, in case others are building Emacs with native comp enabled and not distributing GCC/libgcc with, the new make target isn't on the Emacs 28 branch (yet). It should be fairly easy to patch it in or manually add something like this to your packaging process after success of make all, before make install (or make install-strip or whtv)\n  (mapatoms (λ (f) (when (subr-primitive-p (symbol-function f)) (or (comp-trampoline-search f) (comp-trampoline-compile f))))) \n This code comes from message #50 in bug #58318, and worked for me (however, the 29 snapshot binaries do use the new make target, now - they don't use the above snippet).\n Edit: un-mangled the code block\n    submitted by    /u/mplscorwin  \n [link]   [comments]",

For example, I can update all lsp-related package in straight.el by calling straight-pull-package and then type lsp- to get a list of completion candidates with lsp in the name. Then I call embark-act-all and pull all the selected packages.\n But it would be useful to be able to switch from an arbitrary completing-read minibuffer into completing-read-multiple via a key-press, collect multiple candidates (which don't necessarily have matching substrings), and then just run the original command for each of the selected candidates, e.g. via embark-act-all. This would be much more convenient than just running the command multiple times or what I sometimes do, mapping the function over the list in elisp (M-: (seq-map #'<command> candidates))\n I could write my own function which calls completing-read-multiple, like straight-pull-package-crm, but it would be nice if something like that would be possible from any command.

But magit has a similar repo structure, and its docs were installing fine.\n I noticed that the recipe for magit has a :files key which pulls in the doc file. Adding\n :straight (:files (:defaults \"docs/*\")) \n to my (use-package 'transient ...) form appears to do the trick - and automagically triggers a make docs command for transient somehow - but now I have two wrinkles:\n  \nstraight rebuilds transient every time I start Emacs\n I get a warning \"Warning (straight): Two different recipes given for \"transient\" (:files cannot be both nil and (:defaults \"docs/*\"))\"\n  \nThe first issue is annoying, but isn't a showstopper. I don't restart Emacs very often and my startup time is already slow.\n The second issue worries me, because I don't know whether it means that updated docs will actually get installed in the future. Presumably the clash is between my (use-package 'transient ...) and the recipe that gets used when transient is handled as a dependency of magit (which I also use). But which recipe is actually used to install transient now? Is it getting installed twice every time?\n I don't know why the transient docs aren't getting installed \"out of the box\" as they apparently are for everyone else. What might I be doing wrong?\n    submitted by    /u/quokka70  \n [link]   [comments]",

OS I recently decided to start adding some extended features and working on my config. Eventually I managed to get lastfm.el and Vuiet working together and it’s awesome! I think I’ve figured out how to make a script with new keybinds for the Vuiet stuff I need to use, but some features are broken, namely searching songs by lyrics. I’m not sure how to debug emacs scripts so if anyone has any suggestions, including a better player, I’m open. Also, I’m shopping around for a completion module, mostly for Python but also C and HTML.\n Edit:\n Vuiet is cool, but seems like a lost cause. I think the only functionality EMMS doesn’t have that Vuiet did, though, is searching by artist for stuff I don’t actually have. \n My main problem at this point is how to add an SMB share to EMMS.\n    submitted by    /u/Magicaldave918  \n [link]   [comments]",

The following defines a complete prefix:\n (setq l1 '((\"vl\" \"visual lines\" visual-line-mode))) (transient-define-prefix foo1 () \"docstring\" [:pad-keys t [\"Appearance\" l1]]) \n (The macro allows for a list of \"elements\" like l1 to be interpolated, something like a ,@ splice in a backtick context.)\n But having the variable l1 lying around feels like a loose end. The following approach looks better:\n (let ((l2 '((\"vl\" \"visual lines\" visual-line-mode)))) (transient-define-prefix foo2 () \"docstring\" [:pad-keys t [\"Appearance\" l2]])) \n But it fails with \"Symbol’s value as variable is void: l2\"\n My understanding of elisp scope is clearly lacking.\n Is the problem that the transient-define-prefix macro is expanded within the let scope but the result is not evaluated until after the let scope is discarded? The elisp documentation for macros says that \"[t]he Lisp interpreter proceeds to evaluate the expansion as soon as it comes back from the macro\" but I may be misunderstanding this.\n    submitted by    /u/quokka70  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi everyone!\n Lately, I've been defining my own regular expressions for parsing errors in the *compilation* buffers by adding entries to the compilation-error-regexp-alist and compilation-error-regexp-alist-alist variables. However, there's a problem. This list already contains an enormous amount of regular expressions for all kinds of languages that I don't use, however, these regular expressions also match errors of the language that I'm trying to add support to, and this results in extracting incorrect paths to files containing errors. I've set compilation-error-regexp-alist to nil and the problem disappeared, but now when I byte-compile elisp files, I get no way to jump to problems from the compilation buffer (well, duh, the regexp list now doesn't contain an entry for elisp).\n So this creates a problem. I want my regular expressions to be the only ones present in the list when I'm working on a project in this language, and I want other regexps to be available when I'm working on other projects. I've thought about using dir-locals.el but my regexps use functions to get the file out of the error message, and I can't put that into dir-locals reliably.\n Another problem is that the compilation-error-regexp-alist contains names of the languages it supports, but for example, there's no elisp or emacs-lisp entry, yet the byte-compile warnings are highlighted correctly. And there's no way to see what regular expressions are responsible for the matches in the compilation buffer, so it's hard to debug what's overriding mine.\n TL;DR: Ideally, I want compilation-error-regexp-alist to be configurable per project but I use custom functions that can break other people's configurations who work on the same project as me and load dir-locals.el\n    submitted by    /u/andreyorst  \n [link]   [comments]",

Specifically, the pain points with TRAMP shows up mostly in dired and magit, where the turnaround speed (time spent to open a folder in dired, or time spend in any magit command) is quite high. I suspect this is due to the underlying process that TRAMP uses to connect to my remote server. My remote connection is relatively fast (100Mbps+). Things that I have tried till now are:\n  \nFor my remote server, set the following flags in .ssh/config such that TRAMP re-uses the connections\n  \n Host myfasthost ... Compression yes ControlPath /tmp/%r@%h:%p ControlMaster auto ControlPersist 90m \n  \nI use scp protocol to connect to TRAMP in dired.

I was on version 1.5.5, and I've ended up on 1.8.9.\n This upgrade does seem to break a lot of my little tweaks to mu4e. I've managed to sort a few of these out, e.g. mu4e~proc-remove-id becomes mu4e--server-remove-id, mu4e~mark-check-target becomes mu4e--mark-check-target .\n But there are still a few bugs. I previously stole a function to convert an email to a .pdf file:\n (defun mu4e-action-open-to-pdf (msg) (let* ((date (mu4e-message-field msg :date)) (infile (mu4e~write-body-to-html msg)) (outfile (format-time-string \"%Y-%m-%d%H%M%S.pdf\" date))) (with-temp-buffer (shell-command (format \"wkhtmltopdf %s ~/Mail/gmail/pdfs/%s\" infile outfile) t)) (interactive) (find-file (format \"~/Mail/gmail/pdfs/%s\" outfile) ) )) \n Now mu4e~write-body-html is no longer defined.\n My questions are:\n  \nIs there a replacement for mu4e~write-body-html? Or a different method to convert a message to pdf?\n \nI've tried to follow the release notes here, but find it hard to follow... for instance, the releases jump from 1.4.15 to 1.6.0? (So where is 1.5.5?) Is there a compilation of all these changes from e.g. ~ to -- and other general refactoring?\n \n EDIT:\n Just found this warning in the documentation:\n The whole of mu4e consists of hundreds of elisp functions. However, the majority of those are for internal use only; you can recognize them easily, because they all start with mu4e~ or mu4e--. These functions make all kinds of assumptions, and they are subject to change, and should therefore not be used. \n which explains the instability. Didn't see this/know enough about elisp when I stole the functions. Fair enough.\n    submitted by    /u/nonreligious  \n [link]   [comments]",

E.g in eshell I'd type cd and hit <TAB>:\n ~ $ cd \n to open up the *Completions* buffer. Im currently using emacs 29.0.50 (commit 72c64dd73c), and so M-<down> and M-<up> can cycle through the completions (directories in this case with the cd command), while keeping the eshell buffer focused. The problem I'm facing now is how to actually insert the currently highlighted completion into my eshell buffer. Clicking on the completion with the mouse will insert it into eshell, as well as switching focus to the *Completions* buffer and hitting RET over it, but I'm trying to do this without having to switch focus from eshell. M-<up> and M-<down>, added new in emacs 29, allow cycling through completions while keeping focus in the current window (my eshell in this case), but I cant select one. The command minibuffer-choose-completion, which is bound to M-RET returns an error saying \"Text is read only\", which I think is happening because it is trying to insert the completion into the minibuffer and not my eshell window. Moreover, completion-at-point for symbols in elisp files works as intended with M-RET, but not for eshell. Any help on how to sort this would be great.

          "description": "How To Use Creative Techniques Within the Zettelkasten Framework\r\n                   \nOne of the greatest difficulties in understanding the Zettelkasten Method is to separate its specific characteristics from actual knowledge work. Or, how I like to phrase it: “Link knowledge, not notes.” Working with our Zettelkasten is the physical (or digital) manifestation of our thinking. It provides a framework that allows us to think through writing and to create an increasingly complex thinking machine that can help us think deeper than being on our own. The Zettelkasten Method provides a framework for our thinking, but does not prescribe what and how we think.\n\r\n                   \nRead the full story here",

          "description": "Just gauging interest...\nIn the coming weeks I'm considering releasing my hyper-minimal take on Zettelkasten to a wider audience. My rationale has always been to squash complexity in favor of a quick & lightweight method of retrieving notes (nothing at all wrong with other apps that have all the bells & whistles btw). The same codebase runs on any of Windows, Linux, BSD (Apple likely to be included soon as well) with zero issues.\nSome screen shots...\n\n\n\nThe interface as you noticed is commandline driven & features a REPL (Read Evaluate Print & Loop) to process commands. As it stands now, the source code is merely 27 Kilobytes in size & would be great to toss on a USB drive so your notes are easy to access. No smartphone interface as I'm not much interested in that domain. At any rate, if this sounds like something you might be interested in, check in every now & again & I'll hopefully post a download link eventually.",

Zettel aren't exactly just notes (notes being the plural of note.)\nI have new strategies for searching The Archive for prior zettel to link to new zettel.

Right now, I am processing the application to physics which is also a nice read.\nTo me, the key learning for the Zettelkasten Method is the heavy emphasis on decision making. I can't express it precise enough to communicate it nicely. But there is a striking similarity to learning the Zettelkasten Method. Right now, many people try to learn it as if they learn something from a textbook. It feels rather \"formulaic\".

This is a sociologists' framing of their own research and analysis practice and thus bears a sociological related name. While he talks more about the thinking, outlining, and writing process rather than the mechanical portion of how he takes notes or what he uses, he's extending significantly on the ideas and methods that Sönke Ahrens describes in How to Take Smart Notes (2017), though obviously he's doing it 65 years earlier. It would seem obvious that the specific methods (using either files, note cards, notebooks, etc.) were a bit more commonplace for his time and context, so he spent more of his time on the finer and tou…",
