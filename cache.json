If you're interested in giving a talk, we have slots for 25 minute and 5 minute talks. Talks already planned include:\n ​\n Practical STM: An Async Job Queue, by Jake Keuhlen\n ​\n  \nIn this talk, we’ll walk through a brief introduction to concurrency and one of Haskell’s best tools for dealing with it: software transactional memory (STM). We’ll then use STM to build a simple but powerful asynchronous job queue.\n  \nMake your own Haskell, by Mitchell Vitez\n ​\n  \nWe'll explore the process of making our own Haskell-like language. Composition will lead us to trees, and trees will lead us to languages. We'll grow, trim, typecheck, and reorganize these trees, populating our own little forested enclave. Finally, we'll discover why our language can't really be represented by a tree after all.\n  \n​\n We'll have pizza delivered and the event will be bartended.\n The event is at the Power + Light Building, at 920 Southwest 6th Avenue.\n Please RSVP here if you're interested: https://www.eventbrite.com/e/haskell-talks-at-mercury-tickets-424633328717.

Secondly, I understand something like let x = 5 in something, where the compiler looks for x in something and replaces it with 5.

I understand that functions can be partially applied (i.e. you don't pass the last parameter), but in this case we aren't even passing the first parameter - square is not a Logger.

This got me wondering, is there a way to design an applicative interpreter which uses applicative functors as its interface?\n If this is possible, I could imagine a new design space. Since every monad gives rise to an applicative, there would be a broad range of applicatives to consider. Applicatives are also simpler to reason with, which could make the resulting languages more accessible for proofs.\n So far, I'm not sure that this is possible.

          "description": "Hello r/haskell community!\n For the context, in case you haven't seen my posts before: SimpleX Chat is the first messaging platform that has no user identifiers, not even random numbers The messages are e2e encrypted, and the servers and network observers cannot see users' contacts or groups. You can use the servers pre-configured in the apps or host your own.\n What's new in v4:\n  \nlocal database encryption with passphrase. It's using SQLCipher as a replacement of SQLite, via our forks of direct-sqlite/sqlite-simple, it worked very well on all platforms - iOS, Android, Linux, Mac, we only didn't manage to compile encryption for Windows yet.\n improved stability of chat groups, file transfers and message delivery.\n you can now use your own WebRTC ICE servers for audio-video calls.\n German language in the interface.\n  \nSee full release announcement for more details.\n Download the apps via the links in our GitHub repo: https://github.com/simplex-chat/simplex-chat#readme.\n Please ask any questions\n You comments, questions and criticism here are very welcome - I will try to answer all the questions!\n Also, we are hosting the event on Discord on October 6, at 6pm UK / 10am PT - please join via this link to:\n  \nlearn how SimpleX Chat is different and why it provides better meta-data privacy than alternatives,\n hear about future platform development plans,\n ask any questions,\n criticize what we do,\n suggest improvements.\n  \nOnce you install the app you can choose \"Connect to developers\" to ask any questions, suggest new features and to join the group of users.\n About SimpleX Platform\n Some links to answer the most common questions:\n How can SimpleX deliver messages without user identifiers.\n What are the risks to have identifiers assigned to the users.\n Technical details and limitations.\n How SimpleX is different from Session, Matrix, Signal, etc..\n    submitted by    /u/epoberezkin  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "The utility of uniqueness typing - as evidenced by it being separately adopted by Clean and Mercury, as well as having echoes in Rust - is straightforward: it enforces a typing discipline that ensures values only have a single reference. (or none, in the case of Rust) Hence, using them to model side-effecting sequential code is straightforward, as destructive update and imperative control in uniquely-typed code can't pollute what's outside.\n Linear types are more elegant and intuitive from an abstract perspective, but weaken that guarantee : a linear arrow in Haskell can mint a linear value out of an immutable \"plain\" value with multiple references. Hence, although no more references may be added once it's been created, in-place destructive update isn't guaranteed to be safe.\n All is not lost, though: as linear types can only be used once anyways, it would, for practical purposes, suffice to show that they are eventually unique - that, by the time of their use/destruction, they only have a single reference. One could also consider a sequence of linear arrow applications, such that it converges to uniqueness in the given reference to which they were applied.\n Are there meaningful assumptions which strengthen linearity to uniqueness without dropping the theoretical cleanness? (like wrapping them in an opaque monad)\n    submitted by    /u/talismanick_  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "What are some the steps when trying to resolve errors from cabal build that fails because of dependencies not compiling? I'm not a seasoned user and lack experience with the build tools, but seem to encounter these build issues more often than I would like to. For example I currently have this error. Ok, so one transitive dependency (diagrams-lib-1.4.5.3) that will not compile because of variable not in scope. I then try to lower the version bounds for dependencies that depend on diagrams-lib-1.4.5.3 in hopes that a lower version will not have this same issue:\n Chart >=1.8 && <1.10 , Chart-diagrams >=1.8 && <1.10 \n To:\n Chart >=1.7.0 && <1.8 , Chart-diagrams >=1.7.0 && <1.8 \n This causes another compilation error which I don't understand, as I have already tried various version bounds. So now I don't have any ideas left.\n Why would transitive dependency not compile, shouldn't this be solved by the dependency that uses it before being uploaded as a library for general usage?\n    submitted by    /u/Hxfhjkl  \n [link]   [comments]",

This class is a requirement for my degree and only one person teaches it. I've done well in my other classes and am familiar with a lot of other languages and I feel like I am about to throw tens of thousands of dollars away on a degree because I am struggling with one niche language that I never want to use again. I passed all the hard classes in my degree and my entire education hangs on this. No offense to people who love Haskell. I understand it can be a great language in certain uses. Anyone who was like a lost puppy when they started learning Haskell, what resources did you use? My degree, financial well-being, and mental health depend on it. Haskell is worth about 25% of the overall course grade and I already bombed the first assignment.

          "description": "Hello, I'm currently writing a rewrite rule system for an eDSL. Here is a very simplified version:\n data Expre = A | B | X Expre Expre process :: Expre -> Expre process A = B process B = A process (X ex1 ex2) = X (process ex1) (process ex2) \n Expre pretty much represents a tree with two leaf constructors.\n process has my rewrite rules for terms of type Expre. All it does is swap A and B around. I was wondering if there is a canonical, clean way to track each application of a rewrite rule? So, concretely tracking the changes of my expression: process $ X A (X B A) should spit out the following list of intermediate terms:\n 1 X B (X B A) 2 X B (X A A) 1 X B (X A B) \n The number in the front represents which rewrite rule was applied. This feels very much like a problem that has a generic solution using a typeclass/data structure/idea that I'm not aware of, so I was wondering if such a thing exists. \n My handrolled solution looks like this, there has to be a neater way:\n process :: (Expre -> Expre) -> Expre -> Writer [(Int, Expre)] Expre process fn A = tell [(1, fn B)] >> return B process fn B = tell [(2, fn A)] >> return A process fn (X ex1 ex2) = do e1 <- process (\\e -> fn $ X e ex2) ex1 e2 <- process (\\e -> fn $ X e1 e) ex2 return $ X e1 e2 \n Called with runWriter $ process id $ X A (X B A) in GHC gives the desired result.\n Thank you!\n    submitted by    /u/Dimiranger  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "TL;DR: Is it possible to perform an AST re-write that depends on global knowledge derived from the AST while simultaneously evaluating the AST -- all in a single pass?\n The \"Real\" Problem:\n I'm working on a Haskell -> Elm code generator. I'm parsing out an Elm type AST (see below). The problem is that multiple TyDecl varname nodes could exist after parsing. E.g: the following haskell type definition\n data Foo = Foo Int | Bar [Foo] \n generates\n TyDecl \"Foo\" [] ( TyVariant ( ( \"Foo\" , [ TyInt ] ) :| [ ( \"Bar\" , [ TyApp \"List\" [ TyDecl \"Foo\" [] (!!! Recursive def of Foo here !!!) ( TyApp \"Foo\" [] )] ] ) ] ) ) ( TyApp \"Foo\" [] ) \n To solve this problem I am folding twice over the parsed AST.\n The first pass replaces all but one TyDecl \"Foo\" node with its TyApp \"Foo\" [] node. This is done by using an algebra\n preventDuplicats :: (MonadState (Set VarName) m) => Base Ty (m a) -> m a \n Following the example above this rewrites the above AST to be:\n TyDecl \"Foo\" [] ( TyVariant ( ( \"Foo\" , [ TyInt ] ) :| [ ( \"Bar\" , [ TyApp \"List\" [ TyApp \"Foo\" [] ] ] ) ] ) ) ( TyApp \"Foo\" [] ) \n The second pass evaluates the AST to generate the Elm code (essentially):\n generateElm :: Base Ty String -> String \n What I'd like to do is construct some mechanism that would let me perform this AST re-write (preventDuplicates) while evaluating with the main algebra (generateElm). Maybe something like?:\n evalAndPrevent :: (MonadState (Set VarName) m, Comonad w) => (Base Ty (w a) -> a) -> Base Ty (w (m a)) -> m a \n Ty Definition\n data Ty = TyVar VarName | TyApp VarName [Ty] -- This models `let` expressions in type declarations -- data B a b c = <a> in <b> == TyDecl \"B\" [\"a\",\"b\",\"c\"] <a> <b> | TyDecl VarName [VarName] Ty Ty | ... deriving (Show, Generic) \n Attempted solutions?\n I've looked into prepomorphisms. However, this doesn't seem to work because the re-write morphism Base t a -> Base t a by defintion is a \"local\" only re-write.\n    submitted by    /u/yanhu  \n [link]   [comments]",

The core idea of Okapi is still the same: use monadic parsing to implement web servers.\n The biggest addition to Okapi since I last posted is the addition of named routes. One of the comments on my previous post asked if Okapi had named routes. At the time it didn't, but I think I've found a way to implement type safe named routes in Okapi without relying on Template Haskell or type-level programming like other Haskell web frameworks do.\n I've written a series of essays on the topic of named routes, and how they work in Okapi.\n  \nNamed Routes in Okapi: Part I\n Named Routes in Okapi: Part II\n Named Routes in Okapi: Part III\n  \nOkapi is still in the early stages of development, so I'm looking for feedback. Any kind of feedback is appreciated. Whether it's the design of the documentation, code conventions, the names of functions, concerns, etc. Please don't hesitate.\n I'm really interested to hear what non-Haskell users and beginner Haskellers have to say. The blog posts I listed above are probably more geared toward advanced-beginner/intermediate Haskellers, but feel free to check out the hopefully more beginner friendly documentation listed below.\n  \nOfficial documentation\n Hackage candidate documentation\n  \nDocumentation is still largely incomplete at this point, but I'm working on it. I want to get feedback on everything so far before going further.\n I can't recommend Okapi for production projects yet, but I've successfully been using it for small, long-running web applications of only a few users without any problems so far.\n Thank you for reading :)\n    submitted by    /u/MonadicSystems  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I was playing with the Brick terminal UI library and hit an interesting hurdle. Roughly, brick represents the program logic as two functions Event -> State -> IO State and State -> Image.\n I have some non-trivial IO (loading and parsing files, possibly transitively) which should not block key inputs. We can launch some async IO and send the results into an event queue which Brick reads from. But it is really annoying:\n  \nThe update function must know which async resources to load, duplicating parts of the rendering logic\n The update function must track which resources are already loaded\n The update function must track which requests are in-flight, or have failed\n Optionally, the update function may have to cancel requests that are no longer needed\n  \nThat's quite a bit of complexity for a simple update function! My approach so far has been Haxl-like. There is a function CoreState -> IO AppState which is run after every event is processed, and it re-loads all resources. Requests are represented by a GADT, and cached in an MVar wrapped map. A functionsend :: MonadAsync r m => r a -> m (Maybe a) retrieves the existing result, or starts a new request unless one is in flight. When a request finishes this queues an event so Brick updates.\n This solves some of the complexity issues but still feels kind of ad-hoc. Shouldn't Haskell be better at this sort of thing? Is there some existing approach to this?\n The only idea I had so far is some kind of declarative IO. The render function produces an Image, and the frame-work diffs images and produces some imperative commands to synchronize the world. Maybe the render function also could produce a sort-of free-monad trace, the trace is diffed, and the framework performs some imperative steps to ensure the minimal necessary requests are performed? But for diffing to work trace would have to contain which case-statement branches were taken, not sure how to do that without compiler support.\n    submitted by    /u/Tarmen  \n [link]   [comments]",

But I don't fully understand how the type signatures work, or when to use a vs b in polymorphic signatures. \n For example, I can define a typeclass\n  class Foo a where prev :: a -> a next :: a -> a \n But I don't understand how that would differ from the same typeclass defined as:\n class Foo a where prev :: a -> b next :: b -> a \n To put this another way, I'm fairly sure I understand the theory, but I don't know how to apply it very well.\n (All that said, I'm loving my time with learning haskell.

While writing each of these I realized there was a lot of similarity in the code to the point that it almost felt like the same thing three times. I realized if I was working in Prolog I could probably express this as typed(term, type, errorList) and then I could get supply a term and a type to see if if type checks, a term and an empty error list to infer the type, and a type and an empty error list to get program synthesis. It would be nice to be able to express this relation in Haskell with a similar style and elegance but I'm not sure if it's possible since I'm not sure if I can do logic programming with similar levels of optimizations in Haskell. logict doesn't seem to do any kind of optimization and I'm guessing this would make my code unusable in practice.\n Is my assumption that logic programming without optimizations is unusable in practice correct?

This plugin basically goes against the design of type classes but sometimes that is what we want. One safe use of this technique is to branch on extra-functional properties such as space, time, energy like choosing HashSet a if Hashable a is satisfied.\n But let's not only stick to safe use cases, what application can you think of for this plugin??\n    submitted by    /u/Iceland_jack  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "We are very happy to announce the release of Copilot 3.11. Copilot is a runtime verification system implemented as a Haskell DSL that generates hard-realtime C99. You can learn more about it at [1].\n Copilot 3.11 introduces a new library, copilot-interpreter, that isolates all functions related to simulation of Copilot specifications. The release also contains a number of bug fixes, provides a simplified API, deprecates outdated elements, removes unused code, and introduces support for GHC 9.2. A full list of changes merged is available at [2].\n A substantial effort is being made to achieve NASA's Class D software classification, most notably in terms of development process (which you can partly witness in how issues and PRs are being handled on our github repo), test coverage (mostly with quickcheck), and proofs of correctness of the generated code (with what4).\n Copilot is being used by the Safety-Critical Avionics Systems Branch (D320) of NASA Langley Research Center to conduct experiments related to flight safety of aerial vehicles. We have also built Ogma [3], a tool that allows us to generate full monitoring applications (e.g., NASA's Core Flight System [4] and Robot Operating System [5] applications) from requirements in structured natural language.\n We invite you all to explore Copilot, to try it, and to extend it. If you like it, please help us draw attention to this work with a star on github or a mention online.\n Happy Haskelling,\n The Copilot Team\n [1] https://github.com/Copilot-Language/copilot\n [2] https://github.com/Copilot-Language/copilot/milestone/15?closed=1\n [3] https://github.com/nasa/ogma\n [4] https://cfs.gsfc.nasa.gov/\n [5] https://www.ros.org/\n    submitted by    /u/ivanpd  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Some weeks ago, I asked here, if there is a way to let GHC infer backwards constraints from instance declaration, i. e. for instance  instance (A a) => B a where  have not only forall a. A a => B a, but also forall a. B a => A a. It's correct, provided that we have no overlapping instance for B. In answers there were a link to an article on this topic. However, implementation from the article requires essential changes in GHC. I found some way to make this with currently available extensions (mostly type families) with not so much boilerplate and now uploaded it on github with my solution for the first problem from the \"Motivation\" section of the paper.\n However, I think, it's not quite natural. If this method is general enough and can be automated, it seems me very nice to have an GHC plugin or even GHC extension to make this without any hacks in code. For example, such syntax of class declaration:  class {-# BIDIRECTIONAL #-} A a where  will make all instance of this class bidirectional (and forbids overlaps).\n What do you think about it? More concrete questions: - are there any other (beside this article) conversations about this feature? - does this feature sound reasonable enough to implement it? - what are disadvantages of using bidirectional instances, besides it conflicts with overlappable instances? are the overlappable instances for most of classes (for example common classes from base) really used in haskell?\n I ask this to gather more pros&cons for this feature. If it will considered to be useful enough, maybe I'll try to implement it. Anyway, it's nice for me to learn more opinions about this.\n    submitted by    /u/Lev_135  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Just curious: If you've played around with several FP languages (especially typed), how do you think Scala compares with them? What is similar and what is different? \n Some context: \n I've been on a programming language exploration journey for the last year or so and I'm trying to learn as many FP languages as I can. I've looked into Haskell, the various Lisps/Schemes, F#, Ocaml, Elm, Rust, etc.... Racket (a Scheme) and the ML-based languages (F#, Ocaml) have been my favorites so far, though they're also not without their weaknesses. Racket and OCaml are both fantastic languages (I found myself favoring the latter due to the type system), but kinda suffer from having a relatively small ecosystem -- and in the case of Ocaml, rather poor tooling. F# offers a much better ecosystem, and in fact it's the language I've used the most (I love ADTs). There's also something very elegant about the ML syntax, even though F# lacks some of the more interesting features of OCaml. One non-trivial weakness of F#, imo, is that eventually you're going to have to resort to some (or sometimes a lot) non-FP/OOP code due to its ties with the C# and the .NET environment. And that can be a drag.\n I've also tried a little Clojure, and it's a nice enough language (happy not to have to deal with Java), though I can't say that I'm in love with it. Overall, it just seems like a less elegant Scheme, and I don't see much of a reason to use it over something like Racket/Scheme, except for maybe the larger collection of libraries that are available on the JVM (OK, the hot reloading feature is also neat, but not something I necessarily care about).\n    submitted by    /u/jmhimara  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I've put together the first release (0.0.1) for echopraxia-plusakka, a structured logging module that adds structured logging mapping for Akka components -- Actor(Ref|Path|System|Context) etc -- and also adds some type enrichment and utility classes to expose loggers intuitively.\n https://github.com/tersesystems/echopraxia-plusakka\n Note that this doesn't go through LoggingAdapter, Akka's internal logging pipeline. Everything run through LoggingAdapter was processed into a String, so you couldn't represent data in two different formats depending on the appender -- in Echopraxia, argument serialization is deferred, so you can have logfmt on console and JSON on the backend. \n This also means you don't have to rely on MDC or the built-in toString methods in Akka any more. Probably the biggest relief is being able to map ByteString to {length=11 utf8String=some string} so it has binary/text data available.\n Your domain messages in Akka can be handled using automatic derivation, and logging is type safe -- if there's no ToValue mapping, the logging statement just won't compile.\n Hope you like it!\n (Comments about Akka's business license / future are not welcome, please keep it on topic.)\n    submitted by    /u/amazedballer  \n [link]   [comments]",

The libraries are increasingly stable and we're having as much fun working with them as on them these days. 😊\n Indigo 0.14.0\n This release includes many improvements, fixes, and enhancements, but the exciting new feature is timeline animations!\n Even simple animations for title screens used to be very difficult in Indigo, but they now have a dedicated and rather fun solution.\n Release notes: https://github.com/PurpleKingdomGames/indigo/releases/tag/v0.14.0\n (As a bonus, the Roguelike-starterkit has also had a tiny update to keep it inline with Indigo.)\n Tyrian 0.6.0\n Version 0.5.0 rebuilt Tyrian to run on Cats Effect 3 and fs2 from the ground up, but you were locked into using IO, and you couldn't use fs2 directly in your web apps. This release adds...\n  \nThe ability to use fs2 Streams for subscriptions\n Support for ZIO 2.0*\n  \nWe've also added a swathe of other quality-of-life improvements.\n Release notes: https://github.com/PurpleKingdomGames/tyrian/releases/tag/v0.6.0\n (\\ You'll need to use a snapshot of the interop-cats library until the next release, but it works just fine. See the release notes.)*\n Getting Started\n You can get started with either project with their g8 templates:\n https://github.com/PurpleKingdomGames/indigo.g8\n https://github.com/PurpleKingdomGames/tyrian.g8\n ...or by heading over to the awesome: https://scribble.ninja/\n Documentation can be found at https://indigoengine.io/ and https://tyrian.indigoengine.io/.\n As always, please report any issues, and if you need any help, do come and say hello on Discord.\n https://discord.gg/b5CD47g\n    submitted by    /u/davesmith00000  \n [link]   [comments]",

And many apologies if I've mischaracterised anything - it's certainly not my intent to express \"rights or wrongs\" - the motivation here is that we have to teach our software classes about ethics and security, and this seemed a very interesting (and fairly accessible) case study to introduce that topic to a class where I've mostly been talking about code, testing, version control etc. Using a library that I taught some of the students last trimester.\n Posted also because it's an admission of why I've been replying in the comments more than usual on this even though I'm just some unheard-of academic in a small town - I had a class to write, so had to think about the topic more than usual last week.\n So this is me doing a first take on trying to introduce the social impacts of dependencies to a (small) Australian class. Feedback welcome, especially if I've mischaracterised anything so I can correct it for the future. [But even comments like \"you really should stop saying 'kind of' as a verbal tic so often\" welcome]\n (PS: I'll probably delete this reddit post after a month or two, so that years down the track, some old lecture of mine isn't lurking in public. Maybe sooner if it turns out I've accidentally made a big faux pas anywhere in here!)\n    submitted by    /u/lecturerIncognito  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "At the beginning of 2022, we decided to get rid of Akka at work and built our own alternative to the last bit of Akka that didn't have a good alternative: sharding (more details on our motivations and architecture choices in a talk I'm planning to do later this year).\n After 6 months in production we decided to release it as an open source library called Shardcake: https://github.com/devsisters/shardcake (it was coincidentally made public a few hours before the Akka licence change announcement).\n In a nutshell, Shardcake makes it easy to distribute entities across multiple servers and interact with those entities using their ID without knowing their actual location (the entity behavior and persistence is entirely up to you, the library only takes care of the distribution and messaging). It exposes a purely functional API based on ZIO. It was designed to be simple to use, lightweight (unlike Akka, nodes do not form a cluster) and customizable: you can change the messaging protocol, the serialization, the storage layer as well as the source of truth for pod's health.\n It's been working great for us, so I hope others find it useful!\n    submitted by    /u/ghostdogpr  \n [link]   [comments]",

Right now a lot of my code is just these match statements. The two popular use cases for the Try are \"propagate error or return value\" as in the example and the second one that I have in a lot of cases is \"wrap and propagate error or return value\", i.e. the same but with a different `Throwable`\n    submitted by    /u/superdupermicrochip  \n [link]   [comments]",

For this I use doom emacs.\n I've seen that with markup markers such as \"*\" (bold) and \"/\" (italics), org-hide-emphasis-markers allows for showing the effect in the text while getting rid of the cumbersome markers. Moreover, when the point is within markers, they show so one can edit them.\n I was wondering if it is possible to do the same with LaTeX environments like \"\\begin{equation}\" and \"\\end{equation}\", for instance. I've tried with hide-lines.el, which allows for hiding lines matching a regex (in this case, the regex are, for instance: \"^\\\\begin{[a-z]*}\"). But although this works, it is far from ideal, as one would need to toggle their visibility for editing them, unlike the more practical way that org-emphasis-hide-markers allows for.\n Is there a way to achieve such result? Thanks in advance for all your help.\n Edit:\n To be clear, I would like to enter something like:\n \\begin{equation}\n A = B\n \\end{equation}\n and have emacs hide the first and third lines when away from the region, so that only\n A = B\n shows.

This was also the context in which I realized an org-babel/source block behaviour that I don't understand.\n Frequently, when I want to quickly test how a note looks in html, I run into the error \"unmatched bracket or quote\" which aborts the html export.\n Now, I've started to narrow the initial problem down to a few problematic aspects: apparently, org-babel tries to match \"<>\" and \"' '\", both of which I generally used. However, since the lisp-babel-block doesn't use any of those signs as delimiters, why can't I use them? \n Find below a block of things that I'd like to, but can't, use:\n #+BEGIN_SRC lisp (defvar *my-list* '(a b c)) ; This doesn't work because of ' (second *my-list*) ;; => b ; This doesn't work because of > (mapcar #'list *my-list*) ; This doesn't work because of ' #+END_SRC \n Now that I think of it, I also can't use either of these in regular text, which is pretty annoying.

          "description": "Hi All\n Some experience with org mode, trying to bend code blocks to my will.\n Trying to use org to pass a json file into python script while developing it. I really would like to keep the json highlighting that org-mode provides. \n If I were doing it in bash I might create the file as bash cat > /tmp/args.json <<HERE { \"JSON_HERE\": \"Here is some JSON\" } HERE \n The python script will be written from a template and expects input from a file. If invoked at the command line, the command is python library/my\\_test.py /tmp/args.json\n For the JSON part, I have JSON set up as an org-mode language language and that provides syntax highlighting and pop-out editing, but of course there is nothing to execute. An example block would almost do it, but there is no simple way to save that to a file AFAIK\n For the python part, there is lots of information in the manual as to how to pass in various elisp list, tables, properties etc but all I need is a simple file name. Any ideas how to do that without changing my code?\n Apologies if these are dumb questions.\n Cheers \n Steven.\n    submitted by    /u/zyzygystevieray  \n [link]   [comments]",

This is so that after going to the definition of <<foo-a>> I want a link to click so that I can go back to the discussion for foo-overall and vice versa.\n AFAIK, #1 can be achieved by manually inserting Org refs (e.g. (ref:...) in the src block for foo-overall) as per https://orgmode.org/manual/Literal-Examples.html and then manually inserting a caption for the src blocks of <<foo-a>> and <<foo-b>>. However this is extremely tedious and is basically a deal-breaker for me.\n I've searched around for a solution for #2 and the closest thing I found was this comment. The script there just collects a list of all src blocks and inserts this list as a \"References ...\" note to every src block, which is too verbose.

So, I thought I could tweak the wonderful ox-hugo exporter, which cover most of the needs in the \"org to markdown\" field, being it thought for Hugo (another static site generator which works parsing markdown files). I'm a newbie in emacs lisp, so I'm sure there are more elegant ways to achieve what I did, but my solution was forking ox-hugo (in ox-zola) and hacking it to make it compatible with Zola needs. \n There were some minor differences that made the exported broken, but now it should work by default. More specifically, I added this Zola-relative features:\n  \nCustom frontmatters parameters\n Lastmod/updated tags\n Taxonomies\n  \nI'm already using this library in production for my blog for a while, so I thought this could be the moment to share it with everybody.

Regular latex is rendered fine using mathjax, but mathjax cannot handle TikZ, and probably never will be able to handle TikZ. \n Ox-hugo and ox-html allows one to render latex using something like dvisvgm, however I don't want to use this for general latex equations that can be rendered using mathjax as it generally looks way worse than mathjax, particularly for inline maths. \n Is there anyway to change the latex ox-html/ox-hugo behaviour for a select number of latex fragments, while keeping mathjax for the rest? \n Alternatively, is there anyway I can preview the contents of a #+begin_src latex block? If so, I can stick my complex latex math in the src block and have it exported to svg, but still have my beautiful buffer previews. \n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/chuckie219  \n [link]   [comments]",

Is there any way to update it rather than I also manually change the LAST_REPEAT and next SCHEDULED time?\n For other operations org offers, like breaking down task, if you manually edit the text of checkboxes, you can use #'org-update-check-box-count to make the task progress to be correct. For calculating time interval for a timer, you can have #'org-evaluate-time-range if you directly change the plaintext of the time you start and end a task.\n Is there any similar command for changing the next SCHEDULED time and LAST_REPEAT property?\n    submitted by    /u/FreeAd7233  \n [link]   [comments]",

But in my case it can change from time to time.\n Is there a way to keep the same \"magical\" behavior of string-as-unibyte function, with which I didn’t have to assume a possibly wrong source coding system? Am I correct if I say it’d be the undecided coding system? As in:\n  (base64-encode-string (encode-coding-string (buffer-string) 'undecided) 'no-line-break) \n As I’m reading the whole buffer content, is there a (local) variable holding the current buffer coding system?\n Thank you very much!\n    submitted by    /u/milouse  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I’ve been a Dynalist user for years, as my notes tend to follow a hierarchy, but I’m wanting to transition to org-mode for obvious reasons. When you search a page in Dynalist, you get search results in the context of each parent line (\"parent\" as determined by indentation level). The same goal is accomplished in ogrep.\n Is this type of search possible in emacs? In org-mode, I know there is sparse-tree, but it is not as \"sparse\" as ogrep or Dynalist, giving much more context than I sometimes need. This feature is so valuable to me that I'll have to craft a solution with your suggestions if one doesn’t yet exist.\n    submitted by    /u/jMilton13  \n [link]   [comments]",

Very long time emacs user here with a bunch of elisp under my belt - but this simple problem just eludes me.\n For years, I've done all my testing and running in a compile window.\n Emacs knows error messages that appear in that window, and I can use either M-x next-error to get to the error, or hit return on that line.\n This works pretty well flawlessly for me... but now I have a new tool and only a few of its errors get highlighted this way and I cannot see the difference!\n For example, in the run below, only the second error (fasteners.py) is highlighted and can be reached through next-error or carriage return: see https://imgur.com/a/I6P3egg\n -*- mode: compilation; default-directory: \"/code/engora-search/\" -*- Compilation started at Thu Sep 29 23:34:35 $ TERM=dumb d engora test --refurb engora/network/request/url_request.py:37:13 [FURB126]: Replace `else: return x` with `return x` engora/parser/fasteners.py:107:9 [FURB126]: Replace `else: return x` with `return x` engora/server/search.py:26:13 [FURB126]: Replace `else: return x` with `return x` engora/server/server.py:39:13 [FURB126]: Replace `else: return x` with `return x` Run `refurb --explain ERR` to further explain an error.

I do:  ./configure --with-ns make make install sudo xattr -rds com.apple.quarantine nextstep/Emacs.app  and then move the app bundle to /Applications. But that's not what I'm here to talk about 😃\n When macOS switched to zsh I went through a painful transition. Before then, I had my ns-command-modifier set to meta so M-x would be cmd X for me. With bash, that was ok.\n But zsh opened new possibilities for me and it really wanted the meta on the options key rather than the command key. I honestly don't remember what the pain point was. But in any case, I remapped my emacs to be just the defaults where ns-option-modifier is set to meta and ns-command-modifier is set to super. zsh and emacs have a lot of common abilities so I wanted the key mappings to be the same in both. Rather than twist zsh to accept my unique setup I untwisted my unique emacs setup to be more normal.\n Now, I have an entire set of keys, the \"super\" keys that I've never had easy access to before.\n For example, using tabs in emacs, I can bind s-{ to tab-previous and s-} to tab-next and switch between tabs just like it was Safari. Instead of two key C-c p for Projectile, (they even suggest), one key s-p. I'm mapping s-r to projectile-rails, s-y to Yari, etc.\n It was and still is a bit painful of a transition but it is well worth it.\n    submitted by    /u/pedzsanReddit  \n [link]   [comments]",

Is it possible to somehow set the configuration so that it works only on \"own\" embedded compiler?\n So far, I have been able to work around the problem by removing mingw from the system env path, I write mainly in python and golang, but if I need it again, the problem will come back.\n    submitted by    /u/parasit  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I do not like to set internal-border-with to anything other than 0, because I don't want the mode-line to not extend across the entire frame. So I've been looking for ways of adding a bit of 'padding' to my frame. \n Left and right it's straightforward: simple set the fringe to some suitable width. Top padding is less so. \n I figured I could make use of the header-line for that, and this seemed like a good start:\n (setq header-line-format \" \") \n Now, I found having a whole blank line of padding a bit much (I know...), so I tried specifying the height property in the value of header-line-format directly: \n (setq header-line-format (propertize \" \" 'face '(:height 80))) \n But that doesn't make a difference unless the height property is greater than that of header-line. \n The only way I've found to make the header-line take up less than the default line height is by messing with the height of header-line. Unfortunately, some modes make use of the header-line for displaying stuff, so I find myself having to add hooks to every mode I encounter that does make use of the header-line, e.g.\n (defun my/reset-header-line-face () (face-remap-add-relative 'header-line '(:height 180))) (add-hook 'use-package-statistics-mode-hook 'my/reset-header-line-face) \n Does anyone know or can think of a less ad-hoc solution?\n    submitted by    /u/graduale  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "A few years ago i bought an expensive guitar. I played it for maybe 2 months and one of the strings started producing some ringing. The guitar came with a 5 year warranty. I took it to the shop, they tried to fix it but failed and offered me a new one. I readily accepted the exchange.\n A few months down the line even this guitar had some issues with ringing here and there. You'd be surprised to know that they again gave me a new one.\n Now, onto my third guitar. I started getting a bit better at playing by now (I had already been playing for years but didn't practice everyday until I invested in this guitar) and started understanding some technical details about the guitar, servicing it myself and also some just non technical things. I also saw the guitar Willie Nelson plays (it literally has a gouged hole in it and honestly most people who don't know it would chuck it in garbage).\n I realized that it's a guitar, it's made of wood and in a certain sense is alive. It's not going to be perfect but it's my Guitar. I know how to make it work. I practice on it everyday and I know how to manage those little details.\n You see where I'm going with this? I moved to Emacs a month ago. Objectively, it might be the worse choice compared to my setup on VSCode but it's my editor. Sure they'd be some jank and some small errors and bugs I can't fix but I can always service it myself. I can always make it better. I'd learn with it and grow with it.\n    submitted by    /u/_analysis230_  \n [link]   [comments]",

This should play well with cooperative threading. So out of curiosity, I tried\n (make-thread (lambda () (gnus-group-get-new-news)) \"Gnus Get News\") \n Guess what -- it works! It does the work in the background without blocking emacs, and update the *Group* buffer once it's done.\n Surprisingly I didn't find anything similar online. I wonder have anyone experimented similiar techiques with more heavy usage? I have no idea how robust this is -- I could be very lucky with nnreddit, its source code has a bunch of with-mutex. I guess that suggests it's written with concurrency in mind? But it doesn't really use any concurrency out of the box, really puzzling...\n P.S.

I'm not here to ask for suggestion or any kind of comparison between the two, don't worry. What I'd like to know is whether org-mode could be useful for a specific use case, which could make me lean towards doom emacs rather than neovim.\n From time to time I have to write documentation for software packages at work. While doing so, we like to have both a pdf version (using latex) to hand to our customers and an html (or similar) version to be stored inside the git repository of the project. To avoid having to write two different docs, we initially used markdown and a custom pandoc filter (for headings, frontpages and whatnot). The problem is that this approach is very limiting when it comes to cross-referencing, captions, and tables with cells spanning multiple columns or rows. Hence we switched to RMarkdown, but having to write R code for the sole purpose of properly handling a few images and tables is very frustrating.\n Do you think that org-mode could be used to solve the problem once and for all? I know that tables in org-mode are pretty powerful, but I don't know to which extent. Nor if the same syntax would be correctly translated both in latex and html as it is with simpler tables.\n Also, if any of you uses org-mode to write scientific papers (hence using different latex templates from different journals) in the STEMs, I'd like to hear your impressions.\n    submitted by    /u/nickfaraco  \n [link]   [comments]",

Before I started using emacs I thought wtf does that even mean? I don't care what else it can do. I have everything else exactly how I want it, I just need a text editor. \n For whatever reason, I made the switch from VSCode to Doom Emacs about 20 days ago. I knew vim keybindings and stuff already but I didn't use them on a day-to-day basis only on servers that didn't have anything else. I did pick up the evil keybindings quickly and after 2-3 days of installation and setup woes, my javascript editing environment was set up rather well. I started relying on vim-fu for code editing and it's so much more enjoyable (don't know if it's faster yet) than using a mouse. \n That made me want more modal-based stuff, I wanted my browser to have modal navigation. While I'd never switch to the emacs browser I installed vimium on my chrome and it works rather well. Now, I started thinking it'd be so nice to have a file manager that was keyboard-focused and da-dum-tusss, the penny dropped.

It works from the command line so if you invoke sops on and encrypted file it will decrypt it, open the decrypted version on a temp file (located in /tmp/<random-digits>) on your $EDITOR and then re-encrypt everything and delete the temp file once you close the $EDITOR.\n Currently I invoke sops on vterm which opens an new emacsclient instance where I edit my file. I thought wouldn't it be cool if emacs could auto recognize if a file is encrypted with sops and decrypt it on the same buffer. \n Now the only thing I am having a hard time understanding is how you would go about redirecting sops to open a new buffer instead of whatever your $EDITOR is.\n    submitted by    /u/JoeKazama  \n [link]   [comments]",

Specifically, I'm running into issues when using tcell. Here's an example snippet to show what I mean:\n package main import ( \"github.com/gdamore/tcell/v2\" ) func main() { tcell.[cursor goes here - `completion-at-point`] } \n If completion-at-point is run at the position noted above, emacs locks up for several seconds. Based on a profiler report I ran, the lock up appears to happen at common-lisp-indent-function, but I can't find any evidence online that this is an expensive or slow function... I'm a little bit at a loss at how to fix this. Ideally I'd like to just disable indenting around whatever's happening here (since it's happening somewhere deep in the json rpc call). Can anyone else reproduce this problem, or has anyone else seen it?\n Edit: figured I'd mention that this problem disappears with lsp-mode, so I guess I'll be using that for the time being.\n    submitted by    /u/chopu  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Lets say I want Calc to understand a TeX formula like $\\int_a^b f(x) \\mathrm{d} x$. Clearly, there are many ways to write this, I could have just written \"d\" instead of \"\\mathrm\", the integral bounds could be just a single lower index indicating a region, \"f(x)\" could actually consist of derivatives with the same differential notation as \"d x\", etc. If I could use Backus-Naur form, I would define a non-terminal like\n INTEGRAL := \"\\\\int\" REGION INTEGRAND DIFFERENTIAL DUMMY_VAR\n and then individually handle all of these edge cases in each non-terminal. For instance, I could write REGION to accept empty patterns for indefinite integrals, or to accept just a subscript for regions, similarly for DIFFERENTIAL or INTEGRAND. Instead, in Calc, I have to write a messy rewrite rule to just handle the REGION part, and I am not even sure if the INTEGRAND symbol could be implemented since any integrand having terms that look like $\\frac{d f}{d x}$ would prematurely terminate parsing as the denominator would be interpreted as DIFFERENTIAL. It seems to me that Calc is formally incapable of handling these complications, but I may be wrong. Are there ways within calc to implemen the functinality I want? If not, are there libraries that allow me to augment Calc in this way?

When called wrapped within with-current-notmuch-show-messsage, you get a list of mm-handle objects defining the different parts of the mail viewed. To save the part, you can use mm-save-part-to-file.

I am doing some weird stuff with cached git statuses and I may be rendering an SVG icon for god mode. I do have god-mode on by default.\n I'm guessing that somewhere in the background lurks a billion ever-exapanding buffers, temporary or otherwise, that are needing to eval their git project status and render an svg icon.\n Anyway, at this point I'd like to distill my modeline down into simple, colorized text.

Is this something that can be done somewhat straightforwardly?\n Secondly, currently I have the following tangle instructions on each input file: :tangle (org-in-tangle-dir \"file.txt\"). The filename to tangle to is identical to the #+name: file.txt preceding the block. The org-in-tangle-dir function is defined as follows:\n (defun org-in-tangle-dir (sub-path) \"Expand the SUB-PATH into the directory given by the tangle-dir property if that property exists, else use the `default-directory'.\" (expand-file-name sub-path (or (org-entry-get (point) \"tangle-dir\" 'inherit) (default-directory)))) \n Is there any way to tell the tangle to use the #+name attribute as filename to tangle to?\n Thanks for any help\n    submitted by    /u/Foo-jin  \n [link]   [comments]",

But most (all?) of them keep keybindings similar to the original ones.\n Personally, I'd like keybindings to be oriented at the things which the commands operate on, e.g. server, frame, window, project, directory, file, block, region, line, word, cursor. I'd love to have an elisp package which allows me to dedicate a key for each of these things, e.g. I'd dedicate \"a\" to \"server\" because with my current keyboard-layout, I type \"a\" with my pinky which I don't want to use so often and because I don't expect Emacs-server related commands to be called often. I could then type C-a and thus get access to many server-related commands, e.g. I could call \"server-start\" with C-a s. Then there'd be some easy mechanism to enter and stay in hydras, so that you don't need to type the prefix every time. E.g., the SPC key could toggle that behavior.

I never connected to this machine before, so it certainly has no ssh keys from me. In fact the WSL I was doing this from didn't even have a ssh Gen generated. \n Using Tramp in emacs with C-x C-f /ssh:x.y.z.ip:/ it asks me for a password.

Rather than be in separate floating program windows in your DE though, tmux windows are not visible until you cycle to them. So your setup might look like:\n  ________________ _________________ | | | | | | | | | | vim | node | | st | python | -> :next-window -> |________|________| | | | | | | | | | | watch | ranger | |_______|________| |________|________| \n Is there any way to get this functionality (multiple buffers laid out in different ways in one wm box that can be cycled through) in emacs?

Once for the kanji, and twice for it's reading. Is there any way to improve my function?\n    submitted by    /u/Hiorig  \n [link]   [comments]",

(From what I understand, upon first starting the server, display-graphic-p returns nil.)\n The workaround that seems to be doing the trick is to add the above to server-after-make-frame-hook. (I tried adding the above to after-init-hook but it doesn't seem to work, and some poking around suggests that when the functions in after-init-hook are run when the server starts, display-graphic-p also returns nil.)\n Now, there are other things I want to run only when starting a new GUI session, so I've kept on adding things to server-after-make-frame-hook. \n Not knowing very much about the way all of this works, I keep thinking this is inefficient. For it seems that server-after-make-frame-hook gets called more often than just when I start what, on my end, looks like a new session: calling magit-commit, for example, will run all of the functions in that hook. \n So, what I'm looking for is some tips on how to activate some bits of my config in all and only the following circumstances: when a new GUI frame is opened but no other GUI frames are. \n One solution I would be happy with, but which I cannot figure out how to create, is to have a GUI dedicated daemon and another daemon, if needed, for terminal sessions. I'd then need to have a way of triggering some bits of my config only when the dedicated GUI daemon starts. \n Sorry if this a bit muddled.

I use helm and use helm actions heavily to accomplish things within a completion session (e.g. moving files, grepping). However, the more I use it, the more I think: it would be much better if it's a full dired!\n I like the multiple column view of `helm-buffers-list`. It in fact just imitates the native `list-buffers`, but in a pretty hacky way (it use spaces to pad each completion items to make it look like a table). I've written my own `describe-functions` and `describe-variables` sources that uses similar hack to give me a column of function argument list/variable value and documentation. It would be much better if we just use `tabulated-list-mode`, or some blend of it and the native `*Apropos*` buffer!\n In general I feel like lots of functionalities are implemented twice, once as a \"feature-full\" package, once as a simplified version in helm.\n My question is then: Is there any completion framework based on the idea of wrapping \"feature-full\" package out there? Do you think this is a sensible idea?\n I haven't looked much into other popular completion frameworks (ivy, vertico, etc), because I get the impression that they're typically at the more \"light-weight\" side of helm so are probably not what I want.

Now I am ready to bring my girlfriend into this hole, but now I have several problems as follows.\n  \nMy girlfriend uses a windows computer, and I have not used a windows computer for six or seven years except to play games, so I don't know how to configure it under windows at all. emacs is known to have a relatively average experience under windows.\n \nI am using doom emacs, except for the most basic operations such as C-bpfnaehk which are adapted by macOS as global shortcuts, I do not know the native shortcuts of emacs at all. My girlfriend had a slight experience with vim, mainly because I introduced her the vim mode in rstudio, she knows yiw, ci} stuffs like basic operation, but she usually mainly uses office, vim mode is just rarely used, and not skilled.\n So if I introduce it to the pit, I'm not sure to introduce her to install the classic vanilla emacs (surely a distribution that uses vanilla keybindings, such as centaur? or the vanilla version of doom?) Do you guys think it's better to let someone who knows a little bit about vim but is not very skilled use vim mode, or let her learn emacs' weird ancient vanilla shortcuts?\n \nFinally, a broad context question, do you guys have any suggestions for smoothing out the introductory curve for someone with little computer background (or even little programming background) to use emacs?\n \n Thanks for your help and I would be much appreciated it for any help and advice!\n    submitted by    /u/FreeAd7233  \n [link]   [comments]",

If PAGE is nil, convert the whole document.\" (doc-view-multiplex-conversion (lambda (tiff callback &optional resolution) (doc-view-start-process \"djvu->tiff\" \"ddjvu\" `(\"-format=tiff\" ;; ddjvu only accepts the range 1-999. ,(format \"-scale=%d\" (round (or resolution doc-view-resolution))) ;; -eachpage was only added after djvulibre-3.5.25.3! ,@(unless page '(\"-eachpage\")) ,@(if page `(,(format \"-page=%d\" page))) ,djvu ,tiff) callback) tiff callback))) \n The problem is that tiff callback are enclosed within the lambda and not part of the funcall to doc-view-multiplex-conversion. Applying this change fixes the problem for me.\n Interestingly, upon checking the [https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs/blob/emacs-28/lisp/doc-view.el](doc-view file) at emacs 28 github mirror, they are slightly different definitions, where the mac-port has wrapped it with doc-view-multiplex-conversion.\n Naturally I could not find any place to raise this issue. Because firstly, I am not very used to usingreport-emacs-bug and the mailing list. Secondly, this is related to Emacs mac port not exactly Emacs (see my point just above). So here I am, wonder what actions I could take to make this get noticed and fixed.\n    submitted by    /u/1nc0ns1st3nt  \n [link]   [comments]",

I did some investigation, created a stackoverflow issue (https://emacs.stackexchange.com/q/72769/38541), got help from the org-mode mailing list and eventually created a bug in the evil-repository for what I guess is the root issue for the behaviour (https://github.com/emacs-evil/evil/issues/1642).\n It's been a bit more than a month now, and nothing has happened, yet the problem persist for me, even with the latest versions of evil and org-mode. However I can imagine that a lot of users use both, evil and tables in org-mode. And as a consequence, more people should stumble upon \"my\" issue and report or support it. So that makes me wonder if there is indeed something wrong in my configuration.\n As you can see in the stackoverflow issue, there is not a lot minimal configuration needed to reproduce the issue. But could there be any other package, configuration, switch, whatsoever that I could add in my configuration that would solve the issue?\n So my question is: Am I missing something here? Is this actually a problem on my side? Or do other people suffer the same problem, but it has not caught traction yet?\n    submitted by    /u/cgrabenstein  \n [link]   [comments]",

If I close Emacs and then start it up again, the startup time usually decreases to around 5 s, but then it increases back to 8–10 s after I put my computer to sleep. The really curious thing about this is that whenever I try to run esup or a similar profiler, the problem goes away entirely: Emacs starts near-instantly, and the profiler consistently reports around 3.5 s startup time (all of which is straightforwardly due to my init.el). I can find nothing else obvious which might be causing this delay — and, before you ask, I can’t quite remember when the problem started. Does anyone have any other ideas whatsoever as to what might be causing this or how I might be able to fix it?\n (For reference, my .emacs.d is at https://github.com/bradrn/.emacs.d/blob/bef9de6ad27e214fa5972ed220d839721d8febca/init.el; I am using Emacs 28.1 on Windows 10, without native compilation.)\n    submitted by    /u/brdrcn  \n [link]   [comments]",

It supports poetry, pre-commit, pipenv, pipx, pyenv, direnv, plain old virtualenv and pdm, and assigns the correct executable paths to buffer local variables of your favorite emacs packages. It also works for repos that use one or combinations of these tools.\n I hope I can help you delete a bunch of code and dotfiles from your init.el and projects!\n https://github.com/wyuenho/emacs-pet/\n    submitted by    /u/wyuenho  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello, folks. I started learning Emacs and Elisp about a week ago and it's been a blast.\n I just started adding a handful of simple functions and key bindings to open MPlayer in \"slave\" mode and control it by piping commands through a named pipe (FIFO). On opening, all of MPlayer's output is sent to the *Async Shell Command* buffer.\n The key-bound functions simply use the builtin \"shell-command\" to echo MPlayer commands to /tmp/mplayerfifo just as you would from Bash:\n echo \"pause\" > /tmp/mplayerfifo echo \"get_time_pos > /tmp/mplayerfifo \n I have no use for the output when I'm simply controlling the video, but the output of commands like \"get_time_pos\" are printed out at the bottom of *Async Shell Command* and I would really like to stuff them in a variable. In short, how might I grab the content of *Async Shell Command* while working in a different buffer? I can work out transforming the text, I just need to get my hands on it. Also, could I clear that buffer after each command?\n    submitted by    /u/Either_Consequence90  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "So, I cannot afford to switch to emacs for my day job (full-stack dev) and take the productivity hit, but I would like to give this emacs thingy a try for fun and start learning. Eventually I want to try to use it for coding (with new for me stuff like lisp and clojure or even with my current stack).\n So is there some resource online where I can explore 'cool' things to try in emacs?\n Specifically:\n  \nare there any 'packages' that I must have, that promote learning the commands and key bindings and exploring? e.g. autocomplete, suggestions, recovering from errors, docs etc.\n any pointers on how to do FS navigation in emacs? any must-have packages to help with that\n any pointers on how to do theming? Ideally, to just use some nice theme, with good defaults, not looking for customization at this point. (watched some youtube videos where orgmode looked so much better than mine)\n is theming done per major/minor mode or based on packages or something else?\n any pointers on getting started with org-mode? I am going through orgmode.org rn and got somewhat familiar with the syntax. I am trying to evaluate it and I don't see the value yet. do i need any plugins for it?\n I am confused with the package managers and the options you have and how to import. Is there some rule of thumb I can follow that can help me simplify adding packages? I don't need 'options' right now, I need a 'do it this way, it gets you to 90%'\n I was watching some videos and saw this https://github.com/daviwil/dotfiles/blob/master/Emacs.org, which is HUUUGE. Is there some other resource that I can just start with one piece/package at a time and keep adding more slowly?\n  \nSorry if this was posted before (it must have, I guess, but not recently), but I am after some specific things. I need someone to take me by the hand cause this thing is deep and wide and I feel lost.\n Also apologies for the long post. ANY feedback is much appreciated!\n    submitted by    /u/DryNick  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Many people mistakenly credit Niklas Luhmann with the invention of the zettelkasten method, so I’ve been delving into historical note taking practices. I’ve recently come across a well known and influential book on historical method from the late 1800s that has well described version of the slip (box) method.\nOriginally published in French in 1897 as Introduction aux études historiques and then translated into English by George Godfrey Berry, Henry Holt and Company published Introduction to the Study of History in 1898 by authors Charles Victor Langlois and Charles Seignobos. Along with Ernst Bernheim’s popular Lehrbuch der historischen Methode mit Nachweis der wichtigsten Quellen und Hülfsmittelzum Studium der Geschichte (Leipzig: Duncker & Humblot, 1889), Langlois and Seignobos’ text is …",

I honestly read the posts here and in reddit (till 3 am sometimes).\nI post now because I can't find definite answers.\nFor the longest time I have been adamant in trying to make my Zettelkasten work in my profession and so far I've been using it to:\nBut I just feel like I haven't truly gotten the potential output I can get from the system.\nI know that Zettelkasten is geared towards writing and not necessarily visual output but I just want to ask advice on how to implement the system to maximize output for non-writing purposes. Am I doing something wrong or am I applying Zettelkasten to something it wasn't meant to do?\nLooking forward to interacting with all you more (hopefully, my introversion won't get the better of me.)",
