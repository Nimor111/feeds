          "description": "I've been working to understand the theory behind algebraic effects, with the understanding that that's what Polysemy's based on. I'm starting to think I'm fundamentally confused. \n Following through citations (Polysemy cites Kiselyov and Ishii, who cite Kammar, Lindley, and Oury, who cite various papers by Plotkin and Pretnar) strongly suggests that \"extensible effects\" are just a rebranding of \"algebraic effects\", and that equational reasoning gets left out of implementations because that's more practical (but Polysemy's trying to add it back?). Is this a good understanding of the situation?\n Similarly, in Petnar's representations of algebraic effects (e.g.), it's quite important that the handlers have access to the computation's continuation, and get to decide how it's used. I haven't been able to find any support for this in Polysemey, but everything's phrased so differently it's difficult to search. \n Any suggestions for bridging the gap between theory and practice, or for quickly getting up to speed on the last twenty years of research in this area?\n    submitted by    /u/ShapeOfMatter  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "A new release of fakedata has been released: https://github.com/fakedata-haskell/fakedata\n Brief Summary of what fakedata is: It's a library for producing fake data such as names, addresses and phone numbers.\n The changelog contains the list of changes in this release: https://github.com/fakedata-haskell/fakedata/releases/tag/v1.0\n Note that this release contains breaking change. I have documented it with more detail in the changelog entry. The most interesting one is making Fake type as a transformer which allows writing efficient code more easily. This was done by Isaac Van Bakel and more details are here: https://github.com/fakedata-haskell/fakedata#using-the-faket-transformer\n The current release also adds various new modules (+ 15), locale improvements and contains updates to fake data sources. Also, the test suite has been enhanced which helped me find bugs in the upstream Ruby data sources (Corresponding fix: https://github.com/faker-ruby/faker/pull/2339) . And thanks to Tristan de Cacqueray for fixing the test failure issues related to random 1.2.0 as part of ZuriHac.\n The following packages can be used to create generators out of fakedata:\n * quickcheck integration by Jappie Klooster: https://github.com/fakedata-haskell/fakedata-quickcheck\n * hedgehog integration by Matt Parsons: https://github.com/parsonsmatt/hedgehog-fakedata\n    submitted by    /u/sibip  \n [link]   [comments]",

That's because I posted about a vacancy we had back in October. Since then, we've hired two new developers, but we're still expanding!\n Chordify is a music platform that you can use to automatically detect the chords in any song you like. This way we help musicians to play all of their favourite music in an easy and intuitive way. You can try it at https://chordify.net\n Now, the backend for our website and apps, that are used by millions of people worldwide, is written in Haskell! We serve the user using primarily Servant, Persistent and Esqueleto. We also have a custom Redis caching layer and use an advanced Cloud Haskell setup to distribute our chord analysis computations.\n We are quickly becoming an autonomous workforce, meaning there is pretty much no hierarchy, and we are looking to expand our fast-growing team with a pro-active, independent and creative functional programmer to further improve Chordify. You'd get the opportunity to work with advanced type systems to power a website that serves millions.\n More information and a form to apply can be found at https://jobs.chordify.net. If you have any questions, feel free to ask them in this thread, or reach out to me at [rik@chordify.net](mailto:rik@chordify.net).\n We strive for diversity in our team, and encourage people of all backgrounds and genders to apply.\n One more thing, this is explicitly NOT a remote job.

So for example, I started with a function for working with indices and counts of elements.\n ```\n indicesRemaining :: Cnt -> Idx -> [Idx]\n indicesRemaining cnt idx = <some-implentation>\n ```\n and say I've renamed the types to be clearer, using a global find-replace:\n ```\n indicesRemaining :: BlockCnt -> BlockIdx -> [BlockIdx]\n indicesRemaining cnt idx = <some-implementation>\n ```\n this is great, but I'd like to also update cnt and idx, to be blkCnt and blkIdx, for example. I can do in manually, but I've done a load of refactorings, so have a load of these.\n What I am looking for is a tool that can run over my code-base, and spurt out a list of types, and all the different variables names used by that type. So, if I have the following code:\n ``` indicesRemaining :: BlockCnt -> BlockIdx -> [BlockIdx]\n indicesRemaining blkCnt blkIdx = <some-implementation>\n indexWithinCnt :: BlockCnt -> BlockIdx -> Bool\n indexWithinCnt cntMax idx = <some-implementation>\n ```\n Then, I am looking for something like the following output:\n ``` BlockCnt : blkCnt, cntMax\n BlockIdx : blkIdx, idx\n ```\n And I can then go through and manually review cases where lots of different names exist for the same thing.\n Is anyone aware whether something like this already exists? If not, I was wondering if HIE would be a good tools to build something like this on top of??\n Best wishes, and thanks in advance.\n Mike\n    submitted by    /u/Plane-Finger  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi all, I have a new notation for rendering function application and composition at the type level. It may make some Haskell concepts clearer and may be useful for expressing other things such as complicated logical combinators\n The change is simple, just write the function result type on a 3-D plate and have the function argument type orbit it--hence the term orbit diagram. It's rendered in orthographic perspective. Something about the extra dimension and the clear difference between domain and codomain make it easier to see what's going on when function types get complicated. In particular it helped me grasp the Yoneda lemma and continuation-passing style better\n More info in the readme and some examples can be found in the following repo:\n https://github.com/jasonincanada/orbit-diagrams\n    submitted by    /u/nirgle  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I want to get better at the language, and the way to achieve that (that makes the most sense to me) is to apply for a job to be trained. So I've been job hunting for Haskell positions. \n Naturally, I got rejected from most of the applications. I'm expecting to get rejected in all, tbh. Getting rejected doesn't bother me though since I'm pretty new to Haskell anyway. This is pretty much the only expected outcome.\n Anyway, I'm more concerned with how I can get my first step through an internship. It (internship) appears to be non-existent in the Haskell industry, which it makes it difficult to get some really good hands-on training with the proper learning environment. So with that, it seems like internship is pretty much impossible. I noticed a common expectation among the rejection messages that I'm expected to have more experience with the language. But getting this experience is rather difficult, and I don't really see a clear path to obtain a decent enough experience with it.\n I'm wondering: \n  \nDo personal projects hold any weight in the deliberation process?\n Is contributing to Haskell OSS the only/better way for people to validate that I know something?\n Do I just work for free?\n How do I know what I'm doing isn't a bad approach without anyone there to program with or to act as a mentor? I'm pretty much alone in self-learning. I tried streaming but it's sometimes very distracting, and really daunting.\n  \nThis post isn't meant to gather pity from others, please don't pity me! I just want to know what I should focus on doing exactly to get a much better chance next time, since this entire thing feels like a chicken and egg situation. If you're a business owner, or an employee in a company that uses Haskell in your company, any insight would be much appreciated!\n Thank you\n    submitted by    /u/imsekun  \n [link]   [comments]",

In this case I chose to show how to process streamed binary satellite data and build a Haskell application for this. This starts with basic things like network connections, conduits, goes over logging, config file handling, command line parsing to parsing the binary ground- and space-protocols involved, threading (for parallel processing chains), STM and finally displaying the results in a graphical user interface (with GTK). \n This also can serve as an introduction to the AURIS mission control system I am writing in Haskell (on ZuriHac and MuniHac there was some demand for more explanations as the project is a bit intimidating and requires some domain knowledge). So I thought I could combine this and provide some insight into this domain, while showing how such an application could work in Haskell. \n Each video builds on its predecessor.

          "description": "Compilers for languages such as Rust have seen great success in giving each compiler error a unique error code such as E0119. The code can easily be looked up in official documentation and referred to in forums, StackOverflow, etc.. There is work underway which could lead to the same functionality in GHC.\n I wondered whether there's a particularly strong reason for numeric error codes as opposed to human readable identifiers. For example, would conflicting_trait_implementations be a more useful error code than E0119? None of the reasons given in the discussion for avoiding readable error codes rang true for me, and, surprisingly to me, no one at all supported readable error codes.\n Are my instincts completely out of tune on this issue, or would readable error codes have some benefit over numeric ones?\n    submitted by    /u/tomejaguar  \n [link]   [comments]",

My main build tool is Stack so using stack build --fast works just fine, while running stack build (using -O2) does causes the hang up. Some of the suggested comments from the similar posts say to sprinkle in some {- OPTIONS_GHC -O1 -} on the offending files to allow it compile. However, I can't seem to find the right one to use it on. \n My question is: How do I debug this compiler issue? My terminal always hangs up after it prints [ 9 of 17] Compiling Display. Is this the offending file? Or is it something that comes after? \n Are there any options I can pass to the compiler to get some more verbose output to diagnose the issue?\n Thanks\n EDIT: I've done some brief testing as per /u/manpacket suggested. Display.hs seems to be the offending file. \n The testing is by no means robust and is simply using stack clean && stack build each time. The left hand side indicates which instance definitions have had their undefined definition returned to normal. \n The timings are as follows:\n all undefined - 18.8s storeLoc - 18.9s storeLoc/OperandType - 18.5s storeLoc/OperandType/Operand - 22.7s storeLoc/OperandType/OpCode - 31.8s storeLoc/OperandType/Instruction - 18.8s storeLoc/OperandType/Instruction/CPUState - 43.2s storeLoc/OperandType/CPUState - 42.8s \n It seems as though the issue stems from the repeated use of <>?\n The github repo is here if you want to take a look.\n    submitted by    /u/Drsooch  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Recently I read the ACM Queue article titled \"Schrodinger's code\" concerning undefined behaviors in C so I started to wonder if Haskell has them and how many.\n So quickly I found that obviously Haskell does have them here and there. There are a bunch of unsafe functions, and FFI, etc.\n What baffles me, however, is that C compilers work on the assumption that paths contain UBs are not reachable so the compilers can aggressively remove code paths and optimize code. I personally think this means (if Haskell did the same) all code paths containing bottom values are removed. This actually makes sense in a non-strict language, because the semantics of the remaining parts remain unchanged.\n Therefore, I'm asking here the question, how well do bottom values relate to UBs (or LLVM undef?) My knowledge about Haskell is still limited so maybe this similarity is just superficial and there's no serious conclusion can be drawn here.\n Another question is: will GHC actually do the same kind of optimizations? If yes, how are they justified? If no, why not? I once encountered <<loop>> (my intent was exactly making it loop). But for other scenarios the bottom values seem to be preserved, and they are even used to cancel tasks (async exceptions).\n edit: The last question is baffling me. If the bottom value can be somehow \"caught\" like exceptions, are they really bottom values?\n    submitted by    /u/ekd123  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi everyone\n I'm sort of a Haskell noob, and I'm writing my thesis in Haskell. This is the first \"real\" project I've ever done so please bear with me if I sound stupid.\n Anyway, I'm almost at the end of the project. I have a function that opens a file, does some things to it, and then returns a result. I'm working with about 500000 files, so I thought I'd add parallelism to speed it up. I read some about parallelism in Haskell but still don't understand it very well. However, that's not important.\n My original sequential routine looks like this:\n openGetListResults :: [String] -> IO String openGetListResults [] = do return \"\" openGetListResults (p:rest) = do resP <- openGetProgramResult p resL <- openGetListResults rest return (resP ++ resL) \n It works fine.I found the Control.Monad.Parallel module online and thought I could use it to speed it up. I came up with the following:\n pOpenExecuteListPrograms :: [String] -> IO [String] pOpenExecuteListPrograms l = do list <- P.mapM openGetProgramResult l return list \n I know the return types are different but that doesn't really matter right now. The parallel version also works fine.\n I compiled the program with -threaded and -O2. I ran it with +RTS -N -s for both versions and got the following results.\n For the parallel version:\n Parallel version\n For the sequential version\n sequential version\n So the parallel version is way faster. However, it did not start any sparks. My understanding from Haskell parallelism is that sparks are like mini threads, so if it's doing parallel work, it should be using sparks no?\n Could anyone explain what is happening here? Thank you so much, hope this kind of question is allowed.\n ​\n Edit: Wrong link for Monad.Parallel\n    submitted by    /u/CHOVI_3  \n [link]   [comments]",

We believe that Haskell may give us an edge in terms of maintainability and developer efficiency so I'm keen to meet anyone who is wanting to take a new position to work with Haskell in their day job.\n The project is almost entirely greenfield, so new hires will have a great deal of agency in steering how the tech stack will be shaped.\n We're open to having remote employees. We sponsor visas and help with relocation too.\n I'm happy to answer any questions about the role here, but if you want to apply for the position, please use our page.\n About the company\n We are a leading, fast-growing Nordic fashion and beauty e-commerce company. You can find our headquarters in Malmö, Sweden, but we also have a few physical retail stores in the Copenhagen area. We also have development teams in Aarhus, Copenhagen, Vilnius, and Poznan.

It appears it’s not really a ‘step 1 = toy example first’ kinda language instead i need to study up and grasp a lot before using Haskell in real life problems. So any advice ahead of my journey to learn Haskell? I just realise there are so many expert haskellers here would love any advice that makes the journey as useful as possible.

However, when I package these libraries with my program they are not recognized as safe to run on others' systems, so in order to run my program a user has to go through a launch, crash, allow library to be run cycle for each of the libs I link against until everything is allowed. This is obviously a no-go from a user friendliness perspective.\n I figured if I could link against the Mac frameworks for the libs that they should be signed (as they've been released as frameworks) and the user would only have to go through this allow process for just my app executable (until I get it signed). However, I'm not sure how to link against the frameworks.\n I tried repointing the executable to the framework dylibs using the install_name_tool, but the versions differ between the homebrew and framework versions of the libs, which made my app not run -- I've since thought better of trying to use this method in case there were incompatibilities between the entry points of the lib versions.\n My next thought was that I would have to link to the frameworks at build-time, but adding the -framework ghc option when I run stack build doesn't seem to have any effect -- it still points to the homebrew versions. Maybe the Haskell bindings are set to point at the homebrew versions only?\n This is the first user-facing application I've developed on Mac, so I'm in a bit over my head. I'd like to have the standard DMG/drag-the-app-into-Applications installer for the app, as I don't know that homebrew would be the friendliest install method for my target audience.\n Any help or suggestions are appreciated!\n    submitted by    /u/paul_schnapp  \n [link]   [comments]",

What are existing best practices, and so forth.\n More specifically, for my current project, I want to model several geometric primitives (e.g., circle, sphere, triangle) such that I can effectively reason about them and use effective type-checking. I will render them with different backends, and will handle that elsewhere (e.g., JavaScript), but I want to be sure I am effectively modeling the geometric types.\n I'd like to use Haskell.\n The obvious way to go about this would be to begin writing data types in Haskell and potentially use that to generate other code via Template Haskell. Is there a flaw with this approach? I've considered using XML, or using Haskell to generate XML as an intermediate, but I'm not sure if that's necessary or flawed in some way.\n In general, I'd also like to use whatever approach I develop to model systems in the future. I'm not sure what the best way of going about it is. I'm wondering if anyone has any experience with this, or can point me to some references, so that I don't begin coding something that is doomed to be suboptimal for reasons known to those who know.

The aim of the project is to pull data down from multiple entity's public REST APIs (let's call them cryptocurrency exchanges). For each entity, I have to make numerous individual API calls without breaching that entity's API rate limit. The aim is to execute the API pulls from each of these entities in parallel/concurrently in order to save time. I have everything working now using parallel collections, but this is non-optimal because 1. CPU is underutilized on each thread because the bulk of the time is spent waiting between API calls and 2. more entities in parallel mean more cores.\n Could someone advise me on the best way to tackle this with a concurrency based approach? \n If possible, I would also like to keep the project structure close to what I have now. Each entity is represented by an object that extends a trait called Entity. The trait contains a method called getData that executes all the HTTP requests that are needed for that specific entity, waiting a specific amount of time between calls to avoid breaching the entity's rate limit. Each implementation overrides an apiLimit value as well as other functions for handling the specific entities HTTP responses.\n Thanks in advance!\n    submitted by    /u/EthelMerman  \n [link]   [comments]",

It also supports runtime constraints.\n Actually, Iron is almost full-vanilla (By vanilla I mean \"without macro/black magic\"). Inline methods, implicit conversions and opaque types are powerful enough to use them for 90% of the library. Thank you Dotty.\n Usage\n Passing a value A to a parameter/variable/return requiring a Constrained[A, B] will (using a given method) implicitly get a Constraint[A, B] (alias: ==>[A, B]) and use Constraint#assert. If the result is false, a compile time error is thrown.\n Example: ```scala import io.github.iltotore.iron., constraint., numeric.constraint.*\n inline def log(x: Double ==> Greater[0d]): Double = Math.log(x) ```\n Using to type aliases, we can sugar even more our constraint: ```\n    submitted by    /u/Il_totore  \n [link]   [comments]",

I don't think it makes sense to register this app on F-Droid or, gods have mercy, Google Play Store. In the future, I will do it with a more complex app I have in plans, but for now, `adb install` is the way to go). Or you can copy the whole repo and build the app yourselves.\n Here's how it looks like:\n Scala 3 Calculator\n This remarkable achievement of razor-edge tech and top-notch UX wouldn't be possible without all the brilliant people working on Scala 3, GraalVM, Gluon, JavaFX, and scala-maven-plugin. Me, I'm just putting the puzzles together.\n That being said, Scala 3 support still needs some love. There are issues, mostly around JVM/Scala compatibility (Java modules *coff* *coff*) . Now I will spend some time describing what I found about them the best I could - and nagging the above-mentioned brilliant people to take a look. But, all in all, I think we're really doing great. I didn't expect the migration to be so easy. Just as earlier I didn't expect all these different pieces would so easily fall into their places and a Scala app on Android would just work. I feel... grateful. And also super happy - hence the tone of this entry.\n Cheers 😊\n    submitted by    /u/makingthematrix  \n [link]   [comments]",

I need to go to the DB, check for some invariants, then decide if I can construct it or not.\n While with side effect-free construction, I'd just create a smart constructor in a companion objects. For example:\n ```scala case class Aggregate(...)\n object Aggregate { def create(...): Either[Error, Aggregate] = ??? } ```\n Since now my creation is side effectful, I consider a few options:\n Option #1 - separate class for the factory\n ```scala case class Aggregate(...)\n class AggregateFactory[F[_]](repository: Repository[F]) { def create(...): F[Either[Error, Aggregate]] = ??? } ```\n Then I'd just pass AggregateFactory around where needed.\n Option #2 - curried smart constructor\n ```scala case class Aggregate(...)\n object Aggregate { def create[F[_]](repository: Repository[F])(...): F[Either[Error, Aggregate]] = ??? } ```\n and then I could pass around just the partially applied create function, e.g.\n scala def factory[F[_]]: ... => F[Either[Error, Aggregate]] = Aggregate.create(repository)(_) \n What do you think is the most idiomatic approach to the side-effectful construction?\n    submitted by    /u/lam_bd85  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "This is a quirk I ran into recently, and am wondering if someone can provide some insight about it.\n I have an abstract trait with a type param that represents some intermediate representation (IR) that can be converted to the type param:\n  trait IR[O] { def toOutput: O } \n I have a concrete implementation of this trait:\n  case class StringIR(data: String) extends IR[(Int, String)] { def toOutput: (Int, String) = (data.length, data) } \n Then I want to define a circe Encoder for the IR trait, assuming the O already has an Encoder.\n This is the first way I implemented it:\n  implicit def encoder[O : Encoder, R <: IR[O]]: Encoder[R] = Encoder.instance { r: IR[O] => Encoder[O].apply(r.toOutput) } \n But when I try to get an implicit Encoder for StringIR it results in a compiler error:\n  diverging implicit expansion for type io.circe.Encoder[StringIR] starting with lazy value currencyEncoder in object Encoder \n An interesting thing I noticed is that the error doesn't always mention the currencyEncoder. Sometimes it's other provided encoders.\n So then I implemented the encoder like this:\n  implicit def encoder[O : Encoder, R <: IR[O]]: Encoder[R with IR[O]] = Encoder.instance { r: IR[O] => Encoder[O].apply(r.toOutput) } \n The only difference is that I'm using Encoder[R with IR[O]] instead of Encoder[R]. \n Here's a Scastie with a working example: https://scastie.scala-lang.org/alexklibisz/VvnYuNiGS5SN7R5GwV5cHg/25 \n It seems like the implicit resolution doesn't know that an Encoder[R with IR[O]] is the same as an Encoder[R]. I know I used Circe here, but I don't see how it would be any different for any old type class.

I would like to know your general opinions in how does compare PS with Elm and Idris for complex projects, specially whether it is worth for the mid long run (for example a small SPA might be done faster and easier with Elm).\n In one hand I felt Elm does an awesome job at the time of reducing the boilerplate and go to the point, however Evan’s focus is not always to keep a consistent programming language and I am afraid I would lack some abstractions at some point.\n Regarding Idris, it is totally the opposite direction from Elm, the compiler is immature and Idris 2 is just not ready. I like from dependent types that we can make a type dependent on a single attribute such as Matrixes with its dimensions and let the compiler verify that at compile time, however all that becomes messy when trying something beyond trivial examples. I believe that by using higher order types with purescript that’s possible as well, but I couldn’t find yet a working example (perhaps I should just try).\n Last but not least, a big missing in all the ML family is somewhat logic programming (or prolog dialect), so being not many kanrens for any of those I would believe all three are even in this aspect.\n    submitted by    /u/nudpiedo  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Dear Orgers... :)\n In the org manual, \"7.5.3 Capturing column view\", in https://orgmode.org/manual/Capturing-column-view.html#Capturing-column-view says:\n  \nSince column view is just an overlay over a buffer, it cannot be exported or printed directly. If you want to capture a column view, use a ‘columnview’ dynamic block (see Dynamic Blocks). The frame of this block looks like this: \n #+BEGIN: columnview :hlines 1 :id \"label\" \n #+END: \n This dynamic block has the following parameters: \n ‘:id’ - This is the most important parameter. Column view is a feature that is often localized to a certain (sub)tree, and the capture block might be at a different location in the file. To identify the tree whose view to capture, you can use four values: \n -- ‘local’ - Use the tree in which the capture block is located. \n -- ‘global’ - Make a global view, including all headings in the file. \n -- ‘file:FILENAME’ Run column view at the top of the FILENAME file. \n -- ‘LABEL’ - Call column view in the tree that has an ‘ID’ property with the value LABEL. You can use M-x org-id-copy to create a globally unique ID for the current entry and copy it to the kill-ring.\n  \nSince the option for ‘LABEL’ says, \"Call column view in the tree that has an ‘ID’ property...\", my question is: how do you capture a column view that is in the same file, but another tree?\n For example\n  \nchapter \n subtitle\n another subtitle that tries to capture the tree with logs\n \n another chapter \n tree with logs (that can be seen as column-view)\n \n  \nAs always, thank you very much for your generous help, time and attention... :)\n Best regards...\n    submitted by    /u/edumerco  \n [link]   [comments]",

I've been watching a tonne of videos and reading through the manual.\n One thing that I'm wondering about is whether to use tags or custom properties for adding people to a task? The idea would be that if a task has a status of WAITING that I'd want to add the associated person to that task. Then when having a meeting with that person I'd be able to pull up a list of all the tasks that are associated with that person.\n In my current system (in Notion) I actually have a page per person, so that I can write some notes about them, such as favorite food etc. In that setup the tagging of a person to a task and the person's info page is one in the same (2 tables that are linked). I'm wondering what the best way to setup this kind of functionality in org-mode would be?\n TL;DR: Tag or properties for adding people to tasks?\n Thanks in advance!\n    submitted by    /u/practicalSloth  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello there,\n https://github.com/overdr0ne/gumshoe\n What is it?\n Gumshoe quietly keeps tabs on your movements so you can retrace your steps if you ever need a reminder. It does not keep track of every move you make, rather, only when you exceed some minimum Euclidean distance from the last tracked position, like a leash, or when you idle in one place for a while. It is a lot like the global-mark-ring, but expanded, and a lot like Evil's jump list, but works more generically.\n Why?\n Basically, I tend to get lost when searching around large code bases(yes, lsp and tags help a lot too), or when I’m getting lots of interruptions, or when I just sorta space out... Specifically, I made this as a replacement for Vim’s jump list which, in Evil’s implementation at least, logs only for certain evil commands-- not at all general, and just doesn’t work when you’re not using evil for movement. I found a few other movement tracking packages, and the global-mark-ring, but they were either too manual, or had bad granularity of tracking, so I made this and thought I'd share.\n Does anyone do anything similar?

          "description": "Hello! I just started using Emacs and have a noob question:\n How to configure Emacs to automatically close brackets like in VS code or other text editors?\n I switched from Vim to the latest version of Doom Emacs and didn't like the behavior of auto-closing brackets. Specifically, I don't like two things:\n - Auto erasing closing bracket('|' -> cursor):\n ```c++ int main() { {| } ``` becomes: ```c++ int main() { | ``` \n  \nNo new line with indentation after pressing Shift+Enter:\n c++ int main() { { |} } \n Just Enter:\n c++ int main() { { | } } \n \n I tried several solutions from the internet, but neither of them worked as I wanted(I also tried hacking on them, but it was really hard because I am a noob in Elisp and Emacs). My requirements are not that high, though: - Add a closing bracket - Add new line and indent after I press Enter (and Shift+Enter) - Don't remove the closing bracket when I erase the opening one (I usually start erasing from the closing bracket and when I reach opening one, it removes the next closing bracket)\n In vim, I used simple bindings:\n ``` \" brackets\n inoremap \" \"\"<left> inoremap ' ''<left> inoremap ( ()<left> inoremap [ []<left> inoremap { {}<left> inoremap {<CR> {<CR>}<ESC>O inoremap {;<CR> {<CR>};<ESC>O \n ```\n I tried to implement it in Emacs but couldn't. Will appreciate some help.\n Is there a good way for auto closing brackets in Emacs?\n EDIT: I think electric pair suits me. As for me, smartparens' behavior is really annoying: it deletes closing pair and acts strange. I figured out how to turn off it in Doom Emacs: lisp (remove-hook 'doom-first-buffer-hook #'smartparens-global-mode) (smartparens-global-mode -1) \n One thing left: I want auto indentation after pressing Shift+Enter too.\n    submitted by    /u/MisterMoral  \n [link]   [comments]",

There is an official test file, but that one is far from code coverage and I had since tried to find the best way to create my own files. These are some examples (ignore .bin files).\n I tried to use hexdump and some other GUI tool which were not very useful imo. The best luck I had was with a custom c++ code but the issue I had was that code is since broken, besides its not the best idea to rewrite source .txt and forget to update the .bin. Which led me to writing my own elisp file editor.\n A binary file would look like this:\n 0a 00 00 01 00 00 11 00 ^ ^ ^ ^ | | | end of vector | | byte data | following data will be a byte vector // Those 00 00 are lengths of names of vector and byte // but i removed the names to make it fit on the line // More details in the NBT specs. \n The above would be diplayed like this:\n 0a 0000 01 0000 11 00 \n Or like this: ([%] means vector, b means byte)\n [%] \"\" { b \"\" 0x11 } \n Or:\n [%] \"\" { b \"\" 17 } \n So it should be at least hexadecimal, indented and separated into lines, but I would also add some readability.\n Optional: While editing the file I would like to safeguard myself and do checks on the data that I insert. Maybe even a separate buffer like in calc for stack and trail, but for insert/edit and view.\n    submitted by    /u/max_ishere  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Greetings Emacsians! I, emacs noob, am back with additional questions. I am configuring emacs to be my personal calendar and task management system. I really like the \"M-x org-agenda a\"\n view's information, but I don't like its formatting.\n First and foremost, long lines look terrible. I have \"word wrap visual line mode\" activated, which wraps lines in all org files. I also have the \"adaptive-wrap\" packaged installed and active, and that makes the text wrapping in normal org mode files look much better since indenting is respected. However, this package seems to have no effect on the org agenda views. \n Q: How can I force org agenda views to also wrap nicely such that indentation is respected? (i.e. like \"adaptive-wrap\" does for ordinary org mode files?)\n Separately, there are two other aspects of the org agenda view formatting I'd like to change (including them here since they are also related to org agenda view formatting even though they are otherwise separate issues).\n (1) Since the todo's are pulled from multiple files with different filename lengths, the \"todo\" keywords and descriptions of the todos are not aligned, and this makes the view look visually chaotic. Is there a way to tell the agenda daily/weekly view not to include the filename of each todo?\n (2) There is no extra vertical space between one todo and the next which makes it visually difficult to see where one todo ends and the next one begins. Is there a way to specify that a small amount of vertical margin beneath every todo?\n    submitted by    /u/the88doctor  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I have an issue where my .dir-locals are getting bigger and bigger, namely due to my current projects using prettier in quite a few different major modes. But also due to specific eglot setups. Enabling prettier and eglot for the relevant major-mode would work in these projects, but would start becoming annoying in the others.\n In trying to move most of the logic to my Emacs configuration and have less duplicates in each of my project roots, I tried the following:\n ;; path/to/my/project/.dir-locals.el ((nil . ((me/eglot-p . t) (me/prettier-p . t)))) ;; dotemacs.el (use-package prettier :preface (defvar-local me/prettier-p nil \"Should prettier be enabled?\") :hook (web-mode . me/prettier-mode-maybe) :config (put 'me/prettier-p 'safe-local-variable #'booleanp)) (defun me/prettier-mode-maybe () \"Enable `prettier-mode' when the prettier executable is found locally.\" (when me/prettier-p (prettier-mode))) \n The issue with that is that dir-local variables are taken into account after web-mode-hook has kicked in, even with nil when no major-mode is specified. So me/prettier-p is always nil in me/prettier-mode-maybe.\n A second attempt, ignoring dir-local variables altogether, looked like this:\n (defun me/prettier-mode-maybe () \"Enable `prettier-mode' when the prettier executable is found locally.\" (when-let ((command (shell-command-to-string \"npm list -p prettier\")) (prettier-p (length> (string-trim-right command) 0))) (prettier-mode))) \n Which is obviously too slow to be acceptable.\n What are your preferred methods to avoid having to copy the same .dir-locals.el every time you start a similar project or even reinstall your machine(s)? That was actually my case btw: I realized while reinstalling my machine how much stuff I had to copy around after cloning all my repositories.\n    submitted by    /u/TheFrenchPoulp  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm trying to set up org mode for personal task management and have come across the issue that apparently org mode list items can't be todo items (only checkmarked items) and that only headings can actually be org mode todos. This is quite a disappointment as I enjoy the automatic numbering and nicely formatted nestability available for lists and also the agenda views of todo items, and I would very much like to use them together.\n Are there any packages which fix this dilemma? Or any elisp way to do this? Or are miracles real and is there a way to actually do this in normal org mode?

Every emacs tutorial seems to call for installing either Ivy or Helm, however few are able to describe why they are necessary without referring to use cases and jargon that I either can't relate to or don't understand (my use cases for now involve task management, calendar management, and writing with only a small secondary emphasis on coding).\n I've opted not to go with Helm for now based on some complaints about performance, but the question remains of whether or not to install Ivy. So, for those of you who have experienced both vanilla emacs and Ivy emacs, what are the features (if any) that Ivy provides that you just can't live without?

          "description": "I'm an IDE user (JetBrains currently, Visual Studio when I used to write C#) with basic Vim knowledge, using primarily Java and JS with some TS. I'm getting tired of the less-than-useful vim support in the IDE space, as well as general inflexibility in setting up workflows. I've been looking into emacs (spacemacs) as a daily-driver, and I like almost everything about it. However, I'm not sure what I'll do with a certain part of my workflow that relies on refactoring support.\n This applies less to new features, and more to maintenance work on legacy(ish) code, which is honestly a lot of what I do. I've come to heavily rely on Kent Beck's \"make the hard change easy\" advice, combined with Arlo Belshee's read by refactoring. I like that I can use chains of known-safe IDE refactorings to rapidly explore and change the structure of a body of code before I even understand what it's doing, and know that I'm not changing the semantics in the process.\n Seems like a decent portion of my go-to tools are supported in JS with js2-refactor, but not all. (Haven't looked at whether it works with TS yet, and Tide may also be able to fill some holes even when applied to plain-JS.) On the other hand meghanada has been a bit disappointing in the refactoring department. Rust, if I ever work with that, looks to have an absolutely phenomenal language server.\n In addition to my two primaries, I'd like to be confident in branching out into, say, Go, Kotlin, or Swift, and I see about as much refactoring support for each of those as what meghanada has for Java; that is, nearly nothing.\n What do experienced emacs-ians do for these tasks? Do former IDE users among you not miss automated refactorings? Do you have emacs-native workflows that reliably work for, say, \"extract/inline variable/function/parameter\"?\n    submitted by    /u/better_work  \n [link]   [comments]",

I've got two projects. \n f:\\project-base\n f:\\project-base\\specific-case\n I cannot change the layout of these projects; they're not under my control.\n It's legitimate to want to compile project-base on its own. However, most of the time I want to compile specific-case.\n Both project-base and specific-case have .dir-locals.el files, and I'm using the files to define relative paths to tools and the like. I've defined an override variable that I can set within a hydra called project--path-override. However, if I invoke my hydra while visiting a buffer that's in project-base, it uses the .dir-locals.el from that directory. That's kind of as I expect, but if my override is set, I'd like to figure out a way to use the locals from the override directory.\n Even if I invoke the hydra and set the default-directory to the project--path-override and call (hack-dir-local-variables-non-file-buffer), the local variables from project-base are still set.\n I don't really want to have to defvar all of these configuration variables somewhere and update them every time I switch project directories; being free of that management is exactly why I'm using .dir-locals.el in the first place. \n I also thought that I might be able to create a fake buffer as part of invoking the hydra, but that seems like a needless mess of its own. \n Anyone have a more manageable solution? I can always switch back to a file in specific-case, but I often forget to do that and launch a compile in the wrong directory first. Plus, I'm doing most of my work in project-base, so I end up having to visit random files that I actually don't care about in specific-case just to get the vars to be set right. (I could also modify the .dir-locals.el in project-base to match the one in specific-case, but this falls apart if I ever try to do anything in specific-case2.)\n    submitted by    /u/vjgoh  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "dyncloze is an emacs module (offered via Melpa) for testing yourself on language learning. The core idea is that you can take any piece of text in emacs, and form \"clozes\" (an Anki terminology), that erase the work in question and let you guess what it should be. For example, you can test, in English \"in\" vs. \"on\", and every location of those words will be replaced by a cloze, denoted by \"[ ]\" and you are led through each of them and asked to guess each one. At the end, it tells you how well you did.\n In version 0.1, we started with the ability just to test two or more words against each other. With this version, 0.2 (just submitted, not yet updated on Melpa), we add the ability to use regex's for testing. That opens the ability to do more useful testing, at least with European languages that have a lot of word variants and word-ending grammatical bits.\n I've added two example files, one for Spanish, one for Portuguese to demonstrate. You can load them up and try out functions such as dyncloze-es-ser-estar, which will let you guess every variant of ser and estar (\"eras\", \"fui\", \"está\", \"estaba\", etc.), but you just choose which of the verbs it belongs to: ser or estar. There's a similar function that lets you choose between perfect and imperfect tenses.\n If you'd like to contribute, please open pull requests for the language you are studying with more examples (or fix up an issues with the ones I have).\n    submitted by    /u/ahyatt  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello! I present to you my first emacs package - atp. It's intended as a component for writing text editing commands and augmenting modal editing modes. Its main feature is the ability to automatically recognize and highlight things at point and apply commands to highlighted things or active region.\n I started working on this package because I was lookig for a new approach that would help me save a couple of keystrokes on each common task such as copying and pasting text, evaluation of lisp expressions and shell-commands, changing letter case, etc.\n For a year I used a wonderful package \"expand-region\" for that purpose. Despite it being very smart and useful, it requires 2 actions to select an object under the point. First, the user must navigate to the desired location, and then call er/expand-region to select an object. I thought that the second step was redundant and decided to write a package that will work without it.\n At this moment atp is unstable because it was written in a hurry and my knowledge of elisp and emacs internals isn't great. I just wanted to write something usable as soon as I could to check the viability of the chosen approach. Here is a repo and a video that demonstrates how atp works in the context of a tiny modal editing mode.\n https://github.com/tre-flip/atp\n http://ctrl-c.club/~treflip/atp.mp4\n What do you think about it?\n    submitted by    /u/KnightOfTribulus  \n [link]   [comments]",

So I will try to explain what this client-server model is in terms of emacs and I seek suggestions from this community about the validity of my understanding.\n So client-server model is basically used for utilizing the same running instance of emacs instead of opening up a new session everytime. How emacs does this is it creates a emacs server instance which keeps running in the background . Now if I want to to do something with emacs by using that single instance running in the background I will do so by emacsclient binary. For example if I want to open a file in gui frame (emacsclient -c filename) emacsclient will direct the emacs server to do so. I can create many instances of emacsclient which will use the same emacs server instance that is running in the background. By doing so I can do things in one session. Avoid the time cost of starting up a whole new session and open files quickly. There are different switches for emacsclient and emacs server which one can utilize to use different features provided by both of them. \n Thats it.

However, when I fold \"Jump over\", I get differing line numberings.\n In vim:\n 1 I want to 1 2 +-- 2 lines: * Jump over ......... 3 * to here 4 * without overshoot \n But in emacs:\n 1 I want to 1 2 * Jump over... 4 * to here 5 * without overshoot \n In vim, 3j takes me where I want. In emacs, C-u 4 C-n, as hinted by the numbering, results in overshoot.\n From my search (e.g. here https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/6i8nu3/question_for_evilmode_users_folding_and_relative/) the vim behavior has not been possible in emacs. Is this still the case?\n This type of movement is very fundamental for my workflow, especially when programming with my voice (being able to say \"one four dip just\" to delete 14 lines down, for example).\n Is there any way to achieve equally efficient vertical movement in emacs?\n    submitted by    /u/them_vibes  \n [link]   [comments]",

So far it's pretty cool.\n If you aren't familiar with toolbox it's a nice wrapper around Podman that makes working with ad-hoc containers super easy.\n I have emacs in a flatpak and a toolbox with my C development environment installed. My goal was to hook them together so that I could use Eglot to develop C programs like I normally do.\n There's the docker-tramp project but this didn't work right for me... not sure what the issue was. The wonderful emacs wiki has a page on Tramp and Docker with some example code. So, I took it and modified it to use toolbox:\n (push (cons \"toolbox\" '((tramp-login-program \"flatpak-spawn --host toolbox\") (tramp-login-args ((\"enter\" \"-c\") (\"%h\"))) (tramp-remote-shell \"/bin/sh\") (tramp-remote-shell-args (\"-i\") (\"-c\")))) tramp-methods) \n Now I can C-x C-f /toolbox:fedora-toolbox-34: and open any file from inside the toolbox environment. I installed ccls in the toolbox and then Eglot was up and running. How about vterm-toggle? Like a charm... dropped me directly into a shell. Super cool.\n It seems like a few flaming hoops to jump through, and it's not a wrong assessment either. But when it's all working it's completely transparent and quite amazing, considering that Emacs and the development tools are running in different containers.

I never did really get to the point where I felt comfortable looking through logs though. I would often use \"Ediff\" to compare two files, and take screenshots for Zendesk, but nothing too fancy.\n This time around though, its a bit more involved so I'm asking for some Emacs Wizards to help me find some suitable new packages to pump my config with.\n This being noted, I have to use GCP (Google Cloud Provider) to then SSH into a related sandbox environment. On that note, can Tramp be used in that scenario to make those two hops (aka to a GCP box, and then to an ssh box?)\n ​\n For the main topic though, does anyone have any good ideas on any packages that are great at grepping through a bunch of logs, and also how to re-direct anything that's found into separate files? \n ​\n So far though, I've been able to connect through 'ansi-term' just fine but would love to somehow take that same terminal connection and do some more crazy Emacs stuff with it. \n ​\n Very curious to see what people have in mind.

Emacs gui on the other hand displays my custom theme correctly.\n To work around this problem and have both versions with the same theme I configured my init.el in the following way:\n ```\n (load-theme 'wombat)\n (add-to-list 'default-frame-alist '(background-color . \"0x030c11\"))\n (add-to-list 'default-frame-alist '(foreground-color . \"0xd3d0c8\"))\n (set-background-color \"#030c11\")\n ```\n I don't know why but it's the only way to display the same background. After opening the gui version, the flip side of this is the following error reported below the mode line: undefined color: \"undefined\". It's not so annoying and it disappears after the first input but I'd like to fix it.\n Do you know how can I solve the theme conflict between the two versions or how to remove the error message as a work-around?\n My init.el: https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/jMDvYrTwNK/\n Thanks in advance!\n    submitted by    /u/loquat-01  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I wonder if there is a simple solution to have a UI to navigate packages information with straight.el. It is mentioned in the README from straight that\n  \nany UI is provided by the user's completing-read framework\n  \nI would love to see examples of it ! (or build it myself)\n ​\n I tried something myself using marginalia and the metadata provided by package.el. I added this to to my init to associate the recipe keyword with package annotation :\n (add-to-list 'marginalia-prompt-categories '(\"\\\\<recipe\\\\>\" . package)) \n But I also have to (package-initialize) somewhere in my init since marginalia-annotate-package relies on package-alist and package-archive-contents. \n ​\n Of course its a far from ideal solution. It doesn't work for all recipes, relies on package.el and doesn't inform about the current status of installed packages. For a proper solution, I think one could reuse part of the mechanism package.el uses to get packages information like package-load-descriptor, combine it with information from straight and finally add information provided by git for each repo.\n ​\n Does anyone know about packages or obscure init files that go in this direction ?\n    submitted by    /u/ConsistentAuthor8411  \n [link]   [comments]",

I want to go through each week and pick an arbitrary number of recipes to cook by toggling a todo state on the heading. I want to write a function to concatenate all of the ingredients tables from the recipes I select for the week. I think I want to do something like this:\n (org-element-map (org-element-parse-buffer 'element) 'table (lambda (table) (when (string= (org-element-property :status table) \"MAKE\") ...code to concat table...))) \n The missing piece with this idea is that I don't want to set a table property manually, but I also don't know how to set a property on a table based on the parent heading's todo state. Todo state triggers weren't meant for this it seems. I'm reading the documentation of course, but it's a little slow-going and I'm not that familiar with all of Org's built-in functions that might help with something like this.

I've looked at the solutions that other people used, but none of it has worked out for me yet. \n (Namely: https://github.com/ahungry/org-jira/issues/21 and https://github.com/ahungry/org-jira/issues/186)\n I've noticed that if I use the constructed curl command with my username and password manually, I get what I *think* is a valid response. Otherwise, I see this X-AUSERNAME: anonymous in the messages. I tried creating a .authinfo file, but it changes nothing. Org-JIRA only asked my for my credentials once and never again.\n Internally, I use either a login/password or SSO to log in, but it doesn't look like our system has the same API token functionality that the Atlassian site does. I tried finding the cloud.session.token to use with the authorization workaround, but nothing that I did surfaced it. I'm not really a web guy, so I was just making some stabs in the dark.\n This is all on Windows; I'm not sure to what extent that makes a difference, but I've seen problems with that in the last few days in other packages. \n Anyone else have anything else I can try?\n    submitted by    /u/vjgoh  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "In my job I edit a lot of text files. Gvim has a lot of options that make editing text really fast. Like yyp to copy a line and paste it or * to automatically search for the word under the cursor. \n I often end up with a lot of vim windows open that create a clutter. I also have a lot of projects to work on and I need some place to keep my notes for these and organize my tasks. I hear that managing such things with emacs should be easy with orgmode and that it should be able to match the text editing provided by vim.\n However most of the things I find are related to installing packages from the internet. At work I don't have the ability to install anything. For vim pluging i am able to copy the plugin and create the files manually. Is this possible to do in emacs? \n Also any tips for switching to emacs? I feel a lot slower with emacs to switch and edit file even though I find things like file browsing directly from emacs is much nicer than what is in gvim.\n So can the vanilla emacs match gvim in terms of text editing, and are there any features which are possible in gvim but not in emacs?\n    submitted by    /u/Suitable-Yam7028  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "desktop-save-mode had caused me issues before because of different ways of starting Emacs :- command line \"emacs\", as a service (\"systemctl --user enable Emacs\") with the system starting it, as emacsclient (emacsclient -c ) or even from your own startup with something like \"emacs --daemon\". Anyway, this little snippet \"works for me\" and might be of interest to others. All self-contained in a use-package form. If starting as a daemon do the desktop read after the first frame is created, else do it immediately after emacs-startup-hook is triggered. The only thing that scuppered me a little was not checking the supplied emacs.service systemd config - it hardcodes the Emacs path, starting the wrong Emacs version and causing straight.el to recompile everything on startup : solution to that is copying /usr/lib/systemd/user/emacs.service to ~/.config/systemd/user and altering the paths to your own Emacs version (Debian paths there).\n The settings of desktop-save and desktop-path in combination with needing a desktop-read call are, on observation, what caused much confusion out there in google land. \n Maybe not news to many, but I thought I'd share the snippet as googling showed it's still an issue for some.\n ​\n  (use-package emacs :custom (desktop-path '(\"~/.emacs.d/var/desktop\")) (desktop-save t) :init (defun rgr/restore-desktop() (when (fboundp 'alert) (alert (message (format \"loading desktop from %s\" desktop-path)))) ;;I include the run-with-timer despite being able to get this to work without as it's a timing ;;issue and a little delay does no one any harm (run-at-time \"1\" nil (lambda() (desktop-read) (desktop-save-mode 1)))) (add-hook 'emacs-startup-hook (lambda() (if (daemonp) (add-hook 'server-after-make-frame-hook 'rgr/restore-desktop) (rgr/restore-desktop))))) \n    submitted by    /u/RichieHHam  \n [link]   [comments]",

Plus, I don't really like scrolling line by line, so I've been trying to have emacs scroll smoothly.\n Sadly, I've found the emacs smooth scrolling experience to be janky at best: no matter what workarounds I use (I've tried several, including all of those listed on the emacswiki page as well as good-scroll.el), smooth scrolling feels sluggish, not fluid, and often unresponsive.\n I wonder what the root cause for this is. Most of the explanations I've read revolve around emacs' lack of animation support. For example, the github page of smooth-scroll.el states the following:\n  \nScrolling sometimes pauses or stutters. It's unclear exactly why, but one factor is that Emacs lacks animation support. Emacs has timers for updating the screen contents, which is enough for playing simple animated GIF files, but not enough for video playback or frame-perfect smooth scrolling.\n  \nMy question is the following: what would it take to fix it? I know that emacs is very old, and some features might just be outside of its capabilities (at least for now). Is smooth scrolling support one such feature?\n I understand that emacs wasn't made with smooth scrolling in mind, and I don't mean to criticize and/or diminish the amazing work that went into it. I'm extremely happy with my emacs experience--smooth scrolling would just be the icing on the cake.\n Thank you in advance!\n    submitted by    /u/M-x_  \n [link]   [comments]",

I like that they're relatively light weight.\n I've used helm for a long time, and it's honestly very good, but I'm mostly only using it for its locate functionality now. I use everything search on windows, which in combination with the .dir-locals.el lets me set a search instance depending on the directory I start the search from. I know about projectile, of course, but it's slower and more finicky than everything. (With everything, I can set up a search that spans many directories on many drives and make it a named instance, and then just query the named instance in the arguments.)\n Helm's locate is the only decent and maintained way to do this that I've found. Scrounging up random .el files from EmacsWiki doesn't really work for me.\n If there isn't, no big deal. I'll keep helm updated.\n    submitted by    /u/vjgoh  \n [link]   [comments]",

This seems to make sense as there doesn't seem to be a way to auto magically auto assimilate (but being very new to this, there might be one I overlooked). \n ​\n https://github.com/rileyrg/Emacs-Customisations/blob/borg-full/init.el\n ​\n Thanks for any hand holding and pointers.\n    submitted by    /u/RichieHHam  \n [link]   [comments]",

(auto-hide-function . delete-frame)))) \n This causes the *PDF-Occur* buffer to be displayed in a newly-created (\"pop-up\") frame instead of splitting the frame with the PDF document into two windows. (The auto-hide-function causes that frame to be deleted when one \"quits\" the window in that new frame. That is, when you press q in that buffer, the newly-created frame is deleted.)\n However, there is a secondary problem. When you select the occurence you care about in the *PDF-Occur* buffer and press RETURN, it splits that frame vertically and displays the PDF in the lower-half of that frame (again, in a too-small-to-read format).\n I fixed that by adding a function to the hook for the *PDF-Occur* buffer's mode like this:\n `` (defun my-pdf-occur-buffer-mode-hook () \"CauseRETURN' in this buffer to use the window already displaying the PDF and return focus there.\" (make-local-variable 'display-buffer-alist) (setq display-buffer-alist (cons '(\".*\\.pdf$\" (display-buffer-reuse-window) (reusable-frames . t)) (default-value 'display-buffer-alist))))\n (add-hook 'pdf-occur-buffer-mode-hook #'my-pdf-occur-buffer-mode-hook) ```\n Of course, I'm happy to learn if you have critiques of how I did this—or about any of this.\n    submitted by    /u/cfraizer  \n [link]   [comments]",

This is possible with chemacs2. \n I followed the README but I'll add that one should also delete their package-quickstart.el and other similar files that use hard-coded paths, before moving everything around. \n Once you have your usual emacs in .emacs.default, you can for example create an empty .emacs.future (or any other name), and set it as a profile in .emacs-profiles.el. \n Next, you can download emacs and build from source with native compilation if you'd like. Do not make install, rather we'll use the path to the newly built executable. \n Since chemacs2 keeps everything emacs as calls to the default directory, you won't have to change much. \n What you can do now, is alias to the more recent emacs executable with the future profile. For example, I put the emacs repo in ~/emacs. Meaning that I can do :\n alias ef=\"/my/home/emacs/src/emacs --with-profile future\" \n To use a different profile with the built from source executable. \n Thanks to that I have two different versions of emacs with different init files, living together.\n    submitted by    /u/NoisyFrequency  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Emacs offers CUA-mode out of the box to address users expectations for normal C-c (copy), C-v (paste), C-z (undo) commands. Indeed, this is often an issue that comes up when I am teaching newcomers Emacs. So, why don't I hear about this being used more? Why don't I use it? Why was one of my joys in adopting EXWM the ability to use emacs shortcuts INSTEAD of CUA in other progams? Essentially I went the opposite direction.\n Even for those years when I was learning emacs, no part of me ever longed to regain the key bindings that were used everywhere else, and that is strange in retrospect. Was it because learning new keybindings was part of the emacs experience? Or because CUA bindings are already only relevant to Windows users and not Mac keybords? Was it because there is something qualitatively different about killing, yanking, and emacs' undo style than the copy-paste-undo of everything else? I admit, whenever I am forced into non-emacs programs, I do long for the kill ring.\n What do you think? Why is CUA-Mode so rarely brought up as a first step (and therefore rarely brought up at all)?\n    submitted by    /u/WorldsEndless  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello r/emacs.\n ​\n I have recently set up a neat feature for Emacs that I wanted to share with you. I am going to give you a short description of what this is supposed to be here, but for more details, and the required code snippets you can check my github repository where I also host my dotfiles.\n ​\n So, if you are tiling window manager user, you have probably heard of scratchpads. If you haven't, they are floating windows with predefined dimensions which are automatically hidden when they lose focus. Why is this useful you may ask? Well, I personally dislike leaving Emacs, especially when I want to write a large piece of text. But there are some things (mostly when I am doing something on the web, such as creating this reddit post) which I can't directly do in Emacs. This project tries to solve this project.\n ​\n I have basically set up my window manager of choice (qtile, but I do plan to try and make this for other window managers such as i3) to create a scratchpad of Emacs which opens in a placeholder file and an emacs command which when ran, copies the whole buffer to the clipboard and then deletes it from the file so it can be used again. This allows me to write everything in Emacs, in a small floating window which is visible whenever I need it and then hides itself when unneeded, using a placeholder file which is always empty and waiting for text to fill it. The setup is honestly very handy and I really like it, as the alternatives are somewhat annoying to use imo. \n ​\n For more details, check the aforementioned git repo. I hope you will enjoy it. I personally really like the idea and as I couldn't find anyone who has done something similar, I thought I should share this here so you guys can see the idea and adopt it if you like. I will gladly answer any of your questions about this and try to persuade you that its got a reasonable use-case.\n    submitted by    /u/AuroraDraco  \n [link]   [comments]",

So, I made this thing awhile back originally in the context of developing a programming language which used a lot of Unicode math symbols (basically forcing variable-width fonts) and significant whitespace. Now I use it for all of my personal note files, and it seems like other people might find it useful so I'm releasing it.\n https://github.com/tenbillionwords/spaceship-mode\n ​\n spaceship-mode\n What this basically does is:\n  \nspaceship-mode makes spaces at the start of a line have their width automatically adjusted to align with previous text as they would in a fixed-width font. Example pictured.\n tabble-mode is an implementation of elastic tabstops.\n  \nTogether these make it possible in principle to do every kind of alignment I have ever seen being useful in an actual programming or plaintext-note-taking situation.\n Using spaceship-mode absolutely requires adhering to the convention of using tabs for indentation and spaces for alignment. Unfortunately, that means these modes work very badly with stock Emacs, yet I am not providing any kind of user-interface features such as commands to help use and maintain the indentation conventions, or any keybindings at all. It wouldn't do to just quickly slap something together, because Emacs' assumption of fixed-width fonts is fairly deeply entrenched in its design, and peeps have very different preferences and methods for dealing with indentation in general. (And I'm not providing my own full setup because...reasons.) So if you want to get this working well, you'll have to do some work to integrate it into your own system. The “Example Setup” in the readme may give some indication of how to start doing this.\n P.S.

Hope to become as good as you soon.\nI have a couple of questions, however;\nI don't want to start with a digital zettelkasten, so I've started the process of acquiring a novelink box and index cards from Amazon. But info online is considerably vague. I know I'm to use my fleeting notes for quick ideas or notes as they come, then my literature note is for learning purposes before transferring to my permanent note, then finally transfer singular ideas into my zettels. My question is how do I use this while reading a book or taking an online course? What do I need to transfer between these notes? How do I know I'm taking the ideal note? Do I look at it from the context of why I'm studying the note/book/course, or I'm to maintain an open mind?\nAlso, I don't know if there are copywriters in this group, but how can I use this method to boost my research ability? How do you use your zettelkasten system to research?\nThanks for your answers!",

Halmos. and on page 134, he discusses how he organizes a book or long article:\n\n  \nAt one stage of writing a 300-page book I had 1000 sheets of paper, each with a mathematical statement on it, a theorem, a lemma, or even a minor comment, complete with proof. The sheets were numbered, any which way. My job was to indicate on each sheet the numbers of the sheets whose statement must logically come before, and then to arrange the sheets in linear order so that no sheet comes after one on which it's mentioned.\n\n\nEmphasis mine.\nIt is of course not quite a Zettelkasten, since the numbers are only used to describe predecessors, but I think it is still interesting to look at these examples of almost-Zettelkasten. I think it gives credibility to the Zettelkasten technique that it is not really something entirely new, but that the elements can be recognized elsewhere.",

For me, history is a way of connecting various pieces of evidence from the past, both diachronically (connecting similar items over time) and synchronically (connecting different items from the same time), to find patterns and to draw conclusions.  A Zettelkasten would therefore seem an ideal tool for making these connections and helping to draw the relevant conclusions.  However, the way I work doesn't seem to fit the Zettelkasten 'method' described in this forum, especially in relation to reading notes.\nThe first stage of my work is to collect the evidence, usually from various different primary sources.  This usually involves noting the evidence verbatim.  I may summarise it later, but I need to work from the original evidence…",

Throughout my life I have read many books, but I remember little about them. For instance, I say books like \"The Double Helix\" or \"The Art of Learning\" made a big impact on me, but outside of a few anecdotes, I remember nothing. More than that, I have no notes to go back and refer to.  My plan this year was to change this and systematically process any book I read.\nThe first book happened to be \"Team of Rivals\". My first zettel was on 02/06/2021. At the time I had approximately 430 zettels.\nThe Process\nI know little about Lincoln or the Civil War outside of what I remember from high school. Everything was new and everything seemed notable. As I …",

          "description": "In the past, scientists have developed a number of impressive theories. In the case of Luhmann, we have a detailed picture of one of the crucial tools he used, this tool has been made very explicit to a degree that anyone can use it, and this tool is largely uncoupled from the individual knowledge and the cognitive skills of its users. For other scientific breakthroughs, some of them perhaps even more impressive than Luhmann's theories, we seem to know little about what methods led to these breakthroughs.\nI wonder what we could develop from this perspective - what, if any, explicit, transferable methods and tools can we extract from the works of physicists, philosophers or mathematicians? How can we combine these tools with practices from the ZK universe?\nAs far as I know, most breakthrough ideas in science and elsewhere were made without the use of a ZK - so people have used other ways to create great ideas, and it would be foolish to narrow our view on ZK-based work only.\nTo me, in most of the forum discussions we have a dominant focus on \"literature-driven\" ZK work - people read, write zettels, enrich them with their own thoughts and link them to other zettels. On the other hand I suspect that a huge part of people's crucial relevant work in life is \"problem-driven\". I'm convinced that many writers in this forum use their ZKs for this purpose, but postings about how to start thinking about a topic, how to formulate problems, how to ask questions, how to generate ideas, how to discard approaches in the ZK framework seem to me underrepresented, given their importance for creative work.",

Although I'm quite happy with my workflow on my iMac I'm having a hard time making a good workflow for creating zettels on my iPad. That's why I'm looking for help.\nI've been trying to populate some front matter on a new note using this iOS shortcut for iAWriter: https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/05a688e941954398aafab768f75966fc. The shortcut adds a filename following the convention used by The Archive and adds title, date, and tags. The problem is that it works sometimes while fails most of the time for no apparent reason.\nAs you can see image 1 (sucessful-shortcut.png) shows how it looks when the shortcut properly works, and image 2 (fail-shortcut.png) shows when it fails.\n\n\n\nDo you have any insight into what's happening? If you use iA Writer, is there another way to add a front matter to a new note on iPad (other than manually)?\nA simple workflow is really important for me to work with The Archive and iA Writer on the iPad, so if you have figured this out I'd love to learn from you.

I've explored different mediums trying to find one that fit and for the most part have enjoyed the journey.\nBut, there continues to be one lingering concern... that I am just collecting and not making any real use of my notes.\nI do my best to take quick notes while reading, putting them into my own words before adding these ideas to my slip box and expanding on them... but even after that, it still feels like I am just creating collection of other people ideas.\nThis leads me to ask two questions.

(Like a skeptic tank)\nHis notes are really short (generally 1 to 3 sentences).\nI see nobody else using the Zettelkasten in this way. Lot of people create longer notes and try to synthesize before putting the ideas into the system.\nLast but not least: the system is created for academic research in mind.\nMy frictions:\n1) When I think and want to create new notes... having to search existing notes in the Zettelkasten stops my thinking flow.\nI am wondering if it’s not better to just create note without connection when I think... and only then look at the possible connections. But that will create a lot of duplicates.\nOr thinking more deeply before putting the note and find the connections. (But I feel I don’t leverage the Zettelkasten fully by this way)\n2) When I want to create a new content... going to the Zettelkasten kills my creative flow. As I am not creating academic content (but marketing content)... The most important in the content isn’t the information, but the emotion (you can only put emotion in a content with your first brain in a specific mood)\nBecause of this 2 things... I am wondering if a Zettelkasten is the best tool for me.\nAnd if it is... I am wondering why only luhmann work in a very atomic way without bothering of the quality of the note. And why mainy people create longer note with digital zettelkasten.\nMy question:\nI deliberately don’t ask a specific question because at this point, I don’t really know what is the good question to ask myself.\nMaybe: How to determine the best way of organizing the process and scope of permanent notes ?\nThanks for reading.\nDamian",
