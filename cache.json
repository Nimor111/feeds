          "description": "I keep seeing stuff like this written about Haskell:\n \"Procedural entities like rand() or getchar() in C, which return different results on each call, are simply impossible to write in Haskell. Moreover, Haskell functions can't have side effects, which means that they can't effect any changes to the \"real world\", like changing files, writing to the screen, printing, sending data over the network, and so on. These two restrictions together mean that any function call can be replaced by the result of a previous call with the same parameters, and the language guarantees that all these rearrangements will not change the program result!\"\n However, if that were true it wouldn't be very useful would it? Surely we can write crypto things, make files, print to console etc...\n So which is it? Haskell can do this or it can't?

          "description": "I've been writing a few toys (e.g. some CLI tools, a simulator, etc.) in Haskell over the last year and a bit and loved it, but am now trying to write a fuller application and have run into an area which I don't know how to handle well in Haskell: error states.\n For example, I want to read a configuration file, parse the YAML, and select a portion out of it. This can fail in the following ways:\n  \nthe configuration file might be absent;\n the configuration file might be invalid;\n the specific key I'm looking for might not be found (there's part of my configuration described as Map String Subconfig and I want to pull a named Subconfig out).\n  \nData.Map's lookup uses Maybe to handle the error case, which is how I've mostly done this before, but Data.Yaml has decodeThrow and decodeEither. I'm pretty comfortable with Either but throwing is something I know from other languages, but not Haskell.\n Looking at this from the perspective of the problem domain, I'd be fine if the missing config file just caused the programme to immediately exit, and likewise if the config was malformed or missing the required key, but I can imagine cases in which I'd like to handle these errors a bit more elegantly.\n I've been looking for good resources (beyond Hackage) for how MonadThrow (or the whole throw/catch) is supposed to look in Haskell, and how people handle errors, but haven't found any good examples which are also beginner-friendly.\n Any tips?\n    submitted by    /u/gtf21  \n [link]   [comments]",

However, stream has an ace in the sleeve, which is optional heavy operations.\n The usual processing logic is defined with anonymous functions, like:\n (1 to 1000).filter(_ < 500).map(_.toString) \n and those functions are executed with special JVM feature \"invocedynamic\". Before \"invocedynamic\" was introduced in Java 8, a custom interface would have to be created for each single function and the generated byte code size would go through the roof.

I have experience in many object oriented programming languages (Java, Python, C, C++, C#, etc) but I would not say I am an excellent programmer in any of these languages. I do not know a whole lot about computer science in general either. So how long could it take to be knowledgable enough to actually be hired as a beginning developer? A year of coding in Scala? 6 months? What other relevant knowledge would be necessary or desirable as a beginning developer? Is it difficult to get entry level jobs a Scala developer?

          "description": "Hi there, \n I'm currently learning e/macs and have discovered org-mode and have workflow question. Currently I do all my task, project management and timelog planning through Toggl and Evernote. I use Evernote as a filing cabinet, storing important documents like contracts, tax documents etc, for quick retrieval. However I would like to get away from Evernote, due to its lack of privacy and encryption features. \n Ideally, I would like to have everything in org-mode, that is: \n  \nNotes (I'm quite ok with plain text notes)\n Files (like a plain text note such as tax agreement, which then links to the actual document)\n Time tracking for tasks and calendar apointments\n Maybe an Agile Results (a productivity system) workflow\n How can I get my tasks in org-mode etc. on my phone on iOS?\n  \nIs this possible to achieve in org-mode and if so, could you suggest a possible workflow? I have also looked at Joplin as a possible candidate, but it's time tracking and todo features are insufficient for me. \n Thanks, in advance \n Best regards, \n ​\n David\n    submitted by    /u/dsbahr  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "If you have any neat tricks to bootstrap from an org file, do share. I came up with a neat solution below, but am having a slight isssue.\n As the ideal in literate programming paradigm, org should be capable of bootstrapping arbitrary projects, without the user knowing or using emacs. After MUCH trial and error, I finally came up with a shebang that will tangle a file, though it depends on the current working directory/filename:\n #! emacs --eval=(progn (find-file \"this-file.org\") (org-mode) (org-babel-tangle)) \n However, when emacs detects itself in the magic string, it opens the document in Emacs-Lisp Mode instead of org mode. Basically, when you execute the file, it opens correctly, but when you open the file normally, you must invoke (org-mode).

All tutorials I've seen online just show small examples which is OK... I understand everyone will come up with a different workflow, but I'd love some inspiration. For instance do you all:\n 1) Use one big calendar file and just throw events into it unsorted? 2) Use some sort of sorted calendar file? If so, how do you sort it... By year, then month, then day? This is confusing because scheduled dates seem to be children of the parent title, so it doesn't seem logical to organize events this way. 3) Do you use org journal in some way for this?\n I'd also love to know how you integrate your scheduled events with scheduled to-dos... Are they one in the same place?\n Finally, is there some web resource with some example layouts or workflows?\n Really looking forward to getting into this.

          "description": "Hello!\n I've recently started using org-mode for taking down notes for my a couple of CS based courses and I'm loving it so far! Using a neat hierarchical structure. However, there's one important feature that I'd like, which I haven't been able to do in org-mode.\n As I'm typing down notes, I would like to select a particular sentence/phrase and mark it as an important \"note\" to remember. This is analogous to highlighting a piece of text. Later, I would like to retrieve/display the important notes, that I have marked.\n While I understand that having Tags in headlines solves this issue (where I can set the tag to IMPORTANT), it works only at headline level and not at a text level. Additionally, the simple formatting features like bold/italics etc do not really help/make the text stand out.\n Is there a tool/package/anything that can do something like this? Where I can essentially select a sentence/phrase from my notes, and mark as important and search later? If not, how do org-mode users highlight some text, sort of like a 'callout' block?\n I wouldn't mind the piece of text to be a separate \"block\", if it is a feasible solution as well. It need not be part of a paragraph, however, it doesn't make sense to be a headline.\n Thanks.\n ​\n A small snippet attached here. Would like the selected portion to be marked as \"important\". \n Image Query\n    submitted by    /u/ThreeForElvenKings  \n [link]   [comments]",

Similar to org-roam-node-insert, but the candidates will only be people. Bonus points if when I create a new entry it automatically marks the new node/file as a \"person\".\n Does org-roam allow for this type of customization?\n I'm using v2, BTW.\n Thanks.\n    submitted by    /u/BeetleB  \n [link]   [comments]",

I can provide more information about software but was hoping someone has already run into this before maybe with another compiler in 'watch' mode.\n Thanks in advance.\n Edit:\n This is actually being caused by emacs LSP mode, disabling it fixes the issue.\n If anyone knows how to keep LSP but not register a 'file change' before I actually save the file I'm editing, any information would be great\n Edit 2: FIXED! (sort of... viable workaround at least.)\n It was a flycheck 'issue', mixed with LSP (as it utilises flycheck). The answer was to set webpack.devServer.ignored (in my webpack.config.js) to [ '**/.*' ] which is to say that the webpack watcher should ignore hidden files in any directory under your main.\n It seems that flycheck creates a sort of temporary file when it checks and then removes it, causing webpack to actually detect 2 file changes every time flycheck runs, which runs every time you edit a file... This can ultimately even cause webpack-dev-server to crash.\n It also seems that flycheck needs this behaviour to function correctly, so changing the directory it creates these temp files is a no-op.\n    submitted by    /u/_lovesponge  \n [link]   [comments]",

Please let me know what you think.\nIf you have a Zettelkasten, you need to constantly create Zettels so it grows to give you richer connections. A day in a Zettler usually looks like this:\nCreate Zettels and make connections.\nRead sources.\nProofread Zettels.\nHowever, you need to manage the overall process so working with a Zettelkasten doesn't become all you do everyday. E.g.: In the worst case scenario, you'd spend the entire morning, afternoon, and evening creating Zettels, reading, and proofreading respectively. That gives you no time for anything else!\nThe part of the process to manage is reading time because everything else depends on it. E.g.: If you don't read, you can't create Zettels, and without Zettels, there's nothing to proofread.\nI think that we can manage reading time in the same way that we adapt the routine of short knowledge cycles:\nStart with 1 hour of reading.\nRead, create Zettels, and proofread. Keep track of the time spent on each activity.\nReflect on the overall process.\nBased on your reflection, change the time alloted for reading.\nRepeat steps 2 through 4 until you reach a point where you are satisfied with the work you do for your Zettelkasten, and don't lose time for other things in your day.",

With that I mean, methods for promoting/demoting notes in a hierarchy or folding a lower level to reduce distraction.\nIn Luhmann's paper, this aspect seemed really important to him. And I can see how adding lower-level notes helps to keep notes simple and atomic. (Example: notes on cities are listed under notes for countries.)\nAs I am just starting with the Zettelkasten, I am worried that a non-hiearchical note list will become very confusing quickly.

Literature note can link to previous permanent notes that are useful for the idea. But what for permanent notes created just to explain something in the literature note? I guess we treat them as if they were older than the literature note, even if the UID is more recent (timestamp) breaking a bit the rule.

It is my hope to develop a system that allows me to write productively for my field and accrue a vast body of knowledge along the way. From what I have read thus far on the forum, articles about the Luhmann's numerical system have piqued my interested because I do want to use it in my system; however, I am still trying to grasp exactly how the new UID, aside from Luhmann's numerical one, is used for linking to other notes in the digital slip-box. I am currently deepening my understanding of this system by reading How To Take Smart Notes.\nPertaining to software, I am in need of advice. I have both Obsidian and Zettlr downloaded, having used Obsidian in the past for note taking but not as well organized as I would have liked. The latter software is a recent find; I have no experience with it. Yet I am open to suggestions concerning other applications available for Linux.\nWith regard to my studies, I am in the midst of my coursework and trying to figure out my niche, but I do have an affinity for Plato and Spinoza. What led me to the field in the first place was the Islamic philosophers, namely Al-Farabi and Ibn-Rushd (Averroes). Anyhow, I look forward to perusing the forum for past insights and discussions.",

          "description": "(new to zk)\nGiven all the discussion of how L-style ID's can be association-brittle relative to using just links, I was wondering if the following has an implementation in any digital system.\nI'd like the following:  an L-style ref to \"position-sequence\" extended to differentiate between paths through the sequence --based on context --  in which one context path may share some im/proper subset of the other.\nExample: given say \nHere we have the shared edge (xa,xb) = (1b,1ba). And indeed it would be stultifying to assume that the meaning in context2 is partially identical to context1 simply because of the shared referential sub-structure.\nQuestion: for the advocates of links only: is there a simple way to differentiate multiple referential contexts. I.e., to allow for the same edge/link to be given different meaning.\nThis could be via named links -- not just links named for their nodes, or multi-links, or some in-note context to mimic this behavior.\nDoes such a thing exist?",

          "description": "I find @Will's idea of sharing zettels great - so here comes my  latest example, with a number of remarks. \n\n\nRemarks:\nThe 2013 Zettelkasten Exhibition in the Literaturmuseum der Moderne in Marbach/Germany was titled \"Zettelkästen. Maschinen der Phantasie\" (perhaps roughly \"Zettelkästen. Machines of Imagination\"). I'm fascinated by the question how a zettelkasten can support creative processes. My zettel shows one of the approaches I am experimenting with.\nThe basic idea is the following: I collect ideas triggered by the question \"How can inventive principles from the TRIZ method be used to make zettelkasten work more interesting, successful or effective?\" Background: TRIZ is the \"theory of inventive problem solving\", and one of its key components is a list of 40 (or so) inventive principl…",
