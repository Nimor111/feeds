Currently, the code is something like this: \n ```haskell import qualified Data.HashMap.Strict as H\n deleteValues (Object o) = Object $ H.delete \"values\" -- Currently removed \"values\" key. deleteValues _ = Object H.empty ```\n We had to change our JSON and we added a new key, which we don't want to consider when testing. This key can appear on several positions, not only at the top level like values.\n For example, we have something like this:\n json { \"values\": [], \"info\": \"ok\", \"key_to_remove\": 0, \"details\": null } \n Here the key_to_remove is only at the top level. But we could have something like:\n  { \"values\": [], \"info\": \"ok\", \"key_to_remove\": 1, \"details\": { \"info\": \"ok\", \"key_to_remove\": 2 } } \n The nesting can keep going on, and I really would like to avoid manually traversing the object looking and deleting the key.\n The idea is to remove all key_to_remove from the JSON object, independent of the position or value that it holds.\n  \nEdit: solution:\n haskell deleteKey :: Text -> Value -> Value deleteKey k (Object o) = Object $ H.delete k (deleteKey k <$> o) deleteKey k (Array arr) = Array (deleteKey k <$> arr) deleteKey _ v = v \n    submitted by    /u/valcron1000  \n [link]   [comments]",

The idea would be to read ONE document really long in 4 or 5 different columns. I noticed that if I open an emacs instance I do not need too much width, so I can exploit the height of my laptop enlarging vertically the file, but the height is limited to around 25 cms in a laptop. Because org does not wrap the content on default, I can open an instance vertically in 1/5 of the screen width, so 4/5 of the screen are not used at all! There is an option to open a subsection on the right of the first instance, but why not opening different columns and see all the long document or almost, so that in one single screen we may have an outline on 2-3- 4 or even 5 columns on almost all the document. So that we may scroll one column for instance the second and so the all the columns also scroll accordingly, so that we can see for instance almost all the chapters of a huge book , then could open some paragraphs title of chapter 33 and 56, and compare them together, move content in seconds etc. The simple idea is that people say mindmaps give more an helicopter vision of all the document(and in fact mind maps take all the screen), everyone in the org community debates if files should have links or stay in a single file.Why not giving to the users the possibility to open multiple columns with scrolling integration, so that the user can see huge documents with a glance, be more creative, modify things, search occurrences, it would be genial imo, because org supports different colors per level on default, and would be really easy to spot the structure and be more efficient, combine new ideas creatively, never miss the big picture, etc\n    submitted by    /u/ndrokky  \n [link]   [comments]",

I could do the same from within emacs I'm sure.\n I have one file per chapter, which is natural and works for me. I can maybe be dissuaded. I think every file wants a `#+TITLE:`, at least because pandoc requires it or complains. If I output \"one chapter\" (file), everything looks great. The (chapter) title looks just the way I like it.\n If I do the following with pandoc:\n pandoc -s *.org -o my_book.pdf \n The problem is that the titles of the chapters end up all mashed together at the top of the document. Everything is more or less perfect.\n Should I maybe just not do this and manage this as one big doc, using hideability to deal with the unwieldiness?

I can not figure out how it is being overwritten. It seems like it is doing org-cycle global as it will cycle all headers in the file. When I do C-h k I get this: \n ``` S-TAB runs the command org-shifttab (found in org-mode-map), which is an interactive compiled Lisp function in ‘org.el’.\n It is bound to <backtab>, S-TAB, <S-tab>, <S-iso-leftab>, <menu-bar> <Tbl> <Previous Field>, <menu-bar> <Org> <Show/Hide> <Cycle Global Visibility>. ``` The binding C-S-i doesn't show up in C-h m or C-h b either. The other windmove bindings do show up in C-h b though. When I'm in another buffer with a different mode all of my windmove bindings work fine. It seems to just happen with org buffers.\n I'm really scratching my head as I can't find any smoking gun to what's actually being called or how it is bound.\n    submitted by    /u/jesse_ee  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "So evil-collection doesn't have bindings for org-mode; however, what it does have are bindings for outline-mode (which org is derived from). The issue is, evil-collection will bind e.g. M-<return> to outline-insert-heading in outline-mode, but then org-keys.el remaps outline-insert-heading to org-ctrl-c-ret in org-mode - with the end result being that M-<return> is bound to org-ctrl-c-ret in org-mode instead of org-meta-return!\n There are a couple instances of this issue, and evil-org-mode doesn't fix most of them. Mostly, what I want to know is if there's a canonical way to keep the evil-collection bindings for outline-mode (which I use to edit a specific document format for my job), while at the same time preventing org-keys.el from remapping those evil-bound versions.\n I thought loading org first might prevent this issue, but that doesn't seem to be the case; here's a init.el to reproduce it. Just open an org mode buffer and do C-h k M-<return> to see that org-meta-return isn't being bound correctly. Is my only option rebinding everything by hand?\n    submitted by    /u/summetria  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hey all,\n I already use emacs to take notes for classes like history or geology or other heavily text based classes.\n However, I'm still forced to take math notes by hand, both for speed reasons and for graphical reasons - representing math in a text editor is hard to do for complex stuff.\n Of course something like x2 becomes x^2, but that's both not nice to read and doesn't work well when it's more complex (starts a spam of parentheses).\n I've never worked with org mode (currently just take notes into text files), and I know I should probably port my txt file notes into that. So I guess side question - tips for getting started with basic org mode?\n However that aside, main question is: is there a way to represent math quickly in a text format and have it display like it would if written manually on paper? I know emacs can display images in buffers almost like Microsoft Word can... Some kind of \"render this math as an image of how it should look on paper\"?\n I assume the profs use some sort of tool to generate pretty formatted math for stuff like HW and exams, but I have no idea what they use. It almost looks like the kind of output you get from typing \"one line\" math into Wolfram alpha.\n A big important thing though is speed - if it's some kind of super complex markup lang that'll take me forever to write, no good. I gotta be able to generate this about as fast as I could write it on paper, or at least a basic thing I could go back and pretty up after class.\n Does something like that exist?\n    submitted by    /u/Gangsir  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "evil-redirect-digit-argument binds a wrapper function that calls digit-argument if a prefix command has been started and another, default function otherwise. However, after spending some time in the evil codebase, I'm wondering if it's necessary at all.\n The only immediate use I can see for this is to handle how \"0\" works, which is the only place this function is actually used in the evil codebase. That is, if a count argument has been started, you want 0 to be interpreted as being a part of the count argument (e.g. d 10 j) while if a count argument hasn't been started, you want 0 to be interpreted as evil-beginning-of-line (e.g. d0).\n Since evil-beginning-of-line is a motion, I'm pretty sure any use of it will pass through evil-read-motion, which uses evil-keypress-parser - which contains logic that makes me think evil-redirect-digit-argument might not be necessary.\n evil-keypress-parser has a specific hardcoded check for evil-beginning-of-line's wrapper function. This hardcoded check seems to do the exact same thing evil-redirect-digit-argument already does - i.e. if you hit a 0 and it's not the first number in the sequence, just add it to the count argument, and if you hit a 0 and it is the first number in a sequence, interpret it as evil-beginning-of-line and complete the key sequence.\n I tried removing the use of evil-redirect-digit-argument and changing the hard-coded check (a two line change) and everything seemed to still be working: d0, d10j d203k, etc.\n Is there a reason for evil-redirect-digit-argument to exist that I'm missing?\n    submitted by    /u/summetria  \n [link]   [comments]",

For files I use ranger, ueberzug and sxiv for images, neomutt for emails, tmux for tabs and sessions, and there's so many other terminal applications that do the job that is never supposed to be done by vim. Vim is just a great text editor. How can it be said that vim can't view images or browse github or reply to emails but emacs can... I mean there's a tonne of terminal applications that do those jobs.\n I have no grudge against emacs but I'm a terminal user, I use dwm to manage windows, most of the fancy terminal applications that do emails and stuff.... So to move forward with emacs, I wish to know the benefits I'd have. To make it more simple I'll break it down into two parts :\n  \nemacs as editor or vim\n emacs as not an editor or the terminal\n  \nFor the first part IG everyone would agree upon vim. Isn't that the reason why we have evil mode? and IDK the answer to the second part and I can't even say because I've used terminal applications but haven't explored the 'other than text editor' capabilities of emacs.

          "description": "Every time I go to edit something in the HTML family, emacs drops me into a mode called sgml-mode. It includes a very aggressive completion layer using skeletons, that as soon as you open a < it picks a list of html tags to use, then allowed attributes for each. The problem is, I cannot figure out how to get out of the freaking menu. It wants to keep adding attributes until the cows come home. Then, when I manage to escape it, any manual editing HTML-encodes any special characters like \" and >.\n The really maddening thing is that I seem to be the only person who struggles with this. What am I missing? Is there a proper user's guide to sgml-mode? Can I just disable it? How do I leave this cursed place?

Git gutter provides information about the start and end line numbers of the hunks. I also provides the content of the hunks, but obviously without properties (this makes sense -- git doesn't deal in propertised text). I thought it would be cool to have a swiper-like interface where the hunk text I see in my ivy listing does have the properties it has in the buffer -- it would make it easier to spot what's what. \n Simple then, for each hunk, I'll just lift the text, with properties, between the start and end line. I thought there would be a function for this, but I can't find one. I know a few ways I could do it (e.g. go to the beginning of the start line, get the char number, goto end of end line, get the char number and use buffer-substring), but it seems like such a basic thing I'm sure there must be a good, canonical way.\n Is there?\n    submitted by    /u/Jack-o-tall-tales  \n [link]   [comments]",

This fundamental component is missing from an estimated 96% of digital zettelkastens.\nLuhmann outlines this fundamental component in the very beginning of his paper on how his zettelkasten works.\n\n    \nInformation is an intra-systematic event. It results when one compares one message or entry with regard to other possibilities. Information, accordingly, originates only in systems which possess a comparative schema—even if this amounts only to: \"this or something else.\"\n\n  \n  \nYou see, built into every single note in Luhmann's system is one requirement: he must decide where the note belongs. It forces associations, and associations stand as the fundamental building block of human memory. One must decide if the note is associated with this or something else. It is a comparative schema built into the very root of Luhmann's antinet zettelkasten, which surfaces the magic of his system.\nUnfortunately, this fundamental component is watered down to near extinction in the world of digital zettelkastens.\n\n\n(Source: https://daily.scottscheper.com/num/243/)\nThe idea of \"must decide where the note belongs\", while true, misses the point of multiple context within the zettelkasten, as Luhmann was trying to come up with an alternative to filing notes using folders.

Those should be considered \"literature notes\" in the context of zettelkasten. I find it confusing having these notes in a single file, so I split them by topic or anecdote. But I don't like to have my computer crammed with tons of files. When I read a new book on the same topic, rather than creating new notes and linking them, I tend to group the notes I already have with new notes who adds info to the same topic or details to the same anecdote. Still, I keep a reference to the original source (in the form of citation).\nTo better explain what I do:\nI read a book about a writer and I take a note on an episode of his life (which we'll call NOTE 1).\nAnother episode of his life goes to a different note (NOTE 2) in the same folder.\nI read another book and I find some detail on the same episode as NOTE 1. I don't create a new note but I add it to NOTE 1 and eventually add a citation for the new source.\nI read a book about a chemist and I take a note about one of his discoveries in the specific folder of that book/project. It isn't directly related to the episode of NOTE 1, but I think linking them can bring to a new perspective. I create NOTE 3 and link NOTE 1 and NOTE 3.\nIs that a good practice, or is it better to have a single file for the notes coming from a book, then different super short notes for concepts I want to keep from each book?",

From Wikipedia:\n\n  \nThe multi-armed bandit problem models an agent that simultaneously attempts to acquire new knowledge (called \"exploration\") and optimize their decisions based on existing knowledge (called \"exploitation\"). The agent attempts to balance these competing tasks in order to maximize their total value over the period of time considered.\n\n\nIn the case of the Collector, the \"agent\" explores indefinitely and adds to their collection but postpones making the decision to do something with it. Wikipedia gives a list of practical applications of the multi-armed bandit problem, but I can't resist pointing out that the problem of deciding which professor's class to take is almost never counted among such lists, perhaps because professors compile them. Someone choosing among Zettelkasten implementations without really settling on one is another.\nGiven that the multi-armed bandit problem has a name, has been extensively studied since at least the middle of the twentieth century and has been solved in important cases, one question is whether some of these solutions could guide the Collector toward more productive uses of their time.",
