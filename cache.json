I think a lot of haskellers just use them without giving it much thought.\n But my question: what other languages offer such features? I know OCaml has its ppx mechanism that lets you do this (viz: ppx_deriving with more information on such things at the Ocaml metaprogramming page). I can't actually think of other languages that do it in quite this way.\n Of course a lot of very dynamic languages (in the SmallTalk family) let you do this. So I'm mainly interested in 1) typed languages (sorry Racket, doing 'TypedRacket' with macros is very cool, but quite different; a 'deriving' mechanism *for* TypedRacket would be in scope, if it exists) and 2) where this is done in a wholly separate phase, i.e. not at run-time.\n    submitted by    /u/carette  \n [link]   [comments]",

In the assembly generation stage, an abstract syntax tree is converted into a List of x64 instructions.\n To model a C language expression as an AST node, I used this algebraic type:\n data Expression = Value Int | Unary Uop Expression | Binary Bop Expression Expression\n The Expression type is used to represented nested unary and binary expressions such as -2, -(~2), 1+3, (6 *2) + (5* (9 -2)), etc... Uop and Bop are unary and binary operators, respectively.\n Parsing these expressions recursively looks like a classic fold operation, and I implemented my own folding function that works. But I can't help but feel there's a better approach to this, a better abstraction to traverse a recursive data structure and \"flatten\" it into a List.\n Obviously I can't use Foldable since the datatype is not kind `* -> *`. Would it make sense to use a phantom type so that Expression is of kind `* -> *`?\n Any thoughts or suggestions would be helpful. Thanks\n    submitted by    /u/JadeXY  \n [link]   [comments]",

And it also seems like the conduit code suggests you just compose things with await and yield, instead of using more standard combinators like fmap, mapM and fold (although their are Conduit specific versions of things like fmap and fold which one can use).\n I feel like the conduit interface is a bit more clunky and not as \"Haskell like\".

Have a journeyman level understanding of other languages, have worked in SW for three years and counting.\n I have been making my way through the haskell MOOC (the university of Helsinki one). I stumbled on these two books which, by the accounts I have read previously, seem to go into more depth mathematically with respect to haskell. In the mean time tryng build up on C++, and learning small bits of CL here and there as well to get more perspective and be a better problem solver overrall.\n So, what I'm asking:\n From my understanding, Hutton (Programming in Haskell) is drier than Bird (Thinking Functionally With Haskell), though both are solid texts with a good backing in math (i.e. strong on the \"equational reasoning\" front EDIT: category theory is welcome too), and wanted to see if there was a consensus on either of them, or at least consolidate people's different opinions and experience between the two, especially from people who have read both. There hasn't the been most testimony comparing and contrasting the two as I've seen scouring this subreddit.\n I ask because I would rather not approach FP just as a programmer but in addition and moreso as a computer scientist instead (in the way SICP aims to teach CS book and is not simply a Scheme tutorial).\n Other books that have come on my radar (for this purpose) are: The Haskell Book (aka Haskell from First Principles) and Introduction to Computation: Haskell, Logic and Automata.\n That's about all, cheers!\n    submitted by    /u/Glittering-Escape-74  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "We are working on a project and need to both create SVGs and read our created SVGs (or also user supplied SVGs, but we can specify which SVG elemtns are allowed).\n When reading svgs we need to know which shapes are contained in the svgs (only circles and rectangles are relevant for us). If there are shapes using the svg <rect>, <circle>/<ellipse> in the file this would certainly make life easier for reading the svg.\n Mainly based on another post https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/tlvopj/looking_for_svg_library_recommendations/ I've found the following libraries that supports both reading and writing:\n  \nsvg-tree: Features both reading and writing. But reading and writing seems to not be super easy but I was able to accomplish both things as a POC. Also the documentation is almost non existent. For an easier to use writing interface I imagine that we could also use lucid-svg.\n \ndiagrams with diagrams-svg and diagrams-input: Features both reading and writing. The writing api is amazing and really well documented! And I was able to read an svg file created by the library into a Diagrams type. But I was not able to find a way how I can find out what shapes are contained in this Diagram (what circles and rectangles are there in the file?). It doesn't seem to be easily possible, as it just saves Paths in the types and also in the file? But maybe I'm wrong. Unfortunately combining the writing API of diagrams and using the svg-tree library to parse them also doesn't seem to be easily possible, as again, only paths are saved in the file.\n \n Does someone know whether this is possible using diagrams? Or does someone have any suggestions on a different library we could use to read or write an svg?

          "description": "Hey, folks, new to Haskell. I find that I learn best by mucking up code - get some code to work, then try to refactor it to see it in a new light. Stuck on this gem and hope to get some insight from you all:\n Context: I'm working towards a text adventure app where you put the name of the adventure in as a command line argument: `LaunchAdventure --adventure myAdventure:`.\n This works:\n -- #1 greet :: AdventureOptions -> IO () greet (AdventureOptions a ) = putStrLn $ \"You chose: '\" ++ a ++ \"'.\" main :: IO () main = (greet =<< parse) >> putStrLn \"And just for testing\" \n Where parse is of type parse :: IO AdventureOptions (I'm using the optparse-applicative package as part of this experiment).\n What I want to do is to see if I can get rid of thegreet function completely. I've cobbled a few attempts together like these:\n -- #2 main = \\a -> putStrLn $ \"You chose: '\" ++ a ++ \"'.\" =<< parse -- or this messy attempt: -- #3 main = \\a -> parse >>= putStrLn $ \"You chose: '\" ++ (a :: AdventureOptions) ++ \"'.\" \n But I keep running into errors like \"Couldn't match expected type ‚Äò[Char]‚Äô with actual type ‚ÄòAdventureOptions‚Äô\" (with regards to a) or worse. I get what the error is saying; what I can't figure out is how to solve it inline.\n The working greet example (#1) has the function declaration of greet :: AdventureOptions -> IO () so I gather that that is how the compiler is inferring things there. How does one indicate that type in an inline fashion?\n Is \"casting\" a to AdventureOptions a possibility in some way? I know I've seen documentation regarding in-line type syntax, but can't find a solid example that is applicable here. And is a lambda even the right thing to attempt here at all?\n    submitted by    /u/KopperThoughts  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have studied that video over and over trying to understand why exactly is a certain abstraction he uses so useful and refactorable. Implementing interfaces/typeclasses for some types for certain transformations to be applicable on those types and then getting these other auto-derived transformations for the type so seamlessly is mind-blowing. And then the main recipe is this whole abstraction for the parser itself which is wrapped in generic parser type that as I understand allows for seamless composition and maybe... better semantic meaning or something?\n Now the problem is though I understand at least some of the design abstractions for this specific problem (and still learning functions like *> and <* which still trip me), I dont get how to scale this skill to spot these clever abstractions in other problems and especially how to use typeclasses. Is the average Haskeller expected to understand this stuff easily and implement from scratch on his own or do they just follow these design principles put in place by legendary white paper author programmers without giving much thought?

          "description": "What do you think about open source software bounties? I keep seeing them, for instance SoftwareMill offering them in the ScalaTimes letter today, or com-lihaoyi a while ago, or John DeGoes in his new Golem venture.\n They seem to offer developers a chance to contribute to open source code, hone their coding skills, get experience, and they might also be getting paid for that work.\n I considered contributing to one of com-lihaoyi bounties, specifically, implementing support for ms sql. However, I noticed someone else got the torch. And that gets to my point. You have N developers working on the same thing. Sure it works to the advantage of the entity that issued the bounties. But 1 out of the N developers will be successful. What if a developer starts working on it, then drops the ball because it turns out it is too much work and she/he doesn't have enough time? As a matter of fact, com-lihaoyi increased the bounty for ms sql support because there is more work than it was originally anticipated (see the pull request here: https://github.com/com-lihaoyi/scalasql/pull/29 ). Right now, I am not sure where that work is at.\n I feel that these bounties might drag (some) developers in a rat race. You might argue that a monetary retribution is better than nothing, and in the end nobody forces you to do anything if you don't want to, and I agree ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è . Maybe I am missing something about how the oss bounties work.\n I think the ideal process would be to hire a developer to commit and to do the work in a time frame agreed upon by both parties, and to pay her/him properly. But I understand that might not be always feasible due to lack of funds and time, hence the bounties. I would be interesting to see the real-life experience of a someone that issued bounties and how that turned out.\n    submitted by    /u/0110001001101100  \n [link]   [comments]",

One of my \"ongoing\" projects has a scala 2.13 codebase, and the owners of the product asked me to start a new product mostly based on the prev codebase. So I need to start a totally fresh project, but I need the ability to fastly convert \"old\" code to this new codebase.\n The old toolstack heavily used cats (ET and OT, and SemiGroups), tapir with circe, slick, and akka (mostly streams and http, but some typed actors too). It used a lot of other smaller things like shapeless to help slick with tuples, pureconf for config parsing. Also I had a lot of extender methods and some implicit converters.\n The questions; - How mature and widely used scala3 is? - Can copilot or other tools convert scala2 code to scala3? - Starting a scala2 codebase in 2024 is a bad idea? - Do we have good learning materials for adoption? - Should I learn new libs if I change to scala3 or I can keep most of my \"well known\" ones?\n    submitted by    /u/tg44  \n [link]   [comments]",

This isn‚Äôt a shill for just another blockchain, but an open-source platform packed with advanced scripting and cryptographic tools.\n You can experiment on the testnet or even fork your own chain to explore its potential. \n Ergo is built on Scala, and its scripting language, ErgoScript (which is also based on Scala), goes beyond Bitcoin‚Äôs scripting by using ErgoTree byte code. This allows for complex coin spending conditions, enabling things like ring signatures, multi-signatures, multiple currencies, atomic swaps, self-replicating scripts, and long-term computations. ErgoTree itself is a typed abstract syntax tree, essentially a smart signature that validates transactions based on custom rules. With Secret Data Predicates (digital signatures, secret keys) and Blockchain Context Predicates (transaction-specific conditions), ErgoTree supports a range of applications beyond crypto, such as (decentralised) CBDCs, new monetary systems, Local Exchange Trading Systems, and pretty much anything else you can think up, can be done on ergo!\n Many of Ergo‚Äôs solutions are grounded in formal research and have been presented at peer-reviewed conferences. While ErgoScript isn‚Äôt Turing complete on its own, Turing completeness can be achieved through transaction trees, as outlined in this peer-reviewed paper.\n For those looking to earn while they learn, there are various bounties up for grabs, with rewards in stablecoins like SigUSD and Gluon Gold. Check out open bounties on the reference client and interpreter/compiler, or join the upcoming ErgoHack.\n An (incomplete) list of all repositories that use scala can be accessed here\n    submitted by    /u/ergo_team  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I am considering switching to orgmode from Obsidian, so I am making the exact same post I made on Obsidian, since I would have a lot more incentive if orgmode or orgroam would have a way to do the things I mention in the following post, \n Over the summer I changed my workflow by taking rigorous notes on the textbook I was working through, as a result I ended up with a beautifully distilled version of the chapters (pictured below).\n https://preview.redd.it/9pxpid8fvutd1.png?width=1684&format=png&auto=webp&s=bf98f97a76d432b2530485811031a0fd6291e5b2\n Unfortunately even though these were great, this took too much time and I realized that I had spent a lot of time jotting down stuff that I could have just as easily highlighted. I needed to come up with a more efficient system, so after thinking about it for a while I came to the realization that the only new information in my notes would be of the following type:\n  \nExplaining a certain step of a derivation in more detail. (by adding more steps)\n Adding additional information that was relevant. (an alternate explanation or my own explanation)\n Connecting the given information with some other piece of information. (like how you link stuff in Obsidian)\n  \nThat's how I came to the realization that if I could have like the comment feature that you usually have in word, but with more obsidian features for pdfs then that would be a game changer. For example, being able to upload a textbook to obsidian, then highlight a word/sentence or para (or the space in the between them) and then be able to write comments on it (both in Latex and normal text) or to be able to link that with other notes.\n I would be extremely grateful if somebody could let me know if there is a way to implement these features.\n Thnx!\n    submitted by    /u/Mental-Repair-6141  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi,\n I'm a beginner in using emacs (20++ years working in vim and recently nvim), for some time now I've been using org mode in emacs as a combination calendar/todo/notebook. I keep my files on a shared google drive, I've also connected it to org-mobile on my phone and generally it works ok, I'm quite happy with it.\n However, I recently read a book about building a second brain and decided to tidy up the system a bit. While writing or linking notes is not a problem, I probably don't understand the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãtags/properties or I have something set up wrong with the search. No matter how I set tags in my notes, I can't search for them. It looks a bit like the search only works in a few files that I have in my org-agenda-files(and even then not always) and nowhere else.\n I want to be able to search for topics, e.g. by tags in my entire \"second brain\" without adding them all to my agenda. I'm just afraid that soon I'll have dozens (hundreds?) of files and emacs will take half an hour to start. What's the best way to do it?\n P.S. I've been recently reading about org-roam , but I'm afraid it's a bit too complicated, especially since it requires a working database, which will severely limit file portability between platforms...\n    submitted by    /u/parasit  \n [link]   [comments]",

Will be working on some el code to prototype what we're discussing here, and will share back. Appreciate your time.\n \n Hi community. I've used Emacs for over 30 years. I've recently started using it again for python and react development. While I love some of what Emacs has to offer, it's continued to be a frustrating and problematic ramp. It's hard to get it where I need it as a professional developer.\n Even after all these years, I still feel Emacs has so much untapped potential, but there's problems holding it back.\n Rather than just walk away, I decided to write up and share my ideas. I want to give back to Emacs by collaborating on a solution that gets it used and driving real value for more people.\n The document shares ideas on how to help developers quickly get productive with Emacs on the tasks that matter to them. I deeply believe we can increase the number of developers who try Emacs, get value quickly enough to use it more, and promote its virtues to friends.\n https://github.com/gregfelice/emacs-dx/tree/main\n if you want to help build and launch this, hit me up on https://discord.com/invite/9F4DSE25r7\n    submitted by    /u/grokgov1969  \n [link]   [comments]",

He's a thirty-something and had never even heard of it. I didn't have a great answer... muscle memory? learned in college? macros? it works the same everywhere? highly portable? All these answers are somewhat... outdated these days. That said, whenever I'm forced to use vscode, and even think about a mouse when coding, I loathe it. That hatred of the IDE slows me down.

I must say my config file is totally based in other config file I followed from System Crafter videos. I'm so happy and want to get more and more from Emacs. I use Intelij IDEA to develop on a Java project with Cuba framework, and I would like to use emacs instead. Mostly I only need autocompletion, Fast Class switching, Go to definition and so on...and launch gradle tasks like build, deploy. The things is I don't have idea how. I followed the config from the video \"From Vanilla Emacs to Java\" but I don't get autocompletion at all. Thanks \n    submitted by    /u/DevGiuDev  \n [link]   [comments]",

All this changed rapidly at this new company.\n Now, my team leader left the company and got replaced with another one who has never had a managerial position before and is trying to micromanage me, which I resent with a passion, not just because of my character (who if I am being honest, responds well to criticism under conditions) but also because I feel he is not quite on par with my own skill level (perceived or not). I mean, I would ideally like to have a superior who I admire (perceived or not) and can learn from, and then I would embrace and indeed welcome both the manager and the criticism.\n Anyway, Now how does this relates to Emacs?\n Well, this guy at work cannot understand the way I program. It seems extremely alien to him because I find myself using common Elisp and functional idioms.\n I have started naming thinks like (buffer-or-name) or what have you.\n The use of monoids, etc etc.\n So, Emacs has forever made me an alien to the standard workplace culture.\n I mean this guy wants me to take my nicely single purpose functions and put them\n all within a Class in one huge file.\n I do not know if I can take it.\n How is this funny?\n I do not know, I find it funny that a 50 year old program is causing such trouble for a person 50 years after its inception.\n Thank you for your time.\n With <3 pnoul\n    submitted by    /u/pnoulis  \n [link]   [comments]",

I would prefer to be able to define my layouts in elisp but I don't see a great way to do that with activities.el.\n Perhaps I've over-looked a possibility?

I had an idea for a package, but it's the sort of thing that feels like it must already exist, and I'd love to look at existing packages before reinventing the wheel. \n The basic idea would be that you could schedule code to run using org agenda entries with timestamps. For example, you could write an entry like \n * Update the package cache :exec: :PROPERTIES: :TaskName: update-package-cache :END: <2024-10-14 Mon 14:00-16:00 +1w> \n Then you'd define a search like +exec and associate functions to various task names. The package would provide a function/mode to set up timers to watch the agenda and run scheduled tasks when emacs is idle within the scheduled window. Maybe if the entry is a TODO, update the timestamp with org-mark-done.\n But yeah, this feels like the sort of thing that would already exist in some form. I've seen a few packages to notify about tasks, but not to act on them more generally. If anyone has any leads/thoughts, I'd appreciate it.

          "description": "Reading the thread of remaking emacs in a modern environment, apart from the C-core fixes and improvements, as always there were a lot of comments about elisp.\n There are a lot of people that criticize elisp. Ones do because they don't like or directly hate the lisp family, they hate the parentheses, believe that it's \"unreadable\", etc.; others do because they think it would be better if we had common lisp or scheme instead of elisp, a more general lisp instead of a \"specialized lisp\" (?).\n Just so you understand a bit better my point of view: I like programming, but I haven't been to university yet, so I probably don't understand a chunk of the most theoric part of programming languages. When I program (and I'm not fiddling with my config), I mainly do so In low level, imperative programming languages (Mostly C, but I've been studying cpp and java) and python.\n That said, what makes elisp a great language for emacs (for those who it is)?\n  \nIs it because of it being a functional language? Why? Then, do you feel other functional languages could accomplish the same? Why/why no?\n \nIs it because of it being a \"meta-programming language\"? (whatever that means exactly) why? Then, do you feel other metaprogramming languages could accomplish the same? Why/why no?\n \nIs it because of it being reflective? Why? Then do you feel other reflective languages could accomplish the same? Why/why no?\n \nIs it because of it being a lisp? Why? Do you think other lisp dialects would be better?\n \nIs it because it's easier than other languages to implement the interpreter in C?\n \n Thanks\n    submitted by    /u/vslavkin  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have to hold Ctrl for a split-second, then g for it to work.\n Oddly this is only an issue if I'm focused on a buffer with display-line-numbers-mode on. If I turn it off, the problem goes away.\n This also only affects my Moonlander, a QMK keyboard. I tried using a standard keyboard and it was fine.\n I checked wevand the only difference is that the Moonlander registers the g input immediately (1 ms) after Ctrl, whereas the standard keyboard registered it around 100ms after.\n Is there a reason why keyboard-quit would not work if the interval between Ctrl and g is too short indisplay-line-numbers-mode? Is it because a keystroke will trigger some sort of background process or refresh - and that's the process I'm quitting with C-g if I do it too quickly?\n Thanks in advance if anyone has any ideas.\n    submitted by    /u/barnaclesaretasty  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have a feature branch with many commits, and master has a few commits past the branch point. I desired to squash the commits and rebase my feature onto the current tip of master to stay updated.\n Here's what I did:\n  \nI switched to master, and made sure to pull the local branch to the tip.\n \nI switched to my working branch, and made sure the origin was pushed and up to date with the current commit level, and stashed the current modified files.\n I performed a rebase onto branch with r b and selected the local master branch.\n I rewrote the commit for the first commit of the series and squashed the rest.\n‚Ä¶",

          "description": "Recently someone asked about filling (aka wrapping) text within columns. It's a useful feature, so I added it to the simple package speedrect, which implements a little modal interface that comes alive during rectangle-selection mode.\n Just highlight a rectangular region of text (C-M-mouse-1 works great, or C-x SPACE then move), and hit f to wrap. The wrap width defaults to the rectangle's width (e.g. to expand an existing wrapped block). Otherwise, use a numeric prefix (e.g. M-20 f) or regular prefix (C-u f) to prompt for the width. The selected rectangle's height sets the height of the safe fill region (usually extending down to the next distinct \"row\" of data). If the newly filled text exceeds this height, additional lines are added below.\n speedrect has lots of other useful features for moving rectangles around, operating on them, and sending them back and forth to calc. To use it, just select a rectangle...\n    submitted by    /u/JDRiverRun  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "What is Aider\n Aider is an AI pair programming tool in the terminal. It allows you to pair program with large language models (LLMs) to edit code in your local Git repository. You can start a new project or work with an existing Git repo. Aider works best with GPT-4 or Claude 3.5 Sonnet and can connect to almost any LLM. The GitHub page for Aider is GitHub - Aider-AI/aider: aider is AI pair programming in your terminal, and the project currently has nearly 20k stars.\n Aider has performed well in solving real coding problems on SWE-bench.\n Introducing Aider.el\n Recently, the Cursor editor has been gaining popularity. As a long-time Emacs user, I don't want to switch to Cursor just because of AI. Currently, Aider only has plugins for Vim and VSCode, but Emacs has a tradition of integrating command-line tools. So I decided to write my own, as a humble attempt: GitHub - tninja/aider.el: aider emacs plugin forhttps://github.com/paul-gauthier/aider.\n This plugin offers the following advantages over using Aider directly from the command line:\n  \nPop-up menu: No need to remember commands. (aider-transient-menu)\n Git repository-specific Aider sessions in Emacs: It automatically identifies the Git repository of the current file and creates a new Aider session for it. Multiple Aider sessions can exist for different Git repositories, allowing you to work on several repositories simultaneously without interference.\n Region-based refactor support: You can select a region (e.g., a code block) in a file and ask Aider to refactor it.\n  \nIn fact, most of this plugin itself was generated using Aider / aider.el.\n If you're interested in AI-assisted programming and, like me, prefer not to leave the Emacs environment, perhaps you could give Aider and aider.el a try. I would appreciate any feedback or suggestions you have about aider.el. Thank you!\n    submitted by    /u/Sad_Construction_773  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Let me paint a picture for you all: I do some technical writing using org-mode (mostly papers on computer science), but I must confess I got a terrible spelling, both in my mother tongue and English, so spell checking is a must to everything I do. \n I used to use flyspell + enchant, but it would cause severe lag (I tend to write hole documents in one file), so I have changed to jinx, and it's amazing in terms of performance. One thing I think I could upgrade in my workflow, is that the suggestions are too far off the real word I mean, even thought the error is somewhat minor, most of the words I don't even know existed! \n On the other hand, I also have ltex installed, and its suggestions are 99% of the time on point, but it comes at the cost of only updating when I save the buffer and being somewhat slow. So to do a final pass is great, but to spell check while writing is impossible.\n One other thing I have seen in the past but never got my head around doing was using dabbrev to fix recurring mistakes, but I don't think this would solve the problem. Another (crazy) idea is to use some small LLM to better predict the word based on context, but if LanguageTool can do it without it (I think), is there any other way?\n So, anyone have tackled those difficulties?

The main focus is to offer a simple, Neovim-user friendly setup for those who are curious about Emacs, without asking them to fully transition or embrace the entire \"Emacs way\" of doing things.\n Some key features:\n  \nNo need for GUI, making it tmux, zellij, lazygit, starship, and terminal tool friendly\n Vim bindings as default\n Treesitter and LSP pre-configured\n Simple defaults based on kickstart.nvim for familiarity\n  \nThe idea is for Emacs to act as a secondary tool, not as a replacement for Neovim, so users can experiment and explore Emacs without feeling overwhelmed by setups like Doom or Spacemacs.\n The project is almost ready, and I‚Äôd love to get feedback from the Emacs community. This could also be a helpful entry point for Neovim users who want to dip their toes into Emacs without too much complexity.\n If anyone would be interested in testing it or offering feedback, I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts!\n Wish me luck over at r/neovim üòä\n A preview: \n https://preview.redd.it/jhhn5wfhqssd1.png?width=1239&format=png&auto=webp&s=4a47ec15ecad880bad5e381cb40732b2cc90c42f\n    submitted by    /u/LionyxML  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Doing academic research, I often have cases where I want to reference, for example, a specific chapter from a book (like collective works, or collected essays from one author). I create these as individual items in my library (exported as bibtex by Zotero/better bibtex but I don't think that is important). I would like to be able to keep the notes for these chapters connected to the source book, but I can't figure out how to get citar-open-notes to recognise this. Calling citar-open-notes for a new library item creates a new org file with the appropirate metadata (including roam-refs) and the citekey as the filename; this is fine default behaviour, but I'd like it to first check if the citekey already exists as a roam_refs property in another file before creating a new one.\n Can I get it to do this somehow?

It provides a simple and lightweight way to access the web from within the Emacs environment. EWW was originally written by Lars Ingebrigtsen and is now maintained by the GNU Emacs project.\n One of the key features of EWW is its ability to display web pages inline, without requiring an external browser. This is achieved through the use of an HTML renderer, shr.el, which renders HTML pages directly within the Emacs buffer. EWW also supports viewing PDFs inline, using the doc-view-mode, and can be customized using the mailcap mechanism.\n EWW has several unique features that set it apart from other web browsers. It can display images inline, if Emacs was built with image support, and can block specific images completely by customizing shr-blocked-images. Additionally, EWW uses the colors declared in the HTML page, but adjusts them if needed to maintain a certain minimum contrast.\n Users can interact with EWW using a variety of commands, including eww-copy-page-url to copy the URL of the current page into the kill ring, and eww-bookmark-kill to delete bookmarks. EWW also provides a buffer for managing bookmarks, which can be accessed using M-x eww-bookmarks.\n EWW is highly customizable, with many variables and options available for tweaking its behavior. For example, the eww-history-limit variable controls the number of history entries kept, and can be set to nil to allow the history list to grow indefinitely. Additionally, users can customize image display using shr-inhibit-images and shr-blocked-images.\n Overall, Emacs EWW provides a convenient and flexible way to access the web from within Emacs, making it an attractive option for developers and power users who value the integration and customization offered by the Emacs environment.\n    submitted by    /u/epiphanicalDeduction  \n [link]   [comments]",

It turned out that a lot of it was less task-oriented and more introspective: things about my future, things about how I should engage with parts of the world, and so forth. The only \"next action\" I could get for these was to journal about it.\n Now, I'm attempting to determine how I should organize journal-notes like these. I think extracting parts of my introspective writing into its own note, and linking those notes together would have value to me (I don't particularly think I'd want to duplicate a full-on Zettelkasten system, but parts of it seem useful to pick up). But I don't really know. A lot of the systems I've read about are either about explicit actionability (GTD, PARA...) or about synthesizing sources and finding interesting connections (Zettelkasten). Is there anything for structured introspection? does anyone do that, and what does your system look like?\n    submitted by    /u/ValuableBuffalo  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hey folks!\n I just hacked together a clone of Python's instructor library and I'm looking for early feedback. That library makes using LLMs programmatically very convenient and it seems elisp would benefit from that.\n The core of what Instructor does is allow coders to define a class in Python and then to use that class to define the function-calling / JSON structured output of the LLM as well as instantiate that class based on the response of the LLM. So I tried to replicate this with defstructs as I could.\n Here's the link to the repo (obviously it's called instructor.el). It's fewer than 100 lines of code at the moment. https://github.com/Trevoke/instructor.el\n And the basic usage pattern looks like this:\n (setq llm (make-llm-ollama :chat-model \"llama3.1\")) ;; for valid types see the help for `make-llm-function-arg' and look at the type. (instructor-defstruct dnd-character (name nil :type string :description \"The character's name\") (class nil :type string :description \"The character's class\") (race nil :type string :description \"The character's race in the D&D setting\") (skills nil :type (list string) :description \"The skills the character has\")) (instructor-call :llm llm :type 'dnd-character :prompt \"Make a starter character for D&D 5th edition.\") ;; (#s(dnd-character :name \"Eilif Stonefist\" :class \"Fighter\" :race \"Human\" :skills ;; [\"Acrobatics\" \"Athletics\"])) \n    submitted by    /u/Trevoke  \n [link]   [comments]",

I didn't structure it this way, it's something provided to me. In any event I think I have all the submodules fetched, however I'm getting a strange reaction from magit on this last one I know about.\n In this directory, at the command line if I issue git status it comes back with information about the version controlled module. It's in a detached HEAD state, but that's alright for the moment. Basically it reports just fine.\n If I am in magit, and I start at the top, and then open submodules on the way down, when I get to this submodule it says \"Corrupt Git configuration\". I find this puzzling since Git status seems to work.\n Any ideas on what is going on here?

I really don‚Äôt have much time to keep switching between editors, so I‚Äôm looking for something I can stick with long-term.\n Here‚Äôs some context:\n  \nI type at around 150 WPM, so I want something fast and efficient.\n I‚Äôve been using both Neovim and Emacs for about two months, and I‚Äôm comfortable with the keybindings of both.\n I like Neovim because it feels simpler and more straightforward, which is great since I‚Äôm learning a lot of new things (programming, using i3wm, etc.).\n However, Emacs is appealing because it seems to be this all-in-one tool where you can do everything from text editing to managing your entire workflow. Plus, I have to admit, using Emacs makes me feel a bit superior, like it‚Äôs a ‚Äúpower user‚Äù tool, which makes my decision even harder.\n  \nOne important thing: I also want to focus on building actual projects rather than spending too much time customizing my editor. Neovim feels more minimal, which might help me stay focused, but at the same time, I wonder if I‚Äôd be missing out on something Emacs offers, like Org mode for note-taking, which I‚Äôve heard is amazing.\n Ultimately, I want to commit to one text editor for life. I don‚Äôt want to spend months switching between them or tweaking configurations. My goal is to focus on programming, taking notes, and building real projects‚Äîwithout getting too distracted by endlessly customizing my editor.\n So, should I stick with Neovim and its simplicity, or is it worth diving into Emacs for its extra features and potential? I‚Äôd really appreciate your advice, especially from anyone who‚Äôs been in a similar position.\n Thanks in advance for your help!\n    submitted by    /u/Icy-Wrap-4410  \n [link]   [comments]",

This post is not intended to rekindle that debate (and that false dichotomy, as I now see it), but merely to report my method and how it helps me, in case others find it useful.\nI exclusively used the timestamp method until I read the Bob Doto book, which completely changed by Zk practice, and now I happily merge the two.\nFirst, the benefits of the two methods, as I have seen them expressed here. The timestamp method is flexible, and does not force us to choose a pre-meditated structure; the ZK can grow organically.

But every attempt, over decades, from pen and paper to Obsidian to Notion, has ended in a mess that becomes unusable. Once the system gets bloated, I start over with the best intentions, trying to keep things simple. I've lost countless hours in this cycle and hope to figure out where I'm going wrong before I start again.\nI have thousands of ideas, thoughts, journal entries, research, etc.\nI have various ways to jot things down quickly, but if I don't categorize them, I know I‚Äôll never look at them again, especially long journal entries. I used to record notes, which are automatically transcribed, but now I have hundreds or even thousands of transcriptions that are effectively meaningless. I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôll do with them, so they just pile up, collecting, not connecting.\nIf I try to organize them, that creates friction, and after a valiant effort, things get out of hand. There are too many notes and too many ways to link them, and many are just the same idea phrased differently.\nEven with proper linkages, at some point, 200 notes on a topic become clutter, and there‚Äôs no way to distill it when I need it.\nSometimes I feel like all this effort to manually do what my brain cannot is futile. If I‚Äôm writing something and want to reference a topic, I get overwhelmed by too much information.\nShould I stop trying, or is there a method that can help someone like me?\nI was excited about AI in Obsidian or Notion, but the results were inaccurate or incomplete (e.g., ‚Äúshow me all my notes on a topic‚Äù or ‚Äúhow many notes do I have?‚Äù give partial results). Maybe I didn‚Äôt set it up correctly, but figuring it out was too overwhelming.\nBest,\nR",

          "description": "I came across an analogy someone made about passion years ago that has stuck with me ever since. The analogy is:\nYou can tell if an Italian chef is still passionate about what they do not through the inspired specials or the amazing cannolis or tiramisu, but all you have to do is look at the red sauce. The red sauce is something they‚Äôre supposed to make fresh every day; It‚Äôs one of the main fundamentals of being an Italian chef. It‚Äôs also something that can easily become the mundane if they‚Äôre not careful. It‚Äôs in the fundamentals that a dip in passion is shown in.\nI‚Äôm VERY new to building my network of notes, so I‚Äôm curious, would most people put this analogy as a separate note like ‚ÄúRed Sauce Analogy‚Äù or would this live in a note for the overall concept titled ‚ÄúWhen passion slips, it shows in the mundane first‚Äù?",

Today, I still adhere to the core idea of reading freely, quickly noting everything that captures my interest, and then revisiting and processing those notes before adding them to my ZK, connecting them with existing ideas.\nThis is my second processing of @Sascha's article.

          "description": "TL;DR\nHello everyone!\nThis is my first post on the forum and I think it is due, as I have not been able to find an answer.\nThis current college year I started doing my zk on Obsidian and so far it's been wonderful!\nI know that each app is different and that it's better for me to adapt to those apps instead of looking for one that is perfect for my needs. \nYesterday I found Sublimeless Zettelkasten by @rene. It really meets all my needs, it's amazing!\nHowever I have never used IDs for my notes, but used the title directly; so all the links in my notes are like this: [[note-title]]. I know that Sublimeless ZK works with IDs so I added to all my notes an ID before the file name according to their creation date so that I could see them in the application.\nThe problem is in the links inside the notes (those I don't plan to change because they are exaggeratedly too many xd).\nI already read the README on GitHub of the application, but I understand little or almost no code, so my question is: \nAn apology if the question is very naive but I really loved Rene's app and would love to use it as soon as possible with my existing notes.\nBest regards and thanks for reading,\nAntonio",

I shared one of my Zettels and a query around it 2 weeks ago and I received some feedback that forced me to reflect on some fundamental questions.\nThe most pressing of which is - what exactly constitutes evidence?\nZettelkasten is a way to express my thought process, so if my thought and reasoning processes are flawed then I will end up with subpar knowledge. Requesting you all to lend your guidance and help me reach a deeper level of understanding.\nAdding some more context to the situation -\nIn one of my notes, I made a claim that growth follows certain principles.
