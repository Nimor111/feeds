          "description": "Hey all. After hearing so much about haskell.nix and its cross compilation capabilities, I finally decided to give it a go and try cross compiling some of my projects to arm linux and android.\n Following the guides provided by haskell.nix, I was able to get my projects building with nix, and successfully built some static binaries that ran on my pinephone using the aarch64-unknown-musl target. Unfortunately, I have not had as much success with targeting android.\n I was wondering if anyone has had any success cross compiling their Haskell projects via nix (be it haskell.nix or otherwise) to run on Android. I know there is mobile haskell, and a couple of blog posts out there explaining how to build a cross-compiling GHC manually, but I really like the idea of using nix, as it seems like a more hands-off approach, kind of like Rust's cross It would be especially helpful if anyone had any projects doing this successfully already that I might be able to take a look at.\n Haskell.nix has worked really nicely for me so far otherwise, so ideally I'd use that. Is there perhaps some additional configuration I need to add to my default.nix to get my projects building correctly to target Android? I am still very much a nix noob, so I'm honestly not even sure what sorts of things I can try. Nothing on the haskell.nix documentation seemed particularly relevant to my situation.\n I'm fine with using any relatively recent version of GHC, but I've been trying to accomplish this with the GHC versions listed as supported by haskell.nix.\n    submitted by    /u/sintrastes  \n [link]   [comments]",

This way corresponds to call by value evaluation and is the basis of linearity via kinds.\n Borrowing the syntax from the linear haskell paper, here's an encoding of the !(a -o b) embedding of intuitionistic logic.\n ​\n https://preview.redd.it/2h2k3rd7sim71.png?width=1490&format=png&auto=webp&s=45da1108dc562a8c09827f17bea89bb95ca6a567\n This system uses the same context multiplication that linear haskell uses except it places the multiplication on the lambda rather than the function call. This version of let! let here is limited to only work on functions; but it can be generalized to work with a kind based linearity system or a typeclass based linearity system.\n In linear haskell the multiplicity parameter of an arrow chooses between either !a -o b or a -o b. In this system the multiplicity parameter of an arrow choose between !(a -o b) and a -o b. This choose doesn't have to be mutually exclusive.

          "description": "Hi everyone! I think I have a challenging issue in front of me, but I might be wrong. The application I'm building needs to handle possibly non-terminating computations gracefully and remain responsive while running them. I thought most of the problem would be solved by running it in a separate thread, but it seems a bit more complicated than that. I want to abort a computation when it's memory usage hits a certain limit. I thought the -M RTS option would work fine for this, but when the program reaches it's memory limit, it just keeps going while memory usage remains more or less constant. However, it seems the application becomes effectively single-threaded for a while before a heap overflow exception is thrown, which makes it very slow to respond. I'm not able to reproduce it with a simple foldr (+) 0 [1..5000000] though, so it's something specific about the computation I'm running. I'm thinking the GC is trying very hard for a while to free enough memory for the computation to continue, which causes a time-frame where other threads are blocked a lot and don't have memory available for them.\n Ideally, I'd like to just keep the application from freezing for more than 100ms while the GC does it's work, because sometimes the memory-intensive computation does complete after entering the single-threaded time-frame and I'm getting the feeling that GHC is a bit lazy about garbage collection while it has enough space, but a way to prevent the unresponsiveness time frame by killing the thread early would also be okay.\n But if someone has a better idea of what's going on here that would be nice already. I can publish the full source if needed, but I think it would quite a bit of work to go through/install the application.\n Edit: Using GHC 8.6.5 (because of GHCJS) if that's relevant\n    submitted by    /u/cdfa98  \n [link]   [comments]",

I've only written basic Haskell, I'm trying to learn.\n In C#, it's something like this\n var a = GetSomeData(); var b = GetSomeOtherData(); var c = GetFinalData(); var errors = new (bool isError, string message)[] { (a is null, \"Could not find A\"), (b is null, \"Could not find B\"), (c is null, \"Could not find C\"), }.Where(t => t.isError).Select(t => t.message); var error = string.Join(\", \", errors); if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(error)) { return Response(error); } // Process data... return Response(...); \n In Haskell, I was thinking of modeling a, b, c variables as Eithers with either a value (not necessarily of the same type) or a helpful error String.

I don't think I can use a do block because of the different types (right?) and because I want to keep the error messages.\n How could I model the \"aggregate and return all error messages, or if nothing's wrong keep processing data\" idea.

          "description": "I'm wondering if there's a way to have a scheduled meeting marked as a recurring event in my agenda, and then to have notes for each instance of the meeting under that as a subtree.\n Basically, I have something like this:\n * My Meeting <2021-09-02 +1w> \n And I want a way to turn it into\n * My Meeting <2021-09-09 +1w> ** <2021-09-02> \n i.e. make a sub-tree for the (non-repeating) current instance of the meeting, in which I can take my notes, and bump the original (repeating) meeting's date by a week (or whatever the repeat interval is).\n Abstractly, a repeating event is an infinite sequence of events. I want to split this into the first occurrence, and the rest of the sequence.\n I've seen that you can do C-c C-t to use org-todo to mark a recurring event as done, but that seems to create a list-item, not an entire sub-tree.\n Is this possible? Am I going about this in the wrong way?\n    submitted by    /u/jmite  \n [link]   [comments]",

Is it possible to have multiple directories for org files and org-roam?\n I would like to have my personal org files and notes for org-roam synced with my private Dropbox and all work related org-files and org-roam notes synced with my work iCloud. \n Can this be done and preferably in a way so that if I would exclude the work org file directory, all my personal notes and todos stay the same. \n I know that I can define multiple paths for org-agenda-files but I’m unsure of org-roam files. \n Best regards,\n David\n    submitted by    /u/dsbahr  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello.\n Recently started using org-roam at work for taking and organizing notes. Works so far good. However, since the last couple of days I noticed that org-indent-mode (and also some other org-mode keymappings) gets 'deactivated'. It is fixed by just invoking 'org-mode' again, however it is a bit annoying to quite frequently invoke this again and again.\n I am fairly new to emacs but I am trying to learn what happens and why. I am both interested in why this happens but I also want to know how to properly debug this so I can figure out if this is a feature/bug or just a setting I can tweak.\n What I have found out so far is that it is happening whenever I open a node that is not already loaded into a buffer (e.g. if I re-visit a node it doesn't happen). So seems something is happening when 'org-roam-node-find' and later 'org-roam-node-file' ?\n This is not happening on my personal computer but only on my work computer (so far). Using almost identical emacs setup for both, using doom-emacs.\n Anyone experienced anything similar or have some suggestions on how to fix/debug this further?\n    submitted by    /u/KiteAnton  \n [link]   [comments]",

So i did a little research and started to modify my init.el to use use-package. \n I have got setted various variables about org-agenda , for example:\n (setq org-icalendar-include-body nil) (setq org-icalendar-alarm-time 5) (setq org-agenda-files '(\"~/path/file.org\" )) \n These are lines at the end of my init.el ; If i want to use use-package for everything i would have to set that variables after a : (use-package org-agenda :init ) ?

Can't find it for the life of me, so I'll give all the details I can remember.\n The mode kept 2 buffers in sync, showing the same data in different formats. Edits in either would be instantly converted to the other. For example, inserting an org header \"* xyz\" in one might add a markdown header \"# xyz\" in the other.\n It was (in theory) extensible to use any 2 formats that can round-trip convert to one another I think it only supported one pair of formats currently, as a test. I also think it was from a few years ago, maybe 2017.\n The author worked in (computional?) low-level biology, I think DNA sequencing, or something related like blood research.

          "description": "Hej fellow 'macsers,\n TL:DR: I want to use query-replace in an open dired buffer, which considers the file-names of ALL directories and subdirectories present in said buffer. Is that possible? How?\n I am trying to get my music sorted using the beet music library manager. So far, it works quite well. However, I own some more or less obscure music for which there are no proper musicbrainz entries so that the proper tagging/renaming doesn't work.\n Now, I am tempted to simply ignore one source of error - a suffix such as \"(Original Mix)\" appended to the \"ARTIST - TITLE\" scheme. This way, I am able to get more tagging done and have less manual work to do afterwards.\n However, I want this problem fixed at a later stage, and I thought I might as well just open a dired buffer, and query-replace should have me covered (in combination with wdired). And it does - provided that I have opened one particular (sub-)directory to which query-replace is then applied. But since I don't know in which directory the \"bad\" file namings are to be found, I would have to open any and all subdirectories manually for this method to work. Unacceptable (think of Lemongrab in Adventure Time :D)\n Is there a possibility to make dired / query-replace behave in the way that I expect / want them to? Are there other utilities (in emacs or else) that can do what I want?\n Any tips / advice are very welcome. Have a good day, folks!\n EDIT: It seems like I've just been offered two probably working solutions. One includes invoking M-x find-dired RET RET, while the other consists in changing the subdir switch to include -R (in dired, C-u s, then -R). Will test both in due time, but so far, thanks a bunch, u/protesilaos and u/xenodium!\n EDIT2: I've settled with the solution suggested by u/protesilaos. I appreciate when I can stay within the dired interface, and changing the subdir switch seems more intuitive to me.\n Thanks a bunch, folks!\n    submitted by    /u/olivuser  \n [link]   [comments]",

But I cannot figure out how to make wl insert the appropriate signature. Google gave me a hack using mu-cite, but surely there must be a built-in way to do this.\n Another thing that bugs me: can I somehow tell wl to ignore its own SMTP capabilities and just use the msmtp I have already set up? Right now, C-x m uses msmtp, while w in wl does something completely different. Obviously, I want them to do the same thing.\n    submitted by    /u/BettaGeorge  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi Emacsers! I've been using some variant of this code for several months (I started writing it quite soon after I began using Emacs) and have found it extremely useful. Maybe you will too. From the readme:\n  \nAside is a package written with the aim of making it easy and convenient to use side windows for arbitrary sets of buffers. Specifically, Aside lets you specify a configuration for a window which determines which buffers are displayed in that window, where the window is located, specific customisations that window should have, and defines a ‘do-what-I-mean’ (DWIM) command for navigating to and toggling the visibility of the window, all in less than a dozen lines of code. Much of this flexibility springs directly from Emacs’ built-in ‘display-buffer-alist’ variable, however Aside can make it more convenient to define configurations for ‘display-buffer-alist’ that you can easily separate and use independently from one another, and Emacs does not come with any equivalent to the DWIM commands Aside can generate.\n  \nIt comes with several pre-made configurations, each of which I use extensively myself. Those configurations set up dedicated windows for browsing projects in Dired, making a Vterm terminal always accessible, and ensuring help, search, and compiler warning buffers always show up in the same place. Some of the configurations are a single call to aside-define-configuration, but the Vterm and especially the Dired configuration are a bit more complex. Please try it out if it sounds useful and let me know what you think. If people find this layer of functionality on top of buffer-display-alist valuable, I'm thinking of asking to have it added to ELPA.\n https://git.sr.ht/~mfa/aside/\n    submitted by    /u/Matt-Beshara  \n [link]   [comments]",

Once a feature is identified by customization it will download it, install it and provide key bindings. No Elisp code writing required by users. \n PEL supports commands to activate package quickstart and implements a fast startup mode that extends package quickstart idea (by bundling packages into one mega package to reduce the load-path) but also available in Emacs 26. With it I have achieved 0.1 second startup for over 200 external packages (244 directories in load-path). More info on the Github page. I'll be adding support for new packages. PEL won't be for everyone but hopefully some people will find it useful. \n Feedback welcome.\n Cheers :-)\n    submitted by    /u/prouleau001  \n [link]   [comments]",

Basically, it's about discovering Joplin  and other software, along with different methods to manage information and organize in our daily lives. Among these methods is the Zettelkasten method; or, at least, what I understand of it.\n\nThe point of this post is two-fold: first, I hope that the workshop might make you discover some interesting things that you might use yourself. In particular, I found it interesting to articulate the P.A.R.A method and the Zettelkasten method together, and using open-source software to wrap it all together.\nSecond, I would really enjoy having your opinion on how the Zettelkasten method is presented in the workshop. I believe that you all know much more about it that I do, along with having much more experience with it. Therefore, if you feel like I've missed some things, or if you think that it could be explained in a better way (since the workshop is designed for people that have never heard of it), I'd be delighted to hear it. You can share it here, or indicate it as an issue on the GitHub repository of the workshop.\nI thank you all for all of your fascinating insights about the Zettelkasten method and your use of it; it has always been a pleasure to come here and read about your experience with it.\nHave a nice day !",

          "description": "The Collector's Fallacy, which Christian Tietze has written about, is an example of the Exploration-Exploitation Dilemma, also known as the multi-armed bandit problem.  From Wikipedia:\n\n  \nThe multi-armed bandit problem models an agent that simultaneously attempts to acquire new knowledge (called \"exploration\") and optimize their decisions based on existing knowledge (called \"exploitation\"). The agent attempts to balance these competing tasks in order to maximize their total value over the period of time considered.\n\n\nIn the case of the Collector, the \"agent\" explores indefinitely and adds to their collection but postpones making the decision to do something with it. Wikipedia gives a list of practical applications of the multi-armed bandit problem, but I can't resist pointing out that the problem of deciding which professor's class to take is almost never counted among such lists, perhaps because professors compile them. Someone choosing among Zettelkasten implementations without really settling on one is another.\nGiven that the multi-armed bandit problem has a name, has been extensively studied since at least the middle of the twentieth century and has been solved in important cases, one question is whether some of these solutions could guide the Collector toward more productive uses of their time.",

The only difficulty has been with diagrams etc.  I've found that working mainly physically and scanning the images and cleaning the text digitally has been a nice process without much overhead.\nProofs and particularly the elements of subproofs are natural since linking can double as both relation and implication; likewise examination of backlinks can be useful for examining assumptions / presuppositions.\nIn summary, its working reasonably well, I just need to work physically first, then transfer to digital.\nAny shared experiences re mathematics research in your zettelkasten would be great.\nFor anyone with a combinatorial or number-theoretic bent, here is a newly discovered sequence of numbers generated by the main algorithm of my paper at the encyclopedia of integer sequences. https://oeis.org/A335725",
