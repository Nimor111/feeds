I have (in the package monad-bayes), a type\n newtype Sampler a = Sampler (ReaderT GenIO IO a)\n which is used as a sampling monad. We wanted to generalize it to the following\n newtype Sampler g m a = Sampler (StatefulGen g m => ReaderT g m a)\n This version is parametrized by a choice of RNG and monad, which is great. Unfortunately, it's about 10x slower, at least when used as the sampling monad in a program that takes 1000000 random samples. \n Does the typeclass constraint inside the newtype set off performance alarm bells for anyone?

The size of the mapping file generated was about 30M bytes, and it took almost 130 secs to get it. It's much more slower than I expected, though I can not figure out what's the problem causing it. Here's my code looks like:\n ​\n generateSrcMap :: String -> [FilePath] -> SourceRange -> Value generateSrcMap sFile srcs sourceRanges = generate $ SourceMapping { smFile = sFile, smSources = srcs, smSourceRoot = Nothing, smMappings = mappings } where mappings = mapMaybe getMapping $ zip sourceRanges [0 ..] getMapping :: (SourceRange, Int) -> Maybe Mapping getMapping (SourceRange start _ _, idx) = if srcFile == \"std\" then Nothing -- skip mapping stdlib code else Just $ Mapping { mapGenerated = Pos 1 $ fromInteger $ toInteger idx, -- business logic, use index as column mapOriginal = Just (Pos line column), mapSourceFile = Just srcFile, mapName = Nothing } where !srcFile = sourceName start !line = fromInteger $ toInteger (1 + unPos (sourceLine start)) !column = fromInteger $ toInteger $ unPos $ sourceColumn start \n ​\n Also I tried using this rust library to run decode/encode the same source map json file.

But... why? We don't do this for any other monad, and modern Haskellers are perfectly comfortable writing `AppE <$> x <*> y` rather than `appE x y`. And it's quite expensive - you have a huge module that duplicates every single function in this form, and it leads to downstream confusion as people use the two styles inconsistently.\n I think the reason for this existing may just be historical: this style was introduced in the TH paper in 2002, and applicatives weren't popularised until 2008.

My code snipped can explain this better than i do:\n newtype Dd x y = ToDd Cudd.DdNode deriving (Eq,Show) --x data F1 data F0 --y data S1 data S0 class DdF a b where bot :: Dd a b con :: Dd a b -> Dd a b -> Dd a b -- ..etc \n \"bot\" is a constructor, so i need to fully specify the instances:\n instance {-# OVERLAPS #-} DdF F1 S1 where bot mgr = ToDd (Cudd.zddReadZero mgr) instance {-# OVERLAPS #-} DdF F1 S0 where bot mgr = ToDd (Cudd.zddReadOne mgr) instance {-# OVERLAPS #-} DdF F0 S1 where bot mgr = ToDd (Cudd.zddReadZero mgr) instance {-# OVERLAPS #-} DdF F0 S0 where bot mgr = ToDd (Cudd.zddReadOne mgr) \n \"con\" has shared code between the S1 and S0 instances, so i am looking to defined these functions along the line of:\n instance {-# OVERLAPS #-} DdF F1 a where con mgr (ToDd z1) (ToDd z2) = ToDd (Cudd.zddIntersect mgr z1 z2) instance {-# OVERLAPS #-} DdF F0 a where con mgr (ToDd z1) (ToDd z2) = ToDd (Cudd.zddUnion mgr z1 z2) \n Here i simplified to only 2 parameters, in my actual code i have 3 - and many functions requiring only one or two parameters to be specified. Implementing along the above manner would reduce duplicate code by a lot, and allows me to still make use of the type inference system.\n Yet when i run the code (\"let y = con (bot :: Dd F1 S1) (bot :: Dd F1 S1)\", with no compiler issues), examining y gives the following error : \"[...] Exception: [...] : No instance nor default method for class operation con\". \n Am i misunderstanding the Overlapping and Multiparameter type-classes wrongly?

I'm still trying to wrap my brain around the whole sum type/disjoint set thing (See this previous discussion). I've seen unit () leveraged in Either a b, again, presumably because something of cardinality 1 and \"non-reactive\" is needed for a data constructor of constant value. In that post, it was for Nil. So, yes, what's the meaning of a proof like this through isomorphisms? What are we gaining with this?

The difference is that the usage of values of the \"cloned type\" would actually be made mandatory by the compiler (EDIT: by the type checker). The type signature shouldn't accept an Int in the place of Code, for instance:\n f :: Code -> String\n Another way to put the question is: \n How can I add my own type to the special group of types that have integer literals as their values?\n The source code for Int is cryptic:\n data {-# CTYPE \"HsInt\" #-} Int = I# Int#\n I'm using Int here just as an example, but it could be [Char].\n ==== EDIT ====\n Disambiguation using (42 :: Code) won't be necessary when applying f.\n Although relevant in some contexts, I'm not concerned about runtime representation. The question is just about how to use literals (e.g. string or Int) directly as values of my type, i. e. without having to prepend each literal with a constructor. Exactly how we use type aliases over existing types, except by the fact that they shouldn't be interchangeable. Only when using literals they will appear the same: Instead of writing f $ Code 123, one would write f 123. Instead of writing g $ Name \"John\", one would write g \"John\".

          "description": "I spent some time this weekend writing up an alpha version of some ideas I had about command line option parsing as a haskell package: cyclops.\n To start, if you're looking for a robust and full-featured option parser, cyclops isn't that yet. Let me recommend optparse-applicative and optparse-generic, which are both great.\n The Big Idea of cyclops is to support a declarative option-parsing style (just say what arguments you expect, rather than how to parse it) while keeping the option description as close as possible to the variable bind location.\n To that end, it uses ViewPatterns and TypeApplications with DataKinds to pass option specifications backwards from the bind location using type inference.\n main = do ( switch @'[\"d\", \"debug\"] @\"Show debugging statements\" -> debug ,flagged @'[\"dictionary\"] @\"PATH\" @\"File to draw words from\" .defaultTo @\"--dictionary /usr/share/dict/words\" -> dictionaryPath ,option @'[\"s\", \"seed\"] @\"NUM\" @\"Seed value for PRNG\" .readable -> seed ,arg @\"count\" @\"Number of passwords to generate\" .readable -> count ,arg @\"template\" @\"Template for generated passwords\" .oneOrMore .defaultTo @\"w w w w\" -> template ) <- getOps Conf { description = \"Generate pseudorandom passwords using a template.\" , version = \"1.0.0.20220702\" } \n Type inference places some constraints not visible in the above example code - if seed is inferred to be an Int by how it's used in the rest of the code, then that's how it getOps will attempt to parse --option 123.\n This release isn't really ready for primetime yet, but if you like the basic concept, let me know, and I'll keep working it.\n    submitted by    /u/rampion  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hey everyone, after intensive testing i just released my first library on hackage!\n Interval Tree Clocks - They serve as an alternative to vector clocks, which are a concept to track logical time. In distributed contexts, comparison by timestamps might be skewed. \n Vector clocks and version vectors however have the weakness of \"actor explosion\" because you cannot remove traces of an actor that might be long gone. They only allow you to increment the version vector in length.\n Interval tree clocks solve this by managing a tree-representation of said vector clock. With interval tree clocks you can dynamically add (fork) or remove (join) actors / replicas from your system and have your versions grow and shrink accordingly, while still holding the monotonically increasing semantics.\n They can similarly be used as either version vectors or vector clocks.\n I have thoroughly tested the code. Nonetheless if you are an expert on the topic, I'd love to get your criticism. Nevertheless, because it's my first library, I appreciate all and any feedback I can get.\n Hope this helps you build distributed systems some day!\n ​\n Hackage link: https://hackage.haskell.org/package/interval-tree-clock-0.1.0.0\n ​\n This library provides the bare operations as described in the original paper: Almeida, Paulo & Baquero, Carlos & Fonte, Victor.

A simplified example:\n data Normalized data Denormalized class Normalize x where type Normalization x normalize :: x -> Normalization x -- 'Foo' uses phantom type n to track whether normalization has been applied. data Foo n = Foo String -- Normalizing a 'Foo' that has already been 'Normalized' is a no-op. instance Normalize (Foo Normalized) where type Normalization (Foo Normalized) = Foo Normalized normalize = id -- Normalizing a 'Foo' that has not already been normalized transforms the String. instance Normalize (Foo Denormalized) where type Normalization (Foo Denormalized) = Foo Normalized normalize (Foo s) = Foo (map toUpper s) -- A smart constructor produces a 'Foo' with no normalization applied mkFoo :: String -> Foo Denormalized mkFoo = Foo \n By exporting mkFoo but not the Foo data constructor, I can prevent users of this library from manually constructing a value of type Foo Normalized. Instead, they're forced to do something like:\n normalize (mkFoo \"x\") \n However, it seems they could still circumvent normalization via coerce:\n coerce (mkFoo \"x\") :: Foo Normalized \n The documentation for Coercible seems to suggest this should not be the case, given that the Foo data constructor is not in scope, but playing around with it in ghci I'm finding I can perform this undesirable coercion.\n For now, I've added a type role annotation to prevent such coercion,\n type role Foo nominal \n but I'm curious to know why coerce is working otherwise, despite the fact that the Foo data constructor is not in scope.

          "description": "Has anyone built this? How tough would it be? Does anyone have ideas on where to start?\n To expand, I've noticed a recurring problem in big projects: someone makes a small, trivial change and then has to wait 30-45 minutes for all tests to run. This wastes time and compute. Over time, developers adjust the size of PRs to account for this. Instead of making small isolated changes, they batch a bunch of changes into a single PR so the tests all run together. At some point they break the repo up. Now they have to think about dependency chains, and they've copied a bunch of build boilerplate into many repos.\n I think a powerful solution would be to only re-run tests for code that changed. We can periodically re-run all tests on main/master, maybe once daily. We can add some configuration/annotation to specify that a particular test or test suite should always run.\n How would it work? At the very least, it would have to integrate with SCM to compare what's on main/master vs. on the current commit. But it seems naive to just compare which source files show up in the diff. Seems like it might have to do something at the bytecode level? Maybe some sort of instrumentation similar to what code coverage tools are doing. I haven't done much at that level.\n In any case, thanks for reading. I'm pretty keen to try to build something along these lines. Excited to read any ideas/links/tips you all might have.\n ​\n Update:\n  \nThanks for the fun discussion! It sounds like some combination of testQuick and SBT's remote cache are worth a try. If I'll try to experiment with this and either post back here or write up a blog post.\n  \n   submitted by    /u/elastiknn  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello everyone. I have a question about proper usage of Ref:\n Where other languages mutate objects, FP-languages prefer creating alternative instances to preserve referential transparency. Let's say I have a nested structure, i.e. House has Floors, Floor has Apartment, Apartment has Room, Room has LightBulb. If I change a light bulb, I obviously don't want to recreate the whole House.\n The way documentation describes Ref, its' primary goal is to help with concurrency:\n  \nAn asynchronous, concurrent mutable reference. Provides safe concurrent access and modification of its content\n  \nBut from my experience, it's really handy to use it just as a reference, even if there are no troubles with concurrency. In the example with House I can store references to Apartments to avoid recreating Floors and the whole House each time i have a change in an Apartment. I can just call apartmentRef.update(...) and the Floor and the House stay exactly the same.\n The question is: is it OK to do so? If so, is it bad to use it every time, let's say at each level mentioned in the House example?\n    submitted by    /u/anonimuzzza  \n [link]   [comments]",

For example, if someone has no experience in programming and wants to start learning by writing working code quickly, I'd recommend Python for its readability and (apparent) simplicity.\n I've recently started learning Scala out of an interest in functional programming and how it is accomplished in languages running on the JVM. There are some aspects I really like, like the use of Option instead of Null, the fact that the syntax is familiar but 'cleaned-up' and less verbose compared to Java, performance …",

Each function returns a sequence of case classes representing the data source that has been fetched from the database. \n The “half baked idea” is: What if “whenever something interesting happens” I could deserialize this DataAccess class and replay the test data through the latest version of the app for debugging and testing purposes. \n Does anyone have any kind of experience with such a pattern? What tools did you consider to help with the “snapshotting” (serialization and deserialization)? Where did you persist your snapshots?\n Some considerations: 1. There are about a hundred different case classes available through various functions in the DataAccess class 2. The “amount” of data is large. So while I view storage cost as essentially free, serialization / deserialization performance (primarily deserialization) is a concern\n A few options I could think of are: 1. A database, either a “real database” or perhaps some kind of in-memory database 2.

Of course, some customizations are available but the main objective of the plugin is to apply conventional commits with as little effort as possible.\n Suggestions and PR are welcome :)\n Repo link: https://github.com/nicolasfara/sbt-conventional-commits\n    submitted by    /u/nicolasfarabegoli  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I've been using org-wild-notifier (within Spacemacs) for a while and I realized it was actually draining my laptop batter quite a bit. The core reason is that once a minute it spawns a separate emacs instance that has to initialize a bunch of things and actually (re)open all org agenda files I already had opened and regenerate org-agenda.\n Which led me to dig around and look at https://github.com/jwiegley/emacs-async (which wild-notifier uses) and then read a bit about https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/NoThreading.\n I also went through https://orgmode.org/worg/agenda-optimization.html a bit (I only have a few agenda files and they are not huge, though I am toying with the idea of testing cleanup to see how much it would help)\n Ultimately though, it feel like the emacs-async use in this case will always cause slowdowns. Doing some profiling - even the call to package-initialize in org-wild-notifier--retrieve-events takes a sizeable chunk of CPU.\n These seem like wasted cycles, my emacs instance already has the org files open and all the packages needed loaded.\n So, finally my question is - am I the only one that is bothered by this? Do people not want/need notifications generally? Or not get hit by the battery drain for some reason? How do others deal with getting notifications before events/tasks are scheduled/planned?\n I looked a bit at https://github.com/legalnonsense/org-timed-alerts and I like the approach using org-ql potentially nice(r). Especially with caching and all of that... But the package doesn't seem maintained anymore so I think it's a dead end?\n Alternatively would changing wild-notifier to use emacs threads potentially solve/improve this? (at the cost of newer emacs version requirement).\n Any other suggestions (other than trying to cleanup my org agenda files)?\n Edit: Fix double spaced-paragraphs\n    submitted by    /u/podtatranec  \n [link]   [comments]",

However, there is very little documentation on how to setup it in a way that it is comparable with Pycharm in usability, so I am wondering if you could point me in a direction on how to do that. Besides, there are some other problems that I am facing: - How do you setup and use python environments on emacs? I tried poetry, but it doesn't have anyway to inherit global site packages. There are many packages that I installed globally as I will always use them, so I don't want to keep reinstalling them in every environment. - I see nowhere a place to run and debug my python scripts and see the results. Also, after everything is setup will it be able to show graphs and images? - Treemacs always open in the .doom.d directory how can I make it open in my home directory?\n Thanks in advance.\n    submitted by    /u/arivar  \n [link]   [comments]",

And perhaps some are a dealbreaker preventing me to migrate from Emacs/Spacemacs to Aquamacs?\n For people who have used Aquamacs, what has been your experience? What are are pros and cons against a regular Emacs? Were there any dealbreakers?\n Also, how is it running Aquamacs and regular Emacs (with Spacemacs) on the same computer/user account? Will they play along nicely and don't mess things up, or they will be rewriting each others' configs all the time?\n UPDATE:\n I am using Evil mode, and also a leader SPC key so I basically don't use traditional Command bound Emacs keybindings.\n This seems to be a frequent \"con\" by people coming from vanilla Emacs when I try to find some cons of Aquamacs via Google - but in my case, that is not an issue.\n I am more worried about the compatibility of packages and code of Emacs Lisp scripts I will find on the Internet and whether it will run or not.\n Also, are there any weird hidden you-might-notice-them-only-after-a-few-months quirks that Aquamacs has when compared with vanilla Emacs?\n    submitted by    /u/East_Staff3288  \n [link]   [comments]",

Following a suggestion from Magit's author (here https://emacs.stackexchange.com/a/22565/29817), Magit seems to have a command that should work pretty well for me: `magit-rebase-edit-commit`, bound by default to `r m`.

Still working on a better workflow than what I have currently \n I was wondering if someone has tried to integrate Emacs with their stream deck ? \n Here is what I imagine it would be useful for : \n - starting and stopping project timer with org-clock\n - global macros for pulling up a new notes or todo entry, or just general emacs macros\n - macro pad for more exotic commands that one might want to run every so often, or for switching buffers (with preview of the buffer name on the stream deck ?)\n ​\n All of these to me seem like feasible and useful. As I am relatively new to programming and elisp, I have a vague idea of how to implement this myself, but if someone has already gone through the trouble I would be happy to hear how they went about it !\n I use Doom emacs - macros and key bindings are pretty clear and easy to implement but more ways of interacting with emacs would be a plus for me ! \n I imagine for the global commands something like the emacs api would need to be used, I've got to look into it more.\n    submitted by    /u/FailedHumanPrototype  \n [link]   [comments]",

I used to use Emacs such that I could see the clock on my OS, but now I want to try using Emacs entirely full-screen; problem is, I don't have a clock any more. I used to have it on the mode-line, but I didn't like how the time was replicated everywhere, and it was taking up space that I wanted for other things.\n Is there a way to put a clock, say, in the right side of the tab-bar? This is a little line of space that is almost never in use, so it'd be perfect.\n Update: Here's a hack that I don't recommend, but it was kinda fun to figure out: it uses a posframe and a timer to get it to display: https://paste.sr.ht/~ashton314/4d490af6b4c6ae2f00012c8d807383001b242f1e\n There are some better suggestions in the comments, which I'll probably be using. :)\n 2nd Update: Thanks to u/karthink, I've found a solution that works perfectly:\n lisp (add-to-list 'tab-bar-format 'tab-bar-format-align-right 'append) (add-to-list 'tab-bar-format 'tab-bar-format-global 'append) (setq display-time-format \"%a %e %b %T\") (setq display-time-interval 1) (display-time-mode) \n    submitted by    /u/varsderk  \n [link]   [comments]",

I've been far from memorizing the tags and attributes in HTML - with programming languages, I don't memorize the parameter list :/. So, I usually have an idea of what I want to do in HTML, but need to resort to googling/duckduckgo-ing quite frequently.\n However, I felt, it would be pretty great if there were some mode / emacs-extension / some-eww-friendly-website that could provide the tags, and the attributes that each tag takes, may be along with small examples as well as \"see also\". I've tried company-web and lsp-mode, and both provide descriptions of tags (which I mostly don't need!) but don't provide the attributes. With other languages, it is a great help to see the parameter list in the echo area, or even the function/macro/keyword documentation with a simple command.\n So, if anyone knows about this, it'd be great!\n Thanks you!\n EDIT: Moments after I posted this, yasnippet struck me; and it is helpful, but the tag-attribute reference manual would still be appreciated!\n    submitted by    /u/digikar  \n [link]   [comments]",

Both can be obviously accesed using ssh. The setup works with my shell (fish) as well as other shells and with vscode.\n ​\n What is really strange, is that that tramp always asks me for ssh:Machine_B passsword: while only the JumpMachine has a password. The PW auth is turned off for ssh on Machine_B. I tried using the password for JumpMachine and Machine_B and neither works. TBH I am not really sure what to do by now.\n I just wanted to mention that there is also another entry for my admin account.

There were some errors in loading the Emacs config file, however the splash/startup screen hid those errors, so I never knew there were any problems. When the config file couldn't finish loading, it didn't get to my (setq inhibit-startup-screen t) instruction, hence it used the default startup.el setting.

          "description": "Basically the title. Took me a while to narrow down exactly what was happening.\n I'm on emacs 27 and this is happening using the rustic package with flycheck and eglot.\n If I disable eldoc before it ever holds docs, I'm not prompted to save.\n But If I look at something in eldoc, and even after I quit eldoc-mode, emacs wants to save only the examples section of eldoc.\n This is a bizarre error and I'm wondering if there's just a setting I have turned on? My next step is to dig into the eldoc code.\n EDIT:\n I've been annoyed by this for months, and I finally tracked it down to the \" markdown-fontification-buffer:rust\" buffer that gets created by eglot or lsp-mode. This led me to this fix for anyone else experiencing this:\n https://github.com/brotzeit/rustic/issues/253\n    submitted by    /u/granitrocky  \n [link]   [comments]",

I feel like I'm still not 100% getting it.\n In elisp there are two distinct namespaces: one for functions and one for variables. This means I can have a variable called foobar and also a function called foobar, and they won't interfere with one another.\n If I want to evaluate a variable, then I just write the variable - eg foobar. If I want to evaluate a function, then I include it within parentheses (with arguments as needed) - eg (foobar arg1 arg2).\n If I want to refer to the symbol of a variable, then I prepend it with a quote - eg 'foobar. If I want to refer to the symbol of function, then I prepend it with a hash and quote - eg #'foobar.\n Lambdas are something of a mish-mash: they allow me to set the value of a variable to be a function, that will itself be called each time that variable is evaluated.\n Is that about it? Would love any feedback around where my understanding may have gone awry.\n    submitted by    /u/Shimmy-choo  \n [link]   [comments]",

It meant that I didn't have to think about which file I want to skip forward or back to - I would just look at the buffer line and then prev or next or wildcard to the buffer I want to skip to.\n In Emacs you do end up with a lot more open buffers so something similar wouldn't quite work but I wonder whether there are other solutions that might solve my issue. \n I would be perfectly happy to mark the buffers that I am currently working on for example and have them displayed somewhere for ease. Or have them pop up at the top of my buffer or ibuffer list so they are easy to see and select.\n Any suggestions?\n    submitted by    /u/Two_Souls  \n [link]   [comments]",

Has anyone managed to run 'make check-all' without any resulting failures, and if so, how? Are the failed tests in levels above 'make check' telling me anything significant?\n --Editing to fix formatting and (hopefully) simplify my question--\n Here's the result of running make check-all after compiling with the --with-xwidgets option:\n SUMMARY OF TEST RESULTS ----------------------- Files examined: 375 Ran 5568 tests, 1 failed to run, 5456 results as expected, 13 unexpected, 99 skipped 1 files did not finish: misc/test-custom-noloads.log 7 files contained unexpected results: src/thread-tests.log lisp/progmodes/python-tests.log lisp/mail/rmailmm-tests.log lisp/emacs-lisp/cconv-tests.log lisp/cedet/srecode/fields-tests.log lisp/cedet/srecode/document-tests.log lisp/autorevert-tests.log make[2]: *** [Makefile:336: check-doit] Error 2 make[2]: Leaving directory '/home/src/emacs/emacs-28.1-tarball/emacs-28.1/test' make[1]: *** [Makefile:315: check-all] Error 2 make[1]: Leaving directory '/home/src/emacs/emacs-28.1-tarball/emacs-28.1/test' make: *** [Makefile:994: check-all] Error 2 \n All the tests that fail are performed only when I run make check-all.

I thought it was from sleeping on my elbow - not an uncommon cause of ulnar nerve entrapment, and my doctor had me change sleeping positions. \n I'm developing apps full time in dart and spend about 8-12 hours a day programming, 6-7 days a week. And I save, copy, paste, undo, redo, among other shortcuts all day, probably having my pinky hit the left ctrl key 1000 times a day. My typing speed was normally over 160, max 183, on 10fastfingers. \n Look, I've rebinded left control entirely to left alt. But for some reason, it really hit me today. Suddenly, I was in so much pain that I couldn't bear to hit left ctrl. \n I'm asking here because I'm hoping someone else has gone through recovery. I can't see a specialist for a couple of months. I'll discontinue using my small finger for shortcuts entirely, but that doesn't help me. I have a job to do now.\n    submitted by    /u/AMPHETAMINE-25  \n [link]   [comments]",

But ESS, at least by default, uses X, which is not nice:\n - plotting happens in the XQuartz application, which means that I need to switch out of Emacs and requires a whole bunch of keypresses and thought that I don't want to deal with; at most a window (or multiple as appropriate) should open which I close it with cmd-w and return to emacs, without having to switch applications.\n - plots aren't interactive. In python, for example, you can adjust the plot and save it from the figure window (although the plot window also switches apps and for that reason is not ideal).\n Is this the standard R plotting workflow on macOS (or for that matter Linux)? How do people handle making a lot of plots, on the fly, using ESS? Any other related workflow tips are also helpful. Thanks.\n    submitted by    /u/progthw  \n [link]   [comments]",

I was also using different versions of Emacs: 27, 28 and recent master with pgtk enabled then disabled.\n I was also experimenting with different Linux + GNU operating systems, but whatever I try I’m unable to get rid of Emacs flickering, cursor jumps and buffer/windows switching when using Dell’s built-in keyboard (using external keyboard solves the issue). It sometimes looks like Emacs would undo and redo buffer switch/window switch multiple times or randomly remove/insert the text I just wrote. :O\n I can also reproduce this behavior in plain Emacs (emacs -Q). I’m not having this issue with applications other than Emacs, so it’s rather isolated case. \n Have you ever experienced anything like that? Your help is most welcome.

First, I'm trying to setup my home emacs configuration based (loosely) on my work configuration, but doing it entirely through use-package instead of the Emacs package management. As a result, I'm not entirely sure dependencies are being installed though I understand they ought to be. In any event I've got a behavior on my work machine that I have not yet been able to get on my home machine, namely when I start typing a path in a string, I get completion on it based on the filesystem. Here's a picture, hopefully. \n In any event, I have company and company-statistics installed in both locations but I don't think that's what's doing the file completion suggestions. Any ideas what is causing that? \n Second question, there is a package that has a built-in version installed, however the gnu repository has a more recent version. If I use use-package to install, it says the package is already installed. Is there a way to force it to update if there's a newer version, or something along those lines? I am new to use-package and really haven't gotten the full swing of it yet. I also have a newer version that I just had to download from a site and in the past have just used adding a directory onto load-path and then (require '<package name>) which works, but would be interesting to sort out whether that behavior can be done with use-package as well as a shortcut.\n Anyhow, any help greatly appreciated!\n    submitted by    /u/remillard  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi,\n New to Emacs and not a programmer. I can't invest in learning emacs in entirety at this time but I've begun using org-mode and really liking it. I will invest more as I find time. Currently, only one thing bugs me: Emacs looks terrible. \n All the customization posts and resources are in-depth. I only want a better look. I don't want anything else, no keybindings nothing. Just regular emacs/org-mode that looks nicer (e.g., a dark theme, some prettier font maybe, etc.). \n So, I want to borrow someone else's minimal (just better looks) customization. I don't know how to implement it but I hope it's just a matter of replacing a vanilla file with the borrowed one or pasting some code in one of the vanilla files. \n Believe me I'm trying to learn it all but in my current workload there's like several years before I can get to the point of customizing it myself.

So far, I'm really happy with it, however, I couldn't find any information of filtering/ignoring some directories/files in search results.\n I have some projects containing folders (e.g. \"vendor\") with so many files that search results become unusable but I might not want to ignore those folder at the VCS level, so I would like to ignore those folders/files in Vertico via Emacs config (And not using .projectile or .gitignore files.\n Looking at the source of Doom Emacs, vertico-file-search, I don't see any option to do so.

I'm mostly a javascript developer, but currently learning C as well.\n I'd really like to have things like go-to-definition/go-to-references (probably using an LSP), searching project for regexes or just words, git management, syntax highlighting, debugging, etc.\n Are there good guides for getting there that actually explain what's going on each step of the way? I hate when it's a bunch of copy pasting. I want to understand what they are doing so I can change the parts I don't like.\n I'm also curious about using things like use-package or just using the default stuff of emacs. I see a lot of stuff about melpa vs elpa, and then I see use-package docs saying it's not a package manager. What are they talking about? What is the package manager then?

          "description": "Years ago my personal note taking was no longer based on trial and error but on a solid concept called Bullet Journaling. It started on paper with a lovely Moleskin book and a black fine liner from Neuland. Going digital with my Bullet Journal I decided to use a brilliant tool for note taking named OneNote. But time went by. In March 2022 I got my first contact with Obsidian and at the same time with the Zettelkasten method from Niklas Luhmann explained in the brilliant book from Sönke Ahrens about “How to take Smart Notes”.\nMigration from OneNote to Obsidian was a migration from structured notes to networked notes. But how to migrate a Bullet Journal to a Zettelkasten? Difficult to switch from one concept to another? No, it’s very easy. The Bullet Journal is now a set of Structure Notes in my Zettelkasten. Also Zettelkasten is a Custom Collection in my Bullet Journal.\nIn other words:\nmy Zettelkasten is a Bullet Journal and\nmy Bullet Journal is a Zettelkasten.\nThe best of all: I did not need to change the basic concepts from Ryder Carroll (Bullet Journal), neither the concepts from Niklas Luhmann (Zettelkasten). Both concepts support each other in a perfect manner.\nWhat about your experiences with theses methods? Do you use the Dataview plugin to support your Bullet Journal collections?\n—\n\n\nAhrens, Sönke.

          "description": "Hello.\nMy name is Mike Kramer. Two years ago, I made a very low-effort comment on this forum, but I never introduced myself.\nI first heard of the Zettelkasten Method by reading Ahrens's book. Through it, I discovered Christian and Sascha. From studying them, I realized that, just as the hardest part of GTD is processing--deciding which outcomes are worth committing to and which actions will cause those desired outcomes--the hardest part of a high-value Zettelkasten Method is specifying the nature of the connection that links one Zettel to another. GTD deals only with causal connections between items. The Zettelkasten Method can handle both causal and logical connections.\nAt the most fundamental level, my approach is based on the zettelkasten.de critique that says that a Folgezettel is a variant of the Collector's Fallacy. When I observe the work of other people, they usually cannot specify how a new note relates to its predecessor in the Folgezettel. They have the feeling that they have accomplished something meaningful, but, if they cannot write down the nature of the relation that obtains between connected notes, their thinking is inadequate.\nTo improve my own thinking, I track the status of the connections between my notes. Lumping a bunch of notes together is a low-effort, low-value kind of link compared to a link that shows how some notes provide reasons that support (or undermine) another note.\nIn March of this year, I produced a YouTube video of how I implement my method in Roam. Of course, this method could be implemented with other tools.\nhttps://youtu.be/iOsOI09-3A8\nI welcome your feedback.

          "description": "Hi, \nCopy and paste information, convert from markdown syntax to Office like structure. This is my main concern that I want to address in this post.\nRequirement to produce plain text from small snippets of thoughts and bullet points. I know that this is probably the actual issue, where everyone has their own personal limits...\nI personally am using vimwiki. I often have already structured text inside my wiki, so I am not following a dedicated ZK method, where I would provide very small pieces of information, as I have read it in your introduction. \nI am currently working in an environment where the documents for external partners need to be written and shared in MS Office and the internal documents with LibreOffice. I personally often share textfiles internally, but there are some that don't like this, and latest when we have a kind of official internal meeting, I \"quickly\" convert my initial text into Office document.\nHow do you effectively export things from your knowledge base into documents that you want to publish eventually having the following points in mind:\nEfficient working: Information that is gained during writing the document to be published might also be needed to be transferred into you your knowledge base - duplicated information\nMarkdown syntax is not powerful enough to e.g. handle tables, so there is cumbersom reformating when moving data. Vimwiki syntax is not supported externally. AsciiDoc is a kind of strange to me. Multimarkdown was not fully supported by all my tools.\nLaying out a document in MS Word or LibreOffice is for me a very time consuming process, when I copy plain text into it.\nI tried several conversion methods like for example\n\n\nexported html from vimwiki into word\nseveral tries with pandoc (e.g. to LibreOffice)\n\n\n\nThank you",

I ran into the zettelkasten system while deep diving for ways to deepen my research, organize my usually jumbled thoughts, and connect my ideas. The zettel process is helpful because most of my work turns into written productsI often readng academic journals and think pieces on military concepts and other international policies.\nI just restarted my zettel journey after reading Ahrens' \"Smart Notes\" and powering through a few Youtube videos. My current focus is figuring out a \"good\" way to process literature notes. My initial way of creating literature notes would be a two-step process: taking general notes while reading and then finalizing a summary for the \"final literature note\" to connect with my fleeting notes to create permanent notes.\nI'm still a zettel newbie, so how do you process your literature notes? Any recommended readings about the topic? I look forward to engaging with everyone and learning more about the zettelkasten system!",

Sometimes I am in a mood that I am just not convenient to sit at my PC to write notes. So sitting into the couch, having a tea and just write some thoughts is the only way, I can motivate my self to writing.\nI want to have my notes searchable. So the only thing I see, is to retype things at a later point of time.\nBenefits: repetition and filtering\nAny ideas/suggestions about this?\nRegards, sbts",
