I am trying to calculate the number of elements of the resulting type. \n Although I understand the concept of DPTs I don't actually understand how they work in practise i.e. this example. My guess is that the cardinality of the resulting type is 6, (1,1) (2,1) (2,2) (3,1) (3,2) and (3,3).

          "description": "Was going to quickly write some complex computations and took a look at the source code for Data.Complex just to see what tools I get out of the box. Many of the formulas are what you would expect like:\n sin (x:+y) = sin x * cosh y :+ cos x * sinh y \n But the instances make no sense at all:\n instance Monad Complex where a :+ b >>= f = realPart (f a) :+ imagPart (f b) instance Applicative Complex where pure a = a :+ a f :+ g <*> a :+ b = f a :+ g b \n I'm not seeing how the bind definition works at all. f is going to return a real and complex number when applied to both a and b so you are going to have to scramble. Moreover unless f is linear there is no reason to believe that f(a +ib) = f(a) + i*f(b). It would seem to me a much more reasonable assumption would be to use numerical methods and compute a Taylor expansion for real a and then extend to b. That's still highly questionable but at least don't fail for functions as simple as f x = x^2. Similarly the definition for pure makes no sense at all.\n Haskell normally doesn't get obvious math wrong so I'm assuming the fault lies with me.

Which elements end up in which priority queue would be largely arbitrary. Would such an operation be useful for anything in practice?

          "description": "I'm looking for a printed book to read after finishing with Manning Publication's Get Programming with Haskell.\n Some things to consider are that, though I can't say for sure why, I don't like this book. I think the issue is that it's light. Not just verbose, but lacking in substance. Since it isn't entirely vapid and having paid money for it, I will finish the book. It's just anemic. And the capstone projects are fun.\n Two books which worked well for me are Manning's The Joy of Clojure 2nd Ed. and PragProg's Programming Clojure 3rd Ed. This is of particular significance since at least 90% of the first seven chapters of The Joy of Clojure are redundant with Programming Clojure, which I read first. I feel like I'm getting less from reading Get Programming with Haskell than I did reading content I had already covered in another book. The content just isn't there.\n (Also, it's worth noting that the code examples are kind of crappy. I'm finding myself refactoring this \"expert's\" code because it's ugly and horribly redundant. One thing I like about Haskell is that it's beautiful, with minimal boilerplate, and code I write in Haskell looks great to me. I don't like looking at unsightly code, and his code is mostly that. But for the sake of learning, I can look beyond that.)\n So, with this in mind, what might /r/Haskell recommend as a second Haskell book?\n Edit: I should probably mention (admit?) that I am not a programmer, and if you exclude my Numerical Analysis textbook from grad school, those two Clojure books are the only programming books I've read. I have been programming at some level for decades, but I don't have a typical CompSci background.

          "description": "Recently I've asked myself how much of linear logic can be done in linear Haskell. I'm pretty sure that pure Linear Haskell isn't enough. Let's define:\n type Not a = a %1 -> () \n This is the type of \"obligations for an a\" or \"slots for an a\". I don't think that there's a way to implement Not (Not a) %1 -> a, which is a requirement for linear logic. But looking through the linear-base library I found the following function:\n alloc :: Int -> (DArray a %1 -> ()) %1 -> Vector a \n In other words: \"Give me a way to fill an array with n elements and I'll give you an array with n elements\". This means that alloc 1 is already what we want!!! linear-base (maybe accidentally?) implies all of linear logic. Of course it's a bit cheaty, alloc uses unsafeDupablePerformIO internally, but if the linear-base authors have decided that it's fine I'm okay with it.\n I wrote up some basics of linear logic in Haskell (over here). Using double negation you can implement both of the missing monoidal operations (& and ⅋/Par, the other two already exist: ⊗=(,) ⊕=Either) and interpreting Ur as ! also gives you ?. I've also done some laws including (iso-)mix and both exponential isomorphisms.\n I think it's a bit surprising that it's actually doable. I would have expected that it's either already done or deliberately impossible. But I haven't found anyone talking about doing it, the closest is this library by Edward Kmett which uses some magic to embed linear logic inside of linear Haskell. Unlike this approach I don't think it gives you linear logic for all of LinHask, but only for some types.\n    submitted by    /u/ant-arctica  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi all,\n I was wondering a while ago how Haskell \"decides\" if a given recursive type definition should be given by the least or greatest fixed point. In particular, for a given type equation there are two canonical solutions given by the least and greatest fixed point respectively. But certain types \"feel\" more like one than the other. For example, lists or Peano numerals \"feel\" like least fixed points, whereas streams \"feel\" like greatest fixed points (and in fact the LFP solution is just the empty type, ignoring bottom). So then how does Haskell decide which form to take if the user never specifies?\n So this got me thinking: are Haskell recursive datatypes always given by greatest fixed points? This does seem to make sense mathematically, as for example gfp X. (1 + X) would give the naturals plus a point at infinity, and this translates in Haskell to\n data Nat = Z | S Nat zero = Z one = S Z two = S (S Z) ... inf = S inf \n (i.e. we can implement a term representing an infinite stack of successors)\n So is this actually the case? Does Haskell justify recursive datatypes by greatest fixed points? Or maybe does it not really care about any mathematical justification (i.e. you just get what you get by making a tagged union and putting pointers to the right types)?\n    submitted by    /u/AccomplishedAd3790  \n [link]   [comments]",

Each of those functions can fail, eg if necessary argument is missing, file with wrong extension has been provided, the file doesn't follow the expected format. Based on what I know about haskell, using Maybe type as the return value of the functions seems reasonable to me, Nothing if it fails, Just result if it succeeds. What I'm having trouble with is how to actually utilize this in main. I do something like this\n let proc_args_result = proc_args args if proc_args_result == Nothing then die \"Invalid arguments\" else return() ... -- continue working with processed arguments \n the problem is that if I want to continue working with the processed arguments, I still have the Maybe value instead of the actual value of the result. Alternative is using\n case proc_args args of { Nothing -> die ... Just value -> ... -- continue here } \n but that will lead to uncontrollable indentation\n    submitted by    /u/grandoz039  \n [link]   [comments]",

Or is Haskell not (/no longer) a serious option for 3D graphics? In particular, is the OpenGL library a viable option today, or is it no longer worth looking into?\n Here's some of what I have found so far:\n  \nThe wiki page about Graphics. Unless I am mistaken, the last 3D-related edits on that page are more than 10 years old.\n The OpenGL page on the wiki. Here again the information seems to be a little dated.\n  \nThe exception (to the things I've found being old) is h-raylib, Haskell bindings to the Raylib library.

          "description": "Hi Haskellers! \n I probably have the wrong idea about Arrows, but at an oversimplified level I had always thought that they were interesting because they \"represent functions as data\" in some sense, which is interesting in that it would allow for composition and reasoning of that data separated from execution (e.g. a composition of Arrows could be inspected and validated or modified before execution). Anyways - under the above assumption I dived in with a real use-case but hit a few hurdles that probably mean I have a total misunderstanding and would appreciate any guidance!\n Heres a small, and yes very dumb example, but hopefully gets at my core misunderstanding - where I am not sure that I can recover the composition of these Arrows. Say we have these Arrows:\n ``` -- Adds 1 to the input plus1 :: Arrow a => a Int Int plus1 = arr $ (+ 1)\n -- Adds 2 to the input plus2 :: Arrow a => a Int Int plus2 = arr $ (+ 2)\n -- A program defined through a composition of arrows program :: Arrow a => a Int Int program = plus1 >>> plus1 >>> plus1 ```\n I'd like to be able to inspect the program, and reason able its structure. For example I may want to find paired compositions of plus1 and replace them with plus2 instead as a sort of optimization, e.g. plus2 >>> plus1.\n Using this very simple example to get a better understanding - is this possible?\n    submitted by    /u/tomwells80  \n [link]   [comments]",

Should they be tested regardless (e.g., because there is no guarantee from the outside that we used deriving to create them, so their implementation may be incorrect)?\n What about if A is defined using GADTs, some other extensions, or contains some constraints? Are there any circumstances under which a datatype definition and instances of standard classes generated via derivation may fail and should be tested?\n Note that I'm not talking about cases where the type is accompanied by user-written functions.

I’m completely fine with GHCi, I need an IDE where I can “navigate to declaration” to learn quicker. I know VScode has, but unfortunately it doesn’t work for external ones, even Base.hs, IO.hs, etc. IntelliJ idea Haskell plug-in seems buggy, because when I add even one dependency (aeson), it starts complaining about versions and “navigate do declaration” stops working. It seems it somehow tied to lts-18. I tried 8.10.7, but still complains. 2. I’m completely fine with all types of monads, types, and type classes, I learnt about massive compile optimization when I use foldr, main question is how to distinguish tail recursion and non-tail. 3. Where do we store all the libraries. I found Hoogle. Is there only one place, 4. Which libraries we do use for - formatting - linting - other “good things” 5. Do we have kind of “recommended” resources to pass through in order not to ask dumb questions? 6. Do we have kind of stack of libraries which we use in all apps, like in Scala: - cats - cats-effects - fs2 streaming - circe (json) - http4s (http) - postgres, dynamo libraries - etc. 7. Forums, blog posts to follow 8. Other staff I need to know/learn. 9. Is difference between 8 and 9 such big as between Scala 2 and 3. 10.

I want to create small programs that I can compile and run. So many guides and courses seem to rely to heavily on GHCI in my opinion. I understand many people learn this way, but what is the point if I don't know how to actually create a project?\n For instance, I'm trying to follow along with \"Learn You a Haskell\", but quickly got discouraged with all of the GHCI use. I tried to create a Haskell project in VS Code, but I'm not even sure what should go in main!\n I learned other languages effectively because I was able to create bite-sized projects and experiment. I just feel very limited by the approach that functional programming language guides take.\n So my questions:\n  \nHow did you guys learn to actually create, structure, and execute projects? Am I just doing a bad job at looking for this information? Like I said, I'm able to create a main.hs file, but am a bit stuck on what goes after \"main = \" lol.\n Is there a reason so many guides stick with REPL? I've seen this from many FP languages. I've been wanting to learn an FP language but I keep bouncing around because I keep running into this problem. How are people learning these languages without knowing how to set up projects? I just don't feel like that should be an afterthought!\n  \nSorry to rant a bit, just am confused as to why this is the case. Maybe I just learn differently than others, but I find slapping things in the REPL to be a very ineffective way of actually understanding the concepts.

I am a CS student and do code in several different languages, as part of learning, haven't done any project or industry work and I have very very weak grasp at maths (fine with relation and functions in maths now). I just started reading learn you a haskell for great good since yesterday. I don't get what 5 /= 5 means, 5/5 := 1 then why its says False? Haskell has module but not classes at all, right? Some important concepts to make a solid grasp on? I'm just curious about haskell and because it's so different and bla bla bla. But where are actually its applications because I'm desiring to become a future haskell dev these days, please give me big solid reasons to stick to it. \n Please be kind.

I decided to use Cabal over stack, because I've seen other people use it to good end.\n ​\n So, my first step was to set up the structure of the project and try to see how the imports worked.\n So, I ran cabal init -n followed by creating a src/myfancypkg directory with myfancypkg.hs file, containing a single function. So, the structure of the project is:\n minesweeper |app -main.sh |src |myfancypkg -myfancypkg.hs -minesweeper.cabal \n dist-newstyle folder appeared after running cabal init\n Coming from Go, I got spoiled with the local imports discovery that happens auto-magically. When I try to use my new package in main, I get this error:\n app/Main.hs:3:8: error: parse error on input ‘myfancypkg’ | 3 | import myfancypkg (myhello) | \n I tried figuring out how to fix it, but after two hours of searching and trying I finally resorted to asking the mature crowd.

I am tempted to call it just dbName :: String -> String, because get feels Java-ish. But, from experience, if I go with just dbName, I later get into trouble, for example when I want to call the function and store its value, something like let dbName = getDbName appName, I would have a very hard time figuring out a name for that binding if I called the function dbName and not getDbName.\n So it feels like getDbName is reasonable, but then again, I can't say I am fond of it very much -> I don't have a better idea though.\n What would you do in this case? Would you use dbName or getDbName? If not, why not? Would you maybe put something else?\n Btw, I do put verbs in general, but with most of the other verbs it is clear they should go there, beacuse you are doing some parsing, calculating, migrating, ... .

          "description": "For the past months, I've been chasing down mysterious memory leaks in some of our services. But the graphs have baffled me a little bit (https://i.imgur.com/YguM1GA.png). And I have a few questions. \n This particular service is compiled with GHC 8.6.5 (old, I know, but we have a large codebase we need to upgrade). It is an API service that deals with Postgres (using Opaleye), Redis (using Hedis) and serves data on a Servant based Wai/Warp HTTP server. The service is quite busy, serving in the range thousands of requests per minute (conservative). \n The pattern of memory use looks very odd to me: it hovers around 10-20% for several days, and then it jumps to 60%+ percent. The service still doesn't completely crash, but it seems to me that the memory use spikes out of nowhere and fails to fall. There are sudden falls, but that is due to AWS starting multiple instances of the service (auto-scaling). \n The memory spikes also seem to occur on identical traffic patterns. \n My questions here are:\n  \nDoes this look like a memory leak? I've read previously that GC is not very \"eager\" unless tuned.\n If it does, what are the best ways to catch these early? These are quite problemmatic, obviously, and I've been hunting around for weeks without any success. \n I have tried profiling to investigate leaks earlier, but in this case, I've been unable to reproduce the issue locally or on our staging environment.\n  \n   submitted by    /u/asheshambasta  \n [link]   [comments]",

I am guessing some kind of contribution is needed somewhere to get that working? Is this something that could be done relatively easily, or is there a technical reason why it is difficult?\n EDIT: I think I was a bit quick to ask, as I think I have found a relevant issue on Haddock, I am guessing this is at the core of it: https://github.com/haskell/haddock/issues/742 , so I ended up asking a question there.

I worked on it for five years, and extracting a small part of it to a separate library was one of the nicest and most productive tasks I remember from those days :)\n I released Signals3 1.0.0 two months ago. It was a direct rewrite of the old version from Scala 2.11 to Scala 3 (hence the name). The whole thing is an implementation of the observer pattern and in Wire, it helped a lot to connect different parts of the app, made it react quickly to events, and made the code pretty and readable.\n Say, you sent a request to t…",

Here's the code I have so far:\n object CSVImport extends App: println(\"Running CSVImport\") def run(path: String) /* : Array[String] */ = val bufferedSource = io.Source.fromResource(path) //val outputArr = new Array[String](5) for line <- bufferedSource.getLines.drop(1) do val outputArr = line.split(\",\").map(_.trim) bufferedSource.close //outputArr \n I'm attempting to call it in Main:\n @main def Main() = val arrayOutput = CSVImport.run(csvPath) \n I've tried to make the Object Def output to an Array[String], however I've been struggling with making the output work. When I execute the code as-is with the extra bits commented out, I get a nice Scala array which I can call individual columns using println(s\"${flightData(1)}\"), but when I uncomment the extra code the output becomes a mess, I think due to the Array format being from java. I get the output [Ljava.lang.String;@35f983a6.\n My question is, is it possible to export the outputArr without converting it to a java format, so I can keep the legibility and pass it through to other functions? and if not, how can I format the gibberish output into something usable?\n    submitted by    /u/PikaXeD  \n [link]   [comments]",

Nowadays, if I ask it \"Why do sharks eat elephant eggs\" it doesn't tell me that sharks rarely get a chance to do so cause elephant eggs are so large and on land, but rather that elephants do not lay eggs.\n Today I decided to test it by asking how one would use Scala 3 macros to get the types of the inputs and outputs of a method. It had some decent suggestions to do that for someone that is new to macros, but a lot of its answer was false, suggesting people use something called QuotesContext, not recognizing properly what extension methods are available for the Symbol type, and worst of all, trying to splice Type values into an Expr.\n If they can manage to get chatgpt to actually tell the truth consistently (like saying \"I don't know how to do that\" rather than just lying) I think it will be a nice resource for discovering how to do stuff you don't currently know how to do. Sadly, it's still got a nasty habit of making stuff up.\n    submitted by    /u/markehammons  \n [link]   [comments]",

He says he agrees to some extent with Robert Martin's idea that language features (like type checking) are intended to constrain us, so we can't shoot ourselves in the foot.

I found it an interesting exercise ... and got some help from this forum earlier - thanks to those people.\n - It's entirely scala CLI. \n The scala-cli part was remarkably quick to get all the of the project boilerplate in place, publish out of CI etc. Even better - it cross compiled (super easily), and it cross platform tests really easily! And has different tests and capabilities for the JVM etc. I think these parts of scala-cli might still be subject to change... but it was amazingly easy / fast to get all of the \"project grind\" in place. \n Ultimately, there wasn't really a barrier, or a reason _not_ to (cross-)publish it - even something this small - and I think that's kind of fun :-).\n    submitted by    /u/quafadas  \n [link]   [comments]",

Does anyone have any comparative experience?\n The classes on Udemy have about half as much video (in terms of time) and are about 1/5th the price (e.g., $20 per class), but they also claim to have plenty of exercises, and I'm big fan of learning by doing, rather than just watching. So I'm a bit torn.\n If I don't have to solve problems myself, I often just zone out and don't remember much. This is why I have enjoyed Coursera and edX classes. On the other hand, I've also heard good things about Rock the JVM, in general.\n I watched a bit of the free Rock the JVM class on Scala for beginners, and it had you download the code from GitHub that they were writing in the video, but it didn't seem as if they had you do anything other than watch.\n    submitted by    /u/nessus42  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm just a beginner and I know nobody would recommend me this, cause I'm just a student and although I code a lot (follow tutorials, books and tinker what's taught, CC/CP), I don't have any experience in programming (projects or work with some org or company), but its my 4th sem in college and I found an app idea (won't share cause you guys will hate me for such a common sh*t, hehe jk) and at first and still, I'm following tutorials on flutter and side-by-side java for building mobile applications. I wonder if I could develop an application in Scala. What framework or library I would require, what should be the roadmap for a guy like me and literally any kinda tip, trick, help, advice would be very beneficiary. I personally love Scala (actually learning enough java for scala) and Dart (cause its too similar to scala (Supports OO and FP) but is very optimized for FE (its framework, flutter)) AFAIK. Please feel free to correct me where you get the opportunity, links to resources, articles or whatnot will also be very helpful. \n TLDR; I need proper guidance in developing mobile application using Scala, consider me an overall beginner (never done a project, but code a lot) but a Scala lover. Please take time to write long answer cuase sometimes I'm dumb and I need longer explanations. \n Thank you so much for helping.\n    submitted by    /u/Lokesh112k  \n [link]   [comments]",

It echoes exactly what I was seeing in languages like ML, OCaML, and Haskell in the 1990s, what I hoped for procedural languages, and what Scala has become on the FP side.\n What did Functional Programming ever do for us software engineers? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glDudJ3fqLk time: 00:52:26\n I think this video helps explain significant differences between some of the popular languages and why there has been a trend toward FP-type language capabilities and it distinguishes very well between those a typical programmer might want to use and where to leave off from those a library writer might need.\n He uses Scala for examples throughout, so it's very familiar. My only complaint is that the sound volume is too low.

We believe that with an appropriate set of tools and techniques it is\npossible to improve the reliability of both existing and new software without a\nhuge upfront investment.\nFormal methods do not have to be “too expensive” or “too time consuming”; simple\nthings can drastically improve the assurance of software, even without complete\nverification. Furthermore, academia is constantly generating new ideas. Which of\nthose translate into suitable tools for a given context? There is a spectrum of\nassurance and we believe in combining different techniques to gradually bring\nsoftware from zero assurance to fully verified. We aim to identify, use and\nimprove upon the most suitable tools for the job.\nWe offer high-assurance services and team augmentation for clients who either\nhave high-assurance needs or are themselves solution providers in this space. In\nparticular, we are happy to assist in the following areas:\nSpecification: help craft and lay specifications, and asses their aptness\nto an original goal by proving relevant properties about them\nTesting: help create better test suites, and build tools for executing\nthem over complex domains\nAuditing: comprehensively test a system, report and showcase behaviours\nthat are potentially harmful to system security or safety, assess code quality\nTooling: improve existing tools to suit the testing/verification needs of\na particular project, or write domain-specific tools from scratch\nRefactoring: help improve existing code bases through the use of\nmodularisation, strongly typed code, purity, and other compile-time guarantees\nFull-fledged verification: assist in projects aiming to develop a\ncompletely verified piece of software",

I have been able to get everything working fine when it comes to LaTeX exports, but I would ideally like to also export to HTML.\n In many fields of mathematics it is common for papers to follow number conventions along these lines:\n 1. Section one Theorem 1.1. <equation here> (1.2) Corollary 1.3 2. Section two Lemma 2.1. \n In LaTeX I would typically achieve this behaviour by using the amsthm package, putting this in my preamble:\n \\usepackage{amsthm} \\numberwithin{equation}{section} \\newtheorem{theorem}[equation]{Theorem} \\newtheorem{corollary}[equation]{Corollary} \\newtheorem{lemma}[equation]{Lemma} \n Then LaTeX to produce the outline at the start of this post would look something like this:\n \\section{Section one} \\begin{theorem} <theorem here> \\end{theorem} \\begin{equation} <equation here> \\end{equation} \\begin{corollary} <corollary here> \\end{corollary} \\section{Section two} \\begin{lemma} <lemma here> \\end{lemma} \n This means that in org mode I can just add a few lines to my LaTeX preamble with header options and then just write:\n * Section one #+begin_theorem <theorem here> #+end_theorem #+begin_equation <equation here> #+end_equation #+begin_corollary <corollary here> #+end_corollary * Section two #+begin_lemma <lemma here> #+end_lemma \n However, I've been struggling to figure out how to replicate any of this functionality for the html export. I've been trying to read the code that exports to html to see if there's a good place to hook in so I can add numbers, but I've been struggling to understand how any of it works.\n    submitted by    /u/pjhuxford  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I've been using embark for some months now, I like it, I like the concept, the way it works, and it's already part of my workflow in a number of tasks. On the other hand I also find it somewhat overwhelming. The keymaps are very large, and comprise numerous tasks which could potentially be performed through Embark. As a result, unless the binding is already part of muscle memory, having to resort to the embark-verbose-indicator is a time consuming step, because the list is so long it feels like finding a binding in C-h m. True, C-h offers completion, but at this point I'm already wondering if it wouldn't have been faster doing the task without using Embark.\n So, it works very well for bindings I know by heart. Which are a few. For others, I can't help but feel I'd prefer to have less alternatives. Thus, I'm considering adopting a \"bottom-up\" approach to Embark. The idea would be drastically reducing the available Embark bindings, and then adding the ones for which I feel the need. The question is: is there a \"proper\" way to go about this? I don't think nuking embark-keymap-alist to just a few maps is the way to go, since the keymaps put the bindings in the proper context. But, on the other hand, going around disabling each binding seems tedious. So, any advice on this?\n    submitted by    /u/gusbrs  \n [link]   [comments]",

So I would like to share some of the significant changes since v0.1.0.\n For those who don't know Eask, you can treat Eask as a successor to Cask.\n Project repository: https://github.com/emacs-eask/cli\n 🎉 Features\n  \nUnlike Cask-file, Eask-file is an elisp file. You can manage dependencies with elisp code like:\n  \nelisp (when (version< emacs-version \"26.3\") (depends-on \"package-name\")) \n  \nNode.JS is not required to use Eask; you can download the binary at our release page\n Out-of-the-box linters and test runners (checkdoc, package-lint, ert, buttercup, elsa, etc)\n Work across all OSs (Unless Node.js doesn't support it :P)\n Automatically download packages when they are used\n Fast, won't start Emacs unless it's needed\n  \n✨ Changes\n  \nEask now has all the commands from Cask and more (If Cask works, then Eask works)\n eask status to display the state of the workspace (eask info is also cool! :D)\n Convert Cask-file to Eask-file using eask init --from=cask\n eask generate workflow [action] to generate workflow files (support GitHub Actions, GitLab Runner, CircleCI, etc)\n eask generate [type] to generate common files like-pkg.el, -autoloads.el, LICENSE, .gitignore, etc.\n eask cat to display file with highlighting (uses e2ansi)\n Differentiate workspace with flag --global and --config, so you can use Eask as either a general tool or package management tool for your personal configuration\n eask create [type] creates elisp project (package or ELPA)\n webinstall is now available, install it with curl!\n  \n🔍 See also\n  \nDocumentation\n setup-eask (for GHA)\n eask-mode (package)\n company-eask (package)\n eldoc-eask (package)\n flycheck-eask (package)\n flymake-eask (package)\n  \n   submitted by    /u/jcs090218  \n [link]   [comments]",

If not, could someone please suggest what modifications I might need to do in order to enable this?\n org-enforce-todo-dependencies seems relevant, but this seems to assume that one task's completion may only enable at most one other task (its parent), while I can imagine that there can be one-to-many such links.\n    submitted by    /u/digikar  \n [link]   [comments]",

I looked through some of the old threads but couldn't find the answer I need. Any relevant info is appreciated.\n  \nWhat are some suggested options for syncing Org-mode files across different OS platforms, preferably E2E encrypted? One combination appears to be file sync client + Cryptomator, though unsure if that'd prove to be problematic in the long term.\n \nHow do people keep their configs consistent across platforms (also backing them up)? Let's say that I carry around a Linux-powered laptop, but at home I switch between Windows and macOS for different purposes; each of them may have slightly different configs that correspond to the platform.\n \nIs there a built-in cheatsheet of sort, or a toggle reference tool that can be customized, for a beginner to use as a reference while learning common keystrokes and commands? I have been killing by searching with apropos and then yanking to a separate org file; it works, just somewhat clunky.

          "description": "Had a curious psychological reaction to using Emacs for pretty much everything on a minimal linux desktop over about six months. I think it was to to with the plain text and almost complete lack of graphical interest. I just started feeling really flat emotionally. Like the screen I was looking at was utterly uninteresting.\n So I went back to windows for a while, using VS Code, a graphical git client and so on and strangely there I felt the opposite, like the graphical density with so much on the screen was almost overwhelming after months without all that graphical clutter. That faded over a week or two and I found myself adding a few non-Emacs apps with more graphical elements alongside Emacs to mix things up.\n This was quite strange, I learned to program using VT terminals and actually worked in places where my daily computer was a vax system with a VT terminal and never felt anything like this.\n I'm not intending this as a slight against Emacs, but I found it was interesting that my brain just started to shut down a little due to the lack of stimulating stuff on the screen. I was wondering if anyone else has had a similar experience? I know some of you guys pretty much live in Emacs 24/7, do you find it overwhelming to use a very graphical application after that? Or people who do the opposite and work in a graphically intensive environment a lot, do you find it relaxing, or boring, or have any other reaction to switching to Emacs (or any other plain text environment) afterwards?\n    submitted by    /u/nnomae  \n [link]   [comments]",

As my fingers dance across the keyboard, conjuring powerful Emacs incantations with ease, I find myself unable to enjoy the mundane GUIs and simple apps that litter the software landscape. 🧹🖱️\n You see, dear friends, Emacs has spoiled me with its boundless customization, incredible extensibility, and mind-bending keybindings. Now, I dread the moments when I must use the pedestrian applications my company forces upon me. Oh, how I long for the sweet embrace of Emacs in those dark hours! 💔🕰️\n In my despair, I turn to you, my fellow Emacs magicians, for camaraderie and counsel:\n  \nHow do you cope when the world demands you to use lesser tools? 🛠️😢\n Are there secret spells to imbue these uninspired apps with even a fraction of Emacs' power? 🔮✨\n Can we petition the powers that be to make Emacs the one true editor, unifying the world in a harmonious symphony of keystrokes? 🌍🎼\n  \nI eagerly await your wisdom and insights. In the meantime, I'll be huddled in the corner, clutching my Emacs manual like a treasured tome, dreaming of the day when all software is as magically magnificent as our beloved editor. 📖💭\n Yours in Emacs enchantment, 🧙‍♂️\n    submitted by    /u/Passeride  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "So I was just going through my older journal entries and found the following entry: \n  \nI do not think that AI is the right choice for a lot of our things if the underlying problem of freeing humans always remains. It makes more sense to me to be a part of a group where the focus is on freeing our time through removal of shackling of our time than to build AIs that feed the capitalist to extract more wealth from underpaying humans and from keeping them subjugated to 8 hour work days no matter how advanced the AI is. Eventually, the AI is going to be a prime worker for the capitalist than for the betterment of humanity. \n I refuse to be a part of this process and that is why I am choosing not to get into those domains in any which way. \n Emacs therefore remains my stronghold that I would like to curate and build my freedom from. If one cannot free themselves from 8 hour senselessness, then they can build stuff to free up time and work from home and do other more productive and happiness, mental peace bringing things. Productive here means that doing what I really want to do and doing it rather than producing as much value for the capitalist who would rather discard me if there was a more productive person or an AI.\n  \nThis reminded me about one of the prime reasons why I wanted to use Emacs - it's extensibility that enabled me to build shortcuts and workflows that help me with shaving off sufficient amount of time which I spent on repetitive tasks. The trick however is to not to be vocal about your efficiency to your bosses because the time saved will be used against you to staff you with more work whether you want it or not. \n Go use the time saved to spend with your loved ones, yourself, exercise, learn something, do nothing or even just calm and rest.

There is also this package https://github.com/renzmann/treesit-auto which seems to handle the installation, mapping and activation of the language modes.\n But what I don't understand is, how do I activate syntax hightlighing with treesit, without having tree-sitter-hl-mode? Is this done automatically once the major mode for a given language supports Tree Sitter? With the help of treesit-auto?\n    submitted by    /u/drhupf  \n [link]   [comments]",

Libenchant provides backends like Hunspell and Nuspell which also power the spell checking in word processors or browsers.\n I am interested in your feedback.

For example, while pcomplete opens a new window for completion it does not switch to it automatically and it does not escape the spaces. This means that every time I have to add quotes myself or escape the spaces manually. I would also like pcomplete to be like orderless and vertico and allow me to select entries the same way.\n I am now using corfu with eshell and it is a bit less frustrating but it is still not smooth as much as zsh completion system is. For example, I have to press escape otherwise I cannot stop the corfu autocompletions once it is activated.\n So my questions are:\n ​\n  \nIs there a way to make pcomplete escape spaces and special characters when completing in eshell? Ideally I should not have to switch to the pcomplete window but it should be done automatically.\n Is there a way to use vertico and orderless, rather than pcomplete, or even in tandem with pcomplete? I would like my eshell experience to be as close to the rest of the Emacs.\n Is there any other suggestion or improvement that makes you life in eshell easier?\n  \n​\n Thank you very much.\n    submitted by    /u/kamui78  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "So, I've been using org-roam to make notes and what not. And it has been going great. Now, I have an exam, which is an open-book exam, so I think printing out my notes would be very useful, since it can get into details of things. So, I wonder if there is a way to export all the linked notes to HTML/PDF, so I can easily print them? Now, i don't want notes to be in some order, it is just that I want if A -> B (A links to B), and if A is getting exported, so should B. (I know there can be cycles, so I will traverse only few depths before I return).\n Does this sound like something which has been accomplished before, or I should try to do it before exams? :)\n    submitted by    /u/sh-zam  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello,\n I am kinda posing a question in the form of a package here: basically, what’s the most efficient way to bind keys? It’s one of those questions I had neglected to ask for so long that I’m a little afraid to ask now, cuz keyboard macros are kind of a core feature to Emacs. Anyway, here's what I wrote:\n https://github.com/Overdr0ne/skey\n I felt like there was a missing define-keys function, so I tried to provide it in this package. Rather than writing:\n  (define-key some-map (kbd \"x\") #'my-func) (define-key some-other-map (kbd \"x\") #'my-func) (define-key some-map (kbd \"y\") #'my-other-func) (define-key some-other-map (kbd \"y\") #'my-other-func) etc...  skey lets you write:  (skey-define-keys '(some-map some-other-map) '((\"x\" my-func) (\"y\" my-other-func) etc...)) \n As of this writing, skey is 9 lines of code in one function. Is there already a standard way to do this? Is everyone just using raw define-key, maybe in a loop? general? use-package’s :bind? Reinventing your own key definers? I explain more in the readme some of the ways I bind keys, but I was just curious how other people are doing things.\n Suggestions for additional features to this package are welcome, but I would be just as happy to learn that there’s a simple, standard way to do what this package does. Maybe add lazy loading by default or something? I dunno, this is kind of a weird post lol...\n    submitted by    /u/SamTheComputerSlayer  \n [link]   [comments]",

However, here i have to type C-x 8 RET GREEK CAPITAL LETTER SIGMA, which is pretty inconvenient. This issue does not go away when turning evil mode off\n Additionally when in evil mode there are some agda-mode keybinds beginning with C-u that I really wish could work. I'm not sure what they get remapped to, if anything. \n Thank you for any help in understanding this.

There's some interesting in this for sure, but I feel like I haven't seen people recognizing that this isn't just another interesting trend we can integrate into our favorite editor, this could be a really pivotal moment for emacs, because I contend there isn't another application out there that is so well suited to working with LLMs.\n First of all, the primary thing you want when dealing with LLMs is integrate it with your writing environment. Emacs can do that, and already does, via many different packages. And with Emacs, you can use it to write just about anything. Code, documentation, technical paper…",

          "description": "I'm not quite sure how to phrase this question, as I don't entirely understand how the inferior-python-mode works, but I believe it is derived from comint-mode, which from reading Mickey Petersen's post and personal experience, is quite cumbersome. For instance, looking at the help documentation for a function, e.g. help(list) produces:\n WARNING: terminal is not fully functional Press RETURN to continue \n Scrolling through the documentation is then quite awkward, and even though I hit can hit q to quit, it sometimes hangs and there is some funny indentation going on afterwards (>>> >>>).\n  \n However, if I run vterm, or even just term, enter my shell (which is zsh) I have no such message, and it works just like a non-Emacs terminal, allowing me to scroll and quit comfortably.\n  \n Is there a way to call Python via vterm or term when running a :session in an org-src block, or when doing M-x run-python? Or at least get better scrolling behavior?\n    submitted by    /u/nonreligious  \n [link]   [comments]",

I want to make this scroll line by line, instead of by pixel with pixel-scroll-mode because that just makes it laggy, and not smooth at all.\n So, here's the basic idea. When you call one of the scroll functions, of which there are four (page up/down and half page up/down) they calculate how many lines you'll need to scroll for. They generate a number, positive or negative depending on the direction. This number is then passed to a function that will …",

So it seems that somehow Edwina is interfering with this process.\n Has anyone else had this problem?

          "description": "I'm new to emacs, and I've learned the basics, installed some packages, and configured it to my liking the last 2 weeks or so. I'm using the basic emacs keybindings (no evil).\n One thing that has repeatedly caused me some headaches, is custom keybindings, either for functionality of packages that don't provide their own keybindings, or for custom functions. For instance,\n  \nI want to configure a binding for consult-line (searches for occurrences, lists them in consult, allows to jump to match), something I'm probably going to use frequently. So I go for `C-c slash` , vaguely inspired by vim, which I've used for a while in the past.\n I try it in my config file and it works.\n I want to use it in org mode and realize it's already bound to something else there. Shit.\n  \nHow to best avoid this \"in advance\", such that it's unlikely to happen in the future, even if I install more packages or use more modes? I guess letting my own commands start with `C-c` is a bad idea.\n I thought about starting all custom commands with something else, like `C-some_key...` where `C-some_key` kind of works as something like a personal leader key. But when I use the same leader/prefix key for all personal keybindings, no matter what they do, I feel this breaks the logic of the seperation that we have with `C-x` vs `C-c` for instance. Whereas using multiple such preface keys seems to escalate keybindings and memorization efforts.\n Also using C might be difficult, as C-something is already bound to a bunch of stuff (eg `C-v` for scrolling). What else would be a good option? How are experienced people handling their personal keybindings?\n EDIT made: clarified that the binding I was trying to use was C-c slash-key, somehow it only displayed C-c, which made it confusing\n    submitted by    /u/throw_ag  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi, I would like to build an Emacs configuration from scratch. I know there are some alternatives out there such as Prelude, Purcell's Emacs.d, and Crafted Emacs but I would like to build my own.\n By modular configuration I mean a configuration in which things are split up in separate files. For example:\n ;; in the main init file: (require 'php) (require 'javascript) (require 'dired) \n If I don't want to use Emacs to code in a certain language I can just comment out the require statement.\n I've noticed that people who built modular configurations did not rely on use-package and they just used the built-in features.\n I was wondering if it's possible to build a modular configuration using use-package? I guess use-package is just a macro and what it does it groups things together. Right?\n I think what I need to do is to just put all those use-package chunks into separate files? For example, all dired related stuff into a dired.el file:\n (use-package dired :ensure nil :after all-the-icons-dired :bind (\"C-x C-j\" . dired-jump) :hook (dired-mode . all-the-icons-dired-mode) :custom (dired-auto-revert-buffer t) (dired-listing-switches \"-agho --group-directories-first\")) (use-package dired-narrow :after dired :bind (:map dired-mode-map (\"/\" . dired-narrow))) (use-package dired-subtree :after dired :bind (:map dired-mode-map (\"<backtab>\" . dired-subtree-cycle) (\"<tab>\" . dired-subtree-toggle))) (use-package all-the-icons-dired :after all-the-icons) \n and PHP related stuff in php.el, so on.. even if the use-package stuff is just 3 lines of code in that file (I may add more stuff in that file in the future).\n I can go with a programming.el that contains all languages but I think having a separate file for each language is better because I can disable and enable the languages I want easier in main.el.\n Please share your thought about this.

It usually works flawlessly with locally buildable smallish projects and sane build systems (be it autotools, cmake, meson, never really had an issue). \n Problems I foresee:\n  \ngenerate compile_commands.json: hope I'll be able to install bear on the build server and that bear will actually work\n separate dev environment and build server: could I maybe generate compile_commands.json in the linux build server and copy it and have it working on the windows dev machine? \n emacs on windows, native or wsl2? in the latter case cmdline or with some xserver, which one? I just need a few packages, vertico, consult, marginalia, etc. Org-mode would be nice.

Well, I decided to look towards the exotic, and so far I have stopped at emacs.\n There were several questions(In Emacs I'm a complete noob). If there are java developers who write in Emacs, I hope for their help (and configs :)).\n Actual questions:\n 1) Which is better: build emacs from scratch or use doomEmacs as a starting point?\n 2) Which lsp servers are better to install for Java (sometimes I also write in Scala)?\n 3) Which plugins to install for Maven and Gradle? Will there be auto-completion? \n 4) Will it be possible to create and run projects directly from Emacs? (Not so important, but still)\n 5) How is Spring? Is there a plugin that is analogous to Spring Tools?\n 6) Which plugins should I use to integrate git, sql, markdown, xml?\n 7) Which plugins should I use for database integration? Is there such a possibility at all? Interested in redis, postgresql.\n What I plan to use it for:\n 1) Development of the backend part\n 2) JavaFX development of home projects.\n 3) Minecraft modding.

The language deals with a lot of logical operators such as \"∧\", \"∨\" and \"∀\" etc. What I am trying to implement is a feature so that I can write \"\\and\" to get the \"∧\" symbol (kinda like they do in the agda-mode).\n Currently I am using the prettify-package, however I realised that this package does not actually replace the text with the symbols in the file. It simply replaces it visually in my mode, but the source-text still remains in the file.\n I could rewrite the parser of the language to also parse \"\\and\", but I prefer to avoid this and get Emacs to replace the actual string with the Unicode-symbol it refers to.\n Does anyone know about any similar package to prettify-package which also replaces the actual strings with the symbols? \n Thanks in advance \n PS. I am not sure how standard the prettify package is within the Emacs community.

It exports the org file as RSS file. But I wanted more than one weblog, and I wanted to have an subscribe link to the corresponding xml file added to the html-postamble string. For instance: general.html -> general.xml etc.\n I figured out there is an property list called \"info\" generated as the export process is running. This property list includes all properties from the org-export-options-alist and the export backend specific options alist. (i.e.: org-export-define-backend 'html)\n The property :html-postamble can be a function name which is called during the export process. Its only argument is info, which is the property list.

I've recently started using Emacs with Evil Mode. Having used VScode and IntelliJ IDEs in the past. Afaik if you use the VIM keybidings \"properly\" there is no need to select text with the arrows, but I am currently somewhat short on time so I haven't had much chance to learn them properly. So for now I am using the arrows keys. But when I use them in the insert state shift + arrow is always jumping whole words. And Ctrl + shift + arrow selects whole words. I would like it to behave like I am used to with shift starting the selection, arrows moving one char at a time, and ctrl + arrow to be used to jump whole words? Is that somehow possible? Which brings me to my next question \n \nWhy is which key not showing the bindings for Ctrl + Arrow / Shift+Arrow etc. ? In regards to my previous questions, I was trying to find out how I can achieve it. Online I heard which key (C h + the key you want described) often, but there's no way for it to describe Ctrl/shift + arrow for me. If I press C-h k shift-arrow it only describes the behavior the arrow key. Is it because Ctrl/shift are some sort of modifiers and not keys? If yes, is there any way how to describe behavior of such key combinations?\n \n I hope my questions make sense, english is not my native language and I have a hard time to describe what I mean.

So excited to have dived into emacs and the reddit channel.\n I have a failry simple question but I couldn't find the answer on the internet. I mainly program with python and now use company and flymake (thank you for suggestion via previous post). I think that very wisely emacs has them disabled at startup. If I wanted to write a letter I would have found it very annoying to have random exlcamation marks about indentation :-p\n So I want to assign just one key to enable both of them at the same time. I found how to assign them seperately with this:\n (global-set-key [f8] 'company-mode)\n (global-set-key [f9] 'flymake-mode)\n ​\n So I was wondering if there's something like\n (global-set-key [f8] 'company-mode ' flymake-mode)\n ​\n Thank you all for your time\n    submitted by    /u/tsallinia86  \n [link]   [comments]",

But for debugging purposes, I removed it.\n company-mode won't kick in automatically in emacs-lisp-mode buffers. Activating it manually works like a charm though. By order of elimination I've identified lsp-mode interaction (mapping and load order) as the culprit. Without it, everything works as intended. I have a few guesses which I won't utter because they'd probably make me sound like an idiot.\n This is my first time hand crafting an .emacs.d.

At the mean time, the left thumb is naturally fallen on the alt position, which makes it convenient for forward and backward word. Some main prefix keys are maintained. And the layout is suggested with the letter frequency, allowing attention put on the home row regions without moving hands around.

With a little translation help from SpeedRect, you can grab one or more columns of numerical data into calc, do all kinds of operations on it there (pretty much anything), and then, once you are happy, yank it back into the buffer, over the top of the rectangle selection.\n    submitted by    /u/JDRiverRun  \n [link]   [comments]",

It can also support Markdown links so you can work with other editors too. The app is called Captee and the video link below demonstrates it at work.\n Captee alpha demo\n Note that Captee is very much in an alpha/proof-of-concept/bleeding-edge state of polish right now. You’ll get the best results for Captee if you use the macOS Yamamoto Mitsuharu port of Emacs. It supports Org Protocol out of the box, otherwise you will have to use the system clipboard to share content.\n To capture selected text via org-protocol you’ll need to define a capture template on the Emacs side first before you use Captee. Here’s an example capture template that uses the placeholders described in the Org capture protocol.\n (setq org-capture-templates '( (\"a\" \"Captee Capture\" entry (file+headline \"~/org/captee.org\" \"Captee Captures\") \"* %:description\\n%:annotation\\n%i\\n%?\" :empty-lines 1) )) \n Okay with all that said, I’m looking for testers. If you’re interested, you can get an alpha build of Captee via this TestFlight link.

So i know its possible, & not rocket science. Yesterday I made a patch file like this, with a nice auto-generated file name.\n 0001-Add-fubar-to-whizbang.patch\n When I try and use Magit today to do the same with a different range, I end up with either a) multiple patch files, or b) a prompt for a filename for the patch file to be produced. Which is a sign I'm on the wrong track, because I did NOT choose the above filename yesterday.\n Can you advise?\n Thank you!\n    submitted by    /u/MaleadPogrom  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "This may be obvious to some of you, but I came across this just today, so wanted to lay this out clearly in case it helps others.\n git log has a mechanism to trace evolution of lines across commits - think of this as an even more fine grained version of seeing log for a single file. This \"-L\" arg in git takes the form of -L<start>,<end>:<file> to restrict to certain line numbers or -L:<funcname>:<file> to restrict to a particular function. Magit has the \"-L\" infix argument to use this directly - but this interface makes you do the manual work of feeding in the input.\n Instead, you can use the direct options available in magit-file-dispatch bound to C-c M-g by default. To trace functions, use the t command (trace) to trace the function under cursor. To trace particular lines - mark region and then call C-c M-g l to see the commit history only for those lines.\n This last command is basically (magit-log-buffer-file) which you can bind directly to something more easy to use. If you use evil, something like the following will make this much easier to use:\n (define-key evil-visual-state-map (kbd \";gl\") 'magit-log-buffer-file) \n    submitted by    /u/chandergovind  \n [link]   [comments]",

I just started using emacs 29 with treesitter. \n I wanted to write a function that I could use to highlight keywords like TODO, FIXME etc. in code comments using treesitter. \n I know there is a package `hl-todo` that I can just import. But the package contains a lot more than I actually need. \n I also wanted to get familiar with emacs font-lock, font-faces and treesitter. But the documentation for the treesitter used by emacs seems a bit spotty. I'd be grateful if someone could point me in the right direction here. I would also be grateful if anyone could tell me if treesitter is actually a good fit for this or not.\n The high-level plan was to make a query to treesitter to get all `comment` nodes and then search the text in the nodes to see if there are any keywords that need to be highlighted (it would be great if there is a query that could just return those keywords, but I couldn't find such a query). But I'm not quite sure how to proceed from there. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!\n    submitted by    /u/tez_nikka  \n [link]   [comments]",

But I also want the 2nd and 3rd FooBar to be a \"stop\" where I can enter a different value.\n When using (s name) for the first, and name for the others, they get skipped. When using (s name) for the others as well, all three change simultaneously. So I tried using the form variants of (p ...), but to no avail.\n Here's what I currently use, but it lacks the possibility to change locally:\n lisp (nt \"newtype \" (s name) \" = \" name \" { un\" name \" :: \" p \" }\") \n Can you help me? [Ideally, I'd like to actually change the whole unFooBar in the third place, but that's probably the same problem in disguise, just that the default value is calculated by a form.]\n    submitted by    /u/KenranThePanda  \n [link]   [comments]",

While reading that, an emacs power user will probably turn pale, but that's the way I do it for now since I am lacking a better alternative.

          "description": "Hello there,\n Ive recently gone back to emacs and tried to actually learn it. At first i was using doom emacs, i made a config for it, alls good. Then i tried to open up a project and start coding and i ran into all kinds of issues ranging from lsp not initializing to tab indentation being 2 spaces insted of 4 in half of the modes and completions not heaving any relevant suggestions. So then i switched to spacemacs because i thaught that it had better support for rust and was better integrated. Turns out it was a similar story, completions sucked lsp half of the time didnt initialize and i had to explicitly enable it with M-x lsp every time i opened a project. \n Its now the third day that im just tinkering with emacs and i didn't solve any of the issues listed above.\n Is emacs just bad developer experiance? Am i missing something? Am i just dumb and its a simple solution?\n I want to love emacs, but its making it real hard to do it.\n note: the lsp issue i could maybe live with, but the completions and indentation issues are really bad. A specific case when the completions are the worst at is for example somstructvar.<completions here> or when importing (rust example use somemod::<completion here>), the indentation is bad mainly in js/ts (rjsx) and json\n    submitted by    /u/d0a1v2i3d-  \n [link]   [comments]",

So if I want to edit the file again, I have to close the buffer, then find the file again.

Why? Any time I explicitly activate rectangle-mark-mode, I do so only to call one of the various *-rectangle-* commands next. So why should I remember/type their prefixes? And what's more, I can see that I have this mode active by the region shape & left border.\n Repeat wasn't the right approach, but it was simple to activate a transient map in rectangle-mark-mode-hook. Check this tiny gist. So C-x SPC, highlight your desired rectangle, then [k]ill [d]elete del-[<SPC>] [c]lear [o]pen s[t]ring [w]-copy [y]ank [N]umber. I didn't even know about the (unbound) command delete-whitespace-rectangle, but will use it often now that I don't have to bind/remember it.\n The only thing I wish for is the ability to recall the region of the last marked rectangle (line+col; from, to), for when you'd like to do a series of rect operations in a row on the same columns.\n    submitted by    /u/JDRiverRun  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "A \"morgue file\" is a collection of notes, articles, and files kept by investigators or journalists for possible future use. Today, I have developed a morgue file that in my zettelkasten that collects items that I think might provide fodder for my fiction writing.\nI write speculative fiction and so I track newspaper articles or reports that I think might serve as the germ of a story. Then, as part of my writing process, I'll make a new (structure) note and include links to articles or pieces that might inspire pieces of my story (whether character, setting, or plot).\nFor example, I recently learned about Point Nemo, a \"spacecraft cemetery\" in the Pacific Ocean that is a \"pole of inaccessibility,\" the location farthest from any land. This was intriguing enough, so I did some more cursory reading and learned (among other things) that it is also a remarkably lifeless part of the ocean because it is so far from land. Also, in spite of not being officially identified as the \"pole of inaccessibility\" until 1992, Point Nemo is near where H.P. Lovecraft placed R'lyeh, the lost city where Cthulhu is imprisoned!\nAt any rate, I now have a cluster of notes about Point Nemo that is forming the gensis of a story about scavengers trying to salvage material in this remote location. The real-life details are helping me flesh out the skeleton of a plot and raising more questions for me to explore. (For example, I know next to nothing about what might be involved in this salvage operation, so I now have some more reading to do!)\nI thought I'd share in case others are interested in using their zettelkasten to generate ideas for fiction, and to learn from others who might implement a similar practice. Do you have any other tips or advice? Pitfalls to avoid?",

I'll launch the first salvo.\n\n  \n@Massimo_Curatella said over at Ideas We're Grappling With March 23, 2023::\nI am thinking about designing a tutorial on how to create your user profile to get the best out of participating to online communities.\n\n\nNot sure that even a sparkling user profile like mine  is good enough to bolt us into participating or be a tornado hurling others to interact with us. But I could be wrong.\n\n  \nI need to set specific boundaries to my exploration and that was the smallest unit of value I could think of.\n\n\nConcentrating on the user profile is a small gesture but who knows where it could lead? I'm willing to follow along and help where I can.\n\n  \nI started to talk about that idea to friends and, surprisingly, they found it useful.\n\n\nI have a mildly snarky question, are you talking to us \"about the idea as friends\" or are we the \"real people\" you want to experiment on?\nThis is a superb idea, and I'll participate. I think this forum would benefit from anything that would enhance engagement.\nTo start this off, here is a screenshot of my profile.",

I spent too much time programming, according to my sweetie. She is probably right, but getting lost in programming problems felt so good.\nThoughts about construal level theory have surfaced again in my ZK, leading me to Robin Hanson, Associate Professor at George Mason University, and his paper on the sacred. We See The Sacred From Afar, To See It The Same. I quickly looked at the paper, and while I don't agree with everything, Robin's look at the construal-level theory and how it relates to our concept of sacred is fascinating and well-referenced.\nA week filled with productive distractions. Next week I'm afraid other people's expectations of me will creep up the priority list.\nWhat's happening in your ZK?\n\nMy seven day zettel production",

In particular there is a translated and published book Zettel from 1967 which contains 717 zettels from Wittgenstein’s Nachlass, or works left behind following his death in 1951. I’ve had a copy lying around for a bit, but finally spent some time with it. The book cleverly has a parallel text form with the German on one side of the page and the English on the facing page. I’ve also seen translations of the book in both Spanish and Italian for those who might prefer those.\nWhile the individual entries themselves are as fascinating as dipping randomly into some of Henry David Thoreau’s journals or Georg Christoph Lichtenberg’s Waste Books, the brief introductory material by the e…",

          "description": "Hi, I have been lurking around for a while now, really enjoying the discussions, so I thought it might be time to introduce myself.\nI am a originally from Slovakia, but have been living in Norway for a decade now. I’m a researcher in data analysis, working with a lot of machine learning, and like to learn about a variety of things in my free time too. My interests range from the biophysics of movement through diet, pregnancy and childbirth, to neurodiversity, gardening, parenting, knowledge work and whatever else that catches my interest.\nI have first heard about the Zettelkasten method about two months ago and it was a love at first sight. I always struggled with organising my notes and the organically organised chaos of Zettelkasten just makes perfect sense to me.\nI started out using Obsidian. That is actually how I ran into the Zettelkasten, as I was originally only looking for a simple markdown editor. After a month and a hundred notes I could feel this was becoming very important to me and decided to move to an open source software instead - namely org-roam in Emacs. I’m new to Emacs, but fairly stubborn, so I have been steadily climbing its famously steep learning curve and I think I’m quite happy with my choice. The time when my Zettelkasten was hanging between the two systems, so to speak, was quite uncomfortable though.\nI haven’t quite landed with my note-taking routines yet, but I have the most important bits in place. I use my trusted Bullet Journal for planning, journaling, tracking and fleeting notes, while any “knowledge” goes into the Zettelkasten with Zotero keeping track of the references.\nI am very excited to see how things will evolve and looking forward to the interesting discussions here on the forum.",

          "description": "The idea of having and maintaining a Zettelkasten has become increasingly popular since the »Zettelkästen. Maschinen der Phantasie« exhibition at Marbach in March 2013 and the appearance of the website zettelkasten.de in late 2013 and has grown significantly with the Cambrian explosion of a variety of digital note taking tools since 2018.\nBut here’s a fun little historical linguistic puzzle:\nWhat was the first use of the word Zettelkasten in a predominantly English language setting?\nIn my own notes/research the first occurrence I’ve been able to identify in an English language setting is on Manfred Kuehn’s blog in Taking note: Luhmann’s Zettelkasten on 2007-12-16. He’d just started his blog earlier that month.\nHas anyone seen an earlier usage? Can you find one? Can you beat this December 2007 date or something close by a different author?\nGoogle’s nGram Viewer doesn’t indicate any instances of it from 1800-2019 in its English search, though does provide a graph for German with peaks in the 1850s, 1892 (just after Ernst Bernheim’s Lehrbuch der Historischen Methode in 1889), 1912, 1925, and again in 1991.\nTwitter search from 2006-2007 finds nothing and there are only two results in German both mentioning Luhmann.\nMy best guess for earlier versions of the appearance zettelkasten in English might stem from the work/publications of S. D. Goitein or Gotthard Deutsch, but I’ve yet to see anything there. \nFor those who speak German, what might you posit as a motivating source for the rise of the word in the 1850s or any of the other later peaks?\n(Originally published on https://boffosocko.com/2023/03/11/first-use-of-zettelkasten-in-an-english-language-setting/ with aggregated commentary.)",

It was designed as an accessory to be stood next to one's desk to accommodate a telephone at the beginning of the telephone era and also served as storage for one's card index.\nGiven the broad business-based use of the card index at the time and the newness of the telephone, this piece of furniture likely was not designed as an early proto-rolodex, though it certainly could have been (and very well may have likely been) used as such in practice.\nI totally want one of these as a side table for my couch/reading chair for both storing index cards and as a writing surface while reading! Bonus points for wheels that allow it to travel around the house.\nAs seen in:\nSystem: The Magazine of Business. Vol. 10. A. W.
